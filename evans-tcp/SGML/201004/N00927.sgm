<HEAD>THE PREFACE</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friendly Reader;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN this my An&s;wer to the Book, fal&s;ly called, <HI>Proteus Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cus,</HI> lately publi&s;hed at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> I have not followed the Method and Order of his pages, who compo&s;ed it; for it is as void of good method as it is of true matter, and abounds with what is fal&s;e. But I have drawn up what I thought fit to Reply to, and briefly, as I well could, under the following Heads.</P>
<P><HI>Sect. I</HI> His mi&s;repre&s;enting the chief Controver&s;ie, as it be|gan betwixt the <HI>Quakers</HI> and me here at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> about the year 1691. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fully detected.</P>
<P>Sect. II. His Calumnies and fal&s;e Accu&s;ations again&s;t tho&s;e worthy Per&s;ons, the eight Mini&s;ters, who atte&s;ted to the truth of my Quotations in my Third and Fourth Narratives, collected out of the <HI>Quakers</HI> chief Authors, as well as again&s;t me and D. L. are di&s;covered and repelled, and the Quotations in the broad Sheet, called, <HI>The &s;erious Call,</HI> which he had mo&s;t unju&s;tly excepted again&s;t, I have proved to be true, according to the true correct printed Copies; and that there were no other faults in any of the mo&s;t uncorrect Copies, but what were Typographical, and of &s;mall moment, is plainly proved.</P>
<P>Sect. III. I give &s;ome In&s;tances of his and his Brethrens mo&s;t &s;hameful and deceitful way of &s;training the Quotations out of the Quakers Books, thereby to cloak and hide them.</P>
<P>Sect. IV. I have in my ju&s;t Defence an&s;wered to his In&s;tances brought by him to prove me varied in Fundamentals, which he
<PB REF="001110_0004_0FB042A1A3FC4F90">
fal&s;ly chargeth on me, that they are acknowledged by my &s;elf to be &s;uch.</P>
<P>Sect. V. I have al&s;o cleared my &s;elf from the unju&s;t A&s;per|tions he hath ca&s;t upon me, as touching my blaming the Magi|&s;trates in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> for their per&s;ecuting me and my Friends in the Year 1692. as al&s;o from his fal&s;e and invidious Charge of rendring me guilty of Per&s;ecution; with &s;everal other Fal&s;hoods and Calumnies of his again&s;t me, rejected and di&s;proved.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Friendly Reader,</HI> Why is it, think ye, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> neither here nor el&s;e-where can be moved to meet me face to face, to debate &s;o much as matter of Fact with me, as touching the truth of the Quotations, which they &s;ay are fal&s;e, and I &s;ay are true (but the truth can never be &s;o well found out as by having the Authors Books openly produced, and the Quotations publickly read and &s;een in the pre&s;ence of both parties?) Surely there can be no cau&s;e imaginable why they refu&s;e this, but that they are &s;elf-con&s;cious of their being guilty of the things charged upon them, and they are afraid to have their deeds brought to the Light.</P>
<P>They &s;ay, as this Author al&s;o &s;aith, <HI>That a Heretick</HI> (&s;uch as they think I am) <HI>ought to be Rejected after the fir&s;t and &s;econd Ad|monition, and not di&s;puted with</HI> by word of Mouth. But that's a meer Eva&s;ion, why do they &s;till di&s;pute with me in Print, and yet refu&s;e all Di&s;pute with me by word of Mouth, but that they know they cannot be &s;o ea&s;ily detected in writ, and as the Pro|verb is, <HI>The Paper will not Blu&s;h,</HI> becau&s;e not one of many Hun|dreds, though they &s;hould read the Quakers Defences in Print, when they deny that there are &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages in their Books, either have, or know how to have the Books out of which the Pa&s;&s;ages are quoted, whereby to examine the truth of them.</P>

K. here begun by him, about eleven or twelve years ago, was chiefly about that of the <HI>&V;niver&s;al nece&s;&s;ity of the Faith and Knowledge of Chri&s;ts outward Death and Sufferings, in order to Salvation.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> This is a manife&s;t Fal&s;hood, not only the printed Books on my &s;ide, and the Manu&s;cripts yet extant on their &s;ide, but many Per&s;ons now living at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> of good Credit, who were Eye and Ear-Witne&s;&s;es to our Debates in publick, are &s;uffi|cient Evidences. The fir&s;t and chiefe&s;t Controver&s;ie I had with them at that time, was, <Q>Whether to preach Faith in Chri&s;t without us, (as both God &amp; Man) &amp; al&s;o Chri&s;t within us, (as he is God the Eternal Word) was to preach two Chri&s;ts?</Q> which <HI>William Stockdale,</HI> one of their chief Preachers did accu&s;e me of, and which they could never be drawn to condemn. And whether my a&s;&s;erting, <Q>That the Light within men was not &s;ufficient to Salvation without &s;omething el&s;e, was an Error, and a Denyal of the Fundamental Principle of Truth;</Q> which <HI>Thomas Fitzwater,</HI> another of their chief Preachers accu&s;ed me of. And after that, <HI>John D' Lavall,</HI> one of their Magi&s;trates and a Preacher, did pub|lickly in the Bank-Meeting on a fir&s;t Day of the week, at <HI>Phila|delphia,</HI> accu&s;e me of being guilty of <HI>Here&s;ie,</HI> for a&s;&s;erting, That the Light within every man was not &s;ufficient to Salvation with|out <HI>&s;omething el&s;e.</HI> By that [&s;omething el&s;e] I oft told them, I meant the Manhood of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, and his Death and Pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And at that very Meeting it was, where <HI>Samuell Jenings</HI> told the Auditory, The Que&s;tion betwixt the Quakers and Me, was not, <HI>Who was the be&s;t Chri&s;tian?</HI> but, <HI>Who was the be&s;t Quaker?</HI> Of this divers now living in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> can give Evi|dence; as al&s;o, how at a Monthly Meeting in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> I hap|pened to &s;peak concerning the <HI>Principles</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Truth, <HI>Alexander <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eard&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y,</HI> one of their chief Elders, took me up, and &s;aid, <Q>I know not what thou means by [Principles] of Truth; for my part (&s;aid he) I never know any Principle of Truth but One, and that One was the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight within.</HI></Q> O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this, I can pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nt, if

required, produce Witne&s;&s;es, men of good credit at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> who heard him at that very Meeting.</P>
<P>What I have either by Word or Writing a&s;&s;erted of the Uni|ver&s;al nece&s;&s;ity of the Faith and Knowledge of Chri&s;ts Death and Sufferings, I have always done with that care and caution, by my frequent and oft repeated Explanations of my &s;ence, that I have both the Authority of Scripture, and the con&s;ent of not only the able&s;t Divines of the Church of England, and the 11th, 12th &amp; 13th Articles of the Church of England, but al&s;o of all other Prote&s;tant Churches [as with re&s;pect to adult per&s;ons, and &s;uch as are capable of actual faith and knowledge of Chri&s;t, which Infants and Idiots that have not the exerci&s;e of right Rea&s;on, are not] on my &s;ide.</P>
<P>Pag. 2 of his Preface, he &s;aith, <Q>In a private Meeting at <HI>Phi|ladelphia,</HI> in the year 1691. he heard me over and over vehe|mently pre&s;s the univer&s;al nece&s;&s;ity of Faith, after this manner, <HI>viz.</HI> I deny him to be a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, who doth not in the cour&s;e of his Mini&s;try preach Chri&s;t crucified without us, ri&s;en again without us, a&s;cended into Heaven without us; and not only &s;o (&s;aid he) but that the Faith and Knowledge of Chri&s;ts Sufferings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> without us, is univer&s;ally indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to all &amp; every one, in order to obtain eternal Life &amp; Salvation; and yet (&s;aid he) if an hone&s;t <HI>Indian</HI> or <HI>Heathen,</HI> &amp;c. do but live faith|ful to the Light within him, he could not mi&s;s of Salvation.</Q></P>

<P>After all his Sophi&s;tical In&s;inuations and Inferences again&s;t me about the <HI>Twelve Revolutions</HI> (to which <HI>I</HI> have &s;o fully an&s;wered in my former printed Books (as C.

And many &s;uch Ca&s;es might be in&s;tanced, none of which doth oppo&s;e the Attributes of the divine Wi&s;dom and Omnipotency; for when we &s;ay, God can do this or that, which his Wi&s;dom thinks not fit to do, we ab&s;tract, by a mental Ab&s;traction, from Gods &s;ecret Decrees, and al&s;o from his Revealed Will delivered us in the holy Scriptures, but re&s;pect|ing them, it is mo&s;t true, that God cannot any wi&s;e contradict his Will either &s;ecret or revealed.

And though it is not Gods Revealed Will to teach all Man|kind all that is needful to their Salvation, by any Light within them, without the holy Scriptures, or &s;ome outward Means of In&s;truction equivolent, yet we know not but &s;ome he may teach &s;o, as he taught <HI>Adam</HI> and the fir&s;t Prophets, who had none before them. Again, it is

one thing to &s;ay, God by his internal Word or Light can teach, or is &s;ufficient to teach Us and all Men what is Nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, if he had &s;o plea&s;ed; but we find he hath not been plea&s;ed &s;o to do; And it is far another thing to &s;ay, God or Chri&s;t in Men is &s;ufficient to Salva|tion without any thing el&s;e; for this placeth mens Salvation wholly upon God and Chri&s;t as within men, and wholly excludes the Manhood of Chri&s;t, and all that he hath done and &s;uffered for us, and his Medi|ation in Heaven, from being concerned in our Salvation, as any nece&s;|&s;ary cau&s;e thereof.

<P>But whereas C.

and being received, Overthrows the <HI>Chri&s;tian Faith.</HI> But his Argu|ment is a meer Sophi&s;m and Fallacy, and proves him as ignorant in true Logick, as he is in true Divinity&punc; for his Syllogi&s;m has four Terms in it, contrary to that Infallible Rule in true Logick, That every true Syllogi&s;m ought to have but three Terms, and each of the&s;e three terms ought to have but one Signification in both Propo&s;itions, other|wi&s;e the Terms are four, or more, and not three; whereas the middle term, <HI>That one God,</HI> in the fir&s;t Propo&s;ition, &s;ignifies the Father; but in the &s;econd Propo&s;ition it has another &s;ignification, and &s;ignifies the Son.

<Q><L>The One God is the Father, the Son and the holy Ghost.</L>

<P>Here it is evident, that <HI>the One God,</HI> in the fir&s;t Propo&s;ition, &s;ignifies all the Three, but in the &s;econd Propo&s;ition, it &s;ignifies only the Son; therefore, as I have &s;aid, the Syllogi&s;m hath four Terms, and is a meer Sophi&s;m and Fallacy.

He has charged me in his <HI>Proteus</HI> with &s;everal Contradiction, which only his Ignorance, a&s;&s;i&s;ted with his Malice, hath prompted him to do; for he little better under&s;tands the true nature and properties of a Contradiction than the Mill-&s;tones of his Mill do. But however &s;hort he is in true knowledge either in Na|turals or Spirituals, he as much abounds in Uncharitablene&s;s, and mo&s;t uncharitable and bitter Expre&s;&s;ions, notorious Fal&s;hoods, Lyes and Slanders, as is obvious to any that reads his Book. And I intend to give, at the end of this Treati&s;e, a Li&s;t of &s;ome of the mo&s;t notorious Fal&s;hoods in his Book, be&s;ide what are given already, and may further be given.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nineth Fundamental</HI> C. P. chargeth me to have varied in, <HI>Pro|teus,</HI> p. 18. is about the <HI>Re&s;urrection, That whereas formerly I deny<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the</HI>

<P>But this C.

<P>But to make it appear that I am a true Chri&s;tian, as really now as when under the Profe&s;&s;ion of a <HI>Quaker</HI> [and a much better Chri&s;tian now] it is generally agreed among all true Chri&s;tians, That the <HI>A|po&s;tles Creed,</HI> for the <HI>Simpliciter Credenda,</HI> contains all the Fundamentals of Faith; The <HI>Ten Commandments</HI> (re&s;pecting what is Moral in the fourth contain all the Fundamentals of Practice, for the <HI>Agenda;</HI> and the <HI>Lords Prayer,</HI> contains all the Fundamentals for Devotion and Wor&s;hip, being u&s;ed in Faith, and in the Name of our ble&s;&s;ed Medi|ator, and through him, by the help of the holy Spirit, in re&s;pect of the <HI>Pretenda;</HI> and all this I held &s;incerely when I was under the Pro|fe&s;&s;ion a <HI>Quaker,</HI> and endeavoured to practi&s;e accordingly, as well as to believe and wor&s;hip God and Chri&s;t in Truth and Reality.

<P>THere now remain only two things that I think material to clear, and after that to give the Li&s;t I promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>The one is, <HI>My charging the Quaker Magi&s;trates in</HI> Penn&s;ilvania <HI>to be guilty of Per&s;ecution, in their proceedings again&s;t me at</HI> Philadelphia, <HI>in the year</HI> 1692. and that not only a little, as their Fineing me five Pounds in their Court at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> for calling <HI>S. Jenings</HI> an <HI>Ignorant, Pre&s;ump|tuous and In&s;olent Man,</HI> and being <HI>too high &amp; impe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious in Worldly Courts,</HI> and which hath been &s;ufficiently known. Whereas much harder and more &s;evere Names were given by <HI>W. Penn</HI> to the Mayor of <HI>London</HI> and the Ju&s;tices at the Se&s;&s;ions in the <HI>Old Baily, London,</HI> above twenty years pa&s;t, as witne&s;s his and <HI>W. Mead<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> printed Tryal; which, to be &s;ure, neither W. P. nor any of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> judged a breach of any ju&s;t Law in him &s;o to do. And the like In&s;tances may be found in <HI>G. P.</HI>'s Journal, of giving more hard and &s;evere Names to &s;ome in Commi&s;&s;ion of the Peace in <HI>England;</HI> and if <HI>G. F</HI> had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ined for this, it would have been judged by the <HI>Quakers</HI> to be Per&s;ecution; and therefore was this of the <HI>Quakers</HI> again&s;t me, <HI>Per&s;ecution.</HI> But this was little to what I &s;hall hereafter &s;how.</P>
<P>After Twenty eight <HI>Quaker</HI> Preachers had given forth a formal Sen|tence of <HI>Excommunication</HI> again&s;t me at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> without any hear|ing, tryal or conviction, for my Oppo&s;ing their vile Errors,<HI>I</HI> appeal|ed to their next yearly Meeting, that was to be at <HI>Burlington</HI> in <HI>Septem|ber,</HI> 1692. which Appeal was printed, and many of them yet to be produced, which contained Twelve Queries, the foul la&s;t of which did &s;o offend the <HI>Quaker</HI> Magi&s;trates and Ju&s;tices, that they publi&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d a Proclamation again&s;t me, without all calling me before them, to con|vict

me, and cau&s;ed it to be publi&s;hed at the Market-place in <HI>Philadel|phia,</HI> 27 <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1692. and afterwards po&s;ted it up again&s;t me before <HI>S. Jening</HI>'s Door.</P>
<P>Now that the ground of this Offence may appear altogether Unju&s;t, upon the <HI>Quakers</HI> Principle, I will here &s;et down the &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of tho&s;e four Articles for which they pretended their Offence, and they are as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The Nineth Query,</P>
<P><HI>Whether the Twenty eight Judges had not done much better to have pa&s;t Judgment on &s;ome of their Brethren, who hired men to fight, and recover a Sloop (that was &s;tollen) by force of Arms, and &s;ome of them, being Ju&s;tices, gave a Commi&s;&s;ion &s;o to do?</HI></P>
<P>The Tenth Query.</P>
<P><HI>Whether to hire Men thus to fight, and al&s;o to provide the</HI> Indians <HI>with Powder and Lead to fight again&s;t other</HI> Indians, <HI>be not a manifest Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion of our</HI> (the Quakers) <HI>Principle again&s;t all &V;&s;e of the Carnal Sword and other carnal Weapons?</HI></P>
<P>The Eleventh Query.</P>
<P><HI>Whether it be according to the Go&s;pel, that Mini&s;ters &s;hould pa&s;s Sentence of Death on Malefactors, as &s;ome pretended Mini&s;ters here have done?</HI></P>
<P>The Twelfth Query.</P>
<P><HI>Whether there is any Example or Pre&s;ident for it in Scripture, or in all</HI> Chri&s;tendom, <HI>that Mini&s;ters &s;hould engro&s;s the Worldly Government, as they do here, which hath proved of a very ill Tendency?</HI></P>
<P>For the&s;e four above-&s;aid Querys, they gave out, as is &s;aid, their Proclamation again&s;t me, &s;igned by three of their Mini&s;ters, who were al&s;o Ju&s;tices, <HI>viz. Arthur Cook, Robert Ewer</HI> and <HI>Samuell Jenings,</HI> and other two, <HI>viz. Arthur Cook, Robert Ewer</HI> and <HI>Samuell Jenings,</HI> and other two, <HI>viz.

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That this Pro&s;ecution that they intended again&s;t us, was quite another thing than the Tryal that <HI>G. K.</HI> and <HI>T.

For what I writ, and we all &s;ix &s;igned, in the printed Sheet, called, <HI>An Appeal,</HI> was becau&s;e that we found that the <HI>Quakers</HI> who had hired men to fight, and did pa&s;s Sentence of Death on Malefactors, had tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed their own profe&s;&s;ed Principle, e&s;pecially as to fighting, which the <HI>Quakers</HI> generally have profe&s;&s;ed to deny, &s;o much as in Self-Defence, and con|&s;equently not to defend them&s;elves again&s;t <HI>Robbers</HI> and <HI>Murtherers</HI> by any Carnal Weapons, and therefore not by <HI>Gibbots</HI> or <HI>Gollows.</HI> And whatever our Adver&s;aries thought in the ca&s;e, it was a matter of Re|ligion to us, at that time, in no case to u&s;e a carnal Weapon.

<P>Pag. 11. He is as deceitful in ju&s;tifying W. P's gro&s;s and vile Error, &s;aying, <HI>Christ in us offereth up him&s;elf,</HI> and there he &s;tops, being, as &s;eems, a&s;hamed or afraid to &s;et down the whole Sentence, becau&s;e of the Un&s;oundne&s;s &amp; Offen&s;ivenes;s of it; whereas the whole Sentence is this, <HI>Chri&s;t in us doth offer up him&s;elf a living Sacrifice to God for us, by which the Wrath of God is appea&s;ed to us.</HI> The&s;e are the very words in <HI>W. P</HI>'s <HI>Rejoynder,</HI> pag. 284. Now there can be no Sacrifice that ap|pea&s;eth the Wrath of God towards Men, but that alone Sacrifice which was offered upon the Cro&s;s, and had his Blood &s;hed. But the <HI>Quakers</HI> have devi&s;ed an inward Sacrifice of Chri&s;t in men; who&s;e Blood is in|wardly &s;hed in them, to quench the Wrath of God, and who is crucified and buried in them. All which contradicts the holy Scripture, and is altogether derogating from Chri&s;t, that alone Propitiatory Sacrifice, when he offered him&s;elf upon the Cro&s;s, who, as he is the alone Sacrifice, &s;o was but once offered, and there is no other Sacrifice Propitiatory, but that alone that was offered without us; it being the nature of a Propitiatory Sacrifice, that properly and really it mu&s;t be &s;lain, and the Blood thereof &s;hed, which to affirm of any inward Sacrifice, is an overthrowing of the Chri&s;tian Faith, as much, if not more, than the Popi&s;h unbloody Sacrifice in the Ma&s;s.</P>
<P>Pag. 12. And as deceitful is C. P. to quote me to ju&s;tifie W.

<PB N="57" REF="001110_0061_0FB042DB19B14928">M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n to God, as the Sacrifice that was to be &s;lain was, and the Blood to be poured out. And C. P. is gro&s;&s;, deceitful to ask D. L. <HI>Doth he think that</HI> W. P. <HI>was &s;o weak to understand it of that Sacrifice without us on the Tree of the Cro&s;s? An&s;w</HI> D. L. did not &s;o think, but to under|&s;tand two Propitiatory Sacrifices, by way of Merit to attone for &s;in, is mo&s;t contrary to Scripture; for this inward Sacrifice is not only an|other from the outward, that W P. has &s;et up, but Manifold, even as many as there are Saints, at lea&s;t, and as many Chri&s;ts. Be&s;ide, no|thing could be Propitiatory Sacrifice for &s;in, but what was really Man. Now unle&s;s Chri&s;t be really M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, in all the Saints, and really &s;lain, and his Blood real &s;hed in them all, and multiplyed into as many Men, or Manhoods is, as Saints, it is impo&s;&s;ible that Chri&s;t &s;hould be a Propitiatory Sacrifice in Men. But the Sacrifice of Incen&s;e was not to attone nor pro|pitiate, nor was it to be any thing that could be &s;lain, or have Blood to be &s;hed, but did pre&s;uppo&s;e the Attonement already made, and that the Life and lively Breathings of the Spirit of Chri&s;t in the faithful, is as a &s;weet Incen&s;e before God, in that &s;ence as true and right Prayer and Thanks-giving is, that is &s;piritually performed, I &s;till a&s;&s;ert; but this doth nothing defend W. P<HI>'s</HI> vile Errors.</P>
<P>Now that neither W. P. nor G. W. did own Chri&s;t as he was out|wardly crucified, and his Blood outwardly &s;hed, to be a real and proper Sacrifice, Propitiatory, for &s;in, is evident from their words faithfully quoted in my <HI>first Narrative. W. Penn</HI> in his <HI>Chri&s;t. Quaker,</HI> p. 97, 98. fir&s;t Edition, &s;aith, <HI>One outward thing cannot be the proper figure or repre|&s;entation of another; nor is it the way of holy Scripture &s;o to teach us. The Outward Lamb &s;hews forth the inward Lamb.</HI> Here it is evident W.

Whitehead</HI> in his <HI>Light and Life,</HI> p. 56, denyeth that Blood whereby God did purcha&s;e his Church, <HI>Acts</HI> 20.28. to be outward Blood, but inward and &s;piritual. <HI>Now the Blood of God</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>or that Blood that rela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es to God, must needs be &s;piritual, he being a Spirit, and the Co|venant of God is inward and &s;piritual, and &s;o is the Blood of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Some Remarks,</HI> Pag. 2. C. P. alledgeth again&s;t <HI>D. Leeds, That he has altered the Terms of the Accu&s;ation about calling Chri&s;t, as Man,</HI> Finite <HI>and</HI> Impotent. <HI>Where</HI> (&s;aith C. P.) <HI>did I ever take or go about to take</HI> W. P. <HI>off from calling Chri&s;t, as Man,</HI> Finite <HI>and</HI> Impotent <HI>only?</HI> This &s;eems to me a free Confe&s;&s;ion of <HI>C. Pu&s;ey,</HI> That <HI>W. Penn</HI> did call our
<PB N="58" REF="001110_0062_0FB042DB1F5DA5D8">our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour <HI>Finite and Impotent,</HI> as Man, though not <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly,</HI> and I remember not that D. L. doth &s;o charge it with the word <HI>Only.</HI> Now though Chri&s;t, as Man, is <HI>Finite,</HI> as the be&s;t of created Beings are Finite; yet to call him <HI>Impotent, I</HI> think is very Unwarrantable and Irreverent, if not Bla&s;phemous. Chri&s;t indeed, &s;imply as Man, is not Omnipotent, yet it will not follow, that becau&s;e he is not <HI>Omnipotent,</HI> &s;imply as Man, that therefore he is <HI>Impotent;</HI> for it implyeth &s;ome great Defect or Imperfection: There is a mid&s;t betwixt <HI>Omnipotent</HI> and <HI>Impotent,</HI> viz <HI>Multipotent,</HI> and &s;uch our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, no doubt, was, even as Man, having all Power given him in Heaven and Earth. Be&s;ide, W. P<HI>'s</HI> fal&s;e and &s;ophi&s;tical Rea&s;oning in his <HI>Sandy Foundation,</HI> pag. 20, 21, <HI>That Chri&s;t neither did nor could &s;atisfie divine Ju&s;tice, either as God, or as Man, nor as God and Man,</HI> is a great undervaluing of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, and renders him (which is horrid think!) an Impotent Saviour; for without his making Satisfaction to the divine Law and Ju&s;tice, he could be no Saviour to Men; and yet <HI>W. Penn</HI> affirms he could not make Satisfaction <HI>as God, nor as Man, nor as God and Man.</HI> Its true, he could not make Satisfaction &s;imply <HI>as god,</HI> though the Rea&s;ons given by W. P. are not good, nor rightly &s;tated. The true Rea&s;on why he could not make Satisfaction, &s;imply <HI>as God,</HI> is, becau&s;e the Per&s;on who &s;hould make that Satisfaction behoved to &s;uffer and dye, that being the Penalty of the Law, for the &s;ins of Men; but had Chri&s;t been only God, he could not have dyed or &s;uffered, God being an infinite Spirit, and infinitely per|fect every way, without Body, Parts or Pa&s;&s;ions, according the fir&s;t Article of the <HI>Church of England.</HI> And it is also true, that Chri&s;t could not make that &s;atisfaction [<HI>As Man</HI> &s;imply] becau&s;e had he been meer Man, what he did or &s;uffered could not have been of full and &s;ufficient Value to make that Satisfaction which the Ju&s;tice of Gods Law required. But W. P<HI>'s</HI> rea&s;on why Chri&s;t could not &s;atisfie, as both God and Man, is extream weak and fal&s;e. His Rea&s;on is this, <Q>For where two Mediums (&s;aith he) or middle Propo&s;itions are &s;ingly inco&s;i&s;tent with the nature of the end, for which they are at fir&s;t propounded, their conjunction rather does augment than le&s;&s;en the difficulty of its accompli&s;h|ment. And this (he &s;aith) he is per&s;waded mu&s;t be obvious to every unbya&s;&s;ed Under&s;tanding.</Q></P>
<P><HI>I An&s;w.</HI> Fir&s;t, the words of his Argument are in very improper
<PB N="59" REF="001110_0063_0FB042DC2D448BF8">Terms, as <HI>two Mediums</HI> or <HI>middle Propo&s;itions,</HI> which in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e are neither Logical nor Grammatical, and far le&s;s Scriptural; for if he allude to a Syllogi&s;m, every true Syllogi&s;m can have but one Medium, and but one middle Propo&s;ition; and what other he means by two Mediums, or two middle Propo&s;ition; and what other he means by two Mediums, or two middle Propo&s;itions in the ca&s;e, as I do not under&s;tand, &s;o nor (as I think) can the be&s;t Univer&s;ity Scholar in <HI>Oxford</HI> or <HI>Cambridge;</HI> for to &s;ay the truth, being apply|ed to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, they are plain Non-&s;ence: for, who that ever was but ordinarily well &s;tudied in Divinity, did &s;ay or think that Chri&s;t, as both God and Man, are two Mediums or middle Propo&s;itions? The Scripture &s;aith, <Q>There is one God and one Mediator between God and Men, the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us:</Q> But this Mediator is both God and Man, and not two Medators, nor two Mediums. But if W.

<P>And as weak and impertinent are W. P<HI>'s</HI> Arguments again&s;t our Saviour's Satisfaction for our &s;ins, <HI>Sandy foundation,</HI> pag. 21. <Q>That mens &s;ins being not only again&s;t the Father and the holy Gho&s;t, but again&s;t the Son al&s;o, that therefore the Son mu&s;t be &s;atisfied; and who &s;hall &s;atisfie him?</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> It is granted, the &s;ins of men are again&s;t the whole Tri|nity, and the &s;atisfaction required and paid by the Son, as both God and Man, is, properly &s;peaking, made to the Ju&s;tice of the divine Law, which is the Law of the whole Trinity, which being infinitely Holy, would not &s;uffer their Holy Law to be tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ed, and the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion pardoned, without a due &s;atisfaction to the Ju&s;tice of the Law, that &s;o the Ju&s;tice of God, and his

<P>And, <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> as impertinent is his other Argument, <Q>That if man, or &s;uppo&s;e a Prince or King can pardon, without a &s;atis|faction any great Crime, as Murther, Rebellion, &amp;c. that therefore God doth pardon mens &s;ins without a &s;atisfaction to his Law:</Q> For, fir&s;t, &s;ome &s;ins, as willful Murther, Adultry, and the like hainous &s;ins ought not to be pardoned by the greate&s;t King on Earth, without &s;atisfaction to the Law of God; the &s;in of Murder requires Life for Life by Gods Law &s;till in force; nor was there any Sacrifice for tho&s;e hainous &s;ins under the Law, without due &s;atisfaction to the Law. Memorable is that Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Zaleucus</HI> the King of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ocreu&s;es,</HI> who would not pardon the Adultry com|mitted by his Son, without &s;atisfaction to the Law made by him|&s;slf, <HI>That who&s;oever committed Adultry &s;hould lo&s;e both Eyes;</HI> and that the &s;aid King &s;hould &s;hew him&s;elf ju&s;t as well as merciful, he took one Eye from his Son, and another Eye from him&s;elf, which fully &s;atisfied the Law; and which doth al&s;o partly re&s;emble the various &s;uffering of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, who &s;uffered for our &s;ins, the penalty due to us, in our vice and &s;tead, the Ju&s;t for the Un|ju&s;t.
