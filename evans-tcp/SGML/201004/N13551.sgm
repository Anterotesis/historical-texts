<HEAD>AN HISTORICAL NARRATIVE, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT came to pa&s;s in the Year 1740-41 that the Work of God, called the GREAT REFORMATION, took Place in New England, and &s;ome of the Southern Colonies (now States) with &s;urprizing Power and Ra|pidity: Va&s;t Numbers of People in a few Months Time were awakened out of Security. Ignorance and Formality, as to Matters of Religion, to &s;eek &s;piritual Knowledge, and to obtain an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t. This Concern &s;oon became general, and very pre&s;&s;ing on the Minds of Multitudes, and became the great Topic of Conver&s;ation and Enquiry.</P>
<P>THE Diver&s;ions and Vanities of People were in ge|neral laid a&s;ide, &s;uch as Tavern-haunting, Gaming, Dancing, Hor&s;e-racing, Chambering and Wantonne&s;s, with all foppi&s;h Parade of extravagant Dre&s;s, and gau|dy, wanton Appearance, were for&s;ook; and People in general, in a plain, mode&s;t Habit, devoted them&s;elves to attend all public Meetings, where it was expected that tho&s;e who were called powerful Preachers would perform divine Service: So that going Five or Six Miles on Foot to &s;uch Meetings was thought fea&s;ible. Private Meetings al&s;o, for Prayer, &s;inging P&s;alms, and Spiritual Songs, and for Exhortation, and Conver&s;a|tion, were frequently attended by Crouds of People.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="017115_0003_0FA02EEEF021EE10">
THE chief In&s;truments in leading on this Work, were Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> the <HI>Tenants, Belamy, Pomroy, Wheelock, Edwards, Buill, Cro&s;well, Jewit, Lord, Davinport, Finly, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THESE, with great Numbers more, went through all Parts of our Land, preaching the glad Tidings of the Go&s;pel; and where they were not received into Meeting Hou&s;es, they preached in the Fields. They preached as Me&s;&s;engers &s;ent from God, that felt, and believed the Importance of their Me&s;&s;age to our &s;inful, peri&s;hing World.</P>
<P>SUBORDINATE Means were various, be&s;ides Read|ing the Bible, and other good Books, which were di|ligently attended to; Exhortation by Mini&s;ters, and private Brethren was much practi&s;ed. Solemn and ear|ne&s;t Prayers were going up publicly, and privately: Elevated and devout &s;inging of P&s;alms and Hymns, not only in public, but in private Hou&s;es; and &s;ome|times when Numbers were travelling on the Road; the Conver&s;ation People had one with another, enqui|ring into each others Knowledge, Experience and Chri&s;tian Hope: Together with the Freedom and Ho|ne&s;ty, with which they communicated their Opinion, and Judgment, concerning them&s;elves, and tho&s;e they conver&s;ed with, had a powerful Tendency to awaken, convince, in&s;truct, or comfort one another.</P>
<P>THE Cries and Lamentations which &s;ome, and not a few, were making, being pricked in the Heart, &s;ur|prized and awakened Beholders; and al&s;o the Accla|mations of Prai&s;e to God, which &s;ome that had re|ceived
<PB N="5" REF="017115_0003_0FA02EEEF021EE10">Comfort; their Raptures of Joy and Expre&s;|&s;ions of the Love of God, and the exceeding Riches of his Grace towards Sinners; their Hope in Him, and their earne&s;t Longings, that others &s;hould <HI>"ta&s;te and &s;ee how Good the Lord is;"</HI> was greatly alarming to others. Only the &s;ight of the Multitude flocking to|gether to hear the Word preached, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the &s;olemn Countenance, the Tears, the Sighs, the earne&s;t Devo|tion of &s;ome, the grave and joyful Countenances of others, indicating their Complacency, and Delight in the Wor&s;hip, and Work of God; was enough to im|pre&s;s on the Minds of Beholders &s;ome Idea of the So|lemnity of the Judgment Day.</P>
<P>IN the Space of Two or Three Years, it was &s;up|po&s;ed, that Thirty or Forty Thou&s;and were converted in New England.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the Work met with Oppo&s;ition; and the Oppo&s;ers were proportionably Zealous, in their Op|po&s;ition, to the Zeal with which its Friends endea|voured to promote and carry it on.&mdash;The Controver&s;y was managed by all Orders of Men; every public Board, both Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, were racking their Invention to find out Ways and Means to em|barra&s;s and hinder the Work's going on; at lea&s;t to check the Di&s;order, as they call it.</P>
<P>WHILST the major Part were devi&s;ing, and u&s;ing &s;evere Mea&s;ures, the minor Part, being friendly to the Work, were u&s;ing their Influence to pacify the Oppo&s;ition; and to obtain Liberty of Con&s;cience, and the Right of private Judgment, in Matters of Religion, but with little Succe&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="017115_0004_0FA02EEFA6AF9850">
WITH Re&s;pect to the Work it&s;elf, and the Errors that attended it, both among its Friends and Foes, we refer the Reader to Pre&s;ident <HI>Edwards</HI>'s Book, in Vin|dication of the Work of God in tho&s;e Times.</P>
<P>HAVING hinted what Manner of Times the Great Reformation produced: We now proceed to point out the Con&s;titution and Practice of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Churches, of the Colony (now State) of Connecticut, as they were in tho&s;e Days.</P>
<P>THEIR Heads of Agreement, and Articles for the Admini&s;tration of Church Di&s;cipline, may be &s;een in their printed Platform, agreed upon by the Elders, and Me&s;&s;engers of the Churches, met by Delegation, at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">aybrook, September 9, 1708: Which Platform was pre&s;ented to the General A&s;&s;embly of &s;aid State; and by them approved and e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law. And to make it a practicable Sy&s;tem, the General A&s;&s;embly divided the whole Colony (now State) into eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Bodies, according to the Di&s;tricts of the Towns, or Societies; and Enacted, That &s;uch eccle&s;ia&s;tical So|ciety, qualifying them&s;elves according to Law, were empowered to manage and controul the Choice of Pa|ri&s;h Mini&s;ters, and the Supporting of them; and the Building of Meeting Hou&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> without any Provi|&s;ion for the Church's Liberty of Con&s;cience, or Refor|mation in Divine Service, but left them bound by pe|nal Laws.</P>
<P>THE Churches were in&s;eperably connected with the World, in this Con&s;titution, under a Prohibition of having any other Meeting, or Mini&s;ters in &s;aid Socie|ties, but &s;uch as were expre&s;sly allowed by Law. See old Law Book, Page 153&mdash;154.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="017115_0004_0FA02EEFA6AF9850">
THE Churches in general had tamely &s;ubmitted to this Con&s;titution; and had generally fallen into the Practice of admitting their Members, without requir|ing a credible Profe&s;&s;ion of their Faith, whereby they might be looked upon, in a Judgment of Charity, to be vi&s;ible Saints.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the printed Letter of the A&s;&s;ociation of Windham County, Page</HI> 23. <HI>"It is the Will of Chri&s;t, that all who make an out|ward, credible Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, &s;hould be admitted into the Church, though unconverted:&mdash;That they may be under proper Ordinances for their Conver&s;ion."</HI></NOTE> To which was added, a Cu&s;tom of admitting Per&s;ons to own a Covenant, and become half way Members (without any Profe&s;&s;ion of gracious Sincerity) that they and their Children might be bapti&s;ed.</P>
<P>IN this Situation the Churches in general carried on all Parts of external Wor&s;hip, Order, and Ordinances, according to Law, and Cu&s;tom afore&s;aid: Whil&s;t at the &s;ame Time the Government of the Churches in all Matters of Di&s;cipline (that were not by civil Law put into the Hands of the &s;aid Societies) were managed by the con&s;ociated Mini&s;ters, in the Manner pre&s;cribed in the afore&s;aid Saybrook Regulation, authori&s;ed by civil Law:&mdash;So that the Churches of Chri&s;t, as &s;uch, had no Place, Liberty, or Prerogative left.&mdash;And if the Churches had not been included in the Societies afore|&s;aid, one would have thought, that the Church of Chri&s;t had been con&s;idered as not of the World, but left at Liberty to wor&s;hip, and &s;erve God, according to the Chri&s;tian Law.&mdash;This was the general State of the Churches when the Great Reformation began.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="017115_0005_0FA02EF063D71450">
WHEN &s;ome Mini&s;ters began, not only to be very zealous in their Preaching; but to travel from Place to Place, preaching the Word with Power, and Mul|titudes flocking to hear them; which together with the Effects their Preaching had on the People, &s;oon alarmed the Attention of &s;ome, and the Envy of others; and became an Object of great Speculation, and Im|provement, as hath been de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>IN tho&s;e Times the General A&s;&s;embly of this State, made Laws to re&s;trict, and re&s;train the Liberties u&s;ed by Mini&s;ters, and People, in Matters of Religion.&mdash; To prevent Pari&s;h Mini&s;ters preaching out of their own Pari&s;hes, it was Enacted, That if any Pari&s;h Mi|ni&s;ter &s;hould preach in another Pari&s;h, without fir&s;t obtaining Liberty of the Mini&s;ter, and Two-Thirds of the Pari&s;h, he &s;hould be liable to loo&s;e his Salary for Two Years.</P>
<P>To prevent Mini&s;ters from other States travelling and Preaching in this, it was Enacted, That they &s;hould be taken up as Vagabonds, and tran&s;ported out of the State.
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>In Con&s;equence of this Act, Mr. Finly, afterwards Pre&s;ident of Jer&s;ey College, was taken up near New Haven, and tran&s;ported; but returned, and was taken up a &s;econd Time, together with Mr. Davenport, and bani&s;hed by Water to New York.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>To prevent any Man's preaching, however qualified, and called, if he was not authori&s;ed according to the expre&s;s Laws of the Con&s;titution, he &s;hould be liable to Fines, and Impri&s;onment.
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Old Law Book, Page</HI> 510, 511. <HI>In Con&s;equence of this Act, Numbers have been fined, and impri&s;oned, for preaching the Go&s;pel; and exhorting the People to the Duties of Chri&s;tianity, viz.&mdash; Me&s;&s;ieurs Eli&s;ha Paine, Solomon Paine, Thomas Mar&s;h, John Palmer, Ebenezer Frothingham, and others.</HI></NOTE></P>

<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Law of the State expre&s;sly forbid any Meeting Hou&s;e to be built, or Meeting to be held for Religious Wor&s;hip, without Li|berty fir&s;t obtained of the General A&s;&s;embly, upon Penalty, &amp;c.</HI></NOTE></P>

<P>THE reforming Mini&s;ters, and Churches, were treated as departing from the Faith, and Order of the Go&s;pel: As corrupting the Word, and perverting the Truth, and turning the World up &s;ide down; and therefore rendered them&s;elves unfit for Communion, Li|berty of Con&s;cience, or Toleration.</P>

<HEAD>Some OBSERVATIONS on the SEPARATION; and the SEPARATE, or STRICT CONGREGATIONAL CHURCHES.</HEAD>
<P>THE Con&s;titution, and Practice of the E&s;tabli&s;h|ed Churches, being as has been de&s;cribed; Num|bers in various Parts of this State, did di&s;cent, and &s;eperate them&s;elves from the Communion of the &s;aid &s;tanding Churches, and gathered them&s;elves into Churches, to carry on the Wor&s;hip of God, and Church Di&s;cipline, according as they under&s;tood the Word of God: Acknowledging no other but God alone, to have Right to pre&s;cribe Rules for Divine Wor&s;hip; or ordering the Di&s;cipline of his Church.</P>
<P>We according to our Judgment, looked upon the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution of this State, and the Tradi|tions thereof, to be a great Departure from the Order of the Apo&s;tolick Churches, as well as from the Plat|form of our Fore Father's in this Land. And although they were called, and importuned to take &s;ome Step for Reformation, they refu&s;ed, and ju&s;tified them&s;elves in their Con&s;titution, and Practice. Here we judged it nece&s;&s;ary, and become our Duty to withdraw from their Fellow&s;hip, and Communion; &s;o far as they had departed from the Rule of God's Word.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="017115_0006_0FA02EF12B1EF890">
THE Church in Canterbury, that had been a Con|gregational-Church from its fir&s;t beginning, after a long and tedious Labour, in oppo&s;ing the Society, with a minor Part of the Church, from &s;ettling Mr. Cog&s;well among them; withdrew from the Socities Meeting-Hou&s;e, and &s;et up the Wor&s;hip of God in a private Hou&s;e. This was &s;ome time in the Year 1744. And on the 9th of October, 1745, a new Seperate, or Strict Congregational Church, was gathered in Man&s;|field, in the County of Windham, con&s;i&s;ting of Mem|bers collected from &s;everal adjacent Towns. The Manner, in which they formed them&s;elves into a vi&s;i|ble Church, was this; they gave a verbal Relation to each other, of their Experience, of a Work of Grace upon their Souls, to the Satisfaction of each other; a &s;pecial Re&s;pect being had to the Fruits of Grace, that di&s;cover them&s;elves in the Lives and Conver&s;ation of &s;uch as are truly godly, or gracious Per&s;ons: And al&s;o &s;ub&s;cribed to Articles of Faith, and Practice, and in Church Covenant, that had been previou&s;ly drawn up, and in their Opinion, agreeable to the Word of God.</P>
<P>AFTER the Church was thus gathered, and covenant|ed together, they proceeded to the Choice of Mr. Thomas Mar&s;h for their Pa&s;tor; who had &s;u&s;tained the Office of a Deacon, for many Years, in the Church in the Second Society, in Windham: And appointed his Ordination to be on June 6th, 1746. But Mr. Mar&s;h was &s;eized by an Officer, the Day before he was to have been ordained, for Preaching the Go&s;pel &s;ome Time before, without Licence from the e&s;tabli&s;hed Mini&s;ters of the Con&s;titution, and confined in Wind|ham
<PB N="12" REF="017115_0007_0FA02EF275220D00">Gaol, where he was confined in Pri&s;on, until the Sitting of the County Court in June following. The Church, therefore, by the Advice of Mr. Mar&s;h, cho&s;e, and <HI>ordained</HI> Mr. <HI>John Hovey,</HI> to be their Pa&s;tor, or teaching Elder, in the Month of February, 1746; a Man of approved Abilities among them. This was the <HI>fir&s;t Ordination,</HI> among the Strict Congregational Churches,&mdash;and was performed in the following Man|ner, viz. The Church cho&s;e Three Brethren, out of their own Number:
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Note,&mdash;One of the Three, Mr. Thomas Deni&s;on, had been li|couced, and recommended by &s;ome of the &s;tanding Mini&s;ters, as a man qualified to preach the Go&s;pel: Had al&s;o been ordained Pa&s;tor of a Bapti&s;t Church in A&s;hford, by the Rev. Dr. Thomas Green, of Dorce&s;ter, and the Rev. Ebenezer Moulten, of Brimfield.</HI></NOTE> Men of approved Gifts, and A|bilities, to per&s;onate the Church, as their Pre&s;bytery, in ordaining Mr. Hovey to the pa&s;toral Office over them.</P>

<P>OUR fir&s;t withdraw from the e&s;tabli&s;hed Churches, was much like I&s;rael's coming out of Egypt, a mixed Multitude came out al&s;o; and &s;erved to an&s;wer the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, i. e. to be a Trouble and Vexation to us, and to bring a Reproach and Scandal upon the Work of God.&mdash;There was much ra&s;h and party Zeal that appeared in many, which occa&s;ioned &s;harp and unchri&s;tian Contentions; whereby the Cau&s;e of Truth and Meekne&s;s &s;uffered greatly. We lament the Mi&s;|&s;teps
<PB N="13" REF="017115_0007_0FA02EF275220D00">in Doctrine, and Practice, that marked our Pro|ceedings in many In&s;tances, while we were aiming, (in our infant State) to know and walk in the right Way of the Lord. Many that appeared forward in the Seperation fell into notorious, &s;candalous Sins:&mdash; Others there were that ran into Errors and Extremes, in Matters of Religion; holding to an ab&s;olute Know|ledge of the Brethren, upon an invi&s;ible Evidence, as they called it.&mdash;Others there were that made <HI>Faith, Con&s;cience,</HI> and <HI>Good Feeling</HI> in Religion, their Rule of Duty, and did not pay that Honor to the revealed Will of God, in his Word, as they ought to have done.&mdash; Some there were that held that Church Di&s;cipline might be proceeded in without vi&s;ible Evidence to prove Facts alledged.&mdash;Some held that Mini&s;ters ought to have no previous Study before Preaching; but that they ought to have their Sermons immediately from God.&mdash;Others there were that &s;eemed to &s;trike at the Foundation of civil Government, to overthrow it en|tirely; and were for de&s;troying human Learning, and even human Rea&s;on it&s;elf, as u&s;ele&s;s in Religion; and were for introducing unqualified Per&s;ons into the Mi|ni&s;try, upon the Belief, that their Qualifications were in Heaven, and would be &s;ent down when they needed them.</P>
<P>WE have &s;een the Mi&s;chiefs that have taken Place among the Churches of our Profe&s;&s;ion and Connec|tions; where they have thought their Knowledge, and Di&s;cernment of &s;piritual Things, was great, and infallible, being the Dictates of the Spirit of God, by Impul&s;es or Sugge&s;tions (whether by a Medium or not) which is a Kind of Evidence, or Knowledge, too

<P>THUS we have given a brief hi&s;torical Relation of Events, of a religious Nature, that have taken place in the State of Connecticut, in particular, as well as tho&s;e that have been of a more general Nature, abroad
<PB N="17" REF="017115_0009_0FA02EF3A9FB6FC0">in our Land. And here we would take Occa&s;ion, to <HI>de|clare</HI> our Sentiment in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> Things, wherein we have been wrongfully repre&s;ented, to our great Injury. And</P>
<P>FIRST. It hath been generally received among Peo|ple, that we have embraced &s;ome new Opinions, both with Re&s;pect to Faith and Practice. But that the World of Mankind may be undeceived in this Affair, we &s;ay, that notwith&s;tanding, there hath been many Errors, among tho&s;e that have been called Seperates, as hath been before related; yet as Churches, we have ever acknowledged We&s;tmin&s;ter Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith; and Cambridge Platform of Church Di&s;cipline, as to the Sub&s;tance of them (&s;ome few Things excepted) to or|thodox Sy&s;tems of Faith, and Practice, as in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> may appear. Yet after all, we hold no Creeds, or Confe&s;|&s;ions of Faith, to be binding upon us, any farther than they agree with the Word of God, contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Te&s;taments.</P>
<P>SECOND. We have been repre&s;ented, as holding to an ab&s;olute Knowledge of the Brethren; and that we admit none into our Churches, but &s;uch as we know to be real Saints. Therefore we &s;ay, notwith&s;tanding there has been Per&s;ons of our Profe&s;&s;ion, that have held to ab&s;olute Knowledge of the Brethren, as hath been related: Yet as Churches we are &s;o far from pre|tending to know the good E&s;tate of one another's Souls <HI>ab&s;olutely,</HI> that we do not &s;uppo&s;e it even Nece&s;&s;ary, in the Admi&s;&s;ion of Members to our Communion, that we mu&s;t certainly know, that they are truly god|ly, or gracious Per&s;ons. Yet it hath ever been our Opinion, that unconverted, or unregenerate Per&s;ons,
<PB N="18" REF="017115_0010_0FA02EF44A927B60">have no Right to Member&s;hip in the Church of Chri&s;t &s;o as to be admitted to the &s;pecial Ordinances of the Go&s;pel. That for a Per&s;on to feel in him&s;elf, a Right before God, to Member&s;hip in his vi&s;ible Church, it is nece&s;&s;ary, that he be well &s;atisfied in his own Mind, that his Heart is di&s;po&s;ed to <HI>Love, Fear,</HI> and <HI>&s;erve God.</HI> That upon the be&s;t Evidence, or Judgment he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> of him&s;elf, he hath been made a Partaker of this <HI>Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> that the Word of God holds forth as Nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation. That the&s;e Things are what he is to make Profe&s;&s;ion, or Confe&s;&s;ion of, before the Church; as well as a general Belief of the Go&s;pel, and a Subjection to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>NOW in order for a Church to receive a Per&s;on into Member&s;hip, it is Nece&s;&s;ary, that they be well &s;atisfied of the Truth and Reality of what he profe&s;&s;es to have; and the mo&s;t proper Means to be attended to, in Or|der to obtain a Satisfaction, is to examine the Per&s;on, into his Knowledge of his lo&s;t and undone E&s;tate by Nature; and of the Way of Salvation through a Re|deemer; and of the Exerci&s;es of his Heart towards God: And al&s;o to con&s;ider and view the Life, and Conver&s;ation of the Per&s;on in the World. In which Things, if the Church be &s;atisfied, they have good Right to extend their Charity to &s;uch an One, as a real Di&s;ciple of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, without pretending to an ab|&s;olute Knowledge, of the good E&s;tate of his Soul.</P>
<P>THIRD. It hath been generally received, that we hold, that every Brother in the Church, hath a Right to <HI>preach, pray,</HI> and <HI>exhort</HI> publickly in the Church.
<PB N="19" REF="017115_0010_0FA02EF44A927B60">Now to &s;et this Affair in a true Light, we &s;ay, that we believe it to be the Duty of all profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians, to let their Light &s;hine in the World, &s;o that their Life, and Conver&s;ation, might be one continued Preach|ment to others: But that every Brother hath a Right to &s;et up to be a Publick Teacher, or Exhorter in the Church, we deny. It is our Opinion, that all tho&s;e Brethren in a Church, that have Gifts given them, that are for the Edification of the Church, ought to be improved in the Church, in their proper Place; and to be &s;ubject to the Government and Direction of the Church. And in order that a Church may know the Gifts they have among&s;t them, it is nece&s;&s;ary that there be an open Door for the Proof, and Trial of tho&s;e Gifts that they have; and when the Church has made Proof and Trial of the Gifts, and Abilities of any one Brother, and find them to be for the Edification of the Church; then the Church ought to approve of them, by giving them their Fellow&s;hip, or Ap|probation to improve their Gi&s;ts among them, and to recommend them to the Acceptance of others. &mdash;And this we apprehend is a &s;ufficient Licence, for any Man to preach, as a Candidate for the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try. And as to our Opinion of the Ordination of Church Officers, &s;ee our Heads of Agreement.</P>
<P>FOURTH. We have been traduced, as being a Sect of Profe&s;&s;ors, that &s;ay to all other Denominations of Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ors, <HI>&s;tand by your&s;elves, for we are more Holy than you.</HI></P>
<P>THEREFORE, to &s;et this Matter in a true Light, we &s;ay, that in order for Communion among Churches,
<PB N="20" REF="017115_0011_0FA02EF4E142A9E8">as Churches of Chri&s;t, it is nece&s;&s;ary, that the Church|es &s;o communing, ought to make the Chri&s;tian Pro|fe&s;&s;ion; without which no Body, or Society of Peo|ple, can properly be &s;aid to be a vi&s;ible Church of Chri&s;t. That the Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion principally con|&s;i&s;ts, <HI>in a profe&s;&s;ed Heart Subjection to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as their rightful Lord and Sovereign, to be ruled, and go|verned by his Law pre&s;cribed in his Word.</HI> Now we conclude, that a Profe&s;&s;ion of Heart Subjection to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his Law, includes in it, a Profe&s;&s;ion of being Friends to Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and a Profe&s;&s;ion of being Friends to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, includes in it a Profe&s;|&s;ion of being <HI>regenerated or born again.</HI> Therefore all &s;uch as call them&s;elves Churches of Chri&s;t, and do not make the above Profe&s;&s;ion, cannot properly be &s;aid to be vi&s;ible Churches of Chri&s;t. Neither is it po&s;&s;ible in the Nature of Things, to make a Per&s;on, a vi&s;ible Member of a vi&s;ible Church of Chri&s;t, &s;o long as he, or &s;he, profe&s;s them&s;elves to be in a State of unrege|neracy. Therefore, we &s;uppo&s;e, that we have no Scrip|ture Warrant, to hold Communion in &s;pecial Ordinan|ces, with &s;uch Churches, as profe&s;s that Faith, and Repentance, are not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to qualify Per&s;ons for Member&s;hip in Chri&s;t's Church; and a Profe&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ary, in order to their be|ing admitted, as Members in his vi&s;ible Church.</P>
<P>BUT as their is a Number of Churches in this State, that we have before mentioned, that are called Stand|ing Churches, that are di&s;intangled from the Law e&s;tabli&s;hed Con&s;titution; and make the Chri&s;tian Pro|fe&s;&s;ion as above &s;aid, and practice accordingly; with all &s;uch Churches we could freely hold Communion,
<PB N="21" REF="017115_0011_0FA02EF4E142A9E8">although they may differ from us in &s;ome Things re|&s;pecting Church Di&s;cipline, that are of a le&s;&s;er Moment. And as there has been of late, a Pamphlet, publi&s;hed by the Pre&s;bytery of <HI>Morris County,</HI> intitled "A View of a Chri&s;tian Church, and Church Government." We take this Method to declare our Approbation of &s;aid Book, in all tho&s;e Things that are e&s;&s;ential to the Be|ing of a vi&s;ible Church; though there are &s;ome Things in &s;aid Book, re&s;pecting Church Government, that are of a &s;ubordinate Nature, that we are not &s;o well agreed in; yet we &s;ee no ju&s;t Cau&s;e, why we could not freely hold Communion, with Churches formed on &s;uch a Plan, as is therein de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>AND as to our Bapti&s;t Brethren, we are free to hold occa&s;ional Communion, with &s;uch as are regular Churches, and make the Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion as above &s;aid; and acknowledge us to be Bapti&s;ed Churches, and own the Morality of the Ten Commands of the Decalogue.</P>

<P>THE Overtures, Alterations, and Reformations, that have taken Place in the Churches, &s;ince the Great Reformation, and of our Seperation, with re&s;pect to Exertions to &s;upport, and maintain the E&s;tabli&s;hed Con&s;titution, are &s;uch, that the <HI>young</HI> and <HI>ri&s;ing Gene|ration,</HI> could form no ju&s;t Idea of the Rea&s;ons we had,
<PB N="22" REF="017115_0012_0FA02EF5AB153490">for our di&s;&s;enting from the E&s;tabli&s;hed Churches, with|out &s;ome &s;uch Means of Knowledge; nor what Series of Events, hath brought &s;o many of the Mini&s;ters, and Churches, from &s;o wide a Breach, to be &s;o unit|ed and agreed, both in Doctrine and Practice, as they now appear to be. It may be ju&s;tly &s;aid, it is the Lord's Doings, and it is marvelous in our Eyes; how the Lord hath wrought to make Breaches in the &s;trong Holds of Tradition, formed by Civil, or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Powers, joining to e&s;tabli&s;hed Uniformity in Religion, and to e&s;tabli&s;h it by Power. And on the other Hand, how he hath defeated the Wiles of the Devil, who came forth as an Angel of Light, declaring for Liber|ty, and Spirituality, ca&s;ting out a Flood of Delu&s;ions, and damnable Here&s;ies, by which many have been de|filed, and the Way of Truth, evil &s;poken of, and the hone&s;t Inquirer at a lo&s;s to know what to think, or which Way to walk.</P>
<P>MANY of us yet alive, having been Eye Witne&s;&s;es of the&s;e Things, have thought it our Duty to declare them, for the Glory of God, for the Comfort and E&s;|tabli&s;hment of the Church; and for the In&s;truction, and Improvement of the pre&s;ent and ri&s;ing Genera|tion.</P>
<P>WE offer in Vindication of our Conduct, in &s;eperat|ing from the E&s;tabli&s;hed Churches, as followeth, viz. The Grounds of our having Scruples of Con&s;cience, to continue in their Fellow&s;hip, and Communion, hath been already declared, in the De&s;cription given of the Con&s;titution, and Practice of the E&s;tabli&s;hed Churches in tho&s;e Times.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="017115_0012_0FA02EF5AB153490">
FOR any One to withdraw, from the Communion of a Church he had covenanted with, when there was no &s;ufficient Grounds for Scruples of Con&s;cience in conti|nuing:&mdash;Or to &s;eparate abruptly, without u&s;ing pro|per Means to have his Scruples removed, or Cau&s;es of Grief redre&s;&s;ed:&mdash;Or from a contentious, &s;chi&s;matical Spirit, would be &s;inful and di&s;orderly Walking.</P>
<P>BUT when there are ju&s;t Cau&s;es for Scruples; and due Pains have been taken to remove them; and it cannot be obtained, withdrawing becomes prudent, and nece&s;|&s;ary, for Two Rea&s;ons:&mdash;<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By continuing he mu&s;t give Fellow&s;hip to an Act of Wor&s;hip, which in his own View is contrary to the Will of God; and there|by his Con&s;cience be defiled:&mdash;<HI>Second,</HI> It would be &s;in|ful Neglect of &s;erving God, in the Manner he in his own Con&s;cience believes he ought to do.</P>
<P>FOR a more full Explication, and to &s;how that our Separation was not a new and unju&s;tifiable Proceedure, we would refer the Reader to the Preface of Cambridge Platform:&mdash;The whole Spirit and Argument of which ju&s;tifies our Conduct. They, under a Fifth Particular <HI>cite</HI> a Pa&s;&s;age from Dr. <HI>Ames</HI> in his 4th Book, Con|&s;cience, Chap. 14, N^o. 16.&mdash;"If any Man (&s;aith he) wronged with unju&s;t Vexation, or providing for his own Edification, or in Te&s;timony again&s;t Sin, depart from a Church where &s;ome Evils are tolerated, and join him&s;elf to another more Pure, yet without con|demning the Church he leaveth; he is not therefore to be held as a Schi&s;matick, or as guilty of any other Sin." The Preface explains him, and &s;ays, "When either through wearine&s;s of unju&s;t Vexation, or in Way of Pro|vi&s;ion

<P>As to our publi&s;hing Heads of Agreement, re&s;pect|ing the Prerogatives, and Di&s;cipline of Chri&s;t's Church; we look upon it both U&s;eful and Nece&s;&s;ary, in order to the Fellow&s;hip of Churches, that they may exerci&s;e Charity, and Acts of Fellow&s;hip, one towards another, as Occa&s;ion may &s;erve, with better Judgment, Sati&s;|faction and Comfort. It al&s;o may be u&s;eful to particu|lar Churches, for their greater Agreement in Under|&s;tanding uniform and harmonious Proceedings, with re&s;pect to Order, Ordinances, Wor&s;hip, and Di&s;cipline in the Church. Notwith&s;tanding it can make nothing right, or binding, but what is made &s;o by the Word of God. Hence it can Amount to no more, and is only an Expre&s;&s;ion of our Judgment of the Rule of God's Word.</P>
<P>OUR acknowledging the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, agreed upon by the Synod at Bo&s;ton, May 12, 1680, and the longer, and &s;horter Chatechi&s;ms, agreed upon by the A&s;&s;embly of Divines at We&s;tmin&s;ter; &s;hows that we are of the &s;ame Faith of our Prote&s;tant Brethren.

<HEAD>HEADS OF AGREEMENT, Entered into by a Number of STRICT CONGREGATIONAL CHURCHES, convened, by Delegation, at KILLINGLY, Sept. 19, 1781.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. Of a Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith.</P>
<P>WE agree to the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, agreed upon by the Synod at Bo&s;ton, May 12, 1680, and to the longer and &s;horter Catechi&s;ms, agreed upon by the A&s;&s;embly of Divines at We&s;tmin&s;ter, as orthodox Sy&s;|tems of the Doctrines of the Chri&s;tian Religion, as to the Sub&s;tance of them. Ever holding the Word of God, contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Te&s;taments, to be the only perfect Rule of Faith and Practice.</P>
<P N="2">II. OF the Church in general,</P>
<P>THAT the Word Church, is u&s;ed to &s;ignify the whole Body of the Elect, or Saints, both in Heaven, and Earth, who are united in Chri&s;t as their Head, and by one Spirit bapti&s;ed into one Body, that is the Body of Chri&s;t, Heb. 12, 22, 23.</P>
<P N="3">III. OF the Catholic vi&s;ible Church.</P>
<P>THERE is a Catholic vi&s;ible Church, viz. The Company of tho&s;e who profe&s;s the Chri&s;tian Faith, whether in Church Order or not; but there is no Po|litical Catholic Church, the State of the Members of the vi&s;ible Church, &s;ince the coming of Chri&s;t, being only Congregational.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="26" REF="017115_0014_0FA02EF74E221290">
IV. OF a particular Congregational Church.</P>
<P>A Congregational Church is a Part of the vi&s;ible Church, con&s;i&s;ting of a Company of Saints, by Calling, making a credible Profe&s;&s;ion of their Faith, and Re|pentance; united in one Body by an holy Covenant, for the Wor&s;hip of God, and an Obedience to him in all his Ordinances and In&s;titutions; and for the mutual Edification one of another, in the Fellow&s;hip of the Lord Je&s;us: As to its Quantity it ought not to be of greater Number than may ordinarily meet together conveniently in one Place, nor fewer than may conve|niently carry on Church Work. Any One that joins to &s;uch a Church, mu&s;t be bapti&s;ed, profe&s;s Religion, &s;atisfy the Church of the Credibility of their Profe&s;&s;ion; and covenant to walk with the Church, in the Ob&s;er|vance of all Go&s;pel Ordinances.</P>

VI. OF the Exerci&s;e of Church Power.</P>
<P>THE Church of Chri&s;t exerci&s;eth her Power or Privilege. 1&s;t. By admitting her own Members. 2dly. By admoni&s;hing her Members in Ca&s;e of Sin, and by excommunicating them in Ca&s;e they become incorri|gible in their Wickedne&s;s. 3dly. By chu&s;ing and or|daining her own Officers (Need &s;o requiring) and in removing them from their Offices, in Ca&s;e of For&s;eiture.</P>
<P N="7">VII. OF Church Officers.</P>
<P>THAT there is two Offices appointed by Chri&s;t in his Church, viz. Bi&s;hops, and Deacons. The Words Bi&s;hop, Elder, Pa&s;tor, or Teacher, we under&s;tand to be &s;o many Names for the &s;ame Office. In the Choice of Pa&s;tors, or Teachers, &s;pecial Re&s;pect ought to be had to their Qualifications, as de&s;cribed in the Word of God, viz. Tho&s;e Gifts and Virtues which the Scriptures requireth in Men that are to be elected into &s;uch Places. That Elders mu&s;t be blamele&s;s, &s;ober, apt to Teach, and endued with &s;uch other Qualifications as are laid down, 1 Tim. 3.2. Tit. 1.6&mdash;9. Deacons to be qualified as directed Acts 6.3.1 Tim. 3 8&mdash;11.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. OF the Ordination of Church Officers.</P>
<P>ORDINATION is the putting a Per&s;on into the Place that he had a Right to before, by Election. In the Ordination of Pa&s;tors, or Elders, we judge it expedient that Impo&s;ition of Hands be performed by ordained El|ders, if it can be obtained: But if not, it may be done by &s;ome of the Brethren, appointed thereunto by the Church.
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>This was the Opinion of our Fore-Fathers. See Hutchin&s;on's Hi&s;tory, Page</HI> 433, <HI>and al&s;o their Practice, Page</HI> 425.</NOTE> Deacons al&s;o ought to be put into Office
<PB N="28" REF="017115_0015_0FA02EF7E0146700">by Prayer, and &s;ome public Te&s;timony given by the Church.</P>
<P>AFTER all the Debates that has been about the Right of Ordination, we can freely join with the Opinion of the Pre&s;bytery of Morris County, viz. "When we con&s;ider the Nature of Ordination, and the Right each Church has to choo&s;e their own Officers, it will appear, that it is not e&s;&s;ential by whom they are introduced, af|ter they are elected, and have accepted the Call of the Church."</P>
<P N="9">IX. How Churches &s;hould proceed in Church Go|vernment.</P>
<P>THAT in Order to a Church's exerci&s;ing that Power, or Privilege, that is radically in them as a Church, it is Nece&s;&s;ary in Churches not furni&s;hed with proper Officers, that they appoint &s;ome proper Per&s;on to pre&s;ide in Church Meetings, as Moderator, to lead the Church in tho&s;e Affairs that may lye before them; but when a Church hath &s;upplied it&s;elf with proper Officers, &s;uch as Pa&s;tor, or Deacon, or Deacons, it is the proper Work of a Pa&s;tor to lead in the Church, in all Matters of Church Government: But if the Pa&s;tor be di&s;abled through Sickne&s;s or otherwi&s;e, from attending to his Duty in this Re&s;pect; or willfully refu&s;e when de&s;ired by the Church, it appears mo&s;t rea&s;onable that it is the Deacon's Duty to lead as Mo|derator in Matters of Church Government.

X. OF the Work and Duty of Pa&s;tors and Deacons.</P>
<P>FIRST, Of the Pa&s;tors Work and Duty.&mdash;It appears that it is not only the Pa&s;tors Work and Duty to pre|&s;ide in Matters of Church Government; but al&s;o to feed the Flock with Knowledge and Under&s;tanding: This appears of great Importance in the Di&s;charge of their Duty, that they rightly divide the Word of Truth, and give to every one a Portion in due Sea&s;on. The Teaching and Preaching the Word of God is an Ordinance of his own appointing; and is a &s;pecial Means in the Hand of the Spirit, for the Conviction and Conver&s;ion of Sinners; and of building up the Saints, in their mo&s;t holy Faith. Therefore, the Apo&s;|tle gives it in Charge to Timothy, 2 Epi&s;. c. 4. v. 2. "Preach the Word." Tit. 2.1. "But &s;peak thou the Things, which become &s;ound Doctrine." Wherefore, it appears to us e&s;&s;ential to the Well-being of a Church that they be well provided with a &s;ound, orthodox Mini&s;try, among them.&mdash;Pa&s;tors &s;hould guide and con|duct the Flock, in the Paths of Truth and Duty.&mdash; Pa&s;tors &s;hould watch for and over the Flock, Heb. 13.17. &mdash;Pa&s;tors &s;hould warn the Flock of Danger from the World, from Satan, and from the Corruptions of their own Hearts.&mdash;Pa&s;tors &s;hould admini&s;ter the Seals unto the Flock, &s;uch as Bapti&s;m, and the Lord's Sup|per.&mdash;Pa&s;tors &s;hould pray for the Flock, and ble&s;s the Flock in the Name of the Lord.&mdash;Pa&s;tors &s;hould pity the Flock, and carry it gently and meekly towards them.&mdash;Pa&s;tors &s;hould keep up a good Opinion of, and have an high E&s;teem of the Flock; and &s;hould &s;uit their Di&s;cour&s;es to the &s;everal. Circum&s;tances and Capacities of the Flock.&mdash;In a Word, Pa&s;tors &s;hould
<PB N="30" REF="017115_0016_0FA02EFBD9671510">in all Things approve them&s;elves the Mini&s;ters of God, 2 Cor 3.2.</P>
<P>SECOND, Of the Work and Duty of Deacons.&mdash; The Work and Duty of Deacons in the Church, ap|pears mo&s;t plain to us in the Scriptures, to be an A&s;|&s;i&s;tant to the Mini&s;try; and that it is not altogether confined to the Temporalities of the Church, but may as Occa&s;ion and Nece&s;&s;ity may require, be improved in Spiritual Services in the Church, according to the &s;e|veral Gifts, and Abilities be&s;towed upon them.</P>
<P N="11">XI. SEVERAL Articles of Agreement, re&s;pecting the Conduct and Behaviour of our Church, one towards another.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE agree that particular Churches ought not to walk &s;o di&s;tinct, and &s;eparate from each other, as not to have Care and Tenderne&s;s one towards the other; but ought by mutual Advice and brotherly Intercour&s;e, to &s;trengthen and encourage each others Hearts and Hands in the Ways of the Lord.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT none of our Churches &s;hall be &s;ubordinate to one another; each being endued with Equality of Power from Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. THAT known Members of particular Churches, that we have already declared we are willing to hold Communion with, as well as tho&s;e who are of our par|ticular Churches; may have occa&s;ional Communion in the Ordinances of the Go&s;pel, unle&s;s there be &s;ome ju&s;t Objection.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="31" REF="017115_0016_0FA02EFBD9671510">
4. THAT we will not admit any one to be a Member of our particular Churches, that hath joined him&s;elf to another; without Endeavours of mutual Satisfaction of the Church concerned.</P>
<P N="5">5. THAT we will be mo&s;t willing and ready to give an Account of our Church Proceedings to each other when de&s;ired; for preventing, or removing, any Of|fences that may ari&s;e among us. Likewi&s;e we &s;hall be ready to give the right Hand of Fellow&s;hip, and walk together, according to the Go&s;pel Rules of Commu|nion of Churches; and al&s;o to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other, by our Advice and Coun&s;el, when de&s;ired, or called thereunto.</P>
<P N="6">6. THAT in order to maintain Fellow&s;hip and U|nion among the Churches, and for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of each other, in &s;ome difficult Ca&s;es, it is expedient that Churches meet together by their Delegates, or other|ways, to con&s;ult, and advi&s;e with each other about &s;uch Things, as &s;hall be for their general Good and Benefit.</P>
<P N="7">7. THAT when any of our Churches, &s;hall in the Providence of God, be de&s;titute of Ordained Pa&s;tors among them, that tho&s;e who are favoured with Pa&s;tors, will be mo&s;t ready upon their De&s;ire, to afford them Help, and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, by giving our Pa&s;tors Fellow|&s;hip to admini&s;ter the Word, and Sacrements to them occa&s;ionally.</P>
<P N="8">8. THAT it is agreeable to the Scriptures, that a Church may (Need &s;o requiring) have more than one Pa&s;tor ordained over them, at one and the &s;ame Time.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="32" REF="017115_0017_0FA02EFCF1BA54D8">
9. THAT we will be known among our&s;elves, and others, by the Name of <HI>Strict Congregational</HI> Churches.</P>
<P N="10">10. THAT we will have a General Meeting of our &s;everal Churches, by Delegation, annually on the Third Wedne&s;day of September, for the Purpo&s;e above&s;aid; the Fir&s;t to be at Plainfield, September next.</P>
<P N="12">XII. OF the Support of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>IT is our Opinion, that the Support of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, is a Duty enjoined upon tho&s;e who are favour|ed with the Go&s;pel; that all who are taught in the Word, ought (according to their &s;everal Abilities) to communicate to him that teacheth in all good Things; and can no more be di&s;pen&s;ed with, than any other Duty required in the Word of God: That this Duty ought to be di&s;charged, by tho&s;e upon whom it lyeth, in the mo&s;t ju&s;t and equitable Way, according as God hath pro&s;pered them in the Things of this Life; and can never be di&s;charged acceptable to God, but by the free, voluntary Act of him that doth it. Therefore we wholly di&s;approve of all U&s;e of Civil Law, in forc|ing Per&s;ons to &s;upport the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try; nor do we think that the Exerci&s;e of Church Cen&s;ures upon its Members, will ever an&s;wer any good Purpo&s;e in this Affair, except when Church Members, have laid them&s;elves under a per&s;onal, voluntary Obligation, in which Ca&s;e, if they refu&s;e to fulfil their Engagements (without ju&s;t Cau&s;e) they may be proceeded again&s;t, as in any other Breaches of Promi&s;e. We apprehend that God hath re&s;erved the Puni&s;hment of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> Sin in his own Hand, as in many other Ca&s;es, and he doth it various Ways; &s;ometimes by &s;ending a Cur&s;e upon
<PB N="33" REF="017115_0017_0FA02EFCF1BA54D8">People in their Per&s;ons, Families, or E&s;tates; &s;ome|times by &s;uffering the Go&s;pel to become a Savour of Death to them; &s;ometimes by leaving them de&s;titute of any De&s;ire to hear the Go&s;pel; &s;ometimes by &s;ending a Famine of hearing the Word; and finally if dying in Impenitency, they mu&s;t expect to meet the great Au|thor of the Go&s;pel, with this &s;olemn Charge, "I was an hungry, and ye fed me not, naked and ye cloathed me not," therefore "depart from me ye Cur&s;ed," <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Some Que&s;tions naturally ari&s;e. Que&s;t. 1&s;t. What if People are able to &s;upport the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, but are not di&s;po&s;ed to do it, and &s;o neglect it? An&s;. Their want of Di&s;po&s;ition is their Sin, and their Neg|lect is the Fruit and Evidence of their Sin. Que&s;t. 2d. What &s;hall a Mini&s;ter do, that is ordained over &s;uch a Church? An&s;. After due Labour with them, &s;hake off the Du&s;t off his Feet for a Te&s;timony again&s;t them, and depart from them. Que&s;t. 3d. What if a Church, and Society, be willing to &s;upport the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, but are poor, and unable to do it? An&s;. It is accept|ed according to what a Man hath, and not according to what he hath not, if there be fir&s;t a willing Mind. And it is one of the Excellencies of the Go&s;pel, that the Poor have it preached to them, while on the other Hand, <HI>the Rich will be &s;ent empty away.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY Church, ought to adopt &s;uch Modes of &s;upporting the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try among them, as ap|pears mo&s;t agreeable to the Word of God, and to their own Circum&s;tances.</P>

<P>WHEN we con&s;ider the&s;e Things, it &s;eems we mu&s;t be guilty of the greate&s;t Ingratitude to God, if we do not offer a Tribute of Prai&s;e to him, and live to his Glory.</P>
<P>WE earne&s;tly recommend to you, to make the Word of God your Rule, and to put away every Thing from your Faith, and Practice, that wont bear the Te&s;t by that Standard of Truth. We recommend to you to put away all ra&s;h, and party Zeal, in Mat|ters of Religion; and to be cloathed with an humble, meek, and quiet Spirit, which is in the Sight of God of great Price. To &s;peak Evil of no Man, and e&s;pe|cially not to traduce any Sect of Prote&s;tant Profe&s;&s;ors, by the hard har&s;h Names of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and <HI>Antichri&s;t;</HI> knowing that others have as good a Right, to think and act for them&s;elves as we have. But let us endea|vour in Meekne&s;s, to in&s;truct tho&s;e that we think are out of the Way. We would put you in mind of the Sin of &s;peaking Evil of Civil Rulers, a Sin that is too much prevailing at this Day we live in: It is a &s;pecial Command of God, not to revile the Gods, nor &s;peak Evil of the Ruler of thy People. We ought to con&s;i|der that they are but Men, and the many Embarra&s;&s;|ments that attend their Admini&s;tration, in this Day of Trouble, and Perplexity, and to pray for them accord|ing to the Direction given in the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="017115_0019_0FA02EFE84E74B78">
WE recommend to you to cultivate Peace and Har|mony among your&s;elves, and to follow Peace with all Men, and Holine&s;s, without which no Man can &s;ee the Lord. And that you carefully guard again&s;t tho&s;e damnable Errors, and Here&s;ies, that are &s;preading in our Land in this Day we live in; e&s;pecially the Doc|trine of Univer&s;al Salvation, that is making &s;uch Pro|gre&s;s in this Day.</P>

<P>WE would al&s;o recommend to your particular Con|&s;ideration, and Attention, the Duty that lyeth upon Parents, and Churches, towards bapti&s;ed Children.

<HEAD>A LETTER from a Gentleman, on the Subject of ORDINATION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have been informed, that you are one of the Com|mittee appointed by the Strict Congregational Churches, to prepare a Draught for publick Print, de&s;igned to &s;hew in what Light they view them&s;elves, and ought to be viewed by others, with Re&s;pect to their religious Sentiments, and Practice.</P>
<P>PERHAPS there is no one Point, that you will have Occa&s;ion to declare any Thing about, that mu&s;t un|dergo &s;uch a critical Examination, and be &s;o liable to Cen&s;ure, as that of the Ordination of Mini&s;ters. For it is very obvious, that whenever the Chri&s;tian Religion hath been e&s;tabli&s;hed by Civil Law, whether Papi&s;t, or Prote&s;tant, it hath been made an Engine of Cruelty, and Oppre&s;&s;ion; and when Numbers have di&s;&s;ented, and &s;eparated from the Communion of the E&s;tabli&s;hed Order, profe&s;&s;ing to be reformed, the Standing Order never fails to object again&s;t the Mini&s;ters, improved by the Di&s;&s;enters; and the Objection chiefly relied upon to bear all down before it is, "that their Ordinations are invalid, they were not ordained by Apo&s;tolick, or Pre&s;byterian Authority; by which all Mini&s;terial Power, and Right for official Admini&s;trations are given, and conveyed." Therefore, they act without Commi&s;|&s;ion, and their Admini&s;trations empty, and u&s;ele&s;s, pre&s;umptuous, and wicked. Thus the e&s;tabli&s;hed Clergy clamour at the Ordinations of the Di&s;&s;enters, and no marvel, for their own Honour, and Intere&s;t, un|der
<PB N="40" REF="017115_0021_0FA02EFF77237A80">&s;uch Circum&s;tances makes it nece&s;&s;ary for their own Support. And the di&s;&s;enting Party have as con&s;tant|ly plead, that the Church hath Right to choo&s;e, and ordain her own Officers, e&s;teeming Scripture Qualifi|cations, holy and &s;piritual Admini&s;trations, more e&s;&s;en|tial than any particular Mode of Ordination; which they e&s;teem a Work of Order, not of Office.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, it may be ob&s;erved, that when the Di&s;|&s;enters Circum&s;tances admit of it, they invariably im|prove Mini&s;ters, in the Ordination of Mini&s;ters, as others has done before, and &s;o their Sentiments, and Practice, keep Pace with their Circum&s;tances: And when they have obtained a Civil E&s;tabli&s;hment, they have become oppre&s;&s;ive, and cruel; and &s;o another Se|paration becomes nece&s;&s;ary: And when it hath taken Place, the old Di&s;pute about Ordination, is di&s;puted over again; each Party maintaining agreeable to their pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, and thus the Di&s;pute has gone round, and round again, as though it was the great Axis, upon which all revealed Religion turned: Al|though the Bible no where mentions &s;uch Ordination, as the Criterion by which Chri&s;t's Mini&s;ters &s;hould be known, or nece&s;&s;ary to make their Admini&s;tration valid.</P>
<P>YET it is very evident, from the Bible, that Men de&s;igned for, and employed in any public Branch of Mini&s;try, in the Church, were for the mo&s;t Part or|dained, &s;ooner or later, &s;omehow or other, by whole Congregations, or by particular Officers, or &s;ome|times by a Pre&s;bytery. For a more clear View of this Matter, I will point you out a Number of Scripture
<PB N="41" REF="017115_0021_0FA02EFF77237A80">In&s;tances, Numb. 8.10, The whole Congregation laid their Hands upon the Levites, in their In&s;tall|ment to the Service of the Tabernacle. Numb. 11.25.26, The Seventy Elders were ordained, or put into Office, by a &s;olemn A&s;&s;embly, when there was no laying on of Hands. Numb. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">7.18.19, Mo&s;es laid his Hands upon Jo&s;hua, and gave him a Charge to e&s;tabli&s;h him in Office as his Succe&s;&s;or. 1&s;t. Chron. 9.22, David, and Samuel, ordained a Number of Porters, and no Ceremony mentioned. Heb. 5.1, It is &s;aid, every High Prie&s;t taken from among Men, is ordained for Men, in Things pertaining to God. The High Prie&s;t's Ordination was performed, by the pouring on, or anointing him with the Holy Oil, &s;ee Exod. 30.30.</P>
<P>NEW Te&s;tament Ordinations al&s;o, were variou&s;ly performed. The Ordination of an Apo&s;tle in Judah's room, Acts 1.22, and 26. was done by a &s;olemn Lot|tery. The Ordination of the Seven, Acts 6.6. was by Prayer, and the laying on of the Apo&s;tle's Hands. Acts 13.3. The Ordination of Paul, and Barnabas, for a Tour of Mini&s;tration among the Heathen, was by Fa&s;ting, Prayer, and the laying on of Hands. Acts 14.23, It is &s;aid they ordained them Elders in every Church; the Manner was (&s;aith Mr. Bragg) by lifting up the Hands, by which they were publickly cho&s;en: They al&s;o fa&s;ted, and prayed, and commended them to the Lord. Tit. 1.5, Titus was left at Crete to or|dain Elders; the Manner how is not declared, but their Qualifications are expre&s;&s;ed, which mu&s;t refer to their being cho&s;en, which might be no &s;mall Part of their Ordination. Tim. 4.14, Timothy was ordained by the laying on of the Hands of the Pre&s;bytery;
<PB N="42" REF="017115_0022_0FA02F004FFCFCB0">the only In&s;tance of Ordination by their Hands men|tioned in the Bible.</P>
<P>IN tho&s;e In&s;tances above quoted, it is evident, that there were divers Modes, and Forms, u&s;ed by Men of divers Characters and Stations in the Church; and probably with Reference to the Diver&s;ity of Gifts, and Office-Work, they were de&s;igned for.</P>
<P>UPON the Whole we may learn, it is certain, the Church in Order to its Well-Being, mu&s;t be furni&s;hed with able Officers; and they are promi&s;ed, but the Manner how they &s;hall be ordained, or by who&s;e Hands, is not a&s;&s;ertained in the Bible. Therefore, Chri&s;tian Prudence ought to be u&s;ed, and the Bu&s;ine&s;s per|formed in the mo&s;t rational, Chri&s;tian Manner Circum|&s;tances will admit.</P>
<P>NOW, Sir, I will declare what, in my Judgment, is a &s;criptural, rational Proceedure, in the Ordination of a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter, with Reference to his Connections and Work. The Ordination of a Church Officer, is putting him into, or declaring him to be in Holy Or|ders, in and over one Church, for the Work of the Mini&s;try; and if it may be, in the Fellow&s;hip of other Churches, for occa&s;ional Services. The Ordination, or In&s;tallment of Church Officers, ordinarily implies a public recommending them to God, and the Word of his Grace, for the Work they are de&s;igned for, in the Fellow&s;hip of the Church, or Churches. Fa&s;ting and Prayer, the Word of God preached upon the Occa&s;ion, are with great Propriety.</P>
<P>WE may lay on Hands in Ordination, but &s;hould mean no more, than a religious, &s;olemn Ge&s;ture, for|merly
<PB N="43" REF="017115_0022_0FA02F004FFCFCB0">u&s;ed by good Men, in pronouncing their Bene|dictions, and giving their Charges, and Advice, to their Children, as well as Mini&s;ters, and others: And we &s;hould repeat, and lay before them the Rule of their Duty, and the Charge to be faithful, as it &s;tands in the New Te&s;tament, with a Declaration of Fellow|&s;hip, and Engagements of A&s;&s;i&s;tance, in the great Work of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>ORDINATION implieth, a religious declaring, and recognizing the Spiritual Union, and Agreement, which had before taken Place, between the Pa&s;tor, and Flock. Ordination in the ordinary Way, doth not give mini&s;terial Gifts, or Grace; and therefore cannot be the Ba&s;is of that Union, which is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary in that Relation. But where that Union hath taken Place, if the Fellow&s;hip, and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of neighbouring Churches, and Mini&s;ters, cannot be ob|tained, it is the Church's Duty, by &s;ome cho&s;en from among&s;t them&s;elves to perform &s;uch Religious Service as they are able, &s;uitable to the Occa&s;ion; in order, publickly to e&s;tabli&s;h their Mini&s;ter's Character among them&s;elves; and may properly be called a private Or|dination. Yet upon the Plan of Catholic Commu|nion, and Fellow&s;hip among all the Churches of the Saints, their Mini&s;ters ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Fellow&s;hip of all the Churches in the Vicinity, to ad|mini&s;ter occa&s;ionally among&s;t them.</P>
<P>THEREFORE with regard to Order, and a rational Foundation for mini&s;terial U&s;efulne&s;s among the Churches in general, they &s;hould be ordained in the Pre&s;ence, and by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Fellow&s;hip of neighbouring Churches and Mini&s;ters. Neverthele&s;s, if any one Church call and ordain a Mini&s;ter duly
<PB N="44" REF="017115_0023_0FA02F0101721E00">qualified and in a decent Manner without any A&s;&s;i&s;tance of other Churches, there is no Objection ju&s;tly to be made again&s;t his having Office-Right to admini&s;ter in that Church. But he cannot from hence admini&s;ter occa&s;ionally, as an Officer, in Fellow&s;hip in any other Church; becau&s;e the Juri&s;diction of his Ordi|nation, was circum&s;cribed to one Church only.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding &s;uch Deficiency in Ordina|tion, whatever the Cau&s;e might be, if other Churches and Mini&s;ters become acquainted with &s;uch Church and Mini&s;ter, and find them walking according to Truth of the Go&s;pel; and willing to have their Mi|ni&s;ter's Ordination compleated, &s;o as to e&s;tabli&s;h his Character in the Fellow&s;hip of all the Churches, it is their Duty to take Order by common Con&s;ent, in convenient Time, to give Fellow&s;hip to his Ordination by his own Church; and &s;o e&s;tabli&s;h his Character, as a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, in the Fellow&s;hip of the Churches in general: And &s;o the Work is fini&s;hed, which might have been as well done, and more conveniently all at once, if neighbouring Churches and Mini&s;ters had been pre&s;ent at his fir&s;t In&s;tallment. The Ordi|nation of a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter, in Fellow&s;hip of the Churches, implies the joint Act of two di&s;tinct Juri&s;|dictions: One is the Church, where he is &s;pecially &s;ixed, which is an entire Juri&s;diction by it&s;elf: The other is the catholic, occa&s;ional Communion and Fel|low&s;hip of the Churches in general: Each Juri&s;diction managing the Parts of Ordination belonging to their Deparments, will make a uniform Sy&s;tem of Fellow|&s;hip in the Profe&s;&s;ion and Practice of Chri&s;tianity, re|lative to the Ordination of Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters, and the great Di&s;pute come to an End.</P>
