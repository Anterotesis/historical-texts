<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS not the only, nor even the chief, de|&s;ing of the&s;e &s;heets, to refute the rea&s;on|ing and objections of Mr Hume, with re|gard to miracles: the chief de&s;ign of them is, to &s;et the principal argument for chri&s;|tianity in its proper light. On a &s;ubject that hath been &s;o often treated, 'tis impo&s;|&s;ible to avoid &s;aying many things which have been &s;aid before. It may, however, with rea&s;on be affirmed, that there &s;till remains, on this &s;ubject, great &s;cope for new ob&s;erva|tions. Be&s;ides, it ought to be remembered, that the evidence of any complex argument depends very much on the order into which the material circum&s;tances are dige&s;ted, and the manner in which they are di&s;played.</P>
<P>The <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Miracles</HI> de&s;erves to be con&s;idered, as one of the mo&s;t dangerous at|tacks that have been made on our religion. The danger re&s;ults not &s;olely from the merit of <HI>THE PIECE;</HI> it re&s;ults much more from that of <HI>THE AUTHOR. The piece</HI> it&s;elf, like every other work of Mr Hume, is in|genious;
<PB N="vi" REF="022387_0004_0FB861A5EA882348">genious; but its merit is more of the orato|rial kind than of the philo&s;ophical. The merit of <HI>the author,</HI> I acknowledge is great. The many u&s;eful volumes he hath publi&s;hed of <HI>hi&s;tory,</HI> as well as on <HI>critici&s;m, politics,</HI> and <HI>trade,</HI> have ju&s;tly procured him, with all per&s;ons of ta&s;te and di&s;cernment, the high|e&s;t reputation as a writer. What pity is it, that this reputation &s;hould have been &s;ullied by attempts to undermine the founda|tions both of <HI>natural religion</HI> and of <HI>re|vealed!</HI></P>
<P>For my own part, I think it a piece of ju&s;tice in me, to acknowledge the obligations I owe the author, before I enter on the pro|po&s;ed examination. I have not only been much entertained and in&s;tructed by his works; but, if I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any talent in ab|&s;tract rea&s;oning, I am not a little indebted to what he hath written on <HI>human nature,</HI> for the improvement of that talent. If therefore, in this tract, I have refuted Mr Hume's <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> the greater &s;hare of the me|rit is perhaps to be a&s;cribed to Mr Hume him&s;elf. The compliment which the Ru&s;&s;i|an monarch, after the famous battle of Pol|towa, paid the Swedi&s;h generals, when he
<PB N="vii" REF="022387_0005_0FB861A90701C708">gave them the honourable appellation of his <HI>ma&s;ters in the art of war,</HI> I may, with great &s;incerity, pay my acute and ingenious adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>I &s;hall add a few things concerning the occa&s;ion and form of the following di&s;&s;ertati|on.</P>
<P>Some of the principal topics here di&s;cu&s;|&s;ed, were more briefly treated in a <HI>&s;ermon</HI> preached before the <HI>Synod</HI> of <HI>ABERDEEN,</HI> and are now made public at their de&s;ire. To the end that an argument of &s;o great impor|tance might be more fully and freely canva&s;|ed than it could have been, with propriety, in a &s;ermon, it was judged nece&s;&s;ary to new|model the di&s;cour&s;e, and to give it that form in which it now appears.</P>
<P>The <HI>edition</HI> of Mr Hume's e&s;&s;ays to which I always refer in this work, is that printed at <HI>LONDON,</HI> in duodecimo, <HI>1750,</HI> intitled, <HI>Philo&s;ophical e&s;&s;ays concerning human under&s;tanding.</HI> I have, &s;ince fini&s;hing this tract, &s;een a later <HI>edition,</HI> in which there are a few <HI>variations.</HI> None of them appeared to me &s;o material, as to give ground for altering the <HI>quotations</HI> and <HI>references</HI> here u&s;ed. There is indeed one <HI>alteration,</HI>
<PB N="viii" REF="022387_0006_0FB861AA5AC977B8">which candour required that I &s;hould men|tion: I have accordingly mentioned it in a note
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">page 126,</NOTE></P>
<P>The <HI>arguments</HI> of the e&s;&s;ayi&s;t I have en|deavoured to refute by <HI>argument.</HI> Mere <HI>declamation</HI> I know no way of refuting, but by <HI>analy&s;ing</HI> it; nor do I conceive how incon&s;i&s;tencies can be an&s;wered otherwi&s;e than by <HI>expo&s;ing</HI> them. In &s;uch <HI>analy&s;is</HI> and <HI>expo&s;ition,</HI> which, I own, I have at|tempted without ceremony or re&s;erve, an air of <HI>ridicule</HI> is unavoidable: but this <HI>ridi|cule,</HI> I am well aware, if founded in <HI>mi&s;re|pre&s;entation,</HI> will at la&s;t rebound upon <HI>my|&s;elf.</HI> It is po&s;&s;ible, that, in &s;ome things I have <HI>mi&s;taken</HI> the author's meaning; I am con&s;cious, that I have not, in any thing, de|&s;ignedly <HI>mi&s;repre&s;ented</HI> it.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>"CHRISTIANITY," it hath been &s;aid, "is not founded in argument." If it were only meant by the&s;e words, that the religion of Je&s;us could not, by the &s;ingle aid of rea&s;oning, produce its full effect upon the heart; every true Chri&s;tian would chearfully &s;ub&s;cribe to them. No arguments unaccompanied by the influences of the Holy Spirit; can convert the &s;oul from &s;in to God; though even to &s;uch conver&s;ion, arguments are, by the agency of the Spirit, render'd &s;ub&s;ervient. Again, if we were to under&s;tand by this aphori&s;m, that the principles of our religion could never have been di&s;covered, by the natural and una&s;&s;i&s;ted faculties of man; this po&s;ition, I pre&s;ume, would be as little di&s;puted as the former. But if, on the contrary, under the cover of an ambi|guous expre&s;&s;ion, it is intended to in&s;inuate, that tho&s;e principles, from their very nature, can admit no rati|onal evidence of their truth, (and this, by the way, is the only meaning which can avail our antagoni&s;ts) the go&s;pel, as well as common &s;en&s;e, loudly reclaims again&s;t it.</P>
<P>The Lord JESUS CHRIST, the author of our reli|gion, often argued, both with his di&s;ciples and with his adver&s;aries, as with rea&s;onable men, on the principles of rea&s;on, without this faculty, he well know, they could not be &s;u&s;ceptible either of religion or of law. He argued from prophecy, and the conformity of the event to the prediction
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xxiv. 25. &amp;c. John v. 39, &amp; 46.</NOTE>. He
<PB N="2" REF="022387_0011_0FB861B59F83FE40">argued from the te&s;timony of John the Bapti&s;t, who was generally acknowledged to be a prophet
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John v. 32, &amp; 33.</NOTE>. He argued from the miracles which he him&s;elf perform|ed
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">John v. 36. x. 25, 37, 38. xiv. 10, 11.</NOTE>, as uncontrovertible evidences, that GOD Al|mighty operated by him, and had &s;ent him. He expo&s;tulates with his enemies, that they did not u&s;e their rea&s;on on this &s;ubject. <HI>Why,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>even of your&s;elves, judge ye not what is right</HI>
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Luke xii. 57.</NOTE>? In like man|ner we are called upon by the apo&s;tles of our Lord, to act the part of <HI>wi&s;e men</HI> and <HI>judge</HI> impartially of <HI>what</HI> they <HI>&s;ay</HI>
<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. x. 15.</NOTE>. Tho&s;e who do &s;o, are highly com|mended, for the candour and prudence they di&s;cover, in an affair of &s;o great con&s;equence
<NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 11.</NOTE>. We are even commanded, to be <HI>always ready to give an an&s;wer to every man that a&s;keth</HI> us <HI>a rea&s;on of our hope

God has neither in natural nor re|veal'd religion, <HI>left him&s;elf without a witne&s;s;</HI> but has in both given moral and external evidence, &s;ufficient to convince the impartial, to &s;ilence the gain&s;ayer, and to render inexcu&s;able the athei&s;t and the unbe|liever. This evidence it is our duty to attend to, and candidly to examine. We mu&s;t <HI>prove all things,</HI> as we are expre&s;sly enjoin'd in holy writ, if we would ever hope to <HI>hold fa&s;t that which is</HI> good
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The&s;&s;. v. 21.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS much I thought proper to premi&s;e, not to &s;erve as an apology for the de&s;ign of this tract, (the
<PB N="3" REF="022387_0012_0FB861B7079A78E0">de&s;ign &s;urely needs no apology, whatever the world may judge of the execution) but to expo&s;e the &s;hal|lowne&s;s of that pretext, under which the advocates for infidelity in this age commonly take &s;helter. Whil&s;t therefore we enforce an argument, which, in &s;upport of our religion, was &s;o frequently in&s;i&s;ted on by its divine founder, we will not dread the reproach|ful titles of <HI>dangerous friends,</HI> or <HI>di&s;gui&s;ed eneries</HI> of revelation. Such are the titles, which the writer, who&s;e &s;entiments we propo&s;e in the&s;e papers to can|va&s;s, hath be&s;tow'd on his antagoni&s;ts
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 204.</NOTE>; not, I be|lieve, through malice again&s;t them, but as a &s;ort of excu&s;e for him&s;elf, or at lea&s;t a handle for introducing a very &s;trange and unmeaning compliment to the religion of his country, after a very bold attempt to undermine it. We will however do him the ju&s;tice to own, that he hath put it out of our power to re|tort the charge. No intelligent per&s;on, who hath carefully peru&s;ed the <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Miracles,</HI> will impute to the author either of tho&s;e ignominious cha|racters.</P>
<P>My <HI>primary</HI> intention in undertaking an an&s;wer to the afore&s;aid e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hath invariably been, to contribute all in my power to the defence of a <HI>religion,</HI> which I e&s;teem the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing conferred by Heaven on the &s;ons of men. It is at the &s;ame time a <HI>&s;econdary</HI> motive of con&s;iderable weight, to vindicate <HI>philo&s;ophy,</HI> at lea&s;t that mo&s;t important branch of it which a&s;cer|tains the rules of rea&s;oning, from tho&s;e ab&s;urd con|&s;equences, which this author's theory naturally leads us to. The theme is arduous. The adver&s;ary is both &s;ubtle and powerful. With &s;uch an adver&s;ary, I
<PB N="4" REF="022387_0013_0FB861BB0FA7B4A8">&s;hould on very unequal terms enter the li&s;ts, had I not the advantage of being on the &s;ide of truth. And an eminent advantage this doubtle&s;s is. It requires but moderate abilities to &s;peak in defence of a good cau&s;e. A good cau&s;e demands but a di&s;tinct expo|&s;ition and a fair hearing; and we may &s;ay with great propriety, it will &s;peak for it&s;elf. But to adorn er|ror with the &s;emblance of truth, and <HI>make the wor&s;e appear the better rea&s;on,</HI> requires all the arts of in genuity and invention; arts in which few or none have been more expert than Mr Hume. It is much to be regretted, that on &s;ome occa&s;ions he hath &s;o ill applied them.</P>

<HEAD>A DISSERTATION ON MIRACLES. PART I. Miracles are capable of proof from te&s;timony, and religious miracles are not le&s;s capable of this evi|dence than others.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. <HI>Mr Hume's favourite argument is founded on a fal&s;e hypothe&s;is.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is not the aim of this author to evince, that miracles, if admitted to be true, would not be a &s;ufficient evidence of a divine mi&s;&s;ion. His de&s;ign is &s;olely to prove, that miracles which have not been the objects of our own &s;en&s;es, at lea&s;t &s;uch as are &s;aid to have been performed in atte&s;tation of any re|ligious &s;y&s;tem, cannot rea&s;onably be admitted by us, or believ'd on the te&s;timony of others. "A miracle," &s;ays he, <Q>&s;upported by any human te&s;timony, is
<PB N="6" REF="022387_0015_0FB861BF4A6B9E28" MS="y">more properly a &s;ubject of deri&s;ion than of argu|ment
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 194.</NOTE>."Again, in the conclu&s;ion of his e&s;&s;ay, Upon the whole, it appears, that no te&s;timony, for <HI>any kind</HI> of miracle, can ever po&s;&s;ibly amount to a probability, much le&s;s to a proof
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 20<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE>.</Q> Here he concludes again&s;t all miracles. "<HI>Any kind</HI> of miracle" are his expre&s;s words. He &s;eems however immediately &s;en&s;ible, that in a&s;&s;erting this, he hath gone too far; and therefore, in the end of the &s;ame paragraph, retracts part of what he had advanced in the beginning. <Q>We may e&s;tabli&s;h it as a maxim that no human te&s;timony can have &s;uch force, as to prove a miracle, and make it a ju&s;t foundation for any &s;y&s;tem of religion.</Q> In the note on this pa&s;&s;age, he has the&s;e words. <Q>I beg the limitation here made, may be remarked, when I &s;ay, that a miracle can never be prov'd, &s;o as to be the foun|dation of a &s;y&s;tem of religion. For I own that otherwi&s;e there may po&s;&s;ibly be miracles, or violations of the u&s;ual cour&s;e of nature, of &s;uch a kind, of to admit of proof from human te&s;timo|ny.</Q></P>
<P>So much for that cardinal point, which the e&s;&s;ayi&s;t labours &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly to evince; and which, if true, will not only be &s;ubver&s;ive of revelation, as received by us, on the te&s;timony of the apo&s;tles, and prophets, and martyrs; but will directly lead to this general conclu&s;ion: <Q>That it is impo&s;&s;ible for God Almigh|ty to give a revelation, attended with &s;uch evidence that it can be rea&s;onably believed in after-ages, or even in the &s;ame age, by any per&s;on who hath
<PB N="7" REF="022387_0016_0FB861C0C9CE2D78">not been an eye-witne&s;s of the miracles, by which it is &s;upported.</Q></P>
<P>Now, by what wonderful proce&s;s of rea&s;oning is this &s;trange conclu&s;ion made out? Several topics have been employ'd for the purpo&s;e by this &s;ubtle di&s;pu|tant. Among the&s;e there is one principal argument which he is at great pains to &s;et off to the be&s;t ad|vantage. Here indeed he claims a particular con|cern, having di&s;covered it him&s;elf. His title to the honour of the di&s;covery, 'tis not my bu&s;ine&s;s to con|trovert; I confine my&s;elf entirely to the con&s;ideration of its importance. To this end I &s;hall now lay be|fore the reader, the unan&s;werable argument, as he flatters him&s;elf it will be found; taking the freedom for brevity's &s;ake, to compendize the rea&s;oning, and to omit whatever is &s;aid merely for illu&s;tration. To do otherwi&s;e would lay me under the nece&s;&s;ity of tran&s;cribing the greater part of the e&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>'Experience,' &s;ays he, <Q>is our only guide in rea|&s;oning concerning matters of fact
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 174.</NOTE>. Experience is in &s;ome things variable, in &s;ome things uniform. A variable experience gives ri&s;e only to probability; an uniform experience amounts to a proof
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 175, 176.</NOTE>. Proba|bility always &s;uppo&s;es an oppo&s;ition of experiments and ob&s;ervations, where the one &s;ide is found to o|verbalance the other, and to produce a degree of evidence proportion'd to the &s;uperiority. In &s;uch ca&s;es we mu&s;t balance the oppo&s;ite experi|ments, and deduct the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;er number from the greater, in order to know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he exact force of the &s;upe|rior evidence
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">ibid.</NOTE>. Our belief or a&s;&s;urance of any fact
<PB N="8" REF="022387_0017_0FB861C5AB9EDEC0">from the report of eye-witne&s;&s;es, is derived from no other principle than experience; that is, our ob&s;ervation of the veracity of human te&s;timony, and of the u&s;ual conformity of facts to the reports of witne&s;&s;es
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 176.</NOTE>. Now, if the fact atte&s;ted partakes of the marvellous, if it is &s;uch as has &s;eldom fallen under our ob&s;ervation, here is a conte&s;t of two op|po&s;ite experiences, of which the one de&s;troys the other, as far as its force goes, and the &s;uperior can only operate on the mind by the force which remains. The very &s;ame principle of experience, which gives us a certain degree of a&s;&s;urance in the te&s;timony of witne&s;&s;es, gives us al&s;o, in this ca&s;e, another de|gree of a&s;&s;urance, again&s;t the fact which they en|deavour to e&s;tabli&s;h; from which contradiction, there nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;es a counterpoi&s;e, and mutual de&s;truction of belief and authority
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 179.</NOTE>. Further, if the fact affirmed by the witne&s;&s;es, in&s;tead of being only marvellous, is really miraculous; if be&s;ides the te&s;timony con&s;ider'd apart and in it&s;elf, amounts to an entire proof; in that ca&s;e there is proof a|gain&s;t proof, of which the &s;tronge&s;t mu&s;t prevail, but &s;till with a diminution of its force, in propor|tion to that of its antagoni&s;t. A miracle is a viola|tion of the laws of nature; and as a firm and unalterable experience has e&s;tabli&s;hed the&s;e laws, the proof again&s;t a miracle from the very nature of the fact, is as entire, as any argument from ex|perience can po&s;&s;ibly be imagined
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 180.</NOTE>. And if &s;o, 'tis an undeniable con&s;equence, that it cannot be &s;urmounted by any proof whatever from te&s;timony. A miracle, therefore, however atte&s;ted, can never
<PB N="9" REF="022387_0018_0FB861C6D3C79940">be render'd credible, even in the lowe&s;t degree.</Q> This, in my apprehen&s;ion, is the &s;um of the argument on which my ingenious opponent re&s;ts the &s;trength of his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>IN an&s;wer to this I propo&s;e fir&s;t to prove, that the whole is built upon a fal&s;e hypothe&s;is. That the evi|dence of te&s;timony is derived &s;olely from experience, which &s;eems to be an axiom of this writer, is at lea&s;t not &s;o inconte&s;table a truth as he &s;uppo&s;es it; that, on the contrary, te&s;timony hath a natural and original influence on belief, antecedent to experience, will, I imagine, ea&s;ily be evinced. For this purpo&s;e let it be remark'd, that the earlie&s;t a&s;&s;ent, whch is given to te&s;timony by children, and which is previous to all experience, is in fact the mo&s;t unlimited, that by a gra|dual experience of manknd, it is gradually contracted, and reduced to narrower bounds. To &s;ay, therefore, that our diffidence in te&s;timony is the re&s;ult of experi|ence, is more philo&s;ophical, becau&s;e more con&s;onant to truth, than to &s;ay that our faith in te&s;timony has this foundation. Accordingly youth, which is unexperienced, is credulous; age, on the contrary, is di&s;tru&s;tful. Exactly the rever&s;e would be the ca&s;e were this author's doctrine ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Perhaps it will be &s;aid. If experience is allowed to be the only mea&s;ure of a logical or rea&s;onable faith in te&s;timony, the que&s;tion, <HI>Whether the influence of te&s;ti|mony on belief, be original or deriv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d?</HI> if 'tis not mere|ly verbal, is at lea&s;t of no importance in the pre&s;ent controver&s;y. But I maintain it is of the greate&s;t im|portance. The difference between us is by no means &s;o incon&s;iderable, as to a carele&s;s view it may
<PB N="10" REF="022387_0019_0FB861C847024FC0">appear. According to his philo&s;ophy, the pre&s;ump|tion is again&s;t the te&s;timony or (which amounts to the &s;ame thing) there is not the &s;malle&s;t pre&s;ump|tion in its favour, till properly &s;upported by experi|ence. According to the explication given, there is the &s;tronge&s;t pre&s;umption in favour of the te&s;timony, till properly refuted by experience.</P>
<P>If it be objected by the author, that &s;uch a faith in te&s;timony as is prior to experience, mu&s;t be unrea|&s;onable and unphilo&s;ophical, becau&s;e unaccountable; I &s;hould reply, that there are, and mu&s;t be, in hu|man nature, &s;ome original grounds of belief, beyond which our re&s;earches cannot proceed, and of which therefore 'tis vain to attempt a rational account. I &s;hould de&s;ire the objector to give a rea&s;onable account of his faith in this principle, that <HI>&s;imilar cau&s;es al|ways produce &s;imilar effects;</HI> or in this, that <HI>the cour&s;e of nature will be the &s;ame to-morrow, that it was ye|&s;terday, and is to day:</HI> principles, which he him&s;elf acknowledges, are neither intuitively evident, nor deduced from premi&s;es; and which neverthele&s;s we are under a nece&s;&s;ity of pre&s;uppo&s;ing, in all our rea|&s;onings from experience
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sceptical doubts. Part 2.</NOTE>. I &s;hould de&s;ire him to give a rea&s;onable account of his faith in the cleare&s;t in|formations of his memory, which he will find it alike impo&s;&s;ible either to doubt, or to explain. Indeed me|mory bears nearly the &s;ame relation to experience, that te&s;timony does. Certain it is that the defects and mi&s;repre&s;entations of memory are often corrected by experience. Yet &s;hould any per&s;on hence infer, that memory derives all its evidence from experi|ence, he would fall into a manife&s;t ab&s;urdity. For,
<PB N="11" REF="022387_0020_0FB861CE08F4EC48">on the contrary, experience derives its origin &s;olely from memory, and is nothing el&s;e but the general maxims or conclu&s;ions, we have form'd, from the compari&s;on of particular facts remember'd. If we had not previou&s;ly given an implicit faith to memory, we had never been able to acquire experience. When there|fore we &s;ay that memory, which gives birth to expe|rience, may neverthele&s;s in &s;ome in&s;tances be correct|ed by experience, no more is imply'd, but that the in|ferences form'd from the mo&s;t lively and per&s;picuous reports of memory, &s;ometimes &s;erve to rectify the mi&s;|takes which ari&s;e from &s;uch reports of this faculty, as are mo&s;t languid and confus'd. Thus memory, in the&s;e in&s;tances, may be &s;aid to correct it&s;elf. The ca&s;e is often much the &s;ame with experience and te&s;timo|ny, as will appear more clearly in the &s;econd &s;ection, where I &s;hall con&s;ider the ambiguity of the word <HI>ex|perience,</HI> as us'd by this author.</P>
<P>BUT how, &s;ays Mr Hume, is te&s;timony then to be refuted? Principally in one or other of the&s;e two ways: <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and mo&s;t directly, by contradictory te|&s;timony; that is, when an equal or greater number of witne&s;&s;es, equally or more credible, atte&s;t the con|trary: <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> by &s;uch evidence either of the inca|pacity or ba&s;ene&s;s of the witne&s;&s;es, as is &s;ufficient to di&s;credit them. What, rejoins my antagoni&s;t, can|not then te&s;timony be confuted by the extraordinary nature of the fact atte&s;ted? Has this con&s;ideration no weight at all? That this con&s;ideration hath no weight at all, 'twas never my intention to main|tain; that by it&s;elf it can very rarely, if ever, amount to a refutation again&s;t ample and unexceptiona|ble

Who hath ever denied, that the uncommonne&s;s of an e|vent related, is a pre&s;umption again&s;t its reality; and that chiefly on account of the tendency, which, expe|rience teacheth us, and this author hath ob&s;erved, &s;ome people have to &s;acrifice truth to the love of wonder

<P>In his opinion, <Q>When the fact atte&s;ted is &s;uch as has &s;eldom fallen under our ob&s;ervation, there is a conte&s;t of two oppo&s;ite experiences, of which the one de&s;troys the other, as far as its force goes, and the &s;uperior can only operate on the mind, by the force which remains

I wi&s;h he had been a little more explicit in teaching us how the&s;e rare inventions mu&s;t be us'd. When a writer of genius and elocution expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in general terms, he will find it an ea&s;y matter, to give a plau&s;ible appear|ance to things the mo&s;t unintelligible in nature. Such &s;ometimes is this author's way of writing. In the in&s;tance before us he is particularly happy in his choice of metaphors. They are &s;uch as are na|turally adapted to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s a reader in his favour. What candid per&s;on can think of &s;u&s;pecting the im|partiality of an inquirer, who is for <HI>weighing</HI> in the <HI>&s;cales</HI> of rea&s;on, all the arguments on either &s;ide?

<P>In confirmation of the remark ju&s;t now made, let us try how his manner of arguing on this point can be applied to a particular in&s;tance. For this purpo&s;e I make the following &s;upp&s;ition. I have lived for &s;ome years near a ferry. It con&s;i&s;ts with my know|ledge that the pa&s;&s;age-boat has a thou&s;and times cro&s;&s;|ed the river, and as many times returned &s;afe. An unknown man, whom I have ju&s;t now met, tells me in a &s;erious manner, that it is lo&s;t; and affirms, that he him&s;elf &s;tanding on the bank, was a &s;pectator of the &s;cene; that he &s;aw the pa&s;&s;engers carried down the &s;tream, and the boat overwhelmed. No per&s;on, who is influenced in his judgment of things, not by philo&s;ophical &s;ubtilties, but by common &s;en&s;e, a much &s;urer guide, will he&s;itate to declare, that in &s;uch a te&s;timony I have probable evidence of the fact a&s;&s;erted. But if leaving common &s;en&s;e, I &s;hall recur to metaphy&s;ics, and &s;ubmit to be tutored in my way of judging by the e&s;&s;ayi&s;t, he will remind me, <Q>that there is here a conte&s;t of two oppo&s;ite experi|ences, of which the one de&s;troys the other, as far as its force goes, and the &s;uperior can only operate on the mind by the force which remains.</Q> I am warned, that <Q>the very &s;ame principle of experience, which gives me a certain degree of a&s;&s;urance in the te&s;timony of the witne&s;s gives me al&s;o, in this ca&s;e, another degree of a&s;&s;urance, again&s;t
<PB N="14" REF="022387_0023_0FB861D322B7F080">the fact, which he endeavours to e&s;tabli&s;h, from which contradiction there ari&s;es a counterpoi&s;e and mutual de&s;truction of belief and authority
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 179.</NOTE>.</Q>&mdash; Well, I would know the truth, if po&s;&s;ible; and that I may conclude fairly and philo&s;ophically, how mu&s;t I balance the&s;e oppo&s;ite experiences, as you are plea&s;ed to term them? Mu&s;t I &s;et the thou&s;and, or rather the two thou&s;and in&s;tances of the one &s;ide, again&s;t the &s;ingle in&s;tance of the other? In that ca&s;e, 'tis ea&s;y to &s;ee, I have nineteen hundred and ninety-nine degrees of evidence that my information is fal&s;e. Or, is it nece&s;&s;ary, in order to make it credible, that the &s;ingle in&s;tance have two thou&s;and times as much evidence, as any of the oppo&s;ite in&s;tances, &s;uppo&s;ing them equal among them&s;elves; or &s;uppo&s;ing them unequal, as much as all the two thou&s;and put together, that there may be at lea&s;t an equilibrium? This is impo&s;&s;ible. I had for &s;ome of tho&s;e in&s;tances, the evidence of &s;en&s;e, which hardly any te&s;timony can equal, much le&s;s exceed. Once more, mu&s;t the evidence I have of the veracity of the witne&s;s, be a full equivalent to the two thou&s;and in&s;tances, which oppo&s;e the fact atte&s;ted? By the &s;uppo&s;ition, I have no po&s;itive evidence for or again&s;t his veracity, he being a per&s;on whom I never &s;aw before. Yet if none of the&s;e be the balancing, which the e&s;&s;ay-writer means, I de&s;pair of being able to di&s;cover his mean|ing.</P>
<P>Is then &s;o weak a proof from te&s;timony incapable of being refuted? I am far from thinking &s;o; tho' even &s;o weak a proof could not be overturned by &s;uch a contrary experience. How then may it be
<PB N="15" REF="022387_0024_0FB861D69F391A60">overturned? <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> by contradictory te&s;timony. Go|ing homewards I meet another per&s;on, whom I know as little as I did the former; finding that he comes from the ferry, I a&s;k him cencerning the truth of the report. He affirms that the whole is a fiction; that he &s;aw the boat, and all in it, come &s;afe to land. This would do more to turn the &s;cale, than fifty thou&s;and &s;uch contrary in&s;tances, as were &s;up|po&s;ed. Yet this would not remove &s;u&s;picion. In|deed, if we were to con&s;ider the matter ab&s;tractly, one would think, that all &s;u&s;picion would be removed, that the two oppo&s;ite te&s;timonies would de&s;troy each other, and leave the mind entirely under the influence of its former experience, in the &s;ame &s;tate as if nei|ther te&s;timony had been given. But this is by no means con&s;onant to fact. When once te&s;timonies are introduced, former experience is generally of no account in the reckoning; it is but like the du&s;t of the balance, which hath not any &s;en&s;ible effect upon the &s;cales. The mind hangs in &s;u&s;pence between the two contrary declarations, and con&s;iders it as one to one, or equal improbability, that the report is true, or that it is fal&s;e. Afterwards a third, and a fourth, and a fifth, confirm the declaration of the &s;econd. I am then quite at ea&s;e. Is this the only effectual way of confuting fal&s;e te&s;timony? No. I &s;uppo&s;e <HI>again,</HI> that in&s;tead of meeting with any per&s;on who can inform me concerning the fact, I get from &s;ome, who are acquainted with the witne&s;s information concerning his character. They tell me, he is notorious for lying; and that his lies are commonly forged, not with a view to intere&s;t, but merely to gratify a malicious plea&s;ure, which the takes in alarm|ing
<PB N="16" REF="022387_0025_0FB861D8E600CE38">&s;trangers. This, tho' not &s;o direct a refutation as the former, will be &s;ufficient to di&s;credit his report. In the former, where there is te&s;timony contradicting te&s;timony, the author's metaphor of a balance may be u&s;ed with propriety. The things weighed are homo|geneal: and when contradictory evidences are pre|&s;ented to the mind, tending to prove po&s;itions which cannot be both true, the mind mu&s;t decide on the comparative &s;trength of the oppo&s;ite evidences, before it yield to either.</P>
<P>But is this the ca&s;e in the &s;uppo&s;ition fir&s;t made? By no means. The two thou&s;and in&s;tances formerly known, and the &s;ingle in&s;tance atte&s;ted, as they re|late to different facts, tho' of a contrary nature, are not contradictory. There is no incon&s;i&s;tency in be|lieving both. There is no incon&s;i&s;tency in receiving the la&s;t on weaker evidence, (if it be &s;ufficient evidence) not only than all the former together, but even than any of them &s;ingly. Will it be &s;aid, that tho' the former in&s;tances are not them&s;elves contradictory to to the fact recently atte&s;ted, they lead to a conclu|&s;ion that is contradictory? I an&s;wer, 'Tis true, that the experienced frequency of the conjunction of any two events, leads the mind to infer a &s;imilar con|junction in time to come. But let it at the &s;ame time be remarked, that no man con&s;iders this inference, as having equal evidence with any one of tho&s;e pa&s;t events, on which it is founded, and for the belief of which we have had &s;ufficient te&s;timony. Before then the method recommended by this author can turn to any account, it will be nece&s;&s;ary for him to compute and determine with preci&s;ion, how many hundreds,

<P>There is in <HI>arithmetic</HI> a rule called REDUCTION, by which numbers of different denominations are brought to the &s;ame denomination.

Then indeed he will have the honour to e&s;tabli&s;h an everla&s;ting peace in the repu|blic of letters; then we &s;hall have the happine&s;s to &s;ee controver&s;y of every kind, theological, hi&s;torical, philo&s;ophical, receive its mortal wound: for though, in every que&s;tion, we could not even then determine with certainty, on which &s;ide the truth lay, we could always determine (and that is the utmo&s;t the nature of the thing admits) with as much accuracy as geometry and algebra can afford, on which &s;ide the probability lay, and in what degree. But till this metaphy&s;ical <HI>reduction</HI> is di&s;covered, 'twill beimpo&s;&s;ible where the evidences are of different orders, to a&s;cer|tain by <HI>&s;ubtraction</HI> the &s;uperior evidence.

In|&s;tead of this, &s;uppo&s;e you have the te&s;timony of but one ocular witne&s;s, a man of integrity, and &s;killed in a&s;tronomy, that at &s;uch an hour, of &s;uch a day, in &s;uch a part of the heavens, a comet <HI>did</HI> appear; you will not he&s;itate one moment to give him credit. Yet all the pre&s;umption that was again&s;t the truth of the fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition, tho' almo&s;t as &s;trong evidence as experience can afford, was al&s;o again&s;t the truth of the &s;econd, before it was thus atte&s;ted.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to urge further, in &s;upport of this doctrine, that as the water in the canal cannot be made to ri&s;e higher than the fountain whence it flows; &s;o it is impo&s;&s;ible, that the evidence of te&s;timony, if it proceeded from experience, &s;hould ever exceed that of experience, which is its &s;ource? Yet that it greatly exceeds this evidence, appears not only from what hath been ob&s;erved already, but &s;till more, from what I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve in the &s;equel. One may &s;afely affirm, that no conceivable conclu&s;ion from experience, can po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;tronger evidence, than that which a&s;certains us of the regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and duration of day and night. The rea&s;on is, the in&s;tances on which this experience is founded, are both with|out number and without exception. Yet even this conclu&s;ion, the author admits, as we &s;hall &s;ee in the third &s;ection, may, in a particular in&s;tance, not only be &s;urmounted, but even annihilated by te&s;timony.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, let it be ob&s;erved, that the immediate con|clu&s;ion from experience is always <HI>general,</HI> and runs thus: 'This is the ordinary cour&s;e of nature.'

<Q>Such an event may rea&s;onably be expected, where all the circum&s;tances are entirely &s;imilar.</Q> But when we de&s;cend to particulars, the conclu&s;ion becomes wea|ker, being more indirect.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Where-ever &s;uch balancing or numbering can take place, the oppo&s;ite evidences mu&s;t be entirely &s;imilar. It will rarely a&s;&s;i&s;t us in judging of facts &s;upported by te&s;timony; for even where contradictory te&s;timonies come to be con&s;idered, you will hardly find that the characters of the witne&s;&s;es on the oppo&s;ite &s;ides are &s;o preci&s;ely equal, as that an arithmetical operation will evolve the credibility. In matters of pure experience it hath often place. Hence the computations that have been made of the value of an|nuities, in&s;urances, and &s;everal other commercial articles. In calculations concerning chances, the degree of probability may be determined with mathematical exactne&s;s. I &s;hall here take the liberty, tho' the matter be not e&s;&s;ential to the de&s;ign of this tract, to correct an over&s;ight in the e&s;&s;ayi&s;t, who always &s;uppo&s;es, that where contrary evidences mu&s;t be balanced, the probability lies in the remainder or &s;urplus, when the le&s;s number is &s;ubtracted from the greater. The probability doth not con&s;i&s;t in the &s;ur|plus, but in the ratio, or geometrical proportion, which the num|bers on the oppo&s;ite &s;ides bear to each other. I explain my&s;elf thus.

Though the difference, or arithmetical proportion, which is 50, be the &s;ame in both ca&s;es, the probability is by no means equal, as the author's way of rea&s;oning implies. The probability of the fir&s;t event is as 100 to 50, or 2 to 1. The probability of the &s;econd is as 60 to 10, or 6 to 1. Con&s;equently on comparing the dif|ferent examples, tho' both be probable, the &s;econd is thrice as probable as the fir&s;t.</NOTE>. But the evidence

<P>FROM what hath been &s;aid, the attentive reader will ea&s;ily di&s;cover, that the author's argument again&s;t <HI>miracles,</HI> hath not the lea&s;t affinity to the argument u&s;ed by Dr Tillot&s;on again&s;t <HI>tran&s;ub&s;tantiation,</HI> with which Mr Hume hath introduced his &s;ubject. Let us hear the argument, as it is related in the E&s;&s;ay, from the writings of the Archbi&s;hop. <Q>'Tis acknowledged on all hands, &s;ays that learned prelate, that the au|thority either of the &s;cripture or of tradition, is founded merely on the te&s;timony of the apo&s;tles, who were eye-witne&s;&s;es to tho&s;e miracles of our
<PB N="22" REF="022387_0031_0FB861E591F29EA8">Saviour, by which he proved his divine mi&s;&s;ion. Our evidence then for the truth of the Chri&s;tian religion, is le&s;s than the evidence for the truth of our &s;en&s;es; becau&s;e even in the fir&s;t authors of our religion, it was no greater; and 'tis evident, it mu&s;t dimini&s;h in pa&s;&s;ing from them to their di&s;ciples; nor can any one be &s;o certain of the truth of their te&s;timony, as of the immediate objects of his &s;en&s;es. But a weaker evidence can never de&s;troy a &s;tronger; and therefore, were the doctrine of the real pre|&s;ence ever &s;o clearely revealed in &s;cripture, 'twere directly contrary to the rules of ju&s;t rea&s;oning to give our a&s;&s;ent to it. It contradicts &s;en&s;e, tho' both the &s;cripture and tradition, on which it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be built, carry not &s;uch evidence with them as &s;en&s;e, when they are con&s;idered merely as external evidences, and are not brought home to every one's brea&s;t, by the immediate operation of the Holy Spirit.

<HEAD>SECTION II. <HI>Mr Hume charged with &s;ome fallacies in his way of managing the argument.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the e&s;&s;ay there is frequent mention of the word <HI>experience,</HI> and much u&s;e made of it. 'Tis &s;trange that the author hath not favoured us with the definition of a term of &s;o much moment to his argu|ment. This defect I &s;hall endeavour to &s;upply; and the rather, as the word appears to be equivocal, and to be u&s;ed by the e&s;&s;ayi&s;t in two very different &s;en&s;es. The fir&s;t and mo&s;t proper &s;ignification of the word, which, for di&s;tinction's &s;ake, I &s;hall call <HI>per&s;onal</HI> experience, is that given in the preced|'ing &s;ection. 'It is,' as was ob&s;erved, <Q>founded in <HI>memory,</HI> and con&s;i&s;ts &s;olely of the general maxims
<PB N="25" REF="022387_0034_0FB861EC5076EB88">or conclu&s;ions, that each individual hath formed, from the compari&s;on of the particular facts he hath remembered.</Q> In the other &s;ignification, in which the word is &s;ometimes taken, and which I &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h by the term <HI>derived,</HI> it may be thus de|fined. <Q>It is founded in <HI>te&s;timony,</HI> and con&s;i&s;ts not only of all the experiences of others, which have thro' that channel been communicated to us, but of all the general maxims or conclu&s;ions we have formed, from the compari&s;on of particular facts at|te&s;ted.</Q></P>
<P>In propo&s;ing his argument, the author would &s;ure|ly be under&s;tood to mean only <HI>per&s;onal</HI> experience; otherwi&s;e, his making te&s;timony derive its light from an experience which derives its light from te&s;timony, would be introducing what logicians term a <HI>circle in cau&s;es.</HI> It would exhibit the &s;ame things alternately, as cau&s;es and effects of each other. Yet nothing can be more limited, than the &s;en&s;e which is conveyed under the term <HI>experience,</HI> in the fir&s;t acceptation. The mere&s;t clown or pea&s;ant derives incomparably more knowledge from te&s;timony, and the commu|nicated experience of others, than in the longe&s;t life he could have ama&s;&s;ed out of the trea&s;ure of his own memory. Nay, to &s;uch a &s;canty portion the &s;avage him&s;elf is not confined. If that therefore mu&s;t be the rule, the only rule, by which every te&s;timony is ultimately to be judged, our belief in matters of fact mu&s;t have very narrow bounds. No te&s;timony ought to have any weight with us, that doth not relate an event, &s;imilar at lea&s;t to &s;ome one ob&s;ervation, which
<PB N="26" REF="022387_0035_0FB861EE6FA697D8">we our&s;elves have had acce&s;s to make. For exam|ple, that there are &s;uch people on the earth as ne|groes, could not, on that hypothe&s;is, be rendered cre|dible to one who had never &s;een a negro, not even by the mo&s;t numerous and the mo&s;t unexceptionable atte&s;tations. Again&s;t the admi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch te&s;timony, however &s;trong, the whole force of the author's ar|gument evidently operates. But that innumerable ab&s;urdities would flow from this principle, I might ea&s;ily evince, did I not think the ta&s;k &s;uperfluous.</P>
<P>The author him&s;elf is aware of the con&s;equences; and therefore, in whatever &s;en&s;e he u&s;es the term <HI>experience</HI> in propo&s;ing his argument; in pro&s;ecuting it, he with great dexterity &s;hifts the &s;en&s;e, and ere the reader is appri&s;ed, in&s;inuates another. <Q>'Tis a miracle,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>that a dead man &s;hould come to life, becau&s;e that has never been ob&s;erved in any age or country. There mu&s;t therefore be an uniform experience again&s;t every miraculous event, otherwi&s;e the event would not merit that appella|tion
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 181.</NOTE>.</Q> Here the phra&s;e, <HI>an uniform experience again&s;t an event,</HI> in the latter clau&s;e, is implicitly de|fined in the former, not what has never been ob&s;erved BY US, but (mark his words) <HI>what has never been ob&s;erved</HI> IN ANY AGE OR COUNTRY.&mdash; Now, what has been ob&s;erved, and what has not been ob&s;erved, in all ages and countries, pray how can you, Sir, or I, or any man, come to the knowledge of? Only I &s;uppo&s;e by te&s;timony, oral or written. The per&s;onal experience of every indi|vidual is limited to but a part of one age, and com|monly
<PB N="27" REF="022387_0036_0FB861EF7B241360">to a narrow &s;pot of one country. If there be any other way of being made acquainted with facts, 'tis to me, I own, an impenetrable &s;ecret; I have no apprehen&s;ion of it. If there be not any, what &s;hall we make of that cardinal point, on which his argument turns? 'Tis in plain language, <Q>Te&s;timo|ny is not intitled to the lea&s;t degree of faith, but as far as it is &s;upported by &s;uch an exten&s;ive expe|rience, as if we had not had a previous and inde|pendent faith in te&s;timony, we could never have acquired.</Q></P>
<P>How natural is the tran&s;ition from one &s;ophi&s;m to another! You will &s;oon be convinced of this, if you attend but a little to the &s;train of the argument. "A miracle," &s;ays he, <Q>is a violation of the laws of nature; and as a firm and unalterable expe|rience hath e&s;tabli&s;hed the&s;e laws, the proof again&s;t a miracle is as entire, as any argument from ex|perience can po&s;&s;ibly be imagined
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 180.</NOTE>.</Q> Again, <Q>As an uniform experience amounts to a proof, there is here a direct and full proof, from the na|ture of the fact, again&s;t the exi&s;tence of any mi|racle
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 181.</NOTE>.</Q> I mu&s;t once more a&s;k the author what is the preci&s;e meaning of the words <HI>firm, unalterable, uniform?</HI> An experience that admits no exception, is &s;urely the only experience, which can with propri|ety be termed <HI>uniform, firm, unalterable.</HI> Now &s;ince, as was remarked above, the far greater part of this experience, which compri&s;eth every age and every country, mu&s;t be derived to us from te&s;timony; that the experience may be <HI>firm, uniform, unalterable</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="022387_0037_0FB861F10A272EA0">there mu&s;t be no contrary te&s;timony whatever. Yet by the author's own hypothe&s;is, the miracles he would thus confute, are &s;upported by te&s;timony At the &s;ame time to give &s;trength to his argument, he is under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uppo&s;ing, that there is no ex|ception from the te&s;timonies again&s;t them. Thus he falls into that paralogi&s;m, which is called <HI>begging the que&s;tion.</HI> What he gives with one hand, he takes with the other. He admits, in opening his de&s;ign, what in his argument he implicitly denies.</P>
<P>But that this, if po&s;&s;ible, may be &s;till more mani|fe&s;t, let us attend a little to &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions, which one would imagine he had inadvertently dropt. "So long," &s;ays he, <Q>as the world endures, I pre|&s;ume, will the accounts of miracles and prodigies be found in all profane hi&s;tory
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 174.</NOTE>.</Q> Why does he pre&s;ume &s;o? A man &s;o much attached to experi|ence, can hardly be &s;u&s;pected to have any other rea|&s;on than, becau&s;e &s;uch accounts have hitherto been found in all the hi&s;tories, profane as well as &s;acred, of times pa&s;t. But we need not recur to an inference to obtain this acknowledgment. It is often to be met with in the e&s;&s;ay. In one place we learn, that the witne&s;&s;es for miracles are an infinite number
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">p: 190:</NOTE>; in another, that all religious records of whatever kind abound with them
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 191:</NOTE>. I leave it therefore to the author to explain, with what con&s;i&s;tency he can a&s;&s;ert, that the laws of nature are e&s;tabli&s;hed by an uniform experience, (which experience is chiefly the re&s;ult of te&s;timony) and at the &s;ame time allow, that almo&s;t all human hi&s;tories are full of the relations of
<PB N="29" REF="022387_0038_0FB861F5D9898960">miracles and prodigies, which are violations of tho&s;e laws. Here is, by his own confe&s;&s;ion, te&s;timony again&s;t te&s;timony, and very ample on both &s;ides. How then can one &s;ide claim a firm, uniform, and unalterable &s;upport from te&s;timony?</P>
<P>It will be in vain to object, that the te&s;timony in &s;upport of the laws of nature, greatly exceeds the te&s;timony for the violations of the&s;e laws; and that, if we are to be determined by the greater number of ob&s;ervations, we &s;hall reject all miracles whatever. I a&s;k, Why are the te&s;timonies much more nume|rous in the one ca&s;e than in the other? The an&s;wer is obvious: Natural occurrences are much more fre|quent than &s;uch as are preternatural. But are all the accounts we have of the pe&s;tilence to be rejected as incredible, becau&s;e, in this country, we hear not &s;o often of that di&s;ea&s;e, as of the fever? Or, becau&s;e the number of natural births is infinitely greater than that of mon&s;ters, &s;hall the evidence of the former be regarded as a confutation of all that can be advanced in proof of the latter? Such an objector needs to be reminded of what was proved in the foregoing &s;ecti|on; that the oppo&s;ite te&s;timonies relate to different facts, and are therefore not contradictory; that the conclu&s;ion founded on them, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth not the evi|dence of the facts on which it is founded, but only &s;uch a pre&s;umptive evidence, as may be &s;urmounted by the &s;lighte&s;t po&s;itive proof. A general conclu&s;ion from experience is in compari&s;on but pre&s;umptive and indirect; &s;ufficient te&s;timony for a particular fact is direct and po&s;itive evidence.</P>

I SHALL remark one other fallacy in this author's rea&s;oning, before I conclude this &s;ection. <Q>The In|dian prince,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>who refu&s;ed to believe the fir&s;t relations concerning the effects of fro&s;t, rea|&s;oned ju&s;tly; and it naturally required very &s;trong te&s;timony to engage his a&s;&s;ent to facts, which aro&s;e from a &s;tate of nature, with which he was unacquainted, and bore &s;o little analogy to tho&s;e events, of which he had had con&s;tant and uniform experience.

<P>If my reader happen to be but little acquainted with Mr Hume's writings, or even with the piece here examined, I mu&s;t intreat him, ere he proceed any farther, to give the e&s;&s;ay an attentive peru&s;al; and to take notice particularly, whether in one &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age, he can find any other &s;en&s;e given to the terms <HI>contrary to experience,</HI> but that which has <HI>not</HI> been <HI>experienced.</HI> Without this aid, I &s;hould not be &s;urpri&s;ed, that I found it difficult to convince the judicious, that a man of &s;o much acutene&s;s, one &s;o much a philo&s;opher as this author, &s;hould, with &s;uch formality, make a di&s;tinction, which not only the e&s;&s;ay, but the whole tenour of his philo&s;ophical writings, &s;hows evidently to have no meaning. Is
<PB N="31" REF="022387_0040_0FB861FA8A797138">that which is contrary to experience a &s;ynonymous phra&s;e for that which implies a contradiction? If this were the ca&s;e, there would be no need to recur to experience for a refutation; it would refute it&s;elf. But 'tis equitable that the author him&s;elf be heard, who ought to be the be&s;t interpreter of his own words. "When the fact atte&s;ted," &s;ays he, <Q>is &s;uch a one, as has &s;eldom fallen under our ob&s;ervation, here is a conte&s;t of two oppo&s;ite experiences
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 179.</NOTE>.</Q> In this pa&s;&s;|age, not the being <HI>never</HI> experienced, but even the be|ing <HI>&s;eldom</HI> experienced con&s;titutes an <HI>oppo&s;ite</HI> experience.

In order to pre|clude &s;uch an attempt, I &s;hall once more recur to his own authority. <Q>'Tis no miracle that a man in &s;eeming good health, &s;hould die of a &s;udden.</Q> Why? <Q>Becau&s;e &s;uch a kind of death, tho' more unu&s;ual than any other, hath yet been frequently ob&s;erved to happen. But 'tis a miracle that a dead man &s;hould come to life,</Q> Why? Not becau&s;e of any incon&s;i&s;tency in the thing. That a body &s;hould be this hour inanimate, and the next animated, is no more incon&s;i&s;tent, than the rever&s;e that it &s;hould be this hour animated, and the next inanimate; though the one be common, and not the other. But the author him&s;elf an&s;wers the que&s;tion: <Q>Becau&s;e that has never been ob&s;erved in any age or country
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 181.</NOTE>.</Q> All the contrariety then that there is in miracles to experience, doth, by his own conce&s;&s;i|on,
<PB N="32" REF="022387_0041_0FB861FC10B102A0">con&s;i&s;t &s;olely in this, that they have never been ob&s;erved; that is, they are not conformable to expe|rience, To his experience per&s;onal or derived, he mu&s;t certainly mean; to what he has had acce&s;s to learn of different ages and countries. To &s;peak beyond the knowledge he hath attained, would be ridiculous. It would be fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ing a miracle, and then inferring a contrary experience, in&s;tead of concluding from experience, that the fact is miraculous.</P>
<P>Now, I in&s;i&s;t, that as far as regards the author's argument, a fact perfectly unu&s;ual, or not conformable to our experience, &s;uch a fact as, for aught we have had acce&s;s to learn, was never ob&s;erved in any age or country, is as incapable of proof from te&s;timony, as miracles are; that, if this writer would argue con&s;i&s;tently, he could never, on his own principles, reject the one and admit the other. Both ought to be rejected or neither. I would not, by this be thought to &s;ignify, that there is no difference between a miracle and an extraordinary event: I know that the former implies the interpo&s;al of an invi&s;ible agent, which is not implied in the latter. All that I intend to a &s;ert is, that the anthor's argument equally affects them both. Why doth &s;uch interpo&s;al appear to him incredible? Not from any incongruity he di&s;cerns in the thing it&s;elf. He doth not pretend it. But 'tis not conformable to his experience. "A miracle," "&s;ays he," is a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law of nature
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 182. in the note.</NOTE>," But how are the laws of nature known to us? By experience. What is the criterion, whereby we mu&s;t
<PB N="33" REF="022387_0042_0FB861FD8C543448">judge, whether the laws of nature are tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed? Solely the conformity or di&s;conformity of events to our experience. This writer &s;urely will not pretend, that we can have any knowledge <HI>a priori,</HI> either of the law, or of the violation.</P>
<P>Let us then examine by his own principles, whe|ther the King of Siam, of whom the &s;tory he alludes to, is related by Locke
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on human under&s;tanding, book 4. chap. 2. &sect; 5.</NOTE>, could have &s;ufficient evidence from te&s;timony, of a fact &s;o contrary to his experience as the freezing of water. He could ju&s;t &s;ay as much of this event, as the author can &s;ay of a dead man's being re&s;tored to life. <Q>Such a thing was never ob|&s;erved, as far as I could learn, in any age or country.</Q> If the things them&s;elves too are imparti|ally con&s;idered and independently of the notions ac|quired by us in the&s;e northern climates, we &s;hould account the fir&s;t at lea&s;t as extraordinary as the &s;econd. That &s;o pliant a body as water &s;hould become hard like pavement, &s;o as to bear up an elephant on its &s;ur|face, is as unlikely in it&s;elf, as that a body inanimate to-day &s;hould be animated to-morrow. Nay, to the Indian monarch, I mu&s;t think, that the fir&s;t would appear more a miracle, more contrary to experience than the &s;econd. If he had been acquainted with <HI>ice</HI> or frozen water, and afterwards &s;een it become fluid; but had never &s;een nor learned, that after it was melted, it became hard again, the relation mu&s;t have appeared marvellous, as the proce&s;s from fluidity to hardne&s;s never had been experienced, tho' the rever&s;e often had. But I believe nobody will que|&s;tion,
<PB N="34" REF="022387_0043_0FB8620377FCFA30">that on this &s;uppo&s;ition it would not have ap|peared quite &s;o &s;trange, as it did.

<P>What hath been above deduced, how much &s;oever it be accounted, is not all that is implied in the con|ce&s;&s;ion made by the author.

Great indeed, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, is
<PB N="43" REF="022387_0052_0FB86218CD3ACF70">the force of truth.

<P>'TIS therefore manife&s;t, that either this author's principles condemn his own method of judging, with regard to miraculous facts; or that his method of judging &s;ubverts his principles, and is a tacit de&s;ertion of them.

<P>As to the fir&s;t method, by which the author ac|counts for the fabulous relations of mon&s;ters and pro|digies, 'tis freely acknowledged, that the Creator hath implanted in human nature, as a &s;pur to the improve|ment of the under&s;tanding, a principle of <HI>curio&s;ity,</HI> which makes the mind feel a particular plea&s;ure in every new acqui&s;ition of knowledge.

<P>But the pre&s;umption that hence ari&s;eth again&s;t the marvellous is not &s;tronger in the ca&s;e of miracles (as will appear from an attentive peru&s;al of the &s;econd &s;ection) than in the ca&s;e of every fact that is perfectly extraordinary.

<P>But there is one circum&s;tance, which he hath o|verlooked, and which is neverthele&s;s of the greate&s;t con&s;equence in the debate. It is this, that the pre|judice re&s;ulting from the religious affection, may ju&s;t as readily <HI>ob&s;truct,</HI> as <HI>promote</HI> our faith in a reli|gious miracle. What things in nature are more con|trary, than one religion is to another religion? They are ju&s;t as contrary as light and darkne&s;s, truth and error. The affections, with which they are contem|plated by the &s;ame per&s;on, are ju&s;t as oppo&s;ite, as
<PB N="51" REF="022387_0060_0FB8622FDD07D2E0">de&s;ire and aver&s;ion, love and hatred. The &s;ame re|ligious zeal which gives the mind of a Chri&s;tian, a <HI>propen&s;ity</HI> to the belief of a miracle in &s;upport of Chri&s;tianity, will in&s;pire him with an <HI>aver&s;ion</HI> from the belief of a miracle in &s;upport of Mahometi&s;m.

<P>Before then the remark of the author can be of any u&s;e in directing our judgment, as to the evidence of miracles atte&s;ted, we mu&s;t con&s;ider whether the original tenets of the witne&s;&s;es would naturally have bla&s;&s;ed their m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nds in <HI>favour</HI> of the miracles, or in <HI>oppo&s;ition</HI> to them.

To an&s;wer thus would be to mi&s;under&s;tand the point. The que&s;tion is, Was this doctrine the faith of the witne&s;&s;es, before they &s;aw, or fancied they &s;aw the miracles? If it was, I agree with him. Great, very great allowance mu&s;t be made for the prejudices of education, for principles, early perhaps, carefully, and deeply roote<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in their minds, and for the religious affection founded in the&s;e principles; which allowance mu&s;t always derogate from the weight of their te&s;timony. But if the faith of the witne&s;&s;es &s;tood originally in oppo&s;ition to the doctrine
<PB N="52" REF="022387_0061_0FB8623164CEED88">atte&s;ted by the miracles; if the only account that can be given of their conver&s;ion, is the conviction which the miracles produced in them; it mu&s;t be a prepo&s;terous way of arguing, to derive their convic|tion from a religious zeal, which would at fir&s;t ob|&s;tinately with&s;tand, and for &s;ome time hinder &s;uch conviction. On the contrary, that the evidence ari|&s;ing from miracles performed in proof of a doctrine di&s;believed, and con&s;equently hated before, did in fact &s;urmount that ob&s;tacle, and conquer all the op|po&s;ition ari&s;ing thence, is a very &s;trong pre&s;umption in favour of that evidence: ju&s;t as &s;trong a pre&s;ump|tion in its favour, as it would have been again&s;t it, had all their former zeal, and principles, and preju|dices, co-operated with the evidence, whatever it was, in gaining an entire a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>Hence there is the greate&s;t di&s;parity in this re&s;pect, a di&s;parity which de&s;erves to be particularly attended to, betwixt the evidence of miracles performed in proof of a religion <HI>to be</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed, and in <HI>contradic|tion</HI> to opinions generally received; and the evidence of miracles performed in &s;upport of a religion <HI>already</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed, and in <HI>confirmation</HI> of opinions generally received.

<P>THERE is then no peculiar pre&s;umption again&s;t re|ligious miracles merely as &s;uch; if in certain cir|cum&s;tances there is a pre&s;umption again&s;t them; the pre&s;umption ari&s;eth &s;olely from the circum&s;tances, in&s;omuch that, in the oppo&s;ite circum&s;tances, it is as &s;trongly in their favour.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. <HI>There is a peculiar pre&s;umption in favour of &s;uch miracles as are &s;aid to have been wrought in &s;upport of religion.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN this &s;ection I propo&s;e to con&s;ider the rever&s;e of the que&s;tion treated in the former. In the former I proved that there is no peculiar pre&s;umption again&s;t religious miracles; I now inquire whether there be any in their favour. The que&s;tion is important, and intimately connected with the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>THE bolde&s;t infidel will not deny, that the immortality of the &s;oul, a future and eternal &s;tate, and the connection of our happine&s;s or mi&s;ery in that &s;tate, with our pre&s;ent good or bad conduct, not to mention the doctrines concerning the divine unity and perfec|tions, are tenets which carry no ab&s;urdity in them. They may be true for aught he knows. He di&s;|believes them, not becau&s;e they are incredible in them&s;elves, but becau&s;e he hath not evidence of their truth. He pretends not to di&s;prove them, nor does he think the ta&s;k incumbent on him. He only pleads, that before he can yield them his a&s;&s;ent, they mu&s;t be proved.</P>
<P>Now, as whatever is po&s;&s;ible, may be &s;uppo&s;ed, let us &s;uppo&s;e that the dogmas above mentioned are all infallible truths; and let the unbeliever &s;ay, whether he can conceive an object worthier of the Divine in|terpo&s;al, than to reveal the&s;e truths to mankind? and
<PB N="54" REF="022387_0063_0FB862344D30B198">to enforce them in &s;uch a manner, as may give them a &s;uitable influence on the heart and life. Of all the inhabitants of the earth, man is incomparably the noble&s;t. Whatever therefore regards the intere&s;t of the human &s;pecies, is a grander concern, than what regards either the inanimate or the brute creation. If man was made, as is doubtle&s;s not impo&s;&s;ible, for an after &s;tate of immorality; whatever relates to that immortal &s;tate, or may conduce to prepare him for the fruition of it, mu&s;t be immen&s;ely &s;uperior to that which concerns merely the tran&s;ient en|joyments of the pre&s;ent life. How &s;ublime then is the object which religion, and religion only, exhi|bits as the ground of &s;upernatural interpo&s;itions! This object is no other than the intere&s;t of man, a rea&s;onable and moral agent, the only being in this lower world which bears in his &s;oul the image of his Maker; not the intere&s;t of an individual, but of the kind; not for a limited duration, but for eternity: an object at lea&s;t in one re&s;pect adequate to the ma|je&s;ty of God.</P>
<P>Does this appear to the e&s;&s;ayi&s;t too much like ar|guing <HI>a priori,</HI> of which I know he hath a dete&s;tation? It is ju&s;t &s;uch an argument, as, pre&s;uppo&s;ing the mo&s;t rational principles of Dei&s;m, re&s;ults from tho&s;e max|ims concerning intelligent cau&s;es, and their operations, which are founded in general experience, and which uniformly lead us to expect, that the end will be pro|portionate to the means. The <HI>Pagans</HI> of Rome had notions of their divinities infinitely inferior to the opi|nions concerning God, which in Chri&s;tian countries are maintained even by tho&s;e, who, for di&s;tinction's
<PB N="55" REF="022387_0064_0FB86236482E3D00">&s;ake, are called DEISTS. Yet &s;uch of the former as had any ju&s;tne&s;s of ta&s;te, were offended with tho&s;e po|ets, who, exhibited the cele&s;tials on &s;light occa&s;ions, and for trivial purpo&s;es, interfering in the affairs of men. Why? Becau&s;e &s;uch an exhibition &s;hocked all the principles of probability. It had not that veri|&s;imilitude which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to render fic|tion agreeable. Accordingly it is a precept, with re|lation to the machinery of the drama, given by one who was both a critic and a poet, <HI>That a god mu&s;t never be introduced, unle&s;s to accompli&s;h &s;ome important de&s;ign which could not be otherwi&s;e effectuated</HI>

<P>THUS it appears, that from the dignity of the end, there ari&s;eth a peculiar pre&s;umption in favour of &s;uch miracles, as are &s;aid to have been wrought in &s;upport of religion.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VI. <HI>Inquiry into the meaning and propriety of one of Mr Hume's favourite maxims.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE is a method truly curious, &s;ugge&s;ted by the author, for extricating the mind, &s;hould the evidence from te&s;timony be &s;o great, that its fal&s;e|hood
<PB N="56" REF="022387_0065_0FB86238077EA3E0">might, as he terms it, be accounted miraculous. In this puzzling ca&s;e, when a man is &s;o be&s;et with miracles, that he is under a nece&s;&s;ity of admitting one, he mu&s;t always take care it be the &s;malle&s;t; for it is an <HI>axiom</HI> in this writers DIALECTIC, That <HI>the probability of the fact is in the inver&s;e ratio of the quantity of miracle there is in it.</HI> "I weigh," &s;ays he, <Q>the one miracle again&s;t the other, and according to the &s;upe|riority which I di&s;cover, I pronounce my deci&s;ion, and always reject the greater miracle
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 182.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Now, of this method, which will no doubt be thought by many to be very ingenious, and which appears to the e&s;&s;ayi&s;t both very momentous and very per&s;picuous, I own, I am not able to di&s;cover either the rea&s;onablene&s;s or the u&s;e.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I cannot &s;ee the rea&s;onablene&s;s. 'A miracle,' to adopt his own definition, <Q>implies the tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion,</Q> or rather the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, <Q>of &s;ome law of na|ture; and that either by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the interpo&s;al of &s;ome invi&s;ible agent
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. in the note.</NOTE>.</Q> Now, as I &s;hould think, from the principles laid down in the preceding &s;ection, that it would be for no trifling purpo&s;e, that the laws of nature would be &s;u&s;pended, and either the Deity or an invi&s;ible agent would interpo&s;e; 'tis on the &s;ame principles, natural to imagine, that the means, or miracle performed, &s;hould bear a proportion in re&s;pect of dignity and greatne&s;s, to the end propo&s;ed. Were I therefore under &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ity as is &s;uppo&s;ed by Mr Hume, of ad|mitting
<PB N="57" REF="022387_0066_0FB8623F77A85A20">the truth of a miracle, I acknowledge, that of two contradictory miracles, where all other circum|&s;tances are equal, I &s;hould think it rea&s;onable to be|lieve the greater. I &s;hall borrow an illu&s;tration from the author him&s;elf. "A miracle," he &s;ays, <Q>may either be <HI>di&s;coverable</HI> by men or not. This alters not its nature and e&s;&s;ence. The rai&s;ing of a hou&s;e or &s;hip into the air is a vi&s;ible miracle; the rai&s;ing of a feather, when the wind wants <HI>ever &s;o little</HI> of a force requi&s;ite for that purpo&s;e is as real a miracle, tho' not &s;o <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> with regard to us
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 182. in the note.</NOTE>.</Q> Surely if any miracle may be called <HI>little,</HI> the la&s;t mentioned is intitled to that denomination, not only becau&s;e it is an <HI>undi&s;coverable</HI> and <HI>in&s;en&s;ible</HI> miracle, but becau&s;e the quantum of miraculous force requi&s;ite, is, by the hypothe&s;is, <HI>ever &s;o little,</HI> or the lea&s;t conceivable. Yet if it were certain, that God, angel, or &s;pirit, were, for one of tho&s;e purpo&s;es, to interpo&s;e in &s;u&s;|pending the laws of nature; I believe mo&s;t men would join with me in thinking, that it would be ra|ther for the rai&s;ing of a <HI>hou&s;e</HI> or <HI>&s;hip</HI> than for the rai|&s;ing of a <HI>feather.</HI></P>
<P>But though the maxim laid down by the author were ju&s;t, I cannot di&s;cover in what in&s;tance, or by what application, it can be rendered of any utility. Why? Becau&s;e we have no rule, whereby we can judge of the greatne&s;s of miracles. I allow, that in &s;uch a &s;ingular in&s;tance, as that above quoted from the e&s;&s;ay, we may judge &s;afely enough. But that can be of no practical u&s;e. In almo&s;t every ca&s;e that
<PB N="58" REF="022387_0067_0FB86240F8404C90">will occur, I may warrantably aver, that it will be impo&s;&s;ible for the acute&s;t intellect to decide, which of the two is the greater miracle. As to the author, I cannot find that he has favoured us with any light in &s;o important and &s;o critical a que&s;tion. Have we not then &s;ome rea&s;on to dread, that the ta&s;k will not be le&s;s difficult to furni&s;h us with a <HI>mea&s;ure,</HI> by which we can determine the magnitude of miracles; than to provide us with a <HI>balance,</HI> by which we can a&s;certain the comparative weight of te&s;timonies and experiences?</P>
<P>If leaving the &s;peculations of the e&s;&s;ayi&s;t, we &s;hall, in order to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted on this &s;ubject, recur to his ex|ample and deci&s;ions: let us con&s;ider the miracle which was recited in the third &s;ection, and which he declares, would, on the evidence of &s;uch te&s;timony as he &s;uppo&s;es, not only be probable, but certain. For my part, 'tis not in my power to conceive a great|ter miracle than that is. The whole univer&s;e is af|fected by it; the earth, the &s;un, the moon, the &s;tars. The mo&s;t invariable laws of nature with which we are acquainted, even tho&s;e which regulate the mo|tions of the heavenly bodies, and di&s;pen&s;e darkne&s;s and light to worlds, are violated. I appeal to the author him&s;elf, whether it could be called a great|er, or even &s;o great a miracle, that all the writers at that time, or even all mankind, had been &s;eized with a new &s;pecies of epidemical delirium, which had given ri&s;e to this &s;trange illu&s;ion. But in this the au|thor is remarkably unfortunate, that the principles by which he in fact regulates his judgment and belief,
<PB N="59" REF="022387_0068_0FB86241C973D0A8">are often the rever&s;e of tho&s;e which he endeavours to e&s;tabli&s;h in his theory.</P>
<P>SHALL I hazard a conjecture? It is, that the word <HI>miracle,</HI> as thus u&s;ed by the author, is u&s;ed in a vague and improper &s;en&s;e, as a &s;ynonymous term for <HI>improbable;</HI> and that believing the <HI>le&s;s,</HI> and reject|ing the <HI>greater miracle,</HI> denote &s;imply believing what is <HI>lea&s;t,</HI> and rejecting what is <HI>mo&s;t improbable;</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;till more explicitly believing what we think <HI>mo&s;t worthy of belief,</HI> and rejecting what we think <HI>lea&s;t worthy.</HI> I am aware, on a &s;econd peru&s;al of the author's words, that my talent in gue&s;&s;ing may be ju&s;tly que&s;tioned. He hath in effect told us him&s;elf what he means. "When any one," &s;ays he, <Q>tells me, that he &s;aw a dead man re&s;tored to life, I immediately con&s;ider with my&s;elf, whether it be more <HI>probable,</HI> that this per&s;on &s;hould either deceive or be deceived, or that the fact he relates, &s;hould really have happened. I weigh the one <HI>miracle</HI> again&s;t the other; and according to the &s;uperiority which I di&s;cover, I pronounce my deci&s;ion, and always reject the greater miracle.

The whole difference between the e&s;&s;ayi&s;t and us, is at length reduced to this &s;ingle point, Whether greater or &s;maller miracles are intitled to the prefer|ence.

<HEAD>A DISSERTATION ON MIRACLES. PART II. The miracles on which the belief of Chri&s;tianity is founded, are &s;ufficiently atte&s;ted.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. <HI>There is no pre&s;umption, ari&s;ing from human nature, again&s;t the miracles &s;aid to have been wrought in proof of Chri&s;tianity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FROM what hath been evinced in the fourth and fifth &s;ections of the former part, with regard to religion in general, <HI>two corollaries</HI> are clearly deducible in fa|vour of Chri&s;tianity. <HI>One</HI> is, That the pre&s;umption ari&s;ing from the dignity of the end, to &s;ay the lea&s;t of it, can in no religion be pleaded with greater advan|tage, than in the Chri&s;tian. <HI>The other</HI> is, That the pre&s;umption ari&s;ing from the religious affection, in|&s;tead of weakening, corroborates the evidence of the go&s;pel. The faith of Je&s;us was promulgated, and gained ground, not with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but in de|fiance, of all the religious zeal and prejudices of the times.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="022387_0072_0FB8625011DB74F8">
IN order to invalidate the <HI>&s;econd</HI> corollary, it will po&s;&s;ibly be urged, that pro&s;elytes to a new religion, may be gained at fir&s;t; either by addre&s;s and elo|quence, or by the appearances of uncommon &s;anctity, and rapturous fervours of devotion; that if once people have commenced pro&s;elytes, the tran&s;ition to enthu&s;ia&s;m is almo&s;t unavoidable; and that enthu|&s;ia&s;m will fully account for the utmo&s;t pitch both of credulity and fal&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>Admitting that a few converts might be made by the afore&s;aid arts, it is &s;ubver&s;ive of all the laws of probability, to imagine, that the &s;tronge&s;t prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, fortified with that vehement abhorence which contradiction in religions principles rarely &s;ails to excite, &s;hould be &s;o ea&s;ily vanqui&s;hed in multi|tudes. Be&s;ides, the very pretext of &s;upporting the doctrine by miracles, if a fal&s;e pretext, would of ne|ce&s;&s;ity do un&s;peakable hurt to the cau&s;e. The pre|tence of miracles will quickly attract the attention of all to whom the new doctrine is publi&s;hed. The influence which addre&s;s and eloquence, appearances of &s;anctity and fervours of devotion, would otherwi&s;e have had, however great, will be &s;uper&s;eded by the con&s;ideration of what is infinitely more &s;triking and deci&s;ive. The miracles will therefore fir&s;t be can|va&s;&s;ed, and canva&s;&s;ed with a temper of mind the mo&s;t unfavourable to conviction. 'Tis not &s;olely on the te&s;timony of the evangeli&s;ts that Chri&s;tians be|lieve the go&s;pel, tho' that te&s;timony appears in all re&s;pects &s;uch as merits the highe&s;t regard; but it is on the &s;ucce&s;s of the go&s;pel; it is on the te&s;timony, as we may ju&s;ty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the numberle&s;s pro&s;elytes
<PB N="64" REF="022387_0073_0FB8625191AB25C8">that were made to a religon, oppo&s;ing all the religi|ous profe&s;&s;ions then in the world, and appealing, for the &s;atisfaction of every body, to the vi&s;ible and miraculous interpo&s;ition of Heaven in its favour. The witne&s;&s;es con&s;idered in this light, and in this light they ought to be con&s;idered, will be found more than 'a &s;ufficient number:' and tho' perhaps there were few of them, what the author would deno|minate 'men of education and learning;' yet, which is more e&s;&s;ential, they were generally men of good &s;en&s;e, and knowledge enough to &s;ecure them again&s;t all delu&s;ion, as to tho&s;e plain facts for which they gave their te&s;timony; men who, (in the common acceptation of the words) neither did, nor could derive to them&s;elves either intere&s;t or honour by their atte&s;tations, but did thereby, on the contrary, evi|dently abandon all hopes of both.</P>
<P>It de&s;erves al&s;o to be remembered, that there is here no contradictory te&s;timony, notwith&s;tanding that both the founder of our religion, and his adhe|rents, were from the fir&s;t &s;urrounded by inveterate enemies, who never <Q>e&s;teemed the matter too in|con&s;iderable to de&s;erve their attention or regard;</Q> and who, as they could not want the means, gave evident proofs that they wanted not the inclination to detect the fraud, if there had been any fraud to be detected. They were jealous of their own reputa|tion and authority, and fore&s;aw but too clearly, that the &s;ucce&s;s of Je&s;us would give a fatal blow to both. As to the te&s;timonies them&s;elves, we may permit the author to try them by his own rules
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 173.</NOTE>.
<PB N="65" REF="022387_0074_0FB86253CB3B84D0">There is here no oppo&s;ition of te&s;timony; there is no apparent ground of &s;u&s;picion from the character of the witne&s;&s;es; there is no intere&s;t which they could have in impo&s;ing on the world; there is not a &s;mall number of witne&s;&s;es, they are innumerable. Do the hi&s;torians of our Lord deliver their te&s;timony with doubt and he&s;itation? Do they fall into the op|po&s;ite extreme of u&s;ing too violent a&s;&s;everations? So far from both, that the mo&s;t amazing in&s;tances of divine power, and the mo&s;t intere&s;ting events, are related without any cen&s;ure or reflection of the wri|ters on per&s;ons, parties, actions, or opinions; with &s;uch an unparallelled and unaffected &s;implicity, as demon&s;trates, that they were neither them&s;elves ani|mated by pa&s;&s;ion like enthu&s;ia&s;ts, nor had any de&s;ign of working on the pa&s;&s;ions of their readers. The greate&s;t miracles are recorded, with as little appear|ance either of doubt or wonder in the writer, and with as little &s;u&s;picion of the reader's incredulity, as the mo&s;t ordinary incidents: A manner as unlike that of impo&s;tors as of enthu&s;ia&s;ts; a manner in which tho&s;e writers are altogether &s;ingular; and I will add a manner which can on no &s;uppo&s;ion be tolerably ac|counted for, but that of the truth, and not of the truth only, but of the notoriety, of the events which they re|lated. They &s;poke like people, who had them&s;elves been long familiarized to &s;uch acts of omnipotence and grace. They &s;poke like people, who knew that ma|ny of the mo&s;t marvellous actions they related, had been &s;o publicly performed, and in the pre&s;ence of multitudes alive at the time of their writing, as to be uncontrovertible, and as in fact not to have been con|verted,
<PB N="66" REF="022387_0075_0FB86255D5ABA350">even by their bittere&s;t foes. They could bold|ly appeal on this head to their enemies. <HI>A man,</HI> &s;ay they, &s;paking of their ma&s;ter

<P>BUT pa&s;&s;ing the manner in which the fir&s;t pro&s;elytes may be gained to a new religion, and &s;uppo&s;ing &s;ome actually gained, no matter how to the faith of Je&s;us; can it be ea&s;ily accounted for, that, even with the help of tho&s;e early converts, this religion &s;hould have been propagated in the world, on the <HI>fal&s;e</HI> pretence of miracles? Nothing more ea&s;ily, &s;ays the author. Tho&s;e original propagators of the go&s;pel have been deceived them&s;elves; for <Q>a religioni&s;t may be an <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;t,</HI> and imagine he &s;ees what has no reality
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 185.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Were this admitted, it would not in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, remove the difficulty. He mu&s;t not only him&s;elf imagine he &s;ees what has no reality, he mu&s;t make every body pre&s;ent, tho&s;e who are no en|thu&s;ia&s;ts, nor even friends, nay he mu&s;t make enemies al&s;o imagine they &s;ee the &s;ame thing which he ima|gines
<PB N="67" REF="022387_0076_0FB8625A4A739D08">he &s;ees; for the miracles of Je&s;us were ac|acknowledged by tho&s;e who per&s;ecuted him.</P>
<P>That an <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;t</HI> is very liable to be impo&s;ed on, in whatever favours the particular &s;pecies of enthu|&s;ia&s;m, with which he is affected, none, who knows any thing of the human heart, will deny. But &s;till this frailty hath its limits. For my own part, I cannot find examples of any, even among enthu|&s;ia&s;ts, (unle&s;s to the conviction of every body they were di&s;tracted) who did not &s;ee and hear in the &s;ame manner as other people. Many of this tribe have mi&s;taken the reveries of a heated imagination, for the communications of the Divine Spirit, who never, in one &s;ingle in&s;tance, mi&s;took the operations of their external &s;en&s;es. Without marking this difference, we &s;hould make no di&s;tinction between the <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;tic</HI> character and the <HI>frantic,</HI> which are in them&s;elves evidently di&s;tinct. How &s;hall we then account from <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> for the te&s;timony given by the apo&s;tles, concerning the re&s;urrection of their ma&s;ter, and his a&s;cen&s;ion into heaven, not to mention innumerable other facts? In the&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible that any, who in the u&s;e of their rea&s;on were but one remove from <HI>Bedlamites,</HI> &s;hould have been deceived. Yet, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the unbeliever mu&s;t even &s;ay more than this, and, accumulating ab&s;urdity upon ab&s;urdity, mu&s;t affirm, that the apo&s;tles were deceived as to the re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion of their ma&s;ter, notwith|&s;tanding that they them&s;elves had concerted the plan of &s;tealing his body, and concealing it.</P>
<P>BUT this is not the only re&s;ource of the infidel. If he is driven from this &s;trong hold, he can take refuge

Admit the apo&s;tles were not deceived them&s;elves, they may neverthele&s;s have been, thro' mere devotion and benevolence, incited to deceive the re&s;t of mankind.

<P>Our religion, to u&s;e its own nervous language, teacheth us
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job. xiii. 7, 8.</NOTE>, that we ought not to lie, or <HI>&s;peak wickedly,</HI> not even <HI>for God;</HI> that we ought not to <HI>accept his per&s;on</HI> in judgment, or <HI>talk,</HI> or act <HI>deceitfully for him.</HI> But &s;o very little, it mu&s;t be owned, has this &s;entiment been attended to, even in the Chri&s;tian world, that one would almo&s;t think, it contained a &s;train of virtue too &s;ublime for the apprehen&s;ion of the multitude. 'Tis therefore a fact not to be que&s;|tioned, that little pious frauds, as they are ab&s;urdly, not to &s;ay impiou&s;ly, called, have been often prac|ti&s;ed by ignorant zealots in &s;upport of a cau&s;e, which they firmly believed to be both true and holy. But in all &s;uch ca&s;es the truth and holine&s;s of the cau&s;e are wholly independent of tho&s;e artifices. A per&s;on may be per&s;uaded of the former, who is too clear-&s;ighted to be deceived by the latter: for even a full conviction of the truth of the cau&s;e is not, in the lea&s;t, incon&s;i&s;tent with either the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, or the detection of the frauds u&s;ed in &s;upport of it. In the Romi&s;h church, for example, there are many zealous and orthodox believers, who are neverthele&s;s incapable of being impo&s;ed on by the lying wonders, which &s;ome of their clergy have exhibited. The cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="69" REF="022387_0078_0FB8625F0F7A43D8">of the apo&s;tles were widely different from the circum&s;tances, either of tho&s;e believers, or of their clergy. Some of the miraculous events which the apo&s;tles atte&s;ted, were not only the <HI>evidences,</HI> but the di&s;tingui&s;hing <HI>doctrines</HI> of the religion which they taught. There is therefore in their ca&s;e an ab&s;olute incon&s;i&s;tency betwix a conviction of the truth of the cau&s;e, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the frauds u&s;ed in &s;upport of it.

<P>Not to mention, that &s;uch a towering ambition was but ill adapted to the mean rank, poor education, and habitual circum&s;tances, of &s;uch men as the Apo|&s;tles mo&s;tly had been; a de&s;ire of that kind, what|ever wonders it may effectuate when &s;upported by enthu&s;ia&s;m, and faith, and zeal, mu&s;t &s;oon have been cru&s;hed by the outward, and to human appearance in&s;urmountable difficulties and di&s;tre&s;&s;es they had to encounter; when quite un&s;upported from within by either faith, or hope, or the te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience; rather, I &s;hould have &s;aid, when they them&s;elves were haunted from within by a con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of the blacke&s;t guilt, impiety, and ba&s;ene&s;s.

<P>I &s;hall then examine impartially this bold a&s;&s;ertion, That <Q>men in all ages have been much impo&s;ed on,
<PB N="74" REF="022387_0083_0FB8626A788EE5A8">by ridiculous &s;tories of miracles a&s;cribed to new &s;y&s;|tems of religion.</Q> For my part, I am fully &s;atisfied, that there is not the &s;hadow of truth in it: and I am utterly at a lo&s;s to conceive what could induce an author &s;o well ver&s;ed in the annals both of ancient and mo|dern times as Mr Hume, in &s;uch a po&s;itive manner to advance it. I believe it will require no elaborate di&s;|qui&s;ition to evince, that the&s;e two, JUDAISM and CHRISTANITY, are of all that have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, or now &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the world, the only religions, which claim to have been attended in their fir&s;t publication with the evidence of <HI>miracles.</HI> It de&s;erves al&s;o to be remarked, that it is more in conformity to common language, and incidental di&s;tinctions which have ari&s;en, than to &s;trict propriety, that I call Judai&s;m and Chri&s;tanity, two religions. 'Tis true, the Jewi&s;h creed, in the days of our Saviour, having been corrupted by rabbinical tra|ditions, &s;tood in many re&s;pects, and at this day &s;tands in direct oppo&s;ition to the Go&s;pel. But it is not in this acceptation that I u&s;e the word Judai&s;m. Such a creed, I am &s;en&s;ible, we can no more denominate the doctrine of the <HI>Old Te&s;tament,</HI> than we can denominate the creed of Pope Pius the doctrine of the <HI>New.</HI> And truly the fate which both in&s;titutions, that of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and that of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> have met with among men, hath been in many re&s;pects extremely &s;imilar. But when, on the contrary, we con&s;ider the religion of the Jews, not as the &s;y&s;tem of faith and practice, which pre&s;ently obtains, or heretofore hath obtained among that people; but &s;olely as the religion that is revealed in <HI>the law and the prophets,</HI> we mu&s;t acknow|ledge, that in this in&s;titution are contained the rudi|ments

<P>CAN the PAGAN religion, can, I &s;hould rather &s;ay, any of the numberle&s;s religions (for they are totally di&s;tinct) known by the common name of <HI>Pagan,</HI> produce any claim of this kind that will me|rit our attention? If the author knows of any, I wi&s;h he had mentioned it; for in all antiquity, as far as my acquaintance with it reacheth, I can recollect no &s;uch claim. However, that I may not, on the one hand, appear to pa&s;s the matter too &s;lightly; or, on the other, lo&s;e my&s;elf, as Mr Hume expre&s;&s;es it, in too wide a field; I &s;hall briefly con&s;ider, whether the ancient religions of <HI>Greece</HI> or <HI>Rome</HI> (which of all the &s;pecies of heatheni&s;h &s;uper&s;tition are on many ac|counts the mo&s;t remarkable) can pre&s;ent a claim of this nature.

<P>If one &s;hould talk in this manner, I mu&s;t remind him, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that the&s;e are by no means exhibited as EVIDENCES, but as the THEOLOGY it&s;elf; the poets always u&s;ing the &s;ame affirmative &s;tyle concerning what pa&s;&s;ed in heaven, in hell, and in the ocean, where men could not be &s;pectators, as concerning what pa&s;&s;ed upon the earth: <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> that all tho&s;e mythological tales are confe&s;&s;edly recorded many cen|turies after they are &s;uppo&s;ed to have happened; no voucher, no te&s;timony, nothing that can de&s;erve the name of evidence having been produced, or even al|ledged, in proof of them; <HI>thirdly,</HI> that the intention of the writers &s;eems to be &s;olely the amu&s;ement, not the conviction of their readers; that accordingly no writer &s;cruples to model the mythology to his par|ticular ta&s;te, or rather caprice; but con&s;idering this as a province &s;ubject to the laws of Parna&s;&s;us, all agree in arrogating here the immemorial privilege of poets, to &s;ay and feign, unque&s;tioned, what they plea&s;e; and <HI>fourthly,</HI> that at lea&s;t &s;everal of their narrations are al|legorical, and as plainly intended to convey &s;ome phy&s;ical or moral in&s;truction, as any of the apologues of Ae&s;op. But to have &s;aid even thus much in refuta|tion of &s;o ab&s;urd a plea, will perhaps to many readers appear &s;uperfluous.</P>
<P>LEAVING therefore the endle&s;s ab&s;urdities and in|coherent fictions of idolaters, I &s;hall inquire, in the next place, whether the MAHOMETAN wor&s;hip
<PB N="77" REF="022387_0086_0FB8626F92804848">(which in its &s;peculative principles appears more rati|onal) pretends to have been built on the evidence of miracles.</P>
<P>Mahomet, the founder of this profe&s;&s;ion, openly and frequently, as all the world knows, di&s;claimed &s;uch evidence. He frankly owned that he had no commi&s;&s;ion nor power to work miracles, being &s;ent of God to the people only as a preacher. Not in|deed but that there are things mentioned in the revela|tion he pretended to give them, which, if true, would have been miraculous; &s;uch are the nocturnal vi&s;its of the angel Gabriel, (not unlike tho&s;e &s;ecret inter|views, which Numa, the in&s;titutor of the Roman rites, affirmed that he had with the godde&s;s Egeria) his getting from time to time parcels of the uncreated book tran&s;mitted to him from heaven, and his mo&s;t a|mazing night-journey. But the&s;e miracles could be no evidences of his mi&s;&s;ion. Why? Becau&s;e no per|&s;on was witne&s;s to them. On the contrary, it was becau&s;e his adherents had previou&s;ly and implicitly believed his apo&s;tle&s;hip, that they admitted things &s;o incredible, on his bare declaration. There is indeed one miracle, and but one, which he urgeth again&s;t the infidels, as the main &s;upport of his cau&s;e; a mi|racle, for which even we, in this di&s;tant region and period, have not only the evidence of te&s;timony, but, if we plea&s;e to u&s;e it, all the evidence which the contemporaries and countrymen of this military a|po&s;tle ever enjoyed. The miracle I mean is the ma|nife&s;t divinity, or &s;upernatural excellence, of the &s;criptures which he gave them; a miracle, concern|ing
<PB N="78" REF="022387_0087_0FB862712947DF00">which I &s;hall only &s;ay, that as it falls not under the cogni&s;ance of the &s;en&s;es, but of a much more fal|lible tribunal, ta&s;te in compo&s;ition, and critical di&s;|cernment, &s;o a principle of le&s;s efficacy than enthu|&s;ia&s;m, even the &s;lighte&s;t partiality, may make a man, in this particular, imagine he perceives what hath no reality. Certain it is, that notwith&s;tanding the many defiances which the prophet gave his enemies &s;ometimes to produce ten chapters, &s;ometimes one, that could bear to be compared with an equal portion of the per&s;pi|picuous book
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alcoran. The chapter&mdash;of the cow,&mdash;of Jonas,&mdash;of Hud.</NOTE>, they &s;eem not in the lea&s;t to have been convinced, that there was any thing miraculous in the matter. Nay this &s;ublime performance, &s;o highly venerated by every Mu&s;&s;ulman, they were not afraid to bla&s;pheme as contemptible, calling it, <Q>A confu&s;ed heap of dreams,</Q> and the &s;illy fables of "ancient times
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">&mdash;Of cattle,&mdash;of the &s;poils,&mdash;of the prophets. That the Alcoran bears a very &s;trong re&s;emblance to the Talmud is indeed evident; but I hardly think, we can have a more &s;triking in&s;tance of the prejudices of modern infidels, than in their comparing this motley compo&s;ition to the writings of the Old and New Te&s;ta|ment. Let the reader but take the trouble to peru&s;e the hi&s;tory of Jo&s;eph by Mahomet, which is the &s;ubject of a very long chap|ter, and to compare it with the account of that patriarch given by Mo&s;es, and if he doth not perceive at once the immen&s;e inferio|rity of the former, I &s;hall never, for my part, undertake by ar|gument to convince him of it. To me it appears even almo&s;t in|credible, that the mo&s;t beautiful and mo&s;t affecting pa&s;&s;ages of holy writ, &s;hould be &s;o wretchedly disfigured by a writer who&s;e intention, we are certain was not to burle&s;que them. But that every reader may be qualified to form &s;ome notion of this mira|cle of a book, I have &s;ubjoined a &s;pecimen of it, from the chapter of <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">;</HI> where we are informed particularly of the cau&s;e of the vi&s;it which the queen of Sheba (there called <HI>Saba</HI>) made to Solomon, and of the occa&s;ion of her conver&s;ion from idolatry. I have not &s;elected this pa&s;&s;age on account of any &s;pecial futility to be found in it, for the like ab&s;urdities may be ob&s;erved in every page of the performance; but I have &s;elected it, becau&s;e it is &s;hort, and becau&s;e it contains a di&s;tinct &s;tory which bears &s;ome relation to a pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture. I u&s;e Mr Sale's ver&s;ion, which is the late&s;t and the mo&s;t approved, omitting only, for the &s;ake of brevity, &s;uch &s;upplementary expre&s;&s;ions, as have been without nece&s;&s;ity in|&s;erted by the tran&s;lator. <Q>Solomon was David's heir; and he &s;aid, O men, we have been taught the &s;peech of birds, and have had all things be&s;towed on us; this is manife&s;t excellence. And his armies were gathered together to Solomon, con&s;i&s;ting of genii, and men, and birds; and they were led in di&s;tinct <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ands, till they came to the valley of ants. An ant &s;aid, O ants, enter ye into your habitations, le&s;t Solomon and his ar|my tread you under foot and perceive it not. He &s;miled, laugh|ing at her words, and &s;aid, O Lord, excite me, that I may be thankful for thy favour, wherewith thou ha&s;t favoured me, and my parents; and that I may do that which is right and well plea&s;ing to thee: and introduce me, thro' thy mercy a|mong thy &s;ervants the righteous. And he viewed the birds, and &s;aid, What is the rea&s;on that I &s;ee not the lapwing? Is &s;he ab&s;ent? Verily I will cha&s;ti&s;e her with a &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;ement, or I will put her to death; unle&s;s &s;he bring me a ju&s;t excu&s;e. And &s;he tarried not long, and &s;aid, I have viewed that which thou ha&s;t not viewed; and I come to thee from Saba, with a certain piece of news. I found a woman to reign over them, who is provided with every thing, and hath a magnificent throne. I &s;ound her and her people to wor|&s;hip the &s;un, be&s;ides God: and Satan hath prepared their works for them, and hath turned them a&s;ide from the way, (where|fore they are not directed) le&s;t they &s;hould wor&s;hip God, who bringeth to light that which is hidden in heaven and earth, and knoweth whatever they conceal, and whatever they di&s;co|ver. God! there is no God but he; the Lord of the magni|ficent throne. He &s;aid, We &s;hall &s;ee whether thou ha&s;t &s;po|ken the truth or whether thou art a liar. Go with this my letter, and ca&s;t it down to them; then turn a&s;ide from them, and wait for their an&s;wer. The queen &s;aid, O nobles, verily an honourable letter hath been delivered to me; it is from So|lomon, and this is the tenour thereof. <HI>In the name of the mo&s;t merciful God, ri&s;e not up again&s;t me: but come, and &s;urrender your|&s;elves to me.</HI> She &s;aid, O nobles, advi&s;e me in my bu&s;ine&s;s: I will not re&s;olve on any thing, till ye be witne&s;s thereof. They an&s;wered, We are endued with &s;trength, and endued with great prowe&s;s in war; but the command appertaineth to thee: &s;ee therefore what thou wilt command. She &s;aid, Verily kings, when they enter a city, wa&s;te the &s;ame, and aba&s;e the mo&s;t powerful of the inhabitants thereof: and &s;o will the&s;e do. But I will &s;end gifts to them: and will wait for what tho&s;e who &s;hall be &s;ent, &s;hall bring back. And when the emba&s;&s;ador came to Solomon, that prince &s;aid, Will ye pre&s;ent me with riches? Verily that which God hath given me is better than what he hath given you: but ye glory in your gifts. Return to your people. We will &s;urely come to them with forces which they &s;hall not be able to with&s;tand; and we will drive them out humbled; and they &s;hall be contemptible. And So|lomon &s;aid, O nobles, which of you will bring me her throne, before they come and &s;urrender them&s;elves to me? A terrible genius an&s;wered, I will bring it thee, before thou ari&s;e from thy place. And one with whom was the knowledge of the &s;cripture &s;aid, I will bring it to thee, in the twinkling of an eye. And when Solomon &s;aw it placed before him, he &s;aid, This is a favour of my Lord, that he may make trial of me, whether I will be grateful, or whether I will be ungrateful: and he who is grateful, is grateful to his own advantage; but if any &s;hall be ungrateful, verily my Lord is &s;elf-&s;ufficient and munificent. And he &s;aid, Alter her throne that &s;he may not know it, to the end we may &s;ee whether &s;he be directed, or whether &s;he be of tho&s;e who are not directed. And when &s;he was come, it was &s;aid, Is thy throne like this? She an&s;wered, As though it were the &s;ame. And we have had knowledge be|&s;towed on us before this, and have been re&s;igned. But that which &s;he wor&s;hipped be&s;ides God, had turned her a&s;ide, for &s;he was of an unbelieving people. It was &s;aid to her, Enter the pa|lace. And when &s;he &s;aw it, &s;he imagined it to be a great wa|ter, and &s;he di&s;covered her legs. Solomon &s;aid, Verily this is a palace, evenly floored with gla&s;s. She &s;aid, O Lord, verily I have dealt unju&s;tly with my own &s;oul; and I re&s;ign my&s;elf together with Solomon, to God, the Lord of all creatures.</Q> Thus poverty of &s;entiment, mon&s;tro&s;ity of invention, which al|ways betokens a di&s;tempered not a rich imagination, and in re|&s;pect of diction the mo&s;t turgid verbo&s;ity, &s;o apt to be mi&s;taken by per&s;ons of a viciated ta&s;te for true &s;ublimity, are the genuine characteri&s;tics of the book. They appear almo&s;t in every line. The very titles and epithets a&s;&s;igned to god not exempt from them. The Lord of the daybreak, the Lord of the magnificent throne, the King of the day of judgment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They are pompous and in|&s;ignificant. If the language of the Alcoran, as the Mahometans pretend, is indeed the language of God, the thoughts are but too evidently the thoughts of men. The rever&s;e of this is the cha|racter of the Bible. When God &s;peaks to men, 'tis rea&s;onable to think that he addre&s;&s;es them in their own language. In the Bible you will find nothing inflated, nothing affected in the &s;tyle. The words are human, but the &s;entiments are divine. Accordingly there is perhaps no book in the world, as hath been often ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, which &s;uffers le&s;s by a literal tran&s;lation into any other language.</NOTE>."</P>

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is ob&s;ervable, that Mahomet was very much hara&s;&s;ed by the demands and rea&s;onings of his oppo&s;ers with regard to mira|cles.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr Middleton's pre&s;atory di&s;cour&s;e to his letter from Rome.</NOTE>. The ju&s;tne&s;s of the re|mark contained in this acknowledgment, will appear more clearly from the following ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>Let it be ob&s;erved, fir&s;t, that &s;uppo&s;ing numbers of people are a&s;certained of the truth of &s;ome mira|cles, whether their conviction ari&s;e from &s;en&s;e or from te&s;timony, it will &s;urely be admitted as a con&s;e|quence, that in all &s;uch per&s;ons, the pre&s;umption again&s;t miracles from uncommonne&s;s mu&s;t be great|ly dimini&s;hed, in &s;everal perhaps totally extingui&s;h|ed.</P>
<P>Let it be ob&s;erved, &s;econdly, that if true miracles have been employed &s;ucce&s;sfully in &s;upport of cer|tain religious tenets, this &s;ucce&s;s will naturally &s;ug|ge&s;t to tho&s;e, who are zealous of propagating fa|vourite opinions in religion, to recur to the plea of miracles, as the mo&s;t effectual expedient for accom|pli&s;hing their end. This they will be encouraged to do on a double account: <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> they know, that peo|ple from recent experience, are made to expect &s;uch
<PB N="89" REF="022387_0098_0FB8635C5FD68728">a confirmation; <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> they know, that in con|&s;equence of this experience, the incredibility, which is the principal ob&s;truction to &s;uch an undertaking, is in a manner removed: and there is, on the con|trary, as in &s;uch circum&s;tances there certainly would be, a promptne&s;s in the generality to receive them.</P>
<P>Add to the&s;e, that if we con&s;ult the hi&s;tory of mankind, or even our own experience, we &s;hall be convinced, that hardly hath one wonderful event actually happened in any country, even where there have not been &s;uch vi&s;ible temptations to forgery, which hath not given ri&s;e to fal&s;e rumours of other events &s;imilar, but &s;till more wonderful. Hardly hath any per&s;on or people atchieved &s;ome exploits truly extraordinary, to whom common report hath not quickly attributed many others, as extraordinary at lea&s;t, if not impo&s;&s;ible. As <HI>fame</HI> may, in this re&s;pect, be compared to a <HI>multiplying gla&s;s,</HI> rea&s;ona|ble people almo&s;t always conclude in the &s;ame way concerning both; we know that there is not a real object corre&s;ponding to every appearance exhibited, at the &s;ame time we know that there mu&s;t be &s;ome objects to give ri&s;e to the appearances.</P>
<P>I &s;hould therefore only beg of our adver&s;aries, that, for argument's &s;ake, they will &s;uppo&s;e that the miracles related in the New Te&s;tament were really performed; and then, that they will candidly tell us, what, according to their notions of human nature, would, in all likelihood, have been the con&s;equences. They mu&s;t be very partial to a darling hypothe&s;is, or little acquainted with the world, who will he&s;itate to own, that, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, 'tis not barely proba|ble,
<PB N="90" REF="022387_0099_0FB8635EA58ECAB8">but certain, that f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a few endowed with the miraculous power, there would &s;oon have ari&s;en numbers of pretenders; that from &s;ome miracles well atte&s;ted, occa&s;ion would have been taken to propagate innumerable fal&s;e reports. If &s;o, with what colour of ju&s;tice can the detection of many &s;purious reports among the primitive Chri&s;tians be con&s;idered as a pre&s;umption again&s;t tho&s;e miracles, the reality of which is the mo&s;t plau&s;ible; nay the only plau&s;ible account that can be given of the origin of &s;uch reports? The pre&s;umption is too evidently on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide to need illu&s;tration.</P>
<P>'Tis not my intention here to patronize either &s;ide of the que&s;tion which the Doctor's <HI>Free inquiry</HI> hath occa&s;ioned. All that concerns my argument is, bare|ly to evince, and this I imagine hath been evinced, that, granting the Doctor's plea to be well founded, there is no pre&s;umption ari&s;ing hence, which tends in the lowe&s;t degree to di&s;credit the miracles record|ed in holy writ; nay, that there is a contrary pre&s;umption. In further confirmation of this truth, let me a&s;k, Were there ever, in any region of the globe, any &s;imilar preten&s;ions to miraculous powers, before that memorable <HI>era,</HI> the publication of the go&s;pel? Let me a&s;k again, Since tho&s;e preten&s;ions cea&s;ed, hath it ever been in the power of the mo&s;t daring enthu&s;ia&s;t, to revive them any where in favour of a new &s;y&s;tem? Authentic miracles will, for a time, give a currency to counterfeits; but as the former be|come le&s;s frequent, the latter become more &s;u&s;pect|ed, till at length they are treated with general con|tempt, and di&s;appear. The danger then is, le&s;t
<PB N="91" REF="022387_0100_0FB8636054D826B0">men, ever prone to extremes, become as extrava|gently incredulous, as formerly they were credulous. <HI>Lazine&s;s,</HI> the true &s;ource of both, always inclines us to admit or reject in the <HI>gro&s;s,</HI> without entering on the irk &s;ome ta&s;k of con&s;idering things in <HI>detail.</HI> In the fir&s;t in&s;tance, knowing &s;ome &s;uch events to be true, they <HI>admit all without examination;</HI> in the &s;e|cond, knowing &s;ome to be fal&s;e, they <HI>reject all with|out examination.</HI> A procedure this, which, how|ever excu&s;able in the unthinking herd, is altogether unworthy a philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>But it may be thought, that the claim to miracles in the early ages of the church, continued too long to be &s;upported &s;olely on the credit of tho&s;e perform|ed by our Lord and his apo&s;tles. In order to ac|count for this, it ought to be attended to, that in the cour&s;e of &s;ome centuries, the &s;ituation of affairs, with regard to religion, was really inverted. Educa|tion, and even &s;uper&s;tition, and bigotry, and popula|rity, which the miracles of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles had to encounter; came gradually to be on the &s;ide of tho&s;e wonders, &s;aid to have been performed in af|ter times. If they were potent <HI>enemies,</HI> and &s;uch as we have rea&s;on to believe nothing but the force of truth could vanqui&s;h; they were al&s;o potent <HI>allies,</HI> and may well be &s;uppo&s;ed able to give a temporary triumph to fal&s;ehood, e&s;pecially when it had few or no enemies to combat. But in di&s;cour&s;ing on the prodigies &s;aid to have been performed in primitive times, I have been in&s;en&s;ibly carried from the point, to which I propo&s;ed in this &s;ection to confine my&s;elf. From inquiring into miracles a&s;cribed to new &s;y|&s;tems
<PB N="92" REF="022387_0101_0FB863621DA59D68">I have proceeded to tho&s;e pleaded in confir|mation of &s;y&s;tems previou&s;ly e&s;tabli&s;hed and generally received.</P>
<P>LEAVING &s;o remote a period, I propo&s;e, la&s;tly, to inquire, whether, &s;ince that time, any here&s;iarch whatever, any founder of a new &s;ect, or publi&s;her of a new &s;y&s;tem, hath pretended to miraculous pow|ers. If the e&s;&s;ayi&s;t had known of any &s;uch pretender, he &s;urely would have mentioned him. But as he hath not afforded us any light on this &s;ubject, I &s;hall ju&s;t recall to the remembrance of my reader, tho&s;e per&s;ons who, either as innovators or reformers, have made &s;ome figure in the church. They were the per&s;ons from whom, if from any, a plea of this kind might naturally have been expected; e&s;pecially at a time when Europe was either plunged in barbari&s;m, or but beginning to emerge out of it,</P>
<P>Was ever then this high prerogative, the power of working miracles, claimed or exerci&s;ed by the founders of the &s;ects of the Walden&s;es and Albigen|&s;es? Did Wickliff in England pretend to it? Did Hu&s;s or Jerom in Bohemia? To come nearer mo|cern times, Did Luther in Germany, Zuinglius in Switzerland, Calvin in France, or any other of the reformers, advance this plea? Do &s;uch of them as are authors, mention in their writings any miracles they performed, or appeal to them as the evidences of their doctrine? Do contemporary hi&s;torians al|ledge, that they challenged the &s;aith of their auditors, in con&s;equence of &s;uch &s;upernatural powers? I ad|mit, if they did, that their miracles might be a&s;cri|bed to a new &s;y&s;tem. For tho' they pretended only
<PB N="93" REF="022387_0102_0FB86363458A2AC8">to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the Chri&s;tian in&s;titution, in its native purity, expunging tho&s;e pernicious interpolations, which a fal&s;e philo&s;ophy had foi&s;ted into the doctrinal part, and Pagan &s;uper&s;tition into the moral and the ritual; yet as the religion they inculcated, greatly differed from the faith and wor&s;hip of the times, it might, in this re&s;pect, be denominated a new &s;y|&s;tem; and would be encountered by all the violence and prejudice, which novelties in religion never fail to excite. Not that the want of real miracles was a pre&s;umption again&s;t the truth of their doctrine. The God of nature, who is the God of Chri&s;tians, does nothing in vain. No new revelation was pretended to; con&s;equently there was no occa&s;ion for &s;uch &s;upernatural &s;upport. They appealed to the revelati|on formerly be&s;towed, and by all parties acknow|ledged, as to the proper rule in this controver&s;y: they appealed to the rea&s;on of mankind as the judge; and the rea&s;on of mankind was a competent judge of the conformity of their doctrine to this unerring rule.</P>
<P>But how, upon the author's principles, &s;hall we account for this moderation in the reformers? Were they, in his judgment, calm inquirers into truth? Were they di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate rea&s;oners in defence of it? Far otherwi&s;e. He tells us, <Q>They may &s;afely be pronounced to have been univer&s;ally inflamed with the highe&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;m

That this was not the light in which miracles were viewed by Luther, who ju&s;tly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the fir&s;t place in the li&s;t of reformers, is evident from the manner in which he argues again&s;t Muncer, the apo&s;tle of the Anabapti&s;ts. This man, without ordination, had a&s;&s;umed the office of a Chri&s;|tian pa&s;tor. Again&s;t this conduct Luther remou&s;trates, as being in his judgment, an u&s;urpation of the &s;acred function. "Let him be a&s;ked," &s;ays he, <Q>Who made him teacher of religion? If he an&s;wers, God; let him prove it by a vi&s;ible <HI>miracle:</HI> for 'tis by &s;uch &s;igns that God declares him&s;elf, when he gives an extraordinary mi&s;&s;ion.</Q> When this argument was afterwards retorted on him&s;elf by the Romani&s;ts, who de&s;ired to know how his own vocation, originally limited and dependent, had become not only unlimited, but quite independent of the hierarchy, from which he had received it; his reply was, That the <HI>intrepidity,</HI> with which he had been enabled to brave &s;o many dangers, and the <HI>&s;ucce&s;s,</HI> with which his enterpr&s;e had been crowned, ought to be regarded as miraculous: And indeed mo&s;t of his followers were of this opinion. But whether this opinion was erroneous, or whether the argument again&s;t Muncer was conclu&s;ive, 'tis not my bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire. Thus much is evident from the &s;tory: <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> That this reformer, far from rejecting miracles as a Romi&s;h trick, acknowledged, that in &s;ome religious que&s;tions, they are the only medium of proof; <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> That notwith&s;tanding this, he never attempted, by a &s;how of miracles, to impo&s;e on the &s;en|&s;es of his hearers; (if they were deceived in thinking that his &s;ucce&s;s and magnanimity were miraculous, 'twas not their &s;en&s;es, but their under&s;tanding that was deceived); <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> That the Anabapti&s;ts them&s;elves, tho' perhaps the mo&s;t outrageous fanatics that ever exi&s;ted, did not pretend to the power of working mira|cles.&mdash;<HI>Sleidan lib.</HI> 5. <HI>Luth.

Since the world began, there hath not appeared a more general propen&s;ion to the wilde&s;t fanatici&s;m, a greater degree of credulity in every claim that was made to the illap&s;es of the Holy Spirit, or more tho|rough contempt of all e&s;tabli&s;hed modes of wor&s;hip, than appeared in this i&s;land about the middle of the la&s;t century.

<P>A man, I &s;uppo&s;e, of an unblemi&s;hed character, advanceth doctrines in religion, unknown before, but not in them&s;elves apparently impious or ab&s;urd. We interrogate him about the manner wherein he attained the knowledge of tho&s;e doctrines. He affirms, That by no proce&s;s of rea&s;oning, nor in any other natural way, did he di&s;cover them; but that they were re|vealed to him by the Spirit of God. It mu&s;t be own|ed, there is a very &s;trong pre&s;umption again&s;t the truth of what he &s;ays; and 'tis of con&s;equence to inquire, whence that pre&s;umption ari&s;eth. It is not primarily from any doubt of the man's integrity. If the fact he
<PB N="98" REF="022387_0107_0FB86372A015E9B8">related, were of an ordinary nature, the reputation he has hitherto maintained would &s;ecure him from being &s;u&s;pected of an intended deceit. It is not from any ab&s;urdity or immoral tendency we perceive in the doctrine it&s;elf. It ari&s;eth principally, if not &s;olely from the&s;e two circum&s;tances, the extreme uncommon|ne&s;s of &s;uch a revelation, and the great facility with which people of &s;trong fancy, may in this particular impo&s;e upon them&s;elves. The man, I &s;uppo&s;ed, ac|quaints us further, that God, when he communicated to him the truths he publi&s;hes, communicated al&s;o the power of working miracles; &s;uch as, of giving &s;ight to the blind, and hearing to the deaf, of rai&s;ing the dead, and making whole the maimed. 'Tis evident, that we have preci&s;ely the &s;ame pre&s;umption again&s;t his be|ing endued with &s;uch a power, as again&s;t his having obtained &s;uch a revelation. Two things are a&s;&s;erted: there is one pre&s;umption, and but one, again&s;t them; and it equally effects them both. Whatever proves either a&s;&s;ertion, removes the only pre&s;umption which hinders our belief of the other. The man, I &s;uppo&s;e, la&s;tly, performs the miracles before us, which he &s;aid he was commi&s;&s;ioned to perform. We can no longer doubt of a &s;upernatural communication. We have now all the evidence which the integrity of the per|&s;on could give us, as to an ordinary event atte&s;ted by him, that the doctrine he delivers as from God, is from God, and therefore true.</P>
<P>Nay, we have more evidence than for any common fact, vouched by a per&s;on of undoubted probity. As God is both almighty and all-wi&s;e, if he hath be&s;tow|ed on any &s;o uncommon a privilege, 'tis highly pro|bable, that it is be&s;towed for promoting &s;ome end un|commonly
<PB N="99" REF="022387_0108_0FB86373C6F11D68">important. And what more important end than to reveal to men that which may be condu|cive to their pre&s;ent and eternal happine&s;s? It may be &s;aid, That, at mo&s;t, it can only prove the inter|po&s;al of &s;ome power &s;uperior to human: the being who interpo&s;eth is perhaps a bad being, and intends to deceive us. This it may be allowed, is <HI>po&s;&s;ible;</HI> but the other is <HI>probable.</HI> For, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> From the light of nature, we have no po&s;itive evidence of the exi&s;t|ence of &s;uch intermediate beings, good or bad. Their exi&s;tence is therefore only po&s;&s;ible. Of the exi&s;tence and perfections of God, we have the highe&s;t moral a&s;&s;urance. <HI>Secondly,</HI> If there were &s;uch beings, that rai&s;ing the dead, and giving &s;ight to the blind, &s;hould come within the verge of their power, is al&s;o but po&s;|&s;ible; that they are within the &s;phere of omnipotence is certain. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Whatever &s;eems to imply a &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of any of the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of nature, we may pre&s;ume, with great appearance of rea&s;on, pro|ceeds from the author of nature, either <HI>immediately,</HI> or, which amounts, to the &s;ame thing <HI>mediately:</HI> that is, by the intervention of &s;ome agent impowered by him. To all the&s;e there will al&s;o accrue pre&s;umptions, not only, as was hinted already, from the character of the preacher, but from the apparent tendency of the doc|trine, and from the effect it produceth on tho&s;e who receive it. And now the connection between the mi|racle and the doctrine is obvious. The miracle re|moves the improbability of a &s;upernatural communi|cation of which it is in fact an irrefragable evidence. This improbability, which was the only ob&s;tacle, be|ing removed, the doctrine hath, at lea&s;t, all the evidence
<PB N="100" REF="022387_0109_0FB86375475FDCF8">of a common fact, atte&s;ted by a man of known virtue and good &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>In order to illu&s;trate this further, I &s;hall recur to the in&s;tance I have already had occa&s;ion to con&s;ider, of the Dutchman and the King of Siam. I &s;hall &s;up|po&s;e, that, be&s;ides the account given by the former of the freezing of water in Holland, he had informed the prince of the a&s;toni&s;hing effects produced by gun|powder, with which the latter had been entirely unac|quainted. Both accounts appear to him alike incredi|ble, or, if you plea&s;e, ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible. Some time afterwards, the Dutchman gets imported into the kingdom a &s;ufficient quantity of gunpowder, with the nece&s;&s;ary artillery. He informs the monarch of this acqui&s;ition; who having permitted him to make experiments on &s;ome of his cattle and buildings, per|cieves, with inexpre&s;&s;ible amazement, that all the European had told him, of the celerity and violence with which this de&s;tructive powder operates, is &s;trict|ly conformable to truth. I a&s;k any con&s;iderate per|&s;on, Would not this be enough to re&s;tore the &s;tranger to the Indian's good opinion, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, his former experienced hone&s;ty had entitled him to? Would it not remove the incredibility of the account he had given of the freezing of water in northern coun|tries? Yet, if ab&s;tractly con&s;idered, what connec|tion is there between the effects of gunpowder and the effects of cold? But the pre&s;umption ari&s;ing from miracles, in favour of the doctrine publi&s;hed by the performer, as divinely in&s;pired, mu&s;t be incompa|rably &s;tronger; &s;ince, from what hath been &s;aid, it appears to have &s;everal peculiar circum&s;tances, which
<PB N="101" REF="022387_0110_0FB8637A11C178A0">add weight to it. 'Tis evident, then, that miracles are a proper proof, and perhaps the only proper proof, of a revelation from Heaven. But 'tis al&s;o evident, that miracles may be wrought for other purpo&s;es, and may not be intended as proofs of any doctrine what|&s;oever.</P>
<P>THUS much being premi&s;ed, I &s;hall examine ano|ther very curious argument of the e&s;&s;ayi&s;t: <Q>There is no te&s;timony,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>for any prodigy, that is not oppo&s;ed by an infinite number of witne&s;|&s;es; &s;o that not only the miracle de&s;troys the credit of the te&s;timony, but even the te&s;timony de&s;troys it&s;elf
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 190, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</Q> In order to illu&s;trate this &s;trange po&s;i|tion, he ob&s;erves, that, <Q>in matters of religion, whatever is different is contrary; and that it is impo&s;&s;ible the religions of ancient Rome, of Tur|key, of Siam, and of China, &s;hould all of them be e&s;tabli&s;hed on any &s;olid foundation. Every mira|cle therefore pretended to have been wrought in any of the&s;e religions, (and all of them abound in miracles) as its direct &s;cope is to e&s;tabli&s;h the particular &s;y&s;tem to which it is attributed, &s;o it has the &s;ame force, tho' more indirectly, to over|throw every other &s;y&s;tem. In de&s;troying a rival &s;y&s;tem, it likewi&s;e de&s;troys the credit of tho&s;e miracles, on which that &s;y&s;tem was e&s;tabli&s;hed; &s;o that all the prodigies of different religions are to be regarded as contrary facts, and the evidences of the&s;e prodigies, whether weak or &s;trong, as oppo&s;ite to each other.</Q> Never did an author
<PB N="102" REF="022387_0111_0FB8637C1CF14958">more artfully avail him&s;elf of indefinite expre&s;&s;ions. With what admirable &s;leght does he vary his phra|&s;es, &s;o as to make the inadvertent reader look upon them as &s;ynonymous, when in fact their &s;ignificati|ons are totally di&s;tinct? Thus what, by a mo&s;t ex|traordinary idiom, is called at fir&s;t, <Q>miracles wrought in a religion,</Q> we are next to regard, as 'miracles attributed to a particular &s;y&s;tem,' and la&s;t|ly, as <Q>miracles, the direct &s;cope of which is to e&s;tabli&s;h that &s;y&s;tem.</Q> Every body, I will venture to &s;ay, in beginning to read the &s;entence, if he forms any notion of what the author means by a 'miracle wrought in a religion,' under&s;tands it barely as a <Q>miracle wrought among tho&s;e who profe&s;s a particular religion,</Q> the words appearing to be u&s;ed in the &s;ame latitude, as when we call the tra|ditional tales current among the Jews, tho' they &s;hould have no relation to religion, Jewi&s;h tales; and tho&s;e in like manner Mahometan or Pagan tales, which are current among Mahometans or Pagans. Such a miracle, the reader, ere he is aware, is brought to con&s;ider as a miracle attributed to a par|ticular &s;y&s;tem; nay further, as a <Q>miracle, the direct &s;cope of which is to e&s;tabli&s;h that &s;y&s;tem.</Q> Yet nothing can be conceived more different than the meaning of the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, which are here jum|bled together as equivalent.</P>
<P>'Tis plain, that all the miracles of which there is any record, come under the fir&s;t denomination. They are all &s;uppo&s;ed to have been wrought before men, or among men; and wherever there are men, there is religion of &s;ome kind or other. Per|haps
<PB N="103" REF="022387_0112_0FB8637D8866E8D0">too all may, in a very <HI>improper</HI> &s;en&s;e, be attri|buted to a religious &s;y&s;tem. They all imply an in|terruption of the ordinary cour&s;e of nature. Such an interruption, wherever it is ob&s;erved, will be a&s;cribed to the agency of tho&s;e divinities that are a|dored by the ob&s;ervers, and &s;o may be &s;aid to be attributed by them to their own &s;y&s;tem. But where are the miracles (tho&s;e of holy writ excepted) of which you can &s;ay with propriety, it is their direct &s;cope to e&s;tabli&s;h a particular &s;y&s;tem? Mu&s;t we not then be &s;trangely blinded by the charms of a few am|biguous terms, if we are made to confound things &s;o widely different? Yet this confu&s;ion is the very ba&s;is, on which the author founds his rea&s;oning, and rears this tremendous doctrine; That <Q>a mira|cle of Mahomet, or any of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors,</Q> and, by parity of rea&s;on, a miracle of Chri&s;t, or any of his apo&s;tles, <Q>is refuted (as if it had been mentioned, and had in expre&s;s terms, been contradicted) by the te&s;timony of Titus Livius, Plutarch, Taci|tus, and of all the authors, Chine&s;e, Grecian, and Roman Catholic, who have related any mira|cles in their particular religions.</Q> Here all the miracles, that have been related by men of different religions, are blended, as coming under the common denomination of miracles, the direct &s;cope of which was to e&s;tabli&s;h tho&s;e particular religious &s;y&s;tems; an in&s;inuation, in which there is not even the &s;hadow of truth.</P>
<P>That the reader may be &s;atisfied on this point, I mu&s;t beg his attention to the following ob&s;ervations concerning the miracles of profane hi&s;tory. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Many facts are related as miraculous, where we may
<PB N="104" REF="022387_0113_0FB863820D19F160">admit the fact, without acknowledging the miracle. In&s;tances of this kind we have in relations concern|ing comets, eclip&s;es, meteors, earthquakes, and &s;uchlike. <HI>Secondly,</HI> The miracles may be admitted as genuine, and the manner in which hi&s;torians ac|count for them, rejected as ab&s;urd. The one is a matter of te&s;timony, the other of conjecture. In this a man is influenced by education, by prejudices, by received opinions. In every country, as was ob|&s;erved already, men will recur to the theology of the place, for the &s;olution of every phenomenon &s;up|po&s;ed miraculous. But, that it was the &s;cope of the miracle to &s;upport the theology, is one thing; and that fanciful men thought they di&s;covered in the theo|logy the cau&s;es of the miracle, is another. The in|habitants of Ly&s;tra accounted, from the principles of their own religion, for the miracle performed in their city by Paul and Barnabas
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xiv. 8. &amp;c</NOTE>. Was it therefore the &s;cope of that miracle to &s;upport the Lycaonian religion? <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Many miracles are recorded, as produced directly by Heaven without the mini&s;tra|tion of men: by what con&s;truction are the&s;e di&s;co|vered to be proofs of a particular &s;y&s;tem? Yet the&s;e al&s;o, wherever they happen, will be accounted for by the natives of the country, from the princi|ples of their own &s;uper&s;tition. Had any of the Pa|gan citizens e&s;caped the ruin in which Sodom was miraculou&s;ly involved, they would doubtle&s;s have &s;ought for the cau&s;e of this de&s;truction in the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed mode of polythei&s;m, and would probably have imputed it to the vengeance of &s;ome of their deities, incurred by the neglect of &s;ome frivolous ceremony.
<PB N="105" REF="022387_0114_0FB863864BEE7950">Would it therefore have been the &s;cope of the miracle to confirm this non&s;en&s;e? <HI>Fourthly,</HI> Even miracles &s;aid to have been performed by a man, are no eviden|ces of the truth of that man's opinions; &s;uch, I mean, as he pretends not to have received by revela|tion, but by the excerci&s;e of rea&s;on, by education, or by information from other men; no more than a man's being endowed with bodily &s;trenth greater than ordinary, would prove him to be &s;uperior to others in his mental &s;aculties. I conclude with de|claring, that if in&s;tances &s;hall be produced, of mira|cles wrought by men of probity, in proof of doctrines which they affirm to have been revealed to them from Heaven, and which are repugnant to the doctrine of the Bible, then I &s;hall think it equitable to admit, that religious miracles contradict one another. Then will rea&s;onable people be reduced to the dilemma, either of di&s;proving the allegations on one &s;ide, or of acknowledging that miracles can be no evidence of revelation. No attempt however hath as yet been made by any writer to produce an in&s;tance of this kind.</P>
<P>'But will nothing le&s;s &s;atisfy?' replies the author. <Q>Will not the predictions of augurs and oracles, and the intimations &s;aid to have been given by the gods or &s;aints in dreams and vi&s;ions, of things not other|wi&s;e knowable by tho&s;e to whom they were thus intimated; will not the&s;e, and &s;uchlike prodigies, &s;erve in &s;ome degree as evidence?</Q> As evidence of what? Shall we &s;ay of any religious principles con|veyed at the &s;ame time by revelation? No, 'tis not even pretended, that there were any &s;uch principles
<PB N="106" REF="022387_0115_0FB8638838A04EB0">&s;o conveyed: but as evidence of principles which had been long before entertained, and which were originally imbibed from education, and from education only. That the evidence here, &s;uppo&s;ing the truth of the facts, is at be&s;t but very indirect, and by no means on the &s;ame footing with that of the miracles re|corded in the go&s;pel, might be ea&s;ily evinced, if there were occa&s;ion. But there is in reality no occa&s;ion, &s;ince there is no &s;uch evidence of the facts as can ju&s;tly intitle them to our notice. Let it be remembered, that, in the fourth &s;ection of the fir&s;t part, it was &s;hown, that there is the greate&s;t di&s;|parity, in re&s;pect of evidence, betwixt miracles per|formed in proof of a religion <HI>to be</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed, and in <HI>contradiction</HI> to opinions generally received; and mi|racles performed, on the contrary, in &s;upport of a religion <HI>already</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed, and in <HI>confirmation</HI> of opi|nions generally received; that, in the former ca&s;e, there is the &s;tronge&s;t per&s;umption <HI>for</HI> the miracles, in the latter <HI>again&s;t</HI> them. Let it al&s;o be remem|bered, that in the preceding &s;ection it was &s;hown, that the religion of the Bible is the only religion ex|tant, which claims to have been u&s;hered into the world by miracles; that this prerogative neither the Pagan religion, the Mahometan, nor the Roman-Catholic, can, with any appearance of rea&s;on, ar|rogate; and that, by con&s;equence, there is one of the &s;tronge&s;t pre&s;umptions po&s;&s;ible <HI>for</HI> the miracles of the go&s;pel, which is not only wanting in the miracles of other religions, but which is contra&s;ted by the &s;tronge&s;t pre&s;umption po&s;&s;ible <HI>again&s;t</HI> the&s;e miracles. And tho' this pre&s;umption &s;hould not, in all ca&s;es,
<PB N="107" REF="022387_0116_0FB8638A076FF9F8">be accounted ab&s;olutely in&s;uperable, we mu&s;t at lea&s;t &s;ay, it gives an immen&s;e &s;uperiority to the proofs of Chri&s;tianity. 'Twere an endle&s;s and a fruitle&s;s ta&s;k to canva&s;s particularly the evidence of all the pre|tended miracles either of Pagani&s;m or Popery, (for on this head Mahometi&s;m is much more mode&s;t) but as the author hath &s;elected &s;ome, which he con&s;iders as the be&s;t atte&s;ted, of both religions, the&s;e &s;hall be examined &s;everally in the two &s;ub&s;equent &s;ections. From this examination a tolerable judgment may be formed concerning the preten&s;ions of the&s;e two &s;pe|cies of &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>But from what hath been &s;aid, it is evident, that the contrariety which the author pretends to have di&s;|covered in the miracles &s;aid to have been wrought, as he expre&s;&s;eth it, in different religions, vani&s;hes entirely on a clo&s;e in&s;pection. He is even &s;en&s;ible of this him&s;elf; and, as is cu&s;tomary with orators, the more inconclu&s;ive his rea&s;ons are, &s;o much the more po&s;itive are his a&s;&s;ertions. "This argument," &s;ays he, "may appear over &s;ubtile and refined;" indeed &s;o &s;ubtile and refined, that it is invi&s;ible altoge|ther; <Q><HI>but</HI>&mdash; is not <HI>in reality</HI> different from the rea&s;oning of a judge, who &s;uppo&s;es that the credit of two witne&s;&s;es maintaining a crime again&s;t any one, is de&s;troyed by the te&s;timony of two others, who affirm him to have been two hundred leagues di|&s;tant, at the &s;ame in&s;tant when the crime is &s;aid to have been committed.</Q> After the particle <HI>but,</HI> with which this clau&s;e begins, the reader naturally expects &s;uch an explication of the argument, as will convince him, that tho' <HI>&s;ubtile</HI> and <HI>refined,</HI> it hath
<PB N="108" REF="022387_0117_0FB8638B063BE2E0"><HI>&s;olidity</HI> and <HI>&s;trength.</HI> In&s;tead of this, he hath only the author's <HI>word</HI> warranting it to be good to all in|tents: "But <HI>is not in reality</HI> different," <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The a|nalogy between his <HI>example</HI> and his <HI>argument</HI> &s;eems to be but very di&s;tant; I &s;hall therefore, without any comment, leave it with the reader as I find it.</P>
<P>THUS it appears, that, for aught the author hath as yet proved, no miracles recorded by hi&s;torians of other religions are &s;ubver&s;ive of the evidence ari&s;ing from the miracles wrought in proof of Chri&s;tianity, or can ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as contrary te&s;timony.</P>

<P>Thus the e&s;&s;ayi&s;t hath laid us under the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of inferring, that he is either very ra&s;h in his
<PB N="112" REF="022387_0121_0FB86392D1C8D758">general a&s;&s;ertions, or u&s;eth very great amplification in his particular narrations. Perhaps in both infer|ences, we &s;hall find, upon inquiry, that there is &s;ome truth. In his <HI>Hi&s;tory of Great Britain,</HI> he gives us notice
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James I. chap. 2.</NOTE>, that he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf <Q>to a more di&s;tant po&s;terity, than will ever be reached by any local temporary theology.</Q> Why did he not likewi&s;e, in writing the <HI>E&s;&s;ays,</HI> entertain this grand idea? It would have been of u&s;e to him. It would have pre|vented his falling into tho&s;e incon&s;i&s;tencies, which his too great attention and antipathy to what he calls a <HI>localtemporary theology,</HI> only could occa&s;ion; and which, when that theology, according to his hypothe&s;is, &s;hall be extinct, and when all our religious controver|&s;ies &s;hall be forgotten, mu&s;t appear unaccountable and ridiculous. People will not then have the means of di&s;covering, what is &s;o obvious to us his contempo|raries, that he only a&s;&s;umes the appearance of an ad|vocate for &s;ome miracles, which are di&s;believed by the generality of Prote&s;tants, his countrymen, in order, by the compari&s;on, to vilify the miracles of &s;acred writ, which are acknowledged by them.</P>
<P>BUT to de&s;cend to particulars, I &s;hall begin with con&s;idering tho&s;e miracles, for which the author is indebted to the ancient Pagans. Fir&s;t, in order to convince us, how ea&s;y a matter it is for cunning and impudence to impo&s;e by fal&s;e miracles on the credulity of barbarians, he introduces the &s;tory of Alexander of
<PB N="113" REF="022387_0122_0FB8639410FC4440">Pontus
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">p 188. &amp;c.</NOTE>. The ju&s;tne&s;s of the account he gives of this impo&s;tor from Lucian, I &s;hall not di&s;pute. But that it may appear, how little the Chri&s;tian religion is affected by this relation, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome in&s;i|nuations he hath intermixt with it, I &s;hall make the following remarks.</P>
<P>It is of importance to know, what was the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of this once &s;o famous, tho' now forgotten Paphlagonian. Was he a publi&s;her of &s;trange gods? No
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The learned and judicious author of the <HI>Ob&s;ervations on the conver&s;ion and apo&s;tle&s;hip of Saint Paal,</HI> hath inad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">antly &s;aid of Alexander, that he introduced a <HI>new god</HI> into Pontus. The truth is, he only exhibited a reproduction of <HI>E&s;culapius,</HI> a well known deity in tho&s;e parts, to whom he gave indeed the <HI>new name</HI> GLY|CON. In this there was nothing un&s;uitable to the genius of the mythology. Accordingly, we do not find, that either the prie&s;ts, or the people, were in the lea&s;t alarmed for the religion of the country, or charged Alexander as an <HI>innovator</HI> in religious matters. On the contrary, the greate&s;t enemies he had to en|counter, were not the religioni&s;ts, but the latitudinarians.</NOTE>. Was he the founder of a new &s;y&s;tem in religi|on? No. What was he then? He was no other than a profe&s;&s;ed fortune-teller. What were the arts by which he carried on this gainful trade? The e&s;|&s;ayi&s;t ju&s;tly remarks, that <Q>it was a wi&s;e policy in him to lay the fir&s;t &s;cene of his impo&s;tures in a coun|try, where the people were extremely ignorant and &s;tupid, and ready to &s;wallow the gro&s;&s;e&s;t delu&s;ion.</Q> For, <Q>had Alexander fixed his re&s;idence at Athens, the philo&s;ophers of that renowned mart of learn|ing, had immediately &s;pread thro' the whole Roman empire their &s;en&s;e of the matter; which, being
<PB N="114" REF="022387_0123_0FB8639589A1C648">&s;upported by &s;o great authority, and di&s;played by all the force of rea&s;on and eloquence, had entirely opened the eyes of mankind.</Q> I &s;hall beg leave to remark another in&s;tance of good policy in him. He attemped not to gain the veneration of the multi|tude by oppo&s;ing, but by adopting their religious prejudices. His whole plan of deceit was founded in the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;uper&s;tition. The author him&s;elf will acknowledge, it would have been extreme folly in him to have acted otherwi&s;e: and all the world, I believe, will agree in thinking, that, in that ca&s;e, he could not have had the &s;malle&s;t probability of &s;ucce&s;s. What were the miracles he wrought? I know of none, unle&s;s we will dignify with that name, &s;ome feats of legerdemain, performed mo&s;tly by can|dle light; which, in many parts of Europe, we may daily &s;ee equalled, nay far exceeded, by tho&s;e of mo|dern juglers. Add to the&s;e &s;ome oracles he pronoun|ced, concerning which, if we may form a judgment from the account and &s;pecimen given us by Lucian, we &s;hould conclude, that, like other Heathen ora|cles, they were generally unintelligible, equivocal, or fal&s;e. Before whom did he exhibit his wonders? Before none, if he could help it, that were not tho|rough believers in the popular &s;y&s;tem. His noctur|nal my&s;teries were always introduced with an A|VAUNT to <HI>Athei&s;ts, Chri&s;tians,</HI> and <HI>Epicurians:</HI> and indeed it was dangerous for any &s;uch to be pre&s;ent at them. Mr Hume &s;ays, that, <Q>from his igno|rant Paphlagonians, he was enabled to proceed to the inli&s;ting of votaries among the Grecian philo|&s;ophers.</Q> On what authority he advances this, I have not been able to di&s;cover. He adds, <Q>and
<PB N="115" REF="022387_0124_0FB86397054B29E0">men of the mo&s;t eminent rank and di&s;tinction in Rome.</Q> Lucian mentions one man of rank, Ru|tilianus, among the votaries of the prophet; an ho|ne&s;t man he calls him, but at the &s;ame time the weake&s;t, the mo&s;t &s;uper&s;titions that ever lived. As to the military expedition, which one would imagine from Mr Hume's expre&s;&s;ion, the Emperor had re|&s;olved on, in con&s;equence of the encouragement which the delu&s;ive prophecies of this impo&s;tor gave him, we find, on the contrary, it was undertaken, before tho&s;e prophecies were uttered. But further, Did Alexan|der ri&s;k any thing in a&s;&s;uming the character of the <HI>interpreter</HI> of ESCULAPIUS? Did he lo&s;e, or did he &s;uffer any thing in defence of it? Quite the rever&s;e. He enriched him&s;elf by this mo&s;t ingenious occupa|toin. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of the picture which Luci|an gives of his morals, of the many artifices which he u&s;ed, or of the atrocious crimes which he perpe|trated. It mu&s;t be owned, that the principal &s;cope for calumny and detraction is what concerns the pri|vate life and moral character. Lucian was an ene|my, and, by his own account, had received the high|e&s;t provocation. But I avoid every thing, on this topic, that can admit a que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Where, I would gladly know, lies the re&s;em|blance between this impo&s;tor and the fir&s;t publi&s;hers of the go&s;pel? Every one, on the mo&s;t &s;uperficial re|view, may di&s;cover, that, in all the material circum|&s;tances, they are perfect contra&s;ts. There appears not therefore to be great danger in the poignant re|mark with which the author concludes this relation: <Q>Tho' <HI>much to be wi&s;hed,</HI> it does not always hap|pen, that every <HI>Alexander</HI> meets with a <HI>Lucian</HI> rea|dy
<PB N="116" REF="022387_0125_0FB8639C8F6A0B80">to expo&s;e and detect his impo&s;tures.</Q> Le&s;t the full import of this emphatical clau&s;e &s;hould not be apprehended, the author hath been &s;till more ex|plicit in the note: <Q>It may here perhaps be ob|jected, that I proceed ra&s;hly, and form my no|tions of Alexander, merely from the account gi|ven of him by Lucian, a profe&s;&s;ed enemy. <HI>It were indeed to be wi&s;hed,</HI> that &s;ome of the accounts publi&s;hed by his followers and accomplices had re|mained. The oppo&s;ition and contra&s;t betwixt the character and conduct of the &s;ame man, as drawn by a friend or an enemy, is as &s;trong, even in common life, much more in the&s;e religious mat|ters, as that betwixt any two men in the world, betwixt Alexander and St Paul for in&s;tance.</Q> Who can forbear to lament the uncommon di&s;tre&s;s of an author, obliged every moment to recur to unavail|ing wi&s;hes? Mr Hume, however, in this calamitous &s;ituation, &s;olaceth him&s;elf, as well as he can, by &s;uppo&s;ing what he cannot a&s;&s;ert. He &s;uppo&s;eth what would have been the ca&s;e, if his wi&s;hes could have been gratified; and artfully in&s;inuates, in this manner to his readers; that if we had the character and conduct of the apo&s;tle, delineated by as able an enemy as Lucian, we &s;hould find the portrait as ugly as that of Alexander.</P>
<P>Let us then for once &s;uppo&s;e, what the author &s;o ardently wi&s;hes, that &s;uch an enemy had undertaken the hi&s;tory of Paul of Tar&s;us. I can ea&s;ily conceive what a different repre&s;entation we &s;hould, in that ca&s;e, have had, of the mental endowments and mo|ral di&s;po&s;ition, as well as of the inducements and views of this Chri&s;tian mi&s;&s;ionary. I can conceive
<PB N="117" REF="022387_0126_0FB8639FAA9EDBB0">al&s;o, that both his actions and di&s;cour&s;es might have been &s;trangely disfigured. But if the biographer had maintained any regard, I &s;ay not, to truth, but to probability; there are &s;ome things, we may be ab|&s;olutely certain, he would never have advanced. He would not &s;urely have &s;aid of Paul, that he was by pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ion a cunning man, or <HI>conjurer;</HI> one who, for a little money, either told people their fortunes, or taught them how to recover &s;tolen goods. He would not, I &s;uppo&s;e, have pretended, that where|ever the apo&s;tle went, he flattered the &s;uper&s;tition of the populace, in order to gain them, and founded all his preten&s;ions on the popular &s;y&s;tem. He would not have alledged, that Paul <HI>inriched</HI> him&s;elf, or that he could ever have the pro&s;pect of inriching him&s;elf, by his vocation; nay, or that he ri&s;ked nothing, or &s;uffered nothing, by it. He could not have &s;aid con|cerning him, that he <HI>declined</HI> the audience or &s;crutiny of men, who&s;e opinions in religion differed from tho&s;e on which his mi&s;&s;ion was founded. He dur&s;t not have imputed to him the <HI>wi&s;e policy</HI> of laying the &s;cene of his impo&s;tures, only where ignorance, bar|bari&s;m, and &s;tupidity prevailed: as it is unque&s;tiona|ble, that our apo&s;tle traver&s;ed great part, not only of A&s;ia Minor, but of Macedonia, and Achaia; fixed his re&s;idence eighteen months at Corinth, a city not le&s;s celebrated for the polite arts, than for its popu|lou&s;ne&s;s and riches; preached publicly at Athens before the Stoics and the Epicureans, and even be|fore the Areopagus, the mo&s;t venerable judicature in Greece; not afraid of what the philo&s;ophers of that renowned mart of learning, might &s;pread through
<PB N="118" REF="022387_0127_0FB863A0CA78B9A0">the whole Roman empire, concerning him and his doctrine; nay, and la&s;tly preached at Rome it&s;elf, the mi&s;tre&s;s and metropolis of the world.</P>
<P>The reader will ob&s;erve, that, in this compari&s;on, I have &s;hunned every thing that is of a private, and therefore of a dubious nature. The whole is found|ed on &s;uch actions and events as were notorious; which 'tis not in the power of contemporary hi&s;to|rians to fal&s;i&s;y; &s;uch with regard to Alexander, as a <HI>votary</HI> could not have di&s;&s;embled; &s;uch with regard to Paul, as an <HI>enemy</HI> dur&s;t not have denied. We are truly indebted to the e&s;&s;ayi&s;t, who intending to exhibit a <HI>rival</HI> to the apo&s;tle, hath produced a character which, we find on making the compari&s;on, &s;erves only for a foil. Truth never &s;hines with grea|ter lu&s;tre, than when confronted with fal&s;ehood. The evidence of our religion, how &s;trong &s;oever, appears not &s;o irre&s;i&s;tibly, con&s;idered by it&s;elf, as when by compari&s;on we perceive, that none of tho&s;e artifices and circum&s;tances attended its propagation, which the whole cour&s;e of experience &s;hows to be nece&s;&s;ary to render impo&s;ture &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>THE next topic on which the ingenious author hath be&s;towed &s;ome flouri&s;hes, is the miracle <Q>which Tacitus reports of Ve&s;pa&s;ian, who cured a blind man in Alexandria, by means of his &s;pittle, and a lame man by the mere touch of his foot, in obedience to a vi&s;ion of the god Serapis, who had enjoined them to have recour&s;e to the emperor, for the&s;e miraculous and extraordinary cures
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 292, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</Q> The &s;tory he introduces with informing us, that it is
<PB N="119" REF="022387_0128_0FB863A252AEAB48"><Q>one of the be&s;t atte&s;ted miracles in all profane hi&s;tory.</Q> If &s;o, it will the better &s;erve for a &s;am|ple of what may be expected from that quarter. "Every circum&s;tance," he tells us, <Q>&s;eems to add weight to the te&s;timony, and might be di&s;played at large, with all the force of argument and eloquence, if any one were now concerned to enforce the evidence of that exploded and idolatrous &s;uper|&s;tition.</Q> For my part, were I concerned to en|force the evidence of that exploded and idolatrous &s;uper&s;tition, I &s;hould not wi&s;h the &s;tory were in bet|ter hands than in the author's. He is by no means deficient in eloquence; and if &s;ometimes there appear a deficiency in argument, that is not imputable to him, but to the &s;ubject, which cannot furni&s;h him with any better: and tho' I do not &s;u&s;pect him to be in the lea&s;t concerned to re-e&s;tabli&s;h Pagani&s;m, yet 'tis well known, that hatred to his adver&s;ary may as &s;trongly animate an advocate to exert him&s;elf, as affection to his client.</P>
<P>But to proceed to the &s;tory: Fir&s;t, the author pleads <Q>the gravity, &s;olidity, age, and probity of &s;o great an emperor, who, thro' the whole cour&s;e of his life, conver&s;ed in a familiar way with his friends and courtiers, and never affected tho&s;e extraordina|ry airs of divinity a&s;&s;umed by Alexander and De|metrius.</Q> To this character, the ju&s;tne&s;s of which I intend not to controvert, I &s;hall beg leave to add, what is equally indubitable, and much to the purpo&s;e, that no emperor &s;howed a &s;tronger inclination to cor|roborate his title by a &s;anction of the gods, than the prince of whom he is &s;peaking. This, doubtle&s;s,
<PB N="120" REF="022387_0129_0FB863A46F894BD8">he thought the more nece&s;&s;ary in his ca&s;e, as he was of an ob&s;cure family, and nowi&s;e related to any of his predece&s;&s;ors.

<P>The author adds, <Q>The hi&s;torian, a contempo|rary writer, noted for can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and veracity, and withal the greate&s;t and mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> penetrating genius per|haps of all antiquity, and &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ree from any tenden|cy to &s;uper&s;tition and cred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y, that he even lies under the contrary imputation of athei&s;m and pro|&s;anene&s;s.</Q> This would &s;ay a great deal, if the cha|racter of the hi&s;torian were of any moment in the que&s;tion. Doth Tacitus pretend that he was him|&s;elf a witne&s;s of the miracle? No. Doth he men|tion it as a thing which he believes? No. In ei|ther ca&s;e I a knowledge, that the reputation of the <HI>relater</HI> for candour and penetration, mu&s;t have added weight to the relation, whether con&s;idered as his <HI>te&s;|timony,</HI> or barely as his <HI>opinion.</HI> But is it fair to plead the veracity of the writer in proof of every po|pular rumour mentioned by him? His veracity is only concerned to &s;atisfy us, that it was actually report|ed, as he r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es; or that the attempt was made, and the miracle pretended; a point which, I pre&s;ume, nobody would have di&s;puted, altho' the authority had been le&s;s than that of Tacitus. Indeed the hi&s;torian doth not &s;ay di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ectly, whether he believes the miracle or not; but by his manner of telling it, he plainly in|&s;inuates, that he thought it ridiculous. In introdu|cing

<P>"Here," continues the e&s;&s;ayi&s;t, <Q>the relater was al&s;o contemporary to the &s;uppo&s;ed prodigy, of an incredulous and libertine character, as well as of great genius.</Q> But of what weight, in this affair, is either the genius or the incredulity of the relater, &s;ince, by Mr Hume's confe&s;&s;ion, he had no faith in the relation? Strange indeed is the u&s;e which the e&s;&s;ayi&s;t makes of this circum&s;tance!</P>
<P>"What <HI>adds mightily,</HI>" &s;ays he, <Q>to the force of the evidence, and may double our &s;urpri&s;e on this occa&s;ion, is, that the cardinal him&s;elf, who re|lates the &s;tory, &s;eems not to give any credit to it.</Q> It doth not in the lea&s;t &s;urpri&s;e me, that the car|dinal gives no credit to this relation; but I am be|yond mea&s;ure &s;urpri&s;ed, that Mr Hume &s;hould repre|&s;ent this circum&s;tance as <HI>adding mightily</HI> to the force of the evidence. Is then a &s;tory which is reported by a man of genius, the more credible that he doth not believe it? Or, Is it the more incredible that he doth be|lieve it? What would the author have &s;aid, if the cardinal had told us, that he gave credit to the re|lation? Might he not, in that ca&s;e, have very per|tinently pleaded the great genius, and penetration, and incredulity of the relater, as <HI>adding mightily</HI> to the force of the evidence? On that hypothe&s;is, he &s;urely might, for pretty obvious rea&s;ons. Uncom|mon penetration qualifies a man for detecting fraud;
<PB N="128" REF="022387_0137_0FB863B386D2B058">and it requires evidence greater than ordinary to &s;ur|mount incredulity. The belief therefore of &s;uch a per&s;on as the cardinal, who had not only the means of di&s;covering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n impo&s;ture, as he was contemporary and on the &s;pot, but the ability to di&s;cover it, as he was a man of genius, and not over-credulous; his belief, I &s;ay, would evidently have been no &s;mall pre&s;umption of the truth of the miracle. How his di&s;belief can be in like manner a pre&s;umption of its truth, is to me incomprehen&s;ible. Ay but, rejoins the author, <Q>as he &s;eems not to give any credit to it, he cannot be &s;u&s;pected of any concurrence in the holy fraud.</Q> Very well. I am &s;atisfied that a man's TESTIMONY is the <HI>more</HI> to be regarded, that he is above being &s;u&s;pected of concurring in <HI>any fraud,</HI> call it holy or unholy. But I want to know why, on the very &s;ame account, his OPINION is <HI>the le&s;s</HI> to be regarded? For my part, I find no difficul|ty in believing every article of the narration for which the cardinal gives his te&s;timony: notwith&s;tanding this, I may be of the &s;ame opinion with him; that the account given by the dean and canons, which is their te&s;timony, not his, was all a fiction. But it is not with the cardinal's <HI>te&s;timony</HI> we are here con|cerned: about that there is no di&s;pute.

Are they the more improbable on the&s;e accounts? The e&s;&s;ayi&s;t, when he reflects, will be the la&s;t man in the world,

<P>But leaving this, as one of the unfathomable depths of the e&s;&s;ay, I proceed to the other circum|&s;tances. "The miracle," &s;ays the author, <Q>of &s;o &s;ingular a nature, as could <HI>&s;carce</HI> admit of a counter|feit.</Q> He did well at lea&s;t to u&s;e the word <HI>&s;carce;</HI> for if every vi&s;itant was as little de&s;irous of prying into the &s;ecret, as the cardinal, nothing could be more ea&s;ily counterfeited: <Q>And the witne&s;&s;es very numerous, and all of them, <HI>in a manner,</HI> &s;pecta|tors of the fact, to which they gave their te&s;timo|ny.</Q> By the <HI>very numerous witne&s;&s;es,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e he means the whole company in town, who were ap|pealed to. They were all, <HI>in a manner,</HI> &s;pectators of the fact. What preci&s;e abatement the author intended we &s;hould make, from the &s;en&s;e of the word <HI>&s;pectators,</HI> on account of the qualifying phra&s;e, <HI>in a manner,</HI> I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to determine; but &s;hall ob&s;erve, from the memoirs, that it was not &s;o much as pretended by the canons, that any of the citizons had &s;een the miracle performed; 'twas only pretended, that they had &s;een the man formerly at the gate of the church, wanting a leg. Nor is it alledged, that any of them was at more pains in ex|amining the matter, either before or after the recove|ry of the leg, than the cardinal was. They were therefore properly no &s;pectators of the fact. The phra&s;e, <HI>in a manner,</HI> ought, I imagine, to have been placed in the end of the &s;entence, which would have
<PB N="130" REF="022387_0139_0FB863B98C671450">run thus: <Q>to which they, <HI>in a manner,</HI> give their te&s;timony:</Q> for no direct te&s;timony was either a&s;ked of them, or given by them; their belief is inferred from their devotion.</P>
<P>I have been the more particular in my remarks on the circum&s;tances of this &s;tory, not becau&s;e there was need of the&s;e remarks: for, tho' to the e&s;&s;ayi&s;t the relation appeared very <HI>memorable,</HI> to me, and, I believe, to mo&s;t people, it appears very <HI>trifling;</HI> but that the reader might have this further &s;pecimen of the author's talents in embellithing, To the above|mentioned, and all other &s;uch idle tales, this &s;hort and &s;imple an&s;wer will, by every man of &s;en&s;e, be thought &s;ufficient. <HI>The country where the miracle is &s;aid to have been wrought, is</HI> SPAIN; <HI>the people who propagated the faith of it, were</HI> THE CLERGY.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 197. in the note,</NOTE>. I &s;hall only add on this head, that the detection of fraud in &s;ome in&s;tances, ju&s;tly brings &s;u&s;picion on all the other in&s;tances.

<P>I ob&s;erve, <HI>fourthly,</HI> That all the cures recorded by Montgeron, as duly atte&s;ted, were &s;uch as might have been effected by <HI>natural</HI> means. There are two kinds of miracles, to which Mr Hume hath alluded in a note, tho' he does not directly make the di&s;tinc|tion. One is, when the event, con&s;idered by it&s;elf, is evidently <HI>preternatural.</HI> Of this kind are, rai&s;ing the dead, walking on water, making whole the mai|med; for by no natural cau&s;es can the&s;e effects be produced. The other kind is, when the event, con|&s;idered by it&s;elf, is <HI>natural,</HI> that is, may be produced by natural cau&s;es, but is denominated miraculous,
<PB N="137" REF="022387_0146_0FB863CA4D7EFC90">on account of the manner. That a &s;ick per&s;on &s;hould be re&s;tored to health, is not, when con&s;idered &s;ingly, preternatural; but that health &s;hould be re&s;|tored by the command of a man, undoubtedly is. Let us hear the author on this point: <Q>Sometimes an event may not, <HI>in it&s;elf, &s;eem</HI> to be contrary to the laws of nature, and yet, if it were real, it might, by rea&s;on of &s;ome circum&s;tances, be deno|minated a miracle; becau&s;e, <HI>in fact,</HI> it is contra|ry to the&s;e laws. Thus, if a per&s;on claiming a divine authority, &s;hould command a &s;ick per&s;on to be well, a healthful man to fall down dead, the clouds to pour rain, the winds to blow, in &s;hort, &s;hould order many natural events, which immediately follow upon his command; the&s;e might ju&s;tly be e&s;teemed miracles, becau&s;e they are really, in this ca&s;e, contrary to the laws of nature. For if any &s;u&s;picion remain, that the event and command concurred by accident, there is no mi|racle, and no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the laws of nature. If this &s;u&s;picion be removed, there is evidently a miracle, and a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e laws; becau&s;e nothing can be more contrary to nature, than that the voice or command of a man, &s;hould have &s;uch an influence
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 181. in the note.</NOTE>.</Q> From what hath been &s;aid, it appears, that the&s;e two kinds of miracles mu&s;t differ con&s;iderably in re&s;pect of evidence, &s;ince the latter naturally gives room for a &s;u&s;picion, which is ab|&s;olutely excluded from the former. In the former, when the fact or event is proved, the miracle is un|que&s;tionable. In the latter, the fact may be proved and yet the miracle may be ju&s;tly que&s;tioned. It
<PB N="138" REF="022387_0147_0FB863CB8695BAE0">therefore merits our attention, that all the miracles recorded in Montgeron's collection, were of the &s;econd kind. One of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of tho&s;e cures, was that of Don Alphon&s;o de Palacios, who had lo&s;t one eye, and was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with an inflam|mation in the other. The inflamed eye was cured, but the lo&s;t eye was not re&s;tored. Had there been a reproduction of the member which had peri&s;hed, a &s;ufficient proof of the fact, would have been a &s;uf|ficient proof of the miracle. But as the ca&s;e was o|therwi&s;e, the fact vouched may be admitted, without admitting any miracle. The cures &s;aid to have been per|formed on tho&s;e patients who were afflicted with para|lytic or drop&s;ical di&s;orders, or that performed on Loui&s;a Coirin, who had a tumour on her brea&s;t, will not appear to be intitled to a rank in the fir&s;t cla&s;s. As little can the cure of Peter Gautier claim that honour. One of his eyes had been pricked with an awl; in con&s;equence of which the aqueous humour dropped out, and he became blind of that eye. His &s;ight was re&s;tored, whil&s;t he paid his addre&s;&s;es to the <HI>Abb&eacute;.</HI> But that a puncture in the cornea of the eye will often heal of it&s;elf, and that the aqueous hu|mour, after it hath been quite lo&s;t, will be recruited, and con&s;equently, that the faculty of vi&s;ion will, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, be recovered, is what every oculi&s;t can a&s;&s;ure us of. The lo&s;s of the watery humour, is the con&s;tant effect of a very common operation in &s;urgery, couching the cataract. Hence we may learn, how we ought to under&s;tand the&s;e words of the author <Q>The curing of the &s;ick, giving hearing to the deaf, and &s;ight to the blind, were every where talked of
<PB N="139" REF="022387_0148_0FB863CD31A40200">as the u&s;ual effects of that holy &s;epulchre
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 195.</NOTE>.</Q> As therefore the alledged miracles were all of the &s;econd cla&s;s, 'tis only from the attendant circum&s;tances we can judge, whether the facts, tho' acknowledged, were miraculous or not.</P>
<P>In order to enlighten us on this point, I ob&s;erve, <HI>fifthly,</HI> That <HI>none</HI> of the cures were <HI>in&s;tantaneous.</HI> We have not indeed the &s;ame hold of the decea&s;ed <HI>Abb&eacute;,</HI> as of a living prophet, who pretends to work miracles. Tho&s;e who attend the latter, can know exactly, to whom he grants the benefit of his mi|raculous aid. They can judge al&s;o, whether the &s;up|plicant's recovery be coincident, with the prophet's volition or command. In the former ca&s;e, we have not acce&s;s to judge of either; and con&s;equently, there is much greater &s;cope for fancy and credulity to operate. No voice was ever &s;aid to have proceeded from the tomb of the ble&s;&s;ed deacon, as his votaries &s;tyled him. They obtained no audible an&s;wer to their prayers. There are however &s;ome circum|&s;tances, by which a probable conjecture may be made concerning the efficiency of the &s;aint in the cures a&s;cribed to him. One is, if the cure in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly followed the fir&s;t devotions at the tomb. Supernatural cures differ, in this particular, as much as in any other, from tho&s;e which are effected by natural means, that they are not <HI>gradually,</HI> but <HI>in|&s;tantly,</HI> perfected. Now of which kind were the cures of St Medard? From the accounts that are given, 'tis evident, that they were <HI>gradual.</HI> That &s;ome of them were <HI>&s;udden,</HI> is alledged; but that any
<PB N="140" REF="022387_0149_0FB863D0D8C8E110">of them were <HI>in&s;tantaneous,</HI> or immediately followed the fir&s;t application, is not even pretended. All the wor&s;hippers at the tomb, per&s;i&s;ted for <HI>days,</HI> &s;everal of them for <HI>weeks,</HI> and &s;ome for <HI>months</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, daily imploring the interce&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Abb&eacute;,</HI> before they received relief from their complaints; and the relief which was received, is, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, ac|knowledged to have been gradual.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve, <HI>&s;ixthly,</HI> That mo&s;t of the devotees either had been u&s;ing <HI>medicines</HI> before, and continued to u&s;e them, during their applications to the &s;aint; or, that their di&s;tempers had <HI>abated,</HI> before they deter|mined to &s;olicit his help. That the Spani&s;h youth had been u&s;ing, all the while a medicine pre&s;cribed by an eminent oculi&s;t, was proved by the depo&s;itions of witne&s;&s;es; that Gautier had begun to recover his &s;ight, before he had recour&s;e to the &s;epulchre, was atte&s;ted, not only by his uncle, but even by him&s;elf, when, as the Archbi&s;hop of Sens informs us, he &s;igned a recantation of what he had formerly ad|vanced. With regard to the re&s;t, it appears at lea&s;t probable, from the circum&s;tances of the proof, that they were u&s;ing the pre&s;criptions of the phy&s;icians, whom they had con&s;ulted before applying to the dea|con, and who were afterwards required to give their te&s;timony, concerning the nature and malignancy of the different di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;eventh</HI> ob&s;ervation is, That &s;ome of the cures atte&s;ted were <HI>incomplete.</HI> Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> was manife&s;tly the ca&s;e of the Spaniard, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> only from the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> complaint.

Not only was &s;he confined to her bed, for many days, after the de|crea&s;e of her drop&s;y; but the &s;till remained incapable of moving two of her &s;ingers. Silva, phy&s;ician to the Duke of Orleans, atte&s;ted this; adding expre&s;sly, that he <HI>could not look on her as being cured.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>eighth</HI> and la&s;t ob&s;ervation I &s;hall make on this &s;ubject is, That the relief granted &s;ome of them was but <HI>temporary.</HI> This was clearly proved to be the ca&s;e of the Spani&s;h gentleman. That &s;oon after his return home, he relap&s;ed into his former malady, the prelate I have often quoted, hath, by the certi|ficates and letters which he procured from Madrid, put beyond controver&s;y. Among the&s;e, there are let|ters from a Spani&s;h grandee, Don Francis Xavier, and from the patient's uncle, be&s;ides a certificate &s;igned by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>After the above ob&s;ervations, I believe, there will be no occa&s;ion for &s;aying much on this &s;ubject. The author has, in a note, artfully enough pointed out his aim, that it might not be overlooked by the carele&s;s reader
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 196.</NOTE>. "There is another book," &s;ays he, <Q>in three volumes, (called <HI>Recueil des miracles de l' Abbe Paris,</HI>) giving an account of many of the&s;e miracles, and accompanied with prefatory di&s;|cour&s;es, which are very well wrote
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I am &s;urpri&s;ed that Mr Hume hath taken no notice of the profound erudition di&s;played in the <HI>Recueil,</HI> as I imagine its au|thor is much more eminent for this, than for his talent in wri|ting. Be&s;ides, his learning de&s;erves our regard the more, that it is of a kind rarely to be met with in the pre&s;ent century. Where &s;hall we find in the&s;e dregs of the ages, to adopt his own emphatical expre&s;&s;ion, &s;uch an exten&s;ive knowledge, as he hath exhibited, of all the monki&s;h and legendary writings of the dark|e&s;t and mo&s;t barbarous, or, according to him, the mo&s;t devout ages of the church? Or whence el&s;e, but from tho&s;e productons, could he have &s;elected &s;uch admirable materials for his work? The lives and writings of the &s;aints are an inexhau&s;tible trea&s;ure for a performance of this kind. 'Tis true, St Mathew, St Mark, St Luke, and St John, have &s;aid little to his purpo&s;e, and he makes as little u&s;e of them. But is not this want richly &s;uppli|ed in St Cudbert, St Edildride, St Willibrord, St Baudri, and five hundred others of equal note? One thing however I would gladly be informed of, being utterly at a lo&s;s to account for it. What intitled this author, who &s;eems not to be deficient in a ve|neration truly catholic for ignorance, &s;uper&s;tition, and barbari&s;m, to &s;peak contemptibly of Capgravius, Colganus, and Jacobus de Voragine author of <HI>The golden legend?</HI> To be plain with him, this is a freedom which doth not at all become him: for of <HI>the &s;ew</HI> readers in this age, who happen to be acquainted with the autho|rities quoted in the <HI>Recueil,</HI> mo&s;t, if not all, will, I'm afraid, be of opinion, that the writers la&s;t mentioned are fully as credible, not le&s;s famous, and much more ingenious, than many of tho&s;e to whom he is &s;o greatly indebted for his mo&s;t extraordinary nar|rative. Was it for him then to &s;candalize <HI>the&s;e few?</HI> 'Tis pity that a writer of &s;uch uncommon reading and application &s;hould act &s;o incon&s;i&s;tently, and undermine his own cau&s;e. But pa&s;&s;ing his literature, which is unque&s;tionable, I &s;hall give the reader a &s;pecimen of his talent in di&s;putation. To the objection that had been made, that the miracles of the deacon were gradual, he re|plies, "So was <HI>the creation,</HI> the fir&s;t of miracles, which employed no le&s;s than &s;ix days." As all that was done in that time, is comprehended under <HI>one name,</HI> THE CREATION, he concludes ve|ry &s;agely, that it ought to be denominated <HI>one miracle.</HI> A wri|ter of this &s;tamp would no doubt de&s;pi&s;e the an&s;wer which an ordinary reader might make him,&mdash;<HI>fir&s;t,</HI> That every &s;ingle pro|duction was a perfect miracle,&mdash;<HI>&s;econdly,</HI> That nothing could be more in&s;tantaneous than tho&s;e productions, <HI>God &s;aid, let there be light, and there was light, &amp;c.</HI>&mdash;and <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> That the world was not created by the mini&s;tration of man, nor in the pre&s;ence of men, nor in order to &s;erve as evidence of any doctrine. I mu&s;t be forgiven to remark, that in the whole of this author's reply, he hath unfortunately mi&s;taken the meaning of the objectors, who intend not to &s;ay, that God may not perform a miracle gra|dually, but that what is &s;o performed, hath not the &s;ame evi|dence of its being miraculous, as what is done in an in&s;tant, and therefore cannot &s;o well &s;erve as evidence of any doctrine. Now that the miracles of Mon&s;ieur de Paris were intended as evidence of his doctrine, and con&s;equently of that of the appellants from the bull <HI>Unigenitus,</HI> he every where vehemently maintains. Ano|ther &s;pecimen of this author's acutene&s;s and ingenuity I &s;hall give in a literal tran&s;lation from his own words. <Q>But, it will be &s;aid, in the earlie&s;t times of the church, miraculous cures were commonly perfected in an in&s;tant. True; and 'tis this which confirms my doctrine. As it was ordinary then, to convert great &s;inners all of a &s;udden. But &s;uch wonders in both kinds are for the commencement of the church, or for the renovation promi&s;ed her. In the&s;e days, which the French clergy have ju&s;tly &s;tyled <HI>the dregs of the ages,</HI> 'tis much that God convert many &s;inners, and cure many &s;ick, by &s;low degrees, at the &s;ame time that he &s;hows by &s;ome more &s;hining exam|ples that his arm is not &s;hortened.</Q></NOTE>.</Q> He adds,

The im|piety of &s;uch a compari&s;on he mentions with horror, and treats the charge as an ab&s;olute calumny.

'Tis indeed, Mr Hume, a judicious ob&s;ervation you have given us; that we ought to <Q>lend a very academic &s;aith to every report which &s;avours the pa&s;&s;ion of the reporter; in whatever way it &s;trikes in with his natural inclinations and propen&s;ities.</Q> p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0.</NOTE>.</Q> At fir&s;t reading, one is apt, with

But on this point we are not long held in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. He &s;ubjoins, <Q>As, if the te&s;timony of men could ever be put in the balance with that of
<PB N="146" REF="022387_0155_0FB863DFB41AB6F0">God him&s;elf, who conducted the pen of the in&s;pi|red writers.</Q> An ingenious piece of raillery with|out que&s;tion. Is it po&s;&s;ible, in a politer man|ner, or in more obliging terms, to tell the Chri&s;tian world, <HI>They are fools;</HI> and that all who are &s;illy enough to believe the miracles recorded in &s;cripture, are not intitled to be argued with as <HI>men?</HI> How? They are &s;o ab&s;urd as to believe the &s;criptures to be the word of God, on the evidence of the miracles wrought by our Lord and his apo&s;tles; and that the&s;e miracles were wrought, they could not believe on any te&s;timony, le&s;s than that of God, reporting them in the &s;criptures: and thus, by making in&s;piration and miracles reciprocally foundations to each other, they, in effect, admit both without any foundation at all. After this hand&s;ome compliment to the friends of holy writ, he thinks him&s;elf at liberty to be very ex|plicit on the comparative evidence of the miracles of the <HI>Abb&egrave;,</HI> and tho&s;e of Je&s;us: <Q>If the&s;e writers in|deed were to be con&s;idered merely as human te&s;ti|mony, the French author is <HI>very moderate</HI> in his compari&s;on; &s;ince he might, <HI>with &s;ome appearance of rea&s;on,</HI> pretend, that the Jan&s;eni&s;t miracles <HI>much &s;urpa&s;s</HI> the other, in evidence and authority.</Q> Was ever &s;o rough an a&s;&s;ault, preceded by &s;o &s;mooth, but &s;o in&s;idious a preamble? Is it then &s;till the fate of Je&s;us to be betrayed with a ki&s;s? But notwith&s;tand|ing this author's declaration, no Chri&s;tian will have rea&s;on to dread the i&s;&s;ue of the compari&s;on. Mr Hume hath not entered on particulars, neither &s;hall I enter on them. I &s;hould not incline to tire my rea|der with repetitions, which, in a minute inquiry,
<PB N="147" REF="022387_0156_0FB863E1E8A60950">would be inevitable. I &s;hall therefore only de&s;ire him, if he think it needful, to peru&s;e a &s;econd time the eight foregoing ob&s;ervations. Let him try the miracles of our Lord by this touch &s;tone; and I per&s;uade my&s;elf, he will be &s;atisfied, that there is <HI>no appearance of rea&s;on</HI> to pretend, that the Jan&s;eni&s;t miracles <HI>much &s;urpa&s;s</HI> the other, or even equal them, in evidence and authority.</P>
<P>The author triumphs not a little in the ob&s;ervati|on, that the reports of the prodigies performed by the deacon, were violently oppo&s;ed by the civil ma|gi&s;trate, and by the Je&s;uits, the mo&s;t learned &s;ociety in the kingdom. He could &s;ee the importance of this circum&s;tance in the the ca&s;e of <HI>Abb&egrave;</HI> Paris, tho' not in the ca&s;e of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. But that the differ|ence of the ca&s;es as well as their re&s;emblance, may better appear; it ought likewi&s;e to be ob&s;erved, that Jan&s;eni&s;m, tho' not the <HI>ruling</HI> faction, was at that time the <HI>popular</HI> faction; that this popularity was not the effect of the miracles of the <HI>Abb&egrave;,</HI> but ante|cedent to tho&s;e miracles; that, on the contrary, the Je&s;uits were extremely <HI>unpopular;</HI> and that many, who had no more faith in the miracles of Saint Medard than Mr Hume hath, were well plea&s;ed to connive at a delu&s;ion, which at once plagued and mortified a body of men, that were become almo&s;t univer&s;ally odious.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, that nothing could more effec|tually expo&s;e the folly of tho&s;e preten&s;ions, than the expedient by which they were made to cea&s;e: In con&s;equence of an order from the King, the &s;epulchre was inclo&s;ed with a wall, and the votaries were de|barred
<PB N="148" REF="022387_0157_0FB863E2D042DB68">barred from approaching the tomb. The author &s;ays, in relation to this
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 198. in the note.</NOTE>, <Q>No Jan&s;eni&s;t was ever em|barra&s;&s;ed to account for the ce&s;&s;ation of the mira|cles, when the churchyard was &s;hut up by the Kings edict.</Q> Certain it is, that <Q>God is ma&s;ter of his own graces and works.</Q> But it is equally certain, that neither rea&s;on nor the go&s;pel leads us to think, that any human expedient will prove &s;ucce&s;s|ful, which is calculated to fru&s;trate the decrees of Heaven. Both, on the contrary, teach us, that men never more directly <HI>promote</HI> the de&s;igns of their Maker than when they intend directly to <HI>oppo&s;e</HI> them. It was not thus, that either Phari&s;ees or Sadducees, Jews or Gentiles, &s;ucceded in their oppo&s;ition to the mira|cles of Je&s;us and his apo&s;tles. The opinion of Gamaliel
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Actsv 38.39.</NOTE> was undoubtedly judicious: <HI>If this coun&s;el or this work be of men, it will come to nought; but if it be of God, ye</HI> CANNOT <HI>overthrow it; beware therefore, le&s;t ye be found fighting even again&s;t God.</HI> To conclude; Did the Jan&s;eni&s;t cau&s;e derive any advantage from tho&s;e preten|ded miracles? None at all. It even &s;uffered by them. It is ju&s;tly remarked by Voltaire

But there is ground to &s;u&s;pect, that, in &s;uch in&s;tances, the a&s;cent of rea&s;on, as the author elegant|ly expre&s;&s;eth it

There is, however, one que&s;tion di&s;tinct from the former, tho' akin to it, which, even from the principles of rea&s;on, we may with great probabi|lity
<PB N="150" REF="022387_0159_0FB863E5C78D45F8">determine. The que&s;tion I mean is, Whether the world had an origin or not?</P>
<P>That there hath been an infinite, eternal, and in|dependent &s;eries of finite, &s;ucce&s;&s;ive, and dependent beings, &s;uch as men, and con&s;equently that the world had no beginning, appears, from the bare con&s;iderati|on of the thing, extremely incredible, if not altoge|ther ab&s;urd. The ab&s;tract argument u&s;ed on this head, might appear too metaphy&s;ical and refined: I &s;hall not therefore introduce it; but &s;hall recur to to|pics which are more familiar, and which, tho' they do not demon&s;trate, that it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible that <HI>the world hath exi&s;ted from eternity,</HI> clearly evince that is highly improbable, or rather, certainly fal&s;e. The&s;e topics I &s;hall only mention, as they are pret|ty obvious, and have been often urged with great en|ergy by the learned, both ancient and modern. Such are, the late invention of letters, and of all the &s;cien|ces and arts by which human life is civilized; the known origin of mo&s;t nations, &s;tates and kingdoms; and the fir&s;t peopling of many countries. 'Tis in our power at pre&s;ent to trace the hi&s;tory of every people, backwards to times of the greate&s;t barbarity and ig|norance. Europe, tho' not the large&s;t of the four parts into which the earth is divided, is, on many ac|counts, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable. But what a different face doth Europe wear at pre&s;ent, from what it wore three thou&s;and years ago? How immen&s;e the odds in knowledge, in arts, in policy, in every thing? How ea&s;y is the intercour&s;e, and how exten&s;ive the acquaintance, which men can now enjoy with all, even the remote&s;t regions of the globe, compared with
<PB N="151" REF="022387_0160_0FB863EB8257CEC8">what was, or could have been enjoyed, in that time of darkne&s;s and &s;implicity? A man differs not more from a child, than the human race now differs from the human race then. Three thou&s;and years ago, appear indeed to mark a very di&s;tant epoch; and yet it is but as ye&s;terday, compared with eternity. This, when duly weighed, every thinking per&s;on will ac|knowledge to be as &s;trong moral evidence, as the &s;ubject can admit, (and that I imagine is very &s;trong) that the world had a beginning.</P>
<P>I &s;hall make a &s;uppo&s;ition, which will perhaps ap|pear whim&s;ical, but which will tend to elucidate the argument I am enforcing. In antediluvian times, when the longevity of man was &s;uch as to include &s;ome centuries, I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e, that a few boys had been imported to a de&s;art i&s;land, and there left toge|ther, ju&s;t old enough to make &s;hift to &s;u&s;tain them|&s;elves, as tho&s;e in the golden age are fabled to have done, on acorns, and other &s;pontaneous productions of the &s;oil. I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e, that they had lived there for &s;ome hundreds of years, had remembered nothing of their coming into the i&s;land, nor of any other per&s;on what&s;oever; and that thus they had never had acce&s;s to know, or hear, of either birth or death. I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e them to enter into a &s;erious di&s;qui&s;ition con|cerning their own duration, the que&s;tion having been &s;tarted, Whether they had exi&s;ted from eternity, or had once begun to be? They recur to memory, but memory can furni&s;h them nothing certain or de|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ive. If it mu&s;t be allowed that it contains no trace of beginning of exi&s;tence, it mu&s;t al&s;o be allowed, that it reaches not beyond a few centuries at mo&s;t.
<PB N="152" REF="022387_0161_0FB863ED4B985E58">They ob&s;erve be&s;ides, concerning this faculty, that the further back it goes, it becomes the more indi&s;|tinct, terminating at la&s;t in confu&s;ion and darkne&s;s. Some things however they di&s;tinctly recollect, and are a&s;&s;ured of. They remember, they were once of much lower &s;tature, and of &s;maller &s;ize; they had le&s;s bo|dily &s;trength; and all their mental faculties were wea|ker. They know, that, in the powers both of bo|dy and of mind, they have advanced, by impercept|ible degrees, to the pitch they are now arrived at. The&s;e con&s;iderations, e&s;pecially when fortified by &s;ome analogous ob&s;ervations they might have made on the growth of herbs and trees, would have &s;hown the probability to be entirely on the &s;ide of tho&s;e who a&s;&s;erted, that their exi&s;tence had a beginning: And tho', on account of the narrow &s;phere of their knowledge and experience, the argument could not have appeared to them in all its &s;trength, we, from our long acquain|tance with nature, even ab&s;tracting from our know|ledge of man in particular, mu&s;t be &s;atisfied, that it would have been &s;trictly analogical and ju&s;t. Exactly <HI>&s;i|milar,</HI> the very <HI>&s;ame,</HI> I &s;hould rather &s;ay, is the argument I have been urging for the origination of the &s;pecies.

Now, if it be granted, that the human &s;pe|cies mu&s;t have had a beginning, it will hardly be que|&s;tioned, that every other animal &s;pecies, or even that the univer&s;e, mu&s;t have had a beginning.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="022387_0162_0FB863EEC80D6E90">
BUT in order to prove the propo&s;ition laid down in the title of this &s;ection, 'tis not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;up|po&s;e, that the world had a beginning. Admit it had not, and ob&s;erve the con&s;equence. Thus much mu&s;t be admitted al&s;o, that not barely for a <HI>long continued,</HI> but for an ETERNAL, &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of generations, mankind were in a &s;tate little &s;uperior to the bea&s;ts; that of a &s;udden, there came a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing change upon the &s;pecies; that they exerted talents and capacities, of which there appeared not the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tige, during the eternity preceding; that they acquired &s;uch knowledge as procured them a kind of empire, not only over the vegetable and a|nimal worlds, but even, in &s;ome re&s;pect, over the elements, and all the unwieldy powers of matter; that, in con&s;equence of this, they were quickly rai&s;ed, much more above the &s;tate they had been formerly and eternally in, than &s;uch their former and eternal &s;tate was above that of the brute creation. If &s;uch a revolution in nature, &s;uch a thorough, general, and &s;udden change as this, would not be denominated miraculous, 'tis not in my power to conceive what would. I could not e&s;teem it a greater miracle, hardly &s;o great, that any &s;pecies of bea&s;ts, which have hitherto been doomed to tread the earth, &s;hould now get wings, and float about in the air.</P>
<P>Nor will this plea be &s;ubverted by that trite ob|jection, That mankind may have been as much en|lightened, perhaps myriads of years ago, as they are at pre&s;ent; but that by &s;ome <HI>univer&s;al</HI> calamity, &s;uch as deluge or conflagration, which, after the rotation of many centuries, the earth po&s;&s;ibly becomes liable
<PB N="154" REF="022387_0163_0FB863F304D9E1E0">to, all traces of crudition and of &s;cience, all traces both of the elegant and of the u&s;eful arts, may have been effaced, and the human race, &s;pringing from a few who had e&s;caped the common ruin, may have emerged anew, out of barbarity and ignorance. This hypothe&s;is doth but &s;ub&s;titute one miracle in the place of another. Such general di&s;order is en|tirely unconformable to our experience of the cour&s;e of nature. Accordingly the de&s;truction of the world by a deluge, the author hath numbered among tho&s;e prodigies, or miracles, which render the Pentate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch perfectly incredible.</P>
<P>IF, on the contrary, we admit, that the world had a beginning, (and will not every thinking per&s;on acknowledge, that this po&s;ition is much more pro|bable than the contrary?) the production of the world mu&s;t be a&s;cribed either to <HI>chance,</HI> or to <HI>in|telligence.</HI></P>
<P>Shall we derive all things, &s;piritual and corporeal, from a principle &s;o in&s;ignificant as blind <HI>chance?</HI> Shall we &s;ay, with Epicurus, that the fortuitous cour&s;e of rambling atoms hath reared this beautiful and &s;tupendous fabric? In that ca&s;e, perhaps, we &s;hould give an account of the origin of things, which, mo&s;t people will think, could not properly be &s;tyled miraculous. But is it, becau&s;e the formation of a grand and regular &s;y&s;tem in this way, is conformable to the experienced order of nature? Quite the re|ver&s;e. Nothing can be more repugnant to univer&s;al experience, than that the lea&s;t organic body, not to mention the glorious frame of nature, &s;hould be pro|duced
<PB N="155" REF="022387_0164_0FB863F6104E1280">by &s;uch a ca&s;ual jumble. It has therefore, in the highe&s;t degree po&s;&s;ible, that particular quality of miracles, from which, according to the author's the|ory, their incredibility re&s;ults, and may doubtle&s;s, in this loo&s;e acceptation of the word, be termed <HI>mira|culous.</HI> But &s;hould we affirm, that, to account thus for the origin of the univer&s;e, is to account for it by miracle; we &s;hould be thought, I'm afraid, to &s;peak both weakly and improperly. There is &s;omething here, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, which is far beyond the miraculous; &s;omething, for which I know not whether any language can afford a proper appellation, unle&s;s it be the general appellations of <HI>ab&s;urdity</HI> and <HI>non&s;en&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Shall we then at la&s;t recur to the common doctrine, that the world was produced by an <HI>intelligent cau&s;e?</HI> On this &s;uppo&s;ition al&s;o, tho' incomparably the mo&s;t rational, it is evident, that in the creation, formation, or fir&s;t production of things, call it by what name you plea&s;e, a power mu&s;t have been exerted, which, in re&s;pect of the pre&s;ent cour&s;e of nature, may be &s;tyled <HI>miraculous.</HI> I intend not to di&s;pute about a word, nor to inquire, whether that term can, in &s;trict propriety, be u&s;ed of any exertions before the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the laws of nature.

I cannot conceive an hypothe&s;is, which is not reducible to one or other of tho&s;e above-mentioned.

The contra&s;t we di&s;cern betwixt the ISRAELITES, and the ancient GREEKS and ROMANS, is remarkable. The GRFEKS and ROMANS, on all the &s;ubjects of human erudition, on all the liberal and the u&s;eful arts, rea|&s;oned like <HI>men;</HI> on the &s;ubject of religion, they prated like <HI>children.</HI> The ISRAELITES, on the contrary, in all the &s;ciences and arts, were <HI>children;</HI> but, in their notions of religion, they were <HI>men;</HI> in the doctrines, for example, of the unity, the eternity, the omnipotence, the omni&s;cience, the omnipre&s;ence, the wi&s;dom, and the goodne&s;s of God; in their opinions concerning providence, and creation, the pre&s;ervation and government of the world; opinions &s;o exalted and comprehen&s;ive, as, even by the au|thor's acknowledgment, could never enter into the thoughts of barbarians.</P>
<P>But to proceed in the revi&s;al: We have here a book, &s;ays the e&s;&s;ayi&s;t, "wrote in all probability long after the facts it relates."

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This in particular merits our attention the more, that it cannot, by any explication, be made to agree with the doctrine which obtained among the Pagans, commonly called <HI>the Mytho|logy.</HI> Ovid is &s;o &s;en&s;ible of this that, when he mentions a dei|ty as the efficient cau&s;e of the creation, he leaves him, as it were, detached from tho&s;e of the popular &s;y&s;tem, which it was his bu|&s;ine&s;s as a poet to deliver, being at a lo&s;s what name to give him, or what place in nature to a&s;&s;ign him. Qui&s;quis fuit ille deorum. <HI>Whichever of the gods it was.</HI> He well knew that, in all the catalogue of their divinities, the god who made the world was not to be found, that the&s;e divinities them&s;elves were, on the contary, produced out of the chaos, as well as men and bea&s;ts. Mr Hume in his <HI>Natu|ral hi&s;tory of religion,</HI> IV. remarks this conduct in Ovid, and a&s;|cribes it to his having lived in a learned age, and having been in&s;tructed by philo&s;ophers in the principle of a divine formation of the world. For my part, I very much que&s;tion, whether a|ny nation was ever yet indebted, for this principle, to the di&s;qui|&s;itions of philo&s;ophers. Had this opinion never been heard of, till the Augu&s;tan age, it might indeed have been &s;u&s;pected, that it was the daughter of philo&s;ophy and &s;cience, but &s;o far is this from being the ca&s;e, that &s;ome ve&s;tiges of it may be traced even in the earlie&s;t, and mo&s;t ignorant times. Thales the Mil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ian, who lived many centuries before Ovid, had, as Cicero, in his fir&s;t book <HI>De natura deorum,</HI> informs us, attributed the origin of all things to God. Ana<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">agoras had al&s;o denominated the form|ing principle, which &s;evered the elements, created the world, and brought order out of confu&s;ion, <HI>intelligence</HI> or <HI>mind</HI> It is therefore much more probable that the&s;e ancients owed this doc|trine to a tradition handed down from the earlie&s;t ages, which even all the ab&s;urdities of the theology they had embraced had not been able totally to era&s;e, tho' the&s;e ab&s;urdities could never be made to coale&s;ce with this doctrine. At the &s;ame time I ac|knowledge, that there is &s;omething &s;o noble and &s;o rational in the principle, <HI>That the world was produced by an intelligent cau&s;e,</HI> that &s;ound philo&s;ophy will ever be ready to adopt it, when once it is propo&s;ed. But that this opinion is not the offspring of philo|&s;ophy, may be rea&s;onably deduced from this con&s;ideration al&s;o, that they were not the mo&s;t enlightened or philo&s;ophic nations, among&s;t whom it was maintained in greate&s;t purity. I &s;peak not of the Hebrews. Even the Parthians, Medes and Per&s;ians, whom the Greeks con&s;idered as barbarians, were genuine thei&s;ts, and notwith&s;tanding many &s;uper&s;titious practices which prevail|ed among them, they held the belief of one eternal God the cre|ator and the lord of the univer&s;e. If this principle is to be deri|ved from the utmo&s;t improvement of the mind in ratiocination and &s;cience, which is Mr Hume's hypothe&s;is, the phenomenon ju&s;t now ob&s;erved is unaccountable. If, on the contrary, it is to be derived originally from revelation, pre&s;erved by tradition, thro' &s;ucce&s;&s;ive genrations, nothing can more ca&s;ily be accounted for. Traditions are always longe&s;t retained, and mo&s;t purely tran&s;|mitted, in or near the place where they were fir&s;t received, and among&s;t a people who po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;trong attachment to their anci|ent laws and cu&s;toms. Migrations into di&s;tant countries, mix|ture of different nations, revolutions in government and maners, yea and ingenuity it&s;elf, all contribute to corrupt tradition, and do &s;ometimes wholly efface it. This I take to be the only admi&s;|&s;ible account, why &s;o rational and &s;o philo&s;ophical a principle pre|vailed mo&s;t in ages and countries in which rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy &s;eemed to be but in their infancy. The notion, that the Greeks borrowed their opinions on this &s;ubject from the books of Mo|&s;es, a notion for which &s;ome Jewi&s;h writers, &s;ome Chri&s;tian fa|thers, and even &s;ome moderns have warmly contended, appears void of all foundation. The&s;e opinions in Greece, as hath been ob&s;erved, were of a very early date; whereas that there exi&s;ted &s;uch a people as the Jews, &s;eems &s;carce to have been known there till about the time of the Macedonian conque&s;ts. No &s;ooner were they known than they were hated, and their laws and cu&s;|toms univer&s;ally de&s;pi&s;ed. Nor is there the &s;hadow of rea&s;on to think, that the Greeks knew any thing of the &s;acred writings till a con&s;iderable time afterwards, when that ver&s;ion of them was made into their language which is called <HI>He tran&s;lation of the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty.</HI></NOTE>, the formation of

<P>But to return: The author &s;ubjoins, <Q>re&s;em|bling tho&s;e fabulous accounts, which every nation gives of its origin.</Q> 'Tis unluckily the fate of ho|ly writ with this author that both its re&s;emblance,
<PB N="164" REF="022387_0173_0FB8640866941D28">and its want of re&s;emblance, to the accounts of other authors, are alike pre&s;umptions again&s;t it. He hath not indeed told us, wherein it re&s;embles fabulous ac|counts: and, for my part, tho' the charge were ju&s;t I &s;hould imagine, little or nothing to the di&s;advantage of the Pentateuch, could be deduced from it. It is u|niver&s;ally agreed among the learned, that even the mo&s;t ab&s;urd fables of idolaters, derive their origin from facts, which having been, in barbarous ages, tran&s;mitted only by oral tradition, have come at length to be gro&s;sly corrupted and disfigured. 'Tis neverthele&s;s probable, that &s;uch fictions would &s;till retain &s;ome &s;tricking features of tho&s;e truths, from which they &s;prung. And if the books of Mo&s;es re|&s;emble, in any thing, the fabulous accounts of other nations, it would not perhaps be difficult to prove, that they re&s;emble only whatever is lea&s;t fabulous in the&s;e accounts. That this will be found to be the ca&s;e, we may rea&s;onably pre&s;ume, even from what hath been ob&s;erved already; and if &s;o, the re&s;em|blance, &s;o far from being an argument again&s;t tho&s;e books, is evidently an argument in their favour. In order to remove any doubt that may remain on this head, it ought to be attended to, that, in a num|ber of concurrent te&s;timonies, (where there could have been no previous concert) there is a probability in|dependent of that which re&s;ults from our faith in the witne&s;&s;es: nay, &s;hould the witne&s;&s;es be of &s;uch a cha|racter as to merit no faith at all. This probability ari&s;eth from the <HI>concurrence</HI> it&s;elf. That &s;uch a con|currence &s;hould &s;pring from <HI>chance,</HI> is as one to infinite, in other words, morally impo&s;&s;ible: if therefore con|cert be excluded, there remains no other cau&s;e but the reality of the fact.</P>

<P>It will perhaps be objected, That if the miracles continued no longer, and extended no further, than the nece&s;&s;ity of creation required, this rea&s;oning would be ju&s;t; but that in fact they both continued much longer, and extended much further. The an&s;wer is obvious: it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to judge, how far the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e required. Immediately af|ter the creation, things mu&s;t have been in a &s;tate ve|ry different from that which they are in at pre&s;ent. How long that &s;tate might continue, we have not the means of di&s;covering: but as, in human in|fancy, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary that the feeble creature &s;hould, for &s;ome time, be carried in the nur&s;e's arms, and afterwards, by the help of leading &s;trings, be kept from falling, before he acquire, &s;trength to walk; 'tis not unlikely, that in the infancy of the world, &s;uch interpo&s;itions &s;hould be more frequent and requi&s;ite, till nature attainining a certain maturity, tho&s;e laws and that con&s;titution &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed, which we now experience. It will greatly &s;trengthen this conclu&s;ion, to reflect, that in every &s;pecies of natural productions, with which we are acquainted, we invariably ob&s;erve a &s;imilar feeblene&s;s in the indivi|duals on their fir&s;t appearance, and a &s;imilar gradation towards a &s;tate of greater perfection and &s;tability. Be|&s;ides, if we acknowledge the nece&s;&s;ity of the exerti|on of a power, which only in reference to our expe|rience is called miraculous, the que&s;tion, as is well ob&s;erved by the judicious prelate formerly quoted

Tho&s;e fa|vourites of Heaven, it mu&s;t be likewi&s;e owned, are the countrymen of the writer; but of &s;uch a writer, as of all hi&s;torians or annali&s;ts, ancient or modern, &s;hows the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ition to flatter his countrymen. Where, I pray, do we find him, either celebrating their virtues, or palliating their vices; either extolling their genius, or magnifying their exploits? Add to all the&s;e, that, in every thing which is not expre&s;sly a&s;cribed to the interpo&s;al of Heaven, the relation is in it&s;elf plau&s;ible, the incidents are natural, the cha|racters

<P>WHEN all the&s;e things are &s;eriou&s;ly attended to, I per&s;uade my&s;elf, that no unprejudiced per&s;on will think, that the Pentateuch bears fal&s;ehood on the face of it, and de&s;erves to be rejected without ex|amination.

<P>"OUR mo&s;t holy religion," &s;ays the author in the conclu&s;ion of his e&s;&s;ay, <Q>is founded on faith, not on rea&s;on; and 'tis a &s;ure method of expo&s;ing it, to put it to &s;uch a trial, as it is by no means fitted to endure.</Q> If, by <HI>our mo&s;t holy religion,</HI> we are to under&s;tand the fundamental articles of the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, the&s;e have their foundation in the nature and decrees of God; and, as they are antece|dent to our faith or rea&s;onings, they mu&s;t be al&s;o in|dependent of both. If they are true, our di&s;belief can never make them fal&s;e; if they are fal&s;e, the belief of all the world will never make them true. But as the only que&s;tion between Mr Hume and the defenders of the go&s;pel, is, Whether there is rea&s;on to believe tho&s;e articles? he can only mean by <HI>our mo&s;t holy religion,</HI> our belief of the Chri&s;tian doctrine: and concerning this belief we are told, that it is founded on <HI>faith,</HI> not on rea&s;on; that is, our faith is founded on our faith; in other words, it hath no foundation, it is a mere chimera, the creature of a di&s;tempered brain. I &s;ay not on the contrary, that <HI>our mo&s;t holy religion</HI> is founded on <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> becau&s;e this expre&s;&s;ion, in my opinion, is both ambiguous and inaccurate; but I &s;ay that we have &s;ufficient rea&s;on for the belief of our religion; or, to expre&s;s my&s;elf in the words of an apo&s;tle, that the Chri&s;tian, if it is not his own fault, may <HI>be ready always to give an an&s;wer to every man, that a&s;keth</HI> him <HI>a</HI> REASON <HI>of</HI> his <HI>hope,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="022387_0180_0FB86419CA5493B8">
So far therefore am I from being afraid of expo&s;ing Chri&s;tianity by &s;ubmitting it to the te&s;t of rea&s;on; &s;o far am I from judging this a trial, which it is by no means fitted to endure, that I think, on the con|trary, the mo&s;t violent attacks that have been made upon the faith of Je&s;us, have been of &s;ervice to it. Yes: I do not he&s;itate to affirm, that our religion hath been indebted to the <HI>attempts,</HI> tho' not to the <HI>intentions,</HI> of its bittere&s;t enemies. They have tried its &s;trength indeed, and, by trying, they have di&s;|played its &s;trength; and that in &s;o clear a light, as we could never have hoped, without &s;uch a trial, to have viewed it in. Let them therefore write, let them argue, and, when arguments fail, even let them cavil again&s;t religion as much as they plea&s;e: I &s;hould be heartily &s;orry, that ever in this i&s;land, the a&s;ylum of liberty, where the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity is better under&s;tood (however defective the inhabi|tants are in the ob&s;ervance of its precepts) than in any other part of the Chri&s;tian world; I &s;hould, I &s;ay, be &s;orry, that in this i&s;land, &s;o great a di&s;&s;ervice were done to religion, as to check its adver&s;aries, in any other way, than by returning a candid an&s;wer to their objections. I mu&s;t at the &s;ame time ac|knowledge, that I am both a&s;hamed and grieved, when I ob&s;erve any friends of religion, betray &s;o great a diffidence in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> goodne&s;s of their cau&s;e (for to this diffidence it can only be imputed) as to &s;how an inclination for recurring to more forcible methods. The a&s;&s;aults of infidels, I may venture to prophe&s;y, will never overturn our religion. They will prove not more hurtful to the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, if 'tis al|lowed
<PB N="172" REF="022387_0181_0FB8641B06ADB398"><HI>to compare &s;mall things with great,</HI> than the boi&s;terous winds are &s;aid to prove to the &s;turdy oak. They &s;hake it impetuou&s;ly for a time, and loudly threaten its &s;ubver&s;ion; whil&s;t, in effect, they only &s;erve to make it &s;trike its roots the deeper, and &s;tand the firmer ever after.</P>
<P>ONE word more with the e&s;&s;ayi&s;t, and I have done. "Upon the whole," &s;ays he, <Q>we may conclude, that the <HI>Chri&s;tian religion,</HI> not only was at fir&s;t atten|ded with miracles, but even, at this day, cannot be believed by any rea&s;onable per&s;on without one. More rea&s;on is in&s;ufficient to convince us of its ve|racity; and whoever is moved by faith to a&s;&s;ent to it;</Q> that is, whoever by his belief is induced to believe it, <Q>is con&s;cious of a continued miracle in his own per&s;on, which &s;ubverts all the principles of his under&s;tanding, and gives him a determination to believe, what is mo&s;t contrary to cu&s;tom and ex|perience.</Q> An author is never &s;o &s;ure of writing unan&s;werably, as when he writes altogether unintel|ligibly. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould fight your enemy before you find him; and if he hath &s;creened him&s;elf in darkne&s;s, 'tis next to impo&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould find him. Indeed, if any meaning can be ga|thered from that &s;trange a&s;&s;emblage of words ju&s;t now quoted, it &s;eems to be one or other of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e which follow: <HI>either,</HI> That there are not any in the world, who believe the go&s;pel; <HI>or,</HI> That there is no want of miracles in our own time. How either of the&s;e remarks, if ju&s;t, can contribute to the author's pur|po&s;e, it will not, I &s;u&s;pect, be ea&s;y to di&s;cover. If
<PB N="173" REF="022387_0182_0FB8641E017467F0">the &s;econd remark is true, if there is no want of mi|racles at pre&s;ent, &s;urely experience cannot be pleaded again&s;t the belief of miracles &s;aid to have been per|formed in time pa&s;t. Again, if the fir&s;t remark is true, if there are not any in the world who believe the go&s;pel, becau&s;e, as Mr Hume &s;uppo&s;eth, a mi|racle cannot be believed without a new miracle, why all this ado to refute opinions which nobody enter|tains? Certainly, to u&s;e his own words, <Q>The knights-errant, who wandered about to clear the world of dragons and giants, never entertained the the lea&s;t doubt concerning the exi&s;tence of the&s;e mon&s;ters

<P>Might I pre&s;ume faintly to copy but the manner of &s;o inimitable an original, as the author hath exhibi|ted in his concluding words, I &s;hould al&s;o conclude upon the whole, That miracles are capable of proof from te&s;timony, and there is a full proof of this kind, for tho&s;e &s;aid to have been wrought in &s;upport of Chri|&s;tianity; that whoever is moved, by M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Hume's in|genious argument, to a&s;&s;ert, that no te&s;timony can give &s;ufficient evidence of miracles, admits for <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> tho' perhaps uncon&s;cious, a mere <HI>&s;ubtilty,</HI> which &s;ubverts the evidence of te&s;timony, of hi&s;tory, and e|ven of experience it&s;elf, giving him a determination to deny, what the common &s;en&s;e of mankind, founded in the primary principles of the under&s;tanding, would lead him to believe.</P>
