<HEAD>THE INTEREST OF THE MERCHANTS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE conte&s;t between Great-Britain and her Colonies, being now arrived at a height that calls for &s;ome &s;peedy deci&s;ion, and this con|te&s;t having been repre&s;ented as only a di&s;pute between the admini&s;tration and the colonies, the following &s;hort &s;tate of the ca&s;e is &s;ubmitted to the con&s;idera|tion of every candid Engli&s;hman; from which it will appear, how far the merchants and traders in the country are intere&s;ted in it, and on which &s;ide they ought to wi&s;h the deci&s;ion to fall.</P>
<P>It is admitted on the part of Great-Britain, that the Colonies are part of the dominions of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> and intitled, by birth, to all the rights and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of Engli&s;hmen, born within the I&s;land of Great Bri|tain; and in con&s;equence every native of the Colo|nies is eligible to, and many of them actually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="4" REF="014129_0003_0F9301A25FF86708">offices and employments in the &s;tate, and &s;eats in parliament, and may be the King's chief mini&s;ters in Great Britain. In all foreign countries, they have the &s;ame protection with the King's Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, and enjoy the &s;ame advantages of treaties and al|liances. Their per&s;ons and properties are equally protected by the laws of England, and they may, equally with the natives of Great Britain, become pro|prietors, by purcha&s;e or inheritance, of any lands within the i&s;land of Great Britain.</P>
<P>The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Crown in America are im|men&s;ely exten&s;ive, and the i&s;land of Great Britain, compared with them, appears very incon&s;iderable. No art or power can enlarge Great Britain, but their is abundant &s;cope in America for making additions, &s;till more exten&s;ive, to what the Crown already po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es there.</P>
<P>This mo&s;t important difference in the circum&s;tan|ces of the two territories requires a different plan of policy to be adopted in re&s;pect to the culture and improvement of each. But &s;till the per&s;onal rights of the inhabitants ought to continue the &s;ame; And the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of the &s;ubjects in the Colo|nies ought to be equally attended to, and promoted by government, as that of the &s;ubjects in England, for they are equally the King's &s;ubjects and Eng|li&s;hmen.</P>
<P>The lands in America have been granted by the Crown on very cheap terms to the occupiers; and where a country is &s;o very exten&s;ive, and the inha|bitants few, the lands mu&s;t continue cheap for many ages, in compari&s;on of the price of lands in Great Britain.&mdash;Should then the occupier of the Ameri|can lands cultivate the &s;ame products as are cultiva|ted in Great Britain, and have equal liberty to carry them to the &s;ame market, they mu&s;t pre&s;ently de|&s;troy
<PB N="5" REF="014129_0004_0F9301A31AF970F8">the commerce and culture of Great Britain, by &s;elling at a le&s;s price.&mdash;Now nothing could argue greater folly and wickedne&s;s, in any government, than the &s;uffering the people of the ancient dominions to be de&s;troyed, for the &s;ake of rai&s;ing a new Empire, and new &s;ubjects, in another part of the world.&mdash; Wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice and policy, therefore, required that the means to be u&s;ed, to forward the pro&s;perity of the new dominions, &s;hould be &s;uch as not to injure the old; and that, where all parts cannot have the &s;ame advantages, compen&s;ation &s;hould be made, for what is with held in one way, by the grant of &s;uperi|or advantages in another.</P>
<P>The right to the &s;oil of America is allowed to have been in the Crown of England, antecedent to the &s;et|tlement of any Engli&s;h &s;ubjects there; for the fir&s;t, and all future adventurers carried with them grants from the Crown, of the lands on which they &s;ettled; and all the lands in the Colonies are at this day held by their occupiers, under titles derived from the Crown. The Crown had, therefore, a right to pre|&s;cribe conditions to tho&s;e who obtained tho&s;e grants; and the grantees were bound, in law and equity, to a performance of tho&s;e conditions. Moreover, the adventurers in this new country &s;tood in need of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;uccour of their fellow &s;ubjects in Eng|land. They were unable to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, much le&s;s to protect them&s;elves. The bounty, the confidence, and humanity of individuals in England were freely exerci&s;ed towards them; and the power of the &s;tate, rai&s;ed and maintained at the &s;ole expence of the peo|ple of England, was fully exerted in their behalf. The people of England have, therefore, a right to reap advantage from the &s;ucce&s;s of the adventurers.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e two titles, of a right to the &s;oil in the Crown, and a right to compen&s;ation in the people of
<PB N="6" REF="014129_0005_0F9301A3D94037D8">England, let us view the conduct of the Legi&s;lature (which comprehends both) towards the Colonies. In re&s;pect to the per&s;ons of the natives of the Colonies, no di&s;tinction or difference has ever been made. There is not a &s;ingle Act of Parliament, from the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Colonies to this day which makes a di&s;tinction between a man born in England and a man born in America. The original equality has been inviolably adhered to. The &s;ame law and rights are for a native of America in England, as for an Engli&s;hman. And an Engli&s;hman is, in America, &s;ubject to the &s;ame law, and claims no others than a native there.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t violent partizan of the Colonies can here then have no ground of complaint; for neither the Crown or the people of England have here made any claim, or &s;ought compen&s;ation.</P>
<P>The lands of America, and their products, have alone been the objects upon which they have made any demands, and whether they have a&s;&s;erted their claims in an arbitrary, cruel, and unju&s;t manner, as the Colonies &s;ay they have, we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee.</P>
<P>The people of England and the American adven|turers being &s;o differently circum&s;tanced, it required no great &s;agacity to di&s;cover that, as there were many commodities which. America could &s;upply on better terms than they could be rai&s;ed in England, &s;o mu&s;t it be much more for the Colonies advantage to take others from England, than attempt to make them them&s;elves. The American lands were cheap, covered with woods, and abounded with native commodities. The fir&s;t attention of the &s;ettlers was nece&s;&s;arily engaged in cutting down the timber, and clearing the ground for culture; for before they had &s;upplied them&s;elves with provi&s;ions, and had hands to &s;pare from agriculture, it was impo&s;&s;ible they could
<PB N="7" REF="014129_0006_0F9301A49EA0D200">&s;et about manufacturing. England, therefore, under|took to &s;upply them with manufactures, and either purcha&s;ed her&s;elf, or found markets for the timber the Coloni&s;ts cut down upon their lands, or the fi&s;h they caught upon their coa&s;ts. It was &s;oon di&s;cover|ed that the tobacco plant was a native of, and flou|ri&s;hed in Virginia. It had been al&s;o planted in Eng|land, and was found to delight in the &s;oil. The Le|gi&s;lature, however, wi&s;ely and equitably con&s;idering that England had variety of products, and Virginia had no other to buy her nece&s;&s;eries with, pa&s;&s;ed an act prohibiting the people of England from planting tobacco, and thereby giving the monopoly of that plant to the Colonies. As the inhabitants increa&s;ed, and the lands became more cultivated, further and new advantages were thrown in the way of the Ame|rican Colonies. All foreign markets, as well as Great Britain, were open for their timber and provi&s;ions, and the Briti&s;h We&s;t India I&s;lands were prohibited from purcha&s;ing tho&s;e commodities from any other than them. And &s;ince England has found it&s;elf in danger of wanting a &s;upply of timber, and it has been judged nece&s;&s;ary to confine the export from America to Great Britain and Ireland, full and ample indem|nity has been given to the Colonies for the lo&s;s of a choice of markets in Europe, by very large bounties paid out of the revenue of Great Britain, upon the importation of American timber. And as a further encouragement and reward to them for clearing their lands, bounties are given upon the tar and pitch, which are made from their decayed and u&s;ele&s;s trees; and the very a&s;hes of their lops and branches, are made of value by the late bounty on American pot|a&s;hes. The &s;oil and climate of the Northern Colonies having been found well adapted to the culture of flax and hemp, bounties equal to half the fir&s;t co&s;t of tho&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="014129_0007_0F9301A567BD4378">commodities have been granted by Parliament, pay|able out of the Briti&s;h revenue, upon their importa|tion into Great Britain. The growth of rice in the Southern Colonies has been greatly encouraged, by prohibiting the importation of that grain into the Briti&s;h dominions from other parts, and allowing it to be tran&s;ported from the Colonies to the foreign territories in America, and even the &s;outhern parts of Europe. Indigo has been nurtured in tho&s;e Colonies by great parliamentary bounties, which have been long paid upon the importation into Great Britain; and of late are allowed to remain, even when it is carried out again to foreign markets. Silk and wine have al&s;o been objects of parliamentary munificence; and will one day probably become con&s;iderable Amer|rican products under that encouragement.</P>
<P>In which of the&s;e in&s;tances, it may be demanded, has the Legi&s;lature &s;hewn it&s;elf partial to the people of England and unju&s;t to the Colonies? Or wherein have the Colonies been injured? We hear much of the re&s;traints under which the trade of the Colonies is laid by Acts of Parliament, for the advantage of Great Britain, but the re&s;traints under which the peo|ple of Great Britain are laid by Acts of Parliament for the advantage of the Colonies, are carefully kept out of &s;ight; and yet upon a compari&s;on, the one will be found full as grievous as the other. For, is it a greater hard&s;hip on the Colonies, to be confined in &s;ome in&s;tances to the markets of Great Britain for the &s;ale of their commodities, than it is on the people of Great Britain to be obliged to buy tho&s;e commodities from them only? If the I&s;land Colonies are obliged to give the people of Great Britain the pre-emption of their &s;ugar and coffee, is it not a greater hard&s;hip on the people of Great Britain to be re&s;trained from pur|cha&s;ing &s;ugar and coffee from other countries, where
<PB N="9" REF="014129_0008_0F9301A623938F28">they could get tho&s;e commodities much cheaper than the Colonies make them pay for them? Could not our manufacturers have indigo much better and cheap|er from France and Spain than from Carolina? and yet is there not a duty impo&s;ed by Acts of Parliament on French and Spani&s;h indigo, that it may come to our manufacturers at a dearer rate than Carolina indi|go, tho' a bounty is al&s;o given out of <HI>the money</HI> of the people of England to the Carolina Planter, to enable him to &s;ell his indigo upon a <HI>par</HI> with the French and Spani&s;h? But the in&s;tance which has al|ready been taken notice of, the Act which prohibits the culture of the tobacco plant in Great Britain or Ireland, is &s;till more in point, and a more &s;triking proof of the ju&s;tice and impartiality of the &s;upreme Legi&s;lature; for what re&s;traints, let me a&s;k, are the Colonies laid under, which bear &s;o &s;trong marks of hard&s;hip, as the prohibiting the farmers in Great Bri|tain and Ireland from rai&s;ing, upon their own lands, a product which is become almo&s;t a nece&s;&s;ary of life to them and their families? And this mo&s;t extraor|dinary re&s;traint is laid upon them, for their avowed and &s;ole purpo&s;e of giving Virginia and Maryland a monopoly of that commodity, and obliging the peo|ple of Great Britain and Ireland to buy all the tobacco they con&s;ume from them, at the prices they think &s;it to &s;ell it for. The annals of no country that ever planted Colonies, can produce &s;uch an in&s;tance as this of regard and kindne&s;s to their Colonies, and of re|&s;traint upon the inhabitants of the Mother Country for their advantage. Nor is there any re&s;traint laid upon the inhabitants of the Colonies in return, which carries with it &s;o great appearance of hard&s;hip, altho' the people of Great Britain and Ireland have, from their regard and affection to the Colonies, &s;ubmitted to it without a murmer for near a century.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="014129_0009_0F9301A6DDD93470">
It is true the Legi&s;lature, in this as well as in other in&s;tances, has had a view to divert the Coloni&s;ts from manufacturing; but has not that object been pur|&s;ued by means the mo&s;t generous and ju&s;t? Ought the Coloni&s;ts to complain that they are <HI>diverted</HI> from working up their flax or hemp, by getting a better price for it rough, than they could hope to obtain by manufacturing it? Or is it blamable in the Legi&s;lature to excite them to the culture of commodities which yield a better profit from their cheap lands, than they could have by employing their labor in manufactur|ing? But why do they not manufacture? They are not hindered from making any commodity they might think fit for their own u&s;e, or erecting any machine for the purpo&s;e except mills for &s;litting iron. The only rea&s;on is, that they find it more their inter|e&s;t to cultivate their lands, and attend the fi&s;hery, than to manufacture. Their intere&s;t it is alone which re&s;trains them, and &s;uch is the wi&s;dom, the equity, the bounty of that government, they are &s;o impatient of, as to employ no other means to <HI>divert</HI> them from manufactures, than by giving them greater profits for their labour in other things. This is a point which cannot be too much inculcated, for it ought to be univer&s;ally known and con&s;idered, e&s;pecially by the trading part of this kingdom. I therefore repeat it, that the only means employed by the Legi&s;lature, for diverting the Colonies from manufacturing, is the giving them better prices for their labour in other things: and the Colonies well know this to be the ca&s;e, and they conduct them&s;elves according to that knowledge; for in every in&s;tance where they think they can employ their labour profitably in manufac|tures, they do it. This the people of England do not know, but they ought to be made acquainted with it. They imagine the inhabitants in the Colo|nies
<PB N="11" REF="014129_0010_0F9301A7AD85E288">are prohibited from making any thing for them|&s;elves, much more from trading in their own manu|factures: whereas the fact is, they are prohibited from making no one thing for their own u&s;e, or from exporting any one of their own manufactures; except hats, wool, and woollen goods. And they do make many things, and export &s;everal manufactures, to the exclu&s;ion of Engli&s;h manufactures of the &s;ame kinds. The New England people import from the foreign and the Briti&s;h I&s;lands, very large quantities of cotton, which they &s;pin and work up with linen yarn into a &s;tuff, like that made in Manche&s;ter, with which they clothe them&s;elves and their neighbours. Hats are manufactured in Carolina, Penn&s;ylvania, and in other Colonies. Soap and candles, and all kinds of wood-work, are made in the Northern Co|lonies, and exported to the Southern. Coaches cha|riots, chai&s;es, and chairs, are al&s;o made in the Nor|thern Colonies, and &s;ent down to the Sourthern. Coach-harne&s;s, and many other kinds of leather manufactures, are likewi&s;e made in the Nothern Co|lonies, and &s;ent down to the Southern; and large quantities of &s;hoes have lately been exported from thence to the We&s;t India i&s;lands. Linens are made to a great amount in Penn&s;ylvania; and cordage and other hemp manufactures are carried on in many places with great &s;ucce&s;s: and foundery ware, axes, and other iron tools and uten&s;ils, are al&s;o become ar|ticles of commerce, with which the Southern Colonies are &s;upplied from the Northern. Thus while the Le|gi&s;lature is paying the money of the people of Eng|land in bounties to one part of the American &s;ubjects, another is employed in rivalling the people of Eng|land in &s;everal of their mo&s;t valuable manufactures.</P>
<P>Thus far, at lea&s;t, the conduct of Great Britain to|wards the Colonies cannot ju&s;tly be taxed with op|pre&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="12" REF="014129_0011_0F9301A88720E7C8">nor the comparative &s;ituation of America deemed unequal and di&s;advantageous: But we are told by the advocates for American claims, that the profit of all their labors centers here, and that the in|habitants of America are condemned to work for the people of England; let us therefore examine the truth of the&s;e two propo&s;itions.&mdash;If it be true that the inhabitants of America are condemned to work for the people of England, is it not equally true that the people of England are condemned to work for the people of the Colonies? Nay, not for their fel|low-&s;ubjects there only, but for the &s;laves of their fel|low &s;ubjects! If a planter in Virginia rai&s;es tobacca for the Engli&s;h merchant, does not the Engli&s;h ma|nufacturer make him clothing for him&s;elf and his ne|groes in return; and wherein can the one be &s;aid to work for the other's advantage, more than the other does for his? Do any of the Colonies &s;end their pro|ducts to England for nothing, or do they take any thing from England in payment which they do not want? Does England fix prices upon their products, and &s;ay, You &s;hall &s;ell them to us for &s;o much; or does &s;he in&s;i&s;t upon their buying her commodities at higher prices than her own natives pay, or than &s;he &s;ells them for to other countries? Nothing of all this is pretended to be the ca&s;e; then pray in what &s;en&s;e is it that the people of the Colonies can be &s;aid to work for the people of England, other than that in which the people of England work for them? The thre&s;her may be &s;aid, it is true, to work for the mil|ler; but does not the miller work al&s;o for the thre&s;h|er? But the profit of all the labour of the Colonies centers in England. If this be true, the con&s;equence will plainly &s;hew it; for no &s;tate or &s;ociety of men was ever known to thrive by unprofitable labour. Whence then ari&s;es the pre&s;ent wealth and greatne&s;s
<PB N="13" REF="014129_0012_0F9301AC4614E668">of America, (of which we hear &s;o much upon other occa&s;ions) if England has reaped the fruit of all the labour of the Colonies? The &s;ettlers, we all know, did not carry great riches with them, and whence could they have acquired them, but from the profits of their labour? But the trade of England, &s;ay they, has been greatly augmented by the Colonies. It is by no means clear that the &s;ame increa&s;e would not have happened if the Colonies had never exi&s;ted; for Eng|land had many avenues open for her commercial indu|&s;try. But without pur&s;uing that con&s;ideration, from what &s;ource did the Colonies derive the ability, and the means of trading with England? Who paid for the axe and the &s;aw with which they cut down the tree, and made it into boards, to cover their huts at their fir&s;t landing? or through who&s;e credit have they &s;ince built towns, improved their farms, and erected for them&s;elves &s;tately hou&s;es? Is it not to the Eng|li&s;h merchants they are indebted for all their opulence? We &s;ee a recent in&s;tance of this in the Ceded I&s;lands; whil&s;t the Engli&s;h merchants gave them credit the ad|ventures were making large &s;trides to wealth and grandeur. The value of lands was every day rai&s;ing, plantations were &s;ettling, and towns &s;pringing out of the woods; but the in&s;tant that credit was with-held, the bubble bur&s;t, and the airy &s;cene vani&s;hed like a dream; di&s;tre&s;s and calamity &s;ucceeded to opulence and parade, and the highe&s;t e&s;timated lands can no longer find purcha&s;ers at any price: now, had the Engli&s;h merchants continued to give credit, and make advan|ces for the&s;e adventurers, their is no doubt their pro|jects would at length have &s;ucceeded; they would have rai&s;ed products, and, by indu&s;try and good ma|nagement, acquired fortunes. What then &s;hould we have thought of them, or what ought we to have thought of them, if, when they came to make remit|tances to the Engli&s;h merchants, they &s;hould have com|plained,
<PB N="14" REF="014129_0013_0F9301AE513D6808">that it was hard they &s;hould be condemned to work for the people of England; that England reaped all the fruits of their labour and indu&s;try, and that it was the highe&s;t cruelty and inju&s;tice to oblige them to &s;end their products to England, that the Engli&s;h merchants might gain a commi&s;&s;ion on the &s;ale of them?</P>
<P>The Northern Colonies, it is true, have not had &s;uch ample credit with the Engli&s;h merchants as the I&s;lands, but the circum&s;tances under which the plan|ters in both made their &s;ettlements, are not &s;o di&s;&s;imi|lar as to render what has been &s;tated re&s;pecting the one, inapplicable to the other. The great amount of their debt to the Engli&s;h merchants, is a full proof that it was upon the &s;tock of the people of England they have hitherto &s;ub&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>The merchants in the Colonies, no more than the planters in the continent, are wealthy men. They buy their goods in England, upon nine months cre|dit at lea&s;t; the planter is &s;upplied by them, through|out the year, upon the credit of his crop as the end of it. The planter has his hou&s;e to build, or improve|ments to make, or new land to clear and take in, all which requires ready money, and therefore, when his fir&s;t crop comes, he mu&s;t &s;ell it for ca&s;h, and cannot pay the merchant any thing towards the reduction of his debt that year. The acqui&s;ition of the next year's crop requires a fre&s;h advance; hence the planter be|comes indebted to the merchant for two year's &s;upply before he makes him any payment; and as it very &s;el|dom happens that at the end of the &s;econd year he pays the expence of one, he goes on increa&s;ing his debt, but at the &s;ame time increa&s;ing his e&s;tate in a much greater proportion; and all this time the Engli&s;h merchant, who &s;upports the whole, is without any returns.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="014129_0014_0F9301AE9123FC38">
Thus it is that England reaps the advantage of all the toil and labor of the Colonies. She pays for the purcha&s;e of the land, for the labor employed in clear|ing it, for the maintaining the &s;tock nece&s;&s;ary for its cultivation; her return is a commi&s;&s;ion upon the &s;ale of the produce, with a moderate intere&s;t, not very well paid, upon the capital advanced, while all the benefit of the increa&s;ed value belongs &s;olely to the Americans.</P>
<P>The truth of what has been advanced will be &s;till more evident from a compari&s;on of the &s;tate of the Colonies of other nations with our own. We have &s;een the &s;low progre&s;s the French made in Canada the many years they had it; and the large &s;trides it is making to wealth and importance &s;ince it became a Briti&s;h colony. Grenada too has flouri&s;hed in a &s;till greater degree, and the &s;ame cau&s;e has wrought the happy change in the circum&s;tances of both, which is no other than the &s;uperior credit given to the planters by the Engli&s;h merchants, to what they had from the French merchants. Now if we inquire into the cau&s;e of this unbounded confidence and credit given by the Engli&s;h merchants to the Colonies, from which the Colonies have reaped &s;o great advantage, it will come out to be <HI>the &s;ecurity which they have for the property by the operation of the laws of England in the Colonies;</HI> they give no &s;uch credit to the &s;ubjects of other &s;tates, either in Europe or America; and yet there are countries in which they might lay out their money to greater profits than in the Briti&s;h Colonies; but in foreign countries they cannot be certain of a legal &s;ecurity for their property, or a fair and effectual means of recovering it; whereas in the Briti&s;h Colonies they know the laws of England follow their property, and &s;ecures it for them in the

And indeed good rea&s;on it &s;hould be &s;o, for their is no want of evidence to &s;hew how willing the Colonies are to avail them&s;elves of Acts of their own A&s;&s;emblies to injure their Briti&s;h credi|tors; witne&s;s the attempts in Jamaica and Virginia to make the lands and negroes freehold, and not liable to the payment of book debts; &s;o that a Planter might buy lands and negroes on Engli&s;h credit, and leave them to his children, without paying a &s;hilling to the Engli&s;h merchant, with who&s;e money he bought them; and witne&s;s al&s;o a late Act of the A&s;&s;embly of Grenada, po&s;tponing the payments due to their Engli&s;h creditors for eighteen months. The&s;e and &s;uch like practices in the Colonies gave occa&s;ion to the act of Parliament the 5th of George the Second, for &s;ubjecting lands and negroes in the Colonies to the payment of Engli&s;h book debts, which may truly be called the Palladium of Colony credit, and the Engli&s;h merchant's grand &s;ecurity; and yet this Act of Parliament is one of tho&s;e which are now com|plained of by the Colonies, and the Briti&s;h merchants are mode&s;tly de&s;ired to apply to Parliament for its repeal, and thus ruin their trade and fortunes with their own hands <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following petition of &s;everal merchants of London to the King in the year 1732, and the report of the Lords of Trade there|upon, will &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of the interference of Parliament in the Briti&s;h merchant's behalf, and the great ground there was for pa&s;&s;ing the Act of that year, for the merchant's &s;ecurity, which the Colonies now want to &s;et a&s;ide.

The right of the Parliament to impo&s;e taxes, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> exerci&s;ing it over the Colonies, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> the &s;ubject of di&s;pute. All the late declarations of the Colonies, deny, inexpre&s;s terms, the authority of the Legi&s;lature to bind them in any ca&s;e what&s;oever. This is the avowed purpo&s;e of their oppo&s;ition to the execution of Acts of Parlia|ment, and of their ob&s;truction of the commerce of the people of England.</P>
<P>I acquit them of any intention of &s;eparating from Great Britain; for I believe them too wi&s;e to re|nounce all the advantages of being treated as Eng|li&s;hmen in Great Britain and throughout the world; of enjoying the protection of her fleet and armies equally with the people of England; and at the &s;ame time, neither contributing revenue to their &s;upport, or dealing with her for any thing which they can buy cheaper, or &s;ell dearer el&s;ewhere. They would no doubt like to continue to have the monopoly of &s;upplying the Briti&s;h We&s;t India I&s;lands with lumber and provi&s;ions; to have the monopoly of &s;upplying Great Britain and Ireland with tobacco; to receive large bounties upon other of their products out of the revenue of England; to have the advantage of fi&s;hing on the Engli&s;h fi&s;hing banks of Newfound|land; and in the gulph and river of the Engli&s;h con|quered Colony of Quebec, provided they continued to pay no revenue, were &s;ubject to no re&s;traints upon their trade, but might carry their commodities wher|ever they thought fit, import all &s;orts of goods from all countries, and lay out their money wherever they found they could buy cheape&s;t. This is all very na|tural, and no one can blame the Colonies for &s;eek|ing what is &s;o evidently for their own intere&s;t; but that they &s;hould expect the people of England, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> to countenance them in their
<PB N="19" REF="014129_0018_0F9301B15D92B590">pur&s;uits of a plan &s;o manife&s;tly ruinous to them, is indeed &s;uch a proof of their contempt for our under|&s;tandings as no people ever gave before. They plainly tell the Briti&s;h merchants, <Q>Gentlemen, we have now made fortunes out of your capital, and we find that the people in England pay &s;uch heavy taxes for the payment of the intere&s;t of a debt, which they contracted in our defence; and for the maintenance of a military force, of which we enjoy the protection; that &s;ome of their manufac|tures come higher charged to us, than we can get the like for from Holland or France: we al&s;o find, that from the &s;ame cau&s;e they cannot afford to give as high prices for &s;ome of our commodities, as we can &s;ell them for in other countries. Now there are certain Acts of Parliament, which oblige us to come to you for what we want; and to carry to you many of our commodities in pay|ment, we de&s;ire therefore that you will a&s;&s;i&s;t us in our endeavours to &s;et a&s;ide the authority of the&s;e laws, that we may trade where we will; and come no more to you but when we cannot do &s;o well el&s;ewhere. There is another thing too which we want you join to us in; we are prevented by an Act of Parliament from entailing our e&s;tates to the prejudice of our Engli&s;h creditors; we now owe them about four millions, and it this Act was out of our way, we could make all our families rich at once, by purcha&s;ing lands, and building hou&s;es, with this money, and &s;ettling them upon children, in&s;tead of paying our Engli&s;h creditors: but as we are afraid the Parliament might perceive our drift, in applying for repeals of the&s;e laws, or if they even repealed them <HI>now,</HI> they might here|after re-enact them; or others of a like nature, which would defeat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="20" REF="014129_0019_0F9301B220E7DFB8">ruins of England; we have taken up a re&s;olution of getting rid of all the&s;e acts at once, and at the &s;ame time making our&s;elves &s;ecure again&s;t all fu|ture Acts that might be made to our prejudice, or for your benefit. This re&s;olution is no other than to deny the authority of the Legi&s;lature to make any Acts whatever to bind us. In this our grand purpo&s;e, we hope you will do all you can by petitioning, in&s;tructing, and remon&s;trating in our behalf; for if you do not join us in de&s;troy|ing your&s;elves, we tell you once for all, that we will neither buy goods of you, nor pay you for tho&s;e we have already bought, for we are deter|mined to carry our point by one means or ano|ther.</Q></P>
<P>I appeal to the under&s;tandings of my countrymen whether this is an exaggerated repre&s;entation of the Colony claims, as &s;et forth and &s;tated in their &s;everal pamphlets, and the Re&s;olutions of their public A&s;|&s;emblies. And I think I need not u&s;e any further ar|guments to convince the merchants and manufactu|rers of Great Britain, how fatal to their intere&s;ts the &s;ucce&s;s of the Colonies in their de&s;igns mu&s;t be. The continuance of their trade to the Colonies, clearly and entirely depends upon the laws of England having authority there. It is their operation which binds the commerce of the Colonies to this country. It is their operation which gives &s;ecurity to the property of the trader &s;ent thither. Give up the authority of Parliament and there is an end to your trade, and a total lo&s;s of your property. But if that authority is &s;upported and maintained, the trade of the Colonies mu&s;t remain to Great Britain, and the property you intru&s;t them with will remain &s;ecure, protected by acts of Parliament made in your behalf.</P>
