<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Grand-Jury;</HI></P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, that of late there have been &s;everal Papers printed, with a De&s;ign and a Tendency to alienate the Affections of His Maje&s;ty's Subjects of this Province from the Per&s;ons whom His Maje&s;ty has thought it fitting to &s;et over them; and in particular, &s;ome Men with the utmo&s;t Vir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">ency have endeavoured to a&s;per&s;e his Excellency and vilify his Admini&s;tration; they have &s;pread abroad many &s;editious Libels, in order to le&s;&s;en in the People's Minds the Regard which is due to a Per&s;on in his high Station. This malevolent Practice <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> has laid me under the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;etting before you the Law in relation to Libels. And as ye are Gentlemen of Under&s;tanding and Integrity, and who will pay a due Regard to the Oaths ye have taken, I make no que&s;tion, but you will take &s;uch Notice as becomes you, of the Per&s;on who has had the Pre&s;umption to print them. The Authors are not certainly known, and yet it is an ea&s;y Matter to gue&s;s who they are, that by making U&s;e of Mr. <HI>Van Dam</HI>'s Name, have gain'd &s;ome credit among the common People, which they were not wont to have, and never thought to have de&s;erved.</P>
<Q><P>Every Libel is made either again&s;t a private Man or again&s;t a Magi&s;trate, or publick Per&s;on: If it be again&s;t a private Man, it de&s;erves a &s;evere Puni&s;h|ment, for although the Libel be made again&s;t one, yet it incites all tho&s;e of the &s;ame Family, Kindred or Society to Revenge; and tends by Con&s;equence
<PB N="2" REF="003696_0002_100248085C91CC08">
to Quarrels and Breach of the Peace, and may be the Cau&s;e of &s;hedding Blood, and of great Inconvenience; which it would be impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;train by the &s;evere&s;t Laws, were there no Redre&s;s from publick Ju&s;tice for Injuries of this Kind, which of all others are mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly felt. If the Libel be again&s;t a Magi&s;trate or other publick Per&s;on, it is a greater Offence; for it concerns not only the Breach of the Peace, but the Scandal of Government.</P>
<P>AND it is not material whether the Libel be true, or whether the Party be of good or evil Fame; for in a &s;ettled State of Government the Party grieved ought to complain for every Injury done him in an ordinary Cour&s;e of Law, and not by any Means to revenge him&s;elf either by the odious Cour&s;e of libelling or otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>POISONING is accounted a greater Offence than any open kind of Mur|der, becau&s;e it may be done &s;o &s;ecretly, that none can defend him&s;elf again&s;t it, for which Cau&s;e the Offence is the more dangerous, becau&s;e the Offender can|not ea&s;ily be known; and of &s;uch Nature is libelling; it is &s;ecret and robs a Man of his good Name, which ought to be more precious to him than his Life.</P></Q>
<P>LIBELLING a Per&s;on in &s;o high a Station as that of the Governor is of the more dangerous Con&s;equence, becau&s;e without his Concurrence, (as He is the King's Repre&s;entative here) we cannot leave &s;uch good and whole&s;om Laws, as this Colony &s;tands in need of; and certainly if he be libelled, and Endeavours be u&s;ed to vilify his Per&s;on and Admini&s;tration, and the Authors and Publi&s;her be &s;uffered to go on with impunity in &s;uch Practices, we &s;hall &s;carcely find him in a &s;uitable Temper to pa&s;s &s;uch Laws for the publick Good as &s;hall be laid before him.</P>
<P>IT is a difficult Thing to &s;ay what &s;ome Men would be at, or what it is will plea&s;e them; &s;ome Particulars of his Excellency's Conduct in this City were &s;aid to have given Offence, upon &s;ome of his Friends repre&s;enting to him what would be acceptable to the People in general, he made an Alteration in tho&s;e Points: And yet this too, is a &s;ubject for the&s;e Men's Di&s;like, &s;o that which way &s;oever he acts, they are re&s;olved to clamour: And in good Truth, now they have the greate&s;t Rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied, &s;ince they find that his Excellency is determined to do that which will be agreeable to the People, they are &s;en&s;ible he will by the&s;e Means effectually defeat their Mea&s;ures and render all their Schemes abortive.</P>
<P>THE Malice of the&s;e Men &s;topt not here; they have conde&s;cended to come a Step lower, and have been plea&s;ed to point out &s;everal of the Gentlemen of the Council, who happen to have Places of Tru&s;t under His Maje&s;ty in this Pro|vince: I &s;uppo&s;e they would &s;ugge&s;t by this, they are &s;o mercenary and &s;o aban|doned as to betray the Country and give up the Publick for the Sake of them. As for my own part, I am very ea&s;y under the&s;e Reproaches; I am a&s;&s;ured my Conduct in that or any other Station can &s;tand the Te&s;t of their mo&s;t malitious Inquiry: To make their Work compleat, the Judges of this Court have al&s;o had the Honour to be the Objects of their Re&s;entment, for &s;urely it cannot be a Di&s;honour to an hone&s;t Man to meet with the Anger and Ill-will of &s;ome Men. They have endeavoured by all kinds of Arts to make the People unea&s;y at the <HI>Court of Exchequer,</HI> and I &s;uppo&s;e buoy them&s;elves in their pro&s;perous Mi&s;chief; But I am per&s;uaded, that any Unea&s;ine&s;s, which is conceived at it, will in a little Time wear off and vani&s;h, as it is altogether owing to the mo&s;t unju&s;t Mi&s;|repre&s;entation of its Juri&s;diction, as if the Exerci&s;e thereof in a Court of Equity would take away that ine&s;timable Privilege of Trials by a <HI>Jury.</HI> This <HI>Gentle|men,</HI> is a wicked In&s;inuation made u&s;e of to inflame the Minds of the common People, and to render the Per&s;ons of the Judges, who gave their Opinions in &s;upport of this Juri&s;diction, odious to them. But I depend on it, that the Force of Truth will in a little Time remove the groundle&s;s Jealou&s;ies that have been rai&s;ed on this Occa&s;ion, by the Craft of evil-minded Men, who enraged

at their own Di&s;appointment care not into what Di&s;orders they bring us, to obtain their Ends.</P>
<P>THE Prejudices conceived again&s;t this Court oblige me to &s;ay &s;omething to &s;atisfy the Scruples that have indu&s;triou&s;ly been rai&s;ed in &s;ome Men's Minds concerning it.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Court of Exchequer</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> in which the Barons are Judges, is chiefly a Court for the King's Revenues, and has Cognizance of Pleas at the common Law, and a Power of determining Cau&s;es in a Cour&s;e of Equity by <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bill; The&s;e are the judicial Powers of the Barons, and have been &s;o Time out of Mind, and their Authority to determine Cau&s;es in Equity doth not ari&s;e from the Stat. 33. <HI>H.</HI> 8. as &s;ome hold; this appears in the 4 In&s;t. 119. We there find, that the Commons petitioned in 2 <HI>H.</HI> 4. (which then was the Method u&s;ed in making Acts of Parliament) that no Writs or Privy-Seals be &s;ued out of the <HI>Chancery, Exchequer,</HI> or other Place to any Man to appear upon Pain, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to an&s;wer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> contrary to the ordinary Cour&s;e of the common Law: Whereunto the King an&s;wered, <HI>That &s;uch Writs &s;hould not be granted without Nece&s;&s;ity.</HI> This Writ <HI>To appear upon Pain,</HI> is the <HI>Subpaena,</HI> which is the leading Proce&s;s in a Court of Equity. But this did not pa&s;s into a Law. In the third Year of <HI>H.</HI> 5. the Commons petitioned, that all Writs of <HI>Subpaena</HI> and <HI>Certes de cau&s;is</HI> going out of the <HI>Chancery</HI> and the <HI>Exchequer</HI> might be enrolled and not granted of Matters determinable at the common Law on Pain of <HI>Forty Pounds.</HI> The King's An&s;wer was, <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">t he would be advi&s;ed:</HI> Which is denying the Royal A&s;&s;ent to pa&s;s it into a Law. Hence it is evident, that the Court of <HI>Exchequer</HI> as well as <HI>Chancery</HI> did proceed in a Cour&s;e of Equity above One hundred Years before the making of this Statute 33 <HI>H.</HI> 8. which is &s;aid to give Birth to this Branch of its Juri&s;diction; &s;o that it mu&s;t have been Time out of Mind, &s;ince as My Lord <HI>Coke</HI> ob&s;erves, 4 In&s;t. 119. We find no former Act of Parliament that doth create and e&s;tabli&s;h it. <HI>Plowd. Com.</HI> 321. It is &s;aid, the Exchequer hath a Chancellor and Seal, and the Writs u&s;ual in the Chancery in the Exchequer to &s;eize Land are more antient than the Regi&s;ter or the Treati&s;e of <HI>Praerogativa Regis</HI> Upon which My Lord <HI>Coke</HI>'s Ob&s;ervation is this; <HI>Hereunto it is collected, that &s;eeing there hath been Time out of Mind of Man, a Chancellor of the Exchequer, that there should al&s;o be in the Exchequer a Court of Equity.</HI> For the&s;e Rea&s;ons we may conclude, that this Court did not derive its Juri&s;diction in Equity from that Statute, but from the common Law.</P>
<P>AS to the Stat. 33 <HI>H.</HI> 8. it may be &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of two Parts, the one for the Benefit and Advantage of the King, whereby a new Provi&s;ion is made for the levying of the Kings Debt in a more &s;peedy and effectual Manner, than the King had before: The other Part, is for the Benefit and Advantage of the Sub|ject, and gives him a Remedy where he had none before, and enables him, if he has any Matter, in Law, Rea&s;on, or good Con&s;cience, to bar or di&s;charge the Kings Debt, to &s;hew or plead the &s;ame, which by the common Law he could not do. All which appears in Sir <HI>Tho. Cecil</HI>'s Ca&s;e, 7 <HI>Rep.</HI> 18 <HI>b.</HI> Where although the Covenant and Obligation of Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> was broken and fotfeited by the Rigor of the Common Law, yet as he had Matter in Rea&s;on and good Con|&s;cience to di&s;charge him&s;elf, he by exhibiting his Engli&s;h Bill in the <HI>Exchequer</HI> was relieved again&s;t the <HI>Queen</HI>'s Demand by Virtue of this Statute; &s;o that this Statute gives the Subject a Remedy in Equity in the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> which he had not before. And the&s;e were the Ends for which this Statute was made.</P>
<P>AS for the <HI>Court of Exchequer</HI> here, I &s;hall give you, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> the ge|neral Rea&s;on upon which it is grounded, without de&s;cending into many Particulars; but before I come to that, it may not be improper to ob&s;erve, That Courts for the due Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice are e&s;&s;ential to every Community; No Government can or ever did &s;ub&s;i&s;t long without them; They are of ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity to &s;uppre&s;s Violence and to be Arbiters of the differences between contending Parties, That every Man may not become

his own Carver, and thereby a Door be laid open to all manner of Iniquity and Oppre&s;&s;ion. And in a Con&s;titution like ours, formed upon the Model and as nearly &s;imilar as Circum&s;tances will admit, to that of <HI>England,</HI> where Equity makes up a con|&s;iderable Part of the Law; Courts of Ju&s;tice are as nece&s;&s;ary here as there; tho&s;e that proceed in a Cour&s;e of Equity as well as tho&s;e that adhere more rigidly to the &s;trict Rules of the Common Law: For the Common Law lays it down as a Maxim, <HI>Rather to &s;uffer a Mi&s;chief than a general Inconvenience;</HI> and the Judges thereof are by their Oaths tied up to the &s;trict Rules of Law, and are bound to determine according to the known Cu&s;toms and Statutes of the Realm, although they are at the &s;ame Time &s;en&s;ible, that in &s;o doing, they are obliged to do an Act of manife&s;t Inju&s;tice; Hence is the Nece&s;&s;ity of Courts of Equity, to moderate the Rigor of the Law in &s;ome Ca&s;es, to give Relief again&s;t Frauds, Accidents and &s;uch like, and to prevent a Failure of Ju&s;tice, which would otherwi&s;e happen by &s;uch adhering to the &s;trict Rules of Law. And this alone is properly the Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Court of Equity, not to take away Trials by Jury, but to give Relief in Ca&s;es, where it is not to be had by the common Law: For Cau&s;es triable by common Law and a Jury are improper for a Court of Equity, <HI>Heb.</HI> 203.</P>
<P><HI>GENTLEMEN,</HI> The general Rea&s;on upon which the Court &s;tands here, is this: In ca&s;e of an uninhabited Country newly found out by <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subjects, all the Laws in Force in <HI>England,</HI> are in Force there. This is the Re&s;olution of My Lord <HI>Holt</HI> and the whole Court, and &s;eemed to be agreed at the Bar, <HI>Falk.</HI> 411. This is from the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Thing: For among a Number of Men, there mu&s;t unavoidably ari&s;e &s;ome Differences and Di&s;&s;entions; which it is mo&s;t natural to think they would determine by &s;uch Laws as they were acquainted with, which mu&s;t be by the Laws of their <HI>Mother Country;</HI> and there is the &s;ame Nece&s;&s;ity that it &s;hould be <HI>in &s;uch Courts</HI> and <HI>by &s;uch Officers</HI> and <HI>in &s;uch Methods</HI> as were known to them, and in U&s;e in their Mother Country. "For where Officers are wanting, &s;ays my Lord <HI>Holt,</HI> our Laws can have no Force, <HI>Falk.</HI> 412. So that if as <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> We claim the Laws of <HI>England</HI> as our Birth-right, we are mo&s;t certainly intitled to the Courts, in which the Laws may be admini&s;tred, which Courts are by, and part of the common Law; For where is the U&s;e or Force of Laws, unle&s;s they can be put in Execution? This can only be done by proper Offi|cers; and to &s;ay We have a Right to the Laws, and not to the Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice according to tho&s;e Laws, in &s;uch manner as we may reap the Fruit of them, what is this but a gro&s;s Ab&s;urdity? So that if the binding Force of the Laws of <HI>England</HI> here, is either from a right inherent in us as <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> or from that Nece&s;&s;ity which makes it &s;uppo&s;ed, that we received the Laws under which our Ance&s;tors lived before their Settlement here, and agreed to be governed by them for want of another Law; In ei|ther Ca&s;e, nothing more was wanting than Judges and other Officers to admini&s;ter the Laws as in our <HI>Mother Country,</HI> and give them their Force; and the Appointment of the Judges and Officers is Part of the King's Praerogative, or more properly of his Office, But the Juri&s;diction of the Court is from the Law; Judges have accordingly been ap|pointed, and their Commi&s;&s;ions have run for above the&s;e Thirty Years pa&s;t with only incon&s;iderable Alterations, as they do now.</P>
<P>AND I find upon peru&s;al of the Minutes of this Court, That &s;o long ago as the Year 1702. a <HI>Court of Exchequer</HI> was held before <HI>William Atwood</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> the then Chief Ju&s;tice, <HI>Abraham De Poy&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Robert Walter</HI> E&s;qrs; in which &s;ome Proceedings were had on the Plea &s;ide. I do not find any Proceedings in the Exchequer from that Time, (tho' po&s;|&s;ibly I may have overlooked &s;ome) till the Year 1729. When the Hon. <HI>Lewis Morris,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> my Predece&s;&s;or &s;at alone in Court, and it was upon the Motion of Mr. <HI>Alexan|der, viz.</HI></P>

<P>YOU &s;ee, Gentlemen, that by this Motion it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that this Court is ve&s;ted with the Powers of the Court of Exchequer, and &s;o allowed by the Chief Ju&s;tice, by granting the Motion, what the Powers of the Court of Exchequer are, wherein the Barons are Judges, I mentioned before, to wit, Cognizance of Pleas at the common Law, and a Power of determining Cau&s;es in a Cour&s;e of Equity by Engli&s;h Bill, and the Writ prayed for by this Motion, i&s;&s;ues out of the Chancery of the Exchequer. <Q>And the Writs u&s;ual in the Chancery in the Exchequer to &s;eize the Land in &s;uch Ca&s;es are more antient than the Regi&s;ter or the Treati&s;e of <HI>Praerogativa Regis.</HI></Q> I meet with no other Proceedings in the Exchequer until Mr. Pre&s;ident <HI>Van Dam</HI>'s Time, when a Bill was filed, which happened in this Manner. In the Winter 1731. during Mr. <HI>Van Dam</HI>'s Admini&s;tration there was held a Weekly meeting of the Judges in Town, &amp; &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Lawyers; at one of the&s;e Meetings it was propo&s;ed by one of them to bring the Equity Bu&s;ine&s;s into this Court, and a Que&s;tion ari&s;ing, whe|ther the Judges were &s;ufficiently impowered by their Commi&s;&s;ion to determine Cau&s;es brought by Engli&s;h Bill? My Commi&s;&s;ion and my Brother <HI>Philip&s;e</HI>'s were brought and con&s;idered, and it was agreed by Us all, <HI>to wit,</HI> Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Alexander, Hor&s;emanden, Murray, Chambers, Smith, Jame&s;on</HI> and <HI>Warrel,</HI> who were pre&s;ent at that Meeting, that the Judges were well impowered, and upon that they re&s;olved to bring the Bu&s;ine&s;s here according|ly; for the&s;e and other Rea&s;ons, becau&s;e the Bu&s;ine&s;s in Chancery mu&s;t be attended with intolerable Delays; The Governors who act as Chancellors being obliged to be &s;ometimes in <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> to meet the A&s;&s;embly of that Province, and &s;ometimes at <HI>Albany</HI> to meet the Indian Nations, be&s;ides that, few of them care to be troubled with that Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, this made Suits in Equity in that Court very tedious and expen&s;ive, and it was thought it could not be di&s;agreeable to the People in general, who mu&s;t believe their Properties well &s;ecured in the Hands of &s;worn Judges, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to &s;tudy the Laws, and who&s;e E&s;tates and Families are in this Country; It was &s;aid that that was the propere&s;t Time, when there was no Governor appointed that we knew of, who per|haps might think that the leaving his Court and bringing the Equity Bu&s;ine&s;s into this, was done out of Diffidence towards him, and none of the Lawyers would care to be the fir&s;t to expo&s;e him&s;elf to a Governor's Di&s;like; The&s;e were the Rea&s;ons among many others made u&s;e of at that Time, to alter the Current of the Practice in Equity, and turn it into the Channel it now runs in. And accordingly a Bill was filed in the Ex|chequer in <HI>March</HI> Term 1731. long before the Governor's Arrival here, directed to the Hon. <HI>Lewis Morris</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Chief Ju&s;tice, and the re&s;t of the Ju&s;tices, and on Mo|tion, Proce&s;s ordered by him in open Court.</P>
<P>I mention the&s;e things, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> to remove a mi&s;taken Notion mo&s;t People have taken up, I am told, as if this Court were erected by Ordinance in the pre&s;ent Governor's Time, in order to bring on a Suit, brought by the Attorney General in his Maje&s;ty's Be|half again&s;t Mr. <HI>Van Dam.</HI> I hope the People will in a little Time be undeceived, both as to this Court and the Men who have &s;ignalized them&s;elves in Oppo&s;ition to that which they once approved and promoted; looking a few Years back will open their Eyes, and &s;o defeat and fru&s;trate the Expectations of &s;uch as delight in Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Ordinance,</HI> it was chiefly intended to appoint the Times of the Sittings (for the Times of holding all our Courts have been always &s;ettled by Ordinances) that the Suits here might not prove &s;o tedious and expen&s;ive as they were found to be in Chan|cery, where, in a very memorable Ca&s;e, it was &s;aid, the Charges were run up to many hundred Pounds, though the Ca&s;e was determined upon Bill and An&s;wer.</P>
<P>As to the grand Objection that has been made, <HI>That the King cannot erect a Court of Equity, &s;o neither can he erect another Court of Kings Bench or Common Pleas in</HI> England. So that if the Objection hold good, in the &s;en&s;e &s;ome would under&s;tand it, We have no Supreme Court at all. The Con&s;equences of which are very Terrible, and obvious to every con&s;iderate Man.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="003696_0006_1002480FA28C44D0">Upon the whole, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> altho' &s;ome Men have been exceedingly free with my Character, I can ea&s;ily forgive them; I dare &s;ay, they have not that ill Opinion of me them&s;elves, which they would infu&s;e into others; but as I am in this Station now, and as long as I &s;hall have the Honour to continue in it, I will &s;upport and maintain the Dignity and Authority of this Court, till it be declared in a regular and legal Way by &s;ome higher Court, that we have not Juri&s;diction in Equity. I have often &s;ince I gave my Opinion touching the Juri&s;diction of this Court, con&s;idered the Rea&s;ons, Argu|ments and Authorities in Law made u&s;e of on both &s;ides, as I can &s;ee no rea&s;on to Retract my Opinion, on the contrary I am fully &s;atisfied in my Con&s;cience, that I am in the Right.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I have detained you a con&s;iderable Time; you are &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity there is of clearing up the&s;e Matters, which, I hope, I have done to your Satisfaction. Nothing remains but that in general you are charged to Pre&s;ent all &s;uch Offences as &s;hall come to your Knowledge, from <HI>Trea&s;ons</HI> down to <HI>Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.</HI> I know mo&s;t of you Per&s;onally, and I make no doubt but you will di&s;charge your Duty.</P>
