<P>THE following pieces were originally addre&s;&s;ed to the Editors of the Federal Gazette in Baltimore, and publi&s;hed in that paper. It being thought, by some persons whose opinion deserves respect, that a republication of them, in a form more connected, and more convenient for circulation and perusal, might be of use, they are now presented again to your con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Their author is a person re&s;iding among you, whose present lot in life, as well as his future hopes, is embarked in the same bottom with yours; and who, therefore, has a common intere&s;t with you, in the great subject to which he calls your attention. It is by no means nece&s;&s;ary that you &s;hould know his name. It is not by the authority of names, but by truth, that the determinati|ons of freemen ought to be guided. If opinions be founded in reason, and &s;tatements supported by fact, it is of no importance by whom they are advanced.</P>
<P>In attempting, however, to impress on your minds the nece&s;&s;ity of adopting the legi&s;lative choice of electors, at this time, he thinks it important to declare to you, that he is decidedly in favor of di&s;trict elections, whenever they can be permanently and univer|sally e&s;tabli&s;hed. This can be done only by an amendment of the con&s;titution. Such an amendment, he knows it to be the intention of a federal member of congress, with whom he is well acquaint|ed, to propose at the next se&s;&s;ion of that body. It may also be proposed by the legi&s;lature of Maryland. By in&s;tructing your members in the ensuing a&s;&s;embly to propose it, you may greatly promote its adoption by the other &s;tates. Should it be adopted, of

which I think there is little doubt, all the &s;tates will &s;tand on equal ground, in the future elections of a chief magi&s;trate for the nation. The people, in di&s;tricts, will every where choose the electors. The mode cannot be altered by one &s;tate, as Virginia has lately done, in order to favor unduly the success of a parti|cular candidate. And the chief magi&s;trate of the nation will be the fair choice of a majority of the nation.</P>
<P>This will be the effect of e&s;tabli&s;hing, universally and perma|nently, the choice of electors by the people in di&s;tricts; and this is the wi&s;h of the federal party. They will exert themselves to ob|tain it. But till it is obtained, while the friends of Mr. Jeffer|son in one &s;tate aboli&s;h di&s;trict elections to favor him, I tru&s;t that you will be convinced, by a candid perusal of the following pa|pers, that it is both ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary for the friends of Mr. Adams, in this &s;tate, to employ the same weapon in defending themselves, and in preventing the rights of the majority from be|ing usurped by the minority.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Me&s;&s;rs. YUNDT and BROWN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE alarm which the anti-federali&s;ts feel, at the idea of changing the mode of election in this &s;tate, &s;o as to counteract the policy of their party in Virginia, is perfectly natural and well founded&mdash;And their conduct, in attempting to rai&s;e a clamor again&s;t the mea&s;ure, is altogether con&s;i&s;tent with the principles whereby their party has, at all times, been actuated. To change the mode of election in Virginia, &s;o as to deprive the federali&s;ts in that &s;tate of all &s;hare in the choice of electors, was, as they well knew, the only &s;tep which could give their party a chance of &s;ucce&s;s. There|fore they took it; and it was applauded by the party through|out the union, as a ma&s;ter-&s;troke of policy. Blind and fooli&s;h as they are, they did not recollect, or did not fore&s;ee, that the blow was capable of being retorted on their own heads.</P>
<P>Finding now that this retort is likely to be made, they wake from their &s;hort dream of &s;ucce&s;s, and cry out again&s;t the mea&s;ure, as in the highe&s;t degree unju&s;t. They now af|fect a wonderful &s;olicitude about the "rights of the people," which they &s;ay would be invaded and even de&s;troyed, by the mea&s;ure of choo&s;ing electors by the legi&s;lature. Having fir&s;t taken the &s;tep them&s;elves, for their own benefit, they are now wonderfully alarmed le&s;t the federal party &s;hould take it al&s;o, and thus re&s;tore the balance of fair choice.</P>
<P>But they do not recollect, that the rights of the people are as effectually pre&s;erved by a choice by the legi&s;lature, as in any other mode. The con&s;titution is the work of the peo|ple; the expre&s;&s;ion of their will, and the fence placed by them&s;elves round their rights. Nothing, therefore, which is expre&s;sly authori&s;ed by the con&s;titution, can be contrary to the rights of the people. Whatever is done pur&s;uant to the con&s;titution, is their own act, flowing from their own authority, and therefore not only con&s;i&s;tent with their rights, but even an exerci&s;e of tho&s;e rights.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="037074_0006_100C46ABAA51F430">But the con&s;titution provides, that the electors &s;hall be appointed in &s;uch mode as the legi&s;lature of each &s;tate &s;hall direct.&mdash;Con&s;equently, any manner of choo&s;ing which the legi&s;lature &s;hall direct, is conformable, and not contrary, to the rights of the people.</P>
<P>Virginia, they tell us, did not re&s;ort to a choice by the legi&s;lature, but only to a general ticket, which is &s;till a choice by the people, and therefore fair and proper. Shal|low pretext! Does not a general ticket in Virginia produce preci&s;ely the &s;ame effect, that a choice by the legi&s;lature would have produced? Does it not as effectually deprive the federali&s;ts, who are the minority in the &s;tate as well as in the legi&s;lature, of the &s;ix votes which they would have gained by the di&s;trict election? Every man mu&s;t &s;ee that it does, and that, therefore, there is no &s;ort of difference between the two modes, except that the choice by the legi&s;lature is attended with the lea&s;t trouble, tumult and inconvenience, and for that rea&s;on preferable to the other. The re&s;ult is preci&s;ely the &s;ame; but by the choice by the legi&s;lature, it is produced with le&s;s inconvenience than by a general ticket.</P>
<P>Virginia, they further tell us, was not the fir&s;t to take this &s;tep. She was forced into it, in &s;elf-defence, and in order to counteract the policy of other &s;tates. But this is a mi&s;take in point of fact. Virginia &s;et the example of choo&s;ing the mode, with a view to a <HI>particular election,</HI> and to this particular election.&mdash;Penn&s;ylvania had no e&s;tab|li&s;hed mode&mdash;&s;he had cho&s;en in different ways at differ|ent elections. The law under which the la&s;t choice was made, was a temporary law, and had expired when the legi&s;lature of that &s;tate la&s;t met. The federal party con|tended for a di&s;trict election; that mode of which the anti-federali&s;ts of this &s;tate are &s;o greatly enamored. The anti-federali&s;ts in that &s;tate, acting in perfect concert with tho&s;e of Virginia, oppo&s;ed this faire&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible modes of election, and oppo&s;ed it with &s;uch violence and ob&s;tinacy, that they prevented any law from pa&s;&s;ing, and &s;eem fully re|&s;olved rather to leave their &s;tate without a vote, than to yield to di&s;trict elections. So much for the attachment of the anti-federali&s;ts in Penn&s;ylvania to this faire&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible modes, with which the &s;ame party here are &s;o much in love.</P>
<P>Why are they in love with it here? Becau&s;e they expect
<PB N="7" REF="037074_0007_100C46AD3013D898">
to gain &s;ome votes to their party by it. Why are they op|po&s;ed to it in Penn&s;ylvania and Virginia? Becau&s;e they ex|pect their party to lo&s;e &s;ome votes by it there. The end therefore is the &s;ame, namely, to en&s;ure the &s;ucce&s;s of their party, although the means are different: and their great &s;olicitude for the "rights of the people" turns out, in this ca&s;e as in &s;o many others, to be nothing more than a de&s;ire to promote their own views. Tho&s;e rights are &s;acri|ficed without the lea&s;t he&s;itation, whenever the &s;acrifice can promote a party purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In all the other &s;tates, except Penn&s;ylvania, the mode of election was fixt, and the federali&s;ts were well content to let it remain &s;o. They were content that this election &s;hould be made, according to the &s;ame principles that governed the former. But the anti-federali&s;ts &s;et the example of change, where it &s;uited their purpo&s;e to make it. Having done &s;o, they &s;tickle violently to pre&s;erve the old mode, where that happens to &s;uit them be&s;t.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid by their advocates, that they attempted to change the mode in New-York, and to introduce a di&s;trict election, in&s;tead of a choice by the legi&s;lature. This example is un|fortunate. The anti-federali&s;ts them&s;elves introduced the choice by the legi&s;lature in New-York, in &s;pite of the efforts of the federali&s;ts; and their object was to promote the elec|tion of general Clinton, as vice-pre&s;ident, in oppo&s;ition to Mr. Adams. When they found that this work of their own hands was likely to operate again&s;t them&s;elves, they wi&s;hed to change it, and to re&s;ort again to di&s;trict elections.</P>
<P>We are told that the legi&s;lature of Maryland, at its la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, had the general ticket &s;cheme of Virginia before its eyes, and yet took no &s;tep to counteract it; and this is u&s;ed as an argument again&s;t calling the legi&s;lature. But here a|gain the&s;e ignorant per&s;ons mi&s;take or mi&s;tate the fact. The legi&s;lature of this &s;tate never had the Virginia general ticket &s;cheme before its eyes: It had adjourned long before that &s;cheme was adopted in Virginia, and even before the inten|tion to adopt it was publicly avowed. The law for carrying it into effect, was one of the la&s;t acts of the &s;e&s;&s;ion. It was not introduced till a day or two before the adjournment, and then was hurried through with indecent ha&s;te. We all know the feint that was practi&s;ed, mo&s;t probably with a view
<PB N="8" REF="037074_0008_100C46AF76B280A0">
to deceive the legi&s;lature of Maryland, on the &s;ubject of this law. It was talked of; the pul&s;e of the legi&s;lature was felt; the &s;cheme was well matured and completed. Now in order to gain time, and to deceive the oppo&s;ite party, by which means &s;ome of them might be prevailed on to go home, its authors gave out that it was abandoned. One of their chiefs, colonel Taylor, carried his duplicity &s;o far as actually to go home, giving out that he was gone for the &s;e&s;&s;ion. The &s;cheme being ripe for execution, he &s;uddenly returned, the bill was introduced, and pu&s;hed through the two hou&s;es with unprecedented celerity; and then the legi&s;lature adjourned. All this was &s;ome time after the legi&s;lature of this &s;tate had adjourned. Con&s;equently, that body never had the mea&s;ure under its eye, and nothing can be inferred from its omitting to take any countervailing &s;tep.</P>
<P>The truth of the whole matter is, and it need not be con|cealed, that while the mode of choo&s;ing electors remains on its pre&s;ent footing, variable according to the will of the &s;tate legi&s;latures, variations will be made, in &s;ome &s;tates, to &s;erve the canditate who may happen to be the favorite there. This has been done in Virginia. The anti-federali&s;ts began the game. Other &s;tates mu&s;t play it again&s;t them, in order to prevent the election from becoming perfectly unfair; from being controled by the minority. Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts has &s;et the example of this retort; and the anti-federali&s;ts, awaking from their golden dream of power and office, begin to quake and cry out. Maryland, I have no doubt, will follow up the blow; in which ca&s;e their defeat is certain. This they well know; and hence their new found &s;olicitude for the "rights of the people," which they utterly di&s;regard, for di&s;trict elections, which they fir&s;t &s;et a&s;ide.</P>
<P>Let an uniform and fixt mode of choo&s;ing electors be pro|po&s;ed, and the federali&s;ts will agree to it. They will even propo&s;e one them&s;elves, at the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of congre&s;s. All then will &s;tand on the &s;ame ground; and the mode of choice cannot be changed to &s;uit party purpo&s;es of the moment. But while this mode remains changeable, if one party be allowed to change it where it &s;uits them, and to prevent change where the other party might gain by it, the election becomes manife&s;tly unfair, in its general re&s;ult, which is the only proper method of con&s;idering it; and the ca&s;e put by
<PB N="9" REF="037074_0009_100C46B229AC9C10">
the "Marylander," at which your corre&s;pondent the "Voter," is &s;o much di&s;plea&s;ed, the ca&s;e of a man attacked with a bludgeon and defending him&s;elf with his fi&s;t, manife&s;t|ly occurs.</P>
<P>Le&s;t it &s;hould be pretended that &s;uch a &s;tep on the part of Maryland, as is in que&s;tion, would render the general re&s;ult of the election unfair, I pledge my&s;elf to &s;hew, on a future occa&s;ion, and to &s;hew from a fair and accurate &s;urvey of the continent, that if di&s;trict elections were every where e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, the re&s;ult would be &s;till more favorable to the federal party, who have a large majority in the nation at large, than it can be, &s;uppo&s;ing Maryland to follow the example of re|tort &s;et by Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and to adopt the mode of choice by the legi&s;lature.

<P>ON a former occa&s;ion I pledged my&s;elf to prove, by a fair &s;urvey of the continent, and a &s;tatement of the &s;trength of parties in each &s;tate, that if di&s;trict elections for pre&s;i|dent and vice-pre&s;ident were univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed, which ought to be, and I tru&s;t will be, done by an amendment of the con&s;titution, Mr. Jeffer&s;on could have no chance of be|ing elected; but on the contrary, that the re&s;ult, in that ca&s;e, would be far le&s;s favorable to his party, than even in ca&s;e Maryland, to counteract the mea&s;ures of his &s;upport|ers, &s;hould adopt, for this time, the plan of choo&s;ing by the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>Col. Mercer indeed a&s;&s;erted, in a late public &s;peech, that the democrats would come in, meaning that Mr. Jeffer&s;on would be elected, unle&s;s nineteen twentieths of the freemen of America &s;hould be prevented from expre&s;&s;ing their &s;en&s;e in the election: but this a&s;&s;ertion, like &s;o many others of the &s;ame gentleman, &s;erved only to &s;how that he was utter|ly ignorant, or utterly regardle&s;s, of the facts. Let us &s;ee who the&s;e nineteen twentieths of the freemen of America are.

federal party have always, till the pre&s;ent legi&s;la|ture, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a clear and even a large majority in both branches. Even now they have a majority in the whole legi&s;lature; their majority in the &s;enate being &s;even, and that of the anti-federali&s;ts in the other hou&s;e, only two. But if we take the votes on the election for governor, as a fair criterion of the &s;trength of parties, we &s;hall find that the anti-federali&s;ts are in the proportion of eight to &s;even. Mr. M'Kean had, I think, 38,000 votes, and Mr. Ro&s;s 33,000. The difference, I perfectly recollect, was about 5000, not more, and the whole number about 70,000. It mu&s;t be recollected, moreover, that the majority of Mr. M'Kean was given by the two in&s;urgent counties of Berks and Northampton, which were almo&s;t unanimous in his favor; and that in the re&s;t of the &s;tate Mr. Ro&s;s had a clear majori|ty. It is al&s;o to be remembered, that a majority of the counties was in favor of Ro&s;s; and that a va&s;t number of the votes for M'Kean, were obtained by the impo&s;itions practi&s;ed on the Germans, relative to the hou&s;e tax; which have &s;ince been detected and done away by the actual a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment.

It need not, however, be remarked, that this mi&s;take makes no difference in the calculation.</NOTE> counties on the ea&s;tern &s;hore: And even in tho&s;e they are by no means &s;afe. They have hopes of two other di&s;tricts. The cities of Balti|more and Annapolis, with the county of Anne-Arundel, compo&s;e one; the counties of Wa&s;hing|ton and Allegany the other. In the fir&s;t of the&s;e they even affect to be confident; but their &s;ecret convictions are far different. They know that in the election between general Smith and Mr. Win|che&s;ter, they had a majority in Baltimore town of on|ly 300, and that many who &s;upported gen. Smith, are now decidedly for the federal elector. They al&s;o know that in the election between Mr. Thomas and Mr. Sprigg, there was in the city of Annapolis and Anne Arundel county, a much greater majority for the federal candidate; and that, con&s;equently, &s;hould things remain as they were, the latter majority mu&s;t overpower the former, and the federal elector be car|ried. They therefore found their hopes, entirely, on the vain expectation of a change in their favor in the public &s;entiment; of which there is not the lea&s;t pro&s;|pect or appearance. As to Allegany and Wa&s;hington, it is le&s;s certain. The former county is known to be nearly unanimous for the federal candidate, while the latter, which is much larger, and the &s;trong ground of the anti-federali&s;ts, is much divided. From this &s;tate of things nothing certain can be concluded. At the la&s;t election, Mr. Lynn, of Allegany, who had but little &s;trength in Wa&s;hington, was the federal candidate. The election was extremely clo&s;e, but he &s;ucceeded. In the pre&s;ent, Mr. Williams, of Wa&s;hington, who is very &s;trong in that county, and will be as &s;trongly &s;upported in Allegany, which is a mo&s;t federal county, as Mr. Lynn him&s;elf, is the candidate; from which arrangement a much more
<PB N="13" REF="037074_0013_100C46BAC89115B0">
favorable re&s;ult than that of the la&s;t election, may be expected. Upon the whole we may conclude, that the anti-federali&s;ts have &s;ome chance, though but a &s;mall one, in the&s;e two di&s;tricts; and that in the other two the probability is &s;trongly in their fa|vor. This will warrant the further conclu&s;ion, that no probable ground exi&s;ts for the expectation, on their part, of more than three; and nothing like certainty of more than two.

<P>Thus it appears that were di&s;trict elections univer&s;ally e&s;|tabli&s;hed, the anti-federali&s;ts, on the mo&s;t liberal allowance, could get but &s;ixty-three votes in all the &s;tates, out of one hundred and thirty-eight, of which it requires &s;eventy to make a majority. That is, that if the &s;en&s;e of the nation could be expre&s;&s;ed, by the faire&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible modes, a ge|neral election by the people in di&s;tricts, there would be a large majority of the nation again&s;t that candidate, whom his friends are now attempting to &s;muggle in, by changing the mode of election from di&s;tricts to a general ticket, where it &s;uits their views, and clamoring, at the &s;ame time, for di&s;trict elections, where they hope to get &s;omething by them.</P>
<P>In Virginia they began the game. They took away the fair mode of di&s;trict elections, and &s;ub&s;tituted a general tick|et, whereby the voice of &s;ix federal di&s;tricts was &s;ilenced in the election of pre&s;ident. In Penn&s;ylvania they contended to the la&s;t for a general ticket, and refu&s;ed to the federali&s;ts a di&s;trict election, on the faire&s;t divi&s;ion of the &s;tate, which was repeatedly offered to them. A per&s;on, indeed, under the &s;ignature of "A Penn&s;ylvanian," who is &s;aid to be Mr. Dallas, has had the unaccountable effrontery to a&s;&s;ert, in a paper of this city, that the anti-federali&s;ts in the Penn&s;ylva|nia legi&s;lature, did not object to the principle of a di&s;trict election, but to the mode of dividing the &s;tate; an a&s;&s;erti|tion which that per&s;on him&s;elf, and every man in Penn&s;yl|vania, knows to be fal&s;e. In Maryland, on the contrary, the&s;e &s;ame friends to Mr. Jeffer&s;on, hypocritically affect the mo&s;t violent attachment to di&s;trict elections, rai&s;e a loud clamor about the rights of the people, and contend, tooth and nail, for that very mode which their coadjutors have abo|li&s;hed in Virginia, and prevented in Penn&s;ylvania; hoping by the&s;e means to cheat the federal party, who con&s;titute the majority in Maryland, as well as in the nation at large,
<PB N="15" REF="037074_0015_100C46BF21D7CD98">
out of their choice, out of their right, as a majority, to have a pre&s;ident of their choice, and to impo&s;e on the nati|on a chief magi&s;trate to whom the majority is unque&s;tionably oppo&s;ed. In a &s;ub&s;equent number, I will examine, more at length, this pretence about the rights of the people, whereby they are attempted to be cheated, in fact, out of their rights; and the foundations of this clamor, by which the good &s;en&s;e of the majority is attempted to be impo&s;ed on, and a pre&s;ident to be cho&s;en by a factious minority. In the meantime, I will a&s;k the federali&s;ts in Maryland, who con&s;titute the majority by the confe&s;&s;ion even of their oppo|nents, what is the right which they hold mo&s;t dear? Is it not to have a pre&s;ident of their own choice? If &s;o, will they &s;uffer them&s;elves to be defrauded of this dear and &s;ub|&s;tantial right, by a few cant phra&s;es; by the artifices of the enemies of government in other &s;tates, aided by their noi&s;y clamors in this?

<HEAD>No. III.</HEAD>
<P>IT has formerly been &s;hewn, by a fair &s;urvey of the continent, and a reference to public and undeniable facts,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the preceding number, and the calculations and state|ments there made, which have not been denied or disputed.</NOTE> that were di&s;trict elections e&s;tabli&s;hed in Virginia, Penn|&s;ylvania, New-York, and throughout the union, Mr. Jef|fer&s;on could not po&s;&s;ibly get more than &s;ixty-three votes, out of one hundred and thirty-eight; which is the whole number of votes for pre&s;ident and vice-pre&s;ident. This number is &s;even &s;hort of a majority. The majority of the nation is therefore oppo&s;ed to Mr. Jeffer&s;on, and in favor of Mr. Adams, general Pinckney, or &s;ome other federal candidate.</P>
<P>The anti-federali&s;ts of Virginia, who are a majority in that &s;tate, knowing this to be the true &s;tate of the matter, aboli&s;hed the di&s;trict election in their &s;tate; where Mr. Adams and general Pinckney would, upon that plan, have
<PB N="16" REF="037074_0016_100C46C2DCCBF2C0">
got &s;ix votes at lea&s;t. By this &s;tep they took &s;ix votes from tho&s;e candidates, and gave them to Mr. Jeffer&s;on. Situated as the election actually is in the other &s;tates, the&s;e &s;ix votes, taken from Mr. Jeffer&s;on's opponents by depriving them of di&s;trict elections, and added to him, will &s;ecure him the election, though the majority of the nation is again&s;t him; unle&s;s Maryland, where the federali&s;ts are a decided majority, &s;hould take the &s;ame &s;tep in her own defence. Unle&s;s by &s;etting a&s;ide di&s;trict elections, for the pre&s;ent, Maryland &s;hould deprive the anti-federali&s;ts of their influence in this &s;tate, as the federali&s;ts of Virginia have been deprived of their influence in Virginia, and &s;hould re&s;tore the election to its fair balance, the pre&s;ident of the United States will be cho&s;en by the minority of the nation. This it is the de|termination of the federali&s;ts of Maryland, that is of the majority, to do; not by &s;tealth and underhandedly, but openly, upon fair and avowed principles, and with the concurrence of a majority of the people.</P>
<P>The anti-federali&s;ts, alarmed at the idea of &s;eeing their unju&s;t advantage thus &s;natched out of their hands, and the election of pre&s;ident placed again under the controul of the majority, make a terrible outcry again&s;t this plan. They become, all at once, the zealous defenders of di&s;trict elec|tions; which they have &s;o lately trampled under foot on the other &s;ide of the Potowmac, and do now ob&s;tinately oppo&s;e in Penn&s;ylvania. They &s;ay that the right to di&s;trict electi|ons, which they them&s;elves have aboli&s;hed in Virginia in order to promote the election of Mr. Jeffer&s;on, and do now re&s;i&s;t in Penn&s;ylvania for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, is a mo&s;t &s;acred right; and that an attempt to change them, even for this time alone and in order to counteract the plans of the &s;ame party in Virginia, ought to be treated by the people of Maryland, as an inva&s;ion of their deare&s;t con&s;titutional privileges.</P>
<P>The foundations of this clamor I now intend to examine. I intend to enquire into the nature and extent of this con|&s;titutional right. I intend to &s;hew that the &s;ub&s;tantial con|&s;titutional right of the people of Maryland, which is a right to have a pre&s;ident whom they approve, is in fact in|vaded by tho&s;e who make this clamor; and can be pro|tected and &s;ecured by no other means, than a change in
<PB N="17" REF="037074_0017_100C46C5184A8950">
the mode of choo&s;ing electors. I intend to &s;hew that &s;hould the electors be appointed by the legi&s;lature, they will be, to all intents and purpo&s;es, cho&s;en by the people of the &s;tate at large.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>PART FIRST.</HI> Of the Con&s;titutional Rights of the People, relative to the Election of Pre&s;ident.</HEAD>
<P>Let us in the fir&s;t place a&s;k what is the con&s;titutional right of the people, relative to the choice of pre&s;ident? I an&s;wer, their con&s;titutional right is, to have the pre&s;ident cho&s;en by electors appointed in each &s;tate, "in &s;uch manner as the legi&s;lature thereof &s;hall direct." Hear the con&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P>"The executive power &s;hall be ve&s;ted in a pre&s;ident of the United States of America. He &s;hall hold his office dur|ing the term of four years; and, together with the vice-pre&s;ident, cho&s;en for the &s;ame term, be elected as follows:</P>
<P>"Each <HI>&s;tate</HI> &s;hall appoint, <HI>in such manner as the legi&s;la|ture thereof may direct,</HI> a number of electors equal to the whole number of &s;enators and repre&s;entatives to which the &s;tate may be entitled in the congre&s;s, &amp;c.</P>
<P>"The electors &s;hall meet in their re&s;pective &s;tates, and vote by ballot for two per&s;ons," &amp;c.</P>
<P>This is every word contained in the con&s;titution, on the &s;ubject of appointing electors. Each <HI>&s;tate,</HI> we &s;ee, not the people of each &s;tate, but each <HI>&s;tate</HI> in its united political capacity as a &s;tate, is to appoint a certain number of elec|tors. And how are they to be appointed? By di&s;tricts? By a general ticket? By the legi&s;lature? No! But in &s;uch manner <HI>as the legi&s;lature of the &s;tate &s;hall direct.</HI> So &s;ays the con&s;titution. Such are its plain and expre&s;s words. The legi&s;lature of each &s;tate, therefore, has a con&s;titutional right, to direct the mode of appointing electors, and to direct it in whatever manner it &s;hall think fit.</P>
<P>But no, &s;ay the anti-federali&s;ts, tho&s;e &s;kilful expounders of the con&s;titution. When the con&s;titution &s;ays that "each <HI>&s;tate</HI> &s;hall appoint electors, it does not mean each &s;tate in its political capacity as a &s;tate&mdash;but the people of each &s;tate, as individuals." Let us try this explanation by the con&s;ti|tution
<PB N="18" REF="037074_0018_100C46C75F810C58">
it&s;elf, and by the con&s;truction which it has received from the people of the &s;everal &s;tates.</P>
<P>When the con&s;titution means that the <HI>people</HI> of the &s;tates &s;hall act, it uniformly mentions the people. When it means to &s;peak of the &s;tates in their political capacities, it always u&s;es the word <HI>"&s;tates"</HI> alone.</P>
<P>Thus, in the 10th &s;ection of the 1&s;t article: "<HI>No &s;tate</HI> &s;hall enter into any treaty of alliance," &amp;c. <HI>No &s;tate</HI> &s;hall, without the con&s;ent of congre&s;s, lay impo&s;ts, &amp;c. <HI>No &s;tate</HI> &s;hall, without the con&s;ent of congre&s;s, lay any duty of tou|nage," &amp;c.</P>
<P>So in the 2d &s;ection of the 3d article: "The judicial power &s;hall extend to controver&s;ies between two or more <HI>&s;tates,</HI> between a &s;tate and citizens of another <HI>&s;tate</HI>&mdash;and be|tween a <HI>&s;tate,</HI> or the citizens thereof, and foreign &s;tates, citi|zens or &s;ubjects."</P>
<P>"In all ca&s;es affecting amba&s;&s;adors, other public mini&s;ters, and con&s;uls, and tho&s;e in which a <HI>&s;tate</HI> &s;hall be party, the &s;upreme court &s;hall have original juri&s;diction."</P>
<P>So in &s;ection 3d of the 4th article: "New <HI>&s;tates</HI> may be admitted by congre&s;s into this union; but no new <HI>&s;tate</HI> &s;hall be formed or erected within the juri&s;diction of any other <HI>&s;tate,</HI> nor any &s;tate be formed by the junction of two or more <HI>&s;tates,</HI> or parts of <HI>&s;tates,</HI> without the con&s;ent of the legi&s;latures of the &s;tates concerned," &amp;c.</P>
<P>So in &s;ection 4th, &s;ame article: "The United States &s;hall guarantee to every <HI>&s;tate</HI> in this union a republican form of government," &amp;c. And in &s;ection 5th, "No <HI>&s;tate,</HI> without its con&s;ent, &s;hall be deprived of its equal &s;uffrage in the &s;enate."</P>
<P>So in the 9th &s;ection of the 1&s;t article: "The migration or importation of &s;uch per&s;ons as any of the <HI>&s;tates</HI> now ex|i&s;ting &s;hall think proper to admit, &s;hall not be prohibited," &amp;c.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e in&s;tances, it is perfectly clear, that the word <HI>&s;tate</HI> is u&s;ed to &s;ignify, not the <HI>people</HI> of the &s;tate, but the &s;tate it&s;elf, in its collective capacity, as a community and body politic. When the con&s;titution, therefore, u&s;ing the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ion, &s;ays, that "<HI>each &s;tate</HI> &s;hall appoint electors, in &s;uch manner as the legi&s;lature thereof &s;hall direct," does it not evidently intend to convey the &s;ame meaning,
<PB N="19" REF="037074_0019_100C325AED0ECE28">
and to &s;peak of the &s;tate in its political capacity? Does it, contrary to its con&s;tant tenor and meaning in every other part, intend to &s;ay that the <HI>people</HI> of each &s;tate, individually, &s;hall appoint electors? When it means to introduce the <HI>people</HI> in their individual capacity, what is its language? Let it &s;peak for it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Section 2. article 1. "The hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives &s;hall be compo&s;ed of members cho&s;en every &s;econd year, by the <HI>people of the several &s;tates.</HI>" Is this the &s;ame language? Does it convey the &s;ame meaning? If the con&s;titution had meant that the electors, as well as the repre&s;entatives, &s;hould be cho&s;en by the <HI>people</HI> of the &s;everal &s;tates, would it not have &s;aid &s;o, in expre&s;s terms, in one ca&s;e, as well as in the other? Certainly it would.</P>
<P>We are therefore warranted to conclude, that as the con|&s;titution has provided, not that the <HI>people</HI> of the &s;everal &s;tates &s;hould choo&s;e electors, but that each <HI>&s;tate</HI> &s;hould choo&s;e them, it meant, in this in&s;tance, as in every other where the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ion is u&s;ed, to &s;peak of the &s;tate in its collective political capacity, and to provide that there &s;hould be a certain number of electors for each &s;tate, and that the legi&s;lature thereof &s;hould direct, in whatever man|ner it might think fit, the mode of making the appoint|ment.</P>
<P>"Each <HI>&s;tate</HI> &s;hall appoint, in &s;uch manner as the legi&s;la|ture thereof may direct, a number of electors equal," &amp;c. Is not this, when compared with the con&s;titution it&s;elf, and the language u&s;ed by it in every other part, &s;o plain that he who runs may read?</P>
<P>What has been the con&s;truction put on it by the &s;tates? Surely their opinions, not warped by particular objects and the purpo&s;es of the moment, but deliberately and uniformly expre&s;&s;ed, will be allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome weight in a que|&s;tion like this.</P>
<P>There have already been three elections of pre&s;ident. In all of them, South-Carolina has cho&s;en the electors by the legi&s;lature. Tenne&s;&s;ee having been but lately erected into a &s;tate, has cho&s;en but once, and then it was by the legi&s;lature. In all three, Jer&s;ey and Delaware have cho&s;en by the le|gi&s;lature. In the two la&s;t, certainly, and I believe in all three, New-York has cho&s;en by the legi&s;lature. Every
<PB N="20" REF="037074_0020_100C46CB35E20D58">
choice that Rhode-I&s;land has made, if I recollect aright, has been by the legi&s;lature. At the la&s;t election, and I think at &s;ome of the former, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts cho&s;e part of her electors by the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee, that out of &s;ixteen &s;tates, &s;even, not under the influence of any particular project, not with a view to any party election, but freely and impartially, have adopted the mode of appointing electors by the legi&s;lature; thereby declaring, in the mo&s;t authoritative manner, their opinion about the true meaning of the con&s;titution. This declara|tion the people of tho&s;e &s;tates have approved; for otherwi&s;e, they would have expre&s;&s;ed their di&s;content; and by electing different per&s;ons into the legi&s;lature, would have cau&s;ed the adoption of a different mode.</P>
<P>Two other &s;tates, New-Hamp&s;hire and Vermont, are &s;aid, and I believe truly, to have lately adopted the &s;ame mode; not in order to &s;ecure all the votes to the federal intere&s;t, for of that they were &s;ure, by the e&s;tabli&s;hed mode of a ge|neral ticket; but for the purpo&s;e of preventing votes from being thrown away from either of the federal candidates. Thus nine &s;tates have concurred in this con&s;truction of the con&s;titution; which indeed, as we have &s;een, is &s;o plain from the face of the in&s;trument it&s;elf, that one is at a lo&s;s to conceive, how it could ever have been called into que&s;tion.</P>

<HEAD><HI>PART SECOND.</HI> That the sub&s;tantial con&s;titutional Right of the People of Mary|land, the Right to have a Pre&s;ident chosen by the Majority, is in+vaded by di&s;trict Elections; and can be re&s;tored only by a Legis|lative choice of Electors.</HEAD>
<P>I mo&s;t readily admit that the people have a right, a mo&s;t undoubted right, under the con&s;titution, not indeed to vote immediately in the choice of electors, but to influ|ence &s;ub&s;tantially, and direct, not only that choice, but the choice of pre&s;ident al&s;o. The pre&s;ident is the elective chief magi&s;trate of the nation. He ought to be cho&s;en by the majority of the nation. The &s;en&s;e of that majority ought to be fairly expre&s;&s;ed. This is the real &s;ub&s;tantial right of the people. To have a chief magi&s;trate who is the choice of the majority; not to choo&s;e electors in this,
<PB N="21" REF="037074_0021_100C46CE2717FAF8">
that or the other manner, or to vote for this, that or the other man as an elector. The latter is the &s;hadow; about which none but children or blockheads can be &s;olicitous, nor any but de&s;igning party-men would make a fu&s;s. The former, to have a pre&s;ident of their choice, is the &s;ub&s;tance; and whatever tends to &s;ecure that &s;ub&s;tance, to promote that choice, promotes, in&s;tead of &s;ubverting, the "rights of the people."</P>
<P>People of Maryland, who is your choice as pre&s;ident? Whom do you wi&s;h to have as chief magi&s;trate? You an|&s;wer, at lea&s;t a large majority of you, who mu&s;t &s;peak for the whole, an&s;wer, Mr. Adams or general Pinckney.&mdash; Whom do you wi&s;h to prevent from being elected pre&s;ident? The &s;ame majority an&s;wers, Mr. Jeffer&s;on. Who are they then, who wi&s;h to take from you your rights? Tho&s;e who have de&s;troyed di&s;trict elections on the other &s;ide of the Potomak, in order to &s;ecure the election of Mr. Jeffer|&s;on, while they loudly clamor for them here for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; or tho&s;e who wi&s;h, by introducing the choice by the legi&s;lature, to replace the election in the hands of the majority, and continue Mr. Adams, the man of your choice, in the pre&s;idential chair? Turn then, with ju&s;t di&s;dain from the noi&s;y, deceitful, de&s;igning demagogue, who proves that he holds your rights and your under&s;tandings in equal contempt, by endeavoring to impo&s;e on the one, in order to beguile you of the other; by endeavoring to pay you for &s;ub|&s;tance with words; to per&s;uade you that in order to pre&s;erve the right of voting in a particular mode, you mu&s;t &s;ubmit to have tho&s;e votes rendered ab&s;olutely ineffectual, and a chief magi&s;trate impo&s;ed on you, who are the majority, by the tricks and clamors of a profligate minority.</P>
<P>Is there any man in any di&s;trict or county of Maryland, who wi&s;hes for the election of Mr. Adams, who prefers him to Mr. Jeffer&s;on, and yet does not &s;ee that his rights, which are to have a chief magi&s;trate of his own choice, are &s;ub&s;tantially promoted and &s;ecured by whatever con&s;tituti|onal mea&s;ure tends to &s;ecure the man of his choice? Is there any Marylander, who prefers Mr. Adams to Mr. Jeffer|&s;on, and is yet &s;o fooli&s;hly attached to voting at a particular election, as to &s;acrifice the former object in order to retain the latter? Is there any &s;uch Marylander, who can be per|&s;uaded
<PB N="22" REF="037074_0022_100C325E04454EB8">
by the advocates of Mr. Jeffer&s;on, to &s;ell his birth|right for a me&s;s of pottage? Why does he wi&s;h to vote? Is it that he may go to the polls, and pronounce the name of Jeremiah Townley Cha&s;e, of Philip Thomas, or of any other per&s;on; or that he may promote the election of Mr. Adams as pre&s;ident, in preference to that of Mr. Jeffer&s;on? If the latter be his object, &s;urely the mo&s;t effectual &s;teps for attaining it, mu&s;t be the mo&s;t conformable to his wi&s;hes, and to his rights.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident is the elective chief magi&s;trate of the na|tion, and ought, therefore, to be the fair choice of a majo|rity of the nation. Di&s;trict elections, I know, are, in them&s;elves, the faire&s;t mode of expre&s;&s;ing that choice; but in order to be fair, they mu&s;t be general and permanent. If one &s;tate can change from a di&s;trict election to a gene|ral ticket, or a legi&s;lative choice, and not another, the election becomes unfair, and the minority may choo&s;e in&s;tead of the majority. Of this any one may be convinced, by a very &s;imple illu&s;tration.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e three neighboring &s;tates, like Delaware, Mary|land and Virginia, to form a &s;eparate union, to have three votes each for pre&s;ident, and to elect by di&s;tricts. There will be nine votes in all, and five will be a majority. Sup|po&s;e that in Virginia two are for Mr. Jeffer&s;on and one for Mr. Adams, and in Maryland two for Mr. Adams and one for Mr. Jeffer&s;on, and in Delaware two for Mr. A|dams and one for Mr. Jeffer&s;on. Or in figures thus:

<P>There will then, in the three &s;tates, be five votes, by di&s;trict election, for Mr. Adams, and only four for Mr. Jeffer&s;on. Mr. Adams, therefore, will be the choice of the majority, by the faire&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible modes, the di&s;trict election. Ought he not to be pre&s;ident? Every body mu&s;t &s;ay yes.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e that the friends of Mr. Jeffer&s;on, in Vir|ginia, where they have the majority, &s;hould aboli&s;h the di&s;|trict

election, and adopt a general ticket; whereby Mr. A|dams would be deprived of his one vote in that &s;tate, and the whole three would be &s;ecured to Mr. Jeffer&s;on. Sup|po&s;e further, that neither Maryland nor Delaware, in both of which Mr. Adams's friends are the majority, &s;hould fol|low the example. The election would then &s;tand thus:

<P>But if the friends of Mr. Adams in Maryland &s;hould retort on Virginia, by adopting a general ticket, or a legi&s;lative choice, the election would be re&s;tored to its true balance, and the majority of votes would be given back to Mr. Adams, to whom, he being the choice of the majority of the people, it properly belonged: Thus,

<P>If after the friends of Mr. Jeffer&s;on in Virginia, had taken this &s;tep of aboli&s;hing di&s;trict elections, in order to &s;ecure to him all the votes of that &s;tate, they, or their par|tizans here, &s;hould come and tell us, that it was contrary to the rights of the people to retort the blow, and re&s;tore the majority of votes to him who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the majority of wi&s;hes, &s;hould we hear them with patience?

If we did, we &s;hould richly de&s;erve to become hewers of wood and drawers of water, for the fir&s;t knave we might chance to meet.</P>
<P>This example needs no application. The very ca&s;e has happened. The numbers indeed are different, but the
<PB N="24" REF="037074_0024_100C46D21F947900">
principle and the re&s;ult are the &s;ame. Attend for a moment to the &s;tatement, and you will &s;ee it.</P>
<P>Penn&s;ylvania will have no election. The federali&s;ts, friends of Mr. Adams, contend for a di&s;trict election. The anti-federali&s;ts, friends of Mr. Jeffer&s;on, oppo&s;e it; and as they have a majority of two in one branch of the legi&s;lature, they, &s;ooner than con&s;ent to di&s;trict elections, prevent a law from pa&s;&s;ing and deprive the &s;tate of her vote. Take away her 15 votes, and there remain, in the re&s;t of the union 123, of which 62 is a majority.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e 123 Virginia gives 21, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts 16 and Maryland 10&mdash;in all 47.</P>
<P>Of the remaining 76 Mr. Jeffer&s;on may get exactly one half, 38, but no more. That is, 4 in Georgia, 8 in South-Carolina, 7 out of 12 in North-Carolina, 3 in Ten|ne&s;&s;ee, 4 in Kentucky and 12 in New-York&mdash;38. The o|ther half will be for Mr. Adams and general Pinckney, viz. 6 in New-Hamp&s;hire, 4 in Rhode-I&s;land, 9 in Connec|ticut, 4 in Vermont, 7 in Jer&s;ey, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> in Delaware, and 5 out of 12 in North-Carolina&mdash;38. So that taking away Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Maryland and Virginia, the re&s;t of the &s;tates are equally divided between the two candidates; and the e|lection, therefore, depends on the&s;e three &s;tates.</P>
<P>In a di&s;trict election, (the mode e&s;tabli&s;hed in tho&s;e three &s;tates, before the friends of Mr. Jeffer&s;on in Virginia abo|li&s;hed it there, in order to promote his election,) tho&s;e three &s;tates would, it is well known, &s;tand as follows:

<P>In giving Mr. Jeffer&s;on 2 votes by di&s;tricts in Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts, and 3 in Maryland, we allow him the utmo&s;t to which his partizans lay claim. On the contrary, in giving Mr. Adams only 6 in Virginia, we take the lowe&s;t calculation that his oppo&s;ers have ventured to make for him. The cal|culation is, therefore, as favorable to Mr. Jeffer&s;on as it can be made; and yet we &s;ee that it gives a majority of 7 votes again&s;t him in tho&s;e three &s;tates. As the re&s;t of the con|tinent
<PB N="25" REF="037074_0025_100C46D3AE1754E8">
is equally divided, tho&s;e 3 &s;tates govern the electi|on, and upon the whole vote Mr. Adams and gen. Pinck|ney get a clear majority of 7.</P>
<P>Virginia, under&s;tanding this matter, alters the mode of election, aboli&s;hes di&s;trict elections, and thus takes from Mr. Adams his 6 votes in Virginia, and gives them to Mr. Jeffer&s;on. The poll, then in tho&s;e 3 &s;tates, &s;tands thus:

<P>And the majority of 5 is thus given to Mr. Jeffer&s;on, who becomes pre&s;ident; although upon a fair expre&s;&s;ion of the public voice, by di&s;trict elections, there was a majori+ty of 7 again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Here Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts interpo&s;es, and does all that &s;he can to re&s;tore the balance, and to throw back the election into the hands of the majority. She adopts the legi&s;lative choice, and by that &s;tep takes from Mr. Jeffer&s;on the two votes which he would get in that &s;tate, and gives them to Mr. Adams and general Pinckney.

<P>Still, however, the balance is not re&s;tored; for Mr. Jeffer&s;on has gained 6 votes in Virginia to which he was not entitled, and has lo&s;t but 2 in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. He is &s;till 4 gainer by the abolition of di&s;trict elections. It depends on Maryland to re&s;tore the balance, and replace the election in the hands of the majority. Unle&s;s &s;he does it, the pre|&s;ident will be cho&s;en by the minority of the nation.</P>
<P>Should &s;he act with &s;en&s;e and vigor; &s;hould &s;he de&s;pi&s;e the clamors of this minority, who are endeavoring by fraud and tricks to palm a &s;purious pre&s;ident on the nation; &s;hould &s;he &s;ub&s;titute the legi&s;lative choice in&s;tead of the di&s;|trict election, the poll will &s;tand thus:

<P>The balance, even then, will not be completely re|&s;tored. The friends of Mr. Jeffer&s;on will have gained &s;ix by their manoeuvre in Virginia, and will have lo&s;t but five by the counteraction of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Maryland. The majority will not be as much again&s;t Mr. Jeffer&s;on, as it cer|tainly would be on a fair di&s;trict election. But it will be again&s;t him. The man who is the choice of a majority of the people, will obtain a majority of votes; and will be elected pre&s;ident: and the fraudulent arts of the anti-fede|rali&s;ts, for &s;muggling in a pre&s;ident who is not the choice of the majority, will be completely baffled.</P>
<P>But &s;hould the &s;tate of Maryland &s;uffer it&s;elf to be bul|lied out of its rights as a &s;tate, by the clamors of the partizans of Virginia; &s;hould the majority of the people of Maryland, who are friendly to the admini&s;tration, and de&s;irous of the re-election of Mr. Adams, &s;uffer them|&s;elves to be tricked out of their right to a pre&s;ident of their own choice, by the artifices of the minority, Mr. Jeffer&s;on's adherents? then will fraud be triumphant over right, the fair voice of the nation will be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and a man be placed in the pre&s;idential chair, contrary to the wi&s;hes of the American people.</P>
<P>This mu&s;t be the con&s;equence of &s;uffering di&s;trict electi|ons to remain in Maryland, while they are aboli&s;hed in Vir|ginia. Yet this con&s;equence, we are told, mu&s;t be &s;ub|mitted to, becau&s;e to change the mode of election, and adopt the legi&s;lative choice, would be an inva&s;ion of the rights of the people! In order to pre&s;erve their right of voting, their votes, when given, mu&s;t be rendered ineffectu|al! In order to pre&s;erve their right of voting, they mu&s;t be deprived of the right of having a pre&s;ident of their own choice, and compelled to take one who is the choice of the minority! A left-handed way this, of pre&s;erving the rights of the people!</P>

<HEAD><HI>PART THIRD.</HI> That if the Electors are appointed by the Legi&s;lature, &s;till both they and the Pre&s;ident will be chosen by the people, who elect the members of the Legi&s;lature.</HEAD>
<P>But how are the people deprived of their right of vot|ing, by transferring the choice of electors, from di&s;tricts to the legi&s;lature? Do not the people choo&s;e the members of that legi&s;lature by which the choice of electors is made? Do they not choo&s;e tho&s;e members with a direct view to that choice of electors? And do they not, in this way, as effectually influence the election of pre&s;ident, as if they them&s;elves cho&s;e the electors? Mo&s;t certainly they do. Let us take Ann-Arundel county, as an in&s;tance, or Bal|timore county. The people of Anne-Arundel county, a large majority of them at lea&s;t, are in favor of Mr. Adams as pre&s;ident, in preference to Mr. Jeffer&s;on. They will vote for Mr. Cha&s;e, &s;hould di&s;trict elections remain. Why will they vote for Mr. Cha&s;e? Becau&s;e they know that he, as an elector, will vote for Mr. Adams. Their object, there|fore, is to promote the election of Mr. Adams. If, there|fore, in&s;tead of voting for Mr. Cha&s;e, in order that he may, if cho&s;en, vote for Mr. Adams, they &s;hould vote for Dr. Wharfield, major Brogden, Mr. Worthington and Mr. Weems, who as members of the legi&s;lature will choo&s;e an elector that will vote for Mr. Adams, do they not as ef|fectually influence and promote the election of Mr. Adams in one ca&s;e as in the other? Is not the pre&s;ident as much cho&s;en by them in one ca&s;e as in the other? How then are they deprived of their right of voting in the election of pre|&s;ident? In either ca&s;e, they choo&s;e the men by whom the pre&s;ident is cho&s;en. The only difference is, that in one ca&s;e they vote for four men who will choo&s;e Mr. A|dams as pre&s;ident, and in the other ca&s;e they vote for one man who will choo&s;e Mr. Adams as pre&s;ident. The re&s;ult is ex|actly the &s;ame, as far as re&s;pects the influence of the people in the election. In both ca&s;es they &s;ub&s;tantially choo&s;e the pre&s;ident, by choo&s;ing the men by whom he is to be cho&s;en, and choo&s;ing them with an expre&s;s view to that choice. In one ca&s;e, moreover, they have the trouble of two elections; fir&s;t for members of a&s;&s;embly and &s;econdly for electors; whereas in the other, one election is &s;ufficient.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="037074_0028_100C46DB19C2E4F8">And yet there are per&s;ons who hold the under&s;tandings of the people in &s;uch contempt, as to tell them, that they will be deprived of their votes in the election of pre&s;ident, by transferring the choice of the electors from them&s;elves to the legi&s;lature, who&s;e members they them&s;elves are to choo&s;e!</P>
<P>There is one other argument of mo&s;t conclu&s;ive force, for the legi&s;lative choice, to the people of Baltimore, Alle|gany and Anne-Arundel counties. In each of tho&s;e three counties there is a majority of federali&s;ts. If, therefore, the electors are cho&s;en by the legi&s;lature, the federal majorities in tho&s;e three counties, will have their due weight in the election of electors and of pre&s;ident: for they will each choo&s;e four members of the legi&s;lature; and tho&s;e members will have an equal vote with the members of any other counties in the choice of electors. Of con&s;equence, tho&s;e counties will have as much influence in the election of pre&s;i|dent, as any other three counties in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>But how will it be if the di&s;trict election &s;hould continue? Allegany is united in the &s;ame di&s;trict with Wa&s;hington. In Wa&s;hington there is an anti-federal majority, which may overbear the federal majority of Allegany; and in that ca&s;e the county of Wa&s;hington choo&s;es the elector, and Alle|gany is deprived of all influence in the election of pre&s;i|dent. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation applies to Anne-Arundel county, which is united in the &s;ame di&s;trict with Baltimore town; and to Baltimore county, which is united with Har|ford. In ca&s;e of a di&s;trict election, tho&s;e two counties may be deprived of all influence in the choice of pre&s;ident; &s;ince their federal majorities may be overpowered by the anti-federal majorities of Baltimore town and Harford county: whereas &s;hould the legi&s;lature appoint the electors, their members will have their due weight in the appointment, and of cour&s;e in the election of pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>The remark will al&s;o apply to the city of Annapolis, which is connected, in the di&s;trict election, with Baltimore town: and perhaps to Talbot county; where there is rea&s;on to be|lieve that the majority is federal, and will be overborne by the anti-federal county of Queen-Anne.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>Why then, people of Maryland, are the advocates of Mr. Jeffer&s;on &s;o clamorous in favor of di&s;trict elections here, af|ter
<PB N="29" REF="037074_0029_100C46DCB630A288">
having aboli&s;hed them in Virginia, and &s;ucce&s;sfully op|po&s;ed their e&s;tabli&s;hment in Penn&s;ylvania! Is it from af|fection to the rights of the people, about which they affect to have become, all on a &s;udden, &s;o zealous! No, no. The veil is too thin to re&s;i&s;t the mo&s;t ordinary penetration. If they were indeed actuated by a &s;acred regard to the rights of the people, they would wi&s;h to &s;ee the &s;en&s;e of the ma|jority prevail. If they were indeed actuated by a &s;acred regard to the rights of the people, they would make no at|tempts to deprive the people, under flim&s;y pretexts, of their only valuable &s;ub&s;tantial right, their right to a pre&s;i|dent of their choice! If they were indeed of opinion that di&s;trict elections are a &s;acred right of the people, they would not have aboli&s;hed them in Virginia, and prevented them in Penn&s;ylvania! They would not contend for one right on one &s;ide of the Potowmac, and for another right on the other &s;ide! Whence then their new-found and cla|morous zeal for di&s;trict elections; with the vital blood of which the hands of their friends beyond the Potowmac are &s;till reeking? The &s;ecret lies here. They know that by di&s;|trict elections in this &s;tate, Mr. Jeffer&s;on might get two or three votes, and therefore they &s;truggle to retain them. They knew that by di&s;trict elections in Virginia, Mr. A|dams would have obtained &s;ix or eight votes there; and therefore they exultingly aboli&s;hed them in Virginia. They know that by di&s;trict elections in Penn&s;ylvania, Mr. Adams would divide that &s;tate with Mr. Jeffer&s;on, and probably get a majority: and therefore they oppo&s;e their e&s;tabli&s;h|ment there; in hopes of at length wearying out the fede|rali&s;ts, and obtaining a general ticket, whereby all the votes would be &s;ecured to their candidate. This is the true &s;e|cret of their conduct, and not an attachment to di&s;trict e|lections, or the rights of the people; for both of which they manife&s;t the utmo&s;t contempt, whenever it &s;uits their purpo&s;e to trample them under foot.</P>
<P>Their real object is to &s;ecure the election of their candi|date, by all means, fair or foul; to impo&s;e him on the na|tion as pre&s;ident, contrary to the clear and known wi&s;h of the majority; to &s;tifle the voice of that majority, by arti|fices in one &s;tate, clamors in another, and the violation of e|very right in a third; while di&s;trict elections are their
<PB N="30" REF="037074_0030_100C46DEE2DF46D0">
&s;talking hor&s;e, and a clamor about the rights of the people is the in&s;trument wherewith they work.</P>
<P>People of Maryland, di&s;tru&s;t &s;uch clamors. When the wolf, with his jaws &s;till red with the gore of the lamb, affects an extraordinary &s;olicitude about the &s;afety of the &s;heepfold, believe that he is as much in earne&s;t, as the ad|herents of Mr. Jeffer&s;on are, when they affect an ardent at|tachment to di&s;trict elections on one &s;ide of the Potowmac, after having ju&s;t fini&s;hed their de&s;truction on the other &s;ide. The clamor about di&s;trict elections and the rights of the people, coming from &s;uch a quarter, is mo&s;t evidently intended as a cloak to conceal the mo&s;t fatal attack that can be made on your rights; an attack on your right to a chief magi&s;trate cho&s;en by the majority of the nation. This is the great e&s;&s;ential right, for the pre&s;ervation of which, all &s;ubordinate rights are in&s;tituted. Di&s;tru&s;t the men who advi&s;e you to adhere to the latter at the expence of the former. While that great right, the right of being govern|ed by a chief magi&s;trate cho&s;en by the majority, &s;hall re|main to you unimpaired, your liberties will be &s;afe. Let that once be &s;natched from you; let the choice of chief magi&s;trate once be transferred from the majority to the minority; and whether it be done by fraud or by force, by the violence of &s;trangers, or the artifices of &s;ome among your&s;elves; the effect is the &s;ame. Your &s;olid valuable rights are annihilated; all that could di&s;tingui&s;h you as freemen di&s;appears; and your boa&s;ted liberty becomes an un&s;ub&s;tantial name, "the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion."</P>
<P>I have now, Me&s;&s;rs. printers, executed as well as I am able, the ta&s;k which I &s;ometime ago undertook. I have ex|ecuted it with a zeal in&s;pired by truth, and warmed by the cau&s;e for which I contend, the rights of the majority, and the fair choice of a chief magi&s;trate by the &s;uffrage of the American people. Whatever &s;ucce&s;s may attend my feeble exertions, I &s;hall enjoy the &s;atisfaction re&s;ulting from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having di&s;charged my duty, ac|cording to my &s;tation, and to the be&s;t of my abilities; and confiding the event to that Providence, which in &s;o many trying emergencies, has watched over the de&s;tinies of the American nation, I &s;hall remain a re&s;igned, though anxious</P>
