<HEAD>THE <HI>EXAMINER,</HI> OR, <HI>Gilbert</HI> again&s;t <HI>Tennent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_WHEN I had read over Mr. <HI>G. Ten|nent</HI>'s three fir&s;t Sermons on <HI>Rev.</HI> 3&punc;3. repre&s;enting the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity of holding fa&s;t the Truth,</HI> with the <HI>Appendix,</HI> relating to the <HI>Moravian Errors,</HI> &amp;c. I immediately reviewed and compared therewith his <HI>famous</HI> Sermon preach'd at <HI>Nottingham</HI> upon <HI>the Danger of an Unconverted Mini&s;try,</HI> on <HI>Mark</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> 44. And mu&s;t confe&s;s it is as impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile them upon the Principles of <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> as to unite the <HI>two Poles.</HI></P>
<P>But then putting on that Charity which <HI>is not ea&s;ily provoked,</HI> and <HI>hopeth all Things,</HI> I endeavoured to con|&s;ider the three Sermons as a <HI>Retractation</HI> of the <HI>Notting|ham</HI> Sermon; That altho' he did not expre&s;ly retract it, yet I would charitably ca&s;t it in this Light, for the &s;ake of <HI>Catholick Unity,</HI> and becau&s;e it &s;eems hard for an <HI>High Prie&s;t</HI> to confe&s;s his <HI>Errors</HI> even once a Year, tho' he may love to be <HI>Father Confe&s;&s;or</HI> him&s;elf, and bring others to the Stool.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="005200_0004_1016E28E08B73380">
But upon Enquiry, it is to be &s;u&s;pected that Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> never de&s;ign'd that the&s;e <HI>three Sermons</HI> &s;hould &s;uperceed the other; but that they &s;hould con&s;i&s;t and tra|vel together like good Companions. For it is plain that after Mr. <HI>T</HI>&mdash;had preached the&s;e Sermons at <HI>N. York,</HI> in <HI>April</HI> 1742, his Sermon at <HI>Nottingham</HI> receives a new Edition at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> from the <HI>&s;econd Edition</HI> printed at <HI>Phi|ladelphia;</HI> by which it appears that Mr. <HI>T.</HI> or his Friends, in&s;tead of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it, have been careful to propagate it, as his <HI>Ma&s;ter-Piece;</HI> and indeed it is a Ma&s;ter-Piece of it's kind: And not only &s;o, but I'm credibly inform'd, that he has lately ju&s;tified it, as containing the genuine Sentiments of his Soul; and I'm apt to think he has &s;po|ken the Truth. And no wonder Mr. <HI>T.</HI> won't abate one Jot or Tittle of it, &s;ince Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d</HI> has judg'd it <HI>an unan&s;werable Piece:</HI> for <HI>his Coun&s;el</HI> it &s;eems with ma|ny in the&s;e Days is, <HI>as if a Man had enquired at the O|racle of GOD.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Queri&s;ts, Part</HI> III, <HI>Page</HI> 5, take Notice, that it hath been ob&s;erved that when it is Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s turn to &s;peak, then Mr. <HI>G. Tennent</HI> is proclaimed the <HI>mo&s;t able, mo&s;t eminent Servant of Chri&s;t, and all his A&s;&s;ociates or Party, &s;piritual Men, and faithful Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. And in the <HI>Examiner, Pag.</HI> 149, it is affirmed, that when Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> preached a Sermon at <HI>Phila|delphia,</HI> he told a numerous Audience, that there were but few faithful Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t in the&s;e Parts; and if he mu&s;t be plain and name them, it was the <HI>Tennents</HI> and their Adherents: The like he did at <HI>Fog's Mannor.</HI>
<P>On the other Hand, If their Turn comes to &s;peak or write, then Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> is proclaimed the <HI>mo&s;t able, and mo&s;t eminent Ser|vant of Chri&s;t.</HI>&mdash;When there is &s;uch an Hue and Cry after Pha|ri&s;ees, we would be glad to know, whether it would be &s;afe for the other &s;ide to trumpet one anothers Prai&s;es &s;o loudly and highly as this &s;ide doth, without being in Danger of being taken up for Phari&s;ees, and having the Crows Eggs ca&s;t in their Teeth? becau&s;e Chri&s;t &s;aith to tho&s;e Phari&s;ees that were offended at him for heal|ing a Man on the Sabbath, John 5, 44. <HI>How can ye believe, that receive Honour one of another?</HI></P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="005200_0005_1016E250F4B08A68">
It is plain al&s;o, That Mr. <HI>T&mdash;t</HI>'s zealous Advocates here and el&s;ewhere, have by way of <HI>Charity,</HI> di&s;pers'd about the Country great Numbers of the la&s;t Edition, tending to corrupt the Minds of People from the <HI>Sim|plicity which is in Chri&s;t,</HI> and to promote that <HI>Confu&s;ion</HI> and <HI>&s;eparating Spirit</HI> which he him&s;elf has been in&s;tru|mental of rai&s;ing in many of our Places; <HI>Which the Lord rebuke in his Time.</HI> For many are fully per&s;waded that Mr. <HI>T&mdash;t</HI>'s Sermon and Practice upon it, have &s;own the Seeds of all that <HI>Di&s;cord, Intru&s;ion, Confu&s;ion, Sepa|ration, Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Seditions, Here&s;ies,</HI> &amp;c. that have been &s;pringing up in &s;o many of the Towns and Churches <HI>thro' the Province for two Years pa&s;t.</HI> Who hath been &s;o in&s;trumental to hatch the <HI>Cockatrice</HI> as him&s;elf, tho' at the &s;ame Time he could gravely advi&s;e others to <HI>cru&s;h it in the Egg</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See his printed Letter to Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on.</HI></NOTE>. His <HI>Principiis ob&s;ta</HI> is given out too late in the Day: That is to &s;ay, <HI>After Vows make Enquiry,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>letting alone Contention before it be medled with.</HI></P>
<P>Whoever will take the Pains to con&s;ider the main Scope of Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI>'s Sermon at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> will find the Principles of it to be &s;ubver&s;ive of Go&s;pel Order, the publick Mini&s;try and publick Means of Education; and what have we more? What could <HI>touch the Apple of our Eye</HI> like this fatal Blow. It is a <HI>Blow at the Root.</HI></P>
<P>Take here by the Way, the Sentiments of the <HI>Synod</HI> in the <HI>Examination,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Page</HI> 81, <HI>viz</HI> <Q>We look up|on Mr. <HI>T&mdash;'s</HI> printed Sermon preach'd at <HI>Nottingham</HI> to be a notable In&s;tance of their &s;owing Seeds of Divi|&s;ion, and we charge him with perverting Scripture, uncharitable ra&s;h Judging of the Body of the Clergy of this Generation in the Lump, and encouraging Facti|ons and Di&s;orders therein; and &s;ay we, This, This, This, and the like Speeches thereunto, filled the Minds of many People again&s;t their &s;tated Pa&s;tors, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="005200_0006_1016E290AAA34C68">
Furthermore, I can't find any Room for rational Chri|&s;tian Charity to think that Mr. <HI>T</HI>&mdash;ever intended that his la&s;t Di&s;cour&s;es &s;hould be interpreted as a Retracta|tion of his Sermon at <HI>Nottingham;</HI> and therefore as long as he holds two Sett of Principles as oppo&s;ite to one another, as the heatheni&s;h Principles of a good and an evil god, and until he makes a publick and &s;olemn Re|tractation of <HI>that Sermon,</HI> it is but ju&s;t and equal to &s;et <HI>Gilbert</HI> again&s;t <HI>Tennent,</HI> and <HI>judge him out of his own Mouth.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, Having reviewed the <HI>florid Preface</HI> to Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI>'s late Di&s;cour&s;es, &s;ub&s;cribed by <HI>Six Reve|rend Divines,</HI> <Q>of who&s;e Opinion it's &s;aid much U&s;e is made in the Country,</Q> I &s;tumbled at the Thre&s;hold again, when I could not find one Word to help out my Charity towards reconciling Mr. <HI>T&mdash;t</HI> with him&s;elf: But they &s;et it forth as an Epi&s;tle of Commendation of this their <HI>dear Brother</HI> and his Works without any Ex|ception.</P>
<P>They call his Performance, <Q><HI>A Labour of Love and Effort of holy Zeal of One that has learn'd to contend earne&s;tly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints; and with the Light of a wi&s;e Ma&s;ter-Builder, on the Foundation which Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles have laid.</HI></Q> The Metaphor would run as &s;moothly in the Words of the great <HI>Apo&s;tle, A Workman that needeth not to be a&s;hamed, rightly</HI> dividing <HI>the Word of Truth.</HI></P>
<P>They &s;ay further, <Q>When this our <HI>dear Brother, who&s;e Prai&s;e is in the Churches</HI> thro' the Provinces, vi&s;ited us at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> two Years ago, and in the Spirit of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> entred into his Labours here; it plea&s;ed God in a wonderful Manner to crown his abundant Services with Succe&s;s, in the Conviction, and (we tru&s;t) Conver&s;ion of many Souls: As there|fore the Name of Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> is greatly endear'd to us, &s;o we be&s;eech our a&s;cended SAVIOUR, the Head
<PB N="7" REF="005200_0007_1016E25284268000">of the Church long to continue him for a burning Light, and exten&s;ive Ble&s;&s;ing to our Provinces; and in particular to u&s;e this faithful, judicious, and &s;ea&s;on|able Endeavour of his Servant, for a Guard and De|fence about his own &s;acred Truths, and his glorious Work in the mid&s;t of us, which too many are ready to &s;peak evil of and oppo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>One mu&s;t be cloathed with Charity down to the Foot to think that the&s;e <HI>Reverend Gentlemen</HI> had not &s;een Mr. <HI>Tennent's</HI> Sermon at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> &amp;c. which &s;tands in direct Oppo&s;ition to &s;ome Parts of his Doctrine and Con|duct expre&s;t in the&s;e Sermons and el&s;ewhere, as I &s;hall demon&s;trate in parallel Lines.</P>
<P>If therefore they had well confidered and compared the one with the other, how is it reconcileable with the <HI>Simplicity that is in CHRIST,</HI> to repre&s;ent Mr. <HI>T</HI>&mdash; as &s;uch a <HI>burning Light,</HI> when his Spots are &s;o con&s;pi|cuous to the mo&s;t cur&s;ory Reader?&mdash; One might expect that if Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> had not the Ingenuity to &s;ay, <HI>I Re|pent,</HI> that at lea&s;t the&s;e <HI>Reverend Gentlemen</HI> would have attempted a Reconciliation for him, if they think as <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> generally do that <HI>Infallibility may mi&s;take.</HI></P>
<P>Nay ought they not to have &s;aid publickly (as it is affirmed One of them &s;aid in private Conver&s;ation) that Mr. <HI>T. was now come Right:</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e he meant <HI>Right about;</HI> which implies, that <HI>he had been Wrong.</HI> But it &s;eems no Man dar'd or car'd to &s;ay unto him, <HI>Why do&s;t thou &s;uch Things?</HI> Such is the Danger of <HI>ha|ving Men's Per&s;ons in Admiration, becau&s;e of Advantage.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;eems, Such a prime In&s;trument of <HI>the Work</HI> that has been going on in the <HI>American</HI> Provinces for the two la&s;t Years, mu&s;t be judged infallible and &s;upported with the highe&s;t <HI>Encomiums</HI> of Six mo&s;t Reverend Mi|ni&s;ters,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr.</HI> Colman <HI>thus magnifies him to Mr.</HI> Whitefield, <HI>in a Let|ter publi&s;hed in the fir&s;t Weekly Paper printed at</HI> Gla&s;gow, <HI>viz.</HI> We receiv'd him (Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI>) ju&s;t as we did you, as an Angel of Chri&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>

Many Mini&s;ters as well as People greatly quickened.

<P>The Reader may take this Examination as an help to di&s;cover <HI>what is Truth</HI> in the <HI>late Religious Commotion</HI> in this Country, and he will find it to be ju&s;t that which the <HI>Oppo&s;ers</HI> &s;o called, are zealous to maintain, <HI>viz.</HI> the Or|der of the Go&s;pel, and the &s;acred Honours due to the holy Spirit of God. Strip <HI>this Work</HI> of its <HI>Extraordinary's,</HI> and you will di&s;cern what is <HI>the Work of God,</HI> from that which is added to it <HI>by Art</HI> and <HI>Man's device.</HI> <Q>Pray what is there extraordinary on one &s;ide more that t'other; but what is ju&s;tly to be exploded, <HI>viz.</HI> extraordinary Errors, Di&s;orders, Intru&s;ions, ra&s;h Cen&s;ures, Clamours, Excla|mations, vain glorious Boa&s;tings, Fits, Pretence of Sights and Vi&s;ions, Roarings, Tremblings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Com|pare Mr. <HI>T</HI>&mdash;with him&s;elf, and &s;have off his Extraordi|nary's (turning the edge of his own Weapon upon him|&s;elf) and <HI>his Strength will go from him, and he will be like any other Man; a Man Subject to like Pa&s;&s;ions as we are.</HI> I can't find but that the <HI>New-Brun&s;wick Party</HI> are fallible as other Men, and chargeable with as many Errors, Intru|&s;ions, Contradictions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as their Neighbours, <Q>whom they are ready to condemn as <HI>Enemies of God's Work</HI> and <HI>Enemies of Religion</HI> meerly for oppo&s;ing their Errors and real in Di&s;cretions:" Whereas the true Intere&s;t of Re|ligion is doubtle&s;s &s;erved by &s;uch Oppo&s;ition.</Q></P>

I know of no <HI>&s;horter Method</HI> to open the Eyes of <HI>blind party-Zealots,</HI> and convince them of the bad Tendency of extraordinary Self-Conceit, Dominion, ra&s;h Judging, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> than to bring them home to their own Doors, and turn the&s;e edge Tools upon them&s;elves; prove them now here|with, and you will find the&s;e crucified Gentlemen have yet as much Sen&s;ation and are as ready to <HI>cry out of Dan|ger</HI> as any of their abu&s;ed Neighbours.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moravians</HI> it &s;eems treated Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> in the &s;ame uncharitable, cen&s;orious, imperious, divi&s;ive Manner in which he him&s;elf has treated the <HI>Body of the Clergy of this Generation,</HI> and then the Spirit appears to him in a mo&s;t frightful Shape, and mu&s;t be avoided. <HI>Now it is come up|on thee, thou fainte&s;t: And it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</HI></P>
<P>It is generally tho't that Mr. <HI>D&mdash;pt's</HI> clamorous Preaching in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> again&s;t unconverted Mini&s;ters, e&s;pe|cially at <HI>C&mdash;p</HI>'s Hill, tended more to open the Mouths of &s;ome <HI>Reverend leading Mini&s;ters</HI> there, to <HI>forbid the mad|ne&s;s of the Prophet,</HI> than &s;even Men that can render a Rea&s;on. Therefore let the Clergy as well as Laity <HI>bear one another's Burdens,</HI> and <HI>remember them that are in Bonds as bound with them, and as being them&s;elves al&s;o in the Body. Therefore all things what&s;oever ye would that Men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In fine,</HI> I mu&s;t earne&s;tly advi&s;e Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> to retract his famous Sermon at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and call in the &s;everal Editions of it, for 'till then it is as impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile <HI>Gilbert</HI> with <HI>Tennent</HI> as to mingle Light with Darkne&s;s, <HI>a double minded Man is un&s;table in all his Ways:</HI> Nay, I think he ought in Con&s;cience to make a &s;olemn Retracta|tion of it and cry <HI>Peccavi,</HI> (and all &s;uch Changlings with him.) For it is a meer <HI>Incendiary</HI> wherever it tracks abroad and nothing but the <HI>Fire</HI> can purge and purify it.</P>
<P><HI>If any Mans Work abide which he hath built upon the true Foundation which is Chri&s;t, he &s;hall receive a Reward. If any Mans Work &s;hall be burnt, he &s;hall &s;uffer lo&s;s, but he him&s;elf &s;hall be &s;aved, yet &s;o as by Fire.</HI></P>
