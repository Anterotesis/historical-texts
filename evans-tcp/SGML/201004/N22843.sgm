<HEAD>THE LIFE OF <HI>THOMAS PAIN,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been e&s;tabli&s;hed by the reiterated &s;uffrage of mankind, that the lives of tho&s;e per&s;ons, who have either performed u&s;eful actions, or neglected e&s;&s;ential duties, ought to be recounted, as much for an ex|ample to the pre&s;ent age, as for the in&s;truction of future times.</P>
<P>Few men have more ju&s;tly merited the honour of this notice, either as an example to be avoided at pre&s;ent, or as a le&s;&s;on to be learned here|after, than the per&s;onage, who&s;e actions we are now to recount, and who&s;e writings we are about to defend.</P>
<P>The borough of Thetford, in the county of Norfolk, has in the &s;ame manner become dignified by the birth of Pain, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our author's real name is <HI>Pain:</HI> his fictitious name is <HI>Paine</HI> with a final <HI>e:</HI> For, his father's name was <HI>Pain;</HI> his own name was <HI>Pain,</HI> when he married, when he corre&s;ponded with the Exci&s;e, and when he fir&s;t appeared in America: but, finding &s;ome inconvenience in his real name, or &s;eeing &s;ome advantage in a fictitious one, he thus changed the name of his family; and he thus exerci&s;ed a freedom, which only great men enjoy for honourable ends.</NOTE> as the Rubicon was en|nobled by the pa&s;&s;age of Cae&s;ar. At Thetford he was born on the 29th of January, 1736-7. His father was Jo&s;eph Pain, the &s;on of a &s;mall but reputable farmer, a &s;tay-maker by trade, and a Quaker in religion: His mother was Frances Cocke, the daughter of an attorney at Thetford, and of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. Jo&s;eph Pain was a reputable citizen, and, though poor, an hone&s;t man: Frances Cocke was a woman of a four tem|per and an eccentric character: and they were married in the pari&s;h of Eu&s;ton, near Thetford, on the 20th of June, 1734. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the regi&s;ter of the pari&s;h of Ea&s;ton.</NOTE> By thus taking his wife from <HI>the church,</HI> Jo&s;eph Pain was by his own act and the rules of the Quakers, at once expelled from their community. But, neither this irregularity, nor this expul&s;ion, prevented that benevolent &s;ect from pity|ing his di&s;tre&s;&s;es through life, and relieving his wants as they were &s;een. The father and mother both lived to know their &s;on's vices, to pity his misfortunes, to hear of his fame, but to partake little of his bounty. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;eph Pain was buried at Thetford, on the 14th of November, 1786, aged 78.&mdash;Frances Pain, widow, was buried on the 18th of May, 1789, recorded to be 94: but, as &s;he was born in January 1697-8, the pari&s;h regi&s;ter makes her age to be greater than it was, though &s;he had far outlived the period which is a&s;&s;igned to mortals.</NOTE> It aro&s;e probably from the tenets of the father and the eccentricity of the mother, that our author was never baptized, <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">As he was not baptized, the bapti&s;m of Thomas Pain is not entered on the pari&s;h books of Thetford. It is a remarkable fact, that the leaves of the two regi&s;ters of the pari&s;hes of St. Cuthbert's and St. Peter's in Thetford, containing the marriages, births, and burials, from the end of 1733, to the beginning of 1737, have been completely cut out. Thus a felony has been committed again&s;t the public, and an injury done to individuals, by a hand very malicious and wholly unknown. Whether our author, when he re&s;ided at Thetford in 1787, looked into the&s;e regi&s;ters for his own birth; what he &s;aw, or what he did, we will not conjecture. They contain the bapti&s;m of his &s;i&s;ter Elizabeth, on the 28th of Augu&s;t, 1738.</NOTE> though he was privately
<PB N="4" REF="030178_0003_0FE4BF11123A2340">
named, and never received, like true Chri&s;tians, into the bo&s;om of any church, though he was indeed confirmed by the bi&s;hop of Norwich; ow|ing to the orthodox zeal of Mi&s;tre&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ocke, his aunt, a woman of &s;uch goodne&s;s, that though &s;he lived on a &s;mall annuity, &s;he imparted much of this little to his mother, while he neglected his aged parent, amid&s;t his cares for mankind.</P>
<P>Our author was educated at the free-&s;chool of Thetford, under Mr. Knowles, who, whatever were his merits, is &s;aid never to have ri&s;en to be ma&s;ter. The expen&s;e of young Pain's education was defrayed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, by his father, but chiefly by the relations of his mother. He was deemed a &s;harp boy, of un&s;ettled application; but he left no performances which denote juvenile vigour, or uncommon attainments. His tuition was directed, by his expectations, to what is u&s;eful, more than to what is ornamental; to reading, writing, and cyphering, which are &s;o commodious to trade&s;men, rather than to cla&s;&s;ical knowledge, which is &s;o decorous in gentlemen. With &s;uch in&s;truction, he left the &s;chool, at the age of thirteen, in order to learn his father's trade. The bu&s;ine&s;s of a &s;taymaker he never liked, or indeed any occupation, which required attentive diligence and &s;teady effort. He, however, worked on with his father, fitting &s;tays for the ladies of Thetford, during &s;ix years, except for a &s;hort while that he laboured with a cou&s;in, in making bodices for the girls of Shipdam, in the county of Norfolk. But though he had thus been educated, according to the recommendation of Mr. Locke; though a trade be better than hou&s;e and land; yet the trade, and hou&s;e, and land, are of no avail, if the per&s;on have not moral rectitude, and no heedful indu&s;try.</P>
<P>At the age of twenty, and in the year 1757, our author adventured to London, the common receptacle of the valiant and the wi&s;e, of the needy and the opulent, of the bu&s;y and the idle. In this crowd, which con|founds the greate&s;t with the lea&s;t, Pain cannot be di&s;tingui&s;hed. With whom he worked, or whom he fitted, tradition has not recounted. It is, however, certain, that London did not enjoy long the honour of his re&s;idence; no ma&s;ter was helped for many months by his journeywork; and few ladies had the happine&s;s of being &s;tayed by his &s;kilful hand.</P>
<P>He was &s;oon prompted by his re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s, to look for new pro&s;pects at Dover, in 1758. For almo&s;t a twelvemonth our author worked with Mr. Grace, a re&s;pectable &s;taymaker in that ancient cinque-port. Meantime, Mi&s;s Grace either won our author's heart, or our author attempted to win the heart of Mi&s;s Grace. And the father was thus induced to lend him ten pounds, in order to enable our adventurer to &s;et up as a ma&s;ter &s;taymaker at Sandwich. Yet is it certain, that he neither married the lady, nor repaid the loan.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="030178_0004_0FE4BF2E24125C18">At Sandwich he &s;ettled early in 1759. Biographers have been diligent to di&s;cover in what hou&s;es famous men had lived at particular periods of their depre&s;&s;ion, or their elevation. Of our author it can be only told, that he lodged in the market-place. The well known antiquary of this ancient port has not yet determined, whether he were not the fir&s;t who had here u&s;ed the my&s;tery of &s;tay-making. It is, however, certain, that he practi&s;ed other arts. There is a tradition, that in his lodging he collected a congregation, to whom he preached as an independent, rather than a Meth|odi&s;t. While thus occupied, he became enamoured of the per&s;on, or the property, of Mary Lambert, the waiting maid of the wife of Richard Solly, an eminent woollen-draper at Sandwich. Mary Lambert, who is &s;till prai&s;ed by her own &s;ex as a pretty girl of mode&s;t behaviour, our au|thor married on the 27th of September, 1759.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the church regi&s;ter there is the following entry:&mdash;</P>

The fact is, that our author has always appeared to female eyes a dozen years older than he was, owing to the hardne&s;s of his features, or to the &s;cars of di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Marriage is the great epoch of a man's life. Our author was now to maintain his wife and family by his trade. The tradition of Sandwich &s;till repeats, that he expected a fortune on his marriage, which he never found. In expectation there are doubtle&s;s degrees of compari&s;on. A man beginning life, as a &s;tay-maker, on ten pounds of borrowed money, has other hopes and other fears, than men of va&s;t wealth and unbounded expectancy. He certainly was di&s;appointed both in his plea&s;ure and his profit: and di&s;appointment has a &s;ad effect on the human con&s;titution. Two months had hardly elap&s;ed, when our author's ill u&s;age of his wife became apparent to the whole town, and excited the indignation of &s;ome, with the pity of others. Influenced by the genuine goodne&s;s of the En|gli&s;h character, Mrs. Solly relieved the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of her favourite maid with con&s;tant &s;olicitude. For almo&s;t a twelvemonth this unhappy cou|ple lived in comfortle&s;s lodgings. At length he took a hou&s;e, without being able to furni&s;h it. Mr. Rutter, a reputable broker of Sandwich, &s;upplied him with &s;uch furniture as he wanted. But it &s;oon appeared, that our author rather de&s;ired relief than wi&s;hed for re&s;idence. And be|ing embarra&s;&s;ed with debts, and goaded by duns, he took the opportunity
<PB N="6" REF="030178_0005_0FE4BEF894B68D20">
of the fir&s;t Sunday morning to &s;ail from Sandwich, with his wife and goods, to Margate; where he &s;old by auction the &s;ame furniture, which Mr. Rutter had &s;upplied him on credit.</P>
<P>Our author, we fear, committed on this occa&s;ion an old crime, which has now a new name. In Henry VIIIth's days, he who obtained another's property by fal&s;e tokens, was puni&s;hed by pillory, as a cheat.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> Hen. viii. ch&punc; 1.</NOTE> In George IId.'s reign,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> Geo. 2. c. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> per&s;ons convicted of obtaining goods by fal&s;e pre|tences, were to be tran&s;ported, as &s;windlers. What a fine opportunity for our metaphy&s;ical &s;tate&s;men to di&s;cu&s;s, not &s;o much our author's practice as our author's principles. Had Thomas Pain been indicted at the Old Bailey, he might have in&s;i&s;ted, as he now in&s;i&s;ts, that the laws of England did not exi&s;t; and that the judges did not &s;it on the bench. The court would have been reduced to the dilemma of either &s;ending him to Bedlam, or to Bridewell; or of proceeding with the trial, and adjudging the guilty culprit to the colonies, or the cart's tail. The before-mentioned meta|phy&s;icians would have perhaps exclaimed, <HI>that in force there is no argument.</HI> True: But, as philo&s;ophers, you do not &s;urely di&s;pute fir&s;t principles; as logicians, you mu&s;t not argue again&s;t facts. Whether the laws of Great Britain actually exi&s;t, is not a theory to be debated, but a fact to be ac|knowledged: and he who denies the exi&s;tence of tho&s;e objects, which with his &s;en&s;es he perceives, is not &s;o much a declaimer to be confuted, as a madman to be confined, or a cheat to be corrected.</P>
<P>But, admitting that facts cannot be debated, that fir&s;t principles mu&s;t not be denied, that one's own exi&s;tence mu&s;t not be doubted, yet our author might have pleaded what he now pleads, that &s;ince the &s;tatute of Henry VIII. was made before he was born, he ought not to be &s;ent to the pillory under its provi&s;ions. Whether the court would have ordered the trial to proceed, or have &s;topped to argue a plea, which is not u&s;ually urged, mu&s;t have depended on circum&s;tances rather than on practice. You are tried, good-nature might have &s;aid, under rules, which, having once been e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Society, mu&s;t remain in force till the &s;ame authority &s;hall repeal them. Laws as they mu&s;t equally apply to all per&s;ons, and mu&s;t be uniformly executed at all times, cannot depend on circum&s;tances &s;o fleeting in their nature, and &s;o unefficacious in their end, as the birth of &s;ome per&s;ons, and the death of others. If no crim|inals could be tried but tho&s;e who drew their fir&s;t breath &s;ince the ex|i&s;tence of the law, many would be unre&s;trained, while the few alone could be puni&s;hed. If &s;ociety be a ble&s;&s;ing, this ble&s;&s;ing could not be enjoyed, were the members of &s;ociety to be in this manner oppo&s;ed to each other; the guilty again&s;t the innocent; the profligate again&s;t the virtuous; and the &s;trong again&s;t the weak. As the culprit's plea &s;trikes at the foundation of &s;ociety, &s;ociety mu&s;t either relinqui&s;h its authority, or reject a plea, which is de&s;tructive of it&s;elf. Thus every criminal, who denies the authority of tho&s;e laws, that the &s;ociety has enacted, and con|tinues to enforce, puts him&s;elf in a &s;tate of warfare again&s;t the &s;ociety, which is obliged, by a regard to its own &s;ecurity, to inform him of the &s;ad alternative, either of &s;ubmitting, or cea&s;ing to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the act of George II. for the puni&s;hment of &s;windlers, our au|thor might have in&s;i&s;ted, as he &s;till in&s;i&s;ts, that though it was made &s;ince
<PB N="7" REF="030178_0006_0FE4BF210FC7E2F0">
he was born, he had not con&s;ented to be bound by its penalties. Tho&s;e philo&s;ophers, the court might have &s;aid, who re&s;olve the &s;anction of laws into con&s;ent, mu&s;t either argue again&s;t fact, and therefore argue illogically, or they mu&s;t admit that this con&s;ent may be either expre&s;s or virtual. Children, who are protected by &s;ociety from the moment of their exi&s;tence, are obliged to obey the rules of &s;ociety, even before they arrive at &s;uch maturity of rea&s;on as to give their con&s;ent in the &s;malle&s;t affairs. Strangers, who land on our &s;hore, virtually declare, by the act of their landing, that they are willing to obey the laws of the country. When Engli&s;hmen circumnavigate the globe, they virtually avow, wherever they may touch, for refre&s;hments or inquiry, that they are willing to conform to the cu&s;toms of the people, whatever they may be. The mo&s;t civilized citizen, who goes among&s;t the rude&s;t &s;avages, mu&s;t profe&s;s peace, and practi&s;e obe|dience, or he would be treated as an enemy. Every man, therefore, who walks about among a people, avowing his di&s;obedience to their laws, becau&s;e he had not con&s;ented to their &s;anctions, declares him&s;elf to be in a &s;tate of warfare to all around him, like a &s;avage in a wilderne&s;s. This la&s;t plea of our author, like his two former ones, mu&s;t have been equally rejected by the court, as &s;uch an attack upon the exi&s;tence of &s;ociety, as makes &s;ociety ho&s;tile to him.</P>
<P>During a di&s;putatious age, it would be an excellent que&s;tion for meta|phy&s;ical di&s;qui&s;ition, how much more good had re&s;ulted to the world, had our author, when his peculiar pleas were thus rejected, been tran&s;|ported to the plantations at the public expen&s;e, in 1760, in&s;tead of tran&s;|porting him&s;elf, at his own expen&s;e, in 1774. It might ea&s;ily be proved without the arithmetical powers of Dr. Price, that our author's &s;even years' &s;ervitude would have expired in 1767. With his admirable pen he would have been ju&s;t ready at that critical epoch to have brought forward all the ble&s;&s;ings of independence, at lea&s;t &s;even years &s;ooner. Great Britain would in the &s;ame manner, and in the &s;ame time, have equally partaken in the benefits of their independence. The French too would have &s;even years &s;ooner enjoyed the felicity of &s;o bloodle&s;s a revolution, and &s;o tranquil a freedom. And la&s;t, but not lea&s;t, the Con&s;titutional Society would have &s;even years &s;ooner po&s;&s;e&s;t the heartfelt happine&s;s, amid&s;t the exhilaration of victuals and wine, of avowing their monarchical principles to an admiring world.</P>
<P>When our author had di&s;po&s;ed of Mr. Rutter's goods at Margate, he once more mingled with the crowds of London. Of the fate of his wife, rumour has &s;poken variou&s;ly. By &s;ome &s;he is &s;aid to have died on the road of ill u&s;age, and a premature birth. The women of Sandwich are po&s;itive, that &s;he died in the Briti&s;h Lying-in Ho&s;pital, in Brownlow-&s;treet, Long-acre; but the regi&s;ter of this charity, which is kept with commendable accuracy, evinces, that &s;he had not been received into this laudable refuge of female wretchedne&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A diligent &s;earch in the books of <HI>the London Lying-in Ho&s;pital</HI> in the City Road found no &s;uch per&s;on as Mi&s;tre&s;s Pain to have died in it, during the years <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> And there are others, who have convinced them&s;elves by diligent inquiry, that &s;he is &s;till alive, though the extreme ob&s;curity of her retreat prevents ready di&s;covery. The trials which our author had made of his trade, as they had brought him no plea&s;ure and little gain, induced him to renounce it at this time
<PB N="8" REF="030178_0007_0FE4BEE78EDD7738">
forever. When a youth, he had inquired into the duty, and envied the perqui&s;ites, of an exci&s;eman. His wife had, doubtle&s;s, &s;poken of the honours and emoluments of her father. And he was induced by the&s;e con&s;iderations in July, 1761, to &s;eek for &s;helter in his father's hou&s;e, that he might pro&s;ecute in quiet privacy the great object of his future cour&s;e.</P>
<P>After fourteen months of &s;tudy and trials our author was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the exci&s;e, in December, 1762, at the age of twenty-five. He owed this gratification of his wi&s;hes to the friendly interference of Mr. Cock|&s;edge, the learned recorder of Thetford. He was &s;oon &s;ent as a &s;uper-numerary to gage the brewers of Grantham; and in Augu&s;t, 1764, he was employed to watch the &s;mugglers of Alford. Whether, while he thus walked at Grantham, or rode as an exci&s;eman at Alford, his prac|tices had been mi&s;repre&s;ented by malice, or his di&s;hone&s;ty had been de|tected by watchfulne&s;s, tradition has not told us: but, it is certain, that he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his office, in Augu&s;t, 1765.</P>
<P>Our author, who appears to have had from nature no de&s;ire of accu|mulation, or rather no care of the future, was now reduced to extreme wretchedne&s;s. He was ab&s;olutely without food, without raiment, and without &s;helter. Bad, alas! mu&s;t that man be who finds no friends in London. He met with per&s;ons, who, from di&s;intere&s;ted kindne&s;s, gave him clothes, money, and lodging. Thus he lived till the beginning of July, 1766, when he was re&s;tored to the exci&s;e. But mere re&s;toration did not bring him pre&s;ent employment, or nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies. And he was about the &s;ame time obliged to enter into the &s;ervice of Mr. Noble, who kept the great Academy in Lemon-&s;treet, Goodman's fields, at a &s;alary of twenty pounds a year, with five pounds for finding his own lodg|ing. Here he continued, teaching Engli&s;h, and walking out with the children, till Chri&s;tmas, 1766, di&s;liked by the mi&s;tre&s;s, who &s;till remem|bers him, and hated by the boys, who were terrified by his har&s;hne&s;s. Mr. Noble relinqui&s;hed our author, without much regret, to Mr. Gardnor, who then taught a reputable &s;chool at Ken&s;ington: yet, owing to whatever cau&s;e, he walked with Mr. Gardnor's &s;cholars only the three fir&s;t months of 1767. His de&s;ire of <HI>preaching</HI> now returned on him: but applying to his old ma&s;ter for a certificate, to the bi&s;hop of London, of his qualifica|tions, Mr. Noble told his former u&s;her, that &s;ince he was only an Engli&s;h &s;cholar, he could not recommend him as a proper candidate for ordina|tion in the Church: yet our author determined to per&s;evere in his pur|po&s;e, without regular orders. And he <HI>preached</HI> in Moorfields, and in various populous places in England, as he was urged by his nece&s;&s;ities, or directed by his &s;pirit. The text, which &s;o emphatically inculcates, <HI>med|dle not with them that are given to change,</HI> we may ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e he &s;uper|ficially explained, or &s;eldom enforced.</P>
<P>The &s;cene ere long &s;hifted; and our author was at length to play an old part on a new &s;tage. In March, 1768, he was &s;ent, after &s;ome delays, to be exci&s;e-officer at Lewes, in Su&s;&s;ex. He now went to lodge with Mr. Samuel Ollive, a tobacconi&s;t and &s;hopkeeper of fair repute, in Lewes: but he &s;eems to have learned no practical le&s;&s;ons from his recent removals and his former di&s;tre&s;s.

whom, however, he expo&s;ed a temper, ob&s;tinate and overbearing, than to be con&s;idered by his official &s;uperiors as an exci&s;eman, remarkable for diligence and fidelity: and &s;uch were his enterpri&s;e on the water, and his intrepidity on the ice, that he became known by the appellation of <HI>commodore.</HI> He lived on, &s;u&s;pected as an exci&s;eman, and unbeloved as a friend, with Samuel Ollive till his death, in July, 1769. This worthy tobacconi&s;t died rather in bad circum&s;tances, leaving a widow, one daugh|ter, and &s;everal &s;ons, who have pro&s;pered as indu&s;trious citizens, and are re&s;pected as hone&s;t men. Our author, attempting to retain &s;ome of the effects of the decea&s;ed, was turned out of the hou&s;e by Mr. Atter&s;ol, the executor, with &s;uch circum&s;tances as implied di&s;tru&s;t of his integrity. He found his way, however, into the hou&s;e of Ollive, in 1770, by means of the widow and the daughter, who, doubtle&s;s, looked on him with other eyes. He opened ere long the &s;hop, in his own name, as a grocer, and on his own behalf continued to work the tobacco-mill of Ollive, however contrary both the &s;hop and the mill were to the maxims of the exci&s;e.

Pain had, however, gained her affections; and &s;he would have him, contrary to the advice of Mr. Atter&s;ol, her father's friend, and the remon&s;trances of her own relations. This mar|riage began inau&s;piciou&s;ly, and ended unhappily.

Yet, our author, however he may u&s;e other men's goods as his own, what|ever he may think of the &s;acredne&s;s of oaths, however he may regard the integrity of regi&s;ters, can ea&s;ily plead, that &s;ince he never con&s;ented to be bound by what the nation had &s;olemnly enacted, he cannot be guilty; a doctrine which is convenient indeed to him, however injurious

to the people, who&s;e property and who&s;e happine&s;s are &s;ecured by fair dealing and hone&s;t practice; by the &s;anction of oaths, and the authenticity of records.</P>
<P>After the&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune, and tho&s;e varieties of fame, our author commenced public writer in 1771. The electors of New Shoreham had lately &s;hone with &s;uch uncommon lu&s;tre, as to attract par|liamentary notice, and to incur parliamentary disfranchi&s;ement.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By 11 George III. ch. 55.</NOTE> A new election was now to be held, not &s;o much in a new manner, as on new principles. The poets of Lewes were called upon by Rumbold, the can|didate of fair preten&s;ions, to furni&s;h an appropriate &s;ong. Our author obtained the laurel, with three guineas for his pains. It may, then, be doubted, whether it be &s;trictly true, what he a&s;&s;erted, in his news-paper altercations, in 1779, that till the epoch of his <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> he had never publi&s;hed a &s;yllable.</P>
<P>If the di&s;tributing of printed papers be publication, it will &s;oon appear that our author had not been quite innocent of publi&s;hing, in England. He had ri&s;en, by &s;uperior energy, more than by greater hone&s;ty, to be a chief among the exci&s;emen. They had long &s;een, that whatever increa&s;e there had been in private wealth, or in public revenue, <HI>no increa&s;e came to them.</HI> Their allowance of one &s;hilling and nine-pence farthing a day, which had been always little, was now made le&s;s, by the ri&s;e in the price of provi&s;ions, from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of taxes, and the expan&s;ion of lux|ury. They thought them&s;elves &s;hut out from the general ble&s;&s;ing; which they beheld, &s;aid our author, <HI>like a map of Peru.</HI> A de&s;ign was thus formed by the exci&s;e officers throughout the kingdom, to apply to Par|liament for a con&s;ideration of the &s;tate of their &s;alaries. A common contribution was made for the common benefit. And our author en|gaged to write <HI>their Ca&s;e,</HI> which he produced, after many months' labour, in 1772. This is an octavo pamphlet of twenty-one pages, which, ex|clu&s;ive of <HI>The Introduction,</HI> is divided into two head; <HI>The State of the Salary of the Officers of Exci&s;e; Thoughts on the Corruption, ari&s;ing from the Poverty of Exci&s;e Officers.</HI> On the&s;e topics he &s;ays all that the able&s;t writer could have &s;aid. Truth indeed ea&s;ily &s;lides into the mind without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of ability, or the recommendations of artifice. But, if our author's maiden pamphlet be in&s;pected by critical malignity, it will be found, like his maturer writings, to abound in the fal&s;e grammar of il|literature, and the fal&s;e thoughts of inexperience. Vigour of &s;entiment and energy of manner will not be denied him. His fir&s;t pamphlet will be con&s;idered as his be&s;t performance by all tho&s;e, who regard truth as &s;uperior to fal&s;ehood, mode&s;ty to impudence, and ju&s;t complaint to fact|ious innovation.</P>
<P>Four thou&s;and of <HI>The Ca&s;e</HI> were printed by Mr. William Lee of Lewes, in 1772. But even the copies, which were intended for the Members of Parliament, were not all di&s;tributed. Our author on that occa&s;ion wrote <HI>a letter concerning the Nottingham officers,</HI> which was printed on a folio &s;heet; and to the&s;e he added another letter, enforcing his ca&s;e, on a folio page. Yet, all the&s;e efforts ended in no application to Par|liament, though our author bu&s;tled in London, through the winter of

1773. A rebellion of the exci&s;emen, who &s;eldom have the populace on their &s;ide, was not much feared by their &s;uperiors. The exci&s;emen could only reproach our author for receiving their money, without ob|taining them redre&s;s. And of Pain, who employed him, the printer complained, that he had never been paid for printing, though much had been contributed and little had been &s;pent. This is a memorable in&s;tance how ea&s;ily men may be led on to complain of their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, without any other &s;ucce&s;s, than making their &s;ub&s;equent condition wor&s;e than their fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e were not our author's only cares, who was &s;oon to encounter other evils. With the year 1774 misfortunes crowded fa&s;t upon him. He is one of tho&s;e characters, who, as they attend more to other men's affairs than their own, are frequently di&s;tingui&s;hed, in the world, by mi&s;|fortune's &s;cars. His inattention to his &s;hop, ere long le&s;t him without a &s;hop to attend. Difficulties &s;oon brought on di&s;tre&s;s; and di&s;tre&s;s drove him to do what &s;trict hone&s;ty did not ab&s;olutely warrant. He made a bill of &s;ale of his whole effects to Mr. Whiffeld, a reputable gro|cer at Lewes, who was his principal creditor; and who, &s;eeing no hope of payment from his con&s;tant irregularities, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the premi&s;es, which he di&s;po&s;ed of as his own, in April, 1774.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Whiffeld, by publi&s;hing the following adverti&s;ement, expo&s;ed to the whole town of Lewes, the de&s;perate &s;tate of his debtor's circum&s;tances: <Q>To be &s;old by auction, on Thur&s;day the 14th of April, and following day, all the hou&s;ehold furniture, &s;tock in trade, and other effects, of Thomas Pain, grocer and tobac|coni&s;t, near the We&s;t Gate, in Lewes: Al&s;o, a hor&s;e-tobacco and &s;nuff-mill, with all the uten&s;ils for cutting of tobacco and grinding of &s;nuff; and two unopened crates of cream-coloured &s;tone ware.</Q></NOTE> The other creditors, thinking them&s;elves outwitted by Whiffeld and cheated by Pain, let loo&s;e the terriers of the law upon him. Like other hunted animals, our author run for refuge to the Whitehart-inn, in the cock-loft of which he lay, without bedding, and but for the female &s;ervant, had been without food, till Sunday &s;et him free. Alas! how often do men enjoy the greate&s;t benefits from the in&s;titutions of religion and the rules of &s;ociety, without reflecting, that in the fir&s;t alone is their hope, in the &s;econd only is their &s;afety!</P>

had for &s;ome time beheld him dealing as a grocer in exci&s;eable articles, as a grinder of &s;nuff, buying &s;muggled tobacco; at others conniving, in order to conceal him&s;elf. He was therefore di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the exci&s;e after a dozen years' &s;ervice, in April, 1774. He petitioned for re&s;toration: but, &s;uch was his notoriou&s;ne&s;s, that his patron was unable to protect him.</P>
<P>What had been &s;een at Sandwich of his conjugal tyranny, was ere long ob&s;erved at Lewes. Such was the meekne&s;s of his wife, that &s;he &s;uffered patiently: but as his embarra&s;&s;ments did not mollify a temper, which is from nature har&s;h; as his &s;ubordination to others did not &s;often his treatment of inferiors; from neglect of his wife, he proceeded to con|tumely; from contumely he went on to cruelty; when, being no longer able to &s;upport his repeated beatings, &s;he complained to her friends. She, at length, told, that at the end of three and a half year's cohabitation, their marriage had never been con&s;ummated. It now became a que&s;tion among the men, and among the women of Lewes, what could be the cau&s;e, that in &s;o long a period, he had not performed the promi&s;e, which is &s;o emphatically enforced in the connubial ceremony; whether it could be owing to natural imbecility, or to philo&s;ophical indifference. In the mid&s;t of this di&s;qui&s;ition, our author had the dignity, or the mean|ne&s;s, to &s;ubmit to the in&s;pection of the faculty; and Mr. Manning, a very &s;kilful &s;urgeon of Lewes, reported, that he &s;aw apparent ability. Our author &s;aid him&s;elf, <Q>that he married for prudential rea&s;ons, and ab&s;tained for prudential rea&s;ons.</Q> Alas! are the rights of men, the boa&s;t of the new philo&s;ophy, to &s;ub&s;i&s;t thus in per&s;onal convenience, which di&s;regards &s;olemn engagements, and contemns the rights of others! On the 24th of May, 1774, Pain and his wife entered into articles of &s;eparation, which were &s;kilfully drawn by Mr. Jo&s;iah Smith, a re&s;pecta|ble attorney of Lewes; &s;he engaging to pay her hu&s;band thirty-five pounds; and he promi&s;ing to claim no part of whatever goods &s;he might gain in future.</P>
<P>Our author immediately hid him&s;elf in the ob&s;curities of London. But though he was un&s;een, he was not inactive: he contrived to di&s;cover his wife's retreat in the hou&s;e of her benevolent brother, who, though he had di&s;approved her marriage, now &s;heltered her di&s;tre&s;s. The hu&s;band found no difficulty in di&s;quieting the wife's repo&s;e. He di&s;puted the articles of &s;eparation, which he had recently executed with &s;uch &s;olem|nity. The occa&s;ion gave ri&s;e to a que&s;tion among the civilians, who are mo&s;t conver&s;ant in matrimonial matters, whether this marriage were not void, <HI>ab initio.</HI> They thought clearly, that natural imbecility had an|nulled the connubial tie; but they doubted, whether malicious impotence amounted to habitual deficiency, though it was doubtle&s;s a &s;ufficient cau&s;e for a divorce, <HI>a men&s;o et thoro.</HI> The common lawyers, who con&s;ider marriage merely as a contract, held the <HI>bad faith</HI> of the hu&s;band, in refu&s;ing to perform what he had &s;olemnly &s;tipulated, to have ab&s;olutely vitiated the original agreement. Amid&s;t the&s;e doubts and difficulties, on the 4th of June, 1774, the hu&s;band and wife entered into new articles of &s;eparation, which amounted to a declaration on his part, <HI>that he no longer found a wife a convenience;</HI> and on her part, <HI>that &s;he had too long &s;uffered the mi&s;eries of &s;uch a hu&s;band.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="030178_0012_0FE4BF3C31BCB638">Neither the bankruptcy, nor di&s;mi&s;&s;al from office, nor &s;eparation from his wife, weakened our author's intere&s;t with the late George Lewis Scott, who had been appointed a commi&s;&s;ioner of exci&s;e in 1758; and who, having been fir&s;t attracted by <HI>the ca&s;e</HI> of the exci&s;emen, was after|wards captivated by the &s;oftne&s;s of his manner, which concealed the har&s;hne&s;s of his &s;pirit. When his patron, who&s;e literature is remember|ed, while his benevolence is forgotten, could not, for the third time, ob|tain our author's re&s;toration as an officer of exci&s;e, he recommended him &s;trongly to that great man Dr. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, as a per&s;on who could, at that epoch, be u&s;eful in America. The Doctor having recently felt the mortification of di&s;mi&s;&s;al him&s;elf, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a philo&s;opher who was &s;oftened by his &s;uffering. But the Doctor's heart was now contracted by age. His knowledge of political life made him con&s;ider confidence as the virtue of infancy: and he was di&s;plea&s;ed with his old acquaintance, for recommending <HI>&s;uch a character</HI> to his notice. Our author had, however, re&s;olved to renounce his country, &s;ince his country had &s;o often frowned on him: and in September, 1774, he &s;et &s;ail for America, where tumult then reigned triumphant; where the bu&s;y might find em|ployment, and the idle a&s;&s;ociates; the ba&s;e concealment, and the brave applau&s;e.</P>
<P>Meantime, rumour carried to our author's mother, repre&s;entations of his latter life, which were probably exaggerated by enmity, or mis&s;tated by malice. She certainly felt, that a child's ingratitude is &s;harper than a &s;erpent's tooth. She was almo&s;t di&s;tracted by her feelings; and &s;he regretted, with a woman's &s;ympathy, that the wife, who&s;e character had defied inquiry, and who&s;e amiablene&s;s de&s;erved e&s;teem, &s;hould be tied for life to the wor&s;t of hu&s;bands.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>We &s;ubjoin the following letter from our author's mother to his wife; not only for its own merit, but becau&s;e it a&s;certains his identity and illu&s;trates his character:

<P>Whatever may be the value of this fundamental dogma in theory, or its u&s;e in practice, it was afterwards &s;tolen by the Abb&eacute; Raynal, one of the metaphy&s;ical &s;tate&s;men of the age, who writes hi&s;tory, as men take cathartics, for di&s;charging crudities, and for the plea&s;ure of evacuation.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the Revolution of America, by Abb&eacute; Raynal, p. 33.</NOTE> The Abb&eacute; appears to have been &s;o delighted, when he found it, that he did not con&s;ider the immorality of appropriating as his own what be|longed to another: perhaps he regarded it as one of the rights of men, to adopt kindly what he &s;aw &s;truggling for reception into the republic of letters.

Yet, as there are men who doubt their own exi&s;tence, &s;o were there &s;ceptics who di&s;puted, whether this dogma were a di&s;covery either of Raynal, or of Pain. The doubti&s;ts produced a pa&s;&s;age from an eminent lawyer of the la&s;t century, who wrote with the preci&s;ion of pro&s;e, yet with the neatne&s;s of poetry:

Many months had not elap&s;ed, when our author claimed his profit and his prai&s;e. Neither was this profit much dimini&s;hed, nor this prai&s;e much prevented, by the <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> entitled PLAIN TRUTH, which, as it was ha&s;tily written, was inattentively read; and, as it only taught the dull duty of obedience, was not much heard amid&s;t the ravings of anarchy.</P>

In this &s;train it was, that General Wa&s;hington wrote the following paragraph, when he announced the final determina|tions of the united wi&s;dom of the New World:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was part of the letter which he wrote on the 17th of September, 1787, as pre&s;ident of the grand convention, when he communicated to Congre&s;s the e&s;tab|li&s;hment of a new con&s;titution on new principles.</NOTE>&mdash;<Q>It is obviou&s;ly im|practicable in the federal government of the&s;e States, to &s;ecure all the rights of independent &s;overeignty to each, and yet provide for the intere&s;t and &s;afety of all.

<P><HI>The times that tried men's &s;ouls</HI> (as our author has it) were, in America, the year 1776. When all was done that the pen could do, the &s;word was drawn. But, the fir&s;t on&s;et was unfavourable to the American arms. The troops of Congre&s;s were expelled from Canada in June. They were defeated on Long-I&s;land in Augu&s;t. They evacuated New York in September. They fled from the White Plains in October. And Fort Wa&s;hington, though garri&s;oned by three thou&s;and patriots, was taken by &s;torm on the 16th of November. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e defeats, our author was prompted by his courage, or his zeal, to join the army: but, whether to coun&s;el, to command, or to obey, curio&s;ity could not di&s;cover amid the din of war. It is only certain, that he accompanied the retreat of Wa&s;hington, from Hud&s;on's river to the Delaware. Like Xenophon our author &s;aw, and has recorded <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In <HI>The</HI> CRISIS, N^o. I.&mdash;There is a journal of this retreat in Al. Rem. 1777, p. 28, which was plainly written by Pain.</NOTE> the events of this famous march, which may be likened to the celebrated retreat of the ten thou&s;and. When Wa&s;hington had cro&s;&s;ed the Delaware, he might have exclaimed with Francis, <HI>All is lo&s;t, but our honour.</HI> The Congre&s;s fled. All was di&s;may. Not &s;o our author: he publickly thanked God, that he did not fear: he &s;aw no cau&s;e for fear. He knew well their &s;ituation, and &s;aw his way out of it. He endeavoured, with no incon&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s, to make others &s;ee with his eyes, to in&s;pire others with his confidence. It was with this de&s;ign that he publi&s;hed in the Penn&s;ylvania Journal, on the 19th of December, 1776, <HI>The Cri&s;is,</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Alm.

<P>I entreat you to receive and to expre&s;s to Congre&s;s, the great &s;en&s;ibility with which I felt their frank, noble, and categorical manner of de&s;troying tho&s;e <HI>fal&s;e</HI> and <HI>dangerous</HI> in&s;inuations, which might mi&s;lead ignorant people, and put aims in|to the hands of the common enemy.</P>
<P>To the King, my Ma&s;ter, Sir, no proofs are nece&s;&s;ary to the foundation of a confidence in the firm and con&s;tant adherence of Congre&s;s to the principles of the alliance; but his Maje&s;ty will always behold with plea&s;ure the mea&s;ures which Congre&s;s may take to pre&s;erve inviolate its reputation; and it is from the &s;ame con&s;ideration, I flatter my&s;elf, he will find my repre&s;entations on the 7th of De|cember equally worth his con&s;ideration.</P>

American world &s;oon grew tired of pertne&s;s and recrimination, when it appeared, that again&s;t Deane nothing could be proved.</P>
<P>Our author's head, being thus &s;horn, of its political honours, was ere long crowned with academic laurels. He was made <HI>ma&s;ter of arts</HI> by the univer&s;ity of Penn&s;ylvania, after the tumult of the times had <HI>driven</HI> his old antagoni&s;t, <HI>the pre&s;ident,</HI> away. He was cho&s;en a member of the American Philo&s;ophical Society, when it was revived by the Penn&s;ylvania Legi&s;lature, in 1780; and when our author had him&s;elf the &s;atisfaction of &s;igning the act of revival, as clerk of the General A&s;&s;embly. He had the comfort of knowing, that though he had made enemies by his petulance, he had gained friends by his patrioti&s;m. And when the Congre&s;s had rejected him, as unworthy of tru&s;t, the A&s;&s;embly of Penn&s;ylvania, being purged of Quakers by his pen, thought him fit for its clerk.</P>
<P>But though the Congre&s;s had wholly rejected our author, he did not totally reject the Congre&s;s: yet, all that he could write, or others could do, did not prevent the bankruptcy of Congre&s;s, in March, 1780, when the Congre&s;s paper cea&s;ed to circulate. He gave the American citizens, &s;oon after, <HI>A Cri&s;is Extraordinary.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alm. Rem. 1781, Part I. pag. 131.</NOTE> He now recalled to their remem|brance the original principles on which they had re&s;i&s;ted: he endeavoured to convince them of their direct advantage in defending the country: he compared the re&s;ources of the contending parties; leaving the balance, by an ea&s;y calculation, in favour of his friends: and he laid before them a glowing picture, containing every motive, which could cheer the hearts, or engage the honour of a patriot people; which could make them feel <HI>the line of their intere&s;t</HI> to be <HI>the line of their happine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But their ears were callous to the voice of the charmer. The pen had, however, cea&s;ed to influence, during the clamour of contention, the in|trigues of cabal, and the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of war. While the American citizens denied &s;upplies to the cries of Congre&s;s, they &s;ullenly determined, to &s;uf|fer the mi&s;eries of ho&s;tility, till the acknowledgment of independence &s;hould make them happy. Our author cheered them from time to time with another <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> till his <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> becoming common, was no longer a Cri&s;is; and was therefore read without attention, and thrown away with|out efficacy.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Penn&s;yl.

<P>In Augu&s;t, 1782, our author reclaimed his property, by a <HI>letter to the Abb&eacute; Raynal on the affairs of North America.</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">This publication gave our author's old antagoni&s;t, <HI>the pre&s;ident,</HI> an opportunity of &s;neering at his <HI>illiterature.</HI> Here is a letter written to an Abb&eacute;, &s;aid he, who is treated in it throughout as a third per&s;on. "The greater part of the Abb&eacute;'s wri|tings <HI>appear to me</HI> UNCENTRAL." [P. 51.] Appear to me to be <HI>eccentric,</HI> the author probably intended. "It is <HI>a u&s;eful</HI> addition."

A bat|tle of words was carried on through many pages, which, like other con|te&s;ts of the metaphy&s;icians, had &s;ooner forced conviction, or had been continued without logomachy, if the di&s;putants had only explained their own terms. The Abb&eacute; meant to &s;ay, that, in fact, the blood of no martyr had been &s;hed; no patriot had hung on the &s;caffold; no American citizen had been dragged to a dungeon; all which had been the energetic cau&s;es of revolutions in the European world. Again&s;t the fact our au|thor quoted <HI>the declaratory act,</HI> which left the Colonies <HI>no rights</HI> at all: by it, the blood of martyrs was &s;hed <HI>virtually:</HI> patriots were hanged <HI>virtu|ally;</HI> citizens were dragged to dungeons <HI>virtually.

<P>Our author turned a while from the Abb&eacute;, to teach America and Eu|rope the nature of <HI>paper money.</HI> In five years, the Congre&s;s i&s;&s;ued about twelve millions &s;terling, in dollars of pa&s;teboard. This emi&s;&s;ion of paper, was a corner-&s;tone of independence. It was the Congre&s;s mode of finance, which, while it prevailed, &s;aved twelve millions of taxes for carrying on the war; and con&s;equently, the event to the people was exactly the &s;ame, whether they &s;unk twelve millions of money, by the depreciation of paper, or paid twelve millions by taxation. As early as March, 1780, common con&s;ent con&s;igned it to re&s;t, with that kind of regard, which the long &s;ervices of inanimate beings in&s;en&s;ibly obtain from mankind. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter to Raynal, p. 22, 23.</NOTE> Our author's addre&s;s is admirable, in mentioning every circum&s;tance of commendation, while he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed every kind of objection. He concealed, that the Congre&s;s made their pa&s;teboards a legal payment of every debt, though they were of no more value than <HI>the almanacks of the la&s;t year.</HI> The fraudulent were thus enabled to pay the hone&s;t their ju&s;t debts with wa&s;te paper. The rich were thereby defrauded, but the poor were not enriched. All prop|erty and all labour were depreciated by the &s;ame &s;troke of fraud. A tran&s;action, which &s;o violently &s;hook the intere&s;t and happine&s;s of a coun|try, has &s;eldom occurred before. The Abb&eacute; was &s;o &s;imple as to con&s;ider this di&s;credited paper as an e&s;&s;ential part of the Congre&s;s debt. Not &s;o our author: with a charming apathy he a&s;&s;erted, in 1782, <HI>with us its fate is now determined.</HI> This is a fine illu&s;tration of the maxims and prac|tice of the metaphy&s;ical reformers, who care not, when in pur&s;uit of their theories, who&s;e heart they rend, who&s;e property they wa&s;te, who&s;e &s;afety they endanger.</P>
<P>Our author was more happy, though not more grammatical, in &s;hew|ing, that the Abb&eacute;, as an hi&s;torian, ha&s;tens through his narrations as <HI>if he was glad</HI> to get from them.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter, p. 12.</NOTE> It mu&s;t be allowed to be true, as our author a&s;&s;erted,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter, p. 2.</NOTE> that it is yet too &s;oon to write the hi&s;tory of the Revo|lution; and whoever attempts it precipitately will unavoidably mi&s;take characters and circum&s;tances, and involve him&s;elf in error and difficulty: yet is it never too &s;oon to inculcate on nations the performance of con|tracts, or on individuals the practice of hone&s;ty, becau&s;e both form the &s;tronge&s;t cement of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Our author had &s;carcely di&s;patched his letter to Abb&eacute; Raynal, when he wrote an epi&s;tle to the Earl of Shelburne.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">A letter to the Earl of Shelburne, which was publi&s;hed at Philadelphia, the 29th of October, 1782, on his &s;peech of the 10th of July, 1782.</NOTE> The noble Earl had &s;aid in Parliament, it &s;eems, in a tone which &s;till vibrates in the ears of Engli&s;h|men, <HI>that when Great-Britain &s;hall acknowledge American independence,

the &s;un of Britain's glory is &s;et forever.</HI> Some other orator had al&s;o &s;aid, in &s;ome other hou&s;e, <HI>What is the relinqui&s;hment of America but to de&s;ire a giant to &s;hrink &s;pontaneou&s;ly into a dwarf?</HI> Our author rea&s;ons and laughs, and laughs and rea&s;ons with our Parliamentary Prophets, through a little pamphlet of eight and twenty pages. It required not his ridicule to make folly ridiculous, his acutene&s;s to detect &s;ophi&s;try, or his ability to overturn weakne&s;s. We have outlived the time; yet many a parliamentary proph|ecy is &s;till unfulfilled. Great-Britain continues to walk with a <HI>giant</HI>'s port among the powers of the earth, even without the help of the Earl's energy.</P>
<P>Our author publi&s;hed his <HI>la&s;t Cri&s;is,</HI> on the 19th of April, 1783, the &s;ame day that a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities was proclaimed. This e&s;&s;ay was &s;oon printed as a pamphlet, entitled <HI>Pain's Thoughts on the Peace.</HI> In eighteen pages, he concluded his valedictory oration in the following &s;entence: <HI>Now, Gentlemen, you are independent; &s;it down, and be happy.</HI> But, hap|pine&s;s is not always in our own power. Without food, and raiment, and &s;helter, what man, except Diogenes, ever was happy? When their re|joicings were over, the American citizens were all &s;urpri&s;ed, that they were not happy. Amid&s;t di&s;tru&s;t, and penury, and pride, and indolence, what happine&s;s, alas! could they enjoy? They were all di&s;appointed in their hopes; they were all exhau&s;ted in their fortunes; they were all &s;u&s;|picious in their tempers; they were all unea&s;y in their families; but, they were independent. In all this <HI>wailing and gna&s;hing of teeth,</HI> our author&mdash;
<Q>"Found nothing left but poverty and prai&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>The American Revolution is a happy in&s;tance of what may be done by metaphy&s;ical reformers, who run furiou&s;ly forward, in pur&s;uit of their theories, without <HI>regarding the end.</HI> In order to obtain independence, every principle, which ought to actuate the human heart, was weakened; all the maxims, which knit &s;ociety together, were impugned, and gov|ernment, which is the efficacious energy of political unions, was con|temned as <HI>an evil.</HI> But, independence was obtained. Subordination however cea&s;ed; ju&s;tice fled from the land; freedom, and property, and life, were no longer &s;afe; the A&s;&s;ociation among the States di&s;&s;olved in its own in&s;ufficience; and the Congre&s;s continued to exi&s;t indeed, but di&s;|graced by its impotence, and unavailing in its efforts. Meantime, Shays' rebellion raged for years in New-England, the mo&s;t vigorous of the American Republics. Civil di&s;cord di&s;tracted New-York. In&s;urrection di&s;turbed the quiet of Philadelphia, which had once been the happy &s;eat of concord and diligence; from which our author retired to Bordenton, in New-Jer&s;ey, for &s;helter. The Southern States were all &s;haken, by &s;im|ilar di&s;orders, owing to &s;imilar cau&s;es. The American Union was little re&s;pected in Europe. The American Citizens were di&s;tru&s;ted naturally by foreigners, when they di&s;tru&s;ted one another. They were con&s;idered as a people, who were doomed to di&s;traction; to &s;uffer the mi&s;eries of anarchy, till they &s;hould acknowledge by their conduct, that they rejected meta|phy&s;ical theories, and regarded ju&s;t government as the greate&s;t good.</P>
<P>Whether our author &s;miled at the mi&s;chief, which his pen had done, or lamented that his pre&s;criptions had not produced happine&s;s, it is im|po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="25" REF="030178_0024_0FE4BF5017BDE568">
to tell. He &s;eems to have been &s;ilent, becau&s;e, during the up|roar of anarchy, even <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> could not be heard. He certainly &s;uffered all the mi&s;eries of dependent penury. He bu&s;ied him&s;elf for &s;everal years, in &s;oliciting the American A&s;&s;emblies to grant him &s;ome reward, for having contributed by his labours to make the American Citizens independent, and mi&s;erable. New-York conferred on him for|feited lands at New Rochelle, which, as they were neither tenanted nor cultivated, brought him no annual income. Penn&s;ylvania gave him five hundred pounds; which, at &s;ix per cent. may be con&s;idered as a pen&s;ion of thirty pounds a year, current money, or eighteen pounds &s;terling; and thus were united, what he had anxiou&s;ly wi&s;hed to avoid, <HI>pen&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Pain</HI> in the &s;ame paragraph.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Maryland Journal, dated the 31&s;t of December, 1784, there is the fol|lowing article: "On the 6th in&s;tant, his Excellency John Dicken&s;on, Pre&s;ident of the State of Penn&s;ylvania, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the A&s;&s;embly re&s;pecting Mr. Thomas Pain, the author of Common Sen&s;e and other political pieces; &s;trongly recommending to their notice his &s;ervices and &s;ituation; and concluding in the &s;ub&s;equent words:&mdash;We confide that you will then feel that the attention of Penn|&s;ylvania is drawn towards Mr. Pain, by motives equally grateful to the human heart, and reputable to the republic; and that you will join with us in opinion, that a &s;uitable acknowledgment of his eminent &s;ervices, and a proper provi&s;ion for the continuance of them in an independent manner, &s;hould be made on the part of this State."</NOTE> Whether any other of the States, or the Congre&s;s, relieved our author's needs, we have never heard. They were all poor, and unable to help them&s;elves, di&s;tracted as they were by their maxims, and enfeebled in their powers. As his principles and his pen were no longer of much u&s;e to the United States, our author departed for France, in autumn of 1786; leaving the American Citizens to build up, as they could, the &s;everal fabrics, which he had contributed &s;o pow|erfully to overturn. They all experienced, after his departure, that it is more ea&s;y to break windows than to mend them.</P>
<P>What writers on government &s;uppo&s;e to have happened in the darke&s;t periods, when men exi&s;ted as &s;avages, actually occurred, in America, dur|ing September, 1787. Three millions of people, who were urged by their mi&s;eries, a&s;&s;embled at Philadelphia, not indeed in per&s;on, but by dele|gates, to con&s;ider their pre&s;ent calamities, and provide for their future happine&s;s. When the&s;e deputies met in <HI>Convention,</HI> with Wa&s;hington at their head, they did not begin their deliberations, by reading our author's <HI>Common Sen&s;e.</HI> All had &s;een the people's &s;ufferings. Like the meta|phy&s;ical &s;tate&s;men of the old world, they did not deny the evidence of their own &s;en&s;es. But, con&s;idering the general mi&s;ery as <HI>a fact,</HI> they proceeded to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;e of that <HI>fact,</HI> which could not be di&s;puted. By running furiou&s;ly in que&s;t of private liberty and of public independence, the people, &s;aid they, have involved them&s;elves in anarchy, and the States in imbecility. WE con&s;ider then, &s;aid the Convention and Wa&s;h|ington, &s;elf-legi&s;lation, or anarchy, as the efficient cau&s;e of all our ills. WE mu&s;t remove <HI>the cau&s;e</HI> before we attempt to free the people from <HI>its effects.</HI> WE mu&s;t put <HI>re&s;traints</HI> upon <HI>&s;elf-legi&s;lation,</HI> upon <HI>&s;elf-actions,</HI> upon <HI>&s;elf-redre&s;s.</HI> WE mu&s;t &s;acrifice the principles, the pa&s;&s;ions, the prejudices, of <HI>one</HI> to the &s;afety of <HI>millions.</HI> WE mu&s;t <HI>re&s;train</HI> the <HI>liberty</HI> of <HI>each,</HI> in order that the <HI>whole</HI> may be <HI>free.</HI> WE mu&s;t, in this manner,

e&s;tabli&s;h <HI>re&s;traint</HI> as the fundamental principle of <HI>the Society,</HI> into which we are about to enter. WE mu&s;t lay <HI>re&s;traint</HI> as the <HI>corner-&s;tone</HI> of our <HI>New Con&s;titution.</HI></P>
<P>In that numerous Convention, there were men of republican principles, who, with our author's <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> in their hands, and their own im|portance in their heads, &s;poke a very different language. With our la&s;t breath, &s;aid they, WE will retain <HI>&s;elf-legi&s;lation,</HI> that inherent right of man to <HI>will</HI> for him&s;elf; becau&s;e, where there is no <HI>&s;elf-will,</HI> there can be no <HI>liberty.</HI> WE would as &s;oon relinqui&s;h life it&s;elf, as part with <HI>&s;elf-action;</HI> becau&s;e what are freemen, if they cannot <HI>do as they plea&s;e?</HI> WE will never agree to be re&s;trained, they exclaimed, becau&s;e <HI>re&s;traint</HI> is the <HI>death</HI> of <HI>liberty.</HI></P>
<P>In reply to the&s;e declamations, the Convention and Wa&s;hington argued very patiently. Remember, WE pray you, the people's mi&s;eries, and the people's cries; you have &s;een, that it is <HI>&s;elf-legi&s;lation,</HI> or the power of willing as each thinks proper, which is the real cau&s;e of all their &s;ufferings: <HI>&s;elf-action,</HI> or the <HI>practice</HI> of doing what each thinks fit, is the genuine effect of that efficient cau&s;e: have you not felt how the young abu&s;e the old; how the &s;trong overpower the weak; how the wicked oppre&s;s the virtuous: can you enjoy your own liberty where &s;uch abu&s;es exi&s;t, and where all legi&s;late and none obey? If you wi&s;h to be &s;afe, you mu&s;t relinqui&s;h this <HI>&s;avagene&s;s</HI> for <HI>&s;ociety:</HI> now, what is &s;ociety, but a compact, either expre&s;&s;ed, or under&s;tood, that private will &s;hall &s;ubmit to public will; that individual action &s;hall be &s;ubordinate to general direction; that no <HI>one</HI> &s;hall <HI>will</HI> or <HI>do</HI> any action, which is incon&s;i&s;t|ent with the rules and agency of the many: and what is this &s;ubordi|nation and this obedience but re&s;traint, that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the foundation of &s;ociety, which has been variou&s;ly modified in different climes, as men were urged by their various &s;ufferings?</P>
<P>The few in this Convention were, in this manner, obliged to &s;ubmit to the wills, and what is of more importance, to the rea&s;ons of the many. And the Convention and Wa&s;hington proceeded to form their compact, which is the record of their union; to e&s;tabli&s;h their con&s;titution, which is the detail of its end; and to &s;ettle their government, which is the means of effectuating <HI>the end</HI> of <HI>their union.</HI> Upon the&s;e rea&s;onings they acted, though they were not unanimous. And finding it impracticable to &s;ecure, either to individuals or communities, dependence and inde|pendence, &s;ubordination and &s;overeignty, they modified their &s;y&s;tem, &s;o as be&s;t to provide for the intere&s;t and &s;afety of all.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Wa&s;hington's Letter before mentioned.</NOTE> Hi&s;tory will record it as an indubitable proof of their wi&s;dom, that they built as much as po&s;&s;ible upon old foundations; pre&s;erving their old common law, their old acts of a&s;&s;embly, their old modes of public proceeding. It deducts, indeed, &s;omething from this commendation, that the metaphy&s;ical re|formers, with our author as their in&s;tructor, are more active to pull down than to build; are more &s;tudious to recommend new theories than to act on old experience.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have &s;urveyed the regions of the earth mu&s;t have every where &s;een &s;ocieties of &s;ome kind, who&s;e forms would no doubt be modi|fied,

by their ignorance, into greater &s;implicity, or by their civilization, into more numerous checks. The Convention and Wa&s;hington maturely con&s;idered all tho&s;e varieties; and that great juri&s;t, Mr. John Adams, had in&s;pected every book, in every language, that he might lay before them the beauties and defects of the different governments, which had re&s;ulted from ancient wi&s;dom and modern experience. After this inquiry, and tho&s;e con&s;iderations, the united wi&s;dom of the new world adopted, as far as circum&s;tances would allow, the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, though our author's <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> had declared it <HI>to be a farce.</HI> The American con|&s;titution, which was then e&s;tabli&s;hed, provided powers legi&s;lative, execu|tive, and judicial. The legi&s;lative, which, as the &s;overeign has the power of pre&s;cribing rules of action for all, con&s;i&s;ts of the Hou&s;e of Rep|re&s;entatives, or Commons; of a Senate, or Peers; of the Pre&s;ident, or King; who have each a vote in the making of laws. The executive power is ve&s;ted in the Pre&s;ident, with monarchical authority, who is entru&s;ted with the whole energy of government. The judicial power is thrown into &s;eparate departments, which di&s;tribute ju&s;tice in the various di&s;tricts that a wide country, and a &s;cattered people, require. Now, this is the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, though it be le&s;s efficient, becau&s;e the materi|als were le&s;s perfect; and though it be more complex, becau&s;e circum|&s;tances required additional checks.</P>
<P>In this manner, and upon tho&s;e principles, was &s;ettled the pre&s;ent American government, which has an&s;wered in practice beyond expecta|tion. It is of importance to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;es of that e&s;tabli&s;hment and of that efficiency. Our author, who had inculcated by his <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 8.</NOTE> <HI>that no power which needs checking can be from God,</HI> was now fortunately ab&s;ent. Sad di&s;tre&s;s had induced the people to plain truth; they had no longer a di&s;po&s;ition to believe our author's doctrine, that <HI>the be&s;t government is a nece&s;&s;ary evil;</HI> and recent experience had fully convinced them that there can be no &s;ecurity for property, freedom, and life, unle&s;s re&s;traint be impo&s;ed by the laws, and government be obeyed, as the energy from which &s;ocial happine&s;s can alone be enjoyed.</P>
<P>Mean time, our author &s;afely arrived in Paris, the beginning of 1787. He carried with him his fame as a writer, and the model of a bridge, which &s;hewed that he had a genius, equally formed for mechanics, as for politics. The French academy viewed his model, and thanked him for the &s;ight; but whether he gave the people of France, <HI>who were than be|ginning to think for them&s;elves,</HI> a le&s;&s;on or two of political happine&s;s, we have never heard. Were we allowed to argue from experience, it might be ea&s;ily proved, that &s;ince the epoch of his vi&s;it, the French have pro|ceeded regularly,

<P>Our author, like other animals who delight in &s;avage life, longed to return to his old haunts. And he arrived at the White Bear, Piccadilly, on the 3d of September, 1787, ju&s;t thirteen years after his departure for Philadelphia. Neither the length of time, nor the change of circum|&s;tances, prevented his former acquaintances from recognizing the &s;pecific

&s;taymaker, the individual grocer, the &s;ame exci&s;eman; but as he had taken French leave, he met &s;ome <HI>old friends</HI> with <HI>new faces.</HI> In London, he did not remain long. Before the end of September he ha&s;tened to Thetford, where he found his mother, who was now advanced to the age of ninety, but oppre&s;&s;ed by penury. At the era of rejoicing for in|dependence, this dutiful &s;on had remitted his nece&s;&s;itous parents twenty pounds, in payment, no doubt, of the money, which had been lent him on bond,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his mother's letter before, p. 13.</NOTE> before his emigration. He now talked of allowing his moth|er nine &s;hillings a week, to be paid by White&s;ide, an American mer|chant, in London. But owing to the confu&s;ion in that trader's affairs, or to &s;ome other cau&s;e, this allowance was &s;oon &s;topt. At Thetford, he &s;eldom &s;aw the <HI>companions of his youth;</HI> he went little out, being wholly occupied in reading and in writing. He who has once been employed in great affairs cannot ea&s;ily conde&s;cend to conver&s;e with puny men, or look, with gratification, on little matters.</P>
<P>When our author had fini&s;hed his reading and his writing at Thetford, he returned to London: and before the end of the year 1787, he pub|li&s;hed his <HI>Pro&s;pects on the Rubicon;</HI> or, <HI>an Inve&s;tigation into the Cau&s;es and Con&s;equences of the Politics to be agitated at the Meeting of Parliament.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The critics a&s;certained the author&s;hip by collation of the &s;tyle. Thus, in page 59 of his <HI>Pro&s;pects,</HI> it is &s;aid, "there is <HI>a</HI> uniformity in all the works of nature." "But there is another circum&s;tance that <HI>do</HI> not fail to impre&s;s foreigners," page 63. "Where is the profit of manufactures, if there is [be] no increa&s;e of money," page 39. "But it &s;ignifies not what name it bears, <HI>if</HI> the capital is [be] not equal to the redemption," p. 35. The amazing increa&s;e <HI>and</HI> magnitude of the paper currency now floating in England, expo&s;es her to a &s;hock as much more tremendous than the &s;hock of the South Sea Funds, as the quantity of credit <HI>and</HI> paper currency <HI>is</HI> now greater than <HI>they</HI> were at that time," p. 24. "But though Democrites [Democritus] could &s;carcely have forbore [forborn] laughing [laugh|ter] at the folly." p. 2.</NOTE> This is an octavo tract of &s;ixty-eight pages, which treats of <HI>the &s;tate of the nation.</HI> The affairs of Holland which were then un&s;ettled, are now a &s;ubject for hi&s;tory, who&s;e pen will do ju&s;tice to the conductors of a great tran&s;action to a happy end. Be&s;ide temporary matters, our au|thor gave his opinion of money, credit, and banking, of agriculture and manufacture, of commerce and &s;hipping: but, by remaining too long in America, he had allowed Dr. Adam Smith to occupy his ground, to fore&s;tal his thoughts, and to teach the people not to be terrified by any pen&s;ioned pamphleteer. Our author's <HI>Pro&s;pects</HI> &s;oon faded from the public eye. And the news-papers had the <HI>impertinence</HI> to tell him, that he who had lately &s;hewn America the road to independence, and now endeavoured to exalt France over England, was a fit &s;ubject for tran&s;por|tation to the one, or a proper object <HI>&agrave; la lanterne</HI> of the other.</P>
<P>During the year 1788, our author was chiefly occupied in building his bridge. For this end he made a journey to Rotheram, in York&s;hire, in order to &s;uperintend the ca&s;ting of the iron, by that ingenious man and re&s;pectable citizen Mr. Walker. While thus occupied at Rotheram, our author's French freedom is &s;aid not to have much plea&s;ed the Engli&s;h ladies. Their di&s;plea&s;ure did not, however, prevent the operations of the furnace; and the bridge was at length erected, in a clo&s;e at Lea&s;ing-Green;
<PB REF="030178_0028_0FE4BEE60A254658">
being an arch con&s;tructed of iron, one hundred and ten feet in the &s;pan. five feet from the &s;pring, and twenty-two feet in breadth. It was erected chiefly at the charge of Mr. Walker; but the project had co&s;t our author a large &s;um, which was mo&s;tly furni&s;hed by Mr. White&s;ide, the American merchant, who &s;oon di&s;covered, that <HI>advances</HI> without <HI>returns</HI> leave the trader, ere long, without money or credit. Our author's bridge is to this day &s;hewn at the York&s;hire-Stingo, for a &s;hilling. As this was not the fir&s;t iron bridge which was known to the Engli&s;h world, it is not ea&s;y to di&s;cover, why the projector, who had a model, &s;hould in|cur &s;o great an expen&s;e merely to make a &s;how.</P>
<P>It is, however, happy for mankind, that imprudence and folly &s;eldom e&s;cape puni&s;hment. White&s;ide, by tru&s;ting much money in bad hands, &s;oon became a bankrupt. The a&s;&s;ignees, &s;eeing &s;o great a &s;um as &s;ix hundred and twenty pounds charged again&s;t our author, cau&s;ed him to be arre&s;ted on the 29th of October, 1789, at the White Bear, in Piccadilly. He was carried to that commodious &s;punging hou&s;e, which is kept by good Mr. Arm&s;trong in Cary-&s;treet. Here he lay, for three weeks, <HI>in durance vile.</HI> Tho&s;e benevolent per&s;ons, Benjamin Vaughan, Mr. Hoare the Quaker, and William Vaughan, all intere&s;ted them&s;elves in his fate. They a&s;ked the a&s;&s;ignees, if they knew that they confined the <HI>great writer</HI> of <HI>Common Sen&s;e.</HI> Our concern, &s;aid the creditors, is not with the dignity, but the identity of the debtor: Will you be his &s;ecurity, to obtain his freedom? Upon the departure of his vi&s;itors, without ob|taining his liberty, our author is &s;aid to have hummed&mdash;
<Q><L>&mdash;"They promi&s;e to pity;</L>

He now applied to Me&s;&s;rs. Clegge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Murdock, two American traders of great re&s;pectability; pleading his &s;ervices to them as Americans, in giving them independence. Without con&s;idering them&s;elves as much obliged to him for confining rather than enlarging their trade, they be|came his bail. And our author, paying four hundred and &s;ixty pounds, which he had at length received from America, and giving his own note for one hundred and &s;ixty more, was &s;et free, in November, 1789, to pur&s;ue his projects, and to &s;cribble pamphlets.</P>
<P>While thus re&s;trained in Cary-&s;treet, by a power which he had never au|thorized, our adventurer was not inattentive to French affairs. In France he had beheld the fair blo&s;&s;oms of liberty in the genial Spring; he had &s;een the vigorous &s;hoots of Summer's invigoration; and he now ha&s;tened to that happy land, in order to partake in the autumnal maturity of the faire&s;t fruit, that metaphy&s;icians had ever cultivated in the fields of theory. While thus gratified, by enjoying the harve&s;t of his own labours, he had the additional plea&s;ure of peru&s;ing Dr. Price's celebrated &s;ermon, which had been frowned from England, into France. But, while he &s;aw the people of France <HI>thinking</HI> and <HI>acting</HI> for them&s;elves, he heard with a&s;ton|i&s;hment, no doubt, <HI>that the people of England were about to re&s;ign the prerogative of thinking.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pro&s;pects on the Rubicon, p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE></P>

as he ran to London, by Mr. Burke's pamphlet, which was publi&s;hed a few days before the &s;ad celebration of the French Revolution, on the 5th of November, 1790. He may have heard indeed, what doubtle&s;s quickened his &s;teps, that &s;uch a work was in the pre&s;s, and though long delayed, was at length to appear. Never was the public expectation more amply gratified. Such vigour from &s;ixty-three the world had &s;eldom &s;een. Thou&s;ands and tens of thou&s;ands of Mr. Burke's pamphlet were &s;old, without the recommendation of the Con&s;titutional Society. But, it was not the wi&s;dom of his policy, or the zeal of his patrioti&s;m, the learning of his illu&s;trations, or the bur&s;ts of his eloquence which captivated the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> nation. No: the univer&s;al applau&s;e of the Engli&s;h people, was an indubitable proof of their genuine &s;entiments: It was a declaration of their affection for the king; of their attachment to the con&s;titution; of their veneration for the laws; of gratitude to their fathers, who had tran&s;mitted the &s;y&s;tem, which en&s;ures to them their pre&s;ent happine&s;s. To Mr. Burke's pamphlet, every week pro|duced a new an&s;wer. But, as his antagoni&s;ts fought him on his own ground of law, their aims were feebly directed, and their attacks were ea&s;ily repul&s;ed. The metaphy&s;ical &s;tate&s;men cried out for a new a&s;&s;ault, upon a fre&s;h field, by di&s;&s;imilar weapons, according to the approved tac|tics of wordy warfare.</P>
<P>In this manner was our author induced to furbi&s;h up his old weapons of <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> to fa&s;hion <HI>his Cri&s;is,</HI> ordinary and extraordinary, into a new cuira&s;s, to review <HI>his Pro&s;pects,</HI> that he might take the <HI>vantage ground</HI> to
<Q><L>"Decide all controver&s;ies by</L>
<L>Infallible artillery."</L></Q></P>
<P>A few months' labour produced the far-famed pamphlet, yclepp'd <HI>Rights of Man.</HI> It was &s;ubmitted to the revi&s;al of Mr. Brand Hollis, and a committee of <HI>Democrats.</HI> It was fitted by them for the pre&s;s, after &s;ome &s;truggles, between the de&s;ires of the author, and the wi&s;hes of his patrons. It was printed in February, 1791, for that worthy citizen, Mr. J. John&s;on, in St. Paul's Church-yard; but his regard for <HI>the &s;hop</HI> induced him to decline the &s;elling of prohibited goods, though he occa&s;ionally dealt in Dr. Prie&s;tly's wares. This unexpected refu&s;al cau&s;ed a month's delay. A few copies were, however, &s;muggled into private hands. Im|patience was now apparent on every face. The de&s;ire of gratification became, as u&s;ual, more ardent, in proportion, as the object was denied. The men-midwives determined to deprive the child of its virility, rather than &s;o hopeful an infant &s;hould be withheld from the world. At length, on the 13th of March, 1791, this mutilated brat was delivered to the public, by Mr. J. S. Jordan, at N^o 166, Fleet-&s;treet.</P>
<P>To the parent this was a moment of peculiar anxiety. Be&s;ide his cares for his child, he feared that the me&s;&s;engers of the pre&s;s might be even then prowling for their prey. He found &s;helter and concealment in the ho&s;pitable hou&s;e of the &s;aid Mr. Hollis; and in order to carry the hounds from their &s;cent, the agent of a foreign power ran about whi&s;per|ing in every ear, <HI>that he had la&s;t night given Mr. Pain a pa&s;s for Paris;</HI> though every Engli&s;hman, to whom this tale was told, did not hear with
<PB N="31" REF="030178_0030_0FE4BF519AD0A3A8">
the &s;ame patience, that foreign agents &s;hould trouble them&s;elves with En|gli&s;h affairs. It is hardened guilt only which is never fearful. While concealment was thus &s;tudiou&s;ly con&s;ulted, the me&s;&s;engers of the pre&s;s did not trouble them&s;elves about Mr. Pain or his pamphlet.</P>
<P>Such was the agency by which this production was brought to the notice of the Engli&s;h nation. There were numbers, no doubt, who prai&s;ed it; becau&s;e they wi&s;hed that its tenets were triumphant. There are &s;ome who, in every country, rejoice to &s;ee real learning defied by gro&s;s illiterature. And the Con&s;titutional Society, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to &s;pread con&s;titutional information, &s;trenuou&s;ly recommended this con|&s;titutional tract to the peru&s;al of the people. But it was &s;till to encounter the critics. This is a race of men, who&s;e hearts are generally contracted by years; who&s;e judgments, being matured by experience, are not often captivated by novelty; and who&s;e pens are &s;ometimes dipped in gall, by an exce&s;&s;ive impartiality.</P>
<P>After a decorus procra&s;tination, the critics reviewed our author's per|formance. They divided their &s;trictures into two heads; the manner, and the matter. With regard to <HI>the fir&s;t,</HI> they ob&s;erved, that as the language immediately offers it&s;elf to the reader's eye, and mu&s;t ulti|mately inform the reader's under&s;tanding; &s;o the language is an e&s;&s;ential object of the critic's animadver&s;ion. Of &s;tyle, <HI>per&s;picuity</HI> is the principal quality, without which all other qualities are u&s;ele&s;s; but without <HI>gram|matical purity,</HI> that great e&s;&s;ential of language cannot be obtained. Like fair critics, they gave examples, as the be&s;t proofs of their precepts; and they arranged their ob&s;ervations, and &s;tated their quotations, under di&s;|tinct cla&s;&s;es, in the following order:</P>

In p. 89 Mr. Pain &s;ays hi&s;torically, "That the then Marquis de la Fayette was in clo&s;e friend&s;hip with the civil government of America, as well as with the military line." Private friend&s;hip with a civil government; friend&s;hip with a line!! In p. 81, Mr. Pain remarks, "That the addre&s;&s;es of the Engli&s;h parliaments are not of foreign extraction, but originate from the Norman Conque&s;t: they [the &s;aid addre&s;&s;es] are evidently of the <HI>va&s;&s;alage</HI> cla&s;s of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 82.</NOTE> manners; and," he adds, "that this <HI>va&s;&s;alage</HI> idea <HI>and</HI> &s;tyle of &s;peaking <HI>was</HI> [were] not got rid of in 1688."

<P>The critics clo&s;ed their &s;trictures, with regard to <HI>the manner,</HI> by rec|ommending to Mr. Pain, with more good nature than generally relaxes the brow of critici&s;m, to &s;tudy the Engli&s;h language.

<P>To this elaborate critici&s;m there is a &s;hort an&s;wer. Let the quotations be allowed to be accurate; <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The critics appear to have u&s;ed the genuine edition of John&s;on</NOTE> and an unque&s;tionable fact will furni&s;h a proper reply: the manu&s;cript of <HI>Rights of Man</HI> was revi&s;ed and altered by Mr. Brand Hollis, and a committee of Democrats, as before men|tioned. Now, the Editors, who u&s;e the freedom to change the &s;tyle of their author, are an&s;werable for the con&s;equences. It was unkind al&s;o in the Con&s;titutional Society, formed, as it is, of Doctors of Law, Doc|tors of Divinity, and Doctors of Phy&s;ic, to recommend the <HI>ca&s;trated</HI> edition of Jordan, before they had <HI>tortured the &s;tyle.</HI></P>

<P>In page 48 it is &s;aid, "That the duty of man is not a wilderne&s;s of turnpike gates, through which he is to pa&s;s by tickets <HI>from</HI> one to the other." Here, &s;aid the critics, the author, in attempting to give a &s;pecimen of fine writing, wrote without meaning. In p. 51, "That governments might avail them&s;elves of every engine in their favour, they united fraud to force, and &s;et up an idol, which they called <HI>Di|vine Right;</HI> and which, in imitation of the Pope, who affects to be &s;piritual and temporal, and in contradiction to the founder of the Chri&s;tian religion, twi&s;ted it&s;elf afterwards into an idol of another &s;hape, called <HI>Church and State.</HI>" Here is an in&s;tance of the unintel|ligible, from the length of the &s;entence. In p. 66, Mr. Pain quotes it as a maxim, "<HI>Titles</HI> are but <HI>nicknames,</HI> and every nickname is a <HI>title;</HI>" and he &s;tates it as a <HI>fact,</HI> "That it is properly from the elevated mind of France, that the folly of titles have [has] fallen." This writer is not more happy in his religious opinions; in p. 74, "Toleration is not the <HI>oppo&s;ite</HI> of <HI>intoleration,</HI> but is the <HI>counterfeit</HI> of it. Both are de&s;po|ti&s;ms; the former is church and &s;tate, and the latter is church and traffic." Mr. Pain was thence led on to &s;peak, in page 80, of the <HI>foun|tain of honour:</HI> "In England <HI>a</HI> king is the fountain; but as this idea is evidently from the Conque&s;t, I &s;hall make no other remark upon it, than that it is the nature of conque&s;t to turn every thing up&s;ide down; and as Mr. Burke will not be refu&s;ed the privilege of &s;peaking twice, and as there are but two parts in the figure, the <HI>fountain</HI> and the <HI>&s;pout,</HI> he will be right the &s;econd time." After this <HI>tran&s;parent</HI> elucidation of the <HI>fountain of honour,</HI> he naturally tells, in p. 138, what a <HI>parliament</HI> is: "What is called the parliament, is made up of two hou&s;es; one of which is <HI>more</HI> hereditary, and <HI>more</HI> beyond the control of the nation, than what the crown, (as it called) is &s;uppo&s;ed to be." He goes <HI>beyond</HI> even this, in page 139: "The continual u&s;e of the word <HI>con&s;titution,</HI> in the Engli&s;h parliament, &s;hews there is none; and that the whole [of what] is merely a form of government, without a con&s;titution." As an illu&s;tra|tion of this mode of writing the &s;ublime, the critics quoted the famous couplet of two illu&s;trious poets:
<Q><L>"My wound is <HI>great,</HI> becau&s;e it is &s;o <HI>&s;mall;</HI></L>
<L>It would be <HI>greater,</HI> were it none at all!"</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="030178_0034_0FE4BED7C560E848">Mr. Pain thence de&s;cends to meaner matters, and gives in page 144, a <HI>mathematical e&s;timate</HI> of the quantity of money: "Li&s;bon and Cadiz are the two ports into which (money) gold and &s;ilver from South Amer|ica are imported, and which afterwards divides and &s;preads <HI>it&s;elf</HI> over Europe, by means of commerce, and increa&s;es the quantity of money in all parts of Europe." The critics at la&s;t exclaimed:
<Q>"How va&s;t a head is here without a brain!"</Q></P>
<P>But they had &s;oftened this &s;everity of animadver&s;ion, had they at that time known, what is now known, that Mr. Brand Hollis and the com|mittee of democrats corrected the manu&s;cript, and that Jordan, the book|&s;eller, ca&s;trated the copy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ca&s;trating hand of Mr. Jordan appears in the title-page; he there makes Thomas Paine, <HI>a Secretary for Foreign Affairs</HI> to Congre&s;s, in&s;tead of <HI>the Secretary to a Committee of Congre&s;s</HI> for Foreign Affairs.

<P>After &s;o learned an expo&s;ition of the cau&s;es <HI>why writers write,</HI> and <HI>readers read NONSENSE,</HI> without perceiving that they write and read <HI>non-&s;en&s;ically,</HI> the critics proceeded regularly to review <HI>the matter</HI> of Mr. Pain's pamphlet under the <HI>three heads,</HI> into which he divides it him&s;elf: <HI>the ar|gument; the hi&s;tory; the mi&s;cellaneous.</HI></P>
<P>It was a &s;ad &s;ight, &s;aid they, to &s;ee at the opening of the controver&s;y, &s;o able a polemic as Mr. Pain turn his back on his opponent. Mr. Burke every where con&s;iders the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution as an <HI>actual authority,</HI> and the legi&s;lative power, the executive power, and the judicial power, which are emanations from it, as <HI>exi&s;ting energies,</HI> that pre&s;erve the quiet of the public, and produce the happine&s;s of the people. On the other hand, Mr. Pain throughout <HI>his argument,</HI> not only &s;uppo&s;es, but a&s;&s;erts, that <HI>the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution no where exi&s;ts;</HI> that the con&s;titutional &s;y&s;|tem, compo&s;ed as it is of the legi&s;lative, the executive, and judicial powers, were its exi&s;tence even acknowledged, has no valid authority to direct or puni&s;h any <HI>grown</HI> man. As a logician, then, he &s;uppo&s;es what he ought to prove; and as a philo&s;opher he a&s;&s;erts, much more than ar|gues, again&s;t incontrovertible facts. Thus, Mr. Pain, as a brui&s;er, <HI>&s;hifts</HI> before he is <HI>&s;truck,</HI> and falls before he has put in his blow. And thus the bully, who turns his back, and &s;hifts, and &s;inks, even before the <HI>&s;et-to,</HI> &s;hews that he is con&s;cious of his own weakne&s;s, or fears the &s;trength of his an|tagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>The great art, &s;aid the critics, of Mr. Pain, as a polemic, con&s;i&s;ts in mi&s;quoting plainly, or mi&s;repre&s;enting de&s;ignedly, the po&s;itions of his adver&s;ary. Mr. Burke had &s;aid &s;arca&s;tically, that every future king of England would &s;ucceed hereditarily to the government in contempt of <HI>the Con&s;titutional Society.</HI> Mr. Pain now converts, by the magic of his wand, this plain a&s;&s;ertion of fact and law into a po&s;itive affirmation of an hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion <HI>in contempt of the people:</HI> and he thereupon enjoys, through twenty pages, the triumph of his own artifice; without reflect|ing,

that the day of detection would come, when the &s;ophi&s;ter would be exhibited to his own <HI>&s;entimental mob,</HI> as an object of ridicule.</P>
<P>In treating of <HI>rights of man,</HI> &s;aid the critics, Mr. Pain either artfully, or ignorantly, refers always to the rights of &s;avages; never to the rights of <HI>citizens.</HI> How ridiculous is it to rea&s;on about the circum&s;tances of men who do not exi&s;t on earth! Within the wide circumference of the globe, there have not been found a people, however &s;avage, who had not &s;ome rules of action. A fair <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, then, was bound to refer, in his argument, to tho&s;e rules, as exi&s;ting energies. Every nation, how|ever civilized, or however &s;avage, has its own <HI>civil</HI> rights, which are the re&s;ult of tho&s;e energies: we &s;peak familiarly of the rights of Engli&s;h|men, the rights of Dutchmen, and the rights of Ru&s;&s;ians. All tho&s;e various rights &s;pring out of their &s;everal &s;y&s;tems. If there be a que&s;tion with regard to the rights of Engli&s;hmen, we mu&s;t refer for a &s;olution to the laws of Engli&s;hmen. And, in the &s;ame manner, if it be inquired, what fact con&s;titutes the crime of <HI>&s;windling</HI> in England, we mu&s;t refer to the &s;tatute, which de&s;cribes the offence; &s;o of perjury, forgery, and other offences, which, as they infringe the rights of particular citizens, are regarded as attacks upon the whole &s;ociety.</P>
<P>All this was premi&s;ed, &s;aid the critics, in order to enable the reader to determine the grand que&s;tion, which was debated fir&s;t between Dr. Price and Mr. Burke, and, &s;econdly, between Mr. Burke and Mr. Pain, as to the manner of <HI>ca&s;hiering government,</HI> and <HI>choo&s;ing governors.</HI> Among cool rea&s;oners, it mu&s;t be allowed in argument, that if every man, wo|man, and child, in any community, were to vote for ca&s;hiering govern|ment, they have a right to give &s;uch vote, and to appoint new governors. But, did every man, woman, and child, ever meet for &s;uch purpo&s;es? Never. Will every man, woman, and child, ever meet for &s;uch pur|po&s;es? Never: for it is phy&s;ically impo&s;&s;ible, that every man, woman, and child, &s;hould ever meet together for any purpo&s;e. To talk of dep|uties is not to conquer the difficulty. The very appointment of dele|gates to do any act is an advance within the limits of &s;ociety: but Mr. Pain is in a &s;avage &s;tate; he is arguing about <HI>rights of man</HI> who have not yet entered into &s;ociety; and, therefore, it is not allowable, in can|did di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, to mingle different rights together; to borrow from the laws of &s;ociety, in order to &s;upport the feeble condition of &s;avagene&s;s; and yet, to in&s;i&s;t, that he adopts none of the notions of &s;ociety, for the u&s;es of &s;ophi&s;try.</P>
<P>This grand que&s;tion, then, is to be determined by the maxims of gen|eral &s;ociety; by the rules of the particular &s;ociety of Great Britain. Thus much being &s;ettled, &s;aid the critics, there can be no doubt, that according to the laws of the land, every man, any number of men, any community, may petition for the redre&s;s of grievances; for the repeal of an old law, or the introduction of a new one. This is done daily, during the &s;itting of parliament, and it is done rightfully. About this right, then, there is no que&s;tion.</P>
<P>But the que&s;tion is, whether, according to the laws of Great Britain, any man, any number of men, any club of men, may attempt by violence to ca&s;hier governors, to change government, or to alter the con&s;titution.
<PB N="37" REF="030178_0036_0FE4BF5CF89EB488">
The an&s;wer is, that the laws of Great Britain do not allow &s;uch attempts; that the laws of Great Britain puni&s;h all per&s;ons, as traitors, who make &s;uch attempts. Thus, Lord Loughborough explained the law, upon the point, when he delivered his charge to the grand jury, in the Borough, who were to indict the rioters, in 1780.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The critics generally u&s;e &s;uch authorities as they have at hand; and they quo|ted, on this occa&s;ion, that u&s;eful book, Dod&s;ley's Regi&s;ter, 1780, p. 277, for Lord Loughborough's <HI>celebrated charge.</HI></NOTE> Thus, upon the trial of Lord George Gordon, Lord Mansfield declared the opinion of the whole court, which was not controverted by any lawyer or by any man. Lord Man&s;|field went a &s;tep further: as there had been &s;ome doubts, he declared the opinion of the judges to be, that though every one, and any number of per&s;ons, had a right to a&s;k for the redre&s;s of grievances, yet the petition mu&s;t be pre&s;ented by no more than ten per&s;ons, or the parties would be puni&s;hed as criminals.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dod&s;ley's Regi&s;ter, 1781, p. 236, for Lord Mansfield's more celebrated charge to the jury.</NOTE></P>
<P>But this mode of rea&s;oning has no weight with Mr. Pain. He de|clares the con&s;titution of Great Britain not to exi&s;t; the laws not to ex|i&s;t; the government not to exi&s;t. We are now, &s;aid the critics, di&s;cu&s;|&s;ing an important &s;ubject candidly. It is not &s;ufficient to <HI>a&s;&s;ert</HI> any po|&s;ition, from which intere&s;ting deductions are to be drawn; upon which <HI>Revolutions</HI> are to be built. Every rea&s;oner mu&s;t prove his own premi|&s;es, before he be allowed to draw his conclu&s;ions. Now, as it is a fact, to the truth of which the &s;en&s;es of a whole nation bear te&s;timony, that the con&s;titution, and laws, and government, of Great Britain do exi&s;t, we are obliged, &s;aid the critics, to tell Mr. Pain, that as a rea&s;oner he ar|gues here, and through the greater part of his pamphlet, mo&s;t illogically; becau&s;e he con&s;tantly rea&s;ons again&s;t facts.</P>
<P>When it is once admitted in argument, becau&s;e it cannot be denied, that Great Britain is a formed &s;ociety, having a con&s;titution and laws, it follows as an undeniable con&s;equence, that all the political ca&s;es, in Mr. Pain's pamphlet, are to be determined by a reference to the code; to the body of laws. It is therefore unphilo&s;ophical in Mr. Pain, to refer con|tinually in his rea&s;onings, to a &s;tate of &s;avagene&s;s that does not, in fact, exi&s;t; or, indeed, to any other &s;tate than the laws of the particular coun|try, about which he treats. And as old men, &s;aid the critics, we are thus led to &s;u&s;pect, that the ultimate object of Mr. Pain, and of tho&s;e who circulate his tract, mu&s;t be, to give them&s;elves little trouble about the con&s;titution and laws of Great Britain, when they can collect num|bers enow to annihilate all by a tumult.</P>
<P>We were urged, &s;aid the critics, by our years and our apprehen&s;ions, to look forward from &s;uch rea&s;onings and &s;uch an object, to <HI>the end.</HI> What would be the immediate con&s;equences of annihilating <HI>the con&s;titution</HI> and the laws by a <HI>tumult?</HI> All the rights of &s;ociety, which are emanations from them, would be annihilated by the &s;ame &s;troke of violence. Who|ever holds any right under the common law, would lo&s;e it; whoever enjoys any privilege, under an act of parliament, would lo&s;e it; whoever partakes of any franchi&s;e from a charter, would lo&s;e it: for all the&s;e rights are derived only from the laws of &s;ociety; and the foundation

being removed, the &s;uper&s;tructure mu&s;t fall. Yes, &s;ay the metaphy&s;ical reformers, with wonderful apathy, all this and more would happen, if &s;uch events were not prevented; but we can remove your apprehen&s;ions by a <HI>&s;ingle vote,</HI> that &s;uch mi&s;chiefs &s;hall not en&s;ue. Having lived long enough, &s;aid the critics, to prefer pre&s;ent enjoyment to future expecta|tion, we would not tru&s;t our liberty, our effects and our lives, to the promi&s;ed vote of a metaphy&s;ical mob.</P>
<P>Thus much, then, with regard to the <HI>argument</HI> of Mr. Pain's pamphlet. The critics proceeded, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> to con&s;ider the <HI>hi&s;torical part.</HI> As an hi&s;|torian, Mr. Pain plainly takes his &s;ide. He avows his purpo&s;e, to ele|vate one party, and to depre&s;s the other. A party pamphlet may an&s;wer a party purpo&s;e: but mankind agree to reprobate a party hi&s;tory. The &s;tyle, which in hi&s;toric writing is of e&s;&s;ential con&s;equence, being writ|ten to plea&s;e and in&s;truct, will, no doubt, gratify all tho&s;e, who find de|light in bad grammar and fal&s;e idiom; in har&s;hne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion and feeblene&s;s of pau&s;e. It was reported in 1784, we may remember, that Mr. Pain intended to write the hi&s;tory of the American war: but, from this &s;pecimen of his impartiality and his language, we are led to imagine, that however many readers he might meet among the heroes of his tale, he would find few in Britain.</P>
<P>The critics proceeded, <HI>thirdly,</HI> to the <HI>mi&s;cellaneous part</HI> of Mr. Pain's pamphlet. As they had &s;aid already &s;o much of &s;ociety, government, and law, they chiefly reviewed what he delivered on <HI>political economy.</HI> All that he had retailed in his <HI>Pro&s;pects on the Rubicon,</HI> with regard to money, and credit, and commerce, he interweaves into his <HI>Rights of Man.</HI> As he deals much in dogmas, he now di&s;po&s;es of great variety of &s;uch goods. He is, however, chiefly anxious to prove, that there is no wealth but money. The cattle of the farmer are not wealth, it &s;eems; what|ever wares the &s;hopkeeper may have in the warehou&s;e, he is not wealthy, if he have no money in the till; the knowledge and indu&s;try of a trade&s;|man are not wealth, if he have no ca&s;h in the che&s;t. By thus a&s;&s;erting money alone to be wealth, and &s;hewing how much coin had been brought into this i&s;land, and how little remained; he endeavours to prove, that Great Britain has at pre&s;ent le&s;s commerce and opulence, than in former times. He has no notion, it &s;eems, that there is a traffic in bullion. He does not know, that foreign coins are continually imported and &s;ent out, ju&s;t as there is a demand for them at home or abroad; but, &s;aid the critics, &s;ince the people were in&s;tructed by <HI>the Political Economy</HI> of Stewart, and the <HI>Wealth of Nations</HI> of Smith, they are not to be captivated by &s;uch &s;ophi&s;ms and fooleries.</P>
<P>The foregoing critici&s;m, with all its elaboration, admits of a &s;ati&s;|factory an&s;wer. Let the truth be told, and ju&s;tice be done, whatever may be the con&s;equences. Our author knew, that he a&s;&s;erted what he could not prove; that he mi&s;repre&s;ented what he could not controvert; that he aimed to delude rather than convince: and his de&s;ign to vent his prejudices, and &s;erve a party, mu&s;t be carefully &s;canned, before his merits can be accurately &s;ettled, either as a writer or a man. We fore&s;ee, but we de&s;pi&s;e the retort, which malignity may make, that in order to e&s;|tabli&s;h his abilities, you mu&s;t &s;acrifice his morals.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="030178_0038_0FE4BF5E84D34290">Notwith&s;tanding the <HI>reviews</HI> of critici&s;m, our author received the applau&s;e of party. Nay, philology came in the per&s;on of Horne Tooke, who found his retreat after &s;ome inquiry, to mingle her cordial gratula|tions with the thanks of greater powers: <HI>You are,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>like Jove, coming down upon us in a &s;hower of gold.</HI> Our author was highly gratified by &s;uch attentions; yet he was not happy: he plainly wi&s;hed for &s;ome|thing that was &s;tudiou&s;ly withheld. Like hone&s;t Rou&s;&s;eau, he longed for pro&s;ecution. While fluttering on the wing for Paris, he hovered about London a whole week, waiting to be taken, not by the catchpoles of creditors, but by the runners of Bow-&s;treet.</P>
<P>Yet, the me&s;&s;engers of the pre&s;s would not meddle either with his per|&s;on or his pamphlet. Upon what motives the government of England acted, with regard to both, we have never heard. Whether the mini&s;ters tru&s;ted to the good &s;en&s;e of England, which generally gains the a&s;cend|ant; whether they left his <HI>&s;tyle</HI> to be detected by the &s;chool-boys of En|gland; whether they relinqui&s;hed his &s;entiment to be de&s;pi&s;ed by the men of England; whether they gave up &s;uch a character to the contempt of the women of England; we may conjecture, but cannot tell.</P>
<P>At length, &s;tung by di&s;appointment, our author departed for France, about the middle of May, 1791. He &s;oon found that his pre&s;criptions had worked wonders. The land was tranquil: the people were happy. Yet, in the mid&s;t of this tranquillity and happine&s;s, the <HI>executive power</HI> departed from Paris: the <HI>executive power</HI> was &s;oon arre&s;ted by the <HI>execu|tive power.</HI> The&s;e events induced our author to ob&s;erve, with his <HI>u&s;ual coolne&s;s,</HI> to his congenial friend, Mr. Thomas Chri&s;tie: "You &s;ee the ab&s;urdity of monarchical government; here will be a whole nation di&s;|turbed by the folly of one man!"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Thomas Chri&s;tie's letter, dated from Paris, June 22d, 1791; and publi&s;hed in the Morning Chronicle, of the 29th of June, 1791.</NOTE> Thus the tongue continually blurts out the prevailing thoughts of the heart! The experience of &s;uch men had never taught them what mi&s;chiefs had ari&s;en, in every country, from the madne&s;s of the multitude.</P>
<P>An example &s;oon occurred, which ought to have in&s;tructed both: a <HI>&s;entimental mob</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id.</NOTE> a&s;&s;embled in Paris, to behold the executive power re|turn; and concurrence of opinion led our author to mingle with <HI>the many,</HI> on that plea&s;ing occa&s;ion. An officer proclaimed the will of the National A&s;&s;embly, that all &s;hould be <HI>&s;ilent</HI> and <HI>covered.</HI> In a moment all tongues were &s;till; all hats were on. Not &s;o our author: He had lo&s;t his cockade; and to have a hat, without a cockade, was trea&s;on. A cry aro&s;e, <HI>Ari&s;tocrat! Ari&s;tocrat! A' la lanterne! A' la lanterne!</HI> Whe|ther he pre&s;erved his <HI>u&s;ual coolne&s;s,</HI> during this uncommon danger, we are unable to tell. A Frenchman, who could &s;peak Engli&s;h, de&s;ired him to put on his hat: But the hat, having no cockade, he was in|volved in a &s;ad dilemma; but the &s;entimental mob was at length in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;atisfied by prudent explanation. Our author was now left to balance cooly in equal &s;cales, whether the folly of one man, or the madne&s;s of the multitude, be mo&s;t mi&s;chievous, be mo&s;t incon&s;i&s;tent with freedom. Metaphy&s;ical prejudice, like the jaundice, gives a yellow colour to the efferve&s;cence of the mind. And we may ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e,
<PB N="40" REF="030178_0039_0FE4BF600BFD6988">
that our author, like other men, who confound liberty and anarchy to|gether, was not even now convinced, by his per&s;onal danger, that there is no &s;afety for property, freedom, or life, in a country, where the indi|vidual may be in&s;tantly executed, for having no cockade in his hat. Our author returned to London ju&s;t time enough to partake in the celebration of the French Revolution, on the 14th of July, 1791, though he did not attend at the Crown and Anchor, till eight o'clock in the evening, when the multitude had frowned the &s;even hundred and fifty celebrators into the ob&s;curity of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the night of his arrival our author &s;lept at his u&s;ual haunt, the White Bear, Piccadilly, on Wedne&s;day the 13th of July; he breakfa&s;ted there the next morning; he afterwards dined in the hou&s;e of one of his well known patrons in the city: yet, it was thought proper that he &s;hould not attend the public dinner. And the runners of the <HI>Democrats</HI> were di&s;patched to the coffee hou&s;es and book|&s;ellers' &s;hops to in&s;i&s;t, that our author was not in town; and to attain &s;ome object, that cannot be explained, <HI>"To lend a lie the confidence of truth."</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Biography treats only of the pa&s;t. Prophecy alone can reveal the fu|ture. And as we are not prophets, we will not conjecture with re|gard to our author's &s;ub&s;equent life and <HI>fate.</HI></P>
