<HEAD>A SHORT SKETCH, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>VIRTUE, &s;ay morali&s;ts, is &s;o tran&s;cendently beau|tiful, that &s;he need but be <HI>&s;een,</HI> to be univer|&s;ally admired: and is not VICE &s;o hateful, that the more its features are <HI>viewed,</HI> the more it will be a|voided? The traffic in the human &s;pecies, particu|larly as carried on by the Europeans on the coa&s;t of Africa, has &s;o horrible an a&s;pect, that nothing, one &s;hould think, but the MASK, under which it has been concealed, could have prevented all the ci|vilized nations in the world uniting to drive the de|te&s;ted Mon&s;ter from the face of the earth. This MASK is, however, at length taken away, and the traffic &s;tands expo&s;ed in all its real, unalterable de|formity. The PEOPLE are now called upon to be|hold, to feel, and judge for them&s;elves. The re|pre&s;entations of former writers on this &s;ubject were roundly denied; the facts they &s;tated were not only contradicted, but deemed impo&s;&s;ible, and the authors them&s;elves were accu&s;ed of &s;lander. Now we have a body of EVIDENCE to which to appeal; of evi|dence, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing every e&s;&s;ential of <HI>credibility.</HI> The witne&s;&s;es have declared before the Select Committee of the Hou&s;e of Commons, what they them&s;elves &s;aw: they had the be&s;t opportunities of ob&s;ervation, and they are di&s;intere&s;ted. And now it appears, that one half of the tale of human mi&s;ery hath not been told; and that every principle, that can bind a man
<PB N="4" REF="024233_0004_0FC57C0CE7F2C6B0">of honour and con&s;cience,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the the Hou&s;e of Commons.</NOTE> loudly calls for the pro|hibition of the iniquitous traffic. Hard indeed mu&s;t tho&s;e hearts be, and inacce&s;&s;ible tho&s;e under&s;tand|ings.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fox's ditto.</NOTE> which &s;uch evidence cannot reach!</P>
<P>The Evidence delivered before the Select Commit|tee of the Hou&s;e of Commons is very voluminous, occupying two thou&s;and pages in folio. But a judi|cious Ab&s;tract and Arrangement of the Evidence, on the Part of the Petitioners for the Abolition of the Slave Trade,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Printed by J. Phillips, George-Yard, Lombard Street.</NOTE> has been publi&s;hed, and in a &s;hort compa&s;s, contains the evidence of well informed per|&s;ons on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In the PREFACE to this important volume of evi|dence we read of rewards offered for taking run-away negroes <HI>alive or dead</HI>&mdash;of laws being required to be made to prevent the practice of <HI>cutting off ears, no|&s;es, and tongues&mdash;of breaking limbs</HI> and <HI>putting out eyes</HI>&mdash;to prevent <HI>di&s;tempered, maimed, and worn out negroes</HI> from infe&s;ting towns&mdash;to prevent <HI>aged</HI> and <HI>infirm</HI> negroes being driven from the plantations <HI>to &s;tarve.</HI> We meet al&s;o with &s;uch kind of PREAM|BLES to acts as the following, viz.</P>
<P>'Whereas the extreme cruelty and inhumanity of the managers, over&s;eers, and book-keepers of e&s;tates, have frequently driven &s;laves into the woods, and oc|ca&s;ioned rebellions, internal in&s;urrections, &amp;c. And whereas al&s;o it frequently happens, that &s;laves come to their deaths by ha&s;ty and &s;evere blows and other improper treatment of over&s;eers and book-keepers, in the heat of pa&s;&s;ion; and when &s;uch accidents do happen, the victims are entered in the plantation-books
<PB N="5" REF="024233_0005_0FC57C0E93EC3458">books, as having died of convul&s;ions, fits, or other cau&s;es not to be accounted for; and to conceal the real truth of the cau&s;e of the death of &s;uch &s;lave or &s;laves, he or they is or are immediately put under ground, &amp;c. Other preambles of a &s;imilar complex|ion, re&s;pecting the lodging, food, and clothes of ne|groes, are here to be met with. We al&s;o find that run-away negroes, when adverti&s;ed, are de&s;cribed by the various brands upon their &s;houlders, brea&s;ts, cheeks, and foreheads. A woman is de&s;cribed with a wooden leg; a man as having both his ears cropt, and another by his no&s;e and ears being cut off.' Cornwall Chronicle, Nov. 7, 1789. Other in&s;tan|ces occur within the year 1791.</P>
<P>The FIRST CHAPTER contains an account of the Enormities committed by the Natives of Africa on the per&s;ons of one another, to procure &s;laves for the Europeans, proved by the te&s;timony of &s;uch as have vi&s;ited that continent&mdash;and confirmed by accounts from the &s;laves them&s;elves, after their arrival in the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>Under this head, we learn that Kidnapping, or as the natives call it, Panyaring, is very common, that war is made on purpo&s;e to procure &s;laves. The king's &s;oldiers &s;ot fire to villages in the night, and &s;eize the wretched inhabitants as they attempt to e&s;cape from the flames, and many peri&s;h, either by the fire or &s;word, in the execution of this horrid pur|po&s;e. A Boy, who was carried away in the night from his father's hou&s;e, &s;ays, he believes both his parents were killed, he is &s;ure that one was, and that many others were killed and &s;ome taken. Various in&s;tances are mentioned of con&s;ummate treachery em|ployed in making captives. Kidnapping is profe&s;&s;ion|ally followed; large parties go up the country three
<PB N="6" REF="024233_0006_0FC57C14E74C9F88">hundred miles to drive down captives&mdash;they go a wood ranging, and pick up every one they meet, and &s;trip them naked. The purcha&s;ers generally &s;ay, they do not care how the &s;ellers come by their &s;laves. Many are &s;old for crimes fal&s;ely imputed; the Judges participate the profits of the &s;ale, and are therefore &s;trongly induced to condemn the innocent. Crimes are invented and multiplied for the purpo&s;e of traffic. The great men dre&s;s up and employ wo|men, to entice young men to be connected with them, that they may be convicted of adultery and &s;old. The &s;laves are &s;eparated without the lea&s;t regard to ties of con&s;anguinity, or the pathetic expo&s;tulations and re|mon&s;trances of nature. When &s;lave-&s;hips are on the Coa&s;t the natives go armed, but are no where &s;afe. The man, invited to drink with his neighbour, on ri|&s;ing to go, is &s;eized by two of them and a large dog: and this mode of &s;eizure is common.</P>
<P>By the Second Chapter it appears that the Euro|peans, by means of the trade in &s;laves, are the occa&s;i|on of the before-mentioned enormities; that they &s;ometimes u&s;e additional means to excite the natives to practi&s;e them, often attempt them&s;elves to &s;teal the natives, and &s;ucceed, force trade as they plea&s;e, and are guilty of inju&s;tice in their dealings. In proof of this charge, we learn from the evidence, that Afri|cans receive European goods in exchange for &s;laves&mdash; that they declare when &s;hips cea&s;e to come (as in times of war) &s;laves cea&s;e to be taken. African dealers make the Princes drunk, in order to overcome their aver&s;ion to unprovoked war: they furni&s;h the natives with arms and ammunition and excite them to pillage.</P>
<P>The term war, in Africa, is u&s;ed in general to &s;ignify pillage; and when many towns are &s;een bla|zing
<PB N="7" REF="024233_0007_0FC57C15E70987C0">in the night, the natives &s;ay war is carrying on.</P>
<P>The Traders advance goods to Chiefs to induce them to &s;eize their &s;ubjects or neighbours. Capt. Patter&s;on &s;et two villages at variance, and brought pri&s;oners from both &s;ides. It is not uncommon to make the natives drunk, and then buy them. Gene|ral Rooke &s;ays, that it was propo&s;ed to him by three Engli&s;h captains of &s;hips, to kidnap a hundred, or a hundred and fifty men, women, and children, king Damel's &s;ubjects, who had come to Goree in con&s;e|quence of the friendly intercour&s;e between him and Damel: He refu&s;ed and was much &s;hocked by the propo&s;ition. They &s;aid &s;uch things had been done by a former governor. Two men, black traders, were invited on board, intoxicated, and captured when a&s;leep. The Greg&s;on's people, in running down the coa&s;t, kidnapped thirty-two of the natives. The Dob&s;on's boat of Liverpool had &s;tolen a man and wo|man; the captain on the remon&s;trance of Capt. Briggs, who told him, there would be no more trade if he did not deliver up his two captives, re&s;tored them; upon which the natives loaded a boat with yams, goats, fowls, honey, and palm wine, and would take nothing for them,&mdash;a &s;triking in&s;tance of for|givene&s;s of injuries, and of unmerited kindne&s;s!</P>
<P>We then meet with as oppo&s;ite an exhibition of character as can po&s;&s;ibly be conceived: three or four hundred Africans cruelly ma&s;&s;acreed or carried off, by means of the treacherous contrivance of &s;ix En|gli&s;h captains in Old Calabar River. But let us "turn our eyes for relief to &s;ome ordinary wickedne&s;s"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wilberforce's Speech in the Hou&s;e of Commons</NOTE>: Some con&s;ider frauds as a nece&s;&s;ary part of the traf|fic; they put fal&s;e heads into powder ca&s;ks, cut off two or three yards from the middle of a piece of
<PB N="8" REF="024233_0008_0FC57C176FEA9A00">cloth, adulterate &s;pirits, and &s;teal back articles given. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are others who pay in bottles, which hold but half the contents of the &s;amples &s;hewn; u&s;e fal&s;e &s;teel-yards and weights, and &s;ell &s;uch guns as bur&s;t on firing; &s;o that many of the natives of the windward coa&s;t, are without their fin|gers and thumbs on this account, and it has become a &s;aying that the&s;e guns kill more out of the butt man the muzzle.</P>
<P>The Third Chapter contains an account of the tran&s;actions of the en&s;laved Africans, and of the me|thod of confining, airing, feeding, and exerci&s;ing them; incidents on the pa&s;&s;age, and the manner of &s;elling them when arrived at their de&s;tined ports; the deplorable &s;ituation of the refu&s;e or &s;ickly &s;laves; &s;e|paration of relations and friends; mortality on the pa&s;&s;age, and frequently after &s;ale; and the cau&s;es of this mortality.</P>
<P>On being brought on board, &s;ays Dr. Trotter, they &s;hew &s;igns of extreme di&s;tre&s;s and de&s;pair, from a feeling of their &s;ituation, and regret at being torn from their friends and connexions. They &s;ometimes dream of being in their own country, and when they awake &s;hew their de&s;pair by howling and &s;hrieking in a mo&s;t dreadful manner. The women go into fits. In the cour&s;e of the voyage, the &s;laves are chained to the deck every day from eight in the morning to four o'clock in the afternoon. They are fed twice a day with rice, yeams, and hor&s;e-beans, and now and then a little beef and bread: after each of the&s;e two meals they are allowed half a pint of water; and are forced to jump in their irons, which, by the &s;lave dealers, is called making them dance. This exerci&s;e frequent|ly occa&s;ions the fetters to excoriate their limbs; and, when it is very painful to move at all, they are com|pelled
<PB REF="024233_0009_0FC57C1DB3F1DA00">to dance by a cat-of-nine-tails. The captains order them to &s;ing, and they &s;ing &s;ongs of &s;orrow, the &s;ubject of which are their wretched &s;ituation, and the idea of never returning home: the witne&s;s re|members the very words upon the&s;e occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The &s;laves are &s;o crouded below, that it is impo&s;&s;i|ble to walk among them without treading upon them. Dr. Trotter has &s;een the &s;laves drawing their breath with all tho&s;e laborious and anxious efforts for life, which are ob&s;erved in expiring animals, &s;ubjected by experiment to foul air, or in the exhau&s;ted receiver of an air pump: they cry out&mdash;'we are dying,' and many are irrecoverably lo&s;t by &s;uffocation, having had no previous &s;igns of indi&s;po&s;ition. They are clo&s;ely wedged together, and have not &s;o much room as a man in his co&s;&s;in, either in length or breadth. They &s;ometimes go down well at night, and are found dead in the morning. Alexander Falconbridge was never among them for ten minutes together below, but his &s;hirt was as wet as if dipped in water. Sometimes the dead and living are found &s;hackled together. They lie on the bare blanks, and the prominent parts of their bones, about the &s;houlder-blade and knees, have frequently been &s;een bare. No &s;ituation can be conceived &s;o dreadful and di&s;gui&s;ting as that of &s;laves when ill of the flux. In the Alexander (A. Falcon|bridge &s;ays) the deck was covered with blood and mu|cus, and re&s;embled a &s;laughter-hou&s;e; the &s;tench and foul air were intolerable. The &s;laves, &s;hackled toge|ther, frequently quarrel, and make a great di&s;turb|ance. Some refu&s;e food and medicine, and declare they want to die. In &s;uch ca&s;es compul&s;ion is u&s;ed. The &s;hips are &s;o fitted up as to prevent, by net-work, the flaves jumping overboard; notwith&s;tanding which they often attempt it, and &s;ometimes &s;ucceed, &s;hew|ing
<PB N="10" REF="024233_0010_0FC57C209A71AB28">&s;igns of exultation in the very jaws of death. Some employ other means to de&s;troy them&s;elves, and others go mad. Some re&s;olve to &s;tarve, and means are ineffectually u&s;ed to wrench open their teeth: they per&s;i&s;t in their re&s;olution, and effect their purpo&s;e, in &s;pite of the utmo&s;t pains to prevent it. When &s;everely cha&s;ti&s;ed for not taking their food, they have looked up with a &s;mile and &s;aid, "pre&s;ently we &s;hall be no more." The thum &s;crew is an in&s;trument of torture, the application of it &s;ometimes occa&s;ions mortifications, of which the negroes die. An in|&s;tance occurs of the cruelty of a captain to an infant only nine months old, which one would &s;uppo&s;e too &s;hocking to be true, were it not corroborated by other &s;pecimens of as great cruelty in various parts of the evidence. After a &s;eries of tortures the infant ex|pired, and its &s;avage murderer, not yet &s;atiated, would &s;uffer none of the people on deck to throw the body overboard, but called the Mother, the wretched Mo|ther, to perform this la&s;t &s;ad office to her murdered child. Unwilling as it might naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he was, to comply, "he beat her," regardle&s;s of the indignant murmurs of her &s;ettered countrymen, whom in the barbarous plenitude of &s;ecure tyranny, he per|mitted to be &s;pectators of this horrible &s;cene&mdash;"he beat her, until he made her take up the child and car|ry it to the &s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el, and then &s;he dropped it into the &s;ea, turning her head another way, that &s;he might not &s;ee it!"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Speech by W. Smith in the Hou&s;e of Commons.</NOTE> Another in&s;tance occurs in this chapter, not perhaps of more cruelty, though of greater magnitude.</P>
<P>A &s;hip from Africa, with about four hundred &s;laves on board, &s;truck upon &s;ome &s;hoals, called the Morant Keys, di&s;tant eleven leagues, S. S. E. off the
<PB N="11" REF="024233_0011_0FC57C21F0F5B4E8">ea&s;t end of Jamaica. The officers and &s;eamen of the &s;hip landed in their boats, carrying with them arms and provi&s;ions. The &s;laves were left on board in their irons and &s;hackles. This happened in the night time. When morning came, it was di&s;covered that the negroes had got out of their irons, and were bu|&s;y making rafts, upon which they placed the women and children; the men, who were capable of &s;wim|ing, attended upon the rafts, whil&s;t they drifted be|fore the wind towards the i&s;land where the &s;eamen had landed. From an apprehen&s;ion that the negroes would con&s;ume the water and provi&s;ions which the &s;eamen had landed, they came to the re&s;olution of de&s;troying them, by means of their fire-arms and other weapons. As the poor wretches approached the &s;hore they actually de&s;troyed between three and four hundred of them. Out of the whole cargo only thir|ty three or thirty four were &s;aved and brought to King&s;ton, where they were &s;old at public vendue.</P>
<P>When the &s;hips arrive at their de&s;tined ports, the cargo of &s;laves is &s;old, either by &s;cramble or ven|due. The &s;ale by &s;cramble is de&s;cribed:&mdash;"A great number of people come on board with tallies in their hande (the &s;hip being fir&s;t darkened with &s;ails and co|vered round; the men &s;laves placed on the main deck, and the women on the quarter deck) and ru&s;h through the barricado door with the the ferocity of brures. Some have three or four handkerchiefs tied together, to encircle as many as they think &s;it for their purpo&s;e. This is a very general mode of &s;ale, and &s;o terrifies the poor negroes, that forty or fifty at a time have leaped into the &s;ea; the&s;e, however, the witne&s;s believes, have been taken up again: the wo|men have got away, and run about the town as if they were mad. The &s;laves &s;old by public auction or ven|due,
<PB N="12" REF="024233_0012_0FC57C23675346A8">are generally the refu&s;e, or &s;ickly &s;laves. The&s;e are in &s;uch a &s;tate of health, that they &s;ell greatly un|der price. They have been known to be &s;old for five dollars, a guinea, and even a &s;ingle dollar each. Some that are deemed not worth buying are left to expire in the place of &s;ale, for nobody gives them any thing to eat or drink, and &s;ome of them live three days in that &s;ituation! In the &s;ale no care is taken to prevent the &s;eparation of relations; they are &s;eparated (&s;ays the evidence) like &s;heep and lambs by the butcher. Making the &s;laves walk the plank, is a term u&s;ed for throwing them overboard when provi&s;ions are &s;carce. Sometimes the &s;hips lo&s;e more than half their cargoes by the &s;mall-pox; at others they bury a quarter or one-third on the pa&s;&s;age, owing to various other cau|&s;es of mortality: and it is confe&s;&s;ed by the planters,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Stanley's Speech in the Hou&s;e of Commons.</NOTE> that half the &s;laves die in the &s;ea&s;oning, after arrival in the We&s;t-Indies. Surgeon Wil&s;on &s;ays, that of the death of two-thirds of tho&s;e who died in his &s;hip, the primary cau&s;e was melancholy. The di&s;orders which carry off the &s;laves in &s;uch numbers, are a&s;cribed by Falconbridge to a di&s;ea&s;ed mind, &s;udden tran&s;itions from heat to cold, a putrid atmo&s;phere, wallowing in their own excrements, and being &s;hackled together.</P>
<P>The captains, &s;urgeons, &amp;c. who have quitted the African &s;lave-trade, uniformly declare the rea&s;on to have been, that they could not con&s;cientiou&s;ly con|tinue in it: they &s;ay, that it is an unnatural, ini|quitous, and villainous trade, founded on inju&s;tice and treachery; manife&s;tly carried on by oppre&s;&s;ion and cruelty, and not unfrequently terminating in murder. Capt. Hall &s;ays, he quitted it (in oppo&s;i|tion to lucrative offers) from a conviction that it was perfectly illegal, and founded in blood.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="024233_0013_0FC57C25F6E02C08">
The Fourth Chapter gives an account of the ge|neral e&s;timation and treatment of the &s;laves in the We&s;t-Indies. Dr. Jack&s;on &s;ays, that the negroes are generally e&s;teemed a &s;pecies of inferior beings, whom the right of purcha&s;e gives the owner a power of u&s;ing at his will. T. Wooldrich &s;ays, he never knew the be&s;t ma&s;ter in the We&s;t-Indies u&s;e his &s;laves &s;o well, as the wor&s;t ma&s;ter his &s;ervants in England: that their &s;tate is inconceivable&mdash;that a &s;ight of a gang would convince more than all words.</P>
<P>Slaves are either Field Slaves, or in or out Door Slaves.</P>
<P>The field-&s;laves begin their work at break of day. They work in rows, without exception under the whip of drivers, and the weak are made to keep up with the &s;trong. They continue their labour (with two intermi&s;&s;ions, half an hour during the morning, and two hours at noon) till &s;un &s;et. In the intervals they are made to pick gra&s;s for the cattle. Cook has known pregnant women worked and flogged a few days before their delivery. Some, however, are a lit|tle indulged when in that &s;tate. After the month they work with the children on their backs. In the crop|&s;ea&s;on the labour is of much longer duration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">in &s;ome e&s;tates it is u&s;ual to dig a hole in the ground, which they put the bellies of pregnant women, while they whip them, that they may not excu&s;e puni&s;hment, nor yet endanger the life of the woman of child.</NOTE>. The &s;laves &s;ometimes work &s;o long that they cannot help &s;leeping, and then it not unfrequently happens, that their arms are caught in the mill and torn off. They are &s;aid to be allowed one day in &s;even for re&s;t, but this time is nece&s;&s;arily employed in rai&s;ing food for the other days, and gathering gra&s;s for their ma&s;ters cattle. The be&s;t allowance of food is at Barbadoes, which is a pint of grain for twenty four hours, and half a rotten herring when to be had. When the
<PB N="14" REF="024233_0014_0FC57C28A528F080">herrings are unfit for the whites, they are bought up by planters for the &s;laves. Some allow nine pints of corn a week, and about one pound of &s;alt fi&s;h, which is the greate&s;t allowance mentioned in the whole cour&s;e of the evidence. Some have no provi&s;ion but what they rai&s;e them&s;elves, and they are frequently &s;o fa|tigned by the labour of the re&s;t of the week, as &s;carcely to be able to work for their own &s;upport on the Sunday. And the land allotted them for this purpo&s;e is often at the di&s;tance of three miles from their hou&s;es; it would, however, be quite ample for their &s;upport, were they allowed time &s;ufficient for its cultivation. Sometimes when they have been at the pains of clearing their land, their ma&s;ters take it for canes, and give them wood land in&s;tead of it. This hard&s;hip &s;ome have &s;o taken to heart as to die. Putrid carca&s;es are burnt; if they were buried, the &s;laves would dig them up and eat them, which would breed di&s;tempers among them. They are &s;ometimes driven by extreme hunger to &s;teal at the hazard of their lives. They are badly clothed; one half of them go almo&s;t naked. The &s;laves in general have no bed or bedding at all. Their hou&s;es are built with four poles and thatched. They have little or no pro|perty. All the evidence (to whom the que&s;tion has been propo&s;ed) agree in an&s;wering, that they never knew or heard of a field-&s;lave ever ama&s;&s;ing &s;uch a &s;um, as enabled him to purcha&s;e his own freedom. The arificers, &s;uch as hou&s;e carpenters, coopers, ma|&s;ons, the drivers and head &s;laves, are better off.

<P>The negroes, when whipped, are &s;u&s;pended by the arms, with weights at their feet. They are fir&s;t whipped with a whip made of cow-&s;kin (which cuts
<PB N="15" REF="024233_0015_0FC57C2ADC2A8A70">out the fle&s;h, whereas the military whips cut only the &s;kin,) and afterwards with ebony bu&s;hes (which are more prickly than thorn bu&s;hes in this country,) in order to let out the congealed blood. Dr. Har|ri&s;on thinks the whipping too &s;evere to be inflicted on any human being: he could lay two or three fin|gers into the wounds of a man whipped for not com|ing when he was called. Many receive from one hundred and fifty to two hundred la&s;hes at a time; and in two or three days this is repeated: they wa&s;h the raw parts with pickle; this appears from the con|vul&s;ions it occa&s;ions, more cruel than whipping; but it is done to prevent mortification. After &s;evere whipping, they are worked all day without food, ex|cept what their friends may give them out of their own poor pittance. They are returned to the &s;tocks at night, and worked next day as before. This cruel treatment has made many commit &s;uicide. Cook has known fourteen &s;laves, who, in con&s;equence thereof, ran into the woods and cut their throats together. The&s;e &s;evere puni&s;hments are frequent. The &s;cars made by whipping la&s;t to old age. T. Wool|rich has &s;een their backs one undi&s;tingui&s;hed ma&s;s of lumps, holes, and furrows. They &s;ometimes die of mortification of the wounds. A planter flogged his driver to death, and boa&s;ted of having &s;o done.</P>

<P>The offences for which the before-mentioned pu|ni&s;hments are inflicted are, not coming into the field in time, not picking a &s;ufficient quantity of gra&s;s, not appearing willing to work, when in fact &s;ick and not able; for &s;taying too long on an errand, for not coming immediately when called, for not bringing home (the women) the full weekly &s;um enjoined by their owners; for running away, and for theft, to which they are often driven by hunger.</P>

The &s;laves have little or no redre&s;s again&s;t ill-u&s;age of any &s;ort; the laws to re&s;trict puni&s;hment are a mere farce, and univer&s;ally di&s;regarded, or when pre|tended to be ob&s;erved they are in divers ways ef|fectually evaded: be&s;ides, the evidence of a Black is in no ca&s;e whatever admitted again&s;t a White Man; which circum&s;tance alone is enough to deprive the negroes of all legal protection whatever, were the laws, in other re&s;pects, ever &s;o ju&s;t and &s;alutary.

<P>In the Fifth Chapter, it is proved, by &s;uch as have &s;een them in their own country, that the natives of Africa are equal to the Europeans in their natural ca|parities, feelings, affections, and moral character. They manufacture gold and iron, in &s;ome re&s;pects, equal to the European Arti&s;ts&mdash;al&s;o cloth and leather with uncommon neatne&s;s; the former they die blue, yellow, brown and orange. They are &s;killed in making indigo and &s;oap, and pottery wares, and prepare &s;alt for their own u&s;e from the &s;ea water. They al&s;o make ropes with aloes. With re&s;pect to their moral
<PB N="19" REF="024233_0019_0FC57C33E18B0D28">character, they are very hone&s;t and ho&s;pitable: grate|ful and affectionate, harmle&s;s and innocent; punctu|al in their dealings, and as capable of virtue as the Whites. They are &s;u&s;ceptible of all the &s;ocial virtues: genero&s;ity, fidelity, and gratitude, are allowed them by Dr. Stuart. Tho&s;e virtues Dr. Jack&s;on enume|rates, and adds charity to all in di&s;tre&s;s, and a &s;trong attachment on the part of parents to their children, T. Woolrich &s;ays, he never knew of an African, who could expre&s;s him&s;elf, that did not believe in the ex|i&s;tence of a &s;upreme Being.</P>
<P>In the Sixth and Seventh Chapters it appears that the natives po&s;&s;e&s;s indu&s;try and a &s;pirit of commerce, &s;ufficient for carrying on a new trade; that their coun|try abounds with, and might ea&s;ily be made &s;till more productive of, many and various articles of commerce; but that the traffic in &s;laves is an in&s;uperable impedi|ment to opening a new trade.</P>
<P>In the Eighth Chapter it is inquired, whether the &s;lave trade be not a grave (in&s;tead of a nur&s;ery) of the &s;eamen employed in it</P>
<P>It appears by the mu&s;ter-rolls of Liverpool and Bri&s;tol, that in 350 ve&s;&s;els, 12, 263 men were em|ployed, out of whom 2643 were lo&s;t, that is to &s;ay, more than a fifth of the whole number employed, or more than &s;even in every &s;ingle voyage, be&s;ides near|ly one half of tho&s;e who go out with the &s;hips are con|&s;tantly left behind.</P>
<P>Capt. Hall (of the merchant's &s;ervice) &s;ays that the crews of the African &s;hips, when they arrive in the We&s;t Indies, are the mo&s;t mi&s;erable objects he ever met with in any country in his life: he does not know a &s;ingle in&s;tance to the contrary. He has frequently &s;een them with their toes rotted off, their legs &s;welled to the &s;ize of their thighs, and in an ulcerated &s;tate all
<PB N="20" REF="024233_0020_0FC57C34C93AE270">over, &amp;c. &amp;c. This account is confirmed by Capt. Hall of the navy. Sir W. Young is of opinion, that a trade to Africa in the natural productions of the country, would not be attended with more inconveni|ence to the health of the &s;eamen employed in it, than the pre&s;ent We&s;t-India Trade.</P>
<P>In the Ninth Chapter we find that the &s;eamen em|ployed in the &s;lave trade are in general barbarou&s;ly u&s;ed. They are wor&s;e fed both in quantity and qua|lity of food than the &s;eamen in other trades. They have little or no &s;helter night or day from the incle|mency of the weather during the whole of the middle pa&s;&s;age. They are inhumanly treated when ill, and &s;ubjected to the fury of the impa&s;&s;ioned officers for very trifles. A boy, to avoid the cruel treatment of his officer. jump'd overboard, and was drowned. A man was killed with a hand &s;pike for being very ill and unable to work. Six men were chained together by their necks, legs, and hands, for making their e&s;cape from the ve&s;&s;el; they were allowed only a plan|tain a day; they all died in their chains; one of them (Thomas Jones a very good &s;eaman) raving mad! The evidence proves that in&s;tances of wanton cruelty, and in human treatment in general, are nu|merous, various and frequent. One man, with both his legs in irons and his neck in an iron collar, was chained to the boat for three months, and very often mo&s;t inhumanly beaten for complaining of his &s;itua|tion, both by the captain and other officers. His al|lowance of provi&s;ions was &s;o &s;mall that (after his re|lea&s;e from the boat, on account of extreme weakne&s;s) he begged &s;omething to eat, &s;aying that if it were not given him he &s;hould die:&mdash;the captain reproached him, beat him, and bid him die and be damned. The man died in the night. This was in the Ship Sally,
<PB N="21" REF="024233_0021_0FC57C362BCB9BE0">on board of which ill-treatment was common. Ano|ther man was deliberately, by a &s;eries of &s;hocking bar|barities, murdered.</P>
<P>Sir Geo. Young remarks that a &s;hip of the line might be pre&s;ently manned by the &s;ailors who wi&s;h to e&s;cape from the mi&s;eries of African &s;hips. One poor young man, when dying in con&s;equence of the ill treatment he had received from the captain, &s;aid (which were the la&s;t words A. Falconbridge heard him &s;peak) "I cannot puni&s;h him (meaning the cap|tain) but God will." The &s;ailors when &s;ick are beat|en for being lazy, till they die under the blows!</P>
<P>"If this be the real &s;ituation of things, how hap|pens it (the reader may perhaps a&s;k) that the objects of &s;uch tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion &s;hould not obtain re|dre&s;s, and that our courts of law &s;hould not have to decide upon more ca&s;es of this kind, than they have at pre&s;ent?" It is an&s;wered, "the&s;e objects are gene|rally without friends and money, without which the injured will &s;eek for ju&s;tice but in vain; and becau&s;e the peculiarity of their &s;ituation is an impediment to their endeavours for redre&s;s." Whoever wi&s;hes for a more particular an&s;wer to this que&s;tion, may meet with it in "Clark&s;on's E&s;&s;ay on the Impolicy of the African Slave-Trade," (page 52) from which the que&s;tion and the above general reply are quoted.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould &s;till be a&s;ked, "how it happens that &s;eamen enter for &s;lave ve&s;&s;els, when &s;uch general ill u&s;age on board of them can hardly fail of being known?" the reply mu&s;t be taken from the evidence, "that whereas &s;ome of them enter voluntarily, the greater part of them are trepanned; for that it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of certain landlords to make them intoxicat|ed, and get them into debt, after which <HI>their only al|ternative is a Guineaman or a Goal.</HI></P>

In the Tenth Chapter it is proved not to be true, what &s;ome &s;ay, that the natives of Africa are happier in the European colonies than in their own country. They love their own country, but de&s;troy them|&s;elves in the colonies, &amp;c. &amp;c. But any compari&s;on between the two &s;ituations is as (H.

<P>The Eleventh, Twelfth, and Thirteenth Chapters are on the &s;ubject of negro population in the colonies, and plainly &s;hew that the importation of fre&s;h Afri|cans might immediately be &s;uperceded, by the intro|duction of general good treatment, and of ecertain &s;a|lutary regulations therein &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>The Fourteenth Chapter is employed to demon|&s;trate, from the evidence before the committee, that the coloni&s;ts would be able to carry on the nece&s;&s;ary cultivation of their lands, without a fre&s;h importation of &s;laves while the generation immediately &s;ucceeding the regulations propo&s;ed, were growing up to &s;upply the vacancies occa&s;ioned by the natural deaths of the &s;laves of all ages, now in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Fifteenth Chapter inquires, whether there be not a prevailing opinion in the colonies, that it is cheaper to buy or import &s;laves than thus to increa&s;e them by population. And whether the very rever&s;e of this opinion be not true: namely, that it is more profitable to breed than to import. The re&s;ult of this inquiry is clearly in favour of the <HI>immediate</HI> Abo|lition of the African Slave Trade. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the &s;ixteenth <HI>and la&s;t</HI> chapter, in which it is con&s;idered.

<P>Much has been lately done, by the united friends of equitable freedom, in circulating throughout the king|dom important information on this intere&s;ting &s;ubject: but much remains yet to be done.

Should the foregoing Short Sketch of the Evidence, awaken the feelings, or quicken the attention, of any, in fa|vour of their greatly injured fellow-creatures, the op|pre&s;&s;ed Africans, it is much to be wi&s;hed, that they will not ha&s;tily di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject from their recol|lection, or &s;uffer its painful impre&s;&s;ions to be made in vain: but &s;eek a further acquaintance with the evidence, which the more they examine, the &s;tronger will be their inducements to exert every power and faculty they po&s;&s;e&s;s, for the purpo&s;e of procuring the Abolition of the Slave-Trade.

<P>NOtwithtranding the late determination be the Hou&s;e of Commons on the Slave-Trade, we may hope that the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion it has received will not be u&s;ele&s;s; and that the public attention has not been excited in vain, to a &s;y&s;tem of cruelty which it is painful even to recite. It may be hoped that, claim|ing for our&s;elves the mo&s;t perfect freedom, we &s;hall no longer impo&s;e upon others a &s;lavery the mo&s;t op|pre&s;&s;ive; and that, enjoying a degree of felicity un|equalled in any age or country, we &s;hall no longer range the world to increa&s;e the mi&s;ery of mankind.</P>
<P>The lu&s;t of power, and the pride of conque&s;t, have doubtle&s;s produced in&s;tances far too numerous, of man en&s;laved by man. But we, in an enlightened age, have greatly &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, in brutality and inju&s;tice, the mo&s;t ignorant and barbarous ages: and while we are pro|tending to the fine&s;t feelings of humanity, are exerci&s;|ing unprecedented cruelty. We have planted &s;lavery in the rank &s;oil of &s;ordid avarice; and the produce has been mi&s;ery in the extreme. We have a&s;certain|ed, by a cour&s;e of experiments in cruelty, the lea&s;t portion of nouri&s;hment requi&s;ite to enable man to lin|ger a few years in mi&s;ery; the greate&s;t quantity of la|bor which, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, the extreme of puni&s;h|ment can extort; and the utmo&s;t degree of pain, labor, and hunger united, that the human frame can endure.</P>
<P>In vain have &s;uch &s;cenes been developed. The wealth derived from the horrid trafric, has created an influence that &s;ecures its continuance, unle&s;s the people at large &s;hall refu&s;e to receive the produce of robbery and murder.</P>
<P>The Legi&s;lature having refu&s;ed to interpo&s;e, the people are now nece&s;&s;arily called on, either to reprobate or approve the mea&s;ure; for We&s;t-India &s;lavery mu&s;t
<PB REF="024233_0031_0FC57C4E26E40630">depend upon their &s;upport for its exi&s;tence; and it is in the power of every individual to increa&s;e, or to dimini&s;h its extent. The laws of our country may indeed prohibit us the &s;ugar-cane, unle&s;s we will re|ceive it through the medium of &s;lavery. They may hold it to our lips, &s;teeped in the blood of our fel|low-creatures; but they cannot compel us to accept the loath&s;ome potion. With us it re&s;ts, either to receive it and be partners in the crime, or to exone|rate our&s;elves from guilt, by &s;purning from us the temptation. For let us not think, that the crime re&s;ts alone with tho&s;e who conduct the traffic, or the Legi&s;lature by which it is protected. If we purcha&s;e the commodity, we participate in the crime. The &s;lave-dealer, the &s;lave-holder, and the &s;lave-driver, are virtually the agents of the con&s;umer, and may be con&s;idered as employed and hired by him to procure the commodity. For, by holding out the temptati|on, he is the original cau&s;e, the fir&s;t mover in the horrid proce&s;s; and every di&s;tinction is done away by the moral maxim, That whatever we do by ano|ther, we do our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Nor are we by any means warranted to con&s;ider our individual &s;hare in producing the&s;e evils in a trivial point of view. The con&s;umption of &s;ugar in this country is &s;o immen&s;e, that the quantity commonly u&s;ed by individuals will have an important effect. A family that u&s;es only 5 lb. of &s;ugar per week, with the proportion of rum, will, by ab&s;taining from the con|&s;umption 21 months, prevent the &s;lavery or murder of one fellow-creature; eight &s;uch families in 19 &frac12; years, prevent the &s;lavery or murder of 100, and 38,000 would totally prevent the Slave-Trade to &s;up|ply our i&s;lands. Nay, &s;o nece&s;&s;arily connected are our con&s;umption of the commodity, and the mi&s;ery
<PB N="5" REF="024233_0032_0FC57C4FEF326D90">re&s;ulting from it, that in every pound of &s;ugar u&s;ed, (the produce of &s;laves imported from Africa) we may be con&s;idered as con&s;uming two ounces of hu|man fle&s;h, be&s;ides de&s;troying an alarming number of &s;eamen by the Slave-Trade, and &s;preading incon|ceivable angui&s;h, terror and di&s;may, through an im|men&s;e continent, by the burning of their villages, tearing parents from their families, and children from their parents; breaking every bond of &s;ociety, and de&s;troying every &s;ource of human happine&s;s. A Frouch writer ob&s;erves, "That he cannot look on a piece of &s;ugar, without conceiving it &s;tained with &s;pots of human blood:" and Dr. Franklin adds, that had he taken in all the con&s;equences, "he might have &s;een the &s;ugar not merely &s;potted, but thoroughly dyed &s;carlet in grain."</P>
<P>Dreadful con&s;ideration&mdash;that our increa&s;ing hap|pine&s;s and pro&s;perity has &s;pread de&s;olation and mi|&s;ery over a country as large as all Europe! For it is an indi&s;putable fact, that it is Briti&s;h luxury, the African Slave Trade depends on for &s;upport: they have increa&s;ed, and they would fall together. For our con&s;umption of &s;ugar is now &s;o immen&s;e, that it nearly equals that of all Europe be&s;ides; and Ja|maica new &s;upplies more than all our We&s;t-India I&s;lands did at any period prior to 1755.</P>
<P>But amazingly exten&s;ive as is the increa&s;e of the culture, &s;o far is it from keeping pace with our lux|ury, that (before the di&s;turbances in the French I&s;|lands, within the&s;e two or three years) &s;ugars have ever &s;old in the Briti&s;h market 20 or 30, &s;ometimes 50 per cent. dearer than in any other part of the world. Nor is it to &s;upport the old plantations, as is pretended, but to form new ones, for the &s;up|ply
<PB N="6" REF="024233_0033_0FC57C56A1F46200">of this our increa&s;ing luxury, that the wretch|ed. Africans are torn from their native land.</P>
<P>Let us then imagine our immen&s;e con&s;umption wholly, or in great part to cea&s;e, and our &s;ugars to be thrown on the foreign markets; would additional &s;laves be wanted to &s;upply an overflowing market at a falling price? No: the African Slave Trade, by whom&s;oever conducted, to &s;upply &s;ugar colonies, by whatever nation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, mu&s;t totally cea&s;e. Hor|ror and di&s;may would give place to peace and civili|zation, through a coa&s;t of above three thou&s;and miles extent, and above a thou&s;and miles inland: for &s;o exten&s;ive are our depredations, and &s;o exten&s;ive are the benefits which it is in our power to confer. Nor would the beneficial effects cra&s;e, even here. The We&s;t-India i&s;lands, finding le&s;s demand for &s;ugar, mu&s;t appropriate le&s;s ground to the &s;ugar-cane, and leave more for provi&s;ions: the &s;laves would be le&s;s worked, better fed, and in a few years con&s;i&s;t intirely of native Creoles. Or if the planters appropriate the land to the other productions of the i&s;lands, the frome beneficial effects mu&s;t en&s;ue. For M. Onoke tells us, <Q>the cultivation of cotton, pimento, and coffee, is ea&s;ier than &s;ugar: the &s;laves look better, and incrta&s;e fa&s;tens;</Q> and in&s;tead of requiring additi|onal &s;laves, they would be able to increa&s;e their plan|tations with tho&s;e already in the i&s;lands. For Go|vernor Barry &s;ays, <Q>one acre of &s;ugar requires as much labour as three of cotten.</Q> Thus our re|fraining from the con&s;umption of the &s;ugar-cane, even for a few years, would de&s;troy the Slave Trade to the We&s;t-India I&s;lands, bring fre&s;h land into culture, and place the &s;laves in &s;uch a &s;ituation, that they mu&s;t rapidly incroa&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="024233_0034_0FC57C57E6549770">
The diminution of the con&s;umption of We&s;t India produce, would al&s;o have a powerful effect by &s;ink|ing the price of the commodity; and thereby take a|way the temptation to import additional &s;laves. The effect a &s;mall variation in the &s;upply or demand has on the price, we have recently experienced. The di|&s;turbances in the French &s;ugar i&s;lands, has &s;uddenly rai&s;ed &s;ome of the markets, which were 20 or 30 per cent. lower than the Briti&s;h, much above it; and thereby occa&s;ioned an exportation from this country to &s;upply the deficiency: and our exportation, though only amounting to a 10th of our importation, has rai&s;ed our &s;ugars 50 per cent. And as a fall in the price would ob&s;truct the Slave Trade, and meliorate the condition of the &s;laves; &s;o this ri&s;e will produce effects the mo&s;t baneful. The planter, tempted by the high price to get &s;ugar and rum to market while that high price continues, will deprive his &s;laves of their provi&s;ion grounds, to plant them with canes; and by the energy of the whip, they will be forced to the mo&s;t extreme exertions. The murder, or, in the technical language of the We&s;t-Indies, the <HI>lo&s;s</HI> of his &s;laves, will be to him but a &s;econdary con&s;idera|tion. The large crop, and the high price, will am|ply compen&s;ate him: and the que&s;tion now is, not merely whether we &s;hall hold out to him and induce|ment to purcha&s;e additional &s;laves; but whether we &s;hall tempt him to murder tho&s;e he already has. We can hardly doubt, but that We&s;t India packets have already borne the murderous di&s;patches, expre&s;&s;ed in language too dreadfully explicit, and to the follow|ing effect. <Q>The price of &s;ugar and ruin &s;till continues high. You mu&s;t adopt every mode to forward as large a cargo as po&s;&s;ible. A fortunate cri&s;is now offers it&s;elf for extricating my e&s;tate from the diffi|culties
<PB N="8" REF="024233_0035_0FC57C5A953ACC98">in which it is involved. We mu&s;t avail our|&s;elves of it: another may never occur. Con&s;e|quences, though di&s;agreeable, mu&s;t at the pre&s;ent moment be overlooked. The &s;lave market is &s;till open for a &s;upply. <HI>New-fangted humanity is no more.</HI></Q> The day hardly dawns when the whip re|&s;ounds through tho&s;e regions of horror; nor cea&s;es, till darkne&s;s clo&s;es the &s;cene, which day after day is renewed. The mi&s;erable victims, de&s;titute of every &s;ource of comfort to body or to mind, and &s;inking under the three endemic di&s;ea&s;es of our i&s;lands, hun|ger, torture, and extreme labour; and urged to ex|ertions they are unable to &s;u&s;tain, at length expire beneath the la&s;h, which in vain endeavours to rou&s;e them to a renewal of their labour.</P>
<P>As neither the &s;lave-dealer, nor the planter, can have any moral right to the per&s;on of him they &s;tile their &s;lave, to his labour, or to the produce of it; &s;o they can convey no right in that produce to us: and whatever number of hands it may pa&s;s thro' if the criminal circum&s;tances appertaining to it be known to them at the time of the transfer, they can only have a criminal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: and the money paid, either for the &s;lave, or for the produce of his labour, is paid to obtain that criminal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: and can con|fer no moral right whatever, So, if the death of the per&s;on called a &s;lave, be occa&s;ioned by the criminal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the criminal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or is guilty of murder; and we, who have knowingly done any act which might occa&s;ion his being in that &s;ituation, are acce&s;|&s;aries to the murder before the fact; as by receiving the produce of his labour, we are acce&s;&s;aries to the robbery, after the fact.</P>
<P>If we, as individuals concerned in the Slave Trade either by procuring the &s;laves, compelling them to
<PB N="9" REF="024233_0036_0FC57C5CC84A5850">labour, or receiving the produce) imagine that our &s;hare in the tran&s;action is &s;o minute that it cannot perceptibly increa&s;e the injury; let us recollect that, though numbers partaking of a crime may dimini&s;h the &s;hame, they cannot dimini&s;h its turpitude. Can we &s;uppo&s;e, that an injury of enormous magnitude can take place, and the criminality be de&s;troyed merely by the criminals becoming &s;o numerous as to render their re&s;pective &s;hares indi&s;tingui&s;hable? Were an hundred a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to plunge their daggers into their victim, though each might plead, that without his a&s;&s;i&s;tance the crime would have been compleated, and that his poinard neigher occa&s;ioned nor accelerated the murder, yet every one of them would be guilty of the intire crime. For into how many parts &s;oever a criminal action may be divided, the crime it&s;elf refts intire and compleat on every perpetrator.</P>
<P>But waving this latter con&s;ideration, and even &s;up|po&s;ing for a moment, that the evil has an exi&s;tence from cau&s;es totally independent of us, yet it exi&s;ts; and as we have it in our power jointly with others, to remedy it, it is undoubtedly our duty to contribute our &s;hare, in hope that others will theirs; and to act that part from con&s;cience, which we &s;hould from in|clination in &s;imilar ca&s;es that intere&s;ted our feelings.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance: Let us &s;uppo&s;e the Algerines to e&s;tab|li&s;h &s;ugar plantations, and re&s;ort to the banks of the Thames for &s;laves, as the only place to be in&s;ulted with impunity. Suppo&s;e our wives, our hu&s;bands, our children, our parents, our brethren, &s;wept away, and the fruit of their labour, produced with agonizing hearts and trembling limbs, landed at the port of London. What would be our conduct? Should we &s;ay, Sugar is a nece&s;&s;ary of life? I cannot do without it. Be&s;ides, the quantity I u&s;e is but a &s;mall propor|tion:
<PB N="10" REF="024233_0037_0FC57C5F70DCFCC8">and though it is very criminal of the Algerines to en&s;lave others, yet I am not bound to look to the nature or con&s;equences of the tran&s;action; and pay|ing for the &s;ugar, I have a right to con&s;ume it, how|ever it may have been obtained. If &s;uch would be our language in that ca&s;e, be it &s;o on the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion. For let us recollect, that the only difference is, that in one ca&s;e our relation to the en&s;laved is ra|ther more remote, but that in both ca&s;es they are our brethren.</P>
<P>But it is hardly requi&s;ite to &s;tate &s;o &s;trong a ca&s;e as that &s;uppo&s;ed. For were only one Engli&s;hman to re|ceive injuries, that bore but the &s;lighte&s;t re&s;emblance to tho&s;e daily committed in our i&s;lands, the nation would be inflamed with re&s;entment, and clamorous to avenge the injury. And can our pride &s;ugge&s;t to us, that the rights of men are limited to any nation, or to any colour? Or, were any one to treat a fellow creature in this country as we do the unhappy Afri|cans in the We&s;t-Indies; &s;truck with horror, we &s;hould be zealous to deliver the oppre&s;&s;ed, and puni&s;h the oppre&s;&s;or. Are then the offices of humanity and functions of ju&s;tice to be circum&s;cribed by geographi|cal boundaries? Can rea&s;on, can con&s;cience ju&s;tify this contra&s;t in our conduct, between our prompti|tude, in the one ca&s;e, and our torpor in the other? Mr. Addi&s;on ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that "humanity to be|come e&s;timable mu&s;t be combined with ju&s;tice!" But we &s;eem to act as if we thought that the relief of our fellow-creatures; protection from injuries, commu|nication of benefits, were works of &s;upererogation, to be granted or with-held, as caprice, or cu&s;tom, or inclination may &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>After the important con&s;iderations adduced, it might be reckoned a degradation of the &s;ubject to
<PB N="11" REF="024233_0038_0FC57C61BAFBB758">mention the national dignity; or even that might in|duce us to counteract a powerful body of men, who are trampling under foot the dictates of humanity, and the intere&s;t of the nation: men, who have in 50 years received for &s;ugar alone, above 70 millions more than it would have co&s;t at any other market. And from Mr. Botham's evidence it appears, that in Bata|via, where labour is as high as in England, &s;ugar, equal to the be&s;t We&s;t-India, is &s;old at 1 <ABBR>d</ABBR> half penny per pound. The&s;e are the men, who are endea|vouring to overthrow a plan for &s;upplying us with &s;ugars, by means of free labour; and have the auda|city to tell the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature, "That they cannot aboli&s;h the &s;lave trade; for that if England refu&s;e to furni&s;h them with &s;laves, they will obtain a &s;upply through other channels." And a governor of Barba|does admoni&s;hes us, "From policy, to leave the i&s;lands to the quiet management of their own affairs." The&s;e nominal colonies have, it &s;eems, been taught, that we have no right to controul them; that the acts of their A&s;&s;embles alone are obligatory; and that tho&s;e of Briti&s;h legi&s;lators, are binding only on tho&s;e whom they repre&s;ent. The right of en&s;laving others, they contend for, as the mo&s;t valuable of their privileges.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that the legi&s;lature is not only unwilling, but perhaps unable, to grant redre&s;s; and therefore it is more peculiarly incumbent on us, <HI>To ob&s;tain from the u&s;e of &s;ugar and rum, until our We&s;t-India Planters them&s;elves have prohibited the importa|tion of additional &s;laves, and commenced as &s;peedy and effectual a &s;ubver&s;ion of &s;lavery in their i&s;lands, as the circum&s;tances and &s;ituation of the &s;laves will admit: or till we can obtain the produce of the &s;ugar cane in &s;ome other mode, unconnected with &s;lavery, and unpolluted with blood.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="024233_0039_0FC57C65A40AE208">
For &s;urely it may be hoped that we &s;hall not lamit our views merely to the abolition of the African &s;lave trade, as the colonial &s;lavery formed on it, is in its principle equally unju&s;t. For if it be iniquitous to force the Africans from their native land; equally iniquitous mu&s;t it be, to retain them and their po&s;te|rity in perpetual bondage. Though the African &s;lave trade be the mo&s;t Prominent feature in this wickedne&s;s, yet it is but a feature: and where it aboli&s;hed, the We&s;t India &s;lavery would &s;till exi&s;t. Our planters would breed, in&s;tead of importing &s;laves; and &s;hall we &s;uffer half a million of fellow &s;ubjects, and their po&s;terity, to be held in &s;lavery for ever? I &s;ay, fellow &s;ubjects. For undoubtedly, every per&s;on born in the dominions of Great Britain is a &s;ubject, bound to obey and entitled to the protection of the common law of England; and in oppo&s;ition to which the acts of A&s;&s;emblies, exi&s;ting merely by grant from the crown, can be of no authority.</P>
<P>In demanding liberty then for the per&s;ons called &s;laves in our i&s;lands, we demand no more then they are entitled to by the common law of the land. The mo&s;t eligible mode of putting them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their legal and natural right, may be a que&s;tion of difficulty; but it is a que&s;tion that ought to be con|&s;idered with no other view, but to their happine&s;s. The plan to be adopted, ought to be certain and &s;peedy in its operation; without any con&s;ideration of the &s;uppo&s;ed, or even real intere&s;t, of their oppre&s;|&s;ors: and let it be remembered, that it is in the pow|er of a &s;mall proportion of the people of England to effect it, by refu&s;ing to receive the produce. For the planters them&s;elves would adopt the plan, were that the only condition on which we would con&s;ume the produce of their i&s;lands: nor would the legi&s;lature be
<PB N="13" REF="024233_0040_0FC57C66EE186270">then harra&s;&s;ed with prepo&s;terous claims for compen|&s;ation; which, however unfounded in ju&s;tice or rea|&s;on, will be &s;upported by influence, and enforced with clamour.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e now fully lies before us; and we have to make our choice, either to join our&s;elves with the&s;e manufacturers of human woe, or to renounce the horrid a&s;&s;ociation. If we adopt the former, let us at lea&s;t have the candour to avow our conduct in its real deformity. Let us no longer affect to deplore the ca|lamities attendant on the Slave Trade, of which we are the primary cau&s;e: nor let us pretend to execrate the conduct of the &s;lave-dealer, the &s;lave-holder, or the &s;lave-driver; but apologize for them as our part|ners in iniquity: and be a&s;&s;ured, that if we now take <HI>our</HI> &s;hare in the tran&s;action, we &s;hould, were we plac|ed in a &s;imilar &s;ituation with them, with as little com|punction take <HI>theirs;</HI> unle&s;s we can &s;uppo&s;e the or|der of nature would be &s;o far inverted, as that we &s;hould become virtuous, in proportion as the temp|tation to vice increa&s;ed. Nor &s;hould we then, any more then now, be de&s;titute of &s;ubterfuges to de&s;troy the feelings of our minds, and the convictions of our con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>If ignorance and inattention may be pleaded as our excu&s;e hitherto, yet that can be the ca&s;e no longer. The &s;ubject has been four years before the public. Its dreadful wickedne&s;s has been fully proved. Every fal&s;hood, every deception with which it has been di&s;|gui&s;ed, has been compleatly done away; and it &s;tands before us in all its native horrors. No longer can it be pretended, that Africa is a barbarous, uncultivated land, inhabited by a race of &s;avages inferior to the re&s;t of the human &s;pecies. Mr. How, who was em|ployed by government to go up the country, depo&s;es,
<PB N="14" REF="024233_0041_0FC57C6932042B30">that in land it is every where well cultivated, abound|ing with rice, millet, potatoes, cotton and indigo plantations; and that the inhabitants are quick in learning languages, and remarkably indu&s;trious, ho&s;|pitable and obliging. It appears that they po&s;&s;e&s;s no|ble and heroic minds, di&s;daining &s;lavery, and frequent|ly &s;eeking refuge from it in the arms of death. Nor &s;hall we be again told, of the &s;uperior happine&s;s they enjoy under the benevolent care of the planters; Mr. Coor having depo&s;ed, that <Q>&s;etting &s;laves to work in the morning, is attended with loud peals of whipping;</Q>&mdash;and General Tottenham, <Q>that there is no compari&s;on between regimental flogging, which only cuts the &s;kin, and the plantation, which cuts out the fle&s;h;</Q>&mdash;Capt. Hall, <Q>that the puni&s;h|ments are very &s;hocking, much more &s;o then in men of war;</Q> Capt. Smith, <Q>that at every &s;troke of the whip a piece of fle&s;h is cut out,</Q>&mdash;and Mr. Ro&s;s, <Q>that he con&s;iders a compari&s;on between We&s;t-India &s;laves, and the Briti&s;h pea&s;antry, as an in&s;ult to common &s;en&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>We are now called on to redre&s;s evils, in compari|&s;on with which, all that exi&s;t in this nation &s;ink be|neath our notice; and the only &s;acrifice we are re|quired to make in order to effect it, is the abandon|ing of a luxury, which habit alone can have rendered of importance. If we refu&s;e, can we form the lea&s;t pretence to a moral character? May it not be ju&s;tly inferred, that tho&s;e numerous di&s;plays <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, of which this kingdom boa&s;ts, have not their foun|dation in any virtuous or valuable principle; but that to cu&s;tom and o&s;tetation they owe their origin? And if our execration of the &s;lave trade be any more than mere declaration again&s;t crimes we are not in a &s;itu|ation to commit, we &s;hall, in&s;tead of being &s;olicit|ons
<PB N="15" REF="024233_0042_0FC57C6ABA30BE68">to find de&s;picable di&s;tinctions to ju&s;tify our con|duct, abhor the idea of contributing, in he lea&s;t de|gree, to &s;uch &s;eenes of mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>If the&s;e be the deductions from the mo&s;t obvious principles of rea&s;on, ju&s;tice, and humanity; what mu&s;t be the re&s;ult if we extend our views to religious con|&s;iderations? It will hardly be &s;aid, that we a&s;&s;ume a religious profe&s;&s;ion to dimini&s;h the extent of our mo|ral duties, or to weaken the force of our obligation to ob&s;erve them.</P>
<P>We will therefore a&s;k, if it be meant to in&s;ult the God we pretend to wor&s;hip, by &s;upplicating him to "have mercy upon all pri&s;oners and captives," and to <Q>defend and provide for the fatherle&s;s, widows, and children, and all that are de&s;olate and oppre&s;&s;ed.</Q> But, if the national religion be a mere matter of form, yet &s;urely we may expect that the various denomina|tions of di&s;&s;enters, will think it at the lea&s;t as requi|&s;ite to di&s;&s;ent from the national crimes, as the nation|al religion; unle&s;s they mean to exhibit con&s;ciences of &s;o peculiar a texture, as to take offence at the re|ligion of their country, while they can conform with|out &s;cruple, to its mo&s;t criminal practices. If indeed they are &s;atisfied, after an impartial examination, that the traffic alluded to is fair and hone&s;t, and that the produce ought to be con&s;idered as the re&s;ult of lawful commerce, it will become them to encourage it; it will become them to reprobate this work as an attempt to &s;lander hone&s;t men, and to injure their property, by holding it out to the public, as the produce of rob|bery and murder. But, if the arguments be valid, will they pre&s;ume to treat the &s;ubject with cool indif|ference, and continue a criminal practice? May we not al&s;o hope that the Methodi&s;ts, who appear to feel forcibly their principles, will &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider it?
<PB N="16" REF="024233_0043_0FC57C6EA0102CF8">They are &s;o numerous, as to be able of them&s;elves to de&s;troy that dreadful traffic, which is the &s;ole ob&s;ta|cle to their mini&s;ters &s;preading the go&s;pel in the ex|ten&s;ive continent of Africa; and, however others may affect to degrade the Negroes, they are bound to con&s;ider thou&s;ands of them as their brethren in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But there is one cla&s;s of diffenters who ju&s;tly &s;tand high in the public e&s;timation, for their &s;teady, manly and uniform oppo&s;ition to our colonial &s;lavery. And can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that, after having awakened the public attention, they can refu&s;e to contribute what is in their own power to remedy the evil? The plan propo&s;ed, is a plain and obvious deduction from their uniform principle, of having no concern in what they di&s;approve. Thus, con&s;idering war as unlawful, they con&s;ider goods obtained through that medium as cri|minally obtained; and will not &s;uffer any of their members to purcha&s;e prize-goods: and &s;urely they mu&s;t con&s;ider the &s;eizure of a man's goods, as a crime far inferior to the &s;eizing his per&s;on.</P>
<P>However obvious the duty, yet the mind hardened by habit, admits with difficulty the conviction of guilt; and &s;anctioned by a common practice, we may commit the gro&s;&s;e&s;t violations of duty without remor&s;e. It is therefore more peculiarly incumbent on us in &s;uch &s;ituations, to examine our conduct with the ut|mo&s;t &s;u&s;picion, and to fortify our minds with moral principles, or the &s;anctions of religion. In propor|tion as we are under their influence, we &s;hall exert our&s;elves to remedy the&s;e evils, knowing that our ex|ample, our admonitions, our influence, may produce remote effects, of which we can form no e&s;timate; and which, after having done our duty, mu&s;t be left to <HI>Him who governs all things after the coun&s;el of his own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI></P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT, Added to this American Edition.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Containing Extracts from an E&s;&s;ay, intitled, an impar|tial Enquiry into the State and Utility of the Pro|vince of Georgia; printed in London in <HI>1741.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN Georgia was fir&s;t &s;ettled, be&s;ides other u&s;e|ful regulations, the inhabitants were not allowed to have Negro Slaves. No doubt their objections to them, were founded partly in civil policy, and partly from a &s;ea&s;e of the inju&s;tice and cruelty of that inhu|man practice, which did not operate, with equal force, upon the minds of all the inhabitants; &s;ome of them be|ing de&s;irous of having the benefit of their labour, whith|out looking into con&s;equences, in a remote degree, either as it re&s;pected their own per&s;onal &s;afety, or had an in|fluence on the morals and happine&s;s of their immedi|ate offspring, and their po&s;terity: with views &s;o con|tracted, &s;ome &s;oon grew di&s;contented with this &s;alutary re&s;traint, and petitioned the Governor for liberty to have &s;laves. This produced counter petitions, which leaves a favourable opinion of the wi&s;dom and virtue of &s;ome of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of that &s;tate, parti|cularly of the Saltzburghers who &s;ettled at Ebenezer: the&s;e, to the number of <HI>49</HI> men, with their two mi|ni&s;ters, John Martin Bolzius, and I&s;rael Chri&s;tian Gro|nan, in a petition "be&s;eech the honourable tru&s;tees (of that &s;ettlement) not to allow that any Negroes might be brought to their place, or in their neighbourhood." And with re&s;pect to its being "impo&s;&s;ible and dan|gerous
<PB REF="024233_0045_0FC57C734B215998">for white people to plant and manufacture rice" in that climate, "as being a work only for Negroes, not for European people," they &s;ay, "having experience to the contrary, we laugh at &s;uch talking, &s;eeing that &s;everal of us have had a greater crop of rice la&s;t year, than we wanted for our own con&s;umption." And the inhabitants of Frederica, upon the &s;ame occa&s;ion, pe|titioned again&s;t having Negroes introduced among&s;t them, "but de&s;i&s;ted from &s;ending it, upon an a&s;&s;urance that their apprehen&s;ions of it were needle&s;s."</P>
<P>But the following petition of the Highlanders from Scotland, who had &s;ettled at New-Inverne&s;s in Geor|gia, is de&s;erving of particular attention, as it con|tains &s;entiments congenial with tho&s;e advanced in the fir&s;t of the&s;e treati&s;es; and does credit to the di&s;cern|ment, probity and humanity of the ance&s;tors of that &s;et|tlement. In this petition they remon&s;trate to their then Governor Oglethorpe, that they <Q>were informed, that their neighbours of Savannah had petitioned for the liberty of having &s;laves;</Q> in con&s;equence of which they &s;ay, <Q>We hope, and earne&s;tly entreat, that be|fore &s;uch propo&s;als are hearkened unto, your Excel|lency will con&s;ider our &s;ituation, and of what dan|gerous and bad con&s;equences &s;uch liberty would be of to us.</Q> Then after reciting &s;ome of the&s;e they pro|ceed:</P>
<P><Q>It is &s;hocking to human nature, that any race of mankind, and their po&s;terity, &s;hould be &s;en|tenced to perpetual &s;lavery; nor in ju&s;tice can we think otherwi&s;e of it, than that they are thrown among&s;t us to be our &s;courge, one day or other, for our &s;ins: and as freedom mu&s;t be as dear to them as to us, what a &s;cene of horror mu&s;t it bring about! And the longer it is unexecuted, the bloo|dy &s;cene mu&s;t be the greater: We therefore, for our
<PB REF="024233_0046_0FC57C76AEC00480">own &s;akes our wives and children, and our po&s;te|rity, beg your con&s;ideration, and intreat, that in|&s;tead of introducing &s;laves, you will put us in the way to get &s;ome of our own countrymen, who with their labour in time of peace, and our vigilance, if we are invaded (with the help of the&s;e) will ren|der it a difficult thing to hurt us, or that part of the province we po&s;&s;e&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>Dated <Q>New-Inverne&s;s, January <HI>3, 1738-9,</HI></Q> and &s;igned by <HI>18</HI> freeholders.</P>
<P>As the &s;entiments contained in the above petitions are expre&s;&s;ed with a con&s;iderable degree of energy, and are peculiarly favourable to the cau&s;e of humanity, with an explicit and clear declaration of their di&s;approbation of holding Negroes in a &s;tate of &s;lavery on account of its impolicy and inju&s;tice, as well as from other alarming con&s;iderations; and as they have proceeded from the ance&s;tors of a people, who&s;e repre&s;entative in a former Congre&s;s, was a di&s;tingui&s;hed advocate for continuing the &s;lave trade, they are added; hoping, that the vene|ration they may entertain, for characters &s;o truly de|&s;erving as the&s;e Inverne&s;s petitioners and Saltzburghers of Ebenezer were, may induce a more candid reception of the foregoing pamphlets in that and other Southern &s;tates.</P>
