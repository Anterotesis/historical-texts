<P>Enter ye in at the &s;trait Gate; for wide is the Gate, and broad is the Way which leadeth is De|&s;truction, and many there be which go in thereat:</P>

<P N="1">1. OUR Lord having warned us of the dan|gers which ea&s;ily be&s;et us at our fir&s;t entrance upon real religion, the hinderances which naturally ari&s;e from within, from the wicked|ne&s;s of our own hearts: Now proceeds to ap|prize us of the hinderances from without, parti|cularly ill example and ill advice. By one or the other of the&s;e, thou&s;ands who once ran well, have drawn back unto perdition: Yea, many of tho&s;e who were not novices in religion, who had made &s;ome progre&s;s in righteou&s;ne&s;s. His caution therefore again&s;t the&s;e, he pre&s;&s;es upon us, with all po&s;&s;ible earne&s;tne&s;s, and repeats a|gain and again, in variety of expre&s;&s;ions, le&s;t by any means we &s;hould let it &s;lip. Thus, effec|tually to guard us again&s;t the former, <HI>Enter ye in,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>at the &s;trait gate: For wide it the
<PB N="4" REF="039068_0003_10139268038C9D78">gate and broad is the way that leadeth to de&s;tructi|on, and many there be which go in thereat: Becau&s;e &s;trait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</HI> To &s;ecure us from the latter, <HI>Beware,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>of fal&s;e pro|phets.</HI> We &s;hall at pre&s;ent con&s;ider the former only.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Enter ye in,</HI> &s;aith our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, <HI>at the &s;trait gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to de&s;truction, and many there be which go in thereat: Becau&s;e &s;trait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. In the&s;e words we may ob&s;erve, Fir&s;t, The in&s;eparable properties of the way to hell: <HI>Wide is the gote, broad the way that leadeth to de&s;truction, and many there be that go in thereat:</HI> Secondly, the in|&s;eparable properties of the way to heaven: <HI>Strait is that gate, and few there be that find it:</HI> Thirdly, A &s;erious exhortation grounded thereon, <HI>Enter ye in at the &s;trait gate.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. 1. We may ob&s;erve, Fir&s;t, The in&s;eparable properties of the way to hell: <HI>Wide is the gate and broad is the way, that leadeth to de&s;truction, and ma|ny there be that go in thereat.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Wide indeed is the gate, and broad the way that leadeth to de&s;truction. For &s;in is the gate of hell, and wickedne&s;s the way to de&s;truction. And how wide a gate is that of &s;in? How broad is the way of wickedne&s;s! The <HI>com|mandment of God is exceeding broad,</HI> as extend|ing not only to all our actions, but to every word which goeth out of our lips, yea, every thought that ri&s;es in our heart. And &s;in is
<PB N="5" REF="039068_0004_1013926B335BA8C8">equally broad with the commandment, &s;eeing any breach of the commandment is &s;in. Yea, rather it is a thou&s;and times broader: Since there is on|ly one way of keeping the commandment: For we do not properly keep it, unle&s;s both the thing done, the manner of doing it, and all the other circum&s;tances are right. But there are a thou&s;and ways of breaking every commandment: So that this gate is wide indeed.</P>
<P N="3">3. To con&s;ider this a little more particularly. How wide do tho&s;e parent &s;ins extend, from which all the re&s;t derive their being? <HI>That car|nal mind, which is enmity again&s;t God,</HI> pride of heart, &s;elf-will, and love of the world? Can we &s;ix any bounds to them? Do they not diffu&s;e them&s;elves thro' all our thoughts, and mingle with all our tempers? Are they not the lea|ven which leavens, more or le&s;s, the whole ma&s;s of our affections? May we not, on a clo&s;e and faithful examination of our&s;elves, perceive the&s;e roots of bitterne&s;s, continually &s;pringing up, infecting all our words, and tainting all our ac|tions? And how innumerable an offspring do they bring forth, in every age and nation? Even enough to cover the whole earth with <HI>darkne&s;s and cruel habitations.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. O! who is able to reckon up their accur&s;ed fruits? To count all the &s;ins, whether again&s;t God or our neighbour, not which imagina|tion might paint, but which may be matter of daily melancholy experience? Nor need we range over all the earth to find them. Survey any one kingdom, any &s;ingle country, or city or town, and how plemeous is this harve&s;t? And let it not be one of tho&s;e, which a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="6" REF="039068_0005_1013926CC0600220">over&s;pread with mahometan or pagan darkne&s;s. But of tho&s;e which name the name of Chri&s;t, which profe&s;s to &s;ee the light of his glorious go&s;pel. Go no farther than the kingdom to which we belong, the city wherein we are now. We call our&s;elves chri&s;tians: Yea, and that of the pure&s;t &s;ort; we are prote&s;tants; reformed chri&s;tians! But alas! who &s;hall carry on the reformation of our opinions into our hearts and lives? Is there not a cau&s;e? For how innumerable are our &s;ins? And tho&s;e of the deepe&s;t dye? Do not the gro&s;&s;e&s;t abominations of every kind, abound among us from day to day? Do not &s;ins of every &s;ort cover the land, as the waters cover the &s;ea? Who can count them? Rather go and count the drops of rain, or the &s;ands on the &s;ea-&s;hore. So <HI>wide is the gate,</HI> &s;o <HI>broad is the way that leadeth to de|&s;truction.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>And many there be who go in at</HI> that gate: Many who walk in that way. Almo&s;t as many as go in at the gate of death, as &s;ink into the chambers of the grave. For it cannot be denied (though neither can we acknowledge it but with &s;hame and &s;orrow of heart) that even in this, which is called a chri&s;tian country, the ge|nerality of every age and &s;ex, of every profe&s;|&s;ion and employment, of every rank and de|gree, high and low, rich and poor, are walking in the way of de&s;truction. The far greater part of the inhabitants of this city, to this day live in &s;in; in &s;ome palpable, habitual, known tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law they profe&s;s to ob&s;erve: Yea, in &s;ome outward tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, &s;ome gro&s;s, vi&s;ible kind of ungodline&s;s or unrighteou&s;ne&s;s;
<PB N="7" REF="039068_0006_1013926E493888E0">&s;ome open violation of their duty, either to God or man. The&s;e then, none can deny, are all in the way that leadeth to de&s;truction. Add to the&s;e tho&s;e who <HI>have a name</HI> indeed <HI>that they live,</HI> but were never yet alive to God: Tho&s;e that out|wardly appear fair to men, but are inwardly full of all uncleanne&s;s: Full of pride, or vanity; of anger, or revenge; of ambition, or covetou&s;ne&s;s: lovers of them&s;elves, lovers of the world, lovers of plea&s;ure more than lovers of God. The&s;e indeed may be highly e&s;teemed of men; but they are an abomination to the Lord. And how great|ly will the&s;e &s;aints of the world, &s;well the num|ber of the children of hell? Yea, add all, what|ever they be in other re&s;pects, whether they have more or le&s;s of the form of godline&s;s, who <HI>being ignorant of God's righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;eek|ing to e&s;tabli&s;h their own righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> as the ground of their reconciliation to God and acceptance with him, of con&s;equence have <HI>not &s;ubmitted them&s;elves unto the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by faith.</HI> Now all the&s;e things joined together in one, how terribly true is our Lord's a&s;&s;ertion, <HI>Wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to de&s;truction, and many there be who go in thereat.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Nor does this only concern the vulgar herd, the poor, ba&s;e, &s;tupid part of mankind. Men of eminence in the world, men who have many fields, and yoke of oxen, do not de&s;ire to be excu&s;ed from this. On the contrary, <HI>many wi&s;e men after the fle&s;h,</HI> according to the human me|thods of judging, <HI>many mighty,</HI> in power, in courage, in riches, many <HI>noble are called:</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="039068_0007_1013926FD3B97BF8">called into the broad way, by the world, the fle&s;h and the devil; and they are not di&s;obedi|ent to that calling. Yea, the higher they are rai&s;ed in fortune and power, the deeper do they &s;ink into wickedne&s;s. The more ble&s;&s;ings they have received from God, the more &s;ins do they commit: U&s;ing their honour or riches, their learning or wi&s;dom, not as means of working out their &s;alvation, but rather of excel|ling in vice, and &s;o in&s;uring their own de&s;truc|tion.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. And the very rea&s;on why many of the&s;e go on &s;o &s;ecurely in the <HI>broad way,</HI> is becau&s;e it is broad: Not con&s;idering that this is the in&s;e|parable property of the way to de&s;truction. <HI>Many there be,</HI> &s;aith our Lord, <HI>who go in thereat:</HI> for the very rea&s;on why they &s;hould flee from it: Even <HI>be|cau&s;e &s;trait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. This is an in&s;eparable property of the way to heaven. So narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, unto life everla&s;ting; &s;o &s;trait the gate, that nothing unclean, nothing unholy can enter. No &s;inner can pa&s;s thro' that gate, un|til he is &s;aved from all his &s;ins. Not only from his outward &s;ins; from his evil <HI>conver&s;ation re|ceived by tradition from his fathers.</HI> It will not &s;uffice, that he hath <HI>cea&s;ed to do evil,</HI> and <HI>learned to do well.</HI> He mu&s;t not only be &s;aved from all &s;inful actions, and from all evil and u&s;ele&s;s di&s;|cour&s;e; but inwardly changed, throughly re|newed in the &s;pirit of his mind. Otherwi&s;e he cannot pa&s;s thro' the gate of life, he cannot en|ter into glory.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="9" REF="039068_0008_10139272E2A97960">
3. For <HI>narrow is the way that leadeth unto life.</HI> The way of univer&s;al holine&s;s. Narrow indeed is the way of poverty of &s;pirit, the way of holy mourn|ing: The way of meekne&s;s, and that of hungering and thir&s;ting after righteou&s;ne&s;s. Narrow is the way of mercifulne&s;s, of love unfeigned; the way of purity of heart; of doing good unto all men, and of gladly &s;uffering evil, all manner of evil for righteou&s;ne&s;s-&s;ake.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>And few there be that find it.</HI> Alas! how few find even the way of heathen hone&s;ty? How few are there, that do nothing to another, which they would not another &s;hould do unto them? How few, that are clear before God, from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> either of inju&s;tice or unkindne&s;s? How few that do not <HI>offend with their tongue;</HI> that &s;peak nothing unkind, nothing untrue? What a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">all propor|tion have their hearts right before God? Clean and holy in his &s;ight? Where are they, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> his all-&s;earching eye, di&s;cerns to be truly humble? To abhor them&s;elves in du&s;t and a&s;hes, in the pre&s;ence of God their Saviour? To be deeply and &s;teadily &s;erious, feeling their wants, and <HI>pa&s;&s;ing the time of their &s;ojourning with fear?</HI> Truly meek and gentle, never <HI>overcome of evil, but over|coming evil with good?</HI> Throughly athir&s;t for God, and continually panting after a renewal in his likene&s;s? How thinly are they &s;cattered over the earth, who&s;e &s;ouls are enlarged in love to all mankind? And who love God with all their &s;trength, who have given him their hearts, and de&s;ire nothing el&s;e in earth or heaven? How
<PB N="10" REF="039068_0009_1013927A0FE22598">few are tho&s;e lovers of God and man, that &s;pend their whole &s;trength in doing good unto all men? and are ready to &s;uffer all things, yea, death it&s;elf, to &s;ave one &s;oul from eternal death?</P>
<P N="5">5. But while &s;o few are found in the way of life, and &s;o many in the way of de&s;truction, there is great danger, le&s;t the torrent of ex|amples, &s;hould bear us away with them. Even as a &s;ingle example, if it be always in our &s;ight, is apt to make much impre&s;&s;ion upon us: E&s;pecially when it has nature on its &s;ide; when it falls in with our own inclinations. How great then mu&s;t be the force of &s;o numerous examples, continu|ally before our eyes; and all con&s;piring together with our own hearts, to carry us down the &s;tream of nature? How difficult mu&s;t it be, to &s;tem the tide, and to keep our&s;elves <HI>un&s;potted in the world?</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. What heightens the difficulty &s;till more is, that they are not the rude and &s;en&s;ele&s;s part of mankind, at lea&s;t not the&s;e alone, who &s;et us the example, who throng the downward way: But the polite, the well-bred, the genteel, the wi&s;e, the men who under&s;tand the world: The men of knowledge, of deep and various learning, the rational, the eloquent! The&s;e are all, or nearly all, again&s;t us. And how &s;hall we &s;tand again&s;t the&s;e? Do not their tongues drop manna? and have they not learned all the arts of &s;oft per&s;ua&s;ion? And of rea&s;oning too: For the&s;e are ver&s;ed in all controver&s;ies and &s;trife of words. It is therefore a &s;mall thing with them to prove, that the way is <HI>right,</HI> becau&s;e it is <HI>broad:</HI> That he who follows a multitude, can|not
<PB N="11" REF="039068_0010_1013927D0B5951B8">do evil, but only he who will not follow them: That your way mu&s;t be <HI>wrong,</HI> becau&s;e it is <HI>narrow;</HI> and becau&s;e there are &s;o few that find it. The&s;e will make it clear to a demon&s;tra|tion, that evil is good, and good is evil: That the way of holine&s;s is the way of de&s;truc|tion, and the way of the world, the only way to heaven.</P>
<P N="7">7. O how can unlearned and ignorant men, maintain their cau&s;e again&s;t &s;uch opponents! And yet the&s;e are not all with whom they mu&s;t contend, however unequal to the ta&s;k. For there are many mighty, and noble, and powerful men, as well as wi&s;e, in the road that leadeth to de&s;truction. And the&s;e have a &s;horter way of confuting, than that of rea&s;on and argument. They u&s;ually apply, not to the under&s;tanding, but to the fears of any that oppo&s;e them. A method that &s;eldom fails of &s;ucce&s;s, even where argument profits nothing: As lying level to the capacities of all men: For all can fear, whether they can rea&s;on or no. And all who have not a firm tru&s;t in God, a &s;ure reliance both on his power and love, cannot but fear to give any di&s;|gu&s;t to tho&s;e, who have the power of the world in their hands. What wonder therefore if the example of the&s;e is a law, to all who know not God?</P>
<P N="8">8. Many rich are likewi&s;e in the broad way. And the&s;e apply to the hopes of men; and to all their fooli&s;h de&s;ires, as &s;trongly and effectually, as the mighty and noble to their fears. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o that hardly can you hold on in the way of the king|dom, unle&s;s you are dead to all below, unle&s;s you are crucified to the world and the world cruci|fied
<PB N="12" REF="039068_0011_1013927F034CA290">to you, unle&s;s you de&s;ire nothing more but God.</P>
<P N="9">9. For how dark, how uncomfortable, how forbidding is the pro&s;pect on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide? A &s;trait gate! A narrow way! And few find|ing that gate! Few walking in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Be|&s;ides, even tho&s;e few, are not wi&s;e men, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en of learning or eloquence. They are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble to rea&s;on either &s;trongly or clearly; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot propo&s;e an argument to any advantage. They know not how to prove what they profe&s;s to be|lieve; or to explain even what they &s;ay they ex|perience. Surely &s;uch advocates as they, will ne|ver recommend, but rather di&s;credit the cau&s;e they have e&s;pou&s;ed.</P>
<P N="10">10. Add to this, that they are not noble, not honourable men: (if they were, you might bear with their folly.) They are men of no intere&s;t, no authority, of no account in the world. They are mean and ba&s;e, low in life; and &s;uch as have no power, if they had the will to hurt you. Therefore there is nothing at all to be &s;eared from them: And there is nothing at all to hope. For the greater part of them may &s;ay, <HI>Silver and gold have I none:</HI> at lea&s;t a very mo|derate &s;hare. Nay, &s;ome of them have &s;carcely food to eat or raiment to put on. For this rea&s;on, as well as becau&s;e their ways are not like tho&s;e of other men, they are every where &s;poken again&s;t, are de&s;pi&s;ed, have their names ca&s;t out as evil, are variou&s;ly per&s;ecuted, and treated as the filth and off-&s;couring of the world. So that both your fears, your hopes, and all your de&s;ires (except tho&s;e which you have immedi|ately from God) yea, all your natural pa&s;&s;ions
<PB N="13" REF="039068_0012_10139281DFE83298">continually incline you to return into the broad way.</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. Therefore it is, that our Lord &s;o ear|ne&s;tly exhorts, <HI>Enter ye in at the &s;trait gate.</HI> Or (as the &s;ame exhortation is el&s;ewhere expre&s;&s;ed) <HI>Stri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> enter in.</HI>
<GAP DESC="foreign">. Strive as in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">. <HI>For many,</HI> &s;aith our Lord, <HI>&s;hall &s;eek <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in,</HI> indolently &s;trive, <HI>and &s;hall not be able.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. 'Tis true, he intimates what may &s;eem an|other rea&s;on for this, for their <HI>not being able to enter in,</HI> in the words which immediately follow the&s;e. For after he had &s;aid, <HI>Many, I &s;ay unto you, will &s;eek to enter in, and &s;hall not leable,</HI> he &s;ubjoins, <HI>When once the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e is ri&s;en up and hath &s;hut to the door, and ye begin to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d without</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign">. Rather, <HI>Ye &s;tand with|out;</HI> for
<GAP DESC="foreign"> &s;eems to be only an elegant expletive) <HI>and to knock at the door, &s;aying, Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Lord, open unto us:</HI> He <HI>&s;hall an&s;wer and &s;ay unto you, I know ye not. Depart from me all ye worker<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of iniquity.</HI> Luke xiii. 26, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. It may appear, upon a tran&s;ient view of the&s;e words, that their delaying to &s;eek <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> rather than their manner of &s;eeking, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> rea&s;on why they were not able to enter in. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it comes, in effect, to the &s;ame thing. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were therefore commanded to depart, becau&s;e they had been <HI>workers of iniquity,</HI> becau&s;e they had walked in the broad road: In other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Becau&s;e they had not agonized to enter in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;trait gate. Probably they did <HI>&s;eek,</HI> before the door was &s;hut: But that did not &s;uffice. And
<PB N="14" REF="039068_0013_1013928664AA0450">they did <HI>&s;trive,</HI> after the door was &s;hut. But then it was too late.</P>
<P N="4">4. Therefore, <HI>&s;trive</HI> ye now, in this your day, <HI>to enter in at the &s;trait gate.</HI> And in order here|to, &s;ettle it in your heart, and let it be ever uppermo&s;t in your thoughts, That if you are in a broad way, you are in the way that leadeth to de&s;truction. If many go with you, as &s;ure as God is true, both they and you are going to hell. If you are walking as the generality of men walk, you are walking to the bottomle&s;s pit. Are many wi&s;e, many rich, many mighty or noble travelling with you in the &s;ame way? By this token, without going any farther, you know, it does not lead to life. Here is a &s;hort, a plain, an infallible rule, before you enter into particulars. In whatever profe&s;&s;ion you are en|gaged, you mu&s;t be &s;ingular or be damned. The way to hell has nothing &s;ingular in it; but the way to heaven is &s;ingularity all over: If you move but one &s;tep towards God, you are not as other men are. But regard not this. 'Tis far better to &s;tand alone, than to fall into the pit. Run then with patience the race which is &s;et be|fore thee, tho' thy companions therein are but few. They will not always be &s;o.

<P N="1">1. IT is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s or con|ceive, what multitudes of &s;ouls run on to de&s;truction, becau&s;e they would not be per|&s;uaded to walk in a <HI>narrow</HI> way, even though it were the way to everla&s;ting &s;alvation. And
<PB N="18" REF="039068_0016_1013928C8D6AFB78">the &s;ame thing we may &s;till ob&s;erve daily. Such is the folly and madne&s;s of mankind, that thou|&s;ands of men &s;till ru&s;h on in the way to hell, on|ly becau&s;e it is a broad way. They walk in it them&s;elves, becau&s;e others do: Becau&s;e &s;o many peri&s;h they will add to the number. Such is the amazing influence of example, over the weak, mi&s;erable children of men! It continually peoples the regions of death, and drowns numberle&s;s &s;ouls in everla&s;ting perdition.</P>
<P N="2">2. To warn mankind of this, to guard as many as po&s;&s;ible again&s;t this &s;preading contagion, God has commanded his watchmen to cry a|loud, and &s;hew the people the danger they are in. For this end he has &s;ent his &s;ervants the prophets, in their &s;ucceeding generations, to point out the narrow path, and exhort all men, not to be conformed to this world. But what if the watchmen them&s;elves fall into the &s;nare, a|gain&s;t which they &s;hould warn others? What if <HI>the prophets prophe&s;y deceits?</HI> If they <HI>cau&s;e the people to err from the way?</HI> What &s;hall be done if they point out as the way to eternal life, what is in truth the way to eternal death? And ex|hort others to walk, as they do them&s;elves, in the broad, not the narrow way.</P>
<P N="3">3. Is this an unheard of, is it an uncommon thing? Nay, God knoweth, it is not. The in&s;tances of it are almo&s;t innumerable. We may find them in every age and nation. But how terrible is this? When the amba&s;&s;adors of God, turn agents for the devil? When they who are commi&s;&s;ioned to teach men the way to heaven, do in fact teach them the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y to hell? The&s;e are like the locu&s;ts of <HI>Egypt, which eat up

<P N="4">4. A caution this of the utmo&s;t importance. That it may the more effectually &s;ink into our hearts, let us inquire, Fir&s;t, who the&s;e fal&s;e pro|phets are, Secondly, what appearance they put on, and Thirdly, how we may know what they really are, notwith&s;tanding their fair appear|ance.</P>
<P N="1">I. 1. We are, Fir&s;t, to inquire, who the&s;e fal&s;e prophets are. And this it is needful to do the more diligently, becau&s;e the&s;e very men have &s;o laboured to <HI>wre&s;t this &s;cripture, to their own</HI> (though not only their own) <HI>de&s;truction.</HI> In order therefore to cut off all di&s;pute, I &s;hall rai&s;e no du&s;t (as the manner of &s;ome is) neither u&s;e any loo&s;e, rhetorical exclamations, to deceive the hearts of the &s;imple, but &s;peak &s;ough, plain truths, &s;uch as none can deny, who has either under&s;tanding or mode&s;ty le&s;t: And &s;uch truths as have the clo&s;e&s;t connection, wi&s;h the whole tenor of the preceding di&s;cour&s;e. Whereas too many have interpreted the&s;e words, with|out any regard to all that went before: A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> if they bore no manner of relation to the &s;ermon, in the clo&s;e of which they &s;tand.</P>
<P N="2">2. By <HI>prophets</HI> here (as in many other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, particularly in the New Te&s;tament)
<PB N="20" REF="039068_0018_10139296596D6A28">are meant not tho&s;e who foretell things to come, but tho&s;e who &s;peak in the name of God: Tho&s;e men who profe&s;s to be &s;ent of God, to teach others the way to heaven.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e are <HI>fal&s;e prophets,</HI> who teach a fal&s;e way to heaven, a way which does not lead thither. Or (which comes in the end to the &s;ame point) who do not teach the true.</P>
<P N="3">3. Every broad way is infallibly a fal&s;e one. Therefore this is one plain, &s;ure rule, "They who teach men to walk in a broad way, a way that many walk in, are <HI>fal&s;e prophets.</HI>"</P>
<P>Again, the true way to heaven is a narrow way. Therefore this is another plain, &s;ure rule, "They who do not teach men to walk in a narrow way, to be &s;ingular, are <HI>fal&s;e pro|phets.</HI>"</P>
<P N="4">4. To be more particular. The only true way to heaven, is that pointed out in the pre|ceding &s;ermon. Therefore they are <HI>fal&s;e pro|phets</HI> who do not teach men to walk in <HI>this way.</HI></P>
<P>Now the way to heaven pointed out in the preceding &s;ermon, is the way of lowline&s;s, mourning, meekne&s;s, and holy, de&s;ire, love of God and of our neighbour, doing good, and &s;uffering evil for Chri&s;t's &s;ake. They are there|fore fal&s;e prophets, who teach as the way to heaven, any other way than <HI>this.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. It matters not, what they call that other way. They may call it <HI>faith,</HI> or <HI>good works:</HI> Or <HI>faith and works:</HI> Or <HI>repentance:</HI> Or <HI>re|pentance, faith and new obedience.</HI> All the&s;e are good words. But if under the&s;e, or any other terms whatever, they teach men any way di&s;|&s;tinct from <HI>this,</HI> they are properly <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> prophets.</HI></P>
<P N="6"><PB N="21" REF="039068_0019_101392986E721B30">
6. How much more do they fall under that condemnation, who &s;peak evil of this good way? But above all, they who teach the di|rectly oppo&s;ite way? The way of pride, of levity, of pa&s;&s;ion, of worldly de&s;ires, of loving plea&s;ure more than God, of unkindne&s;s, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> neighbour, of unconcern for good works, and &s;uffering no evil, no per&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ecutions for righteou&s;|ne&s;s-&s;ake?</P>

I an&s;wer, Ten thou&s;and wi&s;e and honourable men: Even all tho&s;e, of whatever denomina|tion, who encourage the proud, the trifler, the pa&s;&s;ionate, the lover of the world, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of plea&s;ure, the unju&s;t or unkind, the ea&s;y, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> le&s;s, harmle&s;s, u&s;ele&s;s creature, the man who &s;uffers no repooach for righteou&s;ne&s;s' &s;ake, to imagine he is in the way to heaven. The&s;e are fal&s;e prophets in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word. The&s;e are traitors both to God and man. The&s;e are no other than the fir&s;t born of Satan: The olde&s;t &s;ons of Apollyon, the de|&s;troyer, The&s;e are far above, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nk of ordi|nary cut throats; for they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ouls of men.

<P N="2">II. 1. But do they come now, in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hape? By no means. If it were &s;o, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not de&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. You would take the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for your life. Therefore they put on a quite
<PB N="22" REF="039068_0020_1013929A17AA26B8">contrary appearance: (which was the &s;econd thing to be con&s;idered.) <HI>They come to you in &s;heep's cloathing,</HI> although <HI>inwardly they are ravening wolves.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They come to you in &s;heep's cloathing;</HI> that is, with an appearance of harmle&s;&s;ne&s;s. They come in the mo&s;t mild, inoffen&s;ive manner, without any mark or token of enmity. Who can imagine, that the&s;e quiet creatures, would do any hurt to any one? Perhaps they may not be &s;o zealous and active in doing good, as one would wi&s;h they were. However, you &s;ee no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that they have even the de|&s;ire to do any harm. But this is not all:</P>
<P N="3">3. They come, Secondly, with an appear|ance of u&s;efulne&s;s. Indeed to this, to do good they are particularly called. They are &s;et apart for this very thing. They are particularly com|mi&s;&s;ioned, to watch over your &s;oul and to train you up to eternal life. 'Tis their whole bu&s;ine&s;s, to <HI>go about doing good, and healing tho&s;e that are oppre&s;&s;ed of the devil.</HI> And you have been always accu&s;tomed to look upon them in this light, as me&s;&s;engers of God, &s;ent to bring you a ble&s;&s;|ing.</P>
<P N="4">4. They come, Thirdly with an appearance of religion. All they do, is for con&s;cience &s;ake! They a&s;&s;ure you, it is out of mere zeal for God, that they are making God a liar. It is but of pure concern for religion, that they would de|&s;troy it, root and branch, All they &s;peak, is only from a love of truth, and a fear le&s;t it &s;hould &s;uffer. And, it may be, from a regard for the church, and a de&s;ire to defend her from all her enemies.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="23" REF="039068_0021_1013929E755A10D8">
5. Above all they come with an appearance of love. They take all the&s;e pains, only for <HI>your</HI> good. They &s;hould not trouble them&s;elves about you, but that they have a kindne&s;s for you. They will make large profe&s;&s;ions of their good|will, of their concern for the danger you are in, and of their earne&s;t de&s;ire, to pre&s;erve you from error, from being entangled in new and mi&s;|chievous doctrines. They &s;hould be very &s;orry to &s;ee one who <HI>means</HI> &s;o well, hurried into any extreme, perplexed with &s;trange and unintelligi|ble notions, or deluded into enthu&s;ia&s;m. There|fore it is, that they advi&s;e you, to keep &s;till, in the plain middle way: And to beware of <HI>being righteous overmuch,</HI> le&s;t you &s;hould <HI>de&s;troy your|&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. 1. But how many we know, what they really are, notwith&s;tanding their fair appearance? This was the third thing into which it was pre|po&s;ed to inquire.</P>
<P>Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord &s;aw how needful it was for all men to know <HI>fal&s;e prophets,</HI> however di&s;gui&s;ed. He &s;aw likewi&s;e, how unable mo&s;t men were, to deduce a truth thro' a long train of con&s;equen|ces. He therefore gives us a &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t and plain rule, ea&s;y to be under&s;tood by men of the mean|e&s;t capacities, and ea&s;y to be applied upon all occa&s;ions. <HI>Ye &s;hall know them by their fruits.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Upon all occa&s;ions you may ea&s;ily apply this rule. In order to know whether any who &s;peak in the name of God, are fal&s;e or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> prophets, it is ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, Fir&s;t, what are the fruits of their doctrine, as to them&s;elves? What effect has it had upon their lives? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="24" REF="039068_0022_101392A2AFECF390">they holy and unblamable in all things? What effect has it had upon their hearts? Does it ap|pear by the general tenor of their conver&s;ation that their tempers are holy, heavenly, divine? That the mind is in them which was in Chri&s;t Je&s;us? That they are meek, lowly, patient lovers of God and man, and zealous of good works?</P>
<P N="3">3. You may ea&s;ily ob&s;erve, Secondly, What are the fruits of their doctrine, as to tho&s;e that hear them? In many, at lea&s;t, though not in all: For the apo&s;tles them&s;elves did not convert all that heard them. Have the&s;e the mind that was in Chri&s;t? And do they walk as he al&s;o walked? And was it by hearing the&s;e men, that they be|gan &s;o to do? Were they inwardly and outwardly wicked, till they heard them? If &s;o, it is a mani|fe&s;t proof, That tho&s;e are true prophets, teachers &s;ent of God. But if it is not &s;o, if they do not effectually teach either them&s;elves or others to love and &s;erve God; it is a manife&s;t proof, that they are fal&s;e prophets; that God hath not &s;ent them.</P>
<P N="4">4. An hard &s;aying this! How few can bear it? This our Lord was &s;en&s;ible of, and therefore con|de&s;cends to prove it at large, by &s;everal clear and convincing arguments. <HI>Do men,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>ga|ther grapes of thorns or figs of thi&s;tles?</HI> v. 16. Do you expect that the&s;e evil men &s;hould bring forth good fruit? As well might you expect that thorns &s;hould bring forth grapes, or that figs &s;hould grow upon thi&s;tles! <HI>Every good Tree bringeth forth good fruit: but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</HI> v. 17. Every true pro|phet, every teacher whom I have &s;em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bringeth forth the good fruit of holine&s;s. But a fal&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="039068_0023_101392A43794D608">prophet, a teacher whom I have not &s;ent, brings forth only &s;in and wickedne&s;s. <HI>A good tree can|not bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</HI> A true prophet, a teacher &s;ent from God, does not bring forth good fruit, &s;ometimes only, but always; not accidentally, but by a kind of nece&s;&s;ity. In like manner, a fal&s;e prophet, one whom God hath not &s;ent, does not bring forth evil fruit, acci|dentally or &s;ometimes only, but always and of nece&s;&s;ity. <HI>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down and ca&s;t into the fire.</HI> v. 19. Such infallibly will be the lot of tho&s;e prophets, who bring not forth good fruit, who do not &s;ave &s;ouls from &s;in, who do not bring &s;inners to repentance. <HI>Wherefore</HI> let this &s;tand as an eter|nal rule, <HI>By their fruits ye &s;hall know them.</HI> v. 20. They who in fact bring the proud, pa&s;&s;ionate, unmerciful lovers of the world, to be lowly, gentle lovers of God and man: They are true prophets, they are &s;ent from God, who there|fore confirms their word. On the other hand, they who&s;e hearers, if unrighteous before, re|main unrighteous &s;till, or at lea&s;t, void of any righteou&s;ne&s;s which <HI>exceeds the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees:</HI> They are fal&s;e prophets; they are not &s;ent of God: therefore their word falls to the ground. And without a miracle of grace they and their hearers together, will fall into the bottomle&s;s pit.</P>
<P N="5">5. O <HI>beware of</HI> the&s;e <HI>fal&s;e prophets!</HI> For though they <HI>come in &s;heep's clothing,</HI> yet <HI>inwardly they are ravening wolves.</HI> They only de&s;troy and devour the flock: They tear them in pieces, if there be none to help them. They will not, cannot lead
<PB N="26" REF="039068_0024_101392A73828F7E8">you in the way to heaven. How &s;hould they? When they know it not them&s;elves. O beware they do not turn you out of the way, and cau&s;e you to <HI>lo&s;e what you have wrought.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. But perhaps you will a&s;k, If there be &s;uch danger in hearing them, ought I to hear them at all? It is a weighty que&s;tion, &s;uch as de&s;erves the deepe&s;t con&s;ideration, and ought not to be an&s;wered, but upon the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ue&s;t though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, the mo&s;t deliberate reflection. For many years, I have been almo&s;t afraid, to &s;peak at all concern|ing it: Being unable to determine one way or the other, or to give any judgment upon it. Many rea&s;ons there are which readily occur, and incline me to &s;ay, "Hear them not." And yet what our Lord &s;peaks concerning the fal&s;e prophets of his own times, &s;eems to imply th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> contrary. <HI>Then &s;pake Je&s;us unto the multitude and to his di&s;ciples, &s;aying, The Scribes and the Pha|ri&s;es &s;et in</HI> Mo&s;es' <HI>&s;eat,</HI> are the ordinary, &s;tated teachers in your church: <HI>All therefore what&s;o|ever they bid you ob&s;erve, that ob&s;erve and do. But do not ye after their works; for they &s;ay and do not.</HI> Now that the&s;e were fal&s;e prophets in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e, our Lord had &s;hewn during the whole cour&s;e of his mini&s;try: As indeed he does in tho&s;e very words, <HI>They &s;ay, and do not.</HI> There|fore by their fruits his di&s;ciples could not but know them, &s;eeing they were open to the view of all men. Accordingly he warns them again and again, to <HI>beware of fal&s;e prophets.</HI> And yet he does not forbid them to hear even the&s;e. Nay, he in effect commands them &s;o to do, in tho&s;e words, <HI>All therefore what&s;oever they bid you ob&s;erve, that ob&s;erve and do.</HI> For unle&s;s they heard
<PB N="27" REF="039068_0025_101392AA628DDB10">them, they could not know, much le&s;s <HI>ob&s;erve what|&s;oever they bade them do.</HI> Here then our Lord him|&s;elf gives a plain direction, both to his apo&s;tles and the whole multitude, in &s;ome circum&s;tances, to hear even fal&s;e prophets, known and acknow|ledge &s;o to be.</P>
<P N="7">7. But perhaps it will be &s;aid, he only directed to hear them, when they read the &s;cripture to the congregation. I an&s;wer, at the &s;ame time that they thus read the &s;cripture, they generally expounded it too. And here is no kind of intimation, that they were to hear the one, and not the other al&s;o. Nay the very terms, <HI>All things what&s;oever they bid you ob&s;erve,</HI> exclude any &s;uch limitation.</P>
<P N="8">8. Again, unto them, unto fal&s;e prophets, undeniably &s;uch, is frequently committed (O grief to &s;peak! For &s;urely the&s;e things ought not &s;o to be) the admini&s;tration of the &s;acra|ments al&s;o. To direct men therefore, not to hear them, would be in effect to cut them off from the ordinances of God. But this we dare not do, con&s;idering the validity of the or|dinance doth not depend on the goodne&s;s of him that admini&s;ters, but on the faithfulne&s;s of him that ordained it, who will and doth meet us in his appointed ways. Therefore on this account likewi&s;e I &s;cruple to &s;ay, hear not even the fal&s;e prophets. Even by the&s;e who are under a cur&s;e them&s;elves, God can, and doth give us his ble&s;&s;ing. For the bread which they break we have experimentally known to be <HI>the Communion of he body of Chri&s;t.</HI> And the cup which God ble&s;t even by their unhallowed lips, was to us the communion of the blood of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="28" REF="039068_0026_101392ABEE93A520">
9. All therefore which I can &s;ay is this: In any particular ca&s;e, wait upon God by humble and earne&s;t prayer, and then act according to the be&s;t light you have.

<P N="1">I. 1. And, Fir&s;t, I am to con&s;ider the ca&s;e of him who builds his hou&s;e upon the &s;and.

We may &s;peak good of his name; and declare his loving-kindne&s;s to the children of men.

<P N="3">III. 1. How nearly then does it concern every child of man, practically to apply the&s;e things to him&s;elf? Diligently to examine, on what foundation he builds, whether on a rock or on the &s;and? How deeply are <HI>you</HI> concerned to in|quire, what is the foundation of <HI>my</HI> hope? Whereon do I build my expectation of entering into the kingdom of heaven? Is it not built on the &s;and? Upon my <HI>orthodoxy</HI> or right opinions (which by a gro&s;s abu&s;e of wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I have called <HI>faith!</HI>) Upon my having a &s;et of notions (&s;uppo&s;e more rational or &s;criptural than many others have.) Alas! What m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dne&s;s is this? Surely this is building on the &s;and: Or rather on the froth of the &s;ea! Say, I am con|vinced
<PB N="43" REF="039068_0040_101392D81CBEBFD8">of this. Am I not again building my hope on what is equally unable to &s;upport it? Perhaps on my belonging to "&s;o excellent a church: reformed after the true &s;cripture-model: Ble&s;t with the pure&s;t doctrines, the mo&s;t primi|tive liturgy, the mo&s;t apo&s;tolical form of go|vernment." The&s;e are doubtle&s;s &s;o many rea|&s;ons for prai&s;ing God, as they may be &s;o many helps to holine&s;s. But they are not holine&s;s it|&s;elf. And if they are &s;eparate from it, they will profit me nothing. Nay, they will leave me the more without excu&s;e, and expo&s;ed to the greater damnation. Therefore if I build my hope up|on this foundation, I am &s;till building upon the &s;and.</P>
<P N="2">2. You cannot, you dare not re&s;t here. Upon what next will you build your hope of &s;alva|tion? Upon your innocence? Upon your do|ing no harm? Your not wronging or hurting any one? Well; allow this plea to be true. You are ju&s;t in all your dealings: You are a downright hone&s;t man. You pay every man his own: You neither cheat, nor extort: You act fairly with all mankind. And you have a con|&s;cience towards God: You do not live in any known &s;in. Thus far is well. But &s;till it is not the thing. You may go thus far, and yet never come to heaven. When all this harmle&s;&s;ne&s;s flows from a right principle, it is the <HI>lea&s;t part</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> religion of Chri&s;t. But in you it does not flow from a right principle, and therefore is no part at all of religion. So that in grounding your hope of &s;alvation on this, you are &s;till building upon the &s;and.</P>

3. Do you go farther yet? Do you add to the doing no harm, the attending all the ordinan|ces of God? Do you at all opportunities par|take of the Lord's &s;upper? U&s;e public and private prayer?

<P>Wherefore the Law is holy, and the Commandment holy, and ju&s;t, and good.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. PERHAPS there are few &s;ubjects within the whole compa&s;s of religion, &s;o little under&s;tood as this. The reader of this epi&s;tle is u&s;ually told, by <HI>the law</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> means the <HI>Jew|i&s;h law:</HI> And &s;o apprehending him&s;elf to have no concern therewith, pa&s;&s;es on without farther thought about it. Indeed &s;ome are not &s;atisfied with this account: But ob&s;erving the epi&s;tle is directed to the <HI>Romans,</HI> thence infer, that the apo|&s;tle in the beginning of this chapter, alludes to the old <HI>Roman law.</HI> But as they have no more concern with this, than with the <HI>ceremonial law</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> &s;o they &s;pend not much thought, on what they &s;uppo&s;e is occa&s;ionally mentioned, bare|ly to illu&s;trate another thing.</P>
<P N="2">2. But a careful ob&s;erver of the apo&s;tle's di&s;|cour&s;e, will not be content with the&s;e &s;light ex|plications of it. And the more he weighs the words, the more convinced he will be, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> by <HI>the law</HI> mentioned in this chapter, does not mean either the ancient law of <HI>Rome,</HI> or the ceremonial law of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> This will clearly ap|pear
<PB N="52" REF="039068_0048_101392F40705B2F0">to all who attentively con&s;ider the tenor of his di&s;cour&s;e. He begins the chapter, <HI>Know ye not, brethren (for I &s;peak to them that know the low,</HI> to them who have been in&s;tructed therein from their youth) <HI>That the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?</HI> ver. 1. (What, the law of <HI>Rome</HI> only, or the <HI>ceremonial</HI> law? No &s;urely; but the <HI>moral</HI> law) <HI>for,</HI> to give a plain in&s;tance, <HI>the woman that hath an hu&s;band, is bound by the</HI> (moral) <HI>law to her hu&s;band as long as he liveth. But if her hu&s;band be dead, &s;he is loo&s;ed from the law of her hu&s;band.</HI> ver. 2. <HI>So then, if while her hu&s;band liveth, &s;he be married to another man, &s;he &s;hall be called an adultre&s;s: But if her hu&s;band be dead, &s;he is free from that law, &s;o that &s;he is no adultre&s;s, though &s;he be married to another man.</HI> ver. 3. From this particular in&s;tance the apo&s;tle pro|ceeds to draw that general conclu&s;ion. <HI>Where|fore, my brethren,</HI> by a plain parity of rea&s;on, <HI>ye al&s;o are become dead to the law,</HI> the whole <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> in&s;titution, <HI>by the body of Chri&s;t</HI> offered for you, and bringing you under a new di&s;pen&s;ation: <HI>That ye &s;hould</HI> without any blame <HI>be married to another, even to him who is rai&s;ed from the dead,</HI> and hath thereby given proof of his authority to make the change, <HI>that ye &s;hould bring forth fruit unto God.</HI> ver. 4. And this we can do now, whereas before we could not: <HI>For when we were in the fle&s;h,</HI> un|der the power of the fle&s;h, that is, of corrupt nature (which was nece&s;&s;arily the ca&s;e till we knew the power of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection <HI>the mo|tions of &s;in, which were by the law,</HI> which were &s;hewn and inflamed by the <HI>mo&s;aic</HI> law, not con|quered, <HI>did work in our members,</HI> broke out vari|ous ways, <HI>to bring forth fruit unto death.</HI> ver. 5. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="53" REF="039068_0049_101392F5901A9AB8">now we are delivered from the law,</HI> from that whole moral as well as ceremonial oeconomy; <HI>that being dead whereby we were held:</HI> That entire in&s;titu|tion being now as it were dead, and having no more authority over us, than the hu&s;band when dead hath over his wife: <HI>That we &s;hould &s;erve him</HI> who died for us and ro&s;e again, <HI>in newne&s;s of &s;pi|rit,</HI> in a new &s;piritual di&s;pen&s;ation, <HI>and not in the oldne&s;s of the letter,</HI> ver. 6. with a bare outward &s;ervice, according to the letter of the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> in|&s;titution.</P>
<P N="3">3. The apo&s;tle having gone thus far, in prov|ing that the chri&s;tian had &s;et a&s;ide the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation, and that the moral law it&s;elf, though it could never pa&s;s away, yet &s;tood on a different foundation from what it did before, now &s;tops to propo&s;e and an&s;wer an objection. <HI>What &s;hall we &s;ay then? Is the law &s;in?</HI> So &s;ome might in|fer from a mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of tho&s;e words, <HI>the motions of &s;in which were by the law. God forbid!</HI> &s;aith the apo&s;tle, that we &s;hould &s;ay &s;o. Nay, the law is an irreconcileable enemy to &s;in; &s;earching it out wherever it is. <HI>I had not known &s;in but by the law. I had not known lu&s;t,</HI> evil de|&s;ire to be &s;in, <HI>except the law had &s;aid, Thou &s;halt not covet,</HI> ver. 7. After opening this farther in the four following ver&s;es, he &s;ubjoins this gene|ral conclu&s;ion, with regard more e&s;pecially to the moral law, from which the preceding in&s;tance was taken: <HI>Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and ju&s;t and good.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. In order to explain and enforce the&s;e deep words, &s;o little regarded, becau&s;e &s;o little un|der&s;tood, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, Fir&s;t, The original of this law; Secondly, The nature
<PB N="54" REF="039068_0050_101392F86BEBE580">thereof; Thirdly, The properties, that it is <HI>holy and ju&s;t and good;</HI> and Fourthly, the u&s;es of it.</P>
<P N="1">I. 1. I &s;hall, Fir&s;t, endeavour to &s;hew the ori|ginal of the moral law, often called <HI>the law,</HI> by way of eminence. Now, this is not, as &s;ome may po&s;&s;ibly have imagined, of &s;o late an in&s;ti|tution as the time of <HI>Mo&s;es. Noah</HI> declared it to men long before that time, and <HI>Enoch</HI> before him. But we may trace its original higher &s;till, even beyond the foundation of the world, to that period, unknown indeed to men, but doubtle&s;s enrolled in the annals of eternity, when <HI>the morning &s;tars</HI> fir&s;t <HI>&s;ang together,</HI> being newly call|ed into exi&s;tence. It plea&s;ed the great Creator to make the&s;e his fir&s;t born &s;ons, intelligent beings, that they might know him that created them. For this end he endued them with under&s;tand|ing, to di&s;cern truth from fal&s;ehood, good from evil: And as a nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of this, with liberty, a capacity of chu&s;ing the one and re|fu&s;ing the other. By this they were likewi&s;e en|abled to offer him a free and willing &s;ervice: A &s;ervice rewardable in it&s;elf, as well as mo&s;t accept|able to their gracious ma&s;ter.</P>
<P N="2">2. To employ all the faculties which he had given them, particularly their under&s;tanding and liberty, he gave them a law, a complete mo|del of all truth, &s;o far as intelligible to a finite being, and of all good, &s;o far as angelic minds were capable of embracing it. It was al&s;o the de&s;ign of their beneficent Governor herein, to make way for a continual increa&s;e of their hap|pine&s;s: Seeing every in&s;tance of obedience <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o that law, would both add to the perfection of
<PB N="55" REF="039068_0051_101392FA20D47AE0">their nature, and entitle them to an higher re|ward, which the righteous judge would give in its &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P N="3">3. In like manner, when God in his appoint|ed time, had created a new order of intelligent beings, when he had rai&s;ed man from the du&s;t of the earth, breathed into him the breath of life, and cau&s;ed him to become a living &s;oul, endued with power to chu&s;e good or evil: He gave to this free, intelligent creature, the &s;ame law as to his fir&s;t-born children: Not wrote in|deed upon tables of &s;tone, or any corruptible &s;ub&s;tance, but engraven on his heart by the finger of God, wrote in the inmo&s;t &s;pirit both of men and of angels: To the intent it might never be afar off, never hard to be under&s;tood; but always at hand, and always &s;hining with clear light, even as the &s;un in the mid&s;t of heaven.</P>
<P N="4">4. Such was the original of the law of God. With regard to man, it was coeval with his nature. But with regard to the elder &s;ons of God, it &s;hone in its full &s;plendor, <HI>or ever the mountains were brought forth, or the earth and the round world were made.</HI> But it was not long be|fore man rebelled again&s;t God, and by breaking this glorious law, well nigh effaced it out of his heart; <HI>the eyes of his under&s;tanding</HI> being <HI>darkened,</HI> in the &s;ame mea&s;ure as his &s;oul was <HI>alienated from the life of God.</HI> And yet God did not de|&s;pi&s;e the work of his own hands: But being reconciled to man through the Son of his love, he, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, re-in&s;cribed his aw on the heart of his dark, &s;inful creature. <HI>He</HI> again <HI>&s;howed thee, O man, what is good</HI> (although not as

<P N="5">5. If we &s;urvey the law of God in another point of view, it is &s;upreme, unchangeable rea|&s;on: It is unalterable rectitude: It is the over|la&s;ting fitne&s;s of all things that are or ever were created.

<P N="3">III. 1. Such is the nature of the ever-ble&s;&s;ed law of God. I am, in the third place, to &s;how the properties of it: Not all; for that would exceed the wi&s;dom of an angel.

It is pure from all &s;in, clean and un&s;pot|ted from any touch of evil. It is a cha&s;te virgin incapable of any de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ement, of any mixture with that which is unclean or unholy. It has no fellow&s;hip with &s;in of any kind. For <HI>what com|munion hath light with darkne&s;s?</HI> As &s;in is in its very nature enmity to God, &s;o his law is enmity to &s;in.</P>
<P N="4">4. Therefore it is, that the apo&s;tle rejects with &s;uch abhorrence, that bla&s;phemous &s;uppo|&s;ition, that <HI>the law</HI> of God <HI>is</HI> either <HI>&s;in</HI> it&s;elf, or the cau&s;e of &s;in. <HI>God forbid,</HI> that we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, it is the cau&s;e of &s;in, becau&s;e it is the di&s;coverer of it: Becau&s;e it detects the hidden things of darkne&s;s, and drags them out into open day. It is true, by this means (as the apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, ver. 13.) <HI>Sin appears to be &s;in.</HI> All its di&s;gui&s;es are torn away, and it appears in its native deformity. It is true likewi&s;e, that <HI>&s;in by the commandment becomes exceeding &s;inful.</HI> Being now committed again&s;t light and know|ledge, being &s;tript even of the poor plea of ig|norance, it lo&s;es its excu&s;e as well as di&s;gui&s;e, and becomes far more odious both to God and man. Yea, and it is true, that <HI>&s;in worketh death by that which is good,</HI> which it&s;elf is pure
<PB N="61" REF="039068_0057_1013930F7076D858">and holy. When it is dragged out to light, it rages the more: When it is re&s;trained, it bur&s;ts out with greater violence. Thus the apo&s;tle (&s;peaking in the per&s;on of one, who was con|vinced of &s;in, but not yet delivered from it) <HI>Sin taking occa&s;ion by the commandment,</HI> detecting and endeavouring to re&s;train it, di&s;dained the re|&s;traint, and &s;o much the more <HI>wrought in me all manner of concupi&s;cence,</HI> ver. 8. All manner of fooli&s;h and hurtful de&s;ire, which that com|mandment &s;ought to re&s;train. Thus, <HI>when the commandment came, &s;in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ived,</HI> ver. 9. It fretted and raged the more. But this is no &s;tain on the commandment. Though it is abu&s;ed it cannot be defiled. This only proves, that <HI>the heart</HI> of man <HI>is de&s;perately wicked.</HI> But <HI>the law</HI> of God is <HI>holy</HI> &s;till.</P>
<P N="5">5. And it is, Secondly, <HI>ju&s;t.</HI> It renders to all their due. It pre&s;cribes exactly what is right, preci&s;ely what ought to be done, &s;aid, or thought both with regard to the author of our being, with regard to our&s;elves, and with regard to every creature which he has made. It is adapted in all re&s;pects to the nature of things, of the whole univer&s;e and every individual. It is &s;uited to all the circum&s;tances of each, and to all their mutual relations, whether &s;uch as have exi&s;ted from the beginning, or &s;uch as commenced in any follow|ing period. It is exactly agreeable to the fit|ne&s;&s;es of things, whether e&s;&s;ential or accidental. It cla&s;hes with none of the&s;e in any degree; nor is ever unconnected with them. If the word be taken in that &s;en&s;e, there is nothing <HI>arbitrary</HI> in the law of God. Although &s;till the whole and every part thereof, is totally dependent upon his
<PB N="62" REF="039068_0058_101393129205B560">will: So that <HI>thy will be done,</HI> is the &s;upreme, univer&s;al law both in earth and heaven.</P>
<P N="6">6. "But is the will of God the cau&s;e of his law? Is his will the original of right and wrong? Is a thing therefore right, becau&s;e God wills it? Or does he will it, becau&s;e it is right?"</P>
<P>I fear, this celebrated que&s;tion is more curious than u&s;eful. And perhaps, in the manner it is u&s;ually treated of, it does not &s;o well con&s;i&s;t with the regard that is due from a creature, to the Creator and Governor of all things. It is hardly decent from man, to call the &s;upreme God to give an account to him! Neverthele&s;s, with awe and reverence we may &s;peak a little. The Lord pardon us, if we &s;peak ami&s;s!</P>
<P N="7">7. It &s;eems then, that the whole difficulty ari&s;es, from con&s;idering God's will as di&s;tinct from God. Otherwi&s;e it vani&s;hes away. For none can doubt, but God is the cau&s;e of the law of God. But the will of God is God him&s;elf. It is God con&s;idered as willing thus or thus. Con&s;equently, to &s;ay, That the will of God, or that God him&s;elf is the cau&s;e of the law, is one and the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P N="8">8. Again; If the law, the immutable rule of right and wrong, depends on the nature and fitne&s;&s;es of things, and on their e&s;&s;ential re|lations to each other: (I do not &s;ay, their eternal relations; becau&s;e the eternal relations of things exi&s;ting in time, is little le&s;s than a contra|diction:) If, I &s;ay, this depends on the nature and relations of things, then it mu&s;t depend on God, or the will of God: Becau&s;e tho&s;e things them&s;elves, with all their relations, are
<PB N="63" REF="039068_0059_101393173120FB08">the work of his hands. By his will, <HI>for his plea&s;ure</HI> alone, <HI>they all</HI> are <HI>and were created.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. And yet it may be granted (which is pro|bably all that a con&s;iderate per&s;on would contend for) that in every particular ca&s;e, God wills this or this (&s;uppo&s;e that men &s;hould honor their parents) becau&s;e it is right, agreeably to the &s;it|ne&s;s of things, to the relation wherein they &s;tand.</P>
<P N="10">10. The law then is right and ju&s;t concerning all things. And it is <HI>good</HI> as well as <HI>ju&s;t.</HI> This we may ea&s;ily infer from the fountain whence it flowed For what was this, but the goodne&s;s of God? What but goodne&s;s alone inclined him to impart that divine copy of him&s;elf to the holy angels? To what el&s;e can we impute his be&s;tow|ing upon man the &s;ame tran&s;cript of his own nature? And what but tender love con&s;trained him afre&s;h to manife&s;t his will to fallen man? Either to <HI>Adam,</HI> or any of his &s;eed, who like him were <HI>come &s;hort of the Glory of God?</HI> Was it not mere love that moved him to publi&s;h his law, after the under&s;tandings of men were darkened? And to &s;end his prophets to declare that law, to the blind, thoughtle&s;s children of men? Doubtle&s;s his goodne&s;s it was which rai&s;ed up <HI>En<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch</HI> and <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ah,</HI> to be preachers of righteou&s;|ne&s;s; which cau&s;ed <HI>Abraham,</HI> his friend, and <HI>I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> to bear witne&s;s to his truth. It was his goodne&s;s alone, which when <HI>darkne&s;s</HI> had <HI>covered the earth, and thick darkne&s;s the people,</HI> gave a written law to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and through him, to the nation whom he had cho&s;en. It was his love which explained the&s;e living oracles by <HI>David</HI> and all the prophets that followed: Until,
<PB N="64" REF="039068_0060_10139318BB7C7848">when the fulne&s;s of time was come, he &s;ent his only-begotten Son, <HI>not to de&s;troy the law but to fulfil,</HI> to confirm every jot and tittle thereof, till having wrote it in the hearts of all his chil|dren, and put all his enemies under his feet, <HI>he &s;hall deliver up his</HI> mediatorial <HI>kingdom to the Father, that God may be all in all.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. And this law which the goodne&s;s of God gave at fir&s;t, and has pre&s;erved thro' all ages, is, like the fountain from whence it &s;prings, full of goodne&s;s and benignity: It is mild and kind; it is (as the p&s;almi&s;t expre&s;&s;es it) <HI>&s;weeter than honey and the honey-comb.</HI> It is winning and amiable. It includes <HI>what&s;oever things are lovely or of good report. If there be any virtue, if there be any prai&s;e</HI> before God and his holy angels, they are all comprized in this: Wherein are hid all the trea&s;ures of the divine wi&s;dom and know|ledge and love.</P>
<P N="12">12. And it is <HI>good</HI> in its effects, as well as in its nature. As the tree is, &s;o are its fruits. The fruits of the law of God written in the heart, are <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace and a&s;&s;urance for ever.</HI> Or rather, the law it&s;elf is righteou&s;|ne&s;s, filling the &s;oul with a peace that pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding, and cau&s;ing us to rejoice ever|more, in the te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience to|ward God. It is not &s;o properly a pledge, as <HI>an earne&s;t of our inheritance,</HI> being a part of the purcha&s;ed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It is God made manife&s;t in our fle&s;h, and bringing with him eternal life: A&s;&s;uring us by that pure and perfect love, that we are <HI>&s;ealed unto the day of redemption:</HI> That he will <HI>&s;pare us as a man &s;pareth his own &s;on that &s;erveth him, in the day when he maketh up his
<PB N="65" REF="039068_0061_1013931A574C9598">jewels,</HI> and that there remaineth for us <HI>a crown of glory which fadeth not away.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. 1. It remains only, to &s;hew, in the fourth and la&s;t place, the u&s;es of the law. And the fir&s;t u&s;e of it, without que&s;tion, is, to con|vince the world of &s;in. This is indeed the pe|culiar work of the Holy Gho&s;t: Who can work it without any means at all, or by whatever means it plea&s;eth him, however in&s;ufficient in them&s;elves, or even improper to produce &s;uch an effect. And accordingly &s;ome there are who&s;e hearts have been broken in pieces in a moment, either in &s;ickne&s;s or in health, without any vi&s;ible cau&s;e, or any outward means whatever. And others (one in an age) have been awaken|ed to a &s;en&s;e of the <HI>wrath of God abiding on</HI> them, by hearing, That <HI>God was in Chri&s;t, re|conciling the world unto him&s;elf.</HI> But it is the or|dinary method of the &s;pirit of God, to convict &s;inners by the law. It is this, which being &s;et home on the con&s;cience, generally breaketh the rocks in pieces. It is more e&s;pecially this part of <HI>the word of God,</HI> which <HI>is
<GAP DESC="foreign">, quick and powerful,</HI> full of life and energy, <HI>and &s;har|per than any two edged-&s;word.</HI> This in the hand of God and of tho&s;e whom he hath &s;ent, <HI>pierces</HI> through all the folds of a deceitful heart, and <HI>di|vides a&s;under even the &s;oul and &s;pirit,</HI> yea, as it were the very <HI>joints and marrow.</HI> By this is the &s;inner di&s;covered to him&s;elf. All his fig-leaves are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orn away, and he &s;ees that he is <HI>wretched and poor and mi&s;erable and blind and naked.</HI> The law fla&s;hes conviction on every &s;ide.

<P N="2">2. To &s;lay the &s;inner is then the fir&s;t u&s;e of the law; to de&s;troy the life and &s;trength where|in he tru&s;ts, and convince him that he is dead while he liveth; not only under &s;entence of death, but actually dead unto God, void of all &s;piritual life, <HI>dead i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins.</HI> The &s;econd u&s;e of it is, to bring him unto life, unto Chri&s;t, that he may live. It is true, in performing both the&s;e offices, it acts the part of a &s;evere &s;chool|ma&s;ter. It drives us by force, rather than draws us by love. And yet love is the &s;pring of all. It is the &s;pirit of love, which by this painful means, tears away our confidence in the fle&s;h, which leaves us no broken reed whereon to tru&s;t, and &s;o con&s;trains the &s;inner, &s;tript of all, to cry out in the bitterne&s;s of his &s;oul, or groan in the depth of his heart,

<P N="3">3. The third u&s;e of the law is, to keep us alive. It is the grand means whereby the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit prepares the believer for larger communi|cations of the life of God.</P>
<P>I am afraid this great and important truth is little under&s;tood, not only by the world, but even by many whom God hath taken out of the world, who are real children of God by faith. Many of the&s;e lay it down as an unque&s;tioned truth, that when we come to Chri&s;t, we have done with the law; and that in <HI>this</HI> &s;en&s;e, <HI>Chri&s;t is the end of the law, to every one that believeth.

<PB N="68" REF="039068_0064_101393250AEE9198">and we have not yet attained, of receiving grace upon grace, till we are in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fulne&s;s of his promi&s;es.</P>
<P N="5">5. How clearly does this agree with the ex|perience of every true believer! While he cries out, <HI>O what love have I unto thy law! all the day long is my &s;tudy in it:</HI> He &s;ees daily in that divine mirror, more and more of his own &s;infulne&s;s. He &s;ees more and more clearly, that he is &s;till a &s;inner in all things; that neither his heart nor his ways are right before God. And that every moment &s;ends him to Chri&s;t. This &s;hews him the meaning of what is written, <HI>Thou &s;halt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it, Holine&s;s to the Lord. And it &s;hall be up|on Aaron's forehead</HI> (the type of our great High Prie&s;t: <HI>that Aaron may bear the iniquities of the holy things, which the children of I&s;rael &s;hall hal|low, in all their holy gifts:</HI> (&s;o far are our prayers or holy things from atoning for the re&s;t of our &s;ins!) <HI>And it &s;hall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the Lord.</HI> Exodus xxviii. 36, 38.</P>
<P N="6">6. To explain this by a &s;ingle in&s;tance. The law &s;ays, <HI>Thou &s;halt not kill,</HI> and hereby (as our Lord teaches) forbids not only outward acts, but every unkind word or thought. Now the more I look into this perfect law, the more I feel how far I come &s;hort of it: And the more I feel this, the more I feel my need of his blood to a|tone for all my &s;in: and of his &s;pirit to purify my heart, and make me <HI>perfect and entire, lacking nothing.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Therefore I cannot &s;pare the law one mo|ment, no more than I can &s;pare Chri&s;t: Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ing

</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. SAINT <HI>Paul</HI> having in the beginning of this epi&s;tle, laid down his general propo&s;ition, namely, That <HI>the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t is the power of God unto &s;alvation, to every one that believeth:</HI> The powerful means, whereby God makes ev|ery believer a partaker of pre&s;ent and eternal &s;alvation, goes on to &s;hew, that there is no other way under heaven, whereby men can be &s;aved. He &s;peaks particularly of &s;alvation from the guilt of &s;in, which he commonly terms ju&s;tification. And that all men &s;tood in need of this, that none could plead their own innocence, he proves at large by various arguments, addre&s;&s;ed to the Jews as well as the heathens. Hence he infers (in the 19th ver&s;e of this chapter) <HI>That every mouth,</HI> whether of Jew or heathen, mu&s;t <HI>be &s;topt</HI> from excu&s;ing or ju&s;tifying him|&s;elf, <HI>and all the world become guilty before God. Therefore,</HI> &s;aith he, by his own obedience, <HI>by the works of the law, &s;hall no fle&s;h be ju&s;tified in his &s;ight,</HI> ver. 20. <HI>But now the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God without the law,</HI> without our previous obedience thereto, <HI>is manife&s;ted,</HI> ver. 21. <HI>Even the righteou&s;|ne&s;s
<PB N="74" REF="039068_0069_1013933663A82898">of God, which is by faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, unto all and upon all that believe,</HI> ver. 22. <HI>For there is no difference,</HI> as to their need of ju&s;tifica|tion, or the manner wherein they attain it. <HI>For all have &s;inned, and come &s;hort of the glory of God, (ver.</HI> 23.) the glorious image of God wherein they were created: And all (who attain) <HI>are ju&s;ti|fied freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> ver. 24. <HI>Whom God hath &s;et forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood</HI>&mdash; ver. 25. <HI>That he might be ju&s;t, and yet the ju&s;tifi|er of him which believeth in Je&s;us;</HI> ver. 26. that without any impeachment to his ju&s;tice, he might &s;hew him mercy, for the &s;ake of that propitiation. <HI>Therefore we conclude</HI> (which was the grand po&s;i|tion he had undertaken to e&s;tabli&s;h) <HI>That a man is ju&s;tified by faith, without the works of the law.</HI> ver. 28.</P>
<P N="2">2. It was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee an objection which might be made, and which has in fact been made in all ages: namely, That to &s;ay <HI>we are ju&s;tified without the works of the law,</HI> is to aboli&s;h the law. The apo&s;tle, without entering into a for|mal di&s;pute, &s;imply denies the charge. <HI>Do we then,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>make void the law through faith? God forbid! Yea, we e&s;tabli&s;h the law.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;trange imagination of &s;ome, that St. <HI>Paul,</HI> when he &s;ays, <HI>A man is ju&s;tified without the works of the law,</HI> means only the <HI>ceremonial</HI> law, is abundantly confuted by the&s;e very words. For did St. <HI>Paul e&s;tabli&s;h</HI> the <HI>ceremonial</HI> law? It is evi|dent, he did not. He did <HI>make void</HI> that law through faith, and openly avowed his doing &s;o. It was the <HI>moral</HI> law only of which he might truly &s;ay, We do not make void but <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h this through faith.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="75" REF="039068_0070_10139337ED573168">
4. But all men are not herein of his mind. Many there are who will not agree to this. Many in all ages of the church, even among tho&s;e who bore the name of Chri&s;tians, have contended, That <HI>the faith once delivered to the &s;aints,</HI> was de|&s;igned to make void the whole law. They would no more &s;pare the moral than the ceremonial law, but were for <HI>hewing,</HI> as it were, <HI>both in pieces before the Lord:</HI> Vehemently maintaining, "If you e&s;tabli&s;h any law, <HI>Chri&s;t &s;hall profit you nothing: Chri&s;t is become of no effect to you: ye are fallen from grace.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. But is the zeal of the&s;e men according to knowledge? Have they ob&s;erved the correction between the law and faith? And that con&s;ider|ing that clo&s;e connection between them, to de|&s;troy one is indeed to de&s;troy both? That to abo|li&s;h the moral law is in truth to aboli&s;h faith and the law together? As leaving no proper means, either of bringing us to faith, or of <HI>&s;tirring up that gift of God</HI> in our &s;oul.</P>
<P N="6">6. It therefore behoves all who de&s;ire either to come to Chri&s;t, or to <HI>walk in him whom they have received,</HI> to take heed how they <HI>make void the law through faith:</HI> To &s;ecure us effectually again&s;t which, let us enquire, Fir&s;t, which are the mo&s;t u&s;ual ways of <HI>making void the law through faith,</HI> and Secondly, How we may follow the apo&s;tle, and by faith <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h the law.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. 1. Let us, Fir&s;t, enquire, Which are the mo&s;t u&s;ual ways of <HI>making void the law through faith.</HI> Now the way for a preacher to make it all void at a &s;troke, is, not to preach it at all. This is ju&s;t the &s;ame thing, as to blot it out of the
<PB N="76" REF="039068_0071_101393398F43BAE8">oracles of God. More e&s;pecially when it is done with de&s;ign; when it is made a rule, "Not to preach the law:" And the very phra&s;e, "A preacher of the law," is u&s;ed as a term of re|proach, as though it meant little le&s;s than "an enemy to the go&s;pel."</P>
<P N="2">2. All this proceeds from the deepe&s;t ignorance of the nature, properties, and u&s;e of the law: And proves that tho&s;e who act thus, either know not Chri&s;t, are utter &s;trangers to the living faith: or at lea&s;t, that they are but babes in Chri&s;t, and as &s;uch <HI>un&s;killed in the word of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Their grand plea is this: "That preach|ing the go&s;pel (that is, according to their judg|ment, the &s;peaking of nothing but the &s;ufferings and merits of Chri&s;t) an&s;wers all the ends of the law." But this we utterly deny. It does not an&s;wer the very fir&s;t end of the law, namely, The convincing men of &s;in, the awakening tho&s;e who are &s;till a&s;leep on the brink of hell. There may have been here and there an exempt ca&s;e. One in a thou&s;and may have been a|wakened by the go&s;pel. But this is no general rule. The ordinary method of God, is to con|vict &s;inners by the law, and that only. The go&s;pel is not the means which God hath or|dained, or which our Lord him&s;elf u&s;ed, for this end. We have no authority in &s;cripture for ap|plying it thus, nor any ground to think it will prove effectual. Nor have we any more ground to expect this, from the nature of the thing. <HI>They that be whole,</HI> as our Lord him&s;elf ob&s;erves, <HI>need not a phy&s;ician, but they that be &s;ick.</HI> It is ab|&s;urd therefore to offer a phy&s;ician to them that are whole, or that at lea&s;t imagine them&s;elves &s;o
<PB N="77" REF="039068_0072_1013933CB7B2ED28">to be. You are fir&s;t, to convince them, that they are &s;ick: otherwi&s;e they will not thank you for your labour. It is equally ab&s;urd to offer Chri&s;t to them, who&s;e heart is whole, having ne|ver yet been broken. It is in the proper &s;en&s;e, <HI>ca&s;t|ing pearls before &s;wine.</HI> Doubtle&s;s <HI>they will trample them under foot.</HI> And it is no more than you have rea&s;on to expect, if they al&s;o <HI>turn again and rend you.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. "But although there is no command in &s;cripture, to offer Chri&s;t to the carele&s;s &s;inner, yet are there not &s;criptural precedents for it?" I think not: I know not any. I believe you cannot produce one, either from the four evangeli&s;ts, or the <HI>Acts of the Apo&s;tles.</HI> Neither can you prove this to have been the practice of any of the apo&s;tles, from any pa&s;&s;age in all their writings.</P>
<P N="5">5. "Nay, does not the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ay, in his former epi&s;tle to the <HI>Corinthians, We preach Chri&s;t crucified?</HI> chap. i. ver. 23. And in his lat|ter, <HI>We preach not our&s;elves, but Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord?</HI> chap. iv. ver. 5."</P>
<P>We con&s;ent to re&s;t the cau&s;e on this i&s;&s;ue: To tread in his &s;teps, to follow his example. Only preach you, ju&s;t as St. <HI>Paul</HI> preached, and the di&s;pute is at an end.</P>
<P>For although we are certain he <HI>preached Chri&s;t,</HI> in as perfect a manner as the very chief of the apo&s;tles, yet who <HI>preached the law</HI> more than St. <HI>Paul?</HI> Therefore he did not think the go&s;pel an&s;wered the &s;ame end.</P>
<P N="6">6. The very fir&s;t &s;ermon of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, which is recorded, concludes in the&s;e words. <HI>By him all that believe are ju&s;tified from all things, from which ye could not be ju&s;tified by the law of Mo&s;es. Beware, therefore, le&s;t that come upon you which is
<PB N="78" REF="039068_0073_10139342C1E17DB8">&s;poken of in the prophets, Behold, ye de&s;pi&s;ers, and wonder and peri&s;h. For I work a work in your days, a work which you will in no wi&s;e believe, though a man declare it unto you, Acts</HI> xiii. 39, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now it is manife&s;t, all this is <HI>preaching the law,</HI> in the &s;en&s;e wherein you under&s;tand the term: Even although great part of, if not all his hearers, were either <HI>Jews or religious pro&s;elytes,</HI> ver. 43. and therefore probably many of them, in &s;ome de|gree at lea&s;t, convinced of &s;in already. He fir&s;t reminds them, That they could not be ju&s;tified by the law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> but only by faith in Chri&s;t: And then &s;everely threatens them with the judg|ments of God, which is in the &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;e <HI>preaching the law.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. In his next di&s;cour&s;e, that to the hea|thens at <HI>Ly&s;tra</HI> (chap. xiv. ver. 15, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) we do not find &s;o much as the name of Chri&s;t.

Do not you think, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you had been there, you could have preached much better than he? I &s;hould not wonder, if you thought too, that his <HI>preaching &s;o ill,</HI> occa&s;ioned his being <HI>&s;o ill treated:</HI> And that his being <HI>&s;toned,</HI> was a ju&s;t judgment upon him, for not <HI>preaching Chri&s;t!</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. To the jailor indeed, when <HI>he &s;prang in and came trembling, and fell down before</HI> Paul <HI>and</HI> Silas, <HI>and &s;aid, Sirs, What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved,</HI> he im|mediately <HI>&s;aid, Believe in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> (chap. xvi. ver. 29, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) And in the ca&s;e of one &s;o deeply convinced of &s;in, who would not have &s;aid the &s;ame?

<PB N="79" REF="039068_0074_10139345D35ACDB0">and &s;trongly moving them to repent, from the con|&s;ideration of a future judgment, and of the re&s;ur|rection from the dead (chap. xvii. ver. 24&mdash;31.) likewi&s;e <HI>when</HI> Felix <HI>&s;ent for</HI> Paul, on purpo&s;e that he might <HI>hear him concerning the faith in Chri&s;t;</HI> in&s;tead of preaching Chri&s;t in <HI>your</HI> &s;en&s;e (which would probably have cau&s;ed the governor either to mock, or to contradict and bla&s;pheme) <HI>he rea&s;oned of righteou&s;ne&s;s, temperance and judg|ment to come,</HI> till <HI>Felix</HI> (hardened as he was) <HI>trembled.</HI> (chap. xxiv. ver. 24, 25.)

<P N="10">10. From hence it is plain, you know not what it is, to <HI>preach Chri&s;t,</HI> in the &s;en&s;e of the apo&s;tle. For doubtle&s;s St. <HI>Paul</HI> judged him&s;elf to be <HI>preach|ing Chri&s;t,</HI> both to <HI>Felix,</HI> and at <HI>Antioch, Ly&s;tra,</HI> and <HI>Athens.</HI> From who&s;e example every think|ing
<PB N="80" REF="039068_0075_10139347D8750450">man mu&s;t infer, that not only the declaring the love of Chri&s;t to &s;inners, but al&s;o the de|claring that he will come from heaven in flaming fire, is, in the apo&s;tle's &s;en&s;e, <HI>preaching Chri&s;t:</HI> Yea, in the full &s;criptural meaning of the word, to <HI>preach Chri&s;t,</HI> is, to preach what he hath re|vealed, either in the old or new te&s;tament: So that you are then as really preaching Chri&s;t, when you are &s;aying, <HI>The wicked &s;hall be turned into hell, and all the people that forget God,</HI> as when you are &s;aying, <HI>Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the Sin of the world!</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. Con&s;ider this well; That to <HI>preach Chri&s;t,</HI> is to preach all things that Chri&s;t hath &s;poken; all his promi&s;es, all his threatenings and com|mands; all that is written in his book. And then you will know how to preach Chri&s;t, without making void the law.</P>

<PB N="81" REF="039068_0076_1013934963BFE6B8">any &s;pirit or life or virtue. So that thus <HI>to preach Chri&s;t,</HI> mu&s;t in proce&s;s of time, make void the go&s;pel as well as the law.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. A &s;econd way of <HI>making void the law thro' faith,</HI> is, the teaching that faith &s;uper&s;edes the nece&s;&s;ity of holine&s;s. This divides it&s;elf into a thou&s;and &s;maller paths: And many there are that walk therein. Indeed there are few that wholly e&s;cape it: Few who are convinced, we <HI>are &s;aved by faith,</HI> but are &s;ooner or later, more or le&s;s, drawn a&s;ide into this by-way.</P>
<P N="2">2. All tho&s;e are drawn into this by way, who if it be not their &s;ettled judgment, that faith in Chri&s;t entirely &s;ets a&s;ide the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping his law, yet &s;uppo&s;e either, 1. That holine&s;s is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary now than it was before Chri&s;t: or, 2. That a le&s;s degree of it is nece&s;&s;ary; or, 3. That it is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to believers than to others. Yea, and &s;o are all tho&s;e, who altho' their judgment be right in the general, yet think they may take more liberty in particular ca&s;es, then they could have done before they be|lieved. Indeed the u&s;ing the term <HI>liberty,</HI> in &s;uch a manner, for "Liberty from obedience or holine&s;s," &s;hews at once, that their judg|ment is perverted, and that they are guilty of what they imagined to be far from them, namely of <HI>making void the law thro' faith,</HI> by &s;uppo&s;ing faith to &s;uper&s;ede holine&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. The fir&s;t plea of tho&s;e who teach this ex|pre&s;sly, is, that "we are now under the cove|nant of grace, not works: And therefore we are no longer under the nece&s;&s;ity of performing the works of the law."</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="039068_0077_1013934AEF5A0260">
And who ever was under the covenant of works? none but <HI>Adam</HI> before the fall. He was fully and properly under that covenant, which required perfect, univer&s;al obedience, as the one condition of acceptance; and left no place for pardon, upon the very lea&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. But no man el&s;e was ever under this, neither Jew nor Gentile, neither before Chri&s;t nor &s;ince. All his &s;ons were and are under the covenant of grace; the manner of their acceptance is this: The free grace of God thro' the merits of Chri&s;t, gives pardon to them that believe, that believe with &s;uch a faith as working by love produces all obedience and holine&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4. The ca&s;e is not therefore as you &s;uppo&s;e, that men were <HI>once</HI> more obliged to obey God, or to work the works of his law than they are <HI>now.</HI> This is a &s;uppo&s;ition you cannot make good. But, we &s;hould have been obliged, if we had been under the covenant of works, to have done tho&s;e works antecedent to our acceptance. Whereas now all good works, tho' as nece&s;&s;ary as ever, are not antecedent to our acceptance but con&s;equent upon it. Therefore the nature of the covenant of grace, gives you no ground no encouragement at all, to &s;et a&s;ide any in&s;tance or degeee of obedience, any part or mea&s;ure of holine&s;s.</P>
<P N="5">5. "But are we not <HI>ju&s;tified by faith, without the works of the law?"</HI> Undoubtedly we are, without the works either of the ceremonial or the moral law. And would to God all men were convinced of this. It would prevent innu|merable evils: Antinomiani&s;m, in particular; for generally &s;peaking, they are the phari&s;ees who
<PB N="83" REF="039068_0078_10139353C302B8B0">make the antinomians. Running into an ex|treme &s;o palpably contrary to &s;cripture, they oc|ca&s;ion others to run the oppo&s;ite one. The&s;e &s;eeking to be ju&s;tified by works, affright tho&s;e from allowing any place for them.</P>
<P N="6">6. But the truth lies between both. We are doubtle&s;s <HI>ju&s;tified by faith.</HI> This is the corner|&s;tone of the whole chri&s;tian building. We are <HI>ju&s;tified without the works of the law,</HI> as any previ|ous condition of ju&s;tification. But they are an immediate fruit of that faith, wereby we are ju&s;tified. So that if good works do not follow our faith, even all inward and outward holi|ne&s;s, it is plain our faith is nothing worth: We are yet in our &s;ins. Therefore, that <HI>we are ju&s;|tified by faith,</HI> even by <HI>faith without works,</HI> is no ground for <HI>making void the law thro' faith:</HI> or for imagining that faith is a di&s;pen&s;ation, from any kind or degree of holine&s;s.</P>
<P N="7">7. "Nay, but does not St. <HI>Paul</HI> expre&s;sly &s;ay, <HI>Unto him that worketh not, but believeth on him that ju&s;tifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righ|teou&s;ne&s;s?</HI> And does it not follow from hence, that faith is to a believer in the room, in the place of righteou&s;ne&s;s? But if faith is in the room of righteou&s;ne&s;s or holine&s;s, what need is there of this too?"</P>
<P>This, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, comes home to the point, and is indeed the main pillar of an|tinomiani&s;m. And yet it needs not a long or la|boured an&s;wer. We allow, 1. That God <HI>ju&s;|tifies the ungodly,</HI> him, that till that hour is totally ungodly, full of all evil, void of all good. 2. That he ju&s;tifies <HI>the ungodly that worketh not,</HI> that till that moment worketh no good work; nei|ther
<PB N="84" REF="039068_0079_10139355B914DAA0">can he; for an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit. 3. That he ju&s;tifies him <HI>by faith alone,</HI> without any goodne&s;s or righteou&s;ne&s;s preced|ing; and, 4. That <HI>Faith is</HI> then <HI>counted to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> namely, for <HI>preceding righteou&s;ne&s;s: i. e.</HI> God, thro' the merits of Chri&s;t, accepts him that believes, as if he had already fulfilled all righteou&s;ne&s;s. But what is all this to your point? The apo&s;tle does not &s;ay, either here or el&s;e|where, that this faith is counted to him for <HI>&s;ub&s;equent righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> He does teach, that there is no righteou&s;ne&s;s <HI>before</HI> faith. But where does he teach, that there is none <HI>after</HI> it? He does a&s;&s;ert, holine&s;s cannot <HI>precede</HI> ju&s;tification: but not, that it need not <HI>follow</HI> it. St. <HI>Paul</HI> therefore gives you no colour for <HI>making void the law,</HI> by teaching that faith &s;uper&s;edes the nece&s;|&s;ity of holine&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. There is yet another way of <HI>making void the law thro' faith,</HI> which is more common than either of the former. And that is, the doing it practically: The making it void in <HI>fact,</HI> tho' not in <HI>Principle:</HI> The <HI>living,</HI> as if faith was de&s;igned to excu&s;e us from holine&s;s.</P>
<P>How earne&s;tly does the apo&s;tle guard us again&s;t this, in tho&s;e well known words: <HI>What then? Shall we &s;in, becau&s;e we are not under the law, but under grace?</HI> God <HI>forbid! Rom.</HI> vi. 15. A cau|tion which it is needful throughly to con&s;ider, be|cau&s;e it is of the la&s;t importance.</P>
<P N="2">2. The being <HI>under the law</HI> may here mean, 1. The being obliged to ob&s;erve the ceremonial law. 2. The being obliged to conform to the whole <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> in&s;titution. 3. The being obliged to keep the whole moral law, as the condition
<PB N="85" REF="039068_0080_1013935744DC6280">of our acceptance with God: and, 4. The be|ing under the wrath and cur&s;e of God, under &s;entence of eternal death; under a &s;en&s;e of guilt and condemnation, full of horror and &s;la|vi&s;h fear.</P>
<P N="3">3. Now altho'a believer is <HI>not without law to</HI> GOD, <HI>but under the law to Chri&s;t,</HI> yet from the moment he believes, he is not <HI>under the law,</HI> in any of the preceding &s;en&s;es. On the contrary, he is <HI>under grace,</HI> under a more benign, gracious di&s;pen&s;ation. As he is no longer under the ce|remonial law, nor under the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> in&s;titution; as he is not obliged to keep even the moral law, as the condition of his acceptance: So he is de|livered from the wrath and the cur&s;e of GOD, from al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;en&s;e of guilt and condemnation, and from all that horror and fear of death and hell, whereby he was <HI>all his life</HI> before <HI>&s;ubject to bondage.</HI> And he now performs (which while <HI>under the law.</HI> he could not do) a willing and univer&s;al obedience. He obeys not from the motive of &s;lavi&s;h fear, but on a nobler principle, namely, the grace of God ruling in his heart, and cau&s;ing all his works to be wrought in love.</P>
<P N="4">4. What then? Shall this evangelical principle of action, be le&s;s powerful than the legal? Shall we be le&s;s obedient to GOD, from filial love, than we were from &s;ervile fear?</P>
<P>'It is well, if this is not a common ca&s;e; if this practical antinomiani&s;m, this unob&s;erved way of <HI>making void the law thro' faith,</HI> has not infected thou&s;ands of believers.</P>
<P>Has it not infected you? Examine your&s;elf hone&s;tly and clo&s;ely. Do you not do now, what you dur&s;t not have done when you was <HI>under the
<PB N="86" REF="039068_0081_10139358CE5403B8">law,</HI> or (as we commonly call it) <HI>under convic|tion?</HI> For in&s;tance. You dur&s;t not then indulge your&s;elf in food. You took ju&s;t what was need|ful, and that of the cheape&s;t kind. Do you not allow your&s;elf more latitude now? Do you not indulge your&s;elf a <HI>little</HI> more than you did? O be|ware, le&s;t you <HI>&s;in, becau&s;e you are not under the law but under grace.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. When you was under conviction, you dur&s;t not indulge the lu&s;t of the eye in any degree. You would not do any thing, great or &s;mall, mere|ly to gratify your curio&s;ity. You regarded only cleanline&s;s and nece&s;&s;ity, or at mo&s;t very mode|rate convenience, either in furniture or appa|rel; Superfluity and finery of whatever kind, as well as fa&s;hionable elegance, were both a terror and an abomination to you.</P>
<P>Are they &s;o &s;till? Is your con&s;cience as tender now in the&s;e things, as it was then? Do you &s;till follow the &s;ame rule both in furniture and apparel, trampling all finery, all &s;uperfluity, every thing u&s;ele&s;s, every thing merely ornamen|tal, however fa&s;hionable, under foot? Rather, have you not re&s;umed what you had once laid a|&s;ide, and what you could not then u&s;e without wounding your con&s;cience? And have you not learned to &s;ay, "O, I am not <HI>&s;o &s;crupulous</HI> now." I would to God you were! Then you would not <HI>&s;in</HI> thus, <HI>becau&s;e you are not under the law but under grace.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. You was once &s;crupulous too of commend|ing any to their face, and &s;till more, of &s;uffering any to commend <HI>you.</HI> It was a &s;tab to your heart: You could not bear it: You &s;ought the honour that cometh of God only. You could not en|dure
<PB N="87" REF="039068_0082_1013935D117C8C18">&s;uch conver&s;ation: nor any conver&s;ation, which was not good, to the u&s;e of edifying. All idle talk, all trifling di&s;cour&s;e you abhorred, you hated as well as feared it, being deeply &s;en|&s;ible of the value of time, of every precious, fleeting moment. In like manner, you dreaded and abhorred idle expence; valuing your money only le&s;s than your time, and trembling le&s;t you &s;hould be found an unfaithful &s;teward even of the mammon of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Do you now look upon prai&s;e as deadly poi|&s;on, which you can neither give nor receive but at the peril of your &s;oul? Do you &s;till dread and abhor all conver&s;ation, which does not tend to the u&s;e of edifying; and labour to improve every moment, that it may not pa&s;s without leaving you better than it found you? Are not you le&s;s careful as to the expence both of money and time? Cannot you now lay out either, as you could not have done once? Alas! How has that <HI>which &s;hould have been for your health, proved to you an occa&s;ion of falling?</HI> How have you <HI>&s;in|ned, becau&s;e you was not under the law, but under grace!</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. God forbid you &s;hould any longer conti|nue thus to <HI>turn the grace of</HI> God <HI>into la&s;civiou&s;|ne&s;s!</HI> O remember, how clear and &s;trong a con|viction you once had, concerning all the&s;e things. And at the &s;ame time you was fully &s;atisfied, from whom that conviction came. The world told you, you was in in a delu&s;ion: But you knew, it was the voice of God. In the&s;e things you was not <HI>too &s;crupulous</HI> then; but you are not now <HI>&s;crupulous enough.</HI> God kept you longer in that painful &s;chool, that you might learn tho&s;e great
<PB N="88" REF="039068_0083_10139361A4882C40">le&s;&s;ons the more perfectly. And have you forgot them already? O recollect them, before it is too late. Have you &s;uffered &s;o many things in vain? I tru&s;t, it is not yet in vain. Now u&s;e the con|viction without the pain: Practi&s;e the le&s;&s;on without the rod. Let not the mercy of God weigh le&s;s with you now, than his fiery indigna|tion did before. Is love a le&s;s powerful motive than fear? If not, let it be an invariable rule "I will do nothing now I am <HI>under grace,</HI> which I dur&s;t not have done when <HI>under the law.</HI>"</P>
<P N="8">8. I cannot conclude this head, without ex|horting you to examine your&s;elf likewi&s;e touching &s;ins of omi&s;&s;ion. Are you as clear of the&s;e, now <HI>you are under grace,</HI> as you was when <HI>under the law?</HI> How diligent was you when in hearing the word of God? Did you neglect any oppor|tunity? Did you not attend thereon day and night? Would a &s;mall hinderance have kept you away? A little bu&s;ine&s;s? A vi&s;itant? A &s;light indi&s;po&s;ition? A &s;oft bed? A dark or cold morning?&mdash;Did not you then fa&s;t often? Or u&s;e ab&s;tinence to the uttermo&s;t of your power? Was not you much in prayer, (cold and heavy as you was) while you was hanging over the mouth of hell? Did you not &s;peak and not &s;pare, even for an unknown God? Did you not boldly plead his cau&s;e? Reprove &s;inners? And avow the truth, before an adulterous ge|neration?&mdash;And are you now a believer in Chri&s;t? Have you the <HI>faith that overcometh the world?</HI> What! and are you le&s;s zealous for your ma&s;ter now, than you was when you knew him not? Le&s;s diligent in fa&s;ting, in prayer, in hearing his word, in calling &s;inners to God? O repent.
<PB N="89" REF="039068_0084_10139364AE672A68">See and feel your grievous lo&s;s! Remember from whence you are fallen! Bewail your unfaithful|ne&s;s!

<P N="1">1. IT has been &s;hewn in the preceding di&s;cour&s;e, which are the mo&s;t u&s;ual ways of <HI>making void the law through faith:</HI> Namely, Fir&s;t, The not preaching it at all, which effectually makes it all void at a &s;troke: And this under colour of <HI>preaching Chri&s;t</HI> and magnifying the go&s;pel, though it be in truth, de&s;troying both the one and the o|ther: Secondly, the teaching (whether directly or indirectly) that faith &s;uper&s;edes the nece&s;&s;ity of holine&s;s: That this is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary now, or a le&s;s degree of it nece&s;&s;ary, than before Chri&s;t came: That it is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to us, becau&s;e we believe, than otherwi&s;e it would have been: Or, that Chri&s;tian liberty is a liberty from any kind or degree of holine&s;s: (So perverting tho&s;e great truths, that we are now under the <HI>covenant of grace</HI> and not <HI>of works:</HI>) That <HI>a man is ju&s;tified by faith, without the works of the law;</HI> and that <HI>to him that worketh not but believeth, his faith is count|ed for righteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> Or, Thirdly, The doing this practically; the making void the law in practice,
<PB N="92" REF="039068_0086_1013936AC6D3ECC0">though not in principle: The living or acting, as if faith was de&s;igned to excu&s;e us from holine&s;s: The allowing our&s;elves in &s;in, <HI>becau&s;e we are not under the law, but under grace.</HI> It remains to en|quire, how we may follow a better pattern, how we may be able to &s;ay with the apo&s;tle, <HI>Do we then make void the law through faith?

<P N="2">2. We do not indeed e&s;tabli&s;h the old ceremo|nial law: We know that is aboli&s;hed for ever. Much le&s;s do we e&s;tabli&s;h the whole <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> di&s;|pen&s;ation. This, we know, our Lord has <HI>nailed to his cro&s;s.</HI> Nor yet do we &s;o e&s;tabli&s;h the mo|ral law (which it is to be feared, too many do) as if the fulfilling it, the keeping all the command|ments, were the condition of our ju&s;tification. If it were &s;o, &s;urely <HI>in his &s;ight, &s;hould no man living be ju&s;tified</HI> But all this being allowed, we &s;till in the apo&s;tle's &s;en&s;e, <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h the law,</HI> the moral law.</P>
<P N="1">I. 1. We <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h the law,</HI> Fir&s;t, By our doc|trine: by endeavouring to preach it in its whole extent, to explain and enforce every part of it, in the &s;ame manner as our great teacher did, while upon earth. We e&s;tabli&s;h it, by follow|ing St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s advice, <HI>If any man &s;peak, let him &s;peak as the oracles of God;</HI> as the holy men of old moved by the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;poke and wrote for our in&s;truction, and as the apo&s;tles of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, by the direction of the &s;ame Spirit. We e&s;tabli&s;h it whenever we &s;peak in his name, by keeping back nothing from them that hear; by declaring to them, without any limitation or re&s;erve, the whole coun&s;el of God. And in or|der
<PB N="93" REF="039068_0087_1013936DCAD78EF8">the more effectually to e&s;tabli&s;h it, we u&s;e herein great plainne&s;s of &s;peech. <HI>We are not as many that corrupt the word of God,</HI>
<GAP DESC="foreign">(as artful men their bad wines, we do not cau|ponize, mix, adulterate, or &s;often it, to make it &s;uit the ta&s;te of the hearers. <HI>But as of &s;incerity, but as of God in the &s;ight of God, &s;peak we in Chri&s;t:</HI> As having no other aim, than <HI>by mani|fe&s;tation of the truth,</HI> to <HI>commend our&s;elves to every man's con&s;cience in the &s;ight of God.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. We then by our doctrine e&s;tabli&s;h the law, when we thus openly declare it to all men: And that, in the fulne&s;s wherein it is delivered by our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and his apo&s;tles: When we pub|li&s;h it in the height and depth and length and breadth thereof. We then e&s;tabli&s;h the law, when we declare every part of it, every com|mandment contained therein, not only in its full literal &s;en&s;e, but likewi&s;e in its &s;piritual meaning: Not only with regard to the outward actions, which it either forbids or enjoins: But al&s;o with re&s;pect to the inward principle, to the thoughts, de&s;ires and intents of the heart.</P>
<P N="3">3. And indeed this we do the more diligently, not only becau&s;e it is of the deepe&s;t importance; ina&s;much as all the fruit, every word and work, mu&s;t be only evil continually, if the tree be evil, if the di&s;po&s;itions and tempers of the heart, be not right before God: But likewi&s;e, becau&s;e as important as the&s;e things are, they are little con&s;idered or under&s;tood. So little, that we may truly &s;ay of the law too, when taken in its full &s;piritual meaning, It is <HI>a my&s;tery which was hid from ages and generations &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ire the world began.</HI> It was utterly hid from the hea|then
<PB N="94" REF="039068_0088_10136DE0B8EE62F8">world. They, with all their boa&s;ted wi&s;|dom, neither <HI>found out God,</HI> nor the law of God, not in the letter, much le&s;s in the &s;pirit of it. <HI>Their fooli&s;h hearts were</HI> more and more <HI>darkened,</HI> while <HI>profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves wi&s;e, they be|came fools.</HI> And it was almo&s;t equally hid as to its &s;piritual meaning, from the bulk of the Jewi&s;h nation. Even the&s;e who were &s;o ready to de|clare concerning others, <HI>this people that know not the law, is accur&s;ed,</HI> pronounced their own &s;en|tence therein, as being under the &s;ame cur&s;e, the &s;ame dreadful ignorance. Witne&s;s our Lord's continual reproof of the wi&s;e&s;t among them, for their gro&s;s mi&s;interpretations of it. Witne&s;s the &s;uppo&s;ition almo&s;t univer&s;ally received among them, that they needed only to make clean the out&s;ide of the cup: that the paying tythe of mint, ani&s;e, and cummin, outward exactne&s;s would atone for inward unholine&s;s; for the total neglect both of ju&s;tice and mercy, of faith and the love of God. Yea, &s;o ab&s;olutely was the &s;piritual meaning of the law hidden from the wi&s;e&s;t of them, that one of their mo&s;t eminent Rabbi's comments thus, on tho&s;e words of the p&s;almi&s;t, <HI>If I incline unto iniquity with my heart, the Lord will not hear me:</HI> That is, &s;aith he, if it be only in my heart, if I do not commit out|ward wickedne&s;s, the Lord will not regard it; he will not puni&s;h me, unle&s;s I proceed to the outward act!</P>
<P N="4">4. But alas! The law of God, as to its inward &s;piritual meaning, is not hid from the Jews or heathens only, but even from what is called the chri&s;tian world; at lea&s;t, from a va&s;t majority of them. The &s;piritual &s;en&s;e of the

But this is too &s;ure, that the far greater part, even of tho&s;e, who are called <HI>re|formed Chri&s;tians,</HI> are utter &s;trangers at this day to the law of Chri&s;t, in the purity and &s;piritu|ality of it.</P>

Hence it is that to this day <HI>the &s;cribes and phari&s;ees,</HI> the men who have the form but not the power of religion, and who are generally wi&s;e in their own eyes, and righteous in their own conceits; <HI>hearing the&s;e things are offended:</HI> Are deeply offended, when we &s;peak of the re|ligion of the heart, and particularly when we &s;hew, that without this, were we to <HI>give all our goods to feed the poor,</HI> it would profit us nothing. But offended they mu&s;t be: For we cannot but &s;peak the truth as it is in Je&s;us. It is our pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> whether they will hear or whether they will fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bear, to deliver our own &s;oul. All that is written in the book of God we are to declare, not as plea&s;|ing men, but the Lord. We are to declare not only all the promi&s;es, but all the threatnings too which we find therein. At the &s;ame time that we proclaim all the ble&s;&s;ings and privileges, which God had prepared for his children, we are like|wi&s;e to <HI>teach all the things, what&s;oever he hath com|manded.</HI> And we know, that all the&s;e have their u&s;e: either for the awakening tho&s;e that &s;leep, the in&s;tructing the ignorant, the comforting the feeble-minded, or the building up and perfecting of the &s;aints. We know that <HI>all &s;cripture, given by in&s;piration of God, is profitable</HI> either <HI>for doctrine</HI> or <HI>for reproof,</HI> either <HI>for correction</HI> or
<PB N="96" REF="039068_0090_10139376E12784B0"><HI>for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> And <HI>that the man of God,</HI> in the proce&s;s of the work of God in his &s;oul, has need of every part thereof, that he <HI>may at length, be perfect, throughly furni&s;hed unto all good works.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. It is our part, thus to <HI>preach Chri&s;t,</HI> by preaching all things what&s;oever he hath revealed. We may indeed without blame, yea, and with a peculiar ble&s;&s;ing from God, declare the love of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. We may &s;peak, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a more e&s;pecial manner, <HI>of the Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> We may expatiate upon the grace of <HI>God in Chri&s;t reconciling the world unto him&s;elf.</HI> We may, at proper opportunities, dwell upon his prai&s;e, as bearing, <HI>the iniqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of us all,</HI> as <HI>wound|ed for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions</HI> and <HI>brui&s;ed for our iniqui|ties,</HI> that <HI>by his &s;tripes we</HI> might <HI>be healed.</HI> But &s;till we &s;hould not <HI>preach Chri&s;t,</HI> according to his word, if we were wholly to confine our&s;elves to this. We are not our&s;elves clear before God, unle&s;s we proclaim him in all his offices. <HI>To preach Chri&s;t,</HI> as a workman that needeth not to be a&s;hamed, is to preach him not only as our great <HI>high-prie&s;t, taken from among men, and ordained for men, in things pertaining to God;</HI> as &s;uch, <HI>reconciling us to God by his blood,</HI> and <HI>ever living to make interce&s;&s;ion for us:</HI> but likewi&s;e as the prophet of the Lord, <HI>who of God is made unto us wi&s;dom.</HI> Who by his word, and his &s;pirit, <HI>is with us always, guiding us into all truth:</HI> Yea, and as remaining a king for ever; as giving laws to all whom he has bough with his blood: As re&s;toring tho&s;e to the image of God, whom he had fir&s;t re-in&s;tated in his favour: As reigning in all believing hearts, un|til he has <HI>&s;ubdued all things to him&s;elf;</HI> until he
<PB N="97" REF="039068_0091_101393788210C730">hath utterly ca&s;t out all &s;in, and <HI>brought in ever|la&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. 1. <HI>We e&s;tabli&s;h the law,</HI> &s;econdly, when we &s;o preach faith in Chri&s;t, as not to &s;uper&s;ede, but produce holine&s;s: to produce all manner of holine&s;s, negative and po&s;itive, of the heart and of the life.</P>
<P>In order to this, we continually declare (what &s;hould be frequently and deeply con&s;idered, by all who would not <HI>make void the law thro' faith</HI>) that faith it&s;elf, even chri&s;tian faith, the faith of God's elect, the faith of the operation of God, &s;till is only the handmaid of love. As glorious and honourable as it is, it is not the end of the commandment. God hath given this honour to love alone: love is the end of all the commandments of God. Love is the end, the &s;ole end of every di&s;pen&s;ation of God, from the beginning of the world, to the con|&s;ummation of all things. And it will endure when heaven and earth flee away; for <HI>love</HI> alone <HI>never faileth.</HI> Faith will totally fail: It will be &s;wallowed up in &s;ight, in the everla&s;ting vi&s;ion of God. But even then love
<Q><L>"Its nature and its office &s;till the &s;ame,</L>
<L>La&s;ting its lamp and uncon&s;um'd its flame,</L>
<L>In deathle&s;s triumph &s;hall for ever live,</L>
<L>And endle&s;s good diffu&s;e, and endle&s;s prai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> receive."</L></Q></P>
<P N="2">2. Very excellent things are &s;poken of faith, and who&s;oever is a partaker thereof, may well &s;ay with the apo&s;tle, <HI>thanks be to God, for his
<PB N="98" REF="039068_0092_1013937A32D6F420">un&s;peakable gift.</HI> Yet &s;till it lo&s;es all its excel|lence, when brought into a compari&s;on with love. What St. <HI>Paul</HI> ob&s;erves concerning the &s;uperior glory of the go&s;pel, above that of the law, may with great propriety be &s;poken of the &s;uperior glory of love, above that of faith. <HI>Even that which was made glorious, hath no glory in this re&s;pect, by rea&s;on of the glory that excelleth. For if that which is done away is glorious, much more doth that which remaineth exceed in glory.</HI> Yea, all the glory of faith before it is done away, ari&s;es hence, that it mini&s;ters to love. It is the great temporary means which God has or|dained to promote that eternal end.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let tho&s;e who magnify faith beyond all proportion, &s;o as to &s;wallow up all things el&s;e, and who &s;o totally mi&s;apprehend the nature of it, as to imagine it &s;tands in the place of love, con|&s;ider farther, that as love will exi&s;t after faith, &s;o it did exi&s;t long before it. The angels, who from the moment of their creation, beheld the face of their father that is in heaven, had no occa&s;ion for faith, in its general notion, as it is the evidence of things not &s;een. Neither had they need of faith, in its more particular accepta|tion, faith in the blood of Je&s;us: for he took not upon him the nature of angels; but only the &s;eed of <HI>Abraham.</HI> There was therefore no place before the foundation of the world, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aith either in the general or particular &s;en&s;e. But there was for love. Love exi&s;ted from eternity, in God, the great ocean of love. Love had a place in all the children of God, from the moment of their creation. They re|ceived
<PB N="99" REF="039068_0093_1013937E62B75440">at once from their gracious Creator, to exi&s;t, and to love.</P>
<P N="4">4. Nor is it certain (as ingeniou&s;ly and plau|&s;ibly as many have de&s;canted upon this) That faith, even in the general &s;en&s;e of the word, had any place in paradi&s;e. It is highly probable, from that &s;hort and uncircum&s;tantial account which we have in holy writ, that <HI>Adam</HI> before he rebelled again&s;t God, walked with him by &s;ight and not by faith.
<Q><L>"For then his rea&s;on's eye was &s;trong and clear,</L>
<L>And as an eagle can behold the &s;un,</L>
<L>Might have beheld his Maker's face as near,</L>
<L>As th'intellectual angels could have done."</L></Q>
He was then able to talk with him face to face, who&s;e face we cannot now &s;ee and live. And con&s;equently had no need of that faith, who&s;e office it is, to &s;upply the want of &s;ight.</P>
<P N="5">5. On the other hand, it is ab&s;olutely certain, faith in its particular &s;en&s;e had then no place. For in that &s;en&s;e it nece&s;&s;arily pre&s;uppo&s;es &s;in, and the wrath of God declared again&s;t the &s;inner: without which there is no need of an atonement for &s;in, in order to the &s;inner's re|conciliation with God. Con&s;equently, as there was no need of an atonement before the fall, &s;o there was no place for faith in that atonement<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> man being then pure from every &s;tain of &s;in, holy as God is holy. But love even then filled his heart. It reigned in him without a rival. And it was only when love was lo&s;t by &s;in, that faith was added, not for its own &s;ake, nor with
<PB N="100" REF="039068_0094_101394A70CDD78E8">any de&s;ign, that it &s;hould exi&s;t any longer, than until it had an&s;wered the end for which it was ordained, namely, to re&s;tore man, to the love from which he was fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ten. At the fall there|fore was added this evidence of things un&s;een, which before was utterly needle&s;s: this confi|dence in redeeming love, which could not po&s;|&s;ibly have any place, till the promi&s;e was made, that the &s;eed of the woman &s;hould brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head.</P>
<P N="6">6. Faith then was originally de&s;igned of God, to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the law of love. Therefore in &s;peaking thus, we are not undervaluing it, or robbing it of its due prai&s;e: but on the contrary &s;hewing its real worth, exalting it in its ju&s;t pro|portion, and giving it that very place which the wi&s;dom of God a&s;&s;igned it from the beginning. It is the grand means of re&s;toring that holy love, wherein man was originally created. It follows, that altho' faith is of no value in it&s;elf (as nei|ther is any other means what&s;oever) yet as it leads to that end, the e&s;tabli&s;hing anew the law of love in our hearts, and as, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, it is the only means under heaven for effecting it: It is, on that account, an un&s;peakable ble&s;&s;ing to man, and of un&s;peak|able value before God.</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. And this naturally brings us to ob&s;erve, Thirdly, the mo&s;t important way of <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h|ing the law:</HI> namely, the e&s;tabli&s;hing it in our own hearts and lives. Indeed without this, what would all the re&s;t avail? we might e&s;tabli&s;h it by our doctrine; we might preach it in its whole extent, might explain and inforce every
<PB N="101" REF="039068_0095_1013938594A27498">part of it. We might open it in its mo&s;t &s;piri|tual meaning, and declare the my&s;teries of the kingdom; we might preach Chri&s;t in all his offices, and faith in Chri&s;t, as opening all the trea&s;ures of his love. And yet all this time, if the law we preached, were not e&s;tabli&s;hed in our hearts, we &s;hould be of no more account before God, than <HI>&s;ounding bra&s;s or tinkling cymbals.</HI> All our preaching would be &s;o far from profiting our&s;elves, that it would only increa&s;e our damnation.</P>
<P N="2">2. This is therefore the main point to be con|&s;idered, how may we e&s;tabli&s;h the law in our own hearts, &s;o that it may have its full influence on our lives? and this can only be done by faith.</P>
<P>Faith alone it is, which effectually an&s;wers this end, as we learn from daily experience. For &s;o long as we walk by faith, not by &s;ight, we go &s;wiftly on in the way of holine&s;s. While we &s;teadily look, not at the things which are &s;een, but at tho&s;e which are not &s;een, we are more and more crucified to the world, and the world crucified to us. Let but the eye of the &s;oul be con&s;tantly fixed, not on the things which are temporal, but on tho&s;e which are eternal, and our affections are more and more loo&s;ened from earth, and fixed on things above. So that faith in general is the mo&s;t direct and effectual mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of promoting all righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holi|ne&s;s: of e&s;tabli&s;hing the holy and &s;piritual law, in the hearts of them that believe.</P>
<P N="3">3. And by faith, taken in its more particular meaning, for a confidence in a pardoning God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> e&s;tabli&s;h his law in our own hearts, in a
<PB N="102" REF="039068_0096_10139388814005C8">&s;till more effectual manner. For there is no motive which &s;o powerfully inclines us to love God, as the &s;en&s;e of the love of God in Chri&s;t. Nothing enables us like a piercing con|viction of this, to give our hearts to him who was given for us. And from this principle of grateful love to God, ari&s;es love to our bro|ther al&s;o. Neither can we avoid loving our neighbour, if we truly believe the love where|with God hath loved us. Now this love to man grounded on faith and love to God, <HI>worketh no ill to</HI> our <HI>neighbour.</HI> Con&s;equently, it is (as the apo&s;tle ob&s;erves) <HI>the fulfilling of the</HI> whole ne|gative <HI>law. For this, thou &s;halt not commit a|dultery, thou &s;halt not kill, thou &s;halt not &s;teal, thou &s;halt not bear fal&s;e witne&s;s, thou &s;halt not covet: and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this &s;aying, thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf.</HI> Neither is love content with barely working no evil to our neighbour. It continually incites us to do good: as we have time, and opportunity, to do good in every po&s;&s;ible kind and in every po&s;&s;ible degree to all men. It is therefore the fulfilling of the po&s;itive likewi&s;e, as well as of the negative law of God.</P>
<P N="4">4. Nor does faith fulfil either the negative or po&s;itive law, as to the external part only: but it works inwardly by love, to the purifying of the heart, the clean&s;ing it from all vile affections. <HI>Every one that hath this</HI> faith <HI>in him&s;elf, purifieth him&s;elf even as he is pure:</HI> Purifieth him&s;elf from every earthly, &s;en&s;ual de&s;ire, from all vile and inordinate affections: yea, from the whole of that carnal mind, which is enmity again&s;t God.
<PB N="103" REF="039068_0097_1013938A0AA84968">At the &s;ame time, if it have its perfect work, it fills him with all goodne&s;s, righteou&s;ne&s;s and truth. It brings all heaven into his &s;oul, and cau&s;es him to walk in the light even as God is in the light.</P>
<P N="5">5. Let us thus endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h the law in our&s;elves: not &s;inning, <HI>becau&s;e we are under Grace,</HI> but rather u&s;ing all the power we receive thereby, <HI>to fulfil all righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Calling to mind, what light we received from God, while his &s;pirit was convincing us of &s;in, let us beware we do not put out that light: what we had then attained let us hold fa&s;t. Let nothing induce us to build again what we have de&s;troyed; to re&s;ume any thing, &s;mall or great, which we then clearly &s;aw was not for the Glory of God, or the profit of our own &s;oul: or to neglect any thing, &s;mall or great, which we could not then neglect, without a check from our own con&s;cience. To increa&s;e and perfect the light which we had before, let us now add the light of faith. Confirm we the former gift of God, by a deeper &s;en&s;e of whatever he had then &s;hewn us: by a greater tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience, and a more exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility of &s;in. Walk|ing now with joy and not with fear, in a clear, &s;teady &s;ight of things eternal, we &s;hall look on plea&s;ure, wealth, prai&s;e, all the things of earth, as on bubbles upon the water: count|ing nothing important, nothing de&s;irable, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> thing worth a deliberate thought, but only what is <HI>within the veil,</HI> where <HI>Je&s;us &s;itteth at the right hand of God.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Can <HI>you</HI> &s;ay, <HI>Thou art merciful to</HI> my <HI>un|righteou&s;ne&s;s: my &s;ins thou remembere&s;t no more?</HI>
<PB N="104" REF="039068_0098_1013938D64FCD770">Then for the time to come, &s;ee that you fly from &s;in, as from the face of a &s;erpent. For how exceeding &s;inful does it appear to you now? How heinous above all expre&s;&s;ion? On the other hand, in how amiable a light do you now &s;ee the holy and perfect will of God? Now therefore labour that it may be fulfilled, both in you, by you, and upon you. Now watch and pray that you may &s;in no more, that you may &s;ee and &s;hun the lea&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of his law. You &s;ee the motes which you could not &s;ee before, as when the &s;un &s;hines into a dark place.

Now be zealous to receive more light daily, more of the knowledge and love of God, more of the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, more of his life, and of the power of his re&s;urrection. Now u&s;e all the knowledge, and love, and life, and power you have already attained. So &s;hall you continually go on from faith to faith. So &s;hall you daily increa&s;e in holy love, till faith is &s;wallowed up in &s;ight, and the law of love is e&s;tabli&s;hed to all eternity.</P>

It is true, there is a &s;ort of religion, nay and it is called chri&s;tianity too, which may be practi&s;ed without any &s;uch imputations, which is generally allowed to be con&s;i&s;tent with common &s;en&s;e. That is, a religion of form, a round of outward duties, performed in a decent, regular manner.

<P N="2">2. And it is no compliment which the men of the world <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay you herein. They, for once, mean what they &s;ay. They not only affirm, but cordially believe, that every man is <HI>be&s;ide him|&s;elf,</HI> who &s;ays, the love of God is &s;hed abroad in his heart, by the Holy Gho&s;t given unto him,
<PB N="106" REF="039068_0100_101393928FA76E58">and that God has enabled him to rejoice in Chri&s;t, with joy un&s;peakable and full of glory.

<P N="3">3. It is ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that the determinate thing which the world accounts madne&s;s, is that utter contempt of all temporal things, and &s;teady pur&s;uit of things eternal; that di|vine conviction of things not &s;een; that re|joicing in the favour of God; that happy, holy love of God; and that te&s;timony of his &s;pirit with our &s;pirit, that we are the children of God. That is, in truth, the whole &s;pirit and life and power of the religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4. They will however allow, in other re&s;pects, the man acts and talks like one in his &s;en&s;es. In other things, he is a rea&s;onable man: 'tis in the&s;e in&s;tances only his head is touched. It is therefore acknowledged, that the madne&s;s under which he labours, is of a particular kind. And accordingly they are accu&s;tomed to di&s;tingui&s;h it by a particular name, ENTHUSIASM.</P>
<P N="5">5. A term this, which is exceeding frequently u&s;ed, which is &s;carce ever out of &s;ome men's mouths. And yet it is exceeding rarely under|&s;tood, even by tho&s;e who u&s;e it mo&s;t. It may be therefore not unacceptable to &s;erious men, to all who de&s;ire to under&s;tand what they &s;peak or hear, if I endeavour to explain the meaning of this term, to &s;hew what <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> is. It may be

<P N="6">6. As to the word it&s;elf, it is generally al|lowed to be of <HI>Greek</HI> extraction. But whence the <HI>Greek</HI> word <GAP DESC="foreign">, is derived, none has yet been able to &s;hew. Some have endeavoured to derive it from
<GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>in God,</HI> becau&s;e all <HI>en|thu&s;ia&s;m</HI> has reference to him. But this is quite forced; there being &s;mall re&s;emblance between the word derived, and tho&s;e they &s;trive to de|rive it from. Others would derive it from <GAP DESC="foreign"><HI>in &s;acrifice,</HI> becau&s;e many of the <HI>enthu|&s;ia&s;ts</HI> of old, were affected in the mo&s;t violent manner, during the time of &s;acrifice.

<P N="7">7. It is not improbable, that one rea&s;on why this uncouth word has been retained in &s;o many Languages, was becau&s;e men were no better agreed, concerning the meaning than concern|ing the derivation of it. They therefore adopted the <HI>Greek</HI> word, becau&s;e they did not under|&s;tand it: they did not tran&s;late it into their own tongues, becau&s;e they knew not how to tran&s;late it: it having been always a word of a loo&s;e, un|certain &s;en&s;e, to which no determinate meaning was affixed.</P>
<P N="8">8. It is not therefore at all &s;urpri&s;ing, that it is &s;o variou&s;ly taken at this day: different per|&s;ons under&s;tanding it in different &s;en&s;es, quite incon&s;i&s;tent with each other. Some take it in a

In this meaning of the word, both the prophets of old, and the apo&s;tles were proper <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;ts:</HI> being at divers times &s;o filled with the &s;pirit, and &s;o influenced by him who dwelt in their hearts, that the exerci&s;e of their own rea&s;on, their &s;en&s;es, and all their natural faculties being &s;u&s;pended, they were wholly actuated by the power of God, and <HI>&s;pake</HI> only <HI>as they were moved by the Holy Gho&s;t</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Others take the word in an indifferent &s;en&s;e, &s;uch as is neither morally good nor evil. Thus they &s;peak of the <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> of the poets; of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> in particular. And this a late eminent writer extends &s;o far as to a&s;&s;ert, there is no man excellent in his profe&s;&s;ion, what &s;oever it be, who has not in his temper a &s;trong tincture of <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI> By <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> the&s;e appear to under&s;tand, an uncommon vigor of thought, a peculiar fervor of &s;pirit, a vivacity and &s;trength not to be found in common men: elevating the &s;oul to greater and higher things, than cool rea|&s;on could have attained.</P>
<P N="10">10. But neither of the&s;e is the &s;en&s;e wherein the word <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> is mo&s;t u&s;ually under&s;tood. The generality of men, if no farther agreed, at lea&s;t agree thus far concerning it, that it is &s;omething evil: and this is plainly the &s;en|timent of all tho&s;e, who call the religion of the heart, <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI> Accordingly I &s;hall take it in the following pages, as an evil; a misfortune, if not a fault.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="109" REF="039068_0103_1013939CD26B2DF0">
11. As to the nature of <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> it is un|doubtedly a di&s;order of the mind; and &s;uch a di&s;order, as greatly hinders the exerci&s;e of rea|&s;on. Nay, &s;ometimes, it wholly &s;ets it a&s;ide: it not only dims, but &s;huts the eyes of the under|&s;tanding. It may therefore well be accounted a &s;pecies of madne&s;s; of madne&s;s rather than of folly: &s;eeing a fool is properly one who draws wrong conclu&s;ions from right premi&s;es: where|as a madman draws right conclu&s;ions, but from wrong premi&s;es. And &s;o does an enthu&s;ia&s;t. Suppo&s;e his premi&s;es true, and his conclu&s;ions would nece&s;&s;arily follow. But here lies his mi&s;|take, his premi&s;es are fal&s;e. He imagines him|&s;elf to be what he is not. And therefore &s;etting out wrong, the farther he goes, the more he wan|ders out of the way.</P>
<P N="12">12. Every <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;t</HI> then is properly a mad|man. Yet his is not an ordinary, but a religious madne&s;s. By religious, I do not mean, that it is any part of religion. Quite the rever&s;e: Re|ligion is, the &s;pirit of a &s;ound mind, and con|&s;equently &s;tands in direct oppo&s;ition to madne&s;s of every kind. But I mean, it has religion for its object; it is conver&s;ant about religion. And &s;o the <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;t</HI> is generally talking of religion, of God or of the things of God; but talk|ing in &s;uch a manner that every rea&s;onable chri&s;|tian may di&s;cern the di&s;order of his mind. <HI>en|thu&s;ia&s;m</HI> in general may then be de&s;cribed in &s;ome &s;uch manner as this: a religious madne&s;s ari&s;ing from &s;ome fal&s;ely imagined influence or in&s;pira|tion of God: at lea&s;t, from imputing &s;ome|thing to God which ought not to be imputed to
<PB N="110" REF="039068_0104_1013939E77814250">him, or expecting &s;omething from God which ought not to be expected from him.</P>
<P N="13">13. There are innumerable &s;orts of <HI>enthu|&s;ia&s;m.</HI> Tho&s;e which are mo&s;t common and for that rea&s;on mo&s;t dangerous, I &s;hall endeavour to reduce under a few general heads, that they may be more ea&s;ily under&s;tood and avoided.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ort of <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> which I &s;hall mention, is that of tho&s;e who imagine they have the <HI>grace</HI> which they have not. Thus &s;ome ima|gine, when it is not &s;o, that they have <HI>redemp|tion</HI> thro' Chri&s;t, <HI>even the forgivene&s;s of &s;in.</HI> The&s;e are u&s;ually &s;uch as <HI>have no root in them|&s;elves;</HI> no deep repentance, or thorough con|viction. <HI>Therefore they receive the word with joy.</HI> And <HI>becau&s;e they have no deepne&s;s of earth,</HI> no deep work in their heart, therefore the &s;eed <HI>im|mediately &s;prings up.</HI> There is immediately a &s;uperficial change, which together with that light joy, &s;triking in with the pride of their unbroken heart, and with their inerdinate &s;elf-love, ea&s;ily per&s;uades them, they have already <HI>ta&s;ted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. This is properly an in&s;tance of the fir&s;t &s;ort of <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m:</HI> It is a kind of madne&s;s, ari&s;ing from the imagination, that they have that grace which in truth they have not: So that they only deceive their own &s;ouls. Madne&s;s it may ju&s;tly be termed: For the rea&s;onings of the&s;e poor men are right, were their premi&s;es good: But as tho&s;e are a mere creature of their own imagination, &s;o all that is built on them falls to the ground. The foundation of all their reveries is this: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> them&s;elves to have faith in Chri&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="111" REF="039068_0105_101393A022DA93B0">had this, they would be <HI>Kings and Prie&s;ts to God,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;t of <HI>a kingdom which cannot be moved.</HI> But they have it not. Con&s;equently, all their follow|ing behaviour, is as wide of truth and &s;oberne&s;s, as that of the ordinary madman, who fancying him&s;elf an earthly king, &s;peaks and acts in that character.</P>
<P N="15">15. There are many other <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;ts</HI> of this &s;ort. Such, for in&s;tance, is the fiery zealot for religion; or (more probably) for the opinions and modes of wor&s;hip, which he dignifies with that name. This man al&s;o &s;trongly imagines him&s;elf to be a believer in Je&s;us, yea, that he is a cham|pion for the faith, which was once delivered to the &s;aints. Accordingly all his conduct is formed, upon that vain imagination. And al|lowing his &s;uppo&s;ition to be ju&s;t, he would have &s;ome tolerable plea for his behaviour: Whereas now it is evidently the effect of a di&s;tempered brain as well as a di&s;tempered heart.</P>
<P N="16">16. But the mo&s;t common of all the <HI>enthu&s;i|a&s;ts</HI> of this kind, are tho&s;e who imagine them|&s;elves Chri&s;tians, and are not. The&s;e abound not only in all parts of our land, but in mo&s;t parts of the habitable earth. That they are not Chri&s;t|ians is clear and undeniable, if we believe the o|racles of God. For Chri&s;tians are holy; the&s;e are unholy: Chri&s;tians love God; the&s;e love the world. Chri&s;tians are humble; the&s;e are proud: Chri&s;tians are gentle; the&s;e are pa&s;&s;ionate. Chri&s;|tians have the mind which was in Chri&s;t; the&s;e are at the utmo&s;t di&s;tance from it. Con&s;equent|ly they are no more Chri&s;tians, than they are Archangels. Yet they imagine them&s;elves &s;o
<PB N="112" REF="039068_0106_101393A5E37CE660">to be; and they can give &s;everal rea&s;ons for it. For they have been <HI>called &s;o</HI> ever &s;ince they can remember: They were <HI>chri&s;tened</HI> many years ago: They embrace the <HI>Chri&s;tian opinions,</HI> vul|garly termed, The Chri&s;tian or Catholic faith. They u&s;e the <HI>Chri&s;tian Modes of Wor&s;hip,</HI> as their fathers did before them. They live what is called a good, <HI>Chri&s;tian life,</HI> as the re&s;t of their neighbours do. And who &s;hall pre&s;ume to think or &s;ay, that the&s;e men are not Chri&s;tians? Tho' without one grain of true faith in Chri&s;t, or of real, inward holine&s;s! without ever having ta&s;ted the love of God, or been <HI>made partakers of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="17">17. Ah poor &s;elf-deceivers! Chri&s;tians ye are not. But you are <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;ts</HI> in an high degree. Phy&s;icians, heal your&s;elves. But fir&s;t, know your di&s;ea&s;e: Your whole life is <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m:</HI> As being all &s;uitable to the imagination, that you have re|ceived that grace of God which you have not. In con&s;equence of this grand mi&s;take, you blunder on, day by day, &s;peaking and acting under a cha|racter, which does in no wi&s;e belong to you. Hence ari&s;es that palpable, glaring incon&s;i&s;tency, that runs thro' your whole behaviour: Which is an aukward mixture of real heatheni&s;m and imaginary Chri&s;tianity. Yet &s;till, as you have &s;o va&s;t a majority on your &s;ide, you will always car|ry it by mere dint of numbers, "That you are the only men in your &s;en&s;es, and all are lunatics who are not as you are." But this alters not the nature of things. In the &s;ight of God and his holy angels, yea, and all the children of God upon earth, you are mere madmen, mere <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;ts</HI>
<PB N="113" REF="039068_0107_101393AAE0FA13E0">all. Are you not? Are you not <HI>walking in a vain &s;hadow,</HI> a &s;hadow of religion, a &s;hadow of happine&s;s?

Do you not fancy your|&s;elves great or good? Very knowing, and very wi&s;e! How long? perhaps till death brings you back to your &s;en&s;es; to be wail your folly for ever and ever!</P>
<P N="18">18. A &s;econd &s;ort of <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> is that of tho&s;e, who imagine they have &s;uch <HI>gifts</HI> from God as they have not. Thus &s;ome have ima|gined them&s;elves to be endued with a power of working miracles, of healing the &s;ick by a word or a touch, of re&s;toring &s;ight to the blind; yea, even of rai&s;ing the dead, a notorious in&s;tance of which is &s;till fre&s;h in our own hi&s;tory. Others have undertaken to prophe&s;y, to foretel things to come, and that with the utmo&s;t certainty and exactne&s;s. But a little time u&s;ually convinces the&s;e <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;ts.</HI> When pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n facts run counter to their predictions, experience performs what rea&s;on could not, and &s;inks them down into their &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P N="19">19. To the &s;ame cla&s;s belong tho&s;e, who in preaching or prayer, imagine them&s;elves to be &s;o influenced by the &s;pirit of God as in fact they are not. I am &s;en&s;ible indeed, that without him we can do nothing; more e&s;pecially in our pub|lic mini&s;try: That all our preaching is utterly vain, unle&s;s it be attended with his power; and all our prayer, unle&s;s his &s;pirit therein help our infirmities. I know, if we do not both preach and pray by the &s;pirit, it is all but lo&s;t labour:
<PB N="114" REF="039068_0108_101393AC941F65D0">Seeing the help that is done upon earth, he doth it him&s;elf, who worketh all in all. But this does not affect the ca&s;e before us. Though there is a real influence of the &s;pirit of God, there is al|&s;o an imaginary one; and many there are who mi&s;take the one for the other. Many &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves to be under that influence, when they are not, when it is far from them. And many others &s;uppo&s;e, they are more under that influ|ence than they really are. Of this number, I fear, are all they who imagine, that God dictates the very words they &s;peak: And that con&s;equent|ly it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould &s;peak any thing ami&s;s, either as to the matter or manner of it. It is well known, how many <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;ts</HI> of this &s;ort al&s;o, have appeared during the pre&s;ent cen|tury: Some of whom &s;peak in a far more autho|ritative manner than either St. <HI>Paul</HI> or any of the Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P N="20">20. The &s;ame &s;ort of <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> though in a lower degree, is frequently found in men of a private character. They may likewi&s;e imagine them&s;elves to be influenced or directed by the &s;pirit when they are not. I allow, <HI>if any man have not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, he is none of his:</HI> And that if ever we either think, &s;peak, or act aright, it is through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit. But how many impute things to him, or expect things from him, without any rational or &s;crip|tural ground? &s;uch are they who imagine, they either do or &s;hall receive <HI>particular directions</HI> from God, not only in points of importance, but in things of no moment, in the mo&s;t trifling circum&s;tances of life. Whereas in the&s;e ca&s;es God has given us our own rea&s;on for a guide:
<PB N="115" REF="039068_0109_101393B11401AC70">Tho' never excluding th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>&s;ecret a&s;&s;i&s;tance</HI> of his Spirit.</P>
<P N="21">21. To this kind of <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> they are pe|culiarly expo&s;ed, who expect to be directed of God, either in &s;piritual things or in common life, in what is ju&s;tly called, an <HI>extraordinary</HI> manner. I mean, by vi&s;ions or dreams, by &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions or &s;udden impul&s;es on the mind. I do not deny, that God has of old times mani|fe&s;ted his will in this manner. Or, that he can do &s;o now. Nay, I believe, he does, in &s;ome very rare in&s;tances. But how frequently do men mi&s;|take herein? How are they mi&s;led by pride and a warm imagination, to a&s;cribe &s;uch impul&s;es or impre&s;&s;ions, dreams or vi&s;ions to God, as are utterly unworthy of him? Now this is all pure <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> all as wide of religion, as it is of truth and &s;oberne&s;s.</P>
<P N="22">22. Perhaps &s;ome may a&s;k, "Ought we not then to inquire, what is <HI>the will of God</HI> in all things? And ought not his will to be the rule of our practice?" Unque&s;tionably it ought. But how is a &s;ober Chri&s;tian to make this inquiry? To know, what is <HI>the will of God?</HI> Not by waiting for &s;upernatural dreams. Not by ex|pecting God to reveal it in vi&s;ions. Not by looking for any <HI>particular impre&s;&s;ions,</HI> or &s;udden impul&s;es on his mind. No: But by con&s;ulting the oracles of God. <HI>To the law and to the te&s;ti|mony.</HI> This is the general method of knowing what i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>the holy and acceptable will of God.</HI></P>
<P N="23">23. "But how &s;hall I know what is <HI>the will of God,</HI> in &s;uch and &s;uch a particular ca&s;e? The thing propo&s;ed is in it&s;elf of an indifferent nature, and &s;o le&s;t undetermined in Scripture." I
<PB N="116" REF="039068_0110_101393B29DD3AE60">an&s;wer, the Scripture it&s;elf gives you a ge|neral rule, applicable to all particular ca&s;es. <HI>The will of God is our &s;anctification.</HI> It is his will that we &s;hould be inwardly and outwardly holy; that we &s;hould <HI>be good and do good</HI> in every kind, and in the highe&s;t degree whereof we are capa|ble. Thus far we tread upon firm ground. This is as clear as the &s;hining of the &s;un. In order therefore to know, what is <HI>the will of God,</HI> in a particular ca&s;e, we have only to apply this ge|neral rule.</P>
<P N="24">24. Suppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, it were propo&s;ed to a rea&s;onable man, to marry, or to enter into a new bu&s;ine&s;s: In order to know, whether this is <HI>the will of God,</HI> being a&s;&s;ured, "It is <HI>the will of God,</HI> concerning me, that I &s;hould be as holy and do as much good as I can," he has only to inquire, "In which of the&s;e &s;tates can I be mo&s;t holy, and do the mo&s;t good?" And this is to be determined, partly by rea&s;on, and partly by experience. Experience tells him what ad|vantages he has in his pre&s;ent &s;tate, either for being or doing good: And rea&s;on is to &s;hew, what he certainly or probably will have in the &s;tate propo&s;ed. By comparing the&s;e, he is to judge, which of the two may mo&s;t conduce to his being and doing good: And as far as he knows this, &s;o far he is certain, what is <HI>the will of God.</HI></P>
<P N="25">25. Mean time, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his &s;pirit is &s;uppo&s;ed, during the whole proce&s;s of the in|quiry. Indeed 'tis not ea&s;y to &s;ay, in how many ways, that a&s;&s;i&s;tance is conveyed. He may bring many circum&s;tances to our remembrance, may place others in a &s;tronger and clearer light; may in|&s;en&s;ibly
<PB N="117" REF="039068_0111_101393B589B94200">&s;en&s;ibly open our mind to receive conviction, and fix that conviction upon our heart. And to a concurrence of many circum&s;tances of this kind, in favour of what is acceptable in his &s;ight, he may &s;uperadd &s;uch an unutterable peace of mind, and &s;o uncommon a mea&s;ure of his love, as will leave us no po&s;&s;ibility of doubting, that <HI>this,</HI> even <HI>this,</HI> is his will concerning us.</P>
<P N="26">26. This is the plain, &s;criptural, rational way to know, what is <HI>the will of God</HI> in a particular ca&s;e. But con&s;idering how &s;eldom this way is taken, and what a flood of <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> mu&s;t needs break in, on tho&s;e who endeavour to know <HI>the will of God,</HI> by un&s;criptural, irrational ways: It were to be wi&s;hed, that the expre&s;&s;ion it&s;elf, were far more &s;paringly u&s;ed. The u&s;ing it, as &s;ome do, on the mo&s;t trivial occa&s;ions, is a plain breach of the third commandment. It is a gro&s;s way of taking the name of God in vain, and betrays great irreverence toward him. Would it not be far better then, to u&s;e other expre&s;&s;ions, which are not liable to &s;uch objections? For ex|ample&mdash;In&s;tead of &s;aying, on any particular oc|ca&s;ion, "I want to know what is <HI>the will of God."</HI> Would it not be better to &s;ay, "I want to know, what will be mo&s;t for my improvement: And, what will make me mo&s;t u&s;eful." This way of &s;peaking is clear and unexceptionable. It is putting the matter on a plain, &s;criptural i&s;|&s;ue, and that without any danger of <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI></P>
<P N="27">27. A third very common &s;ort of <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> (if it does not coincide with the former) is that of tho&s;e who think to attain the end without u&s;ing the means, by the immediate power of God. If indeed tho&s;e means were providen|tially
<PB N="118" REF="039068_0112_101393BA42D528A0">withheld, they would not fall under this charge. God can, and &s;ometimes does, in ca&s;es of this nature, exert his own immediate power. But they who expect this when they have tho&s;e means, and will not u&s;e them, are proper <HI>en|thu&s;ia&s;ts.</HI> Such as they who expect to under&s;tand the holy &s;criptures, without reading them and meditating thereon: Yea, without u&s;ing all &s;uch helps as are in their power, and may probably conduce to that end. Such are they who <HI>de&s;ign|edly</HI> &s;peak in the public a&s;&s;embly, without any premeditation. I &s;ay <HI>de&s;ignedly:</HI> Becau&s;e there may be &s;uch circum&s;tances, as at &s;ome times make it unavoidable. But whoever <HI>de&s;pi&s;es</HI> that great means of &s;peaking profitably, is &s;o far an <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="28">28. It may be expected that I &s;hould mention what &s;ome have accounted, a fourth &s;ort of <HI>en|thu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> namely, The imagining tho&s;e things to be owing to the providence of God, which are not owing thereto. But I doubt. I know not what things they are, which are not owing to the providence of God: In ordering, or, at lea&s;t, in governing of which, this is not either directly or remotely concerned. I except nothing but &s;in: And even in the &s;ins of others, I &s;ee the providence of God to <HI>me.</HI> I do not &s;ay, his <HI>general Providence;</HI> for this I take to be a &s;ounding word, which means ju&s;t nothing. And if there be a <HI>particular Providence;</HI> it mu&s;t extend to all per&s;ons and all things. So our Lord un|der&s;tood it, or he could never have &s;aid, <HI>Even the hairs of your head are all numbered.</HI> And, <HI>Not a &s;parrow falleth to the ground, without the will of your Father which is in Heaven.</HI> But if it be &s;o,
<PB N="119" REF="039068_0113_101393BBCCB989B0">if God pre&s;ides <HI>univer&s;is tanquem &s;ingulis, et &s;in|gulus tanquam univer&s;is;</HI> over the whole univer&s;e as over every &s;ingle per&s;on, over every &s;ingle per|&s;on as over the whole univer&s;e: What is it (ex|cept only our own &s;ins) which we are not to a&s;cribe to the providence of God? So that I can|not apprehend, there is any room here, for the charge of <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI></P>
<P N="29">29. If it be &s;aid, The charge lies here: "When you impute <HI>this</HI> to Providence, you ima|gine your&s;elf the peculiar favourite of heaven." I an&s;wer, you have forgot &s;ome of the la&s;t words I &s;poke, <HI>Prae&s;idet univer&s;is tanquam &s;ingulis.</HI> His Providence is over all men in the univer&s;e, as much as over any &s;ingle per&s;on. Don't you &s;ee, that he who believing this, imputes any thing which befalls him to Providence, does not therein make him&s;elf any more the favourite of heaven, than he &s;uppo&s;es every man under heaven to be? Therefore you have no pretence, upon this ground, to charge him with <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI></P>
<P N="30">30. Again&s;t every &s;ort of this, it behoves us to guard, with the utmo&s;t diligence: Con&s;idering the dreadful effects it has &s;o often produced, and which indeed naturally re&s;ult from it. Its imme|diate offspring is pride; it continually increa&s;es this &s;ource from whence it flows, and hereby it alienates us more and more, from the favour and from the life of God. It dries up the very &s;prings of faith and love: of righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s: Seeing all the&s;e flow from grace. But God <HI>re&s;i&s;teth the proud and giveth grace</HI> only <HI>to the humble.</HI></P>
<P N="31">31. Together with pride there will naturally ari&s;e an unadvi&s;able and unconvincible Spirit. So
<PB N="120" REF="039068_0114_101393BF29F59B90">that into whatever error or fault the <HI>enthu|&s;ia&s;t</HI> falls, there is &s;mall hope of his recovery. For rea&s;on will have little weight with him (as has been ju&s;tly and frequently ob&s;erved) who ima|gines he is led by an higher guide, by the immedi|ate wi&s;dom of God. And as he grows in pride, &s;o he mu&s;t grow in unadvi&s;ablene&s;s and in &s;tub|bornne&s;s al&s;o. He mu&s;t be le&s;s and le&s;s capa|ble of being convinced, le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of per|&s;ua&s;ion; more and more attached to his own judg|ment and his own will, 'till he is altogether fixt and immoveable.</P>
<P N="32">32. Being thus fortified both again&s;t the grace of God, and again&s;t all advice and help from man, he is wholly left to the guidance of his own heart, and of the king of the children of pride. No marvel then that he is daily more rooted and grounded in contempt of all mankind, in furious anger, in every unkind di&s;po&s;ition, in every earthly and devili&s;h temper. Neither can we wonder at the terrible outward effects, which have flowed from &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions in all ages: Even all manner of wickedne&s;s, all the works of darkne&s;s, committed by tho&s;e who call them&s;elves chri&s;tians, while they wrought with greedine&s;s &s;uch things, as were hardly named even among the heathens.</P>
<P>Such is the nature, &s;uch the dreadful effects, of that many-headed mon&s;ter <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m!</HI> From the con&s;ideration of which, we may now draw &s;ome plain inferences, with regard to our own practice.</P>
<P N="33">33. And, Fir&s;t, if <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> be a term, tho' &s;o frequently u&s;ed, yet &s;o rarely under&s;tood,
<PB N="121" REF="039068_0115_101393C0B5109840">take <HI>you</HI> care, not to talk of you know not what, not to u&s;e the word, till you under&s;tand it. As in all other points, &s;o likewi&s;e in this, learn to think before you &s;peak. Fir&s;t, know the mean|ing of this hard word; and then u&s;e it, if need require.</P>
<P N="34">34. But if &s;o few, even among men of edu|cation and learning, much more among the com|mon &s;ort of men, under&s;tand this dark, ambi|guous word, or have any fixt notion of what it means: Then, Secondly, beware of judging or calling any man an <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;t</HI> upon common re|port. This is by no means a &s;ufficient ground, for giving any name of reproach to any man: Lea&s;t of all is it a &s;ufficient ground for &s;o black a term of reproach as this. The more evil it con|tains, the more cautious you &s;hould be, how you apply it to any one: To bring &s;o heavy an accu|&s;ation without full proof, being neither con&s;i&s;t|ent with ju&s;tice nor mercy.</P>
<P N="35">35. But if <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> be &s;o great an evil, be|ware you are not entangled therewith your&s;elf. Watch and pray that you fall not into the temp|tation. It ea&s;ily be&s;ets tho&s;e who fear or love God. O beware you do not think of your&s;elf more highly than you ought to think. Do not imagine you have attained that grace of God to which you have not attained. You may have much joy: You may have a mea&s;ure of love, and yet not have living faith. Cry unto God that he would not &s;uffer you, blind as you are, to go out of the way: That you may never fancy your&s;elf a believer in Chri&s;t, till Chri&s;t is reveal|ed in you, and till his &s;pirit witne&s;&s;es with your &s;pirit, that you are a child of God.</P>
<P N="36"><PB N="122" REF="039068_0116_101393C24A593350">
36. Beware you are not a fiery, per&s;ecuting <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;t.</HI> Do not imagine that God has called you, (ju&s;t contrary to the &s;pirit of him you &s;tile your ma&s;ter) to de&s;troy men's lives, and not to &s;ave them.

<P>And John an&s;wered him &s;aying, Ma&s;ter, we &s;aw one ca&s;ting out devils in thy name, and we for|bade him, becau&s;e he followeth not us.</P>
<P>And Je&s;us &s;aid, Forbid him not.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. IN the prec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eding ver&s;es we read, That after the twelve had been di&s;puting, <HI>which of them &s;hould be the greate&s;t,</HI> Je&s;us <HI>took a little child, and &s;et him in the mid&s;t of them, and taking him in his arms, &s;aid unto them, who&s;oever &s;hall receive one of the&s;e little children in my name, receiveth me: And who&s;oever receiveth me, receiveth not me</HI> only) <HI>but him that &s;ent me.</HI> Then <HI>John an&s;wered</HI> (that is, &s;aid with reference to what our Lord had &s;poken ju&s;t before) <HI>Ma&s;ter, we &s;aw one ca&s;ting out devils in thy name, and we forbade him, be|cau&s;e he followeth not us.</HI> As if he had &s;aid, "Ought we to have received him? In receiving him &s;hould we have received thee? Ought we not rather to have forbidden him? Did not we do well therein? <HI>But Je&s;us &s;aid, Forbid him not.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;ame pa&s;&s;age is recited by St. <HI>Luke,</HI> and almo&s;t in the &s;ame words. But it may be a&s;ked, what is this to us? Seeing no man now <HI>ca&s;ts out devils.</HI> Has not the power of doing this been withdrawn from the church, for twelve
<PB N="125" REF="039068_0119_101393CFD59B6AF8">or fourteen hundred years? How then are <HI>we</HI> concerned in the ca&s;e here propo&s;ed, or in our Lord's deci&s;ion of it?</P>
<P N="3">3. Perhaps more nearly than is commonly imagined, the ca&s;e propo&s;ed being no uncommon ca&s;e. That we may reap our full advantage from it I de&s;ign to &s;hew, Fir&s;t, In what &s;en&s;e men may and do now <HI>ca&s;t out devils:</HI> Secondly, What we may under&s;tand by, <HI>He followeth not us.</HI> I &s;hall, Thirdly, explain our Lord's direction, <HI>Forbid him not,</HI> and conclude with an inference from the whole.</P>
<P N="1">I. 1. I am, in the fir&s;t place to &s;hew, in what &s;en&s;e men may, and do now <HI>ca&s;t out devils.</HI></P>
<P>In order to have the cleare&s;t view of this, we &s;hould remember, that (according to the &s;crip|tural account) as God dwells and works in the children of light, &s;o the devil dwells and works in the children of darkne&s;s. As the holy &s;pirit po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;ouls of good men, &s;o the evil &s;pirit po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;ouls of the wicked. Hence it is that the apo&s;tle terms him, <HI>The god of this world:</HI> From the uncontrolled power he has over worldly men. Hence our ble&s;&s;ed Lord &s;tiles him <HI>the prince of this world:</HI> &s;o ab&s;olute is his domi|nion over it. And hence St. <HI>John, We know that we are of God,</HI> and all who are not of God, <HI>the whole world,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. Not, lieth in wickedne&s;s: but <HI>lieth in the wicked one;</HI> lives and moves in him, as they who are not of the world, do in God.</P>
<P N="2">2. For the devil is not to be con&s;idered only as <HI>a roaring lion, going about &s;eeking whom he may devour:</HI> nor barely as a &s;ubtle enemy, who
<PB N="126" REF="039068_0120_101393D18E514C68">cometh unawares upon poor &s;ouls and <HI>leads them captive at his will:</HI> But as he who dwelleth in them and walketh in them; who <HI>ruleth the dark|ne&s;s</HI> or wickedne&s;s of <HI>this world,</HI> of worldly men and all their dark de&s;igns and actions, by keep|ing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their hearts, &s;etting up his throne there, and bringing every thought into obedience to him&s;elf. Thus the <HI>&s;trong one armed keepeth his hou&s;e;</HI> and if this <HI>unclean &s;pirit</HI> &s;ometimes <HI>go out of a man,</HI> yet he often returns with <HI>&s;even &s;pirits wor&s;e than him&s;elf, and they enter in and dwell there.</HI> Nor can he be idle in his dwelling. He is continually <HI>working in</HI> the&s;e <HI>children of di&s;o|bedience.</HI> He works in them with power, with mighty energy, transforming them into his own likene&s;s, effacing all the remains of the image of God, and preparing them for every evil word or work.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is therefore an unque&s;tionable truth, that the god and prince of this world, &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all who know not God. Only the manner where|in he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them now, differs from that where|in he did it of old time. Then he frequently tormented their bodies, as well as &s;ouls, and that openly, without any di&s;gui&s;e. Now he for|ments their &s;ouls only, (unle&s;s in &s;ome rare ca&s;es) and that as covertly as po&s;&s;ible. The rea&s;on of this difference is plain. It was then his aim to drive mankind into &s;uper&s;tition. Therefore he wrought as openly as he could. But 'tis his aim to drive <HI>us</HI> into infidelity. Therefore he works as privately as he can; for the more &s;ecret he is, the more he prevails.</P>
<P N="4">4. Yet, if we may credit hi&s;torians, there are countries even now, where he works as openly
<PB N="127" REF="039068_0121_101393D319E8DFA0">as aforetime. "But why in &s;avage and barba|rous countries only? Why not in <HI>Italy, France</HI> or <HI>England?</HI>" For a very plain rea&s;on: He knows his men. And he knows what he hath to do with each. To <HI>Laplanders,</HI> he appears barefaced: becau&s;e he is to fix them in &s;uper&s;tition and gro&s;s idolatry. But with you he is pur&s;uing a different point. He is to make you idolize your&s;elves: to make you wi&s;er in your own eyes than God him|&s;elf, than all the oracles of God. Now in order to this, he mu&s;t not appear in his own &s;hape: that would fru&s;trate his de&s;ign. No: he u&s;es all his art, to make you deny his being, till he has you &s;afe in his own place.</P>
<P N="5">5. He reigns therefore, altho' in a different way, yet as ab&s;olute in one land as in the other. He has the gay <HI>Italian</HI> infidel in his teeth, as &s;ure as the wild <HI>Tartar.</HI> But he is fa&s;t a&s;leep in the mouth of the lion, who is too wi&s;e to wake him out of &s;leep. So he only plays with him for the pre&s;ent, and when he plea&s;es &s;wallows him up.</P>
<P>The god of this world holds his <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> wor|&s;hippers full as fa&s;t as tho&s;e in <HI>Lapland.</HI> But it is not his bu&s;ine&s;s to affright them, le&s;t they &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly to the God of heaven. The prince of darkne&s;s therefore does not appear, while he rules over the&s;e his willing &s;ubjects. The con|queror holds his captives &s;o much the &s;afer, be|cau&s;e they imagine them&s;elves at liberty. Thus the <HI>&s;trong one armed keepeth his hou&s;e, and his goods are in peace:</HI> Neither the dei&s;t nor nominal chri&s;tian &s;u&s;pects he is there; &s;o he and they are perfectly at peace with each other.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="128" REF="039068_0122_101393D72E360460">
6. All this while he works with energy in them. He blinds the eyes of their under&s;tand|ing, &s;o that the light of the glorious go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, cannot &s;hine upon them. He chains their &s;ouls down to earth and hell, with the chains of their own vile affections. He binds them down to the earth, by love of the world, love of money, of plea&s;ure, of prai&s;e. And by pride, envy, anger, hate, revenge, he cau&s;es their &s;ouls to draw nigh unto hell: acting the more &s;ecure and uncontrolled, becau&s;e they know not that he acts at all.</P>
<P N="7">7. But how ea&s;ily may we know the cau&s;e from its effects! The&s;e are &s;ometimes gro&s;s and palpable. So they were in the mo&s;t refined of the heathen nations. Go no farther than the ad|mired, the virtuous <HI>Romans.</HI> And you will find the&s;e, when at the height of their learning and glory, <HI>filled with all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s: fornication, wickedne&s;s, covetou&s;ne&s;s, maliciou&s;ne&s;s; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity: whi&s;perers backbiters, de&s;piteful, proud boa&s;ters, di&s;obedient to parents: covenant breakers, without natural affec|tion; implacable, unmerciful.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. The &s;tronge&s;t parts of this de&s;cription are confirmed by one, whom &s;ome may think a more unexceptionable witne&s;s. I mean, their brother heathen, <HI>Dion C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ius:</HI> who ob&s;erves, that before <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI>'s return from <HI>Gaul,</HI> not only gluttony and lewdne&s;s of every kind, were open and bare|faced; not only fal&s;ehood, inju&s;tice and unmer|cifulne&s;s abounded, in public courts as well as private families: but the mo&s;t outrageous rob|beries, rapine and murders, were &s;o frequent in all parts of <HI>Rome,</HI> that few men went out of
<PB N="129" REF="039068_0123_101393D906723520">doors without making their wills, as not know|ing if they &s;hould return alive.</P>
<P N="9">9. As gro&s;s and palpable are the works of the devil, among many (if not all) the modern hea|thens. The <HI>natural religion</HI> of the <HI>Creeks, Cheri|kees, Chica&s;aws</HI> and all other <HI>Indians,</HI> bordering on our &s;outhern &s;ettlements (not of a few &s;ingle men, but of entire nations) is, to torture all their pri&s;oners from morning to night, till at length they roa&s;t them to death; and upon the &s;lighte&s;t unde&s;igned provocation, to come behind and &s;hoot any of their own countrymen. Yea, it is a common thing among them, for the &s;on, if he thinks his father lives too long, to knock out his brains: And for a mother, if &s;he is tired of her children, to fa&s;ten &s;tones about their necks, and throw three or four of them into the river, one after another.</P>
<P N="10">10. It were to be wi&s;hed that none but hea|thens had practi&s;ed &s;uch gro&s;s, palpable works of the devil. But we dare not &s;ay &s;o. Even in cruelty and blood&s;hed, how little have the chri&s;|tians come behind them? And not the <HI>Spaniards</HI> or <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> alone, butchering thou&s;ands in <HI>South-America.</HI> Not the <HI>Dutch</HI> only in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> or the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>North-America,</HI> following the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;tep by &s;tep. Our own country|men too have wantoned in blood, and extermi|nated whole nations: plainly proving thereby, what &s;pirit it is, that dwells and works in the children of di&s;obedience.</P>
<P N="11">11. The&s;e mon&s;ters might almo&s;t make us overlook the works of the devil that are wrought in our own country. But alas! We cannot open our eyes even here, without &s;eeing them on
<PB N="130" REF="039068_0124_101393DDB04865B8">every &s;ide. Is it a &s;mall proof of his power, that common &s;wearers, drunkards, whoremongers, adulterers, thieves, robbers, &s;odomites, mur|derers, are &s;till found in every part of our land? How triumphant does the prince of this world reign, in all the&s;e children of di&s;obedience?</P>
<P N="12">12. He le&s;s openly, but no le&s;s effectually works in di&s;&s;emblers, talebearers, liars, &s;lander|ers: In oppre&s;&s;ors and extortioners: in the per|jured, the &s;eller of his friend, his honuor, his con&s;cience, his country. And yet the&s;e may talk of religion or con&s;cience &s;till, of honour, virtue, and public &s;pirit. But they can no more deceive &s;atan than they can God. He likewi&s;e knows tho&s;e that are his: And a great multitude they are out of every nation and people of whom he has full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at this day.</P>
<P N="13">13. If you con&s;ider this, you cannot but &s;ee in what &s;en&s;e, men may now al&s;o <HI>ca&s;t out devils:</HI> Yea, and every mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t does ca&s;t them out, if his Lord's work pro&s;per in his hand.</P>
<P>By the power of God attending his word, he brings the&s;e &s;inners to repentance: An entire inward as well as outward change, from all evil to all good. And this is, in a &s;ound &s;en&s;e, <HI>to ca&s;t out devils,</HI> out of the &s;ouls wherein they had hitherto dwelt. The &s;trong one can no longer keep his hou&s;e. A &s;tronger than he is come upon him, and hath ca&s;t him out, and taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for him&s;elf, and made it an ha|bitation of God through his Spirit. Here then the energy of &s;atan ends, and the Son of God <HI>de&s;troys the works of the devil.</HI> The under&s;tand|ing of the &s;inner is now enlightened, and his heart
<PB N="131" REF="039068_0125_101393E0D99AF650">&s;weetly drawn to God. His de&s;ires are refined, his affections purified: And being filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, he grows in grace till he is not only holy in heart, but in all manner of conver&s;ation.</P>
<P N="14">14. All this is indeed the work of God. It is God alone who can ca&s;t out &s;atan. But he is generally plea&s;ed to do this by man, as an in&s;tru|ment in his hand; who is then &s;aid, <HI>to ca&s;t out devils in his name,</HI> by his power and authority. And he &s;ends whom he will &s;end upon this great work: but u&s;ually &s;uch as man would ne|ver have thought of. For his <HI>ways are not as our ways, neither his thoughts as our thoughts.</HI> Ac|cordingly he chu&s;es the weak to confound the mighty, the fooli&s;h, to confound the wi&s;e: For this plain rea&s;on, that he may &s;ecure the glory to him&s;elf; that <HI>no fle&s;h may glory in his &s;ight.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. 1. But &s;hall we not <HI>forbid</HI> one who thus <HI>ca&s;teth out devils,</HI> if <HI>he followeth not us?</HI> This it &s;eems was both the judgment and practice of the apo&s;tle, till he referred the ca&s;e to his ma&s;ter. <HI>We forbade him,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>becau&s;e he followeth not us,</HI> which he &s;uppo&s;ed to be a very &s;ufficient rea|&s;on. What we may under&s;tand by this expre&s;|&s;ion, <HI>He followeth not us,</HI> is the next point to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>The lowe&s;t circum&s;tance we can under&s;tand thereby, is, he has no outward connexion with us. We do not labour in conjunction with each other. He is not our fellow-helper in the go&s;|pel. And indeed when&s;oever our Lord is plea&s;ed, to &s;end many labourers into his harve&s;t, they can|not all act, in &s;ubordination to, or connexion
<PB N="132" REF="039068_0126_101393E596EB66B0">with each other. Nay, they cannot all have per|&s;onal acquaintance with, nor be &s;o much as known to one another. Many there will nece&s;&s;arily be in different parts of the harve&s;t, &s;o far from ha|ving any mutual intercour&s;e, that they will be as ab&s;olute &s;trangers to each other, as if they had lived in different ages. And concerning any of the&s;e whom we know not, we may doubtle&s;s &s;ay, <HI>He followeth not us.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. A &s;econd meaning of this expre&s;&s;ion may be, He is <HI>not of our party.</HI> It has long been mat|ter of melancholy con&s;ideration, to all who pray for the peace of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> that &s;o many &s;everal parties are &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, among tho&s;e who are all &s;tiled chri&s;tians. This has been particularly ob&s;ervable in our own countrymen, who have been continually dividing from each other, upon points of no moment, and many times &s;uch as religion had no concern in. The mo&s;t trifling circum&s;tances have given ri&s;e to different parties, which have continued for many generations. And each of the&s;e would be ready to object to one who was on the othe &s;ider, <HI>He followeth not us.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That expre&s;&s;ion may mean, thirdly, He differs from us, in our <HI>religious opinions.</HI> There was a time, when all chri&s;tians were of one mind, as well as of one heart. So great grace was upon them all, when they were fir&s;t filled with the Holy Gho&s;t. But how &s;hort a &s;pace did this ble&s;&s;ing continue? How &s;oon was that una|nimity lo&s;t, and difference of opinion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ang up again, even in the church of Chri&s;t. And that not in nominal, but in real chri&s;tians: Nay in the very chief of them, the apo&s;tles them&s;elves? Nor does it appear, That the difference which
<PB N="133" REF="039068_0127_101393E8F0212EA8">then began, was ever entirely removed. We do not find, that even tho&s;e pillars in the temple of God, &s;o long as they remained upon earth, were ever brought to think alike, to be of one mind, particularly with regard to the ceremonial law. 'Tis therefore no way &s;urpri&s;ing, that infinite varieties of opinion &s;hould now be found in the chri&s;tian church. A very probable con|&s;equence of this is, that whenever we &s;ee any <HI>ca&s;ting out devils,</HI> he will be one that, in this &s;en&s;e, <HI>followeth not us:</HI> that is not of our opinion. 'Tis &s;carce to be imagined he will be of our mind, in all points, even of religion. He may very probably think in a different manner from us, even on &s;everal &s;ubjects of importance: &s;uch as, the nature and u&s;e of the moral law, the eter|nal decrees of God, the &s;ufficiency and efficacy of his grace, and the per&s;everance of his chil|dren.</P>
<P N="4">4. He may differ from us, fourthly, not only in opinion, but likewi&s;e in &s;ome points of prac|tice. He may not approve of that manner of wor&s;hipping God, which is practi&s;ed in our congregation: And may judge that to be more profitable for his &s;oul, which took its ri&s;e from Mr. <HI>Calvin,</HI> or <HI>Martin Luther.</HI> He may have many objections to that liturgy, which we ap|prove of, beyond all others: Many doubts con|cerning that form of church-government, which we e&s;teem both apo&s;tolical and &s;criptural. Per|haps he may go farther from us yet: He may, from a principle of con&s;cience, refrain from &s;e|veral of tho&s;e, which we believe to be the ordi|nances of Chri&s;t. Or if we both agree, That they are ordained of God, there may &s;till re|main
<PB N="134" REF="039068_0128_101393EAB630A670">a difference between us, either as to the manner of admini&s;tering tho&s;e ordinances, or the per&s;ons to whom they &s;hould be admini&s;tred. Now the unavoidable con&s;equences of any of the&s;e differences, will be, that he who thus dif|fers from us, mu&s;t &s;eparate him&s;elf, with regard to tho&s;e points, from our &s;ociety. In this re&s;pect therefore <HI>he followeth not us:</HI> He is <HI>not</HI> (as we phra&s;e it) <HI>of our church.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. But in a far &s;tronger &s;en&s;e, <HI>he followeth not us,</HI> who is not only of a different church, but of &s;uch a church as we account to be in many re|&s;pects anti&s;criptural and antichri&s;tian: A church which we believe to be utterly fal&s;e and erroneous in her doctrines, as well as very dangerou&s;ly wrong in her practice, guilty of gro&s;s &s;uper&s;tition as well as idolatry. A church that has added many articles to the faith, which was once de|livered to the &s;aints; that has dropt one whole commandment of God, and made void &s;everal of the re&s;t by her traditions: And that pretend|ing the highe&s;t veneration for, and &s;tricte&s;t con|formity to the ancient church, has neverthele&s;s brought in numberle&s;s innovations, without any warrant either from antiquity or &s;cripture. Now mo&s;t certainly <HI>he followeth not us,</HI> who &s;tands at &s;o great a di&s;tance from us.</P>
<P N="6">6. And yet there may be a &s;till wider differ|ence than this. He who differs from us in judg|ment or practice, may po&s;&s;ibly &s;tand at a greater di&s;tance from us, in affection than in judgment. And this indeed is a very natural and a very com|mon effect of the other. The differences which begin in points of opinion, &s;eldom terminate there. They generally &s;pread into the affections, and then &s;eparate chief friends. Nor are any
<PB N="135" REF="039068_0129_101393EF8588B3C8">animo&s;ities &s;o deep and irreconcilable, as tho&s;e that &s;pring from di&s;agreement in religion. For this cau&s;e the bittere&s;t enemies of a man, are tho&s;e of his own hou&s;hold. For this the fa|ther ri&s;es again&s;t his own children, and the children again&s;t the father; and perhaps per|&s;ecute each other even to the death, thinking all the time they are doing God a &s;ervice. It is therefore nothing more than we may expect, if tho&s;e who differ from us either in religious opi|nions or practice, &s;oon contract a &s;harpne&s;s, yea bitterne&s;s towards us; if they are more and more prejudiced again&s;t us, till they conceive as ill an opinion of our per&s;ons as of our principles. An almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of this will be, they will &s;peak in the &s;ame manner as they think of us. They will &s;et them&s;elves in oppo&s;ition to us, and as far as they are able hinder our work: &s;ee|ing it does not appear to them to be the work of God, but either of man or of the devil. He that thinks, &s;peaks and acts in &s;uch a manner as this, in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e, <HI>followeth not us.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. I do not indeed conceive, That the per&s;on of whom the apo&s;tle &s;peaks in the text (altho' we have no particular account of him, either in the context, or in any other part of Holy Writ) went &s;o far as this. We have no ground to &s;up|po&s;e, That there was any material difference be|tween him and the apo&s;tles; much le&s;s that he had any prejudice either again&s;t them or their ma&s;ter. It &s;eems we may gather thus much from our Lord's own words, which immediately follow the text, <HI>There is no man which &s;hall do a mi|racle in my name, that can lightly &s;peak evil of me.</HI> But I purpo&s;ely put the ca&s;e in the &s;tronge&s;t light, adding all the circum&s;tances which can
<PB N="136" REF="039068_0130_101393F11125DCB0">well be conceived: That being forewarned of the temptation in its full &s;trength, we may in no ca&s;e yield to it, and fight again&s;t God.</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. Suppo&s;e then a man have no intercour&s;e with us, &s;uppo&s;e he be not of our party, &s;uppo&s;e he &s;eparates from our church, yea and widely dif|fer from us, both in judgment, practice, and affec|tion: Yet if we &s;ee even this man <HI>ca&s;ting out devils, Je&s;us &s;aith, forbid him not.</HI> This import|ant direction of our Lord, I am, in the third place, to explain.</P>
<P N="2">2. If we &s;ee this man ca&s;ting out devils&mdash;But 'tis well, if in &s;uch ca&s;e, we would believe even what we &s;aw with our eyes, if we did not give the lie to our own &s;en&s;es. He mu&s;t be little acquaint|ed with human nature, who does not immediately perceive, how extremely unready we &s;hould be, to believe that any man does ca&s;t out devils, who <HI>followeth not us,</HI> in all or mo&s;t of the &s;en&s;es above recited. I had almo&s;t &s;aid, in any of them: See|ing we may ea&s;ily learn even from what pa&s;&s;es in our own brea&s;ts, how unwilling men are, to al|low any thing good in tho&s;e, who do not in all things agree with them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="3">3. "But what is a &s;ufficient, rea&s;onable proof that a man does (in the &s;en&s;e above) ca&s;t out devils?" The an&s;wer is ea&s;y. Is there full proof, 1. That a per&s;on before us was a gro&s;s, open &s;inner? &s;econdly, that he is not &s;o now; that he has broke off his &s;ins, and lives a chri&s;tian life? And, thirdly, that his change was wrought by his hearing this man preach? If the&s;e three points be plain and undeniable, then you have &s;uf|ficient, rea&s;onable proof, &s;uch as you cannot re|&s;i&s;t
<PB N="137" REF="039068_0131_101393F467F4F548">without wilful &s;in, That this man ca&s;ts out devils.</P>
<P N="4">4. Then <HI>forbid him not.</HI> Beware how you at|tempt to hinder him, either by your authority or arguments or per&s;ua&s;ions. Do not in any wi&s;e &s;trive to prevent his u&s;ing all the power which God has given him. If you have <HI>authority</HI> with him, do not u&s;e that authority, to &s;top the work of God. Do not furni&s;h him with <HI>rea&s;ons,</HI> why he ought not any more to &s;peak in the name of Je&s;us. Satan will not fail to &s;upply him with the&s;e, if you do not &s;econd him therein. <HI>Per&s;uade</HI> him not, to depart from the work. If he &s;hould give place to the devil and you, many &s;ouls might peri&s;h in their iniquity, but their blood would God require at <HI>your</HI> hands.</P>
<P N="5">5. "But what if he be only a <HI>layman</HI> who ca&s;ts out devils? Ought I not to forbid him then?"</P>
<P>Is the fact allowed? Is there rea&s;onable proof, That this man has or does <HI>ca&s;t out devils?</HI> If there is, forbid him not: No, not at the peril of your &s;oul. Shall not God work by whom he will work? <HI>No man can do the&s;e works unle&s;s God is with him,</HI> unle&s;s God hath &s;ent him for this very thing. But if God hath &s;ent him, will you call him back? Will you forbid him to go?</P>
<P N="6">6. "But I do not know, That he is &s;ent of God." <HI>Now herein is a marvellous thing</HI> (may any of the &s;eals of his mi&s;&s;ion &s;ay, any whom he hath brought from &s;atan to God) <HI>that ye know not whence this man is, and behold he hath opened mine eyes! If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</HI> If you doubt the fact, &s;end for the parents of the man: Send for his brethren,
<PB N="138" REF="039068_0132_101393F7B6D283F0">friends, acquaintance. But if you cannot doubt this, if you mu&s;t needs acknowledge, <HI>that a not|able miracle hath been wrought,</HI> then with what con&s;cience, with what face can you <HI>charge</HI> him whom God hath &s;ent, <HI>not to &s;peak any more in his name?</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. I allow, that it is <HI>highly expedient,</HI> whoever preaches in his name, &s;hould have an outward as well as an inward call. But that it is <HI>ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary</HI> I deny.</P>
<P>"Nay, is not the &s;cripture expre&s;s? <HI>No man taketh this honour unto him&s;elf, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron?" Heb.</HI> v. 4.</P>
<P>Numberle&s;s times has this text been quoted on the occa&s;ion, as containing the very &s;trength of the cau&s;e. But &s;urely never was &s;o unhappy a quotation. For fir&s;t, <HI>Aaron</HI> was not called to preach at all He was called <HI>to offer gifts and &s;a|crifice for &s;in.</HI> That was his peculiar employment. Secondly, the&s;e men do not offer &s;acrifice at all; but only preach, which <HI>Aaron</HI> did not. There|fore it is not po&s;&s;ible to find one text in all the bible, which is more wide of the point than this.</P>
<P N="8">8. "But what was the practice of the apo&s;|tolic age?" You may ea&s;ily &s;ee in the <HI>acts of the apo&s;tles.</HI> In the 8th chapter we read, <HI>There was a great per&s;ecution again&s;t the church which was at Jeru&s;alem: And they were all &s;cattered abroad thoughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apo&s;tles.</HI> ver. 1. <HI>Therefore they that were &s;cattered abroad, went everywhere preaching the word.</HI> ver. 4. Now were all the&s;e outwardly called to preach? No man in his &s;en&s;es can think &s;o. Here then is an undeniable proof, what
<PB N="139" REF="039068_0133_101393FC95AC3BA8">was the practice of the apo&s;tolic age. Here you &s;ee not one, but a multitude of <HI>lay-preachers,</HI> men that were only &s;ent of God.</P>
<P N="9">9. Indeed &s;o far is the practice of the apo&s;to|lic age, from inclining us to think it was <HI>un|lawful,</HI> for a man to preach before he was ordain|ed, that we have rea&s;on to think, it was then ac|counted <HI>nece&s;&s;ary.</HI> Certainly the practice and the direction of the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> was, to <HI>prove</HI> a man before he was ordained at all. <HI>Let the&s;e,</HI> the deacons) &s;ays he, <HI>fir&s;t he proved; then let them u&s;e the office of a deacon</HI>&mdash;1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 10. Proved? How? By &s;etting them to con&s;true a &s;entence of of <HI>greek?</HI> And a&s;king them a &s;ew common-place que&s;tions? O amazing proof of a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t! Nay: but by making a clear, open trial <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s is &s;till done by mo&s;t of the prote&s;tant churches in <HI>Europe</HI>) not only whether their lives be holy and unblameable, but whether they have &s;uch gifts as are ab&s;olutely and indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, in order to edify the church of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="10">10. "But what if man has the&s;e? And has brought &s;inners to repentance? And yet the bi&s;hop will not ordain him?" Then the bi&s;hop does <HI>forbid him to ca&s;t out devils.</HI> But I dare not forbid him. I have publi&s;hed my rea&s;ons to all the world. Yet 'tis &s;till in&s;i&s;ted, I ought to do it. You who in&s;i&s;t upon it, an&s;wer tho&s;e rea&s;ons. I know not that any have done this yet, or even made an attempt of doing it. Only &s;ome have &s;po|ken of them as very weak and trifling. And this was prudent enough. For 'tis far ea&s;ier to de&s;pi&s;e, at lea&s;t, &s;eem to de&s;pi&s;e an argument than to an&s;wer it. Yet till this is done I mu&s;t &s;ay,
<PB N="140" REF="039068_0134_101393FE1FF941C8">when I have rea&s;onable proof that any man does ca&s;t out devils, whatever others do, I dare not forbid him, le&s;t I be found even to fight again&s;t God.</P>
<P N="11">11. And who&s;oever thou art that feare&s;t God, <HI>forbid him not,</HI> either directly or indirectly. There are many ways of doing this. You indirectly forbid him, if you either wholly deny, or de&s;pi&s;e and make little account of the work which God has wrought by his hands. You indirectly forbid him, when you di&s;courage him in his work, by drawing him into di&s;putes concerning it, by rai&s;ing objections again&s;t it, or frighting him with con&s;equences, which very po&s;&s;ibly will never be. You forbid him, when you &s;hew any unkindne&s;s toward him, either in language or behaviour: And much more, when you &s;peak of him to others, either in an unkind or a con|temptuous manner: When you endeavour to re|pre&s;ent him to any, either in an odious or a de&s;|picable light. You are forbidding him all the time you are &s;peaking evil of him, or making no account of his labours. O forbid him not in any of the&s;e ways: Nor by forbidding others to hear him, by di&s;couraging &s;inners from hearing that word, which is able to &s;ave their &s;ouls.</P>
<P N="12">12. Yea, if you would ob&s;erve our Lord's di|rections in its full meaning and extent, then re|member his word, <HI>He that is not for us, is again&s;t as; and he that gathereth not with me, &s;cattereth.</HI> He that gathereth not men into the kingdom of God, a&s;&s;uredly &s;catters them from it. For there can be no neuter in this war. Every one is either on God's &s;ide or on Satan's. Are you on God's &s;ide? Then you will not only not
<PB N="141" REF="039068_0135_1013940170126D50">forbid any man that <HI>ca&s;ts out devils,</HI> but you will labour to the uttermo&s;t of your power, to forward him in the work. You will readily acknowledge the work of God, and confe&s;s the greatne&s;s of it. You will remove all difficulties and objections, as far as may be out of his way. You will &s;trengthen his hands by &s;peaking ho|nourably of him before all men, and avowing the things which you have &s;een and heard. You will encourage others to attend upon his word, to hear him whom God hath &s;ent. And you will omit no actual proof of tender love, which God gives you an opportunity of &s;hewing him.</P>
<P N="4">IV. 1. If we willingly fail in any of the&s;e points, if we either directly or indirectly forbid him, <HI>becau&s;e he followeth not us,</HI> then we are <HI>bi|gots.</HI> This is the inference I draw from what has been &s;aid. But the term <HI>bigotry,</HI> I fear, as frequently as it is u&s;ed, is almo&s;t as little under|&s;tood as <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI> It is, too &s;trong an attach|ment to, or fondne&s;s for, our own party, opi|nion, church and religion. Therefore he is a <HI>bigot,</HI> who is &s;o fond of any of the&s;e, &s;o &s;trongly attached to them, as to forbid any who ca&s;t out devils, becau&s;e he differs from him&s;elf, in any or all the&s;e particulars.</P>
<P N="2">2. Do <HI>you</HI> beware of this. Take care, 1. That you do not convict your&s;elf of <HI>bigotry,</HI> by your unreadine&s;s to believe, that any man does ca&s;t out devils, who differs from you. And if you are clear thus far, if you acknowledge the fact, then examine your&s;elf, &s;econdly, Am I not con|victed of <HI>bigotry</HI> in this, in forbidding him, di|rectly or indirectly? Do I not directly forbid him on this ground, becau&s;e he is not of my
<PB N="142" REF="039068_0136_1013940301C5B858"><HI>party?</HI> Becau&s;e he does not fall in with my <HI>opi|nions?</HI> Or becau&s;e he does not wor&s;hip God according to that &s;cheme of <HI>religion,</HI> which I have received from my fathers?</P>
<P N="3">3. Examine your&s;elf, Do I not indirectly at lea&s;t forbid him, on any of the&s;e grounds! Am I not &s;orry, that God &s;hould thus own and ble&s;s a man that holds &s;uch erroneous opinions? Do I not di&s;courage him, becau&s;e he is not of my church? By di&s;puting with him concerning it, by rai&s;ing objections, and by perplexing his mind with di&s;tant con&s;equences? Do I &s;hew no an|ger, contempt or unkindne&s;s of any &s;ort, either in my words or actions? Do I not mention behind his back, his (real or &s;uppo&s;ed) faults? His defects or infirmities? Do not I hinder &s;in|ners from hearing his word? If you do any of the&s;e things, you are a <HI>bigot</HI> to this day.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Search me, O Lord, and prove me. Try out my reins and my heart! Look well if there be any way of</HI> bigotry <HI>in me, and lead me in the way everla&s;t|ing.</HI> In order to examine our&s;elves thoroughly, let the ca&s;e be propo&s;ed in the &s;tronge&s;t manner. What if I were to &s;ee a Papi&s;t, an Arian, a So|cinian ca&s;ting out devils? If I did, I could not forbid even him, without convicting my&s;elf of <HI>bigotry.</HI> Yea, If it could be &s;uppo&s;ed, that I &s;hould &s;ee a Jew, a Dei&s;t or a Turk doing the &s;ame, were I to forbid him either directly or indirectly, I &s;hould be no better than a <HI>bigot</HI> &s;till.</P>
<P N="5">5. O &s;tand clear of this. But be not con|tent with not forbidding any that ca&s;ts out de|vils. 'Tis well, to go thus far, but do not &s;top here. If you will avoid all <HI>bigotry,</HI> go on. In every in&s;tance of this kind, whatever the in&s;tru|ment
<PB N="143" REF="039068_0137_1013940AF380E7F0">be, acknowledge the finger of God. And not only acknowledge, but rejoice in his work and prai&s;e his name with thank&s;giving. Encour|age whom&s;oever God is plea&s;ed to employ, to give him&s;elf wholly up thereto. Speak well of him where&s;oever you are: Defend his character and his mi&s;&s;ion. Enlarge as far as you can his &s;phere of action. Shew him all kindne&s;s in word and deed. And cea&s;e not to cry to God in his behalf, that he may &s;ave both him&s;elf and them that hear him.</P>
<P N="6">6. I need add but one caution. Think not, the <HI>bigotry</HI> of another, is any excu&s;e for your own. 'Tis not impo&s;&s;ible, that one who ca&s;ts out devils him&s;elf, may yet forbid you &s;o to do. You may ob&s;erve, this is the very ca&s;e mentioned in the text. The apo&s;tles forbade another to do what they did them&s;elves. But beware of retort|ing. It is not your part, to return evil for evil. Another's not ob&s;erving the direction of our Lord, is no rea&s;on why you &s;hould neglect it. Nay, but let him have all the <HI>bigotry</HI> to him&s;elf. If he forbids <HI>you,</HI> do not you forbid <HI>him.</HI> Rather labour and watch and pray the more, to confirm your love toward him. If he &s;peaks all manner of Evil of <HI>you,</HI> &s;peak all manner of good (that is true) of <HI>him.</HI> Imitate herein that glorious &s;aying of a great man (O that he had always breathed the &s;ame &s;pirit!) "Let <HI>Luther</HI> call me an hundred devils: I will &s;till reverence him as a me&s;&s;enger of God."</P>

2. But it is &s;ure, there is a peculiar love which we owe to tho&s;e that love God. So David, "All my delight is upon the &s;aints that are in the earth and upon &s;uch as excel in virtue. And &s;o a greater than he, "A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another: As I have loved you, that ye al&s;o love another.

And again, Beloved, let us love one an|other, for love is of God. he that loveth not, knoweth not God: For God is love, chap. iv. 7, 8. Not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and &s;ent his &s;on to be the propitiation for our &s;ins. Beloved, if God &s;o loved us, we ought al&s;o to love one another, ver. 10, 11.</P>
<P N="3">3. All men approve of this. But do all men practi&s;e it? Daily experience &s;hews the contrary. Where are even the Chri&s;tians who <HI>love one ano|ther, as He hath given us commandment?</HI> How many hinderances lie in the way? The two grand, general hinderances are, fir&s;t, that they cannot all think alike: and, in con&s;equence of this, &s;econdly, they cannot all walk alike: But in &s;e|veral &s;maller points their practice mu&s;t differ, in proportion to the difference of their &s;entiments.</P>
<P N="4">4. But altho' a difference in opinions or modes of wor&s;hip, may prevent an entire ex|ternal
<PB N="146" REF="039068_0140_1013941173D65320">union, yet need it prevent our union in affection? Tho' we cannot think alike, may we not love alike? May we not be of one heart, tho' we are not of one opinion? Without all doubt we may. Herein all the children of God may unite, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e &s;maller dif|ferences. The&s;e remaining as they are, they may forward one another, in love and in good works.</P>
<P N="5">5. Surely in this re&s;pect, the example of <HI>Jehu</HI> him&s;elf, as mixt a character as he was of, is well worthy both the attention and imitation, of every &s;erious chri&s;tian. <HI>And when he was departed thence, he lighted on</HI> Jehonadab <HI>the &s;on of</HI> Rechab <HI>coming to meet him. And he &s;aluted him and &s;aid, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And</HI> Jehonadab <HI>an&s;wered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand.</HI></P>
<P>The text naturally divides it&s;elf into two parts, fir&s;t, A que&s;tion propo&s;ed by <HI>Jehu</HI> to <HI>Jehonadab, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?</HI> &s;econdly, An offer made on <HI>Jehonadab</HI>'s an&s;wer|ing, <HI>It is. If it be, give me thine hand.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. 1. And, fir&s;t, let us con&s;ider the que&s;tion propo&s;ed by <HI>Jehu</HI> to <HI>Jehonadab, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?</HI></P>
<P>The very fir&s;t thing we may ob&s;erve in the&s;e words, is that here is no enquiry concerning <HI>Jehonadab</HI>'s opinions. And yet 'tis certain, he held &s;ome which were very uncommon, indeed quite peculiar to him&s;elf: And &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ich had a clo&s;e influence upon practice; on which likewi&s;e he laid &s;o great a &s;tre&s;s, as to entail them upon
<PB N="147" REF="039068_0141_101394164E5DDB40">his children's children, to their late&s;t po&s;terity. This is evidence from the account given by <HI>Jere|miah,</HI> many years after his death. <HI>I took</HI> Jaazani|ah <HI>and his brethren, and all his &s;ons, and the whole hou&s;e of the Rechabites&mdash;and &s;et before them pots full of wine and cups, and &s;aid unto them, drink ye wine. But they &s;aid, we will drink no wine; For</HI> Jonadab (or <HI>Jehonadab) the &s;on of</HI> Rechab <HI>our father</HI> (it would be le&s;s ambiguous if the words were placed thus, Jehonadab <HI>our fa|ther the &s;on of</HI> Rechab: Out of love and reve|rence to whom he probably de&s;ired his de&s;cendants might be called by his name) "commanded us, &s;aying, ye &s;hall drink no wine, neither ye nor your &s;ons for ever.

<P N="2">2. And yet <HI>Jehu</HI> (altho' it &s;eems to have been his manner, both in things &s;ecular and religious, to <HI>drive furiou&s;ly</HI>) does not concern him&s;elf at all with any of the&s;e things, but lets <HI>Jehonadab</HI> abound in his own &s;en&s;e. And neither of them appears to have given the other the lea&s;t di&s;tur|bance, touching the opinions which he main|tained</P>
<P N="3">3. It is very po&s;&s;ible, that many good men now al&s;o may entertain peculiar opinions: And &s;ome of them may be as &s;ingular herein; as even <HI>Jehonadab</HI> was. And 'tis certain, &s;o long as <HI>we know</HI> but <HI>in part,</HI> that all men will not &s;ee all things alike. It is an unavoidable con&s;equence of the pre&s;ent weakne&s;s and &s;hortne&s;s of human under&s;tanding, that &s;everal men will be of &s;everal
<PB N="148" REF="039068_0142_10139417DAB43650">minds, in religion as well as in common life. So it has been from the beginning of the world, and &s;o it will be <HI>till the re&s;titution of all things.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Nay farther: Altho' every man nece&s;&s;arily believes, that every particular opinion which he holds is true (for, to believe any opinions is not true, is the &s;ame thing as, not to hold it:) yet can no man be a&s;&s;ured, that all his own opinions taken together, are true. Nay every thinking man is a&s;&s;ured, they are not: Seeing <HI>humanum e&s;t errare et ne&s;cire.</HI> To be ignorant of many things, and to mi&s;take in &s;ome, is the nece&s;&s;ary condition of humanity. This, therefore, he is &s;en&s;ible is his own ca&s;e. He knows in the general, that he him&s;elf is mi&s;taken. Altho' in what particulars he mi&s;takes, he does not, perhaps he cannot know.</P>
<P N="5">5. I &s;ay, perhaps he cannot know. For who can tell how far invincible ignorance may ex|tend? Or (that comes to the &s;ame thing) in|vincible prejudice: Which is &s;o often fixed in tender minds, that it is afterwards impo&s;&s;ible to tear up what has taken &s;o deep a root. And who can &s;ay, unle&s;s he knew every circum&s;tance at|tending it, how far any mi&s;take is culpable? Seeing all guilt mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome concurrence of the will: Of which he only can judge who &s;earcheth the heart.</P>
<P N="6">6. Every wi&s;e man therefore will allow others the &s;ame liberty of thinking, which he de&s;ires they &s;hould allow him: And will no more in&s;i&s;t on their embracing his opinions, than he would have them to in&s;i&s;t on his embracing theirs. He bears with tho&s;e who differ from him, and only a&s;k him, with whom he de&s;ires to unite in love,
<PB N="149" REF="039068_0143_1013941B57B3C790">that &s;ingle que&s;tion, <HI>Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. We may, &s;econdly, ob&s;erve, That here is no enquiry made concerning <HI>Jehonadah</HI>'s mode of wor&s;hip: Altho' it is highly probably, there was in this re&s;pect al&s;o, a very wide difference between them. For we may well believe <HI>Jeho|nadab</HI> as well as all his po&s;terity, wor&s;hipped God at <HI>Jeru&s;alem:</HI> Whereas <HI>Jehu</HI> did not; he had more regard to &s;tate-policy than religion. And therefore altho' he &s;tew the wor&s;hippers of <HI>Baal, and de&s;troyed</HI> Baal <HI>out of</HI> I&s;rael: Yet <HI>from the</HI> convenient <HI>&s;in of</HI> Jereboam, the wor&s;hip of <HI>the golden calves, he departed not.</HI> 2 <HI>Kings</HI> x. 29.</P>
<P N="8">8. But even among men of an upright heart, men who de&s;ire to <HI>have a con&s;cience void of of|fence,</HI> it mu&s;t needs be, that as long as there are various opinions, there will be various ways of wor&s;hipping God: &s;eeing a variety of opinions nece&s;&s;arily implies a variety of practice. And as in all ages, men have differed in nothing more than in their opinions concerning the Supreme Being, &s;o in nothing have they more differed from each other, than in the manner of wor|&s;hipping him. Had this been only in the hea|then world, it would not have been at all &s;ur|pri&s;ing. For we know the&s;e <HI>by their wi&s;dom knew not God;</HI> nor therefore could they know how to wor&s;hip him. But is it not &s;trange, that even in the chri&s;tian world, although they all agree in the general, <HI>God is a Spirit, and they that wor&s;hip him mu&s;t wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth:</HI> Yet the particular modes of wor&s;hipping God, are almo&s;t as various as among the hea|thens?</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="150" REF="039068_0144_1013941D19ABB378">
9. And how &s;hall we chu&s;e, among &s;o much variety? No man can chu&s;e for, or pre&s;cribe to another. But every one mu&s;t follow the dic|tates of his own con&s;cience, in &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity. He mu&s;t be fully per&s;uaded in his own mind, and then act according to the be&s;t light he has. Nor has any creature power to con&s;train another to walk by his own rule. God has given no right to any of the children of men, thus to lord it over the con&s;cience of his brethren. But every man mu&s;t judge for him|&s;elf, as every man mu&s;t give an account of him|&s;elf to God.</P>
<P N="10">10. Altho' therefore every follower of Chri&s;t is obliged by the very nature of the Chri&s;tian in&s;titution, to be a member of &s;ome particular congregation or other, &s;ome church, as it is u&s;ually termed: (which implies a particular man|ner of wor&s;hipping God; for <HI>two cannot walk together unle&s;s they be agreed:)</HI> Yet none can be obliged by any power on earth, but that of his own con&s;cience, to prefer this or that congre|gation to another, this or that particular man|ner of wor&s;hip. I know it is commonly &s;uppo|&s;ed, that the place of our birth, fixes the church to which we ought to belong: That one, for in&s;tance, who is born in <HI>England</HI> ought to be a member of that which is &s;tiled <HI>the church of England,</HI> and con&s;equently to wor&s;hip God in the particular manner which is pre&s;cribed by that church. I was once a zealous maintainer of this: But I find many rea&s;ons to abate of this zeal. I fear, it is attended with &s;uch difficul|ties, that no rea&s;onable man can get over. Not
<PB N="151" REF="039068_0145_1013942387709638">the lea&s;t of which is, that if this rule had took place, there could have been no reformation from popery: Seeing it entirely de&s;troys the right of private judgment, on which that whole reforma|tion &s;tands.</P>
<P N="11">11. I dare not therefore pre&s;ume to impo&s;e my mode of wor&s;hip on any other. I believe it is truly primitive and apo&s;tolical. But my belief is no rule for another. I a&s;k not therefore of him with whom I would unite in love. "Are you of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y church? of my congregation?

<P>For from hence we may learn, Fir&s;t, That a <HI>catholic &s;pirit,</HI> is not <HI>&s;peculative latitudinariani&s;m.</HI> It is not an indifference to all opinions. This is the &s;pawn of hell, not the offspring of heaven. This un&s;ettledne&s;s of thought, this being "driven to and fro and to&s;t about with every wind of doc|trine," is a great cur&s;e not a ble&s;&s;ing; an irre|concileable enemy not a friend to true <HI>catholic|i&s;m.</HI> A man of a truly <HI>catholic &s;pirit,</HI> has not now his religion to &s;eek.

But as this does not &s;hew any wavering in his own mind, &s;o neither does it occa&s;ion any. He does not halt between two opinions, nor vainly endeavour to blend them into one.

<P N="2"><PB N="160" REF="039068_0154_1013943F8CBD42D0">
2. From what has been &s;aid we may learn, Secondly, That a <HI>catholic &s;pirit</HI> is not any kind of <HI>practical latitudinariani&s;m.</HI> It is not indiffe|rence as to public wor&s;hip, or as to the out|ward manner of performing it. This likewi&s;e would not be a ble&s;&s;ing but a cur&s;e. Far from being an help thereto, it would &s;o long as it re|mained be an un&s;peakable hinderance to the wor|&s;hipping of God in &s;pirit and in truth. But the man of a truly <HI>catholic &s;pirit,</HI> having weighed all things in the balance of the &s;anctuary, has no doubt, no &s;cruple at all concerning that par|ticular mode of wor&s;hip wherein he joins. He is clearly convinced, that <HI>this</HI> manner of wor&s;hip|ping of God is both &s;criptural and rational. He knows none in the world, which is more &s;criptu|ral, none which is more rational. Therefore without rambling hither and thither, he cleaves clo&s;e thereto, and prai&s;es God for the opportuni|nity of &s;o doing.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence we may, Thirdly, learn, That a <HI>catholic &s;pirit</HI> is not indifference to all congre|gations. This is another &s;ort of latitudinariani&s;m no le&s;s ab&s;urd and un&s;criptural than the former. But it is far from a man of a truly <HI>catholic &s;pirit.</HI> He is fixt in his congregation as well as his principles. He is united to one, not only in &s;pirit, but by all the outward ties of chri&s;tian fellow&s;hip. There he partakes of all the ordinances of God. There he receives the Supper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Lord. There he pours out his &s;oul in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ic prayer, and joins in public prai&s;e and thank&s;giving. There he rejoices to hear the word of reconciliation, the go&s;pel of the
<PB N="161" REF="039068_0155_10139442DF8B68B0">grace of God. With the&s;e his neare&s;t, his be&s;t beloved brethren, on &s;olemn occa&s;ions he &s;eeks God by fa&s;ting. The&s;e particularly he watches over in love, as they do over his &s;oul, admo|ni&s;hing, exhorting, comforting, reproving, and every way building up each other in the faith. The&s;e he regards as his own hou&s;hold, and therefore according to the ability God has giv|en him, naturally cares for them, and provides that they may have all the things that are need|ful for life and godline&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4. But while he is &s;teadily fixt in his religious principles, in what he believes to be the truth as it is in Je&s;us; while he firmly adheres to that wor&s;hip of God, which he judges to be mo&s;t acceptable in his &s;ight, and while he is united by the tendere&s;t and clo&s;e&s;t ties, to one particular congregation: his heart is enlarged toward all mankind, tho&s;e he knows and tho&s;e he does not: he embraces with &s;trong and cordial affection, neighbours and &s;trangers, friends and enemies. This is catholick or univer&s;al love. And he that has this, is of a <HI>catholic &s;pirit.</HI> For love alone gives the title to this character. Catholic love is a <HI>catholic &s;pirit.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. But if we take this word in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, a man of a <HI>catholic &s;pirit,</HI> is one who in the manner above mentioned, <HI>gives his hand</HI> to all who&s;e <HI>hearts are right with his heart.</HI> One who knows how to value and prai&s;e God, for all the advantages he enjoys; with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rd to the knowledge of the things of God, the true &s;criptural manner of wor&s;hipping him; and above all, his union with a congregation, fearing
<PB N="162" REF="039068_0156_101394481E7EE280">God and working righteou&s;ne&s;s. One who retaining the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings with the &s;tricte&s;t care, keeping them as the apple of his eye, at the &s;ame time love as friends, as brethren in the Lord, as members of Chri&s;t and children of God, as joint partakers now of the pre&s;ent kingdom of God, and fellow heirs of his eternal kingdom, all of whatever opinion or wor&s;hip or congregation, who believe in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who love God and man; who rejoice to plea&s;e and fearing to offend God, are careful to ab&s;tain from evil and zealous of good works. He is the man of a truly <HI>catholic &s;pirit,</HI> who bears all the&s;e continu|ally upon his heart, who having an un&s;peakable tenderne&s;s for their per&s;ons, and longing for their welfare, does not cea&s;e to commend them to God in prayer, as well as to plead their cau&s;e before men; who &s;peaks comfortably to them, and la|bours by all his words to &s;trengthen their hands, in God. He a&s;&s;i&s;ts them to the uttermo&s;t of his power in all things, &s;piritual and temporal. He is ready "To &s;pend and be &s;pent for them; <HI>yea,</HI> to lay down his life for their &s;ake."</P>
<P N="6">6. Thou, O man of God, think on the&s;e things. If thou art already in this way, go on. If thou ha&s;t heretofore mi&s;took the path, ble&s;s God who hath brought thee back.

<HEAD><HI>CHRISTIAN PERFECTION.</HI> A SERMON</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ON PHILIPPIANS iii. 12.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. THERE is &s;carce any expre&s;&s;ion in holy writ, which has given more offence than this. The word <HI>perfect</HI> is what many can|not bear. The very &s;ound of it is an abomi|nation to them. And who&s;oever <HI>pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ches perfec|tion</HI> (as the phra&s;e is) <HI>i. e.</HI> a&s;&s;erts that it is attain|able in this life, runs great hazard of being ac|counted by them, wor&s;e than a heathen man or a publican.</P>
<P N="2">2. And hence &s;ome have advi&s;ed; wholly to lay a&s;ide the u&s;e of tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions; "becau&s;e they have given &s;o great offence." But are they not found in the oracles of God? If &s;o, by what authority, can any me&s;&s;enger of God lay them a&s;ide, even tho' all men &s;hould be offended? We have not &s;o learned Chri&s;t; neither may we thus give place to the devil. What&s;oever God hath &s;poken, that will we &s;peak, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ther <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> will hear, or whether they will forbear: Know|ing that then alone can any mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t be <HI>part from the blood of all men,</HI> when he hath <HI>not &s;hunned to declare unto them all the coun&s;el of God.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="164" REF="039068_0158_1013944CC676C518">
3. We may not therefore lay the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions a&s;ide, &s;eeing they are the words of God, and not of man. But we may, and ought to ex|plain the meaning of them; that tho&s;e who are &s;incere of heart, may not err to the right-hand or to the left, from the mark of the prize of their high calling. And this is the more needful to be done, becau&s;e in the ver&s;e already repeated, the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of him&s;elf as not perfect: <HI>Not,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>as tho' I were already perfect.</HI> And yet immediately after, in the fifteenth ver&s;e, he &s;peaks of him&s;elf, yea and many others, as per|fect. <HI>Let us,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>as many as be perfect, be thus minded.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. In order therefore to remove the difficulty ari&s;ing from this &s;eeming contradiction, as well as to give light to them who are pre&s;&s;ing for|ward to the mark, and that tho&s;e who are lame be not turned out of the way, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew,
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> In what &s;en&s;e chri&s;tians are <HI>not,</HI> and,</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> In what &s;en&s;e they are <HI>perfect.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. 1. In the fir&s;t place I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, in what &s;en&s;e chri&s;tians are <HI>not perfect.</HI> And both from experience and &s;cripture it ap|pears, fir&s;t, that they are not perfect in know|ledge: They are not <HI>&s;o</HI> perfect in this life, as to be free from ignorance. They know, it may be in common with other men, many things re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ing to the pre&s;ent world: And they know, with regard to the world to come, the general truths which God hath revealed. They know likewi&s;e (what <HI>the natural man receiveth not;</HI> for the&s;e things <HI>are &s;piritually di&s;cerned</HI>) "What man|ner
<PB N="165" REF="039068_0159_1013944E51C8D370">of love it is, wherewith the Father hath loved them, that they &s;hould be called the &s;ons of God;" They know <HI>the mighty working of his &s;pirit</HI> in their hearts, and the wi&s;dom of his providence, directing all their paths, and cau&s;ing all things to work together for their good. Yea, they know in every circum&s;tance of life, what the Lord requireth of them, and how "to keep a con&s;cience void of offence both toward God and toward man."</P>
<P N="2">2. But innumerable are the things which they know not. "Touching the Almighty him&s;elf, they cannot &s;earch him out to perfection. Lo, the&s;e are but a part of his ways; but the thun|der of his power, who can under&s;tand?" <HI>They cannot under&s;tand, I will not &s;ay,</HI> "how there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and the&s;e three are one;" Or how the eternal Son of God "took upon him&s;elf the form of a &s;ervant:" But not any one attribute, not any one circum&s;tance of Divine Nature. Neither is it for them <HI>to know the times and &s;ea&s;ons,</HI> when God will work his great works upon the earth; no note ven tho&s;e which he hath in part revealed, by his &s;ervants and prophets, &s;ince the world began. Much le&s;s do they know, when God having "accompli&s;hed the number of his elect will ha&s;ten his kingdom: When the heavens &s;hall pa&s;s away with a great noi&s;e, and the elements &s;hall melt with fervent heat."</P>
<P N="3">3. They know not the rea&s;ons even of many of his pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ations with the &s;ons of men: But are con&s;trained to re&s;t here, though "Clouds and darkne&s;s are round about him, righteou&s;|ne&s;s
<PB N="166" REF="039068_0160_101394531B9E3890">and judgment are the habitation of his feat." Yea, often with regard to his dealings with them&s;elves doth their Lord &s;ay unto them, "What I do, thou knowe&s;t not now; but thou &s;halt know hereafter." And how little do they know, of what is ever before them, of even the vi&s;ible works of his hands? How "he &s;preadeth the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing?" How he unites all the parts of this va&s;t machine by a &s;ecret chain which can|not be broken? So great is the ignorance, &s;o ve|ry little the knowledge of even the be&s;t of men.</P>
<P N="2">II. 4. No one then is &s;o perfect in this life, as to be free from ignorance. Nor, &s;econdly, from mi&s;take, which indeed is almo&s;t an unavoid|able con&s;equence of it: &s;eeing tho&s;e who <HI>know but in part,</HI> are ever liable to err, touching the things which they know not. 'Tis true, the chil|dren of God do not mi&s;take, as to the things e&s;&s;ential to &s;alvation. They do not "put dark|ne&s;s for light, or light for darkne&s;s," neither "&s;eek death in the error of their life." For they <HI>are taught of God,</HI> and the way which he teacheth them, the way of holine&s;s is &s;o plain, that "the wayfaring man though a fool, need not err, therein." But in things une&s;&s;ential to &s;alvation, they do err, and that frequently. The be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of men are frequently mi&s;taken, even with regard to facts: believing tho&s;e things not to have been, which really were, or tho&s;e to have been done, which were not. Or &s;uppo&s;e they are not mi&s;taken as to the fact it&s;elf, they may be, with regard to its circum&s;tances; believing them, or many of them, to have been quite different, from what in truth they were. And hence cannot
<PB N="167" REF="039068_0161_10139457EF920250">but ari&s;e many farther mi&s;takes. Hence they may believe either pa&s;t or pre&s;ent actions, which were, or are evil, to be good; and &s;uch as were, or are good, to be evil. Hence al&s;o they may judge, not according to truth, with re|gard to the characters of men: And that not only by &s;uppo&s;ing good men to be better, or wicked men to be wor&s;e than they are; but by believing them to have been, or to be good men, who were, or are very wicked: Or, perhaps, tho&s;e to have been, or to be wicked men, who were, or are holy and unreproveable.</P>
<P N="5">5. Nay, with regard to the holy &s;criptures them&s;elves, as careful as they are to avoid it, the be&s;t of men are liable to mi&s;take, and do mi&s;|take day by day: E&s;pecially, with re&s;pect to tho&s;e parts-thereof, which le&s;s immediately relate to practice. Hence even the children of God are not agreed, as to the interpretation of many places in holy writ: Nor i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their difference of opinion any proof that they are not the chil|dren of God on either &s;ide. But it is a proof, that we are no more to expect any living man, to be <HI>infallible</HI> than to be <HI>omni&s;cient.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. If it be objected to what has been ob&s;erved under this and the preceding head, that St. <HI>John</HI> &s;peaking to his brethren in the faith, &s;ays, <HI>Ye, have an unction from the holy one, and know all things,</HI> 1. John ii. 20. The an&s;wer is plain, "Ye know all things that are needful for your &s;oul's health." That the apo&s;tle never de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">d to extend this farther, that he could not &s;peak <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t in an ab&s;olute &s;en&s;e, is clear fir&s;t from hence, that otherwi&s;e he would de&s;cribe the di&s;ciple as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his Ma&s;ter;</HI> &s;eeing Chri&s;t him&s;elf, as man,
<PB N="168" REF="039068_0162_1013945979AE1148">knew not all things.&mdash;<HI>Of that hour,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>knoweth no man, no not the Son, but the Father only.</HI> It is clear, &s;econdly, from the apo&s;tle's own words that follow: "The&s;e things have I written unto you concerning them that deceive you:" As well as from his frequently repeated caution, <HI>let no man deceive you;</HI> which had been altogether need|le&s;s, had not tho&s;e very per&s;ons, who had that unction from the holy one been liable not to ignorance only; but to mi&s;take al&s;o.</P>
<P N="7">7. Even chri&s;tians therefore are not <HI>&s;o</HI> perfect, as to be free either from ignorance or error. We may, thirdly, add; nor from infirmities. Only let us take care to under&s;tand this word aright. Only let us not give that &s;oft title to known &s;ins, as the manner of &s;ome is. So, one man tells us,
<Q>Every man has his infirmity, and mine is drunkenne&s;s:</Q> Another has the infirmity of uncleanne&s;s; another of taking God's holy name in vain. And yet another has the infirmity of calling his brother, <HI>thou fool,</HI> or returning <HI>railing for railing.</HI> It is plain, that all you who thus &s;peak, if ye repent not, &s;hall with your infirmities, go quick into hell. But I mean hereby, not only tho&s;e which are properly termed <HI>bodily infirmities,</HI> but all tho&s;e inward or outward imperfections, which are not of a moral nature. Such are weakne&s;s or &s;lowne&s;s of un|der&s;tanding, dullne&s;s or confu&s;edne&s;s of appre|hen&s;ion, incoherency of thought, irregular quick|ne&s;s or heavine&s;s of imagination. Such (to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|tion no more of this kind) is the want of a ready or retentive memory. Such in another kind are, tho&s;e commonly in &s;ome mea&s;ure con&s;equent upon the&s;e: Namely, &s;lowne&s;s of &s;peech, impropriety of
<PB N="169" REF="039068_0163_1013945CAAABEB70">language, ungracefulne&s;s of pronunciation; to which one might add a thou&s;and namele&s;s de|fects, either in conver&s;ation or behaviour. The&s;e are the infirmities which are found in the be&s;t of men, in a larger or &s;maller proportion. And from the&s;e none can hope to be perfectly freed, till the &s;pirit returns to God that gave it.</P>
<P N="8">8. Nor can we expect till then, to be wholly free from temptation. Such perfection belong|eth not to this life. It is true, there are tho&s;e who being given up to work all uncleanne&s;s with greedine&s;s, &s;carce perceive the temptations which they re&s;i&s;t not, and &s;o &s;eem to be without temptation. There are al&s;o many whom the wi&s;e enemy of &s;ouls &s;eeing to be fa&s;t a&s;leep in the dead form of godline&s;s, will not tempt to gro&s;s &s;in, le&s;t they &s;hould awake, before they drop into everla&s;ting burnings. I know, there are al&s;o children of God who being now <HI>ju&s;tified freely,</HI> having found <HI>redemption in the blood of Chri&s;t,</HI> for the pre&s;ent feel no temptation. God hath &s;aid to their enemies, "Touch not mine anoint|ed, and do my children no harm." And for this &s;ea&s;on, it may be for weeks or months, he cau&s;eth them to <HI>ride on high places,</HI> be beareth them as on eagles wings, above all the fiery darts of the wicked one. But this &s;tate will not la&s;t always, as we may learn from that &s;ingle con&s;ideration, that the Son of God him&s;elf, in the days of his fle&s;h was tempted even to the end of his life. Therefore &s;o let his &s;ervant expect to be; for <HI>it is enough that he be as his ma&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P N="9"><PB N="170" REF="039068_0164_1013945FF39B9410">
9. Chri&s;tian perfection therefore does not im|ply (as &s;ome men &s;eem to have imagined an ex|emption either from ignorance or mi&s;take, or infirmities or temptations. Indeed it is only another term for holine&s;s. They are two names for the &s;ame thing. Thus, every one that is holy, is in the &s;cripture &s;en&s;e, perfect. Yet we may, la&s;tly, ob&s;erve, that neither in this re&s;pect is there any ab&s;olute perfection on earth. There is no <HI>Perfection of degrees,</HI> as it is termed; none which does not admit of a continual increa&s;e. So that how much &s;oever any man has attained, or in how high a degree &s;oever he is perfect, he hath &s;till need to <HI>grow in grace,</HI> and daily to advance in the knowledge and love of God his Saviour.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. In what &s;en&s;e then are chri&s;tians per|fect? This is what I &s;hall endeavour, in the &s;e|cond place to &s;hew. But it &s;hould be premi&s;ed, that there are &s;everal &s;tages in chri&s;tian life as in natural: Some of the children of God being but new born babes; others having attained to more maturity. And accordingly St. <HI>John,</HI> in his fir&s;t epi&s;tle (chap. ii. 12, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) applies him&s;elf &s;everally, to tho&s;e he terms little children, tho&s;e he &s;tiles young men, and tho&s;e whom he entitles fathers. "I write unto you, little children," &s;aith the apo&s;tle, "becau&s;e your &s;ins are forgiven you:" Becau&s;e thus far you have attained, being "ju&s;ti|fied freely you have peace with God, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t. I write unto you, young men, becau&s;e ye have overcome the wicked one; or (as he after|wards addeth) becau&s;e ye are &s;trong, and the word of God abideth in you." Ye have quenched the
<PB N="171" REF="039068_0165_10139464D68B1288">fiery darts of the wicked one, the doubts and fears, wherewith he di&s;turbed your fir&s;t peace; and the witne&s;s of God that your &s;ins are forgiven, now <HI>abideth in your heart.</HI> "I write unto you, fathers, becau&s;e ye have known him that is from the be|ginning." Ye have known both the Father and the Son, and the Spirit of Chri&s;t in your inmo&s;t &s;oul Ye are "perfect men, being grown up to the mea&s;ure of the &s;tature of the fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t."</P>
<P N="2">2. It is of the&s;e chiefly I &s;peak in the latter part of this di&s;cour&s;e. For the&s;e only are per|fect chri&s;tians. But even babes in Chri&s;t are in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e perfect, or <HI>born of God</HI> (an ex|pre&s;&s;ion taken al&s;o in divers &s;en&s;es) as fir&s;t, Not to commit &s;in. If any doubt of this privilege of the &s;ons of God, the que&s;tion is not to be de|cided by ab&s;tract rea&s;onings, which may be drawn out into an endle&s;s length, and leave the point ju&s;t as it was before. Neither is it to be determined by the experience of this or that par|ticular per&s;on. Many may &s;uppo&s;e they do not commit &s;in, when they do; but this proves no|thing either way. "To the law and to the te&s;ti|mony," we appeal. "Let God be true, and every man a liar." By his word will we abide, and that alone. Hereby we ought to be judged.</P>
<P N="3">3. Now the word of God plainly declares, that even tho&s;e who are ju&s;tified, who are born again in the lowe&s;t &s;en&s;e, <HI>do not continue in &s;in;</HI> that they cannot "live any longer therein (Rom. vi. 1, 2.) <HI>that they are</HI> planted together in the like|ne&s;s of the death of Chri&s;t (ver. 5.) <HI>That their</HI> old man is crucified with him, the body of &s;in be|ing de&s;troyed, &s;o that thenceforth they do not &s;erve &s;in: <HI>that</HI> being dead with Chri&s;t, they are freed from
<PB N="172" REF="039068_0166_101394665FB48BF0">&s;in," (ver. 6, 7.) that they are <HI>dead unto &s;in,</HI> and <HI>alive unto God</HI> (ver. 11.) That "&s;in hath no more dominion over them, <HI>who are</HI> not under the law, but under grace; <HI>but that the&s;e</HI> being free from &s;in, are become the &s;ervants of righteou&s;ne&s;s," ver&s;es 14, 18.</P>
<P N="4">4. The very lea&s;t which can be implied in the&s;e words, is, that the per&s;ons &s;poken of therein, namely, all real chri&s;tians or believers in Chri&s;t, are made free from outward &s;in. And the &s;ame freedom which St <HI>Paul</HI> here expre&s;&s;es in &s;uch variety of phra&s;es, St. <HI>Peter</HI> expre&s;&s;es in that one (1 Pet. iv. 1, 2.) "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that hath &s;uffered in the fle&s;h, hath cea&s;ed from &s;in,&mdash;that he no longer &s;hould live&mdash;to the de&s;ires of men, but to the will of God." For this <HI>cea&s;ing from &s;in,</HI> if it be in|terpreted in the lowe&s;t &s;en&s;e, as regarding only the outward behaviour, mu&s;t denote the cea&s;ing from the outward act, from any outward tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion of the law.</P>
<P N="5">5. But mo&s;t expre&s;s are the well known words of St. <HI>John,</HI> in the third chapter of his fir&s;t epi&s;|tle, ver&s;e the eighth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> "He that commit|eth &s;in is of the devil; for the devil &s;inneth from the beginning. For this purpo&s;e the &s;on of God was manife&s;ted, that he might de&s;troy the works of the devil. Who&s;oever is born of God, doth not commit &s;in. For his &s;eed remaineth in him, and he cannot &s;in, becau&s;e he is born of God." And tho&s;e in the fifth, chap. ver&s;e 18. "We know that who|&s;oever is born of God &s;inneth not. But he that is begotten of God keepeth him&s;elf, and that wick|ed one toucheth him not."</P>
<P N="6">6. Indeed it is &s;aid, this means only, he &s;in|neth not <HI>wilfully;</HI> or he doth not commit &s;in
<PB N="173" REF="039068_0167_10139469A0123098"><HI>habitually;</HI> or, <HI>not as other men do;</HI> or, <HI>not as he did before.</HI> But by whom is this &s;aid? By St. <HI>John?</HI> No. There is no &s;uch word in the text: Nor in the whole chapter; nor in all this epi&s;tle; nor in any part of his writings what|&s;oever. Why then, the be&s;t way to an&s;wer a bold a&s;&s;ertion is, &s;imply to deny it. And if any man can prove it from the word of God, let him bring forth his &s;trong rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="7">7. And a &s;ort of rea&s;on there is, which has been frequently brought to &s;upport the&s;e &s;trange a&s;&s;ertions, drawn from the examples recorded in the word of God, "What, &s;ay they, did not <HI>Ahraham</HI> him&s;elf commit &s;in, prevaricating and denying his wife? Did not <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> commit &s;in, when he provoked God, <HI>at the waters of &s;trife?</HI> Nay, to produce one for all, did not even <HI>David the man after God's own heart,</HI> commit &s;in, in the matter of <HI>Uriah</HI> the <HI>Hittite,</HI> even murder and adultery?" It is mo&s;t &s;ure he did. All this is true. But what is it you would infer from hence? It may be granted, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that <HI>David,</HI> in the general cour&s;e of his life, was one of the holie&s;t men among the <HI>Jews.</HI> And, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> that the holie&s;t men among the <HI>Jews did &s;ometimes commit &s;in.</HI> But if you would hence infer, that <HI>all chri&s;tians do, and mu&s;t commit &s;in, as long as they live:</HI> This con&s;equence we utterly deny. It will never follow from tho&s;e premi&s;&s;es.</P>
<P N="8">8. Tho&s;e who argue thus, &s;eem never to have con&s;idered that declaration of our Lord (<HI>Matth.</HI> xi. 11.) "Verily I &s;ay unto you, among them that are born of women, there hath not ri&s;en a greater than <HI>John the Bapti&s;t.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding, he that is lea&s;t in the kingdom of heaven is
<PB N="174" REF="039068_0168_1013946CFA624A00">greater than he." I fear indeed there are &s;ome who have imagined <HI>the kingdom of heaven</HI> here, to mean the kingdom of glory: As if the Son of God had ju&s;t di&s;covered to us, that the lea&s;t glorified &s;aint in heaven is greater than any man upon earth! To mention this is &s;ufficiently to refute it. There can therefore no doubt be made but <HI>the kingdom of heaven</HI> here, (as in the follow|ing ver&s;e, where it is &s;aid to be <HI>taken by force</HI>) or, the <HI>kingdom of God, as</HI> St. <HI>Luke</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, is that kingdom of God on earth, whereunto all true believers in Chri&s;t, all real chri&s;tians belong. In the&s;e words then our Lord declares two things. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That before his coming in the fle&s;h among all the children of men, there had not been one greater than <HI>John the Bapti&s;t:</HI> Whence it evi|dently follows, that neither <HI>Abraham, David,</HI> nor any <HI>Jew</HI> was greater than <HI>John.</HI> Our Lord, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> declares, that he which is lea&s;t in the kingdom of God (in that kingdom which he came to &s;et up on earth, and which, <HI>the voilent</HI> now began <HI>to take by force</HI>) is greater than he. Not <HI>a greater prophet</HI> (as &s;ome have interpreted the word) for this is palpably fal&s;e in fact. But greater in the grace of God, and the knowledge of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Therefore we cannot mea&s;ure the privileges of real chri&s;tians, by tho&s;e formerly given to the <HI>Jews. Their mini&s;tration</HI> (or di&s;pen&s;ation) we allow <HI>was glorious;</HI> but ours <HI>exceed in glory.</HI> So that who&s;oever would bring down the <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> di&s;pen&s;ation to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> &s;tandard, who&s;oever gleans up the ex|amples of weakne&s;s, recorded in the law and the prophets, and thence infers, that they who have <HI>put on Chri&s;t,</HI> are indued with no greater
<PB N="175" REF="039068_0169_10139471DE9EBAD8">&s;trength, doth "greatly err, neither knowing the &s;criptures, not the power of God."</P>
<P N="9">9. <Q>But are there not a&s;&s;ertions in &s;cripture which prove the &s;ame thing, if it cannot be inferred from tho&s;e examples? Does not the &s;cripture &s;ay expre&s;sly, <HI>Even a ju&s;t man &s;in|neth &s;even times a day?</HI></Q> I an&s;wer, No. The &s;cripture &s;aith no &s;uch thing. There is no &s;uch text in all the bible. That which &s;eems to be in|tended is the &s;ixteenth ver&s;e of the twenty fourth chapter of <HI>the Proverbs:</HI> The words of which are the&s;e. "A ju&s;t man falleth &s;even times, and ri&s;eth up again," But this is quite another thing. For, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> the words, <HI>a day,</HI> are not in the text. So that if a ju&s;t man falls &s;even times in his life, it is as much as is affirmed here. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Here is no mention of <HI>falling into &s;in</HI> at all; what is here mentioned is, <HI>falling into temporal affliction.</HI> This plainly appears from the ver&s;e before, the words of which are the&s;e: "Lay not wait, O wicked man, again&s;t the dwelling of the righte|ous; &s;poil not his re&s;ting place." It follows, "For a ju&s;t man falleth &s;even times, and ri&s;eth up again: But the wicked &s;hall fall into mi&s;|chief." As if he had &s;aid, "God will deliver him out of his trouble. But when thou falle&s;t, there &s;hall be none to deliver thee."</P>
<P N="10">10. But however in other places, continue the objectors, <HI>Solomon</HI> does a&s;&s;ert plainly, "There is no man that &s;inneth not (1 Kings viii. 46. 2 Chron. vi. 36.) yea, there is not a ju&s;t man upon earth that doth good, and &s;inneth not" Eccle&s;. vii. 20.) I an&s;wer, without doubt, thus it was in the days of <HI>Solomon.</HI> Yea, thus it was, from <HI>Adam</HI> to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> from <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to <HI>Solomon,</HI> and from <HI>So|lomon</HI>
<PB N="176" REF="039068_0170_10139473660EDFC8">to Chri&s;t. There was <HI>then</HI> no man that &s;inned not. Even from the day that &s;in entered into the world, there was not a ju&s;t man upon earth that did good, and &s;inned not, <HI>until the</HI> Son of God was manife&s;ted <HI>to take away our &s;ins.</HI> It is unque&s;tionably true, that "the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a &s;ervant." And that <HI>even &s;o</HI> they (all the holy men of old, who were under the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> di&s;pen&s;ation) <HI>were</HI> during that infant &s;tate of the church, "in bon|dage under the elements of the world. But when the fulne&s;s of the time was come, God &s;ent forth his Son, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that they might receive the adoption of &s;ons; that they might receive that grace which is now made manife&s;t by the appear|ing of our Saviour, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who hath aboli&s;h|ed death, and brought life and immortality to light through the go&s;pel," (2. Tim. i. 10.) Now there|fore they <HI>are no more &s;ervants, but &s;ons.</HI> So that what&s;oever was the ca&s;e of tho&s;e under the law, we may &s;afely affirm with St. <HI>John,</HI> that &s;ince the go&s;pel was given, "He that is born of God, &s;in|neth not."</P>
<P N="11">11. It is of great importance to ob&s;erve, and that more carefully than is commonly done, the wide difference that is between the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> di&s;pen&s;ation: And that ground of it which the &s;ame apo&s;tle a&s;&s;igns in the &s;eventh chap|ter of his go&s;pel, ver&s;e 38, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> After he had there related tho&s;e words of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, "He that believeth on me, as the &s;cripture hath &s;aid, out of his belly &s;hall flow rivers of living water," <HI>he immediately &s;ubjoins,</HI> "This &s;pake he of the Spi|rit, <GAP DESC="foreign">, which
<PB N="177" REF="039068_0171_10139476C6F23A90">they who &s;hould believe on him, were afterwards to receive. For the Holy Gho&s;t was not yet given, becau&s;e that Je&s;us was not yet glorified." Now the apo&s;tle cannot mean here (as &s;ome have taught) that the miracle working power of the Holy Gho&s;t was not yet given. For this was given: our Lord had given it to all his apo&s;tles, when he fir&s;t &s;ent them forth to preach the go&s;pel. He then gave them <HI>Power over unclean &s;pirits to ca&s;t them out;</HI> Power <HI>to heal the &s;ick,</HI> yea, <HI>to rai&s;e the dead.</HI> But the Holy Gho&s;t was not yet given in his &s;anctifying graces, as he was after Je&s;us was glorified. "It was then when he a&s;cended up on high, and led captivity captive, that he received tho&s;e gifts for man, yea, even for the rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell among them. And when the day of penteco&s;t was fully come, then fir&s;t it was, that they who waited for the promi&s;e of the Father, were made more than conquerors over &s;in, by the Holy Gho&s;t given unto them.</P>
<P N="12">12. That this great &s;alvation from &s;in was not given till Je&s;us was glorified, St. <HI>Peter</HI> al&s;o plainly te&s;tifies; where &s;peaking of his <HI>brethren in the fle&s;h,</HI> as now <HI>receiving the end of their faith, the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls,</HI> he adds (1. <HI>Pet.</HI> i. 9.10, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) "Of which &s;alvation the prophets have en|quired and &s;earched diligently, who prophe&s;ied of the grace (i. e. the gracious di&s;pen&s;ation) that &s;hould come unto you: &s;earching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Chri&s;t which was in them did &s;ignify, when it te&s;tified before hand the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t and the glory (the glori|ous &s;alvation) that &s;hould follow. Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto them&s;elves, but
<PB N="178" REF="039068_0172_10139479DE0107C0">unto us they did mini&s;ter, the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preach|ed the go&s;pel unto you, with the Holy Gho&s;t &s;ent down from heaven (viz. at the day of pente|co&s;t, and &s;o unto all generations, into the hearts of all true believers.) On this ground even the <HI>grace which was brought unto them by the revelation of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> the apo&s;tle might well build that &s;trong exhortation, "Wherefore girding up the loins of your mind,&mdash;as he which hath called you is holy, &s;o be ye holy in all manner of conver&s;ation.</P>
<P N="13">13. Tho&s;e who have duly con&s;idered the&s;e things mu&s;t allow, that the privileges of chri&s;tians, are in no wi&s;e to be mea&s;ured by what the old te&s;tament records concerning tho&s;e who were under the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> di&s;pen&s;ation: &s;eeing the fulne&s;s of times is now come; the Holy Gho&s;t is now given: The great &s;alvation of God is brought unto men, by the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The kingdom of heaven is now &s;et up on earth; concerning which the Spirit of God declared of old (&s;o far is <HI>David</HI> from being the pattern or &s;tandard of chri&s;tian perfection) "He that is feeble among them at that day, &s;hall be as <HI>David:</HI> And the hou&s;e of <HI>David</HI> &s;hall be as God, as the angel of the Lord before them." (Zech. xii. 8.)</P>
<P N="14">14. If therefore you would prove that the apo&s;tle's words, <HI>he that is born of God &s;inneth not,</HI> are not be under&s;tood, according to there plain, natural, obvious meaning, it is from the new te&s;tament you are to bring your proofs: el&s;e you will fight as one that beateth the air. And the fir&s;t of the&s;e which is u&s;ually brought, is taken from the examples recorded in the new te&s;tament. "The apo&s;tles them&s;elves (it is &s;aid) committed
<PB N="179" REF="039068_0173_1013947E657687C8">&s;in: Nay the greate&s;t of them, <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul:</HI> St. <HI>Paul,</HI> by his &s;harp contention with <HI>Barnabas,</HI> and St. <HI>Peter,</HI> by his di&s;&s;imulation at <HI>Antioch.</HI>" Well; &s;uppo&s;e both <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> did then commit &s;in: What is it you would infer from hence? That <HI>all the other apo&s;tles</HI> committed &s;in &s;ometimes? There is no &s;hadow of proof of this. Or, would you thence infer, that <HI>all the other chri&s;tians</HI> of the apo&s;tolic age committed &s;in? Wor&s;e and wor&s;e; this is &s;uch an inference as one would imagine a man in his &s;en&s;es could never have thought of. Or, will you argue thus; "If two of the apo&s;tles did once commit &s;in, then <HI>all other chri&s;tians, in all ages,</HI> do, and will commit &s;in as long as they live." Alas, my brother! a child of common under&s;tanding, would be a|&s;hamed of &s;uch rea&s;oning as this. Lea&s;t of all can you with any colour of argument infer, "That any man <HI>mu&s;t</HI> commit &s;in at all." No; God forbid we &s;hould thus &s;peak. No nece&s;&s;ity of &s;inning was laid upon them. The grace of God was &s;urely &s;ufficient for them. And it <HI>is</HI> &s;ufficient for us at this day. With the tempt|ation which fell on <HI>them,</HI> there <HI>was</HI> a way to e&s;cape; as there <HI>is</HI> to every &s;oul of man in every temptation. So that who&s;oever is tempted to any &s;in, <HI>need</HI> not yield; for no man is tempted above that he is able to bear.</P>
<P N="15">15. "But St. <HI>Paul</HI> be&s;ought the Lord thrice, and yet he could not e&s;cape from his temptation." Let us con&s;ider his own words literally tran&s;|lated. "There was given to me, a thorn to the fle&s;h, an angel, or me&s;&s;enger of &s;atan, to bu&s;|&s;et me. Touching this I be&s;ought the Lord thrice, that it or he might depart from me. And he &s;aid un|to me, my grace is &s;ufficient for thee. For my &s;trength
<PB N="180" REF="039068_0174_1013947FECF3F710">is made perfect in weakne&s;s. Mo&s;t gladly there|fore will I rather glory in the&s;e my weakne&s;&s;es, that the &s;trength of Chri&s;t may re&s;t upon me. Therefore I take plea&s;ure in weakne&s;&s;es,&mdash;for when I am weak, then am I &s;trong."</P>
<P N="16">16. As this &s;cripture is one of the &s;trong holds of the patrons of &s;in, it may be proper to weigh it thoroughly. Let it be ob&s;erved then, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> It does by no means appear, That this thorn, what|&s;oever it was, occa&s;ioned St. <HI>Paul</HI> to commit &s;in: Much le&s;s laid him under any nece&s;&s;ity of doing &s;o. Therefore, from hence it can never be pro|ved that any chri&s;tian <HI>mu&s;t</HI> commit &s;in. <HI>Second|ly,</HI> The ancient fathers inform us, it was bodi|ly pain: A violent head-ach, &s;aith <HI>Tertullian,</HI> (de pudic) to which both <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> and St. <HI>Je|rome</HI> agree.

This is manife&s;t beyond all po&s;&s;ible exception, from the words that immediately follow, "Mo&s;t gladly will I glory in the&s;e my weakne&s;&s;es, that the &s;trength of Chri&s;t may re&s;t upon me.

Even by your&s;elves then judge, whether the apo&s;tle could glory, and take plea|&s;ure in them? Let it be, <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> ob&s;erved, that this thorn was given to St. <HI>Paul above fourteen years</HI> before he wrote this epi&s;tle: Which it&s;elf was wrote &s;everal years before he fini&s;hed his cour&s;e. So that he had after this a long cour&s;e to run, many battles to fight, many victories to gain, and great increa&s;e to receive in all the gifts of God, and the knowledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Therefore from any &s;piritual weakne&s;s (if &s;uch had been) which he <HI>at that time</HI> felt, we could by no means infer, that he was never made &s;trong, that <HI>Paul,</HI> the aged, the father in Chri&s;t, &s;till laboured under the &s;ame weakne&s;&s;es: That he was in no higher &s;tate till the day of his death. From all which it appears, that this in|&s;tance of St. <HI>Paul</HI> is quite foreign to the que&s;tion, and does in no wi&s;e cla&s;h with the affection of St. <HI>John, He that is born of God &s;inneth not.</HI></P>
<P N="17">17. "But does not St. <HI>James,</HI> directly contra|dict this? His words are, <HI>In many things we of|fend all,</HI> chap. iii. ver, 2. And is not <HI>offending</HI>

That in the word <HI>we</HI> (u&s;ed by a figure of &s;peach, common in all other, as well as the in&s;pired writings) the apo&s;tle could not po&s;&s;ibly include him&s;elf, or any other true believer, appears evidently, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> from the &s;ame word, in the ninth ver&s;e; <HI>Therewith</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>ble&s;s</HI> we <HI>God, and therewith cur&s;e</HI> we <HI>men.

But this could not be &s;poken of the apo&s;tle him|&s;elf, or of any who trod in his &s;teps; &s;eeing <HI>there is no condemnation for them, who walk not after the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, but after the &s;pirit.</HI> Nay, <HI>thirdly,</HI> the very ver&s;e it&s;elf proves, that <HI>we offend all,</HI> can|not be &s;poken, either of all men, or of all chri&s;|tians; for in it there immediately follows the mention of a man who <HI>offends not,</HI> as the <HI>we</HI>
<PB N="183" REF="039068_0177_10139487D9C2DD28">fir&s;t mentioned did: from whom therefore he is profe&s;&s;edly contradi&s;tingui&s;hed, and pronounced, <HI>a perfect man.</HI></P>
<P N="18">18. So clearly does St. <HI>James,</HI> explain him&s;elf, and fix the meaning of his own words. Yet le&s;t any one &s;hould &s;till remain in doubt, St. <HI>John,</HI> writing many years after St. <HI>James,</HI> puts the matter intirely out of di&s;pute, by the expre&s;s declarations above recited. But here a fre&s;h difficulty may ari&s;e. How &s;hall we reconcile St. <HI>John</HI> with him&s;elf? In one place he declares, "Who&s;oever is born of God, doth not commit &s;in." And again, "We know that he which is born of God, &s;inneth not." And yet in another he &s;aith, "If we &s;ay that we have no &s;in, we deceive our&s;elves, and the truth is not in us." And again, "If we &s;ay that we have not &s;inned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us."</P>
<P N="19">19. As great a difficulty as this may at fir&s;t appear, it vani&s;hes away if we ob&s;erve, fir&s;t, That the tenth ver&s;e fixes the &s;en&s;e of the eighth: <HI>If we &s;ay we have to &s;in,</HI> in the former, being explained by, <HI>If we &s;ay we have not &s;inned,</HI> in the latter ver&s;e. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That the point under pre|&s;ent con&s;ideration is not whether we <HI>have or have not &s;inned heretofore;</HI> and neither of the&s;e ver&s;es a&s;&s;ert, that we <HI>do &s;in, or commit &s;in</HI> now. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> That the ninth ver&s;e explains both the eighth and tenth; "If we confe&s;s our &s;ins, he is faith|ful and ju&s;t to forgive us our &s;ins, and to clean&s;e us from all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s: as if he had &s;aid, I have before affirmed, the <HI>blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t clean&s;eth us from all &s;in.</HI> But let no man &s;ay, I need it not: I have no &s;in to be clean&s;ed from. If we &s;ay <HI>that we have no &s;in, that we have not
<PB N="184" REF="039068_0178_1013948A5B230198">&s;inned,</HI> we deceive our&s;elves and make God a liar. But if we confe&s;s our fins, he is faithful and ju&s;t, not only to forgive our &s;ins, but al&s;o to clean&s;e us from all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, that we may go and fin no more."</P>
<P N="20">20. St. <HI>John</HI> therefore is well con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, as well as with the other holy writers: As will yet more evidently appear, if we place all his a&s;&s;ertions touching this matter in one view. He declares, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t clean&s;eth us from all &s;in. <HI>Secondly,</HI> No man can &s;ay, I have not &s;inned. I have no &s;in to be clean&s;ed from. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> but God is ready both to forgive our pa&s;t &s;ins, and to &s;ave us from them for the time to come. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> "The&s;e things I write unto you," &s;aith the apo&s;tle, "that you may not &s;in: but if any man &s;hould &s;in," or <HI>have &s;inned</HI> (as the word might be rendered) he need not continue in &s;in, &s;eeing "we have an advo|cate with the Father, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the righteous." Thus far all is clear. But le&s;t any doubt &s;hould re|main, in a point of &s;o va&s;t importance, the apo&s;tle re&s;umes this &s;ubject in the third chapter, and large|ly explains his own meaning. <HI>Little children,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>let no man deceive you</HI> (as though I had given any encouragement to tho&s;e that continue in &s;in.) "He that doth righteou&s;ne&s;s, is righteous even as he is righteous. He that committeth &s;in is of the devil: for the devil &s;inneth from the beginning. For this purpo&s;e the &s;on of God was manife&s;ted, that he might de&s;troy the works of the devil. Who|&s;oever is born of God doth not commit &s;in: for his &s;eed remaineth in him, and he cannot &s;in, becau&s;e he is born of God. In this the children of God are manife&s;t, and the children of the devil."
<PB N="185" REF="039068_0179_1013948D2054FA40">(ver&s;es 7,&mdash;10.) Here the point, which till then might po&s;&s;ibly have admitted of &s;ome doubt in weak minds, is purpo&s;ely &s;ettled by the la&s;t of the in&s;pired writers, and decided in the cleare&s;t manner. In conformity therefore both to the doctrine of St. <HI>John,</HI> and to the whole tenor of the new te&s;tament, we fix this conclu&s;ion, "A chri&s;tian is &s;o far perfect, as not to commit &s;in."</P>
<P N="21">21. This is the glorious privilege of every chri&s;tian, yea, though he be but <HI>a babe in Chri&s;t.</HI> But it is only of tho&s;e who <HI>are &s;trong</HI> in the Lord, <HI>and have overcome the wicked one,</HI> or rather of tho&s;e who <HI>have known him that is from the be|ginning,</HI> that it can be affirmed they are in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e perfect; as, <HI>Secondly,</HI> to be freed from evil thoughts, and evil tempers. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> from evil or &s;inful thoughts. But here let it be ob&s;erved, that thoughts concerning evil, are not always evil thoughts: that a thought concerning &s;in, and a &s;inful thought, are widely different. A man, for in&s;tance, may think of a murder which ano|ther has committed, and yet this is no evil or &s;inful thought. So our ble&s;&s;ed Lord him&s;elf, doubt|le&s;s thought of, or under&s;tood the thing &s;poken by the devil, when he &s;aid, "All this will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and wor&s;hip me." Yet had he no evil or &s;inful thought, nor indeed was capable of having any. And even hence it follows, that neither have real chri&s;tians. For "every one that is perfect is as his ma&s;ter," (Luke vi. 40.) Therefore, if he was free from evil or &s;inful thoughts, &s;o are they likewi&s;e.</P>
<P N="22">22. And indeed, whence &s;hould evil thoughts proceed, in the &s;ervant who is <Q>as his ma&s;ter? Out of the heart of man (if at all) proceed evil
<PB N="186" REF="039068_0180_101394914ADB8698">thoughts,</Q> (Mark vii. 21.) If therefore his heart be no longer evil, then evil thoughts can no longer proceed out of it. If the tree were cor|rupt, &s;o would be the fruit; but the tree is good. The fruit therefore is good al&s;o, (Matth. xii. 38.) Our Lord him&s;elf bearing witne&s;s, "Every good tree bringeth forth good fruit. A good tree can|not bring forth evil fruit, as a corrupt tree can|not bring forth good fruit," Matt. vii. 17, 18.</P>
<P N="23">23. The &s;ame happy privilege of real chri&s;ti|ans, St. <HI>Paul</HI> a&s;&s;erts from his own experience. "The weapons of our warfare," &s;aith he, "are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of &s;trong holds: Ca&s;ting down imaginati|ons," (or rea&s;onings rather, for &s;o the word <GAP DESC="foreign">&s;ignifies; all the rea&s;onings of pride and unbelief again&s;t the declarations, promi&s;es or gifts of God) "and every high thing that exalteth it&s;elf again&s;t the knowledge of God; and bringing into capti|vity every thought to the obedience of Chri&s;t," 2 Cor. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 5, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="24">24. And as chri&s;tians indeed, are freed from evil thoughts, &s;o are they, <HI>Secondly,</HI> from evil tempers. This is evident from the above men|tioned declaration of our Lord him&s;elf: "The di&s;|ciple is not above his ma&s;ter; but every one that is perfect &s;hall be as his ma&s;ter." He had been delivering ju&s;t before &s;ome of the &s;ublime&s;t doc|trines of Chri&s;tianity, and &s;ome of the mo&s;t grie|vous to fle&s;h and blood. "I &s;ay unto you, love your enemies, do good to them which hate you: and unto him that &s;miteth thee on the one cheek, offer al&s;o the other." Now the&s;e he well knew the world would not receive; and therefore im|mediately adds, "Can the blind lead the blind?
<PB N="187" REF="039068_0181_10139492D2CC60C0">Will they not both fall into the ditch?" As if he had &s;aid, "Do not confer with fle&s;h and blood touching the&s;e things, with men void of &s;piritual di&s;cernment, the eyes of who&s;e under&s;tanding God hath not opened, le&s;t they and you peri&s;h together." In the next ver&s;e he removes the two grand objections, with which the&s;e wi&s;e fools meet us at every turn, "The&s;e things are too grievous to be borne," or, "They are too high to be attained:" Saying, "The di&s;ciple is not a|bove his ma&s;ter:" therefore, if I have &s;uffered, be content to tread in my &s;teps. And doubt ye not then, but I will fulfil my word: "For every one that is perfect, &s;hall be as his ma&s;ter." But his ma&s;ter was free from all finful tempers. So there|fore is his di&s;ciple, even every real chri&s;tian.</P>
<P N="25">25. Every one of the&s;e can &s;ay with St. <HI>Paul,</HI> "I am crucified with Chri&s;t. Neverthele&s;s I live; Yet not I, but Chri&s;t liveth in me:" Words that manife&s;tly de&s;cribe a deliverance from inward, as well as from outward &s;in. This is expre&s;&s;ed both negatively, <HI>I live not:</HI> my evil nature, the body of &s;in is de&s;troyed: and po&s;itively, <HI>Chri&s;t liveth in me,</HI> and therefore all that is holy, and ju&s;t, and good. Indeed both the&s;e, <HI>Chri&s;t liveth in me,</HI> and <HI>I live not,</HI> are in&s;eparably connected. For "What communion hath light with darkne&s;s, or Chri&s;t with belial?"</P>
<P N="26">26. He therefore who liveth in true believers, hath "purified their hearts by faith:" In&s;omuch that "every one that hath Chri&s;t in him, the hope of glory, purifieth him&s;elf even as he is pure (1 John iii. 3.) He is purified from pride; for Chri&s;t was lowly of heart. He is pure from &s;elf-will, or
<PB N="188" REF="039068_0182_1013949565C7FF40">de&s;ire; for Chri&s;t de&s;ired only to do the will of his Father, and to fini&s;h his work. And he is pure from anger, in the common &s;en&s;e of the word; for Chri&s;t was meek and gentle, patient and long-&s;uffering. I &s;ay, in the common &s;en&s;e of the word; for all anger is not evil. We read of our Lord him&s;elf (Mark iii. 5.) that he once <HI>looked round with anger.</HI> But with what kind of anger? The next word &s;hews; <GAP DESC="foreign">, being <HI>at the &s;ame time grieved for the hardne&s;s of their hearts.</HI> So then he was <HI>angry at the &s;in,</HI> and in the &s;ame moment <HI>grieved for the &s;inners.</HI> Angry or di&s;|plea&s;ed <HI>at the offence;</HI> but &s;orry <HI>for the offenders.</HI> With anger, yea, hatred, he looked upon <HI>the thing;</HI> with grief and love upon the <HI>per&s;ons.</HI> Go thou that art perfect, and do likewi&s;e. <HI>Be thus angry, and</HI> thou <HI>&s;inne&s;t not:</HI> Feeling a di&s;placency at every offence again&s;t God; but only love and tender compa&s;&s;ion to the offender.</P>
<P N="27">27. Thus doth Je&s;us <HI>&s;ave his people from their &s;ins:</HI> And not only from outward &s;ins, but al&s;o from the &s;ins of their hearts; from evil thoughts and from evil tempers. <Q>True, &s;ay &s;ome; we &s;hall thus be &s;aved from our &s;ins; but not till death, not in this world.</Q> But how are we to re|concile this with the expre&s;s words of St. <HI>John?</HI> "Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldne&s;s in the day of judgment, becau&s;e as he is, &s;o are we in this world." The apo&s;tle here beyond all contradiction &s;peaks of him&s;elf and other living chri&s;tians, of whom (as though he had fore&s;een this very eva&s;ion, and &s;et him&s;elf to overturn it from the foundation) he flatly affirms, that not only at, or after death, but <HI>in this world,</HI> they are as their ma&s;ter, 1 John iv. 17.</P>
<P N="28"><PB N="189" REF="039068_0183_1013949718440D28">
28. Exactly agreeable to this are his words in the fir&s;t chapter of this epi&s;tle (ver&s;e 6, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) "God is light, and in him is no darkne&s;s at all. If we walk in the light, we have fellow&s;hip one with another, and the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t his Son clean&s;eth us from all &s;in." And again, "If we con|fe&s;s our &s;ins, he is faithful and ju&s;t to forgive us our &s;ins, and to clean&s;e us from all unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s." Now it is evident, the apo&s;tle here al&s;o &s;peaks of a deliverance wrought <HI>in this world.</HI> For he &s;aith not, "the blood of Chri&s;t will clean&s;e," (at the hour of death, or in the day of judgment) but it <HI>clean&s;eth</HI> (at the time pre&s;ent) <HI>us</HI> (living chri&s;tians) <HI>from all &s;in.</HI> And it is equally evident, that if <HI>any &s;in</HI> remain, we are not clean&s;ed from <HI>all &s;in:</HI> if <HI>any</HI> unrighteou&s;ne&s;s remain in the &s;oul, it is not clean&s;ed from <HI>all</HI> unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. Nei|ther let any &s;inner again&s;t his own foul &s;ay, that this relates to ju&s;tification only, or the clean&s;ing us from the guilt of &s;in; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e this is confounding together what the apo&s;tle clearly di&s;|tingui&s;hes; who mentions fir&s;t, <HI>to forgive us our &s;ins,</HI> and then "to clean&s;e us from all unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s." <HI>Secondly,</HI> Becau&s;e this is a&s;&s;erting ju&s;tifica|tion by works in the &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;e po&s;&s;ible: it is making all inward, as well as outward holi|ne&s;s, nece&s;&s;arily previous to ju&s;tification. For if the clean&s;ing here &s;poken of is no other than the clean&s;ing us from the guilt of &s;in, then we are not clean&s;ed from guilt; <HI>i. e.</HI> are not ju&s;tified, unle&s;s on condition of "walking in the light, as he is in the light." It remains then, that chri&s;tians are &s;aved in this world from all &s;in; from all un|righteou&s;ne&s;s: that they are now in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e
<PB N="190" REF="039068_0184_1013949AFA4A9B80">perfect, as not to commit &s;in, and to be freed from evil thoughts and evil tempers.</P>
<P N="29">29. Thus hath the Lord fulfilled the things he &s;pake by his holy prophets, which have been &s;ince the world began: by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in particular, &s;aying (Deut. xxx. 6.) "I will circumci&s;e thine heart, and the heart of thy &s;eed, to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul;" by David crying out, "Create in me a clean heart, and renew a right &s;pirit within me:" And mo&s;t re|markably by Ezekiel, in tho&s;e words, "Then will I &s;prinkle clean water upon you, and ye &s;hall be clean; from all your filthine&s;s, and from all your idols will I clean&s;e you. A new heart al&s;o will I give you, and a new &s;pirit will I put within you, and cau&s;e you to walk in my &s;tatutes, and he &s;hall keep my judgments and do them.&mdash;Ye &s;hall be my people, and I will be your God.

<P>Bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chri&s;t.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. BUT will God &s;o <HI>bring every thought into captivity to the obedience of Chri&s;t,</HI> that no <HI>wandering thought</HI> will find a place in the mind, even while we remain in the body? &s;o &s;ome have vehemently maintained: Yea, have affirmed, that none are <HI>perfected in love,</HI> unle&s;s they are &s;o far perfected in under&s;tanding, that all <HI>wandering thoughts</HI> are done away: unle&s;s not only every affection and temper, be holy, and ju&s;t, and good, but every individual thought which ari&s;es in the mind, be wi&s;e and regular.</P>
<P N="2">2. This is a que&s;tion of no &s;mall importance. For how many of tho&s;e who fear God, yea and love him, perhaps with all their heart, have been greatly di&s;tre&s;t on this account? How many, by not under&s;tanding it right, have not only been di&s;tre&s;t, but greatly hurt in their &s;ouls? ca&s;t into unprofitable, yea, mi&s;chievous rea&s;onings, &s;uch as &s;lackened their motion towards God, and weakened them in running the race &s;et before them. Nay many, thro' mi&s;apprehen&s;ions of this very thing, have ca&s;t away the precious gift of
<PB N="198" REF="039068_0192_101394B1EA2AFBA0">God. They have been induced fir&s;t to doubt of, and then to deny the work God had wrought in their fouls; and hereby have grieved the Spirit of God, 'till he withdrew and left them in utter darkne&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. How is it then, that amid&s;t the abundance of books which have been lately publi&s;hed almo&s;t on all &s;ubjects, we &s;hould have none upon <HI>wan|dering Thoughts?</HI> At lea&s;t none that will at all &s;atisfy a calm and &s;erious mind? in order to do this in &s;ome degree, I purpo&s;e to enquire,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. What are the &s;everal &s;orts of wandering thoughts?</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. What are the general occa&s;ions of them?</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Which of them are &s;inful, and which not?</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. Which of them we may expect and pray to be delivered from?</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. 1. I purpo&s;e to enquire, fir&s;t, what are the &s;everal &s;orts of wandering thoughts? The parti|cular &s;orts are innumerable; but in general, they are of two &s;orts, thoughts that wander from God, and thoughts that wander from the parti|cular point we have in hand.</P>
<P N="2">2. With regard to the former, all our thoughts are naturally of this kind. For they are continu|ally wandering from God: we think nothing about him. God is not in all our thoughts: we are, one and all, as the apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, <HI>without God in the world.</HI> We think of what we love: but we do not love God: Therefore we think not of him. Or if we are now and then con&s;trained to think of him for a time, yet as we have no plea&s;ure therein, nay rather, as the&s;e
<PB N="199" REF="039068_0193_101394B499375280">thoughts are not only in&s;ipid, but di&s;ta&s;teful and irk&s;ome to us, we drive them out as &s;oon as we can, and return to what we love to think of. So that the world and the things of the world, what we &s;hall eat, what we &s;hall drink, what we &s;hall put on: what we &s;hall &s;ee, what we &s;hall hear, what we &s;hall gain: how we &s;hall plea&s;e our &s;en&s;es or our imagination, takes up all our time, and en|gro&s;&s;es all our thoughts. So long therefore as we love the world, that is, &s;o long as we are in our natural &s;tate, all our thoughts, from morning to evening, and from evening to morning, are no other than wandering thoughts.</P>
<P N="3">3. But many times we are not only <HI>without God in the world,</HI> but al&s;o fighting <HI>again&s;t him:</HI> As there is in every man by nature a <HI>carnal mind which is enmity again&s;t God;</HI> no wonder therefore that men abound with unbelieving thoughts: Either &s;aying in their hearts there is no God, or que&s;tioning, if not denying his power or wi&s;|dom, his mercy, or ju&s;tice, or holine&s;s. No wonder, that they &s;o often doubt of his provi|dence, at lea&s;t, of its extending to all events: Or that even though they allow it, they &s;till entertain <HI>murmuring</HI> or <HI>repining</HI> thoughts. Nearly related to the&s;e and frequently connected with them, are <HI>proud</HI> and <HI>vain</HI> imaginations. Again: &s;ometimes they are taken up with <HI>angry, malicious</HI> or <HI>revenge|ful</HI> thoughts: At other times, with airy &s;cenes of plea&s;ure, whether of &s;en&s;e or imagination: whereby the earthy &s;en&s;ual mind, becomes more <HI>earthy</HI> and <HI>&s;en&s;ual</HI> &s;till. Now by all the&s;e they make flat war with God; the&s;e are <HI>wandering thoughts</HI> of the highe&s;t kind.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="200" REF="039068_0194_10139553D5237BD8">
4. Widely different from the&s;e are the other &s;ort of <HI>wandering thoughts:</HI> In which the heart does not wander from God, but the under&s;tanding wanders from the particular point it had then in view. For in&s;tance: I &s;it down to con&s;ider tho&s;e words in the ver&s;e preceding the text, "The wea|pons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God." I think, "this ought to be the ca&s;e with all that are called chri&s;tians." But how far is it otherwi&s;e? Look round into almo&s;t every part of what is termed the chri&s;tian world! what manner of weapons are the&s;e u&s;ing? In what kind of warfare are they engaged,
<Q><L>"While men, like fiends, each other tear</L>
<L>In all the helli&s;h rage of war?"</L></Q>
See how <HI>the&s;e chri&s;tians</HI> love one another! Where|in are they preferable to Turks and Pagans? What abomination can be found among Maho|metans or Heathens, which is not found among chri&s;tians al&s;o?" And thus my mind runs off, before I am aware, from one circum&s;tance to a|nother. Now all the&s;e are in &s;ome &s;en&s;e <HI>wander|ing thoughts.</HI> For although they do not wander from God, much le&s;s fight again&s;t him, yet they do wander from the particular point I had in view.</P>
<P N="2">II. Such is the nature, &s;uch are the &s;orts (to &s;peak rather u&s;efully, than philo&s;ophically) of wandering thoughts. But what are the general occa&s;ions of them? This we are, in the &s;econd place to con&s;ider.</P>
<P N="1">1. And it is ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that the occa&s;ion of the former &s;ort of thoughts which oppo&s;e or
<PB N="201" REF="039068_0195_101394B6218ECE18">wander from God, are in general, &s;inful tem|pers. For in&s;tance. Why <HI>is not God in all the thoughts,</HI> in any of the thoughts of a natural man? For a plain rea&s;on: be he rich or poor, learned or unlearned, he is an athei&s;t; (though not vulgarly &s;o called) he neither knows nor loves God. Why are his thoughts continually wan|dering after the world? Becau&s;e he is an idola|ter. He does not indeed wor&s;hip an image, or bow down to the &s;tock of a tree: yet he is &s;unk into equally damnable idolatry: he loves, that is, wor&s;hips the world. He &s;eeks happine&s;s in things that are &s;een, in the plea&s;ures that peri&s;h in the u&s;ing. Why is it that his thoughts are perpetually wandering from the very end of his being, the knowledge of God in <HI>Chri&s;t?</HI> Be|cau&s;e he is an unbeliever; becau&s;e he has no faith, or at lea&s;t, no more than a devil. So all the&s;e wandering thoughts ea&s;ily and naturally &s;pring from that evil root of unbelief.</P>
<P N="2">2. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame in other in&s;tances: pride, anger, revenge, vanity, lu&s;t, covetou&s;ne&s;s, every one of them occa&s;ion thoughts &s;uitable to their own nature. And &s;o does every &s;inful temper, of which the human mind is capable. The particulars it is hardly po&s;&s;ible, nor is it needful to enumerate. It &s;uffices to ob&s;erve, that as many evil tempers as find a place in any &s;oul, &s;o many ways that &s;oul will depart from God, by the wor&s;t kind of wandering thoughts.</P>
<P N="3">3. The occa&s;ions of the latter kind of wan|dering thoughts, are exceeding various. Multi|tudes of them are occa&s;ioned, by the <HI>natural union</HI> between the &s;oul and body. How immediate|ly
<PB N="202" REF="039068_0196_101394B900354C88">and how deeply is the under&s;tanding affected by a di&s;ea&s;ed body! Let but the blood move irre|gularly in the brain, and all regular thinking is at an end. <HI>Raging madne&s;s</HI> en&s;ues, and then fare|well to all evenne&s;s of thought. Yea, let only the &s;pirits be hurried or agitated to a certain de|gree, and a temporary madne&s;s, a <HI>delirium</HI> pre|vents all &s;ettled thought. And is not the &s;ame irregularity of thought in a mea&s;ure occa&s;ioned by every <HI>nervous di&s;order?</HI> So does "the corrupt|ible body pre&s;s down the &s;oul, and cau&s;e it to mu&s;e about many things."</P>
<P N="4">4. But does it only cau&s;e this in the time of &s;ickne&s;s, of preternatural di&s;order? Nay, but more or le&s;s, at all times, even in a &s;tate of per|fect health. Let a man be ever &s;o healthy, he will be more or le&s;s delirious, every four-and-twenty hours. For does he not <HI>&s;leep?</HI> And while he &s;leeps, is he not liable to <HI>dream?</HI> And who then is ma&s;ter of his own thoughts, or able to pre&s;erve the order and con&s;i&s;tency of them? Who can then keep them fixt to any one point, or prevent their wandering from pole to pole?</P>
<P N="5">5. But &s;uppo&s;e we are awake, are we always &s;o awake, that we can &s;teadily govern our thoughts? Are we not unavoidably expo&s;ed to contrary ex|tremes, by the very nature of this machine, the body? Sometimes we are too heavy, too dull and languid, to pur&s;ue any chain of thought. Some|times, on the other hand, we are too lively. The imagination, without leave, &s;tarts to and fro, and carries us away, hither and thither, whether we will or no: and all this, from the merely natural motion of the &s;pirits, or vibration of the nerves.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="203" REF="039068_0197_101394BBD0941460">
6. Farther. How many wanderings of thought may ari&s;e, from tho&s;e various <HI>a&s;&s;ociations</HI> of our ideas, which are made entirely without our knowledge, and independently on our choice? How the&s;e connexions are formed we cannot tell: But they are formed in a thou&s;and different man|ners. Nor is it in the power of the wi&s;e&s;t or holie&s;t of men, to break tho&s;e a&s;&s;ociations, or to pre|vent what is the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of them, and matter of daily ob&s;ervation. Let the fire but touch one end of the train, and it immediately runs on to the other.</P>
<P N="7">7. Once more. Let us fix our attention as &s;tu|diou&s;ly as we are able on any &s;ubject, yet let either <HI>plea&s;ure or pain</HI> ari&s;e, e&s;pecially if it be inten&s;e, and it will demand our immediate attention, and attach our thought to it&s;elf. It will interrupt the &s;teadie&s;t contemplation, and divert the mind from its favourite &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="8">8. The&s;e occa&s;ions of wandering thoughts lie within, are wrought into our very nature. But they will likewi&s;e naturally and nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e, from the various impul&s;e of <HI>outward objects.</HI> Whatever &s;trikes upon the organ of &s;en&s;e, the eye or ear, will rai&s;e a perception in the mind. And accordingly, whatever we &s;ee or hear, will break in upon our former train of thought. Every man therefore that does any thing in our fight, or &s;peaks any thing in our hearing, occa|&s;ions our mind to wander more or le&s;s from the point it was thinking of before.</P>
<P N="9">9. And there is no que&s;tion but tho&s;e <HI>evil &s;pi|rits,</HI> who are continually <HI>&s;eeking whom they may de|vour,</HI> make u&s;e of all the foregoing occa&s;ions, to hurry and di&s;tract our minds. Sometimes by one,
<PB N="204" REF="039068_0198_101394BFB37EADA0">&s;ometimes by another of the&s;e means, they will harra&s;s and perplex us, and &s;o far as God permits, interrupt our thoughts, particularly when they are engaged on the be&s;t &s;ubjects. Nor is this at all &s;trange: they well under&s;tand the very &s;prings of thought, and know on which of the bodily organs, the imagination, the under&s;tanding, and every other faculty of the mind more immediately depends. And hereby they know, how by af|fecting tho&s;e organs, to affect the operations dependent on them. Add to this, that they can inject a thou&s;and thoughts, without any of the preceding means: it being as natural for &s;pirit to act upon &s;pirit, as for matter to act upon matter. The&s;e things being con&s;idered, we can|not wonder, that our thoughts &s;o often wander from any point which we have in view.</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. What kind of wandering thoughts are &s;inful, and what not, is the third thing to be enquired into. And fir&s;t, all tho&s;e thoughts which wander from God, which leave him no room in our minds, are undoubtedly &s;inful. For all the&s;e imply practical athei&s;m, and by the&s;e we are without God in the world. And &s;o much more are all tho&s;e which are contrary to God, which imply oppo&s;ition or enmity to him. Such are all murmuring di&s;contented thoughts, which &s;ay in effect, we will not have thee to rule over us: all unbelieving thoughts, whether with regard to his being, his attributes, or his pro|vidence. I mean his <HI>particular providence</HI> over all things as well as all per&s;ons in the univer&s;e: That <HI>without</HI> which <HI>not a &s;parrow falls to the ground,</HI> by which <HI>the hairs of our head are all numbered.</HI>
<PB N="205" REF="039068_0199_101394C140084918">For as to a <HI>general Providence</HI> (vulgarly &s;o called) co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ra di&s;tingui&s;hed from a particular, it is only a decent, well-&s;ounding word, which means ju&s;t nothing.</P>
<P N="2">2. Again. All thoughts which &s;pring from &s;inful tempers, are undoubtedly &s;inful. Such, for in&s;tance, are tho&s;e that &s;pring from a re|vengeful temper, from pride, or lu&s;t, or vanity. "An evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit." Therefore if the tree be evil, &s;o mu&s;t the fruit be al&s;o.</P>
<P N="3">3. And &s;o mu&s;t tho&s;e be, which either produce or &s;eed any &s;inful temper: Tho&s;e which either give ri&s;e to pride or vanity, to anger or love of the world, or confirm and increa&s;e the&s;e or any other unholy temper, pa&s;&s;ion, or affection. For not only whatever flows from evil is evil, but al&s;o whatever leads to it; whatever tends to ali|enate the &s;oul from God, and to make or keep it <HI>earthly, &s;en&s;ual,</HI> and <HI>devili&s;h.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Hence even tho&s;e thoughts which are occa|&s;ioned by weakne&s;s or di&s;ea&s;e, by the natural mechani&s;m of the body, or by the laws of vital union, however innocent they may be in them|&s;elves, do neverthele&s;s become &s;inful, when they either produce or cheri&s;h and increa&s;e in us any &s;inful temper: &s;uppo&s;e the de&s;ire of the fle&s;h, the de&s;ire of the eye, or the pride of life. In like manner the wandering thoughts which are occa|&s;ioned, by the words or actions of other men, if they cau&s;e or feed any wrong di&s;po&s;ition, then commence &s;inful. And the &s;ame we may ob|&s;erve of tho&s;e which are &s;ugge&s;ted or injected by the devil. When they mini&s;ter to any earthly or devili&s;h temper (which they do, whenever we
<PB N="206" REF="039068_0200_101394C40EF0D440">give place to them, and thereby make them our own) then they are equally &s;inful, with the tem|pers, to which they mini&s;ter.</P>
<P N="5">5. But ab&s;tracting from the&s;e ca&s;es, wandering thoughts, in the latter &s;en&s;e of the word, that is, thoughts wherein our under&s;tanding wanders, from the point it has in view, are no more &s;inful than the motion of blood in our veins, or of the &s;pirits in our brain, if they ari&s;e from an infirm con&s;titution, or from &s;ome accidental weakne&s;s or di&s;temper, they are as innocent as it is to have a weak con&s;titution, or a di&s;tempered body. And &s;urely no one doubts but a bad &s;tate of nerves, a fever of any kind, and either a tran&s;ient or a la&s;ting delirium, may con&s;i&s;t with perfect inno|cence. And if they &s;hould ari&s;e in a &s;oul which is united to an healthful body, either from the natural union between the body and the &s;oul, or from any of ten thou&s;and changes, which may occur in tho&s;e organs of the body, that mini&s;ter to thought; In any of the&s;e ca&s;es they are as perfectly innocent as the cau&s;es from which they &s;pring. And &s;o they are when they &s;pring from the ca&s;ual, involuntary a&s;&s;ociations of our ideas.</P>
<P N="6">6. If our thoughts wander from the point we had in view, by means of other men, va|riou&s;ly affecting our &s;en&s;es, they are equally inno|cent &s;till: For it is no more a &s;in, to under&s;tand what I &s;ee and hear, and in many ca&s;es cannot help &s;eeing, hearing, and under&s;tanding, than it is to have eyes and ears. "But if the de|vil injects wandering thoughts, are not tho&s;e thoughts evil?" They are trouble&s;ome, and in that &s;en&s;e evil; but they are not &s;inful. I do not
<PB N="207" REF="039068_0201_101394C595BA1688">know that he &s;poke to our Lord with an audible voice; perhaps he &s;poke to his heart only, when he &s;aid, "All the&s;e things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and wor&s;hip me." But whether he &s;poke inwardly or outwardly, our Lord doubtle&s;s under&s;tood what he &s;aid. He had therefore a thought corre&s;pondent to tho&s;e words. But was it a &s;inful thought? We know it was not. <HI>In him was no &s;in,</HI> either in action, or word, or thought. Nor is there any &s;in in a thou&s;and thoughts of the &s;ame kind, which &s;atan may inject into any of our Lord's followers.</P>
<P N="7">7. It follows, that none of the&s;e wandering thoughts (whatever unwary per&s;ons have affirmed, thereby grieving whom the Lord had not grieved) are incon&s;i&s;tent with perfect love. Indeed if they were, then not only &s;harp pain, but &s;leep it&s;elf would be incon&s;i&s;tent with it: &s;harp pain, for whenever this &s;upervenes, whatever we were before thinking of, it will interrupt our thinking, and of cour&s;e draw our thoughts into another channel: Yea, and &s;leep it&s;elf, as it is a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility and &s;tupidity: And &s;uch as is gene|rally mixt with thoughts wandering over the earth, loo&s;e, wild and incoherent. Yet certainly the&s;e are con&s;i&s;tent with perfect love: So then are all wandering thoughts of this kind.</P>
<P N="4">IV. 1. From what has been ob&s;erved, it is ea&s;y to give a clear an&s;wer to the la&s;t que&s;tion, What kind of wandering thoughts we may expect and pray to be delivered from?</P>
<P>From the former &s;ort of wandering thoughts, tho&s;e wherein the heart wanders from God; from all that are contrary to his will, or that
<PB N="208" REF="039068_0202_101394CA6C5CE348">leave us without God in the world, every one that is perfected in love, is unque&s;tionably deli|vered. This deliverance therefore we may ex|pect: This we may, we ought to pray for. Wandering thoughts of this kind imply unbe|lief, if not enmity again&s;t God. But both of the&s;e he will de&s;troy, will being utterly to an end. And indeed, from all &s;inful wandering thoughts we &s;hall be ab&s;olutely delivered. All that are perfected in love are delivered from the&s;e; el&s;e they were not &s;aved from &s;in. Men and de|vils will tempt them all manner of ways. But they cannot prevail over them.</P>
<P N="2">2. With regard to the latter &s;ort of wandering thoughts, the ca&s;e is widely different. 'Till the cau&s;e is removed, we cannot in rea&s;on expect the effect &s;hould cea&s;e. But the cau&s;es or occa|&s;ions of the&s;e will remain, as long as we remain in the body. So long therefore we have all rea|&s;on to believe, the effects will remain al&s;o.</P>
<P N="3">3. To be more particular. Suppo&s;e a &s;oul, however holy, to dwell in a di&s;tempered body. Suppo&s;e the brain be &s;o thoroughly di&s;ordered, as that <HI>raging madne&s;s</HI> follows: Will not all the thoughts be wild and unconnected, as long as that di&s;order continues? Suppo&s;e a fever occa&s;i|ons that <HI>temporary madne&s;s,</HI> which we term a delirium, can there be any ju&s;t connection of thought, 'till that delirium is removed? Yea, &s;uppo&s;e what is called a <HI>nervous di&s;order,</HI> to ri&s;e to &s;o high a degree, as to occa&s;ion at lea&s;t a <HI>par|tial madne&s;s,</HI> will there not be a thou&s;and wan|dering thoughts? And mu&s;t not the&s;e irregular thoughts continue, as long as the di&s;order which occa&s;ions them?</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="209" REF="039068_0203_101394CD1CCDE6C0">
4. Will not the ca&s;e be the &s;ame, with regard to tho&s;e thoughts that nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e from vio|lent pain? They will, more or le&s;s, continue while that pain continues, by the inviolable or|der of nature. This order likewi&s;e will obtain, where the thoughts are di&s;turbed, broken or in|terrupted, by any defect of the apprehen&s;ions, judgment or imagination, flowing from the natu|ral con&s;titution of the body. And how many in|terruptions may &s;pring from the unaccountable and involuntary a&s;&s;ociation of our ideas? Now all the&s;e are directly or indirectly cau&s;ed by the corruptible body pre&s;&s;ing down the mind. Nor therefore can we expect them to be removed, 'till "this corruptible &s;hall put on incorruption."</P>
<P N="5">5. And then only, when we lie down in the du&s;t, &s;hall we be delivered from tho&s;e wandering thoughts which are occa&s;ioned by what we &s;ee and hear, among tho&s;e by whom we are now &s;ur|rounded. To avoid the&s;e we mu&s;t go out of the world. For as long as we remain therein, as long as there are men and women round about us, and we have eyes to &s;ee and ears to hear, the things which we daily &s;ee and hear, will certainly affect our mind, and will more or le&s;s, break in upon and interrupt our preceding thoughts.</P>
<P N="6">6. And as long as evil &s;pirits roam to and fro in a mi&s;erable, di&s;ordered world, &s;o long they will a&s;&s;ault (whether they can prevail or no) every in|habitant of fle&s;h and blood. They will trouble even tho&s;e whom they cannot de&s;troy: They will attack if they cannot conquer. And from the&s;e attack of our re&s;tle&s;s, unwearied enemies, we mu&s;t not look for an entire deliverance, till we are
<PB N="210" REF="039068_0204_101394CEA3EC4DE8">lodged "Where the wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and where the weary are at re&s;t."</P>
<P N="7">7. To &s;um up the whole. To expect delive|rance from tho&s;e wandering thoughts which are occa&s;ioned by evil &s;pirits, is to expect that the de|vil &s;hould die or fall a&s;leep; or at lea&s;t &s;hould no more go about as a roaring lion. To expect deliverance from tho&s;e which are occa&s;ioned by other men, is to expect either that men &s;hould cea&s;e from the earth; or that we &s;hould be ab&s;o|lutely &s;ecluded from them, and have no inter|cour&s;e with them: or that having eyes we &s;hould not &s;ee, neither hear with our ears, but be as &s;en&s;ele&s;s as &s;tocks or &s;tones. And to pray for de|liverance from tho&s;e which are occa&s;ioned by the body, is in effect to pray that we may leave the body. Otherwi&s;e it is praying for impo&s;&s;ibilities, and ab&s;urdities; praying that God would recon|cile contradictions, by continuing our union with a corruptible body, without the natural, nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of that union. It is as if we &s;hould pray to be angels and men, mortal and immortal at the &s;ame time. Nay, but when that which is immortal is come, mortality is done away.</P>
<P N="8">8. Rather let us pray, both with the &s;pirit and with the under&s;tanding, that <HI>all</HI> the&s;e <HI>things may work together for our good:</HI> That we may &s;uffer all infirmities of our nature, all the interruptions of men, all the a&s;&s;aults and &s;ugge&s;tions of evil &s;pirits, and in all be more than conquerors. Let us pray, that we may be delivered from all &s;in, that both root and branch may be de&s;troyed; that we may be "clean&s;ed from all pollution of fle&s;h and &s;pirit," from every evil temper and word-and wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: That we may "love the Lord our God

<P>We are not ignorant of his Devices.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE devices whereby the wi&s;e <HI>god of this world,</HI> labours to de&s;troy the children of God, or at lea&s;t to torment whom he cannot de|&s;troy, to perplex and hinder them in running the race which is &s;et before them, are numberle&s;s as the &s;tars of heaven, or the &s;and upon the &s;ea-&s;hore. But it is of one of them only that I now propo&s;e to &s;peak, (although exerted in various ways) whereby he endeavours to divide the go&s;pel again&s;t it&s;elf, and by one part of it to overthrow the other.</P>
<P N="2">2. The inward kingdom of heaven, which is &s;et up in the heart of all that <HI>repent and believe the go&s;pel,</HI> is no other than "righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t." Every babe in Chri&s;t knows we are made partakers of the&s;e, the very hour that we believe in Je&s;us. But the&s;e are only the fir&s;t fruits of his Spirit: the harve&s;t is not yet. Although the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings are inconceivably great, yet we tru&s;t to &s;ee grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er than the&s;e. We tru&s;t to <HI>love the Lord our God,</HI> not only as we do now, with a weak though &s;incere affection, but "w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> all our heart, with all our mind, with all our &s;oul, and with all our &s;trength." We look for power to "rejoice evermore, to pray without cea&s;ing and in every thing to give thanks;" knowing "this is the will of God concerning <HI>us</HI> in Chri&s;t Je&s;us."</P>

<P N="5">5. Now this is the grand device of &s;atan, to de&s;troy the fir&s;t work of God in the &s;oul, or at lea&s;t, to hinder its increa&s;e, by our expecta|tion of that greater work. It is therefore my pre&s;ent de&s;ign, Fir&s;t, to point out the &s;everal ways whereby he endeavours this: and, Se|condly, To ob&s;erve how we may retort the&s;e fiery darts of the wicked one: How we may ri&s;e the higher by what he intends for an occa&s;ion of our falling.</P>

I. 1. I am, fir&s;t, to point out the &s;everal ways wereby Satan endeavours to de&s;troy the fir&s;t work of God in the &s;oul, or at lea&s;t, to hinder its increa&s;e, by our expectation of that greater work. And fir&s;t. He endeavours to damp our joy in the Lord, by the con&s;ideration of our own vilene&s;s, &s;infulne&s;s, unworthine&s;s, added to this, that there <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be a far greater change than is yet, or we cannot &s;ee the Lord. If we knew we <HI>mu&s;t</HI> remain as we are, even to the day of our death, we might po&s;&s;ibly draw a kind of comfort, poor as it was, from that nece&s;&s;ity. But as we know, we need not remain in this &s;tate, as we are a&s;&s;ured, there is a greater change to come, and that unle&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;in be done away in this life, we cannot &s;ee God in glory: that &s;ubtle adver&s;ary often damps the joy we &s;hould otherwi&s;e feel in what we have already attained, by a perver&s;e repre&s;entation of what we have not attained, and the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of attaining it. So that we cannot rejoice in what we have, becau&s;e there is more which we have not. We cannot rightly ta&s;te the goodne&s;s of God, who hath done &s;o great things for us, becau&s;e there are &s;o much greater things, which as yet he hath not done. Likewi&s;e the deeper conviction God works in us of our pre&s;ent unholine&s;s, and the more vehement de&s;ire we feel in our heart, of the entire holine&s;s he hath promi&s;ed, the more are we tempted to think lightly of the pre&s;ent gifts of God, and to undervalue what we have already received, be|cau&s;e of what we have not received.</P>
<P N="2">2. If he can prevail thus far, if he can damp our joy, he will &s;oon attack our peace al&s;o. He will &s;ugge&s;t, "Are you fit to &s;ee God? He is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity. How
<PB N="215" REF="039068_0209_101394DAE3FC8258">then can you flatter your&s;elf, &s;o as to imagine he beholds <HI>you</HI> with approbation? God is holy: You are unholy. What communion hath light with darkne&s;s? How is it po&s;&s;ible that <HI>you,</HI> un|clean as you are, &s;hould be in a &s;tate of accep|tance with God? You &s;ee indeed the mark, the prize of your high calling. But do you not &s;ee, it afar off? How can you pre&s;ume then to think, that all your &s;ins are already blotted out? How can this be, until you are brought nearer to God, until you bear more re&s;emblance to him?" Thus will he endeavour, not only to &s;hake your peace, but even to overturn the very foundation of it: to bring you back by in&s;en&s;ible degrees, to the point from whence you &s;et out fir&s;t: Even to &s;eek for ju&s;tification by works, or by your own righteou&s;ne&s;s; to make &s;omething in <HI>you</HI> the ground of your acceptance, or at lea&s;t nece&s;&s;arily previous to it.</P>
<P N="3">3. Or if we hold fa&s;t, <HI>other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, even Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> and I am <HI>ju&s;tified freely by God's grace, through the redemption which is in Je&s;us:</HI> Yet he will not cea&s;e to urge, "But <HI>the tree is known by its fruits.</HI> And have you the fruits of ju&s;tification? Is <HI>that mind in you which was in Chri&s;t Je&s;us?</HI> Are you <HI>dead unto &s;in and alive unto</HI> righteou&s;|ne&s;s? Are you made conformable to the death of Chri&s;t, and do you know the power of his re|&s;urrection?" And then, comparing the &s;mall fruits we feel in our &s;ouls, with the fullne&s;s of the promi&s;es, we &s;hall be ready to conclude, &s;urely God hath not &s;aid, that my &s;ins are for|given me! Surely I have not received the remi&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="216" REF="039068_0210_101394E05DF99198">of my &s;ins; for what lot have I among them that are &s;anctified?"</P>
<P N="4">4. More e&s;pecially in the time of &s;ickne&s;s and pain, he will pre&s;s this with all his might. "Is it not the word of him that cannot lie, without holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord? But you are not holy. You know it well; you know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oline&s;s is the full image of God. And how far is this above, out of your &s;ight? You cannot attain un|to it. Therefore all your labour has been in vain. All the&s;e things you have &s;uffered in vain. You have &s;pent your &s;trength for nought. You are yet in your &s;ins and mu&s;t therefore peri&s;h at la&s;t." And thus, if your eye be not &s;teadily fixt on him who hath borne all your &s;ins, he will bring you again under that <HI>fear of death,</HI> whereby you was &s;o long <HI>&s;ubject unto bondage:</HI> And by this means impair, if not wholly de&s;troy, your peace as well as joy in the Lord.</P>
<P N="5">5. But his ma&s;ter-piece of &s;ubtilty is &s;till be|hind. Not content to &s;trike at your peace and joy, he will carry his attempts farther yet: He will le|vel his a&s;&s;ault again&s;t your righteou&s;ne&s;s al&s;o. He will endeavour to &s;hake, yea, if it be po&s;&s;ible, to de&s;troy the holine&s;s you have already received by your very expectation of receiving more, of attain|ing all the image of God.</P>
<P N="6">6. The manner wherein he attempts this, may partly appear from what has been already ob&s;erv|ed. For, Fir&s;t, By &s;triking at our joy in the Lord, he &s;trikes likewi&s;e at our holine&s;s: &s;eeing joy in the Holy Gho&s;t is a precious means of promoting every holy temper; a choice in&s;trument of God whereby he carries on much of his work in a be|lieving &s;oul. And it is a con&s;iderable help not on|ly
<PB N="217" REF="039068_0211_101394E31B98DD78">to inward, but al&s;o to outward holine&s;s. It &s;trengthens our hands to go on in the work of faith and in the labour of love; manfully to "fight the good fight of faith, and to lay hold on eternal life." It is peculiarly de&s;igned of God to be a ba|lance both again&s;t inward and outward &s;ufferings: To "lift up the hands that hang down and <HI>confirm</HI> the feeble knees." Con&s;equently, whatever damps our joy in the Lord, proportionably ob&s;tructs our holine&s;s. And therefore &s;o far as &s;atan &s;hakes our joy, he hinders our holine&s;s al&s;o.</P>
<P N="7">7. The &s;ame effect will en&s;ure, if he can by any means either de&s;troy or &s;hake our peace. For the peace of God is another precious means of advancing the image of God in us. There is &s;carce a greater help to holine&s;s than this, a con|tinual tranquility of &s;pirit, the evenne&s;s of a mind &s;tayed upon God; a calm repo&s;e in the blood of Je&s;us. And without this, it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to grow in grace, and in the vital knowledge of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. For all fear (unle&s;s the tender, filial fear) freezes and be numbs the &s;oul. It binds all the &s;prings of &s;piritual life, and &s;tops all motion of the heart toward God. And doubt, as it were, be|mires the &s;oul, &s;o that it &s;ticks fa&s;t in the deep clay. Therefore in the &s;ame proportion as either of the&s;e prevail, our growth in holine&s;s is hindered.</P>
<P N="8">8. At the &s;ame time that our wi&s;e adver&s;ary en|deavours, to make our conviction of the nece&s;&s;ity of perfect love, an occa&s;ion of &s;haking our peace by doubts and fears, he endeavours to weaken, if not de&s;troy our faith. Indeed the&s;e are in&s;epa|rably connected, &s;o that they mu&s;t &s;tand or fall together. So long as faith &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, we remain in peace; our heart &s;tands fa&s;t, while it believes in
<PB N="218" REF="039068_0212_101394E4A6174C08">the Lord. But if we let go our faith, our filial confidence in a loving pardoning God, our peace is at an end, the very foundation on which it &s;tood being overthrown. And this is the only foundation of holine&s;s as well as of peace. Con|&s;equently whatever &s;trikes at this, &s;trikes at the very root of all holine&s;s. For without this faith, without an abiding &s;en&s;e, that Chri&s;t loved me and gave him&s;elf for me, without a continuing con|viction, that God for Chri&s;t's &s;ake is merciful to me a &s;inner, it is impo&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould love God. "We love him becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved us;" and in proportion to the &s;trength and clearne&s;s of our conviction, that he hath loved us and accepted us in his Son. And unle&s;s we love God, it is not po&s;&s;ible that we &s;hould love our neighbour as our|&s;elves: Nor con&s;equently, that we &s;hould have any right affections, either toward God or toward man. It evidently follows, that whatever weakens our faith, mu&s;t in the &s;ame degree ob&s;truct our ho|line&s;s. And this is not only the mo&s;t effectual, but al&s;o the mo&s;t compendious way of de&s;troying all holine&s;s. Seeing it does not effect any one chri&s;|tian temper, any &s;ingle grace or fruit of the &s;pirit, but &s;o far as it &s;ucceeds, tears up the very root of the whole work of God.</P>
<P N="9">9. No marvel therefore, that the ruler of the darkne&s;s of this world, &s;hould here put forth all his &s;trength. And &s;o we find by experience. For it is far ea&s;ier to conceive than it is to ex|pre&s;s the un&s;peakable violence, wherewith this temptation is frequently urged on them, who hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s. When they &s;ee in a &s;trong and clear light, on the one hand, the de&s;perate wickedne&s;s of their own
<PB N="219" REF="039068_0213_101394E788467C08">hearts; on the other hand, the un&s;potted holi|ne&s;s to which they are called in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: on the one hand, the depth of their own cor|ruption, of their total alienation from God; on the other, the height of the Glory of God, that Image of the Holy One wherein they are to be renewed: There is many times no &s;pirit left in them; they could almo&s;t cry out, with God this is impo&s;&s;ible. They are ready to give up both faith and hope, to ca&s;t away that very con|fidence, whereby they are to overcome all things, and all things through Chri&s;t &s;trengthening them; whereby, <HI>after</HI> they <HI>have done the will of God,</HI> they are to <HI>receive the promi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. And if they "hold fa&s;t the beginning of their confidence &s;tedfa&s;t unto the end," they &s;hall un|doubtedly receive the promi&s;e of God, reaching thro' both time and eternity. But here is another &s;nare laid for our feet. While we earne&s;tly pant for that part of the promi&s;e which is to be accom|pli&s;hed here, "for the glorious liberty of the chil|dren of God," we may be led unawares, from the con&s;ideration of the glory which &s;hall hereafter be revealed. Our eye may be in&s;en&s;ibly turned a&s;ide from that "crown which the righteous Judge," hath promi&s;ed to "give at that day, to all that love his appearing:" And we may be drawn away from the view of that incorruptible inheritance which is re&s;erved in heaven for us. But this al&s;o would be a lo&s;s to our fouls, and an ob&s;truction to our holine&s;s. For to walk in the continual &s;ight of our goal, is a needful help in our running the race that is &s;et before us. This it was, the having "re&s;pect unto the recompence of reward," which of old time encouraged <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI>
<PB N="220" REF="039068_0214_101394EBD8E22DA0">rather "to &s;uffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the plea&s;ures of &s;in for a &s;ea&s;on: e&s;teeming the reproach of Chri&s;t, greater riches than the trea&s;ures of Egypt." Nay, it is expre&s;|ly &s;aid of a greater than him, That "for the joy that was &s;et before him, he endured the cro&s;s and de&s;pi&s;ed the &s;hame," 'till he "&s;at down at the right hand of the throne of God." Whence we may ea&s;ily infer, how much more needful for us, is the view of that joy &s;et before us, that we may endure whatever cro&s;s the wi&s;dom of God lays upon us, and pre&s;s on through holine&s;s to glory.</P>
<P N="11">11. But while we are reaching to this, as well as to that glorious liberty which is preparatory to it, we may be in danger of falling into another &s;nare of the devil, whereby he labours to intan|gle the children of God. We may take too much "thought for to-morrow," &s;o as to neglect the improvement of to-day. We may &s;o expect <HI>per|fect love,</HI> as not to u&s;e that, which is already <HI>&s;hed abroad in our hearts.</HI> There have not been wanting in&s;tances of tho&s;e, who have greatly &s;uf|fered hereby. They were &s;o taken up with what they were to receive hereafter, as utterly to neglect what they had already received. In expectation of having five talents more, they buried their one talent in the earth. At lea&s;t they did not im|prove it as they might have done, to the glory of God and the good of their own &s;ouls.</P>
<P N="12">12. Thus does the &s;ubtle adver&s;ary of God and man, endeavour to make void the coun&s;el of God, by dividing the go&s;pel again&s;t it&s;elf, and making one part of it overthrow the other: while the fir&s;t work of God in the &s;oul is de&s;troy|ed by the expectation of his perfect work. We
<PB N="221" REF="039068_0215_101394ED60B46020">have &s;een &s;everal of the ways wherein he attempts this, by cutting off, as it were, the &s;prings of holine&s;s. But this he likewi&s;e does more direct|ly, by making that ble&s;&s;ed hope an occa&s;ion of un|holy tempers.</P>
<P N="13">13. Thus, whenever our heart is eagerly a|thir&s;t for all the great and precious promi&s;es, when we pant after the fulne&s;s of God, as the hart after the water-brook, when our &s;oul break|eth out in fervent de&s;ire, "Why are his chariot-wheels &s;o long a coming?" He will not neglect the opportunity, of tempting us to murmur again&s;t God. He will u&s;e all his wi&s;dom and all his &s;trength, if haply in an unguarded hour, we may be influenced to repine at our Lord, for thus de|laying his coming. At lea&s;t, he will labour to excite &s;ome degree of fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tfulne&s;s or impatience: and perhaps of envy at tho&s;e, whom we believe to have already attained the prize of our high calling. He well knows, that by giving way to any of the&s;e tempers, we are pulling down the very thing we would build up. By <HI>thus</HI> follow|ing after perfect holine&s;s, we become more un|holy than before. Yea, there is great danger that our la&s;t &s;tate &s;hould be wor&s;e than the fir&s;t: Like them of whom the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks, in tho&s;e dreadful words, "It had been better they had never known the way of righteou&s;ne&s;s, than after they had known it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them."</P>
<P N="14">14. And from hence he hopes to reap another advantage, even to bring up an evil report of the good way. He is &s;en&s;ible, how few are able to di&s;tingui&s;h (and too many are not willing &s;o to do) between the accidental abu&s;e and the natural
<PB N="222" REF="039068_0216_101394EFE9F99EE8">tendency of a doctrine. The&s;e therefore, will he continually blend together, with regard to the doctrine of chri&s;tian perfection: in order to pre|judice the minds of unwary men again&s;t the glo|rious promi&s;es of God. And how frequently, how generally, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, how univer&s;al|ly has he prevailed herein? For who is there that ob&s;erves any of the&s;e accidental ill effects of this doctrine, and does not immediately conclude, this is its natural tendency? And does not readi|ly cry out, "See, the&s;e are the fruits (meaning the natural, nece&s;&s;ary fruits) of &s;uch doctrine!" Not &s;o. They are fruits which may accidentally &s;pring from the abu&s;e of a great and precious truth. But the abu&s;e of this, or any other &s;crip|tural doctrine, does by no means de&s;troy its u&s;e. Neither can the unfaithfulne&s;s of man, pervert|ing his right way, "make the promi&s;e of God of none effect." No: let God be true and every man a liar. The word of the Lord it &s;hall &s;tand. "Faithful is he that hath promi&s;ed: he al&s;o will do it." Let us not then be "removed from the hope of the go&s;pel." Rather let us ob&s;erve, which was the &s;econd thing propo&s;ed, how we may retort the&s;e fiery darts of the wicked one: how we may ri&s;e the higher, by what he intends for an occa&s;ion of our falling.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. And, fir&s;t, Does &s;atan endeavour to damp your joy in the Lord, by the con&s;ideration of your &s;infulne&s;s, added to this, that without entire, univer&s;al "holine&s;s no man can &s;ee the Lord?" You may ca&s;t back this dart upon his own head, while through the grace of God, the more you feel of your own vilene&s;s, the more
<PB N="223" REF="039068_0217_101394F278676078">you rejoice in confident hope, that all this &s;hall be done away. While you hold fa&s;t this hope, every evil temper you feel, though you hate it with a perfect hatred, may be a means, not of le&s;&s;ening your humble joy, but rather of increa&s;|ing it. "This and this, may you &s;ay, &s;hall like|wi&s;e peri&s;h from the pre&s;ence of the Lord. Like as the wax melteth at the fire, &s;o &s;hall this melt away before his face." By this means the greater that change is, which remains to be wrought in your &s;oul, the more may you triumph in the Lord and rejoice in the God of your &s;alvation: Who hath done &s;o great things for you already, and will do &s;o much greater things than the&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. Secondly, The more vehemently he a&s;&s;aults your peace with that &s;ugge&s;tion, "God is holy, you are unholy. You are immen&s;ely di&s;tant from that holine&s;s, without which you cannot &s;ee God: how then can you be in the favour of God? How can you fancy you are ju&s;tified?" Take the more earne&s;t heed to hold fa&s;t that, <HI>Not by works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which I have done.</HI> I am <HI>found in him:</HI> I am <HI>accepted in the beloved; not having my own righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> (as the cau&s;e ei|ther in whole or in part of our ju&s;tification be|fore God) <HI>but that which is by faith in Chri&s;t, the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by faith.</HI> O bind this about your neck: write it upon the table of thy heart. Wear it as a bracelet upon thy arm, as frontlets between thine eyes: I am <HI>ju&s;ti|fied freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Value and e&s;teem more and more that precious truth, <HI>by grace we are &s;aved through faith.</HI> Admire more and more the free grace of God, in &s;o loving the world as to give
<PB N="224" REF="039068_0218_101394F662090B10"><HI>his only Son, that who&s;oever believeth on him might not peri&s;h but have everla&s;ting life.</HI> So &s;hall the &s;en&s;e of the &s;infulne&s;s you feel on the one hand, and of the holine&s;s you expect on the other, both contribute to e&s;tabli&s;h your peace and to make it flow as a river. So &s;hall that peace flow on with an even &s;tream, in &s;pite of all tho&s;e mountains of ungodline&s;s, which &s;hall become a plain in the day when the Lord cometh, to take full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your heart. Neither will &s;ickne&s;s or pain, or the approach of death, occa&s;ion any doubt or fear. You know a day, an hour, a moment with God is as a thou&s;and years. He cannot be &s;treightened for time, wherein to work whatever remains to be done in your &s;oul. And God's time is always the be&s;t time. There|fore be thou <HI>careful for nothing.</HI> Only <HI>make</HI> thy <HI>reque&s;t known unto him,</HI> and that not without doubt or fear, but <HI>thank&s;giving.</HI> As being pre|viou&s;ly a&s;&s;ured, he cannot withhold from thee any manner of thing that is good.</P>
<P N="3">3. Thirdly, The more you are tempted to give up your &s;hield, to ca&s;t away your faith, your confidence in his love, &s;o much the more take heed that you hold fa&s;t that, whereunto you have attained. So much the more labour to <HI>&s;tir up the gift of God which is in you.</HI> Never let that &s;lip, I have <HI>an Advocate with the Father, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the righteous:</HI> And <HI>the life I now live, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave him&s;elf for me.</HI> Be this thy glory and crown of rejoicing. And &s;ee that no one take thy crown. Hold that fa&s;t, <HI>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and &s;hall &s;tand at the latter day upon the earth.</HI> And I now <HI>have redemption in his blood, even the
<PB N="225" REF="039068_0219_101394F7EA2922F8">forgivene&s;s of &s;ins.</HI> Thus, being filled with all peace and joy in believing, pre&s;s on in the peace and joy of faith to the renewal of thy whole &s;oul, in the image of him that created thee. Mean while cry continually to God, that thou maye&s;t &s;ee that prize of thy high calling, not as &s;atan repre&s;ents it, in a horrid dreadful &s;hape, but in its genuine native beauty: Not as &s;ome|thing that <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be, or thou wilt go to hell, but as what <HI>may</HI> be, to lead thee to heaven. Look upon it as the mo&s;t <HI>de&s;irable</HI> gift, which is in all the &s;tores of the rich mercies of God. Behold|ing it in the true point of light, thou wilt hunger after it more and more: Thy whole &s;oul will be athir&s;t for God, and for this glorious conformity to his likene&s;s. And having received a good hope of this, and &s;trong con&s;olation through grace, thou wilt no more be weary or faint in thy mind, but wilt follow on till thou attaine&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4. In the &s;ame power of faith, pre&s;s on to glory. Indeed this is the &s;ame pro&s;pect &s;till. God hath joined from the beginning pardon, holine&s;s, heaven. And why &s;hould man put them a&s;under? O! beware of this. Let not one link of the golden chain be broken. God for Chri&s;t's &s;ake hath forgiven me. He is now re|newing me in his own image. Shortly he will make me meet for him&s;elf, and take me to &s;tand before his face. I whom he hath ju&s;tified through the blood of his Son, being thoroughly &s;anctified by his Spirit, &s;hall quickly a&s;cend to the "New Jeru&s;alem, the city of the living God." Yet a little while and I &s;hall "Come to the general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t-born, and to God the Judge of all, and to Je&s;us the Mediator
<PB N="226" REF="039068_0220_101394F973E3EB98">of the new covenant." How &s;oon will the&s;e &s;hadows flee away, and the day of eternity dawn upon me! How &s;oon &s;hall I drink of "the river of the water of life, going out of the throne of God and of the Lamb? There all his &s;ervants &s;hall prai&s;e him and &s;hall &s;ee his face, and his name &s;hall be upon their foreheads. And no night &s;hall be there; and they have no need of a candle or the light of the &s;un. For the Lord God en|lighteneth them, and they &s;hall reign for ever and ever.</P>
<P N="5">5. And if you thus <HI>ta&s;te of the good word and the powers of the world to come,</HI> you will not murmur again&s;t God, becau&s;e you are not yet <HI>meet for the inheritance of the &s;aints in light.</HI> In&s;tead of repining at your not being wholly delivered, you will prai&s;e God for thus far delivering you. You will magnify God for what he hath done, and take it as an earne&s;t of what he will do. You will not fret again&s;t him, becau&s;e you are not yet renewed, but ble&s;s him becau&s;e you &s;hall be; and becau&s;e <HI>now is your &s;alvation</HI> from all &s;in, <HI>nearer than when you</HI> fir&s;t <HI>believed.</HI> In|&s;tead of u&s;ele&s;ly tormenting your&s;elf becau&s;e the time is not fully come, you will calmly and quietly wait for it, knowing that it <HI>will come and will not tarry.</HI> You may therefore the more cheerfully endure as yet, the burden of &s;in that &s;till remains in you, becau&s;e it will not always remain. Yet a little while and it &s;hall be clean gone. Only "tarry thou the Lord's lei&s;ure: be &s;trong and he &s;hall comfort thy heart, and put thou thy tru&s;t in the Lord.</P>
<P N="6">6. And if you &s;ee any who appear (&s;o far as man can judge, but God alone &s;earcheth the
<PB N="227" REF="039068_0221_101394FEFA176620">hearts) to be already partakers of their hope, al|ready "made perfect in love:" Far from envying the grace of God in them, let it rejoice and com|fort your heart. Glorify God for their &s;ake. "If one member is honoured," &s;hall not "all the mem|bers rejoice with it?" In&s;tead of jealou&s;y or evil &s;urmi&s;ing concerning them, prai&s;e God for the con|&s;olation. Rejoice in having a fre&s;h proof of the faithfulne&s;s of God in fulfilling all his promi&s;es. And &s;tir your&s;elf up the more to "apprehend that for which you al&s;o are apprehended of Chri&s;t Je&s;us."</P>
<P N="7">7. In order to this, redeem the time. Improve the pre&s;ent moment. Buy up every opportunity of growing in grace, or of doing good. Let not the thought of receiving more grace to-morrow, make you negligent of to-day. You have one talent now. If you expect five more, &s;o much the rather improve that you have. And the more you expect to receive hereafter, the more labour for God now. Sufficient for the day is the grace thereof. God is now pouring his benefits upon you. Now approve your&s;elf a faithful &s;teward, of the pre&s;ent grace of God. Whatever may be to-morrow, give all diligence to-day, to "add to your faith courage, temperance, patience, bro|therly kindne&s;s and the fear of God," 'till you at|tain that pure and perfect love. Let <HI>the&s;e things be</HI> now <HI>in you and abound.</HI> Be not now &s;lothful or unfruitful. So &s;hall an entrance be mini&s;ter|ed "into the everla&s;ting kingdom of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t."</P>
<P N="8">8. La&s;tly, If in time pa&s;t you have abu&s;ed this ble&s;&s;ed hope of being holy as he is holy, yet do
<PB N="228" REF="039068_0222_10139501D2F4B8E0">not therefore ca&s;t it away. Let the abu&s;e cea&s;e, the u&s;e remain. U&s;e it now to the more abund|ant glory of God and profit of your own &s;oul. In &s;tedfa&s;t faith, in calm tranquility of &s;pirit, in full a&s;&s;urance of hope, rejoicing evermore for what God hath done, "pre&s;s ye on unto perfection." Daily growing in the knowledge of our Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, and going on from &s;trength to &s;trength, in re&s;ignation, in patience, in humble thankfulne&s;s for what ye have attained, and for what ye &s;hall, run the race &s;et before you, <HI>looking unto Je&s;us,</HI> 'till through perfect love ye enter into his glory!</P>

<P N="1">1. HOW widely different is this from the fair pictures of human nature, which men have drawn in all ages! The writings of many of the ancients abound with gay de&s;criptions of the dignity of man: whom &s;ome of them paint as having all virtue and happine&s;s in his compo&s;ition, or at lea&s;t, entirely in his power, without being beholden to any other being: yea, as &s;elf-&s;uffici|ent, able to live on his own &s;tock, and little in|ferior to God him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="2">2. Nor have heathens alone, men who were guided in their re&s;earches by little more than the dim light of rea&s;on, but many likewi&s;e of them that bear the name of Chri&s;t, and to whom are intru&s;ted the oracles of God, &s;poke as magnifi|cently concerning the nature of man, as if it were all innocence and perfection. Accounts of this kind have particularly abounded in the pre&s;ent century; and perhaps in no part of the world more than in our own country. Here not a few per&s;ons of &s;trong under&s;tanding, as well as exten|&s;ive
<PB N="230" REF="039068_0224_10139507450B88D0">learning, have employed their utmo&s;t abilities to &s;hew what they termed, "The fair &s;ide of human nature." And it mu&s;t be acknowledged, That if their accounts of him be ju&s;t, man is &s;till but <HI>a little lower than the angels,</HI> or (as the words may be more literally rendered) <HI>a little le&s;s than God.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Is it any wonder, that the&s;e accounts are very readily received by the generality of men? For who is not ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to think favour|ably of him&s;elf; Accordingly writers of this kind are almo&s;t univer&s;ally read, admired, applauded. And innumerable are the converts they have made, not only in the gay, but the learned world. So that it is now quite unfa&s;hionable to talk other|wi&s;e, to &s;ay any thing to the di&s;paragement of human nature: which is generally allowed, not|with&s;tanding a few infirmities, to be very inno|cent and wi&s;e and virtuous.</P>
<P N="4">4. But in the mean time, what mu&s;t we do with our bibles; for they will never agree with this. The&s;e accounts, however plea&s;ing to fle&s;h and blood, are utterly irreconcileable with the &s;crip|tural. The &s;cripture avers, that by "one man's di&s;obedience, all men were con&s;tituted &s;inners:" that <HI>in Adam all died,</HI> &s;piritually died, lo&s;t the life and the image of God: that fallen, &s;inful Adam then <HI>begat a &s;on in his own likene&s;s:</HI> nor was it po&s;|&s;ible he &s;hould beget him in any other: for <HI>who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</HI> That con&s;e|quently <HI>we</HI> as well as other men "were by nature dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, without hope, without God in the world," and therefore <HI>children of wrath:</HI> That every man may &s;ay, "I was &s;hapen in wick|edne&s;s, and in &s;in did my mother conceive me:" that "there is no difference, in that all have &s;in|ned
<PB N="231" REF="039068_0225_10139509F87016F0">and come &s;hort of the glory of God:" Of that glorious image of God, wherein man was originally created And hence, when "the Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, he &s;aw that they were all gone out of the way," they were "altogether become abominable: there was none righteous, no not one," none that truly <HI>&s;ought after God:</HI> ju&s;t agreeable this, to what is declar|ed by the Holy Gho&s;t, in the words above recit|ed, <HI>God &s;aw</HI> when he looked down from heaven before, "that the wickedne&s;s of man was great in the earth:" &s;o great, that "every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continu|ally."</P>
<P>This is God's account of man: from which I &s;hall take occa&s;ion, Fir&s;t, To &s;hew what men were before the flood; Secondly, To enquire, whether they are not the &s;ame now? and thirdly to add &s;ome inferences.</P>
<P N="1">I. 1. I am, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By opening the words of the text to &s;hew, What men were before the flood. And we may fully depend on the account here given. For God &s;aw it, and he cannot be deceived. He "&s;aw that the wickedne&s;s of man was great." Not of this or that man; not of a few men only; not barely of the greater part, but of <HI>man in general,</HI> of men univer&s;ally. The word includes the whole human race, every partaker of human nature. And it is not ea&s;y for us to com|pute their numbers, to tell how many thou&s;ands and millions they were. The earth then retained much of its primeval beauty and original fruitful|ne&s;s. The face of the globe was not rent and torn, as it is now: and &s;pring and &s;ummer went hand in hand. 'Tis therefore probable, it afforded &s;u&s;te|nance
<PB N="232" REF="039068_0226_1013950B88C8E6C0">for far more inhabitants, than it is now ca|pable of &s;u&s;taining: and the&s;e mu&s;t be immen&s;e|ly multiplied, while men begat &s;ons and daught|ers for &s;even or eight hundred years together. Yet among all this inconceivable number, <HI>only Noah found favour with God.</HI> He alone (perhaps in|cluding part of his hou&s;hold) was an exception from the univer&s;al wickedne&s;s, which by the ju&s;t judgment of God, in a &s;hort time after brought on univer&s;al de&s;truction.

He <HI>&s;aw all the imaginations.</HI> It is not po&s;&s;ible to find a word of a more exten&s;ive &s;ignification. It includes whatever is formed, made, fabricated within; all that is, or pa&s;&s;es in the foul; every inclination, affection, pa&s;&s;ion, appetite; every temper, de&s;ign, thought. It mu&s;t of con&s;equence include every word and action, as naturally flowing from tho&s;e fountains: and be|ing either good or evil, according to the fountain from which they &s;everally flow.</P>
<P N="3">3. Now <HI>God &s;aw that all</HI> this, the whole thereof <HI>was evil,</HI> contrary to moral rectitude; contrary to the nature of God, which nece&s;&s;arily includes all good; contrary to the divine will, the eternal &s;tandard of good and evil: contrary to the pure, holy image of God, wherein man was originally created, and wherein he &s;tood when God &s;urvey|ing the works of his hands, &s;aw them <HI>all</HI> to be <HI>very good:</HI> contrary to ju&s;tice, mercy and truth, and
<PB N="233" REF="039068_0227_1013950E938CB320">to the e&s;&s;ential relations which each man bore to his Creator, and his fellow creatures.</P>
<P N="4">4. But was there not good mingled with the evil? Was there not light intermixed with the darkne&s;s? No; none at all: <HI>God &s;aw that the whole imagination of the heart</HI> of man was <HI>only evil.</HI> It cannot indeed be denied, but many of them, perhaps all, had good motions put into their hearts. For the Spirit of God did then al|&s;o <HI>&s;trive with man,</HI> if haply he might repent: more e&s;pecially during that gracious reprieve, the hundred and twenty years, while the ark was pre|paring. But &s;till <HI>in his fle&s;h dwelt no good thing:</HI> all his nature was purely evil. It was wholly con|&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, and unmixt with any thing of an oppo&s;ite nature.</P>
<P N="5">5. However, it may &s;till be a matter of enquiry, "Was there no intermi&s;&s;ion of this evil? Were there no lucid intervals, wherein &s;omething good might be found in the heart of man?" We are not here to con&s;ider, what the grace of God might occa&s;ionally work in his &s;oul. And ab&s;tracting from this, we have no rea&s;on to believe, there was any intermi&s;&s;ion of that evil. For God who <HI>&s;aw the whole imagination of the thoughts of his heart to be only evil,</HI> &s;aw likewi&s;e, that it was always the &s;ame, that it was <HI>only evil continually;</HI> every year, every day, every hour, every moment. He ne|ver deviated into good.</P>
<P N="2">II. Such is the authentic account of the whole race of mankind, which he, who knoweth what is in man, who &s;earcheth the heart and trieth the reins, hath left upon record for our in&s;truction.
<PB N="234" REF="039068_0228_101395101ACF1150">Such were all men, before God brought the flood upon the earth. We are <HI>Secondly,</HI> to enquire whe|ther they are the &s;ame now?</P>
<P N="1">1. And this is certain, the &s;cripture gives us no rea&s;on, to think any otherwi&s;e of them. On the contrary, all the above cited pa&s;&s;ages of &s;crip|ture refer to tho&s;e, who lived after the flood. It was above a thou&s;and years after, that God de|clared by David concerning the children of men, "They are all gone out of the way" of truth and holine&s;s; "there is none righteous, no, not one." And to this bear all the prophets witne&s;s, in their &s;everal generations. So I&s;aiah, concerning God's peculiar people, (and certainly the heathens were in no better condition) "The whole head is &s;ick, and the whole heart faint. From the &s;ole of the foot, even unto the head, there is no &s;oundne&s;s, but wounds, and brui&s;es, and putrifying &s;ores." The &s;ame account is given by all the apo&s;tles, yea, by the whole tenor of the oracles of God. From all the&s;e we learn, concerning man in his natu|ral &s;tate, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by the grace of God, that "all the imaginations of the thoughts of his heart" are &s;till "evil, only evil," and that <HI>continually.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. And this account of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of man is confirmed by daily experience. It is true, the natural man di&s;cerns it not: and this is not to be wondered at. So long as a man born blind, con|tinues &s;o, he is &s;carce &s;en&s;ible of his want. Much le&s;s, could we &s;uppo&s;e a place where all were born without &s;ight, would they be &s;en&s;ible of the want of it. In like manner, &s;o long as men remain in their natural blindne&s;s of under&s;tanding, they are not &s;en&s;ible of their &s;piritual wants, and of this in particular. But as &s;oon as God opens the
<PB N="235" REF="039068_0229_10139515313AE7C0">eyes of their under&s;tanding, they &s;ee the &s;tate they were in before; they are then deeply con|vinced, that <HI>every man living,</HI> them&s;elves e&s;peci|ally, are by nature <HI>altogether vanity,</HI> that is, fol|ly and ignorance, &s;in and wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. We &s;ee, when God opens our eyes, that we were before <GAP DESC="foreign"><HI>without God,</HI> or ra|ther, <HI>athie&s;ts in the world.</HI> We had by nature no knowledge of God, no acquaintance. It is true, as &s;oon as we came to the u&s;e of rea&s;on, we learned "the invi&s;ible things of God, even his e|ternal power and godhead, from the things that are made." From the things that are &s;een, we in|ferred the exi&s;tence of an eternal, powerful Being, that is not &s;een. But &s;till, although we acknow|ledge, we had no acquaintance with, him. As we know there is an emperor of <HI>China,</HI> whom yet we do not know; &s;o we knew, there was a King of all the earth; yet we know him not. Indeed we could not, by any of our natural faculties. By none of the&s;e could we attain the knowledge of God. We could no more perceive him by our natural under&s;tanding, than we could &s;ee him with our eyes. For "no one knoweth the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son willeth to re|veal him. And no one knoweth the Son, but the Father, and he to whom the Father revealeth him."</P>
<P N="4">4. We read of an ancient king, who, being de&s;irous to know, what was the natural language of men, in order to bring the matter to a certain i&s;&s;ue, made the following experiment. He or|dered two infants, as &s;oon as they were born, to be conveyed to a place prepared for them, where they were brought up without any in&s;truction as
<PB N="236" REF="039068_0230_10139516B9BFA930">all, and without ever hearing a human voice. And what was the event? Why, That when they were at length brought out of their confine|ment they &s;pake no language at all; they utter|ed only inarticulate &s;ounds, like tho&s;e of other animals. Were two infants in like manner to be brought up from the womb, without being in|&s;tructed in any religion, there is little room to doubt, but (unle&s;s the grace of God interpo&s;ed) the event would be ju&s;t the &s;ame. They would have no religion at all: they would have no more of God, than the bea&s;ts of the field, than <HI>the wild a&s;s's colt.</HI> Such is <HI>natural religion</HI> ab&s;tracted from traditional, and from the influences of God's Spirit!</P>
<P N="5">5. And having no knowledge, we can have no love of God: we cannot love him we know not. Mo&s;t men <HI>talk</HI> indeed of loving God, and per|haps imagine they do. At lea&s;t, few will ac|knowledge they do not love him: but the fact is too plain to be denied. No man loves God by nature, no more than does a &s;tone, or the earth he treads upon. What we love, we delight in: But no man has naturally any delight in God. In our natural &s;tate, we cannot conceive, how any one &s;hould delight in him. We take no plea|&s;ure in him at all: he is utterly ta&s;tele&s;s to us. To love God! It is far above, out of our &s;ight. We cannot naturally attain unto it.</P>
<P N="6">6. We have by nature not only no love, but no fear of God. It is allowed indeed, that mo&s;t men have, &s;ooner or later, a kind of &s;en&s;ele&s;s, ir|rational fear, properly called <HI>&s;uper&s;tition,</HI> though the blundering <HI>Epicureans</HI> gave it the name of <HI>re|ligion.</HI> Yet even this is not natural, but acquir|ed;
<PB N="237" REF="039068_0231_101395193042EF48">chiefly by conver&s;ation, or from example. By nature, <HI>God is not in all our thoughts:</HI> we leave him to manage his own affairs, to &s;it quietly, as we imagine, in heaven, and leave us on earth to manage ours. So that we have no more of the fear of God before our eyes, than of the love of God in our hearts.</P>
<P N="7">7. Thus are all men <HI>athei&s;ts in the world.</HI> But athei&s;m it&s;elf does not &s;creen us from <HI>idolatry.</HI> In his natural &s;tate, every man born into the world is a rank idolater. Perhaps indeed we may not be &s;uch in the vulgar &s;en&s;e of the word. We do not, like the idolatrous heathens, wor&s;hip molten or graved images. We do not bow down to the &s;tock of a tree, to the work of our own hands. We do not pray to the angels or &s;aints in heaven, any more than to the &s;aints that are upon earth. But what then? We <HI>have &s;et up</HI> our <HI>idols in</HI> our <HI>hearts;</HI> and to the&s;e we bow down, and wor&s;hip them: we wor&s;hip our&s;elves, when we pay that honour to our&s;elves, which is due to God only. Therefore all <HI>pride</HI> is idolatry: it is a&s;|cribing to our&s;elves, what is due to God alone. And although pride was not made for man, yet where is the man that is born without it? But hereby we rob God of his unalienable right, and idolatrou&s;ly u&s;urp his glory.</P>
<P N="8">8. But pride is not the only &s;ort of idolatry, which we are all by nature guilty of. Satan has &s;tamped his own image on our heart in <HI>&s;elf-will</HI> al&s;o. <HI>I will,</HI> &s;aid he, before he was ca&s;t out of heaven, <HI>I will &s;it upon the &s;ides of the north.</HI> I will do my own will and plea&s;ure, independently on that of my Creator. the &s;ame does every man born in the world &s;ay, and that in a thou&s;and in|&s;tances.
<PB N="238" REF="039068_0232_1013951CA0C7F7C0">Nay, and avow it too, without ever blu&s;hing upon the account, without either fear or &s;hame. A&s;k the man, "Why did you do this?" He an&s;wers, "Becau&s;e I had a mind to it." What is this but, "Becau&s;e it is my will;" that is in effect, "Becau&s;e the devil and I are agreed: becau&s;e &s;atan and I govern our actions, by one and the &s;ame principle." The will of God, mean time, is not in his thoughts, is not con&s;idered in the lea&s;t degree; although it be the &s;upreme rule of every intelligent creature, whe|ther in heaven or earth, re&s;ulting from the e&s;&s;en|tial, unalterable relation, which all creatures bear to their Creator.</P>
<P N="9">9. So far we bear the image of the devil, and tread in his &s;teps. But at the next &s;tep we leave &s;atan behind; we run into an idolatry, whereof he is not guilty: I mean, <HI>love of the world,</HI> which is now as natural to every man, as to love his own will. What is more natural to us, than to &s;eek happine&s;s in the creature, in&s;tead of the Creator? To &s;eek that &s;atisfaction in the works of his hands, which can be found in God only? What more natural, than the de&s;ire of the fle&s;h; that is, of the plea&s;ure of &s;en&s;e in every kind? Men indeed talk magnificently of de&s;pi&s;ing the&s;e low plea&s;ures, particularly men of learning and education. They affect to &s;it loo&s;e to the grati|fication of tho&s;e appetites, wherein they &s;tand on a level with the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h. But it is mere affectation; for every man is con&s;cious to him&s;elf, that in this re&s;pect he is by nature a ve|ry bea&s;t. Sen&s;ual appetites, even tho&s;e of the lowe&s;t kind, have, more or le&s;s, the do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="7 letters"> over him. They lead him captive; they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="239" REF="039068_0233_1013951F12087098">him to and fro, in &s;pite of his boa&s;ted rea&s;on. The man, with all his good breeding and other accompli&s;hments, has no pre-eminence over the goat. Nay, it is much to be doubted, whether the bea&s;t has not the pre-eminence over him. Certainly he has, if we may hearken to one of the&s;e modern oracles, who very decently tells us,
<Q><L>"Once in a &s;ea&s;on, bea&s;ts too ta&s;te of love:</L>
<L>"Only the bea&s;t of rea&s;on is it's &s;lave,</L>
<L>"And in that folly drudges all the year."</L></Q>
A con&s;iderable difference indeed, it mu&s;t be al|lowed, there is between man and man, ari&s;ing (be&s;ide that wrought by preventing grace) from difference of con&s;titution, and of education. But notwith&s;tanding this, who, that is not utterly ignorant of him&s;elf, can here ca&s;t the fir&s;t &s;tone at another? Who can abide the te&s;t of our ble&s;|&s;ed Lord's comment on the &s;eventh command|ment, "He that looketh on a woman to lu&s;t after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart?" So that one knows not which to wonder at mo&s;t, the ignorance or the in&s;olence of tho&s;e men, who, &s;peak with &s;uch di&s;dain of them, that are overcome by de&s;ires, which every man has felt in his own brea&s;t; the de&s;ire of every plea&s;ure of &s;en&s;e, innocent or not, being natural to every child of man.</P>
<P N="10">10. And &s;o is <HI>the de&s;ire of the eye,</HI> the de&s;ire of the plea&s;ures of the imagination. The&s;e ari&s;e either from great, or beautiful, or uncommon objects, if the two former do not coincide with the latter; for perhaps it would appear upon a di|ligent enquiry, that neither <HI>grand</HI> nor <HI>beautiful</HI> ob|jects
<PB N="240" REF="039068_0234_10139521CABE88B8">plea&s;e, any longer than they are <HI>new;</HI> that when the novelty of them is over, the greate&s;t part, at lea&s;t, of the plea&s;ures they give is over; and in the &s;ame proportion as they become fami|liar, they become flat and in&s;ipid. But let us experience this ever &s;o often, the &s;ame de&s;ire will remain &s;till. The inbred thir&s;t continues fixt in the &s;oul: nay, the more it is indulged, the more it increa&s;es, and incites us to follow after another, and yet another object; although we leave every one with an abortive hope, and deluded expecta|tion. Yea,

<L>"The hoary fool, who many days</L>

</LG></Q></P>
<P N="11">11. A third &s;ymptom of this fatal di&s;ea&s;e, the love of the world, which is &s;o deeply rooted in our nature is, <HI>the pride of life,</HI> the de&s;ire of prai&s;e, of <HI>the honour that cometh of men.</HI> This the greate&s;t admirers of human nature allow to be &s;trictly na|tural; as natural as the &s;ight of hearing, or any other of the external &s;en&s;es. And are they a&s;ham|ed of it, even men of letters, men of refined and improved under&s;tanding? So far from it, that they glory therein; they applaud them&s;elves for their love of applau&s;e! Yea, eminent <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> &s;o called, make no difficulty of adopting the &s;aying of
<PB N="241" REF="039068_0235_101395236B1E2988">the old, vain heathen, <HI>Animi di&s;&s;oluti e&s;t &amp; nequam, negligere quid de &s;e homines &s;entiant:</HI> "Not to regard what men think of us, is the mark of a wicked and abandoned mind." So that to go calm and unmoved thro' <HI>honour and di&s;honour,</HI> thro' <HI>evil re|port and good report,</HI> is with them a &s;ign of one that is indeed <HI>not fit to live; away with &s;uch a fellow from the earth.</HI> But would one imagine, that the&s;e men had ever heard of Je&s;us Chri&s;t or his Apo&s;tles? Or that they knew who it was that &s;aid, "How can ye believe, who receive honour one of another, and &s;eek not that honour which cometh of God only?" But if this be really &s;o; if it be impo&s;&s;ible to believe, and con&s;equently to plea&s;e God, &s;o long as we <HI>receive</HI> or "&s;eek honour one of another and &s;eek not the honour which cometh of God only:" then in what a condition are all mankind! The chri&s;tians as well as the heathens! Since they all <HI>&s;eek honour one of another!</HI> Since it is as natu|ral for them &s;o to do, them&s;elves being the judg|es, as it is to &s;ee the light which &s;trikes upon their eye, or to hear the &s;ound which enters their ear: yea, &s;ince they account it the &s;ign of a virtuous mind, to &s;eek the prai&s;e of men; and of a vici|ous one, to be content with "the honour which cometh of God only!"</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. I proceed to draw a few inferences from what has been &s;aid. And, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> From hence we may learn one grand, fundamental difference between chri&s;tianity, con&s;idered as a &s;y&s;tem of doctrines, and the mo&s;t refined heatheni&s;m. Ma|ny of the ancient heathens have largely de&s;cribed the vices of particular men. They have &s;poken much again&s;t their covetou&s;ne&s;s and cruelty, their
<PB N="242" REF="039068_0236_10139525EEE48FF8">luxury or prodigality. Some have dared to &s;ay, that "no man is born without vices of one kind or another." But &s;till, as none of them were ap|prized of the fall of man, &s;o none of them knew his total corruption. They knew not that all men were empty of all good, and filled with all man|ner of evil. They were wholly ignorant of the entire depravation of the whole human nature, of every man born into the world, in every faculty of his &s;oul, not &s;o much by tho&s;e particular vices, which reign in particular per&s;ons, as by the ge|neral flood of athei&s;m and idolatry, of pride, &s;elf-will and love of the world. This therefore, is the fir&s;t, grand, di&s;tingui&s;hing point between heathen|i&s;m and chri&s;tianity. The one acknowledges that many men are in&s;ected with many vices, and even born with a pronene&s;s to them; but &s;uppo&s;e withal, that in &s;ome the natural good much overbalan|ces the evil. The other declares that all men are <HI>conceived in &s;in,</HI> and <HI>&s;hapen in wickedne&s;s:</HI> that hence there is in every man a "carnal mind which is enmity again&s;t God, which is not, cannot be &s;ubject to his law," and which &s;o infects the whole &s;oul, that <HI>there dwelleth</HI> in him, <HI>in his fle&s;h,</HI> in his natural &s;tate, <HI>no good thing;</HI> but "all the imagination of the thoughts of his heart," is <HI>evil,</HI> only <HI>evil,</HI> and that <HI>continually.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Hence we may, <HI>Secondly,</HI> learn, That all who deny this, call it <HI>Original Sin,</HI> or by any other title, are but heathens &s;till, in the fundamental point which differences heatheni&s;m, from chri&s;ti|anity. They may indeed allow, that men have many vices: that they are born with us: and that con&s;equently we are not born altogether &s;o wi&s;e or &s;o virtuous, as we &s;hould be: there being few
<PB N="243" REF="039068_0237_10139529B2B8FC40">that will roundly affirm, "We are born with as much propen&s;ity to good as to evil, and that every man is by nature as virtuous and wi&s;e, as Adam was at his creation." But here is the Shibboleth: is man, by nature &s;illed with all manner of evil? Is he void of all good? is he wholly fallen? Is his &s;oul totally corrupted? Or, to come back to the text, is "every imagination of the thoughts of his heart evil continually?" Allow this, and you are &s;o far a chri&s;tian. Deny it, and you are but a heathen &s;till.</P>
<P N="3">3. We may learn from hence, in the <HI>Third</HI> place, What is the proper nature of religion, of the re|ligion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. It is
<GAP DESC="foreign">. God's method of healing a &s;oul which is <HI>thus di&s;ea&s;ed.</HI> Hereby the great phy&s;ician of &s;ouls applies medi|cine to heal <HI>this &s;ickne&s;s;</HI> to re&s;tore human nature, totally corrupted in all its faculties. God heals our athei&s;m by the knowledge of him&s;elf, and of Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom he hath &s;ent, by giving us faith, a divine evidence and conviction of God, and of the things of God, in particular of this im|portant truth, Chri&s;t loved <HI>me,</HI> and gave him&s;elf for <HI>me.</HI> By repentance and lowline&s;s of heart, the deadly di&s;ea&s;e of pride is healed; that of &s;elf-will by re&s;ignation, a meek and thankful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of God. And for the love of the world in all its branches, the love of God is the &s;ove|reign remedy. Now this is properly religion, <HI>faith</HI> thus <HI>working by love,</HI> working the genuine, meek humility, entire deadne&s;s to the world, with a loving, thankful acquie&s;cence in and conformity to the whole will of God.</P>
<P N="4">4. Indeed if man were not thus fallen; there would be no need of all this. There would be
<PB N="244" REF="039068_0238_1013952B3898DC70">no occa&s;ion for this work in the heart, this renew|al in the &s;pirit of our mind." The <HI>&s;uperfluity of godline&s;s</HI> would then be a more proper expre&s;&s;ion than the <HI>&s;uperfluity of naughtine&s;s.</HI> For an out&s;ide religion without any godline&s;s at all, would &s;uffice to all rational intents and purpo&s;es. It does ac|cordingly &s;uffice, in the judgment of tho&s;e who deny this corruption of our nature. They make very little more of religion, than the famous Mr. <HI>Hobbes</HI> did of rea&s;on. Accordingly to him, rea|&s;on is only, "A well ordered train of words:" according to them, religion is only a well-order|ed train of words and actions. And they &s;peak con&s;i&s;tently with them&s;elves: for if the in&s;ide be not <HI>full of wickedne&s;s,</HI> if this be clean already, what remains, but to <HI>clean&s;e the out&s;ide of the cup?</HI> Outward reformations, if their &s;uppo&s;ition be ju&s;t, is indeed the one thing needful.</P>
<P N="5">5. But ye have not &s;o learned the oracles of God. Ye know, that he who &s;eeth what is in man gives a far different account both of nature and grace, of our fall and our recovery. Ye know that the great end of religion is, to renew our hearts in the image of God, to repair that total lo&s;s of righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s, which we &s;u&s;tained by the &s;in of our fir&s;t parent. Ye know that all religion which does not an&s;wer this end, all that &s;tops &s;hort of this, the renewal of our foul in the image of God, after the like|ne&s;s of him that created it, is no other than a poor farce, and a mere mockery of God, to the de&s;|truction of our own &s;oul. O beware of all tho&s;e teachers of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, who would palm this upon you for chri&s;tianity; regard them not, though they &s;hould come upon you with all <HI>the deceivablene&s;s

Keep to the plain old <HI>faith, once delivered to the &s;aints,</HI> and delivered by the Spirit of God to your hearts. Know your di&s;ea&s;e! Know your cure! Ye were born in &s;in: therefore <HI>ye mu&s;t be born again,</HI> born of God. By nature ye are wholly corrupted: by grace ye &s;hall be wholly renewed. "In Adam ye all died:" In the &s;econd Adam, "in Chri&s;t ye all are made alive." You <HI>that are dead in &s;ins hath he quickened:</HI> he hath already given you a princi|ple of life, even "faith in him who loved" you, <HI>and gave him&s;elf for you!</HI> Now go on from <HI>faith to faith,</HI> until your whole &s;ickne&s;s be healed, and all that "mind be in you which was al&s;o in Chri&s;t Je&s;us!"</P>

<P N="1">1. IF any doctrines within the whole compa&s;s of chri&s;tianity may be properly termed fundamental, they are doubtle&s;s the&s;e two, the doctrine of ju&s;tification, and that of the new birth: the former relating to that great work, which God does <HI>for us,</HI> in forgiving our &s;ins; the latter, to the great work, which God does <HI>in us</HI> in renewing our fallen nature. In order of time, neither of the&s;e is before the other: in the moment we are ju&s;tified by the grace of God, through the redemption that is in Je&s;us, we are al&s;o <HI>born of the Spirit:</HI> but in order of thinking, as it is termed, ju&s;tification precedes the new birth. We fir&s;t conceive his wrath to be turned away, and then his Spirit to work in our hearts.</P>
<P N="2">2. How great importance then mu&s;t it be of to every child of man, throughly to under&s;tand the&s;e fundamental doctrines? From a full conviction of this, many excellent men have wrote very largely concerning ju&s;tification, explaining every point relating thereto, and opening the &s;criptures which treat upon it. Many likewi&s;e have wrote on the new birth: and &s;ome of them largely enough: but yet not &s;o clearly as might have been defired; nor &s;o deeply and accurately: having either given a dark, ab&s;tru&s;e account of it, or a &s;light and &s;u|perficial one. Therefore a full, and at the &s;ame
<PB N="247" REF="039068_0241_10139533240C1A88">time, a clear account of the new birth &s;eems to be wanting &s;till: &s;uch as may enable us to give a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to the&s;e three que&s;tions, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Why mu&s;t we be born again? What is the foun|dation of this doctrine of the new birth? <HI>Secondly,</HI> How mu&s;t we be born again? What is the nature of the new birth? And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> wherefore mu&s;t we be born again? To what end is it nece&s;&s;ary? The&s;e que&s;tions, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God, I &s;hall briefly and plainly an&s;wer, and then &s;ubjoin a few in&s;tances which will naturally follow.</P>
<P N="1">I. 1. And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> why mu&s;t we be born again? What is the foundation of this doctrine? The foundation of it lies near as deep as the creation of the world: in the &s;criptural account whereof we read,
<NOTE PLACE="foot">* <HI>Gen.</HI> i. 26, 27.</NOTE> <HI>And</HI> God, the three-one God, <HI>&s;aid, Let us make man in our image, after our likene&s;s. So</HI> God <HI>created man in his own image, in the image of</HI> God <HI>created he him:</HI> not barely in his <HI>natural image,</HI> a picture of his own immortality, a &s;piri|tual being, endued with under&s;tanding, freedom of will, and various affections: nor merely in his <HI>political image,</HI> the governor of this lower world, having <HI>dominion ever the fi&s;hes of the &s;ea, and ever all the earth:</HI> but chiefly in his <HI>moral image?</HI> which according to the apo&s;tle, is
<NOTE PLACE="foot">&dagger; <HI>Eph.</HI> iv. 24.</NOTE> <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s.</HI> In this image of God was man made. God <HI>is love:</HI> accordingly man at his crea|tion was full of love: which was the &s;ole princi|ple of all his tempers, thoughts, words and ac|tions. God is full of ju&s;tice, mercy and truth: &s;o was man as he came from the hands of his Creator. God is &s;potle&s;s purity: and &s;o man
<PB N="248" REF="039068_0242_10139536877A5650">was in the beginning pure from every &s;inful blot. Otherwi&s;e God could not have pronounced <HI>him,</HI> as well as all the other works of his hands,
<NOTE PLACE="foot">&sect; <HI>Gen.</HI> i. 31.</NOTE> <HI>very good.</HI> This he could not have been, had he not been pure from &s;in, and filled with righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s. For there is no medi|um: if we &s;uppo&s;e an intelligent creature, not to love God, not to be righteous and holy, we ne|ce&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;e him not to be good at all: much le&s;s to be <HI>very good.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. But although man was made in the image of God, yet he was not made immutable. This would have been incon&s;i&s;tent with that &s;tate of trial, in which God was plea&s;ed to place him. He was therefore created able to &s;tand, and yet liable to fall. And this God him&s;elf apprized him of, and gave him a &s;olemn warning again&s;t it. Neverthele&s;s <HI>man</HI> did <HI>not abide in honour:</HI> he fell from his high e&s;tate. He <HI>ate of the tree whereof the</HI> Lord <HI>had commanded him, thou &s;halt not eat thereof.</HI> By this wilful act of di&s;obedience to his Creator, this flat rebellion again&s;t his &s;overeign, he openly declared, that he would no longer have God to rule over him: that he would be governed by his own will, and not the will of him that created him, and that he would not &s;eek his hap|pine&s;s in God, but in the world, in the works of his hands. Now God had told him before, <HI>In the day that thou eate&s;t</HI> of that fruit <HI>thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</HI> And the word of the Lord cannot be broken. Accordingly in that day he did die: he died to God, the mo&s;t dreadful of all deaths. He lo&s;t the life of God: he was &s;eparated from him, in union with whom his &s;piritual life con|&s;i&s;ted.
<PB N="249" REF="039068_0243_101395380D42DA08">The body dies, when it is &s;eparated from the &s;oul; the &s;oul, when it is &s;eparated from God. But this &s;eparation from God, Adam &s;u&s;tained in the day, the hour he are of the forbidden fruit. And of this he gave immediate proof; pre&s;ently &s;hewing by his behaviour, that the love of God was extingui&s;hed in his &s;oul, which was now <HI>alie|nated from the life of</HI> God. In&s;tead of this, he was now under the power of &s;ervile fear, &s;o that he fled from the pre&s;ence of the Lord. Yea, &s;o little did he retain even of the knowledge of him, who filleth heaven and earth, that he endeavour|ed to
<NOTE PLACE="foot">* <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 8.</NOTE> <HI>hide him&s;elf from the</HI> Lord God, <HI>among the trees of the garden.</HI> So had he lo&s;t both the know|ledge and the love of God, without which the image of God could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t. Of this there|fore he was deprived at the &s;ame time, and be|came unholy as well as unhappy. In the room of this, he had &s;unk into pride and &s;elf-will, the very image of the devil, and into &s;en&s;ual appetites and de&s;ires, the image of the bea&s;t, that peri&s;h.</P>
<P N="3">3. If it be &s;aid, "Nay but that threatening, <HI>In the day that thou eate&s;t thereof thou &s;hall &s;urely die,</HI> refers to temporal death and that alone, to the death of the body only;" the an&s;wer is plain; to affirm this, is flatly and palpably to make God a liar: to aver that the God of truth po&s;itively affirmed a thing contrary to truth. For it is evident, Adam did not <HI>die</HI> in this &s;en&s;e, <HI>in the day that he ate thereof.</HI> He lived in the &s;en&s;e oppo&s;ite to this death, above nine hundred years after. So that this cannot po&s;&s;ibly be under&s;tood of the death of the body, without impeaching the ve|racity
<PB N="250" REF="039068_0244_1013953AD19B7628">of God. It mu&s;t therefore be under&s;tood of &s;piritual death, the lo&s;s of the life and image of God.</P>
<P N="4">4. And <HI>in</HI> Adam <HI>all died,</HI> all human-kind, all the children of men who were then in Adam's loins. The natural con&s;equence of this is, that every one de&s;cended from him, comes into the world &s;piritually dead, dead to God, wholly <HI>dead in &s;in:</HI> entirely void of the life of God, void of the image of God, of all that <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s and ho|line&s;s,</HI> wherein Adam was created. In&s;tead of this, every man born into the world, now bears the image of the devil, in pride and &s;elf-will; the image of the bea&s;t, in &s;en&s;ual appetites and de|fires. This then is the foundation of the new birth, the entire corruption of our nature. Hence it is, that being <HI>born in &s;in,</HI> we mu&s;t be <HI>born again.</HI> Hence every one that is born of a woman, mu&s;t be born of the Spirit of God.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. But how mu&s;t a man be born again? What is the nature of the new birth? This is the <HI>&s;econd</HI> que&s;tion. And a que&s;tion it is, of the highe&s;t moment that can be conceived. We ought not therefore in &s;o weighty a concern, to be con|tent with a &s;light enquiry; but to examine it with all po&s;&s;ible care, and to ponder it in our hearts, till we fully under&s;tand this important point, and clearly &s;ee, how we are to be born again.</P>
<P N="2">2. Not that we are to expect any minute, phi|lo&s;ophical account of the <HI>manner how</HI> this is done. Our Lord &s;ufficiently guards us again&s;t any &s;uch expectation, by the words immediately following the text: wherein he reminds Nicodemus of as indi&s;putable a fact, as any in the whole compa&s;s of nature: which notwith&s;tanding the wi&s;e&s;t man
<PB N="251" REF="039068_0245_1013953D4EE79128">under the &s;un is not able fully to explain. <HI>The wind bloweth where it li&s;teth,</HI> not by thy power or wi&s;dom, <HI>and thou heare&s;t the &s;ound thereof:</HI> thou art ab&s;olutely a&s;&s;ured, beyond all doubt, that it doth blow. <HI>But thou can&s;t not tell whence it cometh, neither whither it goeth.</HI> The preci&s;e manner how it begins and ends, ri&s;es and falls, no man can tell. <HI>So is every one that is born of the Spirit.</HI> Thou maye&s;t be as ab&s;olutely a&s;&s;ured of the fact, as of the blowing of the wind: but the preci&s;e manner how it is done, how the Holy Spirit works this in the &s;oul, neither thou nor the wi&s;e&s;t of the children of men is able to explain.</P>
<P N="3">3. However it &s;uffices for every rational and chri&s;tian purpo&s;e, that without de&s;cending into curious, critical enquiries, we can give a plain &s;criptural account of the nature of the new birth. This will &s;atisfy every rea&s;onable man, who de|&s;ires only the &s;alvation of his &s;oul. The expre&s;&s;i|on, being <HI>born again,</HI> was not fir&s;t u&s;ed by our Lord in his conver&s;ation with Nicodemus. It was well known before that time, and was in common u&s;e among the Jews, when our Saviour appeared among them. When an adult heathen was con|vinced, that the jewi&s;h religion was of God, and de&s;ired to join therein, it was the cu&s;tom to baptize him fir&s;t, before he was admitted to cir|cumci&s;ion. And when he was baptized, he was &s;aid to be <HI>born again:</HI> by which they meant, that he who was before a child of the devil, was now adopted in the family of God, and accounted one of his children. This expre&s;&s;ion, therefore, which Nicodemus being <HI>a teacher in I&s;rael,</HI> ought to have under&s;tood well, our Lord u&s;es in conver|&s;ing with him: only in a &s;tronger &s;en&s;e than he was accu&s;tomed to. And this might be the rea|&s;on
<PB N="252" REF="039068_0246_1013953FCB4FCC38">of his a&s;king, <HI>how can the&s;e things be&punc;</HI> They cannot be literally <HI>A man</HI> cannot <HI>enter a &s;econd time into his mother's womb and be born.</HI> But they may, &s;piritually. A man may be <HI>born from above, born of</HI> God, <HI>born of the Spirit:</HI> in a manner which bears a very near analogy to the natural birth.</P>
<P N="4">4. Before a child is born into the world, he hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> eyes, but &s;ees not: he has ears, but does not hear. He has a very imperfect u&s;e of any other &s;en&s;e. He has no knowledge of any of the things of the world, or any natural under&s;tanding. To that manner of exi&s;tence which he then has, we do not even give the name of life. It is then on|ly when a man is born, that we &s;ay he begins to live. For as &s;oon as he is born, he begins to &s;ee the light, and the various objects with which he is encompa&s;&s;ed. His ears are then opened, and he hears the &s;ounds which &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;trike upon them. At the &s;ame time all the other organs of &s;en&s;e begin to be exerci&s;ed upon their proper ob|jects. He likewi&s;e breathes and lives in a man|ner wholly different from what he did before. How exactly doth the parallel hold, in all the&s;e in&s;tances? While a man is in a mere natural &s;tate, before he is born of God, he has, in a &s;pi|ritual &s;en&s;e, eyes and &s;ees not; a thick impene|ble veil lies upon them. He has ears, but hears not; he is utterly deaf to what he is mo&s;t of all concerned to hear. His other &s;piritual &s;en&s;es are all locked up; he is in the &s;ame condition as it he had them not. Hence he has no knowledge of God, no intercour&s;e with him; he is not at all acquainted with him. He has no true know|ledge of the things of God, either of &s;piritual or eternal things. Therefore though he is a living man, he is a dead chri&s;tian. But as &s;oon as he is
<PB N="253" REF="039068_0247_101395423A70D4A8">born of God, there is a total change in all the&s;e particulars. The <HI>eyes of</HI> his <HI>under&s;tanding are opened</HI> (&s;uch is the language of the great apo&s;tle:) and he, who of old <HI>commanded light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, &s;hining on his heart,</HI> he &s;ees <HI>the light of the glory of</HI> God, his glorious love, <HI>in the face of</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t. His ears being opened, he is now capable of hear|ing the inward voice of God, &s;aying, <HI>be of good cheer thy &s;ins are forgiven thee: go and &s;in no more.</HI> This is the purport of what God &s;peaks to his heart: al|though perhaps not in the&s;e very words. He is now ready to hear what&s;oever <HI>he that teacheth man knowledge</HI> is plea&s;ed from time to time to reveal to him. He "feels in his heart (to u&s;e the language of our church) the mighty working of the Spirit of God:" not in a gro&s;s, carnal &s;en&s;e, as the men of the world &s;tupidly and wilfully mi&s;under&s;tand the expre&s;&s;ion: though they have been told again and again, we mean thereby neither more nor le&s;s than this: he feels, is inwardly &s;en&s;ible of the graces, which the Spirit of God works in his heart. He feels he is con&s;cious of a <HI>peace which pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding.</HI> He many times feels &s;uch a joy in God, as is <HI>un&s;peakable and full of glory.</HI> He feels <HI>the love of</HI> God <HI>&s;hed abroad in his heart by the Holy Gho&s;t which is given unto him.</HI> And all his &s;piritual &s;en&s;es are then <HI>exerci&s;ed to di&s;cern</HI> &s;pirit|ual <HI>good and evil.</HI> By the u&s;e of the&s;e he is daily increa&s;ing in the knowledge of God, of Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom he hath &s;ent, and of all the things pertaining to his inward kingdom. And now he may be properly &s;aid <HI>to live:</HI> God having quick|ened him by his Spirit, he is alive to God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. He lives a life which the world knoweth not of, a <HI>life</HI> which <HI>is hid with</HI> Chri&s;t
<PB N="254" REF="039068_0248_10139543CA105EC8"><HI>in</HI> God. God is continually breathing, as it were, upon the &s;oul, and his &s;oul is breathing unto God. Grace is de&s;cending into his heart, and prayer and prai&s;e a&s;cending to heaven. And by this intercour&s;e between God and man, this fel|low&s;hip with the Father and the Son, as by a kind of &s;piritual re&s;piration, the life of God in the &s;oul is &s;u&s;tained: and the child of God grows up till he comes to <HI>the full mea&s;ure of the &s;tature of</HI> Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="5">5. From hence it manife&s;tly appears, what is the nature of the new birth. It is that great change which God works in the &s;oul, when he brings it into life; when he rai&s;es it from the death of &s;in, to the life of righteou&s;ne&s;s. It is the change wrought in the whole &s;oul by the Almigh|ty Spirit of God, when it is <HI>created anew in</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us, when it is <HI>renewed after the image of</HI> God, <HI>in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s:</HI> when the love of the world is changed into the love of God, pride into humility, pa&s;&s;ion into meekne&s;s; hatred, envy, malice, into a &s;incere, tender, di&s;intere&s;ted love for all mankind. In a word, it is that change whereby the <HI>earthly, &s;en&s;ual, devili&s;h</HI> mind is turn|ed into the <HI>mind which was in</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us. This is the nature of the new birth. "So is every one that is born of the Spirit."</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. It is not difficult for any who has con|&s;idered the&s;e things, to &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of the new birth, and to an&s;wer the <HI>third</HI> que&s;tion. Wherefore, to what end is it nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould be born again? It is very ea&s;ily di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ed, that this is nece&s;&s;ary, fir&s;t, in order to holi&s;hne&s;s. For what is holine&s;s, according to the oracles of God? Not a bare external religion, a round of
<PB N="255" REF="039068_0249_1013954759BDAD08">outward duties, how many &s;oever they be, and how exactly &s;oever performed. No: go&s;pel-holi|ne&s;s is no le&s;s than the image of God &s;tamped upon the heart. It is no other than the whole mind which was in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. It con&s;i&s;ts of all heavenly affections and tempers mingled together in one. It implies &s;uch a continual, thankful love, to him who hath not with-held from us his Son, his only Son, as makes it natural and in a man|ner nece&s;&s;ary to us, to love every child of man; as fills us with <HI>bowels of mercies, kindne&s;s, gentle|ne&s;s, long-&s;uffering.</HI> It is &s;uch a love of God as teaches us to be blamele&s;s in all manner of con|ver&s;ation; as enables us to pre&s;ent our &s;ouls and bodies, all we are, and all we have, all our thoughts, words and actions, a continual &s;acrifice to God, acceptable through Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Now this holine&s;s can have no exi&s;tence, till we are renewed in the image of our mind. It cannot commence in the &s;oul, till that change be wrought, till by the power of the highe&s;t over&s;hadowing us we are "brought from darkne&s;s to light, from the power of &s;atan unto God:" that is, till we are born again: which therefore is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in order to holine&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. But <HI>without holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the</HI> Lord, &s;hall &s;ee the face of God in glory. Of con&s;e|quence the new birth is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, in order to eternal &s;alvation. Men may indeed flat|ter them&s;elves (&s;o de&s;perately wicked and &s;o de|ceitful is the heart of man!) that they may live in their &s;ins till they come to the la&s;t ga&s;p, and yet afterwards live with God. And thou&s;ands do really believe, that they have found a <HI>broad way which leadeth</HI> not <HI>to de&s;truction.</HI> What danger, &s;ay they, can a woman be in, that is &s;o <HI>harmle&s;s</HI> and
<PB N="256" REF="039068_0250_10139549D345C6E0">&s;o <HI>virtuous?</HI> What fear is there that &s;o <HI>hone&s;t</HI> a man, one of &s;o &s;trict <HI>morality,</HI> &s;hould mi&s;s of hea|ven? E&s;pecially, if over and above all this, they con&s;tantly attend on church and &s;acrament. One of the&s;e will a&s;k with all a&s;&s;urance, "What, &s;hall not I do as well as my neighbours?" Yes, as well as your unholy neighbours; as well as you neigh|bours that die in their &s;ins. For you will all drop into the pit together, into the nethermo&s;t hell. You will all lie together in the lake of fire, <HI>the lake of fire burning with brim&s;tone.</HI> Then, at length you will &s;ee (but God grant you may &s;ee it be|fore!) the nece&s;&s;ity of holine&s;s in order to glory: and con&s;equently, of the new birth, &s;ince none can be holy, except he be born again.</P>
<P N="3">3. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, except he be born again, none can be happy even in this world. For it is not po&s;&s;ible, in the nature of things, that a man &s;hould be happy, who is not holy. Even the poor, ungodly poet could tell us,
<Q><HI>Nemo malus felix:</HI></Q>
No wicked man is happy. The rea&s;on is plain. All unholy tempers are unea&s;y tempers. Not only malice, hatred, envy, jealou&s;y, revenge, create a pre&s;ent hell in the brea&s;t, but even the &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ions, if not kept within due bounds give a thou&s;and times more pain than plea&s;ure. Even <HI>hope,</HI> when <HI>defered</HI> (and how often mu&s;t this be the ca&s;e?) <HI>maketh the heart &s;ick.</HI> And every de&s;ire, which is not according to the will of God, is li|able to <HI>pierce us through with many forrows.</HI> And all tho&s;e general &s;ources of &s;in, pride, &s;elf-will and idolatry, are in the &s;ame proportion as they prevail, general &s;ources of mi&s;ery. Therefore as long as the&s;e reign in any &s;oul, happine&s;s has no
<PB N="257" REF="039068_0251_1013954C48D7EE68">place there. But they mu&s;t reign till the bent of our nature is changed, that is, 'till we are born again. Con&s;equently the new birth is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in order to happine&s;s in this world, as well as in the world to come.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I propo&s;ed in the la&s;t place, to &s;ubjoin a few inferences which naturally follow from the preceding ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P N="1">1. And, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It follows, that bapti&s;m is not the new birth: they are not one and the &s;ame thing. Many indeed &s;eem to imagine, they are ju&s;t the &s;ame: at lea&s;t, they &s;peak as if they thought &s;o: but I do not know, that this opinion is pub|lickly avowed, by any denomination of chri&s;tians whatever. Certainly it is not, by any within the&s;e kingdoms, whether of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, or di&s;&s;enting from it. The judgment of the latter is clearly declared, in their
<NOTE PLACE="foot">* <HI>Q.</HI> 163, 165.</NOTE> <HI>large catechi&s;m: Q:</HI> "What are the parts of a &s;acrament? <HI>A.</HI> The parts of a &s;acrament are two: the one, an out|ward and &s;en&s;ible &s;ign; the other an inward and &s;piritual grace thereby &s;ignified. <HI>Q.</HI> What is bap|ti&s;m? <HI>A.</HI> Bapti&s;m is a &s;acrament, wherein Chri&s;t hath ordained the wa&s;hing with water, to be a &s;ign and &s;eal of regeneration by his Spirit." Here it is manife&s;t, bapti&s;m, the &s;ign, is &s;poken of as di&s;tinct from regeneration, the thing &s;igni|fied.</P>
<P>In the church-catechi&s;m likewi&s;e, the judgment of our church is declared with the utmo&s;t clear|ne&s;s. "What meane&s;t thou by this word, &s;acra|ment? I mean an outward and vi&s;ible &s;ign of an
<PB N="258" REF="039068_0252_1013954E04684FA8">inward and &s;piritual grace. What is the outward part, or form in bapti&s;m? Water, wherein the per&s;on is baptized, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t. What is the inward part, or thing &s;ignified? A death unto &s;in, and a new birth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s." Nothing therefore is plainer, than that, according to the church of <HI>England,</HI> bapti&s;m is not the new birth.</P>
<P>But indeed the rea&s;on of the thing is &s;o clear and evident, as not to need any other authority. For what can be more plain, than that the one is an external, the other an internal work? That the one is a vi&s;ible, the other an invi&s;ible thing, and therefore wholly different from each other: the one being an act of man, purifying the bo|dy; the other, a change wrought by God in the &s;oul. So that the former is ju&s;t as di&s;tingui&s;ha|ble from the latter, as the &s;oul from the body, or water from the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. From the preceding reflections, we may, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> ob&s;erve, that as the new birth is not the &s;ame thing with bapti&s;m, &s;o it does not always accompany bapti&s;m: they do not con&s;tantly go together. A man may po&s;&s;ibly be <HI>born of water</HI> and yet not be <HI>born of the Spirit.</HI> There may &s;ome|times be the outward &s;ign, where there is not the inward grace. I do not now &s;peak with regard to infants: it is certain, our church &s;uppo&s;es, that all, who are baptized in their infancy, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at the &s;ame time born again. And it is allowed, that the whole office for the bapti&s;m of infants proceeds upon this &s;uppo&s;ition. Nor is it an ob|jection of any weight again&s;t this, that we can|not comprehend, how this work can be wrought in infants? For neither can we comprehend, how it is wrought in a per&s;on of riper years.
<PB N="259" REF="039068_0253_1013955161031878">But whatever be the ca&s;e with infants, it is &s;ure all of riper years, who are baptized, are not at the &s;ame time born again. <HI>The tree is known by it's fruits:</HI> and hereby it appears too plain to be denied, that divers of tho&s;e, who were children of the devil before they were baptized, continue the &s;ame after bapti&s;m; <HI>for the works of their father they do;</HI> they continue &s;ervants of &s;in, without any pretence either to inward or outward holi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. A third inference, which we may draw from what has been ob&s;erved, is, that the new birth is not the &s;ame with &s;anctification. This is indeed taken for granted by many; particu|larly by an eminent writer, on his late trea|ti&s;e on "the nature and grounds of chri&s;tian regeneration." To wave &s;everal other weighty objections, which might be made to that tract, this is a palpable one: it all along &s;peaks of re|generation as a progre&s;&s;ive work, carried on in the &s;oul by &s;low degrees, from the time of our fir&s;t turning to God. This is undeniably true of &s;anctification; but of regeneration, the new birth, it is not true. This is a part of &s;anctifi|cation, not the whole; it is the gate of it, the entrance into it. When we are born again, then our &s;anctification, our inward and outward holi|ne&s;s begins. And thenceforward we are gradu|ally to <HI>grow up in him, who is our head.</HI> This ex|pre&s;&s;ion of the apo&s;tle admirably illu&s;trates the difference between one and the other, and far|ther points out the exact analogy there is between natural and &s;piritual things. A child is born of a woman in a moment, or at lea&s;t in a very &s;hort time. Afterward he gradually and &s;lowly grows, till he attain to the &s;tature of a man. In like
<PB N="260" REF="039068_0254_10136DE6D7D31730">manner, a child is born of God in a &s;hort time, if not in a moment. But it is by &s;low degrees that he afterwards grows up to the mea&s;ure of the full &s;tature of Chri&s;t. The &s;ame relation there|fore, which there is between our natural birth and our growth, there is al&s;o between our new birth and our &s;anctification.</P>
<P N="4">4. One point more we may learn from the pre|ceding ob&s;ervations. But it is a point of &s;o great importance, as may excu&s;e the con&s;idering it the more carefully, and pro&s;ecuting it at &s;ome length. What mu&s;t one who loves the &s;ouls of men, and is grieved that any of them &s;hould peri&s;h, &s;ay to one whom he &s;ees living in &s;abbath-breaking, drunkenne&s;s, or any other wilful &s;in? What can he &s;ay, if the foregoing ob&s;ervations are true, but <HI>you mu&s;t be born again.</HI> "No, &s;ays a zealous man, that cannot be. How can you talk &s;o uncharitably to the man? Has he not been baptized already? He cannot be born again now." Can he not be born again? Do you affirm this? Then he cannot be &s;aved. Though he be as old as <HI>Nicodemus</HI> was, yet <HI>except he be born again, he cannot &s;ee the king|dom of God.</HI> Therefore in &s;aying, "he cannot be born again," you in effect deliver him over to damnation. And where lies the uncharitablene&s;s now? On my &s;ide, or on yours? I &s;ay, he may be born again, and &s;o become an heir of &s;alvation. You &s;ay, "he cannot be born again." And if &s;o, he mu&s;t inevitably peri&s;h. So you utterly block up his way to &s;alvation, and &s;end him to hell, out of mere charity!</P>
<P>But perhaps the &s;inner him&s;elf, to whom in real charity we &s;ay, "you mu&s;t be born again," has been taught to &s;ay, "I defy your new doctrine; I need not be born again. I was born again when
<PB N="261" REF="039068_0255_1013955646348FE0">I was bapti&s;ed. What! Would you have me deny my bapti&s;m?" I an&s;wer, fir&s;t, there is nothing under heaven which can excu&s;e a lie. Other|wi&s;e I &s;hould &s;ay to an open &s;inner, if you have been baptized, do not own it. For how highly does this aggravate your guilt? How will it in|crea&s;e your damnation? Was you devoted to God at eight days old, and have you been all the&s;e years devoting your&s;elf to the devil? Was you, even before you had the u&s;e of rea&s;on, con&s;ecrat|ed to God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t? And have you, ever &s;ince you had the u&s;e of it, been flying in the face of God, and con&s;e|crating your&s;elf to &s;atan? Does the abomination of de&s;olation, the love of the world, pride, anger, lu&s;t, fooli&s;h de&s;ire, and a whole train of vile af|fections &s;tand where it ought not? Have you &s;et up all the&s;e accur&s;ed things in that &s;oul, which was once a <HI>temple of the Holy Gho&s;t?</HI> Set apart for <HI>an habitation of God through the Spirit?</HI> Yea, &s;o|lemnly given up to him? And do you glory in this, that you once belonged to God? O be a&s;hamed! Blu&s;h! Hide your&s;elf in the earth! Never boa&s;t more of what ought to fill you with confu&s;ion, to make you a&s;hamed before God and man! I an&s;wer, &s;econdly, you have already denied your bapti&s;m; and that in the mo&s;t affec|tual manner. You have denied it a thou&s;and and a thou&s;and times; and you do &s;o &s;till day by day. For in your bapti&s;m, you renounced the devil and all his works. Whenever therefore you give place to him again, whenever you do any of the works of the devil, then you deny your bapti&s;m. There|fore you deny it by every wilful &s;in: by every act of uncleanne&s;s, drunkenne&s;s, or revenge; by every ob&s;cene or prophane word; by every oath
<PB N="262" REF="039068_0256_10139558EA22DD80">that comes out of your mouth. Every time you profane the day of the Lord, you thereby deny your bapti&s;m: yea, every time you do any thing to another, which you would not he &s;hould do to you. I an&s;wer, thirdly, be you baptized or unbaptized, you mu&s;t be born again. Other|wi&s;e it is not po&s;&s;ible you &s;hould be inwardly holy: and without inward as well as outward ho|line&s;s, you cannot be happy even in this world; much le&s;s in the world to come. Do you &s;ay, "Nay, but I do no harm to any man; I am ho|ne&s;t and ju&s;t in all my dealings; I do not cur&s;e, or take the Lord's name in vain; I do not pro|fane the Lord's day: I am no drunkard; I do not &s;lander my neighbour, nor live in any wilful &s;in." If this be &s;o, it were much to be wi&s;hed, that all men went as far as you do. But you mu&s;t go farther yet, or you cannot be &s;aved: &s;till you mu&s;t be born again. Do you add, "I do go farther yet; for I not only do no harm, but do all the good I can:" I doubt that fact: I fear you have had a thou&s;and opportunities of doing good, which you have &s;uffered to pa&s;s by unimproved, and for which therefore you are accountable to God. But if you had improved them all, if you really had done all the good you po&s;&s;ibly could to all men, yet this does not at all alter the ca&s;e: &s;till you mu&s;t be born again. Without this no|thing will do any good to your poor, &s;inful pol|luted &s;oul. "Nay, but I con&s;tantly attend all the ordinances of God: I keep to my church and &s;acrament." It is well you do. But all this will not keep you from hell, except you be born again. Go to church twice a day, go to the Lord's ta|ble every week, &s;ay ever &s;o many prayers in pri|vate, read ever &s;o many good books, &s;till you
<PB N="263" REF="039068_0257_1013955B6308C7D0">mu&s;t be born again: none of the&s;e things will &s;tand in the place of the new birth: no, nor any thing under heaven. Let this therefore, if you have not already experienced this inward work of God, be your continual prayer, "Lord, add this to all thy ble&s;&s;ings, let me be <HI>born again.</HI> Deny whatever thou plea&s;e&s;t, but deny not this, let me be <HI>born from above.</HI> Take away what&s;oever &s;eem|eth thee good, reputation, fortune, friends, health. Only give me this, to be <HI>born of the Spirit!</HI> To be received among the children of God. Let me be born, "not of corruptible &s;eed, but incorrup|tible, by the word of God, which liveth and abid|eth for ever." And then let me daily "grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Sa|viour Je&s;us Chri&s;t!"</P>
