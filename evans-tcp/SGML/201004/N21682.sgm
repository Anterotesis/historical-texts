<HEAD>The folly of practical athei&s;m.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>PSALM LIII. 1.</BIBL>
<P>The fool hath &s;aid in his heart, <HI>There is</HI> no God.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE folly of practical athei&s;m is the &s;ubject propo&s;ed for pre&s;ent con&s;ideration. The fool is not here &s;uppo&s;ed to deny the being of a God, con&s;idered as a <HI>&s;peculative</HI> truth, but as it relates to <HI>practice;</HI> or the idea of a God con&s;i|dered as moral Governor, to whom he mu&s;t give account. His practice declares the language of his heart to be this: <HI>No God: I would there were none.</HI> What influence his wi&s;h may po&s;&s;ibly have on his opinion, we &s;hall not tarry to enquire. It hath been much doubted, whether there ever was a &s;peculative athei&s;t. Be this as it may, the folly of another kind of athei&s;m is to be laid open in the en&s;uing di&s;cour&s;e. It is to be &s;hewn that the practical athei&s;t is a fool. His life declares the wi&s;h of his heart to be that expre&s;&s;ed in the text. He is thus de&s;cribed in the following part of the p&s;alm: <Q>Corrupt are they, and have done abom|inable iniquity. God looked down from hea|ven
<PB N="6" REF="028529_0004_0FD93531F2B41270">
upon the children of men, to &s;ee if there were any that did under&s;tand, that did &s;eek God. Every one of them is gone back, they are altogether become filthy: There is none that doth good, no not one.</Q> St. Paul applies the pa&s;&s;age to the body of the Jewi&s;h nation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Romans, iii. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">,&mdash;19.</NOTE></P>
<P>According to this de&s;cription of the athei&s;t, he either neglects the wor&s;hip of God, altho he may acknowledge his exi&s;tence: Or he lives vi|ciou&s;ly, altho he attends to the externals of religi|on: Or he u&s;eth religion as a cloke to his wick|ed de&s;igns. Let us examine each of the&s;e ca&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">1. To what end is the exi&s;tence of God ac|knowledged, if his wor&s;hip is neglected? To deny him our wor&s;hip, is to all intents to &s;ay, There is no God. What could a &s;peculative a|thei&s;t &s;ay or do more? <HI>He</HI> doth not call upon God, becau&s;e he maintains that no God exi&s;ts. He acts con&s;i&s;tently. For <HI>he that cometh to God mu&s;t believe that he is.</HI> But the practical athei&s;t admits that he is, and yet doth not come to him. Where is the material difference between deny|ing him religious homage, and denying his exi&s;t|ence?</P>
<P>The ancient Epicureans profe&s;&s;ed to believe a God, but denied his moral perfections and pro|vidence. They de&s;cribed him as a God at ea&s;e, indifferent to, and even ignorant of, the conduct of his creatures. Their own voluptuou&s;ne&s;s was but an imitation of their god. They who re&s;train
<PB N="7" REF="028529_0005_0FD93537FA652C48">
prayer, ca&s;t off fear. They may po&s;&s;ibly &s;ay, "We do not deny that God is to be wor&s;hipped, any more than we deny his being." May we not reply, as an apo&s;tle did in another and &s;imilar ca&s;e? "Shew thy faith by thy works. The devils be|lieve that there is one God, and tremble," and bla&s;pheme.</P>
<P N="2">2. Do any pay God an external wor&s;hip, who&s;e general cour&s;e of life is a denial of his perfections and providence? Applicable to &s;uch are the words of St. Paul, "Be not deceived, for God is not mocked." Their religious performances declare one thing; their uniform practice, another. From which are we to determine whether they own or di&s;own a God? Their actions &s;ay that they have no awe of God, no de&s;ire of his approbation, or fear of his di&s;plea&s;ure. What le&s;s can we con|clude than this, that, might they have their choice, there would be no God?</P>
<P N="3">3. Such as u&s;e religion as a pretext to their &s;in|i&s;ter ends, may conceal their real character in a great mea&s;ure from the world, and even from them&s;elves. But is there more impiety in avow|ed athei&s;m, than in making u&s;e of God and reli|gion to patroni&s;e hypocri&s;y, and crimes which &s;hock humanity? While men would be thought to do God &s;ervice, yea, while they have thought them&s;elves in the fir&s;t cla&s;s of his favorites, they have faught again&s;t him. In the judgment ac|cording to truth, the higher any one's preten&s;ions, while the inward temper is mo&s;t repugnant to re|ligion,
<PB N="8" REF="028529_0006_0FD9354B84AEC2D0">
the higher indignity is offered to God; the more are his perfections and exi&s;tence denied and reproached.</P>
<P>Is there a God of all perfection? Should we not then &s;et him always before us? Should we not, in a &s;teady cour&s;e, &s;olemnly recognize his be|ing, perfections and providence? Should we not be habitually impre&s;&s;ed with the contemplation of him in his works, his word, and his admini&s;tra|tion? Should not our hearts and lives, as well as our lips, expre&s;s our faith in him? If there is a God of all perfection, of what high concern is it, that we be conformed to him, and the objects of his &s;pecial love?</P>
<P>From the general view we have taken of the practical athei&s;t's character, let us proceed to &s;hew that he is de&s;ervedly pronounced a <HI>fool.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. Were there no God, according to his wi&s;h, &s;till the exi&s;tence of a God is greatly to be <HI>de&s;ired,</HI> and therefore it is folly to wi&s;h there were none.</P>
<P>The being of a God includes a wi&s;e, univer&s;al and perpetual providence, a moral government, the immortality of the &s;oul, and future ineffable rewards for them who diligently &s;eek him. It is the foundation of &s;erenity and hope amid&s;t all the trials of life, and in the view of death. In the mo&s;t favorable circum&s;tances which we can &s;up|po&s;e on earth, man is con&s;cious to de&s;ires and ca|pacities to which no external things are adapted&mdash; de&s;ires and capacities of a far &s;uperior nature to the animal appetites and affections. At his be&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="028529_0007_0FD9353CE0DA0CA8">
&s;tate, he <HI>walks through dry places, &s;eeking re&s;t,</HI> but not finding it, unle&s;s he hath imbibed the prin|ciples of religion&mdash;is e&s;tabli&s;hed in the belief of a God, who made and governs the world, con&s;um|mately ble&s;&s;ed in him&s;elf, and all-&s;ufficient, of per|fect moral rectitude, who delighteth in mercy, and will fulfil the de&s;ire of them that fear him.</P>
<P>Moreover, what a variety of circum&s;tances are there, in which we cannot take outward &s;atisfac|tion in the enjoyments of life, though &s;urrounded with them; and which they would yield, were it not for &s;uch circum&s;tances? Such are excruci|ating pains, langui&s;hing &s;ickne&s;s, the lo&s;s of dear|e&s;t connexions in life, or anxiety for them in their misfortunes and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, or affliction from their mi&s;conduct, or the calamities under which they are born and continued, or which may have come on them. In &s;uch circum&s;tances man feels his need of the principles of religion.</P>
<P>Or could outward things &s;atisfy us <HI>at pre&s;ent,</HI> were we exempt from all the troubles of life; yet we cannot but be thoughtful for the <HI>time to come.</HI> Death is the common lot of mankind, and mu&s;t &s;oon be our own lot. Per&s;ons of all conditions and ages die &s;uddenly by various means. None of them return to us. We cannot promi&s;e our|&s;elves another day, or hour. Shall we then take up &s;atisfied with the world, when we know not what a day may bring forth? Suppo&s;e we &s;hall die to-morrow, or this night, where &s;hall we then be? No where! nothing! if there is no God, who
<PB N="10" REF="028529_0008_0FD9353E6FCB07F8">
alone hath immortality. What a damp mu&s;t the pro&s;pect of &s;peedy annihilation ca&s;t over all the plea&s;ant things of the world? Mu&s;t it not turn all joy into heavine&s;s? Can the mind be recon|ciled to the thought, that in a little time, perhaps in one hour, we &s;hall cea&s;e forever! Whenever death &s;hall come, we &s;hall peri&s;h as the bea&s;ts, if there is no God. What pre-eminence then hath man above them? What a fool, how bruti&s;h, is he who would thus degrade the human &s;pecies, next in the &s;cale of beings to the angels! Is it not more eligible and wi&s;e to believe an after &s;tate, free from all the encumbrances, pains, &s;orrows and anxieties of this? a &s;tate of unmingled, un|cea&s;ing happine&s;s, adapted to our intelligent, moral nature? The a&s;&s;ured expectation of &s;uch a &s;tate can calm the mind, reconcile it to the &s;ufferings of the pre&s;ent time, di&s;pel the gloom of the grave, the hou&s;e appointed for all the living, and make us more than conquerers in pa&s;&s;ing the vale of death.</P>
<P>The exi&s;tence of a God therefore is mo&s;t de&s;i|rable. He who wi&s;heth there were none, wi&s;heth mi&s;ery to him&s;elf, and to mankind. Were his wi&s;h the real truth, it would be the highe&s;t wi&s;|dom to embrace and act upon the contrary opini|on, for the &s;ake of pa&s;&s;ing with ea&s;e through life, and clo&s;ing it quietly and joyfully. If he is mi&s;|taken who thinks there is a God, and conducts ac|cordingly, he is not a lo&s;er, but a gainer, by his mi&s;take, in life. He cannot repent his mi&s;take
<PB N="11" REF="028529_0009_0FD9354047789518">
after death; nor can any reproach him with it, if death is a total extinction of being. So that even on the &s;uppo&s;ition there were no God, the believer of one is wi&s;e, and the di&s;believer a fool. The athei&s;t is a fool, &s;hould what he wi&s;heth turn out to be true. It is an happy delu&s;ion to think and wi&s;h differently from him, whether we regard our own comfort, or the welfare of mankind&mdash; Happy to think and wi&s;h differently, provided we al&s;o <HI>practi&s;e</HI> differently. For to believe a God, and not live accordingly, can only alarm us with unnece&s;&s;ary fears&mdash;Unnece&s;&s;ary, I mean, on the &s;uppo&s;ition of the truth of athei&s;m&mdash;But,</P>
<P>Secondly, if there is a God, they who live as though there were none, mu&s;t be eternally <HI>ruined;</HI> and therefore the athei&s;t is a fool.</P>
<P>It is the part of wi&s;dom to choo&s;e and act on that &s;ide which in all events will be mo&s;t &s;afe. If athei&s;m is folly, even on the &s;uppo&s;ition of its truth, much more is it folly on the &s;uppo&s;ition of its fal&s;hood. Admit that the being of a God is barely <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> what an hazard may the athei&s;t run? The hazard is, that he may po&s;&s;ibly be mi&s;erable beyond expre&s;&s;ion, in body and &s;oul, forever. If the being of a God is <HI>probable,</HI> the hazard then is that he will probably be thus mi&s;erable. And if the being of God is <HI>certain,</HI> the mi&s;ery of the a|thei&s;t is not le&s;s &s;o. How inconceivable then is his &s;tupidity? Could he per&s;uade him&s;elf that the notion of a God is entirely a fiction, &s;o as to be tolerably calm through life, and to have no other
<PB N="12" REF="028529_0010_0FD93548CA152D40">
apprehen&s;ion at death than that of annihilation; yet, &s;hould he then find him&s;elf mi&s;taken, the con&s;equence is too di&s;mal to be expre&s;&s;ed or con|ceived. Even the &s;hadow of a probability that he may then find him&s;elf mi&s;taken is abundantly &s;ufficient to convict him of folly in not providing again&s;t &s;uch probability&mdash;call it contingency, if you plea&s;e. What wi&s;e man would run the &s;malle&s;t po&s;&s;ible hazard, where &s;uch a con&s;e|quence may be depending?</P>
<P>We have &s;hewn that the athei&s;t's opinion, acted upon, abridgeth him of the true&s;t &s;atisfac|tion in life, and cuts him off from all hope in death. What a dreadful leap doth he then take, if the oppo&s;ite opinion &s;hould be true&punc; His er|ror, not di&s;covered till too late to be corrected, he mu&s;t fruitle&s;&s;ly lament, and experience its effects under the final di&s;plea&s;ure of that God who <HI>is a con&s;uming fire.</HI> Had he acted on the &s;uppo&s;ition that there is a God, he would have run no hazard, if this be a mi&s;take. For who could puni&s;h or reproach him for it? If he had wor&s;hipped as God an ideal being, his error and his exi&s;tence would terminate together, and he would have en|joyed the temporary con&s;olation, which the prac|tical belief of a Deity mu&s;t afford in this &s;tate.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e athei&s;m were the general opinion of mankind, and that a believer in God and true wor&s;hipper of him mu&s;t &s;acrifice every thing dear in life, and life it&s;elf, to his belief and practice, would he not be the wi&s;e man, and all others
<PB N="13" REF="028529_0011_0FD935AD82CCD7B8">
fools, admitting the truth of religion? <HI>Their</HI> gain would be temporal, their lo&s;s eternal; but <HI>his</HI> gain would be eternal, his lo&s;s temporal.</P>
<P>Thirdly, it is the &s;ummit of folly to live in &s;uch a manner as mu&s;t impel them to chu&s;e that there were no God, when at the &s;ame time men <HI>&s;u&s;pect,</HI> and even <HI>conclude,</HI> there is one.</P>
<P>Such is the fool de&s;cribed in the text. His heart is at variance with his head. He acts a|gain&s;t his own &s;entiments, as well as again&s;t the &s;entiment of all the world. For this principle, the being of a God, has had the con&s;ent of all mankind. The athie&s;t "half believes a God;" why el&s;e doth he <HI>fear</HI> one? It is folly to fear the mere phantom of a Deity. If a Deity is merely a phantom, he thinks it a reality, or it would not terrify him. The p&s;almi&s;t ob&s;erves, v. 5, con. "There were they in great fear, where no fear was." The vicious, the profane and athei&s;tical &s;coffers at religion, as they have cau&s;e, are the greate&s;t cowards, in certain circum&s;tances. <HI>The &s;ound of a &s;haken leaf cha&s;eth them;</HI> and <HI>they fly as from the &s;word, when none</HI> are <HI>pur&s;uing</HI> them. Many imaginary fears are the effect of guilt. In time of danger it takes from hardy veterans in vice all fortitude. When their iniquity doth but &s;eem to have found them out, they betray guilt in their a&s;pect, their behavior, their manner of defence; and &s;ometimes make immediate confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q>But the&s;e fears, you may &s;ay, are produc|ed by the apprehen&s;ion of <HI>civil</HI> penalties, not
<PB N="14" REF="028529_0012_0FD9354A16129AB0">
by any &s;en&s;e of a <HI>God,</HI> or of accountablene&s;s to him.</Q> This, however, doth not account for the fears of the guilty, where no civil penalties are apprehended. It doth not account for their fear of death, from &s;ickne&s;s or otherwi&s;e. Nor is this merely a natural dread of di&s;&s;olution. Some|thing within pre&s;ages an after reckoning an after exi&s;tence. They judge them&s;elves, and natural|ly apprehend an higher judgment.</P>
<P>That &s;uch as mock at &s;in, and in the general cour&s;e of life have no fear of God, are yet afraid when danger or death is nigh, proves that they believe there is a God, though they wi&s;h there were not. When their powers of reflection are by any means awakened, they are afraid of him. <HI>O thou afflicted, to&s;&s;ed with tempe&s;t, and not com|forted!</HI> why do thy thoughts trouble thee? What is it within thy brea&s;t, that agitates thee, and pre|vents thy repo&s;e? what that makes thee heavy in the mid&s;t of laughter, and drives &s;leep from thine eyes? If there is no God, thou may&s;t certainly conclude that this officious intruder on thy peace is a liar; and neede&s;t not be troubled, becau&s;e it <HI>writeth bitter things again&s;t thee.</HI> Why &s;hould the weakne&s;s of &s;uper&s;tition, or &s;ickly fancy, cau&s;e thy countenance to turn pale, thy tongue to faul|ter, and thy joints to tremble? Ha&s;t thou found by thy wi&s;dom that &s;ome crazy dreamer fir&s;t &s;tart|ed the notion of a God? that fear circulated it? and that it was inculcated to an&s;wer the ends of politicians? Why then art thou unmanned by the
<PB N="15" REF="028529_0013_0FD93554EEF5DDA8">
mi&s;givings and forebodings of thine own mind? Why &s;hould the&s;e confute thy declaration, that there is no God?</P>
<P>The plain truth is this: The thoughtle&s;s, vi|cious and profligate, by their manner of life, bring them&s;elves to &s;ay in their heart. <Q>No God. Well were it for us, if there were none. He is not our God, our Father and friend. We are ene|mies to his government, and have naught el&s;e to expect but to be frowned from his pre&s;ence. O that there were no God! or that he had not brought us into being!</Q></P>
<P>When men have lived without God in the world, they have the temerity to wi&s;h, what per|haps they dare not utter, that God might not be. They are re&s;olved not to alter their cour&s;e. This, they are aware, mu&s;t end in ruin, if God exi&s;ts, and governs the world. Hence the only alter|native left them is to wi&s;h that athei&s;m were true. <HI>Surely the&s;e are fools.</HI> They are at variance with them&s;elves. For while they wi&s;h there were no God, they al&s;o wi&s;h to die in favor with him. Can the athei&s;t be named, who doth not mo&s;t &s;incerely join with Balaam in his prayer: "Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my la&s;t end be like his?" If this is even the athei&s;t's pray|er, judge ye whether his athei&s;m is any other than practical. And is he not a fool to live as no one can be willing to die?&mdash;e&s;tranged from God? By wi&s;hing to die as the righteous man dieth, he commends the life of the righteous, the part cho|&s;en
<PB N="16" REF="028529_0014_0FD93556C9FD8A78">
and the cour&s;e pur&s;ued by him. The pious man's end could not be preferable to that of the impious, unle&s;s his life were &s;o. That choice or cour&s;e, which ends well, mu&s;t be pronounced wi&s;e: that which ends ill, mu&s;t therefore be un|wi&s;e. The athei&s;t him&s;elf being judge, he lives and dies a fool; why el&s;e is it his wi&s;h that he may die the death of the righteous?</P>
<P>Would we determine on wi&s;dom and folly as relative to the characters and pur&s;uits of men, let us follow them to the clo&s;ing &s;cene. Let us ob|&s;erve whether they go off the &s;tage with honor or di&s;grace. Is death the end of all men? Then they are wi&s;e who con&s;ider their latter end&mdash;who refer their conduct in life to this &s;olemn period, and act &s;uch a part as they can the review with approbation. If the athei&s;t cannot then approve his own part, but will be compelled to wi&s;h that he had acted the part of the godly man, is it with|out rea&s;on that we call him a fool?</P>
<P>Can any &s;ubject of enquiry be more &s;erious and important than <HI>this,</HI> whether we &s;o live as that it is our highe&s;t intere&s;t to &s;uppo&s;e there is a God, or the contrary? Could men, either from &s;cepti|cal pride or di&s;&s;olute manners, fix down in the per|&s;ua&s;ion, that God is nothing but a name, they might then be exempt from the perturbations of guilt, and apprehen&s;ions of a judgment. On this &s;uppo&s;ition, they would neither approve nor con|demn any affections, volitions or actions in a mor|al view. Still, being endowed with &s;ore thought,
<PB N="17" REF="028529_0015_0FD93558B78AA0C0">
and ob&s;erving the frailty of the human race, they could not but be anxious whether, or after what manner, they &s;hall exi&s;t when they leave this world. If they are &s;ettled in the opinion of athe|i&s;m, what but palpable darkne&s;s is before them? None of their friends who have been removed, return to inform them whether there is another life; or if there is, of what &s;ort. Athei&s;m then doth not relieve their minds, naturally thoughtful for futurity, and &s;olicitous to know what may be at and after death&mdash;an event which the wi&s;e and fooli&s;h alike expect.</P>
<P>But if the wicked rather <HI>wi&s;h</HI> there were not a God, than really <HI>di&s;believe,</HI> what madne&s;s hath led them to &s;uch a wi&s;h? Shall they profe&s;s that they know and believe in him, and yet &s;eldom have him in their thoughts, renounce his fear, de&s;pi&s;e his goodne&s;s, and abu&s;e his grace and patience? Shall their practice &s;peak this language, <Q>Who is the Almighty, that we &s;hould &s;erve him? and what profit &s;hall we have, if we pray unto him?</Q> Is he the former of our bodies, and the father of our &s;pirit? Do we live, and move, and have our being in him? Doth every good gift come from him? Hath he to all other gifts added that of a Redeemer, which indeed comprehends all things? Can he &s;ave or de&s;troy? And &s;hall his creatures, formed to &s;hew forth his prai&s;e, and for whom he hath delivered up his own Son, forget him, and live as though they were &s;elf-made, and &s;elf-pre|&s;erved? as though their good were in their own
<PB N="18" REF="028529_0016_0FD93559C3E12A00">
hands? as though they were not accountable? had nothing to hope from his favor, nothing to fear from his anger? <Q>Under&s;tand ye bruti&s;h, and ye fools when will ye be wi&s;e? He that planted the ear, &s;hall he not hear? He that formed the eye, &s;hall he not &s;ee? He that teach|eth man knowledge, &s;hall not he know?</Q> Will you not call on his name in public or private? Or will you u&s;e it only to profane it? Or will you cry mightily to him in your calamity, or when danger is near; and yet not have him in all your thoughts in the day of health, &s;afety and pro&s;per|ity? Have you no concern with God, except in a time of extremity? and would you apply to him then only? Or have you to do with him at all times, in every place, in all circum&s;tances? Tho&s;e who fear before him habitually, who ble&s;s him at all times, and acknowledge him in all their ways, &s;hall not be afraid of evil tidings. Their heart is fixed, tru&s;ting in the Lord. He hath not given them a &s;pirit of fear. He is their refuge, and ve|ry pre&s;ent help in trouble. Such is the difference between religion and irreligion.</P>
<P>The athei&s;t is a fool from <HI>choice,</HI> not from <HI>ne|ce&s;&s;ity.</HI> Were it owing to a want or imbecility of under&s;tanding that he &s;aith there is no God, his folly would be his excu&s;e. But this is not the ca&s;e. "The world by WISDOM knew not God. <HI>Profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to be</HI> WISE, they became fools." The gro&s;&s;e&s;t errors in religion, and athe|i&s;m it&s;elf, proceed from an affectation of &s;uperior

wi&s;dom. Thr&ocirc; the pride of knowing more than they have faculties for, it comes to pa&s;s that men know nothing as they ought to know. Hence they <Q>put darkne&s;s for light, and light for dark|ne&s;s; bitter for &s;weet, and &s;weet for bitter; and call evil good, and good evil.</Q></P>
<P>How great is human depravity, that God &s;hould be di&s;owned! that any of the human race &s;hould indulge a wi&s;h in their hearts that HE were not! It is not con&s;idered what this horrid wi&s;h implies. But is <HI>incon&s;ideration</HI> an excu&s;e&punc; Is it not a crime? A God may be clearly &s;een in his works&mdash;parti|cularly in our own frame. The idea of a God, if not innate, has been a part of education among all nations; it is demon&s;trable, if we <HI>a&s;cend</HI> from effects to their cau&s;e, whether it be or not in the other mode of <HI>de&s;cending</HI> from cau&s;e to effect. His being and moral perfections are the only joy and hope of &s;uch a creature as man, formed to con|template and adore, capable of deliberating and preferring, naturally con&s;cious of liberty and ac|countablene&s;s, placed in this mixed &s;tate, and ap|parently intended for another.</P>
<P>The government of an omnipotent Deity, the parent of the whole family in heaven and earth, is matter of rejoicing to that part of his family to which we belong, as well as to that above. Is it not then among the mo&s;t affecting proofs of man's fall and corruption, that he &s;hould practi|cally deny the God that is above! Surely he mu&s;t be a very different creature from what God made

him, before he could wi&s;h in his heart, that his Creator and Father were not! Would it be cruel to wi&s;h a numerous family of children might be left orphans! Would it be mo&s;t vile and ab&s;urd were a child of the family to wi&s;h the father and head were taken away! What is this compared with <HI>his</HI> folly and vilene&s;s, who wi&s;heth that all the offspring of God, angels and men, had no parent! What mu&s;t the conduct be, in which &s;uch a wi&s;h originates? It is <HI>his</HI> wi&s;h who goes about &s;eeking whom he may devour&mdash;<HI>his</HI> wi&s;h who left his own habitation by the eternal throne, and is compelled to &s;ay, "Farthe&s;t from God is be&s;t."</P>
<P>What has been di&s;cour&s;ed &s;hould awaken re|flection in tho&s;e who have much regard to the eye of <HI>man,</HI> but little or no regard to the eye of <HI>God.</HI> All things are naked and open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do. This is forgotten, and practically denied, by all who do tho&s;e things under cover of the night, or in retirement, which, &s;hould they come abroad, would fill them with fear or &s;hame. To take pains in &s;aving appear|ances, but no pains about the principles and ends of our actions, all which are weighed by a God of knowledge, is to deny that HE looketh at the heart. They who have a <HI>form</HI> of godline&s;s, but deny the <HI>power,</HI> cheri&s;h this inward thought, that God doth not &s;earch the heart, in order to ren|der to every man according to his ways. They who practi&s;e &s;ecret fraud, liars, fal&s;e accu&s;ers, per|jured

per&s;ons, thieves, adulterers, envious per|&s;ons, practically &s;ay, that God's eye is not on them. They deny him in works, in the heart. When tho&s;e who&s;e eye is evil towards others, learn the charity which envieth not&mdash;when the unclean be|come cha&s;te&mdash;when he that &s;tole, &s;teals no more, but worketh with his hands the things that is good, that he may give to him that needeth&mdash; when the perjured have no longer a right hand of fal&s;hood&mdash;when the profane learn to fear HIM who holds not tho&s;e guiltle&s;s that take his name in vain&mdash;when liars cea&s;e from fal&s;hood&mdash;when they who have defrauded others, learn to live in hone&s;ty&mdash;when they who have taken great pains to conceal their &s;ins from the world, &s;hall take like pains not to &s;in in &s;ecret&mdash;when they who have done their works to be &s;een of men, &s;hall &s;tudy to approve them&s;elves to God&mdash;Then all the&s;e will be&s;t &s;hew that they believe a God. Then will they have rea&s;on to conclude, that his being and perfections are the wi&s;h and joy of their hearts. With him there is mercy, and plenteous redemption. The Savior of the world came to call all manner of &s;inners to repentance.</P>
<P><HI>Every one that doeth evil hateth the light.</HI> An <HI>evil</HI> heart is an heart of <HI>unbelief&punc;</HI> It is inclined to deny or pervert the truth. Ahab &s;aid of Mica|jah, <Q>I hate him; for he never prophe&s;ieth good unto me, but always evil.</Q> Micajah had told him the truth, and therefore was held as an ene|my by Ahab, who cheri&s;hed as friends tho&s;e who prophe&s;ied lies.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="028529_0020_0FD9356443B0F628">Suppo&s;e a man of an evil heart may have ju&s;t &s;entiments of religion, and can draw a fine picture of it; &s;uppo&s;e him to have all knowledge, and the faith of a martyr; yet he hath not love to God or men, and is <HI>as &s;ounding bra&s;s, or a tink|ling cymbal.</HI> If there be a God, we ought to love him with all the heart, and &s;oul, and &s;trength and mind. It is good to draw near to him. They that are far from him &s;hall peri&s;h. The &s;on in the parable, who, when commanded to work in the vineyard, an&s;wered very re&s;pectfully, <HI>I go, &s;ir; and went not,</HI> was as de&s;titute of filial reverence as he who petulantly an&s;wered, <HI>I will not.</HI> Tru&s;t not to external profe&s;&s;ions. The divine com|mand is, <HI>My &s;on, give me thine heart.</HI> "Keep thine heart with all diligence; for out of it are the i&s;&s;ues of life." Next to the love of God, your neighbor claims your attention and regard. The love of him &s;hould be mea&s;ured by &s;elf-love. In other words, <Q>What&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them.</Q></P>
<P>If we walk circum&s;pectly, not as fools, but as wi&s;e, we &s;hall redeem time, and improve every talent, as good &s;tewards of the manifold grace of God. <HI>The wi&s;e &s;hall inherit glory; but &s;hame &s;hall be the promotion of fools.</HI></P>
