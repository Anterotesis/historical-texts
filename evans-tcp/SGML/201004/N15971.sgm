<HEAD>Mi&s;s BETSEY ALLGOOD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS pretty little Mi&s;s, though now but in the &s;eventh Year of her Age, has more Thought and Prudence than many at &s;eventeen. She works at her Needle to Admi|ration, reads like a little Queen, and writes a very pretty Hand. How far &s;he has improved in the Art of Drawing, the Specimen in the next Page will &s;hew.</P>

<P>However pretty the&s;e Accompli&s;h|ments may be con&s;idered, yet they are but trifling when compared with the Graces of her Mind; I mean, her good and pretty Behav|iour. She never laughs at tho&s;e who may not happen to know &s;o much as her&s;elf, but &s;he endeavours to in&s;truct them; &s;he is not &s;atisfied
<PB N="11" REF="020440_0005_0FAF0A46B0199D28">with telling them that &s;uch a Thing was done wrong, but &s;he endeavours to tell them how to do it right.</P>
<P>So great is her Reputation among all her little Friends and Neighbours, that whenever any Di&s;pute happens among them which they cannot &s;et|tle them&s;elves, Mi&s;s Bet&s;ey is always applied to, to make up the Matter, and her Deci&s;ion is never di&s;puted by either Party.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Bet&s;ey &s;ays her Prayers con|&s;tantly every Night and Morning, and &s;ays Grace before and after Meat. She never attempts to con|tradict her Papa or Mamma, but cheerfully does every Thing &s;he is bidden to do. By the&s;e Means &s;he plea&s;es every one around her, and is her&s;elf perfectly happy; for it is
<PB N="12" REF="020440_0006_0FAF0A47A0B11078">impo&s;&s;ible for a Child to be happy, who is perpetually whining and pi|ning after every Thing, and equal|ly re&s;tle&s;s and unhappy even if it gets what it a&s;ks for.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Bet&s;ey's Pap and Mamma were wi&s;e People, and often remark|ed, that the Pervi&s;ity of Children is oftentimes more owing to the Mi&s;|management of Parents, than to the Children them&s;elves. When Chil|dren cry for any Thing, it &s;hould never be given them; becau&s;e, if they get it by that Means, when they want any Thing that is impro|per for them, they will think they have only to cry, and then they will obtain it.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee, my pretty little Readers, that Mi&s;s Bet&s;ey never
<PB N="13" REF="020440_0006_0FAF0A47A0B11078">cries for any Thing &s;he wants, nor a&s;ks for any Thing a &s;econd Time, which has been once denied her. By this good Behaviour, Mi&s;s Bet|&s;ey has acquired &s;o great a Reputa|tion, as will never be forgotten &s;o long as a Leaf of this Book &s;hall hold together.</P>

<HEAD>Ma&s;ter BILLY BAD-ENOUGH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS young Gentleman is one of tho&s;e Kinds of Characters which even we little great Writers find it difficult to de&s;cribe; becau&s;e there is in his Compo&s;ition &s;uch a &s;trange Mixture of Goodne&s;s and Naughtine&s;s, as in &s;ome Degree per|plexes us in what Light to place him.</P>
<P>Ma&s;ter Billy Badenough was hap|py in having the be&s;t of Parents, who &s;pared no Expence to give him the be&s;t Education; and, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, no Boy &s;tudied his Book clo&s;er or better, or made a more ra|pid Progre&s;s than he did. At the Age of nine Years, he could read, write, and ca&s;t Accounts with any
<PB N="15" REF="020440_0007_0FAF0A488EF44328">one, had made &s;ome Progre&s;s in Latin and French, and under&s;tood &s;ome little Matters in Geography. He was very goodnatured, and rea|dily parted with any Thing to his Playfellows.</P>
<P>The&s;e were his good Qualities; and I could wi&s;h I were not under the Nece&s;&s;ity of repeating his bad ones; but you know that we little Biographers mu&s;t &s;peak the Truth, and conceal nothing.</P>
<P>One of his principal Faults was, that of robbing Orchards. It was but the other Day, that Mr. John Goodwell caught him in his Orch|ard, hanging with his whole Weight upon one of the Boughs of a Fruit-Tree, in order to break it off, and carry away both the Bough and the
<PB N="16" REF="020440_0008_0FAF0A490D7C50F8">Fruit thereon. This is an exact Repre&s;entation of the Matter.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>He was fond of going a Birdne&s;t|ing; and, indeed, there would have been no Harm in this, had he, like good Boys in general, taken Care of the poor innocent little Things, and fed them; but it was his Rule &s;el|dom
<PB N="17" REF="020440_0008_0FAF0A490D7C50F8">to bring home any. Some he would throw into Ponds and Riv|ers, and was even &s;o hard-hearted and naughty, as to &s;tand and laugh at the poor dear little Things while they were drowning and &s;truggling for Life. Others, that could nei|ther fly nor walk, he would &s;et up|on the Ground, and &s;hy at them with Sticks until he had killed them, and even the few that he brought home, he took no Care of them, but &s;uffered them to die for Want. This, however, is &s;o melancholy a Subject that I cannot pur&s;ue it.</P>
<P>His Papa, finding he was guilty of the&s;e, and many other naughty Tricks, &s;uch as kicking up Boys Heels on the Ice, and fighting with every one who gave him the lea&s;t
<PB N="18" REF="020440_0009_0FAF0A4B6778EB60">Offence, determined him to &s;end him to Sea, for which Purpo&s;e he is now learning Navigation. Should he happen to be ca&s;t away on a de|&s;ert I&s;land, how can he expect to re|ceive Mercy, who has &s;hewn &s;o lit|tle to poor innocent Birds? But, I hope, as he grows older, he will grow better, and repent.</P>

<HEAD>Mi&s;s NANCY CAREFUL.</HEAD>
<P>THIS pretty little amiable young Lady had the Misfortune to lo&s;e her Mamma when &s;he was on|ly four Years of Age, and to add to her Calamities, &s;he had hardly reach|ed her &s;eventh Year, when &s;he fol|lowed her dear Papa to his Grave. There certainly cannot be a greater Misfortune happen to little Ones, than the early Lo&s;s of their Parents. Mi&s;s Nancy was truly &s;en&s;ible of this. Her Papa and Mamma lay buried in the &s;ame Tomb; and this dear little Girl would often &s;real a|way from the Hou&s;e of her Guard|ian to &s;eat her&s;elf upon their Grave and water it with her Tears. Can

<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>She had, however, poor little Maiden, two Things which contri|buted to con&s;ole her under the&s;e terrible Misfortunes: The fir&s;t was that &s;he lived in the Hou&s;e of her
<PB N="21" REF="020440_0010_0FAF0A4C7121FCD8">Guardian, who faithfully di&s;charg|ed the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him; and &s;econdly, that &s;he had an only Bro|ther, who was worthy of &s;uch a Si&s;ter, and who did every Thing in his Power, to make her forget the terrible Lo&s;s they had both &s;u&s;tain|ed; but I &s;hall forbear &s;aying any Thing here of that little Gentle|man, as I &s;hall particularly &s;peak of him in the next Article of this my invaluable Work.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Nancy not only attended clo&s;ely to her Book and her Needle, but hardly ever &s;pent an idle Mo|ment; and &s;o attentive was &s;he to improve her&s;elf in all u&s;eful Knowledge, that her Guardian was frequently obliged to force her out upon Vi&s;its, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould hurt
<PB N="22" REF="020440_0011_0FAF0A4CB38E93F0">her Health by too clo&s;e an Appli|cation to what &s;he con&s;idered as her Duty. This, my pretty little Rea|ders, you know, is a very uncom|mon Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Before the had reached the Age of ten Years, there was hardly any Youth in the Neighbourhood, ei|ther Ma&s;ter or Mi&s;s, who could read, write, &s;pell, and ca&s;t up com|mon Accounts with her; and, with|out mentioning her Excellency in the fine&s;t Needle-work, her Pa&s;try, Pickles, and Pre&s;erves, were ju&s;tly admired by all the Gentry for many Miles round.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Things con&s;idered it is no Wonder that a young Gentleman in tho&s;e Parts &s;hould pay Mi&s;s Nan|cy a Vi&s;it on her reaching her nine|teenth
<PB N="23" REF="020440_0011_0FAF0A4CB38E93F0">Year. He found &s;he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed an uncommon Share of good Sen&s;e, Meekne&s;s, and Affability, without the lea&s;t Tincture of Pride or Affectation. He &s;oon married Mi&s;s Nancy, who now rides about in her Coach, admired by her Hu&s;band, beloved by her Friends, and envied only by tho&s;e who do not po&s;&s;e&s;s her Virtues.</P>

<HEAD>Ma&s;ter SAMMY CAREFUL.</HEAD>
<P>THIS young Gentleman is the Brother of the Lady, who&s;e Cha|racter I have ju&s;t given. He is two Years older than his Si&s;ter, and is worthy of the be&s;t Thing that can be &s;aid of him.</P>
<P>On the Death of his dear Papa, he felt the keene&s;t Agonies, and was truly &s;en&s;ible of his Lo&s;s; but when he &s;aw his poor little dear Si&s;ter's Heart ready to bur&s;t with Tears and Grief, he thought it became nece&s;&s;a|ry in him to &s;tifle his own Sorrows, in order to alieviate tho&s;e of his Si&s;ter.</P>
<P>He would now and then cry with her, with a View to humour her; then he would &s;uddenly wipe the
<PB N="25" REF="020440_0012_0FAF0A4D8DF16D70">Tears from her Cheeks, and rea&s;on with her on the Impropriety of their making them&s;elves miserable about what they could not recover, and which would even make their Parents unhappy in Heaven, did they know it. When Sammy found he had thus con&s;oled his Si&s;ter, whom he mo&s;t tenderly loved, he would him|&s;elf &s;teal out into the Fields &s;et him|&s;elf down at the Foot of a Tree, and there have his Cry out by him&s;elf. My pretty Readers do not your little beating Hearts feel an uncommon Emotion at the Sight of the Picture in the next Page? May you never have Occa&s;ion to do the like!</P>

<P>As Ma&s;ter Sammy had always been a very &s;ober and careful Child, and very attentive to his Books, it is no Wonder that he proved, in the End, to be an excellent Scholar.</P>
<P>Accordingly, when he had reach|ed the Age of fourteen, Mr. William Goodall, a wealthy Merchant in the
<PB N="27" REF="020440_0013_0FAF0A4E808CEE20">City of Bo&s;ton, took him into his Compting hou&s;e, in order to bring him up in the mercantile Way, and thereby make his Fortune.</P>
<P>This was a &s;ad Stroke upon his poor Si&s;ter Nancy, who, after having lo&s;t both her Papa and Mamma, was now likely to lo&s;e her Brother like|wi&s;e; but Sammy did all he could to appea&s;e her, and a&s;&s;ured her, that he would &s;pend all his lei&s;ure Time with her. This he mo&s;t punctually performed, and never were Brother and Si&s;ter &s;o happy in each other's Company as they were.</P>
<P>Mr. William Goodall was highly &s;atisfied with Sammy's Behaviour, and, dying much about the Time that Mi&s;s Nancy was married to the Gentleman, he left all his Bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="28" REF="020440_0014_0FAF0A4EF04BC8E8">to Sammy, together with a large Capital to carry it on. So much is Mr. Careful e&s;teemed, (for we mu&s;t now no longer call him Ma&s;ter Sam|my) that he was cho&s;en, at the late general Election, Repre&s;entative in the General Court, for one of the fir&s;t Towns in New-England, with|out the lea&s;t Expence to him&s;elf.

<HEAD>Mi&s;s FANNY DAUDLE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS young Lady was an only Child, and therefore, as is too often the Ca&s;e, was a ruined one; that is, was &s;uffered to do ju&s;t what &s;he liked, without any one being permitted to contradict her. There was no &s;uch Thing as getting her to Bed at Night, or up again in the Morning; for Mi&s;s Fanny was &s;aid to have &s;o weakly a Con&s;titution, that &s;he could not bear to be forced to any Thing.</P>
<P>This young Lady in her infant Years, had every Appearance of a good Con&s;titution, and never could more Pains have been taken to &s;poil it. She was covered with a Load
<PB N="30" REF="020440_0015_0FAF0A4FAD532A28">of Clothes, in order to keep her warm, and prevent her from taking Cold. They were con&s;tantly feed|ing her with the riche&s;t Things, in order to nouri&s;h her, and make her &s;trong, as they thought; and &s;he was not put upon her Legs until &s;he was eighteen Months old.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of all the&s;e Precautions, however, at the Age of &s;ix Years, Mi&s;s was crooked both in her Legs and Shape, owing, no Doubt, to the very Means they took to prevent it, and this undoubtedly was a Fault of her Friends, and not her own, for which &s;he was much to be pitied, as are all unfortunate Children, who are ruined by the mi&s;taken Kindne&s;s of their Friends.</P>
<P>It would have been unpardonable
<PB N="31" REF="020440_0015_0FAF0A4FAD532A28">in me to take notice of the&s;e per&s;onal Defects, had not the Imperfections of her Mind been &s;till greater. Though &s;he &s;eldom aro&s;e until Noon, yet great Part of the remain|ing Day was &s;pent in this Manner on the Couch.</P>

<P>So little Time was &s;pent on her Book, that even at &s;ix Years of Age
<PB N="32" REF="020440_0016_0FAF0A521E705FA8">&s;he could hardly tell a great A from a Hou&s;e; and whenever &s;he was de|&s;ired to take a Needle in her Hand, &s;he was in&s;tantly overcome with the Vapours. She was hated by all the Servants, to whom &s;he was a con|&s;tant Plague; and very few of the young Ladies in the Neighbourhood cho&s;e to vi&s;it her, becau&s;e &s;he was no le&s;s peevi&s;h and ob&s;tinate than &s;he was proud and ignorant. It was in one of the&s;e ob&s;tinate Hu|mours, and merely out of Contra|diction to the Advice of every one, that &s;he determined to take a Walk out one Day, though it rained much. The Con&s;equence of this was, that &s;he caught a violent Cold, which brought on a Fever, and put and End to her Life in the twelfth Year of her Age.</P>

<P>MY pretty little Readers, when they &s;hall be grown up to Years of Maturity, will have too many Occa&s;ions to ob&s;erve, that it is as great a Misfortune to be of too ea&s;y a Temper, as to be of too vio|lent a one, and here is an unhappy In&s;tance of it.</P>
<P>Ma&s;ter Billy Ea&s;y had always been con&s;idered by his Parents as a very dutiful and obedient Son, and they had conceived great Hopes from &s;o promi&s;ing a Child. He paid every due Attention to his Book, minded what was &s;aid to him, and readily and cheerfully did every Thing he was bidden. If the&s;e were not pro|mi&s;ing
<PB N="35" REF="020440_0017_0FAF0A53255D9CE0">Circum&s;tances in his Favour, I know not what may be con&s;idered as &s;uch; but &s;uch are the un&s;ettled Matters of this Life, that there is no an&s;wering for any Thing, or for any Body.</P>
<P>Ma&s;ter Billy, in the tenth Year of his Age, unfortunately got acquaint|ed with a Boy of a very naughty and bad Turn of Mind, who made u&s;e of very bad Expre&s;&s;ions, told Fibs immoderately, and was always at the Head of every Kind of Mi&s;chief that was going forwards. Billy Ea|&s;y was of a Di&s;po&s;ition, which, like Wax, might be moulded into any Form; and, had he happened to fall in good Company, he would un|doubtedly have learned Good from them.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="020440_0018_0FAF0A5370371420">
<HI>Lead us not into Temptation,</HI> is a Part of our Lord's Prayer, and a very ne|ce&s;&s;ary one it is. Ma&s;ter Billy be|came the con&s;tant Companion of this naughty Boy, who led him into all kinds of Errour; and &s;o powerful was the Force of bad Example over him, that he was often drawn into the Commi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Crimes which his Heart di&s;approved, but he could not with&s;tand the Temptation.</P>
<P>He was frequently concerned in fobbing Orchards, and even &s;tealing Fruit wherever he could find it. At la&s;t he became &s;o naughty as to take up and put in his Pocket the loo&s;e Halfpence his Papa or Mamma happened to leave any where. It will be too di&s;agreeable to me to re|late every Circum&s;tance, which at

<P>THIS was a good Sort of a Boy enough, take him for all in all; and it may be &s;aid of him, that he was neither remarkably good nor remarkably bad. In &s;hort he was one of tho&s;e Characters, of whom we can &s;ay nothing that is very ill or very good.</P>
<P>He always obeyed his Parents commands, and did as he was bid|den.

<P>In his very infant Years, he &s;hewed a great Fondne&s;s for Money, and &s;aved up every Halfpenny that was given him. I am told that he &s;pent a great Part of his Time in thus counting over his Money.</P>

<P>Whenever he lent a Penny to a|ny little Boy whom he thought ex|travagant, he always obliged him to leave in his Hands a Top, a Bat|tledore, a Gig, or &s;ome &s;uch like Thing by way of Security, which he always &s;old, if the Debt was not paid in proper Time.</P>
<P>Though it is very nece&s;&s;ary for young People to be careful and pru|dent, yet Ma&s;ter Simon began &s;o early to have the Love of Money at Heart, that he never parted with

<P>THIS was a mo&s;t &s;ingular young Gentleman for his Activity and Sprightline&s;s, as well as for his Learning, Politene&s;s and Affability. No little Gentleman could make a Bow more gracefully, on coming into, or going out of a Room, than Ma&s;ter Dickey Sprightly.</P>
<P>In the Winter Sea&s;on, when the Ground was covered with Fro&s;t and Snow, and the Weather &s;o cold, that his Si&s;ters were not permitted to go out, he would &s;it by the Fire-&s;ide, and tell them &s;uch a Number of pretty Stories, which he had read in his little gilt Books, as charmed

This happy Accompli&s;hment of tel|ling pretty little Stories, drew upon him &s;o many invitations to &s;pend Evening after Evening with Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;&s;es in the mo&s;t re&s;pectable Families, that he was never at a Lo&s;s to know what to do with his lei|&s;ure Time. So glad was every one to have his Company, that they al|ways treated him with Plenty of Fruits, Pies, Tarts, Chee&s;ecakes and Cu&s;tards, in order to buy the Plea|&s;ure of his Company again.</P>
<P>In the Summer Time, he was here and there and every where; &s;ometimes up in a Tree, &s;ometimes down in a Fit, and &s;ometimes &s;cam|pering along the plain Ground, in Pur&s;uit of any Thing that happen|ed

<P>Though I would by no Means wi&s;h any of my pretty little Readers to be pert or impudent in Compa|ny, yet I do not like to &s;ee Children over ba&s;hful; for a cheerful and lively Turn in Conver&s;ation is al|ways the mo&s;t agreeable, and never

<P>I AM afraid my pretty little Readers will begin to think me an ill-natured Sort of an Author, who is more plea&s;ed with picking out faulty Characters than good ones; but I would beg Leave to re|mind them, that by pointing out to them what is a Blemi&s;h in other little Folks, it may enable them to avoid the like in them&s;elves.

<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that Mi&s;s Fanny Squeami&s;h was of but a weakly Con&s;titution; but this was in a great Mea&s;ure owing to her being too much indulged in her In|fancy.

<P>THE Ca&s;e of this little young Gentleman was, in the in|fant Part of his Years, much to be pitied. He was born of affluent Parents, but his Mother died while he was an Infant, and his Father, having met with great Lo&s;&s;es in Trade, became a Bankrupt, and left poor Tommy entirely unpro|vided for at the Age of nine Years.</P>
<P>His Father's Effects were all &s;old for the Benefit of his Credi|tors, and poor Tommy was left to the wide World to &s;eek his For|tune. He had cried bitterly enough for the Lo&s;s of his dear Father;
<PB N="97" REF="020440_0048_0FAF1154DEA23578">but, as &s;oon as the&s;e fir&s;t Struggles were over, he very wi&s;ely reflected, that, though he had lo&s;t a kind and indulgent Father, yet he was &s;en&s;i|ble, that all the Tears in the World would not re&s;tore him to his Care&s;|&s;es, and that it was now his Duty to con&s;ider of what Steps were to be taken, in order to pre&s;erve him|&s;elf from Want, and thereby pre|vent any Reflection being thrown on the Memory of his dear Father.</P>
<P>As Tommy had already learned to read, write, and ca&s;t Accounts mo&s;t prettily, he determined to offer his Services to Mr. Worthy, who was a Merchant of great Reputa|tion, and had formerly dealed with his Father. Tommy walked up and down the Street a long Time

At la&s;t he did, was let in, and introduced to Mr. Worthy, who having li&s;ten|ed with great Attention to his in|nocent and artle&s;s Tale, eagerly embraced him, promi&s;ed to be his Friend, took him in&s;tantly into his Hou&s;e, and made him one of his Clerks; and here he is at Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

When I came to be breeched, I laid a&s;ide all juvenile Sports, and was a very poor Hand at Marbles, Trap-Ball, or Cricket. Indeed I was &s;o little attentive to Play, that I was &s;oon di&s;regarded by the re&s;t of the Boys, who con&s;idered me as a dull heavy little Fellow. If ever they got quarrelling together, I never u&s;ed to intermeddle, but re|tired to a Corner, pulled out &s;ome little Book, which I always carried about me, and left them to fight it out among them&s;elves, as you here &s;ee.</P>

<P>I was never happier than when I could get into my Papa's Study, and, even long before I had any Idea how to form a Letter, I would get a Pen in my Hand, and fill a large Piece of Paper, with what may be called Pot-Hooks and Hangers.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="020440_0058_0FAF115DF93631C8">
My Papa &s;oon di&s;covered my natural Inclinations, and encourag|ed and cheri&s;hed my early and eager Pur&s;uit after Knowledge. He ac|cordingly taught me how to hold my Pen, then how to make &s;mall Let|ters, then larger ones, and &s;o on, until within ten Months, when I had learned to write as good a Hand as mo&s;t of the little Boys in our Neighbourhood who were twice my Age. I likewi&s;e conquered the four fir&s;t Rules in Arithmetick in a Trice, and my Papa tells me, that he doubts not, but that I &s;hall by and by be a great Mathemati|cian and Divine.</P>
<P>After I had learned to write and read like a Man, my Papa advi&s;ed me to &s;it down and write &s;hort Let|ters
<PB N="117" REF="020440_0058_0FAF115DF93631C8">out of my own Head, which I accordingly did; and, as I have a great many of the&s;e by me, I may, &s;ome time or other, find Lei&s;ure to peru&s;e and correct them for the Pre&s;s, when I &s;hall lay them before my little Readers for their Amu&s;e|ment as well as Improvement.</P>
<P>After I had fini&s;hed a va&s;t Num|ber of the&s;e Letters, my Papa advi&s;|ed me to ri&s;e one Step higher, and write the Characters of all the lit|tle Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;&s;es I could re|collect; but of all Things com|manded me to conceal the proper Names of the Parties and give them borrowed Titles. How far this fir&s;t Publication of a little Writer may plea&s;e the little World, I can|not tell; but they may be a&s;&s;ured,
<PB N="118" REF="020440_0059_0FAF115E6FFAF968">that it has co&s;t me much Labour and Study.</P>
<P>I would advi&s;e all the little Read|ers, into who&s;e Hands this Book may fall, carefully to notice all the different Characters they have here read, and thereby regu|late their Conduct and Behaviour, not only when they are at their own Homes, but more particularly when they are abroad upon Vi&s;its. If they carefully ob&s;erve the Conduct of others, they will often have Oc|ca&s;ion to lament, that Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;&s;es are not always &s;o good as they &s;hould be. When they evi|dently di&s;cover Imperfections in others, before they venture to cen|&s;ure or find Fault with them, they &s;hould carefully examine them&s;elves,
<PB N="119" REF="020440_0059_0FAF115E6FFAF968">whether they likewi&s;e have not been guilty of the &s;ame Kind of naughty Actions, or at lea&s;t others equally as bad. By accu&s;toming them&s;elves to this Kind of Self-Examination, they will acquire not only a Know|ledge of others, but of them&s;elves al&s;o, which is the mo&s;t de&s;irable Thing in this Life to be thorough|ly acquainted with.</P>
<P>Thus, my little Readers, have I fini&s;hed this <HI>original</HI> Work, not a &s;ingle Line of it having been taken from any Book whatever. Is there any <HI>great</HI> Author living, who can, as truly &s;ay &s;o much of any of his Works?</P>
