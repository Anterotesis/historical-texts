<HEAD>An ESSAY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is an ob&s;ervation no le&s;s true than common, that the HUMAN MIND bears a &s;trong re&s;emblance to the wild and unmanured garden of nature, which (tho' amid&s;t an infinite profu&s;ion of weeds and briers) by diligence and culture becomes fertile, fair and flouri&s;hing. Our minds being furni&s;hed with latent powers, it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of EDUCATION to unfold and bring them to light. EDUCATION is a kind of &s;econd creation; it gives form and comeline&s;s to tho&s;e rude and unwrought materials, which, like the natural World, in its chaotic &s;tate, are "without order and void." NATURE gives us talents; it is EDUCATION which applies them right or wrong; the fir&s;t be&s;tows propen&s;ities and af|fections which may be directed to good, either public or private; the latter improves or perverts them. The infant mind is pliant and ductile, like wax, you may mould it to any form; you may &s;tamp a fair or deformed impre&s;&s;ion upon it; error or knowledge, indolence or indu&s;try, virtue or vice.</P>
<Q><L>"'Tis EDUCATION forms the youthful mind,</L>
<L>Ju&s;t as the twig is bent, the tree's inclin'd."</L></Q>
<P>In youth the faculties are vigorous and alert, the concepti|on quick, and the memory retentive. We are endued with a general appetite for glory; EDUCATION determines it to this, or that particular object. Different virtues and vices are expo&s;ed to view, to captivate the attentive &s;pectator, without always di&s;playing their different concomitants or effects. As youth is unbia&s;&s;ed by prejudice; &s;o it is &s;u&s;ceptible of any im|pre&s;&s;ion, and withal credulous; curious, yet ea&s;ily impo&s;ed on.
<PB N="4" REF="012384_0003_0F894507682F2BA0">Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an innate and almo&s;t in&s;uperable propen&s;ity to imitation, we imbibe opinions, as ea&s;ily as we do manners. To nothing &s;hort of this can it be imputed, that many more are influenced by the idle reveries of the humorous, and fan|ta&s;tick notions of the capricious, than by the mo&s;t excellent &s;entiments of the wi&s;e and coun&s;els of the worthy. We mu&s;t dive&s;t things of their fal&s;e garni&s;h, le&s;t emerging from the &s;hade of ob&s;urity, we be dazzled with artificial &s;plendor and rendered incapable of &s;eeing objects in their real forms.</P>
<P>Allured by the delu&s;ive charms of a tempting World, the YOUTH as he advances in years, makes excur&s;ions, extends his acquaintance, and fixes upon &s;ome object as the darling or his pur&s;uit. He proportions the worth of every thing around him, accordingly as it fir&s;t &s;trikes his imagination. All the gaieties of the world a&s;&s;ault him at once&mdash;Plea&s;ure allures him, riches &s;ollicit, and honours court him&mdash;If he with&s;tands the fir&s;t attack, it is ten to one, but the &s;econd proves too powerful; he &s;oon forms different ideas of virtue and merit, yields him|&s;elf a captive and becomes a &s;lave. Has he been taught to de&s;pi&s;e Plea&s;ure, the grand Mi&s;tre&s;s of the world? the deli|rious, thrilling &s;en&s;ation, &s;trengthened by natural fire, will &s;oon enervate his re&s;olution and un&s;inew the mo&s;t confirmed purpo&s;es of rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy; unle&s;s CULTURE has di&s;|clo&s;ed the deceitful charms. Has he heard avarice contemn|ed; the narrow views of &s;elf-intere&s;t ridiculed? Has he been told that the fawning courtier of popular applau&s;e ju&s;tly &s;inks into contempt? Till EDUCATION has taught him the d'&s;honour and infamy to which they lead, he will be liable to fall into the &s;ame beaten track, and in the end fail of that prai&s;e, which is the fair attendant of virtue.</P>
<P>Life is a ma&s;querade, where a fictitious character is fre|quently a&s;&s;umed. Being fond of indolence, we content our|&s;elves with a &s;uperficial &s;urvey of men and things, without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> them behind the &s;cenes, as well as in the open theatre. The world is variegated with objects, which make a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> appearance without di&s;covering their intrin&s;ic worth; and the&s;e have a powerful influence to captivate the youthful &s;pectator, who&s;e education has been ill and partial; who has
<PB N="5" REF="012384_0003_0F894507682F2BA0">never been taught to look beyond the confines of his own narrow experience. EDUCATION draws the curtain which conceals their true character, gives us right ideas of honour and merit, and &s;erves as a clue to direct us to right objects of choice.</P>
<P>While the pa&s;&s;ions are opening, curio&s;ity is awake, and the young mind is ready to take its ply from the &s;educements of fa&s;hion and creditable examples. What makes the little MISS, &s;o imperious and haughty; who &s;wells with rage at every imaginary affront, and never thinks that She is treated with proper re&s;pect; what, but the early incen&s;e offered to her vanity? Why is almo&s;t every a&s;&s;embly crowded with flaunt|ing COQUETS, but becau&s;e they have been accu&s;tomed from their cradles, to admire their own <HI>&s;weet</HI> figure? No &s;ooner does &s;he perceive re&s;pect paid to dre&s;s, beauty and external mien; but &s;he u&s;es every little artifice to catch the attention of beholders. This done, &s;he grows important, in her own eyes, and imagines innumerable graces included in her beau|ty; while every little formality of the in&s;inuating GALLANT, contributes to the unguarded charmer's delu&s;ion. Why does the <HI>Youth</HI> when freed from the re&s;traints to which younger years are &s;ubject, prove a &s;pend-thrift, an abandoned rake, but from the over-fondne&s;s of doating parents, and the bad company with which he is conver&s;ant? Why does the World &s;warm with &s;hallow-pated BEAUS, but becau&s;e intrigue has been the height of their ambition, and to make good their point, they have referred to dre&s;s and conque&s;t all their views and intentions? If we hold the airy <HI>Nothing</HI> up to view, we &s;hall find all its qualifications, the mo&s;t general concomitants of a narrow, contracted education. View the empty <HI>bubble:</HI> a fickle, capricious mind with little or no genius; proud and o&s;tentatious, yet for the mo&s;t part of mean extraction; profu&s;e, yet not generous; having much raillery with little wit; fal&s;ely delicate; unacquainted with virtue and truth; well ver&s;ed in all the little arts of di&s;gui&s;e and di&s;&s;imulation; aver&s;e to indu&s;try; fond of noi&s;e and confu&s;ion; &s;trongly tinctured with pedantry; in low intrigues no novice: and I wi&s;h it were a <HI>rara avis,</HI> to whom this character might ju&s;t|ly
<PB N="6" REF="012384_0004_0F89450826DDDC10">be applied. What forms the quack, the &s;upple courtier and the &s;ham patriot; but that train of grovelling arts and low dealing, which hath led them the way to fraud and chi|cane? Whence &s;uch a &s;pawn of wild enthu&s;ia&s;ts, of blind bigots, but from their narrow education? Why, in a word, are mankind &s;o ignorant, and withal &s;o conceited; &s;o ill founded, yet &s;o ob&s;tinate, in their opinions; &s;o prone to plea|&s;ure and ea&s;e, and &s;o impatient of indu&s;try and frugality; but becau&s;e they have been hoodwinked before they had time to open their eyes, and nouri&s;hed from their infancy in popular prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in vanity and indolence? Nor is this the only mi&s;-conduct we meet with, in an age where the views of edu|cation are directed more to manners than to morals; where prudence is but artifice; where graces ca&s;t a &s;pecious glo&s;s upon vice, and the pa&s;&s;ions are allowed to give colouring to the objects of pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>The grand affair of launching into the world, takes place in a period of life the mo&s;t eventful that we ever experience. The wi&s;dom of the &s;erpent is as nece&s;&s;ary as the innocence of the dove; and unle&s;s our minds are rightly attempered with both, we &s;hall &s;plit upon the dangerous &s;hoals before we &s;py them. It is a foible to which human nature is extremely in|cident, to be content with pre&s;ent attainments, and guard the &s;afe &s;ide, while the weak one is left to defend it&s;elf. An Education (which de&s;erves the <HI>name</HI>) inculcates maxims of honour and probity, in&s;pires the noble&s;t &s;entiments of moral duty, and impre&s;&s;es an equal dete&s;tation of all the vices of depraved humanity. A Youth elated with &s;uch &s;ublime ideas, which his parents, his tutors, his books, or even his own ingenuous heart has rendered familiar to him, (little mi&s;|tru&s;ting that vice can put on more than one garb) opens forth into the World; not <HI>that</HI> which he has &s;o long dreamed of; but a World new, &s;trange and incon&s;i&s;tent with all his former expectations. The mo&s;t fa&s;hionable vices he beholds pa|troni&s;ed, pro&s;perous and triumphant, virtue di&s;countenanced, un&s;ucce&s;sful and degraded.&mdash;He finds the edge of ridicule turned on &s;ome of tho&s;e qualities, he has hither to been mo&s;t fond of.&mdash;If he quits the clamorous crowd, where impiety is
<PB N="7" REF="012384_0004_0F89450826DDDC10">made a point of honour, and profanene&s;s e&s;teemed a good recommendation; he will &s;oon unite him&s;elf to the more &s;pecious and atractive party. At fir&s;t, his &s;implicity in what they term <HI>Good breeding,</HI> makes him the dupe of this plau&s;ible &s;ociety: but &s;oon, their occa&s;ional hints, their negligent &s;ar|ca&s;ms, their &s;allies of wit and polite raillery, on what he has been accu&s;tomed to hold &s;acred, debauch his mind, and create a fondne&s;s for tho&s;e &s;cenes, which were once his greate&s;t aver|&s;ion. The truth is, the Youth &s;hould be fortified with a <HI>gradual</HI> intelligence of the World, that he may be prepared to &s;ee it without &s;urpri&s;e, and live in it without danger. His fir&s;t &s;teps &s;hould be &s;hort and &s;ecure; his a&s;&s;ociates few, and of the be&s;t. The veil mu&s;t be taken off from &s;ome parts, and left &s;till upon others; while he has, painted out before him, what he does not &s;ee, and even more hinted at, than can be painted.</P>
<P>If his mind is at fir&s;t contracted within a narrow circle, this gradual acquaintance with the things around him, will en|large his views, and teach him to regard him&s;elf as a CITIZEN OF THE WORLD, a&s;&s;ert his native liberty, and de&s;pi&s;e a SLAVE of <HI>any</HI> &s;ect or party. This will learn him to act with cauti|ou&s;ne&s;s in points where it is not impo&s;&s;ible that he may be deceived; and on the other hand, it will as effectually guard him again&s;t every wrong bias, hung upon the mind by a favourite pa&s;&s;ion, or particular education.</P>
<P>An opinionative zeal for our own tenets, is the grand inlet, the unguarded avenue of the mind, by which a thou&s;and er|rors find admi&s;&s;ion, unnoticed. We mu&s;t &s;earch the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of our thoughts, &s;ift our own &s;entiments, and &s;ubject them to frequent reviews, that we may enable the mind to detect its own &s;ophi&s;ms, and guard again&s;t the fallacies, upon which it practi&s;es. It is admirable to ob&s;erve, how many artifices mu&s;t be u&s;ed, to procure admi&s;&s;ion for the mo&s;t evi|dent truths, into minds, frightened by novelty, or rendered in&s;en&s;ible by accidental prejudice. Nay, &s;ome are &s;o very fond &amp; tenacious of their <HI>own unerring</HI> principles, that when one of their darling po&s;itions is attacked, they u&s;e no other wea|pon
<PB N="8" REF="012384_0005_0F894508E7602F58">but &s;tupidity, to elude the force of argument. To have the mind warmed with a love for truth, and willing to dive&s;t it&s;elf of all prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and prejudice, it mu&s;t be tempered with candour. This will prove no le&s;s an incentive to vir|tue, than a barrier again&s;t vice. REASON, the &s;upreme law of our nature, will then be the &s;tandard by which we may correct our fal&s;e notions of honour and plea&s;ure.&mdash;Vice will appear as it is; a violation of our nature, and a fall from its true dignity: virtue its highe&s;t ornament and perfection.</P>
<P>Animated with &s;uch principles, the youth will dare to take a higher aim in life, than the pur&s;uits of the idle rabble; will reverence his nature, and be a&s;hamed of tho&s;e &s;tains which de|grade it. He will keep his head and heart equally poi&s;ed for action; enter the bu&s;y &s;cenes of life; &s;uffer his pa&s;&s;ions to grow warm, without di&s;turbing the coolne&s;s of rea&s;on; while every grateful emotion which he feels, re&s;ulting from a manly, generous conduct, fires him with a love for virtue and every noble principle.</P>
