<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I was commanded to write the Chro|nology of the World, I was immediately after in&s;tructed by Revelation how; without which I could not, nor could any other Man on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ace of the Earth with certainty, however eminent for Wi&s;dom and Learning he might be: after it was done, the LORD GOD &s;aid to me in a vi&s;ion at night,&mdash;That is the true Age of the World, and the general computed one is erro|neous.</P>
<P>As the SCRIPTURE is the only great Foun|tain of Knowledge, or Book of written Truth in the World; as it contains the &s;acred Records of tho&s;e Things which GOD has predetermined &s;hall be hereafter&mdash;as well as tho&s;e which have been already; and as it contains the Hi&s;tory of our own Creation, with that of every living thing be&s;ides, It alone, in preference to any Man's opinion, ought to be, without the lea&s;t doubt, freely believed and confidently depend|ed on.</P>
<P>Although I am enabled, from revealed Know|ledge, to write con&s;iderably more than what this Book contains, and which, in Ju&s;tice to the Divine Spirit of Truth from whom it flows, ought to be believed; yet GOD, who in&s;tructs me in all things, that I may &s;hew an example

of preci&s;ion to the Learned, and be admired for it by the Wi&s;e; that I may give in&s;truction to the Poor, and demon&s;trate the certainty of what I do write to every Man that has the lea&s;t knowledge of his Creator, commands me to ad|ditionally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eal its Truth by that great Te&s;timo|ny of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">criptural <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vidence which no Nation can deny, and which no human Arguments can op|po&s;e.</P>
<P>Therefore, having Authority, I proceed thro' the Scripture, regularly uncovering, by reveal|ed knowledge, as I go, its &s;acred Records WHICH HAVE BEEN RESERVED FOR <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">E, holding each one up for public View, beautiful and clear to the open mind, that all Men may behold and examine them, that all men may per|ceive their Truth and admire, at this late Hour of the World, not only what was wrote by Dan|iel at Babylon, EXPLAINED IN LONDON, but likewi&s;e a &s;imilar Communication of RE|VEALED KNOWLEDGE.</P>

<P>The prophet Daniel, after de&s;cribing the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of Cyrus and Alexander, goes on to the time of Chri&s;t, the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, and how long it is to lie de&s;olate; the di&s;per&s;ion of the Jews, and how long they are to be trod un|der foot in all nations.</P>

<P>One angel was a&s;king another in the pre&s;ence of Daniel, that he might hear and be informed to write down what was &s;aid.</P>

<P>The Lord God was &s;o exceeding angry at the time of the loud thunder I have mentioned in the preceding part, that he determined to leave his other judgments unfulfilled relative to London, and burn her immediately with fire from heaven: &s;oon afterwards I was informed by revelation of what the thunder meant, and was commanded to go from London beyond the di&s;tance of eighteen miles.

<P>In addition to all that God had promi&s;ed and repeated by his angel to make me happy, he was now plea&s;ed to give me another proof of his unalterable regard, and convince me by it, that, <HI>although he could not in ju&s;tice in his recorded judgments &s;pare London,</HI> yet for my &s;ake he would &s;hew mercy to &s;ome: and take care, that by &s;ickne&s;s and other cau&s;es, to remove the per&s;ons I de&s;ired &s;hould be &s;aved, to a &s;ufficient di&s;tance beyond the limits to be de&s;troyed and &s;unk.

po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, as I thought, a heart &s;imilar to my own, I was led to entreat for him: until la&s;t year I could a&s;&s;ign no other rea&s;on for mention|ing that name than what I have given; but the true one is, that as God had determined not on|ly to keep in London the people then in it, but likewi&s;e to allow great multitudes to be drawn to it from all parts of the country, he would be found among the number to be de&s;troyed; for which, to prevent his death in &s;uch a place, the Lord God influenced me to regard him, that I might afterwards remember &s;uch a per&s;on, and be mindful of his &s;afety.</P>
<P>I am not in the lea&s;t acquainted with the man I have mentioned, whom God was plea&s;ed to di&s;tingui&s;h by &s;o great a te&s;timony of his regard, but although I am not, and our names are dif|ferent, <HI>he is, as well as my&s;elf,</HI> de&s;cended from David, king of I&s;rael.

<P>I was in a vi&s;ion, and was carried away by the Spirit of God to a field of young wheat, which was grown about four inches high from the ground: an elderly Engli&s;h woman &s;tood by me; <HI>&s;he had no covering on her head,</HI> but over her arms was an old black &s;ilk cloak; it was worn threadbare, and rent in many places.

<P>After this I ca&s;t my eyes over the &s;urface of the land; it was &s;corched to a dark brown, and frightful to look at: I could &s;ee no gra&s;s in the meadows, and the bu&s;hes in the hedges were all burnt brown; <HI>&s;o great and mighty was the heat:</HI> I could &s;ee no bea&s;ts in the fields, and the fowls of heaven were all flown away.</P>

<P>The fla&s;hes of lightning, during this thunder, which would continue many hours, would like|wi&s;e proceed from the glory of the angel, and would be, in &s;trength and colour, like the burn|ing flame.</P>
<P>This thunder would be accompanied by a vi|olent &s;torm of large hail &s;tones, which, with the lightning, would kill multitudes of people, and de&s;troy the harve&s;t in many countries.</P>

<P>The Nineteenth, Seventh, Sixteenth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth chapters, mean the &s;ame time, the &s;ame things; and are as one chapter to fulfil the judgment of God.</P>

the world with de&s;olation; but from his great mercy and regard for me, that I may be e&s;teem|ed in this country, and by all others, when I am revealed, &s;u&s;pended his judgment for a time&mdash; it hangs however over all nations.</P>
<P>Look at the age of the world; read atten|tively the chapters I have mentioned, with what I have wrote be&s;ides; and you will di&s;cover in your own brea&s;t a light, to &s;ee and believe by.</P>
<P>That <HI>light, I mean</HI> which is often called <HI>a cer|tain &s;omething,</HI> an <HI>internal monitor,</HI> that applauds man for courting wi&s;dom, for being ju&s;t, and doing good; but that never fails to reproach him for embracing folly, and doing evil: it is indeed no other than the Spirit of the living God.</P>
<P>All the prophecies given in vi&s;ions from God, are concealed from the knowledge of man by my&s;terious allu&s;ions, until the proper time, and the appointed per&s;on for them to be reveal|ed to. For it is not in the cunning of any one man, even a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the wi&s;dom of all the re&s;t on earth, to &s;earch out the deep &s;ecrets of God, or with truth to unfold the meaning of his vi|&s;ions: <HI>they are wonderful;</HI> they cannot be di&s;co|vered until God him&s;elf plea&s;es to remove the co|vering of &s;ecrecy; and, through an appointed per&s;on, ble&s;&s;es the world with a knowledge of their true meaning.</P>
<P>The fulfilling of the judgments of God, how|ever de&s;tructively they may prove to the govern|ments and nations which they are directed a|gain&s;t, are not allowed to affect my per&s;onal &s;afety, nor operate in the lea&s;t to my prejudice: for the certainty of my elevation, to the greate&s;t <HI>principality</HI> that ever will be, in the world, can|not

be prevented by the ri&s;e or fall of any hu|man power on earth; becau&s;e it is the repeated covenant of God to my forefathers, and his &s;a|cred promi&s;e now by Revelation to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The ob&s;curity of David was no objection, with a di&s;cerning God, to make him the mo|narch of I&s;rael, and afterwards promi&s;e the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to his family forever; neither is mine now to his fulfilling that promi&s;e, and holding me up to the world, as the vi&s;ible governor of the Jews. For all the works of God are won|derful, and very far exceed the capacity of man to know where they begin, how they are direc|ted, on whom, or which way they will end:&mdash; I that have more knowledge of them, and of fu|turity, revealed to me, than any other under the whole heaven, ob&s;erve the operation of ev|ery new one with more amazement than the former.</P>
<P>Therefore my pre&s;ent poverty is no ob&s;tacle to my future elevation, neither is it of much concern to my&s;elf; for the time of my being re|vealed, with power from heaven, is nigh; when God, to manife&s;t his regard, will give me favor with many, and influence all the people of Lon|don to help me.</P>
<P>I am the prophet that will be revealed to the Jews, to order their departure from all nations, to go to the land of I&s;rael, their own country, in a &s;imilar manner to Mo&s;es in Egypt, but with additional power.</P>

Such doctrine is an evi|dent proof to every di&s;cerning per&s;on, that there is a great departure, or falling away, from the true faith; to continue then in the practice, after it is explained and made public by Divine command, is preferring darkne&s;s to light, the doctrines of devils to the good words of God: it is giving a willing heed to the &s;e|ducing &s;pirits that St. Paul alludes to.

<P>When teachers, profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tianity, have their maintenance and elevation in the world, dependent on great political warlike govern|ments, and want to do, from intere&s;ted motives, what the ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel prohibits, to add plau|&s;ibility to their delu&s;ive rea&s;ons, as in the legal and religious ca&s;e of &s;wearing oaths: they go back to the law of Mo&s;es for a precedent, to ju&s;tify their apo&s;tacy and conduct. The law was for the Jews alone, under the appointed admini&s;tration of the Levites and elders, in their own country; neverthele&s;s, when &s;tran|gers acknowledged God, and &s;ubmitted to its rites, they were al&s;o allowed the freedom of its benefit; but when Chri&s;t came into the world, for the redemption of man, he aboli&s;hed the law, which was temporary, and in its place gave the Go&s;pel; which is everla&s;ting. That is, he removed the form of wor&s;hipping God by &s;acrifice; the form of coming at the truth by

&s;wearing; and that of obtaining ju&s;tice for injury, by repri&s;al and violence.</P>
<P>We all admire the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t for his humility and affection, the goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom that breathes throughout his Go&s;pel, and the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf for our &s;alvation; yet the generality of the world, as if unmind|ful of this wonderful in&s;tance of Divine love, not only refu&s;e what they promi&s;ed in bapti&s;m to obey, but likewi&s;e &s;eek, by oppo&s;ition and war, to de&s;troy his &s;alvation and happy govern|ment of peace. What does a man require from his wife in marriage, but to love and be faith|ful to him only? Would he not be jealous, and very angry, if &s;he obeyed any commands in oppo&s;ition to his, and honored another with the endearing name of hu&s;band? By the &s;ame rule, all that are baptized, are, by covenant, comparatively married to Chri&s;t; for the name of Chri&s;tian implies a belief in him, and an obe|dience to his words. Is it wi&s;e or ju&s;t then, to obey a doctrine contrary to the commands of thy ble&s;&s;ed Lord and acknowledged Savior?

<P>Hear therefore, all nations, what the Lord God commands me to write, and be warned by it; that, as a ma&s;ter is compelled to withdraw his allowance of food, and di&s;charge from his hou&s;e a &s;ervant that will not obey him, &s;o will he withdraw his loving kindne&s;s of peace, and

<HEAD><HI>PREFACE</HI> TO BOOK THE SECOND.</HEAD>
<P>LENGTH of time, change of countries and governments, corruption of language, and ha&s;ty copies in writing, before the more exact method of printing became generally u&s;ed, has been the means of not only introducing, with|out de&s;ign, into the Hebrew Bible, an in&s;ertion of &s;ome new words, but likewi&s;e an expul&s;ion of &s;ome of the old, which produces a di&s;agree|ment in &s;ome few parts, and makes it differ now from what it originally was in the times of David, Solomon, and at the commencement of the Babylonian captivity: &s;ome parts of the Engli&s;h tran&s;lation are, con&s;equently, erroneous; but they are &s;o immaterial as not to affect, in the lea&s;t, the truth of its &s;acred <HI>Records,</HI> or the tendency of its divine in&s;truction.</P>
<P>The few parts of the Engli&s;h tran&s;lation, which I am in&s;tructed to alter in my writings, the propriety will be allowed by every per&s;on that has di&s;cernment to perceive, or conviction
<PB N="lxxxviii" REF="028354_0085_0FD8AA8D63197170">
to believe:&mdash;beyond the limits of my author|ity, for it is pre&s;cribed, I am not &s;uffered to proceed in any word or in any way whatever.</P>
<P>The following are the words which the Lord God &s;poke to me in a vi&s;ion, &s;oon after I was commanded to write and make known his judg|ments, for the good of London and general benent of all nations:&mdash;There is no other man under the whole heaven that I di&s;cover the errors of the bible to, and reveal a knowledge how to correct them, &s;o that they may be re&s;tored as they were in the beginning, but your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Moreover, when I began to write I believed it nece&s;&s;ary to adopt the &s;ame language as the Scripture does, regularly imitating it in the words&mdash;ye thee, and thou; but God &s;poke to me in a vi&s;ion of the night, and &s;aid&mdash;Write in the &s;ame manner as I always &s;peak to you; write as other men do; write according to the cu&s;tom of the country you live in; you will then be better attended to, and what you write will be more ea&s;ily under&s;tood.</P>
<P>A man that has been an officer in the navy, who&s;e immediate ance&s;tors have been &s;eparated from the Jews &s;uch a con&s;iderable length of time as to make them forget they ever belonged to the name,&mdash; &s;uch a man declaring him&s;elf openly to the world a prophet of God, the re|vealed Prince allotted to order the &s;udden re|turn of the Hebrews from all nations, and gov|ern them in the land of I&s;rael, will, with &s;ome rea&s;on, I allow, excite both a&s;toni&s;hment and doubt: but from the multiplied recorded te&s;ti|monies I produce, which no other on earth can,
<PB N="lxxxix" REF="028354_0086_0FD8AA8E432F4AD8">
it ought not to prevail with any per&s;on as a ju&s;t objection again&s;t believing what I write.</P>
<P>For ob&s;erve, &s;ome ho&s;tile profe&s;&s;ion was ne|ce&s;&s;ary for me to be engaged in, to fulfil the recorded judgment on the family I am de&s;igned to repre&s;ent in the &s;eat of government; there|fore, with all the certain proofs I have and will con&s;tantly bring forward&punc; with all the ju&s;t rea|&s;ons I advance, the &s;urprize and doubt, enter|tained at the beginning, ought to vani&s;h in as little time as would be requi&s;ite to read again the book which contains the account.</P>
<P>But remember likewi&s;e, from the records of Scripture, that Mo&s;es was taken away in his infancy, and remained &s;eparated from his bre|thren for eighty years; the fir&s;t forty of which he was reared in the palace of the king of Egypt, and educated in the language and cu&s;|toms of the country like one of its own native princes; yet he was revealed to the I&s;raelites as the prophet of God, to order their ha&s;ty de|parture from Pharaoh's bondage, and after|wards to conduct them to the Promi&s;ed Land.</P>
<P>SAUL, the &s;on of Ki&s;h, after being anointed king, prophecied in company with other men, to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of all that &s;aw him.</P>

<P>IN the fir&s;t year of Bel&s;hazzar, king of Ba|bylon, Daniel had a dream, and vi&s;ions in the night on his bed; then he wrote the vi&s;ions, to &s;hew the &s;ub&s;tance of what they contained.</P>
<P N="2">2 Daniel &s;pake and &s;aid; I &s;aw in my vi&s;ion by night, and behold, the four winds of the heaven &s;trove on the great &s;ea.</P>
<P N="3">3 And <HI>four great bea&s;ts</HI> came up from the &s;ea, different one from another.</P>
<P N="4">4 The fir&s;t was like a lion, and it had eagle's wings: I beheld 'till the wings were plucked, when it was lifted up on the earth, and made &s;tand on the feet as a man; and a man's heart was given to it.</P>
<P>The lion means George the Third, the pre|&s;ent king of England; plucking the wings of the lion, means taking away the power of the king, made &s;tand on the feet as a man, with a man's heart, means his reduction to the con|dition of other men,&mdash;and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;imilar thoughts.</P>
<P>It is more than twenty months &s;ince I fir&s;t wrote to the king, queen, and mini&s;ter of &s;tate, to inform them of many things that would come to pa&s;s; that the time was nearly accom|pli&s;hed for &s;ome of the judgments of Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be made manife&s;t, and al&s;o that this prophecy was fulfilling: I be&s;eeched them in the mo&s;t earne&s;t and re&s;pectful language, not to join in the war

on any account whatever, or even encourage it, for the death of Louis the Sixteenth would be impo&s;&s;ible to prevent, it was recorded, and could not be avoided; the revolution in France, and its con&s;equences proceeded entirely from the judgment of God to fulfil this prophecy of Daniel: therefore all attempts to overthrow the judgment, and pre&s;erve the monarchy by force, was oppo&s;ing what was determined in the Scripture of Truth &s;hould mo&s;t certainly take place.</P>
<P>The a&s;pect of the war was delu&s;ive, the en|couragements of &s;ucce&s;s that it held out to prin|ces were deceitful; but tho&s;e encouragements of delu&s;ion were permitted, to bring many na|tions under the judgment of God, and puni&s;h them for the heavy guilt of oppo&s;ing his decrees.</P>
<P>If many had no more to fight again&s;t than a few men alone, or nations but one divi|ded nation to &s;ubdue, then it might with rea&s;on be expected that the greate&s;t number would &s;oon overcome the lea&s;t, and that many &s;trong nations would &s;oon conquer a weak one: but it is many men fighting again&s;t the Spirit of God, and &s;trong nations laboring in vain with their blood and trea&s;ure to overthrow his Judgment.</P>
<P>The Lord God permits this oppo&s;ition for three years and a half, to fulfil the determined part of this prophecy on all that oppo&s;e it;&mdash; that done, his judgments will take place, to puni&s;h man and lay wa&s;te kingdoms.</P>

<P N="12">12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written that no man knew but he him&s;elf.</P>

<P N="6">6 After this I beheld, and &s;o, another like a leopard: which had on its back four wings of a fowl; the bea&s;t had al&s;o four heads, and do|minion was given to it.</P>
<P>The Leopard, means Louis the Sixteenth king of France: the wings of a fowl on its back, are, like the eagle's on the lion, an allu&s;ion to the king's great moveable power.</P>
<P>The fall of this monarch from a throne, and afterwards &s;uffering death, to fulfil the judg|ment of God by his prophet Daniel, was impo&s;|&s;ible for all the armies of Europe to prevent; equally &s;o as the decreed death of Charles the Fir&s;t, king of England, which is mentioned by St. John in the thirteenth chapter and third ver&s;e of the Revelation; <HI>the deadly wound being healed,</HI> in the &s;ame ver&s;e, means the <HI>recovery</HI> of monarchy <HI>by the re&s;toration</HI> of Charles the Second.</P>

<P>This great bea&s;t, &s;o different from the others, means the pre&s;ent emperor of Germany; the ten horns, mean the electors, or princes of the empire.</P>
<P>In one part of this chapter the horns are de|nominated kings; the rea&s;on is, they rai&s;e ar|mies, go to war, and govern with ab&s;olute

power, like them; but notwith&s;tanding, they all acknowledge the emperor as their chief, and under that acknowledgment of &s;ubjection are &s;o|lentaly engaged to defend his empire when cal|led on. For which to conceal the meaning of the prophecy, until the fulne&s;s of time comes and the appointed per&s;on for it to be revealed to, the vi&s;ion repre&s;ents the German princes as horns of defence belonging to the emperor's head.</P>
<P>It devoured, broke in pieces, and &s;tamped on the re&s;idue with its feet&mdash;means the entire de&s;truction of the German electors; and tho po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their territories by the emperor: he will de&s;troy them, and al&s;o &s;pread his do|minion over Italy; threatening at the &s;ame time all Europe, and de&s;pi&s;ing its kings with their feeble efforts to oppo&s;e him.

After this, to fulfil the pro|phecy and the judgment of God, he will &s;uffer death from the hands of man.</P>

<P>The information, as will be plainly &s;een by the date, which I gave to the <HI>king</HI> and <HI>mini&s;ter of &s;tate,</HI> with what I was commanded to offer to the parliament, was not only before the pre|&s;ent war with France was entered into, but al&s;o &s;ome length of time before it was ever intended:

<P>Change times and laws: the meaning of which is, that what God decrees is his law, and this prophecy contains it; an oppo&s;ition by the <HI>king of Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> to what God has decreed &s;hall come to pa&s;s, is endeavoring by force of arms to &s;top the cour&s;e of the prophecy, and change the decreed time for it to be fulfilled. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia, by threatening, with the great &s;trength of his army, to build up, what God, to fulfil this prophecy, has thrown down; to re|&s;tore that monarchy in France, which God, to fulfil his recorded judgment in this prophecy, has removed for ever;&mdash;is the meaning of&mdash; <HI>And he will think to change times and laws.</HI></P>
<P>And they will be given into his hand, for a time and times, and the dividing of time.

But my prayers pre|vailed with God, even again&s;t his own recorded judgment by Daniel, for I be&s;eeched him to op|po&s;e the unju&s;t de&s;igns of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, before he invaded France, after he had, to &s;u&s;pend the prophecy, and for my &s;ake to turn him back.

<P>This promi&s;e was fulfilled in the year 1792; for, &s;oon after the Pru&s;&s;ian army entered France, God led it into &s;uch difficult places as to endan|ger its &s;afety; he al&s;o &s;ent the vi&s;itation of a wa&s;ting &s;ickne&s;s that forced it to go away, a&s;hamed and highly di&s;appointed.

<P>That intelligent, internal monitor, was in truth no other than the compa&s;&s;ionate Spirit of the living God, &s;triving, to the la&s;t moment, to &s;ave a falling man from the dreadful effects of his own judgment: but the king of Pru&s;&s;ia de|&s;pi&s;ed the ble&s;&s;ed intimation, and re&s;olved on a war; which, if there was no knowledge of God in the world, no part of human rea&s;on could find the lea&s;t colorable pretence to ju&s;tify.</P>

<P>As I knew, in the beginning of 1792, that the king of England would enter into this war, and by doing &s;o, fall under the &s;ame judgment from God as the other monarchs &s;hewn in the vi&s;ion, unle&s;s I could, by a ju&s;t explanation of the prophecies, per&s;uade him to remain at peace; he will, I tru&s;t, with the queen and mini&s;ter of &s;tate, do me the ju&s;tice hereafter to acknow|ledge that the danger was fully communicated: and that I did not cea&s;e in my endeavors to pre|vent him from joining in the confederacy again&s;t France, not only for a long time before he in|tended it, but al&s;o after he had, even till the de&s;igns of government were ready to be execu|ted by open preparations for ho&s;tility.</P>

<P>The Lord God commands me to acknowledge the kindne&s;s of a poor woman, that brought me a three-penny loaf each week, every Monday morning, when I was in pri&s;on: Her name is I&s;abella Wake. The pri&s;on is Newgate.</P>

<P>The &s;mall, very &s;mall pennyworth of bread, with water only, except one day in the week, when there are a few ounces of beef, for twen|ty-four hours, is barely &s;ufficient to keep life and body together.

<P>When the condition of pri&s;ons, and the treat|ment of pri&s;oners, is required for public inform|ation, it is from the poor man, who&s;e health is injured by confinement, who has to draw his little air through a &s;mall iron-barred window, who has but a &s;mall pennyworth of bread al|lowed

At that time, after mentioning the name of William Pitt, I pa&s;&s;ed by that of his brother; immedi|ately after, the Lord God reminded me of it, and, in a voice of great &s;oftne&s;s and good na|ture, &s;aid, There is <HI>John Pitt,</HI> wont you mention him? You dont know who he is <HI>I forgave.</HI></P>
<P>In the year of 1790 the Spirit of God begun fir&s;t, (although I always had a pre&s;entiment of being &s;ometime or other very great,) to en|lighten my under&s;tanding, and teach me to di&s;|tingui&s;h right from wrong. At that time I was an officer in the navy, and con&s;idering that vol|untary &s;wearing, which I was obliged to comply with every &s;ix months as a qualification to receive my pay, was unnece&s;&s;ary, unju&s;t, and wicked, I reque&s;ted to be indulged with permi&s;|&s;ion to receive it without; &s;tating at the &s;ame time, the concealed and unheeded cruelty of the oath, with my own rea&s;ons for objecting to the form: when I was told, in an&s;wer to my reque&s;t, that there was an order of council to take the oath, and that it was not in the power of the admiralty to di&s;pen&s;e with it.</P>
<P>Soon after this I made another reque&s;t, &s;up|porting my objections to voluntary &s;wearing, with ob&s;erving. That if the <HI>order of council</HI> en|forced an oath in any manner or under any form whatever, and that the man it was directed to operate on, &s;wore that he was not forced, but that the oath he took was a voluntary act&mdash;<HI>the re&s;ult of his own free will,</HI>&mdash;would it not in the &s;ight of God in heaven, and every <HI>man</HI> of di&s;+cernment

under him on earth, amoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to a fal&s;e oath?</P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;ons with the&s;e objections, and the letter I received from the admiralty, &s;tating their in&s;ufficient power to di&s;pen&s;e with the u&s;u|al form of &s;wearing, I publi&s;hed at that time in the new&s;paper called the <HI>Public Adverti&s;er.</HI></P>
<P>During the time of my writing officially to the Admiralty I had occa&s;ion to write al&s;o to the pre&s;ident, whom I knew to be a member of the council; with the bu&s;ine&s;s of Swearing, which led me to make an application, I remark|ed to him, That as men, whether few in number or the increa&s;ed multitude of a &s;enate were not infallible, they mu&s;t con&s;equently be &s;ubject to error. To corroborate more forcibly this a&s;|&s;ertion, and likewi&s;e to impre&s;s a conviction of its ju&s;tice, I mentioned among other things, a deci&s;ion of the privy council relative to a native of Gla&s;gow, who had his &s;hip &s;eized in the We&s;t Indies for an <HI>unde&s;igned</HI> infringement of the Navigation act.</P>
<P>After a legal inve&s;tigation in that country, it was clearly proved, and openly acknowledged, that although the apparent defect in the regi&s;ter might authorize the &s;eizure, it could not ju&s;tify a condemnation; becau&s;e the commander, <HI>like an hone&s;t man,</HI> &s;hewed it at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and received the approbation of the principal officer.</P>
<P>An appeal was lodged again&s;t this acquittal, by the &s;eizing officer in the We&s;t Indies, and brought before the Privy Council in England! &mdash;the &s;hip was condemned.</P>
<P>To con&s;titute a High Court of Equity, its
<PB N="150" REF="028354_0147_0FD8A94363A601D0">
members, to pronounce their judgment agreea|ble to that very name their exi&s;tence as a court is derived from, mu&s;t be governed more by the <HI>Intention</HI> than the pre&s;umptive proof. But to con&s;titute a Court of Law, its judges mu&s;t be directed by the expre&s;s letter of the act of par|liament under which they officiate.</P>
<P>For example, two men go into a fore&s;t; while the one is fetching a blow to cut down a tree, the axe flies from the handle and kills the other: Here is a pre&s;umptive proof of murder, and the law very ju&s;tly brings the &s;urvivor to trial. But <HI>equity,</HI> viewing this circum&s;tance in a proper light, declares the innocence, and acquits ac|cordingly.</P>
<P>Another, and more revelant to the &s;eizure.&mdash; A man buys a &s;tamp, to legalize a bond for the better &s;ecurity of trading with his money, <HI>or in plainer language, lending it on intere&s;t;</HI> to be certain that this &s;tamp is warrantably ju&s;t, ac|cording to the pre&s;cribed forms of law, he &s;hews it at the Stamp-office, where it is ac|knowledged to be good and &s;afe: after this, in con&s;equence of &s;ome defect, it is declared illegal, and the holder &s;ubjected to a penalty.</P>
<P>I believe every man on earth, that has the common faculty of di&s;tingui&s;hing white from black, will agree with me in &s;aying, that it would be repugnant to equity to fine the holder for a defect that he had no knowledge of as &s;uch, and for what was authori&s;ed by the very office of government that always i&s;&s;ued the &s;tamps.</P>
<P>The law &s;uppo&s;es criminality from the ap|pearance; but equity mea&s;ures it from the de|&s;ign. The one is external and vi&s;ible, provided
<PB N="151" REF="028354_0148_0FD8A9480E575F18">
many years before it may be wanted: the other is internal and &s;piritual, always alive in the heart of every judge that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es prudence, learning, and penetration.</P>
<P>When I was writing of the&s;e things, to the Earl of Chatham, on my knees! made a &s;olemn vow to the Almighty God, declaring that if he would be plea&s;ed to enable me, I would mo&s;t &s;urely procure an inde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nification for the poor man that lo&s;t his &s;hip.

<P>After making the numerous repre&s;entations I have mentioned, the Earl of Chatham, with great propriety, acknowledged their ju&s;tice &s;o far as to era&s;e the word <HI>Voluntary</HI> from the pre|&s;cribed form of &s;wearing: but I was then re|minded of the words of Chri&s;t in the 5th chap|ter, 34th ver&s;e of St. Matthew, and &s;trictly commanded to obey them. Soon after this, I reque&s;ted from the Admiralty, and often repeated it, a di&s;pen&s;ing order that I might receive my pay without an oath; but they would not grant it.</P>
<P>If the Earl of Chatham had &s;hewn me the &s;mall favour I a&s;ked for, and certainly it would have been but a very &s;mall one to him, he &s;hould be held up to the world, at my friend,

<P>As the Admiralty would not give me that rea&s;onable indulgence I reque&s;ted, as they would not &s;hew me that kindne&s;s which as men living by the navy, they might have done with ea&s;e, and without prejudice to their dignity; I want|ed for a bit of bread to eat: I was be&s;ides treat|ed &s;o ill, as to be dragged to a work-hou&s;e with|out any legal authority, again&s;t every remon|&s;trance I could make, and again&s;t every threat I could make u&s;e of to call them to a &s;trict ac|count for the inju&s;tice. The Admiralty knew all this; they might have prevented it, by or|dering what was due to me to be paid; but they would neither prevent the evil, nor enable me to be liberated: they would not order the pay|ment of what was due, until open fal&s;ehood was made u&s;e of to &s;ay I was out of my &s;en&s;es. It &s;eemed as if they were under &s;ome private ap|prehen&s;ion, though plea&s;ed with my di&s;tre&s;s, of being charged one day or other in the eyes of their country with unfeeling cruelty, and want|ed &s;ome kind of colourable evidence to ju&s;tify the proceeding.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="visions">
<HEAD>The following are &s;ome more of the <HI>VISIONS,</HI> which God &s;hewed me, and which I am command|ed to publi&s;h here.</HEAD>
<P>IN the month called July, 1791, I was in a vi&s;ion, and was carried away by the &s;pirit of God, to the &s;ea coa&s;t, in the Engli&s;h channel&mdash; a new ridge of unknown land was brought in an in&s;tant plain to my eyes, while the finger of a hand wrote, in large capital letters, with great quickne&s;s, and a voice pronounced twice from heaven, at the &s;ame time,
<Q>SWEDE, SWEDE!</Q></P>
<P>After this I was in a vi&s;ion in the month of January 1792, and was carried away by the Spirit of God to Sweden, when I was made look through a window in a room; I did, and &s;aw a man walk from the &s;ide of a great chair, lea|ving it empty. I could not &s;ee his face as he went away, and although I could not, nor per|ceive that he had committed any crime, I thought with my&s;elf that he had been doing wrong. Immediately the angel that &s;tood by me &s;aid, The chair means the chair of &s;tate;&mdash; and that man you &s;aw will make it empty. The king of Sweden is <HI>delivered over for death,</HI> and that is the very man that will &s;hoot him.</P>
<P>The prince of Orange is clo&s;ely pur&s;ued like|wi&s;e, but he is not delivered over yet.</P>
<P>After this I was in a vi&s;ion, and &s;aw the Pru&s;&s;ian eagle perched on a chair of &s;tate; &s;oon
<PB N="160" REF="028354_0157_0FD8A95B6468EC40">
after, on a &s;udden, I &s;aw the chair, the hou&s;e, and the whole city where the chair &s;tood, in flames. The angel that was near me, &s;aid, He is likewi&s;e pur&s;ued now.</P>
<P>After this I was in a vi&s;ion, and the Lord God talked with me, and &s;aid, I give you the life of the Swede; but know this for certain, that if you prevent his death, the man him&s;elf will not believe there was any danger of it.&mdash; And when you write hereafter of things in this country, you will be called an impo&s;tor, a fool, and a liar: you will be impri&s;oned, and treat|ed very ill. When I &s;ee this, it will make me angry; I will then begin to kill the people, and I will &s;urely de&s;troy this city.</P>
<P>For which I gave no public information to warn the king of Sweden, and prevent his death. Had this man lived, he would have commanded the German army again&s;t France; his private plan was to go through Normandy, clo&s;e by the &s;ea coa&s;t, to be &s;upplied the ea&s;ier with provi|&s;ions from England, and endeavour, by all po&s;|&s;ible means, to take the harbour of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re&s;t.</P>
<P>He &s;aid to him&s;elf, in his own clo&s;er. This is the plan I will pur&s;ue; it will be giving a mor|tal blow to the French navy, and getting a &s;afe harbour for our own &s;hips.</P>
<P>All this was made known to me by revelation from the Lord God; and which I communicated to the queen and mini&s;ter of &s;tate in 1792, &s;ome+time before the provinces of Brittany and Nor|mandy &s;hewed any open appearance of ho&s;tility again&s;t the pre&s;ent government of France.</P>
<P>In the month of April 1793, I was in a vi&s;ion, and was carried away in the &s;pirit of God in Ru&s;&s;ia, where I &s;aw a Bear &s;top and re&s;t it&s;elf
<PB N="161" REF="028354_0158_0FD8A95F338F2C48">
under a large tree; &s;oon after I beheld a man, that lay concealed among the branches, drop down &s;oftly, and with a &s;harp piece of iron, which he held in his hand, &s;tab the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear; pro|nouncing, as he did &s;o, I have watched a long time for you, but now I have caught you at la&s;t.</P>
<P>I know by revelation from the Lord God, that this vi&s;ion means the pre&s;ent empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia; for which, being permitted, I give her this warning.</P>
<P>Let the death of the kings of Sweden and France, which is but a little time pa&s;t; the death of the king of Spain and another, which will &s;oon take place, for they are pur&s;ued; con|vince the princes and the people of Europe, that the &s;eventh chapter of Daniel and the &s;e|cond of Haggai are now fulfilling.</P>
<P>At a former time, when the Lord God was in&s;tructing me in a knowledge of the laws and other things, relative to the nation I am ap|pointed to govern, he &s;aid, in a vi&s;ion of the night, When I bring princes and people from all nations to bow down to you; when I begin to exalt you above the kings of the earth&mdash;Be &s;ober, be mode&s;t, be rea&s;onable. And immedi|ately after he added, You may inform the king of England that I call you my nephew.</P>
<P>On the 3d of March, 1794, I was in a vi&s;ion and &s;aw the &s;un in its full &s;trength, clear and high up in the firmament: &s;oon after I &s;aw ano|ther &s;un ri&s;e on a &s;udden, equally large as the former, and &s;tand clo&s;e by it: both &s;hone with equal brightne&s;s, and the la&s;t, as well as the fir&s;t, enlightened the world.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t divi&s;ion of this copy was &s;ent.

to be printed, and even &s;ome of it done, the printer was advi&s;ed not to do it according to my form; for, if he did, pro&s;ecution, impri&s;on|ment, and perhaps hanging, would be the con|&s;equence to him. For which the Lord God com|mands me to keep back the additional informa|tion that otherways would be given, and termi|nate the book.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid already that the &s;ixth chapter of the Revelation was now fulfilling: the <HI>four fir&s;t &s;eals</HI> are opened, and the covering, which kept the meaning of the prophecies a profound &s;ecret until the pre&s;ent time, is removed: the <HI>recorded</HI> decrees are held up, and God him&s;elf commands a knowledge, of their contents to be publi&s;hed for the good of all nations. But if I cannot have the commands of God, and a knowledge of his judgments, printed exactly as I write, how is this exten&s;ion of mercy to be known o|ver Europe, and the people of London inform|ed of any danger that is pa&s;t, or any danger that is to come? All the prophecies in the Scripture were given through men: the Nine-inevites were warned through one.</P>
<P>How is the king to &s;ave him&s;elf from that <HI>re|corded,</HI> determined, and unavoidable death,&mdash; which all the powers of armies cannot pre|vent? How is London and the parliament to be &s;aved, when they are recorded in the Scripture of truth to be de&s;troyed? How is England, Eu|rope, and mo&s;t parts of the world to be &s;aved, when they are recorded to be filled with blood by war, and to be made de&s;olate for ever by earthquakes if the per&s;on I employ is deterred, by the fears of pro&s;ecution and evil, from print|ing the full copy, exactly as I give it&punc;</P>

<P>The king of England, the chancellor of the Exchequer, &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, other members of admini&s;tration, and as many members of both hou&s;es of parliament, as my ability will allow; the bi&s;hops, judges and all the foreign amba&s;&s;adors in London; will have a book &s;ent to each.</P>
<P>On account of my being in&s;ulted, becau&s;e the Jews do not believe in the fir&s;t book, by a pub|lic acknowledgment of it, the Lord God com|mands me to remind all men of what is wrote in that book, and to &s;ay, that as the Jews do not believe in Chri&s;t, it cannot be expected that they will in me; <HI>neither are they,</HI> until I am re|vealed in a &s;imilar manner to Mo&s;es in Egypt, but with the additional power of &s;ire as his &s;ign, to make them.</P>
<P>The night before I had fini&s;hed this book for the pre&s;s, the Lord God &s;hewed it to me in a vi&s;ion, ready printed, holding it up at the &s;ame time by one leaf, and &s;haking all the others open, while he pronounced, in &s;trong clear words, and commanded me to write them down exactly as he &s;poke, for univer&s;al information:</P>

<P N="29">29 Then fled Mo&s;es at this &s;aying, and was a &s;tranger in the land of Midian, where he be|gat two &s;ons.</P>
<P N="30">30 And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him, in the wilderne&s;s of mount Sina, an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bu&s;h.</P>
<P N="31">31, 32 Saying I am the God of thy fa|thers, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="37">37 This is that Mo&s;es, which &s;aid to the children of I&s;rael, a prophet &s;hall the Lord your God rai&s;e up unto you, of your brethren, like unto me.</P>
<P>This is he <HI>(meaning Mo&s;es &s;till, and not the prophet alluded to in the preceding ver&s;e; who was not Chri&s;t neither, as has always been erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed)</HI> that was in the church, (meaning the tabernacle) in the wilderne&s;s <HI>with the angel</HI> which &s;poke <HI>to him</HI> in mount Sinai.</P>
<P N="39">39 To whom our fathers would not obey&mdash; (meaning Mo&s;es) but thru&s;t him from them, (meaning Mo&s;es: often did he fa&s;t, and pray, that God might not de&s;troy the congregation,) and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt.</P>
<P>Who was the con&s;picuous per&s;on that the an|gel con&s;tantly accompanied, manife&s;ted him&s;elf to, and talked with during forty years in the wilderne&s;s, according to the 38th ver&s;e, but

Mo&s;es? Who did the angel &s;peak to in mount Sinai from a flame of fire in a bu&s;h? St. Stephen meant no other here than Mo&s;es.</P>

<P>Expounders of the Scriptures have always &s;uppo&s;ed that St. Stephen, by repeating in this chapter the ver&s;es I have in&s;erted from Deuter|onomy, meant Chri&s;t to be the prophet alluded to by Mo&s;es, which is, <HI>like him&s;elf,</HI> to collect and lead home the Jews; but he does not; he re|peats it as in hi&s;torical account, to remind the council, before which he &s;tood for judgment, that as their fathers had before rejected Mo&s;es in the wilderne&s;s, &s;o did they their children re|ject Chri&s;t at Jeru&s;alem. But in no one part does he, or St. Peter in the 3d chapter, mean that Chri&s;t is the prophet alluded to by Mo&s;es in the eighteenth chapter of Deuteronomy,&mdash;<HI>as the fortieth ver&s;e even &s;ufficiently te&s;tifies.</HI></P>

<HEAD>REVELATION TO ST. JOHN, CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<P>St. John the Apo&s;tle in this chapter de&s;cribes a woman as cloathed with the &s;un, <HI>the moon under her feet, (meaning darkne&s;s, or the Turk|i&s;h empire in A&s;ia,)</HI> and a crown of twelve &s;tars on her head. The &s;un alluded to is not the &s;un in the firmament, neither is that &s;un the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as has been always errone|ou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed.

The prince is repre&s;ented as a &s;un, becau&s;e that through him God will enlighten the world with more know|ledge than ever it had yet, and give a fre&s;h manife&s;tation of his mercy to prolong its dura|tion.

<P>The child, <HI>who will govern all nations immedi|ately under and next to God,</HI> being caught up to God and to his throne, means no more than the child going up to Jeru&s;alem, where the throne of God will be on earth.

<HEAD>More of the <HI>VISIONS,</HI> which God &s;hewed me, and which I am now commanded to publi&s;h.</HEAD>
<P>IN the month called June, 1791, at the hour of two in the afternoon, I &s;aw a hand, from the wri&s;t downwards, like the hand of a man, with the fore finger pointed out, appear on a &s;udden a little above the height of my head, near the door, on the wall or partition of the room I was then in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> After this I was informed, by revela|tion, at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ght, from the Lord God, that it meant the &s;peedy end of the pre&s;ent king of England and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pire, like Bel&s;hazzar and Babylon, both of which would &s;oon be de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>In the month called May, 1792, I was in a vi&s;ion, and receiving in&s;truction from God of fu|ture things: he &s;hewed me the queen, greatly alarmed at his judgments, by my revelation, with the power of f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and immediately &s;he cried out, The Lord have mercy on us! we &s;hall all be de&s;troyed, we &s;hall all be de&s;troyed! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> After this I was in a vi&s;ion again, and the Lord God &s;hewed me the pre&s;ent queen of Eng|land, coming towards me, &s;low, trembling, and

<P>In the beginning of the month of June, 1792, I was in a vi&s;ion, and was carried away, by the Spirit of God, to the palace called St. James's, where I &s;aw the pre&s;ent king of England; he ro&s;e from his &s;eat on &s;eeing me, and immediate|ly &s;ent me his own magnificent &s;tar, at the &s;ame time breathing on it, and ki&s;&s;ing, as if ki&s;&s;ing to take a la&s;t farewel; yet not with grief and re|luctance to give, but with evident &s;atisfaction. Why the king of England &s;hould take his own con&s;picuous ornament, and &s;end it to me, was a thing that I was greatly a&s;toni&s;hed at; I wi&s;hed to know the meaning, but could not di&s;cover; until a loud voice pronounced, down from hea|ven, The Lord God delivers his life over into your hands, and he will give you any thing to pre&s;erve it. This vi&s;ion, with others, and other things, was communicated, by Divine command, to the king, in 1792. The letter, which con|tained it, with others to the king, the queen, and the chancellor of the Exchequer, were put into the penny-po&s;t office, to be &s;ent by that convey|ance, according to the directions I received on that head by revelation from God.</P>
<P>1794. This day, called Thur&s;day, and the 12th of the month called June, I was in a vi&s;ion, at the hour of two in the afternoon, when the Lord God &s;poke to me in a voice of great quick|ne&s;s, carrying me away to the Bank of England at the &s;ame time, and &s;aying, There is one of

<P>The 13th, in the morning, the Lord God &s;aid to me, among other things, in a vi&s;ion, You &s;ee tho&s;e people do not believe, neither will they for all your endeavours; why then do you con|tinue to entreat me for them?</P>
<P>The 14th, in the morning, the Lord God &s;poke to me, and &s;aid, The judgment is now again&s;t this nation; the thunder, ju&s;t pa&s;t, was to proclaim it: Pharaoh is appointed to die, and his government to be de&s;troyed; the prie&s;ts, and all the abominable idolatries of Egypt, &s;hall peri&s;h, never to be found any more.</P>

<P>Swearing oaths; the Lord's &s;upper, or taking the &s;acrament to remember him and commemo|rate the awful moment when he gave it to his di&s;ciples, is made a qualification, even to the mo&s;t unthinking, abandoned, and wicked, to &s;erve in any public office or employment whatever.</P>
<P>Of the public prayers. Our Father, which art in heaven; hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; <HI>which is the kingdom of peace;</HI> is very good: but the next form of prayer is be&s;eeching God to go forth with fleets and ar|mies: this is very bad, becau&s;e it is in direct oppo&s;ition to the former; it encourages &s;trife, hatred, war, and blood&s;hed; it is calling on God to keep back his kingdom, and to over|throw his own go&s;pel of peace.

<P>As there is in truth no Lord but God, no man ought to a&s;&s;ume his &s;acred name.

A prince may give to a man a title, but it is God only that can make him Spiritual: he cannot give that mighty Spirit which he has not the power to command, and which he never recei|ved the gift of him&s;elf. To pur&s;ue then any longer &s;uch a fal&s;e form of ordination and con|&s;ecration, is not only di&s;honorable to the king, parliament, and people of England, but al&s;o a reproach to the bi&s;hops to attempt to give, and to the clergy to kneel down to receive.</P>
<P>Turn from &s;uch deceitful unmanly ways, and endeavor to live long; for it is the word of God through a man that points at the crime, and warns you to for&s;ake, what mu&s;t, if you do not, lead to certain death: for believe me, the

<P>Look at your wives, your children, and all that is dear to you on earth; then con&s;ider how great the ble&s;&s;ing to have them, to live with, and po&s;&s;e&s;s them; but how terrible the evil to &s;eparate, to be burnt with fire&mdash;to die, and lo&s;e them for ever.</P>
<P>Remember, God created man in his own image and likene&s;s, and created the earth for his u&s;e; that man might believe in him, and obey his commands.</P>
<P>He brought the children of I&s;rael out of Egypt to conduct them to the promi&s;ed land,&mdash; but when they di&s;obeyed him in the wilderne&s;s, he de&s;troyed thou&s;ands of them. He burnt So|dom and Gomorrah, becau&s;e the people were wicked; but he &s;aved Nineveh, which was al&s;o denounced, becau&s;e the people repented.</P>
<P>The Lord God is great, merciful, and com|pa&s;&s;ionate to forgive all that do entreat and obey his commands; but be a&s;&s;ured, he is al&s;o great, mighty, and powerful, jealous of his &s;a|cred name and honor when given to men: and he can do now what he did of old, <HI>they are re|corded for our example and warning,</HI> that is, overthrow cities,&mdash;and de&s;troy multitudes in an in&s;tant.</P>

<P N="46">46 Then &s;aid I to the angel, What young per&s;on is that which crowns them, and gives them palms in their hands.

<P>This bea&s;t means the Engli&s;h Monarchy; and it is by &s;hips and commerce that it has ro&s;e from the &s;ea to &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing grandeur and magnitude. The heads, horns, and crowns, allude to the many departments of Government, and their &s;plendid di&s;tinctions. The Bla&s;phemy means the titles given to, and a&s;&s;umed by the King of England; &s;uch as, Our Mo&s;t Gracious
<PB N="201" REF="028354_0198_0FD8C2B82FD22C18">
Sovereign Lord, Sacred Per&s;on, Maje&s;ty, De|fender of the Faith, and Supreme Head of the Church; all which names belong to God, he only can be what they expre&s;s, and when they are applied to any other, the &s;in is Bla&s;phemy in his &s;ight.</P>
<P N="2">2 And the bea&s;t which I &s;aw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power and his &s;eat, and great authority.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h Monarchy, for being Supreme Head of the Church, and over the many reli|gious &s;ects tolerated in the country, is the rea&s;on that it is, for their great number, com|pared to a leopard full of &s;pots.</P>
<P>As a bear is very &s;trong on his feet, &s;o is the Engli&s;h Monarchy: and as a lion roars with his mouth the loude&s;t of any bea&s;t, &s;o does the Engli&s;h Monarchy proclaim its greatne&s;s more than any other.</P>
<P N="3">3 And I &s;aw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the bea&s;t.</P>
<P>The beginning of this ver&s;e means the death of Charles the Fir&s;t King of England: and the deadly wound being healed, means the recovery of Monarchy by the re&s;toration of Charles the Second. During the interval of time between the death and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, all the world won|dered if the Engli&s;h Monarchy would ever be re&s;tored again.</P>

the &s;word. Here is the patience and the faith of the &s;aints.</P>
<P>The leading into captivity means impri&s;on|ment and &s;lavery: and killing with the &s;word, means violence and war. The patience of the &s;aints is, to bear quietly with tho&s;e evils, and to re&s;i&s;t the temptations of wealth to do them: All that have faith in God will not do &s;uch things, from a belief that they are offen&s;ive, becau&s;e he commands them not.</P>
<P N="11">11 And I beheld another bea&s;t coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he &s;pake as a dragon.</P>
<P>This ver&s;e means the Elector of Hanover.&mdash; Coming up out of the earth, is to &s;ignify that his country or government is &s;ituated inland. The horns of a lamb, and the voice of a dragon, mean, that although he is weak in power like a lamb, yet by his voice he can threaten in great and mighty words like a dragon.</P>
<P N="12">12 And he exerci&s;eth all the power of the fir&s;t bea&s;t before him, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It means the Elector of Hanover's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, place, and power of the former King of England. To fulfil this part of the prophecy given by Revelation to St. John, the utter expul&s;ion of the Stuart family mu&s;t again&s;t all human oppo&s;ition have taken place to admit the Elector of Hanover.</P>
<P>A great part of this chapter is taken up in de&s;cribing the king and parliament. I am com|manded to inform both of the recorded judg|ments of God,&mdash;the dangers which threaten them, and their certainty of taking place, un|le&s;s they implore him for mercy, and obtain it.</P>

<P>Without &s;ubmitting to the forms of law pre|&s;cribed by act of parliament, which are in direct oppo&s;ition to the commands of Chri&s;t, and very &s;inful to do, no man can hold any place of profit or tru&s;t, enjoy the privilege of freedom, and comparatively to buy or &s;ell.</P>
<P N="17">17 And that no man might buy or &s;ell, &s;ave he that had the mark, or the name of the bea&s;t, or the number of his name.</P>
<P N="18">18 Here is wi&s;dom. Let him that has un|der&s;tanding count the number of the bea&s;t; for it is the number of a man; and his number is &s;ix hundred three&s;core and &s;ix.</P>
<P>This ver&s;e means the Engli&s;h parliament;&mdash; and although it exceeds the number mentioned here, yet, notwith&s;tanding, it is the real and very a&s;&s;embly of men alluded to in the Reve|lation, by the number of 666.</P>

<HEAD><HI>ANECDOTES</HI> OF RICHARD BROTHERS, <HI>THE PROPHET.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">[From the Regi&s;ter of the Times, for March, <HI>1795.</HI>]</HEAD>
<P>THIS extraordinary character having, for &s;ome months pa&s;t, been the theme of the public in general, induces us to &s;tate &s;ome par|ticulars re&s;pecting him, that, we tru&s;t, will gratify the curio&s;ity of our readers. To &s;ee a man ri&s;ing from the humble &s;tate of a work-hou&s;e, to that of a per&s;on attracting the atten|tion of all ranks and degrees, for his prophetic a&s;&s;ertions, has ju&s;tly excited a&s;toni&s;hment. Let him be a madman, enthu&s;ia&s;t, or hypocrite, he mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t extraordinary man this century has produced. To cau&s;e the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed divines to he&s;itate in their opinions, re&s;pecting the truth or fal&s;ehood of his &s;criptural expo&s;itions, is, &s;urely, in an untu|tored
<PB N="2" REF="028354_0208_0FD8C2E0D59D18A8">
man, a mo&s;t wonderful trait of character. Allowing him to be a hypocrite, to blind an appearance of truth &s;o artfully, with the reality of fal&s;ehood, as to confound the mo&s;t learned in &s;cripture, evinces a faculty that few men, how|ever powerful in the arts of delu&s;ion, in the cour&s;e of ages, are found to po&s;&s;e&s;s. As a mad|man, there is &s;uch an urbanity of manners, &s;uch a piety of principle, &s;uch a forbearance of &s;elf-gratification, &s;uch a uniform per&s;everance in attending to the welfare of human nature,&mdash; that we think it impo&s;&s;ible for all the faculty, ver&s;ed in the different kinds of Mania, to define the nature of Mr. Brothers's madne&s;s, and to cla&s;s it under its re&s;pective &s;pecies. Suppo&s;ing him an enthu&s;ia&s;t, he is equally extraordinary. Such per&s;ons are generally impelled to the mo&s;t &s;trenuous and violent of bodily and mental efforts. Their faculties are in a &s;tate of per|petual agitation. Their pa&s;&s;ions &s;eldom find a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uie&s;cent pau&s;e from continual excitement.&mdash; their object, whatever it may be, &s;o powerfully intere&s;ts all their thoughts, that they are never becalmed, by re&s;t or peace, until nature, ex|hau&s;ted, &s;ubmits to their &s;oothing influence; but, contrary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o this, Mr. Brothers has appeared to be almo&s;t dive&s;ted of the common pa&s;&s;ions of nature. Ever calm&mdash;ever collected&mdash;ever af|fable and communicative of &s;entiments, dictated by a boundle&s;s attachment to the peace of man, if an enthu&s;ia&s;t, he is, of all enthu&s;ia&s;ts,&mdash;the mo&s;t wonderful.</P>
<P>The above ob&s;ervations are &s;tated merely as evidence of his &s;ingularity of character. They are not meant to vindicate or di&s;prove the ve|racity
<PB N="3" REF="028354_0209_0FD8C2E2C673FA40">
of his predictions, or his being the cho&s;en re&s;torer of the I&s;raelites to their kingdom.</P>
<P>With regard to the particulars that have tran&s;pired re&s;pecting Richard Brothers,&mdash;we have to &s;tate the following:</P>
<P>In 1782, he was a lieutenant on board the Albion, of 64 guns. This &s;hip being paid off in 1783, he was reduced to his half-pay, on which he &s;upported him&s;elf until 1789, when &s;ome religious &s;cruples ari&s;ing in his mind a|gain&s;t the taking of oaths, he was prevented receiving his arrears until there were two years due, in 1791. At this period he lodged with a Mrs. Green, in Dartmouth-&s;treet, with whom he had then re&s;ided three years. During this time, he behaved with hone&s;ty, affable temper, and morality of principle.</P>
<P>Although he &s;uffered the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s from not receiving his arrears of pay, amounting to &pound;. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">9 by refu&s;ing to take the nece&s;&s;ary oaths before the Agent, yet he per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing to be guilty of the crime, which he calls volunta|rily &s;wearing.&mdash;The rea&s;on he &s;tated for his refu&s;al was, that he con&s;idered &s;wearing, every &s;ix months, as a qualification to receive pay, was unnece&s;&s;ary, unju&s;t, and wicked. Having &s;tated what he con&s;idered the concealed and un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ded cruelty of the oath, in addition to ob|jections again&s;t the form, he was told, there was an order of council to take the oath, and that it was not in the power of the admiralty to di&s;pen&s;e with it.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="028354_0210_0FD8C2E3C69C3708">He &s;oon after &s;upported his former objections, and made another reque&s;t, that he might receive his pay without being obliged to take the oath. On this occa&s;ion, he ob&s;erved, that if the order of council inforced an oath, in any manner or any form whatever, and that the man it was di|rected to operate upon, &s;wore that he was not forced, but that the oath he took was a volun|tary act, the re&s;ult of his own free will&mdash;would it not, in the &s;ight of God in heaven, and every man of di&s;cernment under him on earth, amount to a fal&s;e oath? The&s;e rea&s;ons and objections he publi&s;hed, at the time, in the Public Adver|ti&s;er. He al&s;o publi&s;hed the letter he received from the admiralty, &s;tating their in&s;ufficient power to di&s;pen&s;e with the u&s;ual form of &s;wear|ing. Knowing the pre&s;ident of the admiralty was a member of the council, he wrote to him: In this, he &s;tated, that as men, whether few in number, or the increa&s;ed multitude of a &s;enate, were not infallible, they mu&s;t con&s;equently be &s;ubject to error. To enforce his a&s;&s;ertion, he alluded to the deci&s;ion of the privy council, re|lative to a native of Gla&s;gow, who had his &s;hip &s;eized in the We&s;t-Indies, for what, he con|&s;idered, was an unde&s;igned infringement of the Navigation Act.</P>
<P>Such was his aver&s;ion to taking the oath, that he endured the want of even a bit of bread. Without con&s;idering him a Prophet, but merely as a man of purity and piety of principle, he is to be admired for the fortitude with which he endured his &s;ufferings, rather than obtain relief by committing an act, which appeared to him mo&s;t offen&s;ive to God and man. This conduct
<PB N="5" REF="028354_0211_0FD8C2E9E56E1F70">
may be admitted as a proof of his being, at lea&s;t, &s;incere in his religious profe&s;&s;ions, however he may be the dupe of his own vi&s;ionary delu&s;ions.</P>
<P>Mrs. Green being greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for the money due to her from Mr. Brothers, applied to the work hou&s;e board of the United Pari&s;hes of St. Margaret's and St. John's the Evangeli&s;t, We&s;tmin&s;ter. The workhou&s;e board con&s;ider|ing the di&s;tre&s;s &s;he mu&s;t &s;uffer, as well as what appeared to them, the lamentable &s;ituation of our Prophet him&s;elf, re&s;olved to receive him as a ca&s;ual pauper. Agreeably to an order from the board, he was brought about a week after to the work hou&s;e. He entered the room with his hat on, and reque&s;ted they would excu&s;e his taking it off, as that homage he con&s;idered only due to the Almighty.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t he appeared offended with his exami|nation; but being de&s;ired to take a chair, his good temper returned. He then took off his hat, and &s;aid, he knew when he was treated with that re&s;pect his character demanded. In this in&s;tance, he appears to have refu&s;ed taking off his hat, more from ideas of per&s;onal con&s;e|quence, than any peculiar homage he meant to re&s;erve for the Almighty. His examination, containing &s;entiments which &s;erve to di&s;play his temper, and the &s;tate of his mind, we in&s;ert it as follows. Pray, &s;ir, do you know the rea&s;on of your being brought to this hou&s;e? Indeed I do not. All that I know of the matter is, that I was brought in a very rough manner; but as external objects affect me but little, I acquie&s;ce.</P>
<P>I think, &s;ir, you are in his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice?
<PB N="6" REF="028354_0212_0FD8C2EEEE6B7410">
You are mi&s;taken, I re&s;igned two years &s;ince. I am in the &s;ervice of a Prince, the greate&s;t and mo&s;t potent. A Prince, in who&s;e &s;ervices my wages will be certain; but his kingdom is not of this world. What, &s;ir, was your rea&s;on for re&s;igning your commi&s;&s;ion? Di&s;gu&s;t; I con|ceived the military life to be totally repugnant to the duties of chri&s;tianity, and that I could not con&s;cientiou&s;ly receive the wages of plunder, blood&s;hed, and murder.</P>
<P>How did you imagine that you could live without your pay, and that pay, which, from your character and appearance, we &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e with honor to your&s;elf and advantage to your country? Therefore I rejected. I ob&s;er|ved before, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for a military man, to take his pay with a &s;afe con&s;cience: I tru&s;t the ma&s;ter I &s;erve will not &s;uffer me to want. I &s;hall, in a few days, receive a &s;um more than &s;ufficient to pay this woman's debt, ten times over.</P>
<P>Pray, &s;ir, have you ever been a hou&s;e-keeper? I cannot ab&s;olutely &s;ay I have not: I once a|greed for a hou&s;e and was two months in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; but as a very melancholy idea comes acro&s;s my mind when I think of that period, I hope you will not pre&s;s me further upon the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Certainly we &s;hall not; We under&s;tand, &s;ir, that you were born in America? I was, in the town of Placen&s;ia&punc; in Newfoundland; I have not a friend or relation in this part of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="028354_0213_0FD8C2F13357E7D8">Where did you lodge before you came to We&s;tmin&s;ter? In Bridewell precinct.</P>
<P>You will excu&s;e us, &s;ir, we mean it not as im|pertinent, but as a nece&s;&s;ary que&s;tion; What did you pay weekly? I am above that fal&s;e pride which &s;hrinks from enquiry, I will an&s;wer any que&s;tion you plea&s;e to put to me.</P>
<P>I have already endeavoured to live within the bounds of my income&mdash;narrow as they were; but you may &s;uppo&s;e, that out of nomi|nally 3<ABBR>s.</ABBR> but really 2<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 10<ABBR>d.</ABBR> per day, I could not afford any &s;uperb lodgings.
