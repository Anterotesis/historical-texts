<P>From, his pa: 16 <HI>Ob&s;erve</HI> again, It doth not appear by what D: L: hath there &s;aid, thar G: F: could not write the date of the year, for however the date of one of his Letters may now ap|pear, which may be vitiated lying &s;o long in <HI>Adver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aries</HI> hands; yet it plainly appears by the other Letter (which <HI>J: Talbot</HI> af|firms &s;everal that knew his learning owned to be his) that he both could and did write it; therefore the one could no more &s;hew he could not, than the other &s;hewed that he could and did.

To conclude, whatever he hath found in one Letter, conceining it's not being dated well; yet it fol|lows not, that therefore he could not do it &s;eeing in the other Letter as them&s;elves have publi&s;hed it's manife&s;t, he both could and did do it, which was the mo&s;t I &s;aid of it; and &s;o have no &s;atisfaction to make about it.</P>
