Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken</HI>&mdash;The Sum of his Di&s;cour&s;e is this; I acknowledge the Glory of GOD revealed to the Fathers, ver. 2; the Calling of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> ver. 34, &amp;c. the Dignity of the Law, ver 8, 38, 44; the Holine&s;s of <HI>this place,</HI> ver. 7, 45, 47. And indeed the Law is more antient than the Temple; the Promi&s;e more antient than the Law. For GOD &s;hewed him&s;elf the GOD of <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac, Jacob,</HI> and their Children freely (ver. 2. &amp;c. 9. &amp;c. 17, &amp;c. 32, 34, 35.) and they &s;hewed Faith and Obedi|ence to GOD. (ver. 4, 20. &amp;c. 23.) particularly by their Regard for the Law, (ver. 8.) and the promi&s;ed Land, (ver. 16.) Meantime GOD, never confined his Pre&s;ence to this one Place or to the Ob&s;er|vers of the Law. For He hath been acceptably wor&s;hipped, before the Law was given, or the Temple built, and out of this Land, (ver. 2. 19, 33, 44.) And that our Fathers and their Po&s;terity were not tied down to this Land, their various Sojournings (ver 4, &amp;c. 14, 29, 44.) and Exile (ver. 43.) &s;hew. But you and your Fathers have always been evil; (ver. 9.) have with&s;tood <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> (ver. 25, &amp;c. 39, &amp;c.) have de&s;pi&s;ed the Land, (ver. 39.) for&s;aken GOD, (ver. 40, &amp;c.) &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly honoured the Temple, (ver. 48.) re&s;i&s;ted GOD and his Spirit, (ver. 50.) killed the Prophets and the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> Him|&s;elf, (ver. 51.) and kept not the Law, for which ye contend ver. 53.) Therefore GOD is not bound to you; much le&s;s to you alone. And truly this &s;olemn Te&s;timony of <HI>Stephen</HI> is mo&s;t worthy of his Character, as <HI>a man full of the Holy Gho&s;t, and of faith and power:</HI> in which tho' he does not advance &s;o many regular Propo&s;itions, con|tradictory to tho&s;e of his Adver&s;aries, yet he clo&s;ely and nervou&s;ly an&s;wers them all. Nor can we doubt but he would, from the&s;e Premi&s;&s;es, have drawn Inferences touching the De&s;truction of the Temple, the Abrogation of the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Law, the Punishment of that rebellious People: and above all, touching <HI>Je&s;us</HI> of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> the true <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> had not his Di&s;cour&s;e been interrupted by the Cla|mours of the Multitude, &s;topping their Ears, and ru&s;hing upon him. <HI>Men, brethren, and fathers</HI>&mdash;All who are here pre&s;ent whether ye are my Equals in Years, or of more advanced Age.

<MILESTONE N="9"> However having taken &s;ecurity of Ja&s;on and of the re&s;t, they let them go.</P>
<P>But the brethren immediately &s;ent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea,
<MILESTONE N="10"> who coming <HI>thither,</HI> went into the &s;ynagogue of the Jews.
<MILESTONE N="11"> The&s;e were more ingenuous than tho&s;e of The&s;&s;alonica, receiving the word with all readine&s;s of mind, <HI>and</HI> daily &s;earching the &s;criptures,

<P>Now,

<MILESTONE N="17"> He there|fore di&s;cour&s;ed in the &s;ynagogue to the Jews and the devout per&s;ons, and in the market-place daily to tho&s;e whom he met with.
<MILESTONE N="18"> Then &s;ome of the

<MILESTONE N="19"> And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, &s;aying, May we know what this new doctrine <HI>is,</HI> which is &s;poken by thee? For thou bringe&s;t certain &s;trange things to our ears;

<MILESTONE N="4"> And Paul &s;aid, John baptized with the bapti&s;m of repentance, telling the people to believe on him that was to come after him, that is, on Je&s;us. And hearing <HI>this,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="5"> they were baptized in the name of

<MILESTONE N="6"> And Paul laying <HI>his</HI> hands on them, the Holy Gho&s;t came upon them, and they &s;pake with tongues and prophe&s;ied.
<MILESTONE N="7"> And they were in all about twelve men.
<MILESTONE N="8"> And going into the &s;ynagogue, he &s;pake boldly, for three months di&s;cour&s;ing and per|&s;uading the things concerning the kingdom of God. But when &s;ome were hardened and believed not,
<MILESTONE N="9"> but &s;pake reproachfully of the way before the multitude, he departed from them, and &s;eparated the di&s;ciples, di&s;cour&s;ing daily in the &s;chool of one Tyrannus.
<MILESTONE N="10"> And this was done for the &s;pace of two years, &s;o that all the inhabitants of A&s;ia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord.</P>
<P>And God wrought &s;pecial miracles by the hands of
<MILESTONE N="11"> Paul,
<MILESTONE N="12"> So that handkerchiefs or aprons were carried from his body to the &s;ick, and the di&s;ea&s;es departed from them, and the evil &s;pirits came out of them. And &s;ome of the vagabond Jews,
<MILESTONE N="13"> exorci&s;ts, undertook to name the name of the Lord Je&s;us, over tho&s;e who had evil &s;pirits, &s;aying, We adjure you by Je&s;us, whom Paul preacheth.
<MILESTONE N="14"> And there were &s;even &s;ons of one Sceva a Jewi&s;h chief prie&s;t,
<MILESTONE N="15"> who did this. But the evil &s;pirit an&s;wering &s;aid, Je&s;us I know, and Paul I

<MILESTONE N="16"> but who are ye? And the man in whom the evil &s;pirit was, leaping upon them, and getting the ma&s;tery of them, prevailed again&s;t them, &s;o that they fled out of that hou&s;e naked and wounded.
<MILESTONE N="17"> And this was known to all both Jews and Greeks dwelling at Ephe&s;us, and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Je&s;us was magnified.
<MILESTONE N="18"> And many of tho&s;e who believed came, confe&s;&s;ing and openly declaring their deeds.
<MILESTONE N="19"> Many al&s;o of tho&s;e who had practi&s;ed curious arts, bringing their books together, burnt them before all men, and they computed the value of them,
<MILESTONE N="20"> and found it fifty thou&s;and <HI>pieces</HI> of &s;ilver. So powerfully did the word of God grow and prevail.</P>
<P>After the&s;e things were ended,
<MILESTONE N="21"> Paul purpo&s;ed in &s;pirit, having pa&s;&s;ed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jeru&s;alem, &s;aying, After I have been there, I mu&s;t &s;ee Rome al&s;o.
<MILESTONE N="22"> And having &s;ent two of tho&s;e who mini&s;tred to him, Timotheus and Era&s;tus, to Macedonia, he him&s;elf &s;taid in A&s;ia for a &s;ea&s;on.
<PB N="89" REF="046352_0088_10210AD2CE9D4988">And about that time there aro&s;e no &s;mall tumult con|cerning the way.
<MILESTONE N="23"> <MILESTONE N="24"> For a man named Demetrius, a &s;ilver-&s;mith, who made &s;ilver &s;hrines of Diana, pro|cured no &s;mall gain to the artificers:
<MILESTONE N="25"> Whom having gathered together, with the workmen employed in &s;uch things, he &s;aid, Sirs, ye know that our main|tenance ari&s;es from this occupation.
<MILESTONE N="26"> But ye &s;ee and hear, that not at Ephe&s;us only, but almo&s;t through all A&s;ia, this Paul hath per&s;uaded and turned a&s;ide much people; &s;aying, that they are not gods, which are made with hands:
<MILESTONE N="27"> So that there is danger not only that this our craft &s;hould come into di&s;grace, but al&s;o that the temple of the great godde&s;s Diana &s;hould be de&s;pi&s;ed, and her maje&s;ty de&s;troyed, whom all A&s;ia and the world wor&s;hippeth.
<MILESTONE N="28"> And hearing <HI>this,</HI> they were filled with rage, and cried out, &s;aying, Great <HI>is</HI> Diana of the Ephe&s;ians,
<MILESTONE N="29"> And the whole city was filled with confu&s;ion; and they ru&s;hed with one ac|cord into the theatre, dragging with them Caius and Ari&s;tarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's fellow-travel|lers.
<PB N="90" REF="046352_0089_10210BE17733C278"><MILESTONE N="30"> And when Paul would have gone in to the peo|ple,
<MILESTONE N="31"> the di&s;ciples would not &s;uffer him. And &s;ome al|&s;o of the principal Officers of A&s;ia, being his friends, &s;ent to him and de&s;ired, that he would not venture him&s;elf into the theatre.
<MILESTONE N="32"> Some therefore cried one thing, and &s;ome another; for the a&s;&s;embly was con|fu&s;ed, and the greater part did not know for what they were come together.
<MILESTONE N="33"> And they thru&s;t Alex|ander forward from among the multitude, the Jews pu&s;hing him on; and Alexander, waving with his hand, would have made a defence to the people. But when they knew that he was a Jew,
<MILESTONE N="34"> one voice aro&s;e from them all, crying out, for about two hours, Great <HI>is</HI> Diana of the Ephe&s;ians.
<MILESTONE N="35"> But the regi&s;ter, having pacified the people, &s;aid, Ye men of Ephe&s;us what man is there who knoweth not, that the city of the Ephe&s;ians is a wor&s;hipper of the great Diana, and of the <HI>image</HI> which fell down from Jupiter?
<MILESTONE N="36"> Seeing then the&s;e things cannot be denied, ye ought to be quiet,
<MILESTONE N="37"> and to do nothing ra&s;hly. For ye have brought the&s;e men, who are neither robbers of temples, nor

<MILESTONE N="38"> If then Demetrius and the artificers that are with him, have a charge again&s;t any one, the courts are held, and there are procon&s;uls; let them implead one another.
<MILESTONE N="39"> But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it &s;hall be determin|ed in a lawful a&s;&s;embly.

<P>And when we were come up to Jeru&s;alem,

<MILESTONE N="18"> And the next day, Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were pre&s;ent. And having &s;aluted them,
<MILESTONE N="19"> he gave them a particular account of tho&s;e things which God had done among the Gentiles by his mini&s;try.
<MILESTONE N="20"> And having heard <HI>it,</HI> they glorified God, and &s;aid to him, Thou &s;ee&s;t, bro|ther, how many thou&s;ands of believing Jews there are, and they are all zealous for the law.
<MILESTONE N="21"> But they have been informed concerning thee, that thou teache&s;t the Jews who are among the Gentiles, to apo&s;tatize from Mo&s;es, telling them, not to circumci&s;e <HI>their</HI> chil|dren,
<MILESTONE N="22"> nor to walk after the cu&s;toms. What is it there|fore? The multitude mu&s;t needs come together; for they will hear that thou art come.
<MILESTONE N="23"> Therefore do this that we &s;ay to thee: there are with us four men, who
<PB N="99" REF="046352_0098_10210AF011C1CAA8">have a vow on them:
<MILESTONE N="24"> Take them and purify thy&s;elf with them, and be at charges with them, that they may &s;have their heads: and all will know, that there is nothing of tho&s;e things which they have heard of thee; but <HI>that</HI> thou thy&s;elf walke&s;t orderly, keeping the law.
<MILESTONE N="25"> As touching the Gentiles that believe, we have written and determined, that they &s;hould ob&s;erve no &s;uch thing; &s;ave only that they keep them&s;elves from what is offered to idols, and from blood, and from what is &s;trangled,

<MILESTONE N="27"> And when the &s;even days were about to be accompli&s;hed, the Jews that were from A&s;ia &s;eeing him in the temple, &s;tirred up all the multitude, and laid hands on him, Crying out,

<P>And as they went about to kill him,
<MILESTONE N="31"> word came to the tribune of the cohort, that all Jeru&s;alem was in an uproar.
<MILESTONE N="32"> Who immediately took &s;oldiers and cen|turions, and ran down to them; and when they &s;aw the tribune and the &s;oldiers, they cea&s;ed from beating Paul.
<MILESTONE N="33"> Then the tribune came near, and took him, and commanded <HI>him</HI> to be bound with two chains, and enquired, Who he was, and what he had done! But &s;ome among the multitude cried out one thing,

<MILESTONE N="3"> that he would &s;end for

<MILESTONE N="4"> But Fe&s;tus an&s;wered, That Paul was kept at Ce&s;area, and that he him&s;elf would depart <HI>thither</HI> &s;hortly.
<MILESTONE N="5"> Therefore let tho&s;e of you, &s;aid he, who are able, go down with me and accu&s;e the man, if there be any <HI>wickedne&s;s</HI> in him.
<MILESTONE N="6"> And having tarried among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Ce&s;area; and the next day, &s;itting on the judgment-&s;eat, he commanded Paul to be brought. And when he was come,
<MILESTONE N="7"> the Jews who had come down from Jeru&s;alem, &s;tood round about <HI>him,</HI> bring|ing many and heavy accu&s;ations again&s;t Paul, which they were not able to prove:
<MILESTONE N="8"> While he an&s;wered for him&s;elf, Neither again&s;t the law of the Jews, nor again&s;t the temple, nor again&s;t Ce&s;ar have I offended at all.
<MILESTONE N="9"> But Fe&s;tus, de&s;iring to gratify the Jews, an|&s;wered Paul, and &s;aid, Art thou willing to go up to Jeru&s;alem, and there be judged before me concerning the&s;e things?
<MILESTONE N="10"> Then &s;aid Paul, I am &s;tanding at Ce|&s;ar's judgment-&s;eat, where I ought to be judged: I have done no wrong to the Jews, as thou al&s;o very well knowe&s;t.
<MILESTONE N="11"> For if indeed I have done wrong, and have committed any thing worthy of death. I refu&s;e not to die: but if there is nothing of the things whereof they accu&s;e me, no man can give me up to

<P>And after certain days,

<MILESTONE N="17"> When therefore they were come hither, I without any delay &s;at on the judgment-&s;eat the next day, and commanded the man to be brought forth.
<MILESTONE N="18"> Again&s;t whom when the accu&s;ers &s;tood up, they brought no accu&s;ation of &s;uch things as I &s;uppo&s;ed;
<MILESTONE N="19"> But had certain que&s;tions again&s;t him, relating to their own religious wor&s;hip, and about one Je&s;us that was dead, whom Paul af|firmed

<MILESTONE N="20"> And as I doubted of &s;uch manner of que&s;tions, I a&s;ked, If he would go to Jeru&s;alem, and there be judged concerning the&s;e matters?
<MILESTONE N="21"> But Paul appealing to be kept for the hearing of Augu&s;tus, I commanded him to be kept till I could &s;end him to Ce&s;ar.
<MILESTONE N="22"> Then Agrippa &s;aid to Fe&s;tus, I would al&s;o hear the man my&s;elf. And he &s;aid, To-morrow thou &s;halt hear him.</P>

<MILESTONE N="25"> But when I found, that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and he had him&s;elf appealed to the Emperor, I determined to &s;end him:

<HEAD>NOTES ON ST. PAUL's Epi&s;tle to the ROMANS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="outline">
<P>MANY of the Writings of the New Te&s;tament are written in the Form of Epi&s;tles. Such are not only tho&s;e of St. <HI>Paul, James, Peter, Jude,</HI> but al&s;o both the Treati&s;es of St. <HI>Luke,</HI> and all the Writings of St. <HI>John.</HI> Nay, we have &s;even Epi&s;tles herein, which the LORD <HI>Je&s;us</HI> Him&s;elf &s;ent by the Hand of <HI>John</HI> to the &s;even Churches: Yea, the whole <HI>Revelation</HI> is no other than an Epi&s;tle from Him.</P>
<P>Concerning the Epi&s;tles of St <HI>Paul,</HI> we may ob&s;erve he writes in a very different Manner, to tho&s;e Churches which he had planted him&s;elf, and to tho&s;e <HI>who had not &s;een</HI> his <HI>face in the fle&s;h.</HI> In his Letters to the former, a loving or &s;harp Familiarity appears, as their Behaviour was more or le&s;s &s;uitable to the Go&s;pel, To the latter, he propo&s;es the pure, unmixt Go&s;pel, in a more general and ab&s;tract Manner.</P>
<P>As to the Time wherein he wrote his Epi&s;tles, it is probable he wrote, about the Year of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> according to the common Reckoning:

<P>As to the General Epi&s;tles, it &s;eems St. <HI>James</HI> wrote a little be|fore his Death, which was A. D. 63 St. <HI>Peter,</HI> who was martyr'd in the Year 67, wrote his latter Epi&s;tle a little before his Death, and
<PB N="131" REF="046352_0130_10210B48C36EAD68">not long after his former. St. <HI>Jude</HI> wrote after him, when the My&s;tery of Iniquity was gaining Ground &s;wiftly. St <HI>John</HI> is be|lieved to have wrote all his Epi&s;tles a little before his Departure. The <HI>Revelation</HI> he wrote A. D. 96.</P>
<P>That St. <HI>Paul</HI> wrote this Epi&s;tle from <HI>Corinth</HI> we may learn, from his commending to the <HI>Romans Phebe</HI> a Servant of the Church of <HI>Cen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rca</HI> (ch. xvi. 1.) a Port of <HI>Corinth,</HI> and from his mentioning the Salutations of <HI>Cains</HI> and <HI>Era&s;tus</HI> (ch. xvi. 23.) who were both <HI>Co|rinthians.</HI> Tho&s;e to whom he wrote, &s;eem to have been chiefly Foreigners, both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> whom Bu&s;ine&s;s drew from other Provinces; as appears, both by his writing in <HI>Greck,</HI> and by his Salutations of &s;everal former Acquaintance.</P>
<P>His chief De&s;ign herein is to &s;hew, 1. That neither the <HI>Gentiles</HI> by the Law of Nature, nor the <HI>Jews</HI> by the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> could obtain Ju&s;tification before GOD: And that therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary for both to &s;eek it from the free Mercy of GOD by Faith. 2. That GOD has an ab&s;olute Right, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ew mercy on what Terms he plea&s;es, and to with hold it from tho&s;e who will not accept of it on his own Terms.</P>

<P>To expre&s;s the De&s;ign and Contents of this Epi&s;tle, a little more at large. The Apo&s;tle labours throughout, to fix in tho&s;e to whom he writes, a deep Sen&s;e of the Excellency of the Go&s;pel, and to engage them to act suitably to it. For this Purpo&s;e, after a general Salutation, (ch.i. 1-7.) and Profe&s;&s;ion of his Affection for them (ver. 8. 15.) he declares he &s;hall not be a&s;hamed openly to maintain the Go&s;pel at <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;eeing it is the powerful In&s;trument of Salvation, both to <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> by Means of Faith. (ver 16, 17.) And in order to demon&s;trate this, he &s;hews,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the World greatly needed &s;uch a Di&s;pen&s;ation, the <HI>Gentiles</HI> being in a mo&s;t abandoned State; (ver. 18-32.) and the <HI>Jews,</HI> though condemning others, being them&s;elves no better: (ch. ii. 1-29.) As, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome Cavils, which he obviates, (ch. iii. 1-8.) their own Scriptures te&s;tify. (9-19.) So that all were under a Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking Ju&s;tification by this Method. (20-31.)</P>
<P N="2">2. That <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>David</HI> them&s;elves &s;ought Ju&s;tification, by Faith, and not by Works, (ch. iv. 1-25.)</P>
<P N="3">3. That all who believe are brought into &s;o happy a State, as turns the greate&s;t Afflictions into Matter of Joy. (ch. v. 1-11.)</P>
<P N="4">4. That the evils brought on Mankind by <HI>Adam,</HI> are abundantly recompen&s;ed to all that believe in <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> (12-21.)</P>
<P N="5">5. That far from di&s;&s;olving the Obligations to practical Holi|ne&s;s, the Go&s;pel increa&s;es them by peculiar Obligations, (ch. vi. 1-23.)</P>
<P>In order to convince them of the&s;e Things the more deeply, and to remove their Fondne&s;s for the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Law, now they were <HI>married to Chri&s;t</HI> by Faith in him, (ch vii. 1-6.) he shews how un|able the Motives of the Law were to produce that Holine&s;s, which Believers obtain, by a living Faith in the Go&s;pel; (ch. v.i. 7-25. viii. 1, 2.) and then gives a more particular View of tho&s;e Things, which rendered the Go&s;pel effectual to this great End. (ver 3-39.)</P>
<P>That even the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> if they believed, &s;hould have a Share in the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings; and that the <HI>Jews,</HI> if they believed not, &s;hould be excluded from them, being a Point of great Importance, the Apo&s;tle be&s;tows the 9th, 10th, and 11th Chapters in &s;ettling it. He begins the 9th Chapter by expre&s;&s;ing his tender Love and high E&s;teem for the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation, (ver. 1-5.) and then &s;hews,</P>
<P N="1">1. That GOD's rejecting great Part of the Seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> yea, and of <HI>I&s;aac</HI> too, was undeniable Fact (6-13.)</P>
<P N="2">2. That GOD had not cho&s;en them to &s;uch peculiar Privileges, for any Kind of Goodne&s;s either in them or their Fathers (14-24.)</P>
<P N="3">3. That his accepting the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and rejecting many of the <HI>Jews,</HI> had been foretold both by <HI>Ho&s;ea</HI> and <HI>I&s;aiah.</HI> (ver. 25-33.)</P>
<P N="4">4. That GOD had offered Salvation to <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> on the &s;ame Terms, though the <HI>Jews</HI> had rejected it. (ch. x. 1.-21.)</P>
<P N="5">5. That though the Rejection of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> for their Ob&s;tinacy was General, yet it was not Total: there being &s;till a Remnant among them who did embrace the Go&s;pel. (ch. xi. 1-10.)</P>
<P N="6">6. That the Rejection of the re&s;t was not Final, but in the End <HI>all I&s;rael &s;hould be &s;aved.</HI> (ver. 11-31.)</P>
<P N="7">7. That mean time even their Ob&s;tinacy and Rejection &s;erved to di&s;play the un&s;earchable Wi&s;dom and Love of GOD. (ver. 32-36.)</P>
<PB N="133" REF="046352_0132_10210B50CDF5FD68">
<P>The Re&s;t of the Epi&s;tle contains practical In&s;tructions and Exhor|tations He particularly urges, 1. An entire Con&s;ecration of them|&s;elves to GOD, and a Care to glorify Him by a faithful Improvement of their &s;everal Talents: (ch. xii 1-11.) 2. Devotion, Patience, Ho&s;pitality, mutual Sympathy, Humility, Peace, and Meekne&s;s; (ver. 12-21.) 3. Obedience to Magi&s;trates, Ju&s;tice in all its Bran|ches, Love the fulfilling of the Law, and univer&s;al Holine&s;s: (ch. xiii. 1-14.) 4. Mutual Candor between tho&s;e who differed in Judg|ment, touching the Ob&s;ervance of the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Law; (ch. xiv. 1-23. xv. 1-17.) in enforcing which he is led to mention the Extent of his own Labours, and his Purpo&s;e of vi&s;iting the <HI>Romans,</HI> in the mean Time recommending him&s;elf to their Prayers, (ver. 18-33.) And after many Salutations, (ch. xvi. 1-16) and a Caution again&s;t tho&s;e who cau&s;ed Divi&s;ions, he concludes with a &s;uitable Ble&s;&s;ing and Doxology. (v. 17-27.)</P>

<P>To explain this (nearly in the Words of an eminent Writer) a lit|tle more at large. When a Man has a Work of Time and Impor|tance before him, he pau&s;es, con&s;ult<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and contrives; and when he has laid a Plan, re&s;olves or <HI>decrees</HI> to proceed accordingly.

<P>The Works of Providence and Redemption are va&s;t and &s;tupen|dous, and therefore we are apt to conceive of GOD, as deliberating and con&s;ulting on them, and then <HI>decreeing</HI> to act, according to <HI>the Coun&s;els of his own Will.</HI> As if, long before the World was made, he had been concerting Mea&s;ures, both as to the making and go|verning of it, and had then writ down his Decrees, which altered not, <PB N="169" REF="046352_0168_10210BCD98930400"> any more than the Laws of the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> Whereas to take this <HI>con&s;ulting</HI> and <HI>decreeing</HI> in a literal Sen&s;e would be the &s;ame Ab&s;urdity, as to a&s;cribe a real, human Body and human Pa&s;|&s;ions to the ever ble&s;&s;ed GOD.</P>
<P>This is only a popular Repre&s;entation of his infallible Know|ledge and unchangeable Wi&s;dom; that is, He does all Things as wi&s;ely as a Man can po&s;&s;ibly do, after the deepe&s;t Con&s;ultation, and as &s;teadily pur&s;ues the mo&s;t proper Method, as one can do, who has &s;aid a Scheme before-hand. But then, though the Effects be &s;uch as would argue Con&s;ultation and con&s;equent Decrees in Man, yet what Need of a Moment's Con&s;ultation in Him, who &s;ees all Things at one View?</P>
<P>Nor had GOD any more Occa&s;ion to pau&s;e and deliberate, and lay down Rules for his own Conduct, from all Eternity, than He has now. What! Was there any Fear of his mi&s;taking afterwards, if He had not before-hand prepared Decrees, to direct Him, what He was to do? Will any Man &s;ay, He was wi&s;er before the Crea|tion than &s;ince?

<MILESTONE N="4"> For we who are in <HI>this</HI> tabernacle groan, being burdened; not that we would be un|clothed, but clothed upon, that what is mortal may be &s;wallowed up of life.
<MILESTONE N="5"> Now he that hath wrought us to this very thing <HI>is</HI> God, who hath al&s;o given us

<MILESTONE N="12"> We do not again recommend our&s;elves to you; but we give you an oc|ca&s;ion of glorying on our behalf, that ye may have &s;omething to <HI>an&s;wer</HI> them, who glory in appearance,<PB N="279" REF="046352_0278_10210D3E0F23F618">and not in heart.
