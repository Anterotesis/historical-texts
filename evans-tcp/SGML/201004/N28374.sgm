<HEAD>FUNERAL ORATION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN obedience to your<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The two Hou&s;es of Congre&s;s.</NOTE> will, I ri&s;e your humble organ, with the hope of executing a part of the &s;y&s;tem of public mourning which you have been plea&s;ed to adopt, commemorative of the death of the mo&s;t il|lu&s;trious and mo&s;t beloved per&s;onage this country has ever produced; and which, while it tran&s;mits to po&s;|terity your &s;en&s;e of the awful event, faintly repre&s;ents your knowledge of the con&s;ummate excellence you &s;o cordially honor.</P>
<P>De&s;perate indeed is any attempt on earth to meet corre&s;pondently this di&s;pen&s;ation of Heaven: for, while with pious re&s;ignation we &s;ubmit to the will of an all-gracious Providence, we can never cea&s;e la|menting in our finite view of Omnipotent Wi&s;dom, the heart-rending privation for which our nation weeps. When the civilized world &s;hakes to its cen|tre; when every moment gives birth to &s;trange and momentous changes; when our peaceful quarter of the globe, exempt as it happily has been from any &s;hare in the &s;laughter of the human race, may yet be compelled to abandon her pacific policy, and to ri&s;k
<PB N="6" REF="037807_0005_100F548AD2ED61F8">the doleful ca&s;ualties of war: What limit is there to the extent of our lo&s;s?&mdash;None within the reach of my words to expre&s;s; none which your feelings will not di&s;avow.</P>
<P>The founder of our foederate republic&mdash;our bul|wark in war, our guide in peace, is no more. Oh that this was but que&s;tionable! Hope, the comforter of the wretched, would pour into our agonized hearts its balmy dew. But, alas! there is no hope for us: our Wa&s;hington is removed forever. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;toute&s;t frame, and pure&s;t mind, he had pa&s;&s;ed nearly to his &s;ixty-eighth year, in the enjoyment of high health, when, habituated by his care of us to neglect him&s;elf, a &s;light cold, di&s;regarded, became inconvenient on Friday, oppre&s;&s;ive on Saturday, and defying every medical interpo&s;ition, before the morning of Sunday, put an end to the be&s;t of men. An end did I &s;ay&mdash;his fame &s;urvives! bounded only by the limits of the earth, and by the extent of the human mind. He &s;urvives in our hearts, in the growing knowledge of our children, in the affection of the good throughout the world; and when our monuments &s;hall be done away; when nations now exi&s;ting &s;hall be no more; when even our young and far-&s;preading empire &s;hall have peri&s;hed, &s;till will our Wa&s;hington's glory un|faded &s;hine, and die not, until love of virtue cea&s;e on earth, or earth it&s;elf &s;inks into chaos.</P>

How, my fellow-citizens, &s;hall I &s;ingle to your grateful hearts his pre-eminent worth! Where &s;hall I begin in opening to your view a character through|out &s;ublime. Shall I &s;peak of his warlike atchieve|ments, all &s;pringing from obedience to his country's will&mdash;all directed to his country's good?</P>
<P>Will you go with me to the Banks of the Monon|gahela, to &s;ee your youthful Wa&s;hington, &s;upporting, in the di&s;mal hour of Indian victory, the ill-fated Braddock, and &s;aving, by his judgment and by his valour, the remains of a defeated army, pre&s;&s;ed by the conquering &s;avage &s;oe? Or, when oppre&s;&s;ed Ame|rica, nobly re&s;olving to ri&s;k her all in defence of her violated rights, he was elevated by the unanimous voice of Congre&s;s to the command of her armies: Will you follow him to the high-grounds of Bo&s;ton, where to an undi&s;ciplined, courageous and virtuous yeomanry, his pre&s;ence gave the &s;tability of &s;y&s;tem, and infu&s;ed the invincibility of love of country: Or &s;hall I carry you to the painful &s;cenes of Long-I&s;land, York-I&s;land and New-Jer&s;ey, when combating &s;uperior and gallant armies, aided by powerful fleets, and led by chiefs high in the roll of fame, he &s;tood the bulwark of our &s;afety; undi&s;mayed by di&s;a&s;ter; un|changed by change of fortune. Or will you view him in the precarious fields of Trenton, where deep gloom unnerving every arm, reigned triumphant through our thinned, worn down unaided ranks:
<PB N="8" REF="037807_0007_100F548DEEDFF830">him&s;elf unmoved.&mdash;Dreadful was the night; it was about this time of winter&mdash;The &s;torm raged&mdash;the Delaware rolling furiou&s;ly with floating ice forbad the approach of man. Wa&s;hington, &s;elf collected, viewed the tremendous &s;cene&mdash;his country called; unap|pall'd by &s;urrounding dangers, he pa&s;&s;ed to the ho&s;tile &s;hore: he fought; he conquered. The morning &s;un cheered the American world. Our country ro&s;e on the event; and her dauntle&s;s Chief pur&s;uing his blow, completed in the lawns of Princeton, what his va&s;t &s;oul had conceived on the &s;hores of Delaware.</P>
<P>Thence to the &s;trong grounds of Morris-Town he led his &s;mall but gallant band; and through an eventful winter, by the high efforts of his genius, who&s;e matchle&s;s force was mea&s;urable only by the growth of difficulties, he held in check formidable ho&s;tile legions, conducted by a Chief experienced in the art of war, and famed for his valour on the ever-memorable heighths of Abraham, where fell Wolfe, Montcalm, and &s;ince our much lamented Montgo|mery; all covered with glory. In this fortunate in|terval, produced by his ma&s;terly conduct, our fathers, our&s;elves, animated by his re&s;i&s;tle&s;s example, rallied around our country's &s;tandard, and continued to fol|low her beloved Chief, through the various and trying &s;cenes to which the de&s;tinies of our union led.</P>
<P>Who is there that has forgotten the vales of Brandywine&mdash;the fields of Germantown, or the plains
<PB N="9" REF="037807_0008_100F547E633E1840">of Monmouth; every where pre&s;ent, wants of every kind ob&s;tructing, numerous and valiant armies en|countering, him&s;elf a ho&s;t, he a&s;&s;uaged our &s;ufferings, limited our privations, and upheld our tottering re|public. Shall I di&s;play to you the &s;pread of the fire of his &s;oul, by rehear&s;ing the prai&s;es of the hero of Sara|toga, and his much lov'd compeer of the Carolina's? No; our Wa&s;hington wears not borrowed glory: To Gates&mdash;to Green, he gave without re&s;erve the ap|plau&s;e due to their eminent merit; and long may the Chiefs of Saratoga, and of Eutaws, receive the grateful re&s;pect of a grateful people.</P>
<P>Moving in his own orbit, he imparted heat and light to his mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;atellites; and combining the phy&s;ical and moral force of all within his &s;phere, with irre&s;i&s;table weight he took his cour&s;e, commi&s;erating folly, di&s;daining vice, di&s;maying trea&s;on and invigo|rating de&s;pondency, until the au&s;picious hour arri|ved, when, united with the intrepid forces of a potent and magnanimous ally, he brought to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion the &s;ince conqueror of India; thus fini&s;hing his long career of military glory with a lu&s;tre corre&s;ponding to his great name, and in this his la&s;t act of war affix|ing the &s;eal of fate to our nation's birth.</P>
<P>To the horrid din of battle &s;weet peace &s;ucceed|ed, and our virtuous chief, mindful only of the com|mon good, in a moment tempting per&s;onal aggran|dizement, hu&s;hed the di&s;contents of growing &s;edi|tion
<PB N="10" REF="037807_0009_100F548F74B03090">and &s;urrendering his power into the hands from which he had received it, converted his &s;word into a plough&s;hare, teaching an admiring world that to be truly great, you mu&s;t be truly good.</P>
<P>Was I to &s;top here, the picture would be incom|plete, and the ta&s;k impo&s;ed unfini&s;hed&mdash;Great as was our Wa&s;hington in war, and much as did that great|ne&s;s contribute to produce the American Republic, it is not in war alone his pre-eminence &s;tands con&s;picu|ous; his various talents combining all the capacities of a &s;tate&s;man with tho&s;e of the &s;oldier, fitted him alike to guide the councils and the armies of our nation. Scarcely had he re&s;ted from his martial toils, while his invaluable parental advice was &s;till &s;ounding in our ears. when he who had been our &s;hield and our &s;word, was called forth to act a le&s;s &s;plendid but a more important part.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a clear and a penetrating mind, a &s;trong and a &s;ound judgment, calmne&s;s and temper for delibe|ration, with invincible firmne&s;s and per&s;everance in re|&s;olutions maturely formed, drawing information from all, acting from him&s;elf, with incorruptible integrity and unvarying patrioti&s;m: his own &s;uperiority and the public confidence alike marked him as the man de&s;ign|ed by heaven to lead in the great political as well as military events which have di&s;tingui&s;hed the aera of his life.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="037807_0010_100F54827172BCB8">
The finger of an overruling Providence, pointing at Wa&s;hington, was neither mi&s;taken nor unob&s;erved; when to realize the va&s;t hopes to which our revolution had given birth, a change of political &s;y&s;tem became in|di&s;pen&s;ible.</P>
<P>How novel, how grand the &s;pectacle, independent &s;tates &s;tretched over an immen&s;e territory, and known only by common difficulty, clinging to their union as the rock of their &s;afety, deciding by frank compari&s;on of their relative condition, to rear on that rock, under the guidance of rea&s;on, a common government thro' who&s;e commanding protection, liberty and order, with their long train of ble&s;&s;ings &s;hould be &s;afe to them&s;elves, and the &s;ure inheritance of their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>This arduous ta&s;k devolved on citizens &s;elected by the people, from knowledge of their wi&s;dom and confi|fidence in their virtue. In this augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly of &s;a|ges and of patriots, Wa&s;hington of cour&s;e was found&mdash;and, as if acknowledged to be mo&s;t wife, where all were wi&s;e, with one voice he was declared their chief. How well he merited this rare di&s;tinction, how faithful were the labours of him&s;elf and his compatriots, the work of their hands and our union, &s;trength and pro&s;perity, the fruits of that work, be&s;t atte&s;t.</P>
<P>But to have e&s;&s;entially aided in pre&s;enting to his country this con&s;ummation of her hopes, neither &s;atis|fied the claims of his fellow-citizens on his talents, nor
<PB N="12" REF="037807_0011_100F5491B3266410">tho&s;e duties which the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e talents impo&s;|ed. Heaven had not infu&s;ed into his mind &s;uch an un|common &s;hare of its aetherial &s;pirit to remain unem|ployed, nor be&s;towed on him his genius unaccompanied with the corre&s;ponding duty of devoting it to the com|mon good. To have framed a con&s;titution, was &s;hew|ing only, without realizing the general happine&s;s. This great work remained to be done, and America, &s;tedfa&s;t in her preference, with one voice &s;ummoned her beloved Wa&s;hington, unpracti&s;ed as he was in the duties of civil admini&s;tration, to execute his la&s;t act in the completion of the national felicity. Obedient to her call, he a&s;&s;umed the high office with that &s;elf-di&s;tru&s;t peculiar to his innate mode&s;ty, the con&s;tant at|tendant of pre-eminent virtue. What was the bur&s;t of joy thro's our anxious land on this exhilerating event is known to us all. The aged, the young, the brave, the fair, rivalled each other in demon&s;trations of their gra|titude; and this high wrought delightful &s;cene was heightened in its effect, by the &s;ingular conte&s;t between the zeal of the be&s;towers and the avoidance of the re|ceiver of the honors be&s;towed. Commencing his ad|mini&s;tration, what heart is not charmed with the re|collection of the pure and wi&s;e principles announced by him&s;elf, as the ba&s;is of his political life. He be&s;t under|&s;tood the indi&s;&s;oluble union between virtue and happi|ne&s;s, between duty and advantage, between the genuine maxims of an hone&s;t and magnanimous policy, and the &s;olid rewards of public pro&s;perity and individual felicity:
<PB N="13" REF="037807_0012_100F5484B4CF2A40">watching with an equal and comprehen&s;ive eye over this great a&s;&s;emblage of communities and intere&s;ts, he laid the foundations of our national policy in the unerring immutable principles of morality, ba&s;ed on religion, ex|emplifying the pre-eminence of free government, by all the attributes which win the affections of its citi|zens or command the re&s;pect of the world.</P>
<Q>"O fortunatos nimium, &s;ua &s;i bona norint!"</Q>
<P>Leading thro' the complicated difficulties produc|ed by previous obligations and conflicting intere&s;ts, &s;e|conded by &s;ucceeding hou&s;es of Congre&s;s, enlightened and patriotic, he &s;urmounted all original ob&s;tructions, and brightened the path of our national felicity.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;idential term expiring, his &s;olicitude to exchange exaltation for humility returned, with a force encrea&s;ed with increa&s;e of age, and he had prepared his farewell addre&s;s to his countrymen, proclaiming his intention, when the united interpo&s;ition of all around him, enforced by the eventful pro&s;pects of the epoch, produced a further &s;acrifice of inclination to duty. The election of Pre&s;ident followed, and Wa&s;hington, by the unanimous vote of the nation, was called to re&s;ume the chief magi&s;tracy: what a wonderful fixure of confi|dence! Which attracts mo&s;t our admiration, a people &s;o correct, or a citizen combining an a&s;&s;emblage of ta|lents forbidding rivalry, and &s;tifling even envy it&s;elf? Such a nation aught to be happy, &s;uch a chief mu&s;t be forever revered.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="037807_0013_100F54946D4032B0">
War, long menaced by the Indian tribes, now broke out; and the terrible conflict deluging Europe with blood, began to &s;hed its baneful influence over our happy land. To the fir&s;t, out&s;tretching his invincible arm, under the orders of the gallant Wayne, the Ame|rican Eagle &s;oared triumphant thro' di&s;tant fore&s;ts. Peace followed victory, and the melioration of the con|dition of the enemy followed peace. Godlike virtue which uplifts even the &s;ubdued &s;avage.</P>
<P>To the &s;econd he oppo&s;ed him&s;elf. New and deli|cate was the conjuncture, and great was the &s;take.&mdash;Soon did his penetrating mind di&s;cern and &s;eize the only cour&s;e, continuing to us all, the felicity enjoyed. He i&s;&s;ued his proclamation of neutrality. This index to his whole &s;ub&s;equent conduct, was &s;anctioned by the approbation of both hou&s;es of Congre&s;s, and by the ap|proving voice of the people.</P>
<P>To this &s;ublime policy he inviolably adhered, un|moved by foreign intru&s;ion, un&s;haken by dome&s;tic turbulence.</P>

<PB N="15" REF="037807_0014_100F54864098C178">while afflicted Europe mourns in every quarter, under the accumulated mi&s;eries of an unexampled war; mi|&s;eries in which our happy country mu&s;t have &s;hared, had not our pre-eminent Wa&s;hington been as firm in council as he was brave in the field.</P>
<P>Pur&s;uing &s;tedfa&s;tly his cour&s;e, he held &s;afe the public happine&s;s, preventing foreign war, and quelling internal di&s;cord, till the revolving period of a third election approached, when he executed his inter|rupted but inextingui&s;hable de&s;ire of returning to the humble walks of private life.</P>
<P>The promulgation of his fixed re&s;olution, &s;topped the anxious wi&s;hes of an affectionate people, from ad|ding a third unanimous te&s;timonial of their unabated confidence in the man &s;o long enthroned in their hearts. When, before, was affection like this exhibited on earth?&mdash;Turn over the records of antient Greece&mdash;Review the annals of mighty Rome,&mdash;examine the volumes of modern Europe; you &s;earch in vain. America and her Wa&s;hington only afford the dignified exemplification.</P>
<P>The illu&s;trious per&s;onage called by the national voice in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the arduous office of guiding a free people, had new difficulties to encounter: the amicable effort of &s;ettling our difficulties with France, begun by Wa&s;hington, and pur&s;ued by his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in virtue as in &s;tation, proving abortive, America took
<PB N="16" REF="037807_0015_100F54976C5A9188">mea&s;ures of &s;elf-defence. No &s;ooner was the public mind rou&s;ed by pro&s;pect of danger, than every eye was turned to the friend of all, though &s;ecluded from public view, and grey in public &s;ervice: the virtuous veteran, following his plough<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General Wa&s;hington, though opulent, gave much of his time and attention to practical agriculture.</NOTE>, received the unex|pected &s;ummons with mingled emotions of indignation at the unmerited ill-treatment of his country, and of a determination once more to ri&s;k his all in her defence.</P>
<P>The annunciation of the&s;e feelings, in his affect|ing letter to the Pre&s;ident accepting the command of the army, concludes his official conduct.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t in war&mdash;fir&s;t in peace&mdash;and fir&s;t in the hearts of his countrymen, he was &s;econd to none in the humble and endearing &s;cenes of private life; pious, ju&s;t, humane, temperate and &s;incere; uniform, digni|fied and commanding, his example was as edifying to all around him, as were the effects of that example la&s;ting.</P>
<P>To his equals he was conde&s;cending, to his infe|riors kind, and to the dear object of his affections exemplarily tender: correct throughout, vice &s;hud|dered in his pre&s;ence, and virtue always felt his fo&s;|tering hand; the purity of his private character gave effulgence to his public virtues.</P>
<P>His la&s;t &s;cene comported with the whole tenor of his life.&mdash;Although in extreme pain, not a &s;igh,
