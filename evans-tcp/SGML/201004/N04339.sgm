<P>Then &s;aid his Wife unto him, Do&s;t thou &s;till retain thine Integrity? cur&s;e GOD and die: But he &s;aid unto her, Thou &s;peake&s;t as one of the fooli&s;h Women &s;peaketh; what? &s;hall we receive good at the Hand of GOD, and &s;hall we not receive evil?

<P>WE have heard of the <HI>Patience of Job,</HI> and &s;een the <HI>End of the</HI> LORD; which &s;ome excellent <HI>Expo&s;itors</HI> have &s;aid was to give an early and <HI>illu&s;trious Type</HI> of the <HI>Humili|ation of</HI> CHRIST, and <HI>his Sufferings,</HI> in his Way to Glory and <HI>Exaltation,</HI> as our <HI>Interce&s;&s;or</HI> at the right Hand of GOD.</P>
<P>Among the many excelling Examples and <HI>Patterns</HI> given us thro' the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> of <HI>Suffering</HI> Afflicti|on and Patience, no One is more remarkable, noble and illu&s;trious, teaching and affecting than that of JOB'S; in the &s;urpri&s;ing <HI>fir&s;t and &s;econd</HI> A&s;&s;ault of <HI>Satan</HI> upon his <HI>Family, E&s;tate</HI> and <HI>Per&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>The Sovereign and gracious GOD had prov'd <HI>his Grace</HI> in this his Servant in a long <HI>pro&s;perous State;</HI> and now was pleas'd to make a &s;udden <HI>Change</HI> upon him, for an equal <HI>Di&s;play</HI> of the Power and Glory of his Grace in a State of <HI>deepe&s;t Affliction.</HI></P>

<HI>Satan</HI> was greedy of a Permi&s;&s;ion to tempt and <HI>&s;ift</HI> him, as he afterward was to try <HI>Peter.</HI> The cruel <HI>De|vil</HI> &s;poil'd him of his Sub&s;tance, and bereaved him of his <HI>Children</HI> and Servants in one Day; and that in &s;o terri|ble and <HI>judicial</HI> a Manner as might &s;peak mo&s;t dreadful|ly the immediate Hand and utmo&s;t Indignation of <HI>Hea|ven:</HI> But failing of his <HI>Wi&s;h,</HI> hereby to provoke him to <HI>cur&s;e</HI> GOD; he ask'd a further Permi&s;&s;ion to <HI>&s;mite his Body</HI> from Head to Foot, with <HI>Boils</HI> and fiery <HI>Ulcers,</HI> extreamly <HI>painful</HI> and tormenting, as well as <HI>filthy</HI> and loath&s;ome.

<P>But no Word <HI>ami&s;s</HI> falling from the afflicted <HI>Saint,</HI> in this his <HI>de&s;titute and tormented</HI> State; no Words but of <HI>profound</HI> Humility, Re&s;ignation, Wor&s;hip and Thank&s;gi|ving, dropping from his Lips; the &s;ubtle <HI>Tempter</HI> hav|ing &s;pent all his outward <HI>Forces,</HI> betook him&s;elf to his helli&s;h <HI>Craft</HI> and Policy, and annoy'd his gracious <HI>Soul</HI> with diabolical <HI>Sugge&s;tions</HI> and <HI>bla&s;phemous</HI> Thoughts a|gain&s;t GOD; to &s;econd him in which he excited his <HI>Wife,</HI> whom the &s;piteful <HI>Fiend</HI> &s;eems to have left to him on De&s;ign to make <HI>her</HI> his <HI>Tempter</HI> and Tormentor.&mdash; So he afterward grieved our ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR; again&s;t whom not prevailing by more immediate A&s;&s;aults in the <HI>Wilderne&s;s,</HI> he us'd the unwary and ra&s;h Lips of <HI>Peter,</HI> and got him that ju&s;t Rebuke, <HI>"Get thee behind me, Satan.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. Let us beware of <HI>imputing to the Devil</HI> too much of <HI>our own Sin and Guilt,</HI> the corrupt Workings of our own Hearts.

The <HI>regenerate</HI> have the Re|mains and Lu&s;ting of Sin within them; and in its <HI>Pre|valence</HI> at times the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> charges it on indwelling Sin; Rom. vii. 17, 20. <HI>It is Sin which dwelleth in me.</HI> We mu&s;t by no means &s;ay, that the <HI>Agency of the Devil</HI> is in every <HI>Temptation</HI> which Men &s;uffer, or <HI>Sin</HI> which they com|mit: Neither can we &s;ay, that his Hand <HI>is not</HI> in this or that Sin: He is invi&s;ible, and our own wicked Hearts act &s;o in <HI>Conjunction</HI> with him, that &s;ometimes which is mo&s;t to blame is not to be &s;aid. It is <HI>be&s;t</HI> for the <HI>Sinner,</HI> often to take it wholly to <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> but too <HI>common</HI> to hear him laying it to the <HI>Devil.

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Think your <HI>Difficulties</HI> are not <HI>peculiar</HI> to you, but &s;uch as I have met with <HI>frequent</HI> In&s;tances of; tho' Per&s;ons under &s;uch like Difficulties are ready to think them peculiar, and that <HI>no One's Ca&s;e</HI> is like their's.&mdash;It is evident that <HI>Satan</HI>'s De&s;ign is to <HI>hinder</HI> their &s;erving GOD, and u&s;ing the pro|per Means for their own Profit and Comfort; by wa&s;ting away their Time and Lives in unprofitable Exerci&s;es of Mind, needle&s;s Doubts, Scruples, Terrors, and fighting with Shadows; and it &s;oon thro' Melancholly becomes <HI>natural</HI> for them to <HI>pore</HI> upon that which is unprofitable&punc; and thereby they feed their own <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> and <HI>involve</HI> them&s;elves more and more, till they get an <HI>Aver&s;ion</HI> to, and <HI>object</HI> mo&s;t again&s;t, tho&s;e <HI>Things</HI> which have the great|e&s;t Tendency to their <HI>Relief:</HI> There is a certain <HI>Gloom</HI> up|on the Mind which the <HI>Devil</HI> makes great Advantage of; for it weakens the Mind and di&s;ables it from guarding a|gain&s;t him; to his utmo&s;t therefore he &s;trives to <HI>increa&s;e</HI> that Gloom; (for he &s;ees that the <HI>Mind</HI> while under it is like <HI>a City without Walls</HI>) and to that End will ever now and then be ca&s;ting in &s;ome <HI>horrid Tho't,</HI> or fright|ful Sugge&s;tion, or Temptation: And if the Per&s;on in &s;uch
<PB N="92" REF="005366_0090_1018265FAE501FF8">a Ca&s;e goes to <HI>di&s;pute</HI> with him, or <HI>fight</HI> again&s;t him, he often makes his <HI>Advantage</HI> of that very di&s;puting and fighting; and by that Means <HI>plunges</HI> the Soul deep|er and deeper, and entangles it more and more. The be&s;t Way of <HI>re&s;i&s;ting</HI> the &s;ubtle and &s;trong Adver&s;ary is to <HI>neglect</HI> him, turn <HI>from</HI> him, and not <HI>enter</HI> into Di&s;putes with him; nor take &s;o much <HI>Notice</HI> of his Sugge&s;tions, however frightful and horrid, as to be <HI>alarm'd</HI> with them: For if he has once alarm'd and <HI>affrighted</HI> the Soul, then he has gain'd a great <HI>Advantage</HI> again&s;t it, and he will be &s;ure to <HI>improve</HI> it to his utmo&s;t.&mdash;The be&s;t Way is for a Per&s;on to <HI>look unto GOD</HI> for Help, and <HI>go right on his Way,</HI> and not <HI>&s;tand to hear</HI> what the Devil has to &s;ay. This above any other Cour&s;e <HI>di&s;appoints</HI> him, for hereby he <HI>lo&s;es his Opportunity</HI> to try his Strength and <HI>Subtilty</HI> with us; for he knows well that if he can <HI>draw</HI> into a Di&s;pute with him he &s;hall be too <HI>&s;ubtil</HI> for us: A <HI>Re&s;olu|tion</HI> to go &s;tedfa&s;tly right forward in the Way of <HI>Duty</HI> and of <HI>all</HI> Duty, (if one could maintain it) without &s;tand|ing <HI>&s;till,</HI> or turning <HI>a&s;ide,</HI> is one of the be&s;t <HI>Remedies</HI> un|der &s;uch &s;ort of Difficulties.&mdash;The great <HI>Strife</HI> of the Devil is to weaken and <HI>break</HI> &s;uch Per&s;ons <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> and Stedfa&s;t|ne&s;s in the Way of Duty, and either by <HI>Terror</HI> or <HI>Per&s;wa|&s;ion</HI> to make 'em <HI>neglect &s;ome Ordinance,</HI> or &s;ome Duty of our <HI>general</HI> or particular <HI>Calling;</HI> &s;ome Duty of <HI>Wor&s;hip,</HI> or &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary <HI>worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s;</HI> or &s;omething that Providence <HI>calls</HI> us to, by which we might <HI>profit</HI> our Selves, our <HI>Families,</HI> our <HI>Neighbours</HI> or the public <HI>Societies</HI> unto which we belong. And I have ob&s;erv'd that Per|&s;ons under &s;uch Circum&s;tances, being in <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> and Doubts of the <HI>State</HI> of their Souls, <HI>generally take a wrong Cour&s;e</HI> to obtain Satisfaction: they &s;pend all their Time almo&s;t <HI>in anxious poring on pa&s;t Experiences,</HI> and <HI>viewing 'em over and over:</HI> Not but that they <HI>ought to examine</HI> pa&s;t Experience; but this is not <HI>all,</HI> nor yet the <HI>main</HI> Thing they have to do: Deliverance from Doubts and Darkne&s;s, in &s;uch <HI>Ca&s;es,</HI> is not obtain'd chiefly <HI>by Self-Examination,</HI> but <HI>Action</HI> I have always ob&s;erv'd that when Per&s;ons in&s;tead of <HI>applying</HI> them&s;elves with all their

<P N="1">1. They &s;eek him with an <HI>un&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Spirit.</HI> It is true they &s;ometimes &s;eek <HI>earne&s;tly</HI> and with <HI>Bitterne&s;s of Soul;</HI> but there is commonly <HI>a Sort of Unea&s;ine&s;s,</HI> and in|ward <HI>Tumultuou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Unquietne&s;s</HI> of Spirit; which &s;hows a <HI>Want</HI> of that <HI>humble, meek, calm</HI> and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Spirit, that becomes a poor <HI>unworthy Worm,</HI> and more e&s;|pecially a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> or a <HI>Child of GOD,</HI> when GOD <HI>frowns</HI> or <HI>hides his Face.</HI> I have often &s;een <HI>this;</HI> they have &s;ome Degree of that <HI>Frame</HI> which <HI>Job</HI> had before <HI>Elihu</HI> &s;pake, and GOD after him out of the <HI>Whirlwind;</HI> they <HI>complain</HI> "that they <HI>cry to GOD</HI> and he does <HI>not an&s;wer,</HI> they <HI>&s;eek</HI> him but they cannot <HI>find</HI> him; "<HI>they go for|ward, but he is not there; and backward but they can't per|ceive him!</HI> He &s;eems to <HI>&s;hut out their Prayer, and turn a deaf Ear</HI> to them. But I have known many <HI>In&s;tances</HI> of &s;uch as made the&s;e <HI>Complaints,</HI> being brought afterwards by the Grace of GOD to &s;eek him after quite <HI>another</HI> Manner; to lie as it were at his <HI>Foot,</HI> in a humble &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive <HI>quiet</HI> Frame of Spirit, in a great Sen&s;e of their utter <HI>Unworthine&s;s,</HI> and of GOD's Holine&s;s and <HI>Sovereign|ty,</HI> and &s;o remaining in a calm <HI>waiting</HI> Frame; when once they have been brought to <HI>this,</HI> all their <HI>Clouds</HI> have been <HI>&s;catter'd,</HI> and GOD has wonderfully appeared and <HI>unveil'd</HI> him&s;elf for their <HI>Con&s;olation:</HI> and I never knew it <HI>fail,</HI> when Per&s;ons after great <HI>Darkne&s;s,</HI> and having
<PB N="94" REF="005366_0092_101826631B2B3EF8">been long <HI>to&s;s'd</HI> up and down, as in a tempe&s;tuous <HI>Ocean,</HI> have been <HI>brought to this Temper;</HI> GOD has as it were &s;hown him&s;elf in ha&s;te to comfort them; and <HI>ran</HI> (as it were) to <HI>meet</HI> 'em, while they were yet a great Way <HI>off:</HI> CHRIST has been like the &s;wift-footed <HI>Roe,</HI> or the <HI>young Hart on the Mountains of Spices.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Another <HI>Error</HI> in &s;uch Per&s;ons <HI>&s;eeking GOD,</HI> is &s;eek|ing with <HI>Di&s;couragement. Before they ask</HI> they do as it were <HI>conclude</HI> they &s;hall have a <HI>Denial;</HI> and <HI>while</HI> they are asking, they do as it were <HI>tell GOD</HI> that he <HI>won't an|&s;wer 'em;</HI> and &s;o they greatly <HI>di&s;honour</HI> him, deny him the <HI>Glory</HI> of his Grace, and provoke a Denial. They ask in a <HI>heartle&s;s</HI> Manner, becau&s;e in a <HI>di&s;courag'd</HI> Man|ner. Hence they have no <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> to &s;ay as <HI>Jacob</HI> did, "<HI>I will not let thee go, except thou ble&s;s me.</HI> When they <HI>ask</HI> and are <HI>denied,</HI> it has not that <HI>Effect</HI> upon them, as it had upon the <HI>Woman of Canaan,</HI> to make her <HI>cry the more earne&s;tly,</HI> and to be the more <HI>re&s;olute.</HI> On the <HI>con|trary,</HI> they are <HI>knock'd on the Head,</HI> and are ready to conclude, that GOD <HI>don't intend</HI> to &s;how 'em Mercy, and that <HI>his Mercy is clean gone for evermore.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Another <HI>Error</HI> in their &s;eeking is, that they <HI>&s;eek Comfort more than Holine&s;s.</HI> We ought to &s;eek <HI>Comfort,</HI> and the Joy of the <HI>Light of GOD's Countenance,</HI> as of more <HI>Worth</HI> than all the World; but our Minds &s;hould be more <HI>engaged,</HI> and our <HI>Strength</HI> more imploy'd, in an earne&s;t <HI>Care</HI> and Strife to do our <HI>Duty to</HI> GOD, and to <HI>&s;erve</HI> him; than to <HI>attain</HI> the Comfort of <HI>Satisfaction a|bout our own Condition:</HI> It &s;hould be our <HI>Meat and Drink to do the Will of GOD:</HI> If we take effectual Care of <HI>this,</HI> GOD will take Care of our <HI>Comfort,</HI> and will do that for us, which <HI>we</HI> can never do for our Selves: He'll &s;catter our <HI>Clouds</HI> and Darkne&s;s, and fill our Souls with <HI>Light.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Another <HI>Error</HI> in &s;uch Per&s;ons <HI>&s;eeking GOD</HI> is, that they do not &s;eek him in the Way of <HI>all Duty.</HI> It may be they abound in <HI>praying,</HI> and <HI>reading,</HI> and <HI>meditating,</HI> and <HI>fa&s;ting;</HI> and <HI>lie upon their Faces</HI> as <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> did, when <HI>&s;mitten before A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">;</HI> but they are not &s;o thorough in the
<PB N="95" REF="005366_0093_10182665286BC358">mean Time <HI>to &s;earch out the Achan;</HI> the <HI>Tre&s;pa&s;s</HI> in every Way of the <HI>Commandments</HI> of GOD. For GOD is to be &s;ought and <HI>waited on</HI> in the Way of the <HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>every Thing</HI> that he calls us to, whether they be the <HI>Du|ties</HI> of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> or <HI>&s;econd Table:</HI> the immediate Duties of <HI>Religion,</HI> or of <HI>&s;ecular Bu&s;ine&s;s:</HI> The&s;e are <HI>all</HI> of 'em <HI>Wi&s;dom's Gates</HI> and the <HI>Po&s;ts of her Doors,</HI> where we are to <HI>watch</HI> and <HI>wait.</HI></P>
<P>Thus Sir, I have briefly expre&s;s'd my <HI>Thoughts</HI> with Regard unto the <HI>Difficulties</HI> of that Nature which you labour under. <HI>Experience</HI> abundantly convinces me of my <HI>In&s;ufficiency</HI> to relieve in &s;uch Ca&s;es. It is GOD that mu&s;t help to <HI>give good Advice,</HI> and al&s;o to <HI>follow</HI> it. It is the <HI>good Shepherd</HI> mu&s;t <HI>&s;eek his Sheep:</HI> To His Al|&s;ufficient <HI>Power</HI> and Grace I recommend your <HI>Ca&s;e,</HI> and am</P>
