<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE following &s;mall collection was made, and is now produced, with a view to excite &s;erious reflections on the un&s;atisfying and tran&s;itory na|ture of temporal enjoyments; and to promote a fervent concern for the at|tainment of that felicity which will be &s;ure, complete, and permanent.</P>
<P>Piety and virtue, even when ab|&s;tractedly con&s;idered, are truly amia|ble, and appear worthy of our earne&s;t pur&s;uit; but, when recommended by the lives and te&s;timonies of eminent per&s;ons, who have known the world, and experienced the emptine&s;s of its honors, wealth, and plea&s;ures, they derive additional weight, and con&s;train us to acknowledge, that indeed it is our greate&s;t happine&s;s to be religious.</P>
<P>It is one of the many favors which a wi&s;e and gracious Providence hath conferred upon mankind, that in every country, and perhaps in almo&s;t every di&s;trict throughout the earth, he has
<PB N="iv" REF="022686_0003_0FB9F9656A55E400">
&s;tationed &s;ome of his faithful &s;ervants, or returning prodigals, as witne&s;&s;es of his power and goodne&s;s, and as encou|ragers to a life of true purity, piety, and beneficence.</P>
<P>The following pages exhibit a few of tho&s;e &s;triking examples, which, in the quiet hour of reflection, may con|tribute to arre&s;t the carele&s;s and wan|dering, to animate the &s;incere and con|cerned, and to convince or di&s;counte|nance tho&s;e who have been unhappily led to oppo&s;e the highe&s;t truths, and to for&s;ake the fountain of all their ble&s;|&s;ings.</P>
<P>May the con&s;ideration of the&s;e in|&s;tances lead us to &s;erious and timely reflections on our own condition, and to a profitable communion with the greate&s;t and be&s;t of Beings, our divine and unerring Monitor; by which we &s;hall experience a growing concern, that the end of our exi&s;tence may be fully an&s;wered, and the favour of an Almighty Friend &s;ecured. May his gracious protection be witne&s;&s;ed at the clo&s;e of our day, when the &s;hadows of
<PB N="v" REF="022686_0004_0FB9F96D5860C8A0">
the evening &s;hall approach, the glitter|ing vanities of the world be ob&s;cured, and all its friend&s;hips and re&s;ources be found unavailing.</P>
<P>In that awful hour, this great &s;up|port will not only pre&s;erve us from be|ing di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with mournful retro&s;pects on the pa&s;t, or with gloomy apprehen|&s;ions of what is to come, but will af|ford the true&s;t con&s;olation of mind, and enable us to look forward, with animating hope, toward tho&s;e happy regions of peace and joy, which &s;hall then be allotted for our perpetual in|heritance.</P>

<P>THE wi&s;e KING SOLOMON, who, at one &s;ea&s;on of his life, had flattered him&s;elf with great enjoyments from the world; and who, better than mo&s;t men, could compute their amount, gives us the re&s;ult of his experience in the&s;e memorable lines: <Q>I &s;aid in my heart, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy plea&s;ure: and behold, this al&s;o is vanity. I &s;aid of laugh|ter, it is mad; and of mirth, what doth it? I made me great works, builded hou&s;es, planted vineyards, made gardens and orchards, planted trees in them of all kind of fruit; I got me &s;ervants and maidens, al&s;o great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: I gathered me &s;il|ver and gold, and the peculiar trea|&s;ures of kings and provinces; al&s;o

men and women &s;ingers, and the de|lights of the &s;ons of men, as mu&s;ical in&s;truments, and that of all &s;orts. So I was great, and increa&s;ed more than all that were before me in Jeru|&s;alem, and what&s;oever mine eyes de|&s;ired, I kept not from them: I with|held not mine heart from any joy. Then I looked on the works which my hands had wrought, and behold, all was vanity and vexation of &s;pirit.</Q> After this repre&s;entation, he concludes all with, <Q>Fear God, and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man: for God &s;hall bring every work into judgment, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</Q></P>

intimating, there might be a peace to wicked con&s;ciences, that are pa&s;t feeling any thing to be evil, being hardened in the wickedne&s;s of the world.

There have been, indeed, divers forms and &s;hapes of things, thro' the many di&s;pen&s;ations of God to men, an&s;werable to his own wi&s;e ends, in reference to the low and uncertain &s;tate of man in the world. The old world had the Spirit of God, and the new world has the &s;ame

Spirit, both Jew and Gentile, and it &s;trives with all: and they, who have been led by it, have been the good people in every di&s;pen&s;ation of God to the world. And I my&s;elf mu&s;t &s;ay, that I have felt it from a child to convince me of my evil and vani|ty; and it has often given me a true mea&s;ure of this poor world, and &s;ome ta&s;te of divine things; and it is my grief that I did not more ear|ly apply my &s;oul to it: for I can &s;ay, that &s;ince my retirement from the greatne&s;s and hurries of the world, I have felt &s;omething of the work and comfort of it, and that it is both ready and able to in&s;truct, and lead, and pre&s;erve tho&s;e who will humbly and &s;incerely hearken to it. So that my religion is, the good Spirit of God in my heart; I mean what that has wrought in me and for me.</Q></P>

<P>ANTHONY LOWTHER, of Ma&s;k, was a per&s;on of good &s;en&s;e, of a &s;weet temper, a ju&s;t mind, and of a &s;ober education.

<P>The Hon. ROBERT BOYLE, that mo&s;t exact &s;earcher into the works of nature, and who &s;aw athei&s;m and infi|delity beginning to &s;how them&s;elves in the loo&s;e and voluptuous reign of King Charles the Second, pur&s;ued his philo|&s;ophical inquiries with religious views, to e&s;tabli&s;h the minds of men in a firm belief, and thorough &s;en&s;e, of the in|finite power and wi&s;dom of the great Creator.</P>
<P>This account we have from Dr. Bur|net, who was intimately acquainted with him, and who &s;ays, <Q>It appeared from tho&s;e who conver&s;ed with him on his inquiries into nature, that his main de&s;ign in that (on which as he had his own eye con&s;tantly, &s;o he took care to put others often in mind of it) was to rai&s;e in him&s;elf and others, va&s;ter thoughts of the great|ne&s;s
<PB N="53" REF="022686_0051_0FB9FA3A1CC6F568">
and glory, and of the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God.</Q> This was &s;o deep in his thoughts, that he concludes the article of his will, which relates to the Royal Society, in the&s;e words, <Q>Wi&s;hing them a happy &s;ucce&s;s in their attempts to di&s;cover the true nature of the works of God; and praying that they, and all other &s;earchers into phy&s;ical truths, may cordially refer their attainments, to the glory of the great Author of Na|ture, and to the comfort of man|kind.</Q></P>
<P>In another place the &s;ame per&s;on &s;peaks of him thus: <Q>He had the pro|founde&s;t veneration for the great God of heaven and earth, that I ever ob|&s;erved in any man. The very name of God was never mentioned by him, without a pau&s;e and vi&s;ible &s;top in his di&s;cour&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>Of the &s;trictne&s;s and exemplarine&s;s of the whole cour&s;e of his life, he &s;ays: <Q>I might here challenge the whole tribe of libertines, to come and view the u&s;efulne&s;s, as well as

the excellence of the Chri&s;tian reli|gion, in a life that was entirely de|dicated to it.</Q></P>
<P>The veneration he had for the holy &s;criptures appears, not from his &s;tudy|ing them with great attention, and ex|horting others to do the &s;ame; but more particularly, from a di&s;tinct trea|ti&s;e which he wrote on purpo&s;e to de|fend the &s;cripture &s;tyle, and to an&s;wer all the objections which profane and irreligious per&s;ons have made again&s;t it.

<P>Such he is de&s;cribed to be by two eminent men, who per&s;onally knew him, and attended him in his la&s;t &s;ick|ne&s;s.

<PB N="64" REF="022686_0062_0FB9FA639D48BC10">
&s;cales fell from his eyes, as they did from Paul's; his &s;tony heart was open|ed, and &s;treams of tears gu&s;hed out, the bitter, but whole&s;ome, tears of true repentance.</P>
<P>He had advanced to an uncommon height of impiety, having been an ad|vocate in the black cau&s;e of Athei&s;m. He had raked too in the very bottom of the jakes of debauchery, and had been a &s;atyri&s;t again&s;t virtue. But when, like the prodigal in the go&s;pel, he came to him&s;elf, great horror filled his mind, and forced &s;harp and bitter invectives from him, again&s;t him&s;elf; terming him&s;elf the vile&s;t wretch that ever the &s;un &s;hined upon; wi&s;hing he had been a beggar, a link-boy, or a crawling leper in a ditch, or had lived in a dungeon, rather than have offend|ed the Lord as he had done.</P>
<P>Being at one time under great trou|ble of mind, and his con&s;cience full of terror, he told the per&s;on who attend|ed him, that, <Q>When, on his jour|ney, he had been arguing with great|er vigor again&s;t God and religion,
<PB N="65" REF="022686_0063_0FB9FA6CDC377ED8">
than he had ever done in his life|time before, and that he re&s;olved to run them down, with all the argu|ments and &s;pite in the world; but, like the great convert, Paul, he found it hard to kick again&s;t God:</Q> for his heart was at that time &s;truck &s;o pow|erfully, that he argued as much for God and virtue, as ever he had done again&s;t them.</P>
<P>He had &s;uch tremendous apprehen|&s;ions of the Divine Maje&s;ty, mingled with &s;uch delightful contemplations of his nature and perfections, and of the amiablene&s;s of religion, that he &s;aid, <Q>I never was advanced thus far to|wards happine&s;s, in my life before, tho', upon the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome &s;ins extraordinary, I have had &s;ome checks and warnings con&s;iderable from within; but &s;till &s;truggled with them, and &s;o wore them off again. One day at an Athei&s;tical meeting at the hou&s;e of a per&s;on of quality, I undertook to manage the cau&s;e, and was the principal di&s;putant again&s;t God and piety; and, for my per|formances,
<PB N="66" REF="022686_0064_0FB9FA6EDBE10DF0">
received the applau&s;e of the whole company.

But I had form|ed to my&s;elf an odd &s;cheme of reli|gion, which would &s;olve all that God, or con&s;cience, might force upon me; yet I was not ever well reconciled to the bu&s;ine&s;s of Chri&s;tianity, nor had that reverence for the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, which I ought to have had.</Q></P>
<P>This &s;tate of mind continued till the 53d chapter of I&s;aiah was read to him, together with &s;ome other parts of the &s;acred &s;criptures; when it
<PB N="67" REF="022686_0065_0FB9FA705BCF5E98">
plea&s;ed God to fill his mind with &s;uch peace and joy, in believing, that it was remarkable to all about him.</P>
<P>And he frequently de&s;ired tho&s;e who were with him, to read the 53d of I&s;aiah to him, upon which he u&s;ed to de&s;cant in a very affectionate para|phra&s;e, applying the weighty &s;entences thereof to his own humiliation and comfort.</P>
<P><Q>Oh! ble&s;&s;ed God! can &s;uch an horrid creature as I am, be accepted by thee, who have denied thy being, and contemned thy power? Can there be mercy and pardon for me? will God own &s;uch a wretch as I?</Q></P>

<HEAD>The dying Advice of DUNCAN FOR|BES, late LORD PRESIDENT of SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL conclude with that which is the mo&s;t important of all things, and which alone will carry every thing el&s;e along with it; which is to recom|mend, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn and &s;erious manner, the &s;tudy and practice of re|ligion to all &s;orts of men, as that which is both the light of the world, and &s;alt of the earth. Nothing does &s;o open our faculties, and compo&s;e and direct the whole man, as an inward

&s;en&s;e of God; of his authority over us; of the laws he hath &s;et us; of his eye over us; of his hearing our pray|ers; a&s;&s;i&s;ting our endeavours; watch|ing over our concerns; of his being to judge, and reward or puni&s;h us in ano|ther &s;tate, according to what we do in this. Nothing will give a man &s;uch a dete&s;tation of &s;in, and &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the goodne&s;s of God, and of our obli|gations to holine&s;s, as a right under|&s;tanding and firm belief of the Chri|&s;tian religion. Nothing can give a man &s;o calm a peace within, and &s;uch a firm &s;ecurity again&s;t all fears and dangers without, as the belief of a kind, wi&s;e Providence, and of a future &s;tate. Integrity of heart gives a man courage and confidence that cannot be &s;haken. A man is &s;ure that by living according to the rules of religion, he becomes the wi&s;e&s;t, the be&s;t, and the happie&s;t creature that he is capable of being. Hone&s;t indu&s;try, the employing of time well, a con&s;tant &s;obriety, an undefiled purity and cha&s;tity, with a quiet &s;erenity, are the be&s;t pre&s;ervatives
<PB N="92" REF="022686_0090_0FB9FADBF41BD800">
of life and health; &s;o that take a man as an individual, religion is his guard, his perfection, his beauty, and his glo|ry. This will make him a light in the world, &s;hining brightly, and enlighten|ing many round about him.</P>
<P>Thus religion, if truly received and &s;incerely adhered to, would prove the greate&s;t of all ble&s;&s;ings to a nation. But, by religion, I under&s;tand &s;ome|thing more than the receiving of &s;ome doctrines, tho' ever &s;o true, or the pro|fe&s;&s;ing of them, and engaging to &s;up|port them, not without zeal and eager|ne&s;s. What &s;ignify the be&s;t doctrines, if men do not live &s;uitably to them; if they have not a due influence upon their thoughts and their lives? Men of bad lives, with &s;ound opinions, are &s;elf-condemned, and lie under a highly ag|gravated guilt.</P>
<P>By religion, I do not mean an out|ward compliance with forms and cu|&s;toms, in going to church, to prayers, to &s;ermons, and to &s;acraments, with an external &s;how of devotion; or, which is more, with &s;ome inward forced good
<PB N="93" REF="022686_0091_0FB9FADD1D4DADB0">
thoughts, in which many &s;atisfy them|&s;elves, while the&s;e have no vi&s;ible ef|fect on their lives, nor any inward force to &s;ubdue and rectify their appe|tites, pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;ecret de&s;igns. Tho&s;e cu&s;tomary performances, how good and u&s;eful &s;oever, when under&s;tood and rightly directed, are of little value when men re&s;t on them, and think becau&s;e they do them, they have acquit|ted them&s;elves of their duty; tho' they continue &s;till proud, covetous, full of deceit, envy, and malice. Even &s;ecret prayers, the mo&s;t effectual means, are de&s;igned for a higher end; which is to po&s;&s;e&s;s our minds with &s;uch a con&s;tant and pre&s;ent &s;en&s;e of divine truths, as may make the&s;e live in us, and govern us, and draw down &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, as to exalt and &s;anctify our na|tures.</P>
<P>So that, by religion, I mean &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of divine truth as enters into a man, and becomes a &s;pring of a new nature within him; reforming his thoughts and de&s;igns; purifying his heart; &s;anctifying and governing his

whole deportment, his words as well as his actions; convincing him that it is not enough, not to be &s;candalou&s;ly vicious, or to be innocent in his con|ver&s;ation, but that he mu&s;t be intire|ly, uniformly, and con&s;tantly, pure and virtuous, animated with zeal to be &s;till better and better, more eminently good and exemplary.</P>
<P>This is true religion, which is the perfection of human nature, and the joy and delight of every one that feels it active and &s;trong within him. It is true, this is not arrived at all at once, and it will have an unhappy alloy, hanging long even about a good man; but, as tho&s;e ill mixtures are the per|petual grief of his &s;oul, &s;o that it is his chief care to watch over, and to mortify them, he will be in a continu|al progre&s;s, &s;till gaining ground upon him&s;elf; and as he attains to a degree of purity, he will find a flame of life and joy growing up in him. Of this I write with a greater concern and emotion, becau&s;e I have felt this the true, and indeed, the only joy which
<PB N="95" REF="022686_0093_0FB9FAE7B0598488">

<P><Q>True religion (&s;aith he) teaches the &s;oul a high veneration of Almighty God, a &s;incere and upright walking as in the pre&s;ence of the invi&s;ible, all-&s;eeing God; it makes a man tru|ly love, honor, and obey him, and therefore careful to know what his will is; it renders the heart highly thankful to him, as his Creator, Re|deemer, and Benefactor; it makes a man entirely depend on him, &s;eek

It cru&s;heth all pride and haughtine&s;s, both in a man's heart and carriage, and gives him an hum|ble frame of &s;oul and life, both in the &s;ight of God and men; it regu|lates and governs the pa&s;&s;ions of the mind, and brings them into due mo|deration and frame; it gives a man a right e&s;timate of this pre&s;ent world, and &s;ets the heart and hopes above it, &s;o that he never loves it more than it de&s;erves; it makes the wealth, and the glory of this world, high places, and great preferments, but of low and little value to him; &s;o that he is neither covetous nor ambi|tious, nor over &s;olicitous concerning the advantages of them. It makes
<PB N="97" REF="022686_0095_0FB9FAF25BA64710">
him value the love of God, and peace of con&s;cience, above all the wealth and honor in the world, and to be very diligent to keep it inviola|bly; he performs all his duties to God in &s;incerity and integrity; and, whil&s;t he lives on earth, his conver|&s;ation, his hopes, his trea&s;ures, are in heaven, and he endeavours to walk &s;uitably to &s;uch a hope.</Q></P>
<P>Of the inward direction and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the Spirit of God, to the &s;oul, he declares as follows:</P>
<Q><P>Tho&s;e who truly fear God have a &s;ecret guidance from a higher wi&s;|dom than what is barely human, namely, the Spirit of Truth and Wi&s;dom, that doth really and truly, but &s;ecretly, prevent and direct them. Any man that &s;incerely and truly fears Almighty God, and relies, and calls upon him for his guidance and direction, hath it as really as a &s;on hath the coun&s;el and direction of his father; and tho' the voice be not au|dible, nor the direction always per|ceptible, or di&s;cernible, to &s;en&s;e, yet
<PB N="98" REF="022686_0096_0FB9FAF6B034C260">
it is equally as real as if a man heard the voice &s;aying, <Q>This is the way, walk in it.</Q></P>
<P>And this &s;ecret direction of Al|mighty God is principally &s;een in matters relating to the good of the &s;oul; yet it may al&s;o be found in the concerns of this life, which a good man, that fears God, and begs his direction, &s;hall very often, if not at all times, find.</P>
<P>I can call my own experience to witne&s;s that, even in the external actions of my whole life, I was ne|ver di&s;appointed of the be&s;t guidance and direction, when I have, in hu|mility and &s;incerity, implored the &s;e|cret direction and guidance of the Divine Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervation of the &s;ecret ad|monition of the Spirit of God in the heart, is an effectual means to clean&s;e and &s;anctify thy heart, and the more it is attended to, the more it will be conver&s;ant with thy &s;oul, for thy in|&s;truction.&mdash;In the mid&s;t of thy diffi|culties it will be thy coun&s;ellor; in

<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for thee to enjoy that which mu&s;t make thee happy, till thou art deeply &s;en&s;ible of thy own emptine&s;s and nothingne&s;s, and thy &s;pirit thereby brought down and laid in the du&s;t.&mdash;The Spirit of Chri&s;t is an humbling &s;pirit, the more thou ha&s;t of it, the more it will humble thee; and it is a &s;ign that either thou ha&s;t it not, or that it is yet over-ma&s;|tered by thy corruptions, if thy heart be &s;till haughty.</P>

my experience, that I have had no continuing city, or place of habi|tation.

They mu&s;t expre&s;s them as lively, and as naturally, as is po&s;&s;ible for them; and they cannot do &s;o, if they do not, in &s;ome manner, excite them in them|&s;elves, and if their &s;ouls do not take all the changes which we &s;ee in their faces. Tho&s;e then who repre&s;ent a pa&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t be, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, touched with it whil&s;t they repre&s;ent it; and it is not to be imagined, that they can pre&s;ently efface from their minds that impre&s;&s;ion, which they have voluntarily excited in it, and that it does not leave a great di&s;po&s;ition to that &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion which they have been &s;o willingly &s;en&s;ible of. Thus, plays are, even in their nature, a &s;chool, and an exerci&s;e of vice, &s;ince it is an art in which one mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily excite in him&s;elf vicious pa&s;&s;ions.

ten thou&s;and that contributes towards it; but if it be a religious charity, and attended with great and happy effects, his con&s;cience tells him that he is a &s;harer of all that great good to which he contributed. Now, let this teach us, how we ought to judge of the guilt of encouraging any thing that is bad, either with our con&s;ent, our money, or our pre&s;ence. We mu&s;t not con&s;ider how much our &s;ingle part contributes towards it, how much le&s;s we contri|bute than &s;everal thou&s;ands of other people; but we mu&s;t look at the whole thing in it&s;elf; and whatever there is of evil in it, or whatever evil ari&s;es from it, we mu&s;t charge our&s;elves with a &s;hare of the whole guilt of &s;o great an evil.</P>
<P>&mdash;'People of fa&s;hion and quality have great advantage above the vulgar; their condition and education give them a liveline&s;s and brightne&s;s of parts, from whence one might ju&s;tly expect a more exalted virtue. How comes it then, that we &s;ee as ill morals,

as little religious wi&s;dom, and as great di&s;orders among them, as among the mo&s;t rude, uneducated part of the world?

<P>IT mu&s;t appear evident to every &s;ober and unprejudiced mind, that the &s;enti|ments of the&s;e virtuous and enlightened men, again&s;t &s;uch dangerous ways of &s;pending our time, are, indeed, &s;olid and awakening truths. Let us, therefore, as rational beings, Chri&s;tians, who are travelling towards a better country, and are called to renounce the vanities of this peri&s;hing world, a&s;&s;ert the dignity of our nature, and act conformably to the excellence of our de&s;tination. A few fleeting years will bring us all to the verge of an awful &s;cene, where the vain diver&s;ions and pa&s;times of this

At that &s;olemn period, the great bu&s;i|ne&s;s of religion, a pious and virtuous life, dedicated to the love and &s;ervice of God, will appear of ine&s;timable va|lue, and the only thing worthy the pur|&s;uit of rea&s;onable beings.

In the&s;e exalted employments, we &s;hall experi|ence the noble&s;t plea&s;ure, and feel no want of empty and injurious enter|tainments, to occupy our minds, or to fill up our time. We &s;hall abhor
