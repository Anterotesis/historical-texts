<HEAD>A Declaration <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>INa&s;much as the killing tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Cone&s;togo Mannor</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> has been, and may be the Subject of much Conver&s;a|tion; and by invidious Repre&s;entations of it, which &s;ome, we doubt not, will indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread, many, unacquainted with the true State of Affairs, may be led to pa&s;s a &s;everer Cen&s;ure on the Authors of tho&s;e Facts, and any others of tho&s;e like Nature, which may hereaf|ter happen, than we are per&s;uaded they would if matters were duly under&s;tood and deliberated: We think it therefore proper thus openly to declare our&s;elves, and render &s;ome brief Hints of the Rea&s;ons of our Conduct; which we mu&s;t, and frankly do confe&s;s nothing but Nece&s;&s;ity it&s;elf could induce us to, or ju&s;tify us in; as it bears an Appearance of flying in the Face of Authority, and is attended with much Labour, Fatigue and Expence.</P>
<P>OURSELVES then, to a Man, we profe&s;s loyal Subjects to the be&s;t of Kings, our rightful Sovereign GEORGE the THIRD, firmly at|tached to his Royal Per&s;on, Intere&s;t and Go|vernment: And of Con&s;equence equally oppo&s;ite to the Enemies of his Throne and Dignity,
<PB N="4" REF="009630_0003_0F77385045A841E8">whether openly avowed or more dangerou&s;ly concealed under a Mask of fal&s;ly pretended Friend&s;hip, and chearfully willing to offer our Sub&s;tance and Lives in his Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>THESE <HI>Indians</HI> known to be firmly connect|ed in Friend&s;hip with our openly avowed imbit|tered Enemies; and &s;ome of whom have, by &s;everal Oaths, been proved to be Murderers; and, who, by their better Acquaintance with the Situation and State of our Frontiers, were more capable of doing us Mi&s;chief, we &s;aw with Indignation cheri&s;hed and care&s;&s;ed as dear|e&s;t Friends &mdash; But this alas! is but a Part, a &s;mall Part of that exce&s;&s;ive Regard manife&s;ted to <HI>Indians</HI> beyond his Maje&s;ty's loyal Subjects, whereof we complain: And which together with various other Greivances have not only en|flamed with Re&s;entment the Brea&s;ts of a Num|ber, and urged them to the di&s;agreable Evi|dence of it, they have been con&s;trained to give, but have heavily di&s;plea&s;ed, by far, the greate&s;t part of the good Inhabitants of this Province.</P>
<P>SHOULD we here reflect to former Treaties, the exorbitant Pre&s;ents, and great Servility therein paid to <HI>Indians,</HI> have long been oppre&s;|&s;ive Grievances we have groaned under. And when at the la&s;t <HI>Indian</HI> Treaty held at <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> not only was the Blood of our many murdered Brethren tamely covered, but our poor unhap|py captivated Friends abandoned to Slavery among the Savages, by concluding a Friend&s;hip
<PB N="5" REF="009630_0004_0F773852C1F75390">with the <HI>Indians</HI> and allowing them a plenteous Trade of all kinds of Commodities, without tho&s;e being re&s;tored, altho' a &s;pirited Requi&s;i|tion was made of them; how general Di&s;&s;atisfac|tion tho&s;e Mea&s;ures gave, the Murmers of all good People (loud as they dare to utter them) to this Day declare: And had here, infatuated Steps of Conduct and a manife&s;t Partialtity in fa|vour of <HI>Indians</HI> made a final Pau&s;e, happy had it been; we perhaps had grieved in &s;ilence for our abandoned, en&s;laved Brethren among the Heathens. But matters of a later Date are &s;till more flagrant Rea&s;ons of Complaint. When la&s;t Summer his Maje&s;ty's Forces under the Command of Col. BOUQUET marched through this Province and a Demand was made by His Excellency Gen. AMHERST of A&s;&s;i&s;tance to e&s;|cort Provi&s;ions &amp;c. to relieve that important Po&s;t, Fort <HI>Pitt,</HI> yet not one Man was granted, altho' never any Thing appeared more rea&s;onable or nece&s;&s;ary, as the Intere&s;t of the Province lay &s;o much at &s;take and the Standing of the Fron|tier Settlements in any manner, evidently de|pended, under God, on the almo&s;t de&s;paired of Succe&s;s of his Maje&s;ty's little Army, who&s;e Va|lour the whole Frontiers with Gratitude ac|knowledge as the happy Means of having &s;aved from ruin great part of the Province. But when a Number of <HI>Indians</HI> fal&s;ly pretended Friends, and having among them, &s;ome proved on Oath to have been guilty of Murder, &s;ince this War
<PB N="6" REF="009630_0005_0F7738537A156A50">begun, when they together with others known to be his Maje&s;ty's Enemies and who had been in the Battle again&s;t Col. BOUQUET, reduced to Di&s;tre&s;s by the De&s;truction of their Corn at the <HI>Great I&s;land,</HI> and up the Ea&s;t Branch of <HI>Su&s;quehanna,</HI> pretend them&s;elves Friends, and de&s;ire a Sub&s;i&s;tance they are openly care&s;&s;ed, and the Publick, that could not be indulged the Liberty of contributing to his Maje&s;ty's A&s;&s;i&s;|tance, obliged, as Tributaries to Savages, to &s;upport tho&s;e Villains, tho&s;e Enemies to our King and our Country. Nor only &s;o, but the Hands that were clo&s;ely &s;hut, nor would grant his Maje&s;ty's General one &s;ingle Farthing again&s;t a Savage Foe, have been liberally open|ed, and the publick Money lavi&s;hly pro&s;titut|ed to hire, at an exorbitant Rate, a mercenary Guard, to protect his Maje&s;ty's wor&s;t of Ene|mies, tho&s;e fal&s;ly pretended <HI>Indian</HI> Friends, while at the &s;ame Time hundreds of poor di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed Families of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects, obliged to abandon their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and flee for their Lives at lea&s;t, except a &s;mall Relief, at fir&s;t, in the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Circum&s;tances, were left to &s;tarve neglected, &s;ave what the friendly Hand of private Donations has contributed to their Support; wherein they, who are mo&s;t profu&s;e towards Savages, have carefully avoided hav|ing any Part. When la&s;t Summer the Troops rai&s;ed for Defence of the Province, were limited to certain Bounds, nor &s;uffered to attempt an|noying
<PB N="7" REF="009630_0006_0F7738540874DB20">our Enemies in their Habitations, and a Number of brave Voluntiers, equipped at their own Expence, marched in <HI>September</HI> up the <HI>Su&s;quehanna,</HI> met and defeated their Enemy with the lo&s;s of &s;ome of their Number, and having others dangerou&s;ly wounded, not the lea&s;t Thanks or Acknowledgment was made them from the Legi&s;lature for the confe&s;&s;ed Service they had done, nor any the lea&s;t Notice or Care taken of their wounded. Whereas, when a <HI>Seneca</HI> Indian, who, by the information of many, as well as by his own Confe&s;&s;ion, had been through the la&s;t War an inveterate Enemy had got a Cut in his Head la&s;t Summer, in a Quarrel he had with his own Cou&s;in, and it was reported in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> that his Wound was dangerous; a Doctor was immediately em|ployed and &s;ent to Fort <HI>Augu&s;ta</HI> to take care of him and cure him if po&s;&s;ible. To the&s;e may be added, that though it was impo&s;&s;ible to obtain thro' the Summer or even yet any Premium for <HI>Indian</HI> Scalps or Encouragement to excite Vo|lunteers to go forth again&s;t them, yet when a few of them known to be the fa&s;t Friends of our Enemies, and &s;ome of them Murderers them&s;elves; when the&s;e have been &s;truck by a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, bereft, injured Frontier, a liberal Reward is offered for apprehending the Perpe|trators of that horrible Crime of killing his Ma|je&s;ty's cloaked Enemies: And their Conduct painted in the mo&s;t atrocious Colours, while the
<PB N="8" REF="009630_0007_0F773854C6504988">horrid Ravages, cruel Murders and mo&s;t &s;hock|ing Barbarities committed by <HI>Indians</HI> on His Ma|je&s;ty's Subjects are covered over and excu&s;ed under the charitable Term of this being their Method of making War.</P>
<P>BUT to recount the many repeated Griev|ances whereof we might ju&s;tly complain, and In&s;tances of a mo&s;t violent Attachment to <HI>In|dians,</HI> were tedious beyond the Patience of a Job to endure. Nor can better be expected nor need we be &s;urprized at <HI>Indian</HI> In&s;olence and Villainy when it is con&s;idered, and which can be proved from the publick Records in a cer|tain County, That &s;ome time before <HI>Conrad Wei&s;er</HI> died, &s;ome <HI>Indians</HI> belonging to the <HI>Great I&s;land</HI> or <HI>Wyaloo&s;ing</HI> a&s;&s;ured him that&mdash;(an ancient Leader of that Faction, which for &s;o long a Time have found Means to en&s;lave the Province to <HI>Indians</HI>) together with others of the Friends, had given them a Rod to &s;courge the white People that were &s;ettled on the pur|cha&s;ed Lands; for that ONAS had cheated them out of a great deal of Land, or had not given near &s;ufficient price for what he had bought. And that the Traders ought al&s;o to be &s;courged; for that they defrauded the <HI>Indians</HI> by &s;elling Goods to them at too dear a Rate, and that this Relation is matter of fact, can ea&s;ily be proved in the County of <HI>Berks.</HI> Such is our unhappy Situation, under the Villany, Infatuation and Influence of a certain Faction that have got the
<PB N="9" REF="009630_0008_0F7738559266B568">political Reigns in their Hand and tamely ty|rannize over the other good Subjects of the Pro|vince! And can it be thought &s;trange, that a Scene of &s;uch Treatment as this, and the now adding in this critical Juncture to all our former Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, that di&s;agreeable Burden of &s;upport|ing, in the very Heart of the Province, at &s;o great an Expence, between One and Two Hun|dred Savages, to the great Di&s;quietude of the Majority of the good Inhabitants of this Province, &s;hould awaken the Re&s;entment of a People gro&s;&s;|ly abu&s;ed, unrighteou&s;ly burdened, and made Dupes and Slaves to Indians? And mu&s;t not all well di&s;po&s;ed People entertain a charitable Sen|timent of tho&s;e, who at their own great Expence and Trouble, have attempted, or &s;hall attempt re&s;cuing a labouring Land from a Weight &s;o op|pre&s;&s;ive, unrea&s;onable and unju&s;t? It is this we De&s;ign, it is this we are re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute, tho' it is with great Reluctance we are obliged to adopt a Mea&s;ure, not &s;o agreeable as could be de&s;ired, and to which Extremity alone compels.</P>

<HEAD>To the Honourable <HI>JOHN PENN,</HI> E&s;quire, Governor of the Province of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and of the Counties of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle, Kent</HI> and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> on <HI>Delaware;</HI> and to the Repre&s;entatives of the Free-Men of &s;aid Province, in A&s;&s;embly met.</HEAD>
<P>WE <HI>Matthew Smith,</HI> and <HI>James Gib&s;on,</HI> in behalf of our&s;elves, and his Maje&s;|ty's faithful and loyal Subjects, the Inhabitants of the Frontier Counties of <HI>Lanca&s;|ter, York, Cumberland, Berks,</HI> and <HI>Northampton,</HI> humbly beg Leave to remon&s;trate, and to lay be|fore you, the following Grievances, which we &s;ubmit to your Wi&s;dom for Redre&s;s.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. WE apprehend, that as Free-Men and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subjects, we have an indi&s;putable Title to the &s;ame Privileges and Immunities with his Maje&s;ty's other Subjects, who re&s;ide in the inte|rior Counties of <HI>Philadelphia, Che&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Bucks,</HI> and therefore ought not to be excluded from an equal Share with them in the very important Privilege of Legi&s;lation. Neverthele&s;s, con|trary to the Proprietors Charter, and the ac|knowledged principles of Common Ju&s;tice and Equity, our five Counties are re&s;trained from electing more than ten Repre&s;entatives, viz. Four for <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> Two for <HI>York,</HI> Two for <HI>Cumber|land,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="009630_0010_0F773858A4445128">One for <HI>Berks,</HI> and One for <HI>Northampton;</HI> while the Three Counties (and City) of <HI>Phila|delphia, Che&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Bucks,</HI> elect Twenty-&s;ix; this we humbly conceive is oppre&s;&s;ive, unequal and unju&s;t, the Cau&s;e of many of our Grievances, and an infringement of our natural Privileges of Freedom and Equality, wherefore we humbly pray, that we may be no longer deprived of an equal Number with the Three afore&s;aid Counties, to repre&s;ent us in A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. WE under&s;tand that a Bill is now before the Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, wherein it is Provided, that &s;uch Per&s;ons as &s;hall be charged with killing any <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> County, &s;hall not be tried in the County where the Fact was commit|ted, but in the Counties of <HI>Philadelphia, Che&s;ter,</HI> or <HI>Bucks.</HI> This is manife&s;tly to deprive <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Subjects of their known Privileges, to ca&s;t an eternal Reproach upon whole Counties, as if they were unfit to &s;erve their Country in the Quality of Jury-Men, and to contradict the well known Laws of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation; in a point whereon Life, Liberty, and Security e&s;&s;entially depend: Namely, that of being tried by their Equals in the Neighbourhood where their own, their Ac|cu&s;ers, and the Witne&s;&s;es Character and Credit, with the Circum&s;tances of the Fact are be&s;t known, and in&s;tead thereof, putting their Lives in the Hands of Strangers, who may as ju&s;tly be &s;u&s;pected of Partiality to, as the Frontier Coun|ties can be of Prejudices again&s;t Indians; and
<PB N="12" REF="009630_0011_0F773859CC2B72B0">this too in favour of Indians only, again&s;t his Ma|je&s;ty's faithful and loyal Subjects. Be&s;ides it is well known that the De&s;ign of it is to compre|hend a Fact committed before &s;uch a Law was thought of. And if &s;uch Practices were tolle|rated, no man could be &s;ecure in his mo&s;t invalua|ble Intere&s;ts. We are al&s;o informed to our great Surprize, that this Bill has actually received the A&s;&s;ent of a Majority of the Hou&s;e, which we are per&s;waded could not have been the Ca&s;e, had our Frontier Counties been equally repre&s;ented in A&s;&s;embly: However, we hope, that the Le|gi&s;lator of this Province will never enact a Law of &s;o dangerous a tendency, or take away from his Maje&s;ty's good Subjects, a Privilege &s;o long e&s;teemed &s;acred by <HI>Engli&s;h Men.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3dly. DURING the late and pre&s;ent <HI>Indian</HI> Wars, the Frontiers of this Province have been repeatedly attacked and ravaged by Skulking parties of the Indians, who have with the mo&s;t &s;avage Cruelty, murdered Men, Women and Children, without di&s;tinction; and have reduced near a Thou&s;and Families to the mo&s;t extream Di&s;tre&s;s. It grieves us to the very Heart, to &s;ee &s;uch of our Frontier Inhabitants as have e&s;caped from &s;avage Fury, with the lo&s;s of their Parents, their Children, their Husbands, Wives, or Re|latives, left de&s;titute by the Public, and expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t cruel Poverty and Wretchedne&s;s; while upwards of One Hundred and Twenty of the Savages, who are with great Rea&s;on &s;u&s;pect|ed
<PB N="13" REF="009630_0012_0F77385A209844D0">of being guilty of the&s;e horrid Barbarities, under the Mask of Friend&s;hip, have procured them&s;elves to be taken under the Protection of the Government, with a view to elude the Fu|ry of the brave Relatives of the Murdered; and are now maintained at the public Expence: Some of the&s;e Indians now in the Barracks of <HI>Phila|delphia,</HI> are confe&s;&s;edly a part of the <HI>Wyalu&s;ing Indians,</HI> which Tribe is now at War with us; and the others are the <HI>Moravian Indians,</HI> who living among&s;t us under the Cloak of Friend&s;hip, carried on a Corre&s;pondence with our known Enemies on the <HI>Great-I&s;land.</HI> We cannot but ob&s;erve with Sorrow and Indignation, that &s;ome Per&s;ons in this Province are at pains to extenuate the barbarous Cruelties practi&s;ed by the&s;e &s;avages on our Murdered Brethren and Relatives, which are &s;hocking to human Nature, and mu&s;t pierce every Heart but tho&s;e of the hardened Perpe|trators or their Abettors. Nor is it le&s;s Di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing to hear others pleading, that altho' the <HI>Wy|alu&s;ing</HI> Tribe is at War with us, yet that part of it which is under the Protection of the Go|vernment may be friendly to the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and Innocent. In what Nation under the Sun was it ever the Cu&s;tom, that when a neighbouring Na|tion took up Arms, not an individual of the Nation &s;hould be touched, but only the Per&s;ons that offered Ho&s;tilities? Who ever proclaimed War with a part of a Nation, and not with the Whole? Had the&s;e Indians di&s;approved of the
<PB N="14" REF="009630_0013_0F77385AC9E29808">Perfidy of their Tribe, and been willing to cul|tivate and pre&s;erve Friend&s;hip with us, why did they not give Notice of the War before it hap|pened, as it is known to be the Re&s;ult of long Deliberations, and a preconcerted Combination among&s;t them? Why did they not leave their Tribe immediately, and come among&s;t us before there was ground to &s;u&s;pect them, or War was actually waged with the Tribe? No, they &s;tay|ed among&s;t them, were privy to their Murders and Ravages, untill we had de&s;troyed their Pro|vi&s;ions, and when they could no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;t at Home, they came, not as De&s;erters, but as Friends, to be maintained thro' the Winter, that they may be able to &s;calp and butcher us in the Spring.</P>
<P>AND as to the <HI>Moravian Indians,</HI> there are &s;trong grounds, at lea&s;t to &s;u&s;pect their Friend|&s;hip, as it is known that they carried on a Cor|re&s;pondence with our Enemies, on the <HI>Great I&s;land.</HI> We killed three <HI>Indians</HI> going from <HI>Bethelem</HI> to the <HI>Great-I&s;land,</HI> with Blankets, Ammunition and Provi&s;ions; which is an unde|niable Proof, that, the <HI>Moravian Indians</HI> were in confederacy with our open Enemies. And we cannot but be filled with Indignation, to hear this Action of ours, painted in the mo&s;t odious and dete&s;table Colours, as if we had inhumanly murdered our Guides, who pre&s;erved us from peri&s;hing in the Woods; when we only killed three of our known Enemies, who attempted
<PB N="15" REF="009630_0014_0F77385C5C2761D8">to &s;hoot us when we &s;urprized them. And be|&s;ides all this, we under&s;tand that one of the&s;e very <HI>Indians</HI> is proved by the Oath of <HI>Stenton</HI>'s Widow to be the very Per&s;on that murdered her Husband. How then comes it to pa&s;s, that he alone of all the <HI>Moravian Indians</HI> &s;hould join with the Enemy to murder that Family? Or can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that any Enemy Indians contrary to their known Cu&s;tom of making War, &s;hould penetrate into the Heart of a &s;ettled Country, to burn, plunder and murder the Inhabitants, and not mole&s;t any Hou&s;es on their Return, or ever be &s;een or heard of? Or how can we account for it that no Ravages have been committed in <HI>Northampton</HI> County &s;ince the Removal of the <HI>Moravian Indians,</HI> when the <HI>Great Cove</HI> has been &s;truck &s;ince? The&s;e things put it beyond doubt with us, that the <HI>Indians</HI> now at <HI>Philadel|phia,</HI> are His Maje&s;ty's perfidious Enemies, and therefore to protect and maintain them at the public Expence, while our &s;uffering Brethren on the Frontiers are almo&s;t de&s;titute of the Nece&s;|&s;aries of Life and are neglected by the Public, is &s;ufficient to make us mad with Rage, and tempt us to do what nothing but the mo&s;t violent Ne|ce&s;&s;ity can vindicate. We humbly and ear|ne&s;tly pray therefore that the&s;e Enemies of his Maje&s;ty may be removed as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible out of the Province.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. WE humbly conceive that it is contra|ry to the Maxims of good Policy and extreamly
<PB N="16" REF="009630_0015_0F77385DAE2245B0">dangerous to our Frontiers, to &s;uffer any <HI>Indians</HI> of what Tribe &s;oever, to live within the inhabited Parts of this Province, while we are engaged in an <HI>Indian</HI> War; as Experience has taught us that they are all Perfidious, and their Claim to Freedom and Independency puts it in their Power to act as Spies, to entertain and give In|telligence to our Enemies, and to furni&s;h them with Provi&s;ions and warlike Stores. To this fa|tal Intercour&s;e between our pretended Friends and open Enemies we mu&s;t a&s;cribe the greate&s;t Part of the Ravages and Murders that have been committed in the Cour&s;e of this and the la&s;t <HI>In|dian</HI> War. We therefore pray that this Greiv|ance be taken under con&s;ideration and remedied.</P>
<P N="5">5th. WE cannot help lamenting that no Pro|vi&s;ion has been hitherto made, that &s;uch of our Frontier Inhabitants as have been wounded in defence of the Province, their Lives and Liber|ties, may be taken care of and cured of their Wounds at the public Expence. We therefore pray that this Grievance may be redre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. IN the late <HI>Indian</HI> War this Province, with others of his Maje&s;ty's Colonies gave re|wards for <HI>Indian</HI> Scalps, to encourage the &s;eeking them in their own Country, as the mo&s;t likely Means of de&s;troying or reducing them to rea&s;on. But no &s;uch Encouragement has been given in this War, which has damped the Spirits of many brave Men, who are willing to venture their Lives in Parties again&s;t the Enemy. We
<PB N="17" REF="009630_0016_0F77385E185A2568">therefore pray that public Rewards may be pro|po&s;ed for <HI>Indian</HI> Scalps, which may be ade|quate to the Dangers attending Enterpri&s;es of this Nature.</P>
<P N="7">7th. WE daily lament that Numbers of our neare&s;t and deare&s;t Relatives are &s;till in Captivity among&s;t the &s;avage Heathen, to be trained up in all their Ignorance and Barbarity, or be tortured to death with all the Contrivances of <HI>Indian</HI> cruel|ty, for attempting to make their E&s;cape from Bondage. We &s;ee they pay no regard to the many &s;olemn Promi&s;es which they have made to re&s;tore our Friends, who are in Bondage among&s;t them; we therefore earne&s;tly pray that no Trade may hereafter be permitted to be car|ried on with them, untill our Brethren and Re|latives are brought home to us.</P>
<P N="8">8thly. WE complain that a certain Society of People in this Province in the late <HI>Indian</HI> War and at &s;everal Treaties held by the Kings Repre|&s;entatives, openly loaded the <HI>Indians</HI> with Pre|&s;ents and that &mdash; a Leader of the &s;aid Society, in defiance of all Government not only abetted our <HI>Indian</HI> Enemies, but kept up a private Intelligence with them, and publickly received from them a Belt of Wampum, as if he had been our Governor or authorized by the King to treat with his Enemies. By this Means the <HI>Indians</HI> have been taught to di&s;pi&s;e us as a weak and di&s;united People and from this fa|tal Source have aro&s;e many of our Calamities
<PB N="18" REF="009630_0017_0F77385E85CED4E8">under which we groan. We humbly pray therefore this Grievance may be redre&s;&s;ed and that no private Subject be hereafter permitted to treat with or carry on a Corre&s;pondence with our Enemies.</P>
<P N="9">9thly. WE cannot but ob&s;erve with &s;orrrow that Fort <HI>Augu&s;ta</HI> which has been very ex|pen&s;ive to this Province, has afforded us but little a&s;&s;i&s;tance, during this or the la&s;t War. The Men that were &s;tationed at that Place neither helped our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Inhabitants to &s;ave their Crops, nor did they attack our Enemies in their Towns, or patrole on our Frontiers. We hum|bly reque&s;t, that proper Mea&s;ures may be taken to make that Garri&s;on more &s;erviceable to us in our Di&s;tre&s;s, if it can be done.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> WE are far from intending any Reflec|tion again&s;t the Commanding Officer &s;tationed at <HI>Augu&s;ta,</HI> as we pre&s;ume his Conduct was always directed by tho&s;e from whom he received his Orders.</P>
