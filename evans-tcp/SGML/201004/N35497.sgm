<P>WHEN the following &s;ermon was compo&s;ed and de|livered, the author had not the mo&s;t di&s;tant in|tention, nor expectation that it would ever undergo the pre&s;s. It was delivered on different &s;abbaths, that is, as two &s;ermons, though compo&s;ed as one: and the author had ju&s;t the &s;ame &s;imple intention in it, as all his other mini&s;trations to his flock, viz. to promote the cau&s;e of truth, piety and virtue among tho&s;e to whom he mini&s;ters.

<P>Let the word of Chri&s;t dwell in you richly in all wi&s;dom, teaching and admoni&s;hing one another in p&s;alms, and hymns, and &s;piritual &s;ongs, finging with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</P></Q>

<P>_IT is, I pre&s;ume, the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of all rational creatures, to prai&s;e God in that manner to which the powers of their na|ture, re&s;pectively, enable them. And I pre&s;ume al&s;o, that among all the ranks of rational creatures of which we have any knowledge, and who have either retained their innocence, or have return|ed to God after offending him, it will be found, that prai&s;e maks a principle part of their devotion. Thus Jehovah &s;ays, that when he laid the foundations of the earth, "the morning &s;tars &s;ang together, and the &s;ons of God &s;houted for joy."<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Job. 38, 7.</NOTE> And from the vi&s;ions which the Apo&s;tle John had of the heavenly world, it plainly appears, that angels and the &s;pririts of ju&s;t men made perfect are chiefly employed in the plea&s;ing exerci&s;e.<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Rev. 5, 9.&mdash;1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">., 3.&mdash;15, 3, and many other place.</NOTE></P>
<P>With regard to the church on earth, it is evident, that compo&s;itions in prai&s;e of God, were made and u&s;ed in the early periods of it; &s;ome of which, on great and &s;ingular occa&s;ions, are tran&s;mitted down to
<PB N="6" REF="046389_0004_1021573F28D1C888">us;<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Exod, 15 chap.</NOTE> and in after times, when the church was more fully organized, a large collection of &s;uch compo&s;iti|ons was u&s;ed in Divine Wor&s;hip, formed chiefly by David, the &s;weet P&s;almi&s;t of I&s;rael. Under the go&s;|pel di&s;pen&s;ation the duty of the church, and of indi|viduals, in this, as in other re&s;pects, is &s;till more clear|ly revealed. Chri&s;t the Lawgiver and Pattern of his Church, &s;ung an hymn with his di&s;ciples after he had in&s;tituted and celebrated the ordinance of his &s;upper: and his Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;ly enjoins it upon all, not only in my text, as you have heard, but al&s;o in his epi&s;tle to the Ephe&s;ians, in the&s;e words, "And be not drunk with wine, wherein is exce&s;s; but be filled with the &s;pirit; &s;peaking to your&s;elves in p&s;alms, and hymns, and &s;piritual &s;ongs, &s;inging and making melody in your heart to the Lord."<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Ephe&s;, 5. 18, 19.</NOTE> Moreover, comparing this pa&s;&s;age with the text, it will appear, that <HI>prai&s;ing God</HI> is an act of wor&s;hip which &s;hould be performed both in public and in private: for as in the one we are com|manded to teach and admoni&s;h one another, &s;o in the other to &s;peak to our&s;elves in p&s;alms, hymns, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But it may be enquired&mdash;Do all the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>p&s;alms, hymns</HI> and <HI>&s;piritual &s;ongs,</HI> &s;ignify one and the &s;ame thing; and particularly, do they mean the Book of P&s;alms contained in the old Te&s;tament, exclu&s;ive of all others?</P>
<P>The &s;olution of this is of con&s;iderable importance &mdash;And to it I an&s;wer, that the&s;e terms neither mean one and the &s;ame thing originally, nor have we any rea&s;on to conclude that they re&s;er to any one &s;y&s;tem or collection of compo&s;itions whatever, which was extant in the Apo&s;tles days for prai&s;ing God, and exclu&s;ive of all others.</P>
<P>The word <HI>p&s;alm</HI> originally means <HI>a compo&s;ition of mu&s;ical notes, tune</HI> or <HI>air</HI> performed upon an in&s;trument
<PB N="7" REF="046389_0005_10215740B38F2478">of mu&s;ic, and was not nece&s;&s;ary to be accompanied with either words or voice. It is derived from a <HI>root</HI> which &s;ignifies, <HI>to &s;trike gently,</HI> or more with a certain agitation; becau&s;e the &s;trings of mu&s;ical in&s;truments require to be &s;truck or moved with the fingers or other in&s;trument for that purpo&s;e. David was finely &s;killed in in&s;trumental mu&s;ic, as well as in poetry: and it is undeniable that throughout the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation, e&s;pecially in his time, in&s;truments of mu&s;ic were u&s;ed in the wor&s;hip of God. On this account it was, that the compo&s;itions of David, and of others, which were u&s;ed by the Jewi&s;h Church, were called <HI>p&s;alms,</HI> be|cau&s;e whil&s;t the choir and others &s;ung the words, the mu&s;icians always performed the tune upon &s;ome in|&s;trument. Hence it is that we find them directing their compo&s;itions to the mu&s;ician, to be performed on &s;uch or &s;uch an in&s;trument. And hence al&s;o it is, that they &s;o frequently call upon the church to prai&s;e God with timbrel, p&s;altery, harp, organ, &amp;c.</P>
<P>A <HI>hymn</HI> is a poetical compo&s;ition, or ver&s;es, made to celebrate &s;ome per&s;on, or action, or to bewail &s;ome mournful event; without any regard to mu&s;ic. It is de&s;igned to be read or recited; and although it may be accompanied with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n in&s;trument, or the voice, yet the&s;e are not nece&s;&s;ary to its origmal de&s;ign.</P>
<P>The meaning of the term <HI>&s;ong,</HI> is univer&s;ally known&mdash;it is always de&s;igned for the voice&mdash;to be &s;ung with an air &s;uited to the mea&s;ure of the ver&s;e. But the Apo&s;tle directs that the &s;ongs of chri&s;tians &s;hould be of a particular kind, as to their &s;ubject matter, viz. <HI>&s;piri|tual;</HI> that is to &s;ay, &s;ongs on &s;piritual &s;ubjects&mdash;&s;ubjects calculated to give religious in&s;truction, and to rai&s;e, or quicken devotion in the &s;oul.</P>
<P>I well know there are many who &s;uppo&s;e, that the Apo&s;tle, by all tho&s;e various terms, meant nothing more, nor le&s;s than the Book of P&s;alms contained in
<PB N="8" REF="046389_0006_10215743377B79D8">the Old Te&s;tament. But this is mere opinion: nor have I ever &s;een, or heard any thing in &s;upport of it, but opinion, or bare a&s;&s;ertion.&mdash;There are no authen|tic records, &s;acred or profane, which prove that the p&s;alms of David bore the&s;e various titles, or were de|nominated by them.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">To be &s;atisfied re&s;pecting the truth of this &s;entiment, the candid reader may con&s;ult tho&s;e writers, ancient and modern, who have treated this &s;ubject expre&s;sly, &s;uch as Theophylact and Hierom among the ancients&mdash;Calvin and Edwards among the moderns. Their own opinions and conjectures, or the opinions and conjectures of others equally de&s;titute of authority, is all the evidence they produce to prove that the Apo&s;tle here means the p&s;alms of David, exclu&s;ive of all others. And it is very ob&s;er|vable, that, however they agree in this opinion, no two of them agree as to which of the&s;e compo&s;itions were called p&s;alms, which of them hymns, which of them &s;pi|ritual &s;ongs;&mdash;nor why they obtained the&s;e different epi|thets. Hierom &s;ays p&s;alms contain moral &s;ubjects which we ought to practi&s;e. In direct oppo&s;ition to him, Doctor Edwards &s;ays, it is a term of great latitude, and is u&s;ed for all tho&s;e &s;ongs which contain in them the prai&s;es of God and &s;et forth his &s;acred attributes and perfections, and in any way expre&s;s devotion, or contribute to piety and holine&s;s. And Calvin, differing from both, alledges that the&s;e compo&s;itions which were accompanied with a mu&s;ical in&s;trument, were called p&s;alms&mdash;Again, Hie|rom a&s;&s;erts, that an hymn has for its &s;ubject &s;acred things, &s;uch as we ought to contemplate and meditate upon. Dr. Edwards &s;ays that tho&s;e compo&s;itions, which were more complete than p&s;alms, were called hymns; being of a more &s;ingular and peculiar &s;train. And Calvin defines it thus, "a &s;ong of prai&s;e whether &s;ung with a high voice or otherwi&s;e." Once more, Hierom concludes, that &s;piritual &s;ongs belong to natural things which we ought to debate and di&s;en&s;s. Dr. Edwards explains them as being &s;till more perfect compo&s;itions than even hymns; and as hav|ing for their &s;ubject matter the perfections of God as they re&s;pect us; flow from a &s;piritual frame and to be &s;ung with great emotion of &s;pirit. And &s;till differing from the&s;e, Calvin &s;ays, that &s;piritual &s;ongs are &s;uch p&s;alms as not only contain prai&s;es, but exhortations, and other argu|ments.
<P>As vague and un&s;atisfactory is the conjecture of tho&s;e who alledge that the Apo&s;tle u&s;ed the&s;e different terms in conformity to the Hebrew di&s;tinction of the book of p&s;alms, by the terms Mizmorim, Tehillim, and Shu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im. For, if it &s;hould be even granted, that &s;uch a di&s;tinction was authoritative and general among the Jews, yet neither will this prove that the Apo&s;tle meant the &s;ame thing; nor, indeed, do all the various and contradictory expo&s;i|tions which are given of the&s;e words, accord with his phra|&s;es. Some &s;ay, the Mizmorim were p&s;alms which treated of various &s;ubjects&mdash;others, that they were &s;uch as were attended with in&s;truments. Some, that the Tehillim only mentioned the prai&s;es of God&mdash;others, that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> prayers generally &s;ung. Some, that the Shurim were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> artfully compo&s;ed, and &s;ung with the help of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ent&mdash;others, that they were &s;ongs containing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">roper and immediate acts of devotion addre&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> but al&s;o moral and religious in&s;truction. Thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rious and contradictory opinions, founded on co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> and fancy, like the iron race of Cadmus, ri&s;e up and devour each other.</P></NOTE> On the contrary, we know
<PB N="9" REF="046389_0007_102157465FE9FF88">that whenever Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles quote that part of &s;cripture, they do it under the title <HI>p&s;alms</HI>&mdash;never <HI>hymns</HI> or <HI>&s;piritual &s;ongs.</HI> Thus the Saviour quotes that book in the following pa&s;&s;ages, "As David him|&s;elf &s;aith in the book of p&s;alms."<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Luke 20, 42.</NOTE> "All things mu&s;t be fulfilled which were written concerning me in the law of Mo&s;es, and in the Prophets, and in the p&s;alms."<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Luke 24, 44.</NOTE> Thus al&s;o Peter, "For it is written in the book of p&s;alms."<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Acts 1, 20.</NOTE> And thus too Paul, "As it is
<PB N="10" REF="046389_0008_10215749B8E7BBD8">written in the &s;econd p&s;alm"<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Acts 13, 33.</NOTE>&mdash;On the other hand, when the term <HI>hymn</HI> is u&s;ed in the New Te&s;tament, there is no circum&s;tance to make it &s;o much as <HI>probable</HI> that the &s;acred writer had any reference to the book of p&s;alms, or to any compo&s;ition in it. The only places where the word is u&s;ed, are my text&mdash;the fifth chapter and nineteenth ver&s;e of the Epi&s;tle to the Ephe&s;ians, and Marks and Matthews Go&s;pels, where they record that Chri&s;t &s;ung an <HI>hymn</HI> with his di&s;ciples, after the in&s;titution and celebration of his &s;upper.<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Matt. 26, 30&mdash;Mark 14&punc; 26.</NOTE> Now in all the&s;e places, there is no one con&s;ideration from the &s;cope of the context, or otherwi&s;e, to make it certain, or even &s;o much as likely, that the Old Te&s;tament p&s;alms were meant by it. Some, indeed, have alledg|ed that what Chri&s;t &s;ung, after the celebration of his &s;upper, was the Jewi&s;h <HI>Hallel,</HI> beginning with the 113th and ending with the 118th p&s;alm. But this is &s;till <HI>opinion</HI>&mdash;an opinion, too, very &s;lenderly founded: for the only rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned is, that the Jews always &s;ung this portion of the p&s;alms when they celebrated their pa&s;&s;over fea&s;t. And &s;urely it is very extraordina|ry rea&s;oning, to conclude, that becau&s;e the Jews &s;ung <HI>this</HI> on <HI>that occa&s;ion,</HI> therefore the Saviour &s;ung the &s;ame, when he had &s;et that ordinance entirely a&s;ide, and had in&s;tituted a quite different one in its room.&mdash;It is ju&s;t &s;uch rea&s;oning as if one were to &s;ay, the pre|mi&s;es are <HI>different,</HI> therefore the conclu&s;ion mu&s;t be the <HI>&s;ame.</HI> Divine wi&s;dom has not &s;een it fit to re|cord particularly, what the Saviour &s;ung on that occa|&s;ion; but as he had then in&s;tituted a <HI>new ordinance,</HI> of which there is no hint in the Old Te&s;tament, I leave it with every one to judge for him&s;elf whether it be not mo&s;t probable that he him&s;elf compo&s;ed the hymn he &s;ung; e&s;pecially as none of the p&s;alms directly ap|ply to that ordinance; and e&s;pecially, too, as the Evan|geli&s;ts
<PB N="11" REF="046389_0009_1021574B4D630C38">who record the tran&s;action, call it, uniform|ly, <HI>an hymn.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the whole,&mdash;as the&s;e <HI>terms</HI> originally &s;ignify different things&mdash;and as there is no <HI>evidence</HI> that the book of p&s;alms, u&s;ed by the Jews, ever obtained, or was known by the&s;e various titles; but that, on the contrary, indeed, the title, <HI>p&s;alms,</HI> was appropriate to it: it will be obvious to conclude, that the Apo&s;tle did not, by all the&s;e <HI>terms,</HI> mean that book, exclu&s;ive of all others; nor, indeed, any one &s;y&s;tem, or collection of compo&s;itions then extant. The plain, ea&s;y, natural, un&s;ophi&s;ticated &s;en&s;e of the words is, <HI>every kind of &s;a|cred poetry,</HI> whatever denomination it might come un|der, whether p&s;alm, or hymn, or &s;piritual &s;ong; and not only tho&s;e which were then compo&s;ed and in u&s;e in the chri&s;tian Church, but al&s;o tho&s;e which, from the fullne&s;s of the word of Chri&s;t dwelling in believers, they might be enabled, from time to time, to compo&s;e for their mutual edification, and the glory of God.&mdash; And agreeably to this, I &s;hall &s;ubmit the following pa|raphra&s;e of the whole ver&s;e, "Let the word of Chri&s;t, the glorious go&s;pel,<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">When this di&s;cour&s;e was compo&s;ed, I thought it was not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay a &s;ingle word to prove that the word of Chri&s;t, &s;ignifies the Go&s;pel, particularly; this &s;en&s;e of it being &s;o obvious, &s;o natural, and &s;o agreeable, to the uniform language of the New-Te&s;tament. I find, how|ever, &s;ince, that it has been interpreted as meaning the whole of Divine Revelation; with a view to &s;trengthen the opinion, that the Apo&s;tle, by the terms, p&s;alms, hymns, and &s;piritual &s;ongs, meant the book of p&s;alms exclu|&s;ively. Let it, therefore, be ob&s;erved, that this phra&s;e in the plain and native import of the words, has &s;o ex|pre&s;s a reference to what God has revealed to us in the&s;e la&s;t times, by his SON, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from what he re|vealed by the Prophets under former di&s;pen&s;ations (&s;ee Heb. 1.1, 2.) that one &s;hould certainly have &s;ome very clear and unequivocal proof, before any other &s;en&s;e be admit|ted. None &s;uch, however, has been, and I pre&s;ume, none &s;uch can be given. At any rate, it is no proof, to a&s;&s;ert roundly, that it means the whole of Divine Revelation; and then exerci&s;e the invention to find rea&s;ons why it may have, in&s;tead of proving that it actually has this meaning. &mdash;The truth is, not only the native &s;en&s;e of the words, but almo&s;t innumerable parallel places, both in the context, and el&s;ewhere (compare, among many others, Mark 8, 38) Luke 9, 26. John 5, 24; 8, 31. Acts 13, 26. Rom. 10, 8. 2. Cor. 5, 19. Eph. 4, 20, 21. Col. 1, 5. Heb. 2, 3. prove that &s;uch phra&s;es always refer to the di&s;coveries made under the go&s;pel, as contradi&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e made under the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation&mdash;con&s;equently, that is a mere arbitrary interpretation to extend it any further here. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uppo&s;e it &s;hould be even granted, that this phra&s;e means the whole of Divine Revelation, yet this would not affect the doctrine exhibited in the following pages&mdash;for if it includes the Go&s;pel di&s;coveries at all, (which, I believe, is allowed by all) it will &s;upport what I plead for, viz. that our p&s;almody &s;hould contain the&s;e di&s;coveries, otherwi&s;e we cannot, by it, teach them to one another, as the apo&s;tle directs.

With regard to the <HI>manner</HI> of performing this duty, I &s;hall not trouble you with the controver&s;y, whether in&s;truments of mu&s;ic &s;hould be u&s;ed in chri&s;|tian wor&s;hip, or not. Perhaps this is but a matter of doubtful di&s;putation; and the propriety or improprie|ty of it, may depend much upon the &s;entiments of the wor&s;hipping a&s;&s;embly. We certainly know it was practi&s;ed under former di&s;pen&s;ations, with the Divine approbation; and the new Te&s;tament does not forbid, neither does it command it. But this is certain, that we &s;hould prai&s;e God with the <HI>voice,</HI> in an <HI>air</HI> or tune adapted to the mea&s;ure of the ver&s;e. The melody of the heart&mdash;the joyful frame of the &s;pirit&mdash;or any in|ward exerci&s;es whatever, will not come up to the ordi|nance
<PB N="14" REF="046389_0012_10215753D0634060">nor an&s;wer its end without the &s;ound of the voice. Nothing can be more evident than this, both from the Old and New Te&s;tament. Many are the places where David exhorts to &s;ing to God; yea, to &s;ing loud<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, 6, 66, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE>&mdash;Chri&s;t and his di&s;ciples &s;ung<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Matthew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">6, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE>&mdash;all that followed him as he approached Jeru&s;alem, ju&s;t before his &s;ufferings, &s;ung his prai&s;e as they de&s;cended the Mount of Olives<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Luke 19, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE>&mdash;and the Apo&s;tle in my text, and in Ephe&s;ians 5, 19, commands to &s;ing.</P>
<P>But although the &s;ound of the voice is <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to the performance of this duty, yet the exerci&s;e of <HI>grace</HI> in the heart, which the Apo&s;tle, el&s;ewhere, terms <HI>the melody of the heart,</HI> is as nece&s;&s;ary. For unle&s;s tho&s;e devout affections and gracious di&s;po&s;itions that are cor|re&s;pondent to the &s;ubject, be awakened, and in exer|ci&s;e, we &s;hall only be drawing near to God with our mouths, and honoring him with our lips, whil&s;t our hearts are far from him.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t al&s;o &s;ing with <HI>under&s;tanding</HI> and <HI>judgment.</HI> This indeed, is nece&s;&s;ary in every part of religious wor&s;hip&mdash;The rational offspring of the All-intelligent Father, mu&s;t &s;erve him in a way proper to the capacity be has given them: and we may ju&s;t as well pray to him in an unknown tongue, as &s;ing his prai&s;e in words or phra&s;es which we do not under&s;tand. A piece of &s;ounding bra&s;s or tinkling cymbal is not more worth|le&s;s, in the divine e&s;timation, than we &s;hall be, if we offer him a blind, unmeaning &s;ervice, which, from the nature of things mu&s;t al&s;o be unpro&s;itable to our&s;elves.

<P>Once more, our prai&s;es as well as prayers, &s;hould be offered in the name of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Our

We &s;hould be exerci&s;ed toward him according to the di&s;coveries which we have re&s;pecting <HI>his per&s;on&mdash;his character&mdash;his offices;</HI> and particularly make u&s;e of his NAME as our great <HI>plea</HI> with God. That is, that <HI>new manner</HI> of approaching the Mo&s;t High, by that new and living way which Chri&s;t hath con&s;ecrated through the vail of his fle&s;h, which is peculiar to the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation&mdash;which &s;aints under the law were not in&s;tructed in&mdash;and which is not to be found in their prayers or prai&s;es. All this is evident from the following &s;criptures&mdash;"And what&s;oever ye &s;hall a&s;k in <HI>my name,</HI>" faith the Saviour, "that will I do; that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

<P>The&s;e are remarkable pa&s;&s;ages, declaring the duty, and the privilege of chri&s;tians, beyond what was di&s;|covered to the Jews, or even to Chri&s;t's own di&s;ciples
<PB N="16" REF="046389_0014_10215759413324E8">before that time. "Hitherto," &s;ays he, "ye have a&s;ked nothing in <HI>my name.</HI>" This was the ca&s;e in the Jewi&s;h wor&s;hip, and is &s;o &s;till with them. "But the time cometh when I &s;hall &s;hew you plainly of the Father." The time referred to here, was very probably the day of Pentico&s;t. "At that day," adds he, "ye &s;hall a&s;k in <HI>my name.</HI>" And it is very remarkable that the Apo&s;tle in the ver&s;e following my text, expre&s;&s;ly applies this command to &s;inging the prai&s;e of God, as well as to other religious exerci&s;es; for having enjoined this duty he immediately adds, "And what&s;oever ye do in word or in deed, do all in <HI>the name</HI> of the Lord Je&s;us, giving thanks unto God and the Father by him."</P>
<P>Second. We are to enquire into the <HI>&s;ubject matter</HI> of the prai&s;e we offer to God. This, indeed, is &s;o va|rious and manifold, that a particular detail of it, is not to be expected. In the general we may ob&s;erve, that as God alone is the <HI>object</HI> of all religious adoration and prai&s;e, the <HI>matter</HI> thereof &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of tho&s;e things which have re&s;pect to HIM, either con&s;idered in him&s;elf, or in his di&s;pen&s;ations to our&s;elves or to others. But as God hath made various di&s;coveries of him&s;elf to fallen man, with gradually encrea&s;ing light and fullne&s;s, <HI>the matter</HI> of our prai&s;e &s;hould be con|formable to the clearne&s;s and fullne&s;s of the revelati|on which we enjoy. This, indeed, I take to be &s;elf-evi|dent&mdash;Hence many things become the <HI>matter</HI> of the chri&s;tians prai&s;e, which were not, and indeed could not be a &s;ubject to the faints under former di&s;pen&s;ations, becau&s;e they were not revealed. As an example of this, take the hymn which the apo&s;tle John addre&s;&s;ed to the Saviour, "Unto him that loved us, and wa&s;hed as from our &s;ins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and prie&s;ts unto God and his Father, unto him be glory and dominion forever and ever.

Here the Apo&s;tle calls the Go&s;pel, in gene|ral, a my&s;tery, hidden till that time; and that tho&s;e things which eye had not &s;een, ear heard, and of which it had not &s;o much as entered the heart of man to con|ceive, before that time, were then revealed to the Apo&s;|tles by the Spirit, and by them declared plainly to men, that they might know the things which were freely given them of God. In like manner he declares (2 Tim. 1, 10.) that it is by the Go&s;pel life and immortality are brought to light. And to mention no more, Chri&s;t, after having promi&s;ed to &s;end the Comforter, tells his Di&s;ciples, (John 16, 12, 13, 14,) that when he &s;hould come, he would lead them into all truth&mdash;and &s;hew them the things of Chri&s;t. But if all nece&s;&s;ary truth, and the things of Chri&s;t had been revealed before, this extraordinary di&s;pen&s;ation of the Spirit to the Apo&s;tles would have been a very u&s;ele&s;s thing.</NOTE> And all the&s;e are proper <HI>matter</HI> for chri&s;tian prai&s;e according to the &s;tate of the church &mdash;of families&mdash;and of individual per&s;ons from time to time.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="046389_0016_1021575DE2E85EF0">
Thirdly. The <HI>end</HI> we &s;hould have in view, in &s;inging the prai&s;es of God, is two-fold, viz, re&s;pect|ing God, and re&s;pecting our&s;elves&mdash;As it re&s;pects God, (which is the primary end) we &s;hould have in view to extol and honor him&mdash;to &s;hew forth his glory in the mo&s;t exalted &s;trains&mdash;to magnify his great name, which de&s;erves to be exalted above heaven &amp; earth&mdash;to ac|knowledge and declare his &s;upreme perfection, his ab|&s;olute dominion, his univer&s;al agency; and particular|ly, to celebrate his matchle&s;s wi&s;dom, love and grace in the decree of man's &s;alvation.</P>
<P>As it re&s;pects our&s;elves, the de&s;ign is, to elevate our affections&mdash;enliven our graces&mdash;expre&s;s and promote our &s;piritual joy&mdash;and to compo&s;e the di&s;tractions of a troubled &s;pirit. To this, the exerci&s;e has a native ten|dency; e&s;pecially when in concert, we have the plea|&s;ure of <HI>harmony,</HI> and the enlivening &s;ound of many voices united. It is natural, too, when the heart is full of joy, to give it vent this way, and accordingly the Apo&s;tle exhorts, "Is any merry let him &s;ing p&s;alms<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">James 5, 16.</NOTE>. Moreover, the Apo&s;tle, in my text, men|tions another end with regard to our&s;elves and others, viz. <HI>in&s;truction,</HI> "teaching and admoni&s;hing one ano|ther, &s;ays he, in p&s;alms, and hymns, and &s;piritual &s;ongs." To this purpo&s;e al&s;o, the ordinance is natu|rally &s;uited. Moral &amp; religious truths, and indeed, any matter whatever, thrown into plain &amp; agreeable ver&s;e, generally makes a more la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion on the me|mory, than pro&s;e compo&s;itions; and when they are frequently repeated, or &s;ung, the effect will be pro|portionally more la&s;ting and &s;trong.</P>
<P>Fourthly. I &s;hall now proceed to lay down &s;ome principles for the regulation of our conduct in this important part of wor&s;hip. And</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. All chri&s;tians &s;hould endeavour to attain
<PB N="19" REF="046389_0017_10215761052D4588">as much &s;kill in church mu&s;ic, as their capacity, their opportanities, and other duties will admit. It would &s;urely be mon&s;trous confu&s;ion, if every one, in a wor|&s;hipping a&s;&s;embly were to &s;ing an air different from all the re&s;t; &amp; as mankind are not taught by nature to &s;ing, all, any one air, it is therefore nece&s;&s;ary, that they who &s;ing together, &s;hould previou&s;ly qualify them&s;elves for it by learning. It is al&s;o as evident, that if we are to &s;ing at all, the more we are &s;killed in the art, the bet|ter, &s;hall we be qualified, othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ings being equal, to perform the duty. Inattention to this principle, has almo&s;t ruined our p&s;almody; it has rendered that part of divine wor&s;hip, which, in its own nature, is the mo&s;t exalted and plea&s;urable, in fact, the mo&s;t dull and unedyfying. Many per&s;ons, and &s;ome of them, per|haps, truly religious, either through mi&s;take and pre|judice, or lazine&s;s and indolence, per&s;uade them&s;elves that if the heart be devout, it is no matter what the found of the voice is. But &s;urely David was of a very different opinion when he exhorted thus, "&s;ing unto him a new &s;ong, play &s;kilfully with a loud noi&s;e"<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 33.3.</NOTE>.&mdash; There is certainly as much propriety in making any &s;ort of founds with an in&s;trument, when that is u&s;ed in divine wor&s;hip, as in making any &s;ort of &s;ounds with the voice, when we &s;ing his prai&s;e: and the &s;ame rea|&s;ons which plead for &s;kilfullne&s;s in the one ca&s;e, will al&s;o plead for it in the other. We have ob&s;erved, that &s;inging was de&s;igned to aid and promote, as well as to expre&s;s the feelings of the heart: con&s;equently, the more exqui&s;ite the mu&s;ic is, the more powerful, to this purpo&s;e, will its influence be. To be convinced of this, you need only con&s;ult your own frame, as it is the workman&s;hip of God. The author of our being has con&s;titued us &s;o, that we naturally and indeed, ne|ce&s;&s;arily perceive and reli&s;h harmony in &s;ounds, and
<PB N="20" REF="046389_0018_102157628F8EA2B0">are offended with di&s;cords, ju&s;t as we ta&s;te &s;weetne&s;s in honey, bitterne&s;s in gall&mdash;&s;mell an agreeable odour from the ro&s;e: an offen&s;ive one, from a putrid carca&s;e. If you give this con&s;ideration its proper weight, I pre|&s;ume, it will per&s;uade you, that we &s;hould cultivate church mu&s;ic to &s;uch a degree, as to carry it on in <HI>con|cert,</HI> that is to &s;ay, in different parts and various &s;ounds &s;o &s;et together as to produce <HI>harmony.</HI> This is the perfection of mu&s;ic&mdash;and the capacity to perform it, and the ta&s;te to reli&s;h it when performed, is peculiar to man. The creator hath given to &s;ome other animals a power to &s;ing; but none of them di&s;cover any capa|city for <HI>harmony:</HI> never has any choir of them been heard to perform any thing like it. In this, man &s;tands as <HI>really</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed from the lower creation, as in the power of &s;peech, or any other faculty.&mdash;I a&s;k now, &s;hall this plea&s;ing, this di&s;tingui&s;hing capacity never be called forth to exerci&s;e? Is this part of the divine workman&s;hip u&s;ele&s;s and vain? It not, where and when &s;hall it be employed? Shall it be only in folly and vanity, or mere amu&s;ement? Or rather, &s;hould it not be con&s;ecrated to the &s;ervice of that Be|ing who&s;e workman&s;hip it is? I will venture to leave it with every one candidly to decide.</P>
<P>Let us, therefore, cultivate church mu&s;ic our&s;elves, and promote the cultivation of it in our children. The earlier in life any one begins, the greater progre&s;s he will make; and hence, tho&s;e &s;ocieties are certainly to be commended, who make it a part of &s;chool education, and have their children trained to &s;ing, at the &s;ame time they are taught to read; nor do I expect to &s;ee this art flouri&s;h as it ought, until this practice becomes general. In the mean time, the u&s;ual mode of &s;chools for grown per&s;ons &s;hould be kept up, under proper regulations, and capable teachers.</P>
<P>Secondly. It is the duty of <HI>all</HI> to &s;ing the
<PB N="21" REF="046389_0019_10215764E2CA6710">prai&s;es of God. This is evident, both from rea&s;on and &s;cripture. The Supreme Maje&s;ty of Heaven and Earth is infinitely worthy to be prai&s;ed by every rati|onal creature; and no per&s;on on earth can be in &s;uch a &s;ituation, or &s;tand in &s;uch a relation to his Maker, as not to be under obligations to prai&s;e him. Even under the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation, although particular choice of &s;inging men and &s;inging women were appointed, yet David him&s;elf calls upon <HI>all,</HI> without exception, to prai&s;e, "Let the people prai&s;e thee, O God, let <HI>all</HI> the people prai&s;e thee."<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> Under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, the duty is &s;till farther inculcated, in terms which equally apply to <HI>all,</HI> as in my text, and in the epi&s;tle to the Ephe&s;ians already quoted. It is therefore wick|edne&s;s to neglect a duty &s;o exalted; &s;o plea&s;ing, and to which we are under &s;o many endearing obligations.&mdash; And it is certainly &s;hameful, for a profe&s;&s;or of chri&s;ti|anity to be &s;ilent, when others are &s;inging the prai&s;es of God around him; as if he had no more concern in this &s;ublime act of wor&s;hip, than to amu&s;e him&s;elf.&mdash; Such conduct betrays a heart very in&s;en&s;ible of the divine goodne&s;s, if not totally de&s;titute of real piety. The &s;pirit of true religion breathes thus, "It is good to give thanks unto the Lord, and to &s;ing prai&s;es unto thy name, O Mo&s;t High."<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 92, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> If we have ta&s;ted that the Lord is gracious, we will delight to &s;ing his prai&s;e, and think that we have &s;u&s;tained a lo&s;s, both as to profit and plea&s;ure, if at any time we have been ab&s;ent, when his part of divine wor&s;hip has been performed, whe|ther in the family or church.</P>
<P>Thirdly. We ought to &s;ing in a <HI>continued air:</HI> and not interrupt the mu&s;ic by parcelling out the p&s;alm or hymn, or &s;piritual &s;ong, line by line. This is real|ly &s;o unnatural a mode, that I am per&s;uaded nothing but dire nece&s;&s;ity could have &s;ugge&s;ted, or introduced
<PB N="22" REF="046389_0020_10215768E6EEE370"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t into the church. In the middle denturies of the chri&s;tian aera, learning was almo&s;t entirely bani&s;hed from Europe: &s;carcely a trace of it was to be found but in the mona&s;teries, and among the clergy. When after this learning began to revive, &s;o rare a thing was it to find, <HI>among the common ranks of men,</HI> a per&s;on who could read, and &s;o highly was it e&s;teemed, that, although one had been convicted of a capital crime, yet if he could read, he was acquitted&mdash;his council urged in his behalf, this plea, "legit ut clericus," <HI>he reads as a clergyman,</HI> and if, upon trial, it was &s;ound true, the court ab&s;olved him from puni&s;hment. In this &s;ituation matters were when the reformation took place, and for a con&s;iderable time after; &s;o that the officers of the church were obliged to have recour&s;e to this expedient, viz. to appoint a clerk, who could read, to parcel out the p&s;alm, line by line, to the illi|terate congregation, in order that all might join in this important part of divine wor&s;hip. But behold the force of cu&s;tom, and its prevalence even over rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e. We adhere to this mode &s;till, al|though the nece&s;&s;ity which introduced it, and which alone could ju&s;tify it, is long &s;ince cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Many evils attend this mode of &s;inging&mdash;It con|&s;umes time unnece&s;&s;arily&mdash;prevents the plea&s;ure and advantage of &s;inging a larger portion of a p&s;alm than that, to which, in this way, we are obliged to con&s;ine cur&s;elves&mdash;it, in a great mea&s;ure, de&s;troys the mu&s;ic, and con&s;equently, mars the effect it is de&s;igned to have on the heart, and unle&s;s we have the compo&s;ition by memory, it leaves us often to &s;ing without know|ing what, until the next line comes out to given us the &s;en&s;e&mdash;It is &s;urely high time for us to lay a&s;ide this childi&s;h mode of prai&s;ing God&mdash;Let each one, or at mo&s;t, every two or three, bring a p&s;alm book to the wor&s;hip of God, that &s;o, having the &s;ubject before
<PB N="23" REF="046389_0021_1021576B5ADEAD68">our eyes, we may &s;ing without interruption, and drop that unnatural mixture of reading and &s;inging which now mars and di&s;graces our p&s;almody.</P>
<P>Fourthly. We, who&s;e great advantage it is to live under the Go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, ought not to <HI>con|fine</HI> our&s;elves to that &s;y&s;tem of p&s;almody which was framed for, and exactly &s;uited to that di&s;pen&s;ation of divine grace under which the Jews were placed, and which was, <HI>comparatively,</HI> ob&s;cure and imperfect.</P>
<P>This principle I &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h by the text it&s;elf&mdash;by nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence from other parts of &s;cripture&mdash; and by the difference of the two di&s;pen&s;ations from each other.</P>
<P>The language of my text is very &s;trong to this pur|po&s;e. The Apo&s;tle enjoins it upon chri&s;tians, that they be richly furni&s;hed, or exten&s;ively acquainted with the <HI>word of Chri&s;t</HI>&mdash;tho&s;e important di&s;coveries which the Go&s;pel makes; and that this rich furniture of Go&s;pel knowledge &s;hould not be, in them, a u&s;ele&s;s trea&s;ure, as a &s;pring &s;hut up or fountain &s;ealed, but that it &s;hould be communicated, and flow out for the in&s;truction and edification of one another; and particularly, that it &s;hould be thus employed in their &s;ongs of prai&s;e and other poetical compo&s;itions. Now, my brethern I with you to con&s;ider, how it is po&s;&s;ible to practice this injunction, while we <HI>confine</HI> our&s;elves to the Jewi&s;h p&s;almody. Were you to undertake to in&s;truct any per&s;on in the way of &s;alvation for peri&s;hing &s;inners, which God hath appointed: and would lead him to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> acquaintance with tho&s;e things which pertain to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">fe and godline&s;s&mdash;to faith and the practice of a chri&s;|tian: would you take <HI>this</HI> &s;y&s;tem of p&s;almody for your rule; or would you u&s;e the New Te&s;tament for that purpo&s;e; and that whether the in&s;truction was to be delivered in poetical, or pro&s;e compo&s;ition? Indeed, we not only grant, we maintain in the fulle&s;t manner
<PB N="24" REF="046389_0022_1021576DCB5467E8">that there are many prophe&s;ies of, and references to the Saviour, in the book of p&s;alms; but at the &s;ame time we mu&s;t al&s;o maintain, that, in&s;tead of learning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Go&s;pel by the&s;e, it is by the light of the Go&s;pel we un|der&s;tand them, and learn how to apply them. Let us &s;uppo&s;e a per&s;on, who knew not what religion we profe&s;&s;ed, were to come into our wor&s;hipping a&s;&s;em|blies, week after week, yea, year after year, and hear our &s;ongs of prai&s;e:&mdash;would he, by them, learn the word of Chri&s;t? Would he, at lea&s;t, conclude, that that <HI>word</HI> dwelt in us richly? Or rather, would he not, from this part of our religious &s;ervice, form the &s;ame opinion of us, that he would of an a&s;&s;embly of wor&s;hiping Jews? From our &s;ermons and our pray|ers, indeed, he might learn our profe&s;&s;ion, and the <HI>word of Chri&s;t;</HI> but the Apo&s;tle enjoins, that we &s;hould teach this particularly in our prai&s;es. I there|fore a&s;k again, how can we teach one another the glo|rious di&s;coveries of the Go&s;pel, or evidence that it dwells in us richly, by our &s;ongs and prai&s;e, when yet the&s;e &s;ongs contain not the&s;e di&s;coveries, but mu&s;t them&s;elves, be under&s;tood by a previous knowledge of the word of Chri&s;t: and when yet the &s;ubject matter of our p&s;alms, and our mode of expre&s;&s;ing it, is pre|ci&s;ely the &s;ame as theirs, who reject the Go&s;pel alto|gether? The principle may al&s;o be &s;upported by <HI>ne|ce&s;&s;ary con&s;equence</HI> from other parts of &s;cripture. To this purpo&s;e, let me lead your attention, particularly, to the fourteenth chapter of Paul's fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the Corinthians. The profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of the apo&s;tle, in this chapter, is to regulate the Corinthian church in the exerci&s;e of their <HI>&s;piritual gifts.</HI> Among the&s;e he mentions the gift of <HI>dictating a p&s;alm</HI> to be &s;ung in public wor&s;hip (compare ver&s;es 15, and 26.) Now, if chri&s;tians &s;hould &s;ing no compo&s;itions in the wor|&s;hip of God, but tho&s;e contained in the Book of

But it is as evident as words can well declare, that there was in the fir&s;t age of chri&s;tianity, &s;uch a <HI>gift,</HI> and various chri&s;tians were divinely in&s;pired to utter a p&s;alm in the public a&s;&s;em|bly; from which it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that the chri&s;|tian church was not <HI>confined</HI> to the Jewi&s;h &s;y&s;tem of p&s;almody in the apo&s;tles days; and if it was not <HI>then,</HI> I would wi&s;h to know by what authority it is confined to that &s;y&s;tem <HI>now.</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">I have &s;carcely ever met with a more gro&s;s and pal|pable perver&s;ion of the &s;cripture, than that which repre&s;ents the apo&s;tle, in the above cited chapter, as condemning and correcting the Corinthians for introducing new p&s;alms at all into divine wor&s;hip. The pa&s;&s;age particularly cho&s;en to &s;upport this mi&s;erable interpretation, is the 26th ver&s;e, where the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "How is it, brethren? When ye come together, every one of you hath a p&s;alm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation." The judicious reader will immediately &s;ee, that if the apo|&s;tle meant to reprove the Corinthians for practi&s;ing any the of the&s;e things, he reproves them for the whole; for they are all mentioned together in the &s;ame point of view: and where, then, will the cen&s;ure ultimatels fall?

The pre|ceding and &s;ub&s;equent parts of the chapter &s;hew, that it was the abu&s;e of them&mdash;the di&s;orderly mode of exerci&s;ing them, which prevailed in the Corinthian church, that he here &s;ets him&s;elf to correct&mdash;and the di&s;order was plainly this&mdash; Whil&s;t one was delivering a p&s;alm to be &s;ung in the public a&s;&s;embly, with which he had been in&s;pired, another ro&s;e up and delivered a doctrine which had, in the &s;ame manner, been dictated to him,&mdash;a third, perhaps, would &s;peak in an unknown tongue,&mdash;a fourth, relate a revelation with which he had been favoured, and &s;o on. Hence, two or three, perhaps four or five per&s;ons would be &s;peaking at the &s;ame in&s;tant of time, which not only produced con&s;u&s;ion, but prevented all edification. Therefore the Apo&s;tle di|rects, that they &s;hould exerci&s;e the&s;e gifts, and deliver the things with which they were re&s;pectively cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ged, whe|ther p&s;alm, doctrine, tongue, revelation, &amp;c. in turn, or, as he expre&s;&s;es it, by cour&s;e (compare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er&s;es 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33):&mdash;ob&s;erving that they might all have an op|portunity, in this orderly manner, one after another, of delivering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">natever they were favoured with; and that they were not under any nece&s;&s;ity of breaking through the rules of the &s;tricte&s;t regularity, for &s;ays he, "The &s;pirits of the prophets, are &s;ubject to the prophets," that is to &s;ay, the in&s;piration of the Holy Spirit is not a blind and wild impul&s;e, which &s;orces a per&s;on to utter whatever is communicated to him, at the moment he receives it; on the contrary, it leaves him ma&s;ter of him&s;elf, &s;o as that he can wait the proper time of di&s;covering it. Upon the whole, this pa&s;&s;age of &s;acred writ e&s;tabli&s;hes, beyond all contradiction, that, under the admini&s;tration of the Apo&s;tles, and by the immediate in&s;piration of the Holy Spirit, the Church of Chri&s;t was directed to u&s;e other p&s;alms than tho&s;e of David, in Divine wor&s;hip.

Once more, this principle may be e&s;tabli&s;hed by the con&s;ideration of the <HI>difference</HI> of the two di&s;pen&s;ations (the Jewi&s;h and the Chri&s;tian) from each other.

<P>Fir&s;t. It is &s;aid, that if we do not &s;ing all the p&s;alms of David, or introduce any others into the wor&s;hip of God, we &s;hall weaken the authority of that &s;acred book, and aid the cau&s;e of dei&s;m.</P>
<P>Is it &s;o then, my brethren, that we weaken the au|thority of all that &s;cripture which we do not practice as it was once done?

And yet, after all, I pre&s;ume, the objectors them&s;elves would deem it an abomination to practice &s;ome, at lea&s;t, of the&s;e things now.

Is the authority of the&s;e weakened becau&s;e neither Jews nor chri&s;tians &s;ing them now? I pre&s;ume, not, This is the very objection in effect, which was bro't by the Jews and judaizing teachers again&s;t the Apo&s;|tles of Chri&s;t, when they taught that the Jewi&s;h ritual of wor&s;hip and all their ceremonial ordinances were aboli&s;hed. But, I think, there is no chri&s;tian now, who believes they were guilty of the charge.

Nay, my brethren, we

But we de&s;ire to regard and u&s;e it according to its true end and de&s;ign; not confounding and mixing together tho&s;e things which God has &s;eparated&mdash;not blending Ju|dai&s;m with chri&s;tianity; but by giving every thing its proper place, both as to faith and practice, according as it re&s;pects the di&s;pen&s;ations that have cea&s;ed, or as it regards that <HI>la&s;t and be&s;t,</HI> under which we live, and which alone declares the wor&s;hip and ordinances which the King and head of the Church hath appointed for his followers, now<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The above objection, in &s;ub&s;tance, has been advanced in another form, thus, "Whatever is &s;it to be read, is fit to be &s;ung; if therefore we may not &s;ing all the p&s;alms of David, neither mu&s;t we read them, and thus we &s;hall reject them en|tirely." Nothing can be more weak and ab&s;urd than this cavil. Reading and &s;inging are quite dictinct ordinances in their nature, and often in their object and end. Singing in prai&s;e of God, is, in its nature a direct and immediate act of re|ligious wor&s;hip and adoration; reading is not &s;o.&mdash;In &s;inging prai&s;es, God is the immediate object, and the primary end, is to celebrate his &s;upreme glory and perfection, in him|&s;elf and in his works and ways; in reading, the primary end is in&s;truction and edification. Singing is a natural, and an appointed mean of expre&s;&s;ing our &s;piritual joy; read|ing is not &s;o; and hence, when one is in this frame, the Apo&s;tle does not enjoin it upon him to read, but to &s;ing p&s;alms (Jam. 5.13). From this, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that many things may be &s;it matter for reading, which would be very improper to be &s;ung in prai&s;e to God. I &s;hall il|lu&s;trate this by an example&mdash;It is undoubtedly proper to read every part of &s;cripture; but &s;uppo&s;e a per&s;on were to take the fir&s;t chapter of the fir&s;t book of Chronicles, for in&s;tance, and &s;ing, as an act of religious wor&s;hip and prai&s;e to God, the genealogical line of de&s;cent from Adam to Noah, from thence to Abraham,&mdash;then trace the line through I&s;hmael a little,&mdash;then turn to E&s;au, trace the line through him a while, and conclude with a li&s;t of the Kings and Dukes of Edom. Or, &s;uppo&s;e he were to take the &s;econd chapter of the book of Ezra, and &s;ing in like manner, the numbers of the&s;e who returned with Zerubbabel from the Babyloni&s;h captivity&mdash;together with the names of the towns and di&s;tricts to which they re&s;|pectively belonged, and the number of the hor&s;es, camels, a&s;&s;es, and knives<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">This particular is in chapter 1, 9.</NOTE> which they brought with them to Jeru|&s;alem&mdash;What would you think of the exerci&s;e? Or what opinion would you conceive of the performer? You would &s;urely conclude, that he was dive&s;ted of rea&s;on, or that he intended to turn the duty of &s;inging the prai&s;es of God, into ridicule.</NOTE></P>
<P>Second. It is objected, that the plan I have pled for, is &s;ub&s;tituting human compo&s;ures in the room of
<PB N="36" REF="046389_0034_1021578D83B6D9F8">Divine in&s;piration, and will be attended with many dangerous con&s;equences.</P>
<P>This objection ari&s;es from an entire mi&s;take of the point. There is an e&s;&s;ential difference between the <HI>matter</HI> and the <HI>form</HI> of every &s;ubject. Hence, the &s;ubject matter of a p&s;alm may be divine, i. e. by di|vine in&s;piration: and the form of it, merely human:&mdash; and this is actually the ca&s;e in that &s;y&s;tem and ver&s;ion of p&s;alms, which the objectors them&s;elves contend for. By the <HI>form</HI> of a p&s;alm, I mean the phra&s;es cho&s;en to expre&s;s the &s;en&s;e&mdash;the manner and order of arranging the words and &s;entences&mdash;and the mea&s;ure of the ver&s;e. Now, &s;uppo&s;ing that God had dictated to David, A&s;aph, and others, <HI>all this,</HI> as well as the ideas or &s;ubject matter of the p&s;alms, yet this would only be the ca&s;e in the original language in which the reve|lation was made: &s;o &s;oon as ever they were tran&s;lated, the <HI>form</HI> was changed, and became human. This is
<PB N="37" REF="046389_0035_1021578FE4D2C200">&s;till further evident in the poetical ver&s;ion which we have hitherto u&s;ed; many of the words and phra&s;es are even different from tho&s;e u&s;ed in the pro&s;e tran&s;la|tion, and the form is merely human; unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e Rou&s;e was divinely in&s;pired when he ver&s;ified the p&s;alms, and that the Holy Spirit dictated to him the very phra&s;es and mea&s;ure of his ver&s;e; which, I am &s;ure, no man of &s;ober &s;en&s;e ever believed. It is evi|dent, therefore, to a demon&s;tration, that the form of David's p&s;alms, as they &s;tand in our ver&s;ion, is human, although the &s;ubject matter of them is divine. Now, this is preci&s;ely the ca&s;e in the p&s;alms, hymns, and &s;pi|ritual &s;ongs formed from &s;uitable parts of &s;cripture in general, and particularly from the New Te&s;tament, as I have mentioned before: the form&mdash;the compo&s;ition, will be human; but the &s;ubject matter, divine. For &s;urely every chri&s;tian believes, that the go&s;pel is from heaven&mdash;that it is given by divine in&s;piration, in as high a &s;en&s;e as the book of p&s;alms, or any other part of &s;cripture. And it is certain, that the &s;ubject matter of it is much more clearly and fully di&s;covered, than the matter of David's p&s;alms; for many of them were prophetic, which is always ob&s;cure; and many of them typical, which it is often difficult to unfold.</P>
<P>As for dangerous con&s;equences there are none at|tending this mode, more than any other, in which im|perfect creatures are concerned. Certainly the &s;en&s;e, the mind of the Holy Spirit in the New Te&s;tament, can be as faithfully pre&s;erved and expre&s;&s;ed in a poe|tical, as in a pro&s;e tran&s;lation or di&s;cour&s;e. And I leave it with every one candidly to judge, whether there is not much more danger of mingling our own fancies, and mi&s;taken notions with the matter of our prai&s;e, when we expound the p&s;alms of David for our&s;elves, or depend upon the expo&s;ition of every preacher;&mdash; than when we have the &s;ubject in &s;o plain a dre&s;s as not
<PB N="38" REF="046389_0036_102157942FBD6F80">to need an expo&s;ition&mdash; when we have it con&s;tantly in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;o that we can lei&s;urely compare it with the unerring &s;tandard&mdash;and when too, it has received the approbation of the &s;upreme judicatory of the church.</P>
<P>Third. It is &s;aid, that Chri&s;t and his di&s;ciples u&s;ed the p&s;almody of the Jewi&s;h church&mdash;And that if he had deemed it unfit for the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, he would have given his church a new &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of this objection has no force, be|cau&s;e Chri&s;t and his di&s;ciples during his abode on earth, were under the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation, to which that p&s;almody was &s;uited. Hence they ob&s;erved the ceremonial law, but this does not oblige us to ob&s;erve it. The point here is not, what was proper under the law, but what is &s;o under the go&s;pel. Be&s;ide, it can never be proved that the Saviour confined him&s;elf to that &s;y&s;tem: and as I have already ob&s;erved, it is more than probable he compo&s;ed an hymn at the ce|lebration of his own &s;upper.</P>
<P>The other part of the objection, viz. that if he had deemed the Jewi&s;h p&s;almody unfit for the chri&s;ti|an di&s;pen&s;ation, he would have given his church a new &s;y&s;tem, I totally deny; and for this plain rea&s;on, becau&s;e it was not <HI>nece&s;&s;ary.</HI> And that it was not nece&s;&s;ary, I hope the following con&s;iderations will &s;a|tisfy you.</P>
<P>The gracious Saviour has provided and left in his word, and by the <HI>ordinary influences</HI> of his Holy Spirit, &s;ufficient furniture of light, gifts, and graces, for all the parts of religious wor&s;hip, without leaving a &s;y&s;|tem or liturgy, in the preci&s;e words of which, we &s;hould either pray, or prai&s;e, or preach. Indeed, in the fir&s;t age of the chri&s;tian church, when as yet the full revelation of all things which pertain to life and godline&s;s was not made, nor the canon of New Te&s;ta|ment &s;cripture collected together; extraordinary aid
<PB N="39" REF="046389_0037_10215795C2155340">was nece&s;&s;ary, and was accordingly afforded in every part of divine wor&s;hip, whether praying, prai&s;ing, or preaching. This is evident from many parts of the New Te&s;tament, particularly from the 12th and 14th chapters of Paul's fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the Corinthians, al|ready referred to. But when the canon of &s;cripture was compleated, with a fullne&s;s and clearne&s;s &s;o great, that he who runs may read and under&s;tand, this extra|ordinary aid cea&s;ed; and even tho&s;e in&s;pired prayers, hymns, and &s;ermons, are not recorded, And can we need a more &s;atisfactory proof, that liturgies compo&s;ed for the&s;e purpo&s;es, are not nece&s;&s;ary <HI>now?</HI> Let not chri&s;tians depreciate their privileges, nor think meanly of their advantages: If you do, you will neither im|prove them wi&s;ely, nor feel that gratitude to your God and Saviour for them, to which you are under &s;o many endearing obligations. I repeat it, therefore, the church now, and individuals, have furniture pro|vided for them, <HI>in the ordinary way,</HI> for all the wor&s;hip they are called re&s;pectively to perform&mdash;a furniture rich, abundant, and overflowing. The Go&s;pel reveals the &s;ubject matter in the fulle&s;t and cleare&s;t manner&mdash; the Holy Spirit, as a &s;pirit of hight, of &s;anctification, and of comfort, is more abundantly communicated, than under former di&s;pen&s;ations&mdash;in&s;omuch, that the weake&s;t <HI>true</HI> chri&s;tian now, has a more compleat knowledge of Gods merciful purpo&s;e and device for the &s;alvation of fallen man&mdash;the method of accom|pri&s;hing it&mdash;and the acceptable way of a &s;inners ap|proach to the Mo&s;t High, than the greate&s;t Old Te&s;ta|ment prophet. Probably, by &s;ome, this will be thought <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">old language<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> yet it is not bolder than I am warranted to u&s;e, both by the Old &amp; New Te&s;tament. To prove this, ob&s;erve the &s;trong language of the pro|phet I&s;aiah, "Moreover the light of the Moon &s;hall be as the light of the &s;un, and the light of the
<PB N="40" REF="046389_0038_102144D1D6CBC120">&s;un &s;hall be &s;even-fold, as the light of &s;even days, in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his peo|ple and healeth the &s;troke of the wound."<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. 30, 26.</NOTE> No|thing can be more evident, from the whole preceding context, than that this refers to go&s;pel times, and is a prophetic de&s;cription of the happy circum&s;tances of the Jews when they &s;hould embrace the go&s;pel; and as <HI>light,</HI> when the term is u&s;ed figuratively, almo&s;t univer&s;ally means <HI>knowledge</HI> and under&s;tanding, the obvious &s;en&s;e of the pa&s;&s;age is, that when they &s;hould be converted to chri&s;tianity, their knowledge would as far exceed what they, under the law, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, as the light of the &s;un exceeds the light of the moon, or as the light of &s;even days or &s;even &s;uns collected, exceeds the light of a &s;ingle one <HI>(b).</HI> Still more &s;trong is the language of Zechariah, "In that day &s;hall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem, and he that is<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">This pa&s;&s;age has been interpreted as if by the moon, was meant the type, and by the &s;un the anti-type&mdash;that both are to be kept in immediate view under the go&s;pel&mdash;and that both will thus be better under&s;tood.&mdash;For, &s;ay the&s;e expo&s;itors, on this plan we &s;hall have the type and the anti-type mutually &s;hining upon and illu&s;trating each other, like the &s;un and the moon. And all this is &s;aid to prove, that we &s;hould u&s;e the typical language and ceremonial references of the book of p&s;alms, in chri&s;tian wor&s;hip. This is, truly, as &s;trange an in|terpretation as one could well imagine. Sure I am, the holy &s;pirit never u&s;ed &s;uch an unnatural figure, as upon the above hypothe&s;is, this would be. For, let me a&s;k, did any per&s;on ever &s;ee it, or is it a truth, that the moon &s;hines upon the &s;un, and adds to his light and &s;plendor? No &s;urely. On the contrary, her faint rays are all borrowed from him&mdash;when he appears in our horizon, &s;he is immediately eclip&s;ed, di&s;appears in the blaze of his refulgent orb, and becomes u&s;ele&s;s to us in point of communicating light&mdash;It is only in his ab&s;ence that &s;he is, or can be beneficial in this re&s;pect. It is ju&s;t &s;o in the other ca&s;e. When the glorious SUN of righteou&s;ne&s;s hath ari&s;en, and is &s;hining upon as with meridian brightne&s;s, types and &s;ha|dows &s;hould &s;lee away&mdash;they may injure, but profit us they can|not&mdash; and like the moon, which, by being interpo&s;ed, hides &s;omething of the &s;un's light, even &s;o the&s;e, &s;o far as they are made the immediate objects of our contemplation, will ob&s;cure our views of the redeemer.</NOTE>

Our Lord &s;poke to his di&s;ciples thus, "For I tell you, that many prophets and Kings have de&s;ired to &s;ee tho&s;e things which ye &s;ee, and have not &s;een them, and to hear tho&s;e things which ye hear, and have not heard them."<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Luke 10, 24.</NOTE> If this was the ca&s;e with regard to his di&s;ci|ples, long before the full di&s;play of go&s;pel light, and when, as yet, they were but babes in chri&s;tian know|ledge; how much more mu&s;t it be &s;o with tho&s;e who enjoy the noon day light of the Go&s;pel.

<P>Fourth. It is objected by &s;ome, that it is &s;o dif|ficult to attain &s;ufficient &s;kill in mu&s;ic, to &s;ing in the manner I have pled for, that the bulk of each congre|gation will be prevented from joining in the public prai&s;e of God&mdash;that part of wor&s;hip, mu&s;t be com|mitted to a &s;elect choir&mdash;and, we will become &s;o fond
<PB N="43" REF="046389_0041_102144D89B399EA8">of the mu&s;ic as to neglect the exerci&s;e of grace in the heart.</P>
<P>My brethern, if any one of the&s;e things <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> attended the mode I have recommended, I would give it up at once. But &s;ure I am, this is not the ca&s;e.&mdash; I well know that mankind are prone to extremes, as well on the one &s;ide, as on the other. This is actually the ca&s;e with us now, and we have &s;unk to one extreme in our mode of performing this duty: for I can &s;carce|ly conceive in what more mi&s;erable manner we could perform it, &s;uppo&s;ing us to &s;ing at all. And mu&s;t we not attempt a reformation and &s;eek to do right, for fear of running into the oppo&s;ite extreme? It is al|ways fallacious to rea&s;on again&s;t the <HI>u&s;e</HI> of any thing, from the <HI>abu&s;e</HI> of it. That &s;ome may pay more atten|tion to the mu&s;ic than to the frame of their heart, I readily grant, but &s;urely the mu&s;ic is not the cau&s;e of this; on the contrary, as I have &s;hewn, it is de&s;igned and calculated to aid and promote the&s;e gracious frames. We may al&s;o err by introducing &s;uch a variety of tunes into public wor&s;hip, &amp; in &s;uch quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that the greate&s;t part of the congregation cannot be acquaint|ed with them. But it is ea&s;y to guard again&s;t this evil &mdash;there is no nece&s;&s;ity for changing our airs every month, nor every year&mdash;Yea, and &s;uppo&s;ing us never to change them, yet this &s;hould not prevent us from &s;inging, with <HI>propriety,</HI> tho&s;e we do u&s;e. And I mu&s;t farther maintain, that to learn to &s;ing thus with pro|priety, neither requires uncommon talents, nor extra|ordinary pains&mdash;It is as ea&s;y, as the mode we u&s;e, pro|vided we adopt the proper method of learning, and the teacher under&s;tands his bu&s;ine&s;s; and in this, I &s;peak from certain knowledge. To &s;ing, as I have mention|ed various parts mu&s;t, indeed, be performed together: but it is not nece&s;&s;ary that tho&s;e who &s;ing one part, &s;hould be able to &s;ing the others&mdash;to that one, if they
<PB N="44" REF="046389_0042_102144DBF39CD078">plea&s;e, they may confine them&s;elves to every tune&mdash;and it is as ea&s;y to learn one part as another. To &s;ome, indeed, this mode will be much ea&s;ier than the pre&s;ent, when all are confined to one part: for as there is a va|riety in the parts &s;uited to different voices, as they are fine or cour&s;e, high or low, there is an opportunity of a choice according to the natural tone of the voice; in con&s;equence of which, the performing of it will be more ea&s;y and plea&s;urable. And now, where is the extraordinary difficulty in all this? There is none.&mdash; Moreover experience and facts prove the practicability of it. I do not recollect that I ever heard a congrega|tion, or even private family of Germans &s;inging the prai&s;es of God, but they &s;ung in concert, and made harmony&mdash;Are we &s;o dull and &s;tupid that we cannot learn to do the &s;ame? I am &s;ure, we are not. But the truth is the prejudice of education, or the want of proper di&s;po&s;ition to the duty lies at the bottom of the objection. Had we that delight in &s;inging the prai&s;es of God, and that de&s;ire to qualify our&s;elves in the be&s;t manner for the performance of the duty, that many of us have in learning, empty, &s;illy &s;ongs, or other as un|profitable things, we would not make mountains of molehills; we would cheerfully devote &s;ome of that time to the acqui&s;ition of the &s;kill, which many trifle away in &s;uch pur&s;uits as will fill them with unutter|able angui&s;h when they are called to render their final account.</P>
<P>And now, to conclude&mdash;Let every one receive, with reverence, the word of exhortation, and con&s;cien|tiou&s;ly apply him&s;elf to carry the apo&s;tle's direction into practice. If you believe the go&s;pel to be divine, you will certainly own, that the trea&s;ures of it are incom|parably &s;uperior to all the trea&s;ures of earth&mdash;that they will enrich and make you happy, when the other will vani&s;h like an empty pageant, or amu&s;ing dream whem
<PB N="45" REF="046389_0043_102157998736B5D0">one awaketh. Let us all exerci&s;e our&s;elves daily in learning more and more of the <HI>word of Chri&s;t,</HI> which is able to make us wi&s;e unto &s;alvation, and to furni&s;h us abundantly, through the influences of the Holy Spi|rit, for every word and work. Particularly, let us u&s;e it for our direction and edification, in &s;inging the prai&s;es of our God and Saviour, as furni&s;hing us with <HI>matter</HI> for the mo&s;t exalted &s;trains the church, on earth, can rai&s;e. Let us be much employed in this delightful exerci&s;e&mdash;let the voice of prai&s;e be heard in our habi|tations, as well as in the church&mdash;and let us not grudge to &s;pend a little time and pains to qualify our&s;elves for &s;inging &s;kilfully, with an harmonious noi&s;e.</P>
<P>Let us be ready to fall in with, and promote every attempt to improve our p&s;almody, in agreeablene&s;s to the <HI>word of Chri&s;t.</HI> If the principles I have laid down be true, certainly our p&s;almody needs improvement. In this &s;entiment I am not &s;ingular. Many pious, and enlightened chri&s;tians have long wi&s;hed for p&s;alms, hymns, and &s;piritual &s;ongs, more in the &s;tyle, the &s;pi|rit, and light of the go&s;pel, than the p&s;alms framed for the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation. At length Dr. Watts aro&s;e, and gave the world an imitation of David's p&s;alms, in the language of the New Te&s;tament; as al&s;o a number of hymns, and &s;piritual &s;ongs, formed on other parts of &s;cripture, e&s;pecially the go&s;pel. His performance was highly e&s;teemed by many; and as much condemned by others; not, &s;o far as I have learn|ed, becau&s;e there was any thing heterodox in it, but becau&s;e the author had advanced, and attempted to bring into practice, the principles I have endeavored to e&s;tabli&s;h. His compo&s;itions, however, were &s;oon u&s;ed, in religious wor&s;hip, public and private, by ma|ny chri&s;tians as well of our own, as of other denomina|tions; altho' the &s;upreme judicatory of our church had not, as yet, given an expre&s;s &s;anction to them. At
<PB N="46" REF="046389_0044_1021579C20A1CE38">length our Synod took up the matter judicially, and ap|pointed a committee to examine the different ver&s;ions of the book of p&s;alms, to which they could have acce&s;s, and from them to &s;elect &s;uch a collection as they &s;hould judge be&s;t; and to lay it before Synod at a future meet|ing, for their con&s;ideration. In pur&s;uance of this ap|pointment, the committee proceeded on the bu&s;ine&s;s, and after a con&s;iderable time, reported to this purpo&s;e, that having compared &s;uch ver&s;ions as they could ob|tain, they did not apprehend any &s;o well calculated for chri&s;tian wor&s;hip, as that of Dr. Watts, as amended by Mr. Barlow, of New-England. The ver&s;ion, thus a|mended, was then laid before Synod for their con&s;idera|tion, who, after mature deliberation, gave it their judi|cial &s;anction, as you may &s;ee in a printed extract from their minutes, bound up with the &s;aid ver&s;ion. The committee had al&s;o added a book of hymns to this ver|&s;ion; but it was laid a&s;ide, not becau&s;e Synod di&s;ap|proved of the thing in it&s;elf, but becau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ome parts of the collection appeared to them exceptionable. Very probably a collection of this kind will yet be added&mdash; and indeed, my brethren, &s;o many are the peculiar and intere&s;ting di&s;coveries of the go&s;pel&mdash;&s;o many the pa&s;&s;ages which contain the mo&s;t fit and excellent <HI>matter</HI> for chri&s;tian prai&s;e, that until we have hymns and &s;pi|ritual &s;ongs formed upon them, I am clearly per&s;uaded, and I tru&s;t, by this time, &s;o are you, our p&s;almody will be <HI>incompleat.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, as we have the opportunity now, of advancing a con&s;iderable &s;tep in the improvement of our p&s;almody, let us chearfully and thankfully embrace it, and walk in the light and liberty wherewith our divine Lord hath made us free, to the honour of his precious name, and our own greater edification. Let us endeavor to dive&s;t our&s;elves of prejudice and pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion&mdash;and give the ver&s;ion a fair and candid exa|mination.
<PB N="47" REF="046389_0045_1021579EA49D0C00">This is &s;urely the lea&s;t that, in rea&s;on and con&s;cience, you can do, whether you view the matter with regard to Synod, or to your&s;elves; for altho' Sy|nod has not pretended to force this ver&s;ion on any congregation or individual, yet, methinks, &s;ome re|&s;pect is due to the judgment of that <HI>body</HI> to which we profe&s;s &s;ubjection in the Lord. And then, remember that you are deeply and per&s;onally intere&s;ted in this matter, as accountable to God. For if, after you have been favored with the cleare&s;t di&s;coveries of the way of a &s;inner's approach to God, and acceptance with him, you are found not walking according to the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> and e&s;pecially, if after being warned and admoni&s;hed, you ob&s;tinately reject, or carele&s;sly neglect the oppor|tunity of improving, you will not be able to an&s;wer for it to your final Judge.</P>
<P>In examining the ver&s;ion now recommended, I hope you will keep in view the things you have now heard. But, above all, &s;eek by earne&s;t prayer, the direction of the Holy Spirit, who&s;e office it is to take of the things of Chri&s;t, and &s;hew them unto us&mdash;that he would lead you in the path of duty&mdash;and teach you, and the whole church on earth, the truth as it is in Je&s;us.</P>
<P>And now unto him that loved us, and wa&s;hed us from our &s;ins in his own blood; and hath made us kings and prie&s;ts unto God and his Father; unto him be glory and dominion forever and ever, Amen. Yea, unto God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, be undi|vided honours and eternal prai&s;es. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
