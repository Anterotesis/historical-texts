<P>Set your Affection on Things above, not on Things on the Earth.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE great Error that all Mankind are prone to, and which indeed ruins the larger Part of the World, is their placing their Happine&s;s in this Earth. The great Realities of ano|ther World, &s;trike their Minds but weakly, and appear at a wide Di&s;tance, and a &s;trange Uncertainty to their unbelieving Hearts. But the Things pre&s;ent, and that are &s;een, the Objects that we conver&s;e with eve|ry Day, make a deep Impre&s;&s;ion upon us. We fancy they are &s;olid, and would fain believe they are la&s;ting; nor do we care to detect their Fal&s;hood and Treachery; their Vanity and Emptine&s;s. We have never been in the other World; and therefore we don't know how to reallize the Exi&s;tence of it: It appears to us a Novelty and a Dream. But the Earth we conver&s;e with every
<PB N="6" REF="004481_0004_100D540D8A9E1038">Day; we live upon it, and it is the con&s;tant Object of all our Sen&s;es. We have been a long Time u&s;ed to it; and the very fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions of our Infancy, have preju|diced us in its Favour. But the news of another World, comes to us by hear-&s;ay; and after we have been fir&s;t at|tached to this Earth, by our Sight and Familiarity. But above all, our Fall from GOD has brought a Cloud upon our Minds as to &s;piritual Matters, and rendered our Appetites after carnal Things raging and impetuous. We all need then the Addre&s;s of the Text, <HI>Set your Af|fection on Things above, not on Things on the Earth.</HI> They are the Words of an <HI>Apo&s;tle;</HI> they are then weighty and &s;olemn: But they are the Words of the HOLY GHOST in the <HI>in&s;pired</HI> Apo&s;tle; they come then armed with divine Authority and Command, with the Power and Name of GOD. They are very plain and ea&s;y to be under&s;tood; and no Subtlety or Artifice can ob&s;cure or elude the Evidence of the &s;acred Law. They are agreeable to the Maxims of eternal Rea&s;on; and they are expre&s;&s;ed in a very forcible and emphatical Manner. To render it beyond all Doubt or He&s;itation, the Phra&s;e runs both Negative and Po&s;itive. <HI>Set your Affection on Things above, not on Things on the Earth.</HI> All the Circum&s;tances tend to demand our mo&s;t awaken|ed Attention, and ready Obedience.</P>
<P>The DOCTRINE of the Words is this.</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>It is the great Duty of Chri&s;tians, to withdraw their Affections from the Things of the Earth, and fix them on the Things of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>In handling this Doctrine, need I go about to prove to you,</P>
<P N="1">1. That <HI>the human Soul has in it many Affections?</HI></P>
<P>This you feel in your &s;elves; and your own Hearts, and your own Experience are beforehand with me.
<PB N="7" REF="004481_0005_100D53F12DD133C8">You are all con&s;cious to the Pa&s;&s;ions and Appetites of your own Minds. You know that you love and hate; de&s;ire and abhor; rejoice and grieve, hope and fear. That you have &s;uch Things as the Lan|guage of Scripture and Philo&s;ophy and common Life, call Affections, is a &s;elf-evident Propo&s;ition, and can need no Proof. To pretend a Demon&s;tration of it, would only be to ob&s;cure it. I &s;hall drop this then, and pur&s;ue another, alas! that it is &s;o plain a Pro|po&s;ition.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Our Affections are naturally &s;et on the Things of Earth.</HI></P>
<P>We need &s;uch a Call as this of my Text, <HI>Set your Affection on Things above, not on Things on the Earth.</HI> The Matter of Fact is plain in our &s;elves, and has been &s;o through all the Generations of Men, that this Earth &s;trangely allures and engro&s;&s;es our Affections. We feel in our Hearts a prevailing. Fondne&s;s to the Things we po&s;&s;e&s;s, and a prevailing De&s;ire to tho&s;e we expect. And we &s;ee the Ca&s;e is the &s;ame with all about us, who are earne&s;t to get and to keep the vain Trea&s;ures of the Earth: And it has been &s;o from the fir&s;t Ages even until now. All the Children of Men are born the Slaves of this World; and its Empire is univer&s;al and continuing, like that of Death. It has reigned o|ver all Men from <HI>Adam</HI> even until now. If the Mat|ter of Fact is &s;o plain then, what are the Rea&s;ons? How comes it to pa&s;s that our Affections are &s;o linked to earthly and mortal Things? Alas, it is ea&s;ily and &s;adly accounted for. Our Fall from GOD has corrupted our Ta&s;te, and blinded our Under&s;tand|ings, and brought us into this deluded and bewildered Condition. <HI>Adam,</HI> our fir&s;t Father, &s;at his Affecti|ons on the Things below; and now the ju&s;t Judg|ment of GOD has left us his Off&s;pring to do &s;o too. He was led away by his Sen&s;es to forget the Things which were above, and di&s;believe and di&s;o|bey
<PB N="8" REF="004481_0006_100D540F14A71048">his GOD. The forbidden Tree allured his <HI>Sight,</HI> and appeared <HI>fair to look upon:</HI> It tempted his <HI>Palate;</HI> and appeared <HI>good for Food:</HI> It excited his <HI>De&s;ire,</HI> and rai&s;ed his <HI>Ambition: A Tree to be de&s;ired to make one wi&s;e:</HI> So he <HI>took the Fruit of it, and did eat.</HI> Gen. iii. 6. Thus were our fir&s;t Parents led away, and ever &s;ince then, the guilty Progeny have been cheated by their Sen&s;es to place their Affection on earthly Things. The holy GOD immediately withdrew the Re&s;traints of his SPIRIT, and gave up the Race to follow the Sen&s;es which they cho&s;e to follow. And now, the Fetters are made &s;trong upon many Accounts.</P>
<P>For In&s;tance, Earthly Things are the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> we conver&s;e with; and as they are beforehand with our Rea&s;on, they in&s;i|nuate them&s;elves into our Affections, before we are aware of their Treachery and Fal&s;hood. The Child learns to gratify his Sen&s;es before he comes to exer|ci&s;e his Rea&s;on; and the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion is the deep|e&s;t, and la&s;ts the longe&s;t. His fir&s;t Acquaintance is with earthly Things; and therefore his Affections are placed upon them, before Rea&s;on can &s;et a Guard upon his Mind.</P>
<P>And as we conver&s;e <HI>fir&s;t</HI> with earthly Things, &s;o we do it <HI>con&s;tantly;</HI> and this is another Rea&s;on why our Affections are fixed upon them. Earthly Things are &s;en&s;ible Things, and familiar to our Eyes every Day: And con&s;tant Familiarity begets Love. 'Tis a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on how we come to prefer the Things of Earth, before Things above: Becau&s;e Things temporal are &s;een, but Things eternal are invi&s;ible. Things un&s;een, are the Objects of our Faith; but the Things of this World, are the Ob|jects of Sight and Sen&s;e. Faith is the Evidence of Things not &s;een; the Sub&s;tance of Things hoped for. But the Things below &s;trike us more immediately; they bribe our Sen&s;es, and captivate our Souls. Hence
<PB N="9" REF="004481_0007_100D53F349B3D748">'tis that we &s;eek the Things which are below, and not the Things which are above. And need the Warning and Exhortation of the Text; <HI>Set your Af|fections on Things above, not on Things on the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>The very Expre&s;&s;ion of the Text in&s;inuates the Ten|dency of our Minds to earthly Things, and the Dif|ficulty to tran&s;fer them to heavenly. 'Tis becau&s;e one is <HI>below,</HI> the other <HI>above.</HI> 'Tis like panting up Hill, or &s;liding gently down. The Things of Hea|ven are <HI>above,</HI> and we ri&s;e to them with Pains and Labour; but the Things on Earth are about us, and beneath us, and we may &s;it &s;till, or &s;ink down and enjoy them. So that in every Light the Propo&s;iti|on appears evident, that our Affections are naturally &s;et on Things below, and not on Things above.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>'Tis our Duty to &s;et our Affection on Things above, and not on Things on the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis our Duty for &s;o has the Command of GOD made it. The Will of GOD is the Rule of our Duty. Whatever he enjoins immediately becomes our Duty. 'Tis enough to enforce our Obedience and Compliance, that GOD has given his Orders, and declared this to be his Will. A Thing may on other Accounts be our Wi&s;dom, and our Inte|re&s;t, our Honour and Safety, but 'tis the Command of GOD alone that can make it our Duty.</P>
<P>And be&s;ure this is the Ca&s;e here: For GOD has commanded it at our Hands, that we &s;et our Affections on the Things above, and not on the Things below. This is the great De&s;ign of the Law of God, to take our Affections off from Earth, and draw them up to Heaven. In the New-Te&s;tament this Matter is more fully explained, and more frequently and more &s;trongly inculcated. Here we are in&s;tructed, I. John ii. 15, 16, 17. <HI>Love not the World, neither the Things that are in the World; if any Man love the World, the Love of the Father is not in him. For</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="004481_0008_100D30B7C5A868F8"><HI>all that is in the World, the Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h, the Lu&s;t of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, is not of the Father, but is of the World. And the World pa&s;&s;|eth away, and the Lu&s;t thereof; but he that doeth the Will of GOD abideth for ever.</HI> 'Tis the Will of GOD then, that we &s;et not our Affections on the Things of the World; and 'tis then our Duty not to do it. Rom. xii. 2. <HI>Be not conformed to this World; but be ye tran&s;formed by the renewing of your Mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and ac|ceptable, and perfect Will of GOD.</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible to obey GOD; to comply with the Will of GOD, without proclaiming War with the World; with|out weaning our Affections and withdrawing our Friend&s;hip from it. James iv. 4. <HI>Know ye not that the Friend&s;hip of the World is enmity with GOD? Who&s;oever therefore will be a Friend of the World is an Enemy of GOD.</HI> Thus the New-Te&s;tament, which has more fully brought Life and Immortality to Light, is, you &s;ee, full of the Matter.</P>
<P>But the Old-Te&s;tament is not without &s;ufficient Indi|cations of this too; and tends to lead our Affections from the Things of Earth to tho&s;e of Heaven. Indeed the Promi&s;es of the Old-Te&s;tament, do for the mo&s;t part refer literally to the Land of <HI>Cana|an:</HI> But they were ultimately regarded by the wi&s;e and good Men of tho&s;e Days, to &s;ignify the Ble&s;|&s;ings of the heavenly World. Hence the believing ancient Patriarchs, all along profe&s;&s;ed that they were but <HI>Strangers and Pilgrims here,</HI> that they <HI>&s;ought a better Country, that is, an heavenly.</HI> They looked upon the earthly <HI>Canaan,</HI> but as a Type of the heavenly; and applied the Promi&s;es in the Letter temporal, to Things &s;piritual and eternal. And this is the Spirit that breathes in the pious Patriarchs till the coming of their ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR, whom they all regarded and lived upon in the Pro&s;pects of Faith. They all believed a future World; a State of Re|compence, and eternal Rewards: And they withdrew their Affections from the Things below, and placed
<PB N="11" REF="004481_0009_100D53F58924E588">them on tho&s;e greater above. Is not this the Lan|guage of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> when he <HI>cho&s;e rather to &s;uffer Af|fliction with the People of GOD, than to enjoy the Plea&s;ures of Sin for a Sea&s;on?</HI> Is not this the Con|&s;olation of <HI>Job,</HI> when <HI>I know</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>that my Re|deemer liveth, and though after may Skin, Worms de&s;troy this Body, yet in my Fle&s;h &s;hall I &s;ee GOD?</HI> Is not this the In&s;inuation of the P&s;almi&s;t, when he &s;peaks of the <HI>Men of this World, who have their Portion</HI> only <HI>in this Life:</HI> And what el&s;e could comfort him when he <HI>walk'd through the Valley of the Shadow of Death,</HI> but that he knew for him <HI>to die would be Gain.</HI> Even <HI>Balaam</HI> him&s;elf, when he came to have his Eyes open, could wi&s;h to <HI>die the Death of the Righteous,</HI> con|vinced that the <HI>Day of his Death was better than the Day of his Birth.</HI> So that upon the whole, all the &s;acred Pages repre&s;ent this ble&s;&s;ed Truth to us, that there is a Reality in the Things above; that GOD therefore calls us to &s;et our Affections on tho&s;e Things, and not on Things on the Earth: And that ac|cordingly this has been the Practice of good Men in all Ages, who have &s;o under&s;tood the Duty and &s;o perform'd it.</P>
<P><HI>Set your Affection on Things above, not on Things on the Earth.</HI> This does not forbid us <HI>having</HI> an Affecti|on for the Things below; but indulging an inordi|nate Affection. We may have an Affection for earthly Things, but we mu&s;t not <HI>&s;et</HI> them, mu&s;t not <HI>&s;ix</HI> them upon the&s;e Things; mu&s;t not &s;et our <HI>Af|fection;</HI> not <HI>all</HI> of them as ONE; not <HI>wholly</HI> upon earthly Things. We may <HI>de&s;ire</HI> worldly Good; but not too vehemently; but it mu&s;t be with profound Submi&s;&s;ion. We may love and be glad of our out|ward Ble&s;&s;ings; but it mu&s;t be a &s;ubordinate Affec|tion, we mu&s;t &s;et loo&s;e by them, and be willing to part with them. We mu&s;t &s;et a much <HI>higher</HI> Value upon the Things <HI>above;</HI> and look upon <HI>them</HI> to be by far better. This is the State of the Ca&s;e: You may <HI>have</HI> an Affection for the good Things in
<PB N="12" REF="004481_0010_100D5413EC5891D0">the World but you mu&s;t no <HI>&s;et</HI> your Affection on the&s;e lower Things, but on Things above.</P>
<P>It were high Ingratitude in us, to have no Re|gard at all for the good Things which a bounte|ous GOD, on this Earth gives us. 'Tis he that be&s;tows on us, our Riches, and our Relatives; our Health, and our Life; and it were Di&s;re&s;pect to the Giver to di&s;reli&s;h the Gifts. So an ab&s;ent Friend &s;ends us Tokens of his Friend&s;hip, by which we &s;hould remember him: As it would be &s;trange that tho&s;e Marks of Affection &s;hould be lov'd in|&s;tead of our Friend to the Prejudice of our Fond|ne&s;s for him, &s;o it would be ba&s;e and ungrateful not to e&s;teem the Tokens and remember our Friend by them. Let us reli&s;h the Creature for GOD's Sake then, and there will be no Danger of an inordinate Affection.</P>
<P>Some have made &s;trange Work with a Pa&s;&s;age in the New-Te&s;tament, where our SAVIOUR tells the young Man in the Go&s;pel, <HI>Sell all thou ha&s;t and give it unto the Poor,</HI> as though this were a Command that reached unto every Chri&s;tian, and a Rule to hold univer&s;ally as a Criterion to try our Love to the World by. 'Tis a Wonder &s;uch Genius's for Expo&s;ition have not commented on that Pa&s;&s;age in the Old-Te&s;tament, where <HI>Abraham</HI> is commanded to &s;acrifice <HI>I&s;aac;</HI> and demon&s;trated that a Man could not be a true Believer who did not de&s;troy his Chil|dren for Burnt-Offerings; for the Ground for both is pretty near the &s;ame. In one Ca&s;e and the other, GOD gave a particular Command to try the Truth of Grace in the Heart of a particular Per&s;on, and all the Difference was, one &s;tood the Trial, as every good Man would, and the other &s;unk under it, as would be the Ca&s;e of every Hypocrite. And had the young Man in the Go&s;pel with the &s;incere unrelucting Heart of <HI>Abraham,</HI> given up his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, no one can &s;ay how far they might have been given back again to him, as <HI>I&s;aac</HI> was to <HI>Abraham,</HI> or
<PB N="13" REF="004481_0011_100D53F7120E5468">as <HI>Job</HI>'s E&s;tate was doubled. However that may be, all we can infer from both the Stories is this, That if GOD does really call for all our outward good Things, a good Man &s;o loves his GOD, that he would make a ready Surrender of them: And not that he is now oblig'd either to &s;lay his Son, or give away all his E&s;tate. It is plain this cannot be the Meaning in the latter Ca&s;e, becau&s;e it is a Duty im|po&s;&s;ible to be perform'd: For how could every Man &s;ell all his E&s;tate and give it to the Poor? Where would be the Poor to receive it! 'Twould indeed &s;erve to level all Mankind, de&s;troy all Order, and break up the Community: As though we &s;hould contrive that the Body natural &s;hould be all Hand, or all Eye: And then where were the Hearing and the Ta&s;te?</P>
<P>And yet, after all, nothing is more certain than this Truth, that the Man who has ever felt what a Work of Grace upon the Soul means, loves his GOD and his SAVIOUR beyond any Creature. And if he does not &s;ell all he has and give it to the Poor, 'tis purely becau&s;e he knows it would not plea&s;e GOD; and if he &s;acrifices not his only Son, 'tis purely becau&s;e GOD requires it not, but forbids it.</P>
<P>But would you know whither this be the real Prin|ciple of your Actions, and not the governing Love of the Idol-Creature, the be&s;t Way of di&s;covering the Matter, will be, not to try your &s;elves in In&s;tances, where, as GOD has not commanded, &s;o has no where promis'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t you: But to examine, do you with|out Reluctance comply where his Commands are plain. 'Twas that young Man's Duty to &s;ell all. He cou'd not do it: 'Tis plain he was not a &s;anctified Man. 'Twas <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Duty to &s;acrifice <HI>I&s;aac:</HI> He &s;et about it immediately: 'Tis plain he was truly faith|ful. Neither of the&s;e are Commands to you. So that if you are not a&s;&s;i&s;ted to do Things which are not your Duty, you have no need of Di&s;courage|ment at the Reluctance. The Rule is, Do you do
<PB N="14" REF="004481_0012_100D5416112A0718">what is your Duty? Do you chearfully give GOD his Dues out of your E&s;tates? Do you give up this Part of your Gains with a peculiar Plea&s;ure, and far from any Regret? If you have the Te&s;timony of your Con&s;ciences here, you may be &s;ure that as your future Days &s;o your Strength &s;hall be. And your whole E&s;tate, or your only Son you &s;hall be enabled to part with, if ever GOD really demands them. GOD will either keep you from the Temp|tation, or make Way for your E&s;cape, &mdash;All our Projections about future Tryals proceed from our vain Confidence as though our Strength was our own. &mdash; Take no Thought for the morrow, but do the Du|ty of the Day, and that is all GOD requires.</P>
<P>Thus I have briefly explain'd and evinc'd the Duty to you; and I come now to improve and apply it.</P>
<P><HI>Be exhorted, my beloved brethren, to &s;et your Affection on Things above, not on Things on the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>CHRIST is above.</HI> Is not this a &s;ufficient Rea|&s;on why you &s;hould place your Affection there. Who is worthy of all your Love but he? The Creatures you are &s;o fond of, were made by him, and derive all that is lovely in them from him. And if from his Fulne&s;s they have all received all their Graces, how &s;uperiour mu&s;t his Fulne&s;s be? Be&s;ure then, if we are apt to &s;et our Affections on Things below, we have infinitely higher Rea&s;on to &s;et them on Things above; for CHRIST is there in his more abundant Glory. And &s;o &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, in the preceeding Context, <HI>Seek tho&s;e Things which are above, where</HI> CHRIST <HI>&s;itteth on the right Hand of GOD.</HI> CHRIST is above; and the right Hand of GOD is above; is not this then a Place worthy your De&s;ire and Choice? <HI>At his right Hand are Plea&s;ures for ever|more.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="15" REF="004481_0013_100D53F9B47C66C0">
2. Set your Affection on Things above, not on Things on the Earth: <HI>For ye are dead, &s;ays</HI> the Context: Ye are dead? What a Shock does it give to our Security in earthly Enjoyments? We &s;et our Affections on Things below: Alas! we mu&s;t pre&s;ently be &s;ummon'd by Death to leave them all. So certain is it that we mu&s;t die away from them, that it may be pronounced, we are already dead. Death <HI>has</HI> pa&s;&s;ed upon all Men, in that all have &s;inned. In the <HI>Day</HI> thou eate&s;t thou &s;halt &s;urely die. It proved true, becau&s;e in that <HI>&s;ame Day</HI> the Sen|tence took Place, and we became liable to Death: Dead in Law. Ye are dead then. 'Tis as certain you mu&s;t be &s;o, as if you were already dead. Set not then your Affection on the Things below. <HI>When GOD requires your Soul, who&s;e &s;hall all the&s;e Things be?</HI></P>
<P>But be&s;ure this is not the principal Intention of the Text, when it &s;ays, <HI>Ye are dead,</HI> therefore &s;et your Affection on the Things above, not on Things on the Earth. Ye are dead: that is, the corrupt Principle in you is dead. The reigning Power of your Lu&s;ts is dead; your inordinate Pa&s;&s;ions and Appetites are mortified and dead. You are dead to this World. By the Cro&s;s of CHRIST the World is crucified unto me, and I unto the World. And now why &s;hould you revive the Dead Affections, and &s;et them on Things below? Having e&s;caped the Pollution of the World through Lu&s;t, why &s;hould you be again taken and entangled therein? Re|member how the World treated your ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR, and let the Cro&s;s of CHRIST crucify the World to you. Let the Remembrance of his Sufferings wean you from the execrable Place.</P>
<P N="3">3. But &s;ays the Text, <HI>Your Life is hid with CHRIST in GOD.</HI> Is CHRIST your Life; the vital Principle of Thought and Action in you? Be&s;ure we &s;hould have our Hearts and Affections where our Life is. Where &s;hould Life be, but it the Heart? the Seat of the Affections? Now
<PB N="16" REF="004481_0014_100D54179CBCCBD8">CHRIST our Life is above, on the Throne, and in the Bo&s;om of GOD. Our Affections &s;hould be there too then: Our Life is hid with CHRIST in GOD. Your Life is hid indeed; but this Way you may di&s;cover it to others, by your Indifference to the Things of this World, and your Ardor to tho&s;e of another. Your Life is <HI>hid;</HI> laid up out of Sight. But O realize it; Look for a future Life. Remember <HI>this is not your Re&s;t,</HI> why then &s;hould &s;hould you terminate your Affection here?</P>
<P N="4">4. Another Motive in the Context, is, <HI>If ye then be ri&s;en with CHRIST, &s;et your Affection on Things above, not on Things on the Earth.</HI> If we were al|ways to live among &s;uch Objects and Enjoyments, it were more excu&s;able &s;hould they &s;eize our Affecti|ons; but when we expect &s;o different a Re&s;urrecti|on-State, what Madne&s;s is it, to circum&s;cribe our Acquaintance in &s;uch narrow Limits? We are made for the Re&s;urrection-World, widely different from the pre&s;ent Scene of Things; why then &s;hould we learn to love tho&s;e &s;hort-liv'd Objects, and neglect the future and eternal ones? CHRIST is ri&s;en: No Truth is more capable of Proof than this. And we are ri&s;en with CHRIST, we &s;hall as &s;urely ri&s;e, as if we were already ri&s;en. <HI>For if the Dead ri&s;e not, then is not CHRIST rai&s;ed.</HI> &mdash; we are ri&s;en in Type, in Earne&s;t and Pledge. 'Tis Folly then, 'tis the great|e&s;t Folly, to &s;et our Affections on the World of Death, when we are made for the quite different Re&s;urrection-World. Nay, but further, <HI>Ye are ri&s;en with CHRIST:</HI> It &s;ignifies a &s;piritual Re&s;urrection. A Re&s;urrection from a Death in Sin, and a Re&s;to|ration to the Life of Holine&s;s. Here now is the Ar|gument, <HI>If ye then be ri&s;en with CHRIST, &s;et your Affection on Things above, not on Things on the Earth.</HI> If you have experienced this ble&s;&s;ed Re&s;urrection with CHRIST; if you have been renewed, and brought into the Life of GOD, Oh feed the divine Life, and cheri&s;h it; by no Means &s;tifle it by an inor|dinate
<PB N="17" REF="004481_0015_100D53FBD93293A8">Affection to the gro&s;&s;er Things below. This Principle of Life in you, like a Flame, tends <HI>up|wards:</HI> You &s;mother it when you &s;et your Affecti|on on the Things below. 'Tis wor&s;e in you to do &s;o than for others: For the natural Man cannot di&s;cern to do at all otherwi&s;e. It is better not to have known and felt the Power of the Truth, than after that to di&s;obey it, and love the Things contrary to it.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another Motive in the Context is, <HI>when</HI> CHRIST <HI>who is our Life &s;hall appear, then &s;hall ye al&s;o appear with him in Glory; mortify therefore your Members, which are upon the Earth. Set your Affection on Things above, not on Things on the Earth.</HI> The &s;econd Ap|pearance of CHRIST, and the Rewards which he will then be&s;tow on his Faithful, are a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on why we &s;hould &s;et our Affections and Expectations on Things future and above. CHRIST will appear the &s;econd Time: Behold he comes, and his Reward is with him. He will give the Crown of Righteou&s;ne&s;s in that Day. Wherefore, <HI>forgetting the Things which are behind,</HI> and calling our Affections back from them, <HI>let us reach forth to tho&s;e Things which are before, and pre&s;s towards the Mark for</HI> this <HI>Prize.</HI> The <HI>Account</HI> we are to give <HI>to</HI> CHRIST our Judge, this methinks is a mo&s;t awakening Motive to &s;et loo&s;e by the Things of this World, and &s;et our Affection on the Things above. The <HI>Glory</HI> that we &s;hall receive <HI>from</HI> CHRIST our Judge, this methinks &s;hould rai&s;e our Expectati|ons, and attract our De&s;ires and fix our Affections; for when CHRIST who is our Life, &s;hall appear, then &s;hall ye al&s;o appear with him in Glory. My Brethren, are we not ambitious of this Honour? Do we not long for this Glory? Is it not enough to call up and fire all our Affections? Are the Things below worthy to be Rivals here? Are they, think you, worthy to be compared with the Glory which &s;hall be revealed? Think on the Appearance of CHRIST; on the Glory of CHRIST; and that you &s;hall appear with him in Glory; and &s;ee if this has not a pre|vailing
<PB N="18" REF="004481_0016_100D5419473E2040">Charm to draw your Affection from the Things below, and &s;et them on Things above. If this will not do, con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>The Wrath of GOD cometh on the Children of Di&s;obedience.</HI> So &s;ays the Context very emphatically: Ver. 6. If your Affections are let loo&s;e upon the Things below, they will lead you on to all exce&s;s of Uncleanne&s;s, for which Things &s;ake the Wrath of GOD cometh on the Children of Di&s;obedience. And is not here fair Warning again&s;t inordinate Affection? The Wrath of GOD, is it, do you &s;uppo&s;e, a light Matter? Can you ea&s;ily bear it? Dare you confront it with an intreped Air? Can you re&s;i&s;t, or can you e&s;cape? Nay, be not deceived, GOD is not mocked: It is indeed a fear|ful Thing to fall into the Hands of the living GOD. Can thy Heart endure, or can thy Hands be &s;trong in the Day when he &s;hall ri&s;e up in his Vengeance and Flame! And this will be the amazing Danger, and this the &s;wift De&s;truction that &s;hall pour upon the Head of tho&s;e, who &s;eek earthly Things and neglect heavenly. The Things on the Earth are dying Creatures; and tho&s;e who &s;et their Affection on them, go down to the Dead: What wonder then, that they &s;hould be gathered with the Congregation of the dead? GOD commands you to &s;et your Affection on Things above, and not on Things on the Earth; You di&s;obey GOD, and you &s;et up Creatures in the Throne of GOD, when you let your Love loo&s;e be|low Him. And will not this ju&s;tly provoke GOD? For this Cau&s;e the Wrath of GOD cometh on the Children of Di&s;obedience.&mdash;Thus far I have confin'd my &s;elf only to the Motives of the Apo&s;tle in the Context.</P>
<P N="7">7. And to conclude, Set your Affection on Things above, not on Things on the Earth: <HI>For the Things on Earth are temporal, but the Things above are eternal.</HI> This is the great and fini&s;hing Stroke of all: And though this Motive is not expre&s;&s;ed in the Context,
<PB N="19" REF="004481_0017_100D53FDEE5B4F40">yet it is implied in it, and urged in innumerable other Places. The Things in this World are fading, tran|&s;itory and peri&s;hing. Why &s;hould we &s;et our Eyes then, upon that which is not; or pre&s;ently will not be. Look upon the Things you are &s;o fond of, in this Light, and &s;ee how worthle&s;s they are of your warm Affection. You have an Affection to <HI>Wealth</HI> and <HI>Plenty;</HI> you look with Joy upon your large Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, and let your Wi&s;hes loo&s;e for more. Alas, <HI>Riches take them&s;elves Wings, and flee away as the Eagles towards Heaven.</HI> You have an Affection to the <HI>Plea|&s;ures of Sen&s;e and of Sin,</HI> and are very loath to with|draw your De&s;ire and Choice. Alas, <HI>the Plea&s;ures of Sin are but for a Sea&s;on.</HI> You are fond of <HI>worldly Fame and Honour,</HI> and pant after Dignities and a great Name. Alas, <HI>Man being in Honour abideth not.</HI> You feel a glowing Affection to your <HI>Relatives,</HI> and your Heart beats with the Ardors of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Friend&s;hip.</HI> Alas, <HI>Lover and Friend mu&s;t for &s;ake you, and your Ac|quaintance</HI> retire <HI>into Darkne&s;s.</HI> You de&s;ire <HI>long Life,</HI> and love many Days that you may &s;ee Good. Alas, <HI>If by rea&s;on of Strength you &s;hould reach four&s;core Years, yet, &mdash;'tis &s;oon cut off, and we flee away.</HI> Thus you &s;ee how very temporary, how vani&s;hing and tran&s;ient are all Things here below! But now &s;et your Affection on the Things above, and they will la&s;t boundle&s;s as your Wi&s;hes, and immortal as your Souls. The <HI>Riches</HI> there, are <HI>durable Riches.</HI> The <HI>Plea&s;ures</HI> are <HI>Plea&s;ures forevermore.</HI> The <HI>Honours</HI> are, <HI>Salvation by</HI> CHRIST <HI>with eternal Glory.</HI> The <HI>Inheritance</HI> is <HI>incorruptible, un|defiled, and fadeth not away.</HI> The <HI>Companions die no more: Death is &s;wallowed up in Victory; there &s;hall be no more Death:</HI> And &s;o &s;hall we all be <HI>forever with the Lord.</HI> The <HI>Rewards</HI> are an <HI>everla&s;ting Crown,</HI> and <HI>Life eternal.</HI></P>
<P>And now, who would not try to &s;et their Affecti|ons on Things above, and not on Things on the Earth? Who would not take Pains for the new Nature, that he might do this? Though you go through Diffi|culty
<PB N="20" REF="004481_0018_100D541C0E54AF98">and Labour in this great Work, and meet with many Oppo&s;itions, Temptations and Afflictions in it, yet remember and take Encouragement from that Word of GOD, which I leave with you, and conclude, II. Cor. iv. 17, 18. <HI>For our light Affliction which is but for a Moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory; while we look not at the Things which are &s;een, but at the Things which are not &s;een; for the Things which are &s;een, are temporal, but the Things, which are not &s;een, are eternal.</HI></P>
