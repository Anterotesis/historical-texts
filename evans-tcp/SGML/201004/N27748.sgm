<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IF our government has pur&s;ued the cour&s;e dictated by the &s;pirit of our revolution; if good government requires the &s;ubjugation of one half of the community; if re|publicans have de&s;erved the la&s;hes and contempt which have been mo&s;t liberally dealt to them in this State for eleven yeare; or if the &s;pirit of per&s;ecution has &s;ub&s;ided: then the writer of the&s;e pages has been extremely unfortunate in the choice of his &s;ubject.</P>
<P>But Intolerance, with its hydra heads, &s;till roams about the &s;tate, and no mercy is &s;hewn to tho&s;e, who doubt the wi&s;dom of the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration The efforts of an individual are feeble when oppo&s;ed to the phalanx which &s;tand prepared to cru&s;h, in its infancy, freedom of enquiry and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. If the&s;e &s;entiments, claiming no high parentage, &s;hould fail of gaining the patronage of <HI>numbers</HI> in the &s;tate, they will be unable to endure even through the &s;hort period which generally bounds the exi&s;|tence of &s;uch ephemeral productions.</P>
<P>The&s;e pages pre&s;ent the corner-&s;tone of an AMERICAN PALACE, and the dark vault where are to be entombed, in eternal &s;leep, the liberties and hopes of this, and future generations. The foundation of a MONA<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">CHY is already laid in 6 per <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. 3 per cent. and deferred &s;tock, in millions of civil li&s;t and indirect taxation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Indirect taxation was &s;tiled by the old Congre&s;s, <HI>'The borror of all Free States.'</HI></NOTE>. The ari&s;tocracies already formed, are to be the pillars of this magnificent building. The glory of this latter hou&s;e is to tran&s;cend that of the edifice of freedom, which, erected on the rains of palaces, lately pre&s;ented a ma&s;&s;y colonnade of human bones. What infant, in his nur&s;e's arms, is to be the progenitor of an illu&s;trious race of AMERICAN MONARCHS, is yet unknown.</P>
<P>Are &s;uch &s;ugge&s;tions to be lightly regarded when it is now known, that a number of men, who have been our political leaders, were holding their meetings in the year 1787, to coutrive ways and means for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of what they termed, <HI>A Con&s;ederated Monarchy?</HI> When we read the &s;peech of general Hamilton, in the Fe|deral Convention, and now find him at the head of our army? When we hear our leading men avow, that this country can never be governed without an <HI>Hereditary Monarch?</HI> When we &s;ee the appropriate plans of <HI>Monarchy</HI> adopted by admini&s;tration? When we read the federal papers &s;ided with re&s;lections on liberty and republicani&s;m, and with prai&s;es of <HI>Monarchical</HI> government? When Fenno, the mouth-piece of the federal party, has ju&s;t publi&s;hed a &s;cheme of a <HI>Federated, Pre&s;idential, Monarchical Ari&s;tocracy?</HI></P>
<P>In the following pages I have endeavored to repre&s;ent <HI>truly</HI> the tendency of the leading mea&s;ures of our government; and even if one half of my po&s;itions and conclu|&s;ions be ju&s;t, <HI>a Monarchy is decidedly before us.</HI> The men now in place have been the contrivers or advocates of the&s;e <HI>mea&s;ures.</HI> If the people approve the <HI>means</HI> and the <HI>end,</HI> they will doubtle&s;s continue the <HI>in&s;truments</HI> in operation; otherwi&s;e a new elec|tion will open to republicans a new and mo&s;t de&s;irable pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>Our &s;outhern brechren wonder that Connecticut, once the garden of liberty, &s;hould now appear to be the hot-bed of ari&s;tocracy&mdash;that Connecticut, internally the mo&s;t democratie &s;tate in the union or in the world&mdash;a &s;tate, where the opinions of the
<PB N="iv" REF="036977_0003_100B72AD0B2C7170">people have governed for more than a century&mdash;where goverment is le&s;s expem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and energetic than in any other &s;tate&mdash;and where di&s;tinction of rank is hardly known, &s;hould be attached to expen&s;ive, energetic and ari&s;tocratic mea&s;ures, tending to hum|ble the people and to create odious di&s;tinctions: But the <HI>people</HI> of Connecticut have not de&s;erved to lo&s;e the confidence of republicans: They are radically attached to the principles of 1776, and to the declaration of independence, and are mortal &s;oes to hereditary monarchy; but by certain operations of federal policy, (as will be &s;een in the appendix) <HI>the people</HI> have no opportunity to expre&s;s their opinions on federal men and mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>If athei&s;m and modern philo&s;ophy prevailed in the &s;tate, there might be &s;ome fear of the final prevalence of ari&s;tocracy; but <HI>there is not an athei&s;t in the &s;tate, nor a &s;ingle modern philo&s;opher among the republican party.</HI> D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;m is not prevalent; yet there are dei&s;ts in both parties, who&s;e infidelity has originated from cau&s;es wholly unco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ected with politics. It has been &s;u&s;pected that &s;ome of the leading clergy wi&s;h t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">com|bine Church and State; but the body of the clergy, though they have preached Ro|bi&s;on and Barruel rather freely, have good intentions, and as fa&s;t as they &s;hall di&s;cover <HI>the tendency of our mea&s;ures to be again&s;t religion,</HI> they will become good republicans. In the &s;tate are &s;ome hypocrites, who carry their religion to market, and are willing to take pay for it in public offices and honors; yet the number of the&s;e is &s;mall and will probably decrea&s;e.</P>
<P>For eleven years freedom of the pre&s;s and of opinion has been re&s;trained; federal mea&s;ures have been pre&s;ented to the people, <HI>highly colored and embelli&s;hed with cuts;</HI> an habitual confidence in the &s;tate repre&s;entation has been extended to the federal repre|&s;entation: After the exertions of the revolutionary war, the people, habitually in|du&s;trious, retired to their farms and occupations, and the calm, which naturally &s;ucceeds the turbulence of war, &s;uperinduced by federal opiates, has hitherto pre|&s;erved them in a &s;tate of peaceful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the con&s;tituted authorities.</P>
<P>But a &s;ea&s;on has now arrived, when "a little more &s;leep, a little more &s;lumber, a little more folding of the hands to &s;leep," and they a&s;&s;uredly wake to a &s;tate of <HI>political ruin</HI> more dreadful to freemen than the ruins of empires. Our people are now rapidly declaring them&s;elves on the republican &s;ide: The tendency of mea&s;ores has rou&s;ed them, and we &s;hall finally prove to the world, that as Connecticut was among the <HI>fir&s;t to a&s;&s;ert,</HI> &s;he will be among the <HI>la&s;t to re&s;ign,</HI> the ble&s;&s;ings of equal government and the ine&s;timable rights of man.</P>

<HEAD>Political Delusion.</HEAD>
<P>ON the eve of a day &s;et apart for a literary fea&s;t of fat things, I have judged that a plain di&s;h would be mo&s;t acceptable. Indeed had it been a&s;&s;igned to me to &s;peak to you of Greece and Rome; of the inexhau&s;|tible trea&s;ures of Hebrew, Greek, and Arabic, or to have di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the height and diameter of the antedilu|vians, or to have explained the cau&s;e why a black man is not a white man, or why an an elm-tree does not bear apricots: you mu&s;t have &s;at here in &s;ilence, and the &s;pi|rit would never have moved me to addre&s;s you. Avoid|ing literary di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, I have &s;elected as the theme of this occa&s;ion, THE EXTENT AND POWER OF POLITICAL DE|LUSION.</P>
<P>The <HI>character</HI> of delu&s;ion is mo&s;t &s;trongly marked at its fir&s;t appearance in our world, when Satan (<HI>cide|vant</HI> that old &s;erpent, now called "the arch jacobin"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Lee's Sermon, preached at Colebrook, July 4, 1800.</NOTE>) practi&s;ed his deceit on our federal mother, &s;aying to her, "For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then &s;hall your eyes be opened and ye &s;hall be as gods knowing good and evil." In the work of deceit Satan has in all ages been uniform; he begins by quoting the knowledge of God in proof of that which is fal&s;e; he wi&s;hes to per&s;uade men to do that which they ought to avoid; he promi&s;es them good, and they &s;uffer evil; tho&s;e, who follow his advice, find the earth cur&s;ed for their &s;akes; thorns and thi&s;tles &s;pring up in place of fruits and flowers; by the &s;weat of their faces they eat their bread, till they return to the ground; and as for Satan, &s;ooner or later he appears to tho&s;e, whom he has d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cived, literally cur&s;ed above all cattle. I &s;hall now
<PB N="6" REF="036977_0005_100B72B0E32A2E98">leave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n to that cla&s;s of men, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ional bu&s;ine&s;s is to detect his delu&s;ions, with this mark, that I dou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> much whether they have rightly under&s;tood his <HI>policu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> character.</P>
<P>The <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gents</HI> of delu&s;ion are, the great, the wi&s;e, rich and mighty men of the world. These, acting with powers of &s;ub&s;titution, are very &s;agacious in choo&s;ing, and &s;ucce&s;sful in &s;ecuring, fit in&s;truments for their pur|po&s;es. Delu&s;ion prepares his prime agents with charming out&s;ides, engaging manners, powerful addre&s;s and inex|hau&s;tible argument. He furni&s;hes them with an accurate knowledge of the heart, and opens all the avenues to the pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The <HI>means</HI> of delu&s;ion are, uniformly the walking in a vain &s;how, hypocri&s;y a&s;&s;uming the garb of religion, pride of meekne&s;s, knavery of hone&s;ty, ambition of patrioti&s;m. As a full a&s;&s;umption of character is nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;ucce&s;s, and as delu&s;ion naturally over-acts, you find the greate&s;t impo&s;tors in our world to have appeared more holy, meek, hone&s;t and patriotic than other men.</P>
<P>The <HI>object</HI> of delu&s;ion is, to gain the wealth, honors and favors of men by cheap, fal&s;e and in&s;idious means.</P>
<P>The <HI>subjects</HI> of delu&s;ion are, the laboring and &s;ubor|dinate people throughout the world. Their toil goes to &s;upport the &s;plendor, luxury and vices of the deluders, or their blood flows to &s;atiate lawle&s;s ambition. Nearly the whole of Africa and a con&s;iderable part of A&s;ia, are &s;ubject to the delu&s;ions of Europe: &s;laves in im|men&s;e troops mu&s;t &s;weat under a &s;corching &s;un to bear or follow the palanquin of a lordly ma&s;ter: &s;laves by &s;hip loads mu&s;t be dragged from their homes to &s;erve imperious tyrants; immen&s;e multitudes mu&s;t be bowing to &s;tocks and &s;tones, or kneeling before images and lighted tapers, to grati&s;y the zeal of impo&s;tors.</P>
<P>The <HI>end</HI> of delu&s;ion is, the elevation of the deluders to a condition of power, &s;plendor and infallibility, and the reduction of the deluded from knowledge to ignorance,
<PB N="7" REF="036977_0006_100B72B419A79C98">from freedom to &s;lavery, from wealth to want, from pre&s;ent enjoymen to a de&s;titution of all things, and from future hopes to cea&s;ele&s;s doubt.</P>
<P>Having defined my &s;ubject I &s;hall exclude from di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion all ancient delu&s;ions, from a per&s;ua&s;ion that to us the pre&s;ent moment, the pre&s;ent character of man, the pre&s;ent form and pre&s;&s;ure of the times are infinitely more intere&s;ting than all the pa&s;t.</P>
<P>I might have entertained you with &s;ome of the light &s;kirmi&s;hes of delu&s;ion in the ordinary walks of life; but have preferred to lead you at once into the political field, where he brings into general action all his forces and di&s;plays all his character.</P>
<P>Having no lei&s;ure to make long porches, or to take by hou&s;e-row, the mea&s;ures of our government, I &s;hall begin with the COMMERCIAL, SYSTEM, which, like a common hall, gives you acce&s;s to all the rooms of the federal building.</P>
<P>When republicans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The terms "republican and democrat," are u&s;ed &s;ynonomou&s;ly throughout: becau&s;e the men who maintain the principles of 1776, are characteri&s;ed by one or the other of the&s;e names in different parts of the country.</NOTE> complain of a Navy, of diplo|matic corps, of Algerine tribute, or Briti&s;h treaty, the uniform reply of the agents of delu&s;ion is, "all the&s;e things are nece&s;&s;ary to commerce, and commerce is the handmaid of indu&s;try; abridge our political arrangements, &s;ay they, and all your well-earned produce would peri&s;h&mdash; your &s;hip-timber and &s;hips would be of no value&mdash;your &s;eamen would become towns-poor&mdash;your rope-walks go to decay, and your merchants become bankrupt!"</P>
<P>Now every well-informed merchant knows that there is not one word of truth in all this; yet as Delu&s;ion has forged the &s;tory for his benefit, he is di&s;po&s;ed not to di&s;credit it, and when &s;uch a plau&s;ible kind of things get a currency, they will pa&s;s like a well counter&s;eited bill, till by accident the deceit is di&s;covered, by which time the counterfeiter has gained all his ends. Every reflec|ting
<PB N="8" REF="036977_0007_100B72B5A6C98120">man knows that if the mo&s;t worthle&s;s produce in the world will attract our ve&s;&s;els to the mo&s;t di&s;tant ports, laden with the &s;taples of this country, then the&s;e &s;taples would, from their intrin&s;ic and unfailing value, toge|ther with the profits of the carrying trade, invite the merchants of tho&s;e ports to come and purcha&s;e of us. At our own doors we can make better bargains than abroad; we lo&s;e nothing by dangers of &s;ea, wa&s;tage, ca&s;ualties or bankruptcy; we receive every think at full weight and guage, and our articles are put off in the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible order without any diminution.</P>
<P>But, if with free ports and commerce thus con|ducted, our merchants could not live, then they live now merely by virtue of certain advantages tendered to them by the government, every one of which takes a million of dollars out of your pockets in order to enable you to gain half a million in another way. If the car|rying trade is valuable, and we retaining this trade by political arrangements &s;ecure it to our merchants, and yet Spain, Holland and Great Britain are willing to ex|change their manufactures in their own ports for our produce, then &s;urely our produce would be in high de|mand, and an object of &s;upreme competition, if go|vernment would &s;uffer the carrying trade to operate as a premium in favor of our market.</P>
<P>The fundamental propo&s;ition, viz. that &s;eparate from the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, our articles would not be in market, is pointedly denied, and if this is fal&s;e, the whole &s;uper|&s;tructure falls.</P>
<P>The real object is diametrically oppo&s;ite to the o&s;ten|&s;ible one. The agricultural intere&s;t, in&s;tead of being helped, is vitally attacked. This charming commercial &s;y&s;tem, &s;o &s;edulou&s;ly and artfully addre&s;&s;ed to the yeo|manry of our country, is a &s;y&s;tem of indebtedne&s;s and eventual bankruptcy. Confining the carrying trade to our&s;elves, opens an infinite field of credit to the mer|chant, Millions of property, belonging to the farmers,
<PB N="9" REF="036977_0008_100B72B80AC0FDA0">mu&s;t con&s;tantly be in the hands of the merchants; for if the avails of our produce are to come from all quar|ters of the globe, there mu&s;t be an average credit given by the farmers till the returns can be made. This draws on to the water an immen&s;e quantity of property, and intere&s;ts the farmers &s;trongly in the &s;ucce&s;s of the mer|chants whom they have tru&s;ted. This property on the water is within fi&s;cal purview and control. Government has purpo&s;es to an&s;wer. The merchant is indirectly the collector of a great portion of the revenue. The mer|chant can lend &s;hips and cargoes to government. The merchant can plan long, circuitous and hazardous voy|ages apparently at his own ri&s;que; but really at the ri&s;que of the farmer; for all lo&s;&s;es mu&s;t eventually fall on tho&s;e who tru&s;t. The&s;e arrangements lead up great capitals in trade, great bankruptcies and great fortunes. They fill the &s;ea with ve&s;&s;els and &s;ailors, valuable auxiliaries and reverberators to a naval &s;y&s;tem. This la&s;t being calculated to protect the merchants, &s;ecures their perpe|tual attachment, and they freely advocate the extraordi|nary expen&s;es of an armament. Their influence is thrown directly in the &s;cale oppo&s;ed to the farmer, and government has thereby &s;ecured a number of capital|i&s;ts to whom re&s;ort may be had in the day when grind|ing runs low at the trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>Before the adoption of this &s;y&s;tem &s;ilver and gold moved according to the laws of indu&s;try; but now banks are introduced, giving to paper a forced and unnatural circulation, taking the command of the medium of all bu&s;ine&s;s from the agricultural intere&s;t,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Money ought to repre&s;ent indu&s;try; the farmer's dollars earned by labor do repre&s;ent it: bank bills do not. It is hard on the farmer, that the man who earns nothing through the year, &s;hould be able with an indor&s;ed note to ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e in an hour, double the annual avails of his farm, and to glut the market with money at the very moment when the farmer is ready to bring his dollars to market. Directors of banks can make money &s;carce or plenty as they plea&s;e; but though banks are ruinous to the farmers, they are nece&s;&s;ary to a forced com|merce.</NOTE> and yielding it wholly to the cominercial.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="036977_0009_100B72BC04A20900">
It is no wonder that in the complexity of this policy, the farmer is lo&s;t in the mid&s;t of paper bills, boundle&s;s credit, crouded harbors, princely e&s;tates, and made to cry out, O! the depth of the wi&s;dom of admini&s;tration! little dreaming that he has in fact paid and is paying an|nually the whole pro&s;its of the carrying trade, the whole of the Algerine tribute, the expen&s;e of all commercial treaties&mdash;of all the con&s;uls abroad&mdash;the amount of all the lo&s;&s;es by &s;ea&mdash;of all bad markets, and of all navy expen&s;es&mdash;that the money, which he pays, &s;uffers many &s;weatings before it gets to the trea&s;ury, and that what he does not pay is placed on intere&s;t, and that the land from which he rai&s;es this produce, which excites &s;uch a fatherly care of government, is pledged for the payment of princi|pal and intere&s;t, and that his children may always &s;ee the date and amount of the mortgage by calling on the &s;ur|veyors of the revenue. Little &s;hort of miracle can re|deem men from &s;uch ma&s;terly &s;trokes of delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>This mercantile &s;y&s;tem leads up an appearance of im|men&s;e pro&s;perity, the reality of which is eraftily a&s;cribed to government; but individuals appear to the world mo&s;t thrifty, when they are thriftily expending the price of their mortgaged e&s;tates: nations appear mo&s;t bu&s;y and thriving in &s;ea&s;ons of the greate&s;t expen&s;e and pub|lic di&s;&s;ipation: for &s;uch occa&s;ions draw all the money into view and give it a rapid circulation. When a dollar changed owners once in a week it counted only for a dollar; but when by the magic power of a forced com|merce it changes owners an hundred times in a week it counts for an hundred dollars. If all the property of a town like this were to be tran&s;ported every day through all the &s;treets, there would be great commotion and a great &s;how of bu&s;ine&s;s and wealth, and the gaping world might admire the thrift of the place and might lend mo|ney on the credit of it. Ju&s;t like &s;uch a farce is that of the great public pro&s;perity now enjoyed. The people are not more indu&s;trious than they were before the re|volution:
<PB N="11" REF="036977_0010_100B72BD88DB74C0">they are certainly more extravagant, mort|gages abound more on the records&mdash;<HI>including public and private indebtedne&s;s, there never was a &s;ea&s;on before this when the people were &s;o deeply involved.</HI> Burn all your paper-bills and your paper evidences of debt, public and private, worlds full of which would not add one cent to the real wealth of any country, or collect the debts evidenced by the&s;e papers, and which now lie as a heavy weight on the hou&s;es, lands and indu&s;try of the people, and this vi&s;ion of pro&s;perity would vani&s;h: but this delu&s;ion an&s;wers the political purpo&s;es of un&s;ettling the public mind, of de&s;troying frigid ideas of economy, and of making tolerable many public projections, which otherwi&s;e would be dete&s;ted.</P>
<P>This commercial &s;y&s;tem pre&s;ents to the world an im|men&s;e tonnage, which not only fortifies the appearance of pro&s;perity; but affords employment to a numerous cla&s;s of men on land, who mu&s;t feel grateful for a &s;y&s;tem which yields them wealth; and it employs a number of ma&s;ters and mates, who mu&s;t ki&s;s the hand which feeds them; and &s;ailors, who are mo&s;t valuable a&s;tringents in the ingredient of power, and may an&s;wer for lining to wooden walls: and delu&s;ion whi&s;pers that by the&s;e things all the money is &s;aved among our&s;elves. Though this is among Delu&s;ion's weak tricks, yet it is too often &s;ucce&s;sful. It has been well &s;aid that it will co&s;t two ducats to keep one in pri&s;on. To the man, who is able to pay for money, it matters not whether that which is to fill his coffers be now in his own town, or in Madrid or Canton: his indu&s;try will draw in from the ends of the earth. If we lived on an i&s;thmus or an i&s;land, the &s;ugge&s;tion of &s;aving the money might be more plau&s;ible; but living in a country of immen&s;e extent, capable of employing more than ten times its number of inhabi|tants, capable of infinite internal defence, and of keep|ing tributary to us all nations &s;o long as natural or arti|ficial wants &s;hall be known in the world, it is an idle
<PB N="12" REF="036977_0011_100B72BFEA722A48">&s;ugge&s;tion&mdash;and the time will come, when it will be hard to make the readers of hi&s;tory believe that Americans in the infancy of &s;ociety, of &s;ettlement and agriculture, did &s;eriou&s;ly undertake to fight their way through nations, whom they could not buy nor bribe, to carry the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life to the men of tho&s;e nations who were peri&s;hing for the want of them, and then with a return-cargo of far le&s;s u&s;eful produce to fight their way home again&mdash;and that all this was done with the full and free con&s;ent of the men who rai&s;ed the exports, and who could have &s;old them without hazard for a better price at their own doors.</P>

<P>Having pre&s;ented a cour&s;e of delu&s;ions under the head of the&s;e great men: you may be ready to a&s;k, If the&s;e men are dangerous, how &s;hall we get rid of them? I an&s;wer, that the&s;e great and dangerous men, who&s;e feelings and intere&s;ts are always oppo&s;ed to equal rights generally compo&s;e about <HI>one tenth</HI> of &s;o|ciety. You have no other means to extricate your|&s;elves; but by pa&s;&s;ing over that part of the <HI>nine tenths</HI> whom they have &s;ecured by favors of deluded by their enchantments, and to choo&s;e from the remainder the firme&s;t and mo&s;t intelligent.

But you may be comforted, the&s;e great men are made of very flexible materials; and as &s;oon as they find power to be decidedly on the other &s;ide of the
<PB N="40" REF="036977_0039_100B7302F4704160">equation, they will be after it: and perhaps &s;ome of the&s;e <HI>ba&s;e-born</HI> may prove them&s;elves to be better than they appear. You will recollect that the citizens of this country are like trees, all &s;et out together: but, through the influence of a &s;y&s;tem of favor, one part of them have been nur&s;ed and watered, and the earth about them en|riched: they have had all the nouri&s;hment of the ground, the others have been neglected. Not only &s;o, but the language to them has been "be ye accur&s;ed, let no fruit grow on ye forever." Are we to wonder that all pa&s;&s;ers by admire the thrift and flouri&s;hing &s;tate of the fir&s;t, and are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ay that the la&s;t ought to be cut down and gathered into bundles?</P>
<P>'Tis a real misfortune to the nine-tenths of &s;ociety, that the other tenth &s;hould be oppo&s;ed to them; but never let it be fogotten, that the argument drawn from the coincidence of great and wi&s;e and holy politici|ans in public mea&s;ures, is of all others the mo&s;t alarm|ing. The&s;e are the only men whom you have to fear. If &s;ome are apparently more holy than their neighbors, then if they meddle with your politics they are mo&s;t capable of deceiving you: their holine&s;s may recom|mend them to heaven; but is no guarantee for their political rectitude. This cla&s;s, however, are gene|rally &s;et on by other great men: not by tho&s;e who are great becau&s;e they are rich; for the&s;e are the tools of another &s;et, who are the knowing ones. In Athens tho&s;e who became too great and influential &s;uffered o&s;traci&s;m: but in this country we ought to have pru|dence enough to prevent any man, or cla&s;s of men, from de&s;erving &s;uch an honorable bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>For my own part, I am willing to be governed by men greater, wi&s;er and richer than my&s;elf: but have no opinion of having men &s;o great that their altitude mu&s;t be taken by a quadrant and their width by a four rod chain: through exce&s;&s;ive indulgence we have, already, a number of men too great for a republic. How comes
<PB N="41" REF="036977_0040_100B7304871B61B8">it that the&s;e great men are &s;o very fit to govern? Inter|nal government is de&s;igned to control inordinate pa&s;&s;i|ons: great men are mo&s;t proud, avaricious, and tyran|nical: will you then &s;elect the&s;e to curb pride, avarice and tyranny? Republican &s;ociety is to protect the weak again&s;t the &s;trong: but, if the &s;trong are to have all the power the weak will be oppre&s;&s;ed. But &s;ays one and another, what will become of our great men? My an&s;wer is, that they always had addre&s;s enough to work their own pa&s;&s;ages. The great ho&s;t of mankind, the nine-tenths, are tho&s;e, which a republican government ought to concern it&s;elf about: and if this is faithfully at|tended to, the other tenth will &s;till gain &s;uch a portion of power and money as will make them u&s;eful in&s;tead of dangerous. They are the very men for your purpo&s;es whenever you have reduced them to the &s;tandard weight and mea&s;ure of the people.</P>
<P>I am well aware of the great convenience which many of you find in keeping clo&s;e to the&s;e knowing men, in gathering the crumbs which fall from the tables of the rich, and in &s;ailing under the lee of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical con|voy-&s;hips; but you are taking a bad road: it is a broad road; it is <HI>the</HI> broad road: thou&s;ands have paid turnpike toll on it before you were born; and, if you follow it, it may lead you to wealth and honors; it may ruin your country; but will certainly land you where it has landed all your predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Having little confidence in addre&s;&s;ing placemen, court &s;ycophants and tho&s;e who expect the wages of hirelings, I turn to the la&s;t general head of political delu&s;ions, which is the &s;ubject of ELECTIONS TO OFFICE.</P>

Your trea&s;ury, &s;upplied with your own money, is to ope|rate again&s;t your freedom of election. See the ho&s;t of your brethren, who depend on that trea&s;ury. Tens of thou&s;ands of men in our country live on the people&punc; but independent of them and their weight and influence is found mo&s;tly in the governing &s;cale.

<P>I have introduced this little &s;pecimen of toa&s;ts to &s;well the li&s;t of delu&s;ive arts which are practi&s;ed to render palatable the mea&s;ures of admini&s;tration, and to give force to a remark, that on the &s;ide of govern|ment have been prayers, &s;ermons, orations, toa&s;ts, offices, influence and trea&s;ury; and again&s;t the re|publicans, alien and &s;edition laws; exclu&s;ion from of|fice; abu&s;e in and out of congre&s;s; reviling in new&s;|papers; and yet, with all this, at the end of 11 years, if the officers of government could be cho&s;en <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nder a new cen&s;us, there is a moral certainty of a great ma|jority in favour of the democratic candidates.

<P>When delu&s;ion has given command to attack the democrats on the &s;core of their attachment to the cau&s;e of France, the &s;tage, the de&s;k and the pre&s;s have been alike at his &s;ervice.

Well, &s;ay the&s;e deluders, let the democrats have their way, they will appoint a pre&s;ident who will turn out all the old tried officers, and put a &s;et of men in their place, who would annihilate the funding &s;y&s;tem and bring confu&s;ion out of order: then goes national character: for the&s;e men have no idea of hone&s;ty or public faith; but the&s;e democrats who be&s;t know their own calculations, profe&s;s that a pre&s;ident of their choice would probably retain in place all men who had &s;erved faithfully.

Now if the contempt of the&s;e great men for the nine tenths of &s;ociety were all it might be borne; but immen&s;e &s;ums mu&s;t be levied by them in order to &s;upport their &s;plendor and their &s;chemes of great|ne&s;s. I have avoided to &s;peak to you of unaccounted for millions; but HAVE PRESENTED SYSTEMS BY WHICH THE WEALTH OF THE WORLD IS TO BE WASTED, AND THE BLOOD OF MILLIONS IS TO FLOW; yet it may be well for you to know that the &s;upport of your government now amounts to 42,000 dollars a day:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix.</NOTE> that this expence has been, and is increa&s;ing; and that, in the la&s;t &s;e&s;|&s;ion, it was found impo&s;&s;ible to provide ways and means to rai&s;e the 15 millions of dollars for the ex|pences of the pre&s;ent year. The &s;ecretary propo&s;ed a &s;tamp duty on transfers of real e&s;tate. The com|mittee of ways and means propo&s;ed a national lotte|ry, which might annually rai&s;e from 100 to 150,000 dollars; and the &s;ame committee reported the expe|diency of impowering the pre&s;ident to borrow 3,500,000 dollars for the &s;ervice of the pre&s;ent year. Large loans are convenient &s;ops for a greedy &s;ink|ing fund&mdash;when public re&s;ources fail, and public good requires &s;ome object to be compa&s;&s;ed too aban|doned to ju&s;tify a tax or a &s;ub&s;cription, a lottery is often propo&s;ed, and in the &s;cheme immen&s;e advan|tages are offered to the purcha&s;er: <HI>no less than one chance in</HI> 25,000 <HI>to draw the highe&s;t prize.</HI> An old &s;oldier would be &s;hot at for one cent, if his chance of being killed was no greater than one in 25,000; but wor&s;e than bad chances, the &s;inews of indu&s;try mu&s;t be cut in the purcha&s;er: relying on dame fortune he mu&s;t quit dame indu&s;try; for they keep their lod|gers at different hotels. <HI>Scarcely two and a half blanks to a prize!</HI> and why &s;hould not fortune deluge a man for this once, when before &s;he had never dropped on him a particle of her dew? But the fortunate adven|turer mu&s;t re&s;ign 15 per cent. in order to entitle him to a draw-back of 15 per cent. in his chance for
<PB N="65" REF="036977_0064_100B733F88527288">ruin; and the woe-worn di&s;appointed blank-holders are taught to wait for another &s;cheme and better &s;tars.</P>
<P>All this bears in front the marks of delu&s;ion, and it is far better to be thus deluded than to have money rai&s;ed upon us by indirect means. When my tax-ma&s;ter fears to pre&s;ent me his bill, le&s;t I &s;hould a&s;k the whys and wherefores, he contrives in &s;ome artful way to pick my pockets. He knows that I have pa&s;|&s;ions, propen&s;ities and wants. <HI>These</HI> he taxes in the articles which contribute to my &s;upply or indulgence. He &s;ees that &s;treams of wealth are flowing into the trea&s;ury thro' the medium of &s;ugar hog&s;heads and tea|che&s;ts. I feel that my re&s;ources are expending: he cheers me up with, <HI>"fear not, the hairs of your head are all numbered;"</HI> to which I might well reply, <HI>"yes, and all the pence in my pocket."</HI> But lotteries draw money from the credulous; indirect taxes from the voluptuary: imperious nece&s;&s;ity demands a &s;tamp, and valuation tax: all will not ward off the dreaded cri&s;is. Tho' in an individual the lending of money at 8 per cent. is a crime, denominated by &s;tatute corrupt and u&s;urious, and meriting a forfeiture of the whole &s;um loaned; yet the exigencies of government drive them to procure the commi&s;&s;ion of this crime. Then comes the moment for &s;overeign delu&s;ion to open all its batteries, the wounds of a bleeding country! ju&s;t healing under the metallic tractors of Grenville, o|pened afre&s;h, by exterminating France: a country im|poveri&s;hed by too copious emanations of gratitude to|wards the revolutionary army, and overpowered by &s;en&s;ibility towards the dey of Algiers, for &s;uffering us to exchange the mo&s;t valuable productions of the earth, for the wine, oil and fruits of the Mediter|ranean: a mo&s;t benevolent country, wi&s;hing to be on &s;peaking and hand-&s;haking terms with every power in Europe, and obliged for that end to &s;end abroad <HI>ship loads of diplomacy:</HI> a mo&s;t equitable country! &s;uf|fering the irruptions of law le&s;s &s;avages and the plots of &s;editious jacobins&mdash;mu&s;t have an army; mu&s;t have a fleet.

<P>(<HI>See reference in page</HI> 32.)</P>
<P>In Connecticut the&s;e officers are cho&s;en by the &s;tate at large, not by di&s;tricts. In both cla&s;&s;es nominations are fir&s;t made, and the men nominated are generally un|known to the freemen: So true is this, that if the name of George Penro&s;e, or Henry H. Childs, were &s;et in the li&s;t, they would &s;tand a good chance of being within the fir&s;t 18 for Congre&s;s or the fir&s;t 20 for Council, though the&s;e men do not live in the &s;tate. But for the &s;ake of giving permanency to the&s;e offices, the names of tho&s;e who have been in office are generally at the head of the li&s;t, and have a far greater chance of gaining the no|mination than tho&s;e near the foot of it. When the votes for coun&s;ellors are counted, if the &s;enior coun&s;ellor of the la&s;t year &s;hould be found to have the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> number within the fir&s;t 20, yet he will be returned to the free|men as <HI>fir&s;t</HI> in nomination: whereas he ought to be the <HI>la&s;t.</HI> Place him <HI>la&s;t</HI> and it would be next to a miracle if he &s;hould be appointed. Place him <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and he will &s;urely be re-elected. If the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives at|tempt to alter this they are always negatived by the council. The council thus permanently fixed, are a&s;&s;o|ciated with the corporation of Yale college, which is ge|nerally compo&s;ed of intelligent mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel. This combination of Church and State, furni&s;hes a co|lumn of influence which has been hitherto u&s;ed in favor of the men in place. The right of the people to choo&s;e electors has been taken from them. Their right to have the man returned as fir&s;t in nomination, whom they placed fir&s;t, has been taken from them: Multitudes of freemen have cea&s;ed to attend freemen's meetings, from a per&s;ua&s;ion that with their be&s;t exertions, they will be unable to effect any thing; and it really is not important for them to re-a&s;&s;ert their rights of election, till they
<PB N="76" REF="036977_0075_100B735AEC08A4E0">have re&s;olved to break the enchantments and bani&s;h the delu&s;ions which encompa&s;s them.</P>
<P>The delu&s;ion above explained, has been brought into partner&s;hip with that of depriving the people of choo&s;ing electors: both are now made &s;ubservient to federal pur|po&s;es &mdash;each &s;trengthens the other and the people are held at arms length from an intelligent exerci&s;e of &s;uf|frage.</P>

<P>The following extract is given in order to enable the reader to judge for him&s;elf.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="extract">
<HEAD>FIRST INPRESSION, PAGE 292.</HEAD>
<P>"The errors &s;eem not &s;ufficiently eradicated, that the operations of the mind, as well as the acts of the body, are &s;ubject to the coercion of the laws. But our rulers can have authority over &s;uch natural rights only as we have &s;ubmited to them. The rights of con&s;cience we never &s;ubmitted, we could not &s;ubmit. We are an|&s;werable for them to our God. The legitimate powers of government extend to &s;uch acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbour to &s;ay there are twenty gods, or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg. If it be &s;aid his te&s;timony in a court of Ju&s;tice cannot be relied on, reject
<PB N="77" REF="036977_0076_100B735D536C1F48">it then, and be the &s;tigma on him. Con&s;traint may make him wor&s;e, by making him a hypocrite, but it will never make him a truer man. it may fix him ob|&s;tinately in his errors, but will not cure them. Rea&s;on and free enquiry are the only effectual agents again&s;t error. Give a loo&s;e to them, they will &s;upport the true religion by bringing every fal&s;e one to their tribu|nal, to the te&s;t of their inve&s;tigation, They are the na|tural enemies of error, and of error only. Had not the Roman government permitted free enquiry, <HI>chri&s;ti|anity</HI> could never have been introduced. Had not free enquiry been indulged, at the era of the reformation, the corruptions of <HI>chri&s;tianity</HI> could not have been purg|ed away. If it be re&s;trained now, the pre&s;ent corrup|tions will be protected and new ones encouraged. Was the government to pre&s;cribe to us our medicine and diet, our bodies would be in &s;uch keeping as our &s;ouls are now. Thus in France the emetic was once forbidden as a medicine, and the potatoe as an article of food. Government is ju&s;t as infallible too when it fixes &s;y&s;tems in phy&s;ics. Galileo, was &s;ent to the inqui&s;ition for af|firming that the earth was a &s;phere: the government had declared it to be as flat as a trencher, and Galileo was obliged to abjure his error. This however at length prevailed, the earth became a globe, and De&s;cartes de|clared it was whirled round its axis by a vortex. The government in which he lived was wi&s;e enough to &s;ee that this was no que&s;tion of civil juri&s;diction, or we &s;hould all have been involved by authority in vortices. In fact the vortices have been exploded, and the New|tonian principle of gravitation is now more firmly e&s;tab|li&s;hed on the ba&s;is of rea&s;on, than it would be were the government to &s;tep in and make it an article of nece&s;&s;ary faith. Rea&s;on and experiment have been indulged, and error has fled before them. It is error alone which needs the &s;upport of government. Truth can &s;tand by it&s;elf. Subject opinion to coercion: whom will you
<PB N="78" REF="036977_0077_100B735FA6D0EB90">make your inqui&s;itors? Fallible men; men governed by bad pa&s;&s;ions, by private as well as public rea&s;ons. And why &s;ubject it to coercion? To produce uniformi|ty. But is uniformity of opinion de&s;irable? No more than of face and &s;tature. Introduce the bed of Procru&s;|tes then, and as there is danger that the large men may beat the &s;mall, make us all of a &s;ize, by lopping the former and &s;tretching the latter. Difference of opinion is advantageous in religion. The &s;everal &s;ects perform the office of a Cen&s;or morum over each other. Is uni|formity attainable? Millions of innocent men, women and children, &s;ince the introduction of chri&s;tianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, impri&s;oned: yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity.&mdash; What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites. To &s;up|port roguery and error all over the earth. Let us reflect that it is inhabited by a thou&s;and millions of people. That the&s;e profe&s;s probably a thou&s;and different &s;y&s;tems of religion. That ours is but one of that thou&s;and, That if there be but one right, and ours that one, we &s;hould wi&s;h to &s;ee the 999 wandering &s;ects gathered into the fold of truth. But again&s;t &s;uch a majority we can|not effect this by force. <HI>Rea&s;on and per&s;ua&s;ion are the only</HI> practicable in&s;truments. To make way for the&s;e, free enquiry mu&s;t be indulged; and how can we wi&s;h others to indulge it when we refu&s;e it our&s;elves. But every &s;tate, &s;ays an inqui&s;itor, has e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ome re|ligion. No two, &s;ay I, have e&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;ame. Is this a proof of the infallibility of e&s;tabli&s;hments? Our &s;i&s;ter &s;tates of Penn&s;ylvania and New-York, how|ever, have long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted without any e&s;tabli&s;hment at all. The <HI>experiment was new and doubtful when they made it. It has an&s;wered beyond conception.</HI> They <HI>flou|ri&s;h infinitely.</HI> Religion is well &s;upported; of various kinds indeed, but all good enough; all &s;ufficient to pre|&s;erve peace and order: or if a &s;ect ari&s;es who&s;e tenets
<PB N="79" REF="036977_0078_100B7362DBDCEB58">would &s;ubvert morals, good &s;en&s;e has fair play, and rea&s;ons and laughs it out of doors, without &s;uffering the &s;tate to be troubled with it. They do not hang more malefactors than we do. They are not more di&s;turbed with religious di&s;&s;entions. On the contrary, their har|mony is unparalleled, and can be a&s;cribed to nothing but their unbounded tolerance, becau&s;e there is no other circum&s;tance in which they differ from every nation on earth. They have made the happy di&s;covery that the way to &s;ilence religious di&s;putes, is to take no notice of them. Let us too give this experiment fair play, and get rid, while we may, of tho&s;e tyrannical laws. It is true we are as yet &s;ecured again&s;t them by the &s;pirit of the times, I doubt whether the people of this country would &s;uffer an execution for here&s;y, or a three years impri&s;onment for not comprehending the my&s;teries of the trinity. But is the &s;pirit of the people an infallible, a permanent reliance? Is it government? Is this the kind of protection we receive in return for the rights we give up? Be&s;ides, the &s;pirit of the times may alter, will alter. Our rulers will become corrupt, our people carele&s;s. A &s;ingle zealot may commence per&s;ecuter, and better men be his victims. It can never be too of|ten repeated, that the time for fixing every e&s;&s;ential right on a legal ba&s;is is while our rulers are hone&s;t and our&s;elves united. From the conclu&s;ion of this war we &s;hall be going down hill. It will not then be nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;ort every moment to the people for &s;upport. They will be forgotten therefore, and their rights di&s;regarded. They will forget them&s;elves, but in the &s;ole faculty of making money, and will never think of uniting to effect a due re&s;pect for their rights. The &s;hackles therefore, which &s;hall not be knocked off at the conclu&s;ion of this war, will remain on us long, will be made heavier and heavier till our rights &s;hall revive, or expire in a con|vul&s;ion."</P>
