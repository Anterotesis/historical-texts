<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<P>AS I was on a Journey I lit on a Book intituled, Mr. <HI>Adams</HI>'s <HI>Sermon on Chri&s;tian Unity.</HI> As this was a &s;ubject I take great Satisfaction in, I read it, when I came toward the Clo&s;e of the Sermon, I found he told there were &s;ome great Things going forward in the Town where he delivered his Sermon, as though it threatened the whole Chri&s;tian <HI>Order</HI> and Con&s;titution; this made me curious to know, where tho&s;e Terrible Things were going forward; which he intimated were &s;o threatening. By turning to the Title Page, I found he &s;aid, it was preached in BOLTON in NEW-ENGLAND: but this did not determine whe|ther it was BOLTON in CONNECTICUT, or in the MAS|SACHUSETTS: However, by Report it appeared that it was <HI>Bolton</HI> in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</HI> Whereupon I enquired into the State of that Town, and what the <HI>Controver&s;y</HI> was, which Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> &s;aid was <HI>ri&s;en to &s;o great height;</HI> and ac|cording to the be&s;t information I could get, it was in brief as follows.&mdash;There had for &s;ome Time prevailed a Report,
<PB N="4" REF="012714_0003_0F8B8DA27A73F958">it. Town and out, that the Mini&s;ter of that Town, had in &s;undry In&s;tances appeared as if he were overcome with Spi|rituous Liquor; and &s;ome appearances in Time of public Wor&s;hip were &s;uch, as gave a general Su&s;picion to the Con|gregation, that this was the Ca&s;e; and particularly in the Afternoon, Sacrament-Day. Upon which the Church tho't they could no longer neglect treating with him upon it, which when they did, he declared that he never had drank to that de|gree, &s;o as in any Way to affect or hurt his Rea&s;on, Speech or Limbs. The Church being di&s;po&s;ed to put the mo&s;t charaitable and favourable Con&s;truction po&s;&s;ible upon his Conduct, voted to accept of this Declaration for a Settlement of the Affair, upon Condition he would read it off publickly to the Congregation the next Lord's Day; and lodge a Copy of it with the elde&s;t Deacon. But in&s;tead of reading it di&s;tinctly, as was expect|ed; he read it intermixed with his Sermon, &s;o that many of the Congregation, did not under&s;tand that he had read it at all; and enquired why he had not done as he had promi&s;ed. Hence the Difficulty continued and revived, and other In|&s;tances of Intemperance complained of, be&s;ide that on Sacra|ment-Day, till they called in a Council; before whom he for a while, continued his Declaration of Innocency, till at length on a &s;udden, out comes a full Confe&s;&s;ion, of having been guilty of Intemperance in &s;undry In&s;tances. When this was propo&s;ed to the Church for their Acceptance, they &s;aid they could not put this and his former Declaration together; and therefore could not accept of it as &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>However, after &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e it obtained a Vote of the Majority of the Brethren. But how it obtained I never could conceive, only as the People were very candid, tender of him, and di&s;po&s;ed to take up with any thing rather than to con|tinue a Difficulty; for the main Thing, that I under&s;tand was urged to reconcile tho&s;e two Things, was that this Confe&s;&s;ion, was no more than he had done before, the Brethren not hav|ing &s;aid old Declaration at that time to compare.</P>
<P>However, &s;ome remaining di&s;&s;atisfied: &s;aid old Declaration was afterward had and compared. Whereupon the di&s;&s;ati&s;|faction was continued and increa&s;ed; for now, not only did it appear that they were far from agreeing: but it was complained, that &s;aid old Declaration as it was left with the Deacon was a fal&s;e Copy. And Mr. <HI>Go&s;s</HI> &s;aid he knew it was a fal&s;e one, when he left it, that he told the Deacon &s;o. The Deacon denied that he did tell him &s;o; or that he in the lea&s;t mi&s;tru&s;ted it, from any thing he &s;aid. The Deacon was an old Man, and not mi&s;tru&s;ting any thing, never read it. The&s;e Difficulties were agreed to be referred to a Committee
<PB N="5" REF="012714_0004_0F8B8DA699490D90">mutually cho&s;en of the Brethren of the Church. After the Aggrieved had fini&s;hed their Evidence and Pleas, Mr. <HI>Go&s;s</HI> &s;ays he has &s;ome Allegations to lay in again&s;t the Complainants, viz. That they were guilty of Bla&s;phemy, or Things bor|dering upon it. He was a&s;ked whether he had taken the previous Chri&s;tian &s;teps with them? He &s;aid he had. He was then a&s;ked why he had not brought it forward before? He an&s;wered, becau&s;e he knew not of them till to-Day, and chiefly this Afternoon.</P>
<P>This broke up the propo&s;ed Settlement by &s;aid Commit|tee. Hence another Council was called, and &s;aid Matter of Grievance &s;aid before them. At which al&s;o new Matters of Grievance appeared, viz. a Charge again&s;t Mr. <HI>Go&s;s</HI> of &s;hewing a Paper to the former Council, which he had pro|mi&s;ed he would not, and that &s;aid Paper as he had &s;hewn it was erroneous. This Complaint, the pre&s;ent Coun|cil utterly refu&s;ed to take under Con&s;ideration, notwith&s;tand|ing repeated Importunity. Hence the Re&s;ult of this Coun|cil was not accepted by the Church. It was motioned and urged by &s;ome of the Brethren to endeavour an accommoda|tion in the Church. Mr. <HI>Go&s;s</HI> for &s;ome time neglected to call a Church-Meeting for that Purpo&s;e. At length he cal|led a Meeting to &s;ee if they would accept the Re&s;ult of the la&s;t Council; at which the Affair of &s;aid Paper was called in Que&s;tion. The Complainant &s;aid it was not &s;ettled; nor was he prepared for a Hearing, viz. becau&s;e Mr. <HI>Go&s;s</HI> had promi&s;ed him a Copy of &s;aid Paper; but had not yet done it. Mr. <HI>Go&s;s</HI> was a&s;ked why he had not fulfilled &s;aid Pro|mi&s;e? He denied that he had &s;o promi&s;ed. The Com|plainant immediately in the pre&s;ence of the Church proved that Mr. <HI>Go&s;s</HI> had &s;o promi&s;ed. Then Mr. <HI>Go&s;s</HI> &s;aid he had altered his Purpo&s;e. He was a&s;ked if he had a <HI>di&s;pen&s;ing Power with his Promi&s;es?</HI> He an&s;wered he had. Some di&s;|cour&s;e intervened to this Puropo&s;e, that a good man though he had promi&s;ed to his Hurt would perform. And then the Que&s;tion was again put, <HI>Let me under&s;tand you Mr.</HI> Go&s;s, <HI>is that really your Principle, that you have a Right to di&s;pen&s;e with your Promi&s;es &s;o made to a Brother?</HI> He an&s;wered, <HI>it was.</HI> Upon &s;ome very great di&s;&s;atisfaction at this, appear|ing in one e&s;pecially that had always &s;tood for him, and &s;ome further Di&s;cour&s;e, Mr. <HI>Go&s;s</HI> &s;aid he did not mean, practice, nor teach &s;o, <HI>it was Inadvertance,</HI> and renewedly promi&s;ed to give &s;aid Copy, and agreed to be tried by the Church as to the Matters of Grievance again&s;t him. The Meeting was adjourned, &s;aid Copy was given. At the Adjournment a number of Aggrievances were brought in again&s;t Mr. <HI>Go&s;s,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="012714_0005_0F8B8DA761F7D0E8">as appears by an atte&s;ted Copy under Mr. <HI>Go&s;s</HI>'s Hand. He tried <HI>fir&s;t</HI> whether they would con&s;ider the fir&s;t Complaint? Pa&s;s'd affirmatively, but objected again&s;t by the Pa&s;tor. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Whether the Church judged the fir&s;t Article pro|ved? An&s;wered affirmatively, but objected again&s;t by the Pa&s;tor. Here it is worthy to be ob&s;erved, That he had at a former Meeting agreed, that the&s;e Aggrievances &s;hould be tried by the Church. Now he negatives them upon the &s;ame Head, and goes on directly to trying that which he had ne|gatived, and according to his own Notion had made void. At &s;everal Adjournments &s;ome of &s;aid Articles were acted upon by the Church. At length, before they had gone through the Bu&s;ine&s;s, Mr. <HI>Go&s;s</HI> di&s;&s;olved the Church Meeting <HI>pro arbitrio,</HI> contrary to the Mind of the Church. Soon after a Number of the Brethren apply to him to call a Church Meeting in order to &s;end out for a Council. Mr. <HI>Go&s;s</HI> refu&s;es, unle&s;s they would be bound to abide by the Re&s;ult. Upon which they &s;end to three Neighbouring Churches to come and a&s;&s;i&s;t them. Two of which came by their Delegates. They advi&s;ed Mr. <HI>Go&s;s</HI> to join in calling in a Council in common Form. But he refu&s;ed. And then brought out that he had negatived all the Votes of the Church, rela|tive to that Affair. Upon which &s;ome of the Brethren apply to him for a Copy of the Votes of &s;aid Meetings. When they came to have &s;aid Copy, they find &s;undry Votes there atte&s;ted to be pa&s;&s;ed and negatived by the Pa&s;tor, which never were pa&s;|&s;ed by the Church; as appeared, not only by the Memory of the Church; but by Minutes kept-by &s;everal in the Time of the Meetings.</P>
<P>They then &s;ent out for a Council of <HI>five</HI> Churches, who came; by who&s;e Per&s;wa&s;ion, Mr. <HI>Go&s;s</HI> agreed to &s;end out for a mutual Council according to common Form. Who were accordingly &s;ent for, and come <HI>June</HI> 11, 1771. This Re|&s;ult is very lengthy: but there &s;eems to be no Light held forth in it. And indeed it &s;eems the Council had no Light in them&s;elves; for in near or quite every Article, they &s;ay it don't <HI>appear,</HI> or is not <HI>&s;upported,</HI> notwith&s;tanding it is affirmed, that to many or mo&s;t of tho&s;e Articles there were &s;undry &s;ub|&s;tantial Witne&s;&s;es te&s;tified to them before the Council. And in &s;ome Articles it is a&s;&s;erted that the Council openly and ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to admit Evidence pre&s;ented to them by Members of the Church and Inhabitants of the Town, under a Notion of their being Parties in the Ca&s;e. The mo&s;t fa|vourable Con&s;truction I can think of, to put upon &s;uch Con|duct, is to compare it with Children, whom I have &s;een &s;ome Times at their Play, &s;hut their Eyes fa&s;t, and &s;ay they can't
<PB N="7" REF="012714_0006_0F8B8DA7C49775F8">&s;ee each other, when they are plain before them in Day Light. But I &s;hall in the third Part of this Work &s;hew that it is &s;omething wor&s;e than Children's Play. The Church &s;ay <HI>they cannot act like rational Creatures: much le&s;s like Chri&s;|tians to accept of it.</HI> The Church having for &s;ome time con&s;i|dered Mr. <HI>Go&s;s</HI> as having abdicated his Office, viz. ever &s;ince he di&s;&s;olved the Church Meeting, and refu&s;ed to call one again upon the Reque&s;t of a number of the Brethren. They de&s;ired two of the Brethren to warn every Brother of the Church to meet at the Meeting-Hou&s;e 22d of July, 1771. Which they, the &s;aid Brethren accordingly did, and the Meeting was attended; when they cho&s;e a Moderator and Clerk, and made the following Propo&s;al to Mr. <HI>Go&s;s,</HI> viz. Con&s;idering the Difficulties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, notwith&s;tanding all the Endeavors they had u&s;ed for an Accomodation; they propo&s;ed, that if he would take a Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, they would (with the Concurrance of the Town) leave the Matter of his Con|duct, re&s;pecting his Support, to the General Se&s;&s;ions of the Peace, to determine whether any Part or the Whole of &s;aid Contract &s;hould be paid him; all to be done without any Co&s;t to him. But he refu&s;ed to comply with &s;aid Propo&s;al. Then they de&s;ired him to make &s;ome Propo&s;al to them. And then the Meeting was adjourned to the 5th Day of Augu&s;t then next en&s;uing. But he made no Propo&s;al to them. When they met again they propo&s;ed to proceed to con&s;ider and act upon his Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion; or con&s;ider what was be&s;t to be done on the next Thur&s;day, to which Time they ad|journed, and informed him that if he &s;ee &s;it, he might attend. At which Time they again met, and after a Preamble &s;et|ing forth the State of Affairs among them, they by Vote declare, that he is di&s;charged from his Offices as Pa&s;tor and Teacher in that Church, and all the Power by them commit|ted to him entirely rever&s;ed. The &s;ame was al&s;o concurred by the Town in a legal Town-Meeting a&s;&s;embled for that Purpo&s;e. Since which the neighbouring Mini&s;ters have &s;tood aloof from &s;aid People, endeavoured to prevent their having the Go&s;pel preached to them; or enjoying common Commu|nion Privileges Abroad; and refu&s;e to take any Chri&s;tian or Con&s;titutional Mea&s;ures to convince them of any error. And Mr. <HI>Adams</HI>'s Sermon appeared to be de&s;igned to carry on the &s;ame Scheme; to which therefore I now proceed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<P>I come now to make &s;ome Remarks on Mr. <HI>Adams</HI>'s Ser|mon; which indeed by the general run of it, one would be led to &s;uppo&s;e, was delivered to the Body of the People in the Town; or at lea&s;t, if it was to a Minor Part of the People, to per&s;uade them to re-unite with the Body; for every one
<PB N="8" REF="012714_0007_0F8B8DA886058CB8">knows, that for Minor Parties to &s;et up by them&s;elves, in Se|paration from the Body, is the direct Way to crumble Bodies to Pieces, which certainly is directly contrary not only to <HI>Chri&s;tian Unity;</HI> but to all &s;ocial Exi&s;tence. But it &s;eems, not only by common Report: but by his own Words, that it was to a &s;mall Party of the Town, vid. Page 42. "Your Numbers not very large." And the drift of it is, to have them continue and per&s;i&s;t in their Separation. I &s;hall not make all the Remarks upon his Sermon, which appear to me might be made; le&s;t I &s;hould tire the Reader with pro|lixity. I &s;hall therefore omit making any particular Re|marks till I come to the 30th Page; where he tells about <HI>Con&s;tituted Judges</HI> between Mini&s;ters and People. <HI>The Peo|ple are not &s;uitable,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>becau&s;e they are a Party concerned.</HI> This to me founds very much of the Prudence and ingenuity of his <HI>Holine&s;s;</HI> who as I have under&s;tood, ro&s;e to his pre&s;ent Pitch of Infalibility; by fir&s;t very &s;peciou&s;ly propo&s;ing that the People were not fit to be Judges; who were proper for Bi&s;hops; that it would be more &s;afe to be in the Hands of the Clergy, &amp;c. But it &s;eems he had wholly lo&s;t Sight of our Con&s;titution; which according to Scripture, Platform, and many other Writers, makes the Church the &s;ole Judicature in all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Cau&s;es; which I &s;hall take occa&s;ion fur|ther to con&s;ider in the la&s;t Part of this Work. But it &s;eems he had not only lo&s;t Sight of the Con&s;titution; but even of common Sen&s;e. The Church in trying and judging &s;uch Cau&s;es, as are properly Eccle&s;ia&s;tical; are not judging their own Cau&s;e: but the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t. If any Brother in the Church &s;hould be drunk every Day, commit Fornication, Swear, profane the Sabbath, or any other &s;uch Immoralities that may be enumerated; it does not affect my Per&s;on or Property; i. e. it does not wound my Fle&s;h, or good Name, nor take one Farthing from my E&s;tate: neither in my judg|ing of him in the Church; and condemning him as guilty; and giving my Voice or Vote in his Cen&s;ure; put one Pen|ny into my own Pocket. If the Church were to lay a Fine upon an offending Brother for his Faults, and that Fine were to go into the Church Trea&s;ury, to defray nece&s;&s;ary Charges; then they would be intere&s;ted Per&s;ons, in their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Cau&s;es: Hence common Sen&s;e &s;hews, that what con&s;titutes intere&s;ted Per&s;ons, in any Cau&s;e, is their winning or loo&s;ing &s;omething in their Per&s;ons or Property, by the i&s;&s;ue of the Cau&s;e. But a Church cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ave one Penny by finding any Brother, and e&s;pecially a Mini&s;ter, guilty; for though by their finding him &s;o gro&s;sly guilty, as that they can no longer retain him, as their Pa&s;tor; yet this does not
<PB N="9" REF="012714_0008_0F8B8DAAA8E07658">&s;ave them the Co&s;t of &s;upporting the Go&s;pel: but rather in|crea&s;es their Charge, on that Account; &s;o that really, if any Way, they are intere&s;ted to judge in the Mini&s;ter's Favour. But it &s;eems Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> not only lo&s;t Sight of the Con&s;titu|tion and common Sen&s;e, but by turning over a Leaf, forgot <HI>him&s;elf.</HI> For after he had in the 30th and 31&s;t Pages, been very abundant, in &s;aying that the People were unfit to be Judges; that there mu&s;t be &s;ome con&s;tituted; and that the&s;e mu&s;t be an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Council, to <HI>judge</HI> and <HI>determine.</HI> Turn over to the 32d Page, and there he &s;ays that <Q>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Councils are only advi&s;ory; and that they can be no|thing el&s;e.</Q> But he &s;ays <Q>it does not hence follow as &s;ome would have it,&mdash;that we are at liberty to admit or di&s;card them, according as they agree or di&s;agree with our own corrupt Wills and Tempers.</Q></P>
<P>Who it is (as he tells of) that <HI>would have it,</HI> that they are at liberty, to act according to their own corrupt Wills and Tempers, again&s;t Advice or according to Advice, or even if they had no Advice in the Ca&s;e, I mu&s;t confe&s;s my &s;elf at a Lo&s;s; unle&s;s he &s;pake for him&s;elf, what he <HI>would have.</HI> The People he would be thought to aim at, I am per&s;waded would not one of them, pretend or allow, that they <HI>would have</HI> any &s;uch thing, as that they had any Li|berty to act according to their own corrupt Wills and Tem|pers, in any Ca&s;e, or under any Circum&s;tances whatever. The &s;ame might be ob&s;erved, on what he &s;ays in the next, viz. 33d Page, about the be&s;t Advice, and the mo&s;t con&s;en|taneous to Rea&s;on and Scripture, and the Re&s;ult of Coun|cils ever &s;o Rational, being di&s;regarded and rejected; I pre|&s;ume none of tho&s;e he aimed at, will allow <Q>that they hold to any &s;uch Thing.</Q> And therefore he mu&s;t take it to him|&s;elf, &s;ince he has ventured to affirm there are &s;uch Opinions held to. In the beginning of the next, viz. 34th Page, Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> undetakes to quote &s;omething out of the Platform, but he had the unhappine&s;s, to mi&s;s an e&s;&s;ential Part of the Sect. he pretended to tran&s;cribe, viz. Chap. XVI. Sect. 5. I need not tran&s;cribe the whole Sect.; every one ought to have the Platform, to turn to; I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that the &s;en&s;e of that Sect. as it &s;tands in the Platform is, that the <HI>principal Ground of the Reverence and Submi&s;&s;ion, due to the Re&s;ults of Councils, is their agreeing with the Word of God; without which they bind not at all.</HI> Now this of their <HI>not binding at all,</HI> without that Agreement, is omitted in Mr. <HI>Adams</HI>'s Sermon; hence then according to the Section Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> him&s;elf, has pretended to quote; if a Re&s;ult of a
<PB N="10" REF="012714_0009_0F8B8DAACD5E5530">Council, don't appear to agree with the Word of God, there is no binding Force in it at all, and therefore, the People he is endeavoring to fling &s;o much Blame upon, are entirely exculpated, for their not going according to the Re&s;ult of the Council, who&s;e <HI>Conduct</HI> in their Rea&s;ons for not accepting the Re&s;ult, they declare to be <HI>above their Comprehen&s;ion;</HI> and that they <HI>have Rea&s;on to believe the Council falible.</HI> Hence the Re&s;ult did not appear to be according to the Word of God, and therefore had no bind|ing Force at all in it. I need not &s;ay any more upon this Page, having &s;hewn that his Premi&s;es are Fal&s;e; his Con|clu&s;ion is no doubt Fal&s;e too. In the beginning of the next, viz. 35th Page; he has another clau&s;e out of the Platform which he takes from Chap. X. Sect. 6. In this quotation, though he has tran&s;cribed the Words right; yet I appre|hend he has wre&s;ted the meaning of them, in what he &s;ays upon them; for where the Platform &s;peaks of the Church having Power, according to <HI>Order,</HI> to remove an offending Elder from Office: This Word <HI>Order</HI> he improves, as if it were to mean, a Mandate from the Council; as &s;ome Au|thority Superior to the Church; for he &s;ays, <HI>this Order mu&s;t be the Council of other Churches where it may be had directing thereto.</HI> But as Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> him&s;elf anon &s;ays, in all Writ|ings, one Pa&s;&s;age mu&s;t be explained by another; and the latter mu&s;t always controul, interpret and determine, the meaning of the former: So this mu&s;t be determined by that Section, we have above con&s;idered; which is &s;everal Chapters after this, viz. the XVIth, and this but the Xth; &amp; e&s;pecially, that ought to controul the meaning of this Pa&s;|face, as to what is &s;aid about Councils; &s;ince that Chapter is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, upon the Head of Councils or Synods: and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> whole Scheme of the Platform appears to be very contrary to the &s;etting up Councils, as having any mandatory Authority over Churches; yea, and Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> him&s;elf as before hinted; &s;ays that Councils are, and can be nothing el&s;e only advi&s;ory; hence then according to the Platform, and Mr. <HI>Adams</HI>'s own declared Opinion, he has made a wrong Con&s;truction upon this Pa&s;&s;age in the Xth Chap. And I rather think that what was meant, by the Church having Power according to Order, to di&s;mi&s;s from Office, was to keep up the &s;ame Idea or Notion, that is expre&s;&s;ed in Chap. VIII. Sect. 7; &s;aying, that <Q>if the Church have Power to choo&s;e their Officers and Mini&s;ters; then in ca&s;e of manife&s;t un|worthine&s;s and delinquency, they have Power al&s;o to de|po&s;e them; for to open and &s;hut, to choo&s;e and refu&s;e &amp;c. are Acts belonging to the &s;ame Power,</Q> which &s;hews
<PB N="11" REF="012714_0010_0F8B8DAB83B5BCD0">that their Notion of <HI>Order</HI> was a Fitne&s;s, Propriety, and Con&s;i&s;tency in any thing to be done. So when they had ex|pre&s;&s;ed their Sen&s;e or Notion of <HI>Order</HI> or Fitne&s;s, as in the above quoted Sect. VIIIth Chapter, and again to the &s;ame Effect in this Xth Chapter, &s;aying, that <Q>it being natural to all Bodies, and &s;o unto a Church Body, to be furni&s;hed with &s;ufficient Power for its own Pre&s;ervation:</Q> And as they had &s;aid in the Vth Chapter, <HI>that even the Power of Office is in the Church, in that they de&s;ign the Per&s;ons unto Office.</HI>&mdash; When they had expre&s;&s;ed all the&s;e Things of <HI>Order,</HI> or the Nature of a Church; when they come to mention the Affair of removing an Officer from his Office; they &s;ay, that ac|cording to <HI>Order,</HI> they that had Power to call to Office, have Power to remove him from his Office; and this <HI>Order</HI> or Fit|ne&s;s, they had repeatedly and abundantly expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e foregoing Pa&s;&s;ages I have mentioned; and in&s;tead of repeat|ing all the&s;e Principles over again in this Place, they &s;um them up in this one general Term <HI>Order;</HI> and &s;ay accord|ing to that the Church has &s;uch a Power; as is very com|mon with &s;ome now a days, to &s;ay according to the <HI>Nature of Things;</HI> meaning do doubt, the &s;ame Things as the Com|pilers of the Platform did by &s;aying <HI>according to Order,</HI> as they do in this Place. And it appears to me as great a Violence to Words, to con&s;true them as Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> does in this Place; as if one &s;hould &s;ay, that every Creature has a Power of Self-Pre&s;ervation, and that a Man according to this Principle has Power, when he is informed of an Enemy, to u&s;e Means to &s;ecure him&s;elf: And Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> &s;hould argue thus upon it, that the Man's Power &s;o to pre&s;erve him&s;elf, con&s;i&s;ted in his being informed or directed to take Care of him&s;elf. But if I &s;ee an Enemy and nobody el&s;e &s;ees; mu&s;t I therefore &s;tand &s;till and be killed, and not exerci&s;e this Power of Self-Pre&s;ervation? Why no &s;ays Mr. <HI>Adams;</HI> if you do run at all, it mu&s;t be according to <HI>Order:</HI> You mu&s;t have <HI>Orders</HI> from &s;ome of your Neighbours to run, before you &s;tir, or it will be no E&s;cape at all. Indeed if there be no body to tell me to E&s;cape, then he allows that I have a Power to E&s;cape without this <HI>Order</HI> or <HI>Mandate,</HI> as he &s;eems to con&s;ider it. The Que&s;tion is, Where the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, and in the Ca&s;e before us, where the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> from Of|fice lies; and that, according <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, if there be any meaning to Words, is in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">; as abundantly ap|pears from what has been &s;aid; and what might farther be &s;aid if there was need of it; and e&s;pecially if we only con&s;i|der, that the Platform holds forth, that the Power of Office is in the Church; that the Power of Self-Pre&s;ervation is na|tural
<PB N="12" REF="012714_0011_0F8B8DACB21BD1E0">or e&s;&s;ential to the Being of Churches: And in another Place, that Councils or Synods are not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Being of Churches. This &s;hews that the Platform has no Notion of the Re&s;ults of Councils putting a validity upon the Acts of the Church: but on the contrary, that the Platform &s;hews that the Acts of the Church may put a vali|dity upon the Re&s;ults of Councils; as is very plain to be &s;een in &s;undry Places; and indeed &s;eems to be the whole drift of the Platform, wherever Councils or Synods are mentioned.&mdash; As to what Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> &s;ays in the remainder of this 35th Page about a People di&s;mi&s;&s;ing a Mini&s;ter contrary to the repeated Advice of Councils, where it cannot be pretended that he offends incorrigibly, enquiring what we &s;hall think of a People that do &s;o, &amp;c.? I am content he &s;hould think of it as he plea&s;es, &s;ince it is well known, it is nothing to the Ca&s;e of <HI>Bolton,</HI> which he &s;et him&s;elf to animadvert upon; for it is very manife&s;t, that they abundantly pretend, that their Elder offended incorrigibly, as appears by the forego|ing Narrative.&mdash;In the next, viz. 36th Page, Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> undertakes farther to illu&s;trate and confirm what he has &s;aid again&s;t the Power of People to di&s;mi&s;s their Mini&s;ter with|out the Advice of Council, by referring to the la&s;t Section of the Xth Chapter, where the Platform &s;peaks of <HI>an organic Church and right Admini&s;tration, that no Church Act can be con&s;ummated or perfected without the Con&s;ent of both.</HI> Now how this can prove or argue any thing for what he has &s;aid about Councils, appears to me my&s;terious; for according to his Con&s;truction of this Pa&s;&s;age, if they had ever &s;o many Councils, and advi&s;ed to the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the Mini&s;ter; yet if he &s;hould plea&s;e not to con&s;ent to it, it would all be to no Purpo&s;e. But his Con&s;truction of this Section appears to be a very great Violence to the general Sen&s;e of the Platform: for every one that has at all acquainted him&s;elf with that Book, mu&s;t know, that the Notion of an organic Church, according to that, is one that has ruling Elders, di&s;tinct from the Mini&s;ter; and all along in this &s;ame Chapter &s;peaks of the Church as having a plurality of Elders. But Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> &s;ays this <HI>Both</HI> &s;poken of in the Platform, is Mini&s;ters and People; when it is plain to any one that will read it, that the Platform means Elders and Brotherhood. For fear of being too lengthy, I &s;hall omit &s;aying all upon this Place, that I think it might de&s;erve; yet I can't pa&s;s it over with|out remarking one Thing more. In this Place Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> &s;ays, with a wonderful Air of A&s;&s;urance, <Q>How ab&s;urd is it to pretend that the Compilers of this Book meant to give the People a Power to di&s;ini&s;s their Pa&s;tors, when it ex|pre&s;sly
<PB N="13" REF="012714_0012_0F8B8DAD2F4B0A58">&s;ays, that no Church Act can be valid or perfect without the Con&s;ent of both, that is, Mini&s;ter and Peo|ple.</Q> And in the preceeding Page he had &s;aid, that if a Church was troubled with an incorrigibly offending Elder, and they could procure no Council to judge upon the Mat|ter; whether by his refu&s;ing to join with them, or other|wi&s;e the Platform and common Sen&s;e will ju&s;tify them in di&s;|mi&s;&s;ing him: but now unle&s;s he joins with them the Plat|form can't ju&s;tify them in any Act they &s;hall pretend to do. How ab&s;urd then, has he in this Page called what he &s;aid in the preceeding Page! This is the &s;econd Time we have found Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> forgetting him&s;elf, or loo&s;ing Sight of his own Words by turning over a Leaf. I proceed to make &s;ome Remarks upon what he &s;ays in the 37th Page, where he &s;peaks of the Churches pretending to di&s;mi&s;s their Elders, contrary to what he had been holding forth, as a <HI>new and up&s;tart Practice,</HI> which he &s;ays is &s;uch an one, <HI>as ju&s;tly</HI> a|larms, <HI>e&s;pecially as the Authors of it endeavor to make other Churches put a Sanction on their Conduct,</HI> &amp;c. How other Churches voting Charity with a certain Church, is a putting a Sanction upon what they have done; is not perhaps very ea&s;y for every one to &s;ee; neither do I &s;ee any need that one Church has to put a Sanction upon the Acts of another, I know there is need of Churches putting a Sanction upon the Re&s;ults of Councils, to make them of any avail, viz. Plat|form Chapter XV. Section 2; and no doubt the Me&s;&s;engers of Churches whenever they have been to any Council, ought to make return of what they have done to their Churches that &s;ent them, in Order for their Approbation; and it ought not to be con&s;idered as the Advice of tho&s;e. Si&s;ter Churches, till the re&s;pective Churches have approved of it; and if the re&s;pective Churches do not approve of the Re&s;ult, the Church which it mo&s;t e&s;pecially concerns, cannot with any Propriety be con&s;idered as going contrary to her Si&s;ter Churches, or breaking Fellow&s;hip with them in any Sen&s;e or Degree, till tho&s;e Si&s;ter Churches have approved of what that particular Church has rejected; and this, viz. the keeping up and maintaing the Communion and Fellow&s;hip of Churches ap|pears to be one great and &s;pecial Thing in view, in the having the Advice of Si&s;ter Churches, viz. Platform Chap|ter VIII. Section 8. But more of the End, De&s;ign, and Con|&s;equence of Councils in the la&s;t Part of this Work. To re|turn to what I was upon, Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> &s;eems in this Place greatly to blame <HI>Bolton,</HI> for applying to Si&s;ter Churches to know whether they were in Charity with them, and this appears the &s;ame, as to blame them for not turning ab&s;olute
<PB N="14" REF="012714_0013_0F8B8DAF635C8550"><HI>Independents.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Bolton</HI> Church never would have had it come into their Thoughts, to have gone to try the Vote of neighbour Churches in that Affair, if the Mini|&s;ters had not &s;et up an <HI>Independency</HI> with that Church, and had entered into a written Combination to that Purpo&s;e, as was generally reported: and &s;ome of <HI>Bolton</HI> Church upon Application to them for the common Privilege of the Com|munion of Churches were ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, which confirm|ed the Scheme of <HI>Independency</HI> among the Mini&s;ters. <HI>Bolton</HI> People that were &s;o rejected by the neighbouring Mini&s;ters, defired them to deal with them in the 3d Way of Communion, but they would not do that. What &s;hould <HI>Bolton</HI> Church do, the Mini&s;ters round had become ab&s;olute <HI>Independents,</HI> they would neither admit <HI>Bolton</HI> Church to Privileges; nor u&s;e any Chri&s;tian or Con&s;titutional Mea&s;ures to endeavor to con|vince or reclaim them, as an offending Church: It appears it was high Time for <HI>Bolton</HI> Church to find out whether the neighbouring Churches were as much at odds with them, or as determinate <HI>Independents,</HI> as their Mini&s;ters. It certainly could not be to any good Purpo&s;e, for <HI>Bolton</HI> People to try to mend or alter any thing among them&s;elves, in order to be in fellow&s;hip with their Si&s;ter Churches; when they knew nothing but they &s;till continued in Fellow&s;hip with them; and by altering, they might fling them&s;elves out of Fellow|&s;hip, and e&s;pecially &s;o long as they were not con&s;cious them|&s;elves of being in an Error. If they had done any thing that was offen&s;ive, or grevious to their Si&s;ter Churches they ought to know it; and what Way &s;hould they come at this knowledge, but by trying whether the other Churches were in Charity with them, &s;o long as no one undertook to con|vince them of any thing bad? But only the Mini&s;ters &s;tood aloof from them, and treated them as if thy were not only not Chri&s;tians; but even in &s;ome Sen&s;e not human Creatures, viz. by endeavouring all they could to prevent their having the Go&s;pel preached to them. So that what &s;o greatly a|larms Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> is, that <HI>Bolton</HI> People don't turn <HI>Indepen|dents,</HI> but u&s;e Mea&s;ures contrary to &s;uch a Scheme. But let it be that <HI>Bolton</HI> Church have endeavoured to get other Churches to put a <HI>Sanction</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> What terri|ble Iniquity is there in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o offen&s;ive to Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> their Mini&s;ter without the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, or his a&s;king of it: is not he willing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;hould be on equal Foot|ing with the Mini&s;ters. I knew a Mini&s;ter once, who after he had been &s;ettled a few Years, began a Di&s;pute or Unea&s;i|ne&s;s with his People, for more Salary, and as I was told,
<PB N="15" REF="012714_0014_0F8B8DB000E3A170">without a Council, or a&s;king a Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of his People, at once preached a farewell Sermon to them, &s;o di&s;mi&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf; or rather abdicated his Office: and then got other Mi|ni&s;ters to put a <HI>Sanction</HI> upon his Conduct, by putting a Re|commendation of him into the public Prints. And why &s;hould a Church be thought &s;o bad, for endeavouring to have their Neighbours put a <HI>Sanction</HI> upon their conduct; when to to be &s;ure they no more than imitated that Mini&s;ter in his Conduct; which Conduct, the Mini&s;ters them&s;elves put a Sanction upon; and e&s;pecially, when I pre&s;ume Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> can't find in all the Platform any Thing to countenance the Conduct of that Mini&s;ter; &s;o much as he acknowledges in his 34th Page, he finds in the Platform to countenance or ju&s;tify the People in di&s;mi&s;&s;ing their Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> proceeds to &s;ay in the 37th Page,&mdash;<Q>If Things thus go on, what will become of the Con&s;titution of the Congregational Churches?</Q> He an&s;wers, <Q>It will &s;oon be wholly &s;ubverted, &amp;c. and Mini&s;ters will have nothing to depend upon but the fickle and incon&s;tant Breath of Mankind!</Q> And pray what have they now; or what did they u&s;e to have? Why truly Councils! ac|cording to Mr. <HI>Adams:</HI> He has all along been in&s;i&s;ting up|on this; for nothing is more plain and notorious, than that it is this new and <HI>up&s;tart Practice,</HI> which don't pay &s;o much Deference to Councils as he would have; is what he &s;ays will bring it to that, that Mini&s;ters will have nothing to depend upon but the incon&s;tant Breath of Mankind. What does he make of Councils! Are not they Mankind? This is out-doing his <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> him&s;elf; he never, as I know of, pretended that he was not of Mankind; though he pretends to be infallible. But it &s;eems by what Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> has advanced, he would have it be thought, that Councils are &s;omething &s;uperior to Mankind! or el&s;e why is this mighty exclamation, of hav|ing nothing to depend upon but Mankind, by Councils being neglected, unle&s;s Councils are &s;omething &s;uperior to Man|kind? Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> plainly makes a God of Councils, and he cries very much in the Language of Micah,&mdash;<HI>Yca have taken away my Gods, and what have I more?</HI> So Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI>&mdash;Ye have &s;et at naught Councils, and now I have nothing to depend upon but the fickle Breath of Mankind. I can't depend upon that God who has the Hearts of all Men in his Hand, and turneth them whither&s;oever he plea&s;eth.&mdash;<Q>Who (&s;ays Mr. <HI>Adams</HI>) that has common Sen&s;e and com|mon Prudence, will ever go into the Mini&s;try on the&s;e Terms? To have but a pitiful Sub&s;i&s;tence while the Re|lation continues, and be di&s;&s;olved at the Plea&s;ure of the
<PB N="16" REF="012714_0015_0F8B8DB2383BA528">People?</Q> Perhaps it may reflect Light upon this Pa&s;|&s;age, if we turn Tables and &s;ay, What People that have common Sen&s;e and common Prudence, will ever &s;ettle a Mini&s;ter upon the&s;e Terms? To have but pitiful preaching while the Relation continues; and to have the Mini&s;ters &s;oon after they have got their Settlement, go to contending about their Contract, or run into &s;ome &s;candalous Conduct, and however, go off when they plea&s;e; for in Ballance to the one In&s;tance Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> is &s;o alarmed at, I can bring a Cloud of In&s;tances on the other Side, where People have lo&s;t the whole Settlement they have given, for a very few Years (likely) pitiful preaching; either by the arbitrary, covetous, or corrupt <HI>Wills and Tempers</HI> of the Mini&s;ters.&mdash; The In&s;tance I have mentioned above, where the Mini&s;ter went off &s;o abruptly, was no doubt at lea&s;t Arbitrary.&mdash; Hear another In&s;tance, where the Mini&s;ter having a hand|&s;ome Settlement, and after he had been &s;ettled three or four Years, the People had been very generous to him, and he had got in a hand&s;ome Way to live; he began to contend with them about giving of him more, and &s;aid they had not fulfilled their original Contract, withal threatning to leave them. The People, as I under&s;tand, offered to leave it to Men with him; having the Arbitration con&s;i&s;t of half Mi|ni&s;ters. But no; he would have a Council to put a <HI>Sanction</HI> upon his Conduct, which he obtained, that an&s;wered his de&s;ires as I under&s;tand, and the Pari&s;h are in great danger of being ruined by it. Hear another In&s;tance &s;omething &s;imilar to the former, the Mini&s;ter indeed had been &s;ettled &s;ome longer, he complained that they had not fulfilled their Contract, they joined with him (as I under&s;tand) in calling a Council, who judged they had fulfilled their Contract: But &s;till he was unea&s;y, and left his People in <HI>Oppo&s;ition</HI> to the Re&s;ult of Council, as you may &s;ee, which is one Thing that Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> complains of in the People as being &s;o heinous and alarming. But the Mini&s;ters don't &s;cruple to put a <HI>Sanction upon his Conduct,</HI> by &s;etting him to preaching, and that people al&s;o, as I under&s;tand are almo&s;t ruined by it. But hear another In&s;tance. A Mini&s;ter was &s;ettled with a hand&s;ome Settlement, &amp; he was a very popular Preacher, but he traded and tra&s;licked in Hor&s;es and Land, making con&s;iderable Adventures in new Towns, and the like, by which he lo&s;t con&s;iderable, till by the Time he had been &s;ettled about &s;ix or &s;even Years, he was &s;o involved that he was ca&s;t into Pri&s;on for Debt; where he continued &s;ome Months; till he took the Benefit of the Bankrupt Act then in Being. The People to help him to live, and continue as their Mini&s;ter, tropo&s;ed to purcha&s;e a
<PB N="17" REF="012714_0016_0F8B8DB467888F48">&s;mall Farm near the Meeting-Hou&s;e, and let him live on it as a Par&s;onage; together with &s;ome very hand&s;ome Sub&s;crip|tions to help &s;et him up again: But no, he would not ac|cept of the Farm they propo&s;ed as a Par&s;onage unle&s;s they would give it him as his own. It was thought he had a Notion that he could get a new Settlement in &s;ome other Place if he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from them: but the People moved nothing about his Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, till he preached a very odd Sermon, as was thought on Purpo&s;e to &s;tart the People; the Subject and Scheme of his Sermon (as I under&s;tand) was to &s;et forth that <HI>the Godly are hereafter to dwell with devouring Fire, and everla&s;ting Burnings.</HI> Upon which the People were very ready to di&s;mi&s;s him. And he obtained a Council <HI>to put a Sanction upon his Conduct,</HI> &s;o that he &s;tood well recom|mended &s;till for the Mini&s;try. And I verily think Councils are too apt <HI>to put a Sanction</HI> on the Conduct of Mini&s;ters. One I knew who was complained of for Things very much bordering upon <HI>Sodomy,</HI> and &s;o much proved, that he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and yet the Council did not &s;cruple &s;o far <HI>to put a Sanction on his Conduct,</HI> that he &s;till preaches as I under|&s;tand. And if things go on &s;o, what &s;hall we think of Councils? Will any People of common Sen&s;e, Prudence or Chri&s;tianity, ever pretend to &s;end for any? And what will become of the Apo&s;tle's Direction, 1 Tim. III.? <HI>A Bi|&s;hop mu&s;t be blamele&s;s, &s;ober, of good Behaviour,</HI> &amp;c. In &s;hort, he <HI>mu&s;t have a good Report of them which are without,</HI> &amp;c. Almo&s;t numberle&s;s are the In&s;tances, too many to enume|rate, wherein Mini&s;ters by gro&s;s Immorality, &s;uch as Forni|cation, Adultry, lacivious Carriage, Intemperance, Fal&s;hood, and &s;uch like, evidently proved, within the Compa&s;s of ten or twelve Years after their &s;ettling, whereby the People have lo&s;t all the Co&s;t of &s;ettling. Some Towns or Pari&s;hes, near or quite ruined, di&s;couraged, &s;cattered, divided, torn and left (as we may &s;ay) half dead, or if not thus brought to the brink of Ruin; yet have all the Co&s;t and Trouble of &s;ettling over again. And are not all the&s;e Things as alarming as the one In&s;tance Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> tells of? if that was as really uncon&s;titutional as he would have it be thought. And &s;hall we therefore, as Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> on the Mini&s;ter's Part, concludes that no one of common Sen&s;e or common Prudence, will en|ter into the Mini&s;try: Shall we (I &s;ay) on the People's Part, conclude we will have no more Mini&s;ters? becau&s;e Things go on &s;o. By no means; this never will do to neglect a Du|ty becau&s;e bad Men make a had u&s;e of good Things. This World is a World of Tryal; and we mu&s;t guard again&s;t the
<PB N="18" REF="012714_0017_0F8B8DB48CDF0B40" MS="y">Evils of it as well as we can; and wherein we &s;ee, that we our&s;elves or others have mi&s;&s;ed, endeavor to mend in the be&s;t Manner we can. Let Mini&s;ters and People under&s;tand one another, how they &s;ettle, and how they mu&s;t part, if ever it &s;hould come to that extremity. Let Mini&s;ters have a fair Chance for living in the World, according to the Place they are in; and let the People have a fair Chance in their Con|tract as well as the Mini&s;ter; let them know before they &s;ettle, how they are to under&s;tand the Con&s;titution; and let not the People be affrighted for fear they &s;hall not be able to find Mini&s;ters to &s;ettle according to the Con&s;titution. Not|with&s;tanding all Mr. <HI>Adams</HI>'s exclamations, there is not half the ri&s;que on the Mini&s;ter's Side, that there is on the Peo|ple's Side; as Mini&s;ters generally &s;ettle in this Country. People are not apt to be fond of advancing a Thou&s;and or Ffteen Hundred Pounds, O. T. to &s;ettle a Mini&s;ter any of|tener than they can't help; they will bear with a great deal before they will turn away a Mini&s;ter, and bring the Co&s;t and Trouble of &s;ettling another upon them&s;elves; and when they have been at all that Co&s;t, they no doubt ought to enjoy the Benefit of it &s;o long as they can enjoy it; and when they can no longer enjoy it, what Rea&s;on can there be a&s;&s;igned, why they &s;hould be &s;addled with a Burden by a Council or any &s;et of Men whatever? Not that I would be under&s;tood to &s;ugge&s;t, that when a Mini&s;ter is pa&s;t his Labour, through Infirmity or Old Age, that the People &s;hould then &s;et him at nought; but &s;till to e&s;teem him highly in Love for his Work Sake, that he has done among them; and to continue him &s;ome hand&s;ome Allowance, as they &s;hall agree. But when his Conduct has been &s;uch toward them, that they can no longer have confidence in him as their Pa&s;tor; and &s;o they can no longor enjoy him as &s;uch; I &s;ee no Rea&s;on why they &s;hould &s;till be incumbered with him. <HI>To &s;erve one another in Love,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> has it in his Title Page, is the whole E&s;&s;ence of all Society, Civil and Religious; and when this Service cea&s;es through Default, the Nerves of the &s;ocial Body are cut, and the Di&s;&s;olution begins; and if the&s;e Nerves can't be healed, a Di&s;&s;olution mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily en&s;ue. And I am per&s;uaded Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> can't with all his Ingenuity, make out that in the Affair he has &s;aid &s;o much about, that the Mini&s;ter &s;erved the People in Love, when he negatived their Acts as he did, di&s;&s;olved the Church Meeting, di&s;pen|&s;ed with his own Promi&s;es, and many other Things as we have it in the Narrative. And it avails nothing for him to alledge that the&s;e Things were not made out to the Council; they were &s;o to the People, who by Nature and by Con&s;titu|tion
<PB N="19" REF="012714_0018_0F8B8DB5957C9C40">are the judges of the&s;e Things, notwith&s;tanding all he has &s;aid. There &s;eem to be &s;everal Things more that de|&s;erve Remark: but perhaps they may be &s;ufficiently expo|&s;ed by the few Hints already made, with &s;ome Hints refer|ing to Mr. <HI>Adams</HI>'s Piece, which will nece&s;&s;arily fall in, in the remaining Part of the Work. I &s;hall therefore dwell no longer on this Part of the Work.</P>
<P>JUST as I had fini&s;hed the above Remarks; before I had entered upon the remaining Part; I lie on a very pompous Account in the <HI>Bo&s;ton Evening Po&s;t,</HI> of <HI>December</HI> 28, 1772, of the Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of a Mini&s;ter at <HI>Grafton.</HI> As to the vain &s;hew there appeared in it, I could freely have let all pa&s;s with Neglect, if it had not carried with it, &s;uch a glaring In|&s;ult upon the Town; as if he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by a Council, and a &s;mall Part of the Church; in Oppo&s;ition to the Mind of the Town. I &s;hould have offered &s;omething to the Pub|lic through the &s;ame Channel; but as it would have been &s;o long after, that it would &s;eem to have been out of Date; and as it appeared to be &s;o exactly of the Nature of what I am here oppo&s;ing; I thought it would not be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, to take &s;ome Notice of it here, and might well &s;tand, for one among the In&s;tances, where Mini&s;ters have gone off with their Settlement, to the Damage of the Town. How long indeed, that Gentleman had been &s;ettled I can't &s;ay: be that as it will, it is notorious by what is publi&s;hed, that he is an Expectant of further employ in the Service; for the Piece is plainly an Adverti&s;ement of him, for an ho|nourable Acceptance and Employ, con&s;idering he had &s;uch an <HI>Honourable Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.</HI> However I cannot look upon &s;uch a Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion very honourable. It does not appear, that it was done by a Major Vote, even of the Church.</P>
<P>The Adverti&s;er &s;ays it was <Q>by a Major Vote of the Bre|thren of the Church pre&s;ent.</Q> Not that there was any Church Meeting notified for that Purpo&s;e; or indeed any Church Meeting at all. And whether a Quarter of the Church were <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> does not appear; and by the Town's not concurring, it is mo&s;t probable the generality of the Peo|ple did not like what was going forward; and therefore would not <HI>honour</HI> them with their Pre&s;ence; and &s;o perhaps there might, for In&s;tance 7 of the Church come out of Curi|o&s;ity, to &s;ee the Proceedings of the Council; and 4 of them Vote this <HI>Honourable Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion,</HI> which <HI>with &s;trong Rea&s;ons pre&s;&s;ed, and with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;truggles, at length he obtained, Whereupon his pa&s;toral <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> to be di&s;&s;olved, in the pre&s;ence of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"></HI> he Council might put a <HI>Sanction</HI> upon it; at lea&s;t it is &s;poken,
<PB N="20" REF="012714_0019_0F8B8DB6096AB4A0">of with that Air, as though their Pre&s;ence put a <HI>Sanction</HI> that would abide, maugre the Di&s;&s;ent of the Town. This is of the &s;ame Scheme, Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> is &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly con|tending for; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> if Towns and Churches were all <HI>Non Compos Mentis,</HI> and mu&s;t have Councils for their Guardians, to make, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, or di&s;&s;olve Contracts for them. Here is a plain Pretence of a Council's di&s;&s;olving the Contract of <HI>Grafton</HI> Innabitants, even again&s;t their Wills. Which can be upon no other Principle, than that the Town are <HI>Non Compos Mentis,</HI> and the Council for&s;ooth are their Guardians.</P>
<P>This is a more glaring In&s;ult upon the Common Rights of Mankind, than the <HI>Stamp Act</HI> it &s;elf, or all the <HI>Duty Acts,</HI> &s;o much complained of; for any &s;et of Men, to pre|tend to di&s;&s;olve a Contract, between Man and Man, without the Con&s;ent of the Parties; and thus to bring on the Town a Bill of Co&s;t, &s;o great as the Settlement of another Mini|&s;ter. It appears to me that &s;uch a Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion can no Way be reconciled, to the common Rights of Mankind; nor the Mini&s;ter &s;aid to be &s;o di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, look upon him&s;elf, di&s;|charged from his Contract with that Town; unle&s;s he lend to the Town Money for a &s;ufficient Settlement of another, to remain with them for that U&s;e, &s;o long as he is able to di&s;charge the Work of the Mini&s;try; or the Town is wil|ling to relea&s;e him of his Contract. And I &s;hould think the Town had a good Right in Law for an Action of Dam|ages again&s;t him for that Purpo&s;e. But here, le&s;t my An|tagoni&s;ts &s;hould &s;ay that if a Mini&s;ter can't di&s;mi&s;s him&s;elf, when he plea&s;es, without violating the Rights of Mankind, unle&s;s the other Party of the Contract agree to di&s;&s;olve it; then how can the Church and Town di&s;&s;olve it, unle&s;s the Mini&s;ter agree to it? To this it may be an&s;wered. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that the Ca&s;e is widely different between the Town and the Mini&s;ter, in this Affair. For the Mini&s;ter in going off, while he is able to carry on the Work, puts Money into his own Pocket. But the Town by di&s;mi&s;&s;ing of him, bring on them&s;elves a Bill of Co&s;t, in the &s;ettling of another. So that the Ca&s;e is altogether different, the one judging Money into one's own Pocket, the other judging of it out.</P>
<P>Hence the Con&s;titution, by the Plat. as we have con&s;idered, very wi&s;ely fixed the Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of a Mini&s;ter with the Peo|ple; who not only were to enjoy their Service: but with whom there was &s;o great a Ballance, again&s;t judging ra&s;hly for a di&s;&s;olution of the Relation. Yea if there were no <HI>Set|tlement</HI> to pay, as is the Ca&s;e in Places where there is an adequate Par&s;onage; yet the Ri&s;que. Trouble and Divi&s;ion,
<PB N="21" REF="012714_0020_0F8B8DB6C4DCF6F0">which it generally expo&s;es a Town or Pari&s;h to, to &s;ettle a new Mini&s;ter, is a very great Ballance again&s;t their ra&s;hly or &s;uddenly di&s;&s;olving the Relation.</P>
<P>But the Con&s;titution fixing it in the Power and Rights of the People, to di&s;mi&s;s upon Delinquency; makes it that they are not to be con&s;idered, as one Side di&s;&s;olving the Con|tract, &s;ince he who &s;ettles upon the Con&s;titution, &s;uch a Di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion is implied in the Contract, and this makes an Agree|ment upon his Side, that the Contract &s;hall &s;o be di&s;&s;olved. But then, here is to be ob&s;erved a di&s;tinction between di&s;|mi&s;&s;ing for Delinquency, and for Infirmity; for if a Mini&s;ter by Infirmity, Old Age, or otherwi&s;e, &s;hould become unable to fulfill his Office; and the People &s;hould be &s;o unrea&s;onable, as to di&s;mi&s;s him in order to get rid of a Burthen; this would by no means be rea&s;onable or con&s;titutional, for this would be expre&s;sly judging Money into their own Pocket; and there might ju&s;tly be a doubt, whether &s;uch Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion were valid, the Con&s;titution making no Provi&s;ion for di&s;mi&s;|&s;ing upon Infirmity: But if they conclude it to be a valid Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion; yet by the Circum&s;tances, they &s;o judging Money into their own Pur&s;e; they ought in Ju&s;tice to leave it to indifferent Men, what Allowance they &s;hould &s;till make him; for it would be unju&s;t, when a Mini&s;ter had &s;pent all his Strength, with a People in their Service, to &s;et him at nought when he was pa&s;t Labour, and afford him no Help when he mo&s;t needed it. But it appears mo&s;t according to Rea&s;on and the Con&s;titution in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, not to pretend to di&s;mi&s;s him: but for them to come to an amicable Agree|ment, to allow him &s;ome hand&s;ome Con&s;ideration during Life. And this I think has been the Practice &s;o far as I have been acquainted. But in all the&s;e Things, all Ra&s;h|ne&s;s &s;hould be avoided, and Mini&s;ters and People both, &s;hould treat each other with Candour and Moderation. Peo|ple &s;hould not di&s;mi&s;s their Mini&s;ters &s;uddenly, whether it be with or without a Council; nor Mini&s;ters think to run off, when they plea&s;e; or even if they have the Advice of a Council. For if Councils (where the leading Part are generally Mi|ni&s;ters) may di&s;mi&s;s a Mini&s;ter when they plea&s;e; and all be looked upon well or honourable, as it is in the Adverti&s;e|ment; they have the greate&s;t Temptation of &s;ecular Intere&s;t to do &s;uch an honourable Jobb one for another. And this leads into all Manner of Confu&s;ion and Inju&s;tice: from which may appear, how far Councils (as they are generally managed) are from being proper Judges; as Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> tells of. Not that I am for throwing them away: But
<PB N="22" REF="012714_0021_0F8B8DB8F1769518">would have them keep within their own Sphere. Which I &s;hall now proceed to con&s;ider what it is.</P>
<P>I come now to &s;peak &s;omething e&s;pecially as to COUN|CILS; their <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s, Authority</HI> and <HI>U&s;e,</HI> as they &s;tand in Relation to CHURCHES and the Power of Churches, in all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs. COUNCILS, as Things are got to in this Country among Congregational Churches, may be divi|ded into three Sorts. viz. Party-Councils, Mutual-Councils, and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical-Councils. I know they all affect the Name of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical; but I conceive, it is only to take away their Reproach; for after all, they reckon their Right or Authority according as they are either <HI>Party</HI> or <HI>Mutual.</HI> But I am ready to gue&s;s, that the&s;e Notions of <HI>Party</HI> and <HI>Mutual Coun|cils</HI> are <HI>new and up&s;tart Practices</HI> (as Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> &s;peaks of <HI>Bolton</HI> Affair, P. 37) which our forefathers he &s;peaks of, had no Idea or Notion of. I have read &s;everal ancient Books upon the&s;e Things, and I don't now recollect reading of any &s;uch thing in any ancient Writer; to be &s;ure I think there is no mention made of them in the Scripture or Platform, on which in Conjunction, Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> him&s;elf, &s;ays <HI>we have founded the Order and Di&s;cipline of the Congregational Chur|ches.</HI> I &s;hall therefore take it for granted, that <HI>Party</HI> and <HI>Mutual-Councils</HI> are <HI>up&s;tart</HI> Things, which our Con&s;titution knows nothing about; and therefore we are not to &s;eek af|ter their Authority or Bu&s;ine&s;s; and indeed if we were to enquire into what they generally a&s;&s;ume (according to what Opportunity I have had) we &s;hould find it as much unknown to tho&s;e two Fundamental Books as their Names. <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;|tical Councils</HI> then are the only Sort we have to enquire a|bout. Which to define or de&s;cribe, is when a Church &s;ends out to Si&s;ter Churches for their Advice or A&s;&s;i&s;tance in any Weighty or Important Affair. I &s;uppo&s;e the certaine&s;t Way to find what a proper Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Council is, is to look in|to the Scriptures and to examine the original Pattern which we find in the XVth of Acts; there it appears, the Church at <HI>Antioch</HI> &s;ent to the Apo&s;tles and Elders at <HI>Jeru&s;alam</HI> about the Que&s;tion of circumci&s;ing the Gentiles; and by their &s;ending to the Apo&s;tles and Elders, it was communicated to the whole <HI>Church,</HI> who had a Voice in the Council, vid. 22d 23d Ver&s;es, &s;o that an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Council, is a Collection of Churches met together, to con&s;ult about religious Affairs, and to advi&s;e any particular Church or Churches in general, what they ought to do in in certain Ca&s;es. But it is not &s;o material how the&s;e Churches come together, if they do but keep within their own proper Sphere; and do the Bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="23" REF="012714_0022_0F8B8DB917D24FF8">of an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Council, when they are met; only this general Rule, that all things &s;hould be done decently and in in order. The &s;pecial Thing to enquire after is, what is their Bu&s;ine&s;s, U&s;e and extent. The Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Council is in my Apprehen&s;ion, very ju&s;tly delineated in Platform, Chapter XVI, Section 4, which I need not repeat: It be|ing in &s;hort to clear from the Word of God, Points of Faith, Con&s;cience, Wor&s;hip and Di&s;cipline, and to bear Witne&s;s a|gain&s;t Male-Admini&s;tration and Corruption in Doctrine or Manners in any Church, and to point out the Way to reform them: thus far the po&s;itive Part of that Section: which to me appears very agreable to the original Pattern in Acts. The Bu&s;ine&s;s of Councils, namely, is to clear up and &s;et Light before the Churches, and then Councils have no further that they ought to do: hence the negative Part of the fore|going Section. They are not to exerci&s;e Church Cen&s;ures in any Way of Di&s;cipline, nor any other act of Church Authority or Juri&s;diction. Here it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, how repugnant to the Platform Mr. <HI>Adams</HI>'s Notion of judiciary Authority in Councils is, and al&s;o how repugnant to the Platform it is, for Councils to &s;et up, as though they were &s;ome &s;uperior Court of Judicature; that they won't receive Te&s;timonies from the Church, becau&s;e for&s;ooth they &s;ay the Church are Witne&s;&s;es in their own Ca&s;e. The Church are the Judges, according to the Con&s;titution; and Councils only Advi&s;ers according to Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> him&s;elf. And I could produce a Cloud of Authorities for this, if there were any need of it: but this will appear quite needle&s;s &s;ince the Champion him|&s;elf has a&s;&s;erted it. Hence this is not the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Council, to have Facts proved to them as a Court. The Council in Acts, did not &s;tand rumaging Evidence, about the certainty of their having been judaizing Teachers at <HI>Antioch;</HI> nor frump <HI>Paul, Barnabas,</HI> and the others, that they were Witne&s;&s;es in their own Ca&s;e; and &s;o draw up their Re&s;ult, that it was not proved, that any had been teaching of them, that they mu&s;t be circumcized, &amp;c. and &s;o with a mighty &s;olemn Air tell what Plea&s;ure they had to find, that there was no Divi&s;ion or Di&s;&s;ention of Opinion in the Church at <HI>Antioch,</HI> and &s;o advi&s;e <HI>Paul, Barnabas</HI> and the others, to go and be quiet, and be careful not to take up &s;uch Surmizes and Jealou&s;ies. If the Council at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> had done &s;o; in my Opinion the Re&s;ult at <HI>Bolton,</HI> 11th of <HI>June,</HI> 1771, would have had an ample Pattern. But far from this. The Council at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> took the Account as they had it of the Me&s;&s;engers, that came from <HI>An|tioch;</HI> and advi&s;ed what to do in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, as was laid be|fore
<PB N="24" REF="012714_0023_0F8B8DB9BA420448">them. What was it to them, whether the Facts were proved again&s;t the Parties: they were not about to lay un|der Cen&s;ure either Part; but to advi&s;e what was right to be done in the Ca&s;e, as the Church had &s;ent it to them. The Church at <HI>Antioch,</HI> nor any other Church, ever wanted to a&s;k a Council as to Facts, whether there are &s;uch and &s;uch Facts, as the Church them&s;elves are per&s;onally knowing to. Thus the Church at <HI>Antioch</HI> did not want to a&s;k the Council at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> whether there had been judaizing Teachers at <HI>Antioch;</HI> neither did the Church at <HI>Bolton</HI> want to a&s;k the Council, whether Mr. <HI>Go&s;s</HI> had done certain Things, which the Church them&s;elves were Eye and Ear Witne&s;&s;es to. It would be a mo&s;t &s;hocking Affront to common Sen&s;e; to &s;et about any &s;uch Thing. To make this Matter familiar. Sup|po&s;e I have a Piece of Ground, that has been tilled a long Time, and is become very weedy, and dog Gra&s;s has got in, that won't die, do almo&s;t what you will to it; and I &s;hould have a mind to a&s;k the Advice of my Neighbours, what I had be&s;t to do with it; whether I had not better throw it down. And my Neighbours &s;hould tell me, you are a Witne&s;s in your own Ca&s;e, and therefore it don't appear, or is not proved that you have &s;uch a Piece of Ground, and &s;o we advi&s;e you to go, and improve your Ground as u&s;ual, and &s;eek Profit from it, &amp;c. with all that Gravity and &s;o|lemnity which we find in the <HI>June</HI> Re&s;ult. Would it not be wor&s;e than ridiculous? I did not want to have my Neigh|bours to come, to tell whether I had &s;uch a Piece of Ground, but to advi&s;e what was be&s;t to do, with &s;uch kind of Ground. And &s;o a Church don't want a Council to tell them whether they &s;ee one of their Brethren drunk, or hear him u&s;e pro|fane Language, or tell Things that be not true; tell one Story one Time, a contrary one another Time, promi&s;es Things and never fulfills his Promi&s;e. When they &s;ee or hear the&s;e Things, they know them better than a Council can tell them: but if they mu&s;t have a Council to tell them the&s;e Facts, before they can properly know them to act upon; then they mu&s;t have another Council, to certify them that the fir&s;t Council told them &s;o; and a third for the &s;econd; and &s;o on, <HI>ad infinitum.</HI> And indeed this is very much the Way that Things are managed now a Days; one Council leads on to another; anothor to a third; a third to a fourth; and there is no End, till the People are either de&s;troyed, or &s;cat|tered, or worried out, and give up to let every Thing go as it will; or re&s;olutely take up their Rights and a done with Councils. By what is laid down, of the nece&s;&s;ary Lead and Con&s;equence, of Councils pretending to enter into the Tryal
<PB N="25" REF="012714_0024_0F8B8DBAC5422548">of Matters of Fact, and act as Judicatories upon Facts, and by what appears in Fact, as Councils are generally managed, every one mu&s;t &s;ee, what an endle&s;s and fruitle&s;s Labyrinth it leads into. From all which appears, that the Pattern laid down in Acts, is exactly con&s;i&s;tent with Rea&s;on; that the Councils Bu&s;ine&s;s, is to advi&s;e the Church what they had be&s;t to do upon the Ca&s;e; as the Church &s;tates the Facts be|fore them. Hence another Thing to be ob&s;erved, which is not &s;o well attended to now a Days as it ought; and that is, that all Matters &s;hould have a Hearing in the Church, be|fore they can be proper to be laid before a Council; or the Church cannot &s;tate the Facts to be advi&s;ed upon; as the Church at <HI>Antioch</HI> di&s;puted the Matters at Home, before they &s;ent them to the Council at <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>
<P>Having con&s;idered what the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Councils is, and what is not, I now come to con&s;ider what their Authority is, or wherein it con&s;i&s;ts: For which again we may &s;ee the a|fore&s;aid XVIth Chapter of the Platform, Section 5; which &s;hews that it con&s;i&s;ts, in their Re&s;ults being agreeable to the <HI>Word of God; without which they bind not at all.</HI> Here we have the Authority or binding Force &s;et forth negatively and pofitively: From which, it is plain to &s;ee that their Au|thority or binding Force, does not con&s;i&s;t in their being a Council, or in their being <HI>Mutual</HI> as it is called. Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> and many others, lay great &s;tre&s;s upon what they call <HI>Mutual</HI> Councils, as though there were &s;ome &s;pecial Authority at lea&s;t in them; let them re&s;ult almo&s;t what they will. Ma|ny Things might be &s;aid, to &s;hew the ab&s;urdity and child|i&s;hne&s;s of &s;uch a Notion: but for fear I &s;hall be too lengthy, and con&s;idering the Scripture and Platform place the Autho|rity and binding Force of Councils, in another Quarter, I &s;hall take that as &s;ufficient to &s;tand in Oppo&s;ition to Mr. <HI>Adams</HI>'s Notion; and proceed to con&s;ider wherein the Au|thority or binding Force of Councils con&s;i&s;ts according to Scripture. For which Purpo&s;e, we mu&s;t confider what they did, and e&s;pecially their <HI>Re&s;ult,</HI> which the Platform &s;ays mu&s;t be agreable to the Word of God, or it binds not at all. Hence &s;ee the Re&s;ult of the <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> Council, Acts XV, which begins thus, Ver&s;e 28. IT SEEMED GOOD TO THE HOLY GHOST, <HI>and to us;</HI> i. e. according to the Word of God, and human Rea&s;on; for the <HI>Word of God</HI> is indited by the Holy Gho&s;t. Hence &s;uch Re&s;ults as are evidently con&s;onant with the Word of God, SEEMED GOOD TO THE HOLY GHOST. All Re&s;ults that don't &s;tand with that Au|thority
<PB N="26" REF="012714_0025_0F8B8DBB39487590">at their Head, are of no Authority or Obligation to be regarded; even as any Civil In&s;trument that is not <HI>in his Maje&s;ty's Name,</HI> is of no Force. Councils have no more Right to go according to their corrupt Wills and Tempers, than the People. Hence it won't mend the Matter, for Councils to pre&s;ume to preface their Re&s;ults &s;o, unle&s;s they clear up, and make it appear, that what they &s;ay is agreea|ble to the Word of God, and to human Rea&s;on. Thus the <HI>Jeru&s;alem Council</HI> &s;hew how it appeared, that IT SEEMED GOOD TO THE HOLY GHOST, to lay no &s;uch Burden as Circumci&s;ion upon the Gentiles. For fir&s;t, in the 8th Ver. <HI>Peter</HI> declares how God bare Witne&s;s to the Gentiles, giv|ing them the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> even as he did to the Circumci&s;i|on. Then in the 12th Ver&s;e, All the Multitude attended to the Relation of like Facts, by <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> de|claring what Miracles God had wrought among the Gentiles, that they were knowing to. After they had related the&s;e Things, then <HI>James</HI> in the 14th Ver. and onward, begins to argue upon the&s;e Accounts, and compares them with the Scriptures of the Prophets; &s;hewing that the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> thus attending the Gentiles, was agreeable to what the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> had long before promi&s;ed, by the Mouth of the Pro|phets. Then the Argument &s;tood thus. The <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> having formerly promi&s;ed to attend the Gentiles or the un|circumci&s;ed, and having now, as appears in &s;everal In&s;tances in Fact attended them, or fallen upon them: Therefore the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> requires no &s;uch Burden as Circumci&s;ion upon them; for if <HI>it &s;eemed good to the Holy Gho&s;t</HI> to light upon, or attend them in Uncircumci&s;ion; then <HI>it &s;eemed good to the Holy Gho&s;t</HI> not to lay that Burden upon them. Hence comes out the Authority of the Re&s;ult, IT SEEMED GOOD TO THE HOLY GHOST, which all <HI>Re&s;ults</HI> mu&s;t have (i. e. appear exactly con&s;onant with the Word of God, which is the &s;ame Thing as to <HI>&s;eem good to the Holy Gho&s;t</HI>) or they bind not at all. For as Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> him&s;elf &s;ays, they are <HI>only Advi&s;ory:</HI> every one knows that <HI>Advice</HI> has no binding Force any far|ther, or in any other Sen&s;e than it is enlightning and con|vincing to the Under&s;tanding; and in religious Affairs, (which we are upon) &s;hewing what is the Mind and Will of God, opening of it to the Under&s;tanding, from his Word and Works; as the <HI>Jeru&s;alem Council</HI> did, till it appears what SEEMS GOOD TO THE HOLY GHOST, and when a Council are influenced by the Spirit the <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> Council were, when they have found what <HI>&s;eems good to the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> the &s;ame will al&s;o <HI>plea&s;e and &s;eem good</HI> to them, perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with Rea&s;on. And when it is thus enlightning
<PB N="27" REF="012714_0026_0F8B8DBF2388F450">and convincing to the Under&s;tanding, that it is agreeable to the Mind of God, and to human Rea&s;on; it will have all binding Force in it that could be wi&s;hed.</P>

<HEAD>The USE of COUNCILS.</HEAD>
<P>From what has been &s;aid above; it appears that the prin|cipal USE of them, is to inve&s;tigate, find out, and demon|&s;trate what is the Mind and Will of God; and to convince &s;uch Churches as may be at a Lo&s;s, what their Duty is.&mdash; This appears not only by the Pattern we have in the <HI>Jeru|&s;alem Council:</HI> but al&s;o according to the Platform, Chapter XV. Sect. 2, al&s;o XVI. Sect. 2 and 4.</P>
<P>Another thing wherein we may reckon the USE of Coun|cils, is to keep up and maintain Corre&s;pondence, Fellow&s;hip, Communion and good Under&s;tanding between Churches. Thus the Church at <HI>Antioch</HI> &s;ending their Me&s;&s;engers to <HI>Jeru|&s;alem,</HI> and then the Council &s;ending &s;ome of their own Mem|bers to <HI>Antioch,</HI> made a Corre&s;pond and Fellow&s;hip between them; as well as afforded Help and Light to them. And this argues to the Sen&s;e of the Platform, Chap. VIII. Sect. 8; al&s;o Chap. X. Sect. 6. Hence in all important Affairs, e&s;pecially &s;uch as the &s;ettling in Office, and removing from Office; even though there &s;hould be no great doubt, if any, what is right, or agreeable to the Mind of God in the Af|fair; yet it &s;erves to keep up a Corre&s;pond and Fellow&s;hip between Churches, to call in Si&s;ter Churches, to a&s;&s;i&s;t and own them, in tho&s;e important Tran&s;actions; and e&s;pecially in the &s;ettling a Mini&s;ter, who by his Office to that particu-Church, becomes an Officer in general, in &s;ome &s;pecial Sen&s;e among all the Churches. And Rea&s;on teaches that a Man &s;hould in general go out at the &s;ame Door he comes in at. But in either of the&s;e Ca&s;es, if a Church can get no Help or Light from Si&s;ter Churches; and e&s;pecially in di&s;mi&s;&s;ing, Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> him&s;elf &s;ays, <HI>the Platform and common Sen&s;e will ju&s;tify the People in di&s;mi&s;&s;ing of him.</HI> Therefore, when a Peo|ple have made repeated Trials to obtain Light and A&s;&s;i&s;tance from their Si&s;ter Churches, and can obtain none; as was ex|pre&s;sly the Ca&s;e at <HI>Bolton,</HI> as appears by their Remarks on the Re&s;ult; then according to Mr. <HI>Adams</HI>'s own Doctrine, they had a good right to di&s;mi&s;s him. And indeed, though in general for the keeping up Fellow&s;hip and Corre&s;pond of Churches; it is convenient to have a Council at the Di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion of a Mini&s;ter; yet the In&s;tances are frequent where they have been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed entirely without a Council. There|fore,
<PB N="28" REF="012714_0027_0F8B8DC14BBF7628">when Si&s;ter Churches have been repeatedly con&s;ulted with, it &s;erves the Purpo&s;e of Corre&s;pondence of Churches; even though they can't obtain any Light from them. There|fore, the Way is abundantly clear for a Church to proceed to di&s;mi&s;s him. Thus con&s;ider the Nature and U&s;e of Councils every Way, <HI>Bolton</HI> People had come to the whole Nature and De&s;ign of them, according to Scripture, Plat|form, and Mr. <HI>Adams.</HI> Therefore he has no Cau&s;e to com|plain of them, or to inveigh again&s;t them.</P>
<P>But even upon the Suppo&s;ition that Councils were to be con&s;idered as Judicatories of Matters of Fact; yet to pre|tend to exclude the Church, or any Members of it from being Witne&s;&s;es; or to &s;et at naught their Te&s;timony, as it is &s;aid the <HI>Bolton June</HI> Council did, under a Notion of their being Witne&s;&s;es in their own Ca&s;e; is turning all Law human and Divine, and all common Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on out of Doors. It may be plain to every one, that will give him&s;elf the Trouble to think of it, that in all &s;uch Ca&s;es as are purely Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, they are <HI>King's Ca&s;es;</HI> Chri&s;t is King and Head of the Church; and no farther than a Crime is again&s;t him as King, have Churches or Councils any Bu&s;i|ne&s;s to try them. And it is plain, Chri&s;t him&s;elf &s;o con&s;iders them, in his Direction, Mat. 18, where he &s;ays, <HI>if thy Bro|ther tre&s;pa&s;s ought again&s;t thee;&mdash;take with thee one or two, that in the Mouth of two or three,</HI> &amp;c. It is plain that the Ori|ginal Complainant is con&s;idered by Chri&s;t as a Witne&s;s. The Rea&s;on is plain, that in &s;uch Cau&s;es as belong to the Church to try, the Complainant don't get one Farthing to him&s;elf by its going again&s;t the Per&s;on complained of. <HI>Who made me a Judge and a Divider,</HI> &s;aid Chri&s;t him&s;elf, and if he would not be Judge about &s;ecular Intere&s;t or Property, he never &s;et his Body here to be Judge about them Things. But the Cau&s;es to be tried by the Church are the King Chri&s;t Je&s;us's Cau&s;es; and every one (I &s;hould think) knows that in King's Ca&s;es, the Per&s;on or Per&s;ons immediately injured are good Evidences.</P>
<P>But again, &s;uppo&s;ing it were allowed, that Councils were a Court of Judicature; and to try Actions of Right and Wrong, as to Civil Intere&s;t or Property; yet the Conduct of that Council in rejecting the Church, as it is &s;aid they did, can no Way be reconciled to human Law, nor the Word of God. I &s;uppo&s;e a general Rule in Law, for admitting Witne&s;&s;es, is when the Deponent don't win or loo&s;e by the i&s;&s;ue of the Action. And I &s;uppo&s;e it to be as general a Rule, that when one who is Party, or con&s;idered as Party in the Ca&s;e, depo&s;es any Thing, or freely gives in any Thing, which in the i&s;&s;ue of the Cau&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> him to Le&s;s; that his own
<PB N="29" REF="012714_0028_0F8B8DC21F098A98">Confe&s;&s;ion &s;hall be taken in the &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e again&s;t him|&s;elf; and it is plain enough, that in the Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of a Mini&s;ter; that for the Cau&s;e to i&s;&s;ue in his Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, &s;ub|jects the People to a Lo&s;s of their Property; Since they mu&s;t be at the Co&s;t and Trouble of &s;ettling another. Hence their Te&s;timony in &s;uch Ca&s;e is the &s;tronge&s;t po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>But then again, &s;uppo&s;ing it were &s;o that they were Gainers by his Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion; yet neither by the Law of God, Civil Proceedings, or common Sen&s;e, could their Evidence be &s;o rejected. For I take it, that where the Nature of the Ca&s;e is &s;uch, that no other Evidence ordinarily can be had, that of the Parties is to be admitted, as in Book Debts, Actions of Tre&s;pa&s;s, &amp;c. where both the Plaintiff and Defendant (if I mi&s;take not) are admitted as Witne&s;&s;es in their own Ca&s;e, in the &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e; &s;o as directly to &s;wear Money into their own Pockets: and this agrees to the Law of God. Exod. XXII. 11. <HI>Then &s;hall an Oath of the Lord be between them both, that he hath not put his Hand to his Neighbours Goods: and the Owner of it &s;hall accept thereof, and he &s;hall not make it good.</HI> There we &s;ee the Man was to give Evidence in his own Ca&s;e, in the &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e; &s;wearing Money in|to his own Pocket, or at lea&s;t which is the &s;ame thing, &s;av|ing of it; it being where other Evidence could not be had. So al&s;o in Wills, the Law is that no one to whom a Legacy is made may be a Witne&s;s; and yet where a Legacy is made to a Town or Church, it has (if I mi&s;take not) very lately been re&s;olved by the principal Men in this Government, Gentlemen of the Law, that in &s;uch Ca&s;e, Members of the Church or Inhabitants of the Town, where the Legacy is gi|ven, mu&s;t be allowed as Witne&s;&s;es to the Will; becau&s;e o|ther Witne&s;&s;es ordinarily cannot be had. Now Church Cau|&s;es are &s;uch, as ordinarily other Evidence than tho&s;e of the Church are not to be expected; &s;o that they properly come under this Rule. Therefore take it every Way; and the rejecting the Church, as it is &s;aid that Council did, was re|pugnant to the Law of God, common Sen&s;e, and human Laws. And then it is no Wonder the People &s;aid if was above their Comprehen&s;ion, as in their Remarks on the Re|&s;ult.</P>
<P>I come now to &s;ay &s;omething of the Mini&s;ter having a right to NEGATIVE THE VOTES OF THE CHURCH. This Notion held to by the Mini&s;ters, has cau&s;ed much dif|ficulty in many Churches. Indeed where a Mini&s;ter has ne|ver a&s;&s;umed it in his Practice, and the People have never
<PB N="30" REF="012714_0029_0F8B8DC2BB50F3A8">felt the inconveniency of it, the People will even them|&s;elves argue in favour of it. And truly where a Man holds to any thing that is not right, &s;o long as he don't Practice upon it to do any hurt with it, it is I &s;uppo&s;e not worth while to begin a Contention with him for his Notions or Opinions. But in as much as it has been the Bone of Conten|tion in many Places, and is what has been of the In&s;tru|ments u&s;ed in wounding of <HI>Bolton,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> has bran|di&s;hed it in his Sermon like a Warrior his Sword; it &s;eems highly nece&s;&s;ary in this neighbourly undertaking I am upon, to pour in &s;ome healing Oyl into the Wounds that have been made by that deadly In&s;trument. Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> and others who hold to this <HI>Negative Power</HI> in the Mini&s;ter, all pretend to take it from that Clau&s;e in the Platform. Chap. X. Section 11. I don't find as Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> nor did I ever know of any one el&s;e, the mo&s;t &s;trenuous Advocate for it, ever produce one &s;ingle Li&s;p of Scripture for it; or pretend to go to that &s;acred Book for it's Vindication: hence then take it ju&s;t as they would have it, it is an <HI>up&s;tart</HI> Practice which the Scripture knows nothing about. And it is well worthy to be ob&s;erved, that this is almo&s;t the only Section in the Plat|form that has no Quotation from Scripture to &s;upport it; &s;o that it appears, the Compilers of the Platform them&s;elves, did not pretend to any Scripture, to &s;upport the Notion there|in advanced. However we may ob&s;erve 2dly, That it mu&s;t be notorious to every one that reads the Platform, that it all goes upon the Notion or Suppo&s;ition of a plurality of Elders in each Church. There they find a whole long Chap. upon Ruling Elders, and every where inter&s;per&s;ed about El|ders of the Church; and e&s;pecially and abundantly &s;o in this Xth Chapter, the 3d Section &s;peaks of the <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI> of the Church, and of the Government of the Church in re&s;pect to them, re&s;embling an <HI>Ari&s;tocracy,</HI> both which Terms every one knows (who has had tolerable under&s;tanding of Words) carry in them the Notion of Elders or Rulers to one Body, for if it were but only one Elder, he might properly be called a <HI>Pre&s;byter,</HI> but not a <HI>Pre&s;bytery.</HI> And &s;o as to the other Term, if the Government were carried on only by one Ruler, it could not be called an <HI>Ari&s;tocracy,</HI> but a <HI>Monarchy:</HI> it is &s;o repeat|ed, abundant and notorious that the Platform, and e&s;pecial|ly this Chapter is built upon this Notion, viz. of a plurality of Elders, or ruling Officers to each Church, that it is need|le&s;s to &s;ay any thing more to make it mo&s;t certain to every one that reads the Platform. Hence the &s;aying in this 11 Sect. That <HI>in an organick Church and right Admini&s;tration it re|quires
<PB N="31" REF="012714_0030_0F8B8DC385928380">the Con&s;ent of both to con&s;ummate or perfect a Church-Act,</HI> can't give the lea&s;t &s;hadow or Colour of Right to what is pretended, about a &s;ingle Pre&s;byter's negativing the Vote of the Church, for this would make the Government of the Church, in re&s;pect to its Mini&s;ter a <HI>Monarchy,</HI> which is a <HI>new and up&s;tart Practice</HI> unknown to the Platform, which owns no <HI>Monarchal</HI> Power or Ruler in the Church, but Chri&s;t him|&s;elf. So that all we have in the Platform which gives the lea&s;t Colour for what is pretended about negativing; is where there is a Pre&s;bytery, who at fir&s;t Glance, would be thought to have a Negative upon the Church by the Plat. But I rather think that there is a Mi&s;take even in this, and that no &s;uch negativing Power, as is generally &s;uppo&s;ed be|longs to the Pre&s;bytery by the Platform. But before I proceed it may be proper a little to explain what we are to under&s;tand by the Mini&s;ter or <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI> negativing the Vote of the Church. It &s;eems to be con&s;ider'd as re&s;embling the Legi&s;la|tive Body of the Nation or Province, where there are three Branches; any one of which not concurring with the other two, makes void whatever the other two may have voted; and &s;o it becomes no Act of Parliament or A&s;&s;embly. And &s;o in the Church, e&s;pecially when it has a <HI>Pre&s;bytery,</HI> it is &s;up|po&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t of two Branches; either of which not con|curring, makes void the Vote of the other Branch, &s;o as that it becomes no Act of the Church. But this is evidently a fal&s;e Notion, and contrary to both Scripture and Platform, to con&s;ider or compare the Church to a Legi&s;lative Body; for the Platform owns no Legi&s;lative Power belonging to the Church, but what is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Head. vid. this Xth Chapter, Section 1 and 4, with other Places to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e. Hence the Church are not by Scripture or Plat|form con&s;idered as a Legi&s;lative, but an Executive Body; as in the 18th of Matthew, and many other Places; and &s;o in the Platform in numberle&s;s Places, and abundantly in this Xth Chapter, and e&s;pecially in this &s;o much boa&s;ted Section, Church Acts are called <HI>Admini&s;tration,</HI> not <HI>Legi&s;lation,</HI> and it is plain to &s;ee, that to &s;uppo&s;e or allow any &s;uch Thing as <HI>Legi&s;lation</HI> in the Church, and e&s;pecially to have the Mini|&s;ter with a Negative Power at the Head of it, leads directly up to his <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> him&s;elf. So that according to Scripture, Platform and Experience; the Church cannot be con&s;idered, as a <HI>Legi&s;lative</HI> Body: but an Executive one. Hence it ap|pears that it is incon&s;i&s;tent and impracticable, to con&s;ider the Church in two Branches, one Branch having a Negative upon the other. In a Legi&s;lative Body one Branch may
<PB N="32" REF="012714_0031_0F8B8DC45059EDA8">propo&s;e a Thing, and Vote it, and if the other Branch or Branches do not concur with it, the Thing may cea&s;e there, and no &s;pecial Inconveniences accrue, and perhaps may be better than if the Law had pa&s;&s;ed. But it is far different in an Executive Court, when any Cau&s;e is before them there mu&s;t be an I&s;&s;ue to the Cau&s;e, it mu&s;t be acted upon, it won't do to have two Branches in &s;uch a Sen&s;e having a Negative one up|on the other, as that they can never come together, and &s;o the Ca&s;e dropped out of Court becau&s;e the Court can't agree. This would make horrid Work, Per&s;ons could never have the the Benefit of Law and ju&s;tice. So in our Executive Courts, though there &s;eems in &s;ome Sen&s;e two Branches, viz. the Judges and the Jury, the Ca&s;e I take it, mu&s;t i&s;&s;ue finally as the Jury bring in, and the Judges mu&s;t give Sentence and Execution accordingly; however it may be different from their Minds, though they have indeed right to &s;end out a Jury once and again; yet it mu&s;t finally i&s;&s;ue as the Jury give Verdict. So in the Church, it is ab&s;olutely impracticable to pretend to con&s;ider them as two Branches, but as they are an Executive Body: If we compare them with our Execu|tive Courts, it will very well agree with the Platform. There the Church are plainly made the Jury as in this &s;ame Secti|on, <HI>The Power of Judgment in Matters of Cen&s;ure.</HI> And the Pre&s;bytery re&s;emble the Bench of Judges in the &s;ame Section, <HI>The ordinary Power of Government belonging to the Elders:</HI> as in a Civil Court, the Rule, Government and Pre&s;idency of the Court belongs to the Bench. And if the Elders or e|ven a &s;ingle Elder when he thought the Church made a wrong Judgment &s;hould propo&s;e to &s;u&s;pend the Affairs for farther Light and Con&s;ideration &s;ome rea&s;onable Time, in imitati|on of the Civil Courts &s;ending out the Jury; it is not likely any Church would be again&s;t it. But then after all, judg|ment mu&s;t pa&s;s as the Church finally bring in; for Power of judgment lies with them, as in this boa&s;ted negativing Section it &s;elf; and the Officers in pronouncing Sentence, they mu&s;t do it with the Con&s;ent of the Church, as in the 9th Section. So it is the judgment of the Church or Brother|hood, and the Sentence of the Officers, according to the judg|ment of the Brotherhood, and &s;o it comes out to that, that in the con&s;ummating and perfecting the Cau&s;e, each one mu&s;t do his Part, the Brotherhood theirs, and the Officers theirs; and &s;o it is in a Court of Civil Ju&s;tice, each one mu&s;t do his Part, the Jury theirs, and the Bench theirs, in order to con|&s;ummate, i&s;&s;ue or fini&s;h the Cau&s;e: what then? no body as I know of, ever thought the Bench had therefore a Negative
<PB N="33" REF="012714_0032_0F8B8DC501D0A150">Verdicts of the Jury. It has been before &s;hewn, that &s;uch a Notion of Negative Branches in Executive Courts, or the Ad|mini&s;tration of Law, is repugnant and impracticable. So al&s;o it requires the Office-Act of the Mini&s;ter, or &s;ome Ju&s;tice of the Peace to <HI>con&s;ummate</HI> or perfect a Marriage; do the Rev. Cler|gy therefore conclude, that they have a Negative upon all the Matches that are made in their Towns or Pari&s;hes? They may ea&s;ily &s;ee that this would Negative the Fees out of their Pockets. So al&s;o it requires the Office-Act of a Ju&s;tice of the Peace to <HI>con&s;ummate</HI> or <HI>perfect</HI> a Deed, for the Conveyance of Land. Have the Ju&s;tices therefore a Negative upon all the Sale of Land within their Counties? So al&s;o it requires the Office-Act of the Judge of Probate to <HI>con&s;ummate</HI> or <HI>per|fect</HI> Wills. Has the Judge of Probate therefore a Negative on all the Wills in the County? Mu&s;t not the Mini&s;ters in Marriages, the Ju&s;tices in Deeds, the Probate in Wills <HI>Con|&s;ent</HI> to all tho&s;e Tran&s;actions that they act their Office-Part in? The Mini&s;ter may think, that a Couple pre&s;ented to him for Marriage, had better not Marry. A Ju&s;tice may think that Men have made a fooli&s;h Bargain in a Deed brought to him to acknowledge. A Judge may think that a Man has made a very fooli&s;h unju&s;t Will brought to him for Probating. What then? That is not their Bu&s;ine&s;s. Their acting their Office-Part, and thus <HI>con&s;enting, allowing of, yielding to,</HI> or <HI>ratifying</HI> the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed fooli&s;h or unju&s;t Mar|riages, Bargains or Wills; don't make tho&s;e Officers fooli&s;h or unju&s;t. They don't make the Marriages, Bar|gains or Wills. They only Act their Office-Part in <HI>con|&s;ummating</HI> or <HI>perfecting</HI> tho&s;e Marriages, &amp;c. The Folly or Inju&s;tice, if there is any, lies at the Door of tho&s;e that made the Matches, &amp;c. So in the Church: it belonging to the Brotherhood to judge, &amp;c. If they &s;hould chance to make an erroneous Judgment; the Mini&s;ter or Pre&s;bytery in doing their Office-Part, in <HI>con&s;ummating</HI> or <HI>perfecting</HI> tho&s;e Votes, don't make them&s;elves erroneous. It being the Right and Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Brotherhood to judge both by Scripture and Platform, makes it that it is no more nece&s;&s;arily the Act or Judgment of the Mini&s;ter or Pre&s;bytery in their acting their Office-Part, in <HI>con&s;ummating</HI> or <HI>perfecting</HI> the Votes of the Brotherhood; than the Verdict, &amp;c. &s;poken of above, are the Verdict, &amp;c. of the Judges, &amp;c. by their acting their Office Part, in <HI>con&s;ummating</HI> or <HI>perfecting</HI> what is done in tho&s;e re&s;pective Ca&s;es. But it is entirely different in Legi&s;lative Bodies con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal Branches, where, by every Branch concurring, it becomes the Special Act of Law of every
<PB N="34" REF="012714_0033_0F8B8DC6620D1A20">Branch. But &s;hould Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> here &s;ay, that by <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> is &s;ome times meant, <HI>Accord</HI> or <HI>Agreement</HI> in any Thing: So that <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> in this Place mu&s;t mean the Agreement of the &s;everal Branches in Legi&s;lature. Yet he him&s;elf has &s;aid, &s;peaking of the Platform, that <Q>in all Writings, whe|ther Wills, Charters, or any Thing el&s;e of the like Kind, loo&s;e and general Pa&s;&s;ages are to be explained by tho&s;e that are more definite.</Q> So that if there &s;hould happen to be dropped a loo&s;e ambiguous Word; yet it mu&s;t be ex|plained, and controuled, by tho&s;e more definite and certain. And the Platform is full and abundant enough, that no &s;uch Thing as <HI>Legi&s;lation</HI> belongs to the Church; as has been before hinted. The Laws belonging to that, being all made by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> But much is &s;aid about Con&s;cience in Church Affairs; and that a Mini&s;ter can't Act contrary to his Con&s;cience, and therefore mu&s;t have a <HI>Negative.</HI> Then let it be con&s;idered, that the Mini&s;ter no more nece&s;&s;arily goes contrary to his Con&s;cience, in acting his Office-Part in <HI>con&s;ummating</HI> or <HI>perfecting</HI> the Votes of the Church which are contrary to his Judgment; than the Minor Part of the Church nece&s;&s;arily go contrary to their Con&s;cience, in com|muning with the Major Part, who have made a Judgment contrary to theirs. If thus &s;tanding in their Lot, acting their Part with the Body, as they &s;tand in Relation to it, either in the Mini&s;ter or Minor Part, is going contrary to their Con&s;cience, what &s;hall they do? Shall they therefore leave the Body? Or &s;hall the Major Part give up their Judg|ment to the Minor? would not that in deed be going con|trary to their Con&s;cience? Shall the Major Part leave the Body? or rather &s;hall they give up their Exi&s;tence? For they are the Body. I &s;hould think every one by this Time mu&s;t &s;ee, that the Doctrine or Notion that a Mini&s;ter can't act his Office-Part in <HI>perfecting</HI> or <HI>con&s;ummating</HI> the Votes or Judgment of the Church, when contrary to his Judgment; is a Notion which in its very Nature and Con&s;equences is ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with the very Being of Society, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily root up and de&s;troy all Church State; it generally does prove &s;o in Fact, wherever Mini&s;ters pretend to a&s;&s;ume or u&s;urp it. And will People per&s;uade them&s;elves that the Body of Chri&s;t of all others nece&s;&s;arily and inhe|rently has that mortal BANE in it &s;elf, which mu&s;t unavoid|ably i&s;&s;ue in its own de&s;truction! No doubt the Body of Chri&s;t is mo&s;t free of any from &s;uch a <HI>Bane.</HI> The Laws are all made belonging to it. And therefore there is no need, nor po&s;&s;ibility of admitting any Negative Branches in the Acts proper to his Body, which is his Church.</P>

And that the Right or Power of receiving in judging, cen|&s;uring, ca&s;ting out, and re&s;toring called the KEYS of the Church, &s;o much contended about; that the&s;e by the Laws of Chri&s;t, are committed to the Church or Brotherhood might be made abundantly manife&s;t from a multitude of Places of Scripture; as well as the Platform. A few of which may be hinted. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> what Chri&s;t &s;ays in the XVIIIth of Matthew, <HI>Tell it to the Church: If he neglect to hear the Church.</HI> And in the next Ver&s;e &s;aying, <HI>What&s;oever ye &s;hall hind on Earth,</HI> &amp;c. This <HI>Ye</HI> meant the &s;ame Thing as if he had &s;aid what&s;oever the <HI>Church &s;hall bind on Earth;</HI> for they were the <HI>Church</HI> that were then gathered. So that here we &s;ee, Chri&s;t plainly fixes the Right and Authority of judging and cen&s;uring, in the Church; <HI>for if he neglect to hear the Church</HI> expre&s;sly determines that it is their Mind which is to be &s;poken and heard; and his putting a Sanction upon their Binding and Loo&s;ing is expre&s;sly giving them the KEYS. The &s;ame might al&s;o be fairly argued from what Chri&s;t &s;ays of the KEYS in XVIth of Matthew. For altho' perhaps it may not appear &s;o plain at the fir&s;t Glance, that the KEYS were in that Place given to the Church; yet many Things might be &s;aid &s;hewing that, that this is the meaning of it: But what may be &s;ufficient to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, may be to ob&s;erve, that Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> him&s;elf &s;ays, that <HI>two</HI> Pa&s;&s;ages relating to the &s;ame Thing; <HI>the latter mu&s;t always controul, interpret and determine the former: that this is cer|tainly the Way of &s;ettling real or apparent Contradictions: that we are bound in all Rea&s;on to interpret the former in Con&s;i&s;ten|cy with the latter,</HI> vid. p. 36. So that according to him we are certainly bound in all Rea&s;on, to interpret that in the XVIth of Matthew, in con&s;i&s;tency with this in the XVIIIth.</P>
<P>Accordingly we find the Apo&s;tles, in all their Tran&s;acti|ons, always treating the Matter thus: E&s;pecially in their Epi&s;tles. So we find Paul to the Romans, Chap. I. Ver. 7. <HI>To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called Saints.</HI> So then whatever he &s;ays in all the Epi&s;tle directing about Church Di&s;cipline, it is to tho&s;e he had thus addre&s;&s;ed, which was certainly all the Brotherhood, profe&s;&s;ing Believers. Accord|ingly he &s;ays, Chap. XVI. Ver. 17. <HI>Now I be&s;eech you, Brethren, mark them which cau&s;e Divi&s;ions,</HI> &amp;c. The &s;ame might al&s;o be ob&s;erved of what he &s;ays to the Corinthians in both Epi&s;tles to them. The IId and IIId Chapters of the Revelations are al&s;o upon the Plan of the KEYS, Right and Authority of judging, cen&s;uring, &amp;c. being in the Church. And we read of but one (that I remember) in all
<PB N="36" REF="012714_0035_0F8B8DC901528810">the New-Te&s;tament that pretended to a&s;&s;ume the Pre-emi|nence, and to u&s;e the KEYS, refu&s;ing to take into the Church and ca&s;ting out of the Church; who&s;e Deeds John &s;peaks of as evil and malicious, IIId Epi&s;tle, 9th and 10th Ver&s;es. John &s;ays, he him&s;elf wrote to the Church: but this <HI>Diotrephes</HI> treated Things in a different Manner, and it is no uncommon Thing for <HI>Diotrephan</HI> Bi&s;hops to <HI>prate maliciou&s;ly</HI> again&s;t the true Apo&s;tles, Mini&s;ters or Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, who allow the Church their Rights: Even as that old <HI>Diotrephes</HI> did again&s;t <HI>John</HI> and the other Apo&s;tles who wrote to the Church. I hope by this Time it &s;ufficiently appears, that the KEYS were by Chri&s;t committed to the Church, which are con|&s;idered as his Body. And therefore for any Man or &s;et of Men, Mini&s;ter or Councils, to pre&s;ume to wre&s;t them out of their Hands; i. e. to pretend to impo&s;e Members upon any Church; or to take them away as if they could di&s;mi&s;s them; or remove their Relation; or to put on Cen&s;ures, or to take them off; or to Negative the Church in the&s;e Acts; has all the Appearance of the wor&s;t of <HI>&s;acrilege.</HI> What can be wor&s;e robbing than to wre&s;t the KEYS of a Trea&s;ure from the right Owner? Or con&s;ider the Church as his Body, it has all the Symptoms of wor&s;e than crucifying Chri&s;t a|fre&s;h. To me the attempting or pretending to impo&s;e Members on any Church which they judge unworthy, very much re&s;embles the putting on Chri&s;t a Crown of Thorns; or of giving him Gaul and Vinegar to drink. The pretend|ing to take away or remove, or Cen&s;ure Members contrary to the Church; is di&s;locating or breaking the Members of Chri&s;t's Body; which is wor&s;e than the crucifiers of Chri&s;t did to him; for a Bone of him was not to be broken. And may the Lord forgive all &s;uch as have any Hand in &s;uch Things, not knowing what they do: But the Soul that doth ought pre&s;umptuou&s;ly, &s;hall be cut off from among his Peo|ple.</P>
<P>Having thus far &s;hewn that no &s;uch <HI>negativing Power</HI> is or can belong to the Mini&s;ter or Pre&s;bytery, as is &s;o much claimed or pretended: That the KEYS by Chri&s;t were com|mitted to the Church: That the Church cannot be con&s;ider|ed as a Legi&s;lative Body; I hope it may be &s;een, that there is no need of all the Noi&s;e and Plea that &s;ome make about Con&s;cience, and that the Mini&s;ter can't go contrary to his Con&s;cience in acting his Office-Part, re&s;pecting the Votes of the Church. For when it is Matter of Judgment, it cannot be Matter of Con&s;cience. But if the Church are to make Laws
<PB N="37" REF="012714_0036_0F8B8DCB3193BA08">and Statutes; they might make &s;ome contrary to his Con|&s;cience, and he no doubt ought to have right to negative them; or &s;ome Way found out, for him to be freed from being &s;ubject to the Laws he in no Sen&s;e con&s;ented to. But as the Ca&s;e now &s;tands, and the Power and Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Church is no other than Executive, or to admini&s;ter upon Laws already made, there is no need nor po&s;&s;ibility of his having a Negative upon the Judgments or Votes of the Church; nor any Controul or Embarra&s;ments upon his Con|&s;cience; and it is no doubt with me, that it is the entertain|ing this mi&s;taken Notion, of the Church being or acting as a Legi&s;lative Body, which is the Cau&s;e of many of the Con|tentions, and much of the Confu&s;ion there is in our Churches.</P>
<P>I had many Things more in my Mind, which I thought to have wrote: But I mu&s;t leave my Patient with the Ho&s;t, and pa&s;s on my Journey; when I return, if I find any Thing more to pay, I determine to make Di&s;bur&s;tments according to my Ability.</P>

<P>HAVING peru&s;ed the preceeding Narrative of the late Troubles and Tran&s;actions in <HI>Bolton,</HI> before it went to the Pre&s;s, wrote by a Neighbour unknown; and being well acquainted with all the Circum&s;tances, I hope the Au|thor will not take it ami&s;s, if I rectify one Mi&s;take in &s;aid Narrative, and al&s;o add a few Lines to &s;et &s;ome Things in a clearer Light.</P>
<P>In &s;aid Narrative it is &s;aid, that the &s;aid Mini&s;ter declared that <Q>he had never drank to that degree &s;o as in any Way to affect or hurt his Rea&s;on, Speech or Limbs; and the Church voted to accept of &s;aid Declaration as a Settlement of &s;aid Affair,</Q> (which Declaration was made and repeated at other Times) but the following Declaration was what the Church &s;ettled with him upon at that Time, viz.</P>
<P>"WHEREAS many have manife&s;ted an unea&s;ine&s;s with me, re&s;pecting &s;uppo&s;ed Intemperance on the Lord's Day, on which was our la&s;t Communion; on which I &s;ay, I do not pretend there is no Foundation of Su&s;picion; but rather think it was mainly and principally owing to &s;ome other Cau&s;e or Cau&s;es. But let it be from what it will I de&s;ire to take a &s;uitable Notice of it, and be duly humbled under the Frown of Providence, and engage by divine Help, to &s;hun all rea&s;onable Grounds of Jealou&s;y for the Time to come."</P>
<P>And when it was repeatedly urged that he &s;hould make &s;ome further Confe&s;&s;ion, he declared that he could not, nor would not, and that he &s;hould do Violence to his own Con|&s;cience if he did: till at length, either by the Per&s;wa&s;ion of the Council, or &s;ome other means, he acknowledges, that con|&s;cious of his own faultine&s;s, he freely and frankly confe&s;&s;es his Sin and Faults, in the exce&s;&s;ive U&s;e of Spirituous Liquors in &s;everal In&s;tances: and humbly a&s;ks forgivne&s;s of God and his People, &amp;c. Which la&s;t Confe&s;&s;ion he always refu&s;ed to read to the Congregation. The fir&s;t Declaration and the la&s;t Confe&s;&s;ion were &s;o different, that the Church could never reconcile them together; but Mr. <HI>Go&s;s</HI> always in&s;i&s;ted upon it, that the fir&s;t was equal to the la&s;t.</P>
