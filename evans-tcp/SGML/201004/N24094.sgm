<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><P>That a Science which is univer&s;al in its u&s;e and extent, ac|commodated to each individual, yet comprehending the whole community, &s;hould ever have been deemed unne|ce&s;&s;ary to be &s;tudied in an Univer&s;ity, is a matter of a&s;ton|i&s;hment and concern.</P>

<P>MAN's knowledge is circum&s;cribed not only by the limitation of his faculties, but al&s;o by that of his exi&s;tence. Perfection being unat|tainable, a re&s;olution to arrive at the happy &s;um|mit of univer&s;al knowledge, would be as prepo&s;|terous as an attempt to arre&s;t the &s;un in his rapid progre&s;s through the &s;kies. Into what path then is man, that offspring of imperfection, that child of error, to be conducted? Let him, in his pur|&s;uits after knowledge, be allured to tho&s;e branches only which have mo&s;t for their object his own happine&s;s, connected with that greater good, the good of &s;ociety. Learning is the mo&s;t precious jewel; and could I add, without being charged with partiality for a favourite &s;tudy, I would &s;ay, that no learning is &s;o excellent for all degrees of
<PB N="4" REF="031865_0003_0FEEF3475A783308">
men as a knowledge of laws, and the principles of legi&s;lation.</P>
<P>Univer&s;al diffu&s;ion of legal information beauti|fies and adorns Ju&s;tice with all her &s;plendid &s;uit: it pre&s;ents her in an attitude &s;o divine, that I ex|cu&s;e the ancients who wor&s;hiped her as a godde&s;s. To the hone&s;t indu&s;trious yeoman-citizens it af|fords a &s;hield of protection again&s;t the &s;ecret in|&s;inuations of fraud, and the bold attacks of ma|levolence.</P>
<P>Although eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil authority &s;hould never be blended together, yet our <HI>Reverend Teachers of Holy Things</HI> ought not to be un&s;killed in the &s;cience of juri&s;prudence. Their duty con|&s;i&s;ts in holding up the mirror to the face of man, to reflect his weakne&s;&s;es, his follies, his imper|fections and vices; to teach him obedience to di|vine in&s;titutions and civil authority. If the whole duty of man is to be laid before him by his &s;pirit|ual guides, the more exten&s;ive and univer&s;al their knowledge, the more u&s;eful will their in&s;tructions be to all cla&s;&s;es of hearers.</P>
<P>To judges and jurors the knowledge of juri&s;|prudence is of &s;uperlative concern. Shall man's deare&s;t intere&s;ts be adjudged by ignorance, by prejudice, and by pa&s;&s;ion? The wi&s;dom of ages, improved and collected in tho&s;e ma&s;&s;y volumes of Engli&s;h juri&s;prudence, requires a laborious in|ve&s;tigation, to empower the judges to merit the epithet and maintain the dignity of the fathers of the rights of the people.</P>
<P>Ill fated and deplorable is the condition of that country, who&s;e legi&s;lators are ignorant. Their duty con&s;i&s;ts in expounding, modelling and cre|ating laws. To maintain the propo&s;itions, that man can explain &s;tatutes he knows nothing about, can comment upon texts of which he is totally
<PB N="5" REF="031865_0004_0FEEF34ED9A73ED8">
ignorant, or can remedy defects in laws of which he has no knowledge, is prepo&s;terous in the ex|treme. As well might the un&s;killed in mechanics undertake to amend the defects in a complicated machine, or the untutored barbarian to enucleate tho&s;e mighty wonders which decorate and adorn the va&s;t amphitheatre of nature. A wi&s;e legi&s;lator is therefore a bright luminary to his country, and merits univer&s;al applau&s;e. His path is decorated with flowers, and leads to glory. Every man is his enemy, and his country's too, who would rob him of his wreaths, or tarni&s;h his honour.</P>
<P>Wherever the principles of legi&s;lation are well under&s;tood, political jealou&s;y and di&s;content are unknown or &s;ilenced. In every change of govern|ment from de&s;poti&s;m to freedom, and in every improvement of law from barbarous rigour to poli&s;hed mildne&s;s, ignorant citizens and blind legi&s;lators revolt again&s;t mea&s;ures &s;ugge&s;ted by wi&s;dom, and which eventually prove glorious and triumphant.</P>
<P>At the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the federal con&s;titution of the United States, &s;ome ignorant Americans, through blindne&s;s, felt all the horrors to be appre|hended from internal agitation and civil com|motion: yet how glorious has that in&s;titution proved&mdash;and how cordially do they now acquie&s;ce in the &s;y&s;tem they &s;o bitterly condemned.</P>
<P>The feudal &s;y&s;tem in England has been repre|&s;ented as a di&s;grace to its hi&s;tory. But if we con|template the nature of Engli&s;h juri&s;prudence, our thoughts will bring home to our minds convic|tion, that the feudal &s;y&s;tem is the grand ba&s;is of that &s;tupendous fabric: that it is the rock on which the wi&s;e men of the world have builded, and the &s;torms and tempe&s;ts have beaten upon the &s;uper&s;tructure, and it has not yet fallen. There
<PB N="6" REF="031865_0005_0FEEF34AB3D082D8">
were doubtle&s;s many evils in this &s;y&s;tem, but they were &s;uch as were not to have been prevent|ed in the early age of the world. A pure Ameri|can-like government could not have been hoped for in that period, when the &s;avage foot roamed o'er half creation, and nature blu&s;hed at the dawn of &s;cience. The policy of the times would not admit of that &s;pirit of liberty which now ani|mates the republican. Let us not then be de|luded: let the natural light which is within us &s;hine with its full lu&s;tre: let charity, that cele&s;tial &s;park, that emanation of divinity, irradiate and &s;ublime our &s;ouls: no longer let the dictates of &s;ound policy be execrated, or magnanimous ex|ploits &s;tigmatized, by the enemies of man, or by mi&s;guided zealots.</P>
<P>Let the&s;e reflections &s;erve to convince the mind of the va&s;t importance of a general diffu&s;ion of the knowledge of juri&s;prudence. Permit me now to &s;ugge&s;t, that while the fortunes of our citizens are incompetent for this purpo&s;e, pro|priety, public good and political nece&s;&s;ity, plead the cau&s;e of this &s;cience, and &s;olicit her introduc|tion to the cla&s;&s;ical exerci&s;es of a collegiate edu|cation. In all countries celebrated for improve|ment, this &s;cience has been particularly cultivat|ed, and made a branch of cla&s;&s;ical learning. No gentleman in tho&s;e countries deems his education complete, till he has been indoctrinated in the &s;cience of laws. Public in&s;titutions for the pro|motion of literature are the heart and &s;eat of life to our government, whence proceed the arteries in tides of health to nouri&s;h and &s;upport the whole &s;y&s;tem. This our &s;eminary, though yet in her infancy, has afforded pre&s;ages of her ri&s;ing great|ne&s;s. Already do her &s;ons contend with tho&s;e of Oxford and Cambridge for the laurels of <HI>Par|na&s;&s;us.</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="031865_0006_0FEEF3533126DAF0">
Let us then give eclat to her ri&s;ing glory, till &s;he &s;hall be elevated with tho&s;e bright con&s;tel|lations of the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Thou Seat of Literature, thou <HI>Alma Mater</HI> of Wi&s;dom, ha&s;ten thy progre&s;s in the career of glory; and let me exhort thy patrons and fathers to venerate and cheri&s;h in thy bo&s;om the heaven-born &s;cience of juri&s;prudence. May the genius of freedom in&s;pire your brea&s;ts, ye patrons of &s;cience, with the glorious ambition to rai&s;e up a luminary in the We&s;t, which &s;hall eclip&s;e her &s;i&s;ter lights. With plea&s;ing rapture I anticipate the great event. The dawn of truth will bur&s;t the reluctant clouds of night, and her meridian &s;un|&s;hine e&s;tabli&s;h and perpetuate the glory of Ame|rica. The decrees of wi&s;dom &s;hall afford protec|tion to innocence, and &s;ecure the rewards of in|du&s;try. The funeral dirge of inju&s;tice and op|pre&s;&s;ion &s;hall be triumphantly &s;ung o'er anarchy's expiring ruins.</P>
