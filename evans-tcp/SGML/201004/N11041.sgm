<P>WE have lately heard much, and too much, of the wi&s;dom of Parliament, the great council, of the nation; that is to &s;ay, the corrupt majority of that great council, where the mo&s;t votes enforce the vile&s;t mea&s;ures. We know what this great council once was, and what it ought to be. Let us reflect upon what it now is. It is (alas!) no more at pre&s;ent than a ma|jority of Ay's and No's&mdash;Contents and not Contents. And what is this majority? the Mini&s;ter's&mdash;What is this Mini&s;ter? the King's; What it the King? my Lord Bute's. What is Lord Bute? an enemy to this nation. I had like to have &s;aid what I think, a traytor; but I hope this will be &s;aid with more weight in a future impeachment, unle&s;s popular re|venge &s;hould ju&s;tly make a le&s;s &s;olemn, but a more dreadful example of this public pe&s;t. Through the&s;e channels of wi&s;dom flow all the grievance, oppre&s;&s;ions, and calamities, which are now &s;o &s;e|verely
<PB N="206" REF="013991_0002_0F92591002D134E8">felt in England and America. The &s;ubjects of the&s;e nations feel all the power of this great and wi&s;e council, without a &s;ingle ray of its benignity. It &s;hines upon it's Idols, but lowers upon the &s;ub|ject, for de&s;potic Power, is the great end in view, and the growth of it is cultivated with the greate&s;t boldne&s;s and a&s;&s;iduity. We now &s;ee the three great e&s;tates of this kingdom, which were, in their origin, wi&s;ely de&s;igned as &s;alutary checks upon each other, to pre&s;erve the con&s;titution, in an amicable confederacy to de&s;toy it. As to the Peers, they are created by the Crown, not for meritorious, but po|litical rea&s;ons. Wealth, and a pliant di&s;po&s;ion, are e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ites. Some minion of the crown be|comes bound for their good behaviour, and then the great &s;eal &s;tamps them for the tools of an au|dacious and corrupt mini&s;ter. But your Apo&s;tate Chathams, Camdens, Richmonds, Buckinghams, Temples, Shelburns, &amp;c. are repudiated. The virtuous minority is too thin to &s;ave their country. They are out-clamoured, and out-voted. I have heard Lord Chatham's manly eloquence rudely drowned by a combined roar of the mini&s;ter's, majo|rity in the Hou&s;e of Lords. I have heard that great Orator an&s;wered by mini&s;terial mouths without argu|ment, without &s;en&s;e, without grammar, and with|out Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>Their Lord&s;hips may well clear their hou&s;e, and be as much a&s;hamed of their &s;peeches, as they ought to be of their principles. As to the hou&s;e of Commons, it is filled, and fed three parts out of four, by the Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>Let me not forget, however, to congratulate them on a new privilege, which they acquired and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
<PB N="207" REF="013991_0003_0F925910EAD58BB0">in Wilkes's ca&s;e, the rational and mode&s;t Privilege of electing them&s;elves. This acqui&s;ition is a great one. It is plain that honourable Hou&s;e e&s;teems it &s;o, becau&s;e they have lately mo&s;t iniqui|tiou&s;ly refu&s;ed to era&s;e tho&s;e ba&s;e and daring innova|tions upon the rights of the people from their jour|nals. Thus they have indu&s;triou&s;ly pre&s;erved the infamy of the la&s;t dete&s;ted Parliament to po&s;terity. But they have likewi&s;e (which was the real de&s;ign) trea&s;ured up a vile precedent to be produced in fu|ture times of need, again&s;t the liberties of their ma&s;ters, the people of this kingdom.</P>
<P>There was a time when this hou&s;e of Commons was not too mode&s;t to oppo&s;e the arbitrary wills of Princes. There was a time when they had the ho|ne&s;ty to refu&s;e &s;upplies, when the former had been ill-applied, and as ill-accounted for; when the old had been lavi&s;hed in profu&s;ion and douceurs to fa|vourites, and new were demanded for the like pur|po&s;es, or wor&s;e, the in&s;idious purpo&s;es of corruption. There was a time too, when the head of that hou&s;e (the Speaker) had integrity, though &s;ome parts of that body were corrupt.</P>
<P>Whoever remembers On&s;low, mu&s;t re&s;pect his memory; whoever knew him mu&s;t revere it. He re&s;pected his Sovereign, but he loved the people. He pre&s;erved the dignity and integrity of his &s;tation. He di&s;tingui&s;hed nobly and ju&s;tly between a po&s;t of honour and a po&s;t of profit. He was neither Pen&s;i|oner, Placeman, nor Privy Councellor. He knew that it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;erve two ma&s;ters. He re|joiced to be at the head of a free people. He had a thorough knowledge of the rights, and was zealous in de&s;ending them. He knew that it was impo&s;&s;i|ble
<PB N="208" REF="013991_0004_0F92591183E59EA0">for a Speaker of a hou&s;e of Commons to be, with the lea&s;t con&s;i&s;tency, a Courtier and a Demagogue at the &s;ame time. He knew that if he held a lucra|tive place, he could not hold his integrity. He preferred his duty to tra&s;h. He preferred virtuous liberty to mini&s;terial influence and controul. He prefered honour to infamy, Sincerity to duplicity, and propriety to ab&s;urdity. For what can be more ab&s;urd than a ductile &s;peaker, who is at the head of the commons in the morning, and at the ear of the Sovereign in the evening? At one hour in character of a &s;peaker, at another in the function of a privy Coun&s;ellor. Now in the peoples chair, and now at a mini&s;terial board. To day collecting the &s;en&s;e of the people, and to morrow promoting the intrigues of a court. Co-operating with the people at one in&s;tant, and forming &s;chemes again&s;t their liberties at another. To crown all, let us &s;uppo&s;e this Speaker an e&s;tabli&s;hed placeman for life; to which place an annual income is appendant of 4000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum, and eventually twice that &s;um, or more, in a place which no &s;ubject had enjoyed for years, till the pre&s;ent Speaker (Norton) broke the ground anew. Why had it not been enjoyed for many years? Becau&s;e it was for life, and the Mini&s;ter had not &s;ufficient confidence in the &s;teady perfidy, and &s;upe|rior demerits of any one hireling, to be&s;tow it, till they were con&s;cious that Norton de&s;erved that, and more, Let us view this malleable Speaker, and pa|triotic &s;tate&s;man, this political Proteous, this double fronted Ianus, in another light, which will fully &s;how the compatibility of the two different functions</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e a Bute or a Mansfield were to be im|peached, as they well de&s;erve, by the Commons
<PB N="209" REF="013991_0005_0F925915F7D93208">of England ('tis but a &s;uppo&s;ition, for the corruption at pre&s;ent makes it impracticable) &s;uppo&s;e it only: Who&s;e duty would it be to carry up tho&s;e bills of impeachment to the bar of the Hou&s;e of Lords? Sir Fletcher Norton. Sir Fletcher? What? a place|man, a pen&s;ioner, a privy coun&s;ellor? A bird of the &s;ame feather? Can Jemmy Twitcher 'peach? I have &s;aid enough to be &s;ufficiently under&s;tood, and to &s;how how incon&s;i&s;tent and ab&s;urd it is for a Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons, to be amphi|biou&s;ly inclined.</P>
<P>Let us now return to the noble Lords&mdash;We &s;ee among them another majority, not indeed with Lord Bute (for he ab&s;conds) but with his deputy, Mans|field, at their head. No; 'tis Lord Ap&s;ley; tho&s;e in&s;ignia upon the table are his, true, the in&s;ignia, (the bauble, the pur&s;e and mace) are Ap&s;ley's; but Ap&s;ley him&s;elf is Mansfield's, as Mansfield him&s;elf is Bute's. The&s;e three dance the hay, like the &s;un, moon, and earth, in the Rehear&s;al, though indeed it is Lord Bute's intere&s;t at pre&s;ent to continue in eclip&s;e. At pre&s;ent that Thane is to all intents and purpo&s;es, by his two proxies Mansfield and Ap&s;ley, at the head of the Hou&s;e of Lords. He has his majority of myrmidons there, as well as among the Commons, where he is repre&s;ented by Lord North. Where then &s;hall we find a patriot? in the throne. This (alas) would be a ble&s;&s;ing "devoutly to be wi&s;hed."</P>
<P>But the great e&s;tates of this kingdom, are now not in a whole&s;ome, but a dangerous coalition: not in harmony, but in combination; not in friend&s;hip, but in confederacy. The Hou&s;e of Commons now &s;hut the doors again&s;t their con&s;tituents, the Lords
<PB N="210" REF="013991_0006_0F9259162E24D208">debate in private, they are a&s;hamed, as they well may, of their harrangues. The&s;e Hou&s;es, are now in truth, a Divan, a Conclave, a Junto, a Cabal, a Gang; but they are no longer what they were, or what they ought to be; they will &s;hortly feel the con&s;equences, of &s;uch an unnatural coalition. The body politic can never be healthy, whil&s;t its func|tions are ill performed; yet this is the great and wi&s;e council of the nation, in which &s;overeigns will confide.</P>
<P>I know that a majority of votes can &s;ave Minions and Favourites from the &s;caffold; but they cannot &s;ave them from public vengeance, nor can they &s;e|cure the &s;overeigns peace, affection, and e&s;teem, they can augment the civil li&s;t, from near a million a year to any &s;um that royal profu&s;ion may demand; they can allow without entring into preci&s;e accounts what a king may expend for public u&s;es, a term of the large&s;t the mo&s;t vague and mo&s;t indifinite mean|ing, including every &s;pecies of regal, dome&s;tic, po|litical, and unju&s;t profu&s;ion; they can lay &s;till heavier taxes for this purpo&s;e, as well as for carrying on the further a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of America; but they can neither force the united &s;ubjects of this kingdom to pay tho&s;e unrea&s;onable taxes, nor heal the wounds of a civil war if they refu&s;e. How will our com|mon enemies France and Spain, embroil the &s;cene? at &s;uch a cri&s;is, will an importation of Hanoverians; He&s;&s;ians, and mercenary troops from the little &s;tates of Germany avail? From Hanoverians no a&s;&s;i&s;tance can be expected; they will not be able to defend their own &s;tate again&s;t the de&s;igning ambitious King of Pru&s;&s;ia. That great Monarch will not for|get the ill treatment he has received from England;
<PB N="211" REF="013991_0007_0F9259178F9DC5B0">Civil war here will afford him the long wi&s;hed for opportunity.</P>
<P>Our &s;tanding army (if any part &s;hould be ba&s;e enough, to fight for tyrants, and the benefit of be|ing &s;laves,) will be fully employed; &s;uch part of it as is truly Engli&s;h, will join their countrymen, and put a final period to de&s;poti&s;m and corruption.</P>
<P>The con&s;titutional, and the only con&s;titutional force of this Kingdom, the militia, will not fail to &s;ignalize them&s;elves in defence of Liberty, in this unhappy period will the patriotic Spirit be &s;till? by what foreign power, amid&s;t this confu&s;ion at home, is America, at la&s;t, to be protected, or en&s;laved? by which of her friends the French or the Spaniards? Our &s;tanding army will be too much wanted here to afford fre&s;h &s;uccour to Burgoyne.</P>
<P>Does that idle notion prevail, any longer in this century, which &s;upplied King Charles the fir&s;t with forces and recruits, in the la&s;t; when that ble&s;&s;ed martyr, endeavoured to &s;ubdue this country to his de&s;potic will by force of arms? Is pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance, and the divine rights of tyrants, of any weight even with the lowe&s;t of the people? Is not the idea and &s;pirit of liberty univer&s;al &s;till? is the inva&s;ion of its rights a &s;ecret? It is true that we have long lived in an age of venality and corruption, but we al&s;o live in an age of rea&s;on and di&s;cernment. The meane&s;t individual among us knows that he has a right to call his life, liberty and property his own, and will die in their defence.</P>
<P>A fooli&s;h and wicked King like the pre&s;ent ef|ects, the power of a de&s;pot; a patriot King u&s;es the authority of a parent. A &s;acrifice to public liberty could not be grateful to a patriot King, it would
<PB N="212" REF="013991_0008_0F925918459926B8">&s;ully his glory, and di&s;appoint his views. To a weak or a de&s;igning Prince liberty is odious, it is an object of perpetual terror and alarm. Under the reign of one, the lives and properties of the &s;ubject are no longer valuable, then whil&s;t they are employed to promote the wi&s;e ends of paternal government, com|mon good; under the other, they are u&s;ele&s;s, unle&s;s they are exerted for the public &s;afety, The people live in allegiance to the one, and in league again&s;t the other; the one reaps all the fruits of national confidence and affection, the other feels all the weight of general di&s;tru&s;t, and all the ignominy of individual de&s;truction, the one has no favourites, and the other has no enemies. The readie&s;t obedi|ence waits upon the father? and the bittere&s;t exe|crations pur&s;ue the de&s;pot of a country.</P>
