<P>AN apology for the appearance of the&s;e &s;heets at the pre&s;ent period, may be con&s;idered as needle&s;s by &s;ome, whil&s;t others view them as an intru&s;ion on the public, and declare them ill-timed and unnece&s;&s;ary; but, to one who has the real good and pro&s;perity of the Church at heart, their appearance <HI>at this time</HI> is deem|ed indi&s;pen&s;ibly requi&s;ite, when it is undeniably true, that "by far the greater part of tho&s;e who enter into the mini&s;try, do not preach agreeably to the articles which they have &s;ub&s;cribed;" perhaps without know|ing or duly con&s;idering what are <HI>the doctrines of our excellent Church.</HI></P>
<P>AND another inducement may be particulari&s;ed, which ari&s;es from ob&s;ervation, that many well-meaning per|&s;ons, through want of in&s;truction in <HI>the&s;e doctrines,</HI> mi&s;take the <HI>form</HI> of Godline&s;s for Religion, and the <HI>works</HI> of the Law for the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and &s;tum|ble at the <HI>only</HI> way of life and &s;alvation, to their own misfortune, and the injury of Chri&s;tianity.</P>

<HEAD>THE DOCTRINES <HI>of the</HI> CHURCH, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>CHRISTIANITY is a pure, perfect, rational, con&s;i&s;tent &s;y&s;tem; it is a revelation worthy of the God of Truth and Wi&s;dom to di&s;pen&s;e; its doctrines have a direct tendency to moralize the powers and faculties, and to ennoble and dignify the human nature; it &s;ets its true profe&s;&s;ors free from ridiculous ab&s;urdities and enthu&s;ia&s;tic delu&s;ions; for its divine Author taught no doctrines, enjoined no precepts, but &s;uch as will bear the &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny, and mu&s;t be owned, by every truly wi&s;e and judicious per&s;on, to be well adapted and nicely calculated, at once to di&s;play the power and mercy of God, as well as to enrich, con&s;olate and make happy the mind of every true Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>But how an in&s;titution, thus wi&s;ely de&s;igned, order|ed and e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;hould be &s;o greatly mi&s;taken, &s;o unhappily perverted, and &s;o gro&s;sly mi&s;repre&s;ented <HI>at this day,</HI> is no le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ing than true; and therefore how much to be deplored and lamented! But why is this? How mu&s;t we account for the many delu&s;ive te|nets and de&s;tructive errors, which are indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated by a &s;et of <HI>modern teachers,</HI> and readily em|braced by &s;o many profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity? How! why, as the Papi&s;ts mi&s;takingly a&s;&s;ert ignorance to be the mother of devotion, we may truly &s;ay, ignorance is the parent of error, folly and delu&s;ion. But to what
<PB N="6" REF="025405_0005_0FCD2670A44431E8">
kind of ignorance may we a&s;cribe the mi&s;takes of the teachers, and the folly of the people in being thus de|ceived? Doubtle&s;s to an ignorance of the word of God, the Holy Scriptures, which are the only &s;ure guide, the be&s;t &s;tandard, and the mo&s;t certain criterion, whereby to di&s;cern truth from fal&s;ehood, right from wrong; but through neglect of &s;earching tho&s;e &s;acred pages, the poor people ea&s;ily become a prey to every ignorant <HI>en|thu&s;ia&s;tic preacher</HI> who comes in their way. Hence we &s;ee &s;uch a plentiful production of novel doctrines, and &s;uch an abundant fruitfulne&s;s of extravagant follies and de&s;tructive errors, which are &s;o prevalent among us.</P>
<P>Men, bretheren and fathers, &s;ee ye not what an inun|dation of error and delu&s;ion hath broken in upon us? Ob&s;erve ye not the overflowings of immorality and vice, which, like a torrent, is over&s;preading our land? Can ye be unconcerned, when the dreadful effects, and baneful con&s;equences are &s;o vi&s;ible and evident? Alas! <HI>Virtue</HI> reclines her fainting head; <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> has lo&s;t its powerful influence upon its profe&s;&s;ors; and therefore the practice of morality and good works is &s;o much neglected, &s;o little attended to. Surely it is too plain to be denied, the true principles of the Go&s;pel are for&s;aken. O ye mini&s;ters! ye profe&s;&s;ed teachers and in&s;tructors of mankind! will <HI>ye</HI> not attempt to &s;tem the rapid torrent, which threatens to carry all before it? There is no way left, but to <HI>retreat</HI> to the primitive doctrines of the Go&s;pel, the e&s;tabli&s;hed principles of the Reformation. The&s;e, con&s;tantly in&s;i&s;ted on and powerfully inculcated, will, nay, <HI>the&s;e</HI> only can be at|tended with the happy effects of reclaiming the people from error, rectifying their principles, and effectually producing chri&s;tian practices. As for you, my bretheren, profe&s;&s;ors of the &s;ame Go&s;pel, let me entreat and con|jure you, if you would be <HI>true prote&s;tants,</HI> again&s;t the fallacy and deceit of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> as you would de&s;ire to be proof again&s;t all doctrines of novelty, all

erroneous principles, all dangerous and delu&s;ive tenets; would you perceive and detect, &s;o as to beware of de|ceiving teachers, fal&s;e prophets, hypocritical and pre|tended mini&s;ters: in one word, are ye &s;olicitous to come to the knowledge of the truth as it is in Je&s;us, that ye may be &s;aved? SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES; make this your con&s;tant practice; for be a&s;&s;ured, ye are in the ut|mo&s;t danger of being mi&s;led and deceived, never more &s;o than at pre&s;ent. On the one hand, by the proud, &s;elf-pre&s;uming, God-re&s;i&s;ting <HI>infidel;</HI> on the other, by the credulous, un&s;criptural, unmeaning <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;t.</HI> While the former is an open enemy to the doctrines of the Go&s;pel, totally rejects every article of the chri&s;tian faith, acts as far wide from the moralizing precepts of the Go&s;pel, as from humility; the latter, <HI>the enthu&s;ia&s;t,</HI> deceives him&s;elf and others by his mere pretences to <HI>in&s;piration;</HI> profe&s;&s;es to have received the gift of the Spirit, but gives <HI>no evidences</HI> to a&s;certain the truth of it; makes &s;olemn declarations of being <HI>inwardly moved by the Holy Gho&s;t</HI> to preach to you, and only <HI>pretends</HI> to pray to God for &s;piritual operations, influences, and impre&s;&s;ions; when after all, it is plain to the eye of di&s;|cerning rea&s;on, he means nothing but to make gain of his preten&s;ions to Godline&s;s; for, contrary to his mo&s;t &s;olemn preten&s;ions and profe&s;&s;ions, <HI>he utterly denies any true, real, inward motive, operation, and influence of the Spirit:</HI> and hence do &s;uch mini&s;ters bewilder, perplex, and delude the ignorant and unwary, by teaching un|&s;ound, un&s;criptural doctrine.</P>
<P>Take heed to your&s;elves. Beware of &s;uch pretend|ed teachers, for you are liable to be led by &s;uch into a maze of anti-chri&s;tian errors, and a wilderne&s;s of un|&s;criptural perplexities; &s;o that your danger, through their means, may not ea&s;ily be e&s;caped, nor ever rec|tified. It is not a trifling affair I am now addre&s;&s;ing you about, but it is of the utmo&s;t concern, and of the greate&s;t importance: no le&s;s than your immortal &s;ouls
<PB N="8" REF="025405_0007_0FCD26750C035528">
are at &s;take&mdash;nothing le&s;s than an eternity depends upon your being <HI>wi&s;e unto &s;alvation.</HI> For your &s;akes, and from a regard to your &s;afety, &s;uffer me here to lay be|fore you the truly &s;criptural orthodox articles of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church of England, which, as they are a kind of epitome, or abridgement of the Go&s;pel, I &s;hall &s;elect &s;uch of them as may be&s;t &s;erve our pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e; namely, to try and examine doctrines and teachers by, to detect error and di&s;cover truth. By the&s;e let us determine our a&s;&s;ent to, or di&s;&s;ent from &s;uch doc|trines as are propo&s;ed to us, and I am verily per&s;uad|ed we &s;hall e&s;cape error, avoid delu&s;ion, and be freed from mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>Perhaps a fond attachment to our excellent articles of the Church of England, may influence me rather to fix on this form of &s;ound words than any other of human compo&s;ition. Be it &s;o; I am (I think) herein ju&s;tified, fora&s;much as the&s;e articles are &s;upported by, and built upon the Holy Scriptures: therefore I am unconcerned what our <HI>modern</HI> teachers, and new-pre|tended divines think or &s;ay of me; if they di&s;like, and are a&s;hamed of our articles, I am not: for all our Chri&s;tian Bi&s;hops, (God ble&s;s them!) and all our Church Par&s;ons, (Lord have mercy on them!) <HI>they</HI> all own, or have owned them, and &s;ub&s;cribed to them; yes, and <HI>&s;worn</HI> to them al&s;o; and they are printed in our Common-Prayer Books too;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They are omitted in the la&s;t American edition. A commencement, the re&s;ult of which I fear.</NOTE> and for what u&s;e think ye but that we &s;hould read them, know them, be in&s;tructed in them, and always abide by them? God grant, bretheren, that we may! for if we have any knowledge and experience of the great truths they contain, vain will be all the artful attempts, &s;ubtle de|&s;igns, and nefarious &s;tratagems of men de&s;titute of the truth, to mi&s;lead, pervert, or delude us.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now lay the articles before you&mdash;make &s;ome
<PB N="9" REF="025405_0008_0FCD267687AAB908">
&s;trictures upon them, and draw &s;ome applications from them as I go along. God give us a right judgment. We begin with the doctrine <HI>of Original or Birth Sin,</HI> Art. IX.</P>
<P><Q>Original &s;in &s;tandeth not in the following of <HI>Adam,</HI> (as the <HI>Pelagians</HI> do vainly talk) but it is the fault and corruption of the nature of every man, that is gendered of the offspring of <HI>Adam,</HI> whereby man is far gone from original righteou&s;ne&s;s, and is of his own nature inclined to evil.</Q></P>
<P>This the Pelagians of old denied, and this the <HI>mo|dern Pelagians,</HI> who pretend to great knowledge, while ignorant of them&s;elves, and &s;trangers to the corruption and depravity of their own hearts, <HI>di&s;own.</HI> Though, at the &s;ame time, they are &s;tanding monuments of the truth of this doctrine, and whether they believe and confe&s;s it, or not, their outward actions plainly evince the inhering power of original &s;in; their not &s;eeing, not knowing, and not <HI>feeling</HI> it, is one of the &s;tronge&s;t proofs of their being under original blindne&s;s and in&s;en|&s;ibility. And yet, many &s;uch as the&s;e truly &s;et up for guides and teachers of others. Know them, bretheren; di&s;cern them you may, you ought; and &s;uch, for your &s;oul's &s;ake avoid. Attend not to their &s;weet &s;iren &s;ongs, le&s;t you are thereby lulled a&s;leep upon the waves of de&s;truction. Take the&s;e marks with you. Judge of their doctrines by them: for our articles plainly declare the mi&s;erable &s;tate and condition of every man that is born into the world; fir&s;t, in the lo&s;s of original righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, or the image of God; and &s;econdly, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a contrary image; therefore is he of his own na|ture inclined to evil. Here behold the true picture of the <HI>&s;o much boa&s;ted</HI> dignity of human nature! Thus is man pointed out by the article; thus is man de&s;cribed by the oracles of truth; and to this melancholy account doth every Chri&s;tian &s;ub&s;cribe, and every natural, un|regenerate man's actions fully demon&s;trate. Aye, but,
<PB N="10" REF="025405_0009_0FCD26781087C020">
&s;ay our <HI>new doctors</HI> and <HI>modern teachers,</HI> this is too dark a &s;hade, too &s;able a dre&s;s, too degrading to human na|ture; and therefore they tickle the ears, plea&s;e the pride, and flatter the vanity of men, with <HI>their</HI> unedifying, un&s;criptural harangues, and fal&s;e encomiums on the moral rectitude, virtue, and <HI>dignity of man.</HI> But, bre|theren, would ye not avoid an un&s;kilful <HI>quack</HI> in &s;ur|gery, who, in&s;tead of &s;earching and probing a wound in order to procure the &s;oundne&s;s and health of the body, &s;hould &s;lightly heal and &s;kin over the parts aggrieved, while putrefaction and rottenne&s;s are at the bottom, whereby the life of the patient is de&s;troyed? <HI>Quacks in divinity</HI> are much more to be dreaded, ina&s;much as the life of the &s;oul is of infinitely more value than that of the body. I have heard our <HI>true, &s;taunch church mini|&s;ters</HI> di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e flatterers of human nature by the appellations of <HI>merit-mongers, velvet-mouthed preachers,</HI> &amp;c. Significant indeed! <HI>St. Paul</HI> de&s;cribes &s;uch, as tho&s;e who <HI>&s;erve not the Lord Je&s;us, but their own bellies,</HI> and with fine words and fair &s;peeches deceive the hearts of the &s;imple: for as they don't preach agreeable to the articles, &s;o neither do they u&s;e &s;cripture language, nor apo&s;tolic diction, in their compo&s;itions.&mdash;Our article next declares&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>Therefore in every per&s;on born into the world, it de&s;erves <HI>God's wrath and damnation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>What a terrible har&s;h phra&s;e is here? God's wrath and damnation! <Q>Ah, &s;ay our <HI>new-fangled teachers,</HI> our modern divines, we are not &s;o uncharitable as to &s;uppo&s;e any per&s;on in the world de&s;erving of God's wrath and damnation.&mdash;What a &s;trange, unpolite, uncouth &s;et of men were the compilers of the&s;e arti|cles!</Q></P>
<P>Say you &s;o! pray let me ob&s;erve, that however fa|&s;hionable this doctrine may be thought by &s;ome, how|ever ob&s;olete and har&s;h the expre&s;&s;ions may &s;eem to others of <HI>our airy, fa&s;hionable preachers,</HI> truth it is; it is
<PB N="11" REF="025405_0010_0FCD26798B4711D8">
the doctrine of &s;cripture, and tho&s;e venerable compilers &s;pake as <HI>the oracles of God.</HI> And is it not better, far better, for &s;inners to hear and be made &s;en&s;ible of their danger, and <HI>de&s;erving of God's wrath and damnation,</HI> &s;o as to e&s;cape it <HI>now</HI> by flying to Je&s;us, the only refuge for &s;inners, than to be blinded by flattering deceivers, till they fall a &s;acrifice to God's wrath and damnation in a dreadful eternity hereafter? This you mu&s;t a&s;&s;ent to&mdash;this you will not deny.</P>
<P>But our article further declares, "this infection of nature doth remain, yea, in them that are regenerated." <HI>Regenerated!</HI> how? By <HI>infant bapti&s;m only?</HI> No&mdash; The regenerate do not re&s;t on the outward and vi&s;ible &s;ign, but are made partakers of the inward and &s;piri|tual grace <HI>al&s;o.</HI> By the quickening and purifying ope|rations of the Holy Spirit, a principle of &s;piritual life is implanted in them; (and take this by the way, without experiencing <HI>this,</HI> infant bapti&s;m will not, cannot profit any per&s;on to &s;alvation:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What &s;aith the good Bi&s;hop Latimer on this &s;ubject?&mdash;"EXCEPT A MAN BE BORN AGAIN" FROM ABOVE, "HE CANNOT SEE THE KINGDOM OF GOD. He mu&s;t have a regeneration. And what is this regeneration? It is not to be chri&s;tened in water, as THESE [i. e. the PAPISTS] would have it. How is it to be expounded then? St. Peter &s;heweth, that one place of &s;cripture declareth another. St. Peter &s;aith, AND WE BE BORN AGAIN. How? NOT BY MORTAL SEED, BUT BY IMMORTAL. What is this immortal &s;eed? BY THE WORD OF THE LIVING GOD: by the word of God preached and opened. Thus cometh in our new birth&mdash;This is a great commendation of this office of preaching. It is God's in&s;trument, whereby he worketh faith in our hearts."</NOTE>) &s;o that &s;uch, and &s;uch only, are &s;en&s;ible of the different <HI>lu&s;tings of the fle&s;h and of the Spirit;</HI> and though there is <HI>no condemnation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> united to him by a <HI>faith of divine operation,</HI> and are &s;anctified by his Holy Spirit, "yet concupi&s;cence and lu&s;t, &s;aith the article, (that is, the inward de&s;ires and inclinations of the fle&s;h) hath the nature of &s;in." Therefore all true believers are &s;aid to <HI>rejoice in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and have no confidence in the fle&s;h.</HI> Phil. iii. 3.</P>
<P>But alas! in the&s;e days too many think, if the out|ward actions are &s;omewhat decent, moral and regular,
<PB N="12" REF="025405_0011_0FCD267B0B7D2980">
there needeth no thought or concern about inward depra|vity and heart-wickedne&s;s. But what amazing horror and dread will &s;eize on &s;uch, when a heart-&s;earching God &s;hall di&s;cover before angels and men, the hypo|cri&s;y, <HI>deceitfulne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>de&s;perate wickedne&s;s</HI> of the heart, and to the &s;peechle&s;s condemnation of all mi&s;erable <HI>daubers</HI> and &s;oul-deceivers! they will then find <HI>the filthy rags of their own righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> in&s;ufficient to &s;creen them from the wrath of the Lord, and they &s;hall be forced to own (when too late) that their inward parts were very wickedne&s;s, and therefore that they &s;tood in need of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to ju&s;tify them, and the power of <HI>his</HI> &s;pirit to renew <HI>them</HI> in the &s;pirit of their minds.</P>
<P>As the former article &s;hews the wretchedne&s;s and &s;in|fulne&s;s of our e&s;tate by nature, the next (10) a&s;&s;erts the helple&s;&s;ne&s;s and in&s;ufficiency of our condition.</P>
<P><Q>The condition of man &s;ince the fall of <HI>Adam</HI> is &s;uch, that he cannot turn and prepare him&s;elf by his own natural &s;trength and good works, to faith and calling upon God. Wherefore we have no power to do good works plea&s;ant and acceptable to God, with|out the grace of God by Chri&s;t preventing us, that we may have a good will, and working with us when we have that good will.</Q></P>
<P>Deceivers will come, &s;aith the &s;cripture; we believe it, &s;aith our Church, and therefore we <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h articles</HI> at once <HI>to &s;ettle the judgment of our members,</HI> and to guard them from erroneous novelty. And are not the&s;e de|ceivers already come? Is not their name Legion? Do not ARMINIAN teachers &s;warm among us, who tell us, that man has free-will and power to turn and prepare him&s;elf, and to do good works, as a condition to entitle him&s;elf to the merits of Chri&s;t, and to recommend him&s;elf to the favour of God? Are not the&s;e the fa|vourite doctrines of this day? Don't we con&s;tantly hear &s;uch un&s;criptural, antichri&s;tian tenets daily advanc|ed, both from the pulpit, and the <HI>pre&s;s?</HI></P>

the avowed tenet of their Church, to deny and ex|plode the doctrine of ju&s;tification, by the imputed righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t through faith only&mdash;but our only pretended <HI>prote&s;tant</HI> teachers a&s;&s;ent to it, in the articles of our Church, <HI>as a mo&s;t whole&s;ome doctrine, and very full of godly comfort,</HI> and yet afterwards publicly preach and inveigh again&s;t it, and brand and &s;tigma|tize <HI>the CONTENDERS</HI> for this &s;cripture-truth, as <HI>a &s;et of madmen, enthu&s;ia&s;ts, and deceivers.</HI> Surpri&s;ing indeed is &s;uch a &s;hare of a&s;&s;urance!

O how can &s;uch mini&s;ters look on this article without being filled with &s;hame and confu&s;ion of face! The Scrip|tures are clear and expre&s;s, that &s;inners are ju&s;tified by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, imputed to them through faith, and by no other means; therefore this is a mo&s;t WHOLESOME DOCTRINE.

<P>But does our Church depreciate good works, or deny their u&s;efulne&s;s? No; neither do any of its <HI>true</HI> mini|&s;ters or members; they all a&s;&s;ent to the doctrines of the XIIth Article, that</P>

<P>It is the device of the devil to urge, and it ari&s;eth from ignorance of the nature of true chri&s;tian faith to object, that the doctrine of ju&s;tification by faith de|&s;troys

the practice of morality and good works. Quite the contrary, for it is the peculiar property of true chri&s;tian faith to di&s;po&s;e us to holine&s;s of heart, and to the practice of morality and good works.</P>
<P>What a con&s;i&s;tency of doctrine! What a harmony of divine truth! What a chain of &s;cripture-tenets do our excellent articles afford us!

<P>You &s;ee, bretheren, that good works are the fruits of faith. Have you received of God the gift of faith; faith in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whereby you are ju&s;|tified? Are your con&s;ciences clean&s;ed from the guilt, and delivered from the condemnation of &s;in? And do you po&s;&s;e&s;s pardon and peace from God? Then I am &s;ure you mu&s;t love God; and love is the mo&s;t powerful and availing principle to produce good works, <Q>plea&s;ant and acceptable to God in Chri&s;t;</Q> for only in Chri&s;t Je&s;us is it our works are accepted. The be&s;t works we can perform cannot put away our &s;ins, and endure the &s;everity of God's judgment: <Q>But good works &s;pring out nece&s;&s;arily of a true faith:</Q> they are true marks and evidences of a lively faith, as the fruitful|ne&s;s of a tree is an unan&s;werable proof of the life and &s;oundne&s;s of the root. Hence we &s;ee by the plain &s;en&s;e of the articles, that without faith in our Lord Je&s;us no good works can be produced; and yet truly we find many, who pretend to be the only true orthodox teach|ers of our Church, con&s;tantly exploding and vehe|mently denying the doctrine of <HI>ju&s;tification by faith only.</HI> Therefore it is a plain con&s;equence and natural deduc|tion, that the only marks &s;uch give of their <HI>orthodoxy</HI> is, that they have neither <HI>faith</HI> nor <HI>good works,</HI> not|with&s;tanding all the noi&s;e they make about good works.

<P>Archbi&s;hop <HI>Cranmer</HI> (who certainly had a principal hand in the reformation) in the preface to his book again&s;t Bi&s;hop <HI>Gardiner,</HI> writes thus: <Q>Our Saviour Chri&s;t, according to the will of his eternal Father, when the time thereof was fully accompli&s;hed, tak|ing our nature upon him, came into the world from the high throne of his Father, to give light to them that were in darkne&s;s, and in the &s;hadow of death, and to preach and give pardon and full remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins to all his <HI>elected.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Bi&s;hop <HI>Latimer,</HI> another of the reformers, is more expre&s;s on this point.

it is no matter what&s;oever we do; for if we be cho&s;en to everla&s;ting life, we &s;hall have it.&mdash;And &s;o they have opened a door to them&s;elves of all wickedne&s;s and car|nal liberty, again&s;t the true meaning of the &s;cripture.</Q></P>
<P>That Dr. <HI>Ridley,</HI> another reformer, &s;uppo&s;ed re|demption to be limited to a certain number, the follow|ing pa&s;&s;age clearly evinces: <Q>The death and pa&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t our Saviour was, and is, the one, only, &s;uffi|cient, and everla&s;ting availing Sacrifice, SATISFAC|TORY FOR ALL THE ELECT OF GOD, from Adam the fir&s;t, to the la&s;t that &s;hall be born in the end of the world.</Q> <HI>See Fox, vol.</HI> iii. <HI>p.</HI> 440.</P>

<P>The doctrine of ab&s;olute prede&s;tination to life is at pre&s;ent little under&s;tood&mdash;<Q>It has been &s;o gro&s;sly mi&s;|repre&s;ented, and loaded with &s;uch horrid con&s;equences, that by far the greater part of profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians will not give it a patient hearing. The very mention of it will fill their hearts with indignation, and their mouths with har&s;h expre&s;&s;ions; which have been re|ceived without con&s;ideration, and being repeated often, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be true, and &s;o pa&s;s for &s;olid, conclu&s;ive arguments. What! would you make God the author of &s;in? Can you &s;uppo&s;e an infinitely merciful Being made &s;o many creatures to be damned? What does it &s;ignify then how we live? for if we are to be damned we &s;hall be damned, let us live ever &s;o well; and if we
<PB N="28" REF="025405_0027_0FCD26961939A058">
are to be &s;aved we &s;hall be &s;aved, let us live ever &s;o vilely. The&s;e, and the like ab&s;urdities, are ever ready to be poured out again&s;t it. On the other hand, the article &s;ays, <HI>They which be endued with &s;o excellent a benefit of God,</HI> viz. of being prede&s;tinated to everla&s;ting &s;alvation, as ve&s;&s;els made to honour; <HI>they be made like the image of his only begotten Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t; they walk religiou&s;ly in good works:</HI> So that they who are pre|de&s;tinated to &s;alvation, are likewi&s;e prede&s;tinated to holine&s;s. The Apo&s;tle &s;ays, 'God hath cho&s;en us in him (Chri&s;t), that we &s;hould be holy and without blame before him in love.' <HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> i. 4. 'God hath from the beginning cho&s;en you to &s;alvation, through &s;anctification of the Spirit.' 2 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> ii. 13. They therefore who do not walk religiou&s;ly in good works, deceive them&s;elves, and wre&s;t the &s;criptures to their own de&s;truction, if they &s;uppo&s;e they are prede&s;|tinated to everla&s;ting life, cho&s;en in Chri&s;t before the foundation of the world. And they who, through faith in Chri&s;t, do walk religiou&s;ly in good works, have not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to imagine they are not prede&s;tinated, or &s;hall be damned; becau&s;e they are walking in the way which God hath appointed that all &s;hall walk in, whom he hath cho&s;en to everla&s;ting &s;alvation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That there is an ab&s;olute, unconditional prede&s;|tination of certain per&s;ons to eternal life, is abun|dantly evident from the &s;criptures, and &s;ufficiently proved by the pa&s;&s;ages lately mentioned. It may not, however, be improper to add a few more. 'To &s;it on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give; but it &s;hall be given to them of whom it is pre|pared of my father.' <HI>Matt.</HI> xx. 23. 'Fear not, lit|tle flock; for it is your father's good plea&s;ure to give you the kingdom.' <HI>Luke</HI> xii. 32. 'I give unto them eternal life; and they &s;hall never peri&s;h; nei|ther &s;hall any pluck them out of my hand.' <HI>John</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="025405_0028_0FCD26978B800BC8">
x. 28. 'Having prede&s;tinated us unto the adop|tion of children by Je&s;us Chri&s;t to him&s;elf, according to the good plea&s;ure of his will, to the prai&s;e of the glory of his grace.' <HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> i. 5, 6. 'Who hath &s;aved us, and <HI>called</HI> us by an holy calling <HI>not accord|ing to our works,</HI> but according to his own purpo&s;e and grace which was given us in Chri&s;t Je&s;us before the world began.' 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> i. 9.

<P>Indeed, if a <HI>proper</HI> attention be paid to the doctrines contained in the <HI>articles,</HI> we &s;hall find that the&s;e things mu&s;t be &s;o.&mdash;<Q>For if we bring into the world &s;uch a corrupt nature, as de&s;erveth God's wrath and dam|nation (Art. IX.)&mdash;if the condition of man after the fall is &s;uch that he cannot, in his own &s;trength, turn unto faith and calling upon God (Art. X.)&mdash;if be|fore we are ju&s;tified and made partakers of that grace, which will a&s;&s;uredly end in eternal glory; all that we are apt to call good works, <HI>are not plea&s;ant and acceptable to God, do not make us meet to receive his grace, but have the nature of</HI> &s;in." (Art. XIII.)&mdash; How is it po&s;&s;ible that any man &s;hould be &s;aved, un|le&s;s God had ordained him to eternal life? But if God hath prede&s;tinated &s;ome to eternal life and not others, is there not inju&s;tice with him? By no means; for all have &s;inned and come &s;hort of the glory of God. The depravity of our nature de&s;erveth God's wrath and damnation: &s;o that if he had left the whole human race to peri&s;h, there would have been no inju&s;tice in him, for all de&s;erved to peri&s;h. An in&s;tance of which vindictive, unrelenting ju&s;tice, we have in the ca&s;e of the fallen angels&mdash;Not one of tho&s;e many myriads of once glorious beings will be &s;aved&mdash;Not one of them <HI>ever had,</HI> or <HI>will have</HI> the di&s;covery of mercy made to him. In&s;tead, there|fore,
<PB N="30" REF="025405_0029_0FCD26990CA7C2E8">
of arraigning the Almighty of &s;everity or in|ju&s;tice in &s;uffering perhaps the greater part of man|kind to peri&s;h in their &s;ins; we &s;hould extol that mercy by which he hath prede&s;tinated &s;o many mil|lions to eternal life, to the adoption of children, to the prai&s;e of the glory of his grace; when he might ju&s;tly have left them to peri&s;h as well as others, &s;ince they had as ju&s;tly de&s;erved it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This frightful doctrine then of prede&s;tination a|mounts to this: All mankind are by nature children of wrath&mdash;without &s;trength&mdash;enmity again&s;t God. The Almighty, who fore&s;aw this would be the con|&s;equence of the fall, decreed from everla&s;ting to de|liver from cur&s;e and damnation tho&s;e whom he hath cho&s;en in Chri&s;t to everla&s;ting &s;alvation, and to leave the re&s;t to peri&s;h in their &s;ins. When a king has &s;ub|dued his rebellious &s;ubjects, he grants a free pardon to &s;ome, and orders others for execution. Can you conceive he is guilty of inju&s;tice in ordering &s;ome for death when they have de&s;erved it? Are you not rather inclined to commend his clemency in &s;paring &s;ome who have de&s;erved to die? Con&s;ider mankind as fallen in Adam, and the ca&s;e is exactly parallel. Unle&s;s you choo&s;e to look upon this as an exception, that of all who have heard the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, none will be found in the number of tho&s;e who were not prede&s;tinated to eternal life, but &s;uch as have wil|fully rejected the coun&s;el of God again&s;t them&s;elves.</Q></P>

<P>Ah! &s;ays a con&s;tant church-goer, <Q>I heard one of <HI>the&s;e</HI> preachers at our Church lately, where he preach|ed &s;uch a &s;ermon about conver&s;ion, the new-birth, ju&s;tification by faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in&s;piration, and &s;anctification of the Spirit, and a heap of &s;uch&mdash;I know not what!&mdash;aye, and he &s;aid <HI>downright,</HI> that all unconverted people were in a &s;tate of damnation, and that nothing could &s;ave them from <HI>hell,</HI> but be|lieving on the Lord Je&s;us; he really turned the pa|ri&s;h
<PB N="34" REF="025405_0033_0FCD26A01E26FA98">
up&s;ide down, for we are never u&s;ed to &s;uch &s;ort of doctrine; no, not we. But in the afternoon, <HI>our par&s;on</HI> preached a &s;ermon again&s;t all &s;uch doctrines, for he is an enemy to all &s;uch preachers and their principles; and though he was but <HI>little more</HI> than a quarter of an hour in his &s;ermon, yet he paid them off about their in&s;piration and faith, &amp;c. and made us all ea&s;y again too: O, he's a plea&s;ing man! He told us, <HI>We were in no danger of going to hell, and that there was no fear of our being damned, for we are all very good chri&s;tians, if we but pay every one their own, and do as we would be done by.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Surely at <HI>this</HI> day, is that word fulfilled, THE PRO|PHETS PROPHESY FALSELY, AND THE PEOPLE LOVE TO HAVE IT SO. For truly, reader, the preaching of too many who call them&s;elves mini&s;ters of our Church, is more like heatheni&s;h morality than &s;criptural chri&s;tia|nity.</P>
<P>If by an enthu&s;ia&s;t is meant a deceiver, one that <HI>fan|cies</HI> him&s;elf and <HI>pretends</HI> to be what in reality he is not; I declare to you, reader, I do not know a wor&s;e &s;ort of enthu&s;ia&s;m, nor a more dangerous &s;et of enthu&s;ia&s;ts and deceivers (deceivers both of them&s;elves and others; let common &s;en&s;e and right rea&s;on determine the point) than <HI>tho&s;e mini&s;ters,</HI> who &s;olemnly profe&s;s to be inwardly moved by the Holy Gho&s;t; pretend to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit at their ordination; a&s;&s;ent, &s;ub&s;cribe, and &s;wear to the articles of our Church, in which the nece&s;&s;ity of in&s;pirarion is &s;o &s;trongly in&s;i&s;ted on; u&s;e the mo&s;t excellent form of our Church Liturgy; con|&s;tantly pray to God for the in&s;piration, guidance, and operations of the Holy Spirit: and yet after all this, (O dreadful hypocri&s;y before God! O amazing &s;oul de|lu&s;ion!) can je&s;t, jeer at, and ridicule all &s;piritual influ|ences, and <HI>inward operations;</HI> and contemn the hone&s;t, faithful mini&s;ters of our Church; for what? Why, only becau&s;e they preach con&s;i&s;tent with the avowed
<PB N="35" REF="025405_0034_0FCD26A14BD9D428">
tenets of that Church they profe&s;s them&s;elves mini&s;ters of, and plainly declare &s;uch doctrines as their Articles, Homilies and Liturgy fully &s;et forth. Surely an hone&s;t heathen would blu&s;h at &s;uch behaviour. No wonder &s;uch are &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed and &s;et at nought, who make them&s;elves by their ab&s;urdity &s;o contemptible in the &s;ight of men.</P>
<P>But it is urged again&s;t our truly reverend and Go&s;pel-mini&s;ters, <Q>That they are not content with the com|mon and ordinary operations of the Spirit, but they talk of and contend for the extraordinary and mira|culous gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t; therefore they are <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;ts.</HI></Q> This is fal&s;e; they neither expect, nor &s;ee any nece&s;&s;ity for the miraculous gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t: But they contend (agreeable to &s;cripture) for the promi&s;ed inward gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit, to enlighten, convince, <HI>convert,</HI> and make happy the true Chri&s;tian, by his indwelling witne&s;s and comfortable pre&s;ence to the &s;oul.</P>
<P>Neither are their preten&s;ions to in&s;piration <Q><HI>un|grounded</HI> and <HI>unwarranted,</HI> (as &s;ome object) and there|fore &s;ay they are enthu&s;ia&s;ts.</Q> This kind of pre|ten&s;ion may be reduced to two &s;orts, for <HI>matter</HI> and for <HI>manner.</HI> For <HI>matter,</HI> when per&s;ons pretend to in&s;pira|tion of God for things contrary to &s;cripture, which God hath given us as a &s;tanding rule to the world's end. But our mini&s;ters pretend to no &s;uch in&s;piration; &s;eeing they con&s;tantly inculcate the doctrines of our Church which are agreeable to &s;cripture: yea they preach &s;uch in&s;piration <HI>only</HI> which the word of God promi&s;es to every true Chri&s;tian. Therefore they are not enthu&s;ia&s;ts.&mdash; For <HI>manner,</HI> when in&s;pirations are expected to exclude and &s;upercede the u&s;e of rea&s;on, &s;cripture, and all divine ordinances. Such as pretend to the&s;e are proper enthu&s;ia&s;ts. But other, our faithful and orthodox mi|ni&s;ters preach the rational &s;cripture doctrines of the Go&s;pel <HI>only.</HI> They don't &s;et up heathen morality in&s;tead
<PB N="36" REF="025405_0035_0FCD26A2C9449EA0">
of chri&s;tian practices, nor do they teach man's <HI>natural ability,</HI> to the exclu&s;ion of God's divine grace, nor ex|alt the <HI>works</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of &s;inful man, in order to &s;upercede and &s;et at nought the meritorious &s;acrifice and righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. No: but they in|&s;i&s;t on the rea&s;onablene&s;s of being endued with &s;piritual life, and &s;piritual power, in order to produce &s;piritual actions; they &s;cripturally teach, that faith, and every other good gift and grace is of the Spirit's <HI>in&s;piration;</HI> and they therefore direct &s;ouls to diligent attendance, and con&s;tant waiting on the ordinances, and to e&s;teem them as channels whereby God is u&s;ually plea&s;ed to in&s;pire the &s;oul with fre&s;h &s;upplies of divine grace and &s;piritual influences. Therefore they are not <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>By men of corrupt minds, de&s;titute of the truth, all the&s;e ancient doctrines of the Bible and our Church, are now deemed <HI>new doctrines;</HI> the preachers of them are railed again&s;t as innovators, and &s;ome are bold to a&s;|&s;ert, <Q>that they draw the people away from the Church and cau&s;e &s;chi&s;m.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A learned man of our Church, Mr. Hales of Eaton (England) was wont to &s;ay &s;chi&s;m and here&s;y are theological &s;carecrows, that is, they are too fre|quently made u&s;e of to terrify people without a cau&s;e.

of their forefathers, the doctrines of the reformation, but mu&s;t broach &s;ome new-fangled tenets; who cry out peace! peace! when there is no peace, and preach only the poor, dry, unavailing &s;y&s;tem of heatheni&s;h morali|ty, in&s;tead of the lively, animating, powerful, truly moralizing truths of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Therefore let Clericus, and his bretheren, who are &s;o often haranguing <HI>again&s;t &s;chi&s;m</HI> and &s;eparation, know, that the <HI>&s;chi&s;m</HI> reverberates, and the charge of &s;epara|tion recoils back upon them&s;elves, while they are guilty of &s;chi&s;m in doctrine, and cau&s;e divi&s;ions in the Church by &s;eparating from the precious truths, the avowed tenets of our excellent e&s;tabli&s;hment. Say, are the&s;e friends to the Church? rather, are they not its greate&s;t enemies? Yes, notwith&s;tanding their pretended zeal for the Church, 'tis from &s;uch as the&s;e that &s;he is in danger.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of &s;uch mini&s;ters the judicious Dr. Edwards thus writes in his Preacher, part 2. page 155&mdash;<Q>I know there is a great cry among &s;ome men of late, that the Church is in danger, that it is falling, that it, ruin and de&s;truction are approaching.

THEY ARE THE MEN that renounce the articles and determinations of our Church, and thereby &s;he is apparently en|dangered, and her ruin &s;eems not to be far off. But in the &s;en&s;e they mean it, (if they have any &s;en&s;e) it is a fal&s;e alarm, and a groundle&s;s fear, and the danger they talk of is imaginary.</Q></NOTE></P>
<P>But, there is one expedient, which, from my hearty zeal for our Church, and warm affection to the Clergy, I would humbly recommend to them&mdash;(O that they may be influenced to put it in practice!)&mdash;It is this, to preach con&s;tantly, maintain &s;teadily, and inculcate fer|vently the e&s;tabli&s;hed doctrines of our Church, the glo|rious truths of the reformation. Now, who would think there could be any objection to this method? Nay, there can be none; and I am &s;ure it will be prac|ti&s;ed by tho&s;e who really believe their bibles, and have

&s;o much con&s;cience as to think &s;olemn promi&s;es, oaths, and &s;ub&s;criptions are binding and obligatory upon them.</P>
<P>O, may the Lord of the harve&s;t increa&s;e the number of &s;uch faithful, con&s;cientious labourers! for from &s;uch a practice, what ble&s;&s;ed effects would follow! <HI>Ignorant</HI> profe&s;&s;ors would be in&s;tructed in the &s;aving doctrines of the Go&s;pel; the <HI>true</HI> members of our Church would be e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>the truth as it is in Je&s;us,</HI> and pre&s;erved from being mi&s;led by error and perverted by delu&s;ion; a glorious &s;pirit of reformation would &s;oon over&s;pread our land, and true religion, and the practice of morality and good works, would much more abound.</P>
