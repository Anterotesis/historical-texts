</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE <HI>Prophet</HI> in this Book pathetically la|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ents the mi&s;erable State of the <HI>Jews.</HI> And in this Chapter, after bewailing their Cala|mities He &s;ugge&s;ts to them &s;everal power|ful Arguments to per&s;wade them, to humble them&s;elves under the mighty Hand of God, to com|fort and encourage them&s;elves in his Goodne&s;s, Mer|cy and Faithfulne&s;s, and quietly to Hope and Wait for his Salvation. So that there can be no Doubt but that by the <HI>Yoke</HI> in the <HI>Text,</HI> He means the <HI>Yoke of Afflictions,</HI> which God had laid on them for their Iniquities, and which in the <HI>fir&s;t Chapter</HI> He calls the binding on them <HI>the Yoke of their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>That their <HI>Young Men</HI> particularly, &s;hould not too eagerly fret again&s;t God, nor abandon them&s;elves to Di&s;pair, He &s;ugge&s;ts to them, that there are <HI>peculiar Advantages</HI> in <HI>bearing Afflictions in Youth,</HI> which might &s;ilence their Complaints again&s;t the Conduct of Divine Providence, and teach them Patience and Submi&s;&s;ion to
<PB N="2" REF="004911_0004_100E190020D02D50">the Will of God. For as Afflictions are often nece&s;|&s;ary, and very u&s;eful to awaken carele&s;s Sinners out of their Security, and to &s;hew them their Mi&s;ery and Danger, and even to quicken humble and in&s;truct the Children of God; &s;o they are often peculiarly Advan|tageous in Youth, to teach us effectually true Wi&s;dom and Obedience to God betimes, and &s;o to prevent ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> going a&s;tray from God, and all the mi&s;erable Effects of a &s;inful Life: And particularly to prevent &s;everer Cha&s;ti&s;ements, which might otherwi&s;e be nece&s;&s;ary af|towards, to wean us from &s;inful Cour&s;es and reduce us to the right Ways of the Lord.</P>
<P>But as <HI>Religion</HI> in general is called in the <HI>Scripture,</HI> a <HI>Yoke,</HI> and as <HI>Afflictions</HI> are <HI>good</HI> only to prevent or take away Sin, and make us partakers of true Holine&s;s, and to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oduce the peacable Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s. &mdash; as they &s;erve to open the Ear to Di&s;cipline, and di&s;po&s;e us to bear <HI>the Yoke of In&s;truction,</HI> I propo&s;e to con&s;ider the Words only in this Light, as a&s;&s;erting <HI>there are peculiar Advantages of early Religion</HI> &mdash; A Subject which has been &s;o often handled, that no|thing new can be &s;aid upon it; and which ought ne|verthel&s;s to be frequently inculcated on Youth. And that both, becau&s;e it is in it &s;elf, of &s;uch va&s;t Importance to their temporal and eternal Welfare; and becau&s;e they have in general &s;uch a native Aver&s;ion and Re|luctance; becau&s;e they are &s;urrounded with &s;o many and &s;o dangerous Temptations; and are &s;o eager|ly inclin'd to walk in the Sight of their own Eyes, and in the Ways of their own Hearts; not &s;uffici|ently ob&s;erving, and regarding the <HI>natural Con&s;equen|ces</HI> of gratifying the corrupt De&s;ires of the Fle&s;h and of the Mind, nor remembring, that for all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e Things <HI>GOD will bring them into Judgment.</HI></P>

I. In the fir&s;t Place, I am to &s;hew that <HI>Religion in general may be compared to a Yoke.</HI></P>
<P>And 'tis &s;o called, Partly, as 'tis the Law, and Rule which God has given to guide and govern us; and as 'tis a Re&s;traint on the Pa&s;&s;ions and Appetites and a Burden on corrupt Nature. Accordingly, both the Apo&s;tles St. <HI>Paul</HI> and St. <HI>Peter</HI> call the <HI>Law of Mo&s;es,</HI> a <HI>Yoke.</HI> It was, it &s;eems, a cu&s;tomary <HI>Jewi&s;h Phra&s;e.</HI> And hence our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour u&s;es that Ex|pre&s;tion, <HI>Take my Yoke upon you;</HI> by which he plain|ly means his <HI>Religion,</HI> The Submi&s;&s;ion to his Authori|ty, the Belief of his Doctrine, the Imitation of his Example, and the Obedience to his Commandments. And,</P>
<P>This &s;hews us, what it is to <HI>take on us</HI> or <HI>bear the Yoke of Christ;</HI> It is <HI>to</HI> become his Di&s;ciples, to learn of him and to conform our &s;elves to the Rules of his Religion &mdash;</P>
<P>The&s;e are admirably &s;ummed up by St. <HI>Paul</HI> Tit. 2.11, 12. <HI>The Grace of God that bringeth Salvation. hath appeared unto all Men, teaching us, that deny|ing Ungodline&s;s, and worldly Lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly in this pre&s;ent World.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To take Chri&s;t</HI>'s <HI>Yoke on us,</HI> don't intend, a bare putting on a <HI>Form of Godline&s;s,</HI> that we yield &s;ome external Homage and Reverence to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;ubmit to his In&s;titutions, and call him <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Lord;</HI> but that we obey from the Heart the Form of Doctrine we have received from him; that we deny our &s;elves, take up the Cro&s;s, and follow Chri&s;t in the Regeneration, and &s;incerely practice his pure and undefiled Religion. That we truly copy after his mo&s;t perfect Example, and heartily obey his mo&s;t holy wi&s;e and ju&s;t Commands of Piety, and Purity, of Hu|milty, of Integrity and Charity; and that we endea|vour to clean&s;e our &s;elves from all filthine&s;s of the Fle&s;h and Spirit, and to perfect Holine&s;s in the Fear of God. In fine it implies, that our Hearts being purified by Faith in Chri&s;t, and being made free from the Law of Sin and Death, we become the Servants of God, and have our Fruit to Holine&s;s, that the End may be Life everla&s;ting.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="004911_0006_100E1901A1C245E0">
So that tho' real Chri&s;tianity, or true Religion is, and is called a <HI>Yoke,</HI> yet there is nothing in the Term when rightly under&s;tood, any more than in the Thing it &s;elf that may ju&s;tly prejudice us again&s;t it. It is a Yoke indeed, but &s;uch an one as is nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful in all Re&s;pects. For,</P>
<P N="2">II <HI>It is good for a Man to bear the Yoke of Religion. Je&s;us Christ</HI> him&s;elf has told us, <HI>His Yoke is ea&s;ie, and his Burden is light.</HI> And that it is the Way to <HI>find Re&s;t to our Souls</HI> It is evidently <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> and pro|per that we &s;hould &s;ubmit to the Laws of God, and how our W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lls to the Obedience of Chri&s;t. It is plainly <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> that we do &s;ooner or later, renounce and for&s;ake the Service of diver&s;e Lu&s;ts and Plea&s;ures, and that we believe and obey the Go&s;pel, if we would obtain the Forgivene&s;s of our Sins, and an Inheritance among them who are &s;anctified through Faith that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P><HI>The Obligations of Religion,</HI> ari&s;e out of the ab&s;olute Right and Authority of God in and over us, the Per|fection of his Nature, the Excellency Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s of his Laws, and the glorious Reward he has promi&s;ed to them that obey him. We are indi&s;|pen&s;ibly obliged to yield a &s;incere, and univer&s;al Obe|dience to the righteous and holy Will of God, our Creator, Pre&s;erver, and Redeemer, our &s;overeign Law|giver, and Judge. We are his, for he made us, and therefore we ought to &s;erve him; we are bought with a Price, even the precious Blood of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and therefore we ought to glorify God in our Body, and in our Spirit, which are his.</P>
<P><HI>The Advantages of true Religion are Infinite and Eternal.</HI> For the Lord will give Grace and Glory, and no good Thing will he withold from them that walk uprightly. His Favour is Life, and his Loving-Kind|ne&s;s is better than Life. <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is the Author of eternal Salvation, to all them that obey him. Godline&s;s is profitable to all Things, having the Pro|mi&s;e of the Life that now is, and of that which is to come. So that it is good to bear this Yoke. <HI>The Statutes of the Lord are right, and in the Keeping of them there is a great Reward.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="004911_0007_100E18D440AB8A10">
The real Advantage of Religion, appears from the <HI>Con&s;titution of Nature,</HI> and the <HI>Cour&s;e of Things</HI> which <HI>God has e&s;tabli&s;hed</HI> in <HI>this pre&s;ent World.</HI> For 'tis evident, that <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s really and naturally tend|eth to Life,</HI> and that he that pur&s;ueth Evil, pur&s;ueth it to his own Hurt. So has the Lord ordained, that the moral or Chri&s;tian Vertues, have a nece&s;&s;ary and &s;trong Tendency to the Peace and Chearfulne&s;s of the Mind, to the Health and Vigour of the Body, to the Good-Will and E&s;teem of others, and the Comfort and Tranquility of our whole Lives. While on the other Hand, there is a natural Tendency in the Ways of Sin, to all manner of Evil. So that it is evident|ly the Will of God, that we &s;hould live &s;oberly, right|eou&s;ly and godly in this pre&s;ent World, from the very Con&s;titution and Cour&s;e of Nature; for the Laws of Nature are manife&s;tly &s;anctioned by the God of Na|ture. And be&s;ides we may rea&s;onably believe the Lord will ble&s;s the Righteous, and encompa&s;s them with Favour as with a Shield. The Righteous Lord loveth the Righteous, his Eyes are upon them, and his Ears are open to their Cry<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; But the Face of the Lord, is &s;et again&s;t them that do Evil; be&s;ides the many Evils which naturally follow the Violation of his mo&s;t wi&s;e and holy Laws. So that if there was no future Life, but Death concluded our Exi&s;tence, it would be good for us to bear the Yoke of Religion <HI>(i. e.)</HI> to deny our &s;elves the unrea&s;onable Gratifica|tion of our Pa&s;&s;ions and Appetites, and to live accord|ing to the &s;trict Rules of Purity Truth and Righteou&s;|ne&s;s. It mu&s;t certainly be be&s;t in all Re&s;pects for us to live agreeably to the Nature God has given us and the Relations we bear to him and to our Fellow-Creatures. For of Nece&s;&s;ity, this mu&s;t be the Way to the Favour of God and the greate&s;t Degrees of Happine&s;s we are capable of. Hence the Wi&s;e-Man &s;ays, <HI>Happy is the Man that findeth Wi&s;dom, and the Man that getteth Under&s;tanding &mdash; All the Things thou can&s;t de&s;ire are not to be compared with her, Length of Days is in her right Hand, and in her left Hand Riches and Hon|our, her Ways are Ways of Plea&s;antne&s;s and all her Paths are Peace. But Thorns and Snares are in the Way of the Froward.&mdash;</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="004911_0008_100E1903238B03A8">
But if we con&s;ider our &s;elves as made to <HI>be im|mortal, and an Image of the divine Eternity.</HI> That our everla&s;ting Welfare and Happine&s;s depends on the Con|duct of our pre&s;ent Lives, becau&s;e God has appointed a Day in which he will judge the World in Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and render to every Man according to his Deeds done in the Body, even Indignation and Wrath, Tribu|lation and Angui&s;h on every Soul of Man that doeth Evil; and G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ry Honour and Immortality to them that continue in Welldoing &mdash;</P>
<P>This Renders it of infini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ely greater Con&s;equence and Nece&s;&s;ity to &s;ubmit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Yoke of God's Laws, and that it will be of eternal Advantage to fear God and work Righteou&s;ne&s;s or keep his Commandments.</P>
<P>And if we con&s;ider the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Sy&s;teme of the World the <HI>real Condition of Mankind,</HI> and the <HI>Method God has taken in his infinite Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s to redeem and &s;ave Sinners;</HI> the Nece&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y and Efficacy of true Religion, and &s;o its un&s;peakable Advantages will ap|pear in a va&s;tly &s;tronger Light. For it is plain we are <HI>fallen and Degenerate Creatures,</HI> in a State of Ruin, have lo&s;t the original Rectitude and Integrity of our Souls, alienated from God and at Enmity with his Laws, and at the &s;ame Time are under their condemn|ing Power; Children of Wrath, Servants of Sin, and Heirs of everla&s;ting Mi&s;ery and Vengeance &mdash; And that God &s;o loved the World, as to &s;end his only begotten and dearly beloved Son to expiate our Oflences, and reconcile us to God, to renew us in the Spirit of our Minds, and create us anew to good Works, to make an End of Sin and bring in an everla&s;ting Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that whoever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h but have everla&s;ting Life. This &s;hews us it is of the la&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity and Importance to receive Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord, and heartily &s;ubmit to his Authority; for how can we e&s;cape if we neglect &s;o great Salvation? It is nece&s;&s;ary we renounce and for&s;ake the Service of diver&s;e Lu&s;ts and Plea&s;ures, tho&s;e Lords that have had Dominion over us, and take on us Chri&s;t's Yoke, and Parn of him; that we not only call him Lord, but that we do the Things which he &s;aith, that we may be made Partakers of the Redemption purcha&s;ed by him. And if we through the Spirit mortine the Deeds
<PB N="7" REF="004911_0009_100E18D69D5DDA50">of the Body we &s;hall e&s;cape the &s;trange Puni&s;hment prepared for the Wicked, and &s;hall &s;tand before the Son of Man in his Kingdom for ever. For there is no Condemnation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us who walk not after the Fle&s;h but after the Spirit.</P>
<P>In fine as we are the Creatures and Subjects of God, it mu&s;t be good for us to love and fear him, and keep all his Commandments always, and that in Regard both to our temporal and eternal Wellare. And as we are fallen Creatures and enjoy the Priviledges of the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation it mu&s;t be good for us in the highe&s;t Degree to take on us the Yoke or Religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; becau&s;e there is no other Name given under Heaven whereby we can be &s;aved.</P>
<P>Thus it is good <HI>(i. e.)</HI> ju&s;t, nece&s;&s;ary, and of infi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ite Advantage to us to bear the Yoke of Religion. And &s;urely if it be &s;o in reality to &s;uch a Degree, it mu&s;t be always good, and there can be no Sea&s;on of Life, in which it is improper or di&s;advantageous. If it be nece&s;&s;ary, there can be no ju&s;t Rea&s;on or excu&s;e to neglect or delay it all, but the &s;ooner, the better we begin to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eturn to God from whom we have revolted and to &s;hun the Paths of the De&s;troyer and to work out our own Salvation. It mu&s;t therefore be <HI>good to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ar this Yoke in Youth,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the &s;trong Reluctance and Aver&s;ion we naturally have to the Re|&s;traints of Religion, and the violent Inclinations to put it off to a &s;urpo&s;ed more convenient Sea&s;on.

1. Fir&s;t I am to &s;hew you <HI>there are peculiar Advan|tages in Youth towards taking this Yoke of Religion upon us.</HI> As it is of the la&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity and Importance for us to apply our Hearts in good earne&s;t to Wi&s;dom or true Religion, &s;o it is acknowledged to be a very difficult Undertaking; for it is nothing le&s;s than to morti&s;y our Members, to crucify the Fle&s;h, and the World, to deny our &s;elves, to &s;et our Affections on Things above, and to walk by Faith and not by Sight. Tho' Chri&s;t's Yoke is truly light and ea&s;ie, in it &s;elf, to right Rea&s;on, or to a renewed Nature; and tho' in Keeping God's Commandments there is a great pre&s;ent and future Recompence of Reward; yet there is a Re|luctance in our corrupt Nature, the Carnal Mind is not &s;ubject to God's Laws, but is Enmity again&s;t them and would not have Chri&s;t to reign over us. It is there|fore one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rand Rea&s;on and Obligation on Youth, to take this Yoke on them betimes before all the Diffi|culties in the Way are unhappily encrea&s;ed and Multi|plied.

So that Youth has the va&s;t Advantage to take up Chri&s;t's Yoke before corrupt Nature is &s;trengthened by Indulgence, before we have had Time to contract &s;trong Habits of Negligence and Di&s;obedience, before the Cares of the World perplex us, and the Plea&s;ures of Life have en&s;laved us, before we have provoked God to take from us his holy Spirit, and while we have for our Encouragement in the arduous Conflict the expre&s;s A&s;&s;urance of Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that the fir&s;t Fruits of our Lives will be a Sacrifice plea&s;ing and acceptable in the Sight of God our Saviour.</P>

<PB N="10" REF="004911_0012_100E1907194B72D8">from God and Religion; and the Difficulties and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of humane life frequently confound and di&s;|pirit many others, and entangle them in fatal Temp|tations.</P>
<P>Moreover <HI>the Mind in Youth is more &s;u&s;ceptible of good In&s;truction, and more apt to fear the Wrath of God</HI> and the Dangers of eternal Mi&s;ery, which is the mo&s;t powerful, and u&s;ually the mo&s;t effectual Motive to Repentance and amendment of Life, than when we are habituated to the Danger, and grown ob&s;tinate and hardned to the Terrors of the Lord. For tho' nothing is more plain than that Sinners go continually in Jeopardy of their Lives; and in the dreadful Danger of falling into the Hands of the living God; and that every Moment brings them nearer to the eternal Judg|ment, and their Pre&s;ervation out of eternal Burnings grows more precarious; yet their Fears decrea&s;e. And having e&s;caped long, they pre&s;ume on the Mercy and Patience of God. And being familiari&s;ed to Danger, the Impre&s;&s;ions wear off, and grow fainter by Degrees, At lea&s;t till the evil Days draw near and they find them|&s;elves on the very Borders of the Grave, ju&s;t ready to &s;ink into Death with all their Guilt about them.</P>
<P><HI>Con&s;cience likewi&s;e is more tender and more faithful</HI> to reprove and warn Sinners in the begining of life, than when by a long Cu&s;tom of re&s;i&s;ting neglecting and oppo&s;ing its Dictates, it becomes hardned, and as it were &s;eared with an hot Iron. Moreover in Youth we experience the Strivings of Gods Spirit with us; and have more Rea&s;on to expect and depend upon his gra|cious and powerful A&s;&s;i&s;tance, than after we have long quenched his Operations and grieved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im, and provok|ed him to depart from us and leave us to our &s;elves, and the Power of our Spiritual Enemies. But this brings me to mention,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The peculiar Encouragement and A&s;&s;i&s;tance which God has given and offers to Youth.</HI></P>
<P>It is be rea&s;onable to hope our compa&s;&s;ionate Redeem|er, will never ca&s;t out any that come to him tho' at the eleventh Hour, yet we mu&s;t needs think it more plea&s;|ing to God, for us to devote our &s;elves early to his
<PB N="11" REF="004911_0013_100E18DB9AEBBD28">Service, and to go on to live all the re&s;t of our Time in the Fle&s;h to the Will and Prai&s;e of God, than to offer our fir&s;t Fruits to the God of this World, and con&s;ume the be&s;t of our Time in the Service of Sir, and offer God only the Dregs of Life; &amp; in the la&s;t Agony call upon him for that Mercy, and Grace, which we have &s;lighted and abu&s;ed all our Days.</P>
<P>Accordingly God has <HI>expre&s;ly promi&s;ed,</HI> that <HI>they who &s;eek him early &s;hall find him,</HI> and has given the plaine&s;t A&s;&s;urance of their Succe&s;s and Acceptance. Now this naturally tends to animate and invigorate. the Mind, and rai&s;e it above Fear and De&s;pondency. There is not &s;uch Room for a melancholy Di&s;courage|ment, nor &s;uch Danger of &s;inful Di&s;pair as if we had long refu&s;ed the Offers of Mercy.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance</HI> which is promi&s;ed to &s;uch as &s;eek God early is the <HI>mo&s;t &s;olid and effectual Ad|vantage</HI> towards the taking Chri&s;t's Yoke upon us, his Grace is &s;ufficient for us, and with his Help we may ea&s;ily overcome the greate&s;t Difficulties. The Weapons of our Warfare will be mighty through God to the pulling down of &s;trong Holds, ca&s;ting down Imagina|tions, and every Thing that exalteth it &s;elf again&s;t the Knowledge of God, and bringing into Captivity every Thought to the Obedience of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>In fine <HI>Youth is the important Sea&s;on</HI> in which we generally <HI>Form our Character both for Time and Eternity;</HI> It is a State of Di&s;cipline for mature Age, and eter|nal Ages, and if unhappily we let &s;lip this fir&s;t, this be&s;t, this the proper Oportunity of aplying our Hearts to Wi&s;dom, we do unavoidably render the Work in it &s;elf more difficult, and weaken, di&s;incline and incapa|citate our &s;elves, and drive away the Influences of the Divine Grace that are nece&s;&s;ary to the Renova|tion of our Nature, and the Salvation of our Souls. And we can never again expect &s;uch another conveni|ent Sea&s;on, but have Rea&s;on to fear, God will ca&s;t us off for ever, and at la&s;t laugh at our Calamity, and mock when our Fear comes, when Fear cometh as De&s;olation and De&s;truction as a Whirlwind, becau&s;e we would none of his Councels and de&s;pi&s;ed all his Reproof.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="004911_0014_100E1909A7540DE0">
At lea&s;t we &s;hall run our &s;elves into unavoidable Dan|gers, and Di&s;&s;iculties, and mi&s;s of tho&s;e Bene&s;its which in <HI>the Cour&s;e of Things, and by the Will of God, are the ble&s;&s;ed Effects of early Religion.</HI> The&s;e we are to con|&s;ider under the next Head. Which is,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That there are peculiar Advantages that follow on the bearing the Yoke of Religion in Youth.</HI></P>
<P>The Profit and Benefit of Religion <HI>in general</HI> I have already &s;hewn, is much every Way, infinitly great and endle&s;s. And <HI>the happy Influence early Religion will have on our future Exi&s;tence in this World and that which is to come,</HI> Is &s;o great as to comprehend all the Things we can de&s;ire; the good Effects are &s;o many I know not how to range them in their proper Order: However we may form &s;ome Idea of them in this Manner.</P>
<P N="1">1. By hearing the Yoke in our Youth, <HI>we prevent a great deal of Sin and Sorrow: For Lu&s;t when it has conceived, bringeth forth Sin, and Sin when it is fini&s;hed bringeth forth Death.</HI> If we conld be &s;ure to &s;ecure <HI>the Salvation of our Souls</HI> by a <HI>late Repentence,</HI> yet both <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Ingenuity</HI> would encline and determine us to bear the <HI>Yoke in Youth,</HI> to prevent tho&s;e <HI>innumerable Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions</HI> wherewith God mu&s;t b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d &s;honoured and of|fended, Mankind injured perhapsin their eternal Intere&s;t, &amp; our own Souls wronged and pollured, in a long Series of Rebellion and Di&s;obedience. Be&s;ides we &s;hall thereby prevent all the <HI>Woldly Sorrow</HI> which may be the natural or judicial Effect of making Provi&s;ion to gratify corrupt Nature, and wilfully flinging off the Re&s;traints of Religion; And <HI>that Godly Sorrow</HI> we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily feel for our Folly, and Wickedne&s;s, if ever God give us Repentance unto Life.</P>
<P>We can never ca&s;t off the Fear of God and &s;in again&s;t him, without wounding our own Sould; &s;o that Reli|gion pre&s;erves us from tho&s;e Evils that would be the Con&s;equences of our Sins; and what an <HI>Advantage</HI> there is in early Religion on this Account appears from con&s;idering the <HI>Violence of Youthful Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> the dangerous <HI>Temptations we are then expo&s;ed to,</HI> the <HI>Nature and nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences</HI> of tho&s;e Sins to
<PB N="13" REF="004911_0015_100E18DE0E456970">which we are tempted; and that Errors and fal&s;e Conduct in Youth, nece&s;&s;arily reach to, and greatly affect the Comfort and Happine&s;s of our whole Lives. The Con&s;equences of unbridled Pa&s;&s;ions and Appetites in Youth are fatal. We cannot afterwards avoid, or remedy the ill Effects of indulging corrupt Nature, in many In&s;tances. <HI>Even tho' we &s;hould come to &s;incere Repentance,</HI> and find Forgivene&s;s with God, and obtain everla&s;ting Life; <HI>yet we mu&s;t in this World groan un|der &s;ome of the mi&s;erable Effects of our Folly.</HI> So that there is a great Benefit in bearing the Yoke of Religion in Youth, in that <HI>it happily prevents tho&s;e many Evils,</HI> that would naturally follow, from &s;pending our Youth in Sin, and Wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>To bear the Yoke of Religion in Youth, is the Way to arrive at the greate&s;t Degrees of Holine&s;s,</HI> and <HI>to excel in the Knowledge, and Practice of true Religion.</HI></P>
<P>It is the Way to become more perfect in Holine&s;s, to become more like God, to become more expert in the Practice of all the Duti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of Religion, and to practice them with more Plea&s;ure and Delight. Tho' it be the Grace of God alone that can renew and &s;anctify a Sinner, and tho' God is able to do abundant|ly above what we are able to think; yet we find by Experience, that <HI>Sanctification</HI> is <HI>u&s;ually a Work of Time and Labour.</HI> The &s;ooner therefore we begin, and the longer Time we have to exerci&s;e our &s;elves to Godline&s;s, the greater Progre&s;s may we expect to make, with the divine Ble&s;&s;ing. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> may expect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> grow in Grace, to be continually p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ng forwards to ward the Perfection of the Chri&s;tian Life; and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> we &s;hall be <HI>more perfectly transformed into the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Image,</HI> by <HI>the Renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> The wi&s;e-Man tells us, <HI>The Path of the Ju&s;t, is as the &s;hining Light, which &s;hineth more and more, to the perfect Day</HI></P>
<P>It is certain, <HI>U&s;e makes perfect,</HI> and <HI>Cu&s;tom renders Things delightful;</HI> and what we are accu&s;tomed to, <HI>in Youth,</HI> we grow mo&s;t of all expert in. And on the other Hand, it requires Time and Labour, to conquer our unnatural Propen&s;ities to Evil, and to acquire &s;ettled Habits of Vertue and Goodne&s;s. So that it is
<PB N="14" REF="004911_0016_100E190D15554DC0">an Advantage to begin betimes, not only as it is then ea&s;ier to overcome corrupt Nature, before it is &s;trength|ened by Cu&s;tom and Habit, but becau&s;e an Habit of true Religion formed and &s;etled in Youth, promi&s;es a gradual Approach to the highe&s;t Degrees of Perfection we are capable of in this World. &mdash; And this is no mean Encouragement to &s;uch as perceive and own the Excellency of true Religion, and the real Happine&s;s of recovering the Image of God; which is our Glory and Safety.</P>
<P N="3">3. Again, <HI>It is the Way to inward Peace, Comfort, and Tranquility of Mind all our Days.</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Guilt of Sin is removed,</HI> by the pardoning Mercy of God, through the Blood of Chri&s;t. And the <HI>Power of it,</HI> broken by the &s;anctifying Influences of the Holy Sphit; then the <HI>Work of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, is Peace,</HI> and <HI>the Effect of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, is Quietne&s;s, and A&s;&s;urance for ever.</HI> The <HI>Ways of Wi&s;dom are Plea&s;antne&s;s and all her Paths are Peace.</HI> While on the other Hand, <HI>there is no Peace to the Wicked.</HI> He <HI>is like the troubled Sea when is cannot re&s;t, who&s;e Waters caft up Mire and Dirt.</HI> Or if Con&s;cience &s;hould be in a dead Calm, and he &s;hould flatter him&s;elf in his own Eyes that all is well and &s;afe, or if he &s;hould amu&s;e him&s;elf with the vain Hopes of a timely Re|pentance, and &s;o encourage him&s;elf in an Evil Way; yet the Tyrany of unruly Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions is pain|ful and unea&s;ie. Whence come Warrs and Confu&s;ions in our Brea&s;ts, but from the Rage and Tumult of un|hallewed Pa&s;&s;ions. No Man can be happy while the&s;e are un&s;ubdued, and riot in his Bo&s;om.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t mortify our Members, deny our &s;elves, and take up the Cro&s;s, the Yoke of Chri&s;t, if we would find Re&s;t and Ea&s;e to our Souls. There is no other way to obtain it. And the due Subordination and Government of our Affections, the Right Exerci&s;e of our Faculties, the Te&s;timony of a good Con&s;cience, a Sen&s;e of the divine Favour and the joyful Hope of Eter|nal Glory, will afford a <HI>continual Fea&s;t</HI> of fat Things, full of Marrow, of Wines on the Lees, well refined. So that there is this farther Benefit of bearing the Yoke of Religion in Youth, that it lays a good Foun|dation
<PB N="15" REF="004911_0017_100E18E087081838">for, and has a happy Tendency to the <HI>con|&s;tant Peace and Serenity of our Mind,</HI> which is &s;o e&s;&s;en|tially nece&s;&s;ary, that all the World without it, cannot make us happy; and no outward Circum&s;tances, can &s;ender us mi&s;erable, while we have <HI>Peace within,</HI> and <HI>Confidence toward God;</HI> of &s;o great Advantage is it to be <HI>reconciled to God through Je&s;us Christ,</HI> and <HI>renewed in the Spirit of our Mind.</HI> And this brings me to ob&s;erve in the next Place.</P>
<P N="4">4. That it is worthy to be con&s;idered, <HI>what Comfort and Con&s;olation we mu&s;t needs find</HI> under <HI>all the Trials and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of humane Life, from having born the Yoke in our Youth.</HI></P>
<P>However fair and promi&s;ing the Morning of Life may be, and however apt we are to promi&s;e our &s;elves continual Ea&s;e and Pro&s;perity; yet Man is born to Trouble as the Sparks fly upwards. Of Nece&s;&s;ity we mu&s;t pa&s;s through many Sorrows, before we come to the Hou&s;e appointed for all Living; and under all the Mi&s;eries the Fre&s;h is Heir to, we need &s;uch Comfort and Con&s;olation as this vain World cannot give us. There is none, at lea&s;t none comparable to <HI>Peace with God through our Lord Je&s;us Christ.</HI></P>
<P>How mi&s;erable is their Condition, who when oppre&s;&s;|ed with outward Troubles, have at be&s;t, only unca&s;ie Fears with; and perhaps the Reproaches of a guilty Con&s;cience. Apprehen&s;ions of the Wrath God, and the Ferrors of the World to come mu&s;t &s;ink the Spirit, already depre&s;&s;ed with the Weight of its Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a|mities. Or it Afflictions are &s;anctified and produce the peaceable Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s in the End; yet there can be no &s;olid Comfort, 'till they experience the Love of God &s;hed abroad in their Hearts. But they who have born the Yoke from their Youth, can much bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter bear the Troubles of Life, than if the Pride of their Hearts, and Impatience of their Spirits had never been &s;ubdued and mortified. They can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rfully &s;ubmit to the Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tions of their <HI>Heavenly Father;</HI> knowing that He afflicts them in very Faithfulne&s;s and Kindne&s;s, and that his infinite Wi&s;dom, Power, and Goodne&s;s are employed to conduct all Things for their be&s;t, their eternal Intere&s;t. They know <HI>the&s;e l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ght Af|flictions
<PB N="16" REF="004911_0018_100E190E9930F598">will work out for them a far more exceeding,</HI> and an <HI>eternal Weight of Glory;</HI> and therefore they can endure as &s;eing him that is invi&s;ible. They count it all Joy when they fall into divers Temptations, know|ing that the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ial of their Faith worketh Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ience, and and when Patience hath her p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fect Work, they &s;hall be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</P>
<P>Thus, by <HI>Early Religion</HI> we make <HI>Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ion to po&s;&s;e&s;s our Souls in Patience</HI> and <HI>Re&s;ignation to the Will of God,</HI> amid&s;t all the Calamities of Life, and under all the Cha&s;ti&s;ements he may fee fit to exerci&s;e us with, for our Profit, and in order to make us Partakers of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ioline&s;s. But to wa&s;te our Youth in &s;inful Plea&s;ures, Negligence and Di&s;obedience to God, is the Way to imbitter all, the Sorrows of this World; to draw down upon us the Anger and Judgments of a righte us and holy God; to enfeeble &amp; di&s;pirit our &s;elves; and provoke God to leave us without any Support. <HI>The Spirit of a Man may &s;u&s;tain his Infirmity,</HI> but <HI>a wounded Spirit who can bear. Gnilt</HI> and <HI>Fear</HI> increa&s;e and aggravate every Pre&s;&s;ure of Life, or rather, they are them&s;elves the heavie&s;t and mo&s;t in&s;upportable Burdens. So that &s;ince we mu&s;t needs be in Heavine&s;s through manifold Temptations, it is a great Benefit of Early Religion, that it enables us to pa&s;s through all the Trials and Afflictions of this Life, with more Comfort and Satisfaction.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Early Religion is the Way to lay up in &s;tore, a good Foundation again&s;t the Time of Old Age.</HI> God only knows whether we &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">each Old Age; by far<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the greate&s;t Part of Mankind are cut off in the Morning or the mid&s;t of their Days. But as we na|turally de&s;ire long Life land h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pe to be old, it is evidently our Wi&s;dom, and of great Importance, to make a timely, and &s;uitable Provi&s;ion, <HI>for our Com|fort and Happine&s;s, under the Decays of Nature,</HI> and the <HI>Infirmities of Age.</HI> We all are Witne&s;&s;es to <HI>the Complaints</HI> of tho&s;e, <HI>who&s;e Strength is Labour and Sorrow.</HI> We &s;ee they want &s;ome Cordial, to &s;upport them in their declining Days, and under the continual Expectations of aproaching Death, and Judgment. How deplorable is their Condition, who are then
<PB N="17" REF="004911_0019_100E18E2EC2383C8">a&s;hamed to look back, on a long Life of Folly, Vice, and Wickedne&s;s; and afraid to look forward, on the ju&s;t Judgments of a righteous God, and his fiery Indig|nation prepared to devour them.</P>
<P>But if we have early made our Peace with God, and have pa&s;&s;ed a Life of Obedience, and Communion wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h him, as the outward Man decays, the inward Man will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ewed; the la&s;t Days may prove the be&s;t. They will be pa&s;&s;ed in the divine Favour; in a com|fortable Reflection on the Goodne&s;s, and Faith|fulne&s;s of God to us all our Life long; and in the plea&s;ing Hope of a &s;peedy Deliverance from all Sin and Sorrow; and that we &s;hall &s;oon receive the End of all our Faith and Patience, in the Salvation of our Souls; and that we &s;hall have an abundant Entrance, admini&s;tred to us into everla&s;ting Glory.</P>
<P>They, who have by God's Grace early for&s;aken the Paths of Sin, and have patiently continued in Well-doing, and have held the Begining of their Confidence &s;tedfa&s;t to the End, mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t needs find un&s;peakable Satisfaction herein, at the Conclu&s;ion of Life. They have by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, e&s;caped the Pollutions of the World, they have &s;erved their Generation according to the Will of God, and tho' they are con&s;cious of many Infirmi|ties, and look on them&s;elves at the be&s;t, but as un|profitable Servants, yet having the Te&s;timony of a good Con&s;cience and, God's Spirit witne&s;&s;ing together with their Spirits, they can &s;ay with St. <HI>Paul, I have fought a good Fight, I have fini&s;hed my Cour&s;e, I have kept the Faith,</HI> and therefore they can triumph al&s;o with him, <HI>henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>How happy is it for old Age, to be found in the Way of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, to be able to look back on a Life &s;pent in the Service, and to the Prai&s;e of God. Such Per&s;ons are not made to po&s;&s;es the Iniquities of their Youth. But they derive a florid old Age from their Piety, Purity, and Temperance; at lea&s;t that flouri&s;hing Health and Vigour of Soul, which enables them to bring forth much of the Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, to the Prai&s;e and Glory of God. They enjoy that Spi|ritual Knowledge, and Experience, that quiet Hope, and humble A&s;&s;urance of the divine Favour, that is
<PB N="18" REF="004911_0020_100E19101A256BA0">worth the Labour of our whole Lives to attain. <HI>God is faithful,</HI> to <HI>&s;tabli&s;h them,</HI> and <HI>keep them from Evil,</HI> and <HI>to direct their Hearts into the Love of God,</HI> and <HI>the patient Waiting for Chri&s;t.</HI> But by neglecting Religi|on, and refu&s;ing the Yoke of Chri&s;t in Youth, we provoke God to our us off by Premature Death, and not &s;uffer us to live out half our Days; or if he &s;hould &s;pare us in the World, yet we do what in us lies to make Old Age mi&s;erable in every Re&s;pect; and if we continue to neglect the great Salvation, we trea&s;ure up to our &s;elves Wrath, again&s;t the Day of Wrath, and the Revelation of the righteous Judg|ments of God.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>To bear the Yoke in Youth is the Way to make a &s;ea&s;onable and effectual Provi&s;ion for an happy Death.</HI></P>
<P>Death unavoidably will overtake us &s;ooner or later. And whenever it comes, it is of infinit Importance to us to be ready. And as we know not the Day of of our Death, nor how &s;uddenly it may come upon us, it is our highe&s;t Duty and Intere&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in the fir&s;t Place, and above all Things to prepare to die. Le&s;t Death &s;eize us at unawares and we are &s;nared &s;udden|ly in an evil Time, for as <HI>Death leaves us, Judgment will find us,</HI> there being no Work Knowledge on Device in the Grave. Be&s;ides the Wi&s;dom and Nece&s;&s;ity of being prepared for the Judgment of the great Day, every Man would have Peace in his later End, and <HI>De&s;ires to die with Compo&s;ure</HI> and <HI>Satisfaction of Mind;</HI> but this can hardly be expected, if we have de&s;er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed. Religion, till <HI>our Feet &s;tumble on the dark Mountains.</HI></P>
<P>If we would die the Death of the Righteous, we mu&s;t live their Life. <HI>Mark the perfect Man,</HI> and <HI>behold the Upright, for the End of that Man is Peace.</HI> But there can be no real Ground of true Peace, and Com|fort at Death, but the Evidences that we are reconciled to God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and are Heirs with him, to the Inheritance of eternal Life. An Intere&s;t in the Redemption purcha&s;ed by Chri&s;t, affords infinite Com|fort at the Approach of Death; it di&s;arms the King of Terrors, and enables us on the Borders of the Grave, to look into Eternity, with Joy un&s;peakable and full
<PB N="19" REF="004911_0021_100E18E4DD78D878">of Glory. And in the mean Time, it delivers us, from being all our Life-Time, &s;ubject to Bondage through the Fear of Death.</P>
<P>They who are early prepared for Death, have this great Advantage, to wait all the Days of their ap|pointed Time, in Patience and Security. And at la&s;t to quit the World in Faith, and Hope, knowing him in whom they have believed, and to whom they have committed the Keeping of their Souls in Well-doing. If their Days are lengthned out on the Earth, they are <HI>looking for the ble&s;&s;ed Hope, and the glorious appear|ance of the great God and our Saviour Je&s;us Christ.</HI> Or if God is plea&s;ed, early to take them away from the Evil to come, <HI>the Day of their Death is better than the Day of their Birth.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, by Early Religion we are made &s;oon ready for the awful and important Hour of Dying. And this Readine&s;s, makes a dying Bed ea&s;y, which no|thing el&s;e can do. Yea an early Preparation, gives a <HI>better Hope</HI> and <HI>more Comfort,</HI> than if we had neglect|ed Religion i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> our Youth, and had only begun to fear God in the Evil Days, or had turned to him only on our Death-Bed. Who would not be willing to prevent, that <HI>dreadful Angui&s;h</HI> and <HI>Di&s;tre&s;s of Soul,</HI> which we &s;ee Per&s;ons under, who have lived as without God in the World, 'till Death &s;tars them in the Face, and their Feet take bold on Hell?

And how do they warn, and be&s;eech all around them, to mind Religion in Sea&s;on, and not to depend on Sickne&s;s, and Age to prepare for the eternal Judgment?</P>
<P>Let this then be con&s;idered as a great Recommenda|tion of Early Religion, that it reconciles us to the Thoughts of Death, by preparing us for it; and makes our Departure out of the World, when ever it comes, &s;afe and joyful. The <HI>Sting of Death is Sin, and the Strength of Sin is the Law,</HI> but <HI>Thanks be to God, who giveth us the Victory through our Lord Je&s;us Christ.</HI></P>

Now our own Rea&s;on, the Experience of all Ages, and the Wi&s;dom of God, teach us, <HI>to &s;eek fir&s;t the Kingdom of God, and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> As we are Members of Society, as well as we are accountable Creatures, the Principles of true Religion, are the be&s;t and only right Principles of humane Conduct. We cannot indeed certainly pro|mi&s;e our &s;elves, Pro&s;perity in this World, but we can promi&s;e our &s;elves, what is a great deal better; even that <HI>all Things &s;hall work together for our gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">est Good,</HI> our &s;piritual and eternal Welfare; for &s;o they u&s;e to do, to them that love God, who are the Call|ed according to his Purpo&s;e.

<P>Tho', the Reward of the Righteous, is not Riches, or Honour, or any earthly Good; yet Godline&s;s is pro|fitable unto all Things, and has the Promi&s;e of all Things pertaining to Life, as well as to Godline&s;s, that, our heavenly Father &s;ees we have Need of; and can u&s;e and employ for his Glory, and our own eter|nal Happine&s;s.

And there is al&s;o a real and natural Con|nection between Obedience to the Laws of God, and humane Happine&s;s; for as Sin originally brought in Death and Sorrow, &s;o great Part of our Mi&s;eries on Earth, are the proper Effects of our own Folly and Wickedne&s;s.

<PB N="21" REF="004911_0023_100E18E6A6AE8AC8">and the Fear of the Lord, <HI>are Riches and Honour &amp; Life.</HI> And hence the Holy Spirit has repeated it: <HI>What Man is He that de&s;ireth Life and loveth Days,</HI> that <HI>he may &s;ee Good,</HI> let <HI>him refrain his Tongue from Evil, his Lips from &s;peaking Guile,</HI> let <HI>him depart from Evil, and do good,</HI> let <HI>him &s;eek Peace and pur&s;ue it.

<P N="8">8. <HI>Early Religion naturally tends to gladden the Hearts of our Friends and Relatives.</HI></P>
<P>It is the Duty and u&s;ually the Ambition of Youth to gain the E&s;teem of their Parents and Benefactors, and recommend them&s;elves to the Good-Will of all Men. Now this is done in the be&s;t Manner, and mo&s;t effectually, by a &s;incere Obedience to the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. For Religion really approves it &s;elf to every Man's Con&s;cience, to be true Wi&s;dom and Excellence. And genuine Religion in Youth, is &s;o beautiful and amiable a Character, that all Men admire it. The greate&s;t natural Abilities and the mo&s;t promi&s;ing Genius, cannot give &s;o much Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction to our Friends, as a true Sence of Religion. Appli|cation to, and Succe&s;s in Bu&s;ine&s;s, tho' highly plea&s;|ing to our Friends, can by no Means give them &s;o great Joy, as to &s;ee our Souls in Health, and Pro&s;per|ing in the Grace of God. And why &s;hould it, &s;ince Religion is really the <HI>One Thing needful?</HI> What &s;hall it profit a Man to gain the whole World, and lo&s;e his own Soul? There is no Proportion between Time and Eternity. Indu&s;try and Diligence about Temporal Concerns, makes Spiritual Slothfulne&s;s, and Negligence about our eternal Intere&s;t, to appear the more dangerous and inexcu&s;able. The greate&s;t Talents, mi&s;aply'd, only enable us to di&s;honour God the more; and expo&s;e the Sinner, to an heavier Con|demnation. For <HI>to whom&s;oever much is given,</HI> of him <HI>&s;hall be much required;</HI> and to <HI>whom Men have com|mitted much, of him they will ask the more. To Man he &s;aith, The Fear of the Lord,</HI> that <HI>is Wi&s;dom,</HI> and <HI>to depart from Evil, is Under&s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="004911_0024_100E191577218A68">
If Parents are them&s;elves irreligious, yet they can &s;carce help being plea&s;ed to &s;ee their Children walk|ing in the Paths of Truth, and Life. Such Children are a Credit to them, and more u&s;eful than other|wi&s;e. But if Parents are them&s;elves the Children of God, then it is a double Joy, to &s;ee Chri&s;t formed in their Ofspring. This is what they have above all Things de&s;ired for them, and even travailed again for them, that they might be born from above, and of the Spirit of God. It is an un&s;peakable Angui&s;h to a religious Parent, to &s;ee one of his Children become a Child of the Devil, and an Enemy to God, and go|ing down to the Chambers of Death. And it is equal Plea&s;ure to &s;ee their Children adopted into the the Number of God's Children, regenerated and creat|ed anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and become Heirs of eter|nal Glory.</P>
<P>And as this is the mo&s;t moving Argument, to per|&s;wade Parents, to bring up their Children, in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord, that they may at la&s;t be able to &s;ay, <HI>Here are we and the Children whom thou haft given us.</HI> So it is no &s;mall Motive to Children that have any Gratitude, and Ingenuity in them, to remember their Creator in their Youth, that they may plea&s;e, and gladden the Hearts of their Parents, to whom they are &s;o much indebted, and on whom they have &s;uch a Dependance. <HI>Hear then ye Children, the In&s;truction of your Father, and for&s;ake not the Law of your Mother.</HI> For the Law is Light, and the Reproofs of In&s;truction are the Way of Life. <HI>A wi&s;e Son maketh a glad Father,</HI> but <HI>a fooli&s;h Son is the Heavine&s;s of his Mother.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>It is the Way to glorify God, and to &s;erve our Genera|tion, to the greate&s;t Advantage.</HI></P>
<P>By a religious Life we <HI>do good</HI> and render our &s;elves u&s;eful to Mankind in the highe&s;t Degree. A <HI>good Example</HI> of every Thing that is vertuous and prai&s;e|worthy, is of great Influence, to oppo&s;e the Evil-Doers, and to per&s;wade Men to glorify God by a profe&s;&s;ed Subjection to the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. The fervent <HI>Prayers</HI> of the Righteous avail much to turn away Wrath, and &s;u&s;pend the Judgments of God and draw down
<PB N="23" REF="004911_0025_100E18EA02DFA438">his Ble&s;&s;ing on all around us. So that by working out our own Salvation, we make our &s;elves <HI>Publick Ble&s;&s;ings.</HI></P>
<P>And hereby we glorify God, as we an&s;wer the End of our Creation, and the De&s;igns of Providence and Grace, and give Occa&s;ion of many Thanksgivings to God.</P>
<P>But few comparatively are called to publick Offices, but all Men may be truly Benefactors to Society, in a private Station. By leading quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty, we may effectually &s;erve our Generation, according to the Will of God. And particularly by <HI>Early Religion,</HI> we are likely to awaken, in&s;truct and encourage the <HI>Ri&s;ing Generation,</HI> to know and to &s;erve the God of their Fathers, with a perfect Heart and a willing Mind. And if we are in&s;trumental to prevent the Corruption of Youth, and promote a Reformation of Manners, we do in the be&s;t Manner contribute to the Pro&s;perity of the People among whom we live; for <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a Nation,</HI> but <HI>Sin is the Reproach and Ruin of every People.</HI> And be&s;ides this, we &s;hall prevent a Multi|tude of Sins, and &s;ave many Souls from Death eter|nal, and they who turn many to Righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall &s;hine as the Brightne&s;s of the Firmament, and as the Stars for ever and ever. Which brings me to add,</P>
<P N="10">10. In the la&s;t Place, <HI>That bearing the Yoke in Youth is the Way to arrive at greater Degrees of Glory in the World to come.</HI></P>
<P>For tho' there be no Deficience of Happine&s;s among the Spirits of ju&s;t Men made perfect, nor any Envy in the Pre&s;ence of God, yet <HI>one Star differeth from another Star in Glory.</HI> We may ju&s;tly expect that &s;uch as have been here di&s;tingui&s;hed with the Graces of the Divine Spirit, and have excell'd in the Vertues of the Chri&s;tian Life, in U&s;efulne&s;s to Mankind, and in their Serviceablene&s;s to the Church of God, will here|after &s;hine with a di&s;tingui&s;hed Splendour in the King|dom of their Father. So that from an early devoting our &s;elves to the Service of God and a patient Con|tinuance in Well-doing, we may rea&s;onably expect from the good Plea&s;ure of God to be more highly exealted
<PB N="24" REF="004911_0026_100E1917E36DCB30">in the Day of Chri&s;t's Appearing, and when God &s;hall be All in all.</P>
<P>Thus there are the greate&s;t Benefits relating both to Time and to Eternity, following on an early Sub|mi&s;&s;ion to the Yoke of Chri&s;t. It has a happy Influence on us during the whole Extent of our Duration: He that &s;ows to the Spirit in his Youth, &s;hall of the Spirit reap Life everla&s;ting.</P>
<P N="3">3. I proceed to &s;hew, That all the&s;e Advantages of bearing the Yoke in Youth, will be very greatly heightned, from the Con&s;ideration of <HI>the Dangers and the Di&s;advantages of wilfully</HI> or <HI>carele&s;ly neglecting Religion in Youth.</HI></P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. If we refu&s;e, or neglect Religion in our Youth, <HI>we run &s;uch dreadful and amazing Dangers, and Haz|ards,</HI> as &s;hew the Benefit of Early Religion, in a mo&s;t affecting Light.</P>
<P>Let us but only ob&s;erve what <HI>Infinite Hazard there is,</HI> that if we don't bear the Yoke in Youth, <HI>we never &s;hall at all.</HI> But either we &s;hall die in Youth and peri&s;h in our Sins; or if our Days are lengthened out, yet his own Iniquities &s;hall take the Wicked, and he &s;hall be holden in the Cords of his Sins, in the Greatne&s;s of his Folly he &s;hall go a&s;tray, and die without In&s;truction, and have this of God's Hand at la&s;t, to lie down in everla&s;ting Sorrow.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the fir&s;t Place, <HI>There is nothing &s;o uncertain as Humane Life.</HI></P>
<P>We know not what a Day will bring forth; much le&s;s can we promi&s;e our &s;elves many Years, and &s;afely depend on long Life. It is the Portion but of a very few of Mankind. And very many are taken away without any particular Warning, at every Age. It is therefore extravagant Folly to neglect Religion on the vain Pre&s;umption of a long Life, which we can have no good Rea&s;ons to expect and depend upon: But a great many Rea&s;ons to think we &s;hall never attain. <HI>For what is our Life? It is even as a Vapour that appeareth for a little Time, and then vani&s;heth away.</HI> If it be then ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for us to
<PB N="25" REF="004911_0027_100E18EB8989A298">bear the Yoke of Religion, <HI>before we go hence,</HI> and are here no more for ever, it is evidently our highe&s;t Pru|dence, to improve with the utmo&s;t Care, the fir&s;t Oportunity we have, le&s;t Death prevent us of any Oportunity hereafter.</P>
<P>But if we con&s;ider that we are <HI>by Nature Children of Wrath,</HI> that <HI>they who believe not</HI> are <HI>condemned already.</HI> That until we are ju&s;tified by Faith, and have Peace with God, we are in a State of Enmity and Rebellion, and under a Sentence of Condemna|tion&mdash; What Folly, and Madne&s;s mu&s;t it appear, to continue willingly in &s;uch a Condition one Moment? To delay in a Matter of &s;uch Nece&s;&s;ity and Import|ance? To run &s;uch a dreadful Hazard, as to venture Eternity, on the &s;lender Thread of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">umane Life? And continually expo&s;e our &s;elves to the amazing Danger of the eternal Judgment, and of eternal Vengeance? But to do all this <HI>purpo&s;ely and on De&s;ign,</HI> and all <HI>for the Sake of Things that profit not,</HI> but <HI>peri&s;h in the U&s;ing,</HI> which <HI>we &s;hall &s;con be a&s;hamed of,</HI> and <HI>who&s;e End is Death;</HI> is Folly beyond Expre&s;&s;ion. And yet this Folly is aggravated by its very Excu&s;e. For, to run &s;uch Hazards, on the <HI>vain Dependance on long Life,</HI> and <HI>a future convenient Sea&s;on for Religion,</HI> not only without any A&s;&s;urance of our Life; but again&s;t &s;o many Probabilities from the con&s;tant Cour&s;e of the World, and the Danger that God will judicially out &s;hort our Time; this is altogether beneath that Prudence and Under&s;tanding with which God has en|dowed rational Creatu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s.</P>
<P>So that the Uncertainty of Life, puts our eternal Sal|vation to infinite Hazard; and it mu&s;t be egregious Folly to depend on many Years in the World, when we know not, but that God may this Night, require our Souls of us; and then what will our Condition be, if we have refu&s;ed to bear the Yoke, but remedi|le&s;s De&s;truction.</P>
<P N="2">2. But there is <HI>another dreadful Hazard,</HI> that, <HI>if Life be indeed prolonged,</HI> yet, <HI>the Sinner will never come to Repentance; but be hardened through the Deceitfulne&s;s of Sin, and given up of God,</HI> to <HI>Hard|ne&s;s of Heart, and a Reprobate Mind.</HI></P>

<P>One Sin makes way for another, and they who wilfully refu&s;e the Yoke of Religion, and ca&s;t God's Law behind them, are in great Danger to be holden in the Cords of their Sins, and to be in&s;en&s;ibly lead on to other Sins, that they may at fir&s;t think of with Horror and Aver&s;ion. <HI>There is a Way that &s;eem|eth right to a Man,</HI> in <HI>his own Eyes, but the End thereof are the Ways of Death.</HI></P>
<P>If <HI>Youth &s;et out on the Principles of Good Hu&s;bandry,</HI> and Worldly Prudence, without Regard to the Fear of God and the Salvation of their Souls, there is great Danger, they will peri&s;h by &s;ome of their Spiritual Enemies.

<P>If Per&s;ons put off Religion in Youth (whatever are their Motives) there is the greate&s;t Danger. <HI>They will grow &s;ecure and pre&s;umptuous.</HI> And &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e hardened

<P>In fine there is great Danger that if they ever &s;eri|ou&s;ly reflect on their Conduct and Circum&s;tances, they will be di&s;couraged from any Endeavours to break off from their Sins, and turn unto the Lord; and &s;ink into a Di&s;pair of Mercy, and pine away in their Sins.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole.

<P>To all which we may add, <HI>the Hopes and Evidences of Salvation can hardly be &s;o &s;atisfactory, and comfort|able</HI> to a late Penitent, as if he had been converted in Youth, and was able to appeal to God, <HI>That he had walked before him in truth,</HI> and <HI>with a perfect Heart.</HI> At lea&s;t it mu&s;t be owned, that a Death Bed Repentance can never be &s;o comfortable, or we &s;o &s;ure of its Sincerity, if it were only for this Rea&s;on, That <HI>&s;uch Appearances have &s;o often proved vain and delu|&s;ive.</HI> And this is undeni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble, that tho' a late Con|vert will for ever adore the di&s;tingui&s;hing Goodne&s;s of God, the Patience which bore with him &s;o long, and the Mercy that call'd, and received him at the eleventh Hour, and &s;natcht him as a Brand our of the Burning; yet, <HI>it will be a perpetual Grief</HI> and <HI>Humiliation to him,</HI> that he was &s;o evil, and unthankful, and to every good Work reprobate. And that he &s;o long abu&s;ed the Patience and Mercy of God. And was guilty of &s;o great Wickedne&s;s, Folly and Ingratitude. The Sins of his Youth, and the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of his riper Age nece&s;&s;arily fill him with Grief, and Shame. And tho' God has &s;ealed his Pardon, yet he can't help lament|ing the Di&s;honour he has done to God, and the Injury to Men, and to him&s;elf, by his Sins. He is now con|vinced of the Folly, and Danger of an Irreligious Youth, he is a&s;hamed of his Pa&s;t Life, wi&s;hes he could recall Time, and earne&s;tly advi&s;es, warns, and be&s;eeches all that are in Youth, to take the Yoke on them immedi|ately without any Delay.</P>
<P>Should not then, &s;uch as are young, <HI>beleive and hearken to the Advice</HI> which old Age continually gives. Should they not begin, to lead their Lives, as all that have gone before them, direct and exhort them. All Men that arrive at old Age, either wi&s;h they had &s;er|ved God in Youth, lament their Folly, and bewail the &s;ad Effects of it; or el&s;e rejoice in the divine Goodne&s;s, that di&s;po&s;ed and enabled them to bear the Yoke in their early Days. Who would purpo&s;ely lay up in &s;tore, a Foundation for Sorrow, Shame, and M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ery in old Age? And not rather endeavour to

<P>Thus I have endeavoured, as briefly as I could, to lay before you, a Summary of the principal Rea&s;ons, <HI>why it is good for a Man to bear the Yoke in his Youth.</HI> And now this brings me to the</P>
<P N="4">IV. Improvement.</P>
<P N="1">1. And the fir&s;t U&s;e I would make of the&s;e Things, is <HI>to awaken, convince and per&s;wade</HI> &s;uch (if any &s;uch there be here) <HI>who carele&s;sly. or wilfully neglect to take Christ's Yoke on them in their Youth.</HI></P>
<P>Ala&s;s! <HI>Why can you think it too &s;oon to be recon|ciled to God,</HI> and &s;ubmit your &s;elves to the Rules of Religion? How can you think it &s;oon enough to fly from the Wrath to come, and e&s;cape the Danger you are in of eternal Vengeance? What Comfort or Ad|vantage is there in remaining under the condemning Sentence of the law of GOD? Why will you not fly for Refuge, and lay hold on the Hope &s;et before you in the Go&s;pel?</P>
<P><HI>Are you &s;ure of a long Life on Earth?</HI> Or rather, Are you not convinced of the utter uncertainty of your Lives? And do you not know that if Death &s;eizes you, while in the Bonds of Iniquity, you are undone for ever? Are you &s;ure God will continue to afford you his Grace, or rather, Have you not the highe&s;t Rea&s;on to expect, that if you continue to abu&s;e his Goodne&s;s, <HI>He will utterly reject you,</HI> and <HI>ca&s;t you off for ever?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Con&s;ider the Iniquity,</HI> and <HI>the Ingratitude</HI> of Rebelli|on again&s;t the God of your Lives, and the Danger of provoking him, in whom you live, and move, and have your Being. Can you conceal your Sins from him? Can you impo&s;e upon, and deceive an all&s;eeing and a jealous God? Can you e&s;cape from his Pre&s;ence Can you re&s;i&s;t his Power? Are you &s;tronger than he?
<PB N="31" REF="004911_0033_100E18F2DFE87CD0">Will you contend with the Almighty, and ru&s;h on the thick Bo&s;&s;es of his Buckler? On be afraid of his righteous Judgments, and <HI>let the Fear of God be in you, the begining of true Wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You already experience the Nece&s;&s;ity of bridling your Pa&s;&s;ions, and curbing your Appetites,</HI> in order to your pre&s;ent Comfort, and all your Hopes of future Succe&s;s in the World. You feel the Nece&s;&s;ity of Di&s;cipline, and Re&s;traint, Why then will you nor lay on your Corruptions, <HI>that Yoke which God has provided,</HI> and obey tho&s;e Laws and Rules which He has given you? You are on Probation for temporal Happine&s;s, as well as eternal Glory; and generally &s;peaking, your Comfort in this World, depends upon, at lea&s;t is mo&s;t ef|fectually &s;ecured by the &s;ame Method, that is nece&s;&s;ary to obtain eternal Life. Why then will you gratify your corrupt Inclinations, at the Hazard both of your temporal and eternal Welfare? Or, if <HI>you deny your &s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es in any Re&s;pect for temporal Good,</HI> Why will you not deny <HI>all Ungodline&s;s and every Worldly Lu&s;t,</HI> in order to work out and <HI>&s;ecure the Salvation of your precious and immortal Souls?</HI></P>
<P>How can you think <HI>it is not good for a Man to bear the Yoke in his Youth?</HI> What 10th the Lord our God require of us, but to do ju&s;tly, to love Mercy, and walk humbly with him? To be holy in all manner of Conver&s;ation, as he that has called us is holy. And what can you lo&s;e, or hazard by Obedience to the Will of God, that is worthy to be compared with <HI>the Benefits of a religious Life, and the Glory that &s;hall be revealed?</HI></P>
<P>In fine, Do <HI>you &s;atisfy and encourage your &s;elves in Wickedne&s;s, with the De&s;ign to repent hereafter?</HI> And is there not the greate&s;t Ab&s;urdity and Folly in &s;uch a De&s;ign? Do you indeed Sin with a Re&s;olution to re|pent hereafter? Do you know or think what Repent|ance in Truth is? And, <HI>Can you po&s;&s;ibly Tran&s;gre&s;s, with a De&s;ign to be really &s;orry for it?</HI> Such Conduct di&s;covers gro&s;s Ignorance of the Nature of Repentance, or is a plain Self-Contradiction. <HI>It is only a mi&s;er|able Delu&s;ion of the Devil A fooli&s;h Expedient to quiet the Clamours of your Con&s;ciences,</HI> to enjoy the Plea&s;ures of Sin, without Di&s;turbance from the the Upbraidings,
<PB N="32" REF="004911_0034_100E1920DD4E1340">and Threatnings of Con&s;cience. If you are in any Mea&s;ure convinced of the Evil and Danger of Sin, be per&s;waded to mind the Things of your Peace, now in the Day of them, before they are hidden from your Eyes. If you have any De&s;ign to take Chri&s;t's Yoke on you at all, be per&s;waded to do it now, for <HI>behold, Now is an accepted Time,</HI> and <HI>Now is the Day of Salvation;</HI> and you know not how &s;oon, or how &s;uddenly it will come to an End.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the next Place, the&s;e Things &s;erve <HI>to confirm and encourage, you that have cho&s;en to bear the Yoke of Religion in Youth</HI></P>
<P>I pre&s;ume, &amp; I hope 'tis no vain Pre&s;umption, that you of <HI>this Society</HI> are &s;incere, and in earne&s;t; and really aim at the Glory of God, and the Salvation of your Souls. And that you mean not to make a fair Shew in the Fle&s;h, but <HI>to become the Di&s;ciples of Christ in Deed, and in Truth.</HI> I have endeavoured to &s;hew you, the <HI>Propriety,</HI> the <HI>Obligations,</HI> and the <HI>Advant|ages of remembering your Creator in the Days of your Youth.</HI> And I have done it, with a View to confirm, and e&s;tabli&s;h you in your happy Begining. If God in Mercy has awaken'd you to &s;ee the Wi&s;dom, and Nece&s;&s;ity of Religion, do not &s;uffer the good Impre&s;&s;ions to wear oft, but cultivate and improve them, 'till you are renewed in the Spirit of your Mind. Let <HI>not your Goodne&s;s be as the Morning Cloud, and as the early Dew,</HI> which &s;uddenly pa&s;s away. Be not like him in the Par|able that &s;aid, <HI>I go Sir,</HI> and <HI>went not.</HI> Be not laugh't out of the nece&s;&s;ary Care of your Souls. Be nor a&s;ham|ed of your Religion. Rather <HI>be a&s;hamed of the Folly, of li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing as without God in the World.</HI> Let no Temptation divert you from a &s;teddy Pur&s;uit of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Life. Set your Affection on Things which are above, where Chri&s;t is at God's right Hand in Glory. As you have begun well, let nothing hinder you. Be not weary of Well-doing, hold out to the End, and in due Sea&s;on you &s;hall reap, if you faint not.</P>
<P><HI>It is good for you to bear the Yoke in your Youth,</HI> it is good in all Re&s;pects, and in the highe&s;t Degree. It is the be&s;t Thing you can do, both in regard to the Life that now is, and that which is to come. Yea it
<PB N="33" REF="004911_0035_100E18F46205CB08">is the One Thing above all, and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. Religion is your Duty, your Wi&s;dom, and your Happy|ne&s;s, your Ornament and Glory.</P>
<P N="3">3.

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. In the fir&s;t Place, <HI>do not mi&s;take your own Aims, and Veiws in this Matter.</HI> But &s;ee that your Hearts be right with God; that you are &s;incere and upright before him&mdash;Remember God looketh at the Heart, That he &s;earches the Hearts, and the Reins of the Children of Men. That he is a Spirit, and &s;eeketh &s;uch to wor|&s;hip him as wor&s;hip him in Spirit and in Truth. Be &s;ure then that you truly de&s;ire and mean to &s;erve God, and &s;ave your Souls.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Do <HI>not mi&s;take the true Nature of Religion.</HI> Do not mi&s;take the Means, for the End, and &s;o re&s;t in what will finally deceive you. <HI>The End, of all the Means of Religion,</HI> is <HI>to make you partakers of a divine Nature or Temper,</HI> That after you have done the Will of God, you may inherit the Promi&s;es. Be therefore as much concerned to be delivered from the Power and Domi|nion of Sin, as from the Guilt and Puni&s;hment.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Be not contented with good De&s;ires and Re&s;olutions; nor mi&s;take them, for Regeneration.</HI> Who is there that has not &s;ome good De&s;ires in Youth? Who is there that is not &s;o far enlightened, and convinced, as <HI>to be almo&s;t per&s;waded to</HI> be a Chri&s;tian, <HI>and wi&s;h to die the Death of the Righteous?</HI> But an almo&s;t Chri&s;tian, will entirely come &s;hort of eternal Life.

4. Do <HI>not &s;ettle in the Preparatives to Conver&s;ion.</HI> Do not imagine, you are pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life, 'till you feel your &s;elves renewed in the Spirit of your Mind, after the Image of him that createth you anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good Works; And until you can prove the Truth of your Faith, by its genuine Fruits; until you are redeemed from a vain Conver&s;ation, <HI>'till old Things are pa&s;&s;ed away, and all Things become new; for if any Man be in Christ, he is a new Creature.</HI> And therefore you &s;hould give diligence to make your Call|ing and Election &s;ure; and with all Importunity, be|&s;eech him that <HI>has begun a good Work in you, to per|form it to the Day of Christ.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. <HI>Be deeply &s;en&s;ible, of your ab&s;olute Need of the Grace and Spirit of God, to renew and &s;anctify you.</HI> And there|fore above all Things ask of God, his holy Spirit, to work in you, the whole good Plea&s;ure of his Will, and the Work of Faith with Power.

He that tru&s;teth in him&s;elf is a Fool, but ble&s;&s;|ed are all they that tru&s;t in the Lord.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. <HI>Con&s;cientiou&s;ly attend all the Duties and Exerci&s;es of Religion.</HI> You mu&s;t not expect Grace but in the Way of Duty; and if you truly de&s;ire Grace, you will choo&s;e to be found in the Way of Duty; and will not ea&s;ily di&s;pence with the Neglect or Omi&s;&s;ion of any Thing which Chri&s;t has appointed as a Means of Grace. Be &s;ure therefore to maintain a con&s;tant Intercour&s;e with God, in the Exerci&s;es of Piety, and Devotion; in &s;tated, and faithful Self-Examination, in pious Medi|tation, and in the mo&s;t humble, and earne&s;t Prayer, and Supplication to the Throne of Grace.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. <HI>Watch, as well as pray always, that you enter not into Temptation.</HI> Keep your Hearts with all Diligence, for out of them are the I&s;&s;ues of Life.

It is impo&s;&s;ible to clean&s;e the Life from Sin, unle&s;s the Fountain of all our Actions be kept pure. The Government of the Thoughts, is a difficult and important Part of the Chri&s;tians Duty and Exerci&s;e. If your Hearts be purged from an evil Con|&s;cience, the &s;weet Fountain will ca&s;t forth pure Streams.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. <HI>Take heed and beware of the begining to grow &s;lack and negligent.</HI> Lo&s;e not your fir&s;t Love; but gird up the Loins of your Mind be &s;ober, and hope to the End. Suffer no Iniquicy to have Dominion over you; and ab&s;tain from every Occa&s;ion, and the very Appearance of Evil. Be afraid of turning back to Folly, and of lo&s;ing the Things which you have wrought, of di&s;hon|ouring God, and weakening your &s;elves by your Falls and Errors; and of the bitter Angui&s;h it mu&s;t co&s;t you to be renewed again by Repentance, and re&s;tored to Tranquility of Mind. And remember if any Man draws back, God's Soul will have no Plea&s;ure in him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. <HI>Keep your Con&s;ciences tender,</HI> be afraid of contract|ing any Guilt; and fear all Sin as Sin, however plea&s;ing, or profitable, however &s;ecret it may be, or compara|tively little; and for ever aim at Purity of Heart, and Con&s;cience, <HI>that Integrity and Uprightne&s;s of Heart</HI> may <HI>pre&s;erve you.</HI> Studiou&s;ly endeavour to keep always, a Con&s;cience void of Offence, both towards God, and towards Man.</ITEM>
