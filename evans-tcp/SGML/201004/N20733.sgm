<HEAD>PROPHECIES, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> OF Mr. <HI>Chri&s;topher Love.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A FEW Nights after he was &s;entenced to be beheaded on Tower-Hill, which was on the 22d day of Augu&s;t, 1651, ten days before his appointed time, by the &s;en|tence which he received at the bar; being one night vi&s;ited by two of his intimate acquaint|ances, or bo&s;om friends, as he him&s;elf call|ed them, they began to complain of the cru|elties of the times, and the ma&s;icious u&s;age of time-&s;erving brethren; to which Mr. Love an&s;wered,&mdash;"And think you this is an evil time? No, No; this is the very time, when grace and true godline&s;s can be di&s;tingui&s;hed from hypocri&s;y. Many have followed Chri&s;t, hitherto, for the loaves, and are now turned back for the roughne&s;s of the way, and the &s;ore trial and tribulation, which others met with, who are gone before them.</P>
<P>"There are many in London, at this very day, who think to go to Heaven in their gilded coaches, and who have denied Chri&s;t's
<PB N="3" REF="027229_0003_0FD3CC7291EBC4C0">cau&s;e before men (again&s;t whom I now wit|ne&s;s) and Chri&s;t, in his never failing word, has promi&s;ed to deny all &s;uch before his Father and the holy Angels. This is the time to di&s;cern between him that &s;erveth God, and him that &s;erveth him not. They formerly were my familiar acquaintances, in fellow&s;hip and in &s;weet conver&s;e. I &s;ent this day to have a few words with them, here in the pri&s;on, but they would not come; for their countenances are fallen, and their con&s;ciences wounded; they cannot look me in the face; becau&s;e I knew of their re&s;olu|tion, and was a witne&s;s of their perjuration. But, ah! how will they look the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS in the face, in the morning of the re|&s;urrection? What an&s;wer or excu&s;e will they have for what they have done? O fooli&s;h people! who think to e&s;cape the Cro&s;s, and come to the Crown! I tell you nay: you mu&s;t all &s;uffer per&s;ecution, who follow the Lamb. We mu&s;t be hated of all nations, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake. We mu&s;t go through great tribulation, and through the fiery furnace of affliction, before we can enter the land of joy and felicity. Know ye not, that the &s;ouls that were &s;lain for the te&s;timony of Je&s;us, are placed under the Altar. Happy, happy are tho&s;e men at this day, and ever &s;hall be hap|py, who &s;uffer for Chri&s;t's &s;ake in a right
<PB N="4" REF="027229_0004_0FD3E80B17854D20">way, i. e. through love to his cau&s;e, and an hone&s;ty of heart; and not through pride and hypocri&s;y, without the root of the matter, to have it &s;aid they died martyrs. The&s;e are they who will mi&s;s their mark. I am now pointed out by many to be in a de&s;titute and forlorn condition; but I would not ex|change my &s;tate, no, not for all the glory that is on earth. I find my Redeemer's love &s;tronger in my bonds, than ever I did in the days of my liberty: I am as full of love and joy in the Holy Spirit, as ever a bottle was filled with new wine. I am ready to cry out, the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me. I will not take upon me to prophe&s;y; neverthele&s;s, the Spirit of the Lord cau&s;eth me to utter.&mdash;This u&s;urped authority, now in the hand of Cromwell, &s;hall &s;hortly be at an end.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It contined only four years.</NOTE> England &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed with meek kings, and with a mild government, and powerful preachers. But good &s;ermons to them will be but as mu&s;ick to a &s;leepy man; they &s;hall hear, but not under&s;tand, nor lay the word to heart, to practi&s;e it in their lives, and walk by it. O England! thou &s;halt wax old in wickedne&s;s; and thy &s;ins abound like tho&s;e of Sodom; thy voluptuou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall cry aloud for vengeance; and the Lord &s;hall

Ob&s;erve, my dear friends, while you live, my calcu|lation of the dates in the book of the Reve|lations, and in Daniel, which the Spirit of the Lord led me into; for the Lord will
<PB N="6" REF="027229_0006_0FD3E80DED5C07B0">reveal it to &s;ome of his own, e'er that time come; for the nearer the time is, the &s;eals &s;hall be taken away, and more and more &s;hall be revealed to God's People; for the Lord doth nothing without he reveal it, by his Spirit, to his Servants the Prophets. He de&s;troyed not the old world without the knowledge of Noah.&mdash;He did not overthrow Sodom and Gomorrah without the know|ledge of Abraham. I do not mean now, that any new Prophet &s;hall ari&s;e: But the Lord by his Spirit &s;hall can&s;e knowledge to abound among his people, whereby the old prophe|cies &s;hall be clearly and perfectly under|&s;tood. And I die in that thought, and really believe that my calculation will be found true, on the Revelation by St. John, and the prophecy which St. Jerome copied off, and tran&s;lated out of the Hebrew Language, as it is written on Seth's Pillar in Dama&s;cus; which pillar is &s;aid to have &s;tood &s;ince and be|fore the flood, and was built by Seth, Adam's &s;on, and written by Enoch the Prophet; as likewi&s;e the holy precepts, whereby the Pa|triarchs walked, before the law was given to Mo&s;es, which were al&s;o engraven on the &s;aid Pillar; whereof many Jews have copies, in their own language, written on parchment, and engraven on bra&s;s and copper, This pro|phecy is entitled, "A &s;hort work of the Lord's, in the latter age of the world."</P>

<HEAD>The la&s;t Words of the Reverend <HI>CHRISTOPHER LOVE.</HI> Mini&s;ter of <HI>Laurence Jury, London,</HI> who was beheaded on <HI>Tower-Hill, Augu&s;t 22, 1651,</HI> in the time of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s u&s;urpa|tion, under pretence of his plotting again&s;t it. His words on the &s;caffold were the&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>"ALTHOUGH there be but little be|tween me and death, yet this bears up my heart, there is little between me and heaven. It comforted Dr. Taylor, the martyr, when he was going to execution, that there were but two &s;tiles between him and his Father's hou&s;e: There is a le&s;&s;er way between me and my Father's hou&s;e, but two &s;teps between me and glory. It is but laying down my head upon that block, and I &s;hall a&s;cend upon a throne. I am this day &s;ailing towards the ocean of eternity, through a rough pa&s;&s;age to my haven of re&s;t; through a red &s;ea to the promi&s;ed land. Methinks I hear God &s;ay to me, as he did to Mo&s;es, <HI>Go up to Mount Neho, and die there;</HI> &s;o to me, <HI>Go up to Tower-Hill, and die there.</HI> I&s;aac &s;aid of him&s;elf, that he was old, and yet he knew not the day of his death; But I cannot &s;ay &s;o; I am young, and yet I know the day of my death, and I know the kind of my death, and the place of my death al&s;o.
<PB N="9" REF="027229_0009_0FD3E813EC4BC860">I am put to &s;uch a kind of death, as two fa|mous preachers of the go&s;pel were before me, <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t, and <HI>Paul</HI> the Apo&s;tle. They were both beheaded. I read, Rev. xxth, 4th, <HI>The &s;aints were beheaded for the word of God, and the te&s;timony of Je&s;us.</HI> But herein is the di&s;advantage which I lie under, in the thoughts of &s;ome; they judge that I &s;uffer not for the word of God, or for con&s;cience, but for meddling with State matters.&mdash;To this I &s;hall briefly &s;ay, that it is an old trick of Satan, to impute the cau&s;e of God's people's &s;ufferings to be contrivements again&s;t the State; when, in truth, it is their religion and con&s;cience they are per&s;ecuted for. The Rulers of I&s;rael would have put Jeremiah to death upon a civil account, though indeed it was only the truth of his prophecy that made the rulers angry with him; and yet upon a civil account they pretended he mu&s;t die; becau&s;e he fell away to the Chaldeans, and would have brought in foreign forces to in|vade them. The &s;ame thing is laid to my charge, of which I am as innocent as Jere|miah was. So Paul, though he did but preach Je&s;us Chri&s;t, yet his enemies would have him put to death under pretence that he was a mover of &s;edition. Upon a civil account my life is pretended to be taken away; whereas, it is becau&s;e I pur&s;ue my
<PB N="10" REF="027229_0010_0FD3E813F24A1D70">covenant, and will not pro&s;titute my princi|ples and con&s;cience to the ambition and the lu&s;ts of men. I had rather die a covenant-keeper, than live a covenant-breaker.&mdash; Beloved, I am this day making a double exchange: I am changing a pulpit for a &s;caffold, and a &s;caffold for a throne,&mdash;And I might add a third, I am changing the pre&s;ence of this numerous multitude upon Tower-Hill, for the innumerable company of &s;aints and angels in Heaven, the holy Hill of Zion; and I am changing a guard of &s;oldiers for a guard of angels, which will receive me, and carry me to Abraham's bo&s;om. This &s;caffold is the be&s;t pulpit that ever I preached in. In my church pulpit, God, through his grace, made me an in&s;tru|ment to bring others to heaven; but in this pulpit he will bring me to heaven."</P>
<P>Afterwards he &s;aid, "Though my blood be not the blood of nobles, yet it is Chri&s;tian blood, mini&s;ter's blood; yea more, it is in|nocent blood. I magnify the riches of God's grace and mercy towards me, that I, who was born in Wales, an ob&s;cure country, and of ob&s;cure parents, &s;hould be &s;ingled out to honourable &s;ufferings. For the fir&s;t fourteen years of my life, I never heard a &s;ermon preached; yet in the fifteenth year of my life it plea&s;ed God to convert me. Ble&s;&s;ed
<PB N="11" REF="027229_0011_0FD3E81548369D88">be God, who not only made me a chri&s;tian, but al&s;o a mini&s;ter, judging me faithful, and putting me into the mini&s;try, which is my glory, I had rather be a preacher in the pulpit than a prince on the throne. I had rather be an in&s;trument to bring &s;ouls to heaven, than that all nations &s;hould bring tribute to me.&mdash;Formerly (&s;aid he) I have been under a &s;pirit of bondage; yea, &s;ome|times I have had more fear in drawing out a tooth, than now I have for cutting off my head. When fear was upon me, death was not near; now, when death is near to me, my fear is evani&s;hed.&mdash;I am comforted in this, though men kill me, they cannot damn me; though they thru&s;t me out of the world, yet they cannot &s;hut me out of heaven.&mdash; When I have &s;hed my blood, I expect the full declaration of the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins through the blood of Chri&s;t. I am going to my long home, and ye to your &s;hort homes; but I &s;hall be at my home before you be at yours."</P>
<P>When the executioner was rai&s;ing the fatal axe, Mr. Love's neck being placed acro&s;s the block to receive it, he prayed. That, <HI>&s;eeing he was called to do the work which he never did, he might have the &s;trength which he never had.</HI> The blow followed, and fevered the head from the trunk.</P>
