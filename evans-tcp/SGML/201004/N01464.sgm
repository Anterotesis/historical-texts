<P>IT is &s;ad to con&s;ider how many <HI>Pro|fe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians</HI> live in the <HI>Utter Neglect</HI> of the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> and how few <HI>Communicants</HI> are careful to <HI>Pre|pare duly, Eat and Drink worthily, and Live an&s;werably.</HI></P>
<P>A great deal has been written upon this <HI>Occa&s;ion,</HI> to which I have added the following <HI>Sheets,</HI> which I may be allow'd, I hope, to Publi&s;h, without being thought to pretend to any thing Extraordinary, or detract from the <HI>Excellent Performances</HI> of others.</P>
<P>For while the Ca&s;e requires and admits Help, there can be no Harm in making
<PB REF="001739_0003_0FB77C146637D040">further Trials; e&s;pecially in tho&s;e Circum|&s;tances where the mo&s;t likely Means are not ever the mo&s;t Effectual: But Succe&s;s more e&s;pecially depends upon the <HI>Divine Ble|&s;&s;ing,</HI> which is not always given in Regular Proportion to the Natural Aptitude of the Means, but &s;ometimes in a &s;overeign and unaccountable Manner; <HI>That no Fle&s;h &s;hould Glory in his Pre&s;ence.</HI></P>
<P>However, it is too plain to be deny'd, That the <HI>different Capacities and Re|li&s;hes</HI> of Men make a <HI>Variety</HI> u&s;eful, if not nece&s;&s;ary; and that there may be a Con|currence of many <HI>other Circum&s;tances</HI> which &s;hall give a meaner Performance, the Advantage with &s;ome People, as to U&s;efulne&s;s, above others that are more Spritely and Elaborate. Nay, it is no im|po&s;&s;ible Thing, that a man may read a Book upon &s;ome fore in Con&s;ideration, which &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed to do Him that good which could never be expected from better Di&s;|cour&s;es not known of, or not minded.</P>

Upon the&s;e Accounts I have Publi&s;h'd the en&s;uing <HI>Papers,</HI> hoping they may be u&s;eful to <HI>&s;ome,</HI> whatever their <HI>General</HI> Entertainment be.</P>

<P>LET me now, O my Soul, prepare for my Preparations. Let me lay down the Plan of my De&s;ign, that I may not be at a Lo&s;s how to manage, but may go regularly on without that Con|fu&s;ion of Thought which will le&s;&s;en the Plea&s;ure and Profit of my Work.</P>
<P>There appears to be &s;everal Branches of that Bu&s;ine&s;s, which is called by the General Name of Preparation. But be|fore I enter upon Particulars, I would fir&s;t be deeply po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Nece&s;&s;ity

<P>To this End con&s;ider clo&s;ely, that an unprepar'd Communicant mu&s;t nece&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|rily be an unworthy one.

<P>To <HI>eat and drink Judgment to ones fel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> can &s;ignify no le&s;s than falling under the Di&s;plea&s;ure of the Living God. And
