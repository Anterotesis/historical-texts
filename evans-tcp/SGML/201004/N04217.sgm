<HEAD>THE <HI>Danger</HI> of an <HI>unqualified</HI> Mini&s;try.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>I TIMOTHY iii. 6.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Not a NOVICE; le&s;t being lifted up with Pride, he fall into the Condemnation of the Devil.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE Introduction of well qualified Per&s;ons into the mini&s;terial Office, being of &s;uch Importance to the true Intere&s;t of Chri&s;tianity, it was found worthy of <HI>apo&s;tolick</HI> In&s;pection and Care. Ac|cordingly we find the <HI>Apo&s;tle Paul,</HI> the in&s;pired and learned Writer of this <HI>Epi&s;tle,</HI> filling up <HI>&s;ix Ver&s;es,</HI> in the Beginning of this Chapter, with &s;erious Advice and Cau|tion to <HI>Timothy</HI> about it, and pur&s;uing the &s;ame Argument in many other Pa&s;&s;ages of his <HI>Epi&s;tles.</HI></P>
<P>The great <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> fir&s;t of all, allows it to be a <HI>true and faith|ful Saying, that if a Man de&s;ire the Office of a Bi&s;hop,</HI> an Over|&s;eer and Teacher in the Church of CHRIST, <HI>he de&s;ireth a good Work;</HI> an honourable (however, at the &s;ame Time, a labori|ous and dangerous) Function. It is a mo&s;t u&s;eful and &s;acred Employment, a <HI>good Work,</HI> whereby the Glory of CHRIST, and the Salvation of Men are greatly promoted: For 'tis the evident De&s;ign of the In&s;titution of the <HI>evangelical Mini&s;try</HI> to in&s;truct and &s;ave a mi&s;erable World, and thereby advance the Glory of <HI>divine Grace.</HI></P>
<P>The good <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> then proceeds to ennumerate the &s;uperior and nece&s;&s;ary Qualifications of <HI>a Bi&s;hop,</HI> or <HI>good Mini&s;ter</HI> of JESUS CHRIST, which <HI>Timothy</HI> mu&s;t carefully ob&s;erve, in admitting Per&s;ons to this high and &s;acred Office; which
<PB N="6" REF="005198_0005_1016E1C7749E2B48">amount to no le&s;s than <HI>&s;ixteen in the &s;ix following Ver&s;es, viz. A Bi&s;hop mu&s;t be blamele&s;s; The Hu&s;band of one Wife,</HI> that is, <Q>One that has not put away his Wife for every Cau&s;e (as the Manner of &s;ome then was) and married another;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> in Loc.</NOTE></Q> <HI>vigilant; &s;ober; of good Behaviour; given to Ho&s;pitality;</HI> APT TO TEACH; <HI>not given to Wine; no Striker; not greedy of fil|thy Lucre, but patient; not a Brawler; not covetous: one that ruleth well his own Hou&s;e, having his Children in Subjection with all Gravity; for if a Man know not how to rule his own Hou&s;e, how &s;hall he take Care of the Church of God?</HI></P>
<P>The fifteenth Qualification of a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter, which the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> here gives <HI>Timothy,</HI> is contained in this wi&s;e Caution, viz. NOT A NOVICE; <HI>that is,</HI> as 'tis expre&s;&s;ed in the Mar|gin of the Bible, <HI>one newly come to the Faith:</HI> Plainly intima|ting, that a <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> mu&s;t be well in&s;tructed and e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Faith. <HI>Every Scribe, which is in&s;tructed unto the Kingdom of Heaven, is like unto a Man that is an Hou&s;holder, which bring|eth forth out of his Trea&s;ure Things new and old.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matth.</HI> 13, 52.</NOTE></P>
<P>The <HI>Greek</HI> Word an&s;wering to the Engli&s;h one, NOVICE, is <HI>Neophutos,</HI> "Which properly &s;ignifies, one that is but newly planted, or in&s;tructed in the Faith." "A raw young Chri&s;|tian." And this in&s;pired <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> ab&s;olutely forbids, that &s;uch an one &s;hould be admitted into <HI>holy Orders.</HI> And the &s;ubjoins a very &s;olemn Rea&s;on, which loudly be&s;peaks the great Danger of &s;uch an one's Undertaking this Mini&s;try; viz. <HI>Le&s;t being lifted up with Pride, he fall into the Condemnation of the Devil:</HI> both into the Devil's <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Puni&s;hment.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> well ob&s;erves, that <HI>Neophutos,</HI> NOVICE, "Signifies not in Re&s;pect of Age," for <HI>Timothy</HI> him&s;elf was &s;uch, yet the Apo&s;tle gave him Authority to command and teach in the Church, and &s;uffered no Man to de&s;pi&s;e <HI>his Youth:</HI> But it "&s;ignifies in Re&s;pect of receiving the Faith," one new|ly brought over to the Profe&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;tian Faith, whe|ther young or old. So then according to the genuine U&s;e of the Word, a Man may be a Novice, or Babe in under&s;tand|ing the My&s;teries of the Go&s;pel, and &s;o very unqualified to un|dertake the mini&s;terial Office, who, in <HI>Re&s;pect of Age,</HI> may be honoured as a <HI>Father</HI> or <HI>Ma&s;ter:</HI> And on the other Hand, a
<PB N="7" REF="005198_0006_1016E1F5EDF313A8">Per&s;on that is <HI>young in Years</HI> may yet be freed from the Im|putation of a <HI>Novice,</HI> as was young <HI>Timothy</HI> in Re&s;pect of his good moral and mini&s;terial Accompli&s;hments, and &s;o be coun|ted worthy of &s;ome eccle&s;ia&s;tical Dignity and Preferment.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Qualification of a <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> here mentioned, is, in the 7 Ver. in the&s;e Words, <HI>He mu&s;t have a good Report of them which are without, le&s;t he fall into Reproach, and the Snare of the Devil,</HI></P>
<P>Such are the Apo&s;tolick Directions here given to <HI>Timothy</HI> about introducing Men into the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try; and they are of &s;tanding U&s;e to the Church of CHRIST, and &s;hould be carefully ob&s;erved by all tho&s;e who&s;e Office it is to confer <HI>holy Orders.</HI> Hence the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> al&s;o adds that &s;olemn Caution, in the fifth Chapter of this Epi&s;tle and twenty-&s;econd Ver&s;e, <HI>Lay Hands &s;uddenly on no Man.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall now give you the Sum of the whole Matter in this doctrinal Note, viz.</P>
<P><HI>Doct.</HI> That it is of very dangerous Tendency for <HI>unqualified</HI> Per&s;ons to be <HI>employed in the &s;acred Mini&s;try:</HI> Or, that the <HI>Pa&s;|tors of the Churches</HI> &s;hould u&s;e <HI>great Caution and Vigilance in admitting Per&s;ons to the mini&s;terial Office.</HI> For the Danger of putting un&s;uitable and unqualified Men into the evangelical Mini&s;try is much every Way, tho' the <HI>Text</HI> confines it to the Per&s;ons that dare invade this &s;acred Office in a State of NO|VICESHIP.</P>
<P>But yet, as Nece&s;&s;ity is laid upon the Officers of the Church to exclude &s;uch from the Mini&s;try, they are in Danger of in|volving them&s;elves in the &s;ame Guilt and Condemnation, by opening a wide Door of Entrance, and pro&s;tituting the holy Mini&s;try to every bold Intruder. <HI>Be not Partaker of other Men's Sins, that ye receive not of their Plagues.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, &s;uch unfaithful Mini&s;ters are the very In&s;truments of enhancing the Guilt and Puni&s;hment of every &s;uch <HI>Novice,</HI> by admitting them to a Dignity and Office for which they have not one <HI>canonical</HI> Qualification. This is the Mean of <HI>lifting them up with Pride,</HI> and precipitating them into the <HI>Condemna|tion of the Devil.</HI> So then, the <HI>Danger</HI> of employing <HI>unqua|lified</HI> Men in the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> is greater, and of more exten&s;ive bad Influence than is at fir&s;t imagined; yea, the important Intere&s;t of Chri&s;tianity is va&s;tly affected by this prepo&s;terous
<PB N="8" REF="005198_0007_1016E1C904A3CE20">and evil Practice, as may be &s;hewn in the Sequel of this Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Danger</HI> hereof is great,
<LIST>
<ITEM>Fir&s;t, To every NOVICE who undertakes the Work of the Mini&s;try.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly, To every <HI>Officer in the Church</HI> who authori&s;eth their Mi&s;&s;ion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Thirdly, The Danger hereof is great to the <HI>Souls</HI> of them that are <HI>taught and led by them.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Fourthly, The Mini&s;try of unqualified Men is of very dangerous and de&s;tructive Tendency to the <HI>true Intere&s;t of Religion.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Sea&s;onablene&s;s and Importance of this Subject, in the&s;e Times, led my Thoughts to the Choice of it, when my <HI>Re|verend Brother</HI> asked me to &s;tand in his Place, and be his Mo|nitor upon this &s;olemn Occa&s;ion. He &amp; others mu&s;t take it as a &s;ure Token of my unfeigned Love to him, &amp; De&s;ire to &s;erve him, that I have taken this Work upon me, under great Infir|mity of Body &amp; Mind: And this mu&s;t be my Apology for the many Defects, this venerable Audience may doubtle&s;s di&s;cover in the Performance. <HI>Brethren I am with you in Weakne&s;s, in much Fear and Trembling.</HI> But in a humble Dependance on the Help of Divine Grace, &s;hall endeavour to &s;peak as the <HI>O|racles of GOD,</HI> and mini&s;ter as of <HI>the Ability which GOD giv|eth.</HI> And whil&s;t in <HI>our Doctrine we &s;hew Uncorruptne&s;s, Gra|vity, Sincerity, and &s;ound Speech,</HI> we ought not to <HI>be condemned: Why then do&s;t thou find Fault? To the Law, and to the Te&s;ti|mony; if they &s;peak not according to this Word, it is becau&s;e there is no Light in them.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>I&s;a.</HI> 8.20.</NOTE> Happy is he that condemneth not him&s;elf in that Thing which he alloweth.</HI> But to proceed,&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. To &s;hew, in the fir&s;t Place, the <HI>dangerous State and Sci|tuation of every</HI> NOVICE, <HI>who undertakes the Work of the Mini&s;try.</HI></P>
<P>The great and learned <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> repre&s;ents it in &s;trong and aw|ful Terms; <HI>Le&s;t being lifted up with Pride, he fall into the Condemnation of the Devil.</HI> Such is the fearful Expectation of an in&s;pired <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> concerning &s;uch as intrude them&s;elves into the &s;acred Mini&s;try, without &s;ome due previous Qualifications
<PB N="9" REF="005198_0008_1016E1F7787723A0">for it. He repre&s;ents them as expo&s;ing them&s;elves to violent Temptation, and terrible Condemnation: They are <HI>in Danger of the Judgment.</HI> Their Danger is great whether they know it, or not. The Mouth of an in&s;pired <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> has declared and forewarned them of it. St. <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf was well acquainted with the Infirmities and Temptations of Chri&s;tians in general, and Mini&s;ters in particular; he experimentally knew the Dan|ger, even an <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> of CHRIST was in, of being <HI>lifted up with Pride,</HI> through extraordinary Manife&s;tations of GOD unto him, as he him&s;elf expre&s;&s;eth it for his own Humiliation, and the In&s;truction of all Ages, in 2 Cor. 12.7, 8, 9. <HI>Le&s;t I &s;hould be exalted above Mea&s;ure, through the Abundance of the Reve|lations, there was given to me a Thorn in the Fle&s;h, the Me&s;&s;enger of Satan to buffet me.&mdash;For this Thing I be&s;ought the LORD thrice, that it might depart from me.</HI> But what &s;aith the An|&s;wer of GOD his <HI>Saviour</HI> unto him? <HI>My Grace is &s;ufficient for thee, for my Strength is made perfect in Weakne&s;s.</HI> It is enough that this Affliction is given thee for thy Good, and that I &s;upport thee under it. Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A Novice, by being admitted to the Dignity of an Amba&s;|&s;ador for CHRIST, is in Danger of being lifted up with Pride.</HI> Having but lately profe&s;s'd, and been initiated into the Chri|&s;tian Faith by the &s;acred Rites thereto belonging, he may be peculiarly expo&s;ed to this <HI>&s;piritual</HI> and <HI>devili&s;h Lu&s;t,</HI> whether he be really &s;anctified, or not.</P>
<P>If he be only <HI>externally called</HI> to be a <HI>Saint,</HI> and not really converted, he only heaps up Fuel to feed this <HI>fooli&s;h and hurt|ful Lu&s;t,</HI> by all his high and &s;pecious Profe&s;&s;ions of Godline&s;s. <HI>Pride</HI> has an ab&s;olute A&s;cendency and Dominion over him, and he walks in <HI>Pride,</HI> at the &s;ame Time that he puts on the Cloak of religious Zeal. He makes a <HI>fair Shew in the Fle&s;h,</HI> that he may more &s;ecurely indulge his unmortified Lu&s;ts, and Pa&s;&s;ions, and hugs his Pride. And thus he endeavours to &s;anc|tify all the deceitful Workings of it by a forward &s;anctimonious Zeal for the Glory of GOD and the Good of Men.</P>
<P>GOD knows the reigning Pride and Naughtine&s;s of his Heart, at the &s;ame Time that he pretends to be high in the Favour of GOD, zealous for his Glory, and crucified to the World: And <HI>when he is judged, he &s;hall be condemned.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="005198_0009_1016E1CBABE22568">
He al&s;o that has but newly embraced the Chri&s;tian Faith, and received CHRIST, may al&s;o be under peculiar and &s;trong Temptations to Pride and Vanity, by receiving eccle&s;ia&s;tical Preferment; e&s;pecially, if he be brought out of a State of dark Heatheni&s;m into this marvellous Light anti Grace. A true Convert may be ju&s;tly &s;tiled a <HI>Novice</HI> in the Things of GOD, and deemed very unworthy of the mini&s;terial Office. So great a Dignity, &s;o &s;uddenly be&s;towed on him, may tempt him to Pride, &s;uch a Preferment in the Church tends directly to feed his Pride; and exalt him above Mea&s;ure. For there is the Remainder of this &s;piritual Lu&s;t in the Regenerate, and it is a &s;ecret and dangerous Enemy to their Salvation; and alas! who are in more Danger of falling into this <HI>Snare of the De|vil</HI> than Per&s;ons of little Knowledge, and great Zeal? Or than <HI>Novices</HI> in Religion?</P>
<P>Such Per&s;ons are very unfit to have the In&s;truction and Go|vernment of the Church committed to them, however wi&s;e and &s;ufficient they are in their own Conceits for the&s;e Things. This Affectation of being Teachers in the Church of CHRIST may, and doth commonly ari&s;e from bad Cau&s;es; &s;uch as gro&s;s Ignorance, Partiality, Pride, Self-Conceit, Love of po|pular Applau&s;es, Pre&s;umption and Confidence; and &s;uch as are influenced by it would do well to examine and know them|&s;elves, and the Principles and Motives by which they are rul|ed; for 'tis no uncommon Thing to &s;ee the wor&s;t De&s;igns covered under the goodly Appearance of religious Zeal, and high Pretences to the SPIRIT.</P>
<P><HI>Novices</HI> are <HI>Babes in Under&s;tanding,</HI> and have Need that one teach them which be the <HI>fir&s;t Principles of the Oracles of GOD,</HI> in&s;tead of taking to them&s;elves the Office of publick Teach|ers. Ignorance, Conceit, and Pride too often con&s;i&s;t together in the &s;ame Subject, and betray Per&s;ons into wild and extra|vagant Conduct. We read in I Cor. 4.19. <HI>Of the Speech of them which are puffed up.</HI> Such are apt to boa&s;t of a fal&s;e Gift, and pride them&s;elves in &s;ome high Accompli&s;hments, which exi&s;t only in their vain Imaginations. The Scripture &s;uppo&s;eth that a <HI>Man may think him&s;elf to be &s;omething, when he is nothing,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal. 6.3.</NOTE> and thereby deceive him&s;elf, and not only &s;o,
<PB N="11" REF="005198_0010_1016E1FA968B06D0">but be a Deri&s;ion al&s;o to all about him. <HI>Be not wi&s;e in your own Conceits.</HI></P>
<P>Pride has always been the Bane of the Church, as it was the Ruin of the Devil. And how my&s;terious &s;oever it be, that Pride &s;hould enter into &s;uch pure, intellectual Beings, as were the fallen Angels in their fir&s;t E&s;tate, yet it is not at all &s;trange to account for the Working of it in an apo&s;tate Crea|ture. It is here in&s;inuated that Pride was the Devil's Sin, what threw him headlong into Perdition; this is the Offspring of the Devil, and full of all Subtilty and Mi&s;chief, the Spirit that worketh in the Children of Di&s;obedience, and <HI>that lu&s;teth to Envy</HI> in the Regenerate.</P>
<P>"It &s;eems the Devil was tempted by the glorious Condition wherein he was created to a&s;pire after the <HI>Godhead,</HI>" and be as GOD; and this was the Snare the Devil laid to &s;educe &amp; ruin our fir&s;t Parents in their primitive and exalted State. For &s;o the Devil in&s;inuates to our Mother <HI>Eve, That God knew, that in the Day they eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, then their Eyes &s;hould be opened, and they &s;hould be as Gods, know|ing Good and Evil.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. 3.5.</NOTE> So that a dignified State is not out of the Reach of Temptation to Pride; but &s;uch as receive ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Honours may be expo&s;ed to peculiar and dangerous Temptations. E&s;pecially <HI>Novices</HI> are in great Danger of growing giddy and lordly in &s;uch an elevated State in the Church; and &s;uch Per&s;ons indeed mo&s;t commonly <HI>love to have the Preheminence,</HI> and are mo&s;t apt to be confident, a&s;&s;uming and de&s;irous of <HI>vain Glory.</HI> Vain Man has naturally an in&s;a|tiable Thir&s;t after Honour, not con&s;idering that Promotion is a mighty Incentive to Pride.</P>
<P>Pride, Pride is the Enemy of all Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the true Source of Abundance of Mi&s;chief to the Church of GOD. The wi&s;e Man ob&s;erves, <HI>Only by Pride cometh Contention;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. 13.10.</NOTE> though it has many Coverings and Windings to hide and transform it &s;elf in. The Working of it is after the <HI>Working of Satan,</HI> with all Deceivablene&s;s and cunning Craftine&s;s. <HI>From whence come Wars and Fightings</HI> Schi&s;ms, Errors, Here&s;ies, Di&s;orders, Intru&s;ions, Confu&s;ions, Emu|lations, Hatred, Wrath, Strife in the Church of CHRIST?
<PB N="12" REF="005198_0011_1016E1CE75A667D0">Come they not hence, even of this devili&s;h Lu&s;t of Pride? This al&s;o is like to be the Plague and Pe&s;t of the Church, 'till this Enemy &s;hall be de&s;troyed, when the Church &s;hall com|mence triumphant. <HI>Then cometh the End when he &s;hall have delivered up the Kingdom to GOD, even the FATHER, when he &s;hall have put down all Rule, and all Authority, and Power; for he mu&s;t reign, 'till he hath put all Enemies under his Feet.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 15.24, 15.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A Novice by being promoted to eccle&s;ia&s;tical Dignity is in Danger of falling into the Condemnation of the Devil:</HI> For &s;o the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> teacheth us, le&s;t&mdash;<HI>he fall into the Condemnation of the Devil.</HI> This is the Condemnation that is mo&s;t dreadful and amazing.</P>
<P>Pride was the leading Step, the &s;ad Prologue and Pre&s;age to that Condemnation into which the Devil fell, who was ca&s;t out of Heaven into the Torments of Hell. This is the Con|demnation of the Devil. Saith the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter, God &s;pa|red not the Angels that &s;inned, but ca&s;t them down to Hell, and delivered them into Chains of Darkne&s;s, to be re&s;erved unto Judgment.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pet. 2.4.</NOTE> So true is the wi&s;e Man's Ob&s;ervation, <HI>Pride goeth before De&s;truction, and an haughty Spirit before a Fall.</HI></P>
<P>The Devil, and our fir&s;t Parents, and the Children of Pride, have found it &s;o of a Truth by a woful Experience: <HI>Tho&s;e that walk in Pride, he is able to aba&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Places of the highe&s;t Dignity in Church and State, are com|monly the mo&s;t &s;lippery and dangerous; and it may be the Pinacle of the Temple, the highe&s;t Preferments in the Church, are of all others the mo&s;t &s;o.&mdash;Which Con&s;ideration is enough, one would think, to re&s;train the Ambition of vain Minds, to influence all that are Candidates for the mini&s;terial Office and Dignity, to enter upon it with Humility, Fear and Trembling, and with the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Views and De&s;igns.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Novices,</HI> or <HI>unqualified</HI> Per&s;ons, who thru&s;t them&s;elves into the <HI>Office of a Bi&s;hop,</HI> and take this Honour to them|&s;elves they are in manife&s;t Danger of falling into the Con|demnation of the Devil. Hence we have that wi&s;e Caution of the Apo&s;tle <HI>James, My Brethren, be not many Ma&s;ters or

<P>Secondly, <HI>The admitting unqualified Per&s;ons into the Mi|ni&s;try, is of dangerous Con&s;equence to tho&s;e that authori&s;e their Mi&s;&s;ion.</HI> Herein they are acce&s;&s;ary to their Ruin, for by ex|alting them to be publick Teachers in the Church, they exalt them above Mea&s;ure, and lead them into the <HI>Snare of the De|vil,</HI> and &s;o are chargeable with great Guilt, as is plainly inti|mated in the forementioned Pa&s;&s;ages; <HI>Lay Hands &s;uddenly on no Man, neither be Partaker of other Men's Sins, keep thy &s;elf pure,</HI> pure from the Blood of all Men: As if one Way for the Over&s;eers of the Flocks to keep them&s;elves pure and inno|cent from Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is, to u&s;e proper Caution about filling up the Mini&s;try, and &s;hutting the Door of Ordination again&s;t all unqualified Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>And indeed the encouraging &s;uch Novices to undertake the Charge and Care of Souls, argues a great Degree of Unfaith|fulne&s;s in the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, and expo&s;eth them to di|vine and eccle&s;ia&s;tical Cen&s;ure. Moreover, the Souls of &s;uch daring Intruders, and the Souls of them that are committed to their Tru&s;t, are greatly endangered by the Un&s;kilfulne&s;s of &s;uch blind Guides. How then will the Rulers in the Church, who are continually negligent in this Matter, be able to give an Account of their Steward&s;hip to the Judge of all? The Blood of Souls may be required of them: E&s;pecially the Souls of &s;uch <HI>Novices</HI> whom they have been in&s;trumental of lifting up with Pride, and &s;o delivering unto Satan: For by con|ferring this Honour upon them, they have given them a pow|erful Incentive to Lu&s;t, and cannot be innocent.</P>
<P>Furthermore, by a &s;ervile Compliance with that <HI>Spirit that lu&s;teth</HI> to Pride and Dominion, Mini&s;ters ba&s;ely betray the im|portant Tru&s;t Chri&s;t has committed to them: And &s;uch a licentious Practice is directly contrary to &s;acred Canon, parti|cularly 2 Tim. 2.2. <HI>The Things that thou ha&s;t heard of me a|mong many Witne&s;&s;es, the &s;ame commit thou to faithful Men, who &s;hall be</HI> ABLE TO TEACH OTHERS ALSO.</P>
<P>Not but that <HI>Novices</HI> may artfully creep into the Church, after all the Precaution and Vigilance of its faithful Pa&s;tors; but then, if their Admi&s;&s;ion be not owing to the criminal
<PB N="14" REF="005198_0013_1016E1D21DA89B08">Neglect of CHRIST'S Mini&s;ters, in examining and proving them, he will not impute it to them for Sin.</P>
<P>However, what is here pleaded for is, that the Officers of Church, that are concern'd in this important Affair, &s;hould be very careful to acquaint them&s;elves with the good Qualificati|ons of tho&s;e whom they put into the Mini&s;try, and not act with an implicit blind Faith in an Affair of CHRIST'S King|dom, upon which &s;o much Good depends.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve the <HI>apo&s;tolick</HI> religious Care with which the <HI>College</HI> of the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> was filled up, after the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and tra|gical End of <HI>Judas the Traitor,</HI> as it is expre&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t Chapter of <HI>Acts. Of the&s;e Men,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Peter</HI> to the Di&s;ciples, <HI>which have companied with us all the Time that the Lord Je&s;us went in and out among us&mdash;mu&s;t one be ordained to be a Witne&s;s with us of his Re&s;urrection, and they appointed two,&mdash;and they prayed, and &s;aid, Thou, Lord, which knowe&s;t the Hearts of all Men, &s;hew whether of the&s;e two thou ha&s;t cho&s;en, that he may take Part of this Mini&s;try, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This was doubtle&s;s written for the Direction and Admoni|tion of the Church in all Ages, and the Pa&s;tors of the Churches &s;hould remember how they have received and heard, and hold fa&s;t the <HI>faithful Word.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>The admitting unqualified Per&s;ons into the Mini&s;try, is very dangerous and de&s;tructive to the Souls of &s;uch as are led of them.</HI> This is of very dangerous Tendency to tho&s;e, to whom they are &s;ent to mini&s;ter. For not being po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with an awful Sen&s;e of the Worth of Souls, and the Importance of the mini&s;terial Office, nor influenced by Chri&s;tian Motives in the Undertaking of it, nor qualified to feed the Church of GOD, the precious Souls of Men will be in utmo&s;t Haz|zard of peri&s;hing under the Mini&s;try of &s;uch <HI>Novices.</HI></P>
<P>Such are apt to be confident enough that they <HI>them&s;elves are Guides of the Blind,</HI> and LIGHTS of <HI>them which are in Dark|ne&s;s;</HI> whereas it would be much more &s;afe and becoming for them to be jealous of them&s;elves, and with the mo&s;t &s;erious Self-Reflection <HI>take Heed that the</HI> Light <HI>which is in them be not Darkne&s;s.</HI> Thou which teache&s;t another, teache&s;t thou not thy &s;elf? <HI>Thou blind Pari&s;ee!

<P>Sad and dangerous indeed is the State of the Church, when it is &s;o for&s;aken of GOD, as to be left to the Care of un&s;kilful and unfaithful Guides. GOD complains of &s;uch in the <HI>Jewi&s;h Church</HI> in old Time. <HI>The Leaders of this People cau&s;e them to err, and they that are led of them are de&s;troyed.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. 9.16.</NOTE> <HI>His Watchmen and blind, they are all ignorant.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 26.10.</NOTE> Such al&s;o was the heavy Charge our ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Saviour</HI> fa&s;tens upon the <HI>Jewi&s;h Teachers</HI> in his Time. <HI>They be blind Leaders of the Blind.</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> 15.14.</NOTE> And he pro|nounces a dreadful Wo unto them, <HI>Wo unto you, ye blind Guides.</HI> It is the greate&s;t Cur&s;e of GOD that can fall upon a &s;inful People, to &s;mite their Teachers with Blindne&s;s, and give them up to the Conduct of &s;uch blind Guides.</P>
<P>But Thanks be to God, this, I firmly believe, has never been the unhappy Ca&s;e of his People in this Land, from the Days of our Fathers to this Time: But GOD has highly favoured us with a learned and enlightning, converted and converting Mini&s;try; Tho' &s;ome, with fiery Zeal, and but little Know|ledge and Di&s;cretion have of late fal&s;ly accu&s;ed the Body of the Clergy of this Country as <HI>"unconverted, and preaching an unknown Chri&s;t."

<P>Thus the <HI>Body</HI> of our Mini&s;try have been <HI>&s;landerou&s;ly</HI> re|ported by &s;ome, who&s;e <HI>Per&s;ons have been had in Admiration.</HI> And now, what is the Tendency and Effect of &s;uch a Spirit of Cen|&s;orious and ra&s;h Judging their Brethren, but as a worthy Di|vine of our own well expre&s;&s;es it, <Q>The filling the Minds of People with evil Surmi&s;ings, again&s;t their Mini&s;ters, as though they were for the mo&s;t Part, carnal unregenerate Wretches.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> in his late Treati&s;e, P. 140.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>This, this is the true Source of tho&s;e &s;candalous Separations, wherewith &s;ome of our Churches have been lately torn. <HI>The Lord pardon his Servants in this Thing,</HI> who have been unhap|pily in&s;trumental of rai&s;ing &s;uch a Spirit of Bitterne&s;s and Se|paration among the People of God, and may the good Lord rebuke it <HI>in his Time.</HI></P>

<P>Indeed, who&s;oever has a ju&s;t Apprehen&s;ion of the Great|ne&s;s, Difficulty and Importance of the evangelical Mini&s;try, needeth not Arguments to convince him of the Nece&s;&s;ity of encouraging and &s;upporting learned and godly Pa&s;tors in the Churches.

<P>Alas!

<P>And indeed the Revival of Learning, &s;ince the glorious Reformation, has been a great Elucidation and E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Truths of our holy Religion: So that the Enemies of good Literature are Enemies to the true Intere&s;t of Chri&s;tianity, whether they know it or not.</P>
<P>It has been publickly ob&s;erved, that the Intere&s;t of Religion and good Literature, have been wont to ri&s;e and fall toge|ther: Wherefore &s;ay <HI>our Fathers,</HI> <Q>As we de&s;ire that Reformation and Religion &s;hould flouri&s;h, it concerns us to endeavour, that both the College and all other Schools of Learning, in every Place, be duly in&s;pected and en|couraged<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI>'s Treati&s;e, P. 257, 8.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Alas! How &s;oon would the Church of God be laid de&s;o|late, if the Hedge of a learned, able and faithful Mini&s;try, which Chri&s;t hath &s;et about it, were once taken down.

Is not Know|ledge apt to puff us up, and make us Super&s;titious and Im|perious? Ready to lord it over GOD'S Heritage, and make us Bu&s;y-bodies in other Men's Matters, or Bi&s;hops in another Man's Dioce&s;s?</P>
<P>Doth not the empty Applau&s;e of Men, &s;erve to exalt us above Mea&s;ure, and feed the Pride and Vanity of our Minds.</P>
<P>Are we not too apt to &s;pend our precious Time in vain Di&s;putes and Wranglings, in&s;tead of &s;tudying to profit the Souls of our People both in Word and Doctrine.</P>
<P>Are we patient and penitent when we hear the Defaming of many? Oh let us examine our&s;elves, and labour to keep under and &s;ubdue this dangerous Lu&s;t, <HI>Le&s;t that by any Means when we have preached to others, we our&s;elves &s;hould be Ca&s;t|aways.</HI></P>
