<P>AS all the Prote&s;tant Churches in <HI>Europe,</HI> both <HI>Epi&s;co|palian</HI> &amp; <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> mo&s;t happily agreed at the&punc; Time of the Reformation in the Scripture <HI>Doctrines of Grace,</HI> as appears by the Harmony of their Confe&s;&s;ions publi&s;hed; in particular, the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> in 1560, the Church of <HI>England</HI> in 1562, 3, &amp; the Church of <HI>Ireland</HI> in 1616; &s;o it mu&s;t be own'd that the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> have generally per&s;evered in a &s;teady Adherence to the Original Doctrines of the Reformation, to the pre&s;ent Day.</P>
<P>And as the <HI>A&s;&s;embly's &s;horter Catechi&s;m</HI> has been all along agreable to the known Principles of the <HI>New-England</HI> Churches, &amp; has been generally received &amp; taught in them as a Sy&s;tem of Chri&s;tian Doctrine agreable to the HOLY SCRIPTURES, wherein they happily unite; It is a great Plea&s;ure to us that our <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Brethren who come from <HI>Ireland</HI> are generally with us in <HI>the&s;e important Points,</HI> as al&s;o in the particular <HI>Doctrines of experimental Piety</HI> ari&s;ing from them, &amp; the <HI>wondrous Work of</HI> GOD agreable to them at this Day making its triumphant Progre&s;s thro' the Land: all now happily combining to illu&s;trate &amp; con|firm each other in &s;o glaring &amp; &s;trong a Manner as is irre|&s;i&s;tible to &s;erious &amp; unprejudic'd Beholders; and has al|ready forced many Men of <HI>clear Minds, &s;trong Powers, con&s;iderable Knowledge,</HI> &amp; firmly riveted in the <HI>Arminian</HI> and <HI>Socinian</HI> Tenets, to give them all up at once &amp; yield to the adorable <HI>Sovereignty</HI> &amp; <HI>Irre&s;i&s;tibility</HI> of the DIVINE SPIRIT in his &s;aving Operations on the Souls of Men.</P>
<P>For to &s;ee on the one Hand &s;uch Men as the&s;e, <HI>&s;ome of them of licentious Lives,</HI> long inured in a Cour&s;e of Vices, and of high Spirits, coming to the Preaching of the Word, &s;ome only out of Curio&s;ity, others with a &s;trong Antipathy and meer De&s;ign to get Matter of Cavilling and Banter; all at once in Oppo&s;ition to their inward Enmity, Re&s;olutions, and Re&s;i&s;tances, to fall under an unexpected &amp; hated Power; to have all the Strength of their Re&s;olution &amp; Re&s;i&s;tance taken away; to have &s;uch an inward View of the horrid
<PB REF="004992_0005_100E51FE2C8BAFC0">Wickedne&s;s not only of their Lives, but al&s;o of their Hearts, with their exceeding great &amp; immediate Danger of eternal Mi&s;ery, as has amaz'd their Souls &amp; thrown them into Di&s;|tre&s;s unutterable, yea forc'd them to cry out in the A&s;&s;em|blies with the greate&s;t Agonies: and then in two or three Days &amp; &s;ometimes &s;ooner, to have &s;uch unexpected &amp; rai&s;ed Views of the infinite Grace &amp; Love of GOD in CHRIST, as have enabled them to believe in Him, lifted them at once out of their Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, filled their Hearts with Admiration and Joy un&s;peakable &amp; full of Glory, breaking forth in their &s;hining Countenance &amp; tran&s;porting Voices to the Surprize of tho&s;e about them: And to &s;ee them kindling up at once into a Flame of Love &amp; Prai&s;e GOD, an utter De|te&s;tation of their former Cour&s;es &amp; vicious Habits, yea by &s;uch a Dete&s;tation the very Power of tho&s;e Habits at once receive a mortal Wound. In &s;hort to &s;ee their high Spirits on a &s;udden humbled, their hard Hearts made tender, their Aver&s;ion from the Holy GOD now turn'd into a powerful and prevailing Bent to contemplate upon Him as reveal'd in CHRIST, to labour to be like Him in Holine&s;s, to plea&s;e and honour Him by a univer&s;al &amp; glad Conformity to his Will &amp; Nature, &amp; to promote his holy Kingdom in all about them; loving them, forgiving them, a&s;king Forgive|ne&s;s of them, abounding in Acts of Ju&s;tice, Charity, in a meek &amp; conde&s;cending Carriage towards them meane&s;t, and a&s;piring after higher Sanctity&mdash;</P>

<PB REF="004992_0006_100E5187D6B70488">never &s;een before: In &s;hort to find them&s;elves yet unrenew|ed in the Spirit of their Minds, &amp; under the heavy Wrath and Cur&s;e of GOD; to open into the clear Di&s;covery of their pa&s;t Delu&s;ions; to find the Hardne&s;s of their Hearts, the Blindne&s;s of their Minds, their utter Impotence to con|vert them&s;elves or believe in CHRIST; to loo&s;e all their former Confidence, give up their beloved Schemes, &s;ee them&s;elves undone &amp; helple&s;s, &amp; &s;ink into great Di&s;tre&s;s: and then condemning them&s;elves as guilty Wretches hum|bly lying at the Foot of ab&s;olute &amp; &s;overeign Grace, and looking up to CHRIST the only <HI>Mediator</HI> to reconcile them to the glorious GOD, to ju&s;tify them wholly by his own mo&s;t perfect <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> &amp; to enlighten, quicken, &s;anctify, dwell in and govern them by his ALMIGHTY SPI|RIT; and there to wait till they find a new &amp; mighty Life &amp; Power come into their Souls, enabling them to em|brace, tru&s;t in &amp; love this divine REDEEMER, rejoice with Satisfaction in Him, &amp; perform every Kind of Du|ty both to GOD &amp; <HI>Man</HI> with Plea&s;ure &amp; with quite another Frame and Spirit than before&mdash;</P>
<P>Such great and &s;udden Turns as the&s;e are as evident Demon&s;trations as we can po&s;&s;ibly conceive of the Truth of the <HI>in&s;pired Scriptures,</HI> &amp; in particular of tho&s;e Scripture <HI>Doctrines</HI> of the <HI>&s;overeign</HI> &amp; <HI>victorious Grace</HI> of CHRIST, receiv'd &amp; taught among us: We &s;ee with our Eyes, that when He rideth forth on the Word of Truth con|quering &amp; to conquer, his right Hand teaches Terrible Things, He makes his Arrows &s;o &s;harp &amp; piercing in the Hearts of his &s;toute&s;t Enemies, as oblige them to fall down under Him; and when the Day of his Power comes on any People. He makes the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate to be mo&s;t gladly willing and obedient to Him: And the&s;e <HI>Principles of Grace,</HI> &amp; the&s;e <HI>Works of</HI> GOD do mo&s;t invincibly confirm each other.</P>
<P>And tho' it mu&s;t be own'd with Sorrow that &s;ome few who &s;ee the&s;e wonderous Works continue unconvinced; yet this is no more &s;trange than that &s;ome of the mo&s;t <HI>learned</HI> and <HI>religious</HI> Men, as were the <HI>Scribes</HI> &amp; <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> who &s;aw the wondrous Works of CHRIST on Earth, yet continued
<PB REF="004992_0007_100E518A26D70DE0">unconvinced that they were the Works of GOD, yea pur|&s;u'd Him with unrelenting Enmity and Violence. How|ever, 'tis a reviving Con&s;olation to us, that as this Work &s;urprizingly goes on from Town to Town, it goes on more and more to &s;ilence the mo&s;t fierce Oppo&s;ers: Though mighty Oppo&s;itions ri&s;e at fir&s;t, it bares them down before it; and our <HI>more mighty</HI> SAVIOUR &s;eems re&s;olv'd to go on &s;till from conquering to conquer.</P>
<P>In vain do its remaining Enemies attempt to brand it with the Name&mdash;<HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI> For this is like the gentile <HI>Romans</HI> branding the <HI>Jewi&s;h Religion</HI> with the hated Name of <HI>Super&s;tition:</HI> and if <HI>this Work</HI> is truly <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> then we have been wholly mi&s;taken in the Meaning of the <HI>Word:</HI> and what they call <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> is a Glorious and Ble&s;&s;ed Work of GOD, mo&s;t powerfully &amp; &s;uddenly chang|ing the very <HI>Hearts</HI> &amp; <HI>Lives</HI> of Men; making them in a great Degree like to CHRIST in Love &amp; Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Holine&s;s &amp; Meekne&s;s &amp; Humility; filling their Hearts with holy Joy and their Mouths with Prai&s;es.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t remit the remaining Oppo&s;ers to the <HI>Law and Te&s;timony</HI> of GOD Him&s;elf in the in&s;pired Oracles; as our <HI>Rev. &amp; Dear Brother</HI> the Author of the following valuable Sermon does. And we are glad on this Occa&s;ion to join our Te&s;timony with him, both to the &s;ame <HI>Doc|trines of Grace</HI> &amp; to the <HI>wonderous Works of</HI> GOD agreable to them: as al&s;o to declare our great Satisfaction to &s;ee him &amp; others of our &s;aid <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Brethren concurring with us in them: with our Apprehen&s;ion that our <HI>uniting in the&s;e important</HI> Points, is &s;uch a powerful Band of <HI>Union in Chri&s;tian Love &amp; Fellow&s;hip</HI> as &s;hould overcome the Re|mains of every Kind of Prejudice that may yet &s;ub&s;i&s;t among our People: and our earne&s;t Wi&s;hes that with a tender &amp; meek Forbearance of each other in different Sen|timents about Church Order and Government, we may all unite in maintaining &amp; promoting the&s;e more excellent and momentous Points of <HI>Grace</HI> &amp; <HI>vital Piety.</HI></P>

<P>Beloved, believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they be of God: becau&s;e many fal&s;e Prophets are gone out into the World.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE read <HI>Rev.</HI> 12.12. That the Devil came down among the Inhabitants of the Earth having great Wrath becau&s;e he knew his Time was &s;hort. When the &s;trong Man armed keepeth his Palace, all his Goods are in Peace: every Thing is then as he would have it to be&punc; his Subjects go &s;leeping on to Hell, and imagine them&s;elves all the while in the direct Way to Heaven. But on the other Hand, when he perceives that his Policies begin to be detected, the Eyes of his Slaves to be opened to &s;ee their Mi&s;ery and their Need of the Remedy, and that by this Means his Kingdom appears to be going to Wreck; when he &s;ees the Standard of the great Me&s;&s;ias erected and the Gathering of the People about it; when he &s;ees them flock thereto as a Cloud and as the Doves to their Windows; that Men are daily de|&s;erting
<PB N="2" REF="004992_0009_100E518E6E8BBDB0">his Government by Hundreds and Thou&s;ands, and going over to Chri&s;t the great Deliverer: When (I &s;ay) he beholds Things having &s;uch an Appearance, he then thinks it is high Time for him to be&s;tir him&s;elf, and if po&s;&s;ible to &s;upport his tottering Empire. To this End he convocates the black Divan, takes Coun&s;el how he may mar God's Work mo&s;t effectually: and in Pur|&s;uance of this Coun&s;el he finds it &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to transform him&s;elf into an Angel of Light, and to &s;end forth his Mini&s;ters; who though inward they are raven|ing Wolves, yet they come in Sheeps Cloathing: and partly by helli&s;h Lies, partly by aggravating &s;ome real Indi&s;cretions, partly by fal&s;e Parallels, perverting &s;ome Texts of Scripture, and mi&s;applying others; they put &s;ome of the weaker even of God's own Children to a Stand to that Degree that they know not for &s;ome Time what to &s;ay: So that they would deceive (were it po&s;|&s;ible) the very Elect.</P>
<P>Thus it is in this glorious Day of Go&s;pel Grace. As the good Spirit appears to be &s;triving in a remarkable Manner; So Satan and his In&s;truments, we have Rea&s;on to think, are very indu&s;trious: Yea &s;o cunningly does this in&s;iduous Adver&s;ary manage, that he &s;ometimes gets good Men engaged upon his Side. We have great Rea|&s;on to fear that it is now a Time in various Places in which there is Ground for the repeating of God's Com|plaint by his Prophet <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 4.6. My People are de&s;troy|ed for lack of Knowledge; that tho&s;e who lead them cau&s;e them to err: and that by this Means God's Name continually every Day is bla&s;phemed. But ble&s;&s;ed be God, that we have our Bibles. So that if it &s;hould hap|pen at any Time that tho&s;e who&s;e Lips ought to pre&s;erve Knowledge, &s;hould them&s;elves turn a&s;ide from the Ways of God either in Doctrine or Morals; that in this Ca&s;e we are not obliged to follow them implicity, but that we have a &s;ure Word of Prophe&s;y even the <HI>Law</HI> and Te&s;timony for our Rule, and al&s;o the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> that if we
<PB N="3" REF="004992_0010_100E5190B5B52928">a&s;k the Holy Spirit we &s;hall receive him. In &s;um, we have great Rea&s;on to be thankful that our God has given us Liberty and put us in a Capacity of judging for our &s;elves. That I may therefore have an Opportunity of &s;hewing the Nece&s;&s;ity and Importance of u&s;ing this our Chri&s;tian Liberty aright in trying the Spirits whether they be of God; I have cho&s;en to &s;peak from the above Text as the Ground of the following Di&s;cour&s;e: where the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>Beloved, believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they be of God:</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It may not perhaps be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve briefly, that the Penman of <HI>this Epi&s;tle</HI> was the Evangeli&s;t and beloved Di&s;ciple <HI>John:</HI> the particular Time when he wrote it is uncertain: the Per&s;ons to whom he wrote it are &s;aid to be <HI>Jews:</HI> not tho&s;e that dwelt in <HI>Judea,</HI> but tho&s;e who lived in the Ea&s;tern Part of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> viz. in the Empire of <HI>Parthia.</HI>&mdash; The Scope of the Apo&s;tle in this Epi&s;tle is, <HI>partly</HI> to prove, that JESUS of <HI>Nazareth</HI> is the true MESSIAS; not only to induce Men &s;tedfa&s;tly to believe this great Fundamental, but to impre&s;s the Truth of it upon their Souls in a more deep, lively and practical Manner; <HI>partly</HI> to reduce the Licentious, to rai&s;e the &s;piritually Dead, and quicken all to a more &s;trict, lively and vigorous Chri&s;tianity; and <HI>partly</HI> to excite Chri&s;tians to the Duty of mutual Love, which &s;eems to have been this beloved Di&s;ciple's favourite Subject.</P>

<P N="1">I. I begin with the fir&s;t of the&s;e Heads in Order, viz. to &s;hew that there have been always fal&s;e Prophets or Teachers in the World, who have pretended to In&s;pira|tion or divine Revelation. &mdash; That this is a Truth any Per&s;on who is acquainted with &s;acred and profane Hi&s;tory will readily grant. If we look into <HI>&s;acred Hi&s;tory</HI> during the <HI>Old-Te&s;tament</HI> Period we &s;hall find a Multitude of the Devil's Mini&s;ters, all pretending to divine In&s;piration. I might &s;hew a great many particular In&s;tances. We have God warning his People, <HI>Deut.</HI> 13.12. of fal&s;e Teachers who &s;hould endeavour cunningly to draw them a&s;ide from the Wor&s;hip of the true God to that of Idols. Thus we read 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.8. that there was a <HI>Jannes</HI> and a <HI>Jambres</HI> in the Court of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> who with&s;tood <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and who by Sorcery and the Help of the Devil thought to do as great Miracles as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> did by the infinite Power of God. &mdash; And thus <HI>Balaam,</HI> notwith&s;tanding his high Pretences to divine Revelation and al&s;o to the mo&s;t inflexible Integrity; yet was one who dealt with the Devil in helli&s;h Spells and Inchantments, and al&s;o a Per|&s;on then if we come down to the Days of <HI>Eli&s;ha,</HI> we find the Prophets of <HI>Baall</HI> were very numerous, and al&s;o ex|ceeding zealous in their Way, in &s;o much that they leaped upon the Alter and cut them&s;elves with Knives and Lancers till the Blood gu&s;hed out.&mdash; And thus we read that there was a <HI>Zedekiah</HI> to oppo&s;e <HI>Micaiah</HI> the true
<PB N="6" REF="004992_0013_100E5198095C6878">Prophet of the Lord, and to per&s;uade <HI>Ahab</HI> to go to <HI>Ra|moth Gilead</HI> to his own Ruin. &mdash; Thus there were lying Prophets, in the Days of <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> who per&s;uaded <HI>Zede|kiah</HI> and his People that <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> &s;hould not fall into the Hands of the <HI>Chaldeans;</HI> and by this Means led that poor unhappy Prince and his People to their Ruin, by hindring them to make that &s;ea&s;onable Capitulation which might have prevented it.</P>
<P>And then if we turn our Eye from the &s;acred Hi&s;tory of the Old-Te&s;tament to the <HI>prophane Hi&s;tories</HI> that are co-incident with and after that Period, we &s;hall find in|numerable Cheats and Impo&s;tors of this Sort. He mu&s;t needs be a Stranger to or at lea&s;t &s;uperficially acquainted with the <HI>Grecians,</HI> the <HI>Romans</HI> and other Pagan Hi&s;tories, who has not heard of the famous <HI>Sibylline Oracles,</HI> of the Oracle of <HI>Apollo</HI> at <HI>Delphos,</HI> that of <HI>Diana</HI> at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> as likewi&s;e that of <HI>Jupiter Hamon</HI> in <HI>Libia,</HI> with many others: the re&s;pective Prie&s;ts of which all pretended to be in&s;pired by their Gods when they gave forth the ora|cular An&s;wers:&mdash;Who has not heard of the two famous Impo&s;tors viz. <HI>Zoroa&s;tres</HI> in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Mahomet</HI> in <HI>Arabia.</HI></P>
<P>And then if we take a View of the <HI>New-Te&s;tament</HI> Period, and the Time that has &s;ince en&s;ued, we &s;hall find that no &s;ooner did the Light of the Go&s;pel &s;hine out and the glorious Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s irradiate the World with his illuminating and chearing Beams, but the Prince of Darkne&s;s endeavoured to ob&s;cure it.&mdash;Were there not tho&s;e even in the Days of the Apo&s;tles who err'd in the great Doctrine of Ju&s;tification, who were for mixing the Deeds of the Law along with Faith, and who taught that we are ju&s;tified partly by Faith and partly by Works? who&s;e pernicious Tenets the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> re|futes in a &s;olid and elaborate Manner in his Epi&s;tles to the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Galatians.</HI> &mdash; Were there not tho&s;e who quarrel'd with and impugn'd the high and &s;overeign Doc|trine of Prede&s;tination, who&s;e Cavils the Apo&s;tle an&s;wers
<PB N="7" REF="004992_0014_100E51998F8192F0">in the ninth Chapter to the <HI>Romans.</HI> Thus the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> tells us of unlearned and un&s;table men who wre&s;t|ed Scriptures to their own De&s;truction. Do we not read of ungodly Men who turned the Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t into La&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s; who under Pretence of exalt|ing free Grace, unloos'd the Reins on the Neck of their impetuous Lu&s;ts &s;aying, <HI>Let us continue in Sin that Grace may abound?</HI> Were there not an <HI>Himeneus</HI> and <HI>Philetes,</HI> who denied the Re&s;urrection, and overthrew the Faith? Was there not an <HI>Ebion</HI> who denied the Divinity of Chri&s;t, and who taught the Obligation of the ceremonial Law under the Go&s;pel? A <HI>Cerinthus</HI> who taught that Chri&s;t &s;hould at his Coming give to his People all carnal or &s;en|&s;ual Delights, and who denied the whole Scripture, <HI>Mat|thew</HI>'s Go&s;pel excepted:&mdash; What vile Principles did the <HI>Gno&s;ticks</HI> hold? What abominable Practices were they guilty of? and yet what high Pretences to Revelation did they make?</P>
<P>If we come further down and look into the Legends of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> how many rediculous Stories, how many counterfeit Miracles, &amp; lying Wonders have we there? And then if we de&s;cend &s;till further down and come to the Time of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> we &s;hall find that no &s;ooner did that ble&s;&s;ed Day of Go&s;pel Light break forth upon the World, but the Devil endeavoured to ob&s;cure it. How many extravagant Sects, how many heretical Opi|nions &s;hew'd them&s;elves in the Days of the true Refor|mers? the re&s;pective Patrons of which all pretended to be zealous Prote&s;tants, and to make a loud Cry again&s;t the Church of <HI>Rome?</HI> He who will be at Pains to read the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>German</HI> Anabapti&s;ts, the gro&s;s Errors and rediculous Extravagancies they run into; as al&s;o that of &s;ome of the Sectaries in <HI>South-Britain</HI> in the la&s;t Century; as likewi&s;e the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of the &s;ubtile Error of <HI>Arminius;</HI> cannot but grant the Point.</P>
<P>Thus from what has been briefly &s;aid upon this Head, it plainly appears that there have been always fal&s;e Tea|chers
<PB N="8" REF="004992_0015_100E519BCB876698">in the World who have pretended to In&s;piration, as far as we have any Hi&s;tory to inform us. And it is very probable it will be &s;o as long as the Devil has a Kingdom in the World.&mdash; But what I pray do the Adver&s;aries of the pre&s;ent religious Commotion gain by the proving of this Point, except they can likewi&s;e prove that the Pro|moters of the pre&s;ent Work hold the &s;ame pernicious Principles, or as bad as tho&s;e ancient Hereticks did; or that they are guilty of the &s;ame wicked Practices that tho&s;e were? Does it indeed follow as a ju&s;t Con&s;equence that becau&s;e <HI>Arius, Socinus, Pelagius, Arminius,</HI> &amp;c. were Hereticks and falfe Teachers; that therefore Me&s;&s;ieurs the <HI>Er&s;kines</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> and their Adherents there, Me&s;&s;ieurs the <HI>Tennents</HI> in <HI>Pen&s;ylvania</HI> and their Adherents there, Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> and Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> in the Church of <HI>England</HI> and their Adherents there, are al&s;o Hereticks and fal&s;e Teachers; e&s;pecially con&s;idering that they oppo&s;e tho&s;e ancient Hereticks, and in oppo&s;i|tion to them do maintain the Doctrines of the 39 Arti|cles of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and tho&s;e of the <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter</HI> Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith? He who can make a ju&s;t Con&s;equence of this, may reconcile Light and Dark|ne&s;s, and prove that bitter &amp; &s;weet are the &s;ame Things.</P>
<P N="2">II. I proceed to the &s;econd Thing, viz. to &s;hew that God has been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to give his Church a compleat and invariable Rule, by which they may di|&s;tingui&s;h between the Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Error. I need not dwell long on this Head. 'Tis only nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve briefly, that the HOLY SCRIP|TURES contained in the &s;everal Books of the Old and New-Te&s;tament is this Rule. I pre&s;ume you all hold at lea&s;t by Profe&s;&s;ion; that the Scripture is the Word <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> God, and con&s;equently the great Rule of Faith and practice. I &s;hall not therefore at pre&s;ent &s;tay upon the proof of that which is granted upon all Hands. And he who grants this. viz. that the Scripture is the only
<PB N="9" REF="004992_0016_100E519DB63E6210">Rule, will be obliged to admit of particular Texts taken out of Scripture to prove that it is a complete Rule. And of the&s;e there are Abundance: &s;ee P&s;al. 19.8. <HI>The Law of the Lord is perfect converting the Soul,</HI> &amp;c. Thus, Mic. 6.8. <HI>He hath &s;hewed thee, O Man what is good,</HI> &amp;c. To the &s;ame Purpo&s;e is 2 Tim. 3.16. <HI>All Scripture is given by In&s;piration of God; and is profit|able for Doctrine for Reproof, for Correction, and In|&s;truction in Righteou&s;ne&s;s; that the Man of God may be perfect,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash; And it is a Mercy for which we cannot be too thankful, that we have this Rule, and are not obliged to receive as Doctrines the Commandments of Men: Who had they the leading of our Judgments and Con&s;ciences, would &s;oon (we have Rea&s;on to fear) bring us to burle&s;que all &s;erious Godline&s;s, and to ridicule the Operations of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit under the Notion of Enthu&s;ia&s;m and fanciful Delu&s;ions.</P>
<P>When I &s;ay the Scripture is a compleat Rule, and that God has thereby put his People into a Capacity to di&s;tingui&s;h between the Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Error; I would by no Means be under&s;tood to exclude the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Spirit's Teachings. CHRIST, as a Prophet, teaches by <HI>his</HI> SPIRIT, as well as by <HI>his Word:</HI> yea and the Teaching of the SPIRIT is ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary in Order to the &s;aving and practical Under&s;tanding of the <HI>Word.</HI> A Per&s;on indeed may po&s;&s;ibly attain a &s;ound and right doctrinal Knowledge without the <HI>Spirit,</HI> &s;o as to approve of the Things that are excellent, being in&s;tructed out of the Law, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.18. and by this Means may be &s;o far Judge of Doctrine, as to try the Spirits aright. But a <HI>&s;aving practical Knowledge</HI> he can|not attain without the Teaching of the <HI>Spirit:</HI> nor does this any Way derogate from the Compleatne&s;s and Per|fection of the <HI>Rule:</HI> 'tis not owing to any Defect in the Sun, that a blind Eye cannot &s;ee the Light.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="10" REF="004992_0017_100E51A02ED0DD00">
III. I pa&s;s to the Third Thing in the Method; viz. to &s;hew that 'tis highly nece&s;&s;ary that Chri&s;tians make good U&s;e of the Rule that God has given them, in trying the Spirits and judging for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>That this is a Truth, is plain from the Words of my Text: <HI>Try the Spirits,</HI> &amp;c. To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> purpo&s;e we have the Injunction 1 The&s;&s;. 5.21. <HI>Prove all Things, hold fa&s;t that which is good.</HI> Thus Phil. 1.9, 10. The Apo&s;tle prays on the Behalf of that Church, that their <HI>Love may grow more and more in Knowledge and in all Judgment, that they may approve the Things that are ex|cellent.</HI> And thus Heb. 5.13, 14. The Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of grown or experienced Chri&s;tians, who he &s;ays have their Sen&s;es exerci&s;ed to di&s;cern both Good and Evil. The Apo&s;tle de&s;ires the <HI>Corinthians</HI> to be Followers of <HI>him</HI> no further than he was of CHRIST, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.1. which plainly &s;hews that they has a Right to try him, and his Doctrines, by the Rule. Thus we have the <HI>Be|reans</HI> commended, and the Epithet of <HI>Noble</HI> given them, for their a&s;&s;iduous Care in <HI>&s;earching the Scripture to &s;ee if the Things &s;poken even by the Apo&s;tles were &s;o.</HI> Acts 17.11. And it is &s;poken to the ju&s;t Prai&s;e of the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> Rev. 2.2. That &s;he had <HI>tried tho&s;e who &s;aid they were Apo&s;tles, and had found them to be Liars.</HI> With which agrees our Lord's Injunction to the Di&s;|ciples, Joh. 5.39. <HI>Search the Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>In Sum, God has graciou&s;ly allowed Chri&s;tians, as a Part of their Chri&s;tian Liberty, a Judgment of Di&s;creti|on: And this it is their Duty to hold fa&s;t, making good U&s;e of the Powers that God has endowed them withal as rea&s;onable Creatures, in trying the Spirits by the <HI>Rule of God's Word:</HI> bringing all private Spirits and all particular Doctrines to this great infallible Standard, this Platform of Faith and Manners; as they agree or di&s;a|gree with it, receiving or rejecting them. I&s;a. 8.20. <HI>To the Law and to the Te&s;timony; if they &s;peak not according to this Word, it is becau&s;e there is no Light in them.</HI></P>

IV. I come now to the fourth and la&s;t Thing propo|&s;ed in the doctrinal Part, which was to <HI>try the Spirits</HI> which have been the in&s;trumental Cau&s;e of that religious Commotion in various Parts of this Continent and el&s;e|where, to &s;ee if they be of God.&mdash;As this (in the pre|&s;ent Conjuncture) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> the mo&s;t material Head, I &s;hall en|deavour to be &s;omewhat larger upon it: And that I may proceed the more di&s;tinctly I &s;hall e&s;&s;ay to try (1.) the Spirit of the <HI>Promoters,</HI> (2.) of the <HI>Oppo&s;ers</HI> of the pre&s;ent Work: and then let every one judge for him&s;elf and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> which appears to be mo&s;t of God. But ere I proceed I would beg Leave to premi&s;e a few Things;
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. I premi&s;e that it is very unju&s;t to charge any Party in general with the erroneous Opinions or imprudent Conduct of one or more particular Per&s;ons who have declar'd them&s;elves to be of the Party: E&s;pecially if &s;aid Party be &s;o far from approving of or countenancing &s;aid Opinions and Conduct, that they declare again&s;t them, and take due Care as far as Circum&s;tances will al|low, to deal with the Per&s;on or Per&s;ons in Order to his or their Reformation.&mdash;As for Example, I appeal to the unprejudiced; Would it have been ju&s;t to have charged <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> in general with the Errors of <HI>Ebion</HI> and <HI>Cerinthus,</HI> the <HI>Gno&s;ticks,</HI> or any other of the ancient He|reticks? To have charged the <HI>Reformation</HI> with the Errors &amp; ridiculous Extravagances of the <HI>German-Ana|bapti&s;ts?</HI> Or the <HI>Church of England</HI> with tho&s;e of <HI>Wi&s;ton?</HI> Would it have been ju&s;t in a common Enemy of Chri|&s;tianity to charge <HI>Paul</HI> with the Di&s;&s;imulation of <HI>Peter,</HI> when he with&s;tood him to the Face in that wherein he was to be blamed? And in like Manner would it be ju&s;t to charge Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> with the Errors of Mr. <HI>We&s;ley?</HI> Thus in Ca&s;e any of the profe&s;s'd Promoters of the pre&s;ent Work in the Land &s;hould run into any Errors, or be guilty of any extravagant Conduct; would it be ju&s;t to make this a Matter of Reproach to the whole Work?</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="12" REF="004992_0019_100E51A4AFE36E10">
2. I would premi&s;e that if a Mini&s;ter or a private Chri&s;tian &s;hould drop a Expre&s;&s;ion which not being &s;o well cautioned as it ought to be, is by rea&s;on of its Am|biguity capable of being explained in an un&s;ound Sen&s;e: that even in this Ca&s;e it is mo&s;t unju&s;t and uncharitable to explain it in &s;uch a Sen&s;e: granting we have &s;ufficient Means of knowing that this Sen&s;e is contrary to the Per|&s;on's &s;ettled Opinion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. I would premi&s;e that granting we know that a Per&s;on has readily been in an Error in Judgment for &s;ome Time; yet if we know that he has retracted &s;aid Error, 'tis mo&s;t di&s;ingenuous to &s;peak of him as if he &s;till retained it, and to endeavour to make the World believe that it is &s;till his Opinion. As for In&s;tance, would it not have been highly injurious to have charged <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> with any of this former Errors after he had written his Book of Retractions?</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The&s;e few Particulars being premi&s;ed which I think cannot but be granted; I proceed as I propo&s;ed to try the Spirits.</P>
<P N="1">[I.] Of the <HI>Promoters</HI> of this pre&s;ent Work. And in the doing of this I &s;hall e&s;&s;ay to try them.

<ITEM>(1.) With Re&s;pect to their <HI>Doctrine.</HI></ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. I &s;hall e&s;&s;ay to try them with Re&s;pect to their <HI>Doctrine.</HI> This is one excellent Mark by which Chri|&s;tians may di&s;tingui&s;h between true and fal&s;e Teachers: and therefore we have it pre&s;cribed as a Rule by which we may di&s;cern between the Spirit of CHRIST and the Spirit of <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> in the Context. Let a Per&s;on be &s;eemingly never &s;o &s;ober &amp; blamele&s;s in his Walk, let him make never &s;o high Pretences to In&s;piration or divine Re|velation; yet if he bring any Doctrine contrary to Godli|ne&s;s, or which is &s;ubver&s;ive of the genuine Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, we are not to believe that the Spirit by which
<PB N="13" REF="004992_0020_100E51A6A9F8A4E8">he is acted is of God. Yea altho' he &s;hould &s;hew a Sign or a Wonder, &amp; they &s;hould come to pa&s;s; yet ought we not to believe him: becau&s;e thereby the Lord our God doth try us, <HI>Deut.</HI> 13.1, 2, 3. We are not &s;o much as to receive him into our Hou&s;es, neither to bid him <HI>God Speed:</HI> But though he appeared like an Angel, we are to hold him accur&s;ed, 2 John 10. ver. Gal. 1.8.&mdash; Now the <HI>Doctrines</HI> which the <HI>Promoters</HI> of this Work teach, are the Doctrines of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> the Doctrines of the <HI>Apo&s;tle's Creed,</HI> of the 39 <HI>Articles of the Church of England,</HI> and of the <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Con&s;e&s;&s;ion of Faith.</HI> To the&s;e they often appeal for the Truth of what they preach. &mdash; More particularly the&s;e Men are careful to teach and inculcate the great Doctrine of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to <HI>Pelagius, Arminius,</HI> and their re&s;pective Followers. That this Sin has actually de&s;cended from <HI>Adam,</HI> the natural and federal Head, to all his Po&s;terity proceeding from him by ordinary Generation; that hereby the Under&s;tanding is darkened, the Will depraved, and the Affections under the Influence of a wrong Bia&s;s, to that Degree that they are utterly indi&s;po&s;ed to any Thing that is &s;piritually good; that Man, as a &s;ad Con|&s;equence of the Fall, had lo&s;t all Power in Things &s;piri|tual. This Doctrine they in&s;i&s;t upon, in Order to hum|ble the Pride of Man, to drive him out of him&s;elf, and convince him of his own Emptine&s;s?&mdash;They teach like|wi&s;e with due Care the Doctrine of the <HI>Imputation of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the</HI> &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> viz. JESUS CHRIST, God equal and of the &s;ame Sub&s;tance with the Father, in Order to atone for the Guilt and Clean&s;e from the Pollution of that Sin de&s;cended upon fallen Man from the fir&s;t <HI>Adam;</HI> that he mu&s;t be made to Sinners Wi&s;|dom, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Sanctification, and Redemption; and that he is the Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Jer. 23.6. As al&s;o that this Righteou&s;ne&s;s is apprehended and ap|plied by <HI>Faith</HI> alone, without the Deeds of the Law; that all Works are and con&s;equently all boa&s;ting is ex|cluded;
<PB N="14" REF="004992_0021_100E51A9ACAB8430">that though Works have no Part in our Ju&s;tification, yet the Faith which ju&s;tifies the Soul is live|ly and operative; that which ju&s;tifies it &s;elf in the Sight of the World by Works, which purifies the Soul from the Pollution of Sin, and influences the Per&s;on who has it to bring forth the Fruits of new Obedience. They teach likewi&s;e that this <HI>Faith is the Gift of God;</HI> that a Man cannot believe by any inherent Power of his own; and that yet notwith&s;tanding Faith being our Act and a commanded Duty, we are to endeavour to believe; and with a due Sen&s;e of our own In&s;ufficiency and a humble Dependance upon GOD for Strength, we are to &s;trive to exert the vital Act.&mdash; As to <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> or <HI>Regenera|tion,</HI> they hold this to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; that the Tree mu&s;t be made good, before the Fruit be &s;o; that except a Man undergo a &s;upernatural Change by the Ope|ration of the Holy Gho&s;t upon his Soul, or be born of Water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the King|dom of God. And in as much as they find that Man in his natural State is full of Self-Conceit, that in his own Opinion he is rich and increa&s;ed in Goods and &s;tands in need of Nothing, or as <HI>Job</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, That vain Man would be wi&s;e, though he be born like the wild A&s;&s;es Cold; they therefore in their Preaching make U&s;e of the <HI>Terrors of the Law:</HI> they u&s;e the Law, as God has ap|pointed it to be u&s;ed, viz. in a Sub&s;erviency to the Go&s;pel, or as a Schoolma&s;ter to bring Men to Chri&s;t, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.24. But to &s;ay that the Law is the only Topick on which they con&s;tantly in&s;i&s;t, endeavouring to work on the lower Pa&s;&s;ions, and to drive Men with &s;lavi&s;h Fear like brute Creatures, is fal&s;e and &s;landerous. They preach al&s;o the <HI>Con&s;olations of the Go&s;pel,</HI> the intrin&s;ick Beauty of Holi|ne&s;s, and the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of Chri&s;t's Service.&mdash;As to THE SPIRIT, I never heard that the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Promoters of this Work pretended to the extraordinary Gifts thereof that were peculiar to the apo&s;tolick Age. I believe I might venture to challenge their Adver&s;aries
<PB N="15" REF="004992_0022_100E51ED8E57A950">to &s;hew that they pretend to the Spirit in any other Sen&s;e, than in his convincing, enlightning, directing and comforting Influences. And in the&s;e Re&s;pects the Spirit is the Priviledge of all true Believers. If any Man have not the Spirit of Chri&s;t, thus, he is none of his <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.10.&mdash; As to <HI>civil Government,</HI> they are exceeding loyal, they put Men in Mind to be &s;ubject to Principalities and Powers; to render to all their Dues, Tribute to whom Tribute is due, Honour to whom Honour, and Fear to whom Fear; to render to <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> the Things that are <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s; and to pray for Kings, and all in Authority, that we may live quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godli|ne&s;s and Hone&s;ty. With Re&s;pect to the <HI>Government</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> they hold that CHRIST is the &s;ole Head and King of the Church; that the Government is upon his Shoulders; that he is King of Kings and Lord of Lords; that in Order to the Management of the Affairs of his Hou&s;e, He has &s;et Officers in the &s;ame; that he has ve&s;ted the&s;e, not with a legi&s;|lative Power, or a Power to make new Laws and impo&s;e them upon his free Subjects, but only with an executive Power, or a Power to put in Execution tho&s;e Laws which he has already made.

<P>I am aware it may be &s;aid by &s;ome; but why do the&s;e Men in&s;i&s;t &s;o much upon <HI>Original Sin,</HI> upon the <HI>New-Birth,</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tification by Faith alone?</HI> Are there not other Doctrines to be preached as well as the&s;e? and is it not the Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ter to declare the whole Coun&s;el of God?

</LIST>
Is it not high Time for all who are faithful to CHRIST'S Cau&s;e, to appear for and inculcate the&s;e Doctrines, when CHRIST is thus wounded in the Hou&s;e of his profe&s;&s;ed Friends? When the very Foundations of our Religion are &s;haken, and the di&s;tingui&s;hing Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity are explain'd away? For this I may venture to &s;ay; that <HI>Arminiani&s;m</HI> tends to <HI>Dei&s;m,</HI> and <HI>Dei&s;m</HI> &s;uperceeds the Chri&s;tian Scheme: no need of CHRIST to do that which we are &s;uppo&s;ed to have Power to do our &s;elves: <HI>If Righteou&s;ne&s;s come by the Law, then</HI> CHRIST <HI>is dead in vain.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Let us try them with Re&s;pect to their <HI>Manner of Life.</HI> And can it be denied that this has been very em|emplary and heavenly? I grant indeed, that this of it &s;elf is no Proof of their being &s;ent of God, if their <HI>Doc|trines</HI> were fal&s;e. The Character of <HI>Socinus</HI> was wi&s;e, grave, religious, &amp;c. But when Purity of <HI>Doctrine &amp; Life</HI> go together; both united make a very &s;trong Evidence. Now the mo&s;t famous and &s;ucce&s;sful of them do evidently appear to have much of their Conver&s;ation in Heaven, to have got a great Degree of Knowledge of their own Hearts. What a &s;weet forgiving Spirit do they &s;hew to their mo&s;t virulent and bitter Enemies? What <HI>Lambs</HI>

<P N="3">3. Let us try them with Re&s;pect to their <HI>abundant Labours.</HI> And have not &s;everal of them been eminent Followers of CHRIST? In this Particular how zealous are they about their Ma&s;ter's Bu&s;ine&s;s? How are the&s;e Angels or Me&s;&s;engers of God cau&s;ed to fly &s;wiftly in publi&s;hing the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel to them that dwell upon the Earth? What prodigious Fatigue of Body and Mind do they expo&s;e them&s;elves to, out of a tender Love to Souls? And how wonderfully are they &s;upported in all their Toil? The&s;e Things are &s;o remarkable with Re&s;pect to Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> in particular, that the great and pious Doctor <HI>Watts</HI> of <HI>London</HI> &s;peaking of him in a Letter to his Corre&s;pondent here, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus; <Q>I mu&s;t &s;ay it &s;eems to me as though &s;ome divine Power attended him to &s;upport him under &s;uch endle&s;s Fa|tigues.</Q> In a World, I think the&s;e Men may very con&s;i&s;tent with Mode&s;ty and Truth appeal to the Chur|ches where they have been, and &s;ay with the Apo&s;tle 2 Tim 3.10. <HI>But thou ha&s;t fully known my Doctrine, Manner of Life, Purpo&s;e, Faith, Long-Suffering, Charity, Patience.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Let us next try them with Re&s;pect to the <HI>Effects</HI> that <HI>their Labours</HI> have produced, and can any have the Front to deny that the&s;e have been good?

</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. Let us try them with Re&s;pect to their <HI>Doctrine.</HI> And it will be found upon Examination that &s;ome of the mo&s;t violent Oppo&s;ers are Men of <HI>Arminian, Pelagian,</HI> and <HI>Dei&s;tical</HI> Principles. This is too evident to be deni|ed: Several of them being &s;uch as &s;coff at the Imputa|tion of Original Sin, who deny the Doctrine of Ju&s;tifi|cation by Faith alone, as likewi&s;e the high Doctrine of Prede&s;tination: And who do &s;trongly a&s;&s;ert Man's natural Powers in Things &s;piritual. I fore&s;ee indeed that it may be &s;aid that all who oppo&s;e the pre&s;ent Work are not Men of &s;uch Principles, granting &s;ome be. I an|&s;wer, I charitably hope they are not: But I &s;hould rejoice that they would give le&s;s Rea&s;on, to &s;u&s;pect them of verging that Way.&mdash;Is it not a Truth too plain to be denied, that there has been of late a great Growth of the &s;ubtile Error of <HI>Arminius</HI> in the prote&s;tant World? And I wi&s;h I could &s;ay that our Side of the <HI>Atlantick</HI> were free of it. Why then are they not more careful to preach again&s;t it, to tell their People of the Danger of it, to &s;hew them that it is de&s;tructive to true Chri|&s;tianity. &mdash; In a Word, when they appear as zealous again&s;t it, and make as loud a Cry concerning the Danger of it, as they do again&s;t the <HI>New Schemers</HI> as they affect to term them: We &s;hall then have more Room for Charity towards them in this Regard.</P>
<P>After all, I do charitably believe that there are &s;ome weaker Brethren, both of Mini&s;ters and People, who are led in to oppo&s;e this Work, and yet are no Arminians; but are &s;ound in the Doctrines of Prede&s;tination, &s;uper|natural Grace, and Ju&s;tification by Faith alone: But in the mean Time, I believe that the <HI>principal</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t inveterate Oppo&s;ers</HI> are Men of <HI>Arminian</HI> and <HI>Pelagian</HI> Principles, and that the&s;e others are only Deputy of &s;e|cond Hand Oppo&s;ers.

<P>I come next to try them with Re&s;pect to the <HI>Spirit or Temper</HI> with which whey oppo&s;e the pre&s;ent Work. I &s;hall &s;hew of few of the <HI>Properties</HI> of <HI>this Spirit,</HI> which in an obvious Manner do di&s;cover them&s;elves in the Op|po&s;ers. As</P>

I would not &s;ay that all who oppo&s;e the pre&s;ent Work are wilful Liars becau&s;e I would be as charitable as po&s;&s;ible: but this &s;eems to be the Ca&s;e; viz. &s;ome hatch the Lies, and others labouring under the malignant Influence of a prejudiced Mind do too ea&s;ily believe them and report them for Truths. How el&s;e I pray comes it to pa&s;s that &s;o many horrid Lies are forged?&mdash; Has not Mr. <HI>White|field</HI> been repre&s;ented as a ba&s;e, mercenary, covetous Man, one who goes about gathering Money to make an E&s;tate for him&s;elf? &mdash; Have not both he and Me&s;&s;ieurs the <HI>Er&s;kine</HI>'s in <HI>Scotland</HI> been repre&s;ented as Per&s;ons in Confederacy with the People to the cur&s;ed Errors of the Church of <HI>Rome?</HI> Have not &s;everal of their Doctrines been gro&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented, as any Per&s;on may &s;ee who will read with Candour what they have written in their own Defence?

<P N="2">2.

To &s;ay it is nothing but Phanatici&s;m and En|thu&s;ia&s;m? That it is like a Bubble upon the Water which will quickly be gone? That the Men who pro|mote it are wandering Stars, or blazing Comets, or like raging Waves of the Sea foaming out their own Shame? Are the&s;e the Gentlemen of &s;uch exten&s;ive Charity!

Is not the Harve&s;t plenty? Are not the Labourers few? Is there not Work enough for all in the &s;pacious Vineyard of Chri&s;t? Why need they then &s;tand quarreling with one another; when there is &s;o much planting, watering, pruning and cultivating to be done?</P>
<P N="4">4. As it is an envious &s;o it is a <HI>partial Spirit.</HI> The Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> gives it as one of the Properties of the <HI>Wi&s;dom that cometh from above,</HI> that it is <HI>without Partia|lity.</HI> &mdash; There is no Perfection in this corrupt &s;inful State.

So that if all the Defects of any Author, all the Blemi&s;hes of any Per&s;on, all the Imprudencies in the Management of any Cau&s;e be indu&s;triou&s;ly gathered together and magnified, and in the mean Time no Mention made of that which is commendable in them; in will make the be&s;t Per&s;on or Cau&s;e in the World look with a dark and gloomy A&s;pect. As for In&s;tance look into the Life of <HI>David</HI> the Man after God's own Heart: Gather all the Blemi&s;hes thereof together, his Lying, his vain Glory, his Cruelty, his Murder, his Adultery; and in the mean Time, &s;uffer Partiality to draw a Vail over the bright Part of his Character, which &s;hall conceal what&s;oever was excellent in him: And this Picture of him &s;o drawn, &s;hall be &s;o far from amia|ble, that it will look mon&s;terous and deformed.</P>
<P>Now I appeal to Facts, whither this be not the prac|tice of many of the Oppo&s;ers of the pre&s;ent Work? They con&s;tantly pore upon the dark Side of it: what|ever they can hear of that, they imagine will ca&s;t a Slur upon it; they greedily lay hold of, and magnify with all their Art and Eloquence. If a Friend of the Work be imprudent, or unguarded in any Part of his Conduct; this &s;hall be indu&s;triou&s;ly improv'd, but not a Word &s;aid of what is commendable in him. If he drop an Expre&s;&s;ion that is &s;omewhat ambiguous, they will be &s;ure to interpret it in the wor&s;t Sen&s;e: Nor do they &s;top here, but give out that this is the Opinion of the whole Party.&mdash;I appeal to the unprejudiced, whither this be candid, impartial Treatment?</P>

<P>FIRST to all <HI>in general;</HI> I would &s;ay my dear Bre|thren; take the whole&s;ome Advice of the Apo&s;tle in my Text; i. e. not to believe every Spirit; but try the Spirits whether they be of God. Do not implicity pin your Faith upon any Man's Sleeve: Be Followers of no Man farther then he is of Chri&s;t.&mdash;To what end has God made you rea&s;onable Creatures, and given you the Bible in your Mother Tongue, but that you &s;hould judge for your &s;elves? Make U&s;e therefore of your Chri&s;tian Liberty: Bring Per&s;ons, their Doctrines, their Spirit, and their Practices, to <HI>the Law</HI> and to
<PB N="26" REF="004992_0033_100E52050506A6D0"><HI>the Te&s;timony:</HI> And as they agree or di&s;agree herewith, receive or reject them.&mdash;Be exceeding careful that Party Prejudice don't bia&s;s your Judgment. This is exceeding dangerous; e&s;pecially when it is in Soul Affairs. O then let me plead with you to be faithful to your preci|ous Souls: Lay a&s;ide all Prejudice of every Kind, whether religious, national, congregational, dome&s;tick, or per&s;onal: Hang out the Balance fairly, and let the Word of God be Judge. &mdash; Be importunate with God, that he would give you a right Sight of your &s;elves, that he would &s;hew your Soul's State whatever it be, whether good or bad: You'l never be able to try the Spirits of others &s;o well, until you have tried your own Spirits. Alas, how many are forward in judging others, who know not what Spirit them&s;elves are of? Pull the <HI>Beam</HI> out of your own Eye, and then you'l &s;ee the better to pull the <HI>Mote</HI> out of your Brothers.&mdash;</P>
<P>But</P>
<P>SECONDLY, I would be more <HI>particular</HI> in applying my&s;elf to &s;everal Sorts of Per&s;ons, according to their dif|ferent Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>And 1. To you who are <HI>full of &s;trong Prejudices again&s;t this Work;</HI> in&s;omuch that you are inclinable to think that it is all Delu&s;ion, and the Work of the De|vil. I would a&s;k you; were not &s;ome of you very warm in Favour of is within the&s;e twelve Months? What is the Rea&s;on of your &s;udden Change? Have you di&s;|covered that the Promoters of this Work have vented any fal&s;e Doctrine, or been guilty of any wicked Practice &s;ince that Time? I would a&s;k you farther; have you not at &s;ome Times a he&s;itating or doubting in your Minds about this Work? Granting you be not fully &s;atisfied that it is of God, yet certainly you cannot &s;ay you are &s;ure that it is not of God: Don't you feel &s;omewhat within you &s;aying at Times, po&s;&s;ibly I am mi&s;taken, perhaps this Work is from Heaven? &mdash; Is this the Ca&s;e with &s;ome of you, then I would entreat you not to &s;hew your &s;elves virulent Oppo&s;ers of it. See
<PB N="27" REF="004992_0034_100E520690D8A710">that you make not Conver&s;ion-Work the Subject of your common Drollery and Diver&s;ion: Have a Care of talking lightly concerning Tears and Sorrow for Sin. Con&s;ider that if the Work be of God, as you do not know but it is,; then by this Sort of Conduct you'l be found fighting again&s;t God, and grieving the ble&s;&s;ed Spi|rit. Be not Mockers then, lea&s;t your Bands be made &s;trong, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 28.22. &mdash; I appeal to your Con&s;ciences; have any of you already been guilty of this Sort of Conduct, yet de&s;pair not: There is Hope in I&s;rael concerning you: You will with <HI>Saul</HI> the Per&s;ecutor obtain Mercy, becau&s;e you did it ignorantly and in Unbe|lief. But if Con&s;cience duly informed tells you that it is God's Work, and yet you do wilfully and maliciou&s;ly go on to ridicule and oppo&s;e it; a&s;&s;ure your &s;elves that this is a doing de&s;pite to the Spirit of Grace: This is &s;inning again&s;t the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t?</HI> 'Tis an audacious &s;hoot|ing of the Arrows of your Scorn directly again&s;t the Throne of the great and dreadful God! O then be ex|horted to &s;top in Time: Trembled to think what you are doing: Beg that God would keep you back from pre&s;umptuous Sin. &mdash; Take Care, if you be in Doubt a|bout the Work, to have Con&s;cience duly informed: Try both Sides, and then you'l be the more capable to form an impartial Judgment: Prove all Things, and hold fa&s;t that which is good; I <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> 5.21.&mdash;My dear Brethren, what &s;hould make any of you to doubt con|cerning the Work's being of God? Will you but judge of the <HI>Tree</HI> by it's <HI>Fruit?</HI> Is it the Work of the Devil to make Men who were at Ea&s;e in Zion careful about their Souls? To &s;et them about &s;ecret Prayer, Self-Ex|amination, and Chri&s;tian Conference? To wean their Affections from the World, and to &s;et their De&s;ires more upon Heaven? To give them a Sight of the Vilene&s;s of their own Hearts, and thereby to humble their natu|ral Pride? To make Sin appear exceeding &s;inful, and Chri&s;t exceeding precious in their Eyes? Is it
<PB N="28" REF="004992_0035_100E5208D7E8A6B8">the Devil's Work to make Swearers, Whorers, Drun|kards, Liars, Sabbath-breakers, Scoffers at Religion, to leave off their re&s;pective Vices?&mdash; Let me intreat you to weigh the&s;e Particulars with that Care which an Af|fair of the la&s;t Con&s;equence de&s;erves, What Intere&s;t do you imagine I can propo&s;e to my&s;elf in u&s;ing this Free|dom with you, but a tender Concern for your Souls? I am looking for nothing from you, I propo&s;e no tem|poral Gain by you: O then if you do not regard me, regard your own precious Souls.</P>
<P>But then I would next apply my &s;elf to you who are profe&s;&s;ed <HI>Favourites</HI> of the pre&s;ent Work. And of you I imagine there are two Sorts, i. e. <HI>gracele&s;s</HI> and <HI>gracious</HI> Per&s;ons. A Word to each of You.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) You who have <HI>no &s;aving Experience</HI> of Religion upon your Souls, never yet have &s;een either your Mi|&s;ery or the Need of the Remedy. Poor Souls! alas what will it avail you that you are profe&s;&s;edly on the Lord's Side and &s;eemingly very warm in the Cau&s;e, cry|ing with <HI>Jehu, Come &s;ee my Zeal for the Lord of Ho&s;ts?</HI> If your Heart be not right with God, your being among good Company will be no more Benefit to you than it was to <HI>Judas.</HI>&mdash;What are you tru&s;ting to? Is it your Bapti&s;m, your vi&s;ible Church-Member&s;hip, your Specu|lative or Head-Knowledge, your Soundne&s;s and Ortho|doxy in Principle? I tell you though the&s;e Things mu&s;t be, yet of them&s;elves they will never do: You may have all the&s;e, and yet if you go no further, you'l certainly be damned. Think not then to &s;ay within your&s;elves we have <HI>Abraham</HI> to our Father: Tru&s;t not to lying Words, &s;aying, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord. Or are you tru&s;ting to your Con|victions? Is it the Ground of your Confidence that you have &s;hed a few Tears and can remember the Time when you were under &s;ome Concern? Remember that this of it &s;elf will not do; that <HI>Felix</HI> trembled, the Sin|ners in <HI>Zion</HI> were afraid, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 33.14. That <HI>E&s;au</HI> &s;hed
<PB N="29" REF="004992_0036_100E520B16565A70">Tears, and yet was no true Penitent: Your Heart mu&s;t be changed, your Affections mu&s;t be turned into another Channel? Yea the prevailing Bent and Tem|per of your Souls mu&s;t be quite altered: In a Word, you mu&s;t become <HI>new Creatures,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.17.</P>
<P>But then <HI>la&s;t of all</HI> to you who are not only <HI>warm</HI> in this good Cau&s;e, but are &s;o <HI>from a right Principle.</HI> I would &s;ay to you my dear Brethren; that I hope there are none of you in any Mea&s;ure &s;haken by the Oppo&s;ition that God's Work meets with in various Places. Certainly you have no Rea&s;on. I can appeal to you, whether tho&s;e who may be look'd upon as the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Promoters of the pre&s;ent Work have been bringing any new Doctrines to your Ears, with Re&s;pect to the Nature of Conver&s;ion, or with Re&s;pect to the Operations of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, or with Re&s;pect to A&s;&s;urance of Grace; or in any one Particular, but what are the Doctrines of your Bibles, of your Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, and Cate|chi&s;ms; the Doctrines which your dear Ance&s;tors died in, and which &s;ome of them &s;ealed with their Blood.&mdash; Don't then &s;uffer your &s;elves to be banter'd out of your Sen&s;es, by a loud Cry of Error and Here&s;y breaking in upon the Church; when you cannot but know that it is a fal&s;e Alarm.&mdash;And if you would not be &s;oon &s;haken in Mind; be always labouring after greater Degrees of Knowledge, to be better rooted in your Principles, to ar|rive at the Stature of adult Men in Chri&s;tianity, who have their Sen&s;es exerci&s;ed to know both good and Evil, &mdash;Hold fa&s;t the Profe&s;&s;ion of your Faith without waver|ing; that you be not henceforth Children, to&s;&s;ed to and fro and carried about with every Wind of Doctrine. &mdash; And, my dear Brethren, let me in particular exhort you to keep up <HI>Heart Work,</HI> and to maintain &s;piritual Com|munion with God: Watch and pray that ye enter not into Temptation: Remember that though you are not the Devil's Subjects, that yet you are &s;till in his Territo|ries, and therefore liable to his A&s;&s;aults. &mdash; Be careful
<PB N="30" REF="004992_0037_100E520D590676B0">to exerci&s;e the Chri&s;tian Grace of <HI>Charity:</HI> Don't be guilty of ra&s;h judging: Remember that your Lord has &s;aid, <HI>Judge not, that ye be not judged.</HI> See that you con|demn not all that differ from you in Judgment about the pre&s;ent Work, as carnal, gracele&s;s and Enemies to God. Con&s;ider that even a good Man may be a while in an Error. This I charitably believe is the Ca&s;e with &s;ome in the Land at this Day.&mdash;See that you Guard again&s;t a litigious, wrangling Temper: Don't be forward upon all Occa&s;ions to enter into Di&s;putes with the Oppo&s;ers of the pre&s;ent Work: Such a Humour, if it prevail, will have a mi&s;chievous Tendency in&s;en&s;ibly to worm out practical Religion. Rather then, choo&s;e to convince your Oppo&s;ers by your Lives: Let your Light &s;hine before Men, that they may &s;ee your good Works. If they &s;ay you are proud, convince them that tis fal&s;e, by your Humility: If they &s;ay you are uncharitable, con|vince them by your Charity. If they &s;ay you are con|tentious, &s;hew them that it is not &s;o, by your peaceable Conduct. Shew by the&s;e Means that your Religion is more than an empty Name; having a powerful Influ|ence on your Practice: That the Grace of God which has appeared unto you bringing Salvation, has taught you to deny Ungodline&s;s and all worldly Lu&s;ts, and to live &s;oberly righteou&s;ly and godly in the pre&s;ent World.&mdash;If thus my Brethren you conduct your &s;elves, God will &s;ay to you as he did to the Church of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> Revel. 3.8, 10. <HI>Thou ha&s;t a little Strength, and ha&s;t kept my Word, and ha&s;t not denied my Name: Becau&s;e thou ha&s;t kept the Word of my Patience; I al&s;o will keep thee from the Hour of Temptation which cometh upon all the World, to try them that dwell upon the Earth.</HI></P>
