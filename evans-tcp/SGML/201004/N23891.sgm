<OPENER><SALUTE>REV'D SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A GENTLEMAN in this town, to whom Mr. Leaming's "Defence" was lately &s;ent, &s;aw fit, a few days ago, to put it into my hands, de&s;iring I would give it a reading; which I have ac|cordingly done.</P>
<P>How far it may be ju&s;tly called, <Q>a Defence of Epi&s;copacy again&s;t your &s;ermon,</Q> I am not able to &s;ay; not having had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> plea&s;ure of ever &s;eeing it: But 'tis with great impropriety &s;tiled <Q>a defence again&s;t mine;</Q> as nineteen parts in twenty of what I had &s;aid, is pa&s;&s;ed over, without &s;o much as an attempt to examine its force, or &s;hew its incon|clu&s;ivene&s;s in point of argument. Was it not that my name is now and then mentioned, no one would imagine he had it in view to an&s;wer me, any more than an hundred others, who have appeared on the &s;ame &s;ide of the que&s;tion in di&s;pute.</P>
<P>I e&s;teem my &s;ermon as full an an&s;wer to his "de|fence," as if wrote on purpo&s;e to confute it; and a&s;k no other favour than that they be carefully com|pared with each other, and an impartial judgment formed thereupon. If this is done, I can't &s;uppo&s;e that any one, be&s;ides Mr. L. will be di&s;po&s;ed to think, <Q>that he has an&s;wered the mo&s;t material things advanced by Dr. Chauncy:</Q> It mu&s;t be deter|mined, on the contrary, that he has &s;carce taken no|tice of any thing material that I have offered.</P>
<P>I have no other knowledge of this gentleman, than what may be collected from this &s;mall work of his; which has not, I confe&s;s, given me an exalted opin|ion
<PB N="iv" REF="031609_0003_0FED5AD13B176930">of him. Was I inclined to engage-in the epi&s;|copal controver&s;y, I &s;hould choo&s;e for my opponent, one that is better able to manage a di&s;pute, than he appears to me to be. What good purpo&s;e would it &s;erve to write, though it were never &s;o clearly and &s;trongly, when one knows before hand, that little notice may be taken of what is wrote, and yet the whole be completely an&s;wered?&mdash;He has &s;aid but little, very little but what has been an&s;wered an hundred times over, and with arguments much too powerful to be &s;et a&s;ide by him.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry your lot is ca&s;t among tho&s;e who are deeply tinctured with high-church principles. Such are always bigots them&s;elves, and zealou&s;ly endeavor to make others &s;o too. This was the ca&s;e among us in former years; but the&s;e high-flying notions are now almo&s;t ab&s;orbed in a more generous way of think|ing. There are but few who dare openly profe&s;s their adherence to the&s;e tenets, whatever their private thoughts may be. 'Tis indeed high time they were univer&s;ally eradicated out of men's minds, they are &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;s in them&s;elves, as well as contrary to the word of God.</P>
<P>However, as the ca&s;e is circum&s;tanced with you, it may be well for you to take him to ta&s;k, and point out his weakne&s;s; which, as I imagine, you will find no difficult matter.</P>
<P>It would be doing too much honour to him, for us both to be engaged in the di&s;pute with him: Though I believe it is in reality a di&s;pute with the combined clergy in tho&s;e parts. By the account I have of Mr. L. he is not equal to the performance that comes out in his name, however in&s;ufficient it may be as an an|&s;wer to either of us.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I preached and publi&s;hed my di&s;|cour&s;e upon ordination, I had no thoughts of engaging in a controver&s;y. Providence had ca&s;t my lot in that part of Chri&s;t's vineyard, where there are &s;undry epi&s;copalians, inter&s;per&s;ed among the people of my charge, as well as in the neighbor|hood. Though I never could find any &s;cripture warrant, for the peculiarities that di&s;tingui&s;h that church from the re&s;t of the prote&s;tant world; tho' it has many defects in its orders, wor&s;hip and di&s;|cipline, and is con&s;iderably different from the plan laid down by our Saviour and his apo&s;tles, and followed by the primitive chri&s;tians in the next &s;ucceeding ages; yet as it appears to have the e&s;&s;entials of religion, it has ever been my prac|tice to treat its profe&s;&s;ors as chri&s;tian brethren, tho' mi&s;taken in &s;ome points; agreeable to the apo&s;|tolic direction,
<Q>Him that is weak in the faith receive, but not to doubtful di&s;putations.</Q> A wrangling di&s;putatious temper among the di&s;ci|ples, e&s;pecially among the mini&s;ters of the Prince of Peace, is odious and unchri&s;tian. As the things in which we agree, are, by all allowed, to be of infi|nitely greater importance than tho&s;e in which we differ; how can that zeal be defended which &s;pends it&s;elf only, or principally, about the latter, while the former are treated with comparative neg|lect? Is it not much more becoming the charac|ter of chri&s;tians and mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, to lay a&s;ide the&s;e bickerings, and unite our endeavours
<PB N="vi" REF="031609_0004_0FED5A9894C517C8">in oppo&s;ing the growing cau&s;e of infidelity and irreligon, and promoting the more important truths of our common chri&s;tianity? The&s;e are the principles agreeable to which I have ever treated our epi&s;copal di&s;&s;enters: And I challenge the whole party <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> produce an in&s;tance, in which I have ever begun a di&s;pute with them upon the controverted points, or attempted, publicly or privately, to prejudice them again&s;t their own wor&s;hip or min|i&s;try. I e&s;teem it a greater honour to promote the real intere&s;t of religion, than that of any par|ticular denomination; and, if I know my own hears, had much rather be the happy in&s;trument of &s;avingly converting one &s;oul to Chri&s;t; than of making a thou&s;and pro&s;elytes, merely to the low de&s;igns of a party. It has ever given me pain, to ob&s;erve the prevalence of a contrary temper and conduct, in tho&s;e of any denomination, whether clergy or laity. How far this has been the ca&s;e with the epi&s;copalians in the&s;e parts, would, per|haps, be deemed invidious in me to &s;ay. Sure I am, if I had not ob&s;erved too many in&s;tances of this kind; had I not been repeatedly &s;olicited, to preach and publi&s;h upon the &s;ubject, as a nece&s;|&s;ary antidote again&s;t the effects of them; the di&s;|cour&s;e I am now called upon to vindicate, never would have &s;een the light. In compo&s;ing of it, I &s;tudiou&s;ly guarded again&s;t every thing offen&s;ive; for I had no de&s;ire to be drawn into a controver&s;y. Had I been di&s;po&s;ed to this, I could not have been at a lo&s;s for materials. It is well known, that be|&s;ides the exorbitant, un&s;criptural claims of their bi&s;hops, and the mean, &s;ervile &s;ubjection of the pre&s;byters, in that church; there are &s;ome things in her articles, and in her wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline many more, which are, (at lea&s;t in our opinion) highly exceptionable. However naturally many of the&s;e things fell in my way, while writing up|on
<PB N="vii" REF="031609_0004_0FED5A9894C517C8">this &s;ubject, I carefully &s;uppre&s;&s;ed them; for my maxim was to act only on the defen&s;ive, and endeavour, by &s;cripture and rea&s;on, to vindicate our mini&s;terial authority from the perpetual at|tacks of the party. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, I had rea&s;on to conclude, that the mo&s;t &s;anguine and zealous among them would not be offended, or look upon them&s;elves concerned to an&s;wer me, either from the pulpit or the pre&s;s. But no &s;oon|er was the piece publi&s;hed, than the epi&s;copa pulpits, here and in the neighborhood, re&s;ounded with the old cry, "the power, the power;" and repeatedly rung over all the various changes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the <HI>nullity</HI> of pre&s;byterian orders and admini&s;tra|tions, the ab&s;olute <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of uninterrupted &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, and the <HI>unalterable and divine right</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> epi&s;copacy. And among the re&s;t, it was &s;aid, Mr. L. often di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf upon the topic, with &s;ingular pathos and zeal.</P>
<P>IT was &s;oon given out, that an an&s;wer to my piece would be publi&s;hed: But as no particular author was named, and the rumour abated; it was generally concluded, as they had no call to en|gage in the controver&s;y, the de&s;ign was laid a&s;ide. However, after a preparation of near three years, Mr. L. has &s;een fit to &s;tep forth, and favor the public with the fir&s;t fruits of his pen, in what he is plea&s;ed to call
<Q>A defence of the epi&s;copal government of the church, containing remarks upon two late noted &s;ermons, on pre&s;byterian ordination.</Q></P>
<P>WHAT I was to expect, from &s;uch an opponent, I was at a lo&s;s to determine; having never had a ta&s;te of his abilities for managing a controver&s;y. When the book came out, I read it with a good degree of attention; and was not a little &s;urprized to find, that after &s;o long preparation, the au|thor had &s;o little to &s;ay, upon the two pieces he had
<PB N="viii" REF="031609_0005_0FED5A9C57322028">&s;et him&s;elf to an&s;wer. As to Dr. Chauncy's, the Dr. ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, nineteen parts in twenty are pa&s;&s;ed over without a &s;ingle remark. And as to mine, whoever compares it with Mr. L's an&s;wer, will, I am confident, make much the &s;ame remark. Whether he has &s;o fully &s;ucceeded, in tho&s;e parts he pretends to an&s;wer, mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to the judgment of the public, to which I appeal.</P>
<P>FOR the&s;e and &s;uch like rea&s;ons, it was judged at fir&s;t, that to attempt an an&s;wer was no ways nece&s;&s;ary. But as the party &s;oon began to tri|umph in it, as an unan&s;werable piece, and boa&s;t|ed of great exploits done by it, in the addition of &s;undry converts to the epi&s;copal cau&s;e; it was ge|nerally concluded, that &s;omething ought to be wrote by way of reply. This, I hoped, would have been undertaken by Dr. Chauncy, as every way my &s;uperior, e&s;pecially in his acquaintance with this controver&s;y. But as he has declined the &s;ervice, for the rea&s;ons mentioned in his letter, prefixed to the&s;e &s;heets; it of cour&s;e devolves upon me.</P>
<P>As I am con&s;cious of no other motive in the af|fair, than a &s;incere regard to truth, and the inter|e&s;t of our churches, which I really believe to be the intere&s;t of the Redeemer's kingdom; I &s;hall endeavour fairly to examine <HI>every thing</HI> in Mr. L's book, that looks like an argument, and give it its due weight. For as it is truth rather than victory I aim at; &s;o the former will &s;hine brighte&s;t when placed in <HI>contra&s;t</HI> with every thing that oppo&s;es it; and as to the latter, he who &s;hould challenge it for only <HI>nibbling</HI> at here and there a &s;entence in his an|tagoni&s;t, mu&s;t I conceive, appear with a very ill grace. This, however, will make me more leng|thy, than might otherwi&s;e be thought needful.</P>
<P>ONE thing I think proper to premi&s;e.&mdash;Since, notwith&s;tanding the caution u&s;ed, both by the Dr.
<PB N="ix" REF="031609_0005_0FED5A9C57322028">and my&s;elf, to avoid a controver&s;y with epi&s;co|palians, they have &s;een fit to engage in one; and will not &s;uffer us even to defend our cau&s;e, when called upon &s;o to do, without taking the alarm; I &s;hall not look upon my&s;elf holden to ob&s;erve the like caution, in that re&s;pect, as I did in my &s;er|mon. If therefore in the cour&s;e of this di&s;pute, I &s;hould happen to treat them with le&s;s ceremony: If there &s;hould occa&s;ionally drop from my pen, any direct reflections, or free animadver&s;ions, upon &s;ome very exceptionable and un&s;criptural parts of their &s;cheme, when they fall in my way, I reque&s;t the candid reader to impute it to the proper cau&s;e.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SEC. I. <HI>Remarks upon the</HI> Letter-Writer, <HI>S. I. and Mr. L's Introduction.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MR. L. has u&s;hered his "defence" into pub|lic view, with a letter &s;igned, S. I. Who this gentleman is, we are not concerned to en|quire. As he has &s;een fit to give us only the ini|tial letters of his name, and left us to gue&s;s the re&s;t; he mu&s;t expect no more ceremony than any anony|mous writer, whatever honorary titles he may happen to be dignified with.</P>
<P><Q>OUR opponents, &s;ays he, have of late, with|out any provocation, been mu&s;tering up their old &s;ophi&s;ms again&s;t the ancient epi&s;copal go|vernment of the church, which have been long ago abundantly an&s;wered over and over.</Q> Per|haps the gentleman thinks all arguments again&s;t his &s;cheme, de&s;erve the name of <HI>&s;ophi&s;ms.</HI> He &s;hould remember however, that though to call an argument that pinches, by an ugly name, may be an ea&s;y method to get rid of it; yet in the judg|ment of the candid, a &s;olid refutation would be more &s;atisfactory. That our arguments are <HI>old,</HI> is readily granted; for &s;o is truth: But that they are the wor&s;e or the weaker upon that account, ap|pears not. Nor does it appear that the&s;e argu|ments have been all abundantly, I mean &s;olidly <HI>an|&s;wered.</HI> To pretend to an&s;wer an argument, is one
<PB N="11" REF="031609_0006_0FED5AB1AAFAEA18">thing; to do it effectually, another. The former, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, we allow. The latter perhaps wants proof: We have only his bare word for it; and as he &s;eems to be an intere&s;ted per&s;on, the public, and not he, will be pre&s;umed the proper|e&s;t judge. But then,
<Q>The&s;e &s;ophi&s;ms have been mu&s;tered up again&s;t the <HI>ancient</HI> epi&s;copal go|vernment of the church.</Q> Had he &s;aid again&s;t the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> government of the church of England, as explained by &s;ome of her zealous &s;ons; the words would have read as well, and been more agreeable to truth. Every &s;ect, almo&s;t, is apt to boa&s;t of its antiquity; and if bare <HI>a&s;&s;ertions</HI> are ad|mitted as proof, one has as good a claim to the honour as another. That the pre&s;ent government of the church of England, is <HI>epi&s;copal,</HI> none will deny: But that it is very <HI>ancient,</HI> at lea&s;t &s;o <HI>an|cient</HI> as &s;ome of its advocates pretend, is by ma|ny denied. As to my&s;elf, I am fully per&s;uaded, that notwith&s;tanding all its high pretences to an|tiquity; it is comparatively a mere novel, up&s;tart in&s;titution. So far from being the true <HI>ancient</HI> epi&s;copacy, that prevailed in the apo&s;tles times, and the ages next following; that it is, in many re&s;pects, diametrically oppo&s;ite to it and de&s;truc|tive of it. This, I pre&s;ume, will appear in the following pages.</P>
<P>BUT after all, if we had attacked even the church of England, without <HI>provocation,</HI> it was doubtle&s;s wrong. This is a charge commonly brought by our epi&s;copalians. Notwith&s;tanding the uncommon genero&s;ity, with which they are treated in this country, and the &s;ingular indulgence of the &s;tate towards them, above what was ever &s;hewn to <HI>di&s;&s;enters,</HI> in any part of the chri&s;tian world; they are often complaining of oppo&s;ition and ill-u&s;age. At lea&s;t, if we will believe them, they never begin a controver&s;y. They are forced
<PB N="12" REF="031609_0007_0FED5A8A8865BFF0">into it, in their own defence. This gentleman tells us,
<Q>the&s;e opponents, (meaning, I &s;uppo&s;e, Dr. Chauncy and I) have of late been mu&s;ter|ing, &amp;c. again&s;t the church, <HI>without any pro|vocation.</HI></Q> Mr. L. &s;ays,
<Q>I am fully per&s;uaded, upon the &s;tricte&s;t enquiry, it will be found, that there cannot be one &s;ingle in&s;tance produced, for thirty years pa&s;t, in which our clergy have begun the di&s;pute.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Defence, p. 7.</NOTE> And,
<Q>When the church of England is <HI>attacked,</HI> her clergy &s;up|po&s;e they ought to <HI>defend</HI> it.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 8.</NOTE> His book is
<Q>therefore called a <HI>defence,</HI> &amp;c. And this is the only rea&s;on that cau&s;es him to publi&s;h this <HI>de|fence.</HI></Q> But is this repre&s;entation hone&s;t? Are pre&s;byterians &s;uch quarrel&s;ome neighbors, as al|ways to be <HI>attacking</HI> the church of England? And <HI>beginning</HI> the controver&s;y with her, <HI>without provo|tion?</HI> Nothing le&s;s. The fir&s;t piece wrote upon the controver&s;y, in this country, was on the epi&s;|copal &s;ide. And the fir&s;t in this colony, by one with whom, I pre&s;ume, S. I. is intimately ac|quainted. What then can the&s;e gentlemen mean, by <HI>attacks</HI> upon the church of England? Had ei|ther the Dr. or I, denied her the e&s;&s;entials of a true church; had we di&s;puted the <HI>validity</HI> of her mini&s;try;&mdash;pronounced a <HI>nullity</HI> upon her admin|i&s;trations;&mdash;ranked her clergy among the &s;ons of <HI>Korah,</HI> or her members with <HI>heathen Jews</HI> and <HI>infidels;</HI> or had we <HI>directly</HI> attempted to expo&s;e any of tho&s;e many things, which are, at lea&s;t, highly exceptionable in her doctrines, di&s;cipline, orders, and wor&s;hip; they might, with more pro|priety &s;ound the alarm, and cry,
<Q>an <HI>attack</HI> up|on the church.</Q> Every one knows, how com|mon the&s;e <HI>cants</HI> are, from a certain quarter. But is there any thing of this kind in the pieces Mr.
<PB N="13" REF="031609_0007_0FED5A8A8865BFF0">L. pretends to an&s;wer? Certainly nothing. They bravely <HI>defend</HI> our mini&s;try, from the exceptions of the&s;e zealous advocates for epi&s;copacy, who&s;e high-flying principles, lead them to anathematize all of our communion, and leave all the prote&s;tant world, but them&s;elves, to the uncovenanted mer|cies of God. According to the&s;e gentlemen, it &s;eems, there can be no defence of pre&s;byterian principles, however mode&s;t, without <HI>attacking</HI> the church of England. This is a great mi&s;take. Let but the church of England, even in her pre&s;ent form, be put upon her original and true footing;&mdash; let her re&s;t upon the foundation, which the fir&s;t re|formers, and all her moderate and catholic &s;ons &s;ince, have fixed for her; I mean <HI>the civil authori|ty of the King and parliament;</HI> and they never need fear being <HI>attacked</HI> by us. A <HI>defence</HI> of pre&s;byte|tian ordination and government, will be no direct oppo&s;ition to the church of England, in this view of it. Had there never been any higher claims for her, (and, to me, it is clear there never oughts) Had her &s;ons in this country, contented them&s;elves, with challenging for her, the honour of being a valuable branch of the reformation, and of having the authority in England, engaged for her e&s;tab|li&s;hment and &s;upport there; I am confident, "the annual lecture in Cambridge," at which Mr. L. is &s;o much nettled, never would have had a being; nor the pieces he pretends to an&s;wer, have &s;een the light.</P>
<P>BUT the grand &s;ecret no doubt is:&mdash;The cau&s;e of epi&s;copacy is to be pu&s;hed in America, at all events. And, upon trial, this it &s;eems, has been found the be&s;t expedient&mdash;to unhinge and perplex the minds of ignorant people,&mdash;to fill their heads with airy notions of the <HI>ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of epi&s;co|pal ordination, prejudice them again&s;t their own mini&s;ters, as having no <HI>commi&s;&s;ion</HI> from Chri&s;t, no <HI>au|thority</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="031609_0008_0FED5A83C1788E70">to perform the divine offices of religion, and boldly pronouncing <HI>nullity</HI> upon all their ad|mini&s;trations. This is the general &s;train of all the pieces upon the controver&s;y, that have been wrote in this country. If this was not Mr. L.'s de&s;ign, he had no call to engage in the di&s;pute. This, however, is no new art. All oppo&s;ers of religion, have ever made their mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful attacks, through the &s;ides of its clergy. Thus did Korah, Dathan and Abiram. They fell upon Mo&s;es and Aaron, and denied their authority, as officers in God's church. "Ye take too much upon you." The &s;cribes and phari&s;ees did the &s;ame in their oppo&s;ition to chri&s;tianity in its infancy. They "compa&s;&s;ed &s;ea and land to make pro&s;elytes," they attacked the divine author of the go&s;pel, and boldly que&s;tioned his authority, as a public officer in the church.

The Judaizing teachers, (who, by the way, were notable &s;ticklers for unin&s;tituted rites and ceremonies in religion,) traduced his charac|ter, denied his mini&s;terial authority, and in that way endeavoured to prejudice people's mind, and draw off a party to follow them.

<PB N="15" REF="031609_0008_0FED5A83C1788E70">of this country, in the late times.&mdash;But to return.</P>
<P><Q>FOR ten years, &s;ays Mr. L. before this, the church of England and <HI>di&s;&s;enters,</HI> lived in a peaceful &s;tate: But &s;ince they have publi&s;hed &s;o many things again&s;t that church, it has a lit|tle di&s;concerted the de&s;ign of our clergy.</Q> If the "de&s;ign of their clergy" is to promote prac|tical godline&s;s, and make converts to Je&s;us Chri&s;t; I am at a lo&s;s to find any thing in the books he &s;peaks of, tending to <HI>di&s;concert</HI> it. But if their grand <HI>de&s;ign</HI> is, to convert <HI>pre&s;byterians</HI> to the doc|trines of <HI>prelacy,</HI> and make pro&s;elytes to the church of England, I don't doubt but that it has been a little, perhaps not a very little <HI>di&s;concerted,</HI> by the publications afore&s;aid.&mdash;He adds,
<Q>Who de|termine, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to live peaceably with all men.</Q>&mdash;Peace, without doubt, is a very de&s;irable thing; but if <HI>truth</HI> mu&s;t be the purcha&s;e of it, we beg to be excu&s;ed. We &s;hould heartily rejoice to find them, ever more di&s;po&s;ed to a <HI>peaceful</HI> conduct, than at pre&s;ent they appear to be; and are not con&s;cious of any thing on our &s;ide, to make them otherwi&s;e. But if their <HI>de&s;igns are di&s;concerted,</HI> by opening peoples eyes to di&s;|cover the truth; if their tempers are &s;oured, and they become un&s;ociable, and <HI>unpeaceful,</HI> by a bare detection of the weakne&s;s of their cau&s;e, and they are re&s;olved not to live in <HI>peace,</HI> unle&s;s we will give up all pretences to the character of mini&s;ters and chri&s;tians, and, right or wrong, come over to their party; we mu&s;t plainly tell them, they hold their friend&s;hip too dear.</P>
<P><Q>THIS conduct of their mini&s;ters, &s;ays S. I. to his client, has made it nece&s;&s;ary for us to write again, in defence of the church; and I am glad, and thank you, that you have undertaken this office, and &s;o well acquitted your&s;elf in the di&s;|charge
<PB N="16" REF="031609_0009_0FED5AE9136C1F48">of it.</Q> How well Mr. L. has acquitted him&s;elf in this <HI>office,</HI> mu&s;t be left to the reader.&mdash; However, if all our arguments are but <HI>&s;ophi&s;ms;</HI> e&s;pecially if they
<Q>have been long ago abundant|ly an&s;wered over and over by others;</Q> 'tis no great purcha&s;e to do it again. But a &s;mattering of logic will &s;erve, to an&s;wer a <HI>&s;ophi&s;m,</HI> and detect its fallacy. And if in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, this has been &s;o often done before, &s;ome perhaps may be ready to doubt, whether Mr. L. has not acted the <HI>plagiary,</HI> and only publi&s;hed the works of others, in his own name. Be&s;ides, if all our <HI>&s;ophi&s;ms</HI> have been &s;o often, &s;o abundantly an&s;wered before, what occa&s;ion was there for doing of it again?&mdash; Not that I would detract from Mr. L.'s perform|ance. It is really better than I expected from <HI>him;</HI> and, &s;o far as he enters into the &s;ubject, as good, I imagine, as the cau&s;e will well admit. After all, I can hardly think he has done quite &s;o much exe|cution with it, as his friend &s;uppo&s;es. According to him, all our arguments &s;tand no more chance, before the formidable artillery of this mighty champion, than mere cobwebs or puffballs, be|fore the mouth of a roaring cannon.
<Q>They in|&s;tantly vani&s;h into du&s;t and &s;moke.</Q>
<Q>But no wonder: Since whatever plau&s;ible appearance they make, they are but mere cavils.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THEIR chief appearance of &s;trength, he adds, lies in the promi&s;cuous u&s;e of the words, bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter.</Q> This gentleman mu&s;t allow me to tell him, he here labours under a great mi&s;|take. If he had read the pieces he makes &s;o free with, he mu&s;t have &s;een that we argue the validi|ty of pre&s;byterian ordination, from the one general commi&s;&s;ion to mini&s;ters in the go&s;pel. As this commi&s;&s;ion belongs to all Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters, we think they mu&s;t be intitled to all the powers it contains; therefore to ordination, which is one of the&s;e pow|ers.
<PB N="17" REF="031609_0009_0FED5AE9136C1F48">We argue it, from all go&s;pel mini&s;ters being &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to the apo&s;tles, in their ordinary capa|city, and &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the powers belonging to them, in that capacity, of which ordination is indubitably one.&mdash;We argue it, from there being but one kind, or order of mini&s;ters, to be found in the New-Te&s;tament,&mdash;but one &s;et of qualifi|cations required,&mdash;one general work or bu&s;ine&s;s a&s;&s;igned,&mdash;and only one method of introduction into office pre&s;cribed for them all. Finally, we produce, as we think, plain and expre&s;s in&s;tances, from &s;cripture, of ordination by pre&s;byters, pro|perly &s;o called, which is more than our opponents have ever been able to do, for epi&s;copal ordina|tion, though often reque&s;ted &s;o to do.</P>
<P>'TIS true,
<Q>the promi&s;cuous u&s;e of the words, bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter in &s;cripture</Q> is one of our arguments, and, we think, a good one. For if the&s;e names were applied in common to all go&s;pel mini&s;ters at that time; if every &s;cripture pre&s;by|ter was really a bi&s;hop then, we &s;ee no rea&s;on why it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e now. At lea&s;t the in&s;tance he brings to convince us of our mi&s;take; to con|vince us, that though bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter were one office in the apo&s;tles times, yet they <HI>ought</HI> not to be &s;o now; does not &s;eem &s;o happily cho&s;en to prove the point, though it &s;erves well enough, to &s;hew how the alteration was introduced into the chri&s;tian church, the motives leading to it, and the means u&s;ed to accompli&s;h it.</P>
<P>THE in&s;tance he produces is this.&mdash;<Q>They might, &s;ays he, with ju&s;t the &s;ame rea&s;on, argue and conclude, that Pompey and Augu&s;tus were of the &s;ame office, becau&s;e they were both call|ed <HI>imperatores;</HI> when all the world knows, that within 50 years, (as the ca&s;e hath often been with other words) a different &s;et of ideas was
<PB N="18" REF="031609_0010_0FED5A9F1D2BAAA8">annexed to that word from what it meant 50 years before: Which was plainly the ca&s;e, with the word, bi&s;hop, when the church came to be &s;ettled, &amp;c.</Q> The truth of the fact he men|tions, as to the Roman &s;tate. I readily allow,&mdash; nor will I di&s;pute the propriety of the applica|tion. It has indeed, in this in&s;tance, (as he ju&s;t|ly ob&s;erves) fared with the chri&s;tian church, much as it did with the ancient Roman common-wealth. While Rome was free, and retained her happy re|publican form of government; the term, <HI>impera|tor,</HI> meant only an officer in the army, of equal authority with his brother officers of the &s;ame ti|tle. But when Julias Cae&s;ar, that grand u&s;urper, not content with the original honours and powers of his office, as general; but fired with unbounded thir&s;t of dominion, found means to de&s;troy the an|cient form of government, and en&s;lave his country; then he appropriated the title to him&s;elf and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors, and &s;o the word, <HI>imperator,</HI> in proce&s;s of time, came to &s;ignify, one of &s;upreme au|thority over all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">hers, both in the army and &s;tate.</P>
<P>AND has it not happened, even &s;o, with the word, <HI>bi&s;hop,</HI> in the chri&s;tian church? Originally it &s;ignified, <HI>barely</HI> a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, a &s;tanding officer in the church, only of equal power with the re&s;t of his brethren in the mini&s;try. But the church of Rome, in imitation of the &s;tate, have long &s;ince, de&s;troyed the original parity, that fir&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among the go&s;pel mini&s;ters, and, togeth|er with the <HI>power,</HI> appropriated the <HI>title</HI> of bi&s;hop, in its highe&s;t &s;ignification, to the pope, the grand u&s;urper and en&s;laver of God's people, in &s;pirituals, and made him lord paramount, over all the officers and members in the church of Chri&s;t. And pity it is, that any prote&s;tant church, &s;hould &s;o far af|fect to ape and imitate them, as to adulterate the &s;criptural meaning of the word, bi&s;hop, to appro|priate
<PB N="19" REF="031609_0010_0FED5A9F1D2BAAA8">the title to a pretended &s;uperior order of officers in the church, as expre&s;&s;ive of a lordly authority over their brethren in the mini&s;try, who were all originally upon a level, as to power; all true &s;cripture-bi&s;hops. Is not this too much like &s;ymbolizing with the church of Rome, the moth|er of harlots and abominations? Is it not too lightly departing from the &s;cripture pattern, and treating with too much neglect, that &s;olemn cau|tion, given by the great head of the church, to his mini&s;ters,
<Q>be ye not called <HI>rabbi, ma&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er, lord;</HI> for one is your ma&s;ter, even Chri&s;t, and all ye are <HI>brethren.</HI></Q></P>
<P>LET the candid reader now judge, whether there is not &s;ome weight in this argument, drawn from the <HI>identity</HI> of
<Q>the names, bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter in &s;cripture</Q> in &s;upport of pre&s;byterian ordina|tion, after all this gentleman has &s;aid to defeat it? Or whether it is, as he &s;ays,
<Q>a mere <HI>logomachy,</HI> or &s;trife about words, fixing modern ideas to old names?</Q> Be&s;ides, who is it that has in|troduced this logomachy,
<Q>this &s;trife about words?</Q> Who,
<Q>that affix modern ideas to old names?</Q> They, who have affixed to the name bi&s;hop, originally the &s;ame, by his own con|fe&s;&s;ion, with pre&s;byter; the
<Q>modern additional ideas</Q> of &s;uperior authority, and a lordly do|minion, over his brother bi&s;hops and fellow pre&s;|byters? Or we, who con&s;ider him, in the &s;ame &s;tate of equality with his brethren, in which the &s;cripture has fixed him? They, who arrogate to him, the &s;ole power of ordination and govern|ment? Or we, who, agreeable to &s;cripture pat|tern, leave the&s;e powers in common to all go&s;pel mini&s;ters? If there is any adulteration, any per|ver&s;ion of words from their original &s;ignification, "or affixing modern ideas to old names," let tho&s;e be an&s;werable who have given the occa&s;ion.</P>

NOTHING of con&s;equence occurs in the remain|ing parts of this letter, but what we &s;hall meet with in the piece it accompanies, and which will be there con&s;idered. He indeed tells us
<Q>they maintain</Q> the ancient government of the church "was epi&s;copal;" that Timothy was an in&s;tance of it at Ephe&s;us, and the apocalyptic angel anoth|er, &amp;c. &amp;c. To which he finally adds, the te&s;|timony of the fathers, who, if we may believe him, were all upon their &s;ide of the que&s;tion: And then &s;ays;&mdash;<Q>They, (the fathers) mu&s;t have as well known the form, in which the apo&s;|tles, under divine in&s;piration, e&s;tabli&s;hed and left the church; as we now know how ours was, in Q. Elizabeth's time.</Q></P>
<P>An&s;wer.</P>
<P>IT is not true in fact, that the&s;e ancient fathers, had &s;uch perfect knowledge of the original in&s;ti|tution of the church, or that their writings in this ca&s;e are &s;o certainly to be depended upon, as his argument &s;uppo&s;es. If their writings are a &s;ure guide for us in one ca&s;e, they are in another. But 'tis well known the&s;e &s;ame fathers maintained the doctrine of the millennium, and practi&s;ed giv|ing the &s;acrament to infants; and moreover de|clared that they received the&s;e things from the apo&s;tles them&s;elves. This they a&s;&s;ert as fully, as they do the doctrine this gentleman cites them to prove. And yet his church, and all others, for many hundred years, reject the te&s;timony of the fathers in the afore&s;aid in&s;tances, as being re|pugnant to the word of God. But further, grant|ing his a&s;&s;ertion to be true,
<Q>that the&s;e writers knew as well what form of government prevail|ed in the apo&s;tles times, as we do, what was the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the church of England in Q. Elizabeth's time;</Q> yet this will not prove that di|oce&s;an epi&s;copacy is of divine right. This gentle|man, and other zealots of his party, a&s;&s;ert, that epi&s;|copacy 
<PB N="21" REF="031609_0011_0FED5AD67103E1D0">in England, at the time of the reformation, was &s;ettled upon the foot of divine in&s;titution.&mdash; Others, not only pre&s;byterians, but many eminent and learned epi&s;copalians, affirm the contrary:&mdash; They deny it has any pretence of divine right in its original e&s;tabli&s;hment, but re&s;ts wholly upon the civil authority and acts of parliament, for its exi&s;tence in its pre&s;ent form. Now both of the&s;e opinions can't be true. If then we can't, at this day, certainly know, upon what footing the church of England &s;tood in the reign of Q. Elizabeth; we certainly cannot know from the writings of the&s;e fathers, what was the apo&s;tolic in&s;titution of the church, even allowing that they knew it, as well as we do, what was e&s;tabli&s;hed by Q. Eliza|beth and her parliament: For, it &s;eems, we are far from being agreed in that, and therefore don't certainly know it.&mdash;But what &s;poils the whole of this argument for epi&s;copacy, is that it takes for granted a fact which is not true.
<Q>The fathers te&s;tify in favour of dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy, there|fore it is of divine in&s;titution.</Q> I deny the fact. It is &s;o far from being true, that any of the fathers of the two fir&s;t centuries, declare in favour of dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy, much le&s;s that this was the form of church government handed down to them from the apo&s;tles; that, on the contrary, their writings unanimou&s;ly exhibit to view a form, diametrical|ly oppo&s;ite to and ab&s;olutely de&s;tructive of, the pre&s;ent dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy, that prevails in the church of England. This I propo&s;e to prove in its proper place, to which I refer the reader.</P>
<P>HE goes on; <Q>This was always <HI>my way</HI> of ar|guing.</Q> An&s;wer. Some men are ob&s;erved, to have a very odd and wrong-headed <HI>way</HI> of argu|ing, all their days. But barely its being <HI>their way,</HI> the <HI>way</HI> they have always been u&s;ed to, will not prove it to be a good one, or &s;erve to recom|mend it to tho&s;e, who have been accu&s;tomed to a better <HI>way.</HI></P>

HE adds,
<Q>ju&s;t in the &s;ame way do our di&s;&s;ent|ing neighbours, with us, very rightly argue the cau&s;e of infant bapti&s;m, and the fir&s;t day &s;ab|bath; only they have not near &s;o many clear, inconte&s;tible facts, either of &s;cripture or anti|quity, for them, as we have for epi&s;copacy; &s;o that they mu&s;t either give up <HI>them,</HI> or embrace <HI>that,</HI> or be &s;elf-condemned, as incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves.</Q>&mdash;I an&s;wer. There is, at lea&s;t in our opinion, much better evidence, both from &s;cripture and antiquity, in &s;upport of infant bap|ti&s;m, and the fir&s;t day &s;abbath; than for dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy. But if there were not, there is this material difference between us and them. They, from &s;cripture and antiquity, are convinced, as they tell us, that dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy is of divine in&s;titution, and therefore practice it. But then they virtually exclude all other chri&s;tians, from the benefits of the go&s;pel, by denying the authori|ty of their clergy, and the validity of their admin|i&s;trations, and leaving them in the deplorable &s;tate of heathen and infidels.&mdash;We, on the other hand, from the &s;ame te&s;timonies, believe infant bapti&s;m, and the fir&s;t day &s;abbath. We accord|ingly practice them. But then,
<Q>we have not &s;o learned Chri&s;t,</Q> as to think it our duty, either by our principles or practice, to unchurch and un|chri&s;tianize all who differ from us in the&s;e points: But, if they are otherwi&s;e qualified, cheerfully ad|mit their mini&s;ters into our pulpits, and their members to communion, in go&s;pel ordinances.&mdash; We are content to enjoy our principles, without taking upon us to damn all who differ from us.&mdash; Upon the whole then, we don't find our&s;elves greatly embarra&s;&s;ed with this powerful <HI>dilemma,</HI> in which he means to entangle us, in order to draw us over to the church. We really think, not|with&s;tanding all he has &s;aid, we may &s;afely retain
<PB N="23" REF="031609_0012_0FED5AB50E8018E0">our old principles and practice, without incurring the character of &s;elf-incon&s;i&s;tency, in the judgment of the impartial, or feeling the reproaches of &s;elf|condemnation in our own con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>HIS letter concludes with the&s;e words.&mdash;<Q>Let us then faithfully adhere to the doctrine, gov|ernment, and liturgy OF THE MOST EXCELLENT CHURCH OF ENGLAND, WHICH CERTAINLY ARE, AND HAVE BEEN PROVED TO BE, THE MOST SCRIP|TURAL, OF ANY NOW IN THE WORLD.</Q>&mdash;A high encomium! and if ju&s;t, abundantly &s;ufficient to recommend his beloved epi&s;copacy to the good graces of all mankind.

I &s;hall now do him the &s;ame friendly office, in pointing out a few of his; &s;ome of which greatly affect the &s;ubject he is upon. The fir&s;t I &s;hall notice is a general one that runs thro' his piece, as well as the letter prefixed to it; I mean, his calling tho&s;e of our communion in this country, <HI>di&s;&s;enters.</HI> 'Tis pity, I think, the&s;e gentlemen don't con&s;ider where they live, before they give them&s;elves &s;uch airs.

<P>IN page 37, he is chargeable with another mi&s;|take, and that too expre&s;&s;ed in a manner, hardly con&s;i&s;tent with the character of a polite gentleman, upon which, 'tis &s;aid, he pretty much values him|&s;elf.&mdash;What I intend is, his charging me with downright fal&s;ehood and di&s;hone&s;ty for a certain pa&s;&s;age in my book.

<Q>Mr. Welles, in P. 27, has the&s;e remarkable words. By bi&s;hops, they, (the church) mean, I hope, true &s;cripture bi&s;hops, not merely creatures of the &s;tate, of human in&s;titution!</Q> On which he very <HI>genteelly</HI> remarks.

<Q>I am per&s;uaded that the external government of the church, under a chri&s;tian magi&s;trate, mu&s;t be according to the <HI>kind</HI> and <HI>form</HI> of government, u&s;ed in the <HI>commonwealth:</HI> El&s;e how can you make the prince, &s;upreme governor of all &s;tates and cau&s;es occle&s;ia&s;tical.</Q> Defen. of an&s;. 372.</P>
<P>Of the &s;ame opinion were Dr. Edwards, and their celebrated Hooker. The former of which, delivers his own and Mr. Hooker's &s;entiments, in the&s;e words,
<Q>The judicious Mr. Hooker holds, that epi&s;copacy may be abrogated; con&s;equently it is not of <HI>divine</HI> and <HI>apo&s;tolic</HI> right, but the <HI>political in&s;titution</HI> of the church.</Q>&mdash;Edw. remains, 257.</P>
<P>Agreeable to which is an act of parliament, in the reign of Hen. VIII. cap. 17, in the&s;e words,
<Q>Arch|bi&s;hops, bi&s;hops, archdeacons, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tical officers, have no manner of juri&s;diction <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical,</HI> but by, under and from his royal maje&s;ty,&mdash;<HI>the &s;u|preme head</HI> of the church of England and Ireland, to whom, by holy &s;cripture, all authority and power is wholly given, to hear and determine, all manner of cau&s;es <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame is declared in an act of parliament, made 1 Edw. VI. cap. 2.
<Q>All authority and juri&s;diction, &s;piritual and temporal, is derived and deduced from the King's maje&s;ty, as &s;upreme head of the&s;e churches and realms of England and Ireland.</Q></P>

<P>This clearly &s;hews, that the epi&s;copal government of the church in England, is not &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;t upon the foundation of &s;cripture; but upon the King's authority, as &s;upreme head of the church. As a further proof of which, in the beginning of the reformation, bi&s;hops ac|tually took out their commi&s;&s;ions from the King, and were promoted by his letters patent; the form of which, as bi&s;hop Burnet tells us, was,
<Q>that the King appoint|ed &s;uch an one to be bi&s;hop, during his natural life, or &s;o long as the behaved well, and <HI>gave him power to ordain, or deprive mini&s;ters to exerci&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction, and perform all other parts of the epi&s;copal function,</HI> and this they were to do, IN THE KING'S NAME AND BY HIS AUTHORITY.</Q></P>

<PB N="27" REF="031609_0014_0FED5AA4E1D27A50">contradiction between this &s;entence, and the oth|er he pretends to quote from P. 50 of my &s;ermon? The words I there u&s;e (for he has not quoted them right) are the&s;e,
<Q>Another argument made u&s;e of, &amp;c.&mdash;is, that the New-Te&s;tament has actually appointed three di&s;tinct orders in the go&s;pel mini&s;try, viz. that of bi&s;hops, &amp;c.</Q>&mdash; Now let the candid reader compare the&s;e two &s;en|tences, and &s;ee if there be any contradiction: Or any thing that could provoke him to treat me &s;o rudely. In one I &s;ay, epi&s;copalians argue their three orders from &s;cripture. In the other I expre&s;s my hope that
<Q>by one of tho&s;e orders, bi&s;hops, they mean &s;cripture bi&s;hops.</Q> In the former, I a&s;&s;ert what they declare their belief in this ca&s;e to be. In the latter, I expre&s;s my charitable hope of their hon|e&s;ty in &s;uch declaration. The&s;e were the <HI>hopes,</HI> the only <HI>hopes,</HI> I mentioned. But Mr. L. very politely replies, "I mu&s;t be &s;o free as to tell him he never <HI>hoped</HI> any &s;uch thing. In &s;ome ca&s;es, I would be far from calling his knowledge in que&s;|tion. But how he could know my heart; how he
<PB N="28" REF="031609_0015_0FED5AA694780938">could certainly tell what I did, or did not <HI>hope,</HI> is be|yond me to conceive. But he tells me, not only that I did not "<HI>hope</HI> &s;o;" but that
<Q>I <HI>knew</HI> the <HI>con|trary</HI> to be true.</Q> Now if I <HI>knew</HI> the contrary to be true, it mu&s;t be becau&s;e it <HI>was</HI> true: Other|wi&s;e, it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible I could know it to be true. But what, I a&s;k, is this <HI>contrary,</HI> which he &s;ays, I know to be true? Plainly this,
<Q>that by bi&s;hops, epi&s;copalians do not mean true &s;cripture bi&s;hops.</Q> This, and nothing el&s;e, &s;tand oppo&s;ed, to what I de|clared was the matter of my hope. All therefore I am able to make of this <HI>remarkable</HI> &s;entence, is this. I had &s;aid,
<Q>I hoped, by bi&s;hops, epi&s;co|palians mean true &s;cripture bi&s;hops.</Q> Mr. L. denies they mean any &s;uch thing. I had declared, that when they talked &s;o much about the divine right of epi&s;copacy, I was charitably inclined to think they were hone&s;t. But this gentleman plain|ly tells me it is no &s;uch thing. Since therefore he mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to know be&s;t, and will needs have it &s;o; I will grant I was mi&s;taken, as to him in particular; though as to others of his party, he mu&s;t allow me to entertain the &s;ame charitable opin|ion &s;till; at lea&s;t till they give me the &s;ame rea&s;on to alter it, as he has done in his ca&s;e. If this is not his meaning in <HI>the&s;e remarkable</HI> words of his; 'tis indeed difficult to &s;ay, what his meaning is.&mdash; They &s;eem to have no meaning at all; and there|fore (to u&s;e another of his courtly phra&s;es)
<Q>they might have been left out, and his defence would have been as good as it is now.</Q></P>
<P>MR. L. &s;eems to be di&s;plea&s;ed with the <HI>length</HI> of my &s;ermon. In page 30 he has the&s;e words,
<Q>Tho' he (Mr. Welle's) <HI>fleers</HI> about our preach|ing deacons; yet I believe it is really true, that Stephen preached as good a &s;ermon as Mr. Welle's <HI>divine right,</HI> &amp;c. though it was not &s;o long.</Q> I have examined the pa&s;&s;age, to which he refers in this remark, but can find nothing that
<PB N="29" REF="031609_0015_0FED5AA694780938">looks like a <HI>fleer</HI> there. After giving an account of the in&s;titution of deacons, Acts 6, beginning, and an&s;wering the arguments they bring for their preaching; I have the&s;e words,
<Q>Since therefore it plainly appears, that the&s;e deacons, were in no &s;en&s;e, go&s;pel mini&s;ters, but expre&s;&s;ly ap|pointed and &s;et apart to quite another &s;ervice; it undeniably follows that no order in the chri&s;|tian mini&s;try can be founded upon this in&s;tance; and con&s;equently, that their pretended order of preaching deacons, has no warrant&mdash;from the word of God.</Q> Now what is there in the&s;e words, that looks like a <HI>fleer?</HI> It is true, I deni|ed that <HI>preaching</HI> was any part of the &s;cripture dea|con's office; and if after I had proved it was not, I called it, a <HI>pretended order,</HI> &amp;c. I can &s;ee noth|ing criminal in it, nothing that looks like <HI>fleering.</HI> The order of preaching deacons in the church of England, is either a <HI>real</HI> and &s;criptural, or a <HI>pretend|ed</HI> and un&s;criptural one. The former he knows we deny. He knows it was the very thing I was then di&s;proving; and if, when I had, as I thought, &s;ufficiently di&s;proved it, I called it a <HI>pretended</HI> or|der, I can &s;ee no rea&s;on he had to be offended. I hope he would not have me call it a <HI>real &s;criptural</HI> order of the mini&s;try, when I did not believe it to be &s;o, and had proved it not to be &s;o.&mdash;But
<Q>he believes it is really true, that Stephen preach|ed as good a &s;ermon as mine, tho' it was not &s;o long.</Q> Po&s;&s;ibly he does; tho' why he believes it, he has not told us. Sure I am, the &s;cripture, to which he &s;o often appeals, furni&s;hes no evi|dence of it. That indeed gives a lengthy account of this <HI>protomartyr,</HI> but &s;ays not a word about his <HI>preaching</HI> as I can find. 'Tis true it &s;peaks of his <HI>di&s;puting;</HI> but then Mr. L. I pre&s;ume, will not pretend that all <HI>di&s;puting</HI> is <HI>preaching.</HI> He has <HI>di&s;puted</HI> again&s;t my &s;ermon; but he has not pub|licly told us, he ever <HI>preached</HI> again&s;t it, tho' oth|ers
<PB N="30" REF="031609_0016_0FED5AC455E57BE8">&s;ay he did at &s;undry places and times. Wheth|er his <HI>&s;ermon,</HI> upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, was <HI>langer</HI> or <HI>&s;herter,</HI> whether it was <HI>better</HI> or wor&s;e than mine, as it is of little importance, I am not anxious to know. Be that as it will, I do not &s;ee what great rea&s;on <HI>he</HI> had to complain of the <HI>length</HI> of my &s;ermon; &s;ince long as it is, it has given him &s;o little trouble. For all he profe&s;&s;edly attempts to an&s;wer of it, is only my fir&s;t argument, which be|ing compri&s;ed in little more than two pages, could not, one would think, give him any great pain.&mdash; Whether it was the <HI>length,</HI> or the <HI>&s;trength</HI> of the other arguments, that di&s;couraged him from med|dling with them; as he has not &s;een fit to tell us, every one mu&s;t be left to conjecture for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE pieces Mr. L. attempts to an&s;wer, had <HI>occa&s;ionally</HI> mentioned "the right of people to choo&s;e their mini&s;ters." This he has repeatedly remarked upon, tho' not directly connected with the main point; while &s;undry arguments that were, are pa&s;&s;ed by unnoticed. What could be his mo|tive for this, is difficult to gue&s;s. Perhaps he tho't &s;o long as people were left to claim and prize this invaluable privilege; all he could &s;ay upon his <HI>divine-right</HI> and <HI>be&s;t con&s;tituted-church,</HI> would be in&s;ufficient to draw them away from a communion, where this priviledge is enjoyed, to one where it is utterly denied. He attacks Dr. Chauncy upon this head, and &s;pends near two pages in endeav|ouring to di&s;prove it; and, as if that was too lit|tle, he falls upon it again in his remarks upon me. He demands of the Dr.
<Q>Where we find in &s;crip|ture, this to be declared a part of chri&s;tian li|berty,</Q> &amp;c. I pre&s;ume, &s;cripture pattern will &s;atisfy for proof of this point, &s;ince it is all they <HI>pre|tend</HI> to bring for epi&s;copacy, and much more than they are able to produce. And of this kind of proof there is plenty in &s;cripture. From the go&s;pel hi&s;|tory it appears, that this was the univer&s;al prac|tice
<PB N="31" REF="031609_0016_0FED5AC455E57BE8">in the apo&s;ties times. When the vacancy made in the breach of apo&s;tles, by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ath of Judas, was to be &s;upplied; the vote of the whole vi&s;ible church there pre&s;ent, was taken in the ca&s;e; &s;o that when Matthias was appointed, he is &s;aid to be

<P>THESE now are &s;o many &s;cripture examples, of the exerci&s;e of this right, by the primitive chri&s;|tians.

Dr. Chauncy mentioned a number of

To the&s;e, many more might ea&s;ily be added, from the &s;ame quarter. I &s;hall &s;ubjoin one from Cyprian, bi&s;hop of Car|thage, who flouri&s;hed A.D. 250.
<Q>The people, &s;ays he, have the chief power of <HI>choo&s;ing</HI> worthy mini&s;ters, and refu&s;ing the unworthy.</Q> He adds,

<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Epil. 68.</NOTE> The ingenious
<Q>author of the inquiry into the con&s;ti|tution, &amp;c. of the primitive church,</Q> &s;uppo&s;ed to be Sr. Peter King, afterwards lord chancellor, abundantly proves, from numerous te&s;timonies, that this was the univer&s;al practice of the primitive church, for people to choo&s;e their own mini&s;ters. And indeed, the contrary practice is &s;o repugnant to rea&s;on, to all notions of liberty, and the univer|&s;al cu&s;tom in all other ca&s;es, that, one would think, nothing but the highe&s;t degree of prejudice could reconcile people to it. Do not we e&s;teem it a pri|vilege to choo&s;e our civil rulers, and look upon the people as in a degree of &s;lavery, who are utter|ly deprived of it? Would we &s;ubmit to have others choo&s;e for us a lawyer to defend our property, or a phy&s;ician to take care of our health,&mdash;and oblige us to improve the&s;e and no other? Certainly no. But if we are &s;o tenacious of our natural rights, where our temporal intere&s;t and bodily health only are concerned,&mdash;how much more ought we to be, in things that relate to the health of our &s;ouls, our future and eternal intere&s;t? Surely as much more, as the latter exceeds the former in point of im|portance. No wonder then Mr. L. con&s;idered the want of this, a very important objection again&s;t his favourite church; and though &s;omewhat be&s;ide
<PB N="33" REF="031609_0017_0FED5AA94EEBE688">his &s;ubject, &s;et him&s;elf &s;o zealou&s;ly to remove it. How far he has &s;ucceeded, I leave to the reader. But if he is not able, wholly, to vindicate his own church in this re&s;pect, he &s;eems to think it &s;ome excu&s;e that others, and ours in particular, is in the &s;ame &s;tate. This &s;eems to be his meaning in the&s;e words:
<Q>I believe if the matter be carefully ex|amined, it will be found, that the right of the New-England churches, to choo&s;e their mini&s;|ters, is &s;ounded, not upon &s;cripture, but upon the law of the province, which declares who &s;hall be the patrons, in each pari&s;h to choo&s;e their mini&s;ters. As far as I have been able to under|&s;tand this matter, the law of the province con&s;ti|tutes the heads of the fami&s;ies to choo&s;e,</Q> &amp;c.
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 16.</NOTE></P>
<P>How far Mr. L.
<Q>has been able to under&s;tand this matter,</Q> he mu&s;t know be&s;t. The <HI>defect of</HI> his under&s;tanding, it is not in my power to help. Whether it was for want of <HI>under&s;tanding</HI> or <HI>will,</HI> certain, I am, the account he gives of this affair is not true. According to the law of this colony, (and I &s;uppo&s;e the ca&s;e is much the &s;ame in the re&s;t of New-England, where there is an eccle&s;i|a&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment) the right of choo&s;ing a min|i&s;ter, is declared to be, not in the heads of fami|lies exclu&s;ively; but in them and the members of the church, whether heads of families or not. Be|&s;ides, this right is not founded, as he &s;uppo&s;es, in the law of the colony, any more than the obliga|tion of any divine law, adopted by the civil ma|gi&s;trate. The <HI>obligation</HI> in one ca&s;e, and the <HI>right</HI> in the other, is founded in &s;cripture. The civil law only recognizes the right, and protects peo|ple in the enjoyment and exerci&s;e of it. And all men acquainted with our eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution, know that we are &s;o far from having any thing to do, with what he calls
<Q>patrons, in each pari&s;h,
<PB N="34" REF="031609_0018_0FED5ADD37B85FB0">to choo&s;e the mini&s;ter;</Q> that mo&s;t people know nothing of the term, or what it &s;ignifies, and I hope, by experience, never may. The commu|nicants, and all others of our people, who vote in &s;ociety-meetings for other purpo&s;es, have all free liberty to vote in the choice of a mini&s;ter. And that they may act with di&s;cretion in this im|portant affair; they have opportunity to make tri|al of the candidate while he is upon probation.&mdash; Was it then hone&s;t in Mr. L. to &s;ay,
<Q>In the &s;ame way &s;ocieties, corporations and particular per|&s;ons, become <HI>patrons</HI> in the church of England?</Q> In that church, <HI>patrons,</HI> clerical or &s;ecular, choo&s;e the mini&s;ters for the people. In ours, he is cho|&s;en by the church and people them&s;elves. In the former the bi&s;hop, or &s;ome lay patron, who per|haps never &s;aw the candidate, and is never to fit under his mini&s;try, has the &s;ole power of elect|ing. In the latter, he is elected by the votes of tho&s;e who have made trial of him, are to maintain him, and attend upon his admini&s;trations. In our method, the law acknowledges the natural and &s;criptural right of the people in this important af|fair, and protects them in the enjoyment of it. But in theirs, in defiance of both, their mini&s;ter <HI>is ob|truded</HI> upon them without their con&s;ent. If there|fore, in this view of the ca&s;e,
<Q>that good gen|tleman, (as Mr. L. calls the Dr.) &s;hould real|ly think their church, &s;omewhat culpable in the matter of <HI>patrons;</HI></Q> few people, I pre&s;ume, "would greatly wonder at it," &s;ave he and tho&s;e of his party; and if, as he &s;ays,
<Q>their church appears to him to &s;tand clear of all blame in that matter;</Q> it mu&s;t be owing, I think, to preju|dice and partiality in a very high degree.</P>
<P>I FIND but one thing more, in Mr. L's book, proper for this &s;ection. And that is, the <HI>uncommon</HI> adverti&s;ement tacked to the end of it. I have read it over &s;undry times, but can't be certain I have
<PB N="35" REF="031609_0018_0FED5ADD37B85FB0">hit upon his meaning after all. He talks much about <HI>con&s;equences;</HI> cautions his an&s;werer again&s;t "falling upon <HI>con&s;equences,</HI>" and declares that he "has no concern with <HI>con&s;equences.</HI>" What he intends by them, is difficult to &s;ay. A <HI>con&s;equence</HI> in logic, is an e&s;&s;ential part of every good argu|ment. But he can't mean this by his con&s;equences: For whatever they be, he places them in oppo&s;i|tion to <HI>arguments,</HI> for want of which, in confuting his book, they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be "fallen upon." And yet this or &s;omething like it, mu&s;t be his meaning too; for he warns his antagoni&s;t again&s;t "flying from the &s;ubject," or what he has ad|vanced in "his book" and "falling upon the <HI>con|&s;equences.</HI>" But if this be his meaning, he need give him&s;elf no trouble in the ca&s;e, provided he has only been careful, "to advance" nothing but truth: For truth is ever con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf; and noth|ing but truth will follow from it, or be the <HI>con&s;e|quence</HI> of it, and this can do him no hurt. But if he has not: If he has advanced things in his book, that are not true, or e&s;pou&s;ed principles that can|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot be &s;upported by &s;cripture or rea&s;on, he mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e accountable for the <HI>con&s;equences,</HI> whether he will or no. If, for in&s;tance, he has advanced a &s;cheme of church government, which takes the power of di&s;cipline out of the hands of her proper pa&s;tors, and &s;o robs her of this u&s;eful part of Chri&s;t's in&s;titution: If, according to his principles, the epi&s;copal churches in America, cannot be &s;aid to have the lea&s;t &s;hadow of di&s;cipline: If it nece&s;&s;a|rily follows from his po&s;itions, that it is better to be a papi&s;t than a pre&s;byterian, and an ordination received in the church of Rome, "the mother of harlots" is lawful and valid, while one received in the truly prote&s;tant church of Scotland or Geneva, is <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> nul and void.
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Of the unaccountable partiality of the church of En|gland in favor of Rome, there has not long &s;ince, as I am informed, been a &s;triking in&s;tance in America. Mr. Houdon a Romi&s;h prie&s;t in Canada, took a fancy to a young lady.

<HEAD>SEC. III. <HI>Animadver&s;ions upon</HI> Mr. L's <HI>prelimina|ry Remarks to page</HI> 10.</HEAD>
<P>I FULLY agree with our author;
<Q>That it nearly concerns us to know who are the law|ful mini&s;ters in Chri&s;t's kingdom.</Q> And am well plea&s;ed with the method he has propo&s;ed to de|cide this point, viz. "by an appeal to &s;cripture and rea&s;on."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN the mean time, let us attend to the ob&s;er|vations he thinks proper to make, previous to his entering upon this deci&s;ion. His fir&s;t ob&s;ervation is this,
<Q>The whole body of di&s;&s;enters, (pre&s;by|terians he means) affirm, that bi&s;hop and pre&s;|byter, in &s;cripture, &s;ignify the &s;ame office: Yet they &s;ay, no in&s;tance is to be found there of an ordination, by any per&s;on unde, the name <HI>bi&s;hop:</HI> And if a pre&s;byter is the &s;ame office, then there is none by a pre&s;byter.</Q>
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">ibid.</NOTE> But now, who does not &s;ee the fallacy of this argument? He allows, with us, that bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter in &s;cripture, &s;ignify the &s;ame office; that mini&s;ters were pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly called by both the&s;e names, in go&s;pel times. But then he holds, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of or|dination, &amp;c. ought not to lie in common, to all go&s;pel-mini&s;ters; but to be confined to a particu|lar order, which in their church, are called bi&s;h|ops. We, on the contrary affirm, that as bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter, in &s;cripture, &s;ignify the &s;ame office; the power of ordination belongs in common to all mini&s;ters, and therefore ought not to be confined
<PB N="39" REF="031609_0020_0FED5A804C69EAE0">to &s;ome few, under the title of bi&s;hops. To prove this, we ob&s;erve, that though we have &s;undry ac|counts of ordination, in &s;cripture, performed by mini&s;ters, yet there is no &s;ingle in&s;tance of one &s;o performed by them, under the name <HI>bi&s;hop,</HI> and yet to this, epi&s;copalians appropriate the whole power of ordination. But Mr. L. &s;ays, if this be true, that there is no account in &s;cripture of an ordina|tion performed by any per&s;on under the name bi&s;h|op, then it will follow,&mdash;What? Why "that there is none by a pre&s;byter," that is, no in&s;tance of one performed by a pre&s;byter. But does it at all follow, that becau&s;e the &s;cripture mentions no ordination as performed by mini&s;ters under their one title of bi&s;hops, therefore there is no in&s;tance to be found there of their ordaining under their other title, that of pre&s;byters? Or thus, becau&s;e the &s;cripture never calls mini&s;ters by one of their common names, i. e. bi&s;hops, when acting in ordination; is it a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence that it never calls them by their other common name, pre&s;byters, when act|ing in that bu&s;ine&s;s? Is it not po&s;&s;ible that the &s;ame office in &s;cripture, may be commonly denominated and known by either of the names, bi&s;hop or pre&s;|byter indifferently, and yet only one of the&s;e names, con&s;tantly u&s;ed and applied to him, when acting in the bu&s;ine&s;s of ordination? But now this is what his argument proves, or el&s;e it proves no|thing. The truth is, he has, either ignorantly or de&s;ignedly, altered the terms in his &s;yllogi&s;m, &s;o that his conclu&s;ion contains more in it than his pre|mi&s;es, which all logicians call, fal&s;e rea&s;oning.&mdash; His argument reduced to mode and figure, runs thus, <Q>Bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter in &s;cripture &s;ignify the &s;ame office. No in&s;tance is to be found there of ordination by any per&s;on under the name of bi&s;hop.</Q> This is his major and minor propo&s;ition. His conclu&s;ion is,&mdash;<Q>Therefore there is no in&s;tance of an ordination performed
<PB N="40" REF="031609_0021_0FED5A9422AB5DC0">by a pre&s;byter.</Q> Whereas, had he kept to the terms in his minor propo&s;ition, his conclu&s;ion mu&s;t have been,&mdash;"Therefore there is no in&s;tance of an ordination performed <HI>by any per&s;on under the name pre&s;byter.</HI>" Had he done this, his readers would at once have &s;een the weakne&s;s and fallacy of his argument.</P>
<P>IN England, bi&s;hop, and lord-&s;piritual are &s;y|nonymous terms. Now &s;hould I undertake to prove, that there is no account in the Engli&s;h hi&s;|ory, of an ordination performed by a bi&s;hop, and in order to it, make u&s;e of this argument,&mdash;Bi&s;hop and lord-&s;piritual &s;ignify the &s;ame office: But there is no account in hi&s;tory, of an ordination perform|ed by any per&s;on under the title of lord-&s;piritual; therefore there is no account of one performed by a bi&s;hop; and from hence &s;hould infer, the inva|lidity of epi&s;copal ordination; Mr. L. I pre&s;ume would hardly allow the argument to be good.&mdash; And yet it is the &s;ame he has u&s;ed in this ca&s;e, and full as conclu&s;ive. However, weak as it is, it &s;eems it wrought full conviction in his mind: For he tells us
<Q>he is fully per&s;uaded, at that time in which the &s;criptures were wrote, none had power to ordain mini&s;ters in Chri&s;t's king|dom, but tho&s;e only who <HI>in &s;cripture,</HI> are called <HI>apo&s;tles.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 9.</NOTE> But then what becomes of bi&s;hop Timothy? Mr. L. has &s;pent a con&s;idera|ble part of his book in attempting to prove, the divine right of epi&s;copacy, from the in&s;tance of Timothy bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us. Yea it is the mo&s;t plau&s;ible argument, and indeed the only thing in his piece that de&s;erves the name of an argument. But if
<Q>none had power to ordain mini&s;ters in Chri&s;t's kingdom, but tho&s;e only, who are <HI>in &s;cripture</HI> called <HI>apo&s;tles,</HI></Q> Timothy certainly had no power to ordain, for he is never once called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

Tho' therefore I might now fairly di&s;mi&s;s the controver&s;y, as decided in our &s;avour by his own confe&s;&s;ion: Yet not to take advantage of this incon&s;i&s;tency of his, I &s;hall con|&s;ider the argument when I come to it. In the mean time I intirely agree with him in what follows in this paragraph:
<Q>That the bi&s;hops in the church of England, do not an&s;wer, to tho&s;e that are promi&s;cuou&s;ly called, either bi&s;hops or pre&s;by|ters in &s;cripture.</Q> I add, neither do they, to any order in&s;tituted in &s;cripture. Dioce&s;an bi&s;h|ops, &s;uch as obtain in that church, are &s;o far from being of divine in&s;titution, that they are doubtle&s;s <HI>mere creatures of the &s;tate,</HI> what the go&s;pel knows nothing of.</P>
<P>AND &s;o I am ready to attend upon his next ob&s;ervation, which is this,
<Q>That di&s;&s;enters (pre&s;byterians he &s;hould have &s;aid) are not agreed among them&s;elves about the orders of the mini&s;try,&mdash;&s;ome holding to one order, oth|ers to two, and others again to three, &amp;c.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 9.</NOTE> But what then? &s;hall we mend the matter, in point of unity, or in the lea&s;t better our&s;elves, by going over to the church of England? By no means. Epi&s;copalians are really as much divided in &s;enti|ment in this re&s;pect, as tho&s;e he calls <HI>di&s;&s;enters.</HI>&mdash; Thus &s;ome of them ab&s;olutely deny that any par|ticular form of government or order, is e&s;tabli&s;h|ed in &s;cripture, but the whole is left to the civil magi&s;trate.

<BIBL>Burn. Hi&s;t. Refor. Vol. 1. p. 324.</BIBL></NOTE> This has always been the opinion of the more moderate epi&s;copalians in England; and therefore tho' they conform to the church of England, they do it, not as being of divine in&s;titution, but as e&s;tabli&s;hed by the king and parliament. And others, with Mr. L. and his flighty brethren, a&s;|&s;ert the three orders of bi&s;hops, prie&s;ts and deacons, as of divine appointment: The&s;e plead the ab&s;o|lute nece&s;&s;ity of epi&s;copal ordination, and reject all the prote&s;tant world who are without it. I might add, that there have been other advocates for prelacy, who have pleaded, with equal zeal, for the &s;everal orders of acolyths, lectors, &s;ubdeacons, archdeacons, chirocpi&s;copi, archbi&s;hops, patri|archs, and the Roman hierarchicks, for the pope, as Peter's &s;ucce&s;&s;or, at the head of all.&mdash;<Q>We may &s;ee then, (to u&s;e his own phra&s;e) the que&s;|tion under debate, cannot be decided by the&s;e men; for they are not agreed among them&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P>BUT how does he prove "that di&s;&s;enters are not agreed" in this point? Why he tells us, "&s;ome never ordain their deacons," and the&s;e of cour&s;e
<PB N="43" REF="031609_0022_0FED5AC6082DAC78">"hold, that Chri&s;t has appointed but one order, pre&s;byters." But how does this follow? He him|&s;elf &s;uppo&s;es the bi&s;hop is a different order in their church, and appointed by Chri&s;t. And yet, as far as I can learn, he has properly no new ordination when appointed bi&s;hop, but only what they call a con&s;ecration to the epi&s;copal office. Though therefore &s;ome of our churches &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;ince the civil magi&s;trate now takes care of the poor, which, in times of per&s;ecution, was the deacon's bu&s;ine&s;s, there is no nece&s;&s;ity of a formal ordination to that office; it will by no means in|fer a denial of his being an officer in the church, of diviner appointment. We all, I pre&s;ume, are agreed that the deacon is an officer of divine ap|pointment, (though not in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t, as Mr. L. has it, but by his apo&s;tles:) And that, whether we ordain him or not. He was there|fore quite mi&s;taken in affirming, that we hold to but one order of officers as of divine appointment.</P>
<P>BUT then if &s;ome <HI>di&s;&s;enters</HI> hold to but one, and others to two, there are others again, he tells us, "that hold to three orders of mini&s;ters in the king|dom of Chri&s;t." And for this he quotes Mr. Calvin. But how came Calvin, pray, to be a <HI>di&s;&s;enter?</HI> He was indeed a <HI>di&s;&s;enter</HI> from the church of Rome: And (I hope) &s;o is Mr. L. too. But from the church of England he never was a <HI>di&s;&s;en|ter,</HI> for he never belonged to it. Our epi&s;copa|lians, indeed, warmly contended, in years pa&s;t, that the church of England e&s;tabli&s;hment extends to America, and con&s;equently that all who refu&s;e to conform to it, are <HI>di&s;&s;enters.</HI> But the highe&s;t &s;ticklers for uniformity among them, never, that I know of, pretended to carry the claim to <HI>Geneva,</HI> before Mr. L. It &s;eems his head is &s;o turned again&s;t <HI>di&s;&s;enters,</HI> &s;ince he has renounced our communion, and become a prelate&s;t, that he is ready to fa&s;ten the opprobrious character, upon every one, who happens to differ from him. Be&s;ides, according
<PB N="44" REF="031609_0023_0FED5AB7C97FCEF8">to him, Calvin was no di&s;&s;enters; for he held to the three orders of "bi&s;hops, pre&s;byters, and deacons." I have examined the place in Calvin's in&s;titutions, from whence Mr. L. pretends to make his quotation, and boldly affirm there are no &s;uch words there. The &s;entence truly quoted, is this,
<Q>As we have declared that there are three &s;orts of mini&s;ters commended unto us in &s;crip|ture; &s;o all the mini&s;ters that the old church had, is divided into three orders.</Q> Then fol|lows; not
<Q><HI>bi&s;hops, pre&s;byters</HI> and <HI>deacons,</HI> as add|ed by our author; But the&s;e words: For out of the order of elders, were partly cho&s;en <HI>pa&s;tors and teachers;</HI> the re&s;t of them had the rule of judg|ment, and correction of manners. To the <HI>deacons</HI> was committed the care of the poor, and the di&s;tributing the alms.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Calv. in&s;t. lib. 4. C. 4. &s;ec. 1.</NOTE> This plainly &s;hews what Calvin's judgment was: That be&s;ides pa&s;tors and deacons, there was the office of rul|ing elders, as practi&s;ed in the church of Scotland. But now what is this to bi&s;hops, pre&s;byters and deacons, as quoted by Mr. L.? This is not the only time, he has u&s;ed the freedom with the au|thors he pretends to quote, of making them &s;peak what they never intended.</P>
<P>BUT he tells u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,
<Q>In &s;cripture we find mention made of <HI>apo&s;tles, pre&s;byters,</HI> and <HI>deacons,</HI> and why they &s;hould be &s;o carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed whenever they are mentioned in &s;cripture, if there was not a &s;ubordination in their office, &s;eems very &s;trange.</Q>

Barely the&s;e names being mentioned, or even <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hed</HI> in &s;cripture, will not prove, that they mean different orders in the church, of &s;tanding continuance.

There we are told, "that when Chri&s;t a&s;cended, he gave, not only apo&s;tles and prophets and evangeli&s;ts, but al&s;o pa&s;tors and teachers."

<P>HOWEVER, that there is mention made, in &s;crip|ture, of apo&s;tles, pre&s;byters and deacons, is rea|dily granted. 'Tis further conceded, that pre&s;|byters and deacons, &s;ignify two di&s;tinct offices in the church. Finally, it is allowed, that apo&s;tles are &s;uperior to them both.

<HEAD>SEC. IV. <HI>Dr. Chauncy's &s;ermon vindicated from the exceptions contained in the "de&s;ence of epi&s;copacy,"&mdash;from p.</HI> 11 <HI>to</HI> 24.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I enter upon a vindication of the Dr's &s;ermon, from the exceptions of another, it concerns me to do him ju&s;tice, in one particular, in which I have, inadvertently, mi&s;repre&s;ented him my&s;elf.</P>
<P>IN page 67 of my &s;ermon, I had the&s;e words;
<Q>And although the above learned writer, (mean|ing the Dr.) excepts Ignatius out of the number of the primitive writers in his account, and owns, that the epi&s;tles a&s;cribed to him, <HI>&s;peak very fully in favour of dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy,</HI></Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>WHEN I wrote this &s;entence, I had my mind upon what the Dr. &s;ays, in p. 71 of his &s;ermon: But upon reviewing the pa&s;&s;age, I find, I mi&s;took his meaning. His words are not
<Q>that tho&s;e epi&s;|tles &s;peak very fully in favour of dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy:</Q> But
<Q>that they do, as certainly, as &s;trongly, and as con&s;tantly, <HI>di&s;tingui&s;h bi&s;hops from pre&s;byters,</HI> as any of the writings of the third and fourth centuries.</Q> Now all that the Dr. a&s;&s;erts is, that the&s;e epi&s;tles <HI>point out a di&s;|tinction of order between bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter:</HI> And upon reading what Mr. Boy&s;e has wrote, in his "clear account of the ancient epi&s;copacy," in which he has every thing contained in the&s;e epi&s;|les, relative to the &s;ubject; I am fully convinced, that the bi&s;hop de&s;cribed in the&s;e epi&s;tles, even in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of them, is very different from
<PB N="48" REF="031609_0025_0FED5A856FD06310">the <HI>dioce&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n bi&s;hop.</HI> The Ignatian bi&s;hop, was merely a parochial one, having no more than a &s;ingle congregation for his charge, with pre&s;byters under him: Whereas the dioce&s;an one, has many &s;cores, or hundreds of &s;uch congregations in his cure. The interpolations and adulterations in the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pi&s;tles, were doubtle&s;s made, before the bi&s;hops power was enlarged, &s;o as to comprehend a num|ber of pari&s;hes in his dioce&s;e.&mdash;Having thus cor|rected my own mi&s;take; I proceed to perform the &s;ame friendly office as to Mr. L.</P>
<P>As a direct proof of ordination by pre&s;byters, the Dr. had mentioned, the in&s;tance of Saul and Barnabas being &s;eparated to the work of the min|i&s;try, by certain prophets and teachers, as record|ed, Acts xiii. beginning. As this is &s;o very ex|pre&s;s and circum&s;tantial an account, of a &s;eparation to the work of the mini&s;try; as all the &s;olemn ac|tions, contained in ordination, are here &s;o particu|larly mentioned; and as this is &s;aid to be done, not by apo&s;tles or bi&s;hops, but by the ordinary pa&s;|tors of the church, here called prophets and teach|ers; Mr. L. &s;eems to be at a lo&s;s what reply to make to it. He, at fir&s;t, &s;eems to be doubtful as to the nature of this action; at a lo&s;s what name to give it. "If, &s;ays he, this was an ordination:" "If this was a <HI>real</HI> ordination, then," &amp;c. Fi|nally, he denies it to be an ordination.
<Q>What|ever is meant, &s;ays he, by this de&s;ignation, it was not an ordination.</Q>
<Q>In truth this was not an ordination.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 11.</NOTE> He found him&s;elf &s;o pre&s;&s;ed with this in&s;tance, that he had no way to get rid of the argument, but by flatly denying it to be an ordination. And indeed, this was the only cour&s;e he could take to &s;upport his &s;cheme. For if this be once granted to be a real ordination, the indi&s;putable right of pre&s;byters, to act in this bu&s;ine&s;s, is firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, and all pretences of
<PB N="49" REF="031609_0025_0FED5A856FD06310">confining it to a &s;uperior order, mu&s;t be given up. I &s;hall therefore offer a few ob&s;ervations, to prove that this was, in fact, an ordination; and then make &s;ome remarks upon Mr. L.'s objections a|gain&s;t its being con&s;idered as &s;uch.</P>
<P>Now by ordination, I conclude, is meant, a &s;o|lemn &s;eperation, or &s;etting apart to an office in the church, by &s;uch as have authority to do it, and that, in the u&s;e of tho&s;e rites or actions, the &s;cripture has appointed in this ca&s;e. The &s;crip|ture rites of ordination, are fa&s;ting, prayer, and the impo&s;ition of hands. In this way the &s;even deacons were introduced into office,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts vi. 6.</NOTE> which Mr. L. owns to be an ordination. In the &s;ame way Timothy was ordained.
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 14.</NOTE> And in the &s;ame way he is directed to ordain others.
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. v. 22.</NOTE> And this has been the general method of introducing men into the mini&s;|try, in all &s;ub&s;equent ages. But now, all the&s;e things concurred in the in&s;tance under con&s;ideration. The per&s;ons acting in it, were church officers of Antioch, <HI>"prophets and teachers."</HI> What they undertook to do, was to "<HI>&s;eperate</HI> Saul and Barnabas to the work of the mini&s;try, among the gentiles." This was done by the direction of the holy Gho&s;t;
<Q>&s;eperate me Barnabas and Saul to the work, where unto I have called them;</Q> that is, to the work of the mini&s;try, e&s;pecially among the gentiles,
<Q>to whom they were now &s;ent.</Q> The thing therefore to be done, beyond di&s;pute, was to &s;eperate the&s;e two men to the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try. How this was done, the account informs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">;
<Q>For when they had fa&s;ted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they &s;ent them away.</Q> As every ac|tion, every circum&s;tance pertaining to an ordina|tion, is here &s;o very particularly and expre&s;&s;ly found; if after all, this was not an ordination, I di&s;pair of
<PB N="50" REF="031609_0026_0FED5A8D54D78688">ever finding one, in &s;cripture or any where el&s;e. And what &s;till further confirms the matter, if it needs further confirmation, is, that if I am not much mi&s;taken, the apo&s;tle Paul him&s;elf acknowledges it to be &s;o. In his in&s;cription of his epi&s;tle to the Romans, chap. i. 5.1. he has the&s;e words,
<Q>Paul a &s;ervant of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, called to be an apo&s;tle, <HI>&s;eperated</HI> to the go&s;pel of God.</Q> He here evi|dently de&s;igns to give him&s;elf, his true and prop|er character, of an apo&s;tle, and mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. He therefore particularly mentions, both his <HI>call</HI> to the apo&s;tle&s;hip, and his <HI>&s;eperation</HI> to the go&s;|pel mini&s;try. By the former, he mo&s;t likely means that immediate call from heaven, of which in Acts ix. Then it was he was <HI>called to be an apo&s;|tle.</HI> But we find nothing in &s;cripture an&s;wering to this other part of his character, viz. his <HI>&s;eperation to the go&s;pel of God,</HI> unle&s;s it was this <HI>&s;eperation</HI> we are now con&s;idering. And it is worthy of remark, the word in both places is the &s;ame, both in the origi|nal, and al&s;o in our tran&s;lation. In Acts 13th,
<Q>The holy Gho&s;t &s;aid, APHORISATE, <HI>&s;eperate me Barnabas and Saul to the work whereunto I have called them.</HI></Q> In Rom. i. 1. The apo&s;tle, &s;ays he, "was, APHORISMENOS, <HI>&s;eperated to the go&s;pel of God.</HI>" Does it not appear highly probable, that when the apo&s;tle wrote the&s;e la&s;t mentioned words, he had his mind particularly upon the action we are con&s;idering? I confe&s;s I &s;ee no other &s;en&s;e in which they can be well interpreted. And if &s;o, we have the te&s;timony, even of the apo&s;tle him&s;elf, that this was, in fact, an ordination.</P>
<P>To this Mr. L. objects,
<Q>that if the&s;e proph|ets and teachers were pre&s;byters, &s;o were Barna|bas and Saul. And if this was an ordination, they, who were before pre&s;byters, were ordain|ed to a &s;uperior office; which, he &s;ays, is grant|ing the thing they contend for.</Q> I an&s;wer. Tho' Saul, and po&s;&s;ibly Barnabas too, were in office, as
<PB N="51" REF="031609_0026_0FED5A8D54D78688">apo&s;tles; yet there is no account, that either they or indeed any others, had been formally introduc|ed into office, as &s;tanding mini&s;ters in the church, by the impo&s;ition of hands, till now. They, and the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles, had hitherto, exerci&s;ed their mini&s;try, principally among the Jews. But now, that the go&s;pel was to be &s;ent to the Gentiles, and churches gathered and &s;ettled among them, upon a plan which was to be perpetuated, after the times of in&s;piration were over, even to the end of the world; it &s;eemed good to the Holy Gho&s;t, to order, that they &s;hould be &s;et apart, by the &s;o|lemn rite of ordination, as a &s;tanding pattern for the&s;e future ages. This, as Dr. Chauncy ob&s;erv|ed, was the opinion of a learned epi&s;copal writer, Dr. Lightfoot.
<Q>No better rea&s;on, &s;ays he, can be given of this pre&s;ent action; than that the Lord did hereby, &s;et down a platform of or|daining mini&s;ters, to the church of the Gentiles in former times.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. l. p. 189.</NOTE> This being the ca&s;e, it will by no means follow, that, "if this was an or|dination, they were ordained to a &s;uperior office," as he &s;uppo&s;es. Tho' they were in office before, they had been only "called to be <HI>apo&s;tles;</HI>" where|as now, they were "<HI>&s;eparated</HI> to the go&s;pel of God," by ordination, that &s;o they might, both have a public authentic character, and exhibit a pattern to be followed, in all &s;ucceeding ages. Had Mr. L's head been le&s;s crowded, with the un&s;crip|tural ideas of <HI>&s;uperiority</HI> and inferiority of orders in the mini&s;try, he might have recollected, that even <HI>reordination</HI> it&s;elf, does not nece&s;&s;arily "ad|vance a man to a &s;uperior office in the church." &mdash;He doubtle&s;s knows &s;undry of his brethren in America, who have been twice ordained: Once, "by the hands of the pre&s;bytery," according to &s;cripture pattern, and then again by the bi&s;hop, after they conformed to his church: And yet I
<PB N="52" REF="031609_0027_0FED5AAE4C28D2D0">&s;uppo&s;e, he acknowledges them &s;till, as &s;u&s;taining no higher office, than that of pre&s;byters. Tho' according to his argument, he ought, in all rea&s;on, to look upon them as dignitaries in the church;
<Q>for who, (to u&s;e his own words) ever heard, that a pre&s;byter was ordained, unle&s;s it was, to advance him to a higher &s;tation in the church?</Q></P>
<P>BUT
<Q>In truth, &s;ays he, this was not an ordi|nation, but an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cion of the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> nature with that, Gal. ii. 9. When James, Cephas and John,</Q> &amp;c. It is well, &s;ince he will not allow this to be an ordination, he has at la&s;t found what it is. It &s;eems then, that it was "giving the right hand of fellow&s;hip:" For that is what was done in the in&s;tance to which he compares it. Now giving the right hand of fellow&s;hip, as it is a public declara|tion and &s;ign, that the per&s;on to whom it is given, is now received into a co-partner&s;hip of power and office with the givers, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;up|po&s;e that the per&s;ons giving, are at lea&s;t, equal in power with him who receives it. Con&s;equently if what was now done, was, as he &s;ays, giving the right hand of fellow&s;hip to Barnabas and Saul, it will follow that the&s;e prophets and teachers were at lea&s;t equal in power to Barnabas and Saul. Since therefore, Mr. L. allows the ordaining power to the latter, it mu&s;t equally belong to the former, whether they did in fact exerci&s;e it at this time or no; and then the validity of ordination by pre&s;|byters will of cour&s;e follow.</P>
<P>AGAIN. If the&s;e two actions are, as he &s;ays, both of the &s;ame nature, then it will follow, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the per&s;ons acting in both were of the &s;ame office, or indued with equal power: But tho&s;e who gave the right hand, in Gal. ii. 9. viz. James, Cephas and John, were undoubtedly ve&s;ted with the or|daining power, for they were apo&s;tles: Con&s;e|quently the prophets and teachers, who acted in the other in&s;tance, mu&s;t be ve&s;ted with the &s;ame
<PB N="53" REF="031609_0027_0FED5AAE4C28D2D0">power of ordination too, whether they actually ex|erci&s;ed it at this time or not.</P>
<P>MR. L. has one objection more to this in&s;tance of ordination. It is this,
<Q>Whatever is meant by this de&s;ignation, it was not ordination to im|power Paul,&mdash;for it is beyond all di&s;pute that Paul and Barnabas officiated as public mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t long before this pretended ordination.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 11, 12.</NOTE> An&s;wer&punc; if they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d, it was as apo&s;tles, by virtue of their extraordinary call; not as ordinary min|i&s;ters, in the gentile church, of &s;tanding continu|ance, by the impo&s;ition of hands in ordination. Tho' therefore with re&s;pect to the former, "they were, as he &s;ays, <HI>apo&s;tles, not of men, neither by man;</HI>" yet in the latter &s;en&s;e, they received their de&s;ignation from men, as others now do, by the impo&s;ition of hands in a proper ordination. Their "officiating as public mini&s;ters before," by virtue of their extraordinary call, no more proves that this was not an ordination; than the eleven apo&s;|tles &s;o officiating, by virtue of a temporary mi&s;&s;ion from Chri&s;t in his life time, will prove the commi&s;|&s;ion, he gave them after his re&s;urrection, was no commi&s;&s;ion. Mr. L. allows that the commi&s;&s;ion re|corded in Mat. xxviii. 19. and John xx. 21, was that which authorized the apo&s;tles to act as min|i&s;ters. And yet we know that Chri&s;t ordained the twelve apo&s;tles, and &s;ent them forth to preach, long before he gave them this commi&s;&s;ion.
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Matt. x. Mark. iii. 14.</NOTE> If therefore the eleven apo&s;tles &s;o officiating in Chri&s;t's life time, does not prove the commi&s;&s;ion he gave them after his re&s;urrection, to be no commi&s;&s;ion; neither will Barnabas and Saul's &s;o officiating be|fore this, prove that this was no ordination.</P>
<P>THIS objection indeed the Dr. largely con&s;ider|ed and an&s;wered in his &s;ermon. He there ob&s;erv|ed, that though, "Paul and Barnabas were before this, commi&s;&s;ioned mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t;" yet this
<PB N="54" REF="031609_0028_0FED5AB35B3A90D8">would by no means prove that they did not now receive a proper ordination.
<Q>For the thing in|tended by ordination, is not that the ordainers &s;hould commi&s;&s;ion per&s;ons to do the work of the mini&s;try. This is done by Chri&s;t. It only be|longs to them to declare who the&s;e per&s;ons are, and to &s;eperate them to the work to which Chri&s;t has commi&s;&s;ioned them. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> them mini&s;ters, but being author<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> hereto, give them an authentic character as &s;uch, in the eye of the world, &amp;c. As in the ca&s;e of the mayor of a city, the king's charter of incorporation grants the power; the burge&s;&s;es and the recorder only indigitate the proper recipient of it, and put him legally into the execution of his office.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dud. lec. p. 10, 32, 33. The judicious Hooker, as he is called, &s;ully agrees with Dr. Chauncy in his no|tion of ordination. He defines it, "a &s;olemn admit|tance;" and &s;ays, "the only true and proper act of or|dination is, <HI>to inve&s;t</HI> men with that power which doth make them mini&s;ters, by con&s;ecrating their per&s;ons to God and his &s;ervice in holy things. Such men do hold their authority <HI>from God, (who &s;hould give them commi&s;|&s;ion but he?)</HI> Whether they be &s;uch as him&s;elf immedi|ately, or the church in his name, inve&s;teth."</NOTE> But the Dr. is mi&s;taken, &s;ays Mr. L. in &s;uppo&s;ing that the mayor receives his commi&s;&s;ion from the king. He receives it, he tells us, not from the king, "but from the per&s;ons who give him the corporation oath."
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 15. Eccl pol. 124, 410, 435.</NOTE> In like manner, he argues, mini&s;ters received their commi&s;&s;ion, not from Chri&s;t, but from tho&s;e that ordain them.
<Q>It is true, he &s;ays, that all power in the church of Chri&s;t is originally derived from him. When Chri&s;t was here upon earth, he re&s;erved the power of <HI>making officers,</HI> in his kingdom, to him&s;elf alone: When he was about to a&s;cend to heaven, he told a number of his di&s;ciples, that all power,</Q> &amp;c. That is, if I under&s;tand him, tho' the great head
<PB N="55" REF="031609_0028_0FED5AB35B3A90D8">of the church, while he was upon earth, kept the power of <HI>making officers</HI> in his own hand, yet when he a&s;cended into heaven he delegated this power to his apo&s;tles and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. 'Tis pity Mr. L. had not told us, how much of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> power <HI>of making officers</HI> in the church, is now Bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gared to the bi&s;hops; whether all, or only a part of it; or in what &s;en&s;e it is now in the hands of the bi&s;hops, whether <HI>de&s;potically</HI> or ab&s;olutely, or only <HI>mini&s;te|rially.</HI> If it be only in the latter &s;en&s;e in them, then they are only Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters or in&s;truments in introducing men into office, and inve&s;ting them with the powers of Chri&s;t's commi&s;&s;ion, as the Dr. a&s;&s;erted, and &s;o don't properly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the com|mi&s;&s;ion, but only <HI>indigitate</HI> or point out the recipi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t of it. All therefore they have to do in the ca&s;e, is only to judge of the qualifications of the per&s;ons to be ordained, and give them a &s;olemn admi&s;&s;ion to the exerci&s;e of their office, by fa&s;ting, prayer and the impo&s;ition of hands. The com|mi&s;&s;ion therefore is not from them, but from Chri&s;t. But if this power delegated to the bi&s;hops, be <HI>de&s;|potical,</HI> as Mr. L. mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, or el&s;e what he here &s;ays is nothing to his purpo&s;e: If it be true, as he &s;eems to intimate, that bi&s;hops now, have the &s;ame power of <HI>making officers</HI> in the church, as Chri&s;t had when here upon earth; then it will fol|low, that no mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, &s;ince Chri&s;t's a&s;cention into heaven, can be &s;aid to receive their commi&s;&s;ion or authority from him, but from the ordainers: And therefore in the ca&s;e of a city|mayor; if, as our author a&s;&s;erts, he receives his commi&s;&s;ion, not from the king's charter, but from the recorder, and is therefore not the king's offi|cer, but his who gave him his oath; &s;o in this ca&s;e, if mini&s;ters now, do not receive their com|mi&s;&s;ion from Chri&s;t, but from tho&s;e to whom he has delegated this power of <HI>making officers</HI> in his church, that is, according to Mr. L. the bi&s;hop's;
<PB N="56" REF="031609_0029_0FED5AE5B0FFFDB8">then they are no longer Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters, but the bi&s;hop's who gave them commi&s;&s;ion, and con&s;e|quently they ought to preach, baptize, &amp;c. not in the name of Chri&s;t, but of the bi&s;hop, who&s;e min|i&s;ters they are, and who gave them their authority.</P>
<P>FURTHER, as Chri&s;t <HI>had all power in heaven and earth,</HI> and &s;o was under no limitation as to the ex|erci&s;e of this power in <HI>making officers</HI> in his church, but might, if he had &s;een fit, multiplied the&s;e of|ficers, and, in&s;tead of two, appointed twenty, or two hundred different kinds or orders: So from this principle of Mr. L's, it will follow, that not only the apo&s;tles but their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in office, to whom Chri&s;t has delegated this power of <HI>mak|ing officers,</HI> have the &s;ame unlimited authority al&s;o, in this re&s;pect as he had: That they are not con|fined to any particular number of orders, in the exerci&s;e of this their <HI>office making</HI> power; but may appoint and e&s;tabli&s;h, as many different orders and degrees as they plea&s;e; and in&s;tead of three orders in the church, might have three hundred or three thou&s;and. For Chri&s;t had undoubtedly this power. And indeed this is the &s;en&s;e of the Romi&s;h church upon this point. The pope, in virtue of his being &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Peter, is, according to them, not on|ly infallible, but is ve&s;ted with all the plentitude of the power that Chri&s;t had, in this re&s;pect. And it is by this plentitude of power, with which he is ve&s;ted, not only that he has con&s;tituted that great variety of orders, found among their clergy; but al&s;o rai&s;ed tho&s;e they called bi&s;hops, above pre&s;byters in the church. According to the doc|trine of that church, bi&s;hops are &s;uperior to pre&s;|byters, not by <HI>divine right,</HI> but merely as advanc|ed to this &s;uperior dignity by the plentitude of the pope's power.

<P>THE truth of the ca&s;e is, tho&s;e words, "as my
<PB N="57" REF="031609_0029_0FED5AE5B0FFFDB8">father hath &s;ent me, &s;o &s;end I you," on which our author founds the bi&s;hop's power of <HI>making officers</HI> in the church, have no direct reference to the power of ordination at all. They only imply, that as Chri&s;t received his commi&s;&s;ion immediately from the father; &s;o he did immediately &s;end them to di&s;ciple all nations, and teach them whatever he had commanded. But this by no means implies, that whatever power Chri&s;t had him&s;elf, he inve&s;t|ed his apo&s;tles with, or gave them the &s;ame author|ity and dominion in his church, that belonged to him. His power was <HI>de&s;potical;</HI> theirs only <HI>mini&s;|terial;</HI> and he him&s;elf warned them again&s;t a&s;piring at any more, Mat. xx. 25, &amp;c. He did not there|fore make over to them a <HI>de&s;potical</HI> authority of commi&s;&s;ioning others, but only a <HI>mini&s;terial</HI> au|thority of inve&s;ting &s;uch with the office, his <HI>char|ter</HI> &s;hould authorize and oblige thereto.</P>
<P>HAVING thus vindicated Dr. Chauncy's notion of ordination, from Mr. L's exceptions, I am now prepared to an&s;wer the que&s;tions he has &s;een fit to propo&s;e.&mdash;He a&s;ks, "how the ordainers are to know in the&s;e times, that Chri&s;t has commi&s;&s;ion|ed the&s;e men, as his mini&s;ters, whom they let in|to the mini&s;try?"
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 14.</NOTE>&mdash;I an&s;wer.</P>
<P>As the Dr. no where &s;ays that men are inve&s;ted with Chri&s;t's commi&s;&s;ion, before ordination, as the que&s;tion &s;eems to intimate: He ought rather to a&s;k, "how the ordainers are to know who are proper to be ordained, or ve&s;ted with Chri&s;t's com|mi&s;&s;ion, and declared lawful mini&s;ters?"&mdash;And here the an&s;wer is ea&s;y. They are to know it by the candidate's profe&s;&s;ing an inclination to enter into the mini&s;try, his being upon examination, found qualified for it, and, (in ca&s;e he is to take the charge of a particular church) his being cho&s;en and in|vited by the church to take the pa&s;toral charge of
<PB N="58" REF="031609_0030_0FED5AE1B0E53640">them. All who have the&s;e qualifications and this call, the ordainers may know are &s;uch, as ought to be introduced into office in the church, and as &s;uch may &s;afely ordain them.</P>
<P>AGAIN he a&s;ks,
<Q>What te&s;timony is given to the world, that the per&s;ons he (the Dr.) has or|dained, are the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t?<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 14.</NOTE></Q> An&s;wer. Their public ordination is a &s;ufficient evidence in this ca&s;e. This, the Dr. had told him was the de&s;ign of ordination. Not for the ordainers, pro|perly &s;peaking, to authorize and impower them them&s;elves, but "to declare who the per&s;ons were that Chri&s;t's commi&s;&s;ion has empowered." Not to <HI>make them officers,</HI> as Mr. L. would have it:&mdash; But "to give them an authentic character, as &s;uch, in the eye of the world." And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> this, with us, is done in a very public manner, it mu&s;t be &s;ufficient|ly evident to tho&s;e who attend the &s;olemnity. And as to others, I hope, a certificate from the ordain|ing council properly atte&s;ted, will be deemed as good evidence, in our ca&s;e, as the bi&s;hop's licence and letter of orders are in that of Mr. L. and his brethren. We, no more than they, "expect or de&s;ire people &s;hould believe in this ca&s;e, without evidence." If they can produce &s;ufficient te&s;timo|ny that their mini&s;ters are ordained, we, I pre&s;ume, can ea&s;ily do the &s;ame as to ours, notwith&s;tanding this <HI>fleer</HI> of Mr. L. to prejudice people again&s;t us. "And therefore, to u&s;e his words to the Dr. I hope he will now &s;ee his error and retract it."</P>
<P>THUS I have endeavoured particularly to an&s;wer every objection brought again&s;t this in&s;tance of Paul's and Barnabas's &s;eparation, and, I pre&s;ume, &s;ufficiently proved it to be a real and proper ordi|nation. That it was &s;o, was the declared opinion of Chry&s;o&s;tom, one of the fathers. He a&s;&s;erts that "Paul was ordained at Antioch," and that this is the

But let it be called by what name it will, it is indubitably an expre&s;s and very circum&s;tantial in&s;tance, of per&s;ons being &s;eparated, and &s;ent forth to the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try, which is all the &s;cripture means by or|dination. And as this was confe&s;&s;edly done, not by officers of a &s;uperior character, not by apo&s;tles or bi&s;hops, but by teachers or pre&s;byters, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a proper &s;cripture pattern of pre&s;|byterian ordination, and a proof that &s;uch ordina|tion is valid.</P>
<P>I PROCEED now to con&s;ider what Mr. L. has to &s;ay, upon the other in&s;tance of pre&s;byterian ordi|nation in &s;cripture, as mentioned by the Dr. viz. that of Timothy, 1 Tim. iv. 14.

Nor do I find any material one added by Mr. L. He indeed tells us "the text &s;ays, Timothy was not ordained by
<PB N="60" REF="031609_0031_0FED5AC7B5D831E8">pre&s;byters, but by prophecy."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 18.</NOTE> I an&s;wer:&mdash;It does not &s;ay in &s;o many words, he was <HI>ordained</HI> by either. The word, <HI>ordained,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t being men|tioned. But then, the thing &s;ignifying ordination; the rite univer&s;ally in u&s;e, in &s;etting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en apart to the mini&s;try, viz. <HI>impo&s;ition of hands,</HI> is particular|ly mentioned, and expre&s;&s;ly &s;aid to be performed, not by an apo&s;tle, not by an officer of a &s;uperior character, nor yet by <HI>prophecy;</HI> but by the <HI>pre&s;bytery.</HI> His &s;aying therefore "that Timothy was ordained by <HI>prophecy,</HI>" a phra&s;e to which he, nor no man el&s;e can affix any determinate idea, could be with no other view, than to confu&s;e the minds of his readers, and perplex an argument, which he found him&s;elf unable fairly to an&s;wer.&mdash; Had he attended to what the Dr. had ob&s;erved, concerning the gift, here &s;aid to be given to Ti|mothy, by prophecy, it might have prevented his impo&s;ing upon his readers, and betraying his own ignorance, in the interpretation he has given of this text. At the &s;ame time, it would have &s;aved him the trouble of repeating that other objection, &s;o particularly an&s;wered by the Dr. viz. that Paul was concerned in Timothy's ordination. The word <HI>gift,</HI> here &s;aid "to be given to Timothy by pro|phecy," &amp;c. Mr. L. in&s;i&s;ts, is the &s;ame in the ori|ginal with that mentioned 2 Tim. i. 6, as given by the putting on of Paul's hands. The Dr. al|lows it is. He moreover allows the &s;ame thing to be &s;ignified, in both texts, viz. the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t. And further, that the&s;e were communicated to Timothy by Paul's hands only. For after mentioning the text in que&s;tion, he &s;ays,
<Q>The meaning of the words, compared with what is &s;aid upon the matter in 2 Tim. i. 6, may be fully expre&s;&s;ed in the following para|phra&s;e,</Q>&mdash;<Q>Improve the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t, which I imparted to you, in an extraordinary

The <HI>gift,</HI> in both places, &s;ignifies, the extraordinary HARISMETA or gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t. The&s;e, the Dr. allows were conferred by the impo&s;ition of Paul's hands only, as mentioned in 2 Tim. i. 6. This was gi|ven by <HI>prophecy;</HI> that is, agreeable to, or in con|&s;equence of the prophecies, which the apo&s;tle &s;ays 1 Tim. i. 18, went before concerning Timothy. Holy men prophetically &s;peaking by in&s;piration, of him, as a fit per&s;on to receive this gift, and in con&s;equence, to be put into the mini&s;try; to which &s;ervice he is here, in 1 Tim. iv. 14, &s;aid to be &s;eparated, by the impo&s;ition of the hands of the pre&s;bytery, in ordination. This makes both the accounts, perfectly con&s;i&s;tent, which no other in|terpretation, perhaps, can do. To be &s;ure that given by Mr. L. is very far from doing it. In|deed, as in the forementioned in&s;tance of Paul and Barnabas; &s;o al&s;o in this of Timothy, he &s;eems very loth to allow, that ordination is intended by the impo&s;ition of hands. "If, &s;ays he, this was an ordination." Again. "If this was an ordi|nation, then," &amp;c. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee, in both the&s;e in&s;tances, what were his rea&s;ons for expre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf &s;o doubtfully in the ca&s;e. If the&s;e were al|lowed to be proper ordinations, he was fully &s;en&s;i|ble, all he could &s;ay, would be in&s;ufficient to weak|en the force of the argument, brought from them, in favour of pre&s;byterian ordination. And there|fore he endeavours to per&s;uade his readers, that it is, at lea&s;t doubtful, whether ordination is the thing
<PB N="62" REF="031609_0032_0FED5AC968104190">intended. But as the evidence in the ca&s;e is &s;o full; as every thing included in ordination is more parti|cularly and expre&s;&s;ly mentioned, in the&s;e two in|&s;tances, than in any others recorded in the New-Te&s;tament; and I may add, as there can certainly be found no in&s;tance of an ordination in the whole bible, if the&s;e are not allowed to be &s;uch; Mr. L. &s;eems not quite willing, after all, to hazard the i&s;&s;ue of the controver&s;y, upon a bare denial of this fact: But thinks it concerns him to &s;hew, that if this was an ordination, yet it was not performed by pre&s;byters. And the only argument he brings for the purpo&s;e, is, "that the word <HI>pre&s;bytery,</HI> here, does not &s;ignify a number of <HI>pre&s;byters.</HI> His words are;
<Q>It &s;eems, the Dr. takes it for granted, that a pre&s;bytery means a number of pre&s;byters only. Calling a number of pre&s;byters, a pre&s;bytery, does not prove that St. Paul means the &s;ame, when he u&s;ed the words.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 18.</NOTE></Q> He therefore concludes that "Paul was at the head of the&s;e elders to con|&s;titute them a pre&s;bytery, with power to ordain." If therefore I can prove, that the word PRESBUTE|RION, a <HI>pre&s;bytery,</HI> always &s;ignifies, in the New-Te&s;tament, and other ancient writers, <HI>a number of pre&s;byters only;</HI> then his whole objection again&s;t the Dr's interpretation of the&s;e words, is over|thrown; and this in&s;tance of Timothy's ordination, will remain an inconte&s;tible pattern and proof of pre&s;byterian ordination.</P>
<P>Now the word PRESBUTERION is to be found but in two other places in all the New-Te&s;tament, in both of which it &s;ignifies "a number of pre&s;by|ters only." The fir&s;t is Luke xxii. 66.
<Q>And when it was day PRESBUTERION, <HI>the elders</HI> of the people and the chief prie&s;ts and the &s;cribes came together,</Q> &amp;c. It is very evident the word here means a number of elders or pre&s;byters only: It is &s;o tran&s;lated; the <HI>elders</HI> of the people, the
<PB N="63" REF="031609_0032_0FED5AC968104190">&s;anhedrim or grand council of the Jews: Not including the chief prie&s;ts, the &s;cribes, or indeed any other officer of a &s;uperior rank, as Mr. L. would have it in the other in&s;tance: The&s;e are al&s;o ex|pre&s;&s;ly mentioned, and very particularly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed in the account; the <HI>elders</HI> of the people, PRESBUTERION, and the chief prie&s;ts and the &s;cribes. Be&s;ides, the very per&s;ons who are here called by the collective name PRESBUTERION; in the paral|lel place, Matt. xxvii. 1, are called by the com|mon or appropriate one, PRESBUTEROUS, (which &s;hews the words are u&s;ed &s;ynonimou&s;ly) and they are there al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed from the chief prie&s;ts or any other officers. It is therefore beyond all di&s;pute that the word <HI>pre&s;bytery,</HI> here means a number of elders only.</P>
<P>THE other place, in which the word occurs, is Acts xxii. 5. There it is tran&s;lated, "the &s;tate of the elders," that is, the body or company of pre&s;byters. Here again they are particularly di&s;|tingui&s;hed from the chief prie&s;t, or any other &s;u|perior officer; for he is particularly mentioned, and di&s;tingui&s;hed from the TO PRESBUTERION, the &s;tate or body of elders.
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Here it may be noted, that the pre&s;bytery or elders among the Jews, called PRESBUTERION or SANHEDRION, was their <HI>&s;upreme</HI> court of judicature.

<Q>They were, as a learned writer tells us, origin|ally intru&s;ted with the power of <HI>ordaining</HI> elders to &s;upply the vacancies made in their own body.

<PB N="64" REF="031609_0033_0FED5ABA87A6B1C8">again&s;t whom, I hope Mr. L. will make no ex|ceptions. It is his favourite Ignatus. He fre|quently u&s;es this word; and in him it ever &s;ignifies a number of <HI>pre&s;byters</HI> only. A few in&s;tances may &s;uffice. In his epi&s;tle to the Ephe&s;ians, he &s;ays, "Being &s;ubject to the bi&s;hop, and the <HI>pre&s;bytery."</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Sec. 2.

Not as Mr. L. would have it, "a number of elders with an apo&s;tle or bi&s;hop at their head." Thus it &s;ignifies in &s;cripture, and in all good authors where it occurs. Nor do I remem|ber ever to have &s;een it u&s;ed, in any other &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>DR. CHAUNCY had therefore good right "to take it for granted, that a pre&s;bytery means, a number of pre&s;byters only." And &s;ince this is the word u&s;ed in this in&s;tance, it is a clear con&s;equence, that Timothy was ordained by a number of <HI>pre&s;by|ters;</HI> and therefore that pre&s;byterian ordination, is the true &s;cripture ordination.</P>
<P>NOR will it at all alter the ca&s;e tho' we &s;hould grant that Paul joined with the pre&s;bytery in Ti|mothy's ordination: For if he did, he acted, not as an apo&s;tle, but as a pre&s;byter, of no more au|thority than the re&s;t. For it is in this character only, that the per&s;ons who impo&s;ed hands are here &s;aid to act: Plainly denoting that they acted as a <HI>pre&s;bytery;</HI> and con&s;equently, that the right of or|dination is ve&s;ted in &s;uch a body, and in none el&s;e.</P>
<P>HENCE it will follow, that what Mr. L. &s;ays
<PB N="65" REF="031609_0033_0FED5ABA87A6B1C8">about the lower hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly in Connecticut,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> is not true. It is not true "that a number of pre&s;byters have no more power to ordain without a bi&s;hop, than the lower hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly have, to perform acts of legi&s;lation without the govern|or." So far from it, that <HI>pre&s;byters</HI> and they only are ve&s;ted with the power of ordination; and even when an apo&s;tle was joined with them, if that in|deed was the ca&s;e; he acted, not as an <HI>apo&s;tle,</HI> but as a <HI>pre&s;byter;</HI> therefore the action is expre&s;&s;ly &s;aid to be done by a con&s;i&s;tory of pre&s;byters, as we have &s;hewed above. But if it were not &s;o: If it were true, as he &s;ays, that a number of pre&s;byters have ju&s;t as much and no more authority, with or without a bi&s;hop, than the lower hou&s;e of a&s;&s;em|bly have with or without the governor; &s;till it will be nothing at all to his purpo&s;e. For as the lower hou&s;e, can perform no act of legi&s;lation, without the governor; no more can the governor without them. The power of the latter, in this ca&s;e therefore, is at lea&s;t equal to the former. If then we allow this a parallel ca&s;e, it will indeed follow that pre&s;byters have no power to ordain, without a bi&s;hop: But it will equally follow, that the bi&s;hop has no &s;uch power without the pre&s;by|ters. Con&s;equently their power in this re&s;pect is equal. But, unluckily for our author, this will at once ruin his &s;cheme, agreeable to which the <HI>&s;ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> power of ordination is in the bi&s;hop, and the pre&s;|byters have no manner of authority in the ca&s;e.&mdash; Thus have I very particularly, and I think &s;uffi|ciently vindicated the Dr's interpretation of this text, and proved it to be a &s;tanding pattern and warrant for pre&s;byterian ordination.</P>
<P>MR <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> goes on,&mdash;<Q>Another objection is, that in &s;cripture, bi&s;hops are frequently called pre&s;|byters; therefore bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter mean one and the &s;ame office. In an&s;wer to this I
<PB N="66" REF="031609_0034_0FED5ACD55E4DBC0">would a&s;k, whether apo&s;tle and pre&s;byter mean one and the &s;ame office in &s;cripture? An&s;wer this without a double meaning, and the point is &s;ettled.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 18, 19.</NOTE></Q>&mdash;I an&s;wer. Con&s;idered as &s;tanding officers in the church, they mo&s;t certainly do; and the apo&s;tle Peter him&s;elf &s;hall be my voucher.&mdash; "The <HI>elders,</HI> &s;ays he, which are among you, I exhort, who am al&s;o an <HI>elder.</HI>"<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. v. 1.</NOTE> This then, ac|cording to him, mu&s;t &s;ettle the point.</P>
<P>As another proof of ordination by pre&s;byters, the Dr. ob&s;erved, "that be&s;ides deacons, the &s;crip|ture mentions but one order of officers only, pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly called bi&s;hops or pre&s;byters, therefore that the ordaining power mu&s;t belong to that or|der." In proof of this he added &s;undry texts, and among others, Philip. i. 1, where the apo&s;tle, ad|dre&s;&s;ing this church with its officers, makes men|tion of but two orders, <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>deacons.</HI></P>
<P>IN an&s;wer to this Mr. L. &s;ays, the&s;e bi&s;hops were the pre&s;byters of this church; and that, be|&s;ides them and the deacons, there was an apo&s;tle, viz. Epaphroditus, pre&s;iding over them in quali|ty of <HI>bi&s;hop.</HI> In proof of this he quotes chap. ii. 5, 25, where Paul &s;ays,
<Q>I &s;uppo&s;ed it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end to you, Epaphroditus my brother, &amp;c. but your <HI>me&s;&s;enger.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 19, 20.</NOTE></Q> In the original, he tells us, it is <HI>your apo&s;tle.</HI> Hence he infers, that in this church, were three orders of mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>ANSWER. Epaphroditus being <HI>&s;ent</HI> to Philippi is no proof he was &s;ent there in character of a bi&s;hop. If &s;o then Timothy mu&s;t have been their bi&s;hop al&s;o. For Paul &s;ays, "I tru&s;t in the Lord to <HI>&s;end</HI> Timothy unto you &s;hortly," v. 24. But this would be, to have two bi&s;hops in this one church, which is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the epi&s;|copal &s;cheme; according to which there can be but one bi&s;hop to one church. Neither will his
<PB N="67" REF="031609_0034_0FED5ACD55E4DBC0">being called the Philippian's <HI>me&s;&s;enger,</HI> prove that he was their <HI>bi&s;hop,</HI> or held any office in this church. I grant the word in the original is APOSTOLON, an apo&s;tle. This, however, in its common and un|appropri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ted &s;en&s;e, means not a bi&s;hop, or indeed any church officer; but according to its original derivation, a <HI>me&s;&s;enger,</HI> or one &s;ent. It is accord|ingly &s;o tran&s;lated, wherever it occurs in &s;crip|ture, in its unappropriated &s;en&s;e, ju&s;t as it is in this place. We meet with it in John xiii. 16, and 2 Cor. viii. 23. But as it is u&s;ed in its unappro|priated &s;en&s;e in both, &s;o it is tran&s;lated, as here, not <HI>apo&s;tle</HI> but <HI>me&s;&s;enger:</HI> But if it mu&s;t be render|ed <HI>apo&s;tle</HI> in this place, as Mr. L. contends, it mu&s;t al&s;o in the others, and wherever it occurs. And if this be the ca&s;e, John the bapti&s;t, and tho&s;e who were &s;ent to him from the phari&s;ecs, mu&s;t be al&s;o acknowledged as apo&s;tles or bi&s;hops: For they are called APOSTELLMENOI, apo&s;tles, a word of the &s;ame theme and import with this. And therefore if this word mu&s;t always &s;ignify <HI>apo&s;tle</HI> or bi&s;hop, po&s;&s;ibly Mr. L. will find in &s;cripture, an in&s;tance of a <HI>&s;he-bi&s;hop</HI> or apo&s;tle: For Junia, which by many is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the name of a woman,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Chry&s;o&s;tom, Theophylact, Occumenius, Origen, Hillary the deacon, Pelagius, Prima&s;ius, Bede, Haimo, and Premigius read, not Junia, but Julia believing her to be a woman, as the learned Bloudel a&s;&s;ures us.</NOTE> is &s;aid with Andronicus, "to be chief among the <HI>apo&s;tles.</HI>"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xvi. 7.</NOTE> But the truth of the ca&s;e is: The word APOSTOLON is here u&s;ed in its unappropriated &s;en&s;e. Our Eng|li&s;h bibles therefore rightly have it tran&s;lated, not apo&s;tle, but <HI>me&s;&s;enger</HI> or one &s;ent. For &s;o Epaph|roditus was. He had been <HI>&s;ent</HI> by the Philippians to carry their bounty to Paul, as appears from chap. iv. 18. And therefore the apo&s;tle very pro|perly calls him <HI>their me&s;&s;enger.</HI> Again. Paul's calling Epaphroditus, <HI>your me&s;&s;enger,</HI> plainly &s;hews
<PB N="68" REF="031609_0035_0FED5AE7623B7D20">that he was not an apo&s;tle in the appropriate &s;en&s;e of the word. The apo&s;tles, as &s;uch, are never called apo&s;tles <HI>of the churches,</HI> but of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> who&s;e apo&s;tles or me&s;&s;engers, they are, who gives them commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;ends them forth. Thus Peter and Paul, often call them&s;elves apo&s;tles of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 1. 1 Cor. i. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE> but they are never once called, <HI>your apo&s;tles,</HI> or the me&s;&s;engers of the church.&mdash; Epaphroditus however is called a me&s;&s;enger or apo&s;tle, not of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but of the church: This plainly &s;hews that he was not an officer in that church, but only a <HI>me&s;&s;enger</HI> they had &s;ent, to carry money to Paul. Indeed it looks at lea&s;t high|ly improbable, had he been their <HI>apo&s;tle</HI> or <HI>bi&s;hop,</HI> as Mr. L. pretends, that he &s;hould be &s;ingled out by them for &s;o inferior a piece of &s;ervice, as car|rying their alms to Paul; e&s;pecially, as they had a number of pre&s;byters and deacons, whom they might have improved in this &s;ervice.</P>
<P>FINALLY, had Epaphroditus been the bi&s;hop of this church, is it not &s;trange the apo&s;tle &s;hould not mention him in his in&s;cription of his epi&s;tle to this church? He particularly mentions the <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> or pre&s;byters, and deacons, but &s;ays not a word of any apo&s;tle. This neglect, mo&s;t certainly, Paul would not have been guilty of, had Epaphroditus been their bi&s;hop, as our author pretends. Upon the whole, the&s;e rea&s;ons mu&s;t, I imagine, convince every impartial per&s;on, that he was not the bi&s;hop of Philippi, that there were but only the two or|ders of bi&s;hops or pre&s;byters, and deacons in this church, as the Dr. a&s;&s;erted, and therefore his ar|gument for pre&s;byterian ordination, from this text, &s;tands good.</P>
<P>MR. L's next in&s;tance of three orders, is the church at "Jeru&s;alem. We have clear evidence, he tells us, from &s;cripture, that St. James re&s;ided for twenty years together, with and over the pre&s;|byters
<PB N="69" REF="031609_0035_0FED5AE7623B7D20">and deacons there."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 20, 21.</NOTE> For proof of this he refers to Acts, chapters vi. and xv. chap. xxi. 18, and Gal. i. 19.</P>
<P>Two things, he &s;ays, he has proved from the&s;e texts. One, that the apo&s;tle James re&s;ided for twenty years together in the church at Jeru&s;alem: The other, that he re&s;ided with and <HI>over</HI> the pre&s;|byters and deacons of this church, during that time.&mdash;Let us examine his proofs.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, it does indeed appear from the&s;e texts, that Paul found James at Jeru&s;alem, three &s;everal times, and at the di&s;tance of &s;undry years one from another. But then, at two of the&s;e times, the &s;ame accounts &s;ay, Peter was there with him. And one of them mentions John as there al&s;o. If, then, from the&s;e two accounts it can be proved, that James was at Jeru&s;alem as bi&s;hop, during the term afore&s;aid; the &s;ame mu&s;t follow al&s;o as to Peter. This argument therefore either proves that both of them &s;o re&s;ided, or that neither did. But as they could not, in Mr. L's &s;enfe, be both bi&s;hops of this church, the con&s;equence is plain, that nothing can be concluded from the&s;e two ac|counts, that either of them were. All the proof then that remains as to this fact, is the &s;ingle cir|cum&s;tance of his being found there by Paul, &s;ome years after. Acts xxi. 18. But as there is no ac|count how long he re&s;ided there, barely his being found there, I pre&s;ume, will hardly be admitted a &s;ufficient proof of Mr. L's a&s;&s;ertion, that the time of his continuance was twenty years. Indeed, as James, by our author's conce&s;&s;ion was an apo&s;tle, there is not the lea&s;t degree of probability, much le&s;s any proof, that he re&s;ided at Jeru&s;alem, or any other place, for any con&s;iderable time togeth|er, as his particular charge. So to do would have been utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the apo&s;tolic charac|ter,
<PB N="70" REF="031609_0036_0FED5AF645F52968">and the charge given to the apo&s;tles by Chri&s;t, <HI>"go teach all nations," "go into all the world,</HI> and preach the go&s;pel to <HI>every creature,</HI>" and &s;o preach repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins <HI>among all nations,</HI> beginning at Jeru&s;alem."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxviii. 19. Mark xvi. 15. Luke xxiv. 47.</NOTE> How the executing this large commi&s;&s;ion, could be con&s;i&s;tent with any of the apo&s;tles making Jeru&s;alem their &s;tated re&s;idence, e&s;pecially for twenty years together, as Mr. L. a&s;&s;erts, for my part I am unable to under|&s;tand. Wherefore without offering a word more upon this point, I freely &s;ubmit it to the candid reader to determine, whether the evidence Mr. L. has brought, to prove that James actually "re&s;id|ed twenty years together at Jeru&s;alem, is &s;ufficient to &s;upport the fact." But if it &s;hould be deemed to be, it will by no means follow, that he &s;o re&s;ided in character of a bi&s;hop, or as Mr. L. expre&s;&s;es it, "with and over the pre&s;byters and deacons there." This is the other thing he has here a&s;|&s;erted, and for proof of it, he refers us to what he calls, "James's conduct in the ca&s;e St. Paul laid before him, Acts xv." I de&s;ire the reader to turn to the place, and read the whole account, and then &s;ay, what there is in it to prove that James, any more than any of the re&s;t, that were pre&s;ent at that council, was the bi&s;hop of Jeru&s;alem? Is it that he was at Jeru&s;alem at that time? So was Peter and John, and other apo&s;tles. They there|fore from this circum&s;tance bid as fair for the of|fice as he. Was it that James attended upon the council there? The &s;ame did the other apo&s;tles, yea and the elders and brethren too. Or was it that James gave his judgment, in the determina|tion of the que&s;tion before them? This did all that were pre&s;ent. And therefore when the decree was drawn up and publi&s;hed, it is expre&s;&s;ly &s;aid to go forth in the name. "of the apo&s;tles, and elders
<PB N="71" REF="031609_0036_0FED5AF645F52968">and brethren."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver&s;e 23.</NOTE> Or la&s;tly, was it that James in particular, &s;poke in the council, and declared his &s;entiments concerning the ca&s;e in que&s;tion?&mdash; But the &s;ame did al&s;o &s;undry of the re&s;t, as Peter, Barnabas and Paul. The&s;e are all particularly mentioned as &s;peaking and declaring their opinion upon the point in debate. Yea, as giving the &s;ame <HI>&s;entence</HI> or judgment, that James afterwards declared to be his. What right, I demand, then had Mr. L. to &s;ay, "that James's authority was <HI>deci&s;ive</HI> in the ca&s;e," any more than that of Peter, Paul and Barnabas, who had given the &s;ame &s;en|tence before? Certainly none. Nothing therefore from this circum&s;tance, or indeed from any thing el&s;e, in the account, in favour of James's epi&s;co|pal relation to, and authority over this church, and its officers, but what equally appears in favor of the re&s;t. And &s;ince they could not all be bi&s;h|ops of it, it is a plain ca&s;e that none of them are proved to be &s;o; con&s;equently, that there were not three orders of officers in this church as Mr. L. has a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>HIS next attack upon the Dr. is for a&s;&s;erting, "That the apo&s;tles as &s;uch, were extraordinary officers, and had no &s;ucce&s;&s;ors," and then a&s;ks "in what re&s;pects they were &s;o?"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 21.</NOTE> I an&s;wer.

<PB N="72" REF="031609_0037_0FED5AF130489C68">don't &s;atisfy Mr. L. I would refer him for a more particular account of the di&s;tinctive character and qualifications of the app&s;tle&s;hip, to Mr. Boy&s;e's "ancient epi&s;copacy," p. 253, &amp;c. To Dr. Bar|row as quoted by him, p. 272, &amp;c. and "the &s;crip|ture-bi&s;hop, p. 26, &amp;c. In the mean time, as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion, more particularly to con&s;ider this point, when I come to his remarks upon my &s;ermon, it may be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve here, that Mr. L. does not pretend to prove bi&s;hops now-a-days, are indued with the&s;e extraordinary qualifi|cations, on which the <HI>apo&s;tolic</HI> character and pow|ers were founded; con&s;equently the former cannot &s;ucceed the latter in the exerci&s;e of the&s;e powers. He &s;ays indeed as to &s;ome of the&s;e qualifications, &s;uch as, "the power of working miracles, travel|ling from place to place to plant churches, and be|ing immediately &s;ent by Chri&s;t; that they were not <HI>peculiar</HI> to the apo&s;tles, for others at that time had the &s;ame." But now, what is this to his pur|po&s;e? If they were not <HI>peculiar</HI> to the apo&s;tles, they were at lea&s;t <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to the apo&s;tolic charac|ter and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to furni&s;h men for the duties of it. Tho' therefore &s;ome, cotemporary with the apo&s;tles, might have &s;ome of the&s;e extra|ordinary qualifications, e&s;&s;ental to the apo&s;tolic office; yet as none can pretend to them now; the con&s;equence is undeniable, that none now can pre|tend to &s;ucceed the apo&s;tles, in that part of their character and office, to which the&s;e extraordinary qualifications were e&s;&s;ential and ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary. Since therefore dioce&s;an bi&s;hops do not, cannot &s;ucceed the apo&s;tles, in that part of their character or office which was <HI>extraordinary,</HI> and pe|culiar to them; it belongs to him, if he would &s;up|port his &s;cheme, to prove, that the apo&s;tles, in com|municating their <HI>ordinary</HI> powers, did in fact make a difference; committing a <HI>chief</HI> power to a &s;upe|rior order, called <HI>bi&s;hops,</HI> and an <HI>inferior</HI> one to others, under the name of <HI>pre&s;byters.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="031609_0037_0FED5AF130489C68">
THIS is what he next attempts to do.&mdash;<Q>What we a&s;&s;ert, &s;ays he, is that the apo&s;tles did com|mit a chief power to a &s;uperior order, then called <HI>apo&s;tles.</HI></Q> And for proof he refers us to Acts xiv. 14. Philip ii. 25. 2 Cor. viii. 23.
<Q>From the&s;e texts, he tells us, it appears, that Barnabas, Epaphroditus and Titus are <HI>&s;liled apo&s;ties;</HI></Q> and adds,
<Q>that he intends to prove Timothy al&s;o, to have been inve&s;ted with the &s;ame apo&s;tolic pow|er and office.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 22.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>ANSWER. As to, at lea&s;t three of the four here mentioned, neither the texts he has quoted, nor indeed any other in &s;cripture, proves them to be apo&s;tles, in the <HI>appropriate</HI> &s;en&s;e of the word. As to Epaphroditus, it has been already proved that he was no apo&s;tle, but only a me&s;&s;enger of the church of Philippi, &s;ent to carry their contribution to the apo&s;tle Paul; an errand not over and above apo&s;tolical.&mdash;As to Titus, he is no where, in &s;crip|ture, called an apo&s;tle in any &s;en&s;e whatever. The text Mr. L. quotes to prove him &s;o, is this,
<Q>Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner, and fellow-helper concerning you: Or our brethren be enquired of, <HI>they</HI> are the <HI>me&s;&s;engers</HI> of the churches and the glory of Chri&s;t.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. viii. 23.</NOTE></Q> It &s;eems Mr. L. thought Titus mu&s;t needs be an a|po&s;tle; becau&s;e he found the word, APOSTOLOI, <HI>me&s;&s;engers,</HI> in the &s;ame ver&s;e, in which Titus is na|med. But unhappily for him, it is not Titus, but the <HI>brethren</HI> that went with him, who are called APOSTOLOI, <HI>me&s;&s;engers.</HI> Titus is particularly di&s;|tingui&s;hed from them in the former part of the ver&s;e, as Paul's partner and fellow-labourer, and not of the number of the brethren who are called APOSTOLOI, <HI>me&s;&s;engers,</HI> in the latter part of it. But if he was not: If he was, as Mr. L. &s;uppo&s;es, of the number of the&s;e APOSTOLOI <HI>me&s;&s;engers;</HI> it would
<PB N="74" REF="031609_0038_0FED5AF2E221B390">be nothing to his purpo&s;e: For it is abundantly evident, from the context, that the word APOSTO|LOI is here u&s;ed, not in its appropriate &s;en&s;e, to &s;ignify an officer in the church; but in the com|mon and unappropriated one, meaning barely a <HI>me&s;&s;enger,</HI> or one &s;ent. For it is evidently on ac|count of their being <HI>&s;ent</HI> to Corinth to receive their collections, and carry them to Jeru&s;alem, and nothing el&s;e, that the&s;e per&s;ons are called APOS|TOLOI, me&s;&s;engers of the churches. If therefore Epaphroditus was no <HI>apo&s;tle,</HI> much le&s;s was Titus, who is never once called by that name, in any &s;en&s;e of the word what&s;oever. And tho' Mr. L. tells us "he de&s;igned to prove Timothy to be one;" yet as we find nothing of that kind done in the re|maining part of his book; 'tis probable, upon &s;e|cond thought, he was di&s;couraged in the attempt. Since therefore he has dropt him out of the num|ber, we have a right to do the &s;ame, and &s;o there remains only Barnabas to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>AND, it is readily granted he is called an apo&s;tle in Acts xiv. 14. But until it is proved that he <HI>derived</HI> his apo&s;tolic power from the apo&s;tles; barely his being called an apo&s;tle, will not prove his a&s;&s;ertion,
<Q>that the apo&s;tles did communicate a chief power to a &s;uperior order called apo&s;tles.</Q> All that is proved from this text, is that "Barnabas was an a|po&s;tle." How he came to be &s;o, or from whom he <HI>received</HI> his "chief power" and &s;uperior character as an apo&s;tle, the text is intirely &s;ilent; nor can it be collected from any thing Mr. L. has &s;aid. If his being here mentioned with Paul, &s;ignifies that he was ve&s;ted with the &s;ame &s;uperior office and character as Paul was; no doubt he received his apo&s;tolic commi&s;&s;ion and authority, in the &s;ame immediate way, and from the &s;ame fountain, as Paul did. How that was, he him&s;elf has told us. For he was
<Q>an apo&s;tle, not of men, neither by
<PB N="75" REF="031609_0038_0FED5AF2E221B390">man, but by Je&s;us Chri&s;t and God the father</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. i. 1.</NOTE> At lea&s;t till the contrary is proved from &s;cripture, we have a right to conclude this was the ca&s;e: Con&s;equently, that the apo&s;tles did not
<Q>thus di|vide the ordinary powers of their office, commu|nicating to &s;ome more, to others le&s;s, and &s;o con&s;tituting the two orders of bi&s;hops and pre&s;|byters,</Q> as our opponents pretend. I may there|fore now with propriety, I pre&s;ume, take leave of this argument in the words of Dr. Chauncy.
<Q>If the apo&s;tles did thus communicate the&s;e powers, in a different degree, committing to &s;ome more, to others le&s;s, and &s;o con&s;tituting two orders in the mini&s;try; it is what we may rea&s;onably ex|pect to &s;ee evidenced. The new-te&s;tament is open. If it contains any &s;uch evidence, let it be produced. We imagine it contains clear evi|dence to the contrary, and that we have given &s;uch evidence. Merely calling bi&s;hops &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors to the apo&s;tles will not prove their &s;uperiori|ty: Tho' by the way they are never called &s;o in the &s;acred books.&mdash;The bible only can &s;ettle this point.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Dud. lec. p. 49, 50.</NOTE></Q></P>

If by <HI>epi&s;copacy</HI> Mr. L. means <HI>dioce&s;an</HI> epi&s;copacy, (which he mu&s;t mean, or it is noth|ing to his purpo&s;e) the Doctor is &s;o far from al|lowing that the church was ever governed in that form, that on the contrary he affirms and proves, that during the fir&s;t century, and the greate&s;t part of the &s;econd, there is no di&s;tinction to be found,

<P>FOR an&s;wer to which, and indeed, to almo&s;t eve|ry thing el&s;e he has remarked upon the Dr's &s;er|mon, I might very fairly refer him to the &s;ermon it&s;elf. At lea&s;t he will there &s;ee, that when this alteration of a di&s;tinction between bi&s;hop and pre&s;|byter fir&s;t began, it was very &s;mall. "The bi&s;hop was no more than <HI>primus inter pares,</HI> the head pre&s;|byter, the <HI>prae&s;es</HI> or moderator of the con&s;i&s;tory; and it was by gradual &s;teps he attained to the power with which he was afterwards ve&s;ted. The&s;e ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical &s;uperiorities and inferiorities, which have for a long time been vi&s;ible in the chri&s;tian world, were unknown in the fir&s;t and pure&s;t ages: Nor did they at once take place.

<P>IF this an&s;wer will not &s;atisfy Mr. L. I will give him another, in the words of a prote&s;tant in an&s;wer to a demand of the like kind from a papi&s;t. It is as follows.
<Q>When Arius, Ne&s;torius, and &s;uch like heretics aro&s;e; they violently broke out of the church, and for&s;ook all communion. And when Mahomet came from without, he vi&s;ibly a&s;&s;aulted all chri&s;tianity. But the <HI>papacy</HI> bred &s;ilently, as a gangrene in the church within. That cockatrice was long a hatching in the &s;hell, before it did appear.

The one is ea&s;y to be known, becau&s;e it works openly, in the day: The other hard to be di&s;covered, becau&s;e it makes its approaches only in the night.</Q> Let Mr. L. only make the &s;mall charge of the word <HI>papacy</HI> into <HI>prelacy,</HI> and the an&s;wer will be exactly adapted to his que&s;tion.</P>

<P>I HAVE &s;ometimes heard it remarked, indeed, as a fort of incon&s;i&s;tency in the church of England, to di&s;cover &s;uch a partial affection to that of Rome, as to allow of their orders as valid while they de|ny tho&s;e of all prote&s;tant churches; and boa&s;t &s;o much of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion through that church, which in their homilies they call "a filthy old withered harlot, and &s;o far from being of the nature of a true church, that for more than nine hundred years before the reformation, nothing could be more." This, however, Mr. L. denies. They did not, he &s;ays, derive either their power, or chri&s;tiamity from Rome. "The Briti&s;h church flouri&s;hed, he tells us, many hundred years&mdash;before the go&s;pel took place in England." I an&s;wer:&mdash;That chri&s;|tianity was early introduced into England, is not denied. Who fir&s;t preached it there, is very un|certain. 'Tis &s;till more &s;o in what form, whether pre&s;byterian or epi&s;copalian, that church was fir&s;t &s;ettled. If Paul was the fir&s;t who brought the go&s;pel to Britain and planted chri&s;tianity there, as many writers &s;ay; it is pre&s;umed, that &s;ince he him&s;elf was ordained by pre&s;byters, that was the form of ordination and government he would e&s;|tabli&s;h there. As to king Lucius, whom Mr. L. makes to be the fir&s;t chri&s;tian king, and the found|er of an arch-bi&s;hoprick in London; the time of his conver&s;ion is &s;o uncertain, that Fuller, in his church hi&s;tory, reckons up no le&s;s than twenty|&s;ix different accounts of it by different writers; be|tween the fir&s;t and la&s;t of which, there is no le&s;s

<P>IT is well known, by all acquainted with the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, that Au&s;tin the monk came into England toward the latter end of the &s;ixth centu|ry.

All equally &s;unk in error, &s;uper&s;tition, and idolatry, and equally "drunk with the cup of abominations, and filthi|ne&s;s of the fornications, of that old withered har|lot." Where then, I a&s;k, will Mr. L. find a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion for their clergy, except through the bi&s;hops of the Romi&s;h church? His attempts to derive it through a line of "ancient Briti&s;h bi&s;hops," is a mere chimera, that &s;carce de&s;erves notice. There were no &s;uch bi&s;hops to be found in England, during the greate&s;t part of that time. I readily allow that chri&s;tianity had been planted in England, before Au&s;tin's arrival; that upon the Saxon inva|&s;ion, a number of the Briti&s;h chri&s;tians retired in|to the mountains of Wales, and pre&s;erved their liberty and chri&s;tianity. It is further granted, that upon Au&s;tin's coming into England, the old Bri|ti&s;h clergy in Wales, refu&s;ed at fir&s;t to &s;ubmit to the Pope's authority. In con&s;equence of which the greate&s;t part of them were cruelly put to the &s;word, in the city of Bangor, &s;aid to be effected by Au&s;tin's means.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Full. ch.

If the&s;e Welch bi&s;hops therefore, were tho&s;e Mr. L. means by his "ancient Briti&s;h bi&s;hops" from whom their clergy derive their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and who he tells us "as far as po&s;&s;ible, prevented all that came from Rome from getting into the vacant churches;" the oppo&s;ition they made, could be but very feeble at be&s;t, and mu&s;t certainly have
<PB N="82" REF="031609_0042_0FED5ABC355657B8">cea&s;ed, after the greate&s;t part of them were cut off. And as to the remainder of them we are a&s;|&s;ured from hi&s;tory, that they &s;oon after &s;ubmitted to the church of Rome: "For Laurentius, who &s;ucceeded Au&s;tin, as arch-bi&s;hop of Canterbury, by demeaning him&s;elf more humbly, that his pre|dece&s;&s;or had done, reduced the re&s;cuent Britons to &s;ome tolerable conformity to the Romi&s;h ceremo|nies."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ful. ch.

D. 1279, near three hundred years before the reformation, "John Peckham, arch-bi&s;hop of Canterbury, ac|tually excommunicated their prince, becau&s;e he could not prevail upon him to be at peace with England."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">id.

What then can Mr. L. mean, by pretending to keep up a di&s;tinction between the Briti&s;h clergy, and tho&s;e of the Romi&s;h church? Wales, for many hundred years before the refor|mation, was as really under the "papal yoke," as he terms it, and received their bi&s;hops "from Rome" as much as any other part of the kingdom.</P>
<P>BUT if this had not been the ca&s;e: Had it been, as his argument &s;uppo&s;es, that there was a di&s;tinct &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of bi&s;hops kept up in Wales, in a direct line from the ancient Briti&s;h bi&s;hops, even till the reformation; this will afford him no manner of re|lief as to the pre&s;ent clergy of their church. They, certainly, can claim no benefit from &s;uch a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of Welch bi&s;hops; for not one of the
<PB N="83" REF="031609_0042_0FED5ABC355657B8">Welch bi&s;hops was concerned in the con&s;ecration of Parker, and yet from him all the bi&s;hops in the church of England ever &s;ince mu&s;t derive their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The fact was truly this. In the be|ginning of the reformation under Henry VIII. all the bi&s;hops, abbots and priors in England, (Fi&s;her bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter only excepted) complied with it, as far as it was then carried.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burn. eccl. hi&s;t. abridg. vol 1, page 106.</NOTE> This therefore, could not be the time Mr. L. &s;peaks of, "when all that were ordained at Rome, refu&s;ed to com|ply with the reformation, and returned to Rome from whence they came." For at this time none returned to Rome; and but one in the whole king|dom, refu&s;ed to comply with the changes that were made. By the reformation, therefore, he mu&s;t mean, the revival of it in Queen Elizabeth's reign. Then indeed, all the bi&s;hops in the kingdom, ex|cept Kitchen of Landaff, refu&s;ed to comply with it and were turned out. None of them, however, "returned to Rome, as he a&s;&s;erts, &s;ave one only, and but three left the kingdom, viz. Pates, bi&s;hop of Worche&s;ter, Scot of Che&s;ter, and Goldwell of St. A&s;aph.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">id. vol. 2, p. 332. Ful. ch. hi&s;t. B. 8, p. 58.</NOTE> This is con&s;iderably &s;hort of the number <HI>fourteen,</HI> mentioned by Mr. L. Now this being the ca&s;e, that all the bi&s;hops in the king|dom, not only of England, but Wales too, except one, were deprived; where will he go to make out a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion for their clergy, from the old Briti&s;h bi&s;hops? They were all, &s;ave one, deprived, and a new &s;ucce&s;&s;ion begun in Parker, from whom all the bi&s;hops ever &s;ince, mu&s;t derive their claim. Unle&s;s therefore, he can prove, that Parker was con&s;ecrated by the de&s;cendants of tho&s;e "ancient Briti&s;h bi&s;hops," his pretended &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from them, is inevitably overthrown. But to the utter de&s;truction of his &s;cheme, &s;o it happened, that Parker, (from-whom all the clergy of the church
<PB N="84" REF="031609_0043_0FED5AEAC65863C0">of England, both bi&s;hops and pre&s;byters, ever &s;ince, derive their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion) was con&s;ecrated, not by any of the bi&s;hops of Wales, but by four Eng|li&s;h bi&s;hops, who had been con&s;ecrated in king Edward's time, had been deprived in the reign of Queen Mary, and had never been re&s;tored. For the men who con&s;ecrated Parker, were Barlow, formerly bi&s;hop of Bath and Wells, Scory of Chi|che&s;ter, Coverdale of Exeter, and Hodg&s;kins fu&s;|fragan of Bedford.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ful. ch. hi&s;t. B. 9, page 60.</NOTE> But none of the&s;e had been bi&s;hops of Wales. It is true the writ of Parker's con&s;ecration, named Kitchen of Landaff for one. But it is equally true that he never appeared to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the con&s;ecration, and &s;o it was performed without him by the four above named. Where then, I repeat it, will Mr. L. make out his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, through the line of the old Briti&s;h bi&s;hops? If he was &s;o unacquainted with hi&s;tory, as not to know that there was no manner of foundation for &s;uch a pretence, he was unqualified to write upon the &s;ubject, and ought not to have meddled with it. If not, he has de&s;ignedly impo&s;ed upon his readers, and ought "to retract."</P>
<P>THE truth of the ca&s;e is, no hi&s;tory of the Briti&s;h church furni&s;hes the lea&s;t foundation, even of pre|tence, for &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Bi&s;hop Burnet &s;ays, that the reformers in England, expre&s;&s;ly allowed "that England received the faith from tho&s;e &s;ent from Rome by pope Gregory the great, i. e.

Mr. Beach in particular, &s;ome years ago, in his controver&s;y with Mr. Hobart, &s;ays, "the pre&s;ent arch-bi&s;hop of Canterbury is the &s;eventy-third, who has fet in that &s;ee, &s;ince Au&s;tin the monk."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Vind. page 7.</NOTE>
<PB N="85" REF="031609_0043_0FED5AEAC65863C0">And tho' I don't imagine there is any great prob|ability of an unbroken &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, even in that line, yet it mu&s;t be &s;ought there, or no where.

<P>I CALL this notion of an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of it to render go&s;pel ad|mini&s;tration valid, a <HI>vi&s;ionary enthu&s;ia&s;tic</HI> &s;cheme.

The evi|dence of the fact is &s;o &s;mall, and the probability, or rather evidence of an interruption, &s;o great, that a man mu&s;t renounce the common principles of credibility, and act by an implicit faith, to give in to it, or at lea&s;t to lay any great weight upon it. But to be very confident of it, and that in a line where it is ab&s;olutely certain it is not to be found, argues, if po&s;&s;ible, a greater degree of weakne&s;s and credulity than what the mo&s;t vi&s;ionary enthu&s;ia&s;ts are influenced by. And is not this even the ca&s;e with our author? For though he di&s;claims a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion through the Romi&s;h church and lays the whole &s;tre&s;s upon one thro' the old Briti&s;h bi&s;hops, which never had any exi&s;tence, &s;ave in a heated imagination, he is &s;o confident of the truth of it, that he tells us, "we have as good evidence that their clergy derive their authority, by an uninter|rupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from the apo&s;tles, (meaning thro' the line afore&s;aid) as we have of the de&s;cent of all mankind from Adam by ordinary generation."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 26.</NOTE> The highe&s;t evidence to which, even Mr. Beach, pretended in this ca&s;e, and that in a line too, which bid much fairer, than the romantic one of our author, was only to put it upon a level, with that of the Levitical prie&s;thood in the family of Aaron.

If the faith of the advocates of this doctrine, continues thus increa&s;ing, we may expect it will &s;oon grow up to full a&s;&s;urance; and that the next &s;tickler for uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, will put the evidence of it upon a par with that of our exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>LET us however, examine Mr. L's proof: And here let it be noted, that we have the mo&s;t clear and expre&s;s &s;criptural evidence of our natural de|&s;cent from Adam, and therefore are ab&s;olutely cer|tain of it.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See Gen. i. 27, &amp; ii. 22. Mal. ii. 15.10. Acts xvii. 26.</NOTE> The &s;ame he tells us, we have for the uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of their clergy from the apo&s;tles. Let it be al&s;o remembered, that this &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion mu&s;t be in a line of bi&s;hops as &s;uperior to pre&s;by|ters, for he calls it "a regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the <HI>epi&s;co|pal power,</HI>" "an apo&s;tolic &s;ucce&s;&s;ion," and "a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of the go&s;pel mini&s;try in the three orders." Barely a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the line of <HI>pre&s;byters</HI> will not &s;uffice. For we have &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion up to their bi&s;hops, and yet he denies us to be the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t. Now the argument by which he under|takes to prove his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, is this. Chri&s;t's promi&s;e to his mini&s;ters, contained in his commi&s;|&s;ion, in Mat. xviii. 20, mu&s;t have failed unle&s;s there has been &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as he pleads for, that is, in a direct line of bi&s;hops as a &s;uperior order in the church. But why mu&s;t the promi&s;e have failed, unle&s;s there has been <HI>&s;uch</HI> a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion? There is nothing in the commi&s;&s;ion, limiting the promi&s;e to &s;uch a &s;uperior order: Not the lea&s;t hint of the in&s;titution of &s;uch an order. The com|mi&s;&s;ion is but one, and therefore one order only is in&s;tituted by it. But if there were two, or ten, it would make no alteration: Since the promi&s;e is not limitted to any one in particular, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in either of them would an&s;wer all the ends of fulfill|ing

<P>THE truth is, as the commi&s;&s;ion &s;uppo&s;es but one order in the mini&s;try, the utmo&s;t that can be argued from the annexed promi&s;e, in favour of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, even of any kind, is that there &s;hall be a <HI>mini&s;try</HI> continued in the church, to the end of time. How, or in what manner mini&s;ters &s;hall be introduced, whether in a regular unbroken fine of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion or not, whether by a &s;uperior or inferior order of mini&s;ters, yea whether by the officers of the church or the brethren, as the commi&s;&s;ion is wholly &s;ilent upon this head, &s;o nothing relative thereto can be concluded from it. And although from other texts it appears, that it belongs, not to the private brethren, but to mini&s;ters to ordain; yet for aught appearing in the commi&s;&s;ion it&s;elf, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of mini&s;ters, even by lay ordination, would have as effectually &s;ecured the accompli&s;h|ment of the promi&s;e, as one by pre&s;byters, yea or bi&s;hops them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THUS his bold a&s;&s;ertion "that we have the &s;ame evidence for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion he pleads for, as we have for our de&s;cent from Adam, finally comes to this." For one we have the certain, indubitable, repeated, expre&s;s te&s;timony of infallible &s;cripture, which is evidence of the highe&s;t kind.

This argument for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, is the univer&s;al acknow|ledgment of the church, that there has, in fact, been &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Now the fact here a&s;&s;ert|ed, is either true, or it is not true. If it is not true in fact, that there has been any &s;uch univer&s;al acknowledgment, in favour of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which is doubtle&s;s the ca&s;e; then his argument founded upon &s;uch acknowledgment is at once de&s;troyed. But if it is true, his argument founded upon it, is inconclu&s;ive; for if it proves the point in que&s;tion, it will equally prove other things, which even Mr. L. him&s;elf will not admit as truths.
<Q>The &s;um of the argument, he tells us, is this: Chri&s;t, at fir&s;t, did appoint a certain number of men with power to &s;end others: The church univer|&s;al never could be induced to receive officers, unle&s;s they were ordained by &s;uch officers, as Chri&s;t appointed to ordain; therefore there has been a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;uch officers, as Chri&s;t ap|pointed at fir&s;t, which are apo&s;tles, or, as they have been &s;ince called, bi&s;hops. This evidence for the apo&s;tolic &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, he &s;ays, is fully &s;uf|ficient to &s;atisfy a rational enquiry, whatever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> may be to &s;ilence the &s;pirit of party.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 27.</NOTE> No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> if this argument proves an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of bi&s;hops as &s;uperior to pre&s;byters, it will equally prove the Pope's &s;upremacy, together with other doctrines equally ab&s;urd. Let us try it in an in|&s;tance or two of this kind, and &s;ee how it will run.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="031609_0045_0FED5A9271480EF0">
CHRIST did at fir&s;t &s;ay unto Peter, "unto thee I commit the keys of the kingdom," &amp;c. "The church univer&s;al never could be induced to &s;ubmit to an authority Chri&s;t had not in&s;tituted;" but the church univer&s;al, for many hundred years, did in fact &s;ubmit to the pope, as Peter's &s;ucce&s;&s;or and the vicar of Chri&s;t; therefore the pope's &s;upre|macy, &amp;c. is of divine in&s;titution. Or thus:&mdash; Chri&s;t did at fir&s;t appoint the &s;acrament of his &s;upper, to be admini&s;tered to the proper &s;ubjects of it: The church univer&s;al never could be in|duced to depart from Chri&s;t's appointment, in this re&s;pect: But the church univer&s;al did in fact, for a long time practice giving the &s;acrament to in|fants; therefore this practice was no departure from Chri&s;t's in&s;titution. Whether this "evidence will be &s;ufficient to &s;ilence the &s;pirit of party," in any who &s;hould happen to di&s;pute the pretended au|thority of his holine&s;s, the pope, or the lawfulne&s;s of giving the &s;acrament to infants, I will not take upon me, ab&s;olutely, to determine. Sure I am, however, it is the &s;ame evidence he has brought, in &s;upport of his apo&s;tolic &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, "and as fully &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy a rational enquiry."</P>
<P>I HAVE been thus long upon the point of a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, not that the defence of the &s;ermons I am vindicating, is concerned in it; for neither of them &s;ay any thing about it. Nor would I be under|&s;tood, ab&s;olutely to deny, that there has been a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the chri&s;tian mini&s;try. I rather in|cline to think there has; though not &s;uch an one as Mr. L. contends for, in a line of bi&s;hops &s;upe|rior to pre&s;byters. Of this there is &s;carcely the lea&s;t probability. But my motive herein was, to expo&s;e the weakne&s;s of &s;uch high claims, and the dangerous tendency of laying &s;o much weight upon this &s;ame epi&s;copal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as the zealous ad|vocates for it commonly do. As to the weakne&s;s
<PB N="90" REF="031609_0046_0FED5A96E242D408">of the proof, I pre&s;ume it has been &s;ufficiently ex|po&s;ed. The danger of laying &s;o much &s;tre&s;s up|on it, mu&s;t be obvious at fir&s;t view. It naturally tends to fill the minds of &s;erious chri&s;tians, with perplexing doubts and &s;ears, as to the validity and efficacy of the go&s;pel admini&s;trations, on which they attend; and utterly deprive them of the com|fort and edification they might otherwi&s;e hope to receive from them. At the &s;ame time, it gives a handle to dei&s;ts and infidels, to banter and ridicule the mo&s;t important truths of chri&s;tianity, while they thus behold them, and that even by its <HI>teach|ers,</HI> &s;unk to a level, in point of evidence, with the mo&s;t doubtful and di&s;putable points.</P>

However, &s;ince he choo&s;es to com|bat only this one argument, I &s;hall follow him in his remarks upon it. His words are,
<Q>Mr. Welles &s;ays, page 17, the&s;e la&s;t words (meaning the promi&s;e annexed to the commi&s;&s;ion) plainly &s;hew that this promi&s;e was made, not to the per&s;ons of the apo&s;tles, but to their office as mini&s;ters in Chri&s;t's church; and con&s;equently that their office is to continue to the end of the world.&mdash; He a&s;&s;erts, page 16, this is the commi&s;&s;ion, and the only commi&s;&s;ion we have any account of,&mdash;which Chri&s;t gave to his apo&s;tles.</Q> The con|&s;equence of which Mr. E. &s;ays, mu&s;t be this,&mdash; "that the commi&s;&s;ion con&s;tituted them <HI>apo&s;tles,</HI> and therefore the <HI>apo&s;tolic office</HI> mu&s;t continue to the end of time."
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 28.</NOTE></P>
<P>ANSWER.&mdash;If by <HI>apo&s;tolic office,</HI> he means the office the apo&s;tles &s;u&s;tained, as ordinary mini&s;ters in the church; I readily grant that the commi&s;&s;ion in Mat. xxviii. did con&s;titute them apo&s;tles, and that their office, in this &s;en&s;e of it, is to continue to the end of the world. But if by <HI>apo&s;tolic office,</HI> he means their office as <HI>apo&s;tles,</HI> properly &s;o call|ed, con&s;idered in their extraordinary character, I deny that it was to be continued, and affirm there is nothing in the words he pretends to quote from me, that will infer &s;uch a conclu&s;ion. 'Tis true I &s;aid, and &s;till &s;ay, "that the promi&s;e of Chri&s;t's pre&s;ence to the end of the world, annexed to the
<PB N="94" REF="031609_0048_0FED5ADB89EA4CB0">commi&s;&s;ion, was made, not to the <HI>per&s;ons</HI> of the apo&s;tles, but to their <HI>office.</HI>" But as what? Not as apo&s;tles, but as I there expre&s;s it, "as mini&s;ters in Chri&s;t's church," i e. &s;tanding ordinary mini&s;|ters. I al&s;o &s;aid, "that is the commi&s;&s;ion, and the only one, we have any account of, that Chri&s;t gave his apo&s;tles." But then I added, "in virtue of which they were impowered to act <HI>as mini&s;ters in his church,</HI>" i. e. as ordinary &s;tanding mini&s;ters, as the whole connexion of my di&s;cour&s;e &s;hewed. Had Mr. L. thus quoted my words at large, every reader would have &s;een the weakne&s;s of the con|clu&s;ion he pretends to draw from them. They are &s;o far from giving any countenance to his notion of, "a continuation of the <HI>apo&s;tolic office</HI> as &s;uch; that on the contrary, they very expre&s;&s;ly di&s;tin|gui&s;h between <HI>this,</HI> and their ordinary character, and very clearly &s;hew, that it was the latter, and not the former, that was to be perpetuated, and in which they were to have &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to the end of time. This, I pre&s;ume, is &s;ufficient to vindi|cate my words from this con&s;equence he pretends to draw from them.</P>
<P>BUT, &s;ays Mr. L. "the con&s;equence (meaning from my words) is plainly this; that the commi&s;|&s;ion con&s;tituted them apo&s;tles, or el&s;e that they acted as apo&s;tles without any commi&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>I ANSWER:&mdash;This is by no means a plain con|&s;equence neither. Had I &s;aid, as he has imper|fectly quoted me, "that this is the only commi&s;|&s;ion we have any account of, that Chri&s;t gave his apo&s;tles," and had added nothing further, it would indeed have followed, not as he &s;ays, "that they acted without any commi&s;&s;ion;" but that, for aught appeared in &s;cripture, they acted without any. The&s;e two conclu&s;ions are very different.&mdash; The &s;cripture gives no account of the ordination of Silas, Apollos, Epaphroditus, &amp;c. I tru&s;t, how|ever, he him&s;elf will not from hence conclude that
<PB N="95" REF="031609_0048_0FED5ADB89EA4CB0">they acted as mini&s;ters without any commi&s;&s;ion or ordination. But then he well knew, that when I &s;aid, "this is the only commi&s;&s;ion," &amp;c. I meant the only one they received <HI>as &s;tanding go&s;pel mini&s;|ters,</HI> inve&s;ted with an office to be perpetuated.&mdash; This di&s;tinction was fully expre&s;&s;ed in the clau&s;e he has &s;een &s;it to &s;uppre&s;s, viz. "in virtue of which they were impowered to act as mini&s;ters," &amp;c.&mdash; His conclu&s;ion therefore, "that this commi&s;&s;ion con&s;tituted them apo&s;tles, or el&s;e they acted with|out a commi&s;&s;ion," no ways follows. For altho' as <HI>&s;tanding ordinary mini&s;ters,</HI> they had no other commi&s;&s;ion, yet they might have <HI>as apo&s;tles.</HI> It was in the former view I &s;pake of them, not in the latter. Certainly they were called apo&s;tles long before this commi&s;&s;ion was given, even upon their being called by Chri&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. x. 2.</NOTE> Paul was called and commi&s;&s;ioned to be an <HI>apo&s;tle,</HI> and acted as &s;uch, long before he received ordination as <HI>a &s;tanding ge&s;pel mini&s;ter.</HI> The commi&s;&s;ion of the apo&s;tles as &s;uch, as extraordinary officers, was in an extraor|dinary way; by an immediate call from heaven. As apo&s;tles, they were all with Paul "not of men, neither by men, but by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and God the Father.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal. i. 1.</NOTE> When it was they received <HI>this</HI> com|mi&s;&s;ion, whether upon their fir&s;t call, as &s;ome &s;up|po&s;e, or at the day of Pentico&s;t, as others think, is perhaps difficult certainly to determine. As their <HI>apo&s;tolic office,</HI> properly &s;o called, was extra|ordinary, and temporary, there was no occa&s;ion the commi&s;&s;ion, impowering them thereto, &s;hould be particularly recorded in &s;cripture. This was given to them <HI>in per&s;on;</HI> and as they were to have no &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in it, none el&s;e had any concern with it. But as <HI>&s;tanding ordinary mini&s;ters,</HI> they were to have &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to the end of time; and therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary their commi&s;&s;ion, in this charac|ter, &s;hould be particularly recorded; for this con|cerned
<PB N="96" REF="031609_0049_0FED5AF49341E6B0">their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors as well as them&s;elves. Ac|cordingly we find, this commi&s;&s;ion is in fact re|corded: 'Tis that we have been con&s;idering: 'Tis that to which the promi&s;e is annexed of Chri&s;t's pre&s;ence to the end of the world; and the &s;ame concerning which I a&s;&s;erted in my &s;ermon, "that it is the only one, we have any account of, which Chri&s;t gave to his apo&s;tles, in virtue of which they were improved to act as <HI>ordinary</HI> mini&s;ters in his church." And for this purpo&s;e, no doubt it is re|corded, that it might be a &s;tanding commi&s;&s;ion, impowering, authorizing and directing, all the true mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t to the end of the world.</P>
<P>OUR author's next remark is to this purpo&s;e,&mdash; that while I am proving from one commi&s;&s;ion, that one order only of mini&s;ters can be virtuated by it, I my&s;elf, in effect, allow two, and &s;o defeat my own argument: For he &s;ays, I call the apo&s;tles in one place, <HI>extraordinary officers,</HI> and in another, <HI>ordinary ones,</HI> and yet the&s;e are both impowered by one commi&s;&s;ion; hence he concludes that I am "refuted by my&s;elf."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 28, 29.</NOTE></P>
<P>I ANSWER, had he hone&s;tly cited the pa&s;&s;age he pretended to quote from me, the weakne&s;s of this conclu&s;ion of his would have been obvious at fir&s;t view. 'Tis true I &s;peak of the apo&s;tles, as &s;u&s;|taining the twofold character or office, of apo&s;tles, and ordinary go&s;pel mini&s;ters. But then it is equally true that I &s;peak only with re&s;pect to the <HI>latter,</HI> when I &s;ay, "this is the commi&s;&s;ion and the only commi&s;&s;ion we have any account of their re|ceiving from Chri&s;t." This di&s;tinction and limit|ation I fully enough expre&s;&s;ed, in the pa&s;&s;age from which he quotes the&s;e words, though he has &s;een fit to &s;uppre&s;s it by a partial and imperfect quota|tion. Such acts may help to &s;upport a bad cau&s;e: A good one has no need of them. Will it at all fol|low, that becau&s;e the apo&s;tles, con&s;idered <HI>ordinary</HI>
<PB N="97" REF="031609_0049_0FED5AF49341E6B0">mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, are impowered by this one ge|neral commi&s;&s;ion, that they mu&s;t as <HI>extraordinary</HI> officers al&s;o be impowered by the &s;ame? If it will not, then there is no force at all in Mr. L's con|clu&s;ion from my argument, as though it allowed of two orders being impowered by one and the &s;ame commi&s;&s;ion. As there is nothing expre&s;&s;ly &s;aid, or even implied in this commi&s;&s;ion, of more than one order to be impowered by it; not the lea&s;t intimation, that the powers it contains are to be divided, and the whole given to one order, and part only to another; and finally, as it is incon|&s;i&s;tent to &s;uppo&s;e, that two or more officers, the one &s;uperior, the other &s;ubordinate, &s;hould be vir|tuated and appointed by one and the &s;ame commi&s;|&s;ion, we may I think, fairly conclude, that one order of go&s;pel mini&s;ters, and only one, is appoint|ed and impowered by this commi&s;&s;ion; con&s;e|quently, that all the powers contained in this com|mi&s;&s;ion belong to that one order, and that of or|dination among the re&s;t. I pre&s;ume therefore, my argument from the one commi&s;&s;ion, &s;till &s;tands good, notwith&s;tanding all Mr. L. has &s;aid again&s;t it.</P>
<P>I HAD &s;aid in my &s;ermon, "that the apo&s;tles in their extraordinary character, had no &s;ucce&s;&s;ors." This Mr. L. calls "a bold a&s;&s;ertion," and demands "what evidence I had produced to &s;upport it."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Page 29.</NOTE></P>
<P>ANSWER. As the a&s;&s;ertion is a negative, had no evidence been produced, it would hardly have de&s;erved the epithet of "bold." According to the rules of argumentation, the proof lies upon tho&s;e who affirm a fact, not upon tho&s;e who deny it. Had Mr. L. however, carefully read over the page in my &s;ermon, from whence he pretends to quote the pa&s;&s;age, he mu&s;t have &s;een the evidence he demands. My words are the&s;e,
<Q>It mu&s;t be remembered that the apo&s;tles &s;u&s;tained a twofold
<PB N="98" REF="031609_0050_0FED5AAFF9F15FC0">character; the one extraordinary as apo&s;tles, the other ordinary as go&s;pel mini&s;ters. In their extraordinary capacity, they were immediately called by Chri&s;t. Were &s;ent forth by him to be witne&s;&s;es of his re&s;urrection.&mdash;Were endowed with extraordinary gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t, the knowledge of tongues, the power of di&s;cerning &s;pirits, and of working miracles. They were not limitted to any particular place, one more than another, for the exerci&s;e of their mini&s;try; but had the whole world a&s;&s;igned them as their charge; and being under the infallible guidance of divine in&s;piration, they had the &s;uperinten|dency and government of all the churches com|mitted to them, until the canon of &s;cripture &s;hould be full, and compleat rules given for that purpo&s;e in the word of God. In this they had no &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, but this part of their office expir|ed with them&s;elves: For as there is now no oc|ca&s;ion for the&s;e extraordinary powers, &s;ince the &s;cripture is &s;ufficiently atte&s;ted, its canon com|pleated, and every thing nece&s;&s;ary for the in&s;ti|tution and government of the church, particu|cularly revealed; &s;o there are no men &s;ince the times of the apo&s;tles, who can lay any claim to the&s;e extraordinary and miraculous powers; and therefore none can pretend to be &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to them in that part of their <HI>character</HI> which was founded on the&s;e powers.</Q>&mdash;This was the &s;en&s;e in which I a&s;&s;erted "the apo&s;tles had no &s;ucce&s;&s;ors," and the&s;e the rea&s;ons I a&s;&s;igned for &s;uch a&s;&s;ertion; and to me they appear conclu&s;ive. As this extra|ordinary character of the apo&s;tles had its ri&s;e in the extraordinary circum&s;tances, attending them, and was founded in the extraordinary powers be&s;towed upon them, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have cea&s;ed, if the circum&s;tances and powers have cea&s;ed, on which it was founded; but that the latter have cea&s;ed, Mr. L. will not deny: For whatever powers they

OUR author's next attack upon this argument of the one commi&s;&s;ion, is from the order of deacons, whom the apo&s;tles, he &s;ays, by virtue of this com|mi&s;&s;ion, con&s;tituted and ordained.

<P>BUT though he cannot find the work of a deacon contained in the mini&s;terial commi&s;&s;ion, he &s;eems very de&s;irous of having their office virtuated by it, that &s;o he may make out two orders impower|ed by the &s;ame commi&s;&s;ion, contrary to what I had a&s;&s;erted.

In virtue of this, they were no more impowered to con&s;titute a new order, than any of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the &s;ame office. But as <HI>apo&s;tles,</HI> as divinely in&s;pired, and under the infallible gui|dance of the Holy Gho&s;t, they had power to do it. And in this capacity, and this only, they act|ed, when they in&s;tituted this office. As therefore, it was not in virtue of, or by power derived from the general mini&s;terial commi&s;&s;ion, that this office of deacons was in&s;tituted; &s;o there can be no ar|gument brought from their appointment, in proof of two or more offices virtuated by this commi&s;|&s;ion; con&s;equently, my argument, "that where there is but one commi&s;&s;ion, one order only can be virtuated or impowered by it," &s;till &s;tands good.</P>
<P>I READILY allow "the office of deacon, to be
<PB N="102" REF="031609_0052_0FED5AFF9D517288">inferior to that of <HI>apo&s;tle.</HI>" I grant "it is an of|fice in which the power of ordination is not in|cluded." And if it will plea&s;e him, I will con|cede too, that they may in a general &s;en&s;e, be call|ed "mini&s;ters in Chri&s;t's church." But then, as they are &s;o, not by virtue of the general commi&s;|&s;ion given to mini&s;ters as <HI>mini&s;ters of the word and &s;acraments;</HI> but by the expre&s;s appointment of the apo&s;tles, acting in their <HI>apo&s;tolic</HI> character; this will afford no argument in favour, either of his preaching deacons, or of his notion that two or more orders are impowered by this one commi&s;&s;ion. &mdash;Let him &s;hew in this commi&s;&s;ion, or el&s;ewhere, as particular an account of the appointment of their two orders of bi&s;hops and pre&s;byters, as we can produce of the in&s;titution of deacons. Let him produce as expre&s;s warrant for deacons preaching, from the account of their fir&s;t in&s;titution, as we have for that of pre&s;byters, in the general mini&s;|terial commi&s;&s;ion; and we will readily allow their &s;cheme of dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy to be warranted by &s;cripture: 'Till then, he mu&s;t not be offended if people call it by its true and proper name, an un&s;criptural &s;cheme that has no countenance from the word of God.</P>
<P>BUT he tells me, that I undertook to prove the right of people to choo&s;e their own mini&s;ters, from the in&s;tance of deacons being cho&s;en by the church.

<P>ANSWER. Deacons being called mini&s;ters in a general &s;en&s;e, agreeable to the original import of the word DIACONOS, will not prove them to be mini&s;ters in the &s;en&s;e of the commi&s;&s;ion, that is, <HI>mini&s;ters of the word and &s;acraments.</HI> If &s;o, Mr. L. mu&s;t admit of a <HI>fourth</HI> order into their prie&s;t|hood,
<PB N="103" REF="031609_0052_0FED5AFF9D517288">viz. that of &s;he-mini&s;ters: For the apo&s;tle calls Phoebe a <HI>mini&s;ter,</HI> (DIACONON) "of the church of Cenchrea."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xvi. 1.</NOTE> Con&s;equently, calling deacons <HI>min|i&s;ters</HI> in this <HI>general &s;en&s;e,</HI> will not prove "that there was more than one order of mini&s;ters, <HI>in the proper &s;en&s;e,</HI> at that time." And yet their being mini&s;ters in this general &s;en&s;e, that is, officers or &s;ervants of the church, and as &s;uch, cho&s;en and elected by the church, affords a good argument in proof of the church's right to choo&s;e her own of|ficers in general, and con&s;equently tho&s;e who are to mini&s;ter in the word and &s;acraments in particu|lar. This in&s;tance therefore, of the deacons elec|tion by the church does as effectually "prove the point for which I brought it," as if they had been mini&s;ters in the mo&s;t &s;trict and appropriate &s;en&s;e of the word. Thus my arguments for but one order of go&s;pel mini&s;ters, &s;tand, I tru&s;t, fully vin|dicated from this cavil al&s;o.</P>
<P>THOUGH deacons, in the general &s;en&s;e above, may be called mini&s;ters, yet 'tis plain from their original in&s;titution they never were de&s;igned to be mini&s;ters of the word. The occa&s;ion of their ap|pointment, and the bu&s;ine&s;s they were appointed to do, is there expre&s;&s;ly &s;aid to be, "to &s;erve ta|bles,"
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts vi. 1&mdash;4.</NOTE> and that with a &s;pecial expre&s;s view that the apo&s;tles being relea&s;ed from this care; might be at liberty to pur&s;ue their proper work, to "give them&s;elves to prayer and the mini&s;try of the word." Who can once imagine then, that preaching is any part of the deacons bu&s;ine&s;s? That when the apo&s;|tles found, that "&s;erving tables" was incon&s;i&s;tent with and too much for the mini&s;ters of the word, and accordingly in&s;tituted the order of deacons to ea&s;e them of that burden, they &s;hould neverthele&s;s devolve the whole burden of both upon the dea|cons they had appointed? The apo&s;tles them&s;elves were not &s;ufficient for both; but the deacons whom
<PB N="104" REF="031609_0053_0FED5B08B115A4B0">they appointed, it &s;eems were, if the doctrine of <HI>preaching deacons</HI> be true. When the deacon is employed in his proper work, I know no body that "de&s;pi&s;es him" (as Mr. L. complains.) It is an honorable office in the church, and ought to be &s;o e&s;teemed. But when he leaves his bu&s;ine&s;s, and becomes "a bu&s;y body in other mens matters;" when he invades an office the &s;cripture never de|&s;igned him, and pre&s;umes to preach as a mini&s;ter of the word; if he is not to be <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed</HI> upon this ac|count, mo&s;t certainly he ought to be <HI>rebuked</HI> for his ra&s;hne&s;s and pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>IN my argument from the one commi&s;&s;ion, I had the&s;e words. "Who hath a right to divide the powers Chri&s;t has evidently connected in his com|mi&s;&s;ion, and give the whole to one order of min|i&s;ters, and but half to the other; or rather to cre|ate a new order of officers in the church which the go&s;pel knows nothing of?" From the&s;e la&s;t words Mr. L. attempts to prove, that I have cut my&s;elf off from a regular ordination. For if either the bi&s;hops or pre&s;byters in their church, are this "new order which the go&s;pel knows nothing of;" as we derive our &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from the bi&s;hops of their church, by whom our fir&s;t mini&s;ters in this country were ordained, we mu&s;t, he &s;uppo&s;es, de|rive it from this new order, and therefore our ordinations mu&s;t be null.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Page 31.</NOTE></P>
<P>ANSWER. When any officers in Chri&s;t's church, in addition to the powers granted them in the go&s;|pel, engro&s;s and exerci&s;e tho&s;e which do not be|long to them, they are &s;o far forth "a new order which the go&s;pel knows nothing of." This I take to be the ca&s;e with dioce&s;an bi&s;hops. They ingro&s;s and monopolize the whole power of ordination and government, which the go&s;pel leaves, in common, to all go&s;pel mini&s;ters. In doing this, they u&s;urp a power, which does not belong to them, and in
<PB N="105" REF="031609_0053_0FED5B08B115A4B0">the exerci&s;e of this u&s;urped power, are "an or|der which the go&s;pel knows nothing of." This, however, does not nullity tho&s;e actions, which the go&s;pel impowers them to perform. Now one of the&s;e is ordination. Though therefore, in <HI>ingre&s;&s;|ing the whole power of ordination,</HI> &amp;c. to them&s;elves, they act as "a new order of which the go&s;pel knows nothing of," becau&s;e they have no right &s;o to do; yet barely in <HI>ordaining,</HI> they are an order which the go&s;pel owns, becau&s;e, by the go&s;pel, they have a right to ordain. Again, when an or|der of officers, from principle, neglect a part of the duties of their office, and which their commi&s;&s;ion obliges them to do; they are &s;o far forth; "a new order which the go&s;pel knows nothing of." This is the ca&s;e of the pre&s;byters in the epi&s;copal church. Con&s;idered as &s;et apart to the mini&s;try by ordina|tion, they are lawful go&s;pel mini&s;ters. But con|&s;idered as abridging them&s;elves of one half of the powers that belong to them, as living in a &s;tate of &s;ervile &s;ubjection to the bi&s;hop by their oath of canonical obedience; and preaching, not in virtue of Chri&s;t's commi&s;&s;ion, but the bi&s;hops licence; they are merely of human in&s;titution, a "new or|der which the go&s;pel knows nothing of." But until it is proved, that an officer's pretending to claim and exerci&s;e a power which he has not, de&s;|troys and nullifies the power which he lawfully has; Mr. L's con&s;equence, as to the unlawfulne&s;s of my ordination, will by no means follow. If a ju&s;tice of the peace &s;hould pretend to engro&s;s all the authority of his brother-ju&s;tices in a whole county, 'tis plain in &s;o doing, he would be an officer which the law knew nothing of. This, however, would not invalidate tho&s;e acts, which, as a ju&s;tice, the law impowered him to do. The Pope, with his impious and un&s;criptural claim of infallibility and univer&s;al dominion, over the whole
<PB N="106" REF="031609_0054_0FED5B055287D5E0">chri&s;tian church, I hope Mr. L. will allow, is an officer which the go&s;pel knows nothing of: And yet he, and all other advocates for uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t derive it from him, or upon their own principles, they can have no claim to the mini&s;terial character. However therefore this ar|gument of his, might move one to pity its wealt|ne&s;s. I find nothing in it to make us "a&s;hamed of proper bea&s;ting in the mini&s;terial authority we have received."</P>
<P>IN page 28 of my &s;ermon, I argued, that as a go|vernor and ju&s;tice of the peace being different of|ficers, mu&s;t be impowered by different commi&s;|&s;ions, &s;o if there were different degrees of office in the go&s;pel mini&s;try, we might rea&s;onably expect different commi&s;&s;ions, authorizing them to the&s;e offices.</P>
<P>TO this Mr. L. replies, that a governor, by virtue of the king's commi&s;&s;ion, can authorize a ju&s;tice of the peace and other officers, and ju&s;t &s;o the apo&s;tles, by virtue of their commi&s;&s;ion from Chri&s;t, "can authorize men of different orders to act in Chri&s;t's name."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 32.</NOTE></P>
<P>ANSWER. Though a governor can authorize a ju&s;tice and other officers which the laws of the king or con&s;titution have appointed, yet he can create no new officer in the &s;tate. So in the other ca&s;e. Though the apo&s;tles could ordain &s;uch officers as the go&s;pel had appointed, yet they could make no new ones, different from, or in addition to tho&s;e which the laws of Chri&s;t's kingdom, and the go&s;|pel con&s;titution have e&s;tabli&s;hed. We know it was agreeable to the go&s;pel con&s;titution, that they &s;hould appoint the office of deacon; becau&s;e they have in fact done it. Be&s;ides this, we read of no other order appointed by them. If there be any, it belongs to our opponents to produce them.&mdash; When Chri&s;t a&s;cended, he left only his eleven apo&s;|tles
<PB N="107" REF="031609_0054_0FED5B055287D5E0">in commi&s;&s;ion; all of one order, all equal in power. Had two or more orders been nece&s;&s;ary in the go&s;pel mini&s;try, he "who was faithful in all his hou&s;e," would certainly have appointed them, or left orders with his apo&s;tles to do it. As he has not; as neither he nor his apo&s;tles have in&s;ti|tuted, except deacons, any more than one order or officers in the go&s;pel church, 'tis a certain con&s;e|quence there are no other. And therefore Mr. L's plea, from what the apo&s;tles were "impow|ered to do in authorizing different orders," is no|thing to the purpo&s;e. What they were "impow|ered to do," we mu&s;t judge from what they have in fact done. And as, in fact, they have, be&s;ides deacons, appointed no other order, we may &s;afely pre&s;ume they were not impowered by Chri&s;t to appoint any other. As to the three orders which he &s;ays, they appointed in the church of Jeru&s;a|lem, it has already been con&s;idered and refuted, and his a&s;&s;ertion proved to be groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>HIS next attack upon me, is for &s;aying, "that pre&s;byters have a right to govern the church."&mdash; This, he &s;ays, "I labour hard to prove."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 32.</NOTE> 'Tis true I mentioned this occa&s;ionally, and, I think, &s;ufficiently proved it, without any "hard labour." He him&s;elf allows them &s;ome power of govern|ment. "That they have a right, in &s;ubordination to "their apo&s;tle or bi&s;hop, to govern their own flocks."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 32.</NOTE></P>
<P>ANSWER. What kind or degree of government, the mi&s;&s;ionary of Norwalk, as a <HI>&s;imple</HI> pre&s;byter, pretends to, or what manner of di&s;cipline he ex|erci&s;es over the <HI>flock</HI> there, I am not able to &s;ay. This, however, I can &s;ay, that if he exerci&s;es any di&s;cipline at all, as a ruler in the church, it is with|out book. The canons of his church and the rules of his order, having allowed nothing of this kind to him, but re&s;erved the whole affair to his ordi|nary. If therefore he &s;hould pre&s;ume to arro|gate
<PB N="108" REF="031609_0055_0FED5B0A667A72D8">any &s;uch power, and take it upon him to di&s;|cipline any of his unruly <HI>flock,</HI> "I can't &s;ay, (to u&s;e his own words to me) how they will reli&s;h the&s;e high claims of his." If he &s;hould ever attempt any thing of this kind;&mdash;"unle&s;s he does it under the &s;pecious pretence of oppo&s;ing <HI>pre&s;byterians,</HI>"&mdash; "and his people &s;hould once come to be cool, he mu&s;t take a great deal of pains, and u&s;e much art, to bring them tamely to &s;ubmit to this his claim of authority over them."</P>
<P>FOR the direct proof of the pre&s;byters right of government, the reader is referred to the latter part of this, and the next &s;ection. In the mean time there is one &s;entence more in this paragraph, which de&s;erves a remark. It is this:&mdash;"If he will allow our bi&s;hops, the &s;ame power over the pre&s;|byters, that the apo&s;tles exerci&s;ed over their pre&s;|byters, we will contend for no more in their behalf."</P>
<P>ANSWER. 'Tis granted the apo&s;tles exerci&s;ed authority over tho&s;e he calls pre&s;byters, in the age in which they lived. But the &s;ame did they al&s;o, over tho&s;e be calls bi&s;hops; particularly over Ti|mothy and Titus. If this then is any argument in proof of three orders in the church, in proof of the bi&s;hop's authority over the pre&s;byter now, it equally proves the nece&s;&s;ity of four orders, and will as effectually e&s;tabli&s;h the authority of the Pope over all other bi&s;hops, as it will theirs over pre&s;byters. But the authority the apo&s;tles exer|ci&s;ed over other go&s;pel mini&s;ters, whether pre&s;by|ters or bi&s;hops, or by whatever name they were called; they did it, not as ordinary mini&s;ters of the church, not as an order to be perpetuated; but as apo&s;tles, as officers divinely in&s;pired, &amp;c.&mdash; When therefore Mr. L. can prove his bi&s;hops, to have the &s;ame immediate mi&s;&s;ion, miraculous powers, infallible guidance, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. which con&s;tituted the apo&s;tolic character and &s;uperior au|thority; it will be then time enough for him to make, and us to grant the above demand.</P>

<P>ANSWER. Great weight. I am &s;en&s;ible, is laid by the advocates for prelacy, upon the&s;e words of our Saviour, "as my father hath &s;ent me," &amp;c. The warm patrons of epi&s;copacy, pretend here to find, the bi&s;hops exclu&s;ive right to the power of ordination, &amp;c. Though by what logic, is dif|ficult to &s;ay. Papi&s;ts, from the &s;ame text, &s;up|port the &s;acrifice of the ma&s;s. For as God the Father &s;ent Chri&s;t to offer a &s;acrifice for lin; &s;o Chri&s;t &s;ent his apo&s;tles, and they others, to offer the &s;acrifice of the ma&s;s, that is, the real fle&s;h and blood of Chri&s;t in the &s;acrament of the &s;upper. So that the&s;e words will prove almo&s;t any thing and
<PB N="110" REF="031609_0056_0FED5B344B718CD8">every thing. Now though I don't conceive the mini&s;terial commi&s;&s;ion, to be contained in the&s;e words, but rather in tho&s;e of Matt. xxviii. Yet if it will gratiry Mr. L. I am willing, for once, to allow it; to allow the commi&s;&s;ion to be collected from both. But then I don't &s;ee what &s;ervice it will be to his cau&s;e. For though the power of <HI>government</HI> is rather more particularly expre&s;&s;ed, in John's account than tho&s;e in Matthew's; <HI>the ordain|ing power,</HI> about which we are contending, is f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|as clearly expre&s;&s;ed in Matthew as in John: Of rather, it is expre&s;&s;ed in neither. However, tho' the commi&s;&s;ion in Matthew, &s;ays nothing expre&s;&s;ly about &s;ending others; yet the promi&s;e of Chri&s;t's perpetual pre&s;ence, annexed to the commi&s;&s;ion, nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es it, as I &s;hewed in my &s;er|mon; con&s;equently the ordaining power is fairly implied in the commi&s;&s;ion. But the utmo&s;t that can be pretended in John's account, is barely as implication of &s;uch power. Mr. L. &s;uppo&s;es that the power "of &s;ending others," is expre&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the&s;e words; "As my father hath &s;ent me, ever &s;o &s;end I you." Here indeed is expre&s;s mention of "the Father's &s;ending Chri&s;t," and of "Chri&s;t's &s;ending the apo&s;tles;" but not a &s;ingle word of "the apo&s;tles &s;ending others," or any thing <HI>expre&s;&s;ly</HI> in|timating that &s;uch power was committed to them. In order to this, the words mu&s;t have been, "as I &s;end you, even &s;o do ye &s;end others." Mr. L. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> conclude, will &s;ay, that the words, "as my father hath &s;ent me," &amp;c. contain in them a power com|mitted to the apo&s;tles of <HI>&s;ending</HI> others. I gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> they do. But how? Not <HI>expre&s;&s;ly,</HI> but only b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> implication. But then the &s;ame does the commi&s;|&s;ion in Matthew. As to this then, there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> manner of difference. "Perhaps, therefore, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> u&s;e his own words) no better rea&s;on can be given&punc; why Mr. L. will not allow the commi&s;&s;ion in Mat. xxviii. to be the only mini&s;terial commi&s;&s;ion, that
<PB N="111" REF="031609_0056_0FED5B344B718CD8">that it does not comport with his <HI>&s;cheme.</HI>" Ac|cording to "his <HI>&s;cheme,</HI>" there are three grada|tions in the mini&s;try. Men mu&s;t be fir&s;t ordained deacons, then pre&s;byters, and finally advanced to the highe&s;t order, bi&s;hops. But, for this, he found, one and the &s;ame identical commi&s;&s;ion would not &s;uffice. He has therefore, be&s;ides tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mentioned by me, Matthew xxviii. found, as he thinks, another in John xx. "This, he tells us, Chri&s;t gave to his apo&s;tles, the night after he ro&s;e from the dead," and &s;o before the other. By this then, according to "his <HI>&s;cheme,</HI>" the apo&s;tles mu&s;t have been ordained to no higher order than <HI>deacons,</HI> or at mo&s;t <HI>pre&s;byters.</HI> The other commi&s;&s;ion, that in Matthew, he tells us, "was given &s;ome time after in Gallilee, which therefore, "to comport with his <HI>&s;cheme,</HI>" mu&s;t have made them <HI>bi&s;hops.</HI>&mdash; But, unhappily for "his <HI>&s;cheme,</HI>" the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e, according to him, contains the powers of <HI>ordination and government,</HI> and the <HI>la&s;t,</HI> only tho&s;e of <HI>preach|ing and baptizing.</HI> According to his account, there|fore the apo&s;tles mu&s;t <HI>fir&s;t</HI> have been ordained to the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> office of bi&s;hops, and <HI>afterwards</HI> to the <HI>lower</HI> one of pre&s;byters or deacons; which, to make the mo&s;t of it "comports with his <HI>&s;cheme</HI>" but very indifferently, and mu&s;t well nigh "prove faral to his de&s;ign."</P>
<P>BUT if this will not help his own cau&s;e, he thinks it will overthrow ours. For he &s;ays,&mdash;"if we find that the words of the commi&s;&s;ion that their mini&s;|ters received from our bi&s;hops, are not expre&s;&s;ive of &s;uch power, viz. (of ordination and govern|ment:) We mu&s;t conclude they did not receive &s;uch authority as is pretended."
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 34.</NOTE></P>
<P>ANSWER. If there is but one mini&s;terial commi&s;|&s;ion, as has been proved, then all who are lawfully ordained, are ve&s;ted with this commi&s;&s;ion, and all the powers it contains, of which ordination is one,
<PB N="112" REF="031609_0057_0FED5B246F02DDC8">let the intention of the ordainers be what they will. The bi&s;hops, who ordained our fir&s;t mini&s;ters, in|tended, I hope, to make them lawful mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, and inve&s;t them with his commi&s;&s;ion; and moreover, u&s;ed words &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ive of &s;uch intention. If they did not do this in our ca&s;e, nei|ther did they, I pre&s;ume, in that of Mr. L. and his brethen: They are therefore not lawful mini&s;|ters of Chri&s;t, not being ve&s;ted with his commi&s;|&s;ion. But if this was done in the ca&s;e of the lat|ter, it was equally &s;o in that of the former; con|&s;equently they were ve&s;ted with Chri&s;t's general commi&s;&s;ion and with all the powers of it, and tho&s;e of ordination and government among the re&s;t.</P>
<P>As a proof of but one order in the mini&s;try, I mentioned, in my &s;ermon, the elders of the church of Ephe&s;us, Acts xx. and &s;aid, "the intire gui|dance and government of the church was com|mitted to the&s;e elders, without any mention of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ingle per&s;on as their &s;uperior in office." <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Mr. L. demands, "Where does he find that the government of the&s;e churches was committed to the&s;e elders."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 34.</NOTE></P>
<P>ANSWER. I find it in the words directed to the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by the apo&s;tle, v. 28. He there charges them in the&s;e words.
<Q>Take heed therefore to your&s;elves and to all the flock over the which the Holy&punc; Gho&s;t hath made you <HI>over&s;eers;</HI> to <HI>feed</HI> the church of God.</Q> But he tells me
<Q>they are here expre&s;&s;ly &s;aid to be made over&s;eers, not to <HI>govern,</HI> but to <HI>feed</HI> the flock; and he is really <HI>amazed</HI> I &s;hould a&s;&s;ert, that the intire guidance and government of the church is committed to them, for he can &s;ee nothing of it there.</Q> Per|haps the following ob&s;ervations may help him <HI>to &s;ee</HI> it.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place,&mdash;I find this power of govern|ment contained in the <HI>name,</HI> by which the&s;e elders are there called. The apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;ly calls them
<PB N="113" REF="031609_0057_0FED5B246F02DDC8"><HI>our&s;elves.</HI> He tells them they were made, EPISCO|POUS, bi&s;hops, over this church, and that by the Holy Gho&s;t. This name includes in it the power of rule or guidance. It is rendered, by the be&s;t lexi|cographers, by <HI>epicopus,</HI> bi&s;hop, <HI>in&s;pector,</HI> an in|&s;pector, <HI>prae&s;es,</HI> a pre&s;ident or chief ruler. Ac|cordingly it is the very name that epi&s;copalians have appropriated to the highe&s;t order of their clergy, the bi&s;hops; and that as peculiarly expre&s;|&s;ive of the power of government or chief rule.&mdash; If therefore their bi&s;hops, as &s;uch, are ve&s;ted with the power of government, the&s;e elders are al&s;o; for they are expre&s;&s;ly called <HI>bi&s;hops;</HI> and were made &s;uch even by the Holy Gho&s;t. Doubtle&s;s the Holy Gho&s;t, in making them bi&s;hops, com|mitted to them the whole power of bi&s;hops, and this of government among the re&s;t. Mr. L. allows, tho&s;e who are made bi&s;hops, by other bi&s;hops in their church, or even by the grand <HI>pontiff</HI> at Rome, to be inve&s;ted with the power of governing the church. But to the&s;e bi&s;hops at Ephe&s;us, who were made &s;uch by the Holy Gho&s;t; he will not allow any &s;uch power. How partial is this, to &s;ay no more? This power of government therefore is included in the very <HI>name</HI> by which the&s;e elders are called.</P>
<P>AGAIN. It is included, and that expre&s;&s;ly, in the charges the apo&s;tle gives them. The words are, "to <HI>feed</HI> the flock of God, POIMAINEIN.

<P>HAVING thus made good the a&s;&s;ertion in my &s;ermon, "that the government of the church was ve&s;ted in the&s;e elders, the argument deduced from it in &s;upport of pre&s;byterian ordination &s;till &s;tands good.

<P>THE whole of what our author calls "his direct proof of epi&s;copacy," turns upon "the directions given by the apo&s;tle to Timothy, com|pared with his charge to the elders of Ephe&s;us." "There are &s;ome things, &s;ays he, given in charge to the&s;e elders, in common with Timothy: Such as,&mdash;to take heed to them&s;elves and to their doc|trine," &amp;c. "But be&s;ides the&s;e, he tells us, there are &s;everal particulars, of great importance, that Paul gave in charge to Timothy, which he did not &s;o much as mention to all the&s;e elders."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 39.</NOTE>&mdash; Particularly.&mdash;He informs him as to the qualifica|tions of pre&s;byterians and deacons.&mdash;Orders him to charge &s;ome that they teach no other doctrine.

"The&s;e things, he &s;ays, Paul gave in charge to Timothy, but did not &s;o much as mention them to the elders of Ephe&s;us." Hence he infers, "that Timothy was &s;uperior in office to the&s;e elders, and charged with the go|vernment of them, and of the church at Ephe&s;us."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Page 43, 44.</NOTE>
<PB N="118" REF="031609_0060_0FED5B105B70F6A0">He then concludes, "that Timothy had the &s;ame authority that their bi&s;hops claim, and the elders the &s;ame power only that the pre&s;byters, in their church, exerci&s;e," con&s;equently, "that epi&s;co|pacy is of <HI>divine right,</HI> and the whole di&s;pute is at an end."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 44.</NOTE> This is the true &s;tate of his argument pre&s;ented in its full force.

<P N="2">2. If this argument proves Timothy's &s;uperi|ority to the elders of Ephe&s;us, it will equally fol|low, and upon the &s;ame principles, that he was &s;uperior to many others al&s;o, whom yet Mr. L. him&s;elf allows to be bi&s;hops in his &s;en&s;e of the word. He has told us that Barnabas was an apo&s;|tle or bi&s;hop;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 22.</NOTE> that Epaphroditus was the bi&s;hop of Philippi, and James of the church at Jeru&s;alem.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Page 20.</NOTE> But no where will he find tho&s;e particular direc|tions given to them, as are here given to Timo|thy. Where does he find Barnabas the apo&s;tle, James the bi&s;hop of Jeru&s;alem, or Epaphroditus of Philippi receiving tho&s;e <HI>more, and more import|ant charges,</HI> which, as he pretends, di&s;tingui&s;h and prove the epi&s;copal character of Timothy bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us?&mdash;In this re&s;pect even the Ephe&s;ian elders, to whom yet our author will not allow the epi&s;copal authority, have evidently the advantage. Fort hey, he allows, received charges and direc|tions from the apo&s;tle, though not &s;o <HI>many</HI> and <HI>important</HI> as Timothy did. But the&s;e, whom ne|verthele&s;s he owns were proper bi&s;hops, received no &s;uch charges. Either therefore he mu&s;t re|nounce the epi&s;copal character of James, Epaph|roditus, &amp;c. and give up his argument for epi&s;|copacy thence ari&s;ing; or el&s;e he mu&s;t allow the&s;e elders of Ephe&s;us to the bi&s;hops, and &s;o give up his pre&s;ent argument; or finally, which will amount to the &s;ame, mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e Timothy to be &s;upe|rior to both, and, by divine right, an arch-bi&s;hop, a prince, apo&s;tle or Pope. Nay further, as there
<PB N="121" REF="031609_0061_0FED5B5519170CC8">are no &s;uch particular directions and <HI>important</HI> charges, in &s;cripture, given, even to the twelve apo&s;tles them&s;elves, as are here given to Timothy, it mu&s;t follow, from this argument, that Timothy was &s;uperior even to them. And that although he received his directions and charges from the apo&s;tle Paul, he was neverthele&s;s Paul's &s;uperior: For we no where find &s;uch particular directions and <HI>important</HI> charges given even to him, as are here given to Timothy. Thus this argument for Tim|othy's &s;uperior power and character, while it de|prives the Ephe&s;ian bi&s;hops of pa&s;toral authority, at the &s;ame time cuts off all others mentioned in &s;cripture, even the apo&s;tles not excepted, from any claim to the powers of ordination and government.</P>
<P>THERE is no way, I conceive, to get clear of this difficulty, upon his &s;cheme, but only by &s;up|po&s;ing, that though the apo&s;tles had not the&s;e par|ticular directions given them that Timothy had, yet all the powers that belong to the pa&s;toral or epi&s;copal function are included in their general commi&s;&s;ion given them by Chri&s;t, and this is &s;uf|ficient to con&s;titute them proper bi&s;hops. It is granted they were. But then the &s;ame mu&s;t be granted in the ca&s;e of the&s;e elders, to whom he d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nies this power, and then his whole argument is defeated. They al&s;o were ve&s;ted with the powers included in the mini&s;terial commi&s;&s;ion given by Chri&s;t, and be&s;ides, had a particular charge given by the apo&s;tle, which, as I &s;hall &s;hew anon, ne|ce&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;ed the&s;e powers. Either therefore this argument intirely cuts off the apo&s;tles, and all others mentioned in the go&s;pel, from any claim to the powers of ordination and government, and leaves. Timothy the only apo&s;tle or bi&s;hop; or el&s;e, if the others are allowed to be ve&s;ted with the&s;e powers, in virtue of the general mini&s;terial com|mi&s;&s;ions the &s;ame mu&s;t be granted to the&s;e elders
<PB N="122" REF="031609_0062_0FED5B56CB20A9D0">al&s;o, and &s;o his argument to prove dioce&s;an epi&s;|copacy, from this in&s;tance, loo&s;es all its force.&mdash; But,&mdash;</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is not true, in fact, that Paul gave more <HI>important charges</HI> to Timothy, than what he gave to the&s;e elders, and therefore, Mr. L's argument, founded upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that he did, is not conclu&s;ive. His charge to the&s;e elders, very ex|pre&s;&s;ly con&s;iders them as bi&s;hops of the church of Ephe&s;us; yea as appointed and fixed in the pa&s;|toral or epi&s;copal office over that church, even by the Holy Gho&s;t. "Take heed therefore to your|&s;elves, and to all the flock over the which the Holy Gho&s;t hath <HI>fixed or e&s;tabli&s;hed you bi&s;hops.</HI>"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">ATHETO EPISCOPOUS gr. Acts xx. 28.</NOTE> When therefore the apo&s;tle here charges them to "take heed to the flock over which they were con&s;tituted bi&s;hops;" it is a direct charge, to do all the work to di&s;charge all the duties, and execute all the powers of the epi&s;copal office, con&s;equently tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of ordination and government which are part of tho&s;e powers. When the &s;ame apo&s;tle directs Timothy "to do the work of an evangeli&s;t," all will allow it a command to di&s;charge all the du|ties of that office. And when our Lord, in his general commi&s;&s;ion to his apo&s;tles, bids them "go teach all nations," &amp;c. it is granted on all hands, to be a command, authorizing and requiring them to exerci&s;e all the offices and powers of the mini&s;|try. So when the apo&s;tle here commands the&s;e elders to "take heed to the flock over which the Holy Gho&s;t had made them bi&s;hops; it equally, comprizes in them a charge to the exerci&s;e of the whole power and duty of a bi&s;hop, as though they had been all particularly enumerated, as it is pre|tended they were in the directions to Timothy.&mdash; Is Timothy, for in&s;tance, "charged to &s;ee to the qualifications of &s;uch who were to be ordained pre&s;byters and deacons?" The &s;ame is given in
<PB N="123" REF="031609_0062_0FED5B56CB20A9D0">charge to the&s;e elders, when they are commanded to "take heed to this whole flock as its proper bi&s;hops or pa&s;tors," to which office this work be|longs. Is Timothy ordered to charge the elders that they teach no other than go&s;pel doctrines? The &s;ame is included in the charge given to the&s;e elders. They are expre&s;&s;ly commanded to "take heed to the whole flock," &amp;c. to <HI>feed,</HI> i. e. not only to reach, but, as I have largely proved above, to <HI>rule</HI> and govern this church of Ephe&s;us. Paul had particularly reminded them, "how that he had kept back nothing that was profitable to them, but had taught them publicly, and from hou&s;e to hou&s;e;" that the doctrine he had preached, was repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t;" "and that he had not &s;hunned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> declare unto them the whole coun&s;el of God;" <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that he had &s;hewed them all the&s;e things, to the in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nt that &s;o laboring," i. e. as he had done, "they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ight &s;upport the weak," &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver&s;e 20, 21, 27, 35.</NOTE> Now what can the apo&s;tle mean, by &s;o particularly mentioning in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is charge, what, and how he had preached, but in &s;et them an example, how they &s;hould preach them&s;elves? And that they &s;hould take care, <HI>that as other doctrine</HI> &s;hould be taught by others, is very particularly contained in his exhortation to them. For after he had given them the above charge, as a rea&s;on of it he immediately &s;ubjoins "for I know this, "that after my departure, &s;hall grievous wolves enter in among you, not &s;paring the flock; al&s;o of your own&s;elves &s;hall men ari&s;e, &s;peaking perver&s;e things, to draw away di&s;ciples after them.

Would it not appear extremely imper|tinent, not to &s;ay ridiculous, for the bi&s;hop of London, Mr. L's dioce&s;an, to give him a &s;olemn charge, to "take heed to the church at Norwalk, to watch over it, to feed and govern it as a proper bi&s;hop or pa&s;tor," and that with a &s;pecial view to prevent "fal&s;e teachers from thru&s;hing them|&s;elves in, and drawing away di&s;ciples after them;" when at the &s;ame time, his Lord&s;hip well knew, that he was &s;o far from having any power to <HI>rebuke an</HI> elder, to <HI>receive an accu&s;ation</HI> again&s;t the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> teachers, and &s;o prevent the bad effects of their endeavours to <HI>draw away di&s;ciples after them;</HI> that he has not authority to call to account, even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> private chri&s;tian, or judge and cen&s;ure the meane&s;t offending member in his church?

<P>THIS power therefore mo&s;t certainly they had. A power of "receiving an accu&s;ation again&s;t as elder," again&s;t any of their own number, "any that &s;hould ari&s;e from among them&s;elves;" and if found guilty, "of rebuking them openly before all, that others might fear;" a power, in &s;hort, of putting to &s;ilence fal&s;e or &s;candalous mini&s;ters, and of laying on hands upon others and ordaining them in their &s;tead.&mdash;This power they had equally with Timothy, which though not &s;o particularly expre&s;&s;ed, is yet as nece&s;&s;arily included in the charge
<PB N="125" REF="031609_0063_0FED5B3BC8357C78">given to them, as in that given to him. Be&s;ides, Timothy him&s;elf was certainly ordained by &s;uch elders, as has been already proved, and therefore the&s;e elders had the &s;ame power to ordain.</P>
<P>AND as to "the one &s;olemn charge more" &s;o very remarkable, mentioned by our author as given to Timothy, viz. "of keeping the commandment till the coming of Chri&s;t," &s;ince he him&s;elf tells us "that this is of like nature with the promi&s;e to the apo&s;tles, <HI>that Chri&s;t would be with them to the end of the world;</HI>" it is evident from what he expre&s;&s;ly allows el&s;ewhere, that this mu&s;t belong to the&s;e pre&s;byters, equally with Timothy, even upon &s;uppo&s;ition Timothy was their &s;uperior.&mdash; For, &s;peaking of this promi&s;e, he &s;ays; "though it might with more propriety be confined to the apo&s;tolic office, than to the other, i. e. that of pre&s;byters; yet we allow that it extends to <HI>both,</HI> as <HI>both</HI> are to continue to the end of time." As this charge therefore is what he calls, when applied to Timothy, "a charge, not merely per&s;onal, but &s;uch as had relation to the office he &s;u&s;tained;" and as this, according to him, "is <HI>peculiar</HI> to tho&s;e officers of Chri&s;t, who have power to con&s;titute other officers in the church<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">" it undeniably fol|lows from his own conce&s;&s;ion, that the&s;e elders, even though inferior to Timothy, had power to con&s;titute or ordain other officers in their church; "for to <HI>their</HI> office, he tells us, was the promi&s;e and charge given, as well as to that of the apo&s;tles, &s;ince both are to continue to the end of time;" con&s;equently the&s;e elders, having his <HI>own</HI> charac|teri&s;tic of tho&s;e who had power to con&s;titute others, mu&s;t be inve&s;ted with the power of ordaining by his own conce&s;&s;ion: And &s;o upon his own princi|ples, pre&s;byterian ordination is &s;criptural, "and, to u&s;e his own words, the di&s;pute is at an end."</P>
<P N="4">4. THAT Timothy could not be the bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us, left there with ordaining power, &amp;c. is
<PB N="126" REF="031609_0064_0FED5B5C5ACBCD60">evident from Mr. L's own definition of an officer ve&s;ted with that power. For he tells us "that at the time in which the &s;criptures were wrote, none had power to ordain mini&s;ters in Chri&s;t's kingdom, but tho&s;e only who are in <HI>&s;cripture</HI> called <HI>apo&s;tles.</HI>" Again:&mdash;"Let it be carefully remark|ed, that tho&s;e who were commi&s;&s;ioned to &s;end others, were called <HI>apo&s;tles</HI> in the time when the New-Te&s;tament was penned."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 10.</NOTE> This then, with him, is ab&s;olutely <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to the character of tho&s;e who had power to ordain at that time, viz. that they are in <HI>&s;cripture</HI> called apo&s;tles. But now Ti|mothy is no where in &s;cripture called an apo&s;tle, and therefore, according to his own definition, could not be left at Ephe&s;us with power to ordain. Pity it is he had not thought of this. It would have &s;aved him all the learned labour of his "direct proof of epi&s;copacy." And though it would have de|prived him of the plea&s;ure of tho&s;e confident tri|umphs, with which the conclu&s;ion of it is orna|mented, and robbed him of the applau&s;e which his zealous admirers lavi&s;h upon this part of his per|formance more e&s;pecially; yet, in the judgment of the impartial, "his book would have been as good as it is now, though not quite &s;o long."</P>
<P>BUT perhaps he will endeavour to prove, for he told us he de&s;igned it, though it &s;hould &s;eem, he afterwards forgot his promi&s;e, "that Timothy was admitted to the apo&s;tolic office." But if he was, why is he never called an apo&s;tle? Paul fre|quently joins him with him&s;elf, in the in&s;cription of his epi&s;tles. And though he takes to him&s;elf the name of apo&s;tle, yet, 'tis remarkable, he ne|ver once gives it to Timothy. His &s;tile is, "Paul an apo&s;tle of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and Timothy a broth|er."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. i. 1.

Be&s;ides, if Timothy was an apo&s;tle, he was equal to St. Paul. But that he was not, is plain from the au|thority Paul exerci&s;es over him. He every where treats him, not as an equal, but an inferior. He writes epi&s;tles to him, in which he warns, directs, charges, commands him, in the mo&s;t authoritative manner.

This would incline one to think, Timothy was &s;uperior to the&s;e elders in no re&s;pects.&mdash;But if he was, yet,&mdash;</P>
<P N="5">5. HE was an evangeli&s;t, and therefore could not be, as Mr. L. &s;uppo&s;es, a re&s;ident governor or fixed bi&s;hop in Ephe&s;us, or any other place.

Now the work and bu&s;ine&s;s of an evangeli&s;t was utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with a fixed relation to any church, as its &s;tated pa&s;tor or bi&s;hop.

At Baerea he was with Paul, and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ode there &s;till</HI> with Silas. Acts xvii. 14. The word is the &s;ame, as is u&s;ed for his continuing at Ephe&s;us.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">UPEMENON, PROSMEINAI.</NOTE> If therefore, in the one in&s;tance, his &s;o abiding makes him bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us; it equal|ly makes him bi&s;hop of Baerea in the other. 'Tis true he &s;oon left Baerea, and followed Paul to Athens. Acts xvii. 15. But 'tis equally true that he was to &s;tay at Ephe&s;us, only till Paul fini&s;hed his journey to Macedonia, and returned to him again. 1 Tim. iii. 14, chap. iv. 13. And in the &s;econd epi&s;tle, which was written not long after the fir&s;t, it is mo&s;t probable, from chap. iv. ver&s;e 12, that he had left Ephe&s;us already: But if he had not, 'tis certain he then left it; for the apo&s;tle there calls him away to Rome, and &s;ends Tychicus, another evangeli&s;t to Ephe&s;us. 2 Tim. iv. 9, 12; 21. Eph. vi. 21, 22. In 1 The&s;. i. 1. we find him in Athens; whence he was &s;ent to The&s;&s;alo|nica, and from thence returned back to Athens. 1 The&s;. iii. 1, 2, 6. After this he removed with Paul to Corinth, Acts xviii. 5. From thence he accompanied him to A&s;ia and Ephe&s;us. Acts xix. 1. And thence he was &s;ent into Macedonia. Ver&s;e 21, 22. But it would be tedious to follow him, in all
<PB N="130" REF="031609_0066_0FED5B120BB49CD0">his travels to &s;o many different places. Enough has been mentioned of his unfixed, itinerant man|ner of life, to &s;hew he was an evangeli&s;t, and there|fore could not be a fixed re&s;ident officer in any church. The &s;ame might be &s;hewn as to Titus, whom epi&s;copalians make to be bi&s;hop of Crete, barely becau&s;e the apo&s;tle, for &s;ome &s;hort time, left him there for certain purpo&s;es. There is the cleare&s;t evidence from &s;cripture, that they were both of them impowered in the work of the evan|geli&s;ts. And as this was utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with their &s;u&s;taining a relation to any particular church, as their fixed pa&s;tors or bi&s;hops, 'tis a clear con|&s;equence they did not &s;u&s;tain &s;uch relation. There|fore all our author has argued in &s;upport of epi&s;|copacy, from the&s;e directions given to Timothy, is nothing to his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6. As the &s;cripture is wholly &s;ilent as to this notion of Timothy's epi&s;copal care of Ephe&s;us; &s;o there is nothing in any of the ancient fathers to &s;upport this opinion, but much to the contrary.&mdash;Dr. Whitby, who was well read in the fathers, confe&s;&s;es, as I &s;hewed in my &s;ermon, "that as to the great controver&s;y, whether Timothy and Titus were indeed bi&s;hops, the one of Ephe&s;us, the other of Crete, he could find nothing of this matter in any writer of the fir&s;t centuries, nor any intima|tion that they bore that name." He adds indeed, "that this defect is abundantly &s;upplied by the concurrent &s;uffrage of the fourth and fifth." "But the&s;e, as Dr. Chauncy ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, were times too far di&s;tant from Timothy and Titus, to be relied on for the truth of this fact; e&s;pecially, as in the&s;e times they had greatly departed from the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dud. Lec. page 51.</NOTE> And if Mr. L's quo|tations from Iraeneus be true, this &s;ilence of the fathers for 300 years, c&oacute;ncerning the fact in que&s;|tion, is a certain evidence it never did exi&s;t. Irae|neus's

<P>BESIDES, it is evident from eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, that the apo&s;tle John was at Ephe&s;us, and <HI>re&s;ided</HI> there for a con&s;iderable time after Paul's departure thence, and after the writing the fir&s;t epi&s;tle to Timothy, on which his pretended epi&s;copacy over that church is founded.

Con&s;equently all attempts to prove epi&s;copacy from this argument are to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="7">7. AND la&s;tly, we need not recur to eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal hi&s;tory for proof of this point. The &s;acred &s;criptures abundantly prove, that not Timothy, but the elders of Ephe&s;us, were the true and only <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> of this church. This is evident from the account given of them in Acts xx. 17, 36. Before this. Paul had been &s;ucce&s;sfully labouring for near three years in and about Ephe&s;us. Great numbers
<PB N="132" REF="031609_0067_0FED5B2EAC3B45D0">had been converted to the faith. A flouri&s;hing church gathered, and elders ordained. And now that the apo&s;tle was about to leave them, never to &s;ee them more; as one deeply concerned for them, &s;ince he could not vi&s;it the church in per&s;on, he &s;ends for the elders of it, preaches his farewell &s;er|mon to them, and gives him his la&s;t directions and charge, in a mo&s;t &s;olemn and moving addre&s;s.&mdash;In all which there is not one word mentioned, or the lea&s;t hint given, of &s;etting a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> per&s;on over them as their bi&s;hop. So far from this, the whole government of the church is expre&s;&s;ly committed to <HI>them</HI> and them only, in a &s;tate of equality. And what is remarkable, though Timothy was proba|bly now pre&s;ent, not a &s;ingle word is &s;aid of his relation to this church. No directions are given to <HI>him</HI> as the governor of it, nor the lea&s;t hint mentioned to the&s;e elders, to con&s;ider and obey him as their &s;uperior: But <HI>they,</HI> the elders, are the only per&s;ons mentioned as the appointed offi|cers in it. They are expre&s;&s;ly called its <HI>bi&s;hops;</HI> yea are declared to be appointed &s;uch by the Holy Gho&s;t. The care and guidance of the church, in all things, is committed to them, and they are, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, charged to &s;eed, teach, <HI>rule and govern</HI> it, as its only proper pa&s;tors or bi&s;hops. And what puts the matter beyond di&s;|pute, they are commanded to do this with an ex|pre&s;s view to prevent the future di&s;orders which the apo&s;tle fore&s;aw, were about to ari&s;e in this church, by "grievous wolves, men &s;peaking perver&s;e things," "thru&s;ting them&s;elves in," "to draw away di&s;ciples after them." This is the expre&s;s rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for giving this charge. To pre|vent this, they are commanded to <HI>watch,</HI> to <HI>rule</HI> and govern the flock committed to their care, and exerci&s;e that authority, which, as its proper pa&s;|tors or bi&s;hops, they are ve&s;ted with, in warning their people again&s;t tho&s;e grievous wolves, con|vincing
<PB N="133" REF="031609_0067_0FED5B2EAC3B45D0">the&s;e gain&s;ayers, or by exerci&s;ing their pa&s;toral authority, in way of di&s;cipline; to put to &s;ilence the&s;e corrupt teachers. But now how in|con&s;i&s;tent will all this appear, if they were not the pa&s;tors, but only the &s;ubject pre&s;byters of this church, as our author affirms? What propriety, in giving them, and them only, this &s;olemn charge, when they had no power, no authority to comply with the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential branches of it? How ab|&s;urd, to direct them in the government and di&s;|cipline of this church, both as to private members and corrupt teachers, when they could exerci&s;e no authority over either, and at the &s;ame time, in|tirely to omit Timothy, to whom, and only whom, upon the epi&s;copalian &s;cheme, the whole of this bu&s;ine&s;s belonged? The &s;uppo&s;ition is ridiculous. It de&s;troys the whole force of the apo&s;tle's rea&s;on|ing, and renders his di&s;cour&s;e quite impertinent.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle, no doubt, had a tender concern for the future welfare and good government of this church. He had long pre&s;ided over it in per&s;on. He was now taking his final leave of its officers, never to &s;ee them more.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 25.</NOTE> The elders under&s;tood him in this &s;en&s;e. They took leave of him, as their apo&s;tolic father, in a manner mo&s;t tender and affecting, with many tears. "Sorrowing mo&s;t of all for the words which he &s;pake, that they &s;hould &s;ee his face no more."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 38.</NOTE> This then was the proper time, to provide for the future gui|dance of this church and its officers; to provide a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> per&s;on to &s;ucceed him in the government of it, had this been the &s;cripture model, as our opponents pretend. Had this been the go&s;pel plan, certainly Paul would not have concealed it from the&s;e elders, e&s;pecially at &s;uch a time as this. He called them to record, "that he was pure from the blood of all men," "that he had kept back nothing that was profitable for them, nor &s;hunned
<PB N="134" REF="031609_0068_0FED5B07044EC880">to declare unto them, the whole coun&s;el of God."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 20, 26, 27.</NOTE> And then immediately adds, "that the Holy Gho&s;t had made them the <HI>fixed</HI> over&s;eers, <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> or pa&s;|tors of this church," without &s;o much as hinting that any one was to pre&s;ide over them. Had <HI>epi&s;|copacy</HI> "been profitable to them," the apo&s;tle mu&s;t have known it. Had it been any part of the "coun&s;el of God," he mu&s;t have told them &s;o; for he "kept back nothing of that." Now was the proper time to have done it when he was giv|ing them his la&s;t, his parting directions. But nei|ther before, nor now, does he mention a word of any &s;uch thing. On the contrary, he expre&s;&s;ly commits to the&s;e pre&s;byters, in a &s;tate of parity, the whole government of this church, which plain|ly &s;hews, that dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy was no part of "the coun&s;el of God," and therefore not of divine in&s;titution.</P>
<P>IN this view of the ca&s;e, the <HI>directions</HI> given to Timothy, while at Ephe&s;us, (if indeed he was there when he received them) will nothing weaken the force of this conclu&s;ion: And yet on them, the whole &s;trength of Mr. L's argument depends.&mdash;For, granting he was there, when he received the&s;e epi&s;tles; yet all &s;killful chronologi&s;ts agree, they were wrote, long before the convention of Paul, and the elders at Miletus; and mo&s;t probably, before the church of Ephe&s;us was &s;ettled according to go&s;pel order, with pre&s;byters appointed in it. If this was the ca&s;e, the <HI>directions</HI> mu&s;t be &s;ent to Timothy, for there was no other officer to whom they could be &s;ent. His &s;tay, however, at Ephe&s;us, was but &s;hort at the longe&s;t. He was &s;oon called away by the apo&s;tle, and there is no account that he ever returned. If he did, it could not be as their bi&s;h|op; for this office was conferred upon the elders, by the expre&s;s direction of the Holy Gho&s;t. Ve&s;t|ed with this office, the apo&s;tle found them, when
<PB N="135" REF="031609_0068_0FED5B07044EC880">they met him at Miletus; and in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, he left them, when he took his final leave of them, never to &s;ee them more. Judge then, who is to be credited in this ca&s;e; our author, who &s;ays the&s;e elders were only &s;imple pre&s;byters, without any pa&s;toral authority in this church; or the apo&s;tle, who expre&s;&s;ly charges them, to exerci&s;e &s;uch au|thority in the government of it!&mdash;Mr. L. who confidently a&s;&s;erts, that Timothy was their only bi&s;hop, to whom they and the church of Ephe&s;us were &s;ubjected, as their &s;ingle pa&s;tor or over&s;eer; or St. Paul, who a&s;&s;ures us, that the&s;e were ap|pointed by the Holy Gho&s;t, in parity, the <HI>over&s;eers</HI> or <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> of this whole flock!&mdash;"Look into the &s;criptures. Judge for your&s;elves. If what I have advanced, is not fact, it may be ea&s;ily expo&s;ed. If it is an undeniable truth, it is a truth of great im|portance, if religion be &s;o."</P>
<P>I AM now prepared for a few remarks upon &s;ome &s;elect pa&s;&s;ages in this part of Mr. L's defence, which will conclude this &s;ection.</P>
<P>HE enquires,&mdash;"If the elders of Ephe&s;us had power to ordain and govern, what need of <HI>&s;ending</HI> Timothy there?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 43.</NOTE> <HI>leaving</HI> him there, he &s;hould have &s;aid.&mdash;I an&s;wer,&mdash;</P>
<P>IT does not appear from &s;cripture, that this church had any &s;ettled pa&s;tors at this time. But if it had, they needed the divine directions concerning ordination and government, contained in the&s;e epi&s;tles to Timothy, as much as we do at this day. And who more proper to receive, and put them in execution, than an evangeli&s;t, an extraordinary officer, and a faithful companion of Paul? But till he can prove that Timothy was le&s;t there, as a re&s;ident pa&s;tor over that church, as fully as I have, that the elders were, this will be no &s;ervice to his cau&s;e. Barely his being <HI>&s;ent to</HI> Ephe&s;us, will not prove this. If &s;o, Tychicus al&s;o was their
<PB N="136" REF="031609_0069_0FED5B3D776BA328">bi&s;hop, for he was &s;ent there as well as Timothy. And upon the &s;ame principle, Timothy mu&s;t have been bi&s;hop al&s;o of Corinth, The&s;&s;alonica, Mace|donia, &amp;c. for to all the&s;e was he &s;ent as well as to Ephe&s;us. This would be to make him a <HI>pre|lati&s;t</HI> as well as a <HI>non-re&s;ident,</HI> and exhibit a com|pleat idea of modern epi&s;copacy.&mdash;Again,&mdash;</P>
<P>HE demands a proof from facts recorded in &s;cripture, "that <HI>mere</HI> pre&s;byters, in virtue of their office as &s;uch, did ordain officers in the church of Chri&s;t."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Page 46, 47.</NOTE>&mdash;An&s;wer.</P>
<P>IF by <HI>mere</HI> pre&s;byters, he means, &s;uch as tho&s;e in his church, profe&s;&s;edly &s;ubjecting them&s;elves to bi&s;hops, and di&s;claiming all pa&s;toral authority in ordination and government; none will pretend to prove from &s;cripture that &s;uch ever did ordain.&mdash;And good rea&s;on for it. The &s;cripture knows of no &s;uch order. But if he means &s;cripture-pre&s;by|ters, &s;uch as tho&s;e at Ephe&s;us; pre&s;byter-bi&s;hops, &s;uch as Timothy and Titus were directed to ordain; I have already proved, &s;uch pre&s;byters did in fact ordain, and that by virtue of their office. Of this &s;ort were tho&s;e, who ordained Paul, Barnabas and Timothy, as I have already proved, <HI>by expre&s;s facts recorded in &s;cripture.</HI> And what is more:&mdash;The &s;criptures plainly &s;hew, that none but &s;uch ought to ordain; they being the only mini&s;ters, author|ized by Chri&s;t's general commi&s;&s;ion, and ve&s;ted with all the powers it contains.</P>
<P>WHAT he quotes from Mr. Beach, re&s;pecting our fir&s;t mini&s;ters, who were ordained by the En|gli&s;h bi&s;hops, is no valid objection again&s;t this, even allowing that there was no expre&s;&s;ed inten|tion, either in the ordainers, or ordained, of con|veying the power of ordination. For the com|mi&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, not the intention of the ordain|ers, is what conveys the power in ordination, as I &s;hewed in my &s;ermon. I now add:&mdash;The&s;e fir&s;t
<PB N="137" REF="031609_0069_0FED5B3D776BA328">mini&s;ters of New-England were ordained, I con|clude, in the &s;ame manner as Mr. L. and his brethren were. Either therefore he is no mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, not being ve&s;ted with his commi&s;&s;ion in ordination: Or if the words u&s;ed in his ordination, were &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ive of &s;uch inve&s;titure, in his ca&s;e; they were equally &s;o in that of our mini&s;|ters; con&s;equently, they were cloathed with all the powers the commi&s;&s;ion contains, of which that of ordination is confe&s;&s;edly one.</P>
<P>As to the other part of this objection, the oath of canonical obedience; though it is far from be|ing true, that this, as he affirms, includes in it "a &s;olemn promi&s;e never to ordain others;" yet allowing it did, &s;uch promi&s;e, being evidently &s;inful, can't be binding upon con&s;cience, but is <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> null and void. A number of the Jews bound them&s;elves by &s;olemn oath, "not to eat or drink till they had killed Paul."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xxiii. 12.</NOTE> If this oath was binding, it was their duty to keep it; con&s;equently, murder is a duty. For the murder of Paul or of them&s;elves, was a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of their keeping this oath. But if it was not binding in this in&s;tance, no more was it in the ca&s;e he &s;uppo&s;es, con&s;equently the objection is of no force.</P>
<P>MR. L. &s;ays,&mdash;"Nothing is now claimed by our bi&s;hops, but the very &s;ame that St. Paul gave in charge to Timothy. Nothing prohibited to the elders and pre&s;byters of our church, that he com|manded the elders to do, at Ephe&s;us."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Page 47, 48.</NOTE> Is this really the ca&s;e? Do not their bi&s;hops <HI>claim</HI> a power of admini&s;tering the &s;acraments, of bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper? But where will he find this mentioned in Paul's charge to Timothy? Do not the former <HI>claim</HI> the power of confirmation and ab&s;olution? But does Paul mention either, in his charge to the latter? The bi&s;hops in their church, <HI>claim</HI> the whole exclu&s;ive power of eccle&s;ia&s;tical
<PB N="138" REF="031609_0070_0FED5B48ADCADEB0">rule or government. But where do we find Paul giving this to Timothy? On the contrary, does he not expre&s;&s;ly <HI>charge</HI> him, that tho&s;e pre&s;byters he was to ordain, &s;hould be "men that ruled well their own hou&s;es, that they might be able to <HI>rule</HI> the church of God?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. ii. 4, 5.</NOTE> Does he not expre&s;&s;ly command, "let the elders who <HI>rule</HI> well be ac|counted worthy of double honour?"<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Chap. v. ver. 15.</NOTE> But what occa&s;ion for this, if the bi&s;hop had the &s;ole power of government? I add; where does he find the apo&s;tle <HI>charging</HI> his grace, Timothy lord bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us, "to entangle him&s;elf with the affairs of this life:"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ii. 4.</NOTE> To intermeddle, and bear a chief part in civil matters, to erect courts, and pre&s;ide in them, either in per&s;on, or by his <HI>lay</HI> chancel|lor, for the trial of all cau&s;es, te&s;tamentary and matrimonial, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.? And yet he knows a &s;et of bi&s;hops, pretending to be the only &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Timothy and the apo&s;tles, who actually <HI>claim</HI> and exerci&s;e all the fore-mentioned powers. Paul tells the Ephe&s;ian elders, "that the Holy Gho&s;t had made them pa&s;tors or bi&s;hops over the whole flock," and charges them to exerci&s;e the powers of &s;uch, to feed, to <HI>rule</HI> and govern this church as its proper bi&s;hops, to u&s;e their authority, if ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in a way of di&s;cipline, and prevent fal&s;e teachers creeping in, to draw away di&s;ciples: And is there any thing, I a&s;k, of this kind, <HI>allowed</HI> to Mr. L. and his brother-pre&s;byters in their church? Not in the lea&s;t. He him&s;elf knows, that by the rules and canons of his order, he is ab&s;olutely <HI>pro|hibited</HI> every thing of this kind.</P>
<P>THUS have I an&s;wered every thing material in this part of our author's defence;&mdash;particularly &s;hewed, from <HI>facts recorded in &s;cripture,</HI> that Ti|mothy neither was, nor could be a fixed bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us, &s;ettled there, with governing powers over the&s;e elders; but that this church was mo&s;t
<PB N="139" REF="031609_0070_0FED5B48ADCADEB0">evidently &s;ettled upon the pre&s;byterian plan,&mdash;that St. Paul when taking his leave of it, never to &s;ee it more, very expre&s;&s;ly left the intire guidance of it, not to a &s;ingle per&s;on, not to Timothy, but to the&s;e elders in a &s;tate of parity; con&s;equently, that this is the true &s;criptural plan of church order and government, and therefore, pre&s;byters, or ordina|ry pa&s;tors, in &s;uch &s;tate of equality, have the power of ordination, &amp;c. committed to them.</P>
<P>I HAVE nothing to add, but my mo&s;t earne&s;t wi&s;h and prayer, that the great head of the church would guide us into all truth, and in&s;pire all pro|te&s;tants, e&s;pecially go&s;pel mini&s;ters, with the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s, forbearance and charity towards each other, even though not exactly of one mind in all points; that &s;o, in&s;tead of worrying and cruelly condemning our fellow chri&s;tians, and thereby, giving advantage again&s;t us to the patrons of Po|pery, infidelity and irreligion; we may all cor|dially unite, in oppo&s;ing the common enemies of chri&s;tianity, and promoting the grand and import|ant truths, in which we all agree.</P>

<P>HIS next is from Eu&s;ebius. He, I own, is one of the <HI>fathers;</HI> but far from being an <HI>ancient</HI> one: For he lived in the fourth century. And as he him&s;elf tells us, in his hi&s;tory, "that he could trace no foot&s;teps of any going before him, only in a few narratives,"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. I. cap. 1.</NOTE> there is little dependence upon what he &s;ays, of things &s;o remote from his time. However, the pa&s;&s;age quoted is this:&mdash;"St. John, being by Domitian's death, relea&s;ed from bani&s;hment, returned, and took the care of the church of Ephe&s;us; and upon the invitation of the neighbouring <HI>churches, who had enjoyed only the mini&s;try of pre&s;byters and deacons,</HI> he went to them, and con&s;ecrated bi&s;hops," &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. L's def. page 49, 50.</NOTE> I have carefully examined the pa&s;&s;age in Eu&s;ebius, Mr. L. refers to; but find it very different from what he has quoted. None of the words, &s;et down in italics, are to be found in the original. The pa&s;|&s;age truly rendered, is as follows. Speaking of John, he &s;ays,&mdash;"After the tyrant's death, he re|turned to Ephe&s;us; and being invited &s;o to do, went al&s;o among the neighbouring nations, where he appointed bi&s;hops, e&s;tabli&s;hed regular and com|pleat churches, electing to the clerical office whom|&s;oever the Holy Gho&s;t pointed out for the &s;ame."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;eb. eccl. hi&s;t. Lib. III. cap. 23.</NOTE> Though I will not charge Mr. L. with di&s;hone&s;ty, in thus pretending to quote from Eu&s;ebius, what is not to be found in him; &s;ince 'tis po&s;&s;ible he might not have <HI>lei&s;ure to con&s;ult the original,</HI> but taking the tran&s;lation upon tru&s;t, &s;et down the pa&s;|&s;age as he found it, in &s;ome epi&s;copal writer; yet every one mu&s;t &s;ee, the words added, in Mr. L's
<PB N="141" REF="031609_0071_0FED5B4B85A9B500">quotation, intirely alter the &s;en&s;e of the pa&s;&s;age, and make it evident it was done, by <HI>&s;omebody,</HI> to favor epi&s;copacy, and impo&s;e upon the unlearned reader. With the addition of the words,&mdash;"who had enjoyed only the mini&s;try of pre&s;byters and deacons;" the pa&s;&s;age does indeed <HI>&s;eem</HI> to favour the doctrine of three orders in the mini&s;try; but let it be read without this corrupt addition, and then let the intelligent reader judge, what it is to Mr. L's purpo&s;e; or whether any other eight lines, taken at random, from Eu&s;ebius, or any other author, will not as effectually prove epi&s;copacy, as the&s;e here quoted? Stripped of this addition, the pa&s;&s;age mentions but one officer, viz. a bi&s;hop in the&s;e churches; and as that, in &s;cripture, means the &s;ame as pre&s;byter, by his own conce&s;&s;ion, it can be nothing to his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>HIS next quotation is from Irenaeus,&mdash;"That Polycarp was con&s;tituted by the apo&s;tles in A&s;ia, <HI>bi&s;hop</HI> of the church at Smyrna." An&s;wer:&mdash;St. Paul, who&s;e authority is at lea&s;t equal to that of Irenaeus, tells us, "that the Holy Gho&s;t con&s;tituted the elders of Ephe&s;us, <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> of the church of Ephe&s;us." If therefore Polycarp's being calle I bi&s;hop, proves him &s;uch in Mr. L's &s;en&s;e of the word; the&s;e elders mu&s;t be &s;o too. But then what becomes of his main argument for prelacy, from Timothy's being bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us? Or if he &s;till denies the&s;e elders to be bi&s;hops, though they are called &s;o, the &s;ame he mu&s;t do as to Poly|carp's. And &s;o this <HI>extract</HI> fails him al&s;o.</P>
<P>BUT he tells us, the de&s;ign of Irenaeus was to prove a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of apo&s;tolic doctrines, "but his argument is equally good in favor of a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion of bi&s;hops." And this, he &s;ays, will prove "that bi&s;hops were &s;uperior to pre&s;byters." An|&s;wer:&mdash;Not till he proves there were, be&s;ides the&s;e here called bi&s;hops, any pre&s;byters in that church for them "to be &s;uperior to." Irenaeus, in
<PB N="142" REF="031609_0072_0FED5B182697F970">the pa&s;&s;age quoted, mentions but one order only. This <HI>extract</HI> therefore, is &s;o far from helping Mr. L's &s;cheme of three orders, that it is wholly in favour of our's which has but one.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame an&s;wer al&s;o will &s;erve, for his three next <HI>extracts</HI> from Irenaeus. As there is no men|tion made in either of them, of more than one order, viz. bi&s;hops, nor the lea&s;t hint given con|cerning any other; it mu&s;t be pre&s;umed, that Irenaeus knew of none, but &s;uch bi&s;hops or pre&s;|byters as are mentioned in &s;cripture. Con&s;e|quently that the doctrine of three orders, and Mr. L's dioce&s;an bi&s;hop, was a &s;tranger in the time in which this father lived. I &s;hall only ju&s;t add:&mdash;That Mr. L's <HI>tran&s;lator,</HI> has again &s;erved him ill. For in the fir&s;t of the&s;e quotations the words of Irenaeus, as recited by Eu&s;ebius, are not "that Clement is he of whom mention is made Philip. iv. 3," as Mr. L. has it; but "that Linus is he, of whom Paul makes mention in his epi&s;tle to Timothy."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;eb. eccl. Hi&s;t. lib. v. cap. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>HIS next <HI>extract</HI> is from Jerom,&mdash;"Quid facit except&aacute; ordinatione, epi&s;copus, quod pre&s;byter non facit?" "What can a bi&s;hop do, except ordination, that a pre&s;byter may not do? Had Mr. L. an&s;wered this que&s;tion, according to his own principles, the reader would, at once, have &s;een, how very little it was to his purpo&s;e. For is there nothing in the church of England, ordi|nation excepted, but what is common to the pre&s;|byter and bi&s;hop? Certainly there is Mr. L's bi&s;hop can confirm, hold &s;piritual courts, exerci&s;e di&s;cipline, &amp;c. But is a pre&s;byter allowed to do tho&s;e? Nothing le&s;s. But Jerom does not even in&s;inuate, that <HI>ordination</HI> belongs only to the bi&s;h|op, by <HI>divine right.</HI> And had Mr. L. read the epi&s;tle, from whence the&s;e words are taken, he mu&s;t have &s;een, that the whole &s;cope of it is to
<PB N="143" REF="031609_0072_0FED5B182697F970">prove, that in the apo&s;tles times, bi&s;hop and pre&s;|byter were the &s;ame, both in name and office.&mdash;This he a&s;&s;erts, in &s;o many words, and proves it from the &s;ame texts and topics, as are u&s;ed by pre&s;byterians at this day; and then goes on to &s;hew, how, when, and upon what occa&s;ion the govern|ment of the church was altered afterwards. "That one was afterwards cho&s;en, who &s;hould be &s;et over the re&s;t, he tells us, was done as a remedy again&s;t &s;chi&s;m."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Hieron. Epi&s;. ad Evagr. Tom. II. p. 109.</NOTE> When therefore he u&s;es the words Mr. L. has quoted, he evidently does it to &s;hew "what was the practice of the church <HI>in his time;</HI>" not what prevailed in that of the apo&s;tles. 'Tis pity Mr. L. will not be at the pains of reading the fathers <HI>him&s;elf.</HI> It might, perhaps, &s;ave his friends many a blu&s;h upon his account.</P>
<P>THE next church he mentions, as upon the epi&s;|copal model, is that of Antioch. "In this, he tells us, was a number of believers, whom the apo&s;tles, Paul, and Barnabas, "took the govern|ment of for &s;ome time." Strange! Two bi&s;hops in one church at once! How different the <HI>modern</HI> epi&s;copacy from the <HI>ancient!</HI> Formerly one church could boa&s;t two bi&s;hops, and both apo&s;tles. But their <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ors,</HI> it &s;eems, have made &s;uch improve|ment in the prelatic art, that one bi&s;hop now will &s;erve for more than an hundred. This mu&s;t be ancient epi&s;copacy inverted. However, this was not the ca&s;e long. "Paul and Barnabas, he &s;ays, were &s;oon &s;ucceeded by Peter." What, Peter bi&s;h|op of Antioch! We tho't he had been metropo|litan of Rome. But this was not long. "Euodius &s;oon takes his place; to whom &s;ucceeded Ignatius;" who&s;e epi&s;tles, we are told, contain the very mo|del and marrow of modern epi&s;copacy. Accord|ingly our author is longer upon this favourite pa|tron, than all the re&s;t of the fathers; though I
<PB N="144" REF="031609_0073_0FED5AFCDB313E20">think he gives us but one or two <HI>extracts</HI> from him, and them but &s;hort.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 52, 53.54, 55, 56.</NOTE></P>
<P>As to the epi&s;tles a&s;cribed to Ignatius, Mr. L. mu&s;t know, if he has read Dr. Chauncy's &s;ermon, that they lie under very &s;trong &s;u&s;picions of for|gery, or at lea&s;t of great adulteration and corrup|tion. This the Dr. largely &s;hews in his appendix, and offers &s;uch arguments in &s;upport of the charge, as makes it, at lea&s;t very highly probable, if not certain this was the ca&s;e. The&s;e, Mr. L. does not attempt to an&s;wer. He indeed tells us, "that bi&s;hops Beveridge and Pear&s;on have fully confuted, Me&s;&s;rs. Daille, L'arroque, and all others, in what|ever they have advanced again&s;t the&s;e epi&s;tles."&mdash;And I can tell him "that L'arroque undertook to an&s;wer Beveridge and Pear&s;on, as appears by a manu&s;cript found among his papers, in which he had made great progre&s;s; but at the <HI>de&s;ire</HI> of &s;eve|ral per&s;ons, who <HI>leaned too much to be epi&s;copal cau&s;e,</HI> he did not fini&s;h this reply."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Nov. Rep. Lit. Tout. l. Art. 5, p. 56, 57.</NOTE> A victory obtained by &s;uch arts as the&s;e, can do no great honour to the conquerors. This &s;tory, Mr. L. if he plea&s;es, may confront with his, concerning Bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndel in page 69 of his book.</P>
<P>BUT if we &s;hould allow the&s;e epi&s;tles to be ge|nuine, they will really make nothing in favour of dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy, but much again&s;t it. 'Tis true, they frequently mention bi&s;hops, pre&s;byters, and deacons: But then it is equally true, that the bi&s;hop de&s;cribed in the&s;e, was e&s;&s;entially different from the dioce&s;an one. The "Ignatian bi&s;hop" pre&s;ided over but one &s;ingle church, was there|fore no more than a congregational bi&s;hop, or pa&s;tor of a particular church: Whereas the dioce|&s;an one, pre&s;ides over many &s;cores or hundreds of congregations. Again,&mdash;the former had much the &s;ame authority over his pre&s;byters, as the rector
<PB N="145" REF="031609_0073_0FED5AFCDB313E20">of a pari&s;h, in the church of England, has over his a&s;&s;i&s;tant curates, who are not pretended to be of a different order, but have <HI>radically</HI> the &s;ame power with the rector: But the church of England bi&s;hop, is a&s;&s;erted to be a different order from the pre&s;byter; by divine right, &s;uperior to him, and ve&s;ted with the &s;ole power of ordination and go|vernment. A few <HI>extracts</HI> from the&s;e epi&s;tles will &s;erve to prove this. "Let all follow the bi&s;hop as Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and the pre&s;byters, as the apo&s;|tles."&mdash;"Let none do any of tho&s;e things which belong to the church without the bi&s;hop."&mdash;"Where the bi&s;hop appears, let the multitude, or congregation be."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ignat.

But it is impo&s;&s;ible for a modern dioce&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome hundreds of congrega|tions, to attend divine &s;ervice in one place.</P>
<P>AGAIN:&mdash;It is plain, from the&s;e epi&s;tles, that the &s;acraments were not to be admini&s;tered, but in the pre&s;ence of the bi&s;hop.

But now, how different is the ca&s;e from this in the church of England? There, one bi&s;hop has many &s;cores or hundreds of communion tables in his dioce&s;e, and a great many thou&s;and com|municants; for whom it would be ab&s;olutely im|po&s;&s;ible, to attend the communion at one table, with their bi&s;hop, and receive the con&s;ecrated ele|ments, at his hands, or in his pre&s;ence.</P>

<P>I MIGHT ea&s;ily fill &s;everal pages with extracts to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. But the&s;e are abundantly &s;uffi|cient to &s;hew, that the bi&s;hop de&s;cribed in the&s;e epi&s;tles, was not, could not be a dioce&s;an bi&s;hop, but only a pa&s;tor of a &s;ingle congregation, agree|able

<P>IN the church of Alexandria, it appears from Jerom, that pre&s;byters actually <HI>ordained,</HI> for two hundred years, from the fir&s;t planting of it.

If pre&s;byters therefore could appoint and con&s;ecrate their bi&s;hop, I hope it will be allowed that they had power to ordain a brother-prre&s;byter; con&s;equently that <HI>pre&s;byterian</HI> ordination was the original e&s;tabli&s;hment there.</P>
<P>THAT the ancient Gallic or French church was pre&s;byterian, appears from what I have already quoted from Irenaeus, pa&s;tor of the church of Ly|ons in France. With him, pre&s;byter and bi&s;hop are the &s;ame office, as they are al&s;o in &s;cripture.

Be&s;ides, they are te&s;timonies &s;ome ten or twelve hundred years too late, to be depended upon, as authentic vouchers in this ca&s;e.

But if he was, how does this prove that he him&s;elf received epi&s;copal ordination? This, if I under&s;tand it, is Mr. L's argument: Titus him&s;elf was a bi&s;hop; therefore, he was ordained by one, or had epi&s;copal ordina|tion. But how does this follow? Paul and Timo|thy, he allows, were bi&s;hops: And yet, it has been proved, and that from &s;cripture, that they were both ordained by pre&s;byters. And from Jerom it appears, that he whom they called bi&s;hop, in the church of Alexandria, was cho&s;en from among, and &s;et apart to his epi&s;copal office by his pre&s;by|ters of that church, for two hundred years, in the beginning of it.</P>
<P>AN example of epi&s;copal ordination, not from &s;cripture, but from the fathers of the two fir&s;t centuries, was what was demanded. Mr. L. &s;ays he could produce many. Why has he not then done it? Was it for want of inclination, or ability?&mdash; Doubtle&s;s the latter.

<HEAD>SEC. IX. <HI>Examination of Mr.</HI> L's <HI>appeal to the fir&s;t reformers for his divine right of epi&s;co|pacy,</HI>&mdash;from page 61 to 65.</HEAD>
<P>IN both the pieces Mr. L. undertook to an&s;wer, it was ob&s;erved, that this doctrine "of the un|alterable divine right of epi&s;copacy," was a &s;tran|ger to the fir&s;t reformers, even in the church of England. This was done with a view to expo&s;e the bigotry of tho&s;e anathematizing zealots, the modern &s;ons of that church, who, like Mr. L. un|church and unchri&s;tianize all the prote&s;tant world but them&s;elves. Sundry te&s;timonies were adduced, from the fir&s;t reformers and latter writers of the church of England, both bi&s;hops and others, to prove that this was not the doctrine of that church, at the time of the reformation, and many years after.&mdash;That though for <HI>rea&s;ons of &s;tate,</HI> they con|curred with the epi&s;copal &s;ettlement in England; yet they did not look upon it to be of divine right, or &s;o e&s;&s;ential as to nullify all ordinations, unle&s;s tho&s;e performed by bi&s;hops, in their &s;en&s;e of the word. And it was particularly &s;hewed, that the fir&s;t who publicly maintained that un|charitable anti-chri&s;tian doctrine, was the famous arch-bi&s;hop Laud, of papi&s;tical and per&s;ecuting memory; and that he was publicly rebuked by his &s;uperior for &s;o doing.</P>
<P>MR. L. declares him&s;elf of the &s;ame principles, and undertakes to defend them, by an appeal to the fir&s;t reformers. Let us examine his proofs.</P>
<P>HIS fir&s;t is from arch-bi&s;hop Cranmer, in the&s;e
<PB N="165" REF="031609_0083_0FED5B4150902878">words, "We read not that any, not being a bi&s;hop, hath, &s;ince the beginning of Chri&s;t's church, or|dained a prie&s;t." If by bi&s;hop, is here meant a congregational bi&s;hop, all pre&s;byterians will agree, that none but &s;uch have power to ordain: But then it will be nothing to Mr. L's purpo&s;e.&mdash;But if a dioce&s;an bi&s;hop is intended, then all that Cranmer can be &s;uppo&s;ed to mean is, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of ordaining has been confined to &s;uch bi&s;hops, not as &s;olely ve&s;ted with that power by the law of Chri&s;t; but only by human appointment, and the cu&s;tom of the church. For bi&s;hop Burnet a&s;&s;ures us, that Cranmer's opinion was,&mdash;"That bi&s;hops and prie&s;ts, were at one time, and were not two things, but one office, in the beginning of Chri&s;t's religion."
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Refor. Vol. I. collec. page 223.</NOTE> If they had one office, they had one and the &s;ame power: All therefore, that Cranmer intends is, that this work of ordination, which was originally common, had been, by the cu&s;tom of the church, appropriated to bi&s;hops. This interpretation makes Cranmer con&s;i&s;tent, whereas Mr. L's involves him in a plain contradiction.</P>
<P>HIS next <HI>extract</HI> is from bi&s;hop Jewel, in the&s;e words,&mdash;"We believe that there be divers degrees of mini&s;ters in the church, whereof &s;ome be dea|cons, &s;ome prie&s;ts, &s;ome bi&s;hops." That Jewel here only a&s;&s;erts a matter of fact, or what were the officers then in the church, not a matter of right, or what ought to be by divine in&s;titution, is evi|dent from what he &s;ays in his apology. Speaking of the various degrees of the clergy in Jerom's time, he &s;ays,&mdash;"Chri&s;t appointed not the&s;e di&s;|tinctions of orders from the beginning."&mdash;"This is the thing <HI>we defend,</HI> St. Jerom &s;aith, let bi&s;hops under&s;tand, they are in authority over prie&s;ts, more by cu&s;tom, than by order of God's truth. A prie&s;t is the &s;ame with a bi&s;hop; they are both one thing, and the churches were at fir&s;t, governed by the
<PB N="166" REF="031609_0084_0FED5B639AD48BA8">common advice of prie&s;ts."
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Apol. part. 2, c. 3.</NOTE> This plainly &s;hews that in the pa&s;&s;age quoted by Mr. L. he does not mean to declare his <HI>belief</HI> of the <HI>divine right</HI> of three orders; but only to a&s;&s;ert a matter of fact; and &s;o is no proof that Jewel owned the divine right of epi&s;copacy.</P>
<P>BUT Mr. L. &s;uppo&s;es, this is proved to be the doctrine of the reformers, from the preface to the book of ordination. "It is evident to all men diligently reading the holy &s;criptures, &amp;c.&mdash;that there have been the&s;e <HI>three</HI> orders of mini&s;ters," &amp;c.
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Page 63.</NOTE> Upon which he ob&s;erves,&mdash;"It mu&s;t be evident to any man of common &s;en&s;e, that the reformers, who compo&s;ed this preface, believed the three offices of bi&s;hops, prie&s;ts and deacons, to be of divine right, or none of them to be &s;o; for they as po&s;itively a&s;&s;ert that all are, as that one is." An&s;wer:&mdash;They do not a&s;&s;ert that this one is. This preface only a&s;&s;erts a matter of fact; that there had been &s;uch orders from the apo&s;tles times. It does not declare that the&s;e three orders are of divine unalterable right:&mdash;Nor does it determine what kind of bi&s;hops were from the apo&s;tles times, whether dioce&s;an, or only parochial. And if Me&s;&s;rs. Hoadly and Ollyffe, two epi&s;copal divines, may be allowed to under&s;tand the &s;en&s;e of this a&s;|&s;ertion, as well as Mr. L. it will be nothing to his purpo&s;e. Mr. Ollyffe in his an&s;wer to Mr. Cala|my, &s;peaking of this very preface, &s;ays,&mdash;"The propo&s;ition of this rubrick is formed or expre&s;&s;ed, with as great a degree of latitude or moderation, as ever could be expected, from an epi&s;copal church. <HI>It &s;aith nothing of divine right or appointment.</HI> That is Mr. Calamy's addition, as Mr. Hoadly well ob|&s;erves. It &s;aith nothing of the di&s;tinction of their powers and officers; or whether they have been eve|ry where in every church or no: But only, that from the apo&s;tles times, there have been the&s;e orders,
<PB N="167" REF="031609_0084_0FED5B639AD48BA8">&amp;c.&mdash;From which, the mo&s;t that can be inferred is, that in &s;uch churches where there has been need of them, or occa&s;ion for them all, there have been three &s;uch ranks of mini&s;ters, for the government and in&s;truction of Chri&s;t's church, from the times of the apo&s;tles; which yet by Mr. Calamy's leave, <HI>does not prove a divine appointment</HI> of all, (however otherwi&s;e it may appear to him) there having been other things, in the apo&s;tles days, which yet, for all that, are not allowed to be of divine appointment." Here we &s;ee Mr. L's uncharitable interpretation of this preface, as though it meant to nullify all ordinations, &s;ave tho&s;e of the epi&s;co|pal kind, &s;tands expre&s;&s;ly condemned, by two celebrated divines of his own church. As their interpretation is more charitable and chri&s;tian-like, than Mr. L's; I pre&s;ume every per&s;on of candor will judge it the true one; and con&s;equently, that his argument, founded on &s;uch a &s;tingy interpre|tation, can't be admitted as proof, that the vene|rable compilers of this preface, were of his con|tracted and &s;chi&s;matical principles.</P>
<P>THOUGH they here &s;peak of three orders in the church, yet they no where &s;ay, that bi&s;hops are by divine right, &s;uperior to pre&s;byters:&mdash;Nor is there the lea&s;t intimation, that they looked upon all ordinations to be null and void, unle&s;s per|formed by a bi&s;hop. For though they &s;ay "no man &s;hall be accounted a lawful bi&s;hop, unle&s;s admitted according to the form there pre&s;cribed;" yet this is expre&s;ily limitted <HI>"to that church of England."</HI> All therefore that can be meant by this, is no more than a declaration, who they will allow to be accounted <HI>lawful bi&s;hops of the national church of England:</HI> But this is no proof that they believed the divine right and ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy, or accounted tho&s;e churches to have no valid mini&s;try and ordinances, that are without it, as Mr. L. does. The contrary of this,
<PB N="168" REF="031609_0085_0FED5B5148FBA6F0">is undeniably evident from their practice, as I &s;hall &s;hew.</P>
<P>OUR author's la&s;t argument, to prove that the <HI>reformers</HI> were of his uncharitable &s;entiments, in this point, is taken from the 3d, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 11th, canons of their church, which he has quoted at large.
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 63, 64, 65.</NOTE></P>
<P>As the canons of the church of England, as they now &s;tand, were compo&s;ed at &s;undry times; at periods far di&s;tant one from another; &s;ome in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, &s;ome in that of King James, &amp;c.&mdash;Mr. L. &s;hould have told us which cla&s;s, tho&s;e he has quoted belonged to: For if they were among the number of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ed in King James's reign; they can't be &s;aid to exhibit the &s;entiments of the <HI>fir&s;t reformers,</HI> who had no hand in making them, being dead many years before. As he has not &s;een fit to do this, I might ju&s;tly forbear any further notice of them, as being noth|ing to the purpo&s;e of his argument.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, allowing they were of the fir&s;t cla&s;s, they will by no means prove, that the compilers of them believed the unalterable divine right of epi&s;copacy, and denied the validity of pre&s;byterian ordination. The &s;ub&s;tance of them is, (for they are too long to tran&s;cribe) "that if any per&s;on &s;hould deny the church of England to be a true church, or declare her government by bi&s;hops, &amp;c. to be anti-chri&s;tian, or repugnant to the word of God, or upon that account, or any other, &s;eparate him&s;elf from her communion, he &s;hall be <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> excommunicated." But now there is nothing in the&s;e canons, that will prove the authors of them believed dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy, to be of unalterable divine right. They might think it to be <HI>lawful,</HI> though not expre&s;&s;ly of <HI>divine in&s;titution;</HI> much le&s;s that it was <HI>ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to the being of the church.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="031609_0085_0FED5B5148FBA6F0">
As to the <HI>charity</HI> of &s;uch excommunicating, anathematizing canons, I mu&s;t leave it to the vin|dication of Mr. L. and tho&s;e of his &s;tamp: For as to my&s;elf, I utterly de&s;pair of &s;ucceeding in any attempt of that kind. Americans, ble&s;&s;ed be God, have hitherto been unacquainted with &s;uch <HI>damna|tory</HI> canons.

Per|haps his de&s;ign was to let us know what we are to expect, if the &s;cheme for &s;ending bi&s;hops to Amer|ica, erecting &s;piritual courts, &amp;c. in the colonies, &s;hould take place.&mdash;But to return:&mdash;</P>
<P>THE above remarks, I tru&s;t, make it &s;ufficiently clear, that it cannot be proved, either from the preface to the book of ordination, or from the canons, or indeed from any thing el&s;e Mr. L. has quoted, that the reformers were of his &s;entiments, as to the divine right of epi&s;copacy. They con|formed to the epi&s;copal church, as e&s;tabli&s;hed by the king and parliament, as what they tho't <HI>lawful,</HI> though not <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> in it&s;elf, or of any &s;criptural or divine appointment.&mdash;That they did not look upon it as of divine in&s;titution, is evident,&mdash;</P>

<P>THESE things, I mentioned in my &s;ermon, to which Mr. L. has made no reply. I now &s;ubmit it to the candid reader, whether it is po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e, that men who could expre&s;s them&s;elves in this manner, were of Mr. L's principles, "that dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy is of divine right," "and that all ordinations by pre&s;byters, are a mere nullity."</P>
<P>MR. L's letter-writer, S. J. tells us,&mdash;"the &s;entiments of the fir&s;t reformers, are not to be learnt from &s;ome tran&s;ient expre&s;&s;ions of indivi|duals, but from their public acts." I have here produced in&s;tances of both, in which, as indivi|duals, and as public bodies, they give their te&s;ti|mony for the &s;criptural divine rights of pre&s;byte|rian ordination and government, in terms, as ex|pre&s;s and po&s;itive, as can well be conceived.&mdash; From the&s;e te&s;timonies it evidently follows, that epi&s;copacy was not e&s;tabli&s;hed in England, at the time of the reformation, upon the foot of <HI>divine right;</HI> but only as a form of government, &s;uited to the civil in&s;titution of the &s;tate by which it was e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS fact further appears from the <HI>practice</HI> of the church of England, con&s;equent upon &s;aid e&s;|tabli&s;hment. It is not denied that there have been &s;ome particular members of that church, all along, from the <HI>pontificate</HI> of arch-bi&s;hop Laud, to the pre&s;ent day, who, like Mr. L. have e&s;pou&s;ed this uncharitable doctrine <HI>of the divine right</HI> of epi&s;co|pacy, and the invalidity of all mini&s;terial authority and go&s;pel admini&s;trations, where this is wanting. But that this is not the <HI>doctrine of the church of England,</HI> appears from her repeated practice to the contrary, in admitting mini&s;ters to officiate in that church, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> had epi&s;copal ordination. In the reign of King Edward the &s;ixth, Mr. Knox was improved by him, as his chaplain, and had
<PB N="172" REF="031609_0087_0FED5B1DDC26D150">the offer of a bi&s;hoprick, though he had nothing but pre&s;byterian ordination, and not even that, if Mr. L. &s;ays true. In the &s;ame reign, Peter Mar|tyr, Martin Bucer, and P. Fagius, all foreigners, and who had been ordained only by pre&s;byters, had eccle&s;ia&s;tical pre&s;erments in the church of En|gland conferred upon them, without re-ordinati|on.
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Owen's Plea for Scrip. Ordina. page 118.</NOTE> Mr. William Whitingham was made dean of Durham, about 1563, though ordained by pre&s;|byters only.
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. page 121.</NOTE> In like manner, Mr. Travers, or|dained by a pre&s;byter beyond &s;ea, was &s;even years lecturer at the temple, and had the bi&s;hop of Lon|don's letter for it.

<P>Now is it not abundantly evident from the&s;e <HI>facts,</HI> that the church of England, <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> is not of Mr. L's principles, as to the point in debate? He a&s;&s;erts the <HI>divine right</HI> of epi&s;copacy, and utterly denies the <HI>validity</HI> of pre&s;byterian ordination:&mdash; But here we &s;ee, the church of England, and her greate&s;t dignitaries and bi&s;hops, not only a&s;&s;erting in words, the <HI>validity</HI> of pre&s;byterian ordination; but repeatedly declaring this, to be the <HI>&s;en&s;e and doctrine</HI> of that church, by admitting, from time to time, tho&s;e who had no other ordination, to the free exerci&s;e of the mini&s;try, and placing them in the highe&s;t offices in the church. Whom now &s;hall we believe? Mr. L. who pretends, from the rubrick and canons of this church, to prove that &s;he holds the unchri&s;tian, &s;chi&s;matical doctrine afore|&s;aid? Or &s;he her&s;elf, who by her practice, denies it? Mu&s;t we not &s;uppo&s;e, that the fir&s;t reformers, the bi&s;hops and dignitaries of the church of England,
<PB N="173" REF="031609_0087_0FED5B1DDC26D150">under&s;tand her con&s;titution and principles, as well as the <HI>mi&s;&s;ionary</HI> of Norwalk?&mdash;But,&mdash;</P>
<P N="3">3. THAT pre&s;byterian ordination is valid, even in the &s;en&s;e of the church of England, is evident, <HI>from the mo&s;t public and expre&s;s acts of the king and parliament.</HI> The church of England is properly a parliamentary church. She expre&s;&s;ly acknowledges the king <HI>as her head, inve&s;ted with &s;upreme power in all affairs, eccle&s;ia&s;tical.</HI> Her articles and canons are all enjoined, by authority of parliament.

But now the validity of pre&s;byterian ordination has, in fact, been owned and e&s;tabli&s;hed, by the king and par|liament, at two &s;everal times, Soon after the <HI>re&s;|toration,</HI> A. D. 1661, there was an act of parlia|ment pa&s;&s;ed, "declaring and confirming tho&s;e to be mini&s;ters, to all intents and purpo&s;es," who were then <HI>incumbents</HI> in the &s;everal pari&s;hes; tho' many of them had been ordained, after the bi&s;hops were put down in the preceding admini&s;tration, and &s;o had only pre&s;byterian ordination.

<P>AGAIN:&mdash;The &s;ame was done, A. D. 1707, by the act of <HI>union,</HI> whereby England and Scot|land were united into one kingdom. Previous to this, the parliament of Scotland pa&s;&s;ed "an act, for &s;ecuring the prote&s;tant religion, and pre&s;byte|rian church-government in Scotland, to po&s;terity." &mdash;Now this act was made an e&s;&s;ential and funda|mental part of the act of union, and &s;o is confirmed by the king and parliament of Great-Britain, and thereby, the pre&s;byterian order and government of the church of Scotland is as fully to all intents and purpo&s;es, e&s;tabli&s;hed there, and by the &s;ame authority, as epi&s;copacy is in England. Accord|ingly, ever &s;ince that time, every king of Great-Britain,

<P>HERE again we &s;ee, the &s;upreme authority of the nation, king, lords, and commons, <HI>expre&s;&s;ly</HI> allow|ing the religion of the church of Scotland, and her <HI>pre&s;byterian</HI> form of government, <HI>to be the true pro|te&s;tant religion.</HI> As &s;uch, they e&s;tabli&s;h it to perpe|tuity; and the king, by his <HI>coronation</HI> oath, mo&s;t &s;olemnly promi&s;es and &s;wears, to protect and de|&s;end it. But how could all this be, if the church of England, and the king as the head of it, really <HI>believed,</HI> as Mr. L. &s;ays they do, the divine right of epi&s;copacy, and the <HI>unlawfulne&s;s and nullity</HI> of pre&s;byterian ordination and government?&mdash;Mu&s;t not the king and parliament, who are properly the church of England, be &s;uppo&s;ed to under&s;tand her con&s;titution, on which &s;he was &s;ettled at the reformation, and the doctrines &s;he maintains, as well as Mr. L.?

<PB N="175" REF="031609_0088_0FED5B2AC3FB8030">time of the reformation, or a doctrine &s;ince owned by her, as &s;uch. What ra&s;hne&s;s, what effrontery then, is Mr. L. chargeable with, in &s;o confidently a&s;&s;erting, as he does, "that the body of the church of England divines, at the time of the reformation, and I may &s;ay, ever &s;ince, have con&s;tantly believ|ed and maintained, the divine right of epi&s;copa|cy?" 'Tis pity gentlemen of &s;uch uncharitable and &s;chi&s;matical principles, can't be contented, &s;ince it mu&s;t be &s;o, to enjoy their un&s;criptural no|tions them&s;elves, without vainly attempting to fix the odious imputation upon others, and thus black|ening the memory of the good old reformers, who dete&s;ted the&s;e doctrines equally with us.</P>
<P>UPON the whole then, if any weight is to be laid upon the mo&s;t expre&s;s declarations of many great and learned men of the church of England, bi&s;hops as well as others, at the time of the refor|mation, and &s;ince, <HI>in their individual capacity,</HI> in favour of <HI>the validity of pre&s;byterian ordination and government;</HI>&mdash;if any heed is to be given to the re|peated in&s;tances, in which that church has, by her <HI>practice,</HI> owned and approved of that doctrine;&mdash; if any regard is to be had to <HI>public acts of parlia|ment,</HI> acknowledging and declaring pre&s;byterian churches and mini&s;ters, to be <HI>true, lawful, prote&s;tant mini&s;ters and churches;</HI> it mu&s;t be a mo&s;t clear and indubitable fact, that the church of England, nei|ther at the time of the reformation, nor &s;ince, hath e&s;pou&s;ed and maintained the doctrine of the <HI>divine right of epi&s;copacy;</HI> but on the contrary does <HI>ex|pre&s;&s;ly</HI> own the <HI>lawfulne&s;s</HI> and <HI>validity</HI> of pre&s;byte|rian ordination and government.

<HEAD>SEC. X. <HI>Animadver&s;ions on Mr.</HI> L's <HI>appeal to the foreign prote&s;tants, concerning the va|lidity of pre&s;byterian ordination,</HI>&mdash; page 63, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN this part of his work, our author pretends to give us &s;undry <HI>extracts</HI> from the foreign pro|te&s;tants: Not indeed to prove, that the&s;e foreign churches are of the epi&s;copal kind. This he knew was impo&s;&s;ible: But though they are pre&s;byteri|ans them&s;elves, yet that they do not allow our ordinations to be valid. Now, granting his quo|tations from Calvin, Beza, Le Mayne, &amp;c. to be genuine; which, con&s;idering the freedom he u&s;es with other authors, is at lea&s;t very doubtful; they will by no means prove that the&s;e men denied the validity of ordination, even among the di&s;&s;enters in England. What they &s;eem to blame the old puritans for, is their &s;eparating from the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed church of England, not for maintaining pre&s;|byterian principles. Be&s;ides, it is well known what arts were u&s;ed in them times, by the &s;ticklers for uniformity, to &s;olicit the opinion of foreign prote&s;tants in their favour, and get them to di&s;|countenance the &s;eparation. "About this time, &s;everal letters pa&s;&s;ed, between the Engli&s;h divines, on both &s;ides, and &s;everal learned foreigners.&mdash; Matters were fal&s;ely repre&s;ented to them, and great arts were u&s;ed, on the <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> &s;ide, to prevent &s;uch per&s;ons writing, who they found would not write in their behalf; and what they thought made for them, they publi&s;hed to the world in way of tri|umph.
<PB N="177" REF="031609_0089_0FED5B4302DBBC38">The foreigners were told, that unle&s;s they complied with the things enjoined, they mu&s;t let in the papi&s;ts to &s;upply the cures. Several foreigners therefore dreading that, and hoping the&s;e things would &s;oon be altered, &s;pake more favorable of them than they de&s;erved."
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pierce's Vind. page 68.</NOTE> Moreover, the&s;e foreign divines knew, that epi&s;copacy was &s;ettled in Eng|land, not as of <HI>divine right,</HI> but only by <HI>civil au|thority.</HI> Having this view of the Engli&s;h hierar|chy, they might think it more advi&s;able for their brethren in England, to &s;ubmit to it, than to go into a &s;eparation <HI>barely upon this account.</HI> For it is only on account of <HI>this,</HI> that they are, in Mr. L's quotations, &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;eparate, and for which they are blamed. Whereas this was but one thing, among many, that cau&s;ed the &s;eparation. But what bu&s;ine&s;s had Mr. L. with the di&s;&s;enters of England? The pieces he attacks, undertook the defence of the New-England mini&s;try, not that of the di&s;&s;enters in England. There was no need of it. This has been repeatedly and &s;ucce&s;sfully done by many able writers of their own. Particularly by Me&s;&s;rs. Baxter, Calamy, Pierce, and more lately the di&s;&s;ent|ing gentlemen in an&s;wer to Mr. White. Be&s;ides, who does he mean by "the di&s;&s;enters in this coun|try?" If he intends New-England; bating a few anabapti&s;ts and quakers, I know of no di&s;&s;enters, &s;ave tho&s;e of his communion. Epi&s;copacy never was e&s;tabli&s;hed here, though its oppo&s;ite is, to the no &s;mall mortification of our author and company. If therefore, the foreign divines had &s;uch a regard to peace, as to advi&s;e their pre&s;byterian brethren in England not to &s;eparate, even from an epi&s;co|pal church, by law e&s;tabli&s;hed: Who can &s;uppo&s;e they would not condemn Mr. L. and party, in &s;eparating from the <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed pre&s;byterian churches</HI> here, and becoming <HI>epi&s;copal di&s;&s;enters?</HI> Where|fore,
<PB N="178" REF="031609_0090_0FED321A2CCEA078">to come to the que&s;tion, as he has &s;tated it; that is, "whether our ordinations in this country are allowed to be valid by the foreign prote&s;tants?"

<P N="1">1.

<P>Now can there be a more full and convincing
<PB N="180" REF="031609_0091_0FED5B44B2049890">evidence, of the&s;e foreign churches allowing of the validity of our ordination, than this univer&s;al agreement and te&s;timony of their public con&s;titu|tions in this point? Mr. L. and tho&s;e of his &s;tamp, though they renounce our ordinations, yet allow of tho&s;e performed in the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> church. The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e the principles of the papi&s;ts, in this re&s;pect, are the &s;ame with theirs. Epi&s;copacy is the doctrine of the church of Rome; the church of England therefore allow their ordinations to be valid, as being the &s;ame with her own. But now, with an evidence beyond exception it appears, that all the foreign prote&s;tants are &s;trictly of our prin|ciples, as to the ordaining power; from whence it undeniably follows, that they mu&s;t allow and approve of our ordinations, as valid, becau&s;e they are the very &s;ame as are pointed out, in all their confe&s;&s;ions of faith.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS point is al&s;o evident from the univer|&s;al <HI>practice</HI> of the foreign churches. All the Dutch churches throughout the united provinces, the prote&s;tant churches in France, tho&s;e of Geneva and the prote&s;tant cantons in Switzerland, &amp;c.&mdash; are utter &s;trangers to bi&s;hops, both name and thing. All their clergy are upon a level; all equally ex|erci&s;ing the power of ordination, and every other branch of mini&s;terial authority. And as to tho&s;e prote&s;tant churches which have officers they &s;tile bi&s;hops, &s;uperintendants or &s;eniors; they are lit|tle more than &s;tanding moderators, pretending to no &s;uperiority, by divine right, over their breth|ren. "All the&s;e churches, &s;ays Dr. Stillingfleet, acknowledge no &s;uch thing as the <HI>divine right</HI> of epi&s;copacy, but &s;tiffly maintain Jerom's opinion, of the primitive equality of all go&s;pel-mini&s;ters."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Iren. page 411.</NOTE> &mdash;Nor can they do otherwi&s;e; having at bottom no other than pre&s;byterian ordination among them: For Luther, Calvin, Bucer, Melancthon, Bugenha|gius,
<PB N="181" REF="031609_0091_0FED5B44B2049890">&amp;c.&mdash;and the fir&s;t reformers and founders of the&s;e churches, who ordained mini&s;ters among them, were them&s;elves pre&s;byters and nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS again clearly proves, that they do in fact allow our ordinations to be valid; for they are the &s;ame with theirs. Theirs are performed by pre&s;|byters, pa&s;tors, by divine right, all in a &s;tate of equality: The &s;ame al&s;o are ours. If therefore, they allow their own, they mu&s;t allow ours, which are the &s;ame. And that this is the ca&s;e in fact, is evident from particular in&s;tances of their practice. In Holland, tho' they allow a liberty of con&s;cience to tho&s;e of other denominations, yet no mini&s;ters are &s;upported by the public, but tho&s;e of their own profe&s;&s;ion: But it is an undoubted truth, as I am informed, that they do in fact &s;upport one or more Scotch pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters, ju&s;t as they do their own. This plainly &s;hews, that they look upon the pre&s;byters in Scotland, as their brethren, of the &s;ame church with them&s;elves, and undeni|ably proves, that they allow of their ordination, and con&s;equently of ours in this country, which is the &s;ame. The Dutch churches therefore in Europe, beyond di&s;pute allow the validity of our ordinations. In America the ca&s;e is the &s;ame.&mdash; Here there are &s;undry Dutch churches, originating from, and upon the &s;ame con&s;titution, with the reformed prote&s;tant churches in Holland. The&s;e allow the validity of our ordinations. A number of years ago, a young gentleman of Dutch extract, came to New-Haven, and was ordained by our mini&s;ters, at the College there, as a mini&s;ter for the Dutch churches in the county of Albany.&mdash; This, as my author tells me, was done by order of the cla&s;&s;is in Holland. The Rev. Mr. Woo&s;ly, who was ordained by a number of Connecticut mini&s;ters, over the church and congregation of Southold, on Long-I&s;land; after he left that peo|ple, and removed to his plantation, in Oy&s;ter-Bay,
<PB N="182" REF="031609_0092_0FED5B21AFA91878">preached and admini&s;tered the &s;acrament, in a Dutch church in that town, for twenty years to|gether. The &s;ame did the Rev'd Mr. Ketteltas &s;ince. He was ordained mini&s;ter of Elizabeth-Town, by the pre&s;bytery in New-Jer&s;ey. After he left that people, at the invitation of &s;undry Dutch churches in Queen's-County, Long-I&s;land, he officiated as their mini&s;ter for &s;ome time. The &s;ame gentleman is now improved in the mini&s;try, in the French prote&s;tant church in the city of New-York. Now the&s;e are &s;o many expre&s;s in|&s;tances, in which our ordinations have been, in fact, acknowledged and allowed to be valid by the foreign prote&s;tant churches. And yet in direct oppo&s;ition to this inconte&s;tible evidence, in the very face of the&s;e &s;tubborn and ob&s;tinate facts, Mr. L. has the a&s;&s;urance, &s;hall I call it? To tell his readers "that none of the&s;e foreign prote&s;tants, (meaning the Dutch, French, &amp;c.) will admit of a man ordained by <HI>our di&s;&s;enters,</HI> (as he calls us by way of contempt) to admini&s;ter the &s;acraments in their churches." "That they condemn, and find as much fault with our ordinations, as the epi&s;|copalians (meaning him&s;elf and tho&s;e of his high-flying principles) do." "And that our mode of wor&s;hip, &amp;c. is condemned by all the foreign pro|te&s;tants."

The ca&s;e was this:&mdash;One J. Antonius Caracciolus, bi&s;hop of Troyes, turned prote&s;t|ant, and appeared before the prote&s;tant con&s;i&s;tory, de|&s;iring to be admitted to the mini&s;try. And although he had &s;olemnly renounced and abjured his Romi&s;h princi|ples, and in the pre&s;ence of the con&s;i&s;tory, &s;igned his ab|juration of them, and his con&s;ent to the prote&s;tant con|fe&s;&s;ion of faith; yet they would not receive him as a mini&s;ter, until he expre&s;sly promi&s;ed <HI>to de&s;ert and for&s;ake his epi&s;copal function.</HI> This he accordingly did; where|upon he was received into the mini&s;try. This was done by the advice of that great and good man, Peter Martyr, who happened to be there at that time, in his way to Zu|rich. This therefore &s;hews his opinion of epi&s;copacy.</NOTE> If the&s;e te&s;timonies, from the <HI>public in&s;titutions,</HI> the <HI>univer&s;al practice,</HI> and the <HI>private &s;entiments</HI> of the foreign prote&s;tants, do not amount to a full proof of their being &s;trictly pre&s;byterian in prin|ciple them&s;elves, and of their approbation, and allowance of our ordinations, as valid and &s;crip|tural, I mu&s;t forever de&s;pair of &s;eeing any <HI>fact</HI> proved, in any ca&s;e whatever.</P>
<P>BUT Mr. L. tells us, "the whole that is aimed at, in the&s;e confe&s;&s;ions, is to condemn the u&s;urpa|tion of the Pope, not to condemn epi&s;copacy."

<P>WHEN Chri&s;t a&s;cended, he left the eleven apo&s;|tles, the only mini&s;ters of his church; all ve&s;ted with the &s;ame commi&s;&s;ion, all equal in power. Au|thorized by this commi&s;&s;ion they went forth,&mdash; preached the go&s;pel, planted churches, and or|dained mini&s;ters in them; ve&s;ted them with the &s;ame commi&s;&s;ion they them&s;elves bore. No ac|count is to be found of their fixing &s;ome in a &s;u|perior, others in a &s;ubordinate &s;tation. The min|i&s;ters they ordained, were all of one order, pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly called bi&s;hops, pa&s;tors, or elders. As the general commi&s;&s;ion is but one, &s;o one method of introduction into office, one &s;et of qualifications in order to it, one work or bu&s;ine&s;s for them when introduced, and one only, is to be found in the word of God. This was the order fixed by Chri&s;t, and followed by his apo&s;tles. They invariably ad|hered to that divine maxim of the great head of the church,&mdash;"call no man your ma&s;ter upon earth, for one is your ma&s;ter in heaven, even Chri&s;t, and all ye are brethren." This was tran&s;mitted to the primitive chri&s;tians, and ob&s;erved in the pure&s;t and earlie&s;t ages of the church. A defection from this original <HI>parity,</HI> 'tis granted, pretty &s;oon aro&s;e.&mdash; "The my&s;tery of iniquity began to work," even before the apo&s;tles were dead. A thir&s;t of domin|ion and eccle&s;ia&s;tical pre-eminence, early oppe|rated among&s;t the mini&s;ters of the meek and lowly JESUS. This increa&s;ed from le&s;s to more, till "<HI>that</HI> man of &s;in, the &s;on of perdition, who ex|alteth him&s;elf above all that is called GOD, or is wor&s;hiped," got him&s;elf fairly mounted upon the &s;even-headed bea&s;t, and en&s;laved all chri&s;tendom with his u&s;urped dominion. From this yoke of anti-chri&s;tian tyranny, when great part of Europe
<PB N="187" REF="031609_0094_0FED5B6A438EC058">was happily delivered, by the glorious light of the reformation, the ancient <HI>parity</HI> among mini&s;ters, generally took place. By far the greate&s;t part of the prote&s;tant churches, recurred to the original &s;criptural plan of pre&s;byterian order and govern|ment. And where in any in&s;tance, as in England, they adopted the epi&s;copal mode, it was not under any pretence of divine right, but wholly in con|formity to the form of government in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>THE above facts are indubitably clear, from &s;cripture, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, ancient and modern. On the&s;e facts the rea&s;onings and con|clu&s;ions are founded, contained in the foregoing pages. For the truth of the facts I appeal to the au|thentic writings afore&s;aid. For the ju&s;tne&s;s of the rea&s;onings and conclu&s;ions deduced from them, the candid reader is now to determine.</P>
<P>IF dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy be of divine right, it is certainly contained in &s;cripture. If it be of &s;uch va&s;t importance, as is pretended, it mu&s;t be very clearly and expre&s;&s;ly revealed there. Doctrines of importance, truths e&s;&s;ential to religion, are not left to be collected barely from dark hints and doubtful expre&s;&s;ions; but are clearly revealed, and often repeated, in various modes of diction, "that he who runs may read them." But is this the ca&s;e with dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy? The warme&s;t advocate for it, I pre&s;ume, will not pretend it is. All that the learned labor of its able&s;t champions has hith|erto been able to produce, is barely &s;ome dark hints and doubtful expre&s;&s;ions, which a fruitful inven|tion may turn to favour it; but the&s;e capable of a more rational interpretation upon the contrary &s;cheme. And yet to this point of <HI>doubtful di&s;pu|tation,</HI> the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential doctrines and expre&s;s pre|cepts of our holy religion, it &s;eems, mu&s;t be made a &s;acrifice. That men fulfil their promi&s;es, per|form their covenant obligations, and religiou&s;ly regard their &s;olemn vows, is not only one of the
<PB N="188" REF="031609_0095_0FED5B665E1468B0">fir&s;t dictates of natural religion; but very expre&s;&s;|ly and repeatedly enjoined in the word of God. &mdash;But when men, who have &s;olemnly dedicated them&s;elves to the mini&s;try in our churches, re|nounce their ordination vows, and take epi&s;copal orders: When profe&s;&s;ors among us, who &s;olemnly promi&s;ed and covenanted before God, angels and men, to walk in communion with us, rend them|&s;elves oft, and join the epi&s;copal &s;eparation, un|der a pretence of the divine right of epi&s;copacy, who does not &s;ee that <HI>doubtful points</HI> are preferred to <HI>po&s;itive precepts;</HI> and that more weight is laid upon the former, than the latter? If this is not to &s;ub&s;titute "mint, ani&s;e, and cummin, in&s;tead of the weightier matters of the law," 'tis indeed hard to &s;ay what is. And after all; what is gained, in point of <HI>valid mini&s;try and or dinances?</HI> Why truly, upon their own principles, ju&s;t nothing at all. If our mini&s;ters have no power, then our admini&s;|trations are invalid, our bapti&s;ms a mere nullity. Tho&s;e therefore who have been baptized in our churches, are in a &s;tate of mere heatheni&s;m, let them conform to what church they will. As this is the ca&s;e with mo&s;t of their mini&s;ters in this coun|try, they mu&s;t, upon this principle, be &s;o far from being the only regular mini&s;ters, that they are not even vi&s;ible chri&s;tians; and in&s;tead of being the only per&s;ons impowered to di&s;pen&s;e go&s;pel admin|i&s;trations, they have no right even to partake of them them&s;elves. Con&s;equently all they pretend to baptize, are &s;till in a &s;tate of heatheni&s;m, and &s;o all their mini&s;ters and churches, as well as ours, in the &s;ame wretched and deplorable condition.&mdash; Who can &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch doctrines as the&s;e, are to be found in the bible? Who can imagine, claims and principles, productive of &s;uch &s;hocking con|&s;equences, have any warrant from the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t? A moment's cool reflection, methinks, might &s;hew their ab&s;urdity, and give a check to
<PB N="189" REF="031609_0095_0FED5B665E1468B0">the advocates of them, in their warme&s;t career of <HI>pro&s;elyting</HI> zeal. Verily, gentlemen, a little more con&s;i&s;tency of principle and conduct here, would not be ami&s;s. Let us fir&s;t &s;ee you concerned to &s;ecure for your&s;elves, a valid bapti&s;m: Then it will be time enough to pre&s;s us with the argument of your only valid mini&s;try.

<P>IF Mr. L. or any other, will ju&s;t remove the&s;e difficulties, and favour us with a &s;olid, &s;criptural and thorough refutation of the foregoing argu|ments, it will be kindly received, and properly noticed. But if only bold a&s;&s;ertions, fal&s;e quota|tions, and a &s;uperficial glance, upon here and there a &s;entence, is offered to the public, under the &s;pe|cious pretence of <HI>a full an&s;wer,</HI> it will be treated with deferved neglect.</P>
