<P>ANOTHER collateral circum&s;tance worthy of &s;erious reflection, is drawn from &s;ome ideas, which are under&s;tood to have been publi&s;hed in Bo&s;ton, in certain e&s;&s;ays under the &s;ignature of <HI>Pub|licola,</HI> and which have been a&s;cribed to Mr. John Adams, jun. They were written as a partial reply to "Paine's Rights of Man," in 1791; and have been &s;ince republi&s;hed in London, with the follow|ing title and motto, in 1793. They were evidently con&s;idered in England, as calculated to defend the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, as it then &s;tood, from any <HI>ma|terial</HI> changes or alterations.

Of cour&s;e, no <HI>real</HI> or even <HI>virtual</HI> re|pre&s;entation of the people is combined with the king and nobles.</P>
<P>In the ancient limited monarchies, the whole ma&s;s of the unnobled people, were gathered, as upon an American <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lection-day, to co-operate in legi&s;lation wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h the hereditary orders.

The judiciary power, under the ge|neral government, is <HI>more</HI> completely &s;eparated and independent, than in <HI>any</HI> former in&s;tance, <HI>much more &s;o than in England</HI>&mdash;an <HI>incalculable</HI> ble&s;&s;ing. For <HI>truly</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t emphatically</HI> may it be &s;aid, that the judiciary power, under a free, <HI>written</HI> con&s;titution, is <HI>the &s;heet anchor</HI> of the political ve&s;&s;el.

<P>But are the &s;ober and reflected objections to the <HI>hereditary</HI> powers of kings and nobles re&s;olvable into a "mechanical" horror again&s;t <HI>names,</HI> having no rea&s;onable foundation?

Or are tho&s;e objections as extravagant and ridiculous as the fanciful emotions of a man would be, who &s;hould conceive him&s;elf to have been born with a natural or phy&s;ical antipathy to a pretty innocent riband of red, blue, or green?

<HEAD>No. X. TO THE ELECTORS OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Re&s;pectable Fellow Citizens,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is propo&s;ed to examine a little more the pam|phlet made up, in <HI>England,</HI> by the republicati|on of the e&s;&s;ays of Publicola, a&s;cribed to Mr. A|dams, jun. and printed as from <HI>America,</HI> with the name of <HI>John Adams, E&s;quire,</HI> in the title page.</P>
<P>There is one pa&s;&s;age in the pamphlet under con|&s;ideration, which merits particular notice. Be|cau&s;e, as it was written in 1791, when our pre&s;ent government was formed, it will appear to be a &s;trong and decided prote&s;t again&s;t the manner in which the federal con&s;titution was actually accom|pli&s;hed. It is in the twenty-fourth page, and runs thus: "If however," &s;ays our author, &s;peaking of a call of a convention by the Briti&s;h parliament, <Q>we can &s;uppo&s;e, that the parliament &s;hould final|ly accede to the idea, that they are mere tyrants without the &s;hadow of a right to the authority, which they have hitherto exerci&s;ed; the only act which they could agree to, would be a vote to di&s;&s;olve them&s;elves, and leave the ve&s;&s;el of the &s;tate without either a pilot or a rudder. For the very act of calling a convention, would be an u&s;urpation, and, from the importance of its con|&s;equences, an u&s;urpation of the mo&s;t daring na|ture: it would b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a&s;&s;uming the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the ties of &s;ociety, and at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="10" REF="030294_0010_0FE5AA33C2703CB0">that this a&s;&s;umed right was without any &s;ort of foundation.</Q></P>
<P>It is not our wi&s;h to advi&s;e <HI>for</HI> or <HI>again&s;t</HI> any mea|&s;ure, which regards the internal affairs of <HI>another</HI> country. It is only becau&s;e the papers of Publicola were offered to <HI>American</HI> con&s;ideration, with a view, no doubt, to the adoption of the ideas they contain, that we ob&s;erve upon them. Where they imply a condemnation of <HI>our</HI> mea&s;ures to obtain this happy con&s;titution, it is very fit and nece&s;&s;ary that they be noticed with all our minds and with all our &s;trength.</P>
<P>It is well known, that there was no authority in the <HI>Annapolis</HI> convention of 1786, to proceed upon any bu&s;ine&s;s, other than <HI>commercial.</HI> Yet they unanimou&s;ly recommended to the &s;tates, which had delegated them, to call another convention for <HI>ge|neral</HI> objects. This was done. The convention met at Philadelphia. The in&s;trument, under which we enjoy our pre&s;ent happine&s;s, was formed by them, and the old confederated congre&s;s of 1787, com|municated the propo&s;ed con&s;titution to the &s;tates, though one of its provi&s;ions was contrary to the old articles of confederation&mdash;that, we mean, which &s;et up a new confederation of nine adopting &s;tates. It was, however, communicated to the &s;tate legi&s;la|tures, and <HI>they all called conventions of the people to con&s;ider, reject, or adopt it,</HI> though it is certain, that no &s;tate con&s;titution contained a power to take &s;uch a mea&s;ure. The people, however, did choo&s;e con|ventions, and adopted the con&s;titution at various times, from December 1787, until May 1790. The operation took almo&s;t three years, exclu&s;ively of the later ca&s;e of Vermont, which was peculiarly circum&s;tanced. We do not perceive in this long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">arance of "a de&s;erted &s;hip <HI>with|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nor of "a daring <HI>u&s;urpation</HI>" <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of the right <HI>to di&s;&s;olve the

Had we departed from &s;anc|tioned principles and aimed at <HI>the elevation</HI> of the <HI>one,</HI> and the <HI>few,</HI> by &s;acrificing the equal <HI>birth-rights</HI> of all the re&s;t of the people, we &s;hould not this day have enjoyed a con&s;titution, which has afforded us great pro&s;perity and comparative tranquillity in the mid&s;t <HI>of a &s;uffering and convul&s;ed world.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ymptoms and evidences of the real writer of the pamphlet referred to, we have already given. It is not at all doubted, that <HI>Publicola's</HI> e&s;&s;ays, of which it is made up, are the work of Mr. Adams, jun. Nothing in the public or private character of this gentleman is known, which is a &s;ubject of cen|&s;ure. If there were any thing of that nature, <HI>it could have no place here.</HI> Some of the political ideas in the pamphlet appear to corre&s;pond with the pre|ference to hereditary government, evidenced or ex|emplified by an approbation of, and &s;olicitude for, the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, which has been &s;tated as the <HI>great objection</HI> to the election of Mr. Adams.</P>
<P>The te&s;timony of Mr. Paine on the &s;ubject of Mr. Adams's &s;entiments or di&s;po&s;itions, &s;o far as it may weigh with the electors, cannot, it is true, be con|&s;idered as <HI>direct.</HI> He &s;peaks only of what he has been informed of from &s;uch &s;ources as to fix his own belief. It is, however, a circum&s;tance of weight, taken in connection with what has been exhibited from Mr. Adams's books, with the contents of the "Di&s;cour&s;es upon <HI>Davila,"</HI> and with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and di&s;po&s;itions di&s;played in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="12" REF="030294_0012_0FE5AA3A2E920328">the work of Mr. Adams, jun. Mr. Paine's a&s;&s;er|tion is, that he has the authority of one or two per&s;ons, for &s;aying that Mr. Adams has declared, that <HI>the pre&s;idency</HI> &s;hould be made <HI>hereditary,</HI> in the family of Mr. Lund Wa&s;hington. It is true, that the manner in which Mr. Paine has &s;tated this mat|ter, is &s;uch as not to give all po&s;&s;ible effect to the a&s;&s;ertion. But though there may be wanting &s;ome|thing of that &s;erious &s;implicity of narrative or &s;tate|ment of facts, which aids the impre&s;&s;ion, even of truth it&s;elf, yet the a&s;&s;ertion is perfectly expre&s;s and clear, and it completely commits Mr. Paine. He may occa&s;ionally be eccentric or extravagant, as men of great powers of language, animation, and genius not &s;eldom are; but there appears no rea&s;on to &s;up|po&s;e, that he would give under his hand a wilful mi&s;repre&s;entation of fact, concerning an important &s;ubject, and relative to a public officer of high &s;tand|ing. It is now four or five weeks &s;ince this a&s;&s;erti|on was publi&s;hed in the gazettes. The circum&s;tance really was very favorable to Mr. Adams, as it afford|ed him an opportunity to &s;hew the community, that this and all other opinions or a&s;&s;ertions concern|ing a predilection for hereditary power were untrue. When the anxieties of a virtuous community are a|wakened, it is no le&s;s <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> than <HI>prudent,</HI> that they &s;hould be removed by the exertions of all who can contribute to that end. But when they have particular relation to individuals, the attention to the anxieties of the community is rarely with-held, when it is in their power. Re&s;pect to the public feelings and &s;olicitudes ought to produce all the &s;a|tisfaction of that nature, which circum&s;tances will admit.

<P>IT would be a vain attempt to bani&s;h party from any government, arbitrary or free. The object of the prudent and the virtuous will ever be, there|fore, to mitigate the &s;pirit, and to check its exce&s;&s;es and exaggerations. Party has ari&s;en to a con&s;ider|able height in the United States. <HI>Our well and tru|ly balanced government,</HI> in which our pre&s;ident has applied his qualified negative oftener than <HI>the five la&s;t Briti&s;h monarchs,</HI> and in which the two hou&s;es have negatived each other with an independent de|ci&s;ion, has kept us in order in a difficult and trying &s;ea&s;on, and in a time of general agitation and con|vul&s;ion under monarchy in Europe. It is an un|comfortable truth, that our various partizans have much mi&s;repre&s;ented each other to their re&s;pective con&s;tituents, in a prejudiced and angry manner. The&s;e circum&s;tances have very much contributed to the materials which Phocion has wrought up into his e&s;&s;ays and pamphlet. A cur&s;ory notice of &s;ome facts and events, which have occurred in America, may tend to produce harmony and to remove preju|dices. Time, however, admits but little to be done to this u&s;eful end. It is certain and manife&s;t, that <HI>the exci&s;e &s;y&s;tem</HI> of revenue has been the mo&s;t trying mea&s;ure of the general government. Prejudice again&s;t it exi&s;ted in many places, and from &s;ever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="18" REF="030294_0018_0FE5AA4780170688">cau&s;es. It therefore behoved the true and prudent friends of the government, not to di&s;countenance a mode of revenue, which <HI>a war</HI> would have render|ed nece&s;&s;ary to us, and which we have been obliged to u&s;e in peace. The inevitable difficulties were of them&s;elves too great. It is <HI>a fact,</HI> little known, that <HI>all</HI> the <HI>&s;enators</HI> of North Carolina, South Ca|rolina, and Virginia, voted for the pa&s;&s;ing of the bill, while three of the &s;enators of the ea&s;tern &s;tates voted again&s;t it, including <HI>both</HI> of tho&s;e from Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts. It mu&s;t be added, that Mr. Jeffer&s;on's particular friends in the &s;enate, voted for the mea|&s;ure. A &s;imilar &s;upport to the exci&s;e law took place in the other hou&s;e, on the part of the able&s;t and mo&s;t influential friends of Mr. Jeffer&s;on.</P>
<P>The act of congre&s;s mo&s;t important to <HI>the effici|ency</HI> of the executive power, is that which enables the pre&s;ident to remove the officers of the executive government at his di&s;cretion. In proportion to the number of members in the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, the votes from the &s;outhward of Penn&s;ylvania were more numerous than from the northward, and the names of Mr. Jeffer&s;on's able&s;t friends will al&s;o be found among the voters for this important act. Of &s;uch magnitude is the law, that it is now greatly to be de&s;ired that an amendment to the con&s;titution, &s;ecuring the power to the pre&s;ident for ever, might be adopted. By &s;trengthening our elective chief we dimini&s;h the pleas for making him <HI>hereditary.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ubject of <HI>boundary</HI> was predicted by the malignant enemies of American union and pro&s;|perity, as an abundant &s;ource of di&s;cord and con|tention. Virginia had the olde&s;t charter, and a ve|ry broad one indeed. Yet &s;he has &s;ettled amicably with North Carolina, Maryland, and Penn&s;ylvania, the great que&s;tions of boundary, conceding what ther &s;tates maintain to this day in their favor.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="030294_0019_0FE5AA4BE2FB8160">
<HI>Connecticut</HI> alone has kept open <HI>one point</HI> with Penn&s;ylvania, and <HI>another</HI> with <HI>New York.</HI> It may be affirmed, without the lea&s;t hazard, that the in|ternal peace and harmony of this country has, <HI>in no in&s;tance,</HI> been &s;o <HI>lightly</HI> hazarded as by the legi&s;la|ture of Connecticut, in &s;elling, for a few thou&s;and pounds, a claim to a quantity of valuable land, reckoned little &s;hort of a million and a half of acres, in the &s;tate of New York. If they had a right to it, <HI>deep, very deep</HI> indeed, has been the injury to their <HI>con&s;tituents.</HI> Becau&s;e the property is intrin&s;i|cally worth three or four millions of dollars. If they had <HI>not</HI> the right, the act of &s;elling it comes under a <HI>denomination,</HI> which <HI>we forbear to name.</HI> It is important to ob&s;erve, that the tran&s;action took place in the la&s;t year.</P>
<P>No di&s;po&s;ition to good government is admitted to exi&s;t in the &s;outhern &s;tates. Yet two ea&s;tern &s;tates out of four, rejected the con&s;titution in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance, and of the four &s;outhern &s;tates only one re|jected. There was no in&s;tance of unanimity in adopting the con&s;titution to the ea&s;tward. But Jer|&s;ey, Delaware, and Georgia, were unanimous, and the minority in Maryland was le&s;s than that of Con|necticut, <HI>the mo&s;t unanimous</HI> ea&s;tern &s;tate, being in Maryland only eleven.</P>
<P>It is urged again&s;t &s;ome of the &s;outhern &s;tates, that they impeded the payment of debts, which the treaty of peace &s;ecured to the &s;ubjects of Great Bri|tain. It is, however, &s;ome extenuation, if the plea is in&s;ufficient, that they pleaded the infraction of the treaty of 1783, concerning their negroes. And it is true, though little known, that Connecticut, without &s;uch a plea, was found to have in full force in 1790, a law which, al&s;o interfering then on the &s;corce of debts with the treaty, was &s;et a&s;ide by the &s;upreme court of the United States. It is al&s;o true, that the in&s;urrection of 1786, in Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;ets,
<PB N="20" REF="030294_0020_0FE5AA4DB2727590">was, in a great degree, owing to the operation of the courts of law, which, of cour&s;e, decreed the payment of private debts to the creditor citizens from the debtor citizens of the &s;ame &s;tate: not to per&s;ons lately <HI>alien enemies,</HI> again&s;t who&s;e govern|ment a breach of treaty was alleged. The courts of law were declared by the in&s;urgents to be griev|ances, and their &s;uppre&s;&s;ion was required. It has been &s;aid that the &s;outhern &s;tates were indi&s;po&s;ed to the funding &s;y&s;tem; but have they not pa&s;&s;ed laws to rai&s;e impo&s;ts and even exci&s;es to di&s;charge the intere&s;t and &s;ink the principal? Virginia, particu|larly, has paid the exci&s;e, <HI>on the produce of her &s;oil,</HI> in an <HI>examplary</HI> manner, and to a large amount. If the tempers of &s;ome, and the very low &s;ales of their certificates by others, have occa&s;ioned loud com|plaints, have the &s;ame not appeared in the &s;hape of in&s;urrection, in the &s;tate of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts?&mdash;It is well known that the payment of the public debt was among the chief cau&s;es of the in&s;urrection of 1786.</P>
<P>Believe me, re&s;pectable fellow citizens, it is not to <HI>cen&s;ure,</HI> not <HI>to rai&s;e a clamor</HI> again&s;t the ea&s;tern &s;tates, that the&s;e things are mentioned; but, <HI>by &s;elf-examination,</HI> to produce convictions of truth, and to renovate that <HI>"&s;pirit of amity and mutual con|ce&s;&s;ion"</HI> which prevailed, alas, more in 1787, 1788, and 1789, than it has done for the la&s;t four years. Let us proceed to other facts.</P>
<P>Much has been repre&s;ented upon the &s;ubject of Mr. Jeffer&s;on and the late printer of the National Gazette. It has been proved, upon the oath of Mr. Freneau, that there was no foundation for the idea of a connection or influence with or from Mr. Jef|fer&s;on. This is ab&s;olutely true. It has not been candidly laid before you. If Mr. Jeffer&s;on meant to &s;upport Mr. Freneau, it is extraordinary that he did not allow him the whole &s;um of five hundred
<PB N="21" REF="030294_0021_0FE5AA4F429FA180">dollars per annum, when the legi&s;lature a&s;&s;igned that &s;um for a clerk&s;hip, and when the lingui&s;t [Mr. Freneau] was obliged to procure tran&s;lations of <HI>Spani&s;h, Portugue&s;e, German, Low-Dutch, Italian,</HI> or <HI>any</HI> other foreign papers, the department of &s;tate might receive. It is doubted whether a man of equal talents could be obtained, for five hundred dollars, now.</P>
<P>Why is it mentioned, that not only Mr Jeffer&s;on, but a clerk, before in the office, under&s;tood <HI>French?</HI> Are there no other foreign languages but <HI>French,</HI> and could Mr. Jeffer&s;on apply <HI>a &s;ecreiary's</HI> time to make tran&s;lations, which, it was known, the pre&s;i|dent would want, being unacquainted with the French? Other gentlemen of the executive govern|ment, who did not under&s;tand French, were to be con&s;ulted on many affairs. To them al&s;o tran&s;lati|ons were nece&s;&s;ary, as they likewi&s;e were for the two hou&s;es of congre&s;s, and for promulgation to our citizens. If another clerk under&s;tood <HI>French,</HI> did he under&s;tand <HI>all</HI> other foreign languages?&mdash; was he <HI>critically</HI> well acquainted with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French?</HI>&mdash;Though before in the office, had he not his time and talents fully employed in his proper bu&s;ine&s;s?</P>
<P>The repre&s;entations concerning the ca&s;e of Mr. Freneau, were &s;o frequent and open in the gazettes, that it mu&s;t have been known to the pre&s;ident. It cannot be doubted, that the affair was a &s;ubject of conver&s;ation between him and Mr. Jeffer&s;on. If the pre&s;ident thought there was a propriety in Mr. Fre|neau's removal, or a nece&s;&s;ity for it, he would <HI>cer|tainly</HI> have &s;aid &s;o to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and Mr. Jeffer&s;on would <HI>as certainly</HI> have removed him on the pre&s;ident's wi&s;h. <HI>This ought to be conclu&s;ive with every man,</HI> and particularly with &s;uch a writer as Phocion, who &s;tudies to carry an appearance of de|ference and attachment to the chief magi&s;trate. But,
<PB N="22" REF="030294_0022_0FE5AAC15D39AC98">as in regard to opinions <HI>concerning French affaris,</HI> &s;o in <HI>this ca&s;e,</HI> the pre&s;ident him&s;elf has been incon&s;i|derately implicated in cen&s;ure, to get at Mr. Jef|fer&s;on. It would be frivolous to &s;ay, the pre&s;ident <HI>could not cau&s;e the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of a tran&s;lating clerk.</HI></P>
<P>It is with the greate&s;t regret; that we touch upon foreign topies, <HI>even in reply,</HI> but Phocion has made it nece&s;&s;ary. It will be remembered, that Mr. Jeffer&s;on was in France, when the mea&s;ures of the fir&s;t nation|al a&s;&s;embly were taken. He &s;aw the daily evidences of that enmity to the French revolution, which the de&s;potic part of the combined powers manife&s;ted in 1788 and 1789, on account of the admi&s;&s;ion of <HI>the French people,</HI> or <HI>tiers clat,</HI> into a &s;hare of the go|vernment. He &s;aw, that the idea of a reform, <HI>in any degree through the agency of the people,</HI> excited the pa&s;&s;ions and exertions of the hereditary orders. He &s;aw tho&s;e orders, headed by the blood relations of the king and queen of France, preparing to inter|po&s;e in the internal affairs of France, and ultimate|ly threatening <HI>a partition</HI> of the kingdom, to pre|vent the e&s;tabli&s;hment of any degree or portion of power in the people of France, as <HI>a part of the po|pular order in Europe.</HI> He mu&s;t have &s;een that the de&s;truction of the power of the people in France, naturally led to &s;imilar vies in regard to America. Such were the <HI>natural</HI> reflexions of Americans, di&s;po&s;ed to &s;upport popular elective government, in the&s;e &s;tates. If the <HI>prote&s;tant</HI> cau&s;e from 1755 to 1760, intere&s;ted the free&s;t of the civilized nati|ons, in the &s;ucce&s;s of the arbitrary princes who &s;up|ported it by their arms, as in the ca&s;e of the la&s;t Pru&s;&s;ian king, how natural was it to feel an intere&s;t in the &s;ucce&s;s of the French &s;truggle, which was maintained by hereditary de&s;potic monarchs, again&s;t <HI>the new-born power of the people of Europe</HI> in the Gallic in&s;tance? It was manife&s;t that the Americans, their con&s;titution and their government, which are
<PB N="23" REF="030294_0023_0FE5AA5118292A58"><HI>in&s;eparable,</HI> were intere&s;ted, at lea&s;t, by prudence and policy, not to &s;ay by feeling.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;tate and cour&s;e of things till 1793. No man can doubt <HI>the unity of opinion</HI> between <HI>the pre&s;ident</HI> and <HI>Mr. Jeffer&s;on,</HI> which prevailed on French affairs. At that time a French agent, as little the friend of France as of America in his diplomatic conduct, gave this country the mo&s;t ju&s;t and &s;erious cau&s;es of offence and unea&s;ine&s;s. Mr. Jeffer&s;on mu&s;t have been very early &s;truck with the extravagance and danger of Mr. Genet's conduct, for the fir&s;t communication to that mini&s;ter, from the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, which was within a very few days after his arrival at the &s;eat of government, clearly proves that Mr. Jeffer&s;on decidedly and ex|plicitly re&s;i&s;ted the irregular and dangerous preten|&s;ions of Mr. Genet. The&s;e papers were officially communicated to the legi&s;lature by the pre&s;ident. Mr. Genet's fir&s;t communication was of the 27th of May, and Mr. Jeffer&s;on's reply was of the 5th of June. It appears from the latter, that he had <HI>before</HI> made an oral communication to Mr. Genet. In both the&s;e we &s;ee that Mr. Jeffer&s;on had, in a conci|liating, though a firm, explicit, and decided man|ner, maintained the independent rights and neutral duties of this government and nation. The&s;e very decided and early communications, Phocion has carefully omitted, and only brings into view a &s;ub|&s;equent communication to Mr. Governeur Morris, dated above ten weeks after, the firm &s;pirit of which he endeavors to undervalue. This material omi&s;|&s;ion of Phocion ju&s;tifies the pointed repetition of the remark, that he is a very prejudiced, and con&s;equently, a very deceiving and dangerous in|formant.</P>
<P>It merits the particular con&s;ideration of the elec|tors, that the duty Mr. Jeffer&s;on had to perform,
<PB N="24" REF="030294_0024_0FE5AA6A5A499D40">on this occa&s;ion, was infinitely delicate and import|ant. He knew that the pre&s;ident was as earne&s;t in his wi&s;hes for the &s;ucce&s;s of the French revolution, as a decided whig in a neutral chief magi&s;tracy, could po&s;&s;ibly be. He mo&s;t probably knew, too, that a republican common intere&s;t was perceived be|tween the two countries, by the pre&s;ident&mdash;and the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion exi&s;ted, no doubt, in his own mind. He knew that France was under a highly-excited revolutionary government and feeling, and that mi|litary &s;upplies and officers were engaged in France, and commi&s;&s;ions of congre&s;s i&s;&s;ued, and prizes &s;old, in the French dominions, before the war of 1778, with England. The&s;e were all contrary to the law of nations&mdash;&s;ubjected France to war, and would &s;ubject the United States. Though the French Re|public might feel much therefore, the United States could not con&s;ent to &s;uch proceedings in their actual &s;ituation. The French agent was very extravagant in his language, and di&s;orderly, to an extreme, in his conduct. This could not be endur|ed; yet, a quarrel with France, was &s;tudiou&s;ly to be avoided; becau&s;e it would throw us into the arms of the combined monarchs, with whom we had <HI>no common feeling</HI>&mdash;no common <HI>intere&s;t</HI>&mdash;no ground, however &s;light, of common cau&s;e. This government, impre&s;&s;ed with real friend&s;hip towards France, under the circum&s;tances &s;tated, had to pro|te&s;t, in a dignified manner, again&s;t the agent of that republic. It behoved us to take ground, which its own perfect &s;oundne&s;s, and our arguments and firmne&s;s &s;hould render impregnable. Let any man impre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e views of the &s;ubject, examine Mr. Jeffer&s;on's thirteen official letters, of June and July, 1793, to Mr. Genet, and let him al&s;o take up Mr. Jeffer&s;on's letter (following tho&s;e) of the 16th Augu&s;t to Mr. Governeur Morris, and he will
<PB N="25" REF="030294_0025_0FE5AA55D74B2668">have rea&s;on to be thankful for the un&s;haken firmne&s;s, the intelligence, and conciliation, which Mr. Jef|fer&s;on di&s;plays, in controuling the operations of Mr. Genet and in requiring of the French government, and ultimately effecting, his final recall. So com|pletely was this done, that Mr. Genet has never &s;ince returned to France. No &s;ooner had the&s;e very difficult and painful &s;cenes been well gone through, than the Briti&s;h order, again&s;t our trade, of June 1793, came forth and &s;hewed us how lit|tle it would have done for us to have been driven by a quarrel with France into the arms of England. While the agitations and injuries from tho&s;e orders were embarra&s;&s;ing the bu&s;ine&s;s of the department of &s;tate and the commerce of the country, a new and more alarming &s;cene was opened before us. The &s;chemes of the combined powers were extend|ed. An explicit manife&s;to of Great Britain of the 31&s;t October 1793, was publi&s;hed, in which <HI>monarchical</HI> government was dictated to the French republic; and <HI>this only other republic upon earth,</HI> by virtue of an accompanying <HI>&s;ecret</HI> order of the Bri|ti&s;h government, nearly of the &s;ame date (Novem|ber 6th, 1793) was to be &s;acrificed, without notice, in its commerce, navigation, &s;eamen, mercantile capital, &s;upplies, and revenues. Yes, re&s;pectable electors, <HI>one</HI> of the&s;e republics was expre&s;sly to be <HI>&s;ubverted,</HI> and the <HI>other</HI> to be <HI>ruinou&s;ly crippled and deranged</HI> by virtue of two acts, <HI>matured at the &s;ame time,</HI> and no doubt <HI>in due connexion,</HI> upon <HI>the &s;ame foreign council board!</HI> The&s;e things are not repeated to inflame. But if a &s;ecretary of &s;tate, who dealt firm|ly with a gro&s;sly offending foreign mini&s;ter of that other republic, under &s;uch trying circum&s;tances, is to &s;u&s;tain <HI>imputed infamy,</HI> in&s;tead of imputed merit, from the pen of a &s;elf-deceiving witne&s;s, it behoves us carefully to look back to the &s;erious tran&s;action
<PB N="26" REF="030294_0026_0FE5AAC315C73200">of the time. It is manife&s;ted to you, by our eleventh number, that the pre&s;ident has retained in <HI>his</HI> mind, the &s;tronge&s;t attachment to the principles of the French revolution, notwith&s;tanding all the mi&s;con|duct of their agents. National intere&s;ts are not altered by mini&s;terial errors or crimes. Mr. Jeffer|&s;on has done no more than the pre&s;ident. The ex|ecrations of Phocion, on this account, are clearly implied execrations of both, for a judicious poli|cy and moderation, by which the wildne&s;s of the &s;ons of Gallic LIBERTY, was not permitted to impair their wonted attachment to the revered PARENT.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION OF THE SECOND PART.</HEAD>
<P>IT is manife&s;t, that the&s;e additional pages can|not po&s;&s;ibly reach all the electors. Impediments of various kinds, not within the controul of the wri|ter, have prevented their being more early and much more full. The e&s;&s;ays of Phocion carry evident marks of the preparation of years. Yet they &s;eem to be more open to a complete refutation than any publication on &s;o important a &s;ubject, which has ever been produced in America, from the palpable mi&s;tate|ments and omi&s;&s;ions of great matters of fact. The minutene&s;s and diffu&s;ion with which they are writ|ten, would render a detailed an&s;wer to him equally long. What he may propo&s;e to publi&s;h in defence of Mr. Adams's opinions in his pamphlet copy, we do not know; but we perceive that he has left his ob&s;er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ions upon that part of his &s;ubject in his new&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the very &s;light arguments
<PB N="27" REF="030294_0027_0FE5AA5769E01F90">which he had given on that head in the fir&s;t part of his pamphlet.</P>
<P>Should he add no more in regard to that all-impor|tant object of our inve&s;tigation, we pre&s;ume it is be|cau&s;e he perceives the difficulty of the ta&s;k. If he &s;hould add more in the pamphlet than he &s;ubjects, in his e&s;&s;ays, to general examination, it will evince a de&s;ire to avoid the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. This, however, will manife&s;t little re&s;pect for that penetration and judg|ment, which the &s;elect characters of the pre&s;iden|tial electors warrant their fellow citizens, confident|ly to expect.</P>
