<P>Death and Life are in the power of the Tongue.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BEHOLD how great a matter a little fire kindleth! The tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity; a world indeed, &s;uch is its power. How dangerous a weapon then is this little member! and how nice and criti|cal, as well as important an affair, mu&s;t be the conduct and regulation of it! If the i&s;&s;ues of life and death are from thence, we ought to look well to it, to &s;ee that the current be re&s;trained to its proper channel; that nothing flow from thence, but what may tend to the faire&s;t i&s;&s;ue, and end in life, immortality and happine&s;s. But is it po&s;&s;ible that &s;o much can de|pend upon the tongue? are words &s;o pregnant with happine&s;s or mi&s;ery? words which are but a breath of tran&s;ient air! Yet by thy words thou &s;halt be ju&s;tified, and by thy words thou &s;halt be condem|ned.
<PB N="6" REF="022549_0004_0FB946ACC4F082D8">
But let us come to a clo&s;er examination of the matter. Let us inquire how this great power came to be lodged in this little in&s;trument, the tongue; and in what &s;en&s;e, and how far it is evi|dently re&s;ident in it. Let us &s;ee what are the u&s;ual offices and employments of the tongue. The avow|ed office of this little u&s;eful and &s;ignificant member of the human frame is, to expre&s;s the conceptions of the brain; and its employment takes in the whole extent of language; comprehending at once, prai&s;e and obloquy; wor&s;hip and execration; mirth and &s;orrow; harmony and di&s;cord. Therewith ble&s;s we God, even the Father of all things; and there|with cur&s;e we men, who are made after the &s;imili|tude of God. Therewith may we on the one hand make confe&s;&s;ion to &s;alvation; and on the other defile our whole body, and inflame or &s;et on fire the whole cour&s;e of nature. And in all this, it is &s;uppo&s;ed to act under the influence of the heart; and in the wor&s;t ca&s;es, I believe it generally does. External expre&s;&s;ions of virtuous and pious &s;entiments, cannot always be depended on for their truth and &s;incerity. Men may think it nece&s;&s;ary to make an appearance
<PB N="7" REF="022549_0005_0FB946AE723787A0">
of good qualities, of which they are not in reality po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; but the ca&s;e mu&s;t be widely different on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the que&s;tion. There is no end to be &s;erved in a man's appearing wor&s;e than he is; and the rancor of the heart will ever be con&s;idered as the probable &s;ource and fountain of the malediction of the tongue. Thus are death and life in the power of the tongue. For on the very &s;ame principle that men &s;hall give account of, and con&s;equently receive the equitable puni&s;hment for every idle word they &s;hall &s;peak, they &s;hall al&s;o receive the applau&s;e and reward that is due to a ju&s;t and proper regulation of &s;peech; and by their words be ju&s;tified, as well as condemned. With what apparent view; for what evident purpo&s;e, was this in&s;trument of &s;peech made a part of the human fabric? Phy&s;ically &s;peaking, to enable man to expre&s;s his wants; to acquaint his fellow-animals with the otherwi&s;e illegible cha|racters of his heart; in a word, to render him a conver&s;able &s;ociable creature. But with re&s;pect to moral and religious ends, there were much higher and more noble views.</P>
<P>THE Lord hath given man a tongue, that he might prai&s;e him therewith. The fir&s;t principle
<PB N="8" REF="022549_0006_0FB946AFDB063A68">
view of the creation of man, of his being endowed with &s;uch high and noble faculties; &s;uch peculiar excellencies; was doubtle&s;s the glo|ry of the Supreme Being. Man is the off|&s;pring of ineffable goodne&s;s. Every faculty he en|joys, is the donation of unbounded benevolence. Will not this &s;ugge&s;t to him, that the proper and natural employment of tho&s;e faculties, is to give glory, honor and thank&s;giving to that Being from whom they are derived? What then are we to &s;ay to &s;uch per&s;ons who pervert tho&s;e very powers which were given them for the be&s;t and noble&s;t, to the wor&s;t and vile&s;t of all purpo&s;es; who employ that tongue to bla&s;pheme and di&s;honor that Being whom it was given them to prai&s;e; to confu&s;e and de&s;troy that &s;ociety which they were formed to &s;upport and adorn? Is not this putting the mo&s;t glaring affront on the author of our being? Is not this perverting the cour&s;e and order of nature in the mo&s;t gro&s;s and palpable manner? Is not this in &s;hort, oppo&s;ing the expre&s;s views of providence, and de&s;troying the apparent end and de&s;ign of our creation? What &s;hall be done to thee, O thou fal&s;e tongue? Fal&s;e in the
<PB N="9" REF="022549_0007_0FB946B1297A1A60">
true&s;t and mo&s;t exten&s;ive latitude, fal&s;e to all views; &s;ocial, moral, or religious; and fal&s;e to thy father, friend and benefactor. What &s;hall be done to thee? Even mighty and &s;harp arrows, and hot burning coals, &s;hall be the fatal but ju&s;t reward of thy perju|ry. But who are they that have done this great wickedne&s;s? Is this however to be a&s;ked, when our &s;treets are filled with cur&s;ing and bla&s;phemy; when execrations and oaths intrude them&s;elves into every article of di&s;cour&s;e; when they become the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of every general conver&s;ation; when even our women and infants become remark|able; remarkable by the wor&s;t brand of infamy, for a &s;hocking proficiency in the language of hell? I know not whether tho&s;e who are addicted to this pernicious vice in any degree, are at all to be ar|gued with, upon the principles of rea&s;on and religi|on; &s;urely not the latter. The rule by which any practice &s;tands &s;o &s;olemnly condemned, mu&s;t cer|tainly be di&s;allowed before the practice can become &s;o general; and if this is the ca&s;e, then farewell rea&s;on too. The connection is &s;o clo&s;e between tho&s;e in&s;eparable friends, rea&s;on and religion, that human
<PB N="10" REF="022549_0008_0FB946B2A34017F8">
power is too weak to di&s;ingage them; and divine approves of the union. But as it is to be hoped there are but few &s;uch, and that the practice of that de&s;tructive vice of common cur&s;ing and &s;wearing, is more generally owing to the want of duly con&s;i|dering, or perhaps of rightly under&s;tanding the hei|nous nature and future con&s;equences of it; I &s;hall therefore proceed to lay before you, a few of the mo&s;t obvious and mo&s;t conclu&s;ive arguments which may be urged again&s;t it; from the re&s;pective con&s;i|derations both of rea&s;on and religion. With re&s;pect to the latter, it is certain that nothing can be more forcibly prohibited; more formally condemned; or more &s;olemnly denounced again&s;t, through the whole &s;y&s;tem at lea&s;t of the chri&s;tian law. The au|thor of this law has &s;trictly forbid us to &s;wear at all, by any kind of object, either in heaven or on earth; not even by our own heads, how much le&s;s then by the great and venerable name of that tre|mendous Being, who fir&s;t formed and who upholds all things. If the inanimate heavens are not to be called upon thus vainly, becau&s;e they are his throne; if to the very &s;en&s;ele&s;s earth, we owe this &s;olemn
<PB N="11" REF="022549_0009_0FB946B42B662738">
reverence, becau&s;e it is his foot&s;tool; how dreadful a profanation mu&s;t it be to invoke the &s;acred name of the great King him&s;elf, from whom alone both throne and foot&s;tool receive their &s;anctity.</P>
<P>So great a &s;tre&s;s is laid upon it by the Apo&s;tle, that he commands it to be avoided, even above all things. Above all things, my brethren &s;wear not. And of &s;o much importance is the government of the tongue con&s;idered by him in another place, that he &s;cruples not to pronounce it entirely de&s;tructive of all religion, and ab&s;olutely incompatible with the e&s;&s;ential qualifications of a true and &s;incere chri&s;ti|an. If any man among you &s;eemeth to be religi|ous, i. e. profe&s;&s;es a belief of the doctrines and a regard to the rules of the go&s;pel; yet if that man bridle not his tongue, but is licentious and ex|travagant in his &s;peech, launching out into oaths, execrations and bla&s;phemies, depend upon it tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions are in&s;incere. What little appearance he makes of religion, is vain; and what hopes and expectations he may form from it, vain and ab&s;urd; groundle&s;s and delu&s;ive. As for cur&s;es, how ill do they become the mouth of him who profe&s;&s;es him|&s;elf
<PB N="12" REF="022549_0010_0FB946B5B844B190">
a di&s;ciple of the meek and benevolent Je&s;us who&s;e doctrine and who&s;e life breathe nothing but love and ble&s;&s;ing. Who&s;e example forbids us be|ing reviled to revile again; and who&s;e repeated precepts, po&s;itively enjoin ble&s;&s;ings, even in return for cur&s;es received; and prayers for &s;piteful and in|jurious treatment. Even under the law it had been long &s;ince expre&s;sly forbidden to take the name of the Lord in vain; and a &s;evere vengeance was de|nounced again&s;t &s;uch as &s;hould be hardy enough to violate the precept. The prophet Ho&s;ea ranks the &s;wearer with the athei&s;t, the thief, the murderer and adulterer. But it is needle&s;s to multiply prooffs that the practice of common profane cur&s;ing and &s;wear|ing is wholly indefen&s;ible on the &s;ide of religion. If there is any force in words, nothing is more ex|pre&s;sly or &s;olemnly prohibited. And what can be expected from the open violation of tho&s;e repeated prohibitions, but the puni&s;hment annexed to &s;uch offences; the vengeance particularly denounced again&s;t &s;uch glaring and ab&s;olute affronts upon the &s;upreme governor and legi&s;lator? The Lord will not hold him guiltle&s;s who taketh his name in vain.
<PB N="13" REF="022549_0011_0FB946B71DC67F60">
And in what degree of guilt he &s;hall be held, let the holy P&s;almi&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure in&s;truct us.&mdash; As he loved cur&s;ing, &s;o &s;hall it come to him. As he delighted not in ble&s;&s;ing, &s;o let it be far from him. As he cloathed him&s;elf with cur&s;ing like as with his garment, &s;o let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones; let it be to him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually. Thus we &s;ee the imprecations of the cur&s;er, whether they be levelled at him&s;elf or not, will &s;till retort upon him&s;elf in their fulle&s;t influence.</P>
<P>HIS mi&s;chief &s;hall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing &s;hall come down upon his own pate, &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t. Hear how aptly this is confirmed by the &s;on of Syrack&mdash;A man who u&s;eth much &s;wearing, &s;ays he, &s;hall be filled with iniquity, and the plague &s;hall never depart from his hou&s;e. If he &s;hall offend, his &s;in &s;hall be upon him, and if he acknowledge not his &s;in, he maketh a double offence, and if he &s;wear in vain, he &s;hall not be innocent; but his hou&s;e &s;hall be full of calamities. This is the word that is cloath|ed

about with death. Were we even de&s;titute of the&s;e frequent, expre&s;s and &s;olemn cautions a|gain&s;t profaning the name of God, certainly rea|&s;on mu&s;t inform us that we cannot be guilty of a more bold affront to the Supreme Being, than to invoke him on every the mo&s;t trivial and imperti|nent occa&s;ion, or to &s;port with the great and awful character of him who gave beings to all worlds; and how immen&s;ely does it exaggerate this guilt, if that &s;acred authority be appealed to&punc; that inviola|ble name be pro&s;tituted in atte&s;tation of the mo&s;t impudent and daring fal&s;hoods. But that this is too generally the ca&s;e with common &s;wearers, need not be ob&s;erved to you; nor will they them&s;elves, if they have the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of &s;hame or mode&s;ty, dare to deny it. The vice of common &s;wearing is then, in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, by an apparent violation of his expre&s;s commands, mo&s;t provoking to the Su|preme Being. But do we provoke God? What motive have we for it? Hath he ever injured us? On the contrary, are we not the creatures of his bounty? Do we not depend upon him for life and all things which pertain to it? Doth he not di&s;pen&s;e
<PB N="15" REF="022549_0013_0FB946BDAA782D58">
to us the various ble&s;&s;ings of nature and providence with a mo&s;t bountiful hand? What encouragement have we to it? Are we &s;tronger than he? Can we over-rule his ju&s;t re&s;entments? Can we ward off the &s;troke of vengeance? The &s;wearer then in this re&s;pect, &s;tands doubly convicted of folly in re|gard to him&s;elf, by expo&s;ing him&s;elf to ills which he knows not how to avoid or endure.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> it is injurious to men; not only to tho&s;e individuals who are the particular objects of cur&s;es and execrations, but even to &s;ociety in ge|neral; becau&s;e by &s;wearing the land mourneth, &s;ays the prophet. The &s;in is of &s;o deep a dye, as to oc|ca&s;ion national vi&s;itations, by &s;word&mdash;famine&mdash;or pe&s;tilence. He therefore who&s;e crimes are &s;o fla|grant as to bring on public vengeance, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> bane and pe&s;t to &s;ociety; a public enemy; a traitor to his country; and ought to be treated as &s;uch. After this con&s;ideration, it is needle&s;s to mention the comparatively trivial guilt of indecency. When a man has done his endeavour to de&s;troy the peace of his country, it is littte to &s;ay, that he wounds the ear of every rational and religious man; that he
<PB N="16" REF="022549_0014_0FB946C1D3AED180">
de&s;troys the peace of every good man; and puts the gro&s;&s;e&s;t affront upon his under&s;tanding, by en|tertaining him with the language of hell.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE we &s;hould a&s;k the &s;wearer, what po&s;&s;ible plea can you urge in &s;upport of this &s;hocking and abominable practice? We are not to expect from him any rational or &s;atisfactory an&s;wer. For will he pretend views of profit or worldly advantage? Who ever heard of wealth, honor, or reputation, acquired in this way? It is true, in ca&s;es of direct perjury, &s;omething of this kind may often be the con&s;equence; but the common &s;wearer has nothing to do with this: And few I believe will pretend to &s;ay, that they have ever made a friend; procured a legacy, inheritance, place, pen&s;ion, or donation, becau&s;e they were remarkable proficients in bla&s;|phemy. On the contrary, this argument lies again&s;t him &s;trongly, in more re&s;pects than one; for it is not only repugnant to the laws of God, but is pro|vided by our laws, that all offences of this nature &s;hall be puni&s;hed: So that a man gets nothing by this practice, but poverty as well as infamy. As to his gaining honor, the portion that comes to his
<PB N="17" REF="022549_0015_0FB946C3278343D0">
&s;hare, is to be ranked in the mo&s;t abject and lowe&s;t cla&s;s; among the very dregs and outca&s;ts of the people. Is fame and reputation his view? Here perhaps he may &s;ucceed better; but yet he mu&s;t wait a little for his harve&s;t, 'till he is received into that &s;ociety, where alone he can find fit companions for him, and where it may be con&s;idered as &s;ome kind of excellency perhaps (&s;uch as it is) to be mo&s;t a devil, and to come neare&s;t the grand pattern of bla&s;phemy and impiety. Perhaps the &s;wearer may imagine that oaths give grace and &s;pirit to his di&s;|cour&s;e, and to him&s;elf the character of courage and vivacity. But who are to be his judges? The &s;en|&s;ible part of mankind, who have the be&s;t right to that office. He mu&s;t not appeal to, and the aban|doned them&s;elves dare not publickly &s;ide with him, were they ever &s;o much inclined by opinion, which I am per&s;uaded they are not. The only creatures who are likely to favor him on this occa&s;ion, &s;eem to be the inhabitants of a certain region, where pro|bably bla&s;phemy is the reigning wit. But let him enjoy the applau&s;e of devils unenvied; few will grudge him his admirers, who con&s;ider that every peal of laughter thus rai&s;ed, will co&s;t him a groan
<PB N="18" REF="022549_0016_0FB946C4A2247A80">
in the internal pri&s;on; and the mirth which is to &s;ucceed it, &s;hall con&s;i&s;t in weeping, wailing, and gna&s;hing of teeth. I will not &s;uppo&s;e that there can be a wretch &s;o abandoned as to a&s;&s;ert that there is a plea&s;ure, a &s;elf-&s;atisfaction in common &s;wearing; in bla&s;pheming the &s;acred name of the great God; in violating po&s;itive ordinances, as well human as divine. Sure devils them&s;elves cannot derive agree|able &s;en&s;ations from &s;o &s;hocking a practice. In &s;hort, in every light it can be viewed; in all po&s;|&s;ible con&s;iderations; common &s;wearing is the mo&s;t irrational, the lea&s;t defen&s;ible, of any in the whole catalogue of human vices: For it expo&s;es a man to the hearty contempt and abhorrence of every good man; to the lo&s;s of his property by the penal laws, if the magi&s;trates and the &s;ober part of the people would have &s;pirit enough to put them in force; and to the certain lo&s;s of all that is truly valuable, even eternal happine&s;s hereafter, from the ju&s;t re|&s;entments of an injured God; without the lea&s;t triffle in the world in exchange for them; without the po&s;&s;ibility of attaining either plea&s;ure, profit, honor, or any other u&s;eful acqui&s;ition by the bar|gain. It has not even the common pleas of other
<PB N="19" REF="022549_0017_0FB946C61F9DE710">
vices to be urged in its behalf. There are &s;everal crimes which a man may, with &s;ome little appear|ance of advantage, charge upon nature; but here every thing of that kind is out of the que&s;tion; and neither con&s;titution nor appetite will &s;tand him in any &s;tead. For certainly a man will not think of &s;aying that he has a con&s;titutional propen&s;ity to bla&s;pheme; as the prodigal, the mi&s;er, the wanton, &amp;c. may urge for their re&s;pective vices; or an ap|petite to &s;wear, as the glutton avows to the delights of his palate. Perhaps every &s;yllable he can po&s;&s;i|bly urge in his excu&s;e, may be reduced to the&s;e three pleas;&mdash;<HI>pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;habit</HI>&mdash;and <HI>inadvertency.</HI> But I would not have him build much upon either of them; for in the fir&s;t place, whatever is in it&s;elf ab&s;olutely evil and unwarrantable, can never &s;atisfy or excu&s;e what re&s;ults from it. A man &s;wears be|cau&s;e he is in a <HI>pa&s;&s;ion:</HI> But why is he in a pa&s;&s;ion? Does he not know that intemperate anger is it&s;elf almo&s;t one of the greate&s;t faults a man can be guilty of? Does not he know that it &s;tands expre&s;sly for|bidden by the letter of &s;cripture, which tells him he mu&s;t be &s;low to wrath? That furious anger was not made for him that is born of a woman; that he
<PB N="20" REF="022549_0018_0FB946C7AC13BCB8">
&s;hould be angry and &s;in not. Does he not know that the wrath of man worketh not the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God? Will a man then &s;wear becau&s;e he is in a pa&s;&s;ion? And one great prohibition is on this very account; le&s;t he &s;hould be tempted to bla&s;|pheme, and to take the name of his God in vain. If a man &s;ays he &s;wears by dint of <HI>habit,</HI> this is ma|king the ca&s;e ten times wor&s;e; for an habitual cu&s;|tom of &s;inning, is certainly a greater degree of guilt than an occa&s;ional lap&s;e. But how did he acquire that habit? Was it not by an apparent failure in his duty, both to God and man? But be this habit ever &s;o &s;trong, he mu&s;t &s;hake it off, rea&s;on as well as religion requires it; nay, his own &s;afety demands it of him, unle&s;s he has a mind to experience the truth of another nece&s;&s;ary deduction, and run without fur|ther thought into eternal ruin, becau&s;e he has a habit of de&s;erving it. Even <HI>inadvertency</HI> will not &s;erve his turn; when a man thinks it a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for a &s;ervant who has neglected his bu&s;ine&s;s, for that &s;ervant to reply, it was owing to his not troubling his head about his directions; then may he him&s;elf be allowed to urge the plea of inadver|tency for &s;wearing and taking God's name in vain,
<PB N="21" REF="022549_0019_0FB946C9270C98E8">
in open contempt of the mo&s;t &s;olemn, mo&s;t expre&s;s and frequent commands to the contrary. You &s;ee then how the affair &s;tands, without the lea&s;t counter-balance of profit or plea&s;ure, either pre&s;ent or future; the certain gain may be re&s;olved into contempt, ignominy, and perhaps poverty here&mdash;chains and darkne&s;s, vengeance and eternal mi&s;ery hereafter. It is not too late for the mo&s;t de&s;perate to retrieve him&s;elf; but for him who is a bla&s;phemer of ye&s;ter|day, to per&s;i&s;t in it but one moment longer, may be attended with the mo&s;t fatal and deplorable con&s;e|quences. Let me adjure therefore all &s;uch as are con&s;cious of any guilt in this re&s;pect, by all that they them&s;elves hold dear, to give the ob&s;ervations that I have made their due force. Not to look upon any affectionate remon&s;trances on this head as a matter of cour&s;e, or mere words only; but the effect of a real and &s;incere concern for their pre&s;ent and future well being.
