<P>_MY Purpo&s;e is only to relate Facts, as near as I am capable, from the be&s;t In|formation I could get: But it is pro|bable there may be &s;ome Mi&s;takes from Mi&s;information, ari&s;ing from the diffe|rent Apprehen&s;ion Men have had concerning Facts, and the different Intere&s;ts Men have in View: Some having a De&s;ire to render their own, and the Actions of their Friends better than they were, and the Actions of others wor&s;e than they ought to appear: Which makes it difficult in every Ca&s;e to obtain an impartial Account.</P>
<P>On the 15th of <HI>March</HI> 1743, 4, <HI>France</HI> being in&s;ti|gated by <HI>Spain</HI> (which was in open War with <HI>England</HI>) declared War with <HI>Great Britain: France</HI> had in Con|cert with <HI>Spain</HI> long laid this Scheme; hoping here|by to bring down <HI>England</HI> to their Will: And the a&s;piring young <HI>French</HI> Monarch hop'd to make him|&s;elf great; and render his Neighbours low.

<P>But in the Year 1745, <HI>July</HI> 5th, the <HI>Indian</HI> Enemy came to a Place called the <HI>Great Meadow</HI> on <HI>Connecti|cut River</HI> about &s;ixteen Miles above <HI>Fort-Dummer;</HI> and took one <HI>William Phips</HI> as he was hoeing his Corn.

<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 17. Some <HI>Indians</HI> came to a Place called <HI>Pequalog;</HI> kill'd and &s;calp'd one <HI>Ezekiel Wallingford,</HI> who was alone out at &s;ome Di&s;tance from the <HI>Fort.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 20. About <HI>&s;even</HI> or <HI>eight Hundred</HI> of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> came to <HI>Fort-Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> and laid Seige about twenty-four Hours. After which, they de&s;ired to &s;peak with the Officer; who admitted the Me&s;&s;en|ger into the <HI>Fort,</HI> who &s;aid in the Name of the Gene|ral, that if they would &s;urrender, they &s;hould be well u&s;ed. Our Men con&s;ulted together, finding they had not Ammunition to &s;tand them many Hours, tho' they had been &s;paring in firing; and con&s;idering the Num|ber of Sick they had in the Fort, tho't it their wi&s;e&s;t Method to make the be&s;t Capitulation they could: accordingly re&s;igned them&s;elves Pri&s;oners of War into the Hands of the <HI>French;</HI> with the General's Promi&s;e, that none of them &s;hould be given into the Hands of the <HI>Indians;</HI> and that the Sick, and &s;uch as could not travel &s;hould be carried. Yet notwith&s;tanding, He the next Day delivered one Half of our People into the Hands of the <HI>Indians;</HI> who the next Night kill'd <HI>one</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="006488_0010_10290F15D778AAC0">of our Men, who was &s;ick, rather than carry him. The <HI>French</HI> treated our Men civilly and tenderly: So al&s;o did the <HI>Indians</HI> tho&s;e with them according to their Manner. <HI>Thirty-two Men, Women</HI> and <HI>Children</HI> &s;ur|rendred; many of whom died in <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P>The Rea&s;on of this Garri&s;on's being lo&s;t, was, it's want of Ammunition; which had they been well &s;up|ply'd with, they might have defended the <HI>Fort,</HI> and done much greater Spoil on the Enemy than they did: yet we have had Intelligence that near <HI>fifty</HI> of the Ene|my were kill'd before the <HI>Fort</HI> &s;urrendered.</P>
<P>By who&s;e Neglect the <HI>Fort</HI> was lo&s;t, we know not; but it's probable had the Officer been deficient, he would have been di&s;graced. But want of Ammunition was not only the Calamity of that Fort; but al&s;o of the greater Part of our Garri&s;ons at that Time.</P>
<P>There was <HI>one Man</HI> kill'd in the Fight, and many died in Pri&s;on at <HI>Canada:</HI> Some are returned Home. And the <HI>Fort</HI> was burnt down; which it co&s;t the Pro|vince many Hundreds to re-build.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 22. As about ten of our Men were going from <HI>Deerfield</HI> to <HI>Colerain,</HI> two or three <HI>Indians</HI> lying by the Road, fired on them; &s;hot down one <HI>Con&s;tant Bli&s;s</HI> a <HI>Connecticut</HI> Soldier: the re&s;t made off as fa&s;t as they were able: The Indians &s;calp'd <HI>Bli&s;s:</HI> and finding &s;ome Rum our Men left; the <HI>Indians</HI> took it, got very merry with it, and (as they told afterwards) the next Morning when they awak'd, they were near one of the Garri&s;ons at <HI>Colerain:</HI> The Rum had lik'd to have proved as fatal to them as to our Men.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 25. <HI>Thirty</HI> of this Army came to <HI>Deerfield;</HI> not being &s;atisfied with what was done at <HI>Fort-Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts;</HI> and fell upon &s;ome People in the South Part of the Meadow: They kill'd and &s;calp'd <HI>Samuel Allen, Eleazer Hawks,</HI> Jun. <HI>Oliver Am&s;den, Simeon Am&s;den,</HI> of
<PB N="10" REF="006488_0011_10290EE81ACFA9A8"><HI>Deerfield,</HI> and <HI>Adonjah Gillet,</HI> a Soldier: they wound|ed <HI>Eunice Allen;</HI> and took <HI>Samuel Allen,</HI> a Child of about nine Years old: <HI>Allen</HI> kill'd one of the Enemy ju&s;t before he was kill'd; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed another was kill'd by &s;ome other Per&s;on.</P>
<P>&rindx; Had there not been a continual firing in the Town from Day to Day; the People would have took the Alarm, and might have been upon the Enemy before ever they could have got out of the Meadow: Which &s;hews the great Nece&s;&s;ity of Order and Di&s;ci|pline in Frontier Towns.</P>
<P>This <HI>Summer</HI> a Proclamation was i&s;&s;ued for inli&s;ting Soliders for an Expedition again&s;t <HI>Canada:</HI> and a great Number freely inli&s;ted, hoping the Time was coming, that God would deliver us out of the Hands of our Enemies in <HI>Canada:</HI> and the Soldiers e&s;pecially inli&s;ted out of the Garri&s;ons; &s;ome in order to be freed from the Province Service, which they were weary of; others with &s;ome more generous Views for the public Good: and all Endeavours to put a Check to the Fury of the Enemy were &s;topt: the whole Concern was to get ready for the expected Expedition: but how this turned out, we all know: great Numbers of Men kept in Pay and Idlene&s;s 'till di&s;banded, to the Ruin of many of them, and the great Hurt of the Country.</P>

The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fired at them, &amp; broke the Leg of one of them.</P>

<P><HI>April.</HI> 7. An Army of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> came to <HI>Number Four,</HI> and laid Siege to the Garri&s;on. Capt. <HI>Stevens</HI> being there with about <HI>thirty</HI> Men, made all nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ion for their Defence; e&s;pecially by digging Trenches from under the <HI>Fort,</HI> about a Yard outwards in &s;everal Places, at &s;o near a Di&s;tance to each other, as by throwing Water we might put out the Fire, in Ca&s;e the Enemy by their four Wheel Carriages loaden with Faggots &s;houl'd &s;et any outward Part of the Fort of Fire. They continued &s;hooting, and throwing their <HI>Fire-Arrows</HI> for near two Days: and then de&s;ired to &s;peak with the Captain, who admitted three of them into the Fort; three of our Men going out to the Enemy at the &s;ame Time: they demanded the Fort; &amp; promis'd our Men to carry them &s;afe to <HI>Mount-Real,</HI> to their Friends, if they would &s;urrender: but the Captain a&s;&s;ured them he &s;hould not re&s;ign the Fort.&mdash; After which they continued firing, and made &s;ome Preparation to Storm the Fort, till the next Day; and then they reque&s;ted the Captain to &s;ell them &s;ome Corn; he told them he would grant them five Bu&s;hels of Corn for every Ho&s;tage they &s;hould &s;end into the
<PB N="12" REF="006488_0013_10290EEC4F7F7010" MS="y">Fort, to be kept till the Enemy &s;hould bring and deli|ver &s;o many of our Captives from <HI>Canada.</HI> But on the third Day they drew off, having done no Mi&s;chief, except &s;lightly wounding <HI>Jo&s;eph Ely</HI> and <HI>John Brown.</HI> Governour <HI>Knowles</HI> was &s;o plea&s;ed with Capt. <HI>Stevens</HI>'s Conduct, as to make him a Pre&s;ent of a very co&s;tly Silver-hilted Sword.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 14. This or another Army came to <HI>Northfield,</HI> with a De&s;ign to have taken Part of the Town. The next Day a little after Sun-&s;et, they kill'd and &s;calp'd <HI>Nathaniel Dickin&s;on</HI> and <HI>A&s;ahel Burt,</HI> as they were bring|ing Cows out of the Woods; and then drew off in the Night to <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> and the two <HI>A&s;huelots,</HI> &amp; burnt down tho&s;e three Towns; which a little before had been de&s;erted by the Inhabitants, becau&s;e the Soldiers were all drawn off without any Orders to a&s;&s;i&s;t the In|habitants in removing or carrying off their Sub&s;tance:</P>
<P>&rindx; Such little Concern has there been to the poor People in the Frontiers at other Times as well as this.</P>

There immediately

<HEAD>REMARKS. The following <HI>Remarks</HI> are ea&s;y and na|tural from the preceeding H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters">y.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1&s;t. WHAT a great Difference there is between our managing a War, and our Enemies: The mo&s;t we do is to defend our &s;elves at Home; but they are for an offen&s;ive War. And it is true if they have any, they mu&s;t have this; for a defen&s;ive War they can have none with us: For not a Man of ours has &s;een a <HI>French</HI> Settlement all this War, except &s;uch as were carried Captive or went with a Flagg of Truce.</P>
<P N="2">2ndly. It is a rare thing we can obtain an <HI>Indian</HI> Scalp, let us do what Spoil we will upon them; &s;o careful are they to carry off and conceal their Dead. For at <HI>Fort-Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> where it is probable near <HI>&s;ixty</HI> have been killed, never have been found more than <HI>three Scalps;</HI> which &s;hows us that our Men will not venture out after the Enemy on any Scalping Act what&s;oever: Our Men will not venture their Lives and Service, on &s;uch uncertain Encourage|ments; if they &s;hould be much greater than ever they have been. The like is demon&s;trated at Number <HI>Four,</HI> where they have killed &s;o many of the Enemy, never a Scalp could be recovered.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. We may ob&s;erve, Of how much Importance the Enemy judge tho&s;e <HI>two Forts</HI> at Number <HI>Four</HI> and <HI>Hoo&s;uck,</HI> to be to us, Hence their repeated Endeavours to de&s;troy them; which they would not do, were they not advantageous to us, and in their Way in coming upon us.&mdash; And it &s;hows how much it mu&s;t encourage our Enemies, for us to give up either of them.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. We may ob&s;erve, How &s;afely the Enemy can draw off, when they have done Mi&s;cief. I think but <HI>one</HI> In&s;tance has there been all this War of our pur&s;uing, and overtaking the Enemy to do any Spoil on them, and there are many Rea&s;ons for it: One is, that no Body may move 'til an Account is &s;ent to the <HI>chief Colonel;</HI> and then Men mu&s;t be mu&s;tered, which takes &s;o long a Time that there is no po&s;&s;ibility of our taking them. Another Rea&s;on is, that we never have Men near, equipp'd to pur&s;ue them in the Woods; and when they have gone a few Miles in the Woods, they are di&s;|couraged and return Home.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="21" REF="006488_0022_10290F28CE63B740">
5thly. It is ob&s;ervable, That the continual changing of Schemes renders all Mea&s;ures for the War un&s;ucce&s;sful. Before any one &s;ingle Scheme is tried, it is flung up, and nothing ever pro&s;ecuted to Advantage: There is &s;carce any one Scheme of more than <HI>&s;ix Months</HI> continuance.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. We may ob&s;erve, That when the Province have voted any Number of Men for a particular Service; by that Time the Commi&s;&s;ary can furni&s;h the Men with their Provi&s;ions, their Time is expired; and this was the Ca&s;e the Summer pa&s;t: It took the greater Part of the Summer to &s;upply the Garri&s;ons with Provi&s;ions; they were &s;o &s;carce: And the <HI>Soldiers</HI> who were de&s;igned as Scouts towards <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> were a good Part of their Time employed in guarding Provi&s;ions to the <HI>Forts.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7thly. It is ob&s;ervable to all who know the State of the&s;e Fron|tiers, That there is not due Provi&s;ion made to furni&s;h Men out on any Occa&s;ion after the Enemy. There is neither <HI>Bread</HI> nor <HI>Meat, Shoes, Blanketts,</HI> &amp;c, that a Number of Men may take on any &s;ud|den Occa&s;ion. They have their Bread to bake, their Meat to cook, and other Things to get; when they &s;hould be on their March: And &s;o long as this is the Ca&s;e, the Enemy never need fear our annoying of them when they have di&s;tre&s;&s;ed us.</P>
<P N="8">8thly. It is ob&s;ervable, That all this War we have never kept Men in the Woods towards <HI>Crown-Point</HI> to di&s;cover their large Bodies coming down upon us, and give Notice of an approaching Enemy: So that they come &s;ecurely Week after Week upon us; yea, we have &s;ince found that the Enemy have camp'd <HI>&s;everal Months</HI> within <HI>thirty</HI> or <HI>forty Miles</HI> of <HI>Fort-Dummer.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9thly. Another Thing ob&s;erveable, Is the great <HI>Temptation</HI> Sol|diers have to be <HI>unfaithful</HI> in the Service. For there is no Di&s;tinc|tion made, as to their <HI>Wages,</HI> between a Soldier <HI>po&s;ted</HI> in an Old <HI>Town,</HI> one in a <HI>Garri&s;on,</HI> and one <HI>marching</HI> in the Woods; who when he is in the Woods, wears out as many Cloths as his Wages will procure, be&s;ides all his Hard&s;hips and Sufferings. Soldiers therefore choo&s;e to Lodge in the Garri&s;on; and think hard if they mu&s;t be kept in the Woods, when others have as much Pay in <HI>Old</HI> Towns, who eat and lodge well.</P>
<P N="10">10thly. <HI>We</HI> differ much from the <HI>French</HI> with Re&s;pect to the War. They will not give Men Commi&s;&s;ions, 'till they have been out in the War and done &s;ome Spoil on their Enemies. If the like Method was pacti&s;ed with us; there would be fewer Commi&s;|&s;ions,
<PB N="22" REF="006488_0023_10290EFEEF517AC8" MS="y">and more its probable would be done on the Enemy, in order to obtain them: But &s;o long as no Regard is had to this in pro|moting of Men, we can't expect Men will exert them&s;elves as they ought to do.</P>
<P N="11">11thly. The Reader may ob&s;erve, How much the People in the <HI>We&s;tern-Frontiers,</HI> mu&s;t be di&s;tre&s;s'd by the War; and how fal&s;ely they judge, who think the War is an Advantage to them. Their Ca&s;e is mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing: The repeated Alarms take them off from their Bu&s;ine&s;s <HI>Day after Day</HI> for <HI>forty</HI> or <HI>fifty</HI> Miles together. And the Reader is to ob&s;erve, that in the preceeding Hi&s;tory there is no mention of great Numbers of Times of the Enemy being &s;een and &s;hot at, both in the Night and Day Time; and of their &s;etting open Gates, and turning Creatures into Fields to devour Crops. It was not the De&s;ign of the Author to give you an Account of the People's Lo&s;&s;es; but of the Mi&s;chief done: If any envy the In|habitants in the Frontiers their Portion, they may come and take their Lot with them.</P>
<P N="12">12thly, It ought to be ob&s;erved, That great Inju&s;tice is done the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> in the <HI>Frontiers</HI> in <HI>pre&s;&s;ing</HI> them out of their Bu&s;ine&s;s, into the Province Service, either to follow the Enemy or convoy Stores, and not rewarding them &s;uitably. They are &s;ent out Day after Day with their Hor&s;es, and have <HI>not half</HI> &s;o much per Day as they mu&s;t give a Man to labour for them in the mean Time.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, We may ob&s;erve, Than in this War, as we encrea&s;ed <HI>our</HI> Number of Men in our <HI>Forts</HI> or <HI>Scouts,</HI> the Enemy have in|crea&s;ed <HI>their</HI> Numbers; and the longer the War continued, the oftner they came, and the more bold they grew. Which &s;hows us, what we mu&s;t expect, if the War breaks out a-new: E&s;pecially at this Time, when there is no Provi&s;ion made for Men in our Frontiers.</P>
