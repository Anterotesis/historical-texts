<HEAD>DEDICATION, <HI>To the</HI> PEOPLE <HI>who &s;hall live in the</HI> DAYS <HI>of the</HI> MILLENNIUM.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>HAIL, YE HAPPY PEOPLE, HIGHLY FAVOURED OF THE LORD!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO you the following treati&s;e on the Millen|nium is dedicated, as you will live in that happy era, and enjoy the good of it in a much higher degree, than it can be now enjoyed in the pro&s;pect of it. And that you may know, if this book &s;hall be conveyed down to your time, what is now thought of you, and of the happy day, in which you will come on the &s;tage of life. You will be able to &s;ee the mi&s;takes which are now made on this head; and how far what is advanced here, is agreeable to that which is noted in the &s;cripture of truth, and a true and proper de&s;cription of the events which are to take place; and to rectify every mi&s;take. All is therefore humbly &s;ubmitted to your better judgment.</P>
<P>When you &s;hall learn what a variety of errors, in doctrine and practice, have been, and are now imbibed and propagated; and in what an imper|fect and defective manner they are oppo&s;ed and confuted; and the truth explained and defended: And ob&s;erve how many defects and mi&s;takes there are in tho&s;e writings which contain mo&s;t truth, and come neare&s;t to the &s;tandard of all religious truth, the holy &s;cripture, you will be ready to wonder how all this could be, where divine revela|tion is enjoyed. But your benevolence and can|dour, will make all proper allowances, for all the
<PB N="iv" REF="025635_0003_0FCEAC0A005A4948">prejudices and darkne&s;s which take place in the&s;e days, and pity us; while your piety will lead you to a&s;cribe the greater light and advantages which you will enjoy, and your better di&s;cerning and judgment, not unto your&s;elves, but to the di&s;|tingui&s;hing, &s;overeign grace of God.</P>
<P>Though you have yet no exi&s;tence, neverthele&s;s, the faith of the chri&s;tians in this and in former ages, beholds you "at hand to come;" and real|izing your future exi&s;tence and character, you are greatly e&s;teemed and loved; and the pious have great joy in you, while they are con&s;tantly, and with great earne&s;tne&s;s praying for you. They who make mention of the Lord, will not keep &s;ilence, nor give him any re&s;t, till he e&s;tabli&s;h, and till he make Jeru&s;alem a prai&s;e in the earth. For you they are praying and labouring, and to you they are min|i&s;tring; and without you they cannot be made per|fect. And you will enter into their labours, and reap the happy fruit of their prayers, toils and &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>They will be in heaven, with the holy angels and the &s;pririts of the ju&s;t made perfect, when you will come upon the &s;tage in this world; and they will rejoice in you, in your knowledge, benevo|lence, piety, righteou&s;ne&s;s and happine&s;s: And all their pa&s;t prayers for you will be turned into joy and prai&s;e. And you will, in due time, be gather|ed together with them unto the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in his eternal kingdom, and join in &s;eeing and prai&s;ing him forever, a&s;cribing ble&s;&s;ing, and honour, and glory, and power, unto the only true God, the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t.

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>A PARTICULAR hi&s;tory of the church of Chri&s;t, from the days of the Apo&s;tles, to this time; of the various changes through which it has pa&s;t; of the doctrines which have been taught and maintained; of the di&s;cipline, wor&s;hip, and man|ners, which have taken place; of the grand apo&s;tacy in the church of Rome, and of the reformation, &amp;c. might be prop|erly &s;ubjoined to the foregoing &s;y&s;tem, were it not that this has been done by a number of writers already; &s;o that all who are di&s;po&s;ed to acquaint them&s;elves with eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, may obtain this information by books already extant; Which, at the &s;ame time, &s;erve to confirm the truth and divine original of chri&s;|tianity, by di&s;covering, in how many in&s;tances the &s;tate of the church, and the events which have had a particular re&s;pect to it, have been foretold, and have taken place according to the pre|dictions. This &s;ubject has been particularly illu&s;trated by Mr. Lowman, in his "Paraphra&s;e and Notes on the Revelation of St. John." And &s;ince, more largely, by Bi&s;hop Newton, in his "Di&s;&s;ertation on the Prophecies, which have remarkably been fulfilled, and at this time are fulfilling in the world."</P>
<P>A treati&s;e on the Millennium, however, and of the future &s;tate of the church of Chri&s;t, from this time to the end of the world, as it is predicted and de&s;cribed in divine revelation, is thought
<PB N="6" REF="025635_0005_0FCEAC0D52DC1448">proper and important, not only as it has been more than once re|ferred to in the preceding work; but as it appears not to be believed by many; and not to be well under&s;tood by more; or attended to by mo&s;t, as an important event; full of in&s;truction; &s;uited to &s;upport, comfort and encourage chri&s;tians, in the pre&s;ent dark appearance of things, re&s;pecting the intere&s;t of Chri&s;t, and his church; and to animate them to faith, patience and per&s;ever|ance in obedience to Chri&s;t; putting on the hope of &s;alvation for an helmet. And to excite them more earne&s;tly to pray for the advancement and coming of the kingdom of Chri&s;t: Of which kingdom, as it is to take place in this world, or of chri&s;|tianity it&s;elf, there cannot be &s;o clear, full and plea&s;ing an idea, if the &s;cripture doctrine of the Millennium be kept out of view.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t three centuries after the Apo&s;ties, the doctrine of the Millennium was believed and taught; but &s;o many unwor|thy and ab&s;urd things were by &s;ome advanced concerning it, that it afterwards fell into di&s;credit, and was oppo&s;ed, or pa&s;ted over in &s;ilence, by mo&s;t, until the reformation from popery. And then a number of enthu&s;ia&s;ts advanced &s;o many un&s;criptural and ridiculous notions concerning it, and made &s;uch a bad improve|ment of it, that many, if not mo&s;t of the orthodox, in oppo&s;ing them, were led to di&s;believe and oppo&s;e the doctrine in general; or to &s;ay little or nothing in favour of the doctrine, in any &s;en&s;e or view of it.</P>
<P>But few of the mo&s;t noted writers of the la&s;t century in Britain, or in other parts of the prote&s;tant world, have &s;aid any-thing to e&s;tabli&s;h or explain this doctrine: And they who have mentioned it, do appear, at lea&s;t the mo&s;t of them, not to have well under|&s;tood it. In the pre&s;ent century, there has been more attention to it; and the &s;criptures which relate to it, have been more care|fully con&s;idered, and explained by a number of writers; and it has been &s;et in a more rational, &s;criptural and important light, than before. Dr. Whitby, has written a treati&s;e on the Millen|nium. And Mr. Robert&s;on, and Mr. Lowman, have a&s;&s;erted and explained it in &s;ome mea&s;ure, in their expo&s;ition of the book of the revelation by the Apo&s;tle John; e&s;pecially the beginning of the twentieth chapter of that book. And the late Pre&s;ident Edwards, attended much to this &s;ubject, and wrote upon it more than any other divine in this century. In the year 1747, he publi&s;hed a book, entitled "An humble attempt to promote ex|plicit
<PB N="7" REF="025635_0006_0FCEAC0E81849878">agreement, and vi&s;ible union of God's people, in extraor|dinary prayer for the revival of religion, and the advancement of Chri&s;t's kingdom on earth, pur&s;uant to &s;cripture promi&s;es and prophecies concerning the la&s;t time." In which he produces the evidence from &s;cripture, that &s;uch a day is yet to come. And in a po&s;thumous publication of his, intitled "A hi&s;tory of the work of Redemption," this &s;ubject is brought into view, and par|ticularly con&s;idered. There is al&s;o extant, a &s;ermon on the Mil|lennium, by the late Dr. Bellamy. And other writers have occa&s;ionally mentioned it. And this &s;ubject appears to be brought more particularly into view in the public prayers and preaching, and in conver&s;ation, in this age, than in former times; and the doctrine of the Millennium is more generally believed, and better under&s;tood.</P>
<P>This is rather an encouragement to attempt farther to explain and illu&s;trate, this important, plea&s;ing, u&s;eful &s;ubject, in which eve|ry chri&s;tian is &s;o much intere&s;ted, than a rea&s;on why nothing more &s;hould be &s;aid upon it. The &s;ubject is far from being exhau&s;ted; and as the church advances nearer to the Millennium &s;tate, we have rea&s;on to think the predictions in divine revelation re&s;pecting it, will be better under&s;tood; and the minds of chri&s;tians will be more excited to great attention to this &s;ubject, and &s;trong de&s;ires to look into tho&s;e things, and to earne&s;t longings and prayers for the coming of the kingdom of Chri&s;t, as it will take place in that day. And all this is to be effected, by means and proper at|tempts and exertions. "Many &s;hall run to and fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and know|ledge &s;hall be increa&s;ed."</P>
<P>The prophecies of events which are yet to take place, cannot be &s;o fully under&s;tood before the&s;e events come to pa&s;s, as they will be when they are fulfilled; and there is great danger of making mi&s;takes about them. And it is certain, that many have made mi&s;takes, &s;ince they have made very different and oppo&s;ite con|fiructions of the &s;ame predictions; and therefore all cannot be right. So far as the prophecies which re&s;pect the Millennium, of which there are many, can be under&s;tood, and the real mean|ing of them be made plain, by a careful and diligent attention to them, and comparing them with each other, men may go on &s;afe ground, and be certain of their accompli&s;hment. And whatever is a plain and undeniable con&s;equence, from what is expre&s;sly pre|dicted, is equally revealed in the prediction, as an event, or cir|cum&s;tance
<PB N="8" REF="025635_0007_0FCEAC10E2D54838">of an event, nece&s;&s;arily included in it. But every opinion re&s;pecting future events, which is matter of conjecture on|ly, however probable it may be in the view of him who propo&s;es it, ought to be entertained with mode&s;ty and diffidence.</P>
<P>The following treati&s;e on the Millennium, is not de&s;igned &s;o much to advance any new &s;entiments concerning it, which have never before been offered to the public, as to revive and repeat tho&s;e which have been already &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;ome au|thors, which are thought to be very important, and ought to be under&s;tood, and kept con&s;tantly in the view of all, in order to their having a proper conception of the church of Chri&s;t in this world, and reading the &s;criptures to their be&s;t advantage, and greate&s;t comfort: Though perhaps &s;omething will be advanced, re&s;pecting the events which, according to &s;cripture, are to take place between the pre&s;ent time, and the introduction of the happy &s;tate of the church, which have not been before &s;o particularly con|&s;idered.</P>

<PB N="9" REF="025635_0008_0FCEAC12468904F8">
<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> In which it is proved from Scripture, that the church of Chri&s;t is to come to a &s;tate of pro&s;perity in this world, which it has never yet enjoyed; in which it will con|tinue at lea&s;t a thou&s;and years.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t revelation of a Redeemer, in the prediction &s;poken to the &s;erpent, may be con&s;idered as implying the de&s;truc|tion of the kingdom of the devil in this world, by the wi&s;dom and energy of Chri&s;t. "He &s;hall brui&s;e thy head, and thou &s;halt brui&s;e his heal."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. iii. 18.</NOTE> Satan has brui&s;ed the heal of Chri&s;t, in the &s;ufferings and di&s;honour he has been in&s;trumental of bringing upon him, and in the oppo&s;ition he has made to the intere&s;t and church of Chri&s;t, in this world. And it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that Chri&s;t &s;hall brui&s;e his head in this world, by de&s;troying his intere&s;t and kingdom among men, and gaining a conque&s;t over him, in the &s;truggle and war which has taken place between the Redeemer and &s;educer of men. And by the Redeemer's <HI>brui&s;ing the head</HI> of the &s;erpent, is &s;ignified that he will not de&s;troy him by the mere exertion of his power, but that by his &s;uperiour wi&s;|dom, he will confound and defeat &s;atan, in all his &s;ubtilty and cunning, on which he depends &s;o much, and by which he aims to di&s;appoint Chri&s;t, and defeat him in his de&s;igns. And by this he will make a glorious di&s;play of his wi&s;dom, as well as of his power, while he di&s;covers the cra&s;tine&s;s of &s;atan to be fooli&s;hne&s;s, and di&s;appoints him in his devices, carrying all the coun&s;el of this cunning froward enemy headlong. If all this could not be gathered from this pa&s;&s;age, con&s;idered by it&s;elf; yet that this is the real meaning, will perhaps appear, from what has already taken place in accompli&s;hing this prediction; and from other prophecies re&s;pecting this, &s;ome of which are to be brought into view in the &s;equel: Without which the full meaning of this fir&s;t promi&s;e could not be known.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="025635_0009_0FCEAC13C0599D68">
In order to brui&s;e the head of the &s;erpent, in this &s;en&s;e, mo&s;t effectually; and turn his boa&s;ted wi&s;dom and cunning into fool|i&s;hne&s;s, and entirely defeat him in this way, he mu&s;t have oppor|tunity and advantage to try his &s;kill and power, and practi&s;e all his cunning, in oppo&s;ing Chri&s;t, and the &s;alvation of men. And in this way be overcome and wholly defeated, in the ruin of his intere&s;t and kingdom among men; &s;o that all his attempts &s;hall turn again&s;t him&s;elf, and be the occa&s;ion of making the victory and triumph of the Redeemer greater, more per&s;picuous and glori|ous, in the final prevalence of his kingdom on earth, by drawing all men to him; and de&s;troying the works and kingdom of &s;atan in this world, and &s;etting up his own on the ruins of it, and &s;o as to turn all the attempts and works of the devil again&s;t him, and render the whole &s;ub&s;ervient to his own intere&s;t and kingdom. And thus the coming and kingdom of Chri&s;t will be, "As the light of the morning, when the &s;un ri&s;eth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender gra&s;s &s;pringing out of the earth by clear &s;hining after rain." When the &s;un ri&s;es in a clear morning, af|ter a dark night, attended with clouds, rain and &s;torms, the morning is more plea&s;ant, beautiful and glorious, and the gra&s;s &s;prings and grows more fre&s;h and thrifty, than if it had not been preceded by &s;uch a &s;tormy night. So the pro&s;perity and glory of the church, when the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall ri&s;e upon it, with healing in his beams, will be enjoyed to a higher degree, and be more plea&s;ant and glorious, and Chri&s;t will be more glorified, than if it had not been preceded by a dreadful night of darkne&s;s, con|fu&s;ion and evil, by the wickedne&s;s of men, and the power and agency of &s;atan.</P>
<P>The words above cited, are the la&s;t words of David the Proph|et, and &s;weet P&s;almi&s;t of I&s;rael, and are a prophecy of the glorious event now under con&s;ideration. "The Spirit of the Lord &s;pake by me, and his word was in my tongue. The God of I&s;rael &s;aid, the Rock of I&s;rael &s;pake by me. He that ruleth over men mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God. And he &s;hall be like the morning, when the &s;un ri&s;eth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender gra&s;s &s;pringing out of the earth, by clear &s;hining after rain."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. xxiii. 2, 3, 4.</NOTE> The fir&s;t words may be rendered &s;o as to give the true &s;en&s;e more clearly. "He who is to rule over men (i. e. the Me&s;&s;iah) is ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God." The words <HI>mu&s;t be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>
<PB N="11" REF="025635_0010_0FCEAC16102F3BF8">in our tran&s;lation, are not in the original, and the helping verb <HI>is,</HI> which is commonly not expre&s;&s;ed, but under&s;tood, in the Heb|rew, &s;hould have been &s;upplied; "He that ruleth, or is to rule over men, <HI>is</HI> ju&s;t." This is evidently a prophecy concerning Chri&s;t, his church and kingdom, when he &s;hall take to him&s;elf his great power, and reign in his kingdom, which &s;hall &s;ucceed the reign of &s;atan during the four preceding monarchies, which were fir&s;t to take place, which will be more particularly explained, as we proceed in examining the prophecies of this great event, <HI>The latter day glory.</HI> And that the&s;e words of David, are a prediction of the reign of Chri&s;t on earth, after the long prevalence of &s;atan and wicked men, is farther evident from the words which follow, relative to the &s;ame thing. "But the &s;ons of Belial &s;hall <HI>all of them</HI> as thorns be thur&s;t away, becau&s;e they cannot be taken with hands. But the man that &s;hall touch them, mu&s;t be fenced with iron, and the &s;taff of a &s;pear, and they &s;hall be utterly burnt with fire in the &s;ame place."</P>
<P>Exactly parallel with this prophecy, is that of the Prophet Mali|chi. "Behold, the day cometh, that &s;hall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, all that do wickedly, &s;hall be &s;tubble, and the day that cometh &s;hall burn them up, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts, that it &s;hall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name, &s;hall the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s ari&s;e with healing in his wings; and ye &s;hall go forth and grow up as the calves in the &s;tall. And ye &s;hall tread down the wicked; for they &s;hall be a&s;hes under the foles of your feet, in the day that I &s;hall do this, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mal. iv. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>But to return from this, which may &s;eem to be &s;ome digre&s;&s;ion, or anticipation: The great and remarkable promi&s;e, &s;o often made to Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob, and more than once mentioned by the Apo&s;tles, will next be con&s;idered. This promi&s;e was made to Abraham, and of him, three times. "In thee &s;hall all the families of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed."
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xii. 3.</NOTE> "All the nations of the earth &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed in him."
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. xviii. 18.</NOTE> "And in thy &s;eed &s;hall the nations of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed."
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Chap. xxii. 18.</NOTE> And this &s;ame promi&s;e is made to I&s;aac. "I will perform the oath which I &s;ware unto Abraham thy father&mdash;and in thy &s;eed &s;hall all the nations of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed."
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Chap. xxvi. 4.</NOTE> And to Jacob. "In thee and in thy &s;eed, &s;hall all the families of the earth
<PB N="12" REF="025635_0011_0FCEAC178E67D5F0">be ble&s;&s;ed."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. xxviii. 14.</NOTE> The Apo&s;tle Peter mentions this promi&s;e as refer|ring to the days of the go&s;pel. "Ye are the children of the Prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, &s;aying unto Abraham, And in thy &s;eed &s;hall all the kindreds of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed."
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts iii. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> The Apo&s;tle Paul &s;peaks of this promi&s;e as referring to Chri&s;t, and all who believe in him, making him to be the promi&s;ed &s;eed, and believers in him to be tho&s;e exclu&s;ively who are ble&s;&s;ed in him, in whom the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">ed good takes place. "Know ye therefore, that they which are of faith, the &s;ame are the children of Abraham. And the &s;cripture, fore&s;eeing that God would ju&s;tify the heathen through faith, preached before the go&s;pel unto Abraham, &s;aying, In thee &s;hall all nations be ble&s;&s;ed. So then they which be of faith, are ble&s;&s;ed with faithful Abraham.&mdash; Now to Abraham and his &s;eed were the promi&s;es made. He &s;aith not, And to &s;eeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy &s;eed, which is Chri&s;t."
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 7, 8, 9, 16.</NOTE></P>
<P>This prediction and promi&s;e is very expre&s;s and exten&s;ive, That all the families, kindreds and nations of the earth, &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed in Chri&s;t, by their becoming believers in him. This has never yet taken place, and cannot be fulfilled, unle&s;s chri&s;tianity and the kingdom of Chri&s;t &s;hall take place and prevail in the world to a va&s;tly higher degree, and more exten&s;ively and univer&s;ally, than has yet come to pa&s;s; and all nations, all the inhabitants of the earth, &s;hall become believers in him, agreeable to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> number of other prophecies, &s;ome of which will be mentioned in this &s;ection.</P>
<P>The reign of Chri&s;t on earth, with his church and people, and the happine&s;s and glory of that time, is a &s;ubject often mentioned, predicted and celebrated in the book of P&s;alms. To mention all that is there &s;poken with reference to that happy time, would be to tran&s;cribe great part of that book. Only the following pa&s;&s;ages will now be mentioned, which are thought abundantly to prove that the kingdom of Chri&s;t is to prevail and flouri&s;h in this world, as it has never yet done; and the church is to be brought to a &s;tate of purity, pro&s;perity and happine&s;s on earth, which has not yet taken place, and &s;o as to include all nations, and fill the world.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd P&s;alm, it is predicted and promi&s;ed, that the Son of God &s;hall inherit and po&s;&s;e&s;s all nations, to the ends of the earth; which nece&s;&s;arily implies, that his church and kingdom
<PB N="13" REF="025635_0012_0FCEAC190082D048">&s;hall be thus exten&s;ive, reaching to the ends of the earth, and in|cluding all the nations and men on earth. "I have &s;et my king upon my holy hill of Zion. I will declare the decree: The Lord hath &s;aid unto me, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.

<P>The twenty &s;econd P&s;alm contains a prophecy of the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t; and the glory that &s;hall follow; and of the latter it is &s;aid; "The meek &s;hall eat and be &s;atisfied. They &s;hall prai&s;e the Lord that &s;eek him: Your heart &s;hall live forever. All the ends of the world &s;hall remember, and turn unto the Lord: And all the kindreds of the nations &s;hall wor&s;hip before thee. For the kingdom is the Lord's; and he is the Governor among the nations: For evil doers &s;hall be cut off: But tho&s;e that wait upon the Lord, they &s;hall inherit the earth. For yet a little while, and the wicked &s;hall not be; yea, thou &s;halt diligently con&s;ider his place, and it &s;hall not be. But the meek &s;hall inherit the earth, and delight them&s;elves in the abundance of peace."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xxxvii. 9, 10, 11.</NOTE> This is a prediction of an event which has never taken place yet. Evil doers and the wicked, have in all ages hitherto po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the earth, and flouri&s;hed and reigned in the world. When it is promi&s;ed, that they who wait upon the Lord, and the meek &s;hall inherit the earth, and delight them&s;elves in the abundance of peace, the meaning mu&s;t be, that per&s;ons of this character will yet have the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the earth, and fill the world, when no place &s;hall be found for the wicked, as they &s;hall be all de&s;troyed, and their cau&s;e wholly lo&s;t. And all of this character who have lived be|fore this time, and waited upon the Lord in the exerci&s;e of meek|ne&s;s, &s;hall flouri&s;h and live in their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and in the pro&s;perity and triumph of the cau&s;e and intere&s;t, in which they lived and died. This is agreeable to other prophecies of this kind, as will be &s;hewn in the &s;equel. "All the ends of the earth &s;hall remember and turn unto the Lord: And all the kindreds of the nations &s;hall wor&s;hip before thee&punc;" Who can believe that this has ever yet been?

<P>The whole of the &s;ixty &s;eventh P&s;alm is a prediction of the &s;ame event, and of the &s;ame time, which is yet to come. It is a prayer of the church that &s;uch a time may take place; at the &s;ame time expre&s;&s;ing her a&s;&s;urance that it was coming; and the whole is a prophecy of it. "God be merciful unto us, and ble&s;s us; and cau&s;e his face to &s;hine upon us. That thy way may be known upon earth, thy &s;aving health among <HI>all nations.</HI> Let the people prai&s;e thee, O God; let <HI>all the people</HI> prai&s;e thee. O let the na|tions be glad, and &s;ing for joy; for thou &s;halt judge the people righteou&s;ly, and govern the nations upon earth. Then &s;hall the earth yield her increa&s;e; and God, even our God, &s;hall ble&s;s us. God &s;hall ble&s;s us; and <HI>all the ends of the earth &s;hall fear him.</HI>"</P>
<P>The &s;eventy &s;econd P&s;alm, the title of which is, "A P&s;alm for Solomon," contains a prophecy of Chri&s;t and his kingdom, of whom Solomon was an eminent type.

Here it is &s;aid, "He &s;hall come down like rain upon the mown gra&s;s; as &s;howers that water the earth.

And by his <HI>judging the earth,</HI> is meant his reigning and &s;ubduing the inhabitants of the earth, to a cordial &s;ubjection to him&s;elf; which will be more evident by what follows, where we &s;hall find the &s;ame thing pre|dicted.</P>
<P>The ninety &s;ixth P&s;alm, relates wholly to redemption by Chri&s;t; to the happine&s;s and glory of his kingdom, and his reign on earth.

What is here foretold, is to take place before the end of the world, and the general judgment; and it relates to the whole world, all the earth and the nations in it; the kingdom and reign of Chri&s;t is to extend to all of them: And his coming to judge the earth, and the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s, intends his reigning in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and bringing all nations to &s;hare in the ble&s;&s;ings of his &s;alvation and kingdom. Agreeable to this, it is &s;aid by Chri&s;t, by I&s;aiah and Jeremiah, "Behold a king &s;hall reign <HI>in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> In tho&s;e days, and at that time, will I cau&s;e the branch of righteou&s;|ne&s;s to grow up unto David, and he &s;hall execute <HI>judgment and righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> in the land," or in the earth.

<P>Great part of the prophecy of I&s;aiah, relates to the flouri&s;hing and happy &s;tate of the kingdom of Chri&s;t, and the pro&s;perity of the church in the latter days. When he foretells the return of the people of I&s;rael from the Babyloni&s;h captivity, which was a type of the deliverance of the church of Chri&s;t from &s;piritual Ba|bylon, and from all her enemies in this world, vi&s;ible and invi&s;i|ble, he commonly looks forward to the latter, and keeps that in view, and &s;ays things of it, which are not true of the former, and cannot be applied to it. And as Zion, Jeru&s;alem, and Judah, and
<PB N="16" REF="025635_0015_0FCEAC1F04C150D0">I&s;rael, were types of the church and kingdom of Chri&s;t, as includ|ing all nations, the former are commonly mentioned only as types, being put for, and &s;ygnifying the latter. And when the go&s;pel day, the coming of Chri&s;t, and his church and kingdom, are brought into view, all that is included in the&s;e is comprehended; and commonly chief reference is had to the Millennium, or the day of the flouri&s;hing of the kingdom of Chri&s;t on earth, which is in a peculiar manner, and eminently the day of &s;alvation; and will i&s;&s;ue in the complete redemption of the church, at and after the day of judgment. He who reads this prophecy with care and di&s;cerning, will be convinced of the truth of the&s;e ob&s;ervations; and in any other view, great part of it cannot be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>Only part of the many prophecies of the glory and extent of the kingdom of Chri&s;t in this world, which are contained in this book, will be now mentioned, as tho&s;e which are mo&s;t expre&s;s and clear, with reference to the &s;ubject in view.

<P>This is evidently a prophecy of Chri&s;t, and his kingdom on earth. He &s;hall judge and reprove for the meek of the earth, and &s;lay all the wicked on earth, that the meek may inherit it; which is exactly agreeable to the forementioned prophecy in the thirty &s;eventh P&s;alm. "Evil doers &s;hall be cut off, and yet a little while and the wicked &s;hall not be; but the meek &s;hall inh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">arth; and delight them&s;elves in the abundance of peace." And this univer&s;al peace and harmony among men, which &s;hall take place at that time, is expre&s;&s;ed in the prophecy before us, in very &s;trong, figurative language; by the wolf dwelling with the lamb, &amp;c.&mdash; And the ground and rea&s;on of this is given. "For the earth &s;hall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the &s;ea." By the knowledge of the Lord is meant true religion, or real chri&s;tianity, which con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;t effentially in benevolence and goodne&s;s, as has been &s;hown. So far as this takes place, love, peace, and the mo&s;t happy concord and union, are promoted; and every thing contrary to this &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and bani&s;hed. Therefore, when this &s;hall take place univer&s;ally among men, and fill the earth, as the waters cover the &s;ea, there will be nothing to de&s;troy or hurt, but univer&s;al &s;afety, peace and love. No &s;uch time has ever been yet known. The true knowledge of God has been &s;o far from filling the earth; that gro&s;s darkne&s;s has covered much the greate&s;t part of it; and real chri&s;tianity has been confined to narrow bounds; and but very few of mankind have attained to the char|acter of true chri&s;tians, even where the go&s;pel has been publi&s;hed. And a horrible &s;cene of oppre&s;&s;ion, cruelty, war and murder, has
<PB N="18" REF="025635_0017_0FCEAC2477516850">&s;pread all over the earth; and will continue to do &s;o, until Chri&s;t &s;hall ari&s;e and &s;mite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and &s;lay the wicked with the breath of his lips; and cau&s;e the earth to be filled with the knowledge of God. Such a happy time is yet future, and will certainly come.</P>
<P>The twenty fifth chapter contains a prophecy of the &s;ame event, &s;ome of which is worthy to be tran&s;cribed.

<P>This &s;ubject is &s;et in a very clear light in the book of Daniel the Prophet. It is there repeatedly declared that the church, or king|dom of Chri&s;t, &s;hall be the la&s;t kingdom on earth; that it &s;hall &s;ucceed four preceding monarchies, become great, and fill the world, and exi&s;t in a very happy and glorious &s;tate on earth. By the dream of Nebuchadnezzar, and the interpretation of it in the &s;econd chapter of Daniel, the kingdom of Chri&s;t is &s;et in this light. The image which Nebuchadnezzar &s;aw, repre&s;ents four kingdoms or monarchies, viz. 1. The Babylonian. 2. The Medo Per&s;ian, or that of the Medes and Per&s;ians. 3. The Macedonian or Grecian. 4. The Roman. The&s;e are all to pa&s;s away and be de&s;troyed, to make way for a fifth kingdom, which &s;hall be great, and fill the world; which is de&s;cribed in the dream, by the fol|lowing words: "Thou &s;awe&s;t till a &s;tone was cut out without hands, which &s;mote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and break them in pieces. Then were the iron, the clay,
<PB N="22" REF="025635_0021_0FCEAC2B2A9CAD18">the bra&s;s, the &s;ilver and gold, broken to pieces together, and be|came like the chaff of the &s;ummer thre&s;hing floors, and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: And the &s;tone that &s;mote the image became a great mountain, and <HI>filled the whole earth.</HI> This is interpreted by Daniel in the following words: "And in the days of the&s;e kings &s;hall the God of heaven &s;et up a kingdom, which &s;hall never be de&s;troyed: And the kingdom &s;hall not be left to other people, but it &s;hall break in pieces, and con|&s;ume all the&s;e kingdoms, and it &s;hall &s;tand forever. For as much as thou &s;awe&s;t that the &s;tone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bra&s;s, the clay, the &s;ilver and gold, the great God hath made known to the king what &s;hall come to pa&s;s hereafter." That this la&s;t kingdom is the kingdom of Chri&s;t, there can be no doubt.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Newton on the Prophecies, vol. I. p. 426, 427, &amp;c.</NOTE> The &s;ame is called in the New Te&s;tament, "The kingdom of God, or the kingdom of heaven." This is to &s;ucceed the kingdom of the Romans, and to fill the whole earth, in which all nations, all mankind will be included. The Roman empire or kingdom, is not yet wholly de&s;troyed; therefore what is here predicted of the kingdom of Chri&s;t is not yet accompli&s;hed, but &s;hall take place in &s;ome future day. Nothing can be plainer and more certain than this.</P>
<P>In the &s;eventh chapter of this book there is a repre&s;entation of the &s;ame thing in a vi&s;ion which Daniel had. He &s;aw the &s;ame four empires or kingdoms in their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, repre&s;ented by four great, wild, fierce bea&s;ts, coming up from the &s;ea. The la&s;t king|dom turned into a little horn which came up la&s;t; and Daniel "beheld till this fourth bea&s;t with the little horn was &s;lain, and his body de&s;troyed, and given to the burning flame." And then the vi&s;ion proceeds, "I &s;aw in the night vi&s;ions, and beheld, one like the Son of man, come with the clouds of heaven, and came to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages &s;hould &s;erve him: His domin|ion is an everla&s;ting dominion, which &s;hall not pa&s;s away, and his kingdom that which &s;hall not be de&s;troyed." This vi&s;ion is briefly explained to Daniel in the following words: "The&s;e great bea&s;ts, which are four, are four kings (i. e. kingdoms) which &s;hall ari&s;e out of the earth. But the &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High &s;hall take the kingdom, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the kingdom forever, even for|ever
<PB N="23" REF="025635_0022_0FCEAC2C81EFE538">and ever." Daniel reque&s;ted a more particular explanation of the fourth bea&s;t, and of the ten horns, and of the little horn, "Even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that &s;pake very great things, who&s;e look was more &s;tout than his fellows. And the &s;ame horn made war with the &s;aints and prevailed again&s;t them; until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High; and the time came that the &s;aints po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the kingdom." And he is then told, "That the fourth bea&s;t &s;hall be the fourth kingdom upon earth. And the ten horns out of this kingdom, are ten kings that &s;hall ari&s;e: And another &s;hall ri&s;e after them, and he &s;hall be diver&s;e from the fir&s;t, and he &s;hall &s;ubdue three kings. And he &s;hall &s;peak great words again&s;t the Mo&s;t High, and &s;hall wear out the &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High, and think to change times and laws: And they &s;hall be given in|to his hand, until a time, and times, and the dividing of time. But the judgment &s;hall &s;it, and they &s;hall take away his dominion, to con&s;ume and to de&s;troy it to the end. <HI>And the kingdom and domin|ion, and the greatne&s;s of the kingdom under the whole heaven, &s;hall be given to the people of the &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High,</HI> who&s;e kingdom is an everla&s;ting kingdom, and all dominions &s;hall &s;erve and obey him."</P>
<P>As in Nebuchadnezzar's dream, &s;o in this vi&s;ion, the fifth and la&s;t kingdom, is the kingdom of Chri&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting wholly of &s;aints. It is Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom Daniel &s;aw, "And behold, one like to the Son of man, came with the clouds of heaven. And there was given him dominion and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations and languages &s;hould &s;erve him." His kingdom and do|minion is univer&s;al, including all the inhabitants of the earth. And the&s;e &s;hall be all &s;aints or holy per&s;ons; as no others can be the proper &s;ubjects of this kingdom. "The &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High &s;hall take the kingdom, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the kingdom forever. And the kingdom, and dominion, and the greatne&s;s of the king|dom under the whole heaven, &s;hall be given to the people of the &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High." The &s;tronge&s;t expre&s;&s;ions are u&s;ed and repeated, to a&s;&s;ert the univer&s;ality of this kingdom, comprehend|ing all mankind who &s;hall then live on earth. And it is repeat|edly declared, that this kingdom &s;hall &s;tand forever. It &s;hall not be de&s;troyed by any &s;ucceeding power or kingdom, as the former kingdoms were, but &s;hall continue to the end of the world, and then be removed to heaven, to a more perfect and glorious &s;tate; and there exi&s;t and flouri&s;h in the highe&s;t perfection forever and ever.</P>

The little horn which was on the bea&s;t, and de&s;troyed with the bea&s;t, who&s;e body was given to the burning flame, is the Pope of Rome, with the kingdom and power, civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, of which he is the head.

<P>THE prophecies in the New Te&s;tament, foretold the univer&s;al &s;pread of chri&s;tianity, until all nations &s;hall become the &s;ervants of Chri&s;t; and that Chri&s;t and his people &s;hall reign on earth a thou&s;and years; when &s;atan &s;hall be ca&s;t out of the earth, and his &s;ubjects and kingdom &s;hall be de&s;troyed; agreeable to the nu|merous prophecies in the Old Te&s;tament, which have been mentioned.</P>
<P>Je&s;us Chri&s;t has foretold this, by the following parables.&mdash; "Another parable put he forth unto them, &s;aying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mu&s;tard &s;eed, which a man took and &s;owed in his field. Which indeed is the lea&s;t of all &s;eeds: But when it is grown, it is the greate&s;t among herbs, and becometh a tree; &s;o that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. Another parable &s;pake he unto them, The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three mea&s;ures of meal, till the whole was leavened."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xiii. 31, 32, 33.</NOTE> By the fir&s;t of tho&s;e parables Chri&s;t teaches, that his church and kingdom, though &s;mall in the beginning of it, &s;hould increa&s;e and become great in the world. In the next, he makes an advance, and more fully predicts the univer&s;al extent of this kingdom; that the go&s;pel &s;hall not cea&s;e to &s;pread and influence the world, till all mankind, living on earth, the whole world, &s;hall be formed by it, and imbibe
<PB N="26" REF="025635_0025_0FCEAC3284048C98">the &s;pirit of it; &s;o as to become the children of this kingdom. If the kingdom of heaven &s;hall not finally prevail and extend to all nations, and fill the whole world, how can this parable be a ju&s;t or true repre&s;entation of it? In this view of it, it agrees exactly with many of the prophecies which have been mentioned; and with others, which are yet to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>Agreeable to this, are the following words of Chri&s;t, in which indeed he a&s;&s;erts the &s;ame thing, "Now is the judgment of this world: Now &s;hall the prince of this world be ca&s;t out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joh: xii. 31, 32.</NOTE>&mdash; What is here foretold by Chri&s;t, is not yet accompli&s;hed, except in a very &s;mall part, as the fir&s;t fruits and pledge of the whole.&mdash; A foundation for this was laid in the death of Chri&s;t, when he was lifted up on the cro&s;s; but the prince of this world, the devil, is not yet ca&s;t out of the world; nor has Chri&s;t yet drawn all men unto him. Chri&s;t has drawn great numbers to him, who have become his faithful &s;ubjects and &s;ervants, and has made great in|roads upon the intere&s;t and kingdom of the prince of this world; but very few of mankind, compared with the whole, have been drawn to Chri&s;t; by far the greate&s;t number even in the chri&s;|tian world, have rejected and oppo&s;ed him; and the kingdom of &s;atan has been great and &s;trong, including the mo&s;t of men who have lived in the world, from the time in which the&s;e words were &s;poken by Chri&s;t, to this day. Both of the&s;e events are therefore yet future, and the former is to make way for the latter; or rather one is included in the other. The &s;ame things which are here foretold, are predicted in different words, in the twentieth chapter of the Revelation, which will be con&s;idered. When Chri&s;t &s;ays, He will draw <HI>all men</HI> unto him, he does not mean that every one of mankind &s;hall come unto him; for this is contrary to known fact; and to many expre&s;s declarations of Chri&s;t.

<P>This was &s;uited to &s;upport and comfort his di&s;ciples and friends at that time, when he had been &s;peaking of his own death as at hand, in the view of the glory that &s;hould follow his dying on the cro&s;s: and &s;erved to explain what was &s;poken by the voice from

<P>What the Apo&s;tle Paul &s;ays in the eleventh chapter of his epi&s;tle to the Romans, of the Jews and Gentiles, which compre|hend all mankind, holds forth this &s;ame truth. He there &s;peaks of the Jews who were then, the mo&s;t of them, broken off from the church by unbelief, as yet to come into the kingdom of Chri&s;t, even all of them, which he terms their <HI>fulne&s;s.</HI> And he &s;ays, that when they &s;hall in their fulne&s;s be brought in, the fulne&s;s of the Gen|tiles &s;hall come in al&s;o. The fulne&s;s of the Jews, and the fulne&s;s of the Gentiles, mu&s;t include the whole of all nations. And he &s;peaks of what had taken place in the days of the Apo&s;tles, in the conver&s;ion of Jews and Gentiles, as only the fir&s;t fruits, the root, foundation and beginning, of the whole lump, and the tree which were to follow in the coming in of the Jews and Gentiles, of the whole world, in the fulne&s;s thereof.

<P>This leads to recollect the many prophecies by the ancient Prophets, of the re&s;toration of the Jews to a &s;tate of holine&s;s and happine&s;s, in the la&s;t days, which has not yet come to pa&s;s, &s;ome of which it may be proper to mention here, as they &s;erve to con|firm the point under con&s;ideration. The thirty fourth, thirty &s;ixth, and thirty &s;eventh chapters of Ezekiel, relate chiefly to this event. Though the return of the Jews from their captivity in Babylon, may be implied in this prophecy, and &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions may have particular reference to that; yet it evidently looks far|ther, to a deliverance and &s;alvation, of which their return from Babylon was a type or pledge: And there are many things pre|dicted, which cannot be applied to the former, and were not true of it. Particularly the following: "I will &s;et up one &s;hepherd over them, and he &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eed them, even my &s;ervant David: And he &s;hall feed them, and he &s;hall be their &s;hepherd.

<P>The &s;ame is foretold by the Prophet Ho&s;ea. "The children of I&s;rael &s;hall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a &s;acrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim. Afterward &s;hall the children of I&s;rael return, and &s;eek the Lord their God, and David their king, and &s;hall fear the Lord, and his goodne&s;s in the latter days."

<P>The&s;e prophecies, and others of the &s;ame kind, if they be con|&s;idered as having reference to the Jews exclu&s;ively, and not includ|ing the whole church of Chri&s;t, in the latter day, compo&s;ed of Jews and Gentiles, do prove that there is yet to be a time, when the church of Chri&s;t &s;hall be univer&s;al, and include all nations: For it appears from what St. Paul &s;ays, that when tho&s;e prophe|cies &s;hall be fulfilled to the Jews, the fulne&s;s of the Gentiles will al&s;o come in, and all men in every nation will be &s;ubject to Chri&s;t, and his kingdom &s;hall be glorious, and fill the world.

Here the afflictions and per|&s;ecutions, through which the church &s;hould pa&s;s; the re&s;pite which &s;he &s;hould have, and victory over the per&s;ecuting power of hea|then Rome, in the days of Con&s;tantine; the grand apo&s;tacy which &s;hould take place in the church by the ri&s;e of the Pope, and the hierarchy of the fal&s;e church of Rome; the gro&s;s idolatry which &s;hould be practi&s;ed in that church; and the violent oppo&s;ition of this power to the true followers of Chri&s;t; their cruel per&s;ecutions of them, and &s;hedding their blood, for a thou&s;and two hundred and &s;ixty years; the judgments that &s;hould be executed on that corrupt church and her adherents, and on the whole world, for their ob&s;tinacy in wickedne&s;s; and the final overthrow of the Pope and all who &s;upport him, and of the kingdom of &s;atan in the world, and the deliverance of the church of Chri&s;t into a &s;tate of re&s;t and peace, when this kingdom of Chri&s;t &s;hall increa&s;e and &s;pread, and fill the world; and continue in this happy &s;tate on earth a thou&s;and years: All this is foretold; much of which is already come to pa&s;s; but the mo&s;t happy and glorious events are yet to come. The great and remarkable things which have come to pa&s;s, as they were foretold, are a &s;tanding, inconte&s;tible evidence and demon&s;tration, that the prophecies in this book are from heaven: For it is as certain, that none but the omni&s;cient God can know and predict &s;uch events, which take place accord|ing to the prediction, as it is that this world was made by him. And the events which are come to pa&s;s, and are now taking place in the world before our eyes, agreeable to the prophecies in this book, at the &s;ame time that they prove that tho&s;e predictions are from God, are al&s;o a pledge and a&s;&s;urance, that the prophecies of things not yet come, will be fulfilled in due &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject now in hand, will lead more particularly to con|&s;ider what are the prophecies in this book, which relate to the future pro&s;perity of the church and kingdom of Chri&s;t in this world, in which all the darkne&s;s and afflictions which do attend it, being oppre&s;&s;ed and trodden down by enemies, while they prevail

<P>In the fifth chapter of the Revelation, the four and twenty elders, who repre&s;ent the church, appear rejoicing and prai&s;ing Chri&s;t in the pro&s;pect of their reigning on the earth. "And they &s;ung a new &s;ong, &s;aying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the &s;eals thereof: For thou wa&s;t &s;lain, and ha&s;t redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and ha&s;t made us unto our God kings and prie&s;ts: <HI>And we &s;hall reign on the earth.</HI>" This is &s;poken of <HI>the church,</HI> and is not literally true of every particular member of it, that then actually exi&s;ted in heaven, or on earth. When the church &s;hall reign on earth, con&s;i&s;ting of the numerous members who &s;hall then exi&s;t in this world; all tho&s;e who are gone out of the world, and are in heaven, will reign in and with the church on earth, as members of the &s;ame &s;ociety and kingdom; and will partake in all the joy and glory of this event, in a much higher de|gree than if they were per&s;onally on earth. They will reign in their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, who repre&s;ent them, and in the prevalence, victory and triumph of that cau&s;e, which is theirs, and in which they lived and died. But this will be more particularly con&s;idered hereafter.</P>
<P>"And the &s;eventh angel &s;ounded, and there were great voices in heaven, &s;aying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Chri&s;t, and he &s;hall reign forever and ever."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. x. 15.</NOTE> Here it is a&s;&s;erted, that under the &s;eventh trumpet, which contains all the events from the time of its &s;ounding, to the end of the world, all the nations and kingdoms in this world &s;hall become one kingdom, under Chri&s;t, and &s;hall be wholly &s;wallowed up in this kingdom, which &s;hall not be &s;ucceeded or give place to any other kingdom; but &s;hall &s;tand forever. It &s;hall continue the only kingdom on earth to the end of the world, and exi&s;t forever in heaven. Which is perfectly agreeable to many other prophecies which have been mentioned. The mean|ing is not, that this event &s;hall follow immediately upon the &s;ound|ing of the &s;eventh trumpet; but that this is comprehended in the events of this trumpet, to which all the preceding have re&s;pect, and in which they &s;hall i&s;&s;ue, as the mo&s;t important and glorious
<PB N="31" REF="025635_0030_0FCEAC3AE5D6D038">event, to which all the inhabitants of heaven were attending, and in the pro&s;pect of which they had peculiar joy.</P>
<P>The &s;ame event is celebrated in heaven, as having actually taken place, in the former part of the nineteenth chapter. "And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, &s;aying, Hallelujah! for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth: Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made her&s;elf ready. And to her was granted, that &s;he &s;hould be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: For the fine linen is the righteou&s;ne&s;s of &s;aints. And he &s;aid unto me, Write, Ble&s;&s;ed are they who are called unto the marriage &s;upper of the Lamb. And he &s;aith unto me, The&s;e are the true &s;ayings of God." Here the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is repre|&s;ented as reigning, as he never had done before; which is the &s;ame event which is &s;o often predicted in the P&s;alms, and by the Prophets, e&s;pecially by Daniel, by the Lord's reigning, that is Chri&s;t. And which is mentioned and celebrated in the tenth chapter; and in the twentieth chapter; "And I &s;aw thrones, and they &s;at upon them, and judgment was given unto them, and they lived and reigned with Chri&s;t a thou&s;and years." By the bride having made her&s;elf ready, and being arrayed in fine linen, clean and white, is meant the eminent degree of holine&s;s and moral beauty, to which the church will arrive at that day, in the Millennium &s;tate. This is repre&s;ented as taking place upon the fall of antichri&s;t, and the great whore, the fal&s;e idolatrous church of Rome. And it &s;ucceeds the overthrow of &s;atan's kingdom in the world, and not only the de&s;truction of the Roman empire un|der antichri&s;t, but of all the nations of wicked men; which is de|&s;cribed in the &s;ixteenth chapter, ver&s;e &s;eventeenth, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And the &s;ame event is again repre&s;ented in the latter part of the nineteenth chapter, and in the beginning of the twentieth. "And I &s;aw heaven opened, and behold, a white hor&s;e: And he that &s;at upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteou&s;ne&s;s he doth judge and make war." From the following de&s;cription it appears, that this per&s;on is Je&s;us Chri&s;t prepared, and going forth to de|&s;troy his enemies on earth. And an angel is &s;een &s;tanding in the &s;un, in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous place, calling with a loud voice upon all the fowls of the air to come "to the &s;upper of the great God,"
<PB N="32" REF="025635_0031_0FCEAC3D6EC0DF40">to eat the fle&s;h of kings and captains, &amp;c. and the fle&s;h of <HI>all men,</HI> both free and bond, both &s;mall and great. And he &s;aw the bea&s;t and the kings of the earth, and their armies <HI>gathered together,</HI> to make war again&s;t him that &s;at on the hor&s;e, and again&s;t his army." And the bea&s;t and fal&s;e prophet were de&s;troyed by him; and the remnant of tho&s;e who joined with the bea&s;t and were enemies to Chri&s;t, were &s;lain by him. This battle, and the de&s;truction of the enemies of Chri&s;t, does not follow in time, and is not to take place after the events mentioned in the fir&s;t part of this chapter, viz. the joy and prai&s;e in heaven, upon the reigning of Chri&s;t on earth, and the bride, the Lamb's wife, making her&s;elf ready, &amp;c. but is a repeated and more particular repre&s;entation of what is to precede that happy event, which had been before mentioned in the &s;ixteenth chapter, from the thirteenth ver&s;e to the end of it. There the kings of the earth, and the whole world, are &s;aid to be <HI>gath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">red together to battle;</HI> "The battle of the great day of God Almighty." So here "The bea&s;t and the kings of the earth, and their armies, are <HI>gathered together to make war</HI> again&s;t him that &s;at on the hor&s;e." And there the battle is de&s;cribed as coming on, upon the pouring out of the &s;eventh vial, and great Babylon, which is the &s;ame with the bea&s;t, and the fal&s;e prophet, and all the enemies of Chri&s;t, are de&s;troyed in battle. Which is exactly paral|lel with the war and battle of which there is a more particular de|&s;cription in the nineteenth chapter, and mu&s;t be one and the &s;ame event. This is confirmed, by what immediately follows this de|&s;truction of the enemies of Chri&s;t, in the beginning of the twentieth chapter, which, as has been ob&s;erved, is the &s;ame event with that de&s;cribed in the nineteenth chapter by the marriage of the Lamb, who&s;e bride, that is the church, was made ready, and arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. A more particular and remarkable de&s;cription of this &s;ame thing, in the twentieth chapter, is in the following words.</P>
<P>"And I &s;aw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomle&s;s pit, and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old &s;erpent, which is the devil and &s;atan, and bound him a thou&s;and years, and ca&s;t him into the bottomle&s;s pit, and &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t him up, and &s;et a &s;eal upon him, that he &s;hould de|ceive the nations no more, till the thou&s;and years &s;hould be fulfill|ed: And after that, he mu&s;t be loo&s;ed a little &s;ea&s;on. And I &s;aw thrones, and they &s;at upon them, and judgment was given unto
<PB N="33" REF="025635_0032_0FCEAC3E8756E800">them. And I &s;aw the &s;ouls of them that were beheaded for the witne&s;s of Je&s;us, and for the word of God, and which had not wor&s;hipped the bea&s;t, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands: And they lived and reigned with Chri&s;t a thou&s;and years. But the re&s;t of the dead lived not again until the thou&s;and years were fini&s;hed. This is the fir&s;t re&s;urrection. Ble&s;&s;ed and holy is he that hath part in the fir&s;t re&s;urrection. On &s;uch the &s;econd death hath no power; but they &s;hall be prie&s;ts of God, and of Chri&s;t, and &s;hall reign with him a thou&s;and years."</P>
<P>A particular explanation of this pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture will be at|tempted in the next &s;ection. That it does expre&s;s and confirm the truth which is contained in the numerous prophecies which have been mentioned, and which is &s;et up to be proved in this &s;ection, the following ob&s;ervations will &s;how.</P>
<P N="1">1. This event here predicted, is to take place after the overthrow of the Roman antichri&s;tian kingdom, and the de&s;truction of all the enemies of Chri&s;t and his church on earth. This is evident from the account of the de&s;truction of the&s;e in the prophecy im|mediately preceding the&s;e words, and upon which the glorious &s;cene opened in this pa&s;&s;age, is to take place. And the &s;ame is predicted in the la&s;t part of the &s;ixteenth chapter, as has been &s;hown. This is agreeable to the prophecies of the &s;ame event, in the P&s;alms, and by Daniel, and others, viz. that the time of the reign of Chri&s;t, and of the &s;aints on earth, &s;hall &s;ucceed the de&s;truc|tion of the wicked, and the total overthrow of all the preceding kingdoms and powers in the world, which has been from time to time ob&s;erved upon them, when they were tran&s;cribed. And in this very pa&s;&s;age, &s;atan him&s;elf is repre&s;ented as bound, and ca&s;t out of the earth, and &s;hut up in the bottomle&s;s pit, antecedent to the reign of Chri&s;t, and his followers, in the world; which nece&s;&s;arily implies the total ruin of his cau&s;e and kingdom on earth, and the extirpation of all the wicked, who are his children and &s;ervants. Therefore, the time here predicted, is not yet come.</P>
<P N="2">2. All this is to take place before the end of the world, and the day of judgment. This is very evident and certain, &s;ince it is &s;aid, that when this happy time of a thou&s;and years is ended, &s;atan &s;hall be loo&s;ed out of his pri&s;on, and &s;hall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth: And then, after this, Chri&s;t is repre&s;ented as coming to judgment, of which
<PB N="34" REF="025635_0033_0FCEAC402C479A10">there is a particular account; and of the final and eternal de&s;truc|tion of all his enemies.</P>
<P N="3">3. Chri&s;t is here &s;aid to reign, and his &s;aints to reign with him, which, without any doubt, is the &s;ame event, and the &s;ame period, which is foretold by Daniel and other Prophets, as a mo&s;t happy and joyful time, when that nation and tho&s;e men who will not &s;erve Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;hall be de&s;troyed; and there &s;hall be given to him dominion and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages &s;hould &s;erve him. And the kingdom and domin|ion, and the greatne&s;s of the kingdom under the whole heaven, &s;hall be given to the &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High, and all dominions &s;hall &s;erve him. And the extent and univer&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lity of the kingdom of Chri&s;t, and of tho&s;e who reign with him, as including all na|tions and all men, is &s;uppo&s;ed and implied in his binding &s;atan and ca&s;ting him out, "that he &s;hould <HI>deceive the nations no more,</HI> till the thou&s;and years &s;hould be fulfilled." Satan is &s;aid to de|ceive the whole world.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. xii. 9.</NOTE> And when he is ca&s;t out of the whole world, Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his people will take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and reign in all the earth.</P>
<P N="4">4. Chri&s;t and his people are to reign on earth A THOUSAND YEARS.
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hence this time is called the MILLENNIUM, which &s;ignifies a thou&s;and years.</NOTE> All have not been agreed in the length of time denoted here by a thou&s;and years. Some have &s;uppo&s;ed that a thou&s;and years, is u&s;ed indefinitely, not to expre&s;s any preci&s;e number of years, but a great number of years, or a long time. But this can|not rea&s;onably be admitted as the &s;en&s;e of the expre&s;&s;ion here, &s;ince this preci&s;e number of years, is mentioned &s;ix times in this pa&s;&s;age, which appears incon&s;i&s;tent with its being u&s;ed in &s;uch an indefinite, vague &s;en&s;e. And be&s;ides, there is nothing in the connection here, or in the nature or circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, to lead any one to under&s;tand this number, as put indefinitely.</P>
<P>There are others who &s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e are to be under&s;tood to be a thou&s;and prophetical years, that is, as many years as there are days in a thou&s;and literal years, a day being put for a year.&mdash; According to this way of reckoning, a thou&s;and years are put for three hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and years; for in that age, a year was reckoned to con&s;i&s;t of three hundred and &s;ixty days. It is &s;aid, that in this book of Revelation, a day is con&s;tantly put for a year. A thou&s;and, two hundred and &s;ixty days, mean &s;o many
<PB N="35" REF="025635_0034_0FCEAC4257BD1660">years, and forty two months, mean as many years, as there are days in &s;o many months, reckoning thirty days to each month, as they then did; which therefore amount to the &s;ame number of years, i. e. one thou&s;and, two hundred and &s;ixty years. And a time and times, and half a time, i. e. three years and an half, mean as many years as there are days in three years and an half; which are ju&s;t as many as there are in forty two months; that is, one thou&s;and, two hundred and &s;ixty years. It is therefore con|cluded, that the&s;e thou&s;and years, mu&s;t be under&s;tood in the &s;ame way; that is, that a day is put for a year; which will amount to three hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and years.</P>
<P>It is acknowledged that this &s;uppo&s;ition is &s;upported by &s;ome colour of argument, and plau&s;ibility: But there are objections to it, &s;ome of which will be mentioned.</P>
<P N="1">1. It does by no means follow that the&s;e are prophetical years, in the &s;en&s;e mentioned, becau&s;e a day is put for a year, in other places in this prophecy. There may be rea&s;ons for putting a day for a year, in other in&s;tances; and yet there be no rea&s;on for put|ting a thou&s;and years for as many years as there are days in a thou&s;and years, in this in&s;tance; and therefore no rea&s;on for un|der&s;tanding them &s;o. And a day is not put for a year in every other in&s;tance in this book. The dead bodies of the two witne&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are &s;aid to lie in the &s;treet of the city, three days and an half,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. xi. 11.</NOTE> which do not mean three years and an half, as no event re&s;pecting them can be made con&s;i&s;tent with &s;uch a meaning.</P>
<P N="2">2. The number, <HI>a thou&s;and years,</HI> being repeated &s;o many times in one &s;hort paragraph, &s;eems to be a rea&s;on that it is to be under|&s;tood literally, for ju&s;t &s;o many years, and not &s;o many prophetical years. E&s;pecially, as there is nothing in this ca&s;e to lead us to under&s;tand it in the latter &s;en&s;e; but it may, as con&s;i&s;tently with every thing in this book, and this prophecy in particular, and more &s;o, as will be now ob&s;erved, be under&s;tood literally. And it is farther to be ob&s;erved, that there is no in&s;tance in this book, or in the whole Bible, where a preci&s;e number is &s;o often repeated in the &s;ame words, that is not to be under&s;tood literally.</P>
<P N="3">3. It &s;eems to be out of all proper proportion, to &s;uppo&s;e there will be &s;o long a time as three hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and years of pro&s;perity and happine&s;s, and of great and univer&s;al holine&s;s in this world, the habitation of an apo&s;tate, &s;inful race of men; and
<PB N="36" REF="025635_0035_0FCEAC43BAAD8BA0">but &s;ix thou&s;and years of evil times. And this does not appear con&s;i&s;tent with this world being repre&s;ented as an <HI>evil world,</HI> as it is in the &s;cripture: Or with its being cur&s;ed in con&s;equence of man's rebellion. One thou&s;and years may be an exception out of &s;even thou&s;and, in which the cur&s;e may be mitigated, and in a great mea&s;ure removed; and yet, on the whole, or the whole taken together, it may be con&s;idered and called, an evil and accur&s;ed world, for man's &s;ake. But if there were to be only &s;ix thou&s;and years of evil and the cur&s;e, and three hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and years of good and a ble&s;&s;ing, it would not, on the whole, be an evil or cur&s;ed, but a happy and ble&s;&s;ed world.</P>
<P N="4">4. It has been ob&s;erved, that the natural world is evidently a de&s;igned type or &s;hadow of the moral world, e&s;pecially of the re|demption by Chri&s;t. And that creating it in &s;ix days, and then re&s;ting on the &s;eventh, is de&s;igned to be a type of bringing the moral world in the work of redemption, to a &s;tate of re&s;t; that there are to be &s;ix thou&s;and years in which every thing with re|&s;pect to redemption and the kingdom of Chri&s;t, is to be done and prepared, for a &s;eventh thou&s;and years of peace and re&s;t, and joy in this glorious work. And it will be &s;hown in the &s;equel, that there are in&s;titutions in the Mo&s;aic ritual, which point out the &s;ame thing. The Apo&s;tle Peter &s;eems to allude to this, when &s;peaking of the coming of Chri&s;t, and the end of the world. "But beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thou&s;and years, and a thou&s;and years as one day. The Lord is not &s;lack concerning his promi&s;e; but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night," &amp;c.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Peter iii. 8, 9, 10.</NOTE> Hence the con&s;tant revolu|tion of weeks, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;even days, is an emblem of the revo|lution of time, which will come to an end, when the world has exi&s;ted &s;even thou&s;and years. And there has been a tradition among both Jews and Chri&s;tians, agreeable to this &s;entiment.

<P N="5">5. All the ends of &s;uch a day of peace and pro&s;perity, of victory, triumph and &s;alvation to the church on earth, and of the &s;o much celebrated reign of Chri&s;t with his &s;aints, in this world, will be fully an&s;wered in a literal thou&s;and years, &s;o far as it can be learned what they are, from &s;cripture; or man can conceive them to be; as much and as fully an&s;wered, as they could be in hundreds of thou|&s;ands of years, or in any &s;uppo&s;ed length of time.</P>
<P>Satan will be as much defeated, and his kingdom and intere&s;t wholly de&s;troyed in the world; the cau&s;e of wickedne&s;s, and evil men, will be entirely ruined and lo&s;t, and they all bani&s;hed from the earth. The wi&s;dom, power, grace, truth and faithfulne&s;s of Chri&s;t will have a proper and glorious manife&s;tation, by intro|ducing &s;uch a &s;tate, and continuing it as long as is mo&s;t for his glory, and the be&s;t good of his church, though it &s;hall continue but a thou&s;and years. The church may have all the reward and enjoyment in that time, that it is proper or de&s;irable that it &s;hould have on earth; and it may be wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t, then to take it to a more perfect, happy and glorious &s;tate in heaven. A thou&s;and years will be time enough for Chri&s;t to &s;how what he can do, in bringing good out of evil, and vindicating his cau&s;e and church, and triumphing gloriou&s;ly over all oppo&s;ition from earth and hell, and filling the world with his powerful pre&s;ence and kingdom, with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord; with holine&s;s and happine&s;s. There will be full opportunity in this time, to &s;how and demon&s;trate, from fact and abundant experience, what is the nature, beauty and excellence of chri&s;tianity; that it is exactly &s;uited to form the world into a &s;tate of love, union and happine&s;s; and that all the preceding evils among mankind have been chiefly owing to ignorance or neglect of Chri&s;t, and the true &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity, and oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e in life or heart, or both. And this will be time enough to &s;how, that all means are ineffectual to

<P>And in this thou&s;and years the work of redemption, and &s;alva|tion, may be fully accompli&s;hed, in the utmo&s;t extent and glory of it.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Beliamy's Sermon on the Millennium.</NOTE></P>
<P>The only end that can be imagined would be an&s;wered by pro|tracting this time of the pro&s;perity of the church in this world, is, that greater numbers of mankind might exi&s;t, and be &s;aved. But that this is really de&s;irable or be&s;t, all things con&s;idered, there is not the lea&s;t evidence. A de&s;ire that more of mankind &s;hould be &s;aved than will be &s;aved, in a thou&s;and years of the prevalence of holine&s;s and &s;alvation, in all the families of the earth, never could be &s;atisfied: For though three hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and years &s;hould be added, and all &s;hould be &s;aved who lived in that time; &s;till, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that this is de&s;ired, it will be equally de|&s;irable, and more &s;o, that the time of &s;alvation &s;hould be lengthen|ed out yet longer; and &s;o on without end. This rea&s;on for making the time longer, that more may be &s;aved, cannot cea&s;e; and a de&s;ire of more time, on this ground, or for this rea&s;on, is like the four things which Solomon mentions as never &s;atisfied, and &s;ay not it is enough. It is mo&s;t wi&s;e and be&s;t, that a certain number and proportion of mankind &s;hould be &s;aved: And God only knows what this number is, how great, and what proportion it bears to the whole human race. And no man has any rea&s;on to think, that this number will not be compleated within a literal thou&s;and years, after the Millennium commences. Nor can there be the lea&s;t evidence from any quarter, that it will not, unle&s;s there be evidence that the Millennium contains a longer time; which is the que&s;tion under con&s;ideration. And it is &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="39" REF="025635_0038_0FCEAC4906621820">that no evidence of this has yet been produced, or can be at pre|&s;ent: And it is certain, that the &s;alvation of more of mankind, were the time to be longer, is no rea&s;on why it &s;hould be longer. But this will be be&s;t, and mo&s;t infallibly decided by the event which will take place in due &s;ea&s;on: Which perhaps cannot be deter|mined with certainty now, or &s;o that all &s;hall be &s;atisfied and a|greed in the matter. And it may not be wi&s;e to be very confi|dent on either &s;ide of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>THE evidence has now been produced from &s;cripture, that there is a time coming, in which the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t &s;hall prevail in this world; and his kingdom &s;pread and fill the earth, as it has never yet done; in which time, the church and people of Chri&s;t &s;hall come to a &s;tate of peace and pro&s;perity; when the kingdom of &s;atan &s;hall be utterly de&s;troyed; and all wicked men &s;hall be put down, and ca&s;t out of the earth, and there &s;hall be none to de&s;troy, hurt or oppo&s;e the truth and ways of Chri&s;t, or his people: And this happy, glorious day &s;hall la&s;t a thou&s;and years.</P>
<P>This is foretold, not by one &s;ingle prophecy, but is repeatedly and abundantly mentiond in the &s;acred, prophetic writings, and repre&s;ented by a variety of &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions, and by different &s;imilitudes, and in figurative language: And yet all perfectly a|gree to point out the &s;ame thing. And there are many prophe|cies of the &s;ame event, by I&s;aiah, and in other parts of the Bible, which have not been particularly mentioned.</P>
<P>Nothing has yet taken place in favour of the church of Chri&s;t, and in oppo&s;ition to his enemies, which is in any mea&s;ure an&s;wer|able to the&s;e predictions. By far the greater part of mankind have been in a &s;tate of ignorance of chri&s;tianity, or of oppo&s;ition to it, ever &s;ince the go&s;pel has been preached to men; and &s;atan has had a greater and &s;tronger kingdom on earth, than Chri&s;t, mo&s;t of the time &s;ince his a&s;cen&s;ion. And &s;in, and real oppo&s;ition to Chri&s;t, in principle and practice, have abounded in every age, even among nominal chri&s;tians. The overthrow of the Jews by the Romans, and the con&s;equent &s;pread of chri&s;tianity among the Gentiles, were events favourable to the church of Chri&s;t, and were a pledge and type of what he will yet do, in overthrowing his enemies and delivering his church, in the latter days. And &s;o was the overthrow of heathen Rome, and the &s;pread and preva|knce of chri&s;tianity through all the Roman empite, in the days
<PB N="40" REF="025635_0039_0FCEAC4A80478C68">of the Emperor Con&s;tantine, in the fourth century. But this was of &s;hort continuance, and within twenty years the church fell into a &s;tate of great calamity, by divi&s;ions, contentions, and he|re&s;ies; and the empire was involved in confu&s;ion and war. And from that time to this, the church has been in a low, afflicted &s;tate. The many promi&s;es made to I&s;rael by the prophets, of re&s;|toration to a long abiding &s;tate of obedience, holine&s;s and pro&s;peri|ty, have not been in any mea&s;ure fulfilled to that nation, nor to the church, including Jews and Gentiles, repre&s;ented and typified by I&s;rael, Jeru&s;alem, Mount Zion, &amp;c. If &s;uch a day of pro&s;perity of the church of Chri&s;t, comprehending Jews and Gentiles, and all nations, were not yet to come, great part of the prophecies in the Bible could have but a very low and little mean|ing, and would be in a great mea&s;ure, if not wholly, u&s;ele&s;s: Whereas, if they be under&s;tood according to the mo&s;t natural, plain import of them, they open a mo&s;t plea&s;ing, wonderful &s;cene, &s;uited to &s;upport and animate the chri&s;tian, and fill him with gra|titude and joy, on the agreeable pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>It appears rea&s;onable and de&s;irable, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who &s;uf|fered &s;hame and reproach in this world, and was condemned and put to death as a malefactor, by men, &s;hould have this reproach wiped off in the fight of all m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, and that the cau&s;e in which he &s;uffered and died, &s;hould prevail and be victorious in this &s;ame world, where he &s;uffered and died: That he &s;hould, agreeably to ancient prophecies, be here on earth, "Exalted, and extolled, and be very high. As many were a&s;toni&s;hed at him (his vi&s;age was &s;o marred more than any man, and his form more than the &s;ons of men) &s;o &s;hall he &s;prinkle many nations, and kings &s;hall &s;hut their mouths at him: For that which had not been told them &s;hall they &s;ee; and that which they had not heard, &s;hall they con|&s;ider.

<P>One rea&s;on why this day of &s;alvation is delayed &s;o long after the death and re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, doubtle&s;s is, that there may be proper and full opportunity to di&s;cover the depravity and wicked|ne&s;s of man, and the in&s;ufficiency of all means that can be u&s;ed, or methods taken, to bring men to repentance, and a cordial &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to Chri&s;t, unle&s;s accompanied by the &s;pecial, omnipotent influences of the Holy Spirit, to renew their hearts: And clearly to manife&s;t the natural enmity in the hearts of mankind again&s;t Chri&s;t, and the truths of the go&s;pel, and their &s;trong di&s;po&s;ition, and unconquerable by all po&s;&s;ible external means and advantages, to oppo&s;e, and pervert the go&s;pel, and abu&s;e it to the wor&s;t pur|po&s;es; that it may appear in the mo&s;t clear and &s;triking light, how greatly and wholly depraved, and utterly lo&s;t, men are, unle&s;s they be &s;aved by the wa&s;hing of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t; and that the whole prai&s;e and glory of the &s;alvation of every one, may be a&s;cribed to the &s;overeign grace of Chri&s;t, and man be forever aba&s;ed.

<P>THERE have been, and &s;till are, very different opin|ions, re&s;pecting the Millennium, and the events which will take place in that day; which are grounded chiefly on the &s;ix fir&s;t ver&s;es in the twentieth chapter of the Revelation, which pa&s;&s;age has been brought into view, in the preceding &s;ection; but is to be more particicularly con&s;idered in this.</P>

Some have &s;uppo&s;ed, that this pa&s;&s;age is to be taken literally, as importing that at that time, Je&s;us Chri&s;t will come in his human nature, from heaven to earth; and &s;et his kingdom up here, and reign vi&s;ibly, and per&s;onally, and with di&s;tingui&s;hed glory on earth. And that the bodies of the martyrs, and other eminent chri&s;tians, will then be rai&s;ed from the dead, in which they &s;hall live and reign with Chri&s;t here on earth, a thou&s;and years.

And this they &s;uppo&s;e, is meant by the fir&s;t re&s;urrection. Tho&s;e who agree in general in this notion of the Millennium, differ with re|&s;pect to many circum&s;tances, which it is needle&s;s to mention here.</P>
<P>Others have under&s;tood this paragraph of &s;cripture, in a figura|tive &s;en&s;e. That by this reign of Chri&s;t on earth, is not meant his coming from heaven to earth, in his human, vi&s;ible nature; but his taking to him&s;elf his power, and utterly overthrowing the kingdom of &s;atan, and &s;etting up his own kingdom in all the world, which before this had been confined to very narrow bounds; and &s;ubduing all hearts to a willing &s;ubjection, and thus reigning over all men, who &s;hall then be in the world, and live in that thou|&s;and years. And by "The &s;ouls of them which were beheaded for the witne&s;s of Je&s;us, and for the word of God, and which had not wor&s;hipped the bea&s;t, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands," living again and reigning with Chri&s;t a thou&s;and years; they &s;uppo&s;e, is not meant a literal re&s;urrection, or the re&s;urrection of their bodies, which is not a&s;&s;erted here, as there is nothing &s;aid of their bodies, or of their being rai&s;ed to lite: But that they &s;hall live again and reign with Chri&s;t, in the revival, pro&s;perity, reign and triumph of that cau&s;e and intere&s;t in which they lived, and for the promotion of which they died; and in who&s;e death, the cau&s;e &s;eemed in a mea&s;ure, and for a time, to die and be lo&s;t. And they &s;hall live again in their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, who &s;hall ari&s;e and &s;tand up with the &s;ame &s;pirit, and in the &s;ame cau&s;e, in which they lived and died, and fill the world and reign with Chri&s;t a thou&s;and years, agreeable to ancient prophecies. "The meek &s;hall inherit the earth. And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatne&s;s of the kingdom under the whole heaven, &s;hall be given to the people of the &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High; who&s;e kingdom is an everla&s;ting kingdom,

And they &s;uppo&s;e, that this revival of the truths and cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, by the numerous inhabi|tants of the earth, ri&s;ing up to a new and holy life, and filling the world with holine&s;s and happine&s;s, is that which is here called the <HI>fir&s;t re&s;urrection,</HI> in di&s;tinction from the &s;econd, which will con&s;i&s;t in the re&s;urrection of the body; whereas this is a &s;piritual re&s;urrec|tion; a re&s;urrection of the truths and cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, which had been in a great degree, dead and lo&s;t; and a re&s;urrection of the &s;ouls of men, by the renovation of the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>That this important pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture, is to be under&s;tood in the figurative &s;en&s;e, la&s;t mentioned, is very probable, if not certain. And the following con&s;iderations are thought &s;ufficient to &s;up|port it.</P>
<P N="1">1. Mo&s;t, if not all the prophecies in this book, are delivered in figurative language, referring to types and events recorded in the Old Te&s;tament; and in imitation of the language of the ancient Prophets. And this was proper and even nece&s;&s;ary in the be&s;t manner to an&s;wer the ends of prophecy, as might ea&s;ily be &s;hown, were it nece&s;&s;ary. The fir&s;t part of this pa&s;&s;age, all mu&s;t allow, is figurative. Satan cannot be bound with a literal, material chain. The key, the great chain, and the &s;eal, cannot be under&s;tood liter|ally. The whole is a figure, and can mean no more than that when the time of the Millennium arrives, or rather previous to it, Je&s;us Chri&s;t will lay effectual re&s;traints on &s;atan, &s;o that his power|ful and prevailing influence by which he has before deceived and de&s;troyed a great part of mankind, &s;hall be wholly taken from him, for a thou&s;and years. And it is mo&s;t natural to under&s;tand the other part of the de&s;cription of this remarkable event to be repre|&s;ented in the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">igurative language; as the whole is a repre&s;en|tation of one &s;cene; e&s;pecially, &s;ince no rea&s;on can be given why it &s;hould not be under&s;tood &s;o: And there are rea&s;ons again&s;t tak|ing it in a literal &s;en&s;e, which will be mentioned in the following particulars.</P>
<P N="2">2. To &s;uppo&s;e that Chri&s;t &s;hall come in his human nature to this earth, and live here in his whole per&s;on vi&s;ibly a thou&s;and years, before the day of judgment, appears to be contrary to &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture.</P>
<P>The coming of Chri&s;t, and his appearing at the day of judg|ment in his human nature, is &s;aid to be his <HI>&s;econd</HI> appearance, an&s;wering to his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> appearance in his human nature on earth,
<PB N="45" REF="025635_0044_0FCEAC53321A1490">from his birth to his a&s;cen&s;ion into heaven, which was pa&s;t. "And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: So Chri&s;t was once offered to bear the &s;ins of many; and unto them who look for him &s;hall he appear the <HI>&s;econd time,</HI> without &s;in, unto &s;alvation."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix. 27, 28.</NOTE> The appearance here &s;poken of, is the appearance of Chri&s;t at the day of judgment, to complete the &s;alvation of his church. This could not be his appearing the &s;e|cond time, were he thus to appear, and to be bodily pre&s;ent in his human nature on earth, in the time of the Millennium, which is to take place before the day of judgment. The coming of Chri&s;t, does not always intend his coming vi&s;ibly in his human nature; but he is &s;aid to come, when he de&s;troyed the temple and nation of the Jews, and appeared in favour of his church. So his de|&s;truction of heathen Rome, and delivering his church from that per&s;ecuting power, was an in&s;tance of his coming. And he will, in the &s;ame way, come to de&s;troy antichri&s;t, and the kingdom of &s;atan in the world, and introduce the Millennium; and in the&s;e in&s;tances, and others, he may be &s;aid to appear. But his coming to judgment, and appearing to complete the final de&s;truction of all his enemies, and to perfect the &s;alvation of his church, is his la&s;t coming and appearance. And though this will not be his &s;e|cond appearance and coming, in the &s;en&s;e now mentioned, and with reference to tho&s;e in&s;tances of his coming; yet, as he will then come and appear vi&s;ibly in his human nature; this will be his &s;econd coming and appearance in this way and manner, having never appeared on earth in his human nature more than once be|fore, or &s;ince his fir&s;t a&s;cen&s;ion to heaven, after his incarnation. Therefore, when the final judgment &s;hall take place, Chri&s;t is re|pre&s;ented as being revealed, and coming from heaven, and this is often called, by way of eminence, his <HI>appearing;</HI> meaning his ap|pearing and coming from heaven in vi&s;ible &s;plendor and glory, in his whole per&s;on, in both natures, divine and human. But if he were here on earth, vi&s;ible in his human nature, and reigning in his glorified body, during the Millennium; he would be already here to attend the la&s;t judgment, and he could not be properly &s;aid to come from heaven, and to be revealed from heaven, be|cau&s;e this was done a thou&s;and years before. Therefore, that Chri&s;t &s;hould come from heaven, and appear and reign in his hu|man nature and pre&s;ence before the day of judgment, &s;eems to be contrary to the following &s;criptures: "For the Lord him&s;elf
<PB N="46" REF="025635_0045_0FCEAC5440F77B78">&s;hall <HI>de&s;cend from heaven</HI> with a &s;hout, with the voice of the arch|angel, and with the trump of God: And the dead in Chri&s;t &s;hall ri&s;e fir&s;t. When the Lord Je&s;us &s;hall be <HI>revealed from heaven,</HI> with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, &amp;c. When he <HI>&s;hall come</HI> to be glorified in his &s;aints."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 The&s;&s;. iv. 16. 2 The&s;&s;. i. 7, 8, 10.</NOTE> This is evidently his appearing the &s;econd time, for the &s;alvation of all them that look for him; and were he on earth be|fore this, in the human nature, during the time of the Millenni|um, how could he be &s;aid to be <HI>revealed,</HI> to <HI>de&s;cend</HI> and <HI>come from</HI> heaven to judge the world?</P>
<P N="3">3. As it &s;eems to be contrary to the above mentioned &s;crip|tures to &s;uppo&s;e, that Chri&s;t will appear on earth, and reign a thou&s;and years in his human nature; &s;o it appears contrary to all rea&s;on. Je&s;us Chri&s;t is now on the throne of the univer&s;e, having all power in heaven and earth given to him as God-man, and Redeemer, being made head over all things to the church. He is in the mo&s;t proper, agreeable, and convenient &s;ituation to gov|ern the world, and take care of his church. It does not appear agreeable to his &s;tation and office, as king and head over all things, for him to de&s;cend in the human nature, and erect a throne on earth; which, &s;o far as can be conceived, would be no advantage to his per&s;on, de&s;ign and work; but very much to the contrary. He is gone to heaven in the human nature, that he might reign there, till his enemies are made his foot&s;tool, and all things &s;hall be &s;ubdued under him. And his church on earth will enjoy him to as great a degree, and as much advantage, as if he were per&s;on|ally on earth in the human nature, and more; and will have as great enjoyment of his pre&s;ence. He is now in the be&s;t &s;ituation to be adored and wor&s;hipped by his church on earth. Though they now do not &s;ee him, yet believing and loving him, they re|joice with joy un&s;peakable and full of glory. And it would not tend to increa&s;e this faith, love and joy, to have him come from heaven, and live in &s;ome place on earth, in his human nature; but the contrary: For but few, compared with the whole inhabitants of the world, could have acce&s;s to him, or &s;ee him more than they now do. And when the human nature is in heaven, all may equally have acce&s;s to him, love and wor&s;hip him. His church and kingdom on earth will be as happy, &s;plendid and glorious, as if he were on earth, as he is now in heaven, and much more &s;o; for the&s;e will con&s;i&s;t in his &s;piritual pre&s;ence and influence, which
<PB N="47" REF="025635_0046_0FCEAC55CACF8C30">may be as great while his human nature is in heaven, as if it were on earth; and in their holy conformity to Chri&s;t, which would not be increa&s;ed by his being in that &s;en&s;e on earth. It hence ap|pears in no re&s;pect advantageous or de&s;irable, but the contrary, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hould come per&s;onally in the human nature from heaven to earth, to reign here with his church, or that he &s;hould thus appear, till he &s;hall come to judgment. It is there|fore unrea&s;onable to expect or &s;uppo&s;e he will thus come, unle&s;s it were expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erted in &s;cripture, which it certainly is not; but there are &s;ome, if not many pa&s;&s;ages, which &s;eem to be incon&s;i&s;tent with it.</P>
<P>It may be proper to ob&s;erve here, that the que&s;tion re&s;pecting the manner in which Chri&s;t will reign on earth in the Millennium, has no concern with the que&s;tion concerning the literal or figura|tive meaning of this pa&s;&s;age, as the former does not depend upon the latter: For no man will &s;uppo&s;e, that Chri&s;t's reigning on earth, is to be under&s;tood in a figurative &s;en&s;e. If he &s;hall reign on earth in the hearts of men, by their voluntary &s;ubjection to him, he will reign as literally, as if he were pre&s;ent on earth in his humanity.

<P>He &s;ays, "It is appointed unto man once to die, but after this the judgment."

He addre&s;&s;es chri&s;tians in the following words, "If ye then be ri&s;en with Chri&s;t, &s;eek tho&s;e things which are above, where Chri&s;t &s;itteth on the right hand of God.

The Apo&s;tle Peter, &s;peaking of the di&s;&s;olution of the heavens and earth, &s;ays, "Neverthele&s;s we, according to his promi&s;e, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteou&s;ne&s;s."

<P N="5">5. It does not appear de&s;irable, or to be any advantage to the departed faints, or to the church of Chri&s;t on earth, to have the bodies of all who have died before the Millennium, rai&s;ed from their graves, and come to live a thou&s;and years in this world, before the general re&s;urrection. They are now perfectly holy and happy; and &s;o far as can be conceived, it would be no addition, but a diminution to their happine&s;s, to come and live in this world, in the body, to eat and drink, and partake of the enjoyments of the world. This would be a degradation, which on no account can be de&s;irable to the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t, now made perfect in heaven. And it would be no advance in the work of redemption, which is then to be carried on in a greater degree, than ever before. Nor would this be any advantage to the church, in that happy &s;tate, to which it will then be brought; but the contrary, as they would take up that room in the world, which will be then wanted
<PB N="50" REF="025635_0049_0FCEAC5B23AA7670">for tho&s;e who will be born in that day.

The inhabitants of heaven have a more particular and exten&s;ive knowledge, of what takes place in favour of the church on earth, than any in this world have, or than they could have, were they to come and live here. They know of every conver&s;ion that takes place in this world; and they mu&s;t have the knowledge of the &s;tate of the church on earth, and of every event which comes to pa&s;s in favour of it, and &s;ee the whole of its pro&s;perity. And they have great joy in every thing of this kind. "There is joy in heaven, in pre&s;ence of the angels of God, over one &s;inner that repenteth." How greatly will the happine&s;s and joy in heaven be increa&s;ed, when all the inhabitants of the world &s;hall be converted to Chri&s;t, and the church of Chri&s;t &s;hall fill the earth, and appear in the beauty of holine&s;s! Agree|able to this, the inhabitants of heaven are repre&s;ented as greatly rejoicing in the pro&s;perity of the church on earth, and the over|throw of all her enemies. "Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy Apo&s;tles and Prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.

<P N="6">6. There is nothing expre&s;sly &s;aid of the re&s;urrection of the body in this pa&s;&s;age.

And as there is noth|ing &s;aid of the body, and he only &s;aw their &s;ouls to live, this does not appear to be a proper expre&s;&s;ion, to denote the re&s;urrection of the body, and their living in that. This therefore does not &s;eem

We are therefore warranted to look for ano|ther meaning, and to acquie&s;ce in it, if one can be found, which is more ea&s;y and natural, and more agreeable to the whole pa&s;&s;age, and to the &s;cripture in general. Therefore,</P>
<P N="7">7. The mo&s;t ea&s;y and probable meaning is, that the &s;ouls of the martyrs, and all the faithful followers of Chri&s;t, who have lived in the world, and have died before the Millennium &s;hall commence, &s;hall revive and live again, in their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, who &s;hall ri&s;e up in the &s;ame &s;pirit, and in the &s;ame character, in which they lived and died; and in the revival and flouri&s;hing of that cau&s;e which they e&s;pou&s;ed, and &s;pent their lives in promoting it, which cau&s;e &s;hall appear to be almo&s;t lo&s;t and dead, previous to the intro|duction of that glorious day.

<P>This is agreeable to the way of repre&s;enting things in &s;cripture, in other in&s;tances. John the bapti&s;t was Elijah, becau&s;e he ro&s;e in the &s;pirit of Elijah, and promoted the &s;ame cau&s;e in which Elijah lived and died; and Elijah revived and lived in John the bapti&s;t, becau&s;e he went before Chri&s;t, in the &s;pirit and power of Elijah.

<P>It is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that the revival and re&s;toration of the church to a &s;tate of pro&s;perity, from a dark, low &s;tate, is repre&s;ent|ed by a re&s;urrection to life, or as life from the dead.

<P>This is the fir&s;t re&s;urrection, in which all they who have a part are ble&s;&s;ed and holy.

<P>THE way is now prepared, to con&s;ider and &s;how more particu|larly, in what the happine&s;s and glory of the Millennium will con|&s;i&s;t; and what particular circum&s;tances will attend the church at that day: What is revealed concerning this by expre&s;s prophecies, and what is implied in them, or may be deduced as con&s;equences from what is expre&s;sly declared. It will be no wonder if &s;ome mi&s;takes &s;hould be made on this point; but it is hoped if there &s;hould be any, they will not be very hurtful: And it is appre|hended that the greate&s;t error will be in falling &s;hort, and not coming up to the reality, in the de&s;cription of the happine&s;s and glory of that day; for doubtle&s;s, our ideas of the&s;e, when rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t of which we are at pre&s;ent capable, fall va&s;tly &s;hort of the truth. There is good rea&s;on to conclude, however, that the church, and chri&s;tians, will not be perfectly holy in that day; but that every one will be attended with a degree of &s;inful imperfec|tion, while in the body, however great may be his attainments and advantages in knowledge and holine&s;s. Doubtle&s;s the in&s;pired declarations, that "There is no man which &s;inneth not&mdash;There is not a ju&s;t man upon earth, that doeth good and &s;inneth not&mdash; That if any who profe&s;&s;es to be a chri&s;tian, &s;ay he hath no &s;in, he deceiveth him&s;elf, and the truth is not in him," will remain true to the end of the world, even in the Millennium; and there will be no perfection on this &s;ide heaven.

The following things will take place in the Millennium in an eminent degree, as they never did before; which may be men|tioned as generals, including many particulars, &s;ome of which will be afterwards &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P N="1">I. THAT will be a time of eminent holine&s;s, when it &s;hall be acted out by all, in a high degree, in all the branches of it, &s;o as to appear in its true beauty, and the happy effects of it. This will be the peculiar glory, and the &s;ource of the happine&s;s of the Millennium. The Prophet Zechariah, &s;peaking of that day, &s;ays, "In that day, &s;hall there be upon the bells of the hor&s;es, HOLI|NESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots of the Lord's hou&s;e &s;hall be like the bowls before the altar. Yea, every pot in Jeru&s;a|lem and in Judah, &s;hall be holine&s;s unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Lord of ho&s;ts."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. xiv, 20, 21.</NOTE>&mdash; In the&s;e metaphorical expre&s;&s;ions, is declared the eminent degree of holine&s;s of that day, which will con&s;ecrate every thing, even all the uten&s;ils and the common bu&s;ine&s;s and enjoyments of life, unto the Lord.</P>
<P>Holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in love to God, and to man, with every affec|tion and exerci&s;e implied in this, which being expre&s;&s;ed and acted out, appears in the exerci&s;e of piety towards God, in every branch of it; and of righteou&s;ne&s;s and goodne&s;s, or di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence towards man, including our&s;elves. This, &s;o far as it &s;hall take place, will bani&s;h all the evils which have exi&s;ted and prevailed in the world; and becoming univer&s;al, and ri&s;ing to a high and emi|nent degree, will introduce a &s;tate of enjoyment and happine&s;s, which never was known before on earth; and render it a re&s;em|blance of heaven in a high degree.</P>
<P>This will be effected by the abundant influences of the Holy Spirit, poured down on men more univer&s;ally, and in more con|&s;tant and plentiful effu&s;ions, than ever before; for all holine&s;s in man, is the effect of the Holy Spirit. That day will be, in a peculiar &s;en&s;e, <HI>the di&s;ten&s;ation of the Holy Spirit,</HI> when he will appear as the author of all holine&s;s, by who&s;e influence alone divine re|vealed truth, and all religious in&s;titutions and means, become efficacious and &s;alutary; by which he will have peculiar honour, in the holine&s;s and &s;alvation which &s;hall then take place. The prophecies of &s;cripture which re&s;pect the Millennium, repre&s;ent it in this light. God, &s;peaking by I&s;aiah of that time, &s;ays, "I will pour water upon him that is thir&s;ty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my &s;pirit upon thy &s;eed, and my ble&s;&s;ing upon thine

And the &s;ame time and event is mention|ed as the effect of the Holy Spirit, poured out upon the church. "Neither will I hide my face any more from them: <HI>For I have poured out my Spirit upon the hou&s;e of I&s;rael,</HI> &s;aith the Lord God."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxix. 29.</NOTE> The &s;ame event is predicted by the Prophet Joel. "And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all fle&s;h. And al&s;o upon the &s;ervants, and upon the handmaids in the&s;e days, will I pour out my Spirit."

<P N="2">II. THERE will be a great increa&s;e of light and knowledge to a degree va&s;tly beyond what has been before. This is indeed im|plied in the great degree of holine&s;s, which has been mentioned. For knowledge, mental light, and holine&s;s, are in&s;eparably con|nected; and are, in &s;ome re&s;pects, the &s;ame. Holine&s;s is true light and di&s;cerning, &s;o far as it depends upon a right ta&s;te, and con&s;i&s;ts in it; and it is a thir&s;t after every kind and degree of u&s;eful knowledge; and this de&s;ire and thir&s;t for knowledge, will be great and &s;trong, in proportion to the degree of holine&s;s exerci&s;ed: And forms the mind to con&s;tant attention, and to make &s;wift ad|vances in under&s;tanding and knowledge; and becomes a &s;trong guard again&s;t mi&s;takes, error and delu&s;ion. Therefore, a time of eminent holine&s;s, mu&s;t be a time of proportionably great light and knowledge. This is the repre&s;entation which the &s;cripture gives of that time. The end of binding &s;atan, and ca&s;ting him into the bottomle&s;s pit, is &s;aid to be, "That he &s;hould deceive the nations no more, till the thou&s;and years &s;hould be fulfilled." This will put an end to the darkne&s;s, and multiplicity of &s;trong delu&s;ions, which do prevail, and will prevail, till that time, by which &s;atan &s;upports and promotes his intere&s;t and kingdom among men.&mdash; Then "The face of the covering ca&s;t over all people, and the vail &s;pread over all nations, &s;hall be taken away and de&s;troyed:"

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. xxxii. 3, 4.</NOTE> The &s;uperior light and know|ledge of that day, is metaphorically repre&s;ented in the following words: "Moreover, the light of the moon &s;hall be as the light of the &s;un, and the light of the &s;un &s;hall be &s;even fold, as the light of &s;even days, in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the &s;troke of their wound."

<P>The holy &s;criptures will then be attended to by all, and &s;tudied with care, meekne&s;s, humility and uprightne&s;s of heart, earne&s;tly de&s;iring to under&s;tand them, and know the truth; and the truths they contain will be received with a high reli&s;h and delight: And the Bible will be much better under&s;tood, than ever before. Many things expre&s;&s;ed or implied in the &s;cripture, which are now over|looked and di&s;regarded, will then be di&s;covered, and appear im|portant and excellent; and tho&s;e things which now appear intri|cate and unintelligible, will then appear plain and ea&s;y. Then public teachers will be eminently burning and &s;hining lights; apt to teach; &s;cribes well in&s;tructed into the things of the kingdom of heaven, who will bring out of their trea&s;ures, things new and old: And the hearers will be all attention, and receive the truth in the love of it, into hone&s;t and good hearts; and light and knowledge will con&s;tantly increa&s;e. The conver&s;ation of friends and neighbours, when they meet, will be full of in&s;truction, and they will a&s;&s;i&s;t each other in their inquiries after the truth, and in pur&s;uit of knowledge. Parents will be able and di&s;po&s;ed to in&s;truct their children, as &s;oon as they are capable of learning; and they will early under&s;tand what are the great and leading truths which are revealed in the Bible, and the duties and in&s;titutions there pre&s;cribed. And from their childhood they will know and under|&s;tand the holy &s;criptures, by which they will grow in under&s;tand|ing and wi&s;dom; and will &s;oon know more than the greate&s;t and be&s;t divines have known in ages before. And a happy foundation will be laid for great advances in knowledge and u&s;efulne&s;s to the end of life. Agreeable to this, the &s;cripture, &s;peaking of that day, &s;ays, "There &s;hall be no more thence (i. e. in the church) an in|fant

"Nor an old man that hath not filled his days." That is, an old man who has not improved in knowledge and u&s;efulne&s;s and every good attainment, according to his age. "For a child &s;hall die an hundred years old." That is, children in years &s;hall then make &s;uch early progre&s;s in knowledge, and in religion, and in all excellent and u&s;eful attainments, that they &s;hall equal, if not &s;urpa&s;s, the highe&s;t attainments in the&s;e things, of the olde&s;t men who have lived in former ages.</P>
<P>They will then have every de&s;irable advantage and opportunity to get knowledge. They will all be engaged in the &s;ame pur&s;uit, and give all the aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to each other, in their power.&mdash; They will all have &s;ufficient lei&s;ure to pur&s;ue and acquire learning of every kind, that will be beneficial to them&s;elves and to &s;ociety; e&s;pecially knowledge of divinity.

<P N="3">III. IT will be a time of univer&s;al peace, love and general and cordial friend&s;hip. War and all &s;trife and contention &s;hall then cea&s;e, and be &s;ucceeded by mutual love, friend&s;hip and benificence. Tho&s;e lu&s;ts of men, which originate in &s;elf love, or &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, which produce all the wars and &s;trifes among men, &s;hall be &s;ub|dued and mortified, and yield to that di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence, that heavenly wi&s;dom, which is peaceable, gentle and ea&s;y to be intreated. This will effectually put an end to war, as the &s;cripture teaches. "And he &s;hall judge among the nations, and &s;hall re|buke many people: And they &s;hall beat their &s;words into plow|&s;hares, and their &s;pears into pruning hooks: Nation &s;hall not lift up &s;word again&s;t nation, neither &s;hall they learn war any more.

"The meek &s;hall inherit the earth, and &s;hall delight them&s;elves in the abund|ance of peace."

And the cow and the bear &s;hall feed; their young ones &s;hall lie down together: And the lion &s;hall eat &s;traw, like the ox.

<P N="4">IV. IN that day, men will not only be united in peace and love, as brethren; but will agree in &s;entiments, re&s;pecting the doctrines and truth contained in the Bible, and the religious in&s;ti|tutions and practice, which are there pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians have been from the beginning of chri&s;tianity to this day, greatly divided, and have oppo&s;ed each other in their religious &s;entiments and practices; and are now divided into vari|ous parties, &s;ects and denominations, while all appeal to divine revelation, and profe&s;s to take their &s;entiments and practices from that.</P>
<P>It has been often &s;aid by &s;ome profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians, and is a &s;entiment which appears to be &s;preading at this day, That differ|ence in religious &s;entiments, and in attendance on the in&s;titutions of the go&s;pel, and modes of wor&s;hip, is attended with no incon|venience, but is rather de&s;irable, and advantageous; and by this variety, chri&s;tianity is rendered more agreeable and beautiful.
<PB N="61" REF="025635_0060_0FCEAC6BB5FF2E60">That it is impo&s;&s;ible that all men, who&s;e capacities and genius are &s;o different and various, and their minds, and way of thinking and conception are naturally &s;o far from being alike, &s;hould ever be brought to think alike, and embrace the &s;ame religious &s;entiments. That this difference in man's belief and &s;entiment cannot be criminal; for men are no more obliged to think alike, than they are to look alike, and have the &s;ame bodily features and &s;tature. All the union that is required, or that can take place, is that of kind affection, love and charity.</P>
<P>But &s;uch &s;entiments as the&s;e are not agreeable to rea&s;on or &s;cripture. Error in judgment and &s;entiment, e&s;pecially in things of a moral nature, is always wrong; and does not con&s;i&s;t or originate merely in any defect of the moral faculties of the mind; but is of a moral nature, in which the ta&s;te, affection, or inclina|tion of the heart is concerned; and therefore is always, in every degree of it, morally wrong, and more or le&s;s criminal. Were the moral faculties of the mind, were the heart, perfectly right, man would not be capable of error, or of judging wrong, or mak|ing any mi&s;take, e&s;pecially in things of religion. The natural faculties of the mind, of perception and under&s;tanding or rea&s;on, con&s;idered as &s;eparate from the inclination or will, do not lead, and have no tendency in them&s;elves, to judge wrong, or contrary to the truth of things. To do &s;o, is to judge without evidence, and contrary to it, which the mind never would or could do, were not the inclination or heart concerned in it, &s;o as to have influence, which mu&s;t be a wrong inclination, and contrary to the truth, and to evidence; and therefore is morally wrong, or criminal.</P>
<P>Therefore, all the mi&s;takes and wrong opinions which men en|tertain, re&s;pecting the doctrines, in&s;titutions and duties revealed in the Bible, are criminal, and of a bad tendency. They mu&s;t be &s;o, as they are contrary to man's obligation and duty to believe all revealed truth; and are wholly owing to a wrong bias or in|clination, or the depravity and corruption of the heart. What God has revealed in his word, he has declared to man, to be re|ceived by him, and believed to be the truth; of which he has given &s;ufficient evidence. And the man who does not believe what God has clearly revealed, and of which he has given &s;ufficient evidence, even all that can be rea&s;onably de&s;ired, does abu&s;e and pervert his own under&s;tanding, and &s;huts his eyes again&s;t the truth, and re|fu&s;es to receive the te&s;timony which God has given. And who will &s;ay there is no crime in this!</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="025635_0061_0FCEAC6CFA9ACAD8">
Since therefore, all mi&s;takes and errors, contrary to the truths made known in the Bible, are criminal, and owing to the corrup|tion of the heart of man, then perfect holine&s;s will exclude all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r|ror, and there neither is, nor can be, any wrong judgment in hea|ven; and in the Millennium, which will be a greater image of heaven than ever was before on earth, holine&s;s, light and know|ledge, will ri&s;e &s;o high, that the former errors in principle and practice will &s;ub&s;ide, and there will be a great and general union in the belief and practice of the truth, contained in divine reve|lation.</P>
<P>As there is but "one Lord, one faith, and one bapti&s;m," &s;o in that day men will be united in the belief and profe&s;&s;ion of this one faith, in the &s;y&s;tem of doctrines revealed in the Bible, which then will appear plain, and with the cleare&s;t evidence to all. And they will have one common Lord, will under&s;tand, and obey all the commands of Chri&s;t; and they will know what are the in|&s;titutions and ordinances which Chri&s;t has appointed, which are all implied in bapti&s;m: They will under&s;tand what is the import of this, and implied in it, and be united in &s;entiments and practice, &s;o as to form a beautiful, happy union and harmony; which will put an end to the variety and oppo&s;ition of opinions, and practices, which now divide profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians into &s;o many &s;ects, parties and denominations. The whole church, with all the members of it, which will fill the earth, and include all mankind then living, will in that day, come to that to which the go&s;pel tends, and is de&s;igned to bring it: It will "Come in <HI>the unity of the &s;aith,</HI> and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the mea&s;ure of the &s;tature of the fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t: That they &s;hall be no more children, to&s;&s;ed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the &s;leight of men, and the cunning craftine&s;s, whereby they lie in wait to deceive: But &s;peaking the truth in love, &s;hall grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Chri&s;t."

<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">They who talk of chri&s;tian union, love and charity, where there is no agreement in &s;entiment, re&s;pecting the truths and doctrines of the go&s;pel, but a great difference and oppo&s;ition; and think that doctrinal &s;entiments are of no importance in chri&s;tianity; and that their having no belief of par|ticular doctrines, and no creed; or differing in their religious &s;entiments ever &s;o much, is no impediment to the greate&s;t union and chri&s;tian friend|&s;hip, &s;eem not to know, what real chri&s;tian union, love and friend&s;hip is.

<P>And when this language &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and become univer|&s;al, all the learning and wi&s;dom in the world, will tend and &s;erve to improve it, and render it more and more perfect.

<P>This will al&s;o greatly facilitate the &s;preading u&s;eful knowledge, and all kinds of intelligence, which may be a benefit to mankind, to all parts of the world; and render books very cheap, and ea&s;y to be obtained by all.

<P>ALL who attend to the &s;ubject of the Millennium, will naturally inquire, When this happy time will take place; and how long it will be before it &s;hall be introduced?

<P>Though it may be evident from &s;cripture, that the &s;eventh thou&s;and years of the world, will be the time of the pro&s;perity of the church of Chri&s;t, on earth; yet this event may come on by degrees, and be in a mea&s;ure introduced years before that time, and the church may not be brought to the mo&s;t comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">te and happy &s;tate of that day, but &s;till have farther advances to make, after this &s;eventh thou&s;and years begin, and continue &s;ome years after they are ended: So that the particular year of the beginning or end of this time, cannot be known, before it actually takes place.</P>
<P>It is thought that there is rea&s;on to conclude from divine reve|lation, that the &s;eventh millenary of the world, will be the time in which the church of Chri&s;t will enjoy a &s;abbath of re&s;t, and be brought to its highe&s;t and chief pro&s;perity in this world, which is &s;o much the &s;ubject of &s;cripture prophecy; and that the end of the world, and the day of general judgment, will take place &s;oon after this Millennium is over.

<P><PB N="85" REF="025635_0084_0FCEAC933A695E80">

And that this has been handed down as the opinion of many ancients, both Jews and Chri&s;tians.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Sect. I.

And the &s;eventh month in every year, was a fe&s;tival and &s;acred month, above all other months of the year. In this month was the fea&s;t of Tabernacles, which was to be ob&s;erved &s;even days with great joy. On the fir&s;t day of this month was the fea&s;t of trumpets, when the trumpets were to be blown through all the land, which was a type of the extraor|dinary preaching of the go&s;pel which will introduce the Millen|nium.

<P>If it were known when the Bi&s;hop of Rome fir&s;t became what is de&s;igned to be denoted by the bea&s;t, the time of his fall, and of the end of the church of Rome, and of &s;atan's kingdom in the world, when the Millennium will communce, could not be a&s;certained up a year. But as this bea&s;t ro&s;e gradually from &s;tep to &s;tep, till he became a bea&s;t, in the highe&s;t and mo&s;t proper &s;en&s;e, this involves the &s;ubject in &s;ome degree of uncertainty, and renders it more dif|ficult to determine, at which con&s;iderable increa&s;e and advance of the Bi&s;hop of Rome in power and influence, the thou&s;and two hun|dred and &s;ixty years began. He had great influence, not only in the church, in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, but in the temporal affairs of the Roman empire, and of the kingdoms which were erected in it, by the inva&s;ion of the northern nations, before he was publicly ac|knowledged and declared to be Univer&s;al Bi&s;hop; which was done in the year of Chri&s;t, 606. This greatly increa&s;ed his influence and power in the chri&s;tian world; and the church was now become ex|ceeding corrupt. If the 1260 years be reckoned from this time, they will end in the year 1866, &s;eventy four years from this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, viz. 1792.

<P>This is the mo&s;t remarkable epoch; when the Pope became a bea&s;t, in the mo&s;t proper &s;en&s;e, from whence his reign is to be dated. Twelve hundred and &s;ixty years from this date, 756, will end near the beginning of the &s;eventh thou&s;andth years of the world.

In the an&s;wer to
<PB N="94" REF="025635_0093_0FCEACA17AA70F78">Daniel's que&s;tion, two different numbers of years are mentioned, when tho&s;e evil things &s;hall come to an end, and the prophana|tion of the church, and the wor&s;hip and ordinances of Chri&s;t, &s;hall cea&s;e, and the church &s;hall be re&s;tored to due order, and be ble&s;&s;ed and brought to a happy, glorious &s;tate, viz. 1290, and 1335 years. The fir&s;t is 30 years longer than the time mentioned above, and in the Revelation, and the la&s;t exceeds it 75 years. This &s;eeming difference may be reconciled by ob&s;erving, that the&s;e an&s;wers do not re&s;pect preci&s;ely the &s;ame event. The former expre&s;&s;es the time of the continuance and reign of antichri&s;t, in which he &s;hall oppre&s;s the church of Chri&s;t: And when he &s;hall have accompli&s;hed to &s;cat|ter the power of the holy people, he &s;hall be de&s;troyed. The latter looks forward to the recovery of the church of Chri&s;t, from her low, afflicted, broken &s;tate, to a &s;tate of peace and pro&s;perity, in the proper u&s;e and enjoyment of the wor&s;hip, in&s;titutions and ordi|nances of Chri&s;t, which had been to greatly corrupted by the fal&s;e church of Rome. It may take &s;ome time to effect this, after the Pope and the church of Rome are wholly de&s;troyed and extinct. As the corruption and perver&s;ion of the church, wor&s;hip and or|dinances of Chri&s;t, was brought on by degrees, and con&s;iderable advances were made in this, after antichri&s;t aro&s;e, and the Pope became a per&s;ecuting bea&s;t; &s;o doubtle&s;s the church will not be wholly purified when this bea&s;t &s;hall be de&s;troyed; but it will be &s;ome time after this, before all corruptions and errors in doctrine and practice, will be wholly extirpated, and the church appear in her true beauty, and come to a &s;tate of univer&s;al, e&s;tabli&s;hed peace and pro&s;perity. Within thirty years after the bea&s;t &s;hall be &s;lain, and his body de&s;troyed and given to the burning flame, or at the end of 1290 years, the church may become univer&s;al, and all na|tions be members of it; and it may arrive to a &s;tate of great pu|rity and peace, and an end be put to all her troubles, and mo&s;t of the wicked be &s;wept off from the face of the earth, by &s;ome re|markable event, and &s;udden &s;troke; by which the kingdom of fatan &s;hall be nearly extinct; and his influence among mankind almo&s;t wholly cea&s;e. But the church of Chri&s;t may not arrive to the mo&s;t pure and happy &s;tate which it &s;hall enjoy, under forty or fifty years after this. For this happy period chri&s;tians mu&s;t wait; and they will be in a peculiar and high degree ble&s;&s;ed, who &s;hall come to this happy and glorious &s;tate of the church, when the fir&s;t re&s;urrection &s;hall be univer&s;al and complete, and the Millennium

But the&s;e events, and the preci&s;e time and manner of their taking place, will be fully known, and the prophecies by which they are foretold, will be better under&s;tood, when they &s;hall be actually accompli&s;hed; and all the mi&s;takes which are now made re&s;pecting them, will be rectified; until which time, they mu&s;t be in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ealed. Neverthele&s;s, it may be evident from divine revelation, that the end of the reign of antichri&s;t draws near, and the time of deliverance of the church, from the dark and low &s;tate in which it has been near twelve hundred years, and of the ruin of the kingdom of &s;atan in the world, is not far off; and that the&s;e great events will come on within two hun|dred years, or about that time; and that the &s;eventh thou&s;and years of the world, is the time fixed for the pro&s;perity of the church of Chri&s;t, and the reign of the &s;aints on earth.

<P>The &s;even vials or cups, which contained the &s;even la&s;t plagues, or remarkable judgments, which are to be executed upon the bea&s;t and his adherents, and upon the world of mankind, are to be poured out during the time of the reign of the bea&s;t, and the exi&s;tence of the fal&s;e church of Rome; and which will i&s;&s;ue in the de&s;truction of the bea&s;t, and of that church. This is evident from the fifteenth and fixteenth chapters of the Revelation. The fir&s;t vial re&s;pects the bea&s;t and his followers, and brought &s;ore calamities upon them, expre&s;&s;ed in the following words: "And
<PB N="99" REF="025635_0098_0FCEACAA7A0E1368">there &s;ell a noi&s;ome and grievous &s;ore upon the men which had the mark of the bea&s;t, and upon them who wor&s;hipped his image."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xvi. 2.</NOTE> A number of the&s;e vials mu&s;t have been already poured out, as the beaf&punc; has exi&s;ted above a thou&s;and years already; and there|fore the effects of the la&s;t vial, which include his utter de&s;truction, will not reach much more than two hundred years from this time; and con&s;equently the&s;e effects will &s;oon begin to take place, if they have not already began in &s;ome mea&s;ure. For as the pouring out or running, of the &s;even vials, is limited to the 1260 years of the continuance of the bea&s;t, there are not 200 years for each vial; and &s;ome may run longer, and others a &s;horter time of this &s;pace.</P>
<P>Some acquaintance with the hi&s;tory of the calamitous events which have taken place, an&s;wering to the prophetic de&s;cription un|der tho&s;e vials which have been poured out, is nece&s;&s;ary in order to know how and when it has been fulfilled, and how many vials appear to have already run out, and which is now running.&mdash; Mr. Lowman has taken pains to &s;how from many credible hi&s;to|rians, that the remarkable calamitous events which have taken place, and which have e&s;pecially affected the bea&s;t and his follow|ers, and brought great and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing evils upon them, have an|&s;wered to the evils and events de&s;cribed in prophetic language, under the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive five fir&s;t vials of wrath: And there appears to be &s;atisfactory evidence that the judgments predicted under the&s;e vials, have already been executed on antichri&s;t, and his &s;upporters and followers: And that the reformation began by Luther, and the remarkable events attending it, was the judgment predicted by the pouring out of the fifth vial, to be inflicted on the bea&s;t and the church of Rome. This vial was to be poured out on the &s;eat, or, as it is in the original, the throne of the bea&s;t&mdash;"And his kingdom was full of darkne&s;s, and they gnawed their tongues for pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m."

All that is &s;ignified by the&s;e words is, that as Jabin king of Cantaan gathered together a great army under Si&s;era, to fight with the God of I&s;rael and his people, at the foot of the mountain of Megiddo; who were there overthrown and de&s;troyed in battle, when "they fought from heaven, the &s;tars in their cour&s;es fought again&s;t Si&s;e|ra:" So by the agency of the &s;pirits of devils, under the &s;uper|intendence and direction of divine providence, the world of man|kind in general, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e in Chri&s;tendom, will be &s;o corrupted and ob&s;tinately rebellious, in all kinds, and the greate&s;t degrees of wickedne&s;s, as to be united, and, in this &s;en&s;e, gathered together, all armed in a &s;piritual war again&s;t God, his cau&s;e and people. And their iniquity being full, and they ripe for the battle, God will ari&s;e as a man of war, and in his providence contend in battle with them, till they be utterly de&s;troyed from the face of the earth. Thus "The wicked &s;hall peri&s;h, and the enemies of the Lord &s;hall be as the fat of lambs, they &s;hall con&s;ume: Into &s;moke &s;hall they con&s;ume away," and by this, way &s;hall be made for the meek to inherit the earth, and delight them&s;elves in the abundance of peace.

There will be the greate&s;t convul&s;ions and revolutions in the political and moral world, that have ever been, attended with awful judgments upon men; which are predicted in prophet|ic language, "And there were voices, and thunders, and light|nings, and a great earthquake, &s;uch as was not &s;ince men were upon the earth, to mighty an earthquake, and &s;o great.

<P>This battle is more particularly de&s;cribed in the nineteenth chapter, from the beginning of the eleventh ver&s;e, to the end of the chapter. "And I &s;aw heaven opened, and behold, a white hor&s;e; and he who &s;at upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteou&s;ne&s;s doth he judge and make war." This per&s;on is farther de&s;cribed, by which he appears to be the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. "And the armies which were in heaven, followed him upon white hor&s;es, clothed in fine linen, white and clean." This does not mean, that the inhabitants of heaven, or the &s;aints on earth, will join in a vi&s;ible army, and per&s;onally &s;ight with the enemies of Chri&s;t and his church, and de&s;troy them: But only that the&s;e &s;hall join with Chri&s;t and be on his &s;ide, when he &s;hall ari&s;e in his providence, and by his power de&s;troy his and their enemies. In this &s;en&s;e, all heaven will be with him, when he &s;hall come forth to battle in his providence, and execute his wrath upon men, in awful &s;ucce&s;&s;ive judgments, in which the angels may be u&s;ed as invi&s;ible in&s;truments of his vengeance: And he will do all this, in an&s;wer to the prayers of his church on earth, and in their cau&s;e, to vindicate and deliver them, and prepare the way for the pro&s;perity of his church on earth. That he will be the great invi&s;ible agent in this battle, appears from the following words: And out of his mouth goeth a &s;harp &s;word, that with it be &s;hould &s;mite the nations: And he &s;hall rule them with a rod of iron: And he treadeth the wine pre&s;s of the tiercene&s;s and wrath of Almighty God." This is the battle of that great day of God Almighty. This awful &s;eene proceeds and is yet farther de&s;cribed: "And I &s;aw an angel &s;tanding in the &s;un; and be cried with a loud voice, &s;aying to all the fowls that fly in the mid&s;t of heaven, Come and gather your&s;elves together unto the &s;upper o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the great God; that ye may eat the fle&s;h of kings, and the

This is a &s;trong, figurative, prophetic expre&s;|&s;ion of the great &s;laughter and terrible de&s;truction of mankind, when God Almighty &s;hall come forth to battle, and manife&s;t his hot di&s;plea&s;ure and terrible wrath, in the judgment he will inflict on them. The repre&s;entation of this battle, and the i&s;&s;ue of it goes on, and "I John &s;aw the bea&s;t, and the kings of the earth, and their armies <HI>gathered together,</HI> to make war again&s;t him who &s;at on the hor&s;e, and again&s;t his army." The&s;e are the &s;ame who are mentioned, chap. xvi. 14, 16, as <HI>gathered together</HI> to the battle of that great day of God Almighty, the meaning of which has been explained. And in this war and battle, the bea&s;t and the fal&s;e pro|phet were taken and de&s;troyed, with their adherents. "And the remnant were &s;lain with the &s;word of him who fat upon the hor&s;e, which &s;word proceedeth out of his mouth, and all the fowls were filled with their fle&s;h." By <HI>the remnant,</HI> are meant the re&s;t of mankind, who by their &s;ins make war with Chri&s;t, and are not in|cluded in the bea&s;t and fal&s;e prophet, and their followers, who be|long to the kingdom of antichri&s;t. Their being &s;lain by the &s;word which proceeded out of the mouth of Chri&s;t, does not mean their conver&s;ion, but their falling victims to his vengeance, which is expre&s;&s;ed by the fowls being filled with their fle&s;h.</P>
<P>The fame battle and &s;laughter of men, is repre&s;ented and pre|dicted in figurative prophetic language, in the fourteenth chapter, where John de&s;cribes a vi&s;ion which he had of one like unto the Son of man, who &s;at upon a white cloud, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a &s;harp fickle. And it was &s;aid un|to him, "Thru&s;t in thy &s;ickle and reap; for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harve&s;t of the earth is ripe. And he thru&s;t in his fickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped. And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he al&s;o having a &s;harp &s;ickle." And it was &s;aid unto him, Thru&s;t in thy &s;harp fickle, and gather the clu&s;ters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. And the angel thru&s;t in his fickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and ca&s;t it into the great wine pre&s;s of the wrath of God. And the wine pre&s;s was trod|den without the city, and blood came out of the wine pre&s;s, even unto the hor&s;e bridles, by the &s;pace of a thou&s;and and &s;ix hundred fur longs."</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="025635_0110_0FCEACBD32780370">
Upon this vi&s;ion it is to be ob&s;erved, that by the harve&s;t of the earth, and the clu&s;ters of the vine of the earth, are meant the in|habitants of the earth, or mankind in general. And reaping the harve&s;t, and gathering the clu&s;ters of the vine of the earth, fignifies the &s;laughter and de&s;truction of the inhabitants of the earth; not every one of them indeed; for in the harve&s;t and vintage, &s;ome ears of corn are commonly left &s;tanding, which e&s;cape the &s;ickle, and a few &s;cattering grapes are left on the vine when the clu&s;ters in general are gathered: And that this &s;laughter and de&s;olation, which &s;hall be made of the inhabitants of the world, will take place in con&s;equence of their apo&s;tacy, and ob&s;tinate continuance and increa&s;e in &s;in, until they are become ripe, fully ripe, for this dread|ful execution and de&s;truction, by divine vengeance: Therefore, that this reaping, and the harve&s;t, and gathering the clu&s;ters of the vine of the earth, will not be a merciful di&s;pen&s;ation towards the inhabitants then in the world; but the execution of divine ven|geance, and an awful exerci&s;e and di&s;play of the di&s;plea&s;ure and wrath of God, in the evils which &s;hall fall on men, for their per|&s;everance and increa&s;e in wickedne&s;s. This is repre&s;ented and expre&s;&s;ed in a &s;triking manner, by the figure of ca&s;ting the vintage into the great wine pre&s;s of the wrath of God, and the large and amazing quantity of blood which proceeded from thence; figni|fying the great and general &s;laughter, and terrible &s;ufferings of mankind, when this time of his wrath &s;hall come.</P>
<P>From this view of the events predicted under the &s;ixth and &s;e|venth vials, it appears, that while the &s;ixth vial is running, the way will be preparing for the overthrow of &s;piritual Babylon.</P>
<P>One event will take place after another, which will greatly weaken and remove the power and influence of the Pope, among the nations in Chri&s;tendom, by taking away his riches, by drying up the &s;tream of wealth, and the removal of other things, by which the church of Rome has been made &s;trong, and &s;tood as impreg|nable for many ages. But this will not be attended by any general reformation of profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians, or revival and great increa&s;e of the true church of Chri&s;t; nor will the moral &s;tate of the chri&s;|tian world, or of mankind in general, be reformed and grow bet|ter, but the contrary. By the evil influence which the bea&s;t and the hierarchy of the church of Rome, has had in the world, and by the power and agency of &s;atan, the unre&s;trained lu&s;ts of men will kurty them on to all kinds of wickedne&s;s; &s;o that it will ri&s;e to a

<P>This battle, by which the wicked will be de&s;troyed, and the reign of Chri&s;t and his church on earth introduced, is frequently brought into view and predicted in the book of P&s;alms.

<P>That the wicked &s;hall be cut off and de&s;troyed from the earth, that the &s;aints may inherit it, is foretold throughout the thirty &s;eventh P&s;alm. "Evil doers &s;hall be cut off: But tho&s;e that wait upon the Lord, they &s;hall inherit the earth.

<P>The &s;ame thing is brought into view in the &s;eventy fifth, &s;eventy &s;ixth, and ninety &s;eventh P&s;alms. "God is the judge, he putteth down one, and &s;etteth up another.

<P>In the prophecy of I&s;aiah, this battle, as it has been explained, is often brought into view, as connected with the pro&s;perity of the church of Chri&s;t on earth, and introductory to it: Some in&s;tances of this will be mentioned. In the five fir&s;t ver&s;es of the &s;econd chapter, there is a prophecy of the happy &s;tate of the church in the la&s;t days, that is, in the Millennium. In the four next ver&s;es is a de&s;crip|tion of the corruption, worldline&s;s and idolatry of the vi&s;ible church, and con&s;equently of the world in general, as the rea&s;on of the di&s;plea&s;ure with them, and his puni&s;hing them. And from the tenth ver&s;e to the end of the chapter, the manife&s;tation of his di&s;plea&s;ure, in his fighting again&s;t them, and puni&s;hing them, is de&s;cribed. "Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the du&s;t, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his maje&s;ty. The lofty looks of man &s;hall be humbled, and the haughtine&s;s of men &s;hall be bowed down, and the Lord alone &s;hall be exalted in that day. For the day of the Lord of ho&s;ts &s;hall be upon every one that is

<P>The eleventh chapter contains a prediction of the Millennium, and of the &s;laughter of the wicked of the earth, which &s;hall make way for it. "With righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity, for the meek of the earth: And he &s;hall &s;mite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his &s;ips &s;hall he &s;lay the wicked."

Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath, and fierce anger, to lay the earth de&s;olate: And he &s;hall de&s;troy the &s;inners thereof out of it.

<P>The twenty fourth chapter is wholly on this &s;ubject, and de|&s;cribes the battle of that great day of God Almighty, and the &s;laughter of the wicked, in clear and &s;triking language, in con&s;e|quence of which, the church and people of God &s;hall &s;pread and

The earth mourneth and &s;adeth away: The world langui&s;heth and fadeth away: The haughty people of the earth do langui&s;h. The earth is al&s;o defiled under the inhabitants thereof, becau&s;e they have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everla&s;ting covenant.

The city of confu&s;ion is broken down: Every hou&s;e is &s;hut up, that no man may remain. In the city is left de|&s;olation, and the gate is &s;mitten with de&s;truction. When thus it &s;hall be, in the mid&s;t of the earth, among the people, there &s;hall be as the &s;haking of an olive tree, and as the gleaning of grapes, when the vintage is done.

<P>Upon this prophecy it may be ob&s;erved, that it is a prediction of great calamities on the inhabitants of the world in general, as a puni&s;hment for their &s;ins, by which the earth is defiled; they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">v|ing tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the laws of God, changed his ordinance, and broken the everla&s;ting covenant.

By violating this covenant, corruption and iniquity, and all the idolatry and abominations which have taken place, or ever will be practi&s;ed among men, have been introduced. And by breaking the everla&s;ting covenant made with Abraham, and tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ing the laws, and changing the ordinances, which have been given and publi&s;hed by Mo&s;es, and the Prophets, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his Apo&s;tles, which, had they been ob&s;erved, would have pre|&s;erved the church uncorrupt, and &s;pread true religion and holine&s;s over the whole earth; by di&s;regarding and violating all the&s;e, the world is filled with wickedne&s;s, which will continue and increa&s;e, until mankind in general &s;hall be ripe for that puni&s;hment, which God will inflict in tho&s;e calamities and judgments, which will de|&s;troy, and &s;weep from the earth, the greate&s;t part of the inhabit|ants; &s;o that there will be but comparatively <HI>few men left, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> the few olives which remain on the tree, after it is &s;haken, and the &s;cat|tering

<P>The prophecy goes on, and the &s;ame events, as to &s;ub&s;tance, and this battle, and the con&s;equence of it, are de&s;cribed in other words: "Fear and the pit, and the &s;nare are upon thee, O in|habitant of the earth.

The earth &s;hall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and &s;hall be moved like a cottage, and the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion thereof &s;hall be heavy upon it, and it &s;hall fall, and not ri&s;e again." This battle is de&s;cribed in the Revelation, in the &s;ame figurative language: "And there was a great earthquake, &s;uch as was not &s;ince men were upon the earth, &s;o mighty an earthquake and &s;o great.

<P>The three next chapters are a continuation of prophecy of the &s;ame event, viz. the judgments which are to be inflicted on the fal&s;e and degenerate profe&s;&s;ors of religion, and the world of man|kind in general, previous to the pro&s;perity of the church and king|dom of Chri&s;t in the world, which will be evident to the careful judicious reader; and that the predictions contained in them, coincide with tho&s;e which have been mentioned. It is needle&s;s to tran&s;cribe any particular pa&s;&s;age here, except the following:&mdash; "Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and &s;hut thy doors about thee; hide thy&s;elf as it were for a little moment, un|til the indignation be overpa&s;&s;ed.

There is no rea&s;on to think, that this puni&s;hment has yet been inflicted; but it will doubtle&s;s be executed by the battle of that great day of God Almighty, men|tioned in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">xteenth chapter of the Revelation; and more partic|ularly de&s;cribed, in the fourteenth and nineteenth chapters, which have been con&s;idered; and in the foregoing prophecies of I&s;aiah, which have been now mentioned.

The &s;ame event is here predicted, of which there is a prophecy in the twentieth chapter of the Revela|tion, viz. of the dragon that old &s;erpent, which is the devil and fatan, being laid hold of, and bound and ca&s;t into the bottomle&s;s pit. And the &s;ame con&s;equence of this with re&s;pect to the church is here foretold, as is de&s;cribed there, viz. the pro&s;perity of it, by the &s;pecial favour and pre&s;ence of God. "In that day &s;ing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine. I the Lord do keep it, I will water it every moment: Left any hurt it, I will keep it night and day." While the battle is going on, and God is puni&s;hing the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity, his people will be hid as in a &s;ecret chamber; but when it is over, they will become as a flouri&s;hing, fruitful vineyard, producing abundance of red wine, in con&s;equence of the peculiar favour and care of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the abundance of heavenly divine influences.</P>
<P>The thirty fourth, and thirty fifth chapters of I&s;aiah, contain a prophecy of the Millennium, and of the day of battle which will precede it, which will con&s;i&s;t in the puni&s;hment of the world for their iniquity.

For the indignation of the Lord is upon all nations, and his fury upon all their armies. He hath utterly de&s;troyed them, he hath delivered them to the &s;laugh|ter. For it is the day of the Lord's vengeance, and the year of recompences for the controver&s;y of Zion. Strengthen ye the weak hands, confirm the feeble knees. Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be &s;trong, fear not: Behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come and fave you. Then the eyes of the blind &s;hall be opened, and the ears of the deaf &s;hall be un&s;topped. Then &s;hall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb &s;hall &s;ing; for in the wilderne&s;s &s;hall waters break out, and &s;treams in the de|&s;ert," &amp;c "And the ran&s;omed of the Lord &s;hall return and come to Zion with &s;ongs, and everla&s;ting joy upon their heads; they &s;hall obtain joy and gladne&s;s, and &s;orrow and &s;ighing &s;hall flee away."</P>
<P>In the forty fir&s;t chapter of I&s;aiah, God, &s;peaking to the church, and promi&s;ing the good things and pro&s;perity which were in &s;tore
<PB N="131" REF="025635_0130_0FCEACDC06476C00">for it in the days of the Millennium, &s;ays, "Behold, all they that are incen&s;ed again&s;t thee, &s;hall be a&s;hamed and confounded: They &s;hall be as nothing, and they that &s;trive with thee, &s;hall peri&s;h. Thou &s;halt &s;eek them, and &s;hall not find them that con|tended with thee: They that war again&s;t thee, &s;hall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought. Behold, I will make thee a new, &s;harp thre&s;hing in&s;trument, having teeth; thou &s;hall thre&s;h the mountains, and beat them &s;mall, and make the hills as chaff. Thou &s;halt fan them, and the wind &s;hall carry them away, and the whirlwind &s;hall &s;catter them: And thou &s;halt rejoice in the Lord, and &s;halt glory in the Holy One of I&s;rael."</P>
<P>In the forty &s;econd chapter, God makes promi&s;es to his church, which are to be accompli&s;hed in their fulne&s;s, in the days of the Millennium, and &s;peaks of the war and battle in which he will de&s;troy his enemies, to open the way for the good thing which was to be done for the church. "The Lord &s;hall go forth as a mighty man, he &s;hall &s;tir up jealou&s;y like a man of war: He &s;hall cry, yea, roar; he &s;hall prevail again&s;t his enemies. I have long time holden my peace, I have been &s;till, and refrained my&s;elf: Now will I cry like a travailing woman, I will de&s;troy and devour at once. I will make wa&s;te mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers i&s;lands, and I will dry up the pools. And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not, I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkne&s;s light before them, and crooked things &s;traight. The&s;e things will I do unto them, and not for&s;ake them."</P>
<P>The fifty ninth and &s;ixtieth chapters, are wholly on this &s;ubject of the Millennium. In the fourteen fir&s;t ver&s;es of the fifty ninth chapter, the great degree of wickedne&s;s of the world of mankind is de&s;cribed. And then God is repre&s;ented as greatly di&s;plea&s;ed, and ri&s;ing to battle, to puni&s;h men for their evil deeds. "And the Lord &s;aw it, and it di&s;plea&s;ed him that there was no judgment. And he &s;aw that there was no man, and he wondered that there was no interce&s;&s;or: Therefore, his arm brought &s;alvation unto him, and his righteou&s;ne&s;s, it &s;u&s;tained him. For he put on righ|teou&s;ne&s;s as a brea&s;tplate, and an helmit of &s;alvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke. According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adver&s;aries, recompence to his enemies; to the i&s;lands he will repay recompence. So &s;hall
<PB N="132" REF="025635_0131_0FCEACDDA1CFFD98">they fear the name of the Lord from the we&s;t, and his glory from the ri&s;ing of the &s;un. When the enemy &s;hall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord &s;hall lift up a &s;tandard again&s;t him." And to this battle, this work of judgment and vengeance, &s;ucceeds the day of light and &s;alvation to the church: Tho&s;e who are left, &s;hall repent and humble them&s;elves, and "fear the name of the Lord from the we&s;t, and his glory from the ri&s;ing of the &s;un. And the Redeemer &s;hall come to Zion, and to them that turn from tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion in Jacob." It will be then &s;aid to the church, "Ari&s;e, &s;hine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is ri&s;en upon thee."&mdash;The prophecy of the Millennium goes on through the &s;ixtieth, &s;ixty fir&s;t, and &s;ixty &s;econd chapters.</P>
<P>There is a parallel repre&s;entation of this battle in the &s;ixty third chapter, as executed by the &s;ame per&s;on who is exhibited in the nineteenth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">apter of the Revelation, riding forth to make war in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and fighting this &s;ame battle, in which the wicked then on earth will be &s;lain. "Who is this that cometh from Edom, with died garments from Bozrah?
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bozrah was in the land of Edom. The Edomites, were implacable enemies to the people of God, and are in the prophecies of I&s;aiah, and el&s;e|where, put for the enemies of God and his church in general, who &s;hall be de&s;troyed, as the Edomites were, of whom the Edomites, and their de&s;truc|tion were a type.</NOTE> This who is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatne&s;s of his &s;trength? I who &s;peak in righteou&s;ne&s;s, mighty to &s;ave. Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him who treadeth in the wine fat? I have trodden the wine pre&s;s alone, and of the people there was none with me: For I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury, and the blood &s;hall be &s;prinked upon my garments, and I will &s;tain all my raiment. For the day of vengeance is in my heart, and the year of my redeemed is come. And I looked, and there was none to help, and I wondered that there was none to uphold: Therefore, mine own arm brought &s;alvation unto me, and my fury it upheld me. And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their &s;trength to the earth."</P>
<P>The &s;ame thing is predicted in the &s;ixty &s;ixth chapter: "A voice of noi&s;e from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the Lord who rendereth recompence to his enemies. And the hand of the Lord &s;hall be known towards his &s;ervants, and his in|dignation
<PB N="133" REF="025635_0132_0FCEACDF531C2E70">towards his enemies. For behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his an|ger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. For by fire, and by his &s;word, will the Lord plead with all fle&s;h; and the &s;lain of the Lord &s;hall be many." The&s;e predictions of the &s;laughter and de&s;truction of the wicked, are here intermixed with promi&s;es of &s;alvation and pro&s;perity to the church: "Rejoice ye with Jeru|&s;alem, and be glad with her, all ye who love her: Rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her: That ye may &s;uck and be &s;atisfied with the brea&s;ts of her con&s;olations: That ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory. For thus &s;aith the Lord, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing &s;tream. And when ye fee this, your heart &s;hall rejoice, and your bones &s;hall flouri&s;h like an herb."</P>
<P>A pa&s;&s;age in the tenth chapter of Jeremiah, &s;eems to refer to the &s;ame event. The folly, idolatry, and great wickedne&s;s of the people and nations of the earth, is mentioned and de&s;cribed in the fir&s;t part of the chapter, upon which the following prediction is uttered: But JEHOVAH is the true God, he is the living God, and an everla&s;ting King: At his wrath the earth &s;hall tremble, and the nations &s;hall not be able to abide his indignation. Thus &s;hall ye &s;ay unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens, and the earth, even they &s;hall peri&s;h from the earth, and from un|der tho&s;e heavens."</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t part of the twenty fifth chapter, there is a prophecy of the captivity of the Jews, and of other adjacent nations, by Ne|buchadnezzar; and when their captivity during &s;eventy years &s;hould be ended, Jeremiah foretells the ruin of Babylon, and the land of the Chaldeans. And the evil that was coming on the nations of the earth, which &s;hould attend the de&s;truction of Ba|bylon, is repre&s;ented by ordering Jeremiah to take the wine cup of wrath, and cau&s;e all the nations of the earth to drink of it. And as the de&s;truction of ancient Babylon, and the judgments which came on many other nations, was an eminent type of yet greater and more remarkable de&s;truction of &s;piritual Babylon, and of all the nations of the earth, which will attend that, the prophecy is car|ried on beyond the type, and looks forward to the antitype, which is common in &s;cripture prophecy; and expre&s;&s;ions are u&s;ed which cannot be applied to the former, to the type, in their full extent
<PB N="134" REF="025635_0133_0FCEACE0898E9FF0">and meaning, but to the latter, the antitype, and therefore the prophecy is accompli&s;hed but in part, and in a lower degree in the former; but fully and mo&s;t completely in the latter: Therefore, the Prophet goes on, and u&s;es expre&s;&s;ions toward the clo&s;e of the prophecy, which refer chiefly to the battle in which antichri&s;t, and the nations of the earth will fall. Such are the following: "Therefore, prophe&s;y thou again&s;t them all tho&s;e words, and &s;ay unto them, The Lord &s;hall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he &s;hall mightily roar upon his habitation, he &s;hall give a &s;hout, as they that tread the grapes, a|gain&s;t all the inhabitants of the earth. A noi&s;e &s;hall come even to the ends of the earth: For the Lord hath a controver&s;y with the nations: He will plead with all fle&s;h, he will give them that are wicked to the &s;word, &s;aith the Lord. Thus &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts, Behold, evil &s;hall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind &s;hall be rai&s;ed up from the coa&s;ts of the earth.

<P>There is another prophecy of this in the thirtieth chapter of Jeremiah. Here the deliverance of the church from her oppre&s;&s;ors, and from all her &s;ufferings and trouble, is promi&s;ed; which &s;hall be attended with the utter overthrow and de&s;truction of the wick|ed, and all her enemies. That this prophecy looks beyond the deliverance of the Jews from the Babyloni&s;h captivity, and the evil that came on their enemies then, to the greater deliverance of the church from &s;piritual Babylon, and the general de&s;truction of the wicked which &s;hall attend it, of which the former was a type, is evident, not only from a number of expre&s;&s;ions and promi&s;es which were not &s;ully accompli&s;hed in the former, and have re|&s;pect to the latter; but from the expre&s;s promi&s;e, that God will rai&s;e up David their king to reign over them, by whom mu&s;t be
<PB N="135" REF="025635_0134_0FCEACE2177A96F0">meant Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Son of David, and of whom David was an eminent type. This will appear, by attending to the following pa&s;&s;ages: "Alas! For that day is great, &s;o that none is like it: It is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he &s;hall be delivered out of it. For it &s;hall come to pa&s;s in that day, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will bur&s;t thy bonds, and &s;trangers &s;hall no more &s;erve them&s;elves of him. But they &s;hall &s;erve the Lord their God, and David their king, whom I will rai&s;e up unto them. For I am with thee, &s;aith the Lord, to &s;ave thee. Though I make a full end of all nations whither I have &s;cattered thee, yet I will not make a full end of thee. Behold, a whirlwind of the Lord goeth forth with fury, a con|tinuing whrilwind, it &s;hall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked. The fierce anger of the Lord &s;hall not return, until he have done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: In the latter days ye &s;hall con&s;ider it."

<P>In the book of Daniel, there is prophecy of the &s;ame event. "And at that time," (i. e. when antichri&s;t is to be de&s;troyed, which is predicted in the paragraph immediately preceding the&s;e words) "&s;hall Michael &s;tand up, the great Prince who &s;tandeth for the children of thy people" (that is, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who will &s;up|port and deliver his church) "And there &s;hall be a time of trou|ble, &s;uch as never was fince there was a nation, even to that &s;ame time," (this is the time of the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ttle of that great day of God Almighty) "And at that time, thy people &s;hall be delivered, every one that &s;hall be found written in the book." This is the time of the deliverance of the church from the power of antichri&s;t, and from all wicked men, her enemies, and of her entering upon the pro&s;perous, happy &s;tate, in which the &s;aints will reign on earth a thou&s;and years.</P>
<P>The Prophet Joel &s;peaks of the &s;ame events. From the twenty eighth ver&s;e of the &s;econd chapter of his prophecy, is a prediction of the Millennium, and the preceding evils that &s;hall be inflicted on mankind: "And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s afterwards, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all fle&s;h," &amp;c. "This prophecy began to be fulfilled, when the Holy Spirit was fir&s;t poured out after the a&s;|cention of Chri&s;t; but this, as has been before ob&s;erved, was but the fir&s;t fruits, and the prophecy will be fulfilled only in a very &s;mall part, before the harve&s;t &s;hall come in the days of the Millennium.
<PB N="136" REF="025635_0135_0FCEACE44F1C1290">At the &s;ame time he &s;peaks of the great evils, and terrible events which &s;hall take place: "The &s;un &s;hall be turned into darkne&s;s, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come. And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that who&s;oever &s;hall call on the name of the Lord, &s;hall be delivered." The Prophet goes on in the next chapter to &s;peak more particularly on this &s;ubject: "For behold, in tho&s;e days and in that time, when I &s;hall bring a|gain the captivity of Judah, and Jeru&s;alem, I will al&s;o gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jeho&s;haphat, and will plead with them there for my people, and for my heritage I&s;rael, whom they have &s;cattered among the nations, and parted my land."</P>
<P>Judah and Jeru&s;alem are put for the church of Chri&s;t, being a type of that, as has been ob&s;erved. The captivity of the Jews in Babylon, and their return from it, is typical of the afflicted, &s;uffer|ing &s;tate of the church during the reign of antichri&s;t, and the de|liverance of it from this &s;tate on the fall of antichri&s;t, and in the Millennium. This is therefore meant, when it is &s;aid, "In tho&s;e days, and in that time, when I &s;hall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jeru&s;alem." When the children of Moab, Ammon, and Edom, came with a great army, combined together to de&s;troy Judah, Jeho&s;haphat was directed to go forth with the inhabitants of Judah and Jeru&s;alem and meet them; and had a promi&s;e that he &s;hould have no occa&s;ion to fight with them; but &s;hould &s;tand &s;till and &s;ee the &s;alvation of the Lord, becau&s;e the battle was not their's, but God's. Accordingly they went out, and &s;tood &s;till, and &s;aw their enemies fall upon, and de&s;troy each other, until they were all wa&s;ted away. Jeho&s;haphat and his people went out to their camp, and found great riches, &s;ilver and gold, and much &s;poil; and they &s;pent three days in gathering it&punc; and on the fourth day they a&s;&s;embled in the valley to ble&s;s and prai&s;e the Lord, which was from that called, "The valley of Berachah." This is the valley of Jeho&s;haphat. And to this &s;tory, the&s;e words of the Prophet Joel refer.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See 2 Chron. 20th Chapter.</NOTE> Moab, Ammon, and Edom, the enemies of I&s;rael, were a type of the enemies of the church and people of God, under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, among all nations. This battle and their de&s;truction of the enemies of Judah and Jeru&s;alem in the valley of Jeho&s;haphat, was a type of the overthrow of all the enemies of Chri&s;t and his church, when they &s;hall be gathered to the battle of
<PB N="137" REF="025635_0136_0FCEACE600B7C6E0">that great day of God Almighty. This prophecy therefore, is a prediction of the &s;ame event which is de&s;cribed in the &s;ixteenth chapter of the Revelation. Here it is &s;aid, "I will gather all na|tions, and will bring them down into the valley of Jeho&s;haphat, and will plead with them there for my people." That is, will puni&s;h and de&s;troy them for their oppo&s;ition to me and my church. There it is &s;aid, "The kings of the earth and of the whole world, were gathered to the battle of that great day. And he gathered them together to a place called in the Hebrew tongue, Armaged|don." Which pa&s;&s;age has been before explained.</P>
<P>The Prophet farther enlarges on this &s;ubject in the following part of this chapter:
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Verie 9, &amp;c.</NOTE> Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles: Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near, let them come up. Beat your plow&s;hares into &s;words, and your pruning hooks into &s;pears; let the weak &s;ay, I am &s;trong. A&s;&s;emble your&s;elves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather your&s;elves together round about: Thither cau&s;e thy migh|ty ones to come down, O Lord. Let the heathen be wakened and come up to the valley of Jeho&s;haphat; for there will I &s;it to judge all the heathen round about.

Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of deci&s;ion; for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of deci&s;ion. The &s;un and moon &s;hall be darkened, and the &s;tars &s;hall withdraw their &s;hining. The Lord &s;hall al&s;o roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jeru&s;alem, and the heavens and the earth &s;hall &s;hake; but the Lord will be the hope of his people, and the &s;trength of the children of I&s;rael." Every one who at|tends to this pa&s;&s;age, will ob&s;erve what a &s;triking &s;imilitude there is between this de&s;cription of a battle, and that in the Revelation, which has been con&s;idered. God is here repre&s;ented as fighting the battle again&s;t all the heathen, and de&s;troying multitudes on multitudes. All the heathen, even all nations are gathered toge|ther, all armed for war, and come up to the valley of Jeho&s;haphat, and there are cut off in this valley of deci&s;ion. In the Revelation all the nations of the earth are gathered together to battle at Megiddo, typifying the &s;ame thing with the valley of Jeho&s;haphat, and there they are &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ain. God ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> his mighty ones to come down. And John &s;ays, "I &s;aw heaven opened, and behold, a white hor&s;e:

And the armies in heaven followed him upon white hor&s;es." Here there is a command to "put in the fickle, for the harve&s;t is ripe: Come, get you down, for the pre&s;s is full, the fats overflow, for the wickedne&s;s is great." Much the &s;ame repre&s;entation is made of this battle in the Revelation,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. xiv. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &amp;c.</NOTE> which has been particularly mentioned already. The Prophet Joel goes on to the end of his prophecy de&s;cribing the happy &s;tate of the church, which &s;hall &s;ucceed this battle, which has never yet taken place, and is like other de&s;criptions of the Millennium &s;tate, by the Prophets. "Then &s;hall Jeru&s;alem be holy, and there &s;hall no &s;tranger pa&s;s through her any more.

<P>The Prophet Micah, prophe&s;ied of Chri&s;t and his kingdom, in the extent and glory of it in the latter day; and of the de&s;truction of the wicked men, and the nations of the world, in favour of the church of Chri&s;t, and in order to the pro&s;perity of his people.&mdash; All this is contained in the fifth chapter of his prophecy. "And He (i. e.

<P>The prophecy of Zephaniah has re&s;pect to the battle of that great day of God Almighty, and the &s;ucceeding happy and pro&s;|perous &s;tate of the church in the Millennium. It has indeed a primary re&s;pect to the evils and puni&s;hment brought upon Jeru|&s;alem and the Jews by the Chaldeans, for their apo&s;tacy and idol|atry;
<PB N="139" REF="025635_0138_0FCEACEA06BFF378">and to the calamities and de&s;truction which came upon the nations at that time, and previous to the re&s;toration of the Jews; and to their re&s;toration from their captivity, and return to their own land; which were types of the much greater and more im|portant events, in the la&s;t days, in which all nations will be more immediately concerned; and to which the prophecy has an ulti|mate and chief re&s;pect. It was fulfilled but in part, and in a &s;mall degree, in the former events; and will have the chief and com|plete accompli&s;hment in the latter; as has been before ob&s;erved concerning other prophecies of the &s;ame kind. Jeru&s;alem in her mo&s;t pure &s;tate, when the &s;tatutes and ordinances which God had pre&s;cribed, were in &s;ome good degree ob&s;erved, was a type of the true church of Chri&s;t. Therefore, under this name, and that of Mount Zion, and I&s;rael, the Prophets &s;peak of the true church in all future ages. But Jeru&s;alem, con&s;idered in her mo&s;t corrupt &s;tate of apo&s;tacy, was a type of the fal&s;e church of Rome, and of all chri&s;tian churches when they apo&s;tatize from the holy doctrines and precepts of the go&s;pel.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xi. 8.</NOTE> The nations round about the land of I&s;rael and Judea, and all tho&s;e who at times afflicted and oppre&s;&s;ed the vi&s;ible people of God, and were enemies to them; were types of the enemies of the church of Chri&s;t, in the time of her affliction; e&s;pecially of all the idolatrous nations and wicked men, who oppo&s;e the pro&s;|perity of the church, and are to be de&s;troyed, in order to her deliv|erance and &s;alvation. With the&s;e ob&s;ervations in view, this proph|ecy may be read, and the whole of it applied to the battle and events which will take place previous to the introduction of the Millennium, predicted in the Revelation, under the &s;eventh vial; and to the pro&s;perity of the church which will then commence. Then it will have its full accompli&s;hment; and many of the expre&s;&s;ions in it, con&s;idered in their mo&s;t natural and exten&s;ive meaning, cannot be accommodated to any events which have taken place, and are not yet fulfilled. Some of the&s;e will be now mentioned. The prophecy begins with the following words:&mdash;
<PB N="140" REF="025635_0139_0FCEACEB043E70E8">"I will utterly com&s;ume all things from off the land,

Hold thy peace at the pre&s;ence of the Lord God: For the day of the Lord is at hand: For the Lord hath prepared a &s;acrifice, he hath bid his gue&s;ts. The great day of the Lord is ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> it is near, and ha&s;teth greatly, even the voice of the day of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d. The mighty men &s;hall cry there bitterly. That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and di&s;tre&s;s, a day of wa&s;tene&s;s and de&s;olation, a day of darkne&s;s and gloomine&s;s, a day of clouds and thick darkne&s;s, a day of the trumpet and alarm again&s;t the &s;enced cities, and again&s;t the high towers. And I will bring di&s;tre&s;s upon men, that they &s;hall walk like blind men, be|cau&s;e they have &s;inned again&s;t the Lord: And their blood &s;hall be poured out as du&s;t, and their fle&s;h as dung. Neither their &s;il|ver, nor their gold, &s;hall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord's wrath; but the whole land (earth) &s;hall be devoured by the fire of his jealou&s;y: For he &s;hall make even a &s;peedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land (earth.) Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; &s;eek righteou&s;ne&s;s; &s;eek meekne&s;s: It may be ye &s;hall be hid in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay of the Lord's anger. Therefore, wait upon me, &s;aith the Lord, until the day that I ri&s;e up to the prey; for my determina|tion is to gather the nations, that I may a&s;&s;emble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, and all my fierce anger:&mdash; For all the earth &s;hall be devoured with the fire of my jealou&s;y." The parallel and likene&s;s between this prophecy, and that of the battle in the Revelation, is worthy of particular notice. This is called "The great day of the Lord: The day of the Lord's wrath: A day of di&s;ire&s;s and de&s;olation: The day that God will ri&s;e up to the prey, to <HI>gather</HI> the nations, and a&s;&s;emble the king|doms, to pour upon them his indignation, and fierce anger."&mdash; In the Revelation, the whole world were gathered to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. The words, THAT great day of battle, &s;eem to have reference to &s;ome day which had al|ready
<PB N="141" REF="025635_0140_0FCEACEC7A870070">been made known, and undoubtedly refer to the great day of God's wrath, which is mentioned in the prophecy before us, and by the other Prophets. "And he gathered them together into a place, called in the Hebrew tongue, Armageddon. And the &s;eventh angel poured out his vial (of wrath) into the air. And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, &s;uch as was not &s;ince men were upon the earth, &s;o mighty an earthquake and &s;o great.

In this prophecy it is &s;aid, "The Lord hath prepared a &s;acrifice, he hath bid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s gue&s;ts." In the Revelation the fowls of heaven are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ted to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to the &s;upper of the great God, to eat the fle&s;h of kings, &amp;c.</P>
<P>According to this Prophet, when the nations and kingdoms of the world have been gathered, and God has poured upon them his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">dignation, even all his herce anger; and all the earth &s;hall be devoured with the fire of his jealou&s;y, the &s;cene is changed, and the remnant which are left in the earth, the few afflicted and poor people, &s;hall repent and pray, and humble them&s;elves before God, and return and put their tru&s;t in him alone: And God will re|turn to them in a way of mercy, and build them up, and they &s;hall be comforted, rejoice and pro&s;per. This is repre&s;ented in the la&s;t chapter, from ver&s;e ninth to the end of the prophecy! "For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to &s;erve him with one con|&s;ent.

<P>FROM the above detail it appears, that the prophecy in the Re|velation of the Millennium, and of the manner in which it will be introduced, is agreeable to the ancient prophecies of the&s;e &s;ame e|vents: That previous to this, the chri&s;tian world, and mankind in general, will become more corrupt in the practice of all kinds of wickedne&s;s: That God will ri&s;e out of his place, and come forth to do his work, his &s;trange work, to puni&s;h the world for their
<PB N="144" REF="025635_0143_0FCEACF1C3B1FFC8">wickedne&s;s, and manife&s;t his high di&s;plea&s;ure and anger with man|kind, for their perver&s;ene&s;s and ob&s;tinacy in rebellion again&s;t him, and in oppo&s;ition to his church: That this is the battle of that great day of God Almighty, in which he will, by a cour&s;e of va|rious and multiplied calamities and fore judgments, greater and more general, and continued longer than any which have taken place before, reduce and de&s;troy mankind, &s;o that comparatively few will be left; an afflicted and poor people, who will repent and humble them&s;elves before God, and tru&s;t in the mighty Saviour; for whom he will appear in great mercy, and pour down the Holy Spirit on them and their offspring; and they will multiply and fill the world. And thus the kingdom and dominion, and the greatne&s;s of the kingdom under the whole heaven, &s;hall be given to the people of the &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High, and the church will reign on earth a thou&s;and years.</P>
<P>It appears rea&s;onable and proper, that God &s;hould manife&s;t his di&s;plea&s;ure with the inhabitants of Chri&s;tendom, and of the world, for their long continued abu&s;e of his goodne&s;s, and of all the means u&s;ed with them to reclaim them; and their per&s;everance in their oppo&s;ition to Chri&s;t and his people, and increa&s;ing in all kinds of wickedne&s;s, while he has been waiting upon them, even to long &s;uffering; by inflicting on them &s;evere and awful judgments, and remarkably fearful puni&s;hments, to vindicate the honour of his own name; and avenge his church and people, who have been &s;o greatly injured, de&s;pi&s;ed and trampled upon; and that it may be made known by this, as well as in other ways, that the God of chri&s;tians, the God and Saviour revealed in the Bible, is the true God. And this will give great in&s;truction to tho&s;e who &s;hall be left, who will have a heart to perceive and under&s;tand. They will have before their eyes a le&s;&s;on, &s;uited mo&s;t effectually to teach them the exceeding depravity and wickedne&s;s of man; and how real and dreadful is the divine di&s;plea&s;ure and anger with &s;inners: How undone and utterly lo&s;t forever, all men are, without a Redeemer and Sanctifier; by whom they may be recovered from the power of &s;in and &s;atan, and obtain the forgivene&s;s of their &s;ins, and the favour of God: How dependent they are on &s;overeign grace for all good, for every thing better than complete de&s;truction; by which alone they are di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e who per&s;evere in their &s;ins, and peri&s;h. And all this will tend to guard them again&s;t &s;in, to promote their repentance and humiliation, and to lead
<PB N="145" REF="025635_0144_0FCEACF39FEA8840">them to more earne&s;t, con&s;tant and united prayer to God for mer|cy, than was ever exerci&s;ed before by men: And to a&s;cribe all the favours they &s;hall receive, which will then be much more abun|dant than ever before, to the free, &s;overeign grace of God; and to give him the prai&s;e of all.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this &s;ection it was &s;ugge&s;ted, that by attend|ing to the events which are to take place, according to &s;cripture prophecy, before the commencement of the Millennium, farther evidence would come into view, that this will not be much &s;ooner or later, than the beginning of the &s;eventh millenary of the world. This evidence has been now produced. The &s;ixth vial is now running, and probably began to be poured out before the end of the la&s;t century, and will continue to run a con&s;iderable part of the next century; under which the power of antichri&s;t is to be greatly weakened, and the way prepared for his utter overthrow: And at the &s;ame time, the chri&s;tian world, and man|kind in general, will be &s;o far from reforming, that they will grow more and more corrupt in doctrine and practice, and greedily run into all manner of vice and wickedne&s;s, until they are prepared for the battle of that great day, and ripe to be cut down and de|&s;troyed, by a &s;eries of divine judgments, which will be inflicted under the &s;eventh vial, and will i&s;&s;ue in the introduction of the Millennium.</P>
<P>The river Euphrates has been drying up, and the way has been preparing, for near a century pa&s;t, for the utter ruin of the Pope and the hierarchy of the church of Rome, and the time of the utter overthrow of antichri&s;t appears to be ha&s;tening on. But this is not accompanied with any reformation in that church, or in the Greek church, or in the prote&s;tant churches in general: But very much to the contrary appears. Ignorance, error and delu&s;ion, and open vice and wickedne&s;s abound, and are increa&s;ing; and infidelity is rapidly &s;preading in the chri&s;tian world. The unclean &s;pirits, like frogs, appear to have gone forth to all the kings' courts, and the great men in Chri&s;tendom; and the greate&s;t corruption and abominable vices are &s;pread among them, and real chri&s;tianity is neglected, run down and oppo&s;ed. And the multitude in general, both learned and unlearned, are going the &s;ame way. Dei&s;m, and a multitude of errors which lead to it, and even to athei&s;m, are increa&s;ing. A &s;pirit of irreligion, &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s, pride and worldline&s;s, is exceeding &s;trong and prevalent, pro|ducing
<PB N="146" REF="025635_0145_0FCE9E51EEC58A90">all kinds of wickedne&s;s, and a &s;trong and general oppo&s;i|tion to true religion, and the great truths and doctrines of the go&s;|pel. And the healthen world are no more di&s;po&s;ed to become chri&s;tians, than they ever were: And the way to their conver&s;ion to chri&s;tianity appears to be more ob&s;tructed; and the few at|tempts that are made to chri&s;tianize any of them, are generally un&s;ucce&s;sful. And Mahometans and Jews hate and oppo&s;e chri&s;tianity as much as ever they did, if not more, and are &s;inking farther down in &s;tupidity, ignorance, infidelity, worldline&s;s, and all kinds of vice.</P>
<P>It is certain, that mo&s;t of the evil things now mentioned, have been found among the body of mankind, in a greater or le&s;s degree, in all ages; and the pious friends of God, and true religion, have complained of, and lamented them. And it is probable, that the repre&s;entation now made, will be con&s;idered by many, only as the revival of the old complaint, by tho&s;e who are of an illiberal, gloomy ca&s;t of mind, and wholly without foundation, in truth and fact. But this opinion, though it &s;hould be generally im|bibed, and a&s;&s;erted with great confidence, will not be any evidence that the repre&s;entation is not true and ju&s;t; but will rather &s;erve to confirm it. For it is commonly, if not always, the ca&s;e, that in times of great degeneracy, and the prevalence of ignorance, error and vice, they who are the greate&s;t in&s;tances of it, and mo&s;t &s;unk into darkne&s;s and delu&s;ion, are deluded in this al&s;o, and entertain a good opinion of them&s;elves, and of others who join with them, being ignorant of their true character. They put darkne&s;s for light, and light for darkne&s;s, and call evil good, and good evil. And while real chri&s;tianity and true virtue, founded upon principles of truth and genuine piety, are abandoned, oppo&s;ed and for&s;aken, they perceive it not, but think all is well, and much better than before. And they may undertake to <HI>reform chri&s;tianity,</HI> and think it is greatly reformed, when every doctrine and duty is excluded from it, which is contrary to the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, pride, and worldly &s;pirit of man, and little or nothing is left of it, but the mere name, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the religion of infidels or hea|then; and nothing to render it preferable to the&s;e.</P>
<P>An appeal mu&s;t be made, in this ca&s;e, from the judgment of tho&s;e of this character, to tho&s;e who are born of the Spirit of God; are created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works; by which they are become new creatures, and turned from the darkne&s;s of this world,
<PB N="147" REF="025635_0146_0FCEACF705D3F950">to marvellous light: Who are not conformed to this world, but have overcome it, and are transformed by the renewing of their minds, &s;o as to know and di&s;tingui&s;h what is that good and ac|ceptable and perfect will of God, which is revealed in the &s;crip|tures. They who are thus &s;piritual, judge of all things re&s;pecting the doctrines and duties of chri&s;tianity, in &s;ome good mea&s;ure, according to the truth. To &s;uch, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of them who have a general knowledge of the &s;tate of religion in the chri&s;tian world, and of the deluge of ignorance, error and vice with which it is overflowed, it is pre&s;umed, the above de&s;cription will not ap|pear exaggerated, and that there are greater &s;trides, and &s;wifter progre&s;s made in infidelity, and irreligion, error and fal&s;e religon, in vice and all kinds of wickedne&s;s, than have been ever known before; and that all the&s;e are more common, have a wider &s;pread, and are carried to a higher degree at this time, than in former ages; and threaten to bear down all truth, and real chri&s;tianity before them: And that the appearance of things, in this re&s;pect, is ju&s;t &s;uch as might be rea&s;onably expected when the unclean &s;pirits like frogs, the &s;pirits of devils, are gone forth with a licen&s;e and de&s;ign to &s;pread their influence among men, and deceive and corrupt the whole world.</P>
<P>There is rea&s;on to conclude, from what has already taken place of this kind, and from the prophecy of the&s;e unclean &s;pirits, that they have not yet fini&s;hed their work; but that the world, e&s;pe|cially that part of it called chri&s;tian and prote&s;tant, will yet make greater and more rapid advances, in all kinds of moral corruption, and open wickedne&s;s, till it will come to that &s;tate in which it will be fully ripe, and prepared to be cut down by the fickle of divine ju&s;tice and wrath: And it may take near half a century from this time for the&s;e evil &s;pirits to complete their work, and gather the world to this battle. But during this time, whether it be longer or &s;horter, and before the battle &s;hall come on, there will probably be great and remarkable judgments, and fore, unu&s;ual and &s;ur|pri&s;ing calamities, in one place and another, &s;uited to awaken and warn mankind, and lead them to fear God, repent and re|form; which being by mo&s;t di&s;regarded and abu&s;ed, will become the occa&s;ion of greater hardne&s;s of heart and ob&s;tinacy, which will be a prelude and provocation to the battle of that great day, in which mankind will be de&s;troyed in the manner, and to the degree, which has been de&s;cribed above. This battle, as has been before
<PB N="148" REF="025635_0147_0FCEACF884D61150">ob&s;erved, will not be fought and fini&s;hed at once; but by a &s;eries of different and increa&s;ing calamities and &s;ore puni&s;hments, man|kind will be reduced and brought down, and every high thing levelled to the ground, in which the hand of God will be remark|ably vi&s;ible, and his arm of power and vengeance made bare.&mdash; And it may take more than a century to effect all this, in the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t manner; &s;o that it will not be fini&s;hed till near the beginning of the &s;eventh millenary of the world.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that while antichri&s;t is coming down, and the way preparing for the utter extinction of the church of Rome, and all her appendages, the world in general, and e&s;pecially the chri&s;tian world, will make &s;wift advances in delu&s;ion and all kinds of wickedne&s;s; and infidelity will make great progre&s;s, under the influence of the &s;pirits of devils, which are gone forth to the whole world. And it may be here ob&s;erved, that the increa&s;e and &s;pread|ing of this wickedne&s;s, and &s;pirit of infidelity, will doubtle&s;s be the means or weakening and preparing the way for the overthrow of that church. The ten horns, or kings, which &s;hall hate the whore, and make her de&s;olate and naked, and eat her fle&s;h, and burn her with fire, will do this from a &s;elfi&s;h, worldly &s;pirit, and under the influence of infidelity, and oppo&s;ition to all kinds of religion. And the prevalence of dei&s;m and athei&s;m in popi&s;h countries and nations, which are the natural fruit and offspring of the abomina|ble practices and tyranny of the antichri&s;tian church, has been the means of expo&s;ing the &s;uper&s;tition and wickedne&s;s of that church, and weakening the papal hierarchy. And dei&s;ts, and other wicked men, may be made the in&s;truments of pulling down that anti|chri&s;tian fabrick yet farther; as the heathen Romans were of de&s;troying the corrupt church of I&s;rael. If &s;o, the fall of the Pope will be &s;o far from implying a revival of true religion; that it may be attended with the contrary, viz. infidelity, immorality, and all kinds of wickedne&s;s, as the means of it, &s;o far as it will be effected by the in&s;trumentality of men.</P>

4. As to the di&s;tance of that happy day of &s;alvation from this time; two hundred years, or near &s;o many, will pa&s;s off before it will arrive, according to the calculation which has been made from &s;cripture; &s;o that none, now on the &s;tage of life, will live to &s;ee and enjoy it on earth. But much may be done by chri&s;tians who live in this age, to promote its coming on in the proper time, by prayer, and promoting the intere&s;t of religion, and the conver&s;ion of &s;inners: For that good day would not come, unle&s;s the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t be maintained to that time, and &s;inners be converted to keep up the church, and prevent the total extinction of it. In order to this, thou&s;ands mu&s;t be converted, and there mu&s;t be a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of profe&s;&s;ing and real chri&s;tians down to that day. The doctrines, in&s;titutions, and duties of chri&s;tianity, mu&s;t be main|tained; and there will doubtle&s;s be remarkable revivals of religion in many places, and knowledge will increa&s;e among true chri&s;tians, and there will be advances made in the purity of doctrines and wor&s;hip, and all holy practice, by bringing all the&s;e nearer to the &s;tandard of the holy &s;criptures: And the churches will be formed into a greater union with each other; being more and more con|formed to the divine pattern, contained in the Bible. Here then is work enough to do, by tho&s;e who de&s;ire and are looking for &s;uch a day, to prepare the way for it, and it may be introduced in the proper time; and there is no want of encouragement to do it, even in this view, to be &s;tedfa&s;t and unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as they may know, that their labour will not be in vain in the Lord.

<P>And chri&s;tians may now have a great degree of enjoyment of that day, and joy in it, though they do not expect to live on earth till it &s;hall come. True chri&s;tians are di&s;intere&s;ted and benevo|lent to &s;uch a degree, that they can enjoy and rejoice in the good of others, even tho&s;e who may live many ages hence, and in the good and pro&s;perity of the church, and the advancement of the cau&s;e and kingdom of Chri&s;t in this world, though they &s;hould not live to &s;ee it. The &s;tronger their faith is, that this good day is coming, and the clearer and more con&s;tant view they have of it, and the more de&s;irable it appears to them, that there &s;hould be &s;uch a time; the higher enjoyment, and greater joy they will have in it, and in the pro&s;pect of it. Thus Abraham looked forward by his faith, and &s;aw this day of Chri&s;t, when all the nations of the

In this &s;en&s;e, Chri&s;t will come <HI>quickly</HI> to &s;et up his kingdom in the whole world. He is on his way, coming as fa&s;t and as &s;oon as he can, con&s;i&s;tent with infinite wi&s;dom.

<P>It is farther to be ob&s;erved, that though the chri&s;tians who live at this day, will not &s;ee the Millennium come while they are in the body on earth; yet they will &s;ee and enjoy it, when it &s;hall come, in a much higher degree than they could do, were they living on earth; or than tho&s;e who will live on earth at that day. The powers, knowledge and views of the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t made perfect, are greatly enlarged in heaven, and they have a more clear and comprehen&s;ive view of the works of God, and a more particu|lar knowledge of what is done in this world, e&s;pecially of what relates to the work of redemption, the &s;alvation of &s;inners, and the pro&s;perity of the church and cau&s;e of Chri&s;t. There is joy in the pre&s;ence of the angels over <HI>one &s;inner</HI> that repenteth. The &s;pirits of the ju&s;t made perfect are with the angels, and mu&s;t know all that pa&s;&s;es in their pre&s;ence; and mu&s;t rejoice in &s;uch an event, as much or more than they. How great mu&s;t be their joy then, when whole nations, yea, all the world, become true penitents, and they &s;ee and know this, and what is implied in it, un&s;peaka|bly to better advantage, and more clearly, than any can do who &s;hall be then on earth!</P>
<P>The more chri&s;tians labour and &s;uffer on earth, in the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t; and the more they de&s;ire, pray for, and promote his com|ing and kingdom in this world, the more they will enjoy it in heaven, when it &s;hall take place, and the greater will be their joy
<PB N="154" REF="025635_0153_0FCEAD030DB166D0">and happine&s;s. And it will be un&s;peakably more and greater in heaven, than if they were in bodies on earth. Who then can rea&s;onably de&s;ire to live in this world, merely to &s;ee and enjoy the happy day of the Millennium.</P>
<P>ON the whole, it is hoped that it does appear from what has been &s;aid in this di&s;&s;ertation, that there will be a thou&s;and years of pro&s;perity of the church of Chri&s;t, in this world; that this is abundantly foretold and held up to view in the Bible; that this will be about the &s;eventh millenary of the world; that it will be a mo&s;t happy and glorious day, in which the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation &s;hall have its proper and full effect on earth, in the &s;alvation of men; to which all the preceding times and events are preparatory: That the degeneracy and increa&s;ing prevalence of ignorance, error and wickedne&s;s now in the world, e&s;pecially in Chri&s;tendom, is preparing for, and ha&s;tening on the battle of that great day of God Almighty, in which mankind will be puni&s;hed, and the great|e&s;t part then on earth de&s;troyed; and then the Millennium will be introduced:&mdash;That this is an important and plea&s;ing &s;ubject, &s;uited to &s;upport and comfort chri&s;tians in all the dark and evil days which precede it, and to excite them to earne&s;t, con&s;tant, united prayer for this coming of Chri&s;t, and patient waiting for him, and to con&s;tant exertions in all proper ways, to promote his intere&s;t and kingdom in the world.</P>

That man &s;hould apo&s;tatize, and &s;o &s;oon arrive to &s;uch a high degree of wickedne&s;s, after all the light and holine&s;s, and the wonderful goodne&s;s of God to man, di&s;played in the Millennium; and, in oppo&s;ition to all this light and grace, and in the greate&s;t abu&s;e of it, join in rebellion again&s;t God, and trample on his authority, truth and goodne&s;s, contrary to the ad|monitions and warnings from the word of God, and all faithful mini&s;ters and chri&s;tians; will make a new di&s;covery, and greater than was ever made before, of fallen human nature, and of the great and de&s;perate evil that is in the heart of man; and that it is utterly incurable by any means that can po&s;&s;ibly be u&s;ed, &s;hort of the almighty energy of the Spirit of God, by which the heart is renewed; and con&s;equently of the guilt and infinite ill de&s;ert of man; which di&s;covery will be of great advantage to the church and kingdom of Chri&s;t forever, and nece&s;&s;ary for the greate&s;t hap|pine&s;s and glory of it, and the highe&s;t honour of the Redeemer.</P>
<P>And this will make, from fact, a new and greater di&s;covery of the ab&s;olute dependence of man on the grace and Spirit of God, to prevent his greate&s;t wickedne&s;s and endle&s;s de&s;truction, and to form him to holine&s;s and happine&s;s; and of the great and &s;over|eign grace of God, in converting and &s;aving lo&s;t man, and in bringing on &s;uch a wonderful degree of holine&s;s and happine&s;s, and continuing it a thou&s;and years; and that this is all to be a&s;|cribed to the &s;overeign power and grace of God, who has mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.
<PB N="158" REF="025635_0157_0FCEAD08F9C8B598">When all men &s;hall be righteous and holy from generation to generation for a thou&s;and years, and all the children which &s;hall be born in that time, &s;hall appear to be pious and holy as &s;oon as they begin to act, and per&s;evere in this to the end of life, the ap|pearance will be, that mankind are now grown better, and that the evil nature of man is not &s;o great; but he is naturally in|clined to obedience and holine&s;s: The &s;udden and great apo&s;tacy which will take place, will take off this appearance; and &s;how, that the heart of man is naturally as full of evil as ever it was; and that all the good and holine&s;s of the Millennium &s;tate, was the effect of the power of the Spirit of God, and to be wholly a&s;cribed to the infinite, &s;overeign grace of God. And this di&s;covery will be remembered by the redeemed forever, and improved to the glory of God, to the prai&s;e of rich, &s;overeign grace, and con&s;e|quently to their own eternal advantage.</P>
