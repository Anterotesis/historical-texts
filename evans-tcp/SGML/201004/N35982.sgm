<P>HISTORY no where informs us of any event &s;o extraordi|nary as the late revolution in France.&mdash;If viewed on all &s;ides, with its attending circum&s;tances, by an attentive and unprejudiced eye, it mu&s;t &s;urely excite the greate&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment; and tho&s;e who have been u&s;ed to unite in their mind; the providence of God with human occurrences, (whether they approve of this great change of things or not) cannot help inquiring, <HI>Is this from men, or is it from God?</HI> Is it one of tho&s;e commotions produced by the con|flicting pa&s;&s;ions of men, that ri&s;e and &s;ink, and are &s;oon forgot|ten? or is it one of tho&s;e events which mark the great eras of time, and from which originate now orders of things?&mdash;If the latter, it is undoubtedly the theme of prophecy.</P>
<P>Appearances indicate that this will be a fatal &s;troke to the pa|pal u&s;urpations, and the reign of de&s;poti&s;m. Tho&s;e prophecies therefore which direct our hopes to that intere&s;ting period, when all antichri&s;tian tyrannies are to peri&s;h, de&s;erve at this time, pe|culiar attention. But where &s;hall we find a clue to guide us in our inquiries? The author of the following thoughts con&s;ulted commentators the mo&s;t generally approved, on the prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation of John. He &s;ound much to edify and to excite curio&s;ity, but was &s;till in the mid&s;t of a wilderne&s;s. At length he was determined to commit him&s;elf to his own inve&s;tiga|tions, and explore the&s;e regions of wonders, without placing im|plicit confidence in any guide. Circum&s;tances led him to conjec|ture, that the bea&s;t which John &s;aw coming up out of the earth was <HI>Lewis the Fourteenth,</HI> or the French tyranny, perfected by him; and that it was this bea&s;t which &s;lew the witne&s;&s;es. This is the clue which he has followed, and he thinks it is that by which the mazes of the&s;e wonderful vi&s;ions, at lea&s;t as far as they have been accompli&s;hed, may be traced with preci&s;ion, and &s;ome things, which are yet to come, be conjectured with great advantage. But without this to guide us, all is confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>A &s;erious application to the &s;tudy of the prophecies, and an at|tentive ob&s;ervation of the &s;igns of the times, have produced in my mind the &s;tronge&s;t per&s;ua&s;ion that the utter downfal of the papacy, the final overthrow of de&s;poti&s;m, the re&s;ioration of the Jews and
<PB REF="046985_0003_10228961282DA500">the renovation of all things, are near at hand; and that every year will a&s;toni&s;h us with new wonders. <HI>"As the days of Noe were, &s;o &s;hall al&s;o the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days that were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, and marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away, &s;o &s;hall al&s;o the com|ing of the Son of Man be."</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxiv. 37, 39.</NOTE> From this per&s;ua&s;ion ari&s;es the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of calling the attention of mankind, with pecu|liar earne&s;tne&s;s to the things which belong to their peace. <HI>"Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and &s;ound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand."</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Joel ii. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>I know what an author, who writes on &s;ubjects like the&s;e, has to expect. But my heart tells me, that I publi&s;h the&s;e thoughts with the pure&s;t intentions, and that my only aims are to &s;erve the intere&s;ts of Chri&s;tianity, to promote the welfare of my coun|trymen and the common cau&s;e of humanity, by inviting men to con&s;ider <HI>the &s;igns of the times;</HI> that, as <HI>individuals</HI> and as a <HI>na|tion,</HI> we may examine our ways; <HI>repent</HI> and <HI>reform,</HI> and that thus the divine di&s;plea&s;ure may be averted, and <HI>that</HI> con&s;titution, which has &s;ecured to this empire, &s;o many ble&s;&s;ings, to which mo&s;t other nations are &s;trangers, may be purified and &s;trengthened, and by the&s;e means be continued to our po&s;terity. I do therefore mo&s;t fervently pray that God may &s;ucceed this feeble attempt, and ble&s;s <HI>us,</HI> and <HI>all men</HI> with peace.</P>

<HEAD>PREVIOUS THOUGHTS.</HEAD>
<P>THE kingdom which God was to &s;et up under the Me&s;&s;iah, according to the prophets, was to be a kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s, peace and joy. <HI>"Unto us a child is born&mdash;the government &s;hall be up|on his &s;houlder&mdash;Of the increa&s;e of his government and peace there &s;hall be no end.&mdash;The wolf and the lamb &s;hall feed together. He &s;hall &s;peak peace to the heathen,"</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. ix. 6 and 7.</NOTE> who have long been the prey of de&s;troyers, and of one another. If we contemplate the principles of the kingdom of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they promi&s;e fair to produce the enjoy|ment of all that which the prophets predicted. But where is the effect? The annals of the Chri&s;tian world, as well as tho&s;e of the pagan, di&s;cover to us little more than the hi&s;tory of ambition, &s;uper&s;tition, and blood&s;hed. The career of this kingdom began in piety towards God, and in love and peace to all mankind. But &s;y&s;tems of error, &s;uper&s;tition, and oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;oon interrupt|ed its progre&s;s, and perverted its principles. Chri&s;tianity has been converted into a &s;y&s;tem of commerce, and tho&s;e called the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, have been a corporation of traders, in the &s;ouls and liberties of mankind.</P>
<P>Were I to attempt to define the character of <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> I &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>It is all that which oppo&s;es it&s;elf to the kingdom of Chri&s;t, whether it flow from the eccle&s;ia&s;tical or civil powers.</HI> The civil con&s;titutions of nations, as well as the eccle&s;ia&s;tical, &s;o far as they accord with or have a tendency to promote that pride and that ambition which lead to oppre&s;&s;ion, per&s;ecution, and war, are antichri&s;tian. What|ever in religion is de&s;tructive of union among Chri&s;tians, which leads to domination over con&s;cience, to hinder free enquiry after truth, or any way oppre&s;&s;es and per&s;ecutes men for matters cogni|zable only by God; is antichri&s;tian. Wherever there is intole|rance, &mdash;wherever we find conditions of communion among Chri&s;|tians impo&s;ed, which Chri&s;t hath not clearly enjoined; where&s;o|ever creeds and modes of wor&s;hip are enforced by human power; wherever men are made to forfeit any of their civil rights, or are &s;tigmatized, on account of their religious creeds; in what ca&s;e &s;o|ever one Chri&s;tian, or &s;ect of Chri&s;tians, a&s;&s;umes the &s;eat of au|thority and judgment in the church of Chri&s;t; whether they call for fire to de&s;troy tho&s;e who different from them, or only exclude them from their communion and affection, there is a portion of that &s;pirit
<PB N="2" REF="046985_0005_10228965697989D8">of Antichri&s;t which has &s;o long oppo&s;ed it&s;elf to the benign principles of the kingdom of the Prince of Peace. To this &s;ource it may be ea&s;y to trace innumerable evils, nor can it be doubted but that this has been the occa&s;ion of making the incon&s;iderate e&s;teem the ami|able religion of Je&s;us, as a &s;ource of mi&s;chief in&s;tead of benevo|lence! Alas, how much of this &s;pirit remains among&s;t us all! How few have learned that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. vii. 19.</NOTE> <HI>in Je&s;us Chri&s;t circumci&s;ion is nothing, and un|circumci&s;ion is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</HI></P>
<P>But we are a&s;&s;ured from the &s;criptures, that all the&s;e u&s;urpations and antichri&s;tian principles &s;hall have an end; and that the go&s;pel &s;hall produce the various happy effects which are predicted. The religion of Chri&s;tians &s;hall then no longer con&s;i&s;t in<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiv. 17.</NOTE> <HI>meat</HI> and <HI>drink, but in righteou&s;ne&s;s, peace and joy;</HI> the practice of <HI>ju&s;tice;</HI> the cultivation of <HI>harmony,</HI> and the diffu&s;ion of <HI>happine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>The que&s;tion is, When may we hope to &s;ee the&s;e predictions accompli&s;hed? Long have a pious few had their eyes fixed on the promi&s;es of God, with ardent expectation, and been crying, <HI>"How long, O Lord, ere thou wilt avenge the blood of thy &s;aints, and create J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ru|&s;alem a quiet dwelling place, and Zion the joy of all the earth! Come Lord Je&s;us, come quickly!&mdash;Behold I come at an hour when ye think not! ble&s;&s;ed is he that watcheth."</HI></P>
<P>Some &s;uppo&s;e, that in vain are our enquiries about the time of the accompli&s;hment of the predictions relative to the downfal of Antichri&s;t, which is to prepare the way for the peaceful kingdom of the Redeemer. If &s;o, wherefore is it &s;aid, <HI>"Ble&s;&s;ed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy?"</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. i. 3.</NOTE> <HI>"Here is wi&s;dom, let him that hath under&s;tanding count the number of the bea&s;t."</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">xiii. 8.</NOTE> Though the meaning of the prophecies is nece&s;&s;arily wrapt up in modes of expre&s;&s;ion not ea&s;ily to be under&s;tood, as they would otherwi&s;e operate again&s;t their own accompli&s;hment; yet they may not be ab&s;olutely in&s;crutable; and e&s;pecially when their accom|pli&s;hment approaches nearer, and increa&s;ing light is ca&s;t upon them by the ari&s;ing of circum&s;tances connected with them, which &s;eems in Dan. xii. and 9, to be predicted.</P>
<P>Much has my mind been of late affected with the appearan|ces of things in the Chri&s;tian world, and with the occurrences which have, within the&s;e few years, bur&s;t upon us.&mdash;Occur|rences which are unparalleled in the hi&s;tory of nations.</P>
<P>In America a revolution has taken place which is &s;ingular in its con&s;equences, and e&s;pecially as they concern the &s;tate of religion. We have long been told that if the Chri&s;tian religi|on were left unprotected by e&s;tabli&s;hments, and un&s;upported by emoluments, it would &s;oon be borne down, and all its &s;olemni|ties for&s;aken and de&s;pi&s;ed. The experiment has now been made,
<PB N="3" REF="046985_0006_1022896A04A81F98">and fact demon&s;trates the fallacy of &s;uch conclu&s;ions. The people are ea&s;ed of a heavy burden, and pure and undefiled re|ligion flouri&s;hes more than ever. Hirelings have withdrawn, but piety and virtue, charity and union increa&s;e. But a few years after this grand event, one of the fir&s;t nations in Europe, long en&s;laved, and blinded by &s;uper&s;tition, at once broke its chains, and tore away the bandages with which popi&s;h prie&s;ts had bound the eyes of the multitude. Civil liberty had long been forgotten, and for more than a hundred years, no liberty of con&s;cience was permitted to the in&s;ulted people. And as a nation, they had for ages been made, by their tyrants, the &s;courge of all their neighbours. This people have, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the whole civilized world, aro&s;e up as in one day, and, in oppo&s;ition to the combined power of their king, their prie&s;ts, and nobles, have dared to &s;ay, <HI>We will be free&mdash;We will have ju&s;t and equal laws&mdash;No man &s;hall puni&s;h&mdash;No man &s;hall be puni&s;hed but as the law commands&mdash;The poor no le&s;s than the rich, &s;hall be protected&mdash;Con&s;cience is the property of God, and every man &s;hall wor&s;hip his Maker as he plea|&s;es &mdash;We will never make war, but in &s;elf-defence, and will embrace all men as our brethren.</HI> And this was not the re&s;olution of a few, it was the &s;olemn covenant of twenty-&s;ix millions of people. What a phaenomenon in the hi&s;tory of man! What an epoch in the hi&s;tory of the church! But de&s;pots and their creatures, who&s;e exi&s;tence depends on the ignorance and &s;ervility of man|kind, fearing the influence of &s;uch an example, have been ex|erting all their power to cru&s;h this ri&s;ing &s;pirit of liberty, and to &s;upport the falling papacy. But by who&s;e hand was it, let me a&s;k, that they and their remnant were driven back with lo&s;s and &s;hame? By His, who maketh <HI>the wrath of man to prai&s;e him.</HI> &mdash;Alas! the calamities which oppo&s;ition to the mo&s;t benevo|lent &s;entiments has occa&s;ioned! The pa&s;&s;ions of men have been enraged, and in the paroxi&s;m of re&s;entment fear and de&s;pair, the be&s;t of cau&s;es, the cau&s;e of liberty, has been &s;tained by the com|mi&s;&s;ion of crimes which afflict a great majority of their own na|tion, and all the genuine friends of liberty and ju&s;tice through|out the world. Who can contemplate them but with the keene&s;t angui&s;h, tho&s;e only excepted who are watching for occa&s;ions to &s;lander all who re&s;i&s;t oppre&s;&s;ors? The circum&s;tances of this won|derful revolution, mark it as an event of va&s;t importance, and as probably big with con&s;equences beyond all conjecture.</P>
<P>The prophecies re&s;pecting the downfal of the Antichri&s;tian a&s;urpations, mu&s;t have their accompli&s;hment in &s;ome era, it may be the pre&s;ent. It is therefore &s;urely worth our while to enquire how far the predictions of God's word will agree with the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of known events.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="046985_0007_1022896C6E72CAF8">
Thus it has appeared to me, and the more I have examined and thought upon the &s;ubject, the more clearly do I &s;eem to di&s;|cern that the la&s;t days &s;poken of by God's &s;ervants the prophets, are fa&s;t approaching; <HI>"when Babylon the great &s;hall come in remen|brance, and God will avenge the blood of his &s;aints, and the kingdoms of this world &s;hall become the kingdoms of the Lord and of his Chri&s;t;"</HI> by not only profe&s;&s;ing the religion of Je&s;us, but acting under its influence and copying after <HI>his</HI> example who was meek and lowly in heart, and who came "not to de&s;troy men's lives but to &s;ave them."&mdash;Not a kingdom of anarchy, but a &s;tate of things, in which the governors and the governed, and all the different ranks in &s;ociety will unite to promote the general good. It is not impo&s;&s;i|ble that the pre&s;ent &s;haking of nations &s;hould bring about this de&s;irable event. Some however object that the progre&s;s of the French revolution has been marked with too much outrage and blood; and that the per&s;ons engaged in it are of a character too bad to admit it to be from God,&mdash;a work which he approves, and which he intends, as the introduction to tho&s;e happy days of which the prophets have &s;poken. But granting that the leaders in the French revolution have been as atrociou&s;ly wicked as repre|&s;ented, this does not in the &s;lighte&s;t degree, affect our hypothe|&s;is. What was <HI>Henry the Eighth,</HI> who began our reformation? A mon&s;ter! What were his motives? the gratifications of his lu&s;ts. What were the means which he employed.&mdash;How blind is man! We only know that in God dwell the attributes of wi&s;dom, ju&s;|tice and goodne&s;s, but we are incapable of tracing the &s;phere of their operations. He &s;aw fit to make u&s;e of the Jewi&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers, and to direct the wor&s;t of human pa&s;&s;ions, for the purpo&s;e of ef|fecting our redemption, by the death of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Are e&s;ta|bli&s;hed &s;y&s;tems of &s;uper&s;itition and tyranny to be overthrown by a few &s;mooth words of benevolence and wi&s;dom? Happy if they could! Are the dragon and the bea&s;ts, which have &s;o depopula|ted the earth for ages, to peri&s;h without convul&s;ion? Read,&mdash;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xvi. 6.</NOTE> <HI>"They have &s;hed the blood of &s;aints and prophets, and thou ha&s;t given them blood to drink for they are worthy."</HI> When this period &s;hall ar|rive there will be much work to do, for the execution of which the meek of the earth are by no means qualified. To cen&s;ure di&s;order, to &s;hudder at blood&s;hed, and to practi&s;e mercy, is our duty; for neither God's &s;ecret coun&s;els, nor his providential judgments, are to be the rule of our conduct. We know who hath &s;aid, <HI>"Love your enemies, and do good to them that hate you."</HI> This is our rule.</P>
<P>The French revolution then may be of God, and de&s;igned to i&s;&s;ue in good, although di&s;graced by outrages which nothing can ju&s;tify.</P>

<PB N="5" REF="046985_0008_1022896E2D0836A8">
<HEAD>FIRST INQUIRY.</HEAD>
<P>IN endeavouring to make good this hypothe&s;is, that <HI>the &s;igns of the times</HI> indicate the &s;peedy downfal of all that &s;piritual and civil tyranny, which for &s;o many ages, has prevailed in oppo&s;ition to the principles of the kingdom of Chri&s;t, the Prince of Peace, there are three Inquiries which claim our attention.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t re&s;pects the <HI>dragon</HI> and the <HI>bea&s;ts,</HI> which John &s;aw in his vi&s;ions. Rev. xi. 7. xii. and xiii.</P>
<P>The &s;econd re&s;pects the <HI>witne&s;&s;es,</HI> Rev. xi. and the third Inqui|ry is, Whether all the numbers of <HI>Daniel</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> which refer to the latter days, will agree with the pre&s;ent times? Let us, with that reverence and devout candor which become us when we ap|ply to the word of God for in&s;truction, attend to the&s;e &s;everal Inquiries.</P>
<P>The grand &s;cene of the prophetic vi&s;ion of John opens in the <HI>fourth chapter</HI> of the <HI>Revelations,</HI> and is continued to the end of the book. The whole may be con&s;idered as a number of &s;cenic pic|tures. <HI>Chapter the eleventh</HI> is a miniature picture of the hi&s;tory of the church from the earlie&s;t times to the downfal of all antichri&s;|tian u&s;urpations. The following vi&s;ions are the &s;ame picture vari|egated, for our in&s;truction, on a larger &s;cale.</P>
<P>Let us con&s;ider the vi&s;ions in the twelfth and thirteenth chap|ters, and e&s;pecially the vi&s;ion of the &s;econd bea&s;t, chap. xiii. and 11. for, if the&s;e be under&s;tood, we &s;hall have a key to unlock, not only the my&s;teries of the eleventh chapter, but of many oth|ers which follow. Chapter xii. 3. <HI>"And there appeared another wonder in heaven, and behold, a great red dragon, having &s;even heads and ten horns, and &s;even crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the &s;tars of heaven, and did ca&s;t them to the earth,"</HI> &amp;c. Mo&s;t of the authors whom I have con&s;ulted, though they allow this chapter to contain a repre&s;entation of the per&s;ecutions of Pa|gan Rome, yet have &s;trangely &s;piritualized this dragon, &s;o that whil&s;t we are cautioned of our danger from invi&s;ible &s;pirits, the true object is forgotten, and we beat the air.</P>
<P>There can be no doubt, but the devil is a principal agent in all tyrannies, eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil; but what is here repre&s;ented by the mo&s;t terrifie imagery appears to be no other than that cruel ci|vil tyranny of the Romans, which ca&s;t down all the powers, and &s;wept away all the remains of liberty in Europe, the then &s;uppo&s;ed third part of the world; and which, while the imperial head remained in full power, per&s;ecuted with unrelenting cruelty, the church of Chri&s;t in its infancy; and under all the de&s;potims
<PB N="6" REF="046985_0009_1022896FDD08CCE0">which have ari&s;en from it, has more or le&s;s, continued to oppo&s;e the kingdom of Chri&s;t. This dragon, therefore, repre&s;ents the civil tyranny exerci&s;ed by the Roman Emperors, and by their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors in the &s;everal kingdoms which have ari&s;en out of the ruins of that empire; and &s;pecially by tho&s;e who are now called the <HI>Em|perors of Germany,</HI> who profe&s;s, more immediately, to &s;ucceed the de&s;pots of ancient Rome. While the fir&s;t bea&s;t, in the next chap|ter, is the repre&s;entation of <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> or <HI>&s;piritual</HI> tyranny, this dragon repre&s;ents <HI>civil</HI> tyranny. They have the &s;ame origin, and their juri&s;diction is alike exten&s;ive, and hence they both appear with &s;even heads and ten horns. This dragon, we &s;hall find, gave to the bea&s;t his power and his &s;eat, and great authority; but he &s;till continued, and although wounded, remains to this day, nor has he ever cea&s;ed to practi&s;e de&s;truction. All the world have wor|&s;hipped <HI>him</HI> that gave power unto the bea&s;t; yea, &s;o ba&s;e and &s;er|vile have men been, that they have paid divine homage and pa&s;&s;ive obedience to their de&s;troyer, and have &s;aid, in the fulne&s;s of their folly, not only of &s;piritual tyranny, Who is like unto the bea&s;t! but of civil de&s;poti&s;m, Who is like unto the dragon!</P>

<P>It was to be the <HI>number of the name</HI> of the bea&s;t, and the <HI>number of a man,</HI> or of a man's name.</P>
<P>Although &s;o much &s;tre&s;s is not, perhaps, to be laid upon the following way of calculating this number of the &s;econd bea&s;t, yet it is worth taking notice of; and po&s;&s;ibly the Holy Spirit might point out that, by a remarkable providence, a twofold way of counting this number &s;hould be afforded, that thus the identity of the per&s;on and tyranny, might be a&s;certained with the greater evi|dence. Of this I &s;hall &s;ay nothing, but leave every one to his own judgment. The fir&s;t way of calculating a&s;certains <HI>the name of the man</HI> who &s;hould bring the tyranny to perfection, the follow|ing,
<PB N="13" REF="046985_0016_10228985508AC590">the <HI>length of time</HI> it &s;hould be in perfecting; &s;ince the ance&s;|tors of that man began it. And on examination we find, that from the time when <HI>Hugh Capet</HI> &s;eized the throne of France, to the time, when the French, under <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. began that career of blood, which, for many years, proved &s;o calamitous to Europe, and e&s;pecially to the Prote&s;tants, was exactly 666 years. <HI>Hugh Capet</HI> &s;eized the throne in 987, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. came to the throne, on the death of his father <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. in 1643, came to his majo|rity in 1652, and in the following year war was made upon Spain. Here he begins to ri&s;e above the &s;urface of that bog in which his tyranny had been gendering for 666 years.</P>
<P>Thus, if I am not deceived, there is every proof which can be expected, proof, which amounts much nearer to a demon&s;tration than is u&s;ual on &s;uch &s;ubjects, that the French monarchy, was the &s;econd bea&s;t which came up out of the earth. And though I would guard again&s;t ra&s;h confidence, I feel a per&s;ua&s;ion which I cannot overcome, that this is the truth. And if it be, the con&s;e|quences which are united with it are to the la&s;t degree intere&s;ting, both to the church and to mankind at large.</P>

<P N="1">1. Who are the&s;e <HI>two witne&s;&s;es?</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xi. 3.</NOTE> <HI>"I will give power unto my two witne&s;&s;es, and they &s;hall prophecy a thou&s;and two hundred and three&s;core days clothed in &s;ackcloth."</HI> The mo&s;t prevailing opinion is, that the faith|ful mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, and all tho&s;e who bear te&s;timony again&s;t the errors and u&s;urpations of antichri&s;t, are intended; and that the number <HI>two</HI> is mentioned in allu&s;ion to the law of Mo&s;es which re|quired two witne&s;&s;es, at lea&s;t, to make a te&s;timony valid. Bi&s;hop <HI>Lloyd</HI> &s;uppo&s;es them to be the <HI>Walden&s;es</HI> and <HI>Albigen&s;es,</HI> the early wit|ne&s;&s;es in France and its vicinity, again&s;t the corruptions of popery. Dr. <HI>More</HI> explains it of unpolluted prie&s;ts and faithful magi&s;trates. But I have long thought that, by the&s;e witne&s;&s;es, the &s;pirit of pro|phecy intended the <HI>witne&s;&s;es for go&s;pel truth</HI> again&s;t the &s;piritual domi|nations and corrupt errors of the papal apo&s;tacy; and all tho&s;e who bear witne&s;s for <HI>civil liberty</HI> again&s;t the tyrannies and oppre&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e princes and governors, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions have en&s;laved mankind and de&s;olated the earth. The number of the&s;e witne&s;&s;es has in ge|neral been but &s;mall, yet, though they have prophe&s;ied in &s;ackcloth, God in his good providence, has always pre&s;erved to mankind a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of both de&s;criptions. Even wi&s;e and good men have not, perhaps, &s;ufficiently con&s;idered the worth and importance of the witne&s;&s;es of the latter de&s;cription, in fulfilling the great de&s;igns of God's goodne&s;s towards men; and hence they have almo&s;t always interpreted this prophecy as relating to the <HI>&s;tate of religion</HI> only; as if the <HI>civil and political</HI> &s;tate of men, were held in little con&s;ideration by the Lord of the whole earth.</P>

<P>Here the <HI>third</HI> que&s;tion pre&s;ents it&s;elf. <HI>What duration of time are we to under&s;tand by the&s;e three days and a half?</HI></P>
<P>Before I offer my interpretation of this number, there is one con&s;ideration which claims a previous attention. On a careful examination, we &s;hall find in all the predictions of the prophets, that although they give us a&s;&s;urance of the facts, yet the time of their accompli&s;hment is left in a &s;tate of uncertainty. And even where dates are fixed, as in the predictions re&s;pecting the return of the Jews from Babylon, after 70 years captivity; and the ap|pearance of the Me&s;&s;iah after 70 weeks, or 490 years; yet the commencement of the&s;e periods is involved in ob&s;curity, till light is thrown upon them by the event. It never was intended that men &s;hould know with certainty when any future event is to take place, and this for an obvious rea&s;on. The prophecies, we &s;hould remember, were de&s;igned not to gratify our <HI>curio&s;ity,</HI> but &s;o confirm our <HI>faith</HI> in the truth of the divine word, by their ac|compli&s;hment. And hence the nece&s;&s;ity that the&s;e <HI>three days and a half</HI> &s;hould have a different meaning from the common prophetic days, that thus the time might not &s;o ea&s;ily be a&s;certained till the accompli&s;hment &s;hould lead me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to their true intention. Were the prophecies &s;o clear that every one could preci&s;ely know the circum&s;tances and the time to which they refer, hindrances, if we may &s;peak thus, would be thrown in the way of God's de&s;igns, and, in many ca&s;es, a check would be given to the nece&s;&s;ary ex|ertions and pur&s;uits of men. All the latter part of the la&s;t cen|tury, thinking people of all countries, were expecting the ac|compli&s;hment of the 1260 years, (the time of the bea&s;t's power.) On the revocation of the <HI>Edict of Nants,</HI> the whole Prote&s;tant world, and e&s;pecially the poor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of them, <HI>Peter Jurieu,</HI> &s;ays, <Q>I know not from what time God &s;hall plea&s;e to begin the recko<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the three years and a half.

<P>My an&s;wer is, that <HI>days</HI> in this 11th ver. are the &s;ame with <HI>months</HI> in the 2d. ver. or if you plea&s;e, <HI>lunar days,</HI> reckoning as
<PB N="21" REF="046985_0024_10228999F146FD80">the Jews did, thirty days to a month, and as is the method in cal|culating the above forty-two months, to make them agree with the 1260 days in ver. 3.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some have &s;uppo&s;ed that the&s;e thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e days and a half are to be reckoned as we reckon the time, and times, and half a time. Chap. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ii. 14. taking them for Jew|i&s;h years, and then reckoning the days for years, i. e. 1260 years. But this is &s;ubver|&s;ive of all that is &s;aid from the &s;eventh ver&s;e and on; it makes the whole duration of their prophecying the &s;ame with their fini&s;hing it. And on this ground, the idea of <HI>lunar days</HI> or months, &s;eems a va&s;t deal more fea&s;ible.
<P>Originally, the Jews mea&s;ured their months by the <HI>&s;un,</HI> and then every month con&s;i&s;ted of thirty days. But after they came out of Egypt they mea&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed them by the cour&s;e of the <HI>moon,</HI> and then the fir&s;t was of thirty days, the next of twenty-nine, and &s;o a ternately; that which had thirty days was called a complete month, and that which had but twenty-nine an incomplete month. From change to change are 29 days 12 hours and 44 minutes. And it may not be ami&s;s to recollect that one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unar month is the length of the moon's day, for &s;he turns round her axis exactly in the time that &s;he goes round the earth.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Thirty</HI> multiplied by <HI>three,</HI> adding <HI>fifteen</HI> for the half day, makes 105. When this way of reckoning fir&s;t occurred to my mind, I had no idea of the events which this number connected; for I did not recollect the year when the <HI>Edict of Nants</HI> was revoked. But looking over <HI>Quick</HI>'s <HI>Synodicon,</HI> I found it to be October 18th, 1685, to which if 105 be added, it brings us to 1790. Take off a few months, (if that &s;hould be thought nece&s;&s;ary,) for the event taking place before the half day is quite expired, and it brings us to 1789, when the witne&s;&s;es were to be quickened. Whether this may &s;trike others as it &s;truck me, when I fir&s;t ob&s;erved the coincidence, I can|not tell; but, from this agreement of the number 105, with the time which elap&s;ed between one of the greate&s;t per&s;ecutions that was ever experienced by Chri&s;tians, and this wonderful revolution which has taken place, a thou&s;and ideas ru&s;hed upon my mind.

The <HI>eighteenth ver&s;e</HI> obliges us to interpret it thus: <HI>The nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead that they &s;hould be judged.</HI> The time when thou wilt avenge the blood which ty|rants have &s;hed&mdash;<HI>and de&s;troy them which have de&s;troyed the earth.</HI> The nations will be enraged at this change of things, and unite to oppo&s;e it, and great woes are to follow.

Now the angels begin to pour out the vials of the wrath of God; for, as we have already ob&s;erved, this chapter contains a complicated vi&s;ion of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ong cour&s;e of events, in miniature, which is afterwards illu&s;trated by &s;everal di&s;tinct vi&s;ions on a larger &s;cale.</P>
<P>But before we enter upon the con&s;ideration of the vials, permit me to adduce &s;ome authorities, which e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider the time when they were written, more than a hundred years ago, tend very much to &s;trengthen the argument in favour of my hypothe&s;is, re&s;pecting the witne&s;&s;es; their &s;laying and re&s;urrection. The fir&s;t I &s;hall mention is <HI>Peter Jurieu,</HI> a French Prote&s;tant mini&s;ter, who&s;e works were publi&s;hed in Engli&s;h in 1687. He &s;ays, "The tenth part of the city which here fell, will, at &s;ome future time, appear to be the kingdom of France, where a revolution will take place about the year 1785, and a &s;eparation from the papacy follow, when the names of Monks and Nuns, of Carmelites and Augu&s;|tines, Dominicans, &amp;c. &s;hall peri&s;h for ever, and all tho&s;e vain ti|tles and armorial bearings, which &s;erve for ornament and pride, &s;hall vani&s;h; and brotherly love make all men equal. Not that there &s;hall be no di&s;tinctions, for it is not a kingdom of anarchy; but go|vernment &s;hall then be without bride and in&s;olence; without ty|ranny and violence, and &s;ubjects &s;hall obey their governors with an humble &s;pirit." The time required, according to this author, after the quickening of the witne&s;&s;es, (<HI>i. e.</HI> from the time of the re|volution) to de&s;troy antichri&s;t, will be twenty or twenty-&s;ive years;
<PB N="25" REF="046985_0028_102289A42F193488">and that it will take about &s;eventy years more for the aboli&s;hing of &s;ects and parties among Chri&s;tians, and for the conver&s;ion of the Jews and Heathens. "And all this," he &s;ays, "cannot be brought about without confu&s;ion and tumult. The popi&s;h empire cannot fall, but it mu&s;t cau&s;e blood and a mighty noi&s;e." Thus far <HI>Jurieu.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. Goodwin, who wrote a hundred and fifty years &s;ince, in his <HI>Expo&s;ition upon the Revelations, Part</HI> I. <HI>Chap.</HI> 7. has a great deal which is as a&s;toni&s;hing as it is appo&s;ite to the pre&s;ent argument. He &s;ays, (&s;ect. 6.) "The &s;aints and churches of France, God has made a wonder to me in all his proceedings towards them, fir&s;t and la&s;t; and there would &s;eem &s;ome great and &s;pecial honour re&s;erved for them, yet at the la&s;t; for it is certain, that the fir&s;t light of the go&s;pel, by that fir&s;t and &s;econd angels preaching in <HI>chapter the fourteenth</HI> (which laid the foundation of antichri&s;t's ruin) was out from among them, and they bore and underwent the great heat of that morming of per|&s;ecution, which was as great, if not greater than any &s;ince.&mdash;And &s;o, as that kingdom had the fir&s;t great &s;troke, &s;o now it &s;hould have the honour of having the la&s;t great &s;troke in the ruin of Rome."</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> 5th, he &s;ays, on <HI>Rev.</HI> xi. "By the earthquake here is meant a great concu&s;&s;ion or &s;haking of &s;tates politics, or eccle&s;ia&s;tical.&mdash; The effect of this earthquake and fall of this tenth part of the city, is killing <HI>&s;even thou&s;and of the names of men.</HI>&mdash;Now, by men of name, in &s;cripture is meant men of title, office and dignity.&mdash;As in the ca&s;e of Corah's con&s;piracy, &s;o here a civil puni&s;hment falls upon the&s;e.

<P>The &s;ingular agreement of pre&s;ent events with what the&s;e authors foretold, from the prophecies, &s;o many years ago, is a circum&s;tance which merits the &s;erious attention of all wi&s;e and con&s;iderate men; for it certainly adds great weight to the conjecture, that what has taken place in France, is the beginning of the final downfal of the papal u&s;urpations and tyrannies. And if it &s;hould be &s;o&mdash;woe be to them, who attempt to uphold what God has willed to fall! In the ordinary wars which nations have waged, they have, perhaps, lo&s;t one or two hundred thou&s;and lives, and &s;laughtered as many of their enemies; countries have been laid wa&s;te, and taxes incurred to the oppre&s;&s;ion of the indu&s;trious; but in other re&s;pects they may have &s;at down much as they were; but, if the pre&s;ent conte&s;t be what there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect it; not merely a war of <HI>man</HI> again&s;t <HI>man;</HI> but of <HI>God</HI> again&s;t <HI>antickri&s;tian u&s;urpations</HI> and <HI>oppre&s;&s;ions,</HI> the i&s;&s;ue to tho&s;e who oppo&s;e his de&s;igns, mu&s;t be different.

Let us now revert to the que&s;tion, What are to be the con&s;equen|ces of the re&s;urrection of the witne&s;&s;es?

<P>As to the gathering of the vintage in the fourteenth chapter, it appears to me, that it properly falls under one or more of the vials, and as Dr. <HI>Goodwin</HI> has well explained it, &s;eems to be a vi&s;ion of the vengeance which is to be executed upon the Prote&s;tant party; for the wine-pre&s;s is &s;aid be trodden <HI>without the city, i. e.</HI> without the ju|ri&s;diction or reach of the city of Rome; and is repre&s;ented in a &s;e|parate vi&s;ion, on purpo&s;e to &s;hew that vengeance will fall even up|on &s;uch kingdoms and nations as had ca&s;t off the Pope's &s;uprema|cy.

<P>In Dan. XII. we have three different numbers. (The fir&s;t agrees with that in chap. vii. 25.)

<P>But how can we reconcile tho&s;e three different numbers of Da|niel, with the &s;even (two in Daniel and five in the Apocalyp&s;e) which agree?</P>

<P>But, perhaps, it may be a&s;ked, What arguments are there which favour the conjecture of the 529th year of Chri&s;t being that from which the power of the bea&s;t is to be dated? I own I have put this year down by accident, as the mea&s;urement back from 1789. To demon&s;trate, that in this year, he came to &s;uch a &s;tate of maturity (for he was in embryo in the apo&s;tles days, and continued to grow for ages) as to con&s;titute him a bea&s;t, is not e&s;&s;ential to the making good our hypothe&s;is. But though no man, from the hi&s;tory of pa&s;t times, can determine the exact year from which God dates the kingdom of antichri&s;t, yet there are good rea&s;ons from which a probable conjecture may be for|med that it was as early as the <HI>&s;ixth</HI> century. Some of our mo&s;t able critics, as <HI>Bi&s;hop Newton</HI> and <HI>Mr. Lowman,</HI> are of opinion, that by the wound which the fir&s;t bea&s;t received, chap. xiii. 3. we are to under&s;tand the blow which was given to the maje&s;ty and
<PB N="37" REF="046985_0040_102289C26FB00200">power of Rome, by &s;ubjecting it to the exarchate of Revenna, and that by its being healed, is intended, its re&s;toration to its for|mer dignity by this exarchate being given to the Pope, by which he became a temporal prince. Now, this wounding took place A. D. 568, and continued 206 years. If this be well con&s;ider|ed, it tends much to &s;trengthen our argument. But farther to confirm our hypothe&s;is, con&s;ider the &s;tate of &s;ociety, and parti|cularly the &s;tate of what was called the church, in this &s;ixth cen|tury. Magi&s;trates were tyrants, and prie&s;ts were wicked, &s;uper|&s;titious and intolerant beyond any former age. Now, numberle&s;s laws and regulations were obtruded upon the church by human authority, which at once violated the authority of Chri&s;t, defa|ced Chri&s;tianity, and robbed Chri&s;tians of their deare&s;t liberties. And in this very year 529, which we are looking for, the <HI>Ju&s;tini|an code</HI> was fir&s;t publi&s;hed, by which tho&s;e powers, privileges and immunities were &s;ecured to the clergy; that union perfected be|tween things civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and tho&s;e law, impo&s;ed on the church, which have proved &s;o injurious to Chri&s;tianity, and &s;o calamitous to mankind. And which code, through the zeal of the clergy, has been received, more or le&s;s, as the foundation of the juri&s;prudence of almo&s;t every &s;tate in Chri&s;tendom; and that not only in things <HI>civil,</HI> but <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical;</HI> and by this means, as &s;ome author has ob&s;erved, the old fancy of the Romans, about the eternity of their command, is thus far verified.</P>
