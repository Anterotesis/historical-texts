<P>Well, he further &s;aith, Malice it <HI>&s;elf cannot fix it on the Eight</HI> Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> No, how came <HI>D. L.</HI> and he to do it then? For t'was from them I had it, neither will that help him out to &s;ay, he &s;aid, <HI>Mo&s;t of tho&s;e Quotations are Atte&s;ted with near 800 more in the</HI> 3d. and 4th. Narrative.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> What is that to the purpo&s;e? For what could be un|der&s;tood by the words (tho&s;e Quotations) but tho&s;e in that <HI>Sheet</HI> he &s;aid they had <HI>Atte&s;ted?</HI> So let it be where or when it will, yet it was the&s;e in that <HI>Sheet</HI> that <HI>G.
