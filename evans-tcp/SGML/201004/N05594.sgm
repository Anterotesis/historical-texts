<P>WHEN their Plots were ripe for Execu|tion, we find their fir&s;t Proceeding a|gain&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> various; &s;ome of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> only &s;tripping and expelling them, others murthering Men, Women and Children without Mercy; all re&s;olving univer&s;ally to root out all the Prote&s;tants out of <HI>Ireland;</HI> &s;o deeply malicious were they again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prote&s;tants, that they would not &s;o much as endure the &s;ound of their Language.</P>
<P>The Prie&s;ts gave the Sacrament unto divers of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> upon condition they &s;hould neither &s;pare Man, Woman nor Child of the Prote&s;tants. One <HI>Hilligan</HI> a Prie&s;t, read an Excommunication again&s;t all tho&s;e, that from henceforth &s;hould relieve or harbour any <HI>Engli&s;h, Scotch</HI> or <HI>Welch</HI> Man, or give them Alms, whereby many were fami&s;hed to death. The Friars exhorted them with Tears, not to &s;pare any of the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> they boa&s;ted, that when they
<PB N="6" REF="007100_0005_102AF4B267E94900">
had de&s;troyed them in <HI>Ireland,</HI> they would go over into <HI>England,</HI> and not leave the Memorial of an <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Man under Heaven.</P>
<P>They openly profe&s;&s;ed, that they held it as lawful to kill a Prote&s;tant as to kill a Dog. One of their Prie&s;ts &s;aid, <HI>That it was no more pity to take their Lives from them, than it is to take a Bone out of a Dogs Mouth.</HI></P>
<P>The Day before this Ma&s;&s;acre began, the Prie&s;ts gave the People a Di&s;mi&s;s at Ma&s;s, with liberty to go out, and to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all their Lands, as al&s;o to &s;trip, rob and de&s;poil them and their Goods and Cattle; the Prote&s;tants being, as they told them wor&s;e than Dogs, for they were Devils, and there|fore the Killing of &s;uch was a <HI>Meritorious Act,</HI> and <HI>a rare Pre&s;ervative again&s;t the Pains of Purgatory;</HI> and this cau&s;ed &s;ome of the Murtherers to boa&s;t, after they had &s;lain many of the <HI>Engli&s;h, that they knew, that if they &s;hould die pre&s;ently, they &s;hould go &s;traight to Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> when the Ma&s;&s;acre began, per&s;uaded many of their Prote&s;tant Neighbours to bring their Goods to them, and they would &s;ecure them, and hereby they got abundance peaceably into their Hands, whereof they cheated the Prote&s;tants, refu&s;|ing to re&s;tore them again; yet &s;o confident were the Prote&s;tants at fir&s;t of them, that they gave them Inventories of all they had, and digged up their be&s;t things that were hidden in the Ground, and depo&s;ited them in their Cu&s;tody. They al&s;o got much into their Hands by fair Promi&s;es, deep Oaths and Engagements, that if they would deliver them their Goods, they would &s;uffer them, with their Wives and Children, quietly to depart the Coun|try;
<PB N="7" REF="007100_0006_102AF4B58DD35268">
and when they had got what they could, they afterwards murthered them.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;eized upon their Goods and Cattle, ran&s;ackt their Hou&s;es, got their Per&s;ons, &s;tript Man, Woman and Child naked, and &s;o turned then out of doors, &s;trictly prohibiting the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> under great penal|ties, not to give them any relief; by means hereof many mi&s;erably peri&s;h'd through cold nakedne&s;s and hunger.</P>
<P>In the Town of <HI>Coleraine,</HI> many of the&s;e poor peo|ple that fled thither for &s;uccour, many thou&s;ands died in two days, &s;o that the living could not bury the dead, but laid their Carca&s;&s;es in ranks in wa&s;te and wide holes, &s;peling them up as if they had been Herrings.</P>
<P>One <HI>Magdalen Redman</HI> depo&s;eth, that &s;he, and divers other <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> among whom were two and twenty Widows, were fir&s;t robbed, and then &s;tript naked, and when they had covered them|&s;elves with &s;traw, the bloody <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> threw in burning &s;traw among them, on purpo&s;e to burn them; then they drove them out into the Woods in Fro&s;t and Snow, where many of them died with extream cold, and tho&s;e that &s;urvived, lived mi&s;erably by rea&s;on of their many wants.</P>
<P>Yet though the&s;e bloody Villains exerci&s;ed in|human cruelties towards the poor <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> they would commonly boa&s;t, <HI>That the&s;e were but the be|ginning of their &s;orrows,</HI> for indeed they made it good; for having di&s;armed the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> robbed them of their goods, &s;tript them of their Clothes, and having their Per&s;ons in their power, they furiou&s;ly broke out into all manner of abomina|ble Cruelties, horrid Ma&s;&s;acres, and execrable Murders.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="007100_0007_102AF4B8567150C8">For there were multitudes murdered in cold blood, &s;ome as they were at Plough, others in their Hou&s;es, others in the High-ways; all with|out any provocation, were &s;uddenly de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>In the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Li&s;gool,</HI> were about one hundred and fifty Men, Women and Children con&s;umed by fire. At the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Tullah,</HI> which was delivered to <HI>Mac-Guire,</HI> upon compo&s;ition, and faithful pro|mi&s;es of fair quarter, as &s;oon as he and his en|tered, they began to &s;trip the people, and mo&s;t cruelly put them to the Sword, murdering them without mercy.</P>
<P>At <HI>Li&s;&s;an&s;keach,</HI> they hanged and killed above one hundred of the <HI>Scotti&s;h Prote&s;tants,</HI> in the Coun|ties of <HI>Ardmagh</HI> and <HI>Tyrone,</HI> where the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> were more numerous, their murders were more multiplied, and with greater cruelty.</P>
<P><HI>Mac-Guire</HI> coming to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Li&s;&s;an&s;keach,</HI> de&s;ired to &s;peak with Mr. <HI>Middleton,</HI> who admitted him in, he fir&s;t burnt the Records of the County, then demanded one thou&s;and pounds which was in the cu&s;tody of Sir <HI>William Belfores,</HI> which as &s;oon as he had, he cau&s;ed Mr. <HI>Middleton</HI> to hear Ma&s;s, and to &s;wear that he would never alter from it, and then hanged him up with his Wife and Children; hanging and murdering above one hundred per&s;ons be&s;ides in that place.</P>
<P>At <HI>Portadown</HI> Bridge, there were one thou&s;and Men, Women and Children, carried in &s;everal Companies, and all unmercifully drowned in the River. Yea, in that County there were one thou|&s;and per&s;ons drowned in &s;everal places.</P>
<P>In one place an hundred and forty <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were taken and driven like Cattle for many miles toge|ther.
<PB N="9" REF="007100_0008_102AF4BAAE6EEAC8">
Other companies they carried out to a place fit for execution, and then murdered them. One hundred and fifteen Men, Women and Children, they &s;ent with Sir <HI>Philemy Oneal</HI>'s pa&s;s, till they came to <HI>Portadown</HI> Bridge, and there drowned them.</P>
<P>At another time one hundred and forty <HI>Pro|te&s;tants,</HI> being thrown in at the &s;ame Place, as any of them &s;wam to the Shore, the bloody Villains, with the But-end of their Mu&s;kets knockt out their brains.</P>
<P>At <HI>Ardmagh, O Cane</HI> got together all the <HI>Pro|te&s;tants</HI> thereabouts, pretending to conduct them to <HI>Colerane;</HI> but before they were a days Journey, they were all murthered, and &s;o were many others, though they had Protections from Sir <HI>Philemy O|neal.</HI> The aged people in <HI>Ardmagh</HI> were carried to <HI>Charlem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt,</HI> and there murthered.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently after the Town of <HI>Ardmagh</HI> was burnt, and five hundred per&s;ons murthered and drowned. In <HI>Killaman,</HI> were forty eight families murthered, in one hou&s;e twenty two Prote&s;tants were burned. In <HI>Kilmare</HI> all the inhabitants were &s;tript and ma&s;|&s;acred, being two hundred familes: the whole was a common Butchery; many thou&s;ands peri&s;hed by &s;word, famine, fire, water, and all other cruel deaths that rage and malice could invent.</P>
<P>At <HI>Ca&s;el</HI> they put all the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> into a loath&s;ome Dungeon, kept them twelve weeks in great mi&s;ery. Some they barbarou&s;ly mangled, and left them langui&s;hing; &s;ome they hanged up twice or thrice, others they buried alive.</P>
<P>In <HI>Queens</HI> County, an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, his Wife, five Children and a Maid, were all hanged toge|ther.

<P>In <HI>Kilkenny</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woman was beaten into a ditch, where &s;he died; her Child about &s;ix years old, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pt up her belly and let out her Guts.

A young <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Woman's Child, they took by the heels, and da&s;ht out its brains again&s;t a Tree; the like they did to many other Children.</P>
<P><HI>Ann Hill</HI> going with a young Child on her back, and four more by her &s;ide, they pulled the Child off her back, trode on it till it died, &s;tripped her

and the other four Children naked, whereby they died of cold.</P>
<P>Some others they met with hanged them up upon a Windmill, and before they were half dead, cut them in pieces with their Skeins.</P>
<P>Many other <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> e&s;pecially Women and Children, they pricked and &s;tabbed with Skeins, Forks and Swords, &s;la&s;hing, cutting, and mangling them in their Heads and left them alive wallowing in their own blood, to langui&s;h, &s;tarve and pine to death.</P>

One <HI>Joan Addit</HI> they &s;tabbed, and then put her Child of a quarter old to her Brea&s;t, and bid it, <HI>Suck Engli&s;h Ba&s;tard,</HI> and &s;o left it to peri&s;h.</P>
<P>One <HI>Mary Barlow</HI> had her hu&s;band hanged, her &s;elf with &s;ix Children &s;tript naked, in Fro&s;t and Snow, after which, &s;heltering them&s;elves in a Cave, they had nothing there to eat for three weeks, but two old Calves &s;kins, which they beat with &s;tones, and &s;o eat them hair and all.</P>
<P>In the cold weather, many thou&s;ands of <HI>Pro|te&s;tants</HI> of all ranks, ages, and &s;exes, being turn|ed out naked, peri&s;hed of cold and hunger; thou|&s;ands of others were drowned, ca&s;t into Ditches, Bogs and Turf-pits: multitudes mi&s;erably burnt in hou&s;es; &s;ome that lay &s;ick of Fevers they hanged up; &s;ome Men, Women, and Children they drove into boggy Pits, and knock't them on the head.</P>
