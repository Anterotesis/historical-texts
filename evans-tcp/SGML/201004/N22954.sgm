<HEAD>Preface.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE</HI> following e&s;&s;ay was originally de&s;igned for the u&s;e of the writer's Farmer only: to whom the want of time, and the want of practice had rendered READING, a work of his utmo&s;t exertions and indu&s;try to accompli&s;h&mdash;who would have viewed a large treatise, as a mo&s;t formidable undertaking; but might receive with great plea&s;ure, the &s;ame matter thrown into a &s;mall compa&s;s&mdash;in which he could &s;ee, almo&s;t at a glance, the con|&s;tant object of his thoughts and occupation, treated of in a conci&s;e and rea&s;onable manner, which might become the entertainment of his winter evenings, and from the various new hints and remarks con|tained therein, lead him to try the truth of them by the unfailing te&s;t of experiment, and excite in him a laudable ambition of excelling in the line of his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The appendix to the following e&s;&s;ay, is little more than an a|bridgment of various voluminous publications on the &s;ubject of agri|culture and good hu&s;bandry, fitted to the u&s;e of Farmers in New-England. But in the Addre&s;s it has been attempted to point the Farmer's mind to a &s;erious attention to a &s;y&s;tem of oeconomics, in the various branches of his occupation, and in the relations he has to &s;u&s;|tain with tho&s;e around him.&mdash;It is there &s;aid, "that more is gained by &s;owing than by hard labor"&mdash;even labor mu&s;t be oeconomical&mdash;e|qually di&s;tant from indolence on the one hand, and from hurry on the other&mdash;he who is over wrought to day, on the morrow mu&s;t require &s;u|pernumerary hours of re&s;t and relaxation, to retribute the exce&s;s. But the thrift of a &s;aving man is regular and certain, though gradual and almo&s;t imperceptible. After a few years of &s;y&s;tematical oeconomy, he looks back with a&s;toni&s;hment on the aggregate amount of &s;avings, com|po&s;ed of articles &s;eemingly below the wa&s;te of a moment's con&s;idera|tion.</P>

<HEAD>The Character of a complete Farmer.</HEAD>
<P>A COMPLETE Farmer is a mo&s;t careful, Indu&s;|trious and frugal, as well as reputable and u&s;eful man: and unle&s;s carefulne&s;s, indu&s;try and oeconomy are united in the character, it will be an imperfect one. Although a Farmer cannot live without labor, by labor alone he never can grow rich and reputable. Much depends upon his laying out and performing certain kinds of labor in the times and &s;ea&s;ons when they ought to be performed. If he will not cart out his &s;ummer dung, nor plough tho&s;e lands in the fall, which he means to &s;eed in the following &s;pring&mdash;if he will not put his &s;eeds into the ground early, and as &s;oon as the &s;ea&s;on will admit&mdash;if he will not attend to his Fences and &s;ee that they are &s;ufficient&mdash;and if he will not cut his gra&s;s when it is ripe and do ev|ery thing nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure it in good order; he will be perpetually hurried from one kind of labor to a|nother, and every one will be &s;lighted: his flax will not be well coated, nor his grain properly filled out; his corn will be &s;hortened for want of being well hoed, and his gra&s;s will become dead and dry away in the field. Let every kind of labor, therefore, be per|formed in due &s;ea&s;on. A complete Farmer is al&s;o a man of great carefulne&s;s and &s;olicitude; without care, the &s;evere&s;t labor on the be&s;t of Farms, will never produce riches nor plenty. If the Farmer will
<PB N="6" REF="030307_0005_0FE5B041E62FA280">not milk his cows in &s;ea&s;on&mdash;&s;ee that they are pro|perly tended&mdash;go to the male in the right time for the next year's profit; and that his dairy is neatly and carefully managed, he may labour without cea&s;|ing, will have a &s;mall, poor breed of cattle, &amp; never enjoy a fulne&s;s of good butter, and chee&s;e. It is care which makes a flock increa&s;e and grow to a good &s;ize, which brings forth the profits of a dairy, and which fills the hou&s;e of the Farmer with good things. If he will not carefully in&s;pect his fields and meadows, and &s;ee that his fences are in good order, his gra&s;s and his corn will be cropt by his cattle: and if he will not gather and put them up carefully and in due &s;ea&s;on, he will have a &s;hort and a mouldy crop. If he mows, rakes, and fodders his cattle in a carele&s;s &s;lovenly manner, his flock will be pinched through the winter, and become poor and lou&s;y in the &s;pring &mdash;poor oxen too poor to do the labor of the &s;ea|&s;on&mdash;poor cows, with little or no milk, and wretch|ed calves and poor hor&s;es, too feeble to draw, and too weak to ride with &s;afety. If his &s;wine, poultry and &s;tock in general, and if his carts, rakes and tools of all kinds, are not carefully attended to, the Farm|er never can grow rich and re&s;pectable. It is atten|tion which gradually collects from various &s;ources, and covers the &s;oil with manure; it is attention which cau&s;es the hills, fields and valleys to yield their increa&s;e, and advances and completes the mo&s;t bene|ficial improvements. There is a third virtue without the practice of which, the Farmer can never attain to wealth and independence: I mean oeconomy. Without this both labor in rai&s;ing, and care in pre|&s;erving the fruits of the earth, are ab&s;olutely thrown away. Oeconomy is an excellent virtue in any man: it is indi&s;pen&s;ible in the affairs and profe&s;&s;ion of a Farmer. And of this he &s;hould never be unmind|ful
<PB N="7" REF="030307_0006_0FE5B043777A87A8">when he looks into his barn, his cellar, or his gar|ret, or even his pa&s;tures; to &s;ay nothing of his fields, mowing lands and meadows. But Farmers, as well as other men, are too apt to forget, that in their pur&s;uits after riches, almo&s;t every thing depends up|on oeconomy joined with care and indu&s;try. A fru|gal, indu&s;trious man, ble&s;&s;ed with but a common &s;hare of under&s;tanding, will undoubtedly &s;ucceed and advance his intere&s;t, beyond what ever he ex|pected, when he fir&s;t &s;et out in life: provided no &s;ingular providential evil &s;hould overtake him. More is gained by &s;aving than by hard labor. A Farmer therefore who&s;e utmo&s;t profits are &s;mall and &s;low, as he cannot grow rich &s;uddenly from his profe&s;&s;ion, &s;hould be a rigid and &s;teady oeconomi&s;t. He &s;hould con&s;ider the &s;aving he may make in every thing: in his fuel, tools, clothes, meat, drink, and pocket ex|pences; above all in his Time, which is equal to &s;o much money in hand. Every day that his neighbour runs down to market on his hor&s;e, with a pound or two of butter and a few eggs, if he &s;tays at home and keeps &s;teady to his labor, he gets two, if not three days the &s;tart of him. While his neighbour wa&s;tes his time and &s;pends his money by this impru|dent and trifling pur&s;uit he &s;aves both time and mo|ney, in dre&s;&s;ing and improving his lands, and which de|mand all his attention. There is no lei&s;ure hour to be found on a farm from early in the &s;pring, till late in the fall. Through all that whole period, a good farmer knows how to &s;pend every hour profitably on his lands. He can have no time to pa&s;s in idlene&s;s&mdash;in chatting with people as they pa&s;s by&mdash;in making needle&s;s vi&s;its&mdash;in attending courts, hor&s;e races, taverns, and the like. By the&s;e means the public is annually de|prived of many thou&s;ands of bu&s;hels of Potatoes, corn, tons of hay, &amp;c. and individuals them&s;elves be|come
<PB N="8" REF="030307_0007_0FE5993C5C6977D0">poor, and fall into the wor&s;t of habits&mdash;into idlene&s;s, gaming, drinking, &amp;c. There is no kind of oeconomy in the Farmer, which will not be well re|warded. Early ri&s;ing will contribute to his health, and pre&s;erve his fields from the inroads of unruly creatures, which commonly begin their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es ju&s;t as the day begins to dawn. Clo&s;e mowing and careful raking, will enable him to winter one cow ex|traordinary. Feeding his hogs by weeds and other vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, will enable him to pay his &s;hoe|makers. Scraping his door and barn yards, after rains and &s;howers, will clothe his boy. Saving his early apples, and which are commonly lo&s;t entirely, will pay his taylor, his poultry well attended, will pay his maid. His calves will pay all his taxes, and &s;ome part of his hired labor, if proper care be taken of them. In fine, let a Farmer who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es only fifty acres of good land&mdash;who owes no man, and who has a common ble&s;&s;ing on the labors of his hands, &s;trictly attend to the management of his affairs; live a life of patient indu&s;try, and practice agreeable to the principles of oeconomy, and I think he may live well&mdash;may be excu&s;ed the harde&s;t of labor&mdash;leave his hoe and &s;pade to the next generation, by the time he has &s;een Fifty years, when mo&s;t men begin to think of comfort, ea&s;e and independence.</P>

<HEAD>The importance of Manure.</HEAD>
<P>TOO much cannot be &s;aid upon the &s;ubject of manure. The va&s;t importance of this article has not been &s;ufficiently attended to by Farmers in gen|eral, although it is the principal &s;ource of their riches. Without it, after all their care and labor, they can have but mi&s;erable crops of gra&s;s, flax, corn, &amp;c. A man mu&s;t plough, hoe, mow, rake and hire, more on poor, than on rich land: and it will take a much greater number of acres to &s;upport his family comfortably. And it requires the &s;ame quantity of &s;eed; is much harder to till, and is taxed the &s;ame as rich land; and after all produces not one half the profits. Every Farmer, therefore, who wi&s;hes to reap the fruits of his labor and care; to improve his lands and increa&s;e his &s;ub&s;tance; and to live ea&s;y &s;ome future day, &s;hould carefully attend to the in|crea&s;e of his manure. And here I would ob&s;erve, that the hog&s;tye, properly attended, will be found to be one of the greate&s;t and riche&s;t &s;ources of this important article. Almo&s;t any quantity may be ob|tained from it; provided the Farmer will be as care|ful to feed the &s;tye, as the &s;wine confined in it. All kinds of weeds, potatoe tops, &s;traw, pomace, broken peat, dre&s;&s;ings of flax, butt-&s;talks, roots and vegetables of every kind, will &s;oon become the riche&s;t of ma|nure, when thrown into the hog&s;tye. Three or four &s;wine in this way, will make twelve or fifteen loads in a year; the value of which, where dung is &s;carce and dear, will be four pounds at lea&s;t. Several ju|dicious
<PB N="10" REF="030307_0009_0FE5B04B710A17A8">Farmers of my acquaintance, are per&s;uaded that the greate&s;t profits in keeping &s;wine, ari&s;e from their &s;ties. A &s;mall proportion of this manure, mixed with &s;oil and rubbi&s;h, would be &s;een in a field of potatoes, or of indian corn. And the quan|tity to be made in one &s;tye, well &s;upplied with weeds and other vegetable &s;ub&s;tances through the year, is almo&s;t incredible; &s;ome have &s;aid, that "forty loads" may be obtained in this way, from ten, or twelve &s;wine, in one year only. And great quantities of excellent manure for dre&s;&s;ing gra&s;s land, may be obtained by ploughing, or cutting up green &s;ward two or three inches thick, by the &s;ides of roads, walls, &amp;c. and laying it in heaps, gra&s;s &s;ide down, for eight or ten months. A little lime mixed with it, would render it fit for u&s;e much &s;ooner. One would think, that a Farmer who mows over three or four acres of land, naturally good, but worn down, and which yield not more than fifteen or twenty hundreds of hay&mdash;who cultivates as many acres of indian corn, on a &s;oil equally as good, but &s;tarved and ex|hau&s;ted, and which return him &s;ixty or &s;eventy bu&s;h|els only; when he looks into the fields of his neigh|bor, which are not better, if quite &s;o good, in point of &s;oil, but which are richly manured, and yield three times the crops yearly, mu&s;t be convinced of the va&s;t importance of manure; and of the amazing ad|vantages to be derived from this great and capital ar|ticle in the cultivation of the earth. The Chine&s;e, who may be &s;tiled a va&s;t nation of Farmers, as agri|culture is their mo&s;t honorable and their principal employment, pay the greate&s;t attention to it. The urine of families is all carefully &s;aved; and the re|fu&s;e of every kind of vegetable &s;ub&s;tance which the earth produces, through their labor and care, is made to contribute to reproductions. And, as very little
<PB N="11" REF="030307_0010_0FE5B04D04A56C30">can be done in the farming line, in the &s;tates of New-England, without manure, excepting new lands, which from the general deluge have increa&s;ed in rich|ne&s;s, by the falling of leaves, and other &s;ub&s;tances &s;cattered on their &s;urfaces, it ought to be con&s;idered and attended to mo&s;t carefully. And there can be no judicious Farmer among us, who does not endea|vor to obtain large quantities of this article, in pro|portion, if po&s;&s;ible, to the propo&s;ed cultivation and improvements of the next year.</P>
<P>We read, that the lands of the rich man brought forth plentifully, but this was not merely becau&s;e the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or was rich; for, the lands of the wealthy, will be no more productive, than tho&s;e of the poor, if they neglect to manure and cultivate them properly. The truth is, a plenty of manure and a judicious, &s;ea&s;ona|ble cultivation, will &s;oon put a new face upon almo&s;t any lands whatever. And if Farmers in general would pay more attention to the increa&s;e of their manure, they would experience a decrea&s;e in their labors, and receive a much greater profit from them. A few a|cres of good land richly manured and highly cultivat|ed would &s;upport their families confortably. And there is &s;carcely any &s;oil, but which, by the&s;e means, would give a prudent man a decent living. And that Farmer in this &s;tate who will not give his attention to this &s;ub|ject, cannot rea&s;onably expect any great profits from cultivating the earth, nor to become re&s;pectable in his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>On Labor.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I have been riding in the country in a very hot day, and &s;een Farmers mowing and hoeing in the full blaze of the noon day &s;un, the cu&s;tom of tho&s;e Farmers with whom I was conver&s;ant when a Lad, has immediately occured to my mind. In the months of June, July and Augu&s;t, they retired &s;o early to re&s;t, that they &s;eldom needed a candle to light them to their beds: and they ro&s;e as early in the morning as they could &s;ee to work. In the heat of the day, unle&s;s a &s;hower, or &s;ome thing extra cal|led them to exert them&s;elves, they laid a&s;ide their la|bors for an hour or two, and indulged them&s;elves in a comfortable nap after dinner. This gave them fre&s;h &s;trength and vigor: and they went forth to the labor of the evening, with &s;pirit and plea&s;ure. And if Farmers would work as early and late as they could, in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, they might re&s;t from e|leven until two o'clock, and e&s;cape the inten&s;e heat and thir&s;t of the day: and not be one half &s;o much fati|gued as others, who begin their labor late in the morn|ing&mdash;at &s;ix or perhaps &s;even o'clock; &amp; who, to perform the labors of the day, mu&s;t bear the heat and burden of it, and go to their beds at night exceeding weary, and quite exhau&s;ted. From eleven 'till two, you may walk round your farm, &s;tir hay, or do any light labor, without fatiguing your&s;elf in the lea&s;t. This walk will refre&s;h your &s;pirits; and may &s;ave your lands from the inroads of unruly cattle, &s;heep, &s;wine, &amp;c. Walls and other fences &s;hould often be in&s;pec|ted,
<PB N="13" REF="030307_0012_0FE5B05396B00778">if you wi&s;h to pre&s;erve the fruits of your labors, and half an hour, or more, in the time and &s;ea&s;on of it, devoted to this purpo&s;e, would not fail of being well rewarded&mdash;The&s;e hints may be improved on: and I clo&s;e this paper by ob&s;erving, that mowing and hoeing, both for comfort and profit, &s;hould be per|formed early in the morning and late in the evening. The labor of a Farmer is hard in general; a great part of the year it is &s;evere; and even when pru|dence has alone done all that &s;he can do, and which is not a little, &s;till, in the &s;weat of his face &s;hall he eat bread.</P>

<HEAD>Exchanging Work.</HEAD>
<P>FARMERS who handle but little money, &s;hould be cautious of entering into ca&s;h engagements; they will find it more convenient to exchange Labor, than to hire and pay money. Neighbors who have lands to break up, and teams to connect together, may do this bu&s;ine&s;s cheaper, by exchanging with each other, than by hiring help and cattle. It will of|ten be found mutually beneficial to make exchanges, even in mowing and hoeing. Through a difference in the &s;ituations and &s;oils of farms, though adjoining each other; and through early cultivation in the one, and late in the other, it frequently happens, that the corn, gra&s;s, flax, &amp;c. on one, is forwarder and ripe &s;ooner by &s;everal days, than on the other. In this ca&s;e it would be prudent to unite their labors and not to hire; this would be almo&s;t &s;o much &s;aved. But then, the&s;e exchanges &s;hould never make any alteration, either in meats or drinks, in the Farmer's family. For, if any extra provi&s;ion is made an extraordinary ex|pence is incured. The chief u&s;e of land, and that which makes it principally beneficial and profitable to a man, is this, it gives him employment: It is of very little advantage or profit to him who does not labor upon it in per&s;on. A Farmer &s;hould there|fore be cautious of hiring much help; and at no time more than he can fully and profitably employ and readily pay. And to do this if he hires for a month, or for a year he &s;hould endeavour to rai&s;e a &s;urplu&s;age of &s;ome one, or of &s;everal articles to the amount of the labor|er's
<PB N="15" REF="030307_0014_0FE5B05765CD1020">wages at lea&s;t. And if he does this, even then, he finds that a year's wages are not ea&s;ily paid: it will take off a con&s;iderable part of his corn, flax, dai|ry, or &s;ome other produce.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Farmers who hire much labor done, will &s;oon be convinced, if men of &s;en&s;e, that &s;carce any farm will yield &s;ix per cent. and keep up the nece&s;&s;ary repairs: and that although they po&s;&s;es flocks and herds, and are the proprietors or owners of the &s;oil, they are but little more than &s;tewards to their laborers. And this &s;hould excite them to labor indu&s;triou&s;ly with their own hands, and to do all they can within them|&s;elves. When diet and labor are &s;carce and dear, and a man has &s;everal farms, or more land to improve and cultivate, than he can take care of, unle&s;s he hires a number of laborers, he &s;hould let, or put them to the halves, as it is called, to hone&s;t and indu&s;tri|ous men, if he can find them. For, the difference between hiring laborers and boarding them, and let|ting, or putting out a farm, as above, the produce of which may amount to eighty or an hundred pounds, would be twenty, or twenty-five per cent. in favor of the proprietor. And he will not have the trouble of providing for, and paying a number of people: &s;ome of whom, after all his attention and punctuality toward them, will not acknowledge them&s;elves &s;atisfied and contented. Good help, as it is called, is generally &s;carce and dear, and with difficulty obtained; and a Farmer who hires carele&s;s, ignorant and &s;lothful labor|ers, notwith&s;tanding all his own indu&s;try, will never grow rich.</P>

<HEAD>The profits of a Nur&s;ery.</HEAD>
<P>TO this intere&s;ting &s;ubject &s;o little attention has been paid for many years pa&s;t, that the &s;carcity and price of fruit, are now &s;o exceeding great, as almo&s;t to prohibit the u&s;e of it. How &s;urprizing a neglect in the Farmer who lives in New-England, the climate and &s;oil of which are more than favorable to the prop|agation of various kinds of delicious fruits. The citizens of New-York have re&s;i&s;ted this carele&s;s, in|dolent di&s;po&s;ition, and been well rewarded for their indu&s;try. Con&s;iderable &s;ums of money are annually remited them from this State for the productions of their nur&s;eries, purcha&s;ed at a mo&s;t extravagant price, although the ri&s;k of tran&s;porting them is ve|ry great. And I have no doubt, that the Farmers of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts would &s;oon find it to their advan|tage would they engage in this bu&s;ine&s;s. Their la|bors are often be&s;towed upon productions, not of one half the importance and value. For, although it is commendable in the Farmer to rai&s;e a portion of ev|ery article con&s;umed in his family, provided his lands can ea&s;ily be made to produce it; yet, a little patch of tobacco, or of pumpkins, ought not, year after year, to prevent the cultivation of a nur&s;ery: the profits of which, within the term of &s;even years, would be va&s;tly greater than could po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e from the cultivation of tho&s;e vegetables, in the &s;ame pe|riod and proportion.</P>

There have been many others of the like kind, on a larger &s;cale, and all very advantageous. One in particular &s;hall be mentioned.</P>
<P>About ten years ago, a very worthy gentleman in my neighbourhood, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a fine ta&s;te, and of an excellent judgment in the management of a nur|&s;ery, began the propagation of fruit and other trees: partly for his amu&s;ement, and partly for the u&s;e of his farm. Since which he has furni&s;hed a mo&s;t beau|tiful and exten&s;ive garden, with a rich and va&s;t vari|ety, from his own nur&s;eries: and now has an abun|dance of the fine&s;t apples, plumbs, peaches, apricots, cheries, &amp;c. From &s;o great a number of young and thrifty trees, bearing and coming on to bear, one can &s;carcely pretend to gue&s;s at the quantity of fruit which they will yield in the period of four, or five years more.</P>
<P><HI>[The following account is taken from his Gardener.]</HI></P>
<P>"In the &s;pring of the year, 1790, when I engaged in the &s;ervice of E. H. D. <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> his gardens were not &s;o exten&s;ive as they now are; and his nur&s;ery was &s;mall, compared with what it is at pre&s;ent. But lit|tle was done in it that year. Some apple, pear, and fruit trees were planted; and a collection of &s;eeds made for the following year: in which, apple, pear, plumb, apricot, peach, cherry, mulberry, elm, button
<PB N="18" REF="030307_0017_0FE5B0626BA04238">wood &s;eeds, &amp;c. were &s;owed, all of which have fully an&s;wered the expectations of the proprietor, and of the be&s;t judges of propagating the&s;e kinds of trees. Yearly additions have been made to this nur&s;ery, and it now takes up nearly one acre and one quarter of land. The whole of the expence be&s;towed upon it, from 1790 to 1795, does not exceed, in my opinion, the &s;um of forty pounds. And this year, trees have been taken from it, and &s;old, to that amount: and had there been enough of a &s;uitable age and growth, for tran&s;planting, one hundred pounds worth might have been di&s;po&s;ed of. Not to mention the great number of trees taken out of this nur&s;ery, to &s;upply the proprietor's own gardens, and tho&s;e pre&s;ented to his friends, it now contains more than two thou&s;and of button wood trees, five years from the &s;eeds, and from &s;eedlings brought from the town of Boyl&s;ton, one thou&s;and of which are more than &s;even feet high, and which are to be removed next &s;pring, to a &s;uita|ble &s;ituation, for the purpo&s;e of a woodlot for the u&s;e of his farm. Including the&s;e, there are now in this nur&s;ery about fourteen thou&s;and trees; many of them are &s;mall, and have not been inoculated. I e&s;timate them on an average, at &s;ix pence: and at this low price the value of them will be THREE HUNDRED and FIFTY POUNDS, the nett proceeds, on profits of one acre and one quarter of land improved in this way. For, the trees which have been taken up and di&s;tributed on the farm, with tho&s;e which have been given away, would more than pay the rent of the land, and the expence of fencing it. And it ought to be ob&s;erved, that a very con&s;i|derable portion of the labor be&s;towed on this nur&s;ery, might have been performed at times when little el&s;e could have been done."</P>
<P>Here we &s;ee the exertions and rewards of indu&s;try
<PB N="19" REF="030307_0018_0FE5B063FA299E30">in the cultivation of a nur&s;ery. And one would think that this example would be followed by many atten|tive and judicious Farmers among us. But if it &s;hould not, this is certain, viz. that it is an example of great indu&s;try, and well worthy the attention of the public.</P>
<P>But it may be ob&s;erved, that if Farmers in general &s;hould attend to the cultivation of fruit trees they would &s;oon become plenty, and be of little value. To determine this matter, let them con&s;ider, how great a number of their neighbours, and who might rai&s;e corn in plenty, do neverthele&s;s neglect to cultivate &s;o much of it as would &s;upply their families, although bread is the &s;taff of life. Good hu&s;bands only will be the rivals of tho&s;e who may engage in the propagation of fruit trees. And this will give tho&s;e who engage in the bu&s;ine&s;s, two chances at lea&s;t, out of three, in favor of a ready market for their productions of this kind. And be&s;ides, old orchards are mouldering away; new farms are rapidly increa&s;ing; and a country without bounds is daily &s;oliciting a &s;upply from the nur&s;ery. When nur&s;eries were numerous; when orchards, now decayed and pa&s;t bearing, were in their full &s;trength and vigor; and when money was very &s;carce&mdash;even then&mdash;forty years ago, appletrees from the nur&s;ery would fetch eight pence each; and there is no great probability that they will ever be much cheaper in this State.</P>

<HEAD>The advantages of an Orchard.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we &s;urvey the country around us, of which our indu&s;trious Ance&s;tors took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion about one century and an half ago, we &s;ee the ruins of ma|ny once beautiful and flouri&s;hing orchards: and we are &s;urprized that their de&s;cendants have endeavored no more to counteract tho&s;e ravages of time, by re|placing the labors of their hands. To excu&s;e this negligence it has been ob&s;erved, that young orchards will not &s;ucceed on tho&s;e lands from which old ones have been removed; though peartrees will, and la&s;t for more than one generation. But if this ob&s;erva|tion be ju&s;t, and it is more than probable that it may be, for large trees mu&s;t impoveri&s;h the ground on which they grow, there is &s;carcely any con&s;iderable farm on which &s;ome new &s;ituation may not be found on which to place an orchard. Any &s;outhea&s;t pro&s;|pect, or an hill dripping towards the &s;outh, which is a mo&s;t excellent &s;ituation, or even the &s;ides of roads and fences around pa&s;tures and mowing lands, will an&s;wer very well. Trees thus placed will yield a great plenty of fruit; increa&s;e the gra&s;s; afford a comfort|able &s;helter for cattle, and be highly ornamental. It would be judicious to propagate a large proportion of &s;weet apples: as they afford a rich repa&s;t for the table of the Farmer; are equal in value to any other apples for cyder; and will almo&s;t fatten &s;heep and &s;wine. One would imagine, that the profits and plea&s;ures ari&s;ing from an orchard, would &s;timulate the Rarmer to propagate the appletree; but in noth|ing,
<PB N="21" REF="030307_0020_0FE5B071F6887EB8">perhaps, has the pre&s;ent generation been more deficient. Many farms on which &s;carcely an apple is now to be &s;een, abounded with tho&s;e of the fir&s;t quali|ty fifty years ago. Cyder was then &s;o plenty that it would not fetch more than two or three &s;hillings, at the pre&s;s, per barrel; nor more than five or &s;ix in the market. In that part of the country in which the writer then lived, about a dozen miles from Bo&s;ton, apples, pears, plumbs, cherries and peaches were exceeding plenty. Boys were &s;eldom or never known to rob fruit trees of any kind: and the poor had only to a&s;k and gather what they wanted. I know of no tree in this country which produces a greater variety of fruit; &s;carcely any two, unle&s;s grafted, or innoculated, being of the &s;ame ta&s;te and flavor, which can be u&s;ed in a greater variety of ways, and pre&s;erved for a longer &s;pace of time, than that which I am recommending. In bloom the ap|pletree makes a mo&s;t beautiful appearance, and the fruit of it, even in its crude &s;tate, affords an agreea|ble tart. Although it is &s;aid by naturali&s;ts, that the crab is the poore&s;t of all apples, they differ in many e&s;&s;ential re&s;pects from each other. Some are ripe in July, and highly agreeable to the palate: others are mature in Augu&s;t, and in September; and &s;o on, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, 'till late in October, when all come to perfection, and there is the greate&s;t variety and a|bundance. While &s;ome are mo&s;t excellent for pyes, and others for &s;auce, a greater proportion are for eat|ing; and may be pre&s;erved through the winter, with no other expence than barreling, or boxing them up: and all of them may be converted into a very whole|&s;ome, vinous liquor, which will keep through the whole of the year. But &s;ome have ob&s;erved, that appletrees are liable to fro&s;ts, worms, catterpillars, &amp;c. and therefore they neglect the propagation of them.
<PB N="22" REF="030307_0021_0FE5B074999D6B38">Apply this rea&s;oning to flax, barley, and to corn: &s;hall we neglect the&s;e things becau&s;e they are &s;ubject to fro&s;ts, worms, mildews, and the like evils? It is true, that apples are not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary as bread; but they are very grateful and profitable. If only one tree out of twenty &s;et out by the farmer, &s;hould flouri&s;h and bear fruit, within twenty years after the propagation of it, he will receive a tenfold reward for all his expence and trouble. Let your appletrees be carefully planted out; well &s;ecured from &s;heep and cattle; and judici|ou&s;ly grafted; then you may comfort your&s;elf with the reflection, that you have laid the foundation of that wealth which will grow and increa&s;e as you ad|vance in years, and eventually de&s;cend to your chil|dren. Could I name a certain tree, which would grow rapidly; and extend its branches far and wide; and which would la&s;t for a century or more; and that this tree within le&s;s than a dozen years after the &s;eeds of it had been &s;owed, would &s;tart up and bear a multi|tude of little &s;ilver pieces, equal in value to the &s;ixteenth or even the &s;ixtieth part of a dollar, would you not endea|vor to propagate that tree? Why, then, can you not be per&s;uaded that all the profits of this tree may be re|alized, if you will cultivate the appletree? Although the fruit of this tree is another kind of property, and differs in appearance from tho&s;e little pieces of &s;il|ver, it will as certainly produce them, as if the tree it&s;elf had borne them. Whatever you cultivate, and which produces &s;ilver, is the &s;ame in point of profit, as &s;ilver it&s;elf.</P>
<P>There is one con&s;ideration more on this &s;ubject, and which may not be unworthy of your attention. Many Farmers who hire a number of laborers are o|bliged thereby to pay a very heavy tax, to which their forefathers were entire &s;trangers. I mean the expence incurred by RUM, and which is more prejudicial to
<PB N="23" REF="030307_0022_0FE5B0762D329A38">their intere&s;ts than fro&s;ts and caterpillars are to their orchards. And I can &s;ee no way of with&s;tanding this growing evil, but through the influence and increa&s;e of CYDER. When this liquor was plenty, and when good &s;mall beer held a re&s;pectable place in the Farmer's cellar, the be&s;t of laborers&mdash;men who would reap, or hoe an acre per day, in light land, and go home at night contented with their wages, were ready to be hired&mdash;there were enough of the&s;e characters wi&s;hing to work, and the Farmer had not to court them into his &s;ervice. And I have no doubt, was cyder as plenty, and good &s;mall beer in as much reputation in the&s;e days, as they were fifty or &s;ixty years ago, Farmers would &s;oon experience an altera|tion in their favor. The man who will not labor chearfully and faithfully when he has victuals enough, and good cyder and beer, is not worth his keeping. If then, you would reap the above profits and plea|&s;ures, and rid your&s;elf of this needle&s;s and burthen|&s;ome tax, cultivate the appletree; and endeavor to excel in the quantity and quality of your cyder, which is annually increa&s;ing in value.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e by ob&s;erving, that every apple tree in|crea&s;es the value of the farm on which it grows. Tho&s;e farms on which good orchards are placed will commonly be in demand, and greatly preferred to tho&s;e which have none. Indeed a judicious man will not readily buy a farm which has no orchard on it; becau&s;e it wants one e&s;&s;ential advantage; more e&s;pecially if it be near a market town. A young and flouri&s;hing orchard, has rendered many an old and worn-out farm &s;aleable.</P>

<HEAD>The management of Cyder.</HEAD>
<P>MANY Farmers who &s;pare no expence nor labor in preparing their pork, veal and mutton in the be&s;t manner, with the view of obtaining the highe&s;t prices for tho&s;e articles, pay very little attention to another equally as important a part of their produce; and which would well reward them for all their cares and pains be&s;towed upon it; I mean cyder. That which is &s;weet and good, will fetch one &s;ixth part more at lea&s;t, than that which is four and ordinary. This mu&s;t be an object to the Farmer, even when he has but one or two tons to di&s;po&s;e of: and when he has three, or four times that quantity to &s;ell, it becomes of great importance to him. If his lot is ca&s;t with|in eight or ten miles of a market town, this &s;ixth part will almo&s;t defray the expences of carting the whole. And this kind of cyder will meet with a rea|dy &s;ale: the man who offers it, will not be obliged to &s;tand a great many hours in the heat of the day, per|haps, in fly time, or in a &s;torm, and after all his anxiety, and the &s;ufferings of his cattle, to court a chapman. And whatever the feelings of tho&s;e may be, who regard neither the quality of the article they have for &s;ale, nor the trouble and artifice they are o|bliged to &s;ubmit to, in order to di&s;po&s;e of it, the Far|mer who knows that his meat, meal, cyder, &amp;c. are really good, when he &s;hall hear them commended and receive a generous price for them, will enjoy the approbation of his own heart and go home rejoicing. It mu&s;t be of as much advantage to a Farmer, as it is to a merchant, or to a mechanic, to e&s;tabli&s;h and
<PB N="25" REF="030307_0024_0FE5B07E354592C0">&s;upport a reputable and good character. But, that good cyder may be more common, and that tho&s;e Farmers who have orchards may be benefited by this publication, let them attend to the following directions, communicated by a re&s;pectable Gentleman: and who, for a number of pa&s;t years has experienced the utility of them.</P>
<P>"Let the Farmer who wi&s;hes to have the cleare&s;t, &s;weete&s;t and be&s;t of cyder, &s;ee that his apples are fully ripe, and perfectly &s;ound before they are ground. And two or three days after the cyder has been well made in the common way, and before it begins to ferment, let him take out the head of a ca&s;k which will contain one hundred gallons, and &s;et it upright, with a faucet or plug placed in it near the bottom. Then let him empty his barrels into it, and grate one quarter of a pound of chalk into the liquor: let it be &s;tirred with a &s;tick, the end of which has been broomed, until it begins to ferment. Then let it &s;tand for two, or three days, according as the weather may be, when all the pomace will ri&s;e and float on the top of the li|quor. Then let it be drawed off into ca&s;ks perfectly &s;weet and new, for bad ca&s;ks will &s;poil the be&s;t cyder if put into them, and let it &s;tand without giving it vent, 'till the beginning of February following, when it mu&s;t be racked off. Cyder, naturally good and managed in this way, is equal, in the opinion of many Gentlemen, to &s;mall wines; and will always fetch a generous price in the market. If it &s;hould not be per|fectly clear in the &s;pring, after it is racked off, take a pound of good coar&s;e &s;ugar, with two or three eggs, break them into the &s;ugar, &s;hells and all, &amp; add to them half a pint of fine &s;and; beat them well together; put them into the barrel of cyder; &s;tir the liquor with a broomed &s;tick, until it &s;hall be found to fer|ment
<PB N="26" REF="030307_0025_0FE5B0ACAD19CE90">powerfully; and within ten or twelve days after this operation, it will be fit to be bottled."</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e this paper by ob&s;erving, that there may be a very great advantage derived from grafting fruit of the apple kind, even when the orchard is intended for cyder only; provided a number of trees be &s;et with one kind of fruit, and a number with another kind, and &s;o on: for all the&s;e different kinds will have their &s;everal periods of perfection; and may be made into cyder as they become ripe. This is not the ca&s;e with ungrafted apples: in their natural &s;tate, and taken promi&s;cuou&s;ly as is common, &s;ome will be crude, or not ripe, &s;ome in perfection, and &s;ome rot|ten ripe; and from &s;uch a collection good cyder can|not rea&s;onably be expected.</P>
<P>To give a fine amber, or curious color to cyder, not naturally &s;o, let it lay in the promace fifteen or twenty hours, before it is put into the vat or chee&s;e to be pre&s;&s;ed, and take care that no water comes near it.</P>

<HEAD>Keeping a Day Book.</HEAD>
<P>BOTH merchants and mechanics are greatly in|debted to their books of accounts, for information and &s;ucce&s;s in the &s;everal branches of their bu&s;ine&s;s, by re|gular and correct entries. The tran&s;action of every day &s;hould be correctly noted. The time when you plough, &s;ow, plant, mow, pull flax, cut fuel, gather corn, potatoes, &amp;c. and the quantity and quality of manure laid on each field, &s;hould be carefully notic|ed. You will then know the &s;ea&s;on when labor mu&s;t be done the next year, in tho&s;e fields, and the kinds and proportions of manure required to dre&s;s them. Farmers &s;hould weigh all their pork, beef, butter and cheefe; and mea&s;ure all their grain, corn, potatoes, &amp;c. and indeed, every article they lay up for winter; and al&s;o the time when they kill their creatures and the food on which they were fatted. This will &s;hew the quantity they con&s;ume, what, and how much of each article, and how much they may have to di&s;po&s;e of. Days on which they hire labor|ers; the labor performed on tho&s;e days, and the price paid for that labor, &s;hould be entered. This will &s;hew what time and labor mu&s;t be performed the next year, the price of it, and the money which may be wanted to carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s of the farm. Every farmer &s;hould mark the day on which his cows, mares, &amp;c. a&s;&s;ociate with the males of their &s;everal kinds; he will then be able to provide proper room, &amp;c. for the reception of their young and to attend to their keeping in due &s;ea&s;on, and which ought to be a little better then common, at tho&s;e periods.
<PB N="28" REF="030307_0027_0FE5B08170225788">For want of this attention, multitudes of calves, lambs, pigs, &amp;c. are annually lo&s;t. The ages of lambs, calves, colts, &amp;c. &s;hould be carefully noted, and the weight of them when killed; as this will point out tho&s;e ewes, cows, &amp;c. which are be&s;t for breeders; which is a very material branch of knowledge, in regard to the growth and value of a &s;tock of cat|tle. In &s;hort, the Farmer &s;hould note the bu&s;ine&s;s of every day, how and where he pa&s;t it, and what the weather was; and he &s;hould not forget, that &s;o much of the goodne&s;s of his crops depends upon early and &s;ea&s;onable cultivation, that he had better give any price for labor than be belated; more depends on this than farmers in general &s;eem to be &s;en&s;ible of. Flax, &s;owed early, will have a better coat, and more &s;eed than when &s;owed late. Barley &s;owed early will not be liable to bla&s;t and mildue; and indian corn planted and hoed in good &s;ea&s;on, will not be &s;o liable to &s;uf|fer from drought, and from fro&s;ts, and will be fuller and heavier, than when planted late, poorly ploughed, and indifferently hoed. Gra&s;s land on which manure is &s;pread early, will yield a much better crop, than if &s;pread late, and <HI>one</HI> load of gra&s;s, cut when ripe, and before it withers and turns white in the field, will be of more value than <HI>two</HI> loads of the &s;ame kind, cut after it is ripe, dried away and weatherbeaten: it has lo&s;t its juices in this &s;tate, which is all that is valuable. Our &s;ummers are &s;o &s;hort, that every po&s;|&s;ible advantage &s;hould be taken for early cultivation: for negligence and inattention in the &s;pring, will cer|tainly be followed by cold and hunger of the follow|ing winter.</P>
<P>But to return. A Farmer &s;hould keep a careful entry of all his fodder; the quantity and quality of each kind: for, he may wi&s;h to purcha&s;e and winter a cow or two extraordinary&mdash;and an account of the
<PB N="29" REF="030307_0028_0FE5B08301C0BEE8">manure made by his &s;wine, by &s;craping of the roads, his yards, by mud, barn dung, &amp;c. for, this will &s;how him at once, how much land to break up, and the &s;trength he will have for the next year's cul|tivation: if he neglects this branch of good hu&s;band|ry, he cannot expect to form a ju&s;t e&s;timate, either of the labor or profits of the next year. To avail him&s;elf of many of the advantages which &s;tand con|nected with his &s;itutation and farm, he mu&s;t attend to the&s;e things, many of which may appear of little or of no con&s;equence in the eyes of the ma&s;s of farm|ers; but they certainly de&s;erve their very &s;erious at|tention. Laborers, unle&s;s upon &s;ome urgent occa&s;ions, &s;hould never be hired by the month, nor even for a &s;ingle day, in the winter &s;ea&s;on; when the days are &s;hort, cold and &s;tormy, and when an indu&s;trious man can hardly earn his living. The quantity of pork, beef, cyder and other provi&s;ions expended, in other words, almo&s;t thrown away, by this imprudent prac|tice, will certainly be mi&s;&s;ed, and &s;everely felt in the following &s;pring and &s;ummer; unle&s;s and additional &s;tock of each be laid up to &s;upport it in the fall pro|ceeding. The farmer may hire labor in the &s;pring, to get a good crop in the ground in due &s;ea&s;on; in the &s;ummer, to &s;ecure his gra&s;s; and in the fall of the year, to gather in his harve&s;t; but not in the winter, when nothing can be rai&s;ed, either for the u&s;e of man or bea&s;t.</P>
<P>And here I ob&s;erve, that every Farmer &s;hould en|deavour to cultivate and take care of his own lands; and not let the profits of them depend on hirelings more than he cannot po&s;&s;ibly avoid. And he &s;hould never work within door, while any thing can be done to advantage without; nor &s;et him&s;elf, or his laborers, to that work in fair, which can be done in foul weather.</P>

<HEAD>Contracting Debts.</HEAD>
<P>A FARMER, as his lands yield but one crop in a year, and as the proceeds of that cannot be received 'till late in the fall, or the winter, &s;hould take as lit|tle as po&s;&s;ible on credit: for of all that he rai&s;es he will have but little to &s;pare, unle&s;s he deprives his family of &s;ome of the comforts and conveniences of their lives. It will take a con&s;iderable proportion of a large &s;tock of cattle, as they ri&s;e, to rai&s;e even an hundred dollars, in common times; and the&s;e are the only times on which he ought to form his calcu|lations. What by over dry, or by otherwi&s;e unpro|fitable &s;ea&s;ons, he &s;hould bear in mind, that every &s;eventh or eighth year, will be but indifferent in point of profit; and on which all his exertions will but ju&s;t render his family comfortable. In&s;tead, therefore, of &s;pending all, in years of plenty, he &s;hould endeavor to lay up &s;omething, again&s;t tho&s;e days of &s;carcity. Debts may, &s;oon be contracted, and to a ruinous a|mount, if care be not taken to avoid them. When a Farmer owes his merchant, his &s;choolma&s;ter, la|borers, &amp;c. and when he has paid them all off, he will find that a very con&s;iderable part of his crops are di&s;po&s;ed of and gone. And he ought to reflect, when he lays him&s;elf under pecuniary obligations to his neighbors, that &s;ome of them are entirely igno|rant of his re&s;ources, and of the only &s;ea&s;on in which he can conveniently di&s;charge them. A man who never &s;ows, thinks not of the time for reaping. Creditors may call for their monies, when it will not
<PB N="31" REF="030307_0030_0FE5B08B73663400">be in his power to &s;atisfy them, without making a mo&s;t injurious &s;acrifice of his &s;tock, or &s;ome other things&mdash;they may call when his crops are on the grounds; or in the &s;pring, before they are put into the earth; and when all his indu&s;try and labor can|not &s;ave him. It is greatly to the di&s;advantage of any man to be in debt, mo&s;t commonly, and to no man more, perhaps, than to the Farmer. But here, I expect the Farmer will ob&s;erve that there are &s;o many temptations, and that &s;uch is the fa&s;hion of the times at pre&s;ent, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for him to keep clear of debts. I acknowledge and la|ment the truth of his ob&s;ervation: but there are remedies at hand, with which to counteract the&s;e e|vils. A good &s;hare of prudence, and a manly &s;pirit of &s;elf-denial, will &s;ecure him, at all times, again&s;t them. Let him, in the fir&s;t place, guard again&s;t the cry of good bargains, for, it has often been the ca&s;e, that men, for a little and convenient piece of land, have paid very dear. Either the day of pay|ment was not duly con&s;idered, and provided for; or the &s;oil did not an&s;wer their expectations&mdash;was not rich, well &s;enced and watered; or it was a purcha&s;e beyong their ability. Again, the Farmer &s;ees his neighbour, not more wealthy in lands, &s;tock, or ready money, than him&s;elf, mounted on an excellent hor&s;e, or riding in an elegant chai&s;e quite at his ea&s;e and plea&s;ure; while he has but an ordinary creature, both for his own, and for his wife's accommodation; and feels him&s;elf mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly affected. Pride, or a de&s;ire of appearing to an equal advantage, &s;teps in at once to the relief of his mortified feelings, and he immediately re&s;olves to excel, or at lea&s;t to equal him in outward appearance. But before he takes a &s;ingle &s;tep in this weighty affair, he ought to con&s;ider the age and circum&s;tances of the man who he wi&s;hes
<PB N="32" REF="030307_0031_0FE5B08D06BCDA80">to rival. He may be an older man than him, and have labored more years; he may have been more in|du&s;trious, careful and oeconomical; or his family may not have been &s;o large and expen&s;ive&mdash;he may have more &s;ons,&mdash;po&s;&s;e&s;s better faculties, and know how to &s;ave in one thing, what he expends extra in anoth|er. And if he has labored more years, and taken bet|ter care of his lands, crops, &s;tock, manure, &amp;c. he may well ride while others go on foot who have not paid an equal attention to their farms. But if he had not labored more years than you had&mdash;had no pecu|liar advantages above you, nor been a better hu&s;band, and you cannot afford to buy an elegant hor&s;e, or a fine chai&s;e, the man de&s;erves your pity, rather than your envy. Con&s;ider this matter, and how painful the reflections ari&s;ing from it, after a few years of gay and fla&s;hy appearance, to be turned out of doors, and to leave your wife and children to the cold hand of charity! Surely, this mu&s;t operate again&s;t the pa&s;&s;ion you wi&s;h to indulge; get the better of all the&s;e idle and fooli&s;h &s;en&s;ations; render you quite ea|&s;y, although you &s;ee your neighbours finer than you are, and lead you to avoid all needle&s;s and ruinous expences.</P>
<P>It is true, there is a peculiar plea&s;ure in appearing, and living equal to tho&s;e of our rank and &s;tation, and which we hardly know how to relinqui&s;h; but it is much wi&s;er to &s;acrifice a little, yea a great deal to our feelings, than to be reduced to dependence. Nothing, indeed, can exceed the folly of tho&s;e, who live beyond their &s;tated incomes, and who are ambi|tious to maintain an appearance, without the means with which to do it.</P>
<P>Let it therefore be the de&s;ire of the Farmer, to cultivate and improve the &s;oil on which he lives, with the greate&s;t attention, and to confine his expences to
<PB N="33" REF="030307_0032_0FE5B08EE2BD0548">the annual income of his lands. This will &s;ave him from the pains of many an anxious and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing hour as he pa&s;&s;es along through life, and &s;often his pillow, when in the hour of death.</P>

<HEAD>Cloathing and Diet.</HEAD>
<P>THE earth is the parent of us all: her brea&s;ts are inexhau&s;tible: the Farmer is her fir&s;t born: and yet, how often does he forfeit her ble&s;&s;ing! Every man who tills the ground, and who endeavours not to live, as much as po&s;&s;ible, upon the productions of his own labor, is guilty of this extravagance. The Merchant may indulge in foreign luxuries, may eat, drink and wear, &s;uch articles as are not the growth and manufacture of his own country, as he imports them, and as they come cheaper to him, than to tho&s;e who buy of him, and con&s;ume the greater part of them. And the Mechanic, from his profe&s;&s;ion, is <HI>obliged</HI> to live upon the productions of other men's labors; but the Farmer is the mo&s;t independent man in the world, as he may rai&s;e every article for his own con&s;umption&mdash;bread, milk, pork, beef, butter and chee&s;e, potatoes, wool, flax, cyder, beer,&mdash;and what other good things can he then &s;tand in need of? you will &s;ay, perhaps, a little coffee, a little tea, &s;ugar, rum, &amp;c. I acknowledge, that tho&s;e little things, all but the la&s;t mentioned, may now and then be in|dulged in; provided the Farmer, and his family, will be contented to perform a con&s;iderable portion of ex|traordinary labor, and to u&s;e the&s;e things more oeconomically, or &s;paringly, through the year. For rum, freely u&s;ed, will &s;oon reduce, and render poor, the mo&s;t wealthy Farmer. If he &s;hould expend but one gallon per week, from the &s;pring to the la&s;t of autumn, &s;even months only&mdash;it will form a direct
<PB N="35" REF="030307_0034_0FE5B09341C28BD8">tax, of &s;ix or &s;even pounds; and which is more, perhaps, than all his &s;tate, county, town and pari&s;h taxes put together. I have &s;aid a <HI>direct</HI> tax; and it often proves as heavy an evil <HI>indirectly:</HI> that is to &s;ay, it takes time to run to the &s;hops for it; it takes time to &s;it and chat over it; and it takes time to re|cover from the baneful effects of it. For, it gradu|ally impairs the &s;trength, as it weakens the powers of the &s;tomach, and eventually brings on premature old age, to &s;ay nothing of the manifold contentions and quarrels excited by the u&s;e of it. I am now &s;peak|ing of this article, u&s;ed to exce&s;s, as it is but too commonly. In hot and &s;ultry weather, a moderate portion of it, well diluted, &s;ix parts, at lea&s;t, out of &s;even, with water, when the laborer is greatly fatigued, exceeding thir&s;ty, and compelled to drink immode|rately, may not be prejudicial: but even then, good cyder, and malt liquors, are much better, and more &s;alutary, both for the body and pur&s;e of the Farmer. Our fathers tilled the ground without it, were &s;trong and vigorous, left their farms unmortgaged, and died in a good old age. I wi&s;h I could &s;ay, that their de|&s;cendants had not acquired very different habits, not a little unhappy for them&s;elves and for their children. When men of &s;ixty, or of &s;eventy years of age, re|collect the days of their youth, they cannot but re|member, how ea&s;y and independent their fathers pa&s;t their days. When the Collector or Tax-gatherer came, and which was &s;eldom oftener than once in a year, to receive their &s;everal a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, he commonly 05 found them laid up and ready for him.&mdash;It was al|mo&s;t &s;candalous in tho&s;e who obliged him to call a &s;econd time for his due; and as to tho&s;e per&s;ons who were compelled by a cour&s;e of law to pay their ju&s;t debts, they fell into open and great di&s;grace thereby.
<PB N="36" REF="030307_0035_0FE5B094CFB48200">And to what was this owing&mdash;to what cau&s;es, under GOD, were they indebted for their freedom, ea&s;e and independence, but their indu&s;try, and care again&s;t contracting debts for luxuries, and for things not ne|ce&s;&s;ary; and to their making it an irrevocable rule, not to eat, drink nor wear &s;carcely any thing which was not rai&s;ed on their farms, and which was not the fruit of their own labors. In tho&s;e days, when the rites of ho&s;pitality were peculiarly attended to, rum, tea, &amp;c. were hardly known: and the daughters of the mo&s;t wealthy and independent farmers, the mothers of many of the more re&s;pectable per&s;ons now living in the&s;e States, &s;eldom appeared in &s;ilks. And it would be highly advantageous to Farmers in the&s;e days, if they would endeavor to rai&s;e more on their lands for their own con&s;umption, and to buy le&s;s of unnece&s;&s;a|ry articles imported from abroad. That Farmer who has not money at intere&s;t, and who can only make both ends of the year meet by his own labors, before he purcha&s;es any &s;uperfluous article for his family, &s;hould look into his cellar, corn-barn, &amp;c. and con|&s;ider whether he has any, and how much grain, but|ter, chee&s;e, &amp;c. to &s;pare, over and above that portion which mu&s;t be di&s;po&s;ed of, to pay his laborers, taxes, and a number of incidental demands. Let him re|flect upon the toil and labor tho&s;e articles have co&s;t him, which he will acknowledge to be very con&s;ide|rable, and more than enough to convince him of their value and importance. Let the extraordinary indu&s;try of the Farmer's daughters, with the profits of a good yard of poultry, bear &s;ome kind of pro|portion to the luxuries he purcha&s;es; and then he will not feel tho&s;e expen&s;es &s;o heavily, and his affairs will continue to wear a good a&s;pect.</P>

<HEAD>Engaging in Law-&s;uits.</HEAD>
<P>THE Farmers of New-England in general, are too apt to contend with each other in the law; and to refer, even the mo&s;t tri&s;ling controver&s;ies between them, to the deci&s;ions of Courts of Ju&s;tice.

For if they will attend to the fruits of this unhappy pa&s;&s;ion, they will &s;ee that but few, if any, have been benefited, while multitudes have been utterly ruined by it. So great are the unavoidable expen&s;es of time, coun&s;el, witne&s;&s;es, attendance, fees of officers, and &s;o many the vexations of mind, that in general, a man had better compound with his neighbor in a quiet and peaceable manner, and give him his coat, although he had previou&s;ly taken away his cloak, than &s;ubmit to the manifold evils which may po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e from a proce&s;s in law.

Doubtle&s;s there may be &s;uch cha|racters: but if you know them, it mu&s;t be your own fault, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, if difficulties ari&s;e between you and them. It is imprudent to have any great

<HEAD>Good Neighborhood.</HEAD>
<P>IT will contribute not a little to the intere&s;t and the comfort of the Farmer, to keep up a good corre&s;|pondence with his neighbors: and to do this, he mu&s;t keep good fences, orderly cattle, and borrow as little as po&s;&s;ible. A great part of the contentions which have taken place among neighbors in the country, &s;ome of which have been carried to the mo&s;t &s;erious and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing length, will be found, upon ex|amination, to have originated in poor fences, unruly cattle, and borrowing. A principal object with eve|ry good Farmer, is the &s;ecurity of his crops; and when he has been at great pains and expence in enclo|&s;ing his lands on his own part; and his neighbor's cattle, &s;heep or &s;wine, break in and de&s;troy the fruits of his labors, through the inattention he has paid to his part of the &s;ame, it will give him not a little un|ea&s;ine&s;s: and repeated inroads, from the &s;ame cau&s;e, will bring on a coldne&s;s, and lead him, at length, to &s;eek a redre&s;s, through the di&s;agreeable and expen|&s;ive medium of law. One unruly ox, hor&s;e or &s;heep, has proved the ruin of all &s;ocial and friendly inter|cour&s;e, between tho&s;e who had long lived in the mo&s;t neighborly habits and familiarities; the advantages and plea&s;ure of which, ought not to have been haz|arded for five times the value of tho&s;e creatures. And many Farmers, though rich in lands, &s;pend more time in running to their neighbors after &s;aws, ham|mers, awls, hatchets, a few nails, and a little wire to ring an hog with, &amp;c. than would purcha&s;e all tho&s;e
<PB N="41" REF="030307_0040_0FE5B0A1CAC362E8">articles out right. It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that we are all dependen tupon each other, in a degree; and that every Farmer mu&s;t borrow, occa&s;ionally, or &s;uf|fer; but obligations of this kind do not ari&s;e one half &s;o often from nece&s;&s;ity, as from mere carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, and a want of a manlike attention to things. But if you mu&s;t borrow, take care le&s;t you abu&s;e the thing borrowed, and return it immediately after you have done with it; and never depend upon borrowing it, again and again, as many do, but con&s;ider with your|&s;elf, whether you cannot make, or afford to buy it. A farmer &s;hould endeavor, never to be de&s;titute of meat, meal, butter, chee&s;e, &amp;c. on any day in the year; and it is &s;carcely hone&s;t to live by wearing out his neighbours tools. But although he &s;hould avoid borrowing as much as po&s;&s;ible, he ought to be wil|ling to lend to every neighbor who would return the article lent, in good order, and as &s;oon as he &s;hould have done with it; and it is a breach of tru&s;t, or, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, great neglect in him not to do it. It often proves a great di&s;advantage to a Farmer, when he has one or two men in his &s;ervice, and is engaged in a piece of labor, to have one of his tools in this, and a|nother in that neighbors hands, he &s;carcely knows where to look for them&mdash;borrowed of him, perhaps &s;ix, or &s;even months before, and carried a mile or two out of his way; and which is not an uncommon ca&s;e. On this branch of the &s;ubject I &s;hall only ob&s;erve far|ther, that a man ought to lend to every neighbor, worthy of his confidence, whenever he reque&s;ts the favor, if he can &s;pare the article de&s;ired, and to bor|row of no man, but when pre&s;&s;ed by urgent ne|ce&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved, that bad fences, and unruly cat|tle, are often the cau&s;es of contention between neigh|bors,
<PB N="42" REF="030307_0041_0FE5993AD4F478B0">and to the&s;e fences we may add one or two more, viz. a difference in religious, and in political &s;enti|ments. In regard to the former, it is the privilege and duty of every man to determine for him&s;elf. And no man who lives "&s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly," can be a bad neighbor, under whatever donomina|tion of chri&s;tians, he chu&s;es to be con&s;idered. To de&s;pi&s;e &s;uch a man, and not to feel intere&s;ted in his welfare, and not to treat him with all the love and kindne&s;s due to a neighbour, although he calls him&s;elf a bapti&s;t, or a &s;ocinian, or an epi&s;copalian, indicates a narrow &amp; contracted mind. And the &s;ame ob&s;ervation may be applied in regard to the political &s;entiments of your neighbor; and who, &s;o long as he continues a quiet and peaceable &s;ubject of the government under which you both live, de&s;erves your re&s;pect and love and candor; although he does not engage in the in|tere&s;ts of the party, which you think proper to pa|tronize and e&s;pou&s;e. I only add, that the&s;e &s;ubjects de&s;erve a degree of attention, however trifling they may be con&s;idered by &s;ome? not only, as they may re&s;pect the happine&s;s of the pre&s;ent neighborhood in which you live; but as they may affect tho&s;e who may come after us: for, prejudices and opinion often de&s;cendt the third, and even to the fourth generation.</P>

<P>IT is in the power of almo&s;t every Farmer who lives in New-England, to be&s;tow &s;uch a degree of e|ducation on his children and apprentices, as will a|mount to common reading, writing and arithmetic. And greatly to the di&s;honor of the father of a family it mu&s;t be, when his offspring and others under his care, are found to be ignorant of the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary and important acqui&s;itions. And this is but one part of the charge again&s;t &s;uch a character: for, neglected through his inattention and want of care on this head, they them&s;elves are mo&s;t irreparably injured. It is like taking away a right eye, and cutting off the right arm from tho&s;e whom natural affection, every hour, admoni&s;hes him in the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive language, to guard, in&s;truct and fo&s;ter in his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider this matter in great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;After you are gone off the &s;tage of life, your &s;ons are to come forward and to tran&s;act the concerns of the public: They are to compo&s;e in part, the legi&s;lature of the land in which you now live; and to go through the &s;ame or a more important routine of the public &s;ervices than you have done. But this will be im|po&s;&s;ible unle&s;s they have received &s;uch a degree of &s;chola&s;tic education, at lea&s;t, as is commonly be&s;tow|ed; and which the public, in great wi&s;dom and gen|ero&s;ity offers to every one in this land of light and knowledge. Circum&s;tanced as they are, I can con|ceive of no apology for tho&s;e Farmers in New-Eng|land who do not endeavour to have their children and apprentices in&s;tructed in all the more common
<PB N="44" REF="030307_0043_0FE5B0A98D7ED198">and nece&s;&s;ary branches of knowledge; as the means afforded for the&s;e ends are as common as the manna was formerly, which fell round about the tent doors of the I&s;raelites: and of which heavenly food every man might freely gather as much as he wanted, or as much as was nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>And yet, through ignorance, covetou&s;ne&s;s, or &s;ome other inimical mean, the children of Farmers are of|ten brought up like the wild a&s;&s;es colt.</P>
<P>Let me reque&s;t you, who are parents and heads of families, and who are carele&s;s and unconcerned in re|gard to the in&s;truction and information of tho&s;e whom GOD has placed under you, to reflect upon your con|duct; and to con&s;ider how you will be able to an&s;wer for this criminal neglect to your&s;elves, to your coun|try, and to GOD. Con&s;ider the days of youthful in|nocence; in which the mind is ready to receive the mo&s;t u&s;eful impre&s;&s;ions; and in which, curio&s;ity, em|ulation, and a de&s;ire of plea&s;ing and excelling, are peculiarly influential: And if you wi&s;h to &s;ee your &s;ons u&s;eful, and your daughters re&s;pectable, give them &s;o much education at lea&s;t, as &s;hall qualify them for the common occupations and offices of the country in which you live.</P>
<P>Do we not &s;ay, "we &s;ee?" mu&s;t it not then be un|pardonable in us if we walk not agreeable to the light of which we boa&s;t, and do not endeavor to render, po&s;terity as wi&s;e and as happy as we our&s;elves are? Then let it never be &s;aid, that a man, or a woman born and brought up in New-England, can neither read nor write, nor knows any thing of the u&s;e and powers of figures. Allow your children time and opportunity for improving in all the common and more u&s;eful branches of knowledge. A learned ed|ucation is out of the que&s;tion: the writer is plead|ing only for that mea&s;ure of information which is re|ally
<PB N="45" REF="030307_0044_0FE5B0AB1C71C4D0">nece&s;&s;ary, and which you may, and are in duty bound to be&s;tow upon them. One would think it unnece&s;&s;ary to add any thing more on this &s;ubject: but it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve &s;till farther, that every Farmer ought to be qualified to keep and adju&s;t his own accounts; and which, although tri|fling in compari&s;on with tho&s;e of the Merchant, ought, neverthele&s;s, to be attended to with the great|e&s;t exactne&s;s, if he would do ju&s;tice to him&s;elf and to his neighbors, and avoid one very fruitful &s;ource of contention. I add further, that, as young people in general, when the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day is over, will be ready to engage in &s;ome pur&s;uits of intere&s;t or plea&s;ure, the &s;ous of tho&s;e Farmers who have been taught to read, write and cypher well, in&s;tead of &s;pending their evenings in idlene&s;s, or at taverns, may find a mo&s;t grateful and u&s;eful amu&s;ement, in the peru&s;al of &s;ome good author; in endeavoring to improve their hands in writing; or in revi&s;ing their pa&s;t labors in arithmetic. The fact is this, when there comes on a &s;tormy di&s;agreeable change of wea|ther, and when little or nothing can be done to ad|vantage on the farm, and many &s;uch days occur eve|ry year, a young man will not be at a lo&s;s how to employ tho&s;e lei&s;ure hours to advantage, and to find a mo&s;t agreeable amu&s;ement at home. The&s;e nece&s;|&s;ary accompli&s;hments of a common &s;chool education, have proved a &s;ource of innocent amu&s;ement to many, and been the means of pre&s;erving them from various temptations and misfortunes. Therefore, if you regard your own happine&s;s, the innocent amu&s;e|ments of your children, and their future u&s;efulne&s;s, and would guard them again&s;t the &s;nares of vice, give them a good common education, at lea&s;t.</P>

<P>AUTUMN. In this &s;ea&s;on cart out your &s;um|mer dung; and plough all your land to be &s;eeded the next &s;pring. One ploughing at this time, will an&s;wer for one in the &s;pring, when your team is feeble, and &s;ave &s;pring labor, which is very precious.</P>
<P>BARLEY ground &s;hould be ploughed twice, or three times&mdash;&s;owed early&mdash;two bu&s;hels to one acre&mdash; ploughed in immediately after &s;owing&mdash;no grain is harder to &s;prout; and none requires more ripening in the field.</P>
<P>BEES. Their hou&s;e is too well known to need a de&s;cription. In May and June they generally &s;end forth &s;warms; and to manage them on the&s;e occa|&s;ions, let your Bee hou&s;e be made &s;o tall as to admit three tier of hives, one above another. Let the hives be ten inches deep, and 12 or 14 broad. An under hive is made with a round hole through the top, of three inches diameter, covered with a &s;liding &s;hutter. One of the&s;e hives &s;hould be placed directly under an inhabited hive, before they are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;end out a new &s;warm. In&s;tead of &s;warming they will de&s;cend
<PB N="47" REF="030307_0046_0FE5B0AFB54FE360">into the hive below; and when that is full, let them find another beneath it; they will take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lowermo&s;t. They begin at the top and build downwards. When a hive is taken up, in&s;tead of de&s;troying the bees, drive in the &s;hutter, and run a long thin knife round, to part it from that which is below it: &s;lip the hive off upon a &s;mooth board, and carry it into your dwelling-hou&s;e, and open one of the windows of the room, after the hive is laid on its &s;ide. This mu&s;t be done in a cool morning, and when the &s;un gets up and the air grows warmer, the bees will quit the hive, and go into the hive next to the place whence they were taken. Tho&s;e bees which are found among the honey, &s;tiff and unable to fly, may be thrown into a tub of water: they will &s;oon recover their activity and go after their companions.</P>
<P>BURNETT grows well on the poore&s;t of ground. One acre will yield three loads of hay&mdash;cut it twice&mdash; forty bu&s;hels of &s;eed to an acre&mdash;better than oats for hor&s;es&mdash;the &s;traw, when thre&s;hed, better than com|mon hay. Burnett keeps green all the winter, and grows&mdash;no fro&s;t hurts it&mdash;may be cut and given to cattle in the &s;pring, as &s;oon as the &s;now is gone, they will eat it greedily. It may be u&s;ed fall and &s;pring, as long, and as &s;oon as the ground is bare. It would be proper to have pa&s;tures of it.</P>
<P>CABBAGES require moi&s;t, rich land. The later taken up the better, in a dry and windy day&mdash;&s;et them heads down, 'till carried into the cellar, and then heads up, and clo&s;e together, where they may have a little fro&s;t&mdash;warmth &s;oon de&s;troys them.</P>

<PB N="48" REF="030307_0047_0FE5B0B25CDCC370">weeks. After the fir&s;t fortnight, mix in &s;kimed milk, or hay tea, or meal and water. When they are a month old, place &s;ome &s;weet hay in cleft &s;ticks, and they will &s;oon learn to eat it. As &s;oon as gra&s;s is grown, turn them out&mdash;give them milk and water for a few days, and hou&s;e them for a few nights&mdash; they &s;hould be hou&s;ed early in the fall and kept warm in the winter.</P>
<P>CATTLE. If you mu&s;t pinch them, do it in the beginning, rather than in the clo&s;e of winter. They feel the fir&s;t coming of cold weather &s;everely; and the &s;pring may open early. It hurts them to graze in the winter&mdash;&s;hould be confined to the barn yard, and there watered&mdash;will &s;ave all their dung. They &s;hould be hou&s;ed in cold rains, which hurt them more than the &s;evere&s;t dry cold. To increa&s;e manure, &s;ome Farmers keep a numerous &s;tock; but the ju&s;t rule is this, no more cattle than will eat all your fodder. In general, one load of hay will make one load of dung. E&s;timate your dung by your fodder.</P>
<P>CARROTS, &s;ow on &s;andy, or loamy land&mdash; plough, or dig 12 inches deep&mdash;&s;ow la&s;t week in April. A little dung &s;ufficient to dre&s;s the ground&mdash; will yield abundantly&mdash;good for fattening cattle, &s;wine and &s;heep.</P>
<P>CLOVER will grow on any &s;oil&mdash;dry, &s;andy, loamy, or gravelly&mdash;bears drought better than any other gra&s;s, as it comes forward early, and has a long tap root. Sow ten pounds to an acre&mdash;in England they &s;ow twenty&mdash;you may bu&s;h, or plow it in&mdash;it requires le&s;s manure than any other gra&s;s&mdash;mow it in June, when the heads are about half turned, and in the morning. Spread, turn and rake it into cocks before night&mdash;next day, open, &s;pread and turn it once or twice, and cock it again; and let it &s;weat a
<PB N="49" REF="030307_0048_0FE5B0B3EB3D59E8">day, or two before hou&s;ing. This gra&s;s requires all your attention in making it&mdash;it enriches land&mdash;la&s;ts but two years, and is the only hay that will fat an hor&s;e without provender. It is mo&s;t excellent for &s;wine to feed on&mdash;one acre of rich land, well &s;et with it, will keep twenty hogs well, from the beginning of May, to the end of October, without any other food: and the &s;wine will enrich the land.</P>
<P>COLT, to break him, never &s;trike, but often lead him by the &s;ide of another hor&s;e, with a bridle. When he walks well, bring him to trot after him. Then lead him often in the &s;addle. Then put on a &s;mall weight, and gradually increa&s;e it. Then let one hold, and another mount him, and ride after another hor&s;e, in a ploughed field, 'till he learns the u&s;e of the bit, and will &s;top, or go on at your plea&s;ure. By this ea&s;y method you will break your colt, without breaking his &s;pirits.</P>
<P>COW. Great attention &s;hould be paid to &s;o pro|fitable a creature. At the lowe&s;t e&s;timate, her value mu&s;t be more than five pounds per annum. She &s;hould be milked morning and evening, at the &s;ame time in the day, as near as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;when near calv|ing, put her into a pen by her&s;elf&mdash;when calved, give her warm drink for the fir&s;t two days&mdash;if &s;he does not clean, give her a bucket of warm water, in which &s;ome wood a&s;hes have been put&mdash;card her gently du|ring the winter, 'till near the time of her calving, then cea&s;e. Keep no more cows than you can feed plentifully, both winter and &s;ummer. Rich pa&s;tures in &s;ummer, will afford an abundance of milk for but|ter and chee&s;e; and good keeping in winter, will give you fat calves in the &s;pring. Farrow cows &s;hould have corn as well as good hay, or milking them for twelve months will render them very thin
<PB N="50" REF="030307_0049_0FE5B0B5CBC69278">and poor. In very hot weather cows &s;hould be wa|tered three times in a day, and placed in &s;hady pa&s;|tures. Farmers &s;hould bear it in mind, that a far|row cow is not &s;o profitable by one third part, as one which calves annually.</P>
<P>CYONS, &s;hould be cut in February, or in March, and may be &s;tuck in moi&s;t mud, or in clay. They will keep two, or three months: but I prefer tho&s;e taken immediately from the tree. Avoid &s;uckers.</P>
<P>DUNG. There are &s;everal kinds of dung, as there are of &s;oils on which to lay it.</P>
<P>ASHES. Be&s;t for low, mo&s;&s;y lands, &s;pread even|ly on the ground. A few bu&s;hels, &s;owed ju&s;t before a rain, a good top dre&s;&s;ing for an acre&mdash;fifteen bu&s;hels a full dre&s;&s;ing&mdash;it will be &s;een for &s;everal years&mdash;peat a&s;hes be&s;t&mdash;fifteen bu&s;hels to an acre. DOOR DUNG for mellons&mdash;COW-DUNG for a warm, &s;andy &s;oil. HOGS-DUNG for flax, corn and po|tatoes, and for all kinds of vines. HORSE-DUNG for a low, wet &s;oil. HUMAN-ORDURE mixed with a great quantity of &s;oil, for cold, &s;our land, and for recruiting old pear-trees, SHEEP AND FOWLS DUNG, for a wet &s;our &s;oil. SLAUGH|TER-HOUSE-DUNG is very excellent. And be|&s;ide the&s;e &s;everal kinds of dung, there are other ma|nures, &s;uch as LIME, for a cold, &s;tiff clay &s;oil, 120 bu&s;hels to an acre&mdash;it de&s;troys mo&s;s&mdash;mixed with green &s;ward, in layers, the compo&s;ition will be &s;it for u&s;e in &s;ix months, in &s;ummer. URINE, OR STALE, is al&s;o excellent manure, and when &s;aved, of as much value nearly, as the dung it&s;elf of the &s;tock. And to &s;ave it in SUMMER, as &s;oon as your barn-yard is cleared out, in the &s;pring, take the fir&s;t lei&s;ure hour, and take care to find &s;uch an hour, to cart in a large quantity of loom, mud, clay, rubbi&s;h, broken peat,
<PB N="51" REF="030307_0050_0FE5B0BB37CB3FB8">or even &s;and; which will ab&s;orb the urine, and being mixed with the dung, make a mo&s;t excellent ma|nure. In winter, a great part of the &s;tale may be &s;aved, if you have a tight floor, by giving the cattle a plenty of litter: every night a fre&s;h layer of chaff, flax-dre&s;&s;ings, or whatever the barn affords. MUD from ponds, in the opinion of &s;ome Farmers, is e|qual to good dung for Indian-corn, planted on a dry, gravelly &s;oil: SEA-MUD al&s;o is very good; but all kinds of mud are better when laid in the barn-yard and trodden into the dung and &s;tale of the cat|tle. They &s;hould be &s;hovelled into heaps, and lay a few days before they are carried into the fields for u&s;e. Some Farmers have long and narrow cow-yards by the &s;ides of roads, or el&s;ewhere, in which they yard their cattle every night; and every two or three days, they plough them deep. This mixture of &s;oil, dung and &s;tale, is &s;aid to be equal to any manure which is made. It mu&s;t be very good for gra&s;s land, &s;pread as &s;oon as the crop is mowed off.</P>
<P>EWES. Breeders &s;hould have long and fine wool. From October fir&s;t, to November twentieth keep the males from them&mdash;feed them well for &s;ome days before yeaning. Let them have good feed from their fir&s;t going to pa&s;ture, 'till the middle of July&mdash; this will make fat lambs, and the ewes them&s;elves will be fit for market.</P>
<P>FLAX, a mo&s;t u&s;eful and profitable crop to the farmer&mdash;does be&s;t in moi&s;t land&mdash;at nine pence per pound, one acre will gain &s;ix pounds clear profit. After the ground is well manured with old and rot|ten cow-dung, or with the contents of the hog &s;tye, plough and mix the &s;oil well&mdash;it cannot be too much pulverized, and then, in early &s;ea&s;on, which will give the be&s;t coat to the flax, &s;ow from &s;even to eight pecks of &s;eed on an acre&mdash;fre&s;h and new &s;eed every
<PB N="52" REF="030307_0051_0FE5B0BD4AED12C8">year, and from a good di&s;tance, the crop will be the better. Pull it when the leaves are fallen from the &s;talk, and when they begin to have a bright yellow co|lor, and the bolls are ju&s;t beginning to have a brown|i&s;h ca&s;t. If you water rot it, pull it when the blo&s;|&s;oms are generally fallen. If you dew rot it, when it is done &s;ufficiently, the coat will &s;eparate from the &s;talk, at the &s;lender branching parts, near the top ends.</P>
<P>FOALS, &s;hould be fed when weaned, with &s;weet hay, oats and wheat bran. For the fir&s;t winter al|low one &s;ixteen bu&s;hels of oats; afterwards he will do with good hay. A late foal &s;hould not be wean|ed before March, and have oats all winter. Within one month after the foal is dropped, it receives its &s;hape, &amp;c. which it will ever after retain&mdash;you may then &s;ee your future hor&s;e in miniature.</P>
<P>FOWL-MEADOW GRASS does be&s;t on low lands, &s;wamps, &amp;c.&mdash;keeps green a long time&mdash;bears a great burden&mdash;is excellent fodder, e&s;pecially for hor&s;es, and may be mowed, from la&s;t of July, to fir&s;t of October.</P>
<P>FODDERING &s;hould not take place 'till really nece&s;&s;ary; and then only in mornings.&mdash;The wor&s;t fodder &s;hould be given out in the colde&s;t weather.&mdash; Never lay &s;o much before your cattle as will &s;erve to fill them&mdash;fodder twice in the morning and twice in the evening. The leavings of horned cattle may be laid before hor&s;es, and the leavings of hor&s;es, before tho&s;e who divide the hoof; they will eat after each other. If any thing be left in the mangers of the cattle, carry it out into the open air, and &s;pread it on clean &s;now. Young and hardy &s;tock will winter well on coar&s;e meadow hay and &s;traw. Every farm yard &s;hould have a long &s;hed, and a rack under it, in which to fodder in a clean and profitable manner&mdash;
<PB N="53" REF="030307_0052_0FE5B0BED5FF7C28">very nece&s;&s;ary for &s;heep.</P>
<P>GOOSE more profitable than a dung-hill fowl. Pluck your goo&s;e but once in a year, and at moult|ing time, or when they &s;hed their quills.</P>
<P>GRAZEING. Kill gra&s;s fed beeves by the fir&s;t of November, for, after that the gra&s;s &s;oon lo&s;es &s;o much of its virtue, that it will not fatten cattle at all &mdash;they will fall away.&mdash;Vales for tillage, hill for pa&s;|ture.</P>
<P>HEMP requires a rich and well prepared &s;oil&mdash; bears drought well&mdash;plough deep in the fall&mdash;dung as for indian corn&mdash;&s;ow as early as the &s;ea&s;on and &s;oil will admit&mdash;&s;ow the la&s;t year's &s;eed, three bu&s;hels to an acre. On the la&s;t of July pull that which has the flowers on it, when growing yellow at the top, white at the root, and the leaves are withered. Put it into a pond, four or five days when it will be rot|ted enough: then &s;pread and dry it in the &s;un. Seed hemp is not ripe till five or &s;ix weeks after, when the &s;eeds turn brown: and which mu&s;t be combed out.</P>
<P>This hemp will require almo&s;t three times as much watering as the fir&s;t. It may be rotted and dre&s;&s;ed like flax: when ten, or twelve feet long it may be cut in the middle to make it handy for dre&s;&s;ing.&mdash; Stalks too thick for the break, may be pealed by hand. Hemp is a profitable crop; is liable to no di&s;ea&s;e, nor will any creature crop and eat it: and it will grow well in almo&s;t any northern climate.</P>
<P>FARM. One hundred acres of land are enough for one&mdash;a tenth of that tillage land&mdash;much le&s;s will do near a market town&mdash;&s;mall farms are be&s;t, when labor is dear&mdash;tho&s;e which afford a plenty of good &s;weet gra&s;s, be&s;t for a dairy.&mdash;Never over&s;tock your farm&mdash;this will prove a great lo&s;s to you&mdash;better have fodder left in the &s;pring, and lay over for another year&mdash;and if you feed clo&s;e, the &s;oil will &s;oon become bound.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="030307_0053_0FE5B0C0B3CB3B48">
HERDS-GRASS, as good and profitable as any, Grows well on any &s;oil, except &s;andy and gravelly, when mixed with clover, as that decrea&s;&s;es, this increa|&s;es, &s;o that the crop of gra&s;s will hold out for &s;everal years&mdash;cut it ju&s;t before it goes out of blo&s;&s;om, or a little &s;ooner.</P>
<P>HORSE, a good one, high neck, full brea&s;t, and a lively eye&mdash;&s;trong back, &s;tiff, dark, full buttocks, ribs reaching near to the hips, and rather large hoofs &mdash;&s;mall hor&s;e mo&s;t profitable: but large ones be&s;t for the chai&s;e and plough&mdash;hor&s;es are great eaters&mdash; require the be&s;t of hay and pa&s;tures&mdash;a &s;mall farm can hardly keep one&mdash;if he labors all &s;ummer &s;hould be fed with green gra&s;s mowed, and brought in a ba&s;ket, as he wants it&mdash;not &s;o much trouble as lead|ing him one quarter of a mile to pa&s;ture&mdash;a &s;mall &s;pot of long and thick gra&s;s, will feed him; for by the time the whole is mowed over, you may begin again. In this manner cows are fed all &s;ummer in &s;ome places; where the &s;oil is rich&mdash;it &s;aves all their dung, and they live well with very little pa&s;ture.&mdash; This is called SOILING of cattle&mdash;in this way, one acre will feed &s;everal cows.</P>
<P>INDIAN-CORN improves by &s;tanding in the field &s;o long as there is any moi&s;ture in the &s;talk, or even in the cob&mdash;&s;hould be harve&s;ted by the fir&s;t of November. When it ripens late, and is uncom|monly green, cut it up clo&s;e to the ground, and &s;et it up in &s;mall &s;hooks in the field; and it will ripen well, and take no damage. In a dry &s;ea&s;on hoe your corn in the morning and evening. Take your &s;eed out of the middle of your faire&s;t corn&mdash;plant no corns with black eyes&mdash;put twenty loads of dung on one acre, if &s;pread&mdash;eight or ten will do in the hole, and produce a tolerable crop.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="030307_0054_0FE5B0C704ECC1E8">
LAMBS, if they cannot come at the teat, cut a|way the wool and tags&mdash;if the ewe will not own him, &s;hut them up together, two or three days, in a clo&s;e pen. They &s;hould not be weaned till &s;even weeks old; and then have the be&s;t of pa&s;ture.</P>
<P>LANDS worn out by tillage, may be recruited by &s;even or eight years pa&s;turing, only ploughing and &s;owing clover, to be fed, not mowed off. Or you may turn up the green &s;ward, dung it and plant pota|toes the fir&s;t year.&mdash;Indian-corn, well dunged the &s;econd year&mdash;lay it down to clover the third year, for two years, plant potatoes the fourth year&mdash;flax &amp; corn the fifth year &mdash;and then clover. It is not judicious to take two crope of Indian-corn, following each other.</P>
<P>MARES for breeding, &s;hould be &s;trong, high &s;pirit|ed, well &s;haped, and of a good color&mdash;not breed before they are &s;even years old&mdash;go to the hor&s;e in the lat|ter part of June. When with foal, hou&s;ed early in the fall; fed well till they foal, and not u&s;ed for two, or three months before that time. They go eleven months, and as many days over that time, as the mare is years old.</P>
<P>MEADOWS mu&s;t not be fed late in the fall nor early in the &s;pring. Poor water gra&s;s &s;hould be cut rather before it is grown to its full length, it may be cut a &s;econd time.</P>
<P>MOWING late no advantage, as the days grow &s;horter, and heavies dews fall&mdash;but mow clo&s;e, or you will lo&s;e more than your wages every day you mow. Comeings, as they are called, are a di&s;grace and a lo&s;s to the Farmer. Cut the thicke&s;t gra&s;s fir&s;t; the thinne&s;t next; and then that which is middling&mdash; mow early in the morning, and late in the evening.</P>
<P>MOWING LAND when bound, if not con|venient to plough it, may receive a &s;evere harrowing. A top dre&s;&s;ing of old cow dung in the fall, or of oth|er
<PB N="56" REF="030307_0055_0FE5B0C8925B1CA8">dung in the &s;pring, bu&s;hed over to break it &s;mall, will increa&s;e your crop &s;urpri&s;ingly as it will be al|mo&s;t double; and all mowing land &s;hould be thus treated, once at lea&s;t in every two years. If you do not dre&s;s them, &s;eed off the crop once in three years, never &s;eed them in the &s;pring, nor clo&s;e at any time. If your lands be rich the drought will have little ef|fect upon them, and you will often have two good crops in the year. It is not the quantity of land, but the care which is taken of it, that increa&s;es hay.</P>
<P>MEASLES in &s;wine, to cure. Take half a &s;poonfull of &s;pirits of hart&s;horn, two ounces of bole armoniac, mix it with meal and water, and give it in the morning, fa&s;ting or when he is hungry; and repeat it four or five days going.</P>
<P>NURSERY &s;hould not be placed on a &s;oil quite &s;o rich, as that on which the young trees are to be tran&s;planted&mdash;&s;hould not be on a &s;pot where large trees have lately growed; nor on a &s;oil very wet or very dry. To prepare the &s;oil, plough, or dig deep, in the latter part of &s;ummer. Plant either &s;eeds, or &s;tones in the latter part of October, Apple &s;eeds may be &s;owed in the pomace. When two or three years old you may place them in the nur&s;ery, in lines three feet apart, trenching in proportion to the length, &amp;c. of their roots; tap roots, and all &s;mall fibrous ones to be trimmed off&mdash;take up the &s;tock with as many roots as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;let them be placed in the trenches 12 or 14 inches a&s;under. Never cut the main branch for the top, &s;ide or lateral branches &s;hould be pruned off, and in proportion to the roots. Let the &s;tock &s;tand in this po&s;ition, until they are &s;ix or &s;even feet high&mdash; when they will be fit for tran&s;planting into orchards, until which time, hoe, or dig among them every &s;pring and fall&mdash;root out all gra&s;s and weeds, keep off all &s;uckers and buds.</P>

<PB N="58" REF="030307_0057_0FE5B0CBB1B92FE0">&s;oil is &s;o wet that it will not crumble&mdash;except green &s;ward, nor when it is very dry&mdash;it is hard, and the furrows will not turn&mdash;In general Farmers do not half plough their ground; neither do they plough in the right &s;ea&s;ons&mdash;by ploughing only, you may re|&s;tore an old field, and bring it to any degree of rich|ne&s;s. Always plough in your corn when the dew is on. Plough new lands in the latter part of &s;um|mer, that they may rot well. All tillage land &s;hould be ploughed in the fall&mdash;indian hills &s;plit and deep. All above the pan, will become dark earth, in a year or two&mdash;never plough an hill up and down, le&s;t it wa&s;h and gully away. Ribbing hills, eight or ten feet apart, is beneficial&mdash;will catch the rain and re|tain moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>POTATOES. The be&s;t grow in a dry &s;oil, but a wet one will yield the mo&s;t. Plough deep, and the more pulverized the earth, the better the crop; ex|cept green &s;ward, which produces at one plough|ing, the greate&s;t crop of any land. Poor land, well cultivated, will yield 100 bu&s;hels per acre. Hogs dung, mixed with a great proportion of &s;traw, rub|bi&s;h, &amp;c. excellent manure for them. As they will grow almo&s;t any where, they are apt to be neglected; but no crop will pay the Farmer better. Cut &s;eed better than whole; a middling potatoe will give &s;ix pieces, with one, or two eyes in each piece: and any part, even the rind, and heart will produce, put three pieces in an hill, &s;ix inches apart, and cover them deep. The &s;hooting part of a potatoe, like a tree; the butt end of it, the &s;tump&mdash;therefore cut length ways as much as you can, in hoeing do not earth them up too much, and let the la&s;t heoing he when they are in blo&s;&s;om; when parboiled, very good for &s;wine, not &s;o good raw&mdash;they increa&s;e milk in cows. A gentleman in Nova-Scotia u&s;ed to wa&s;h,
<PB N="59" REF="030307_0058_0FE5B0D29C2C43D8">and cut them, and give them in plenty to his fat|tening cattle: he informed me, that a bu&s;hed would make a pound of tallow in a creature fo fed.</P>
<P>SOW. If &s;he will not call for the male, give her a little bit of rennet. Feed her for a few days before &s;he pigs, plentifully; it will prevent her devouring them. She &s;hould pig in March or April if the pigs are to be reared.</P>
<P>SEEDS not natural to the climate degenerate&mdash; &s;hould be changed annually, if only from one field to another. A con&s;iderable di&s;tance better. Flax, and mo&s;t early &s;eeds, carried 100 miles north, do well&mdash;late ones carried as far &s;outh, do well al&s;o. Corn, barley, oats and &s;eeds of all kinds, &s;hould be changed every year; it will pay the Farmer fourfold for all his trouble in doing it.</P>
<P>SHEEP. Buy them, and indeed all cattle, from a &s;oil poorer than your own. Buy large boned ones, with long, fine, grea&s;y wool. Dry land good to feed them on, and &s;o are &s;alt mar&s;hes. They go with lamb 20 weeks. One male &s;ufficient for 20 ewes, or more. Propagate tho&s;e which have large bodies, with long, &s;ilky wool. Shady pa&s;tures, and free from bru&s;h, be&s;t for them. The more a &s;heep drinks the fa&s;ter &s;he fats. Once fat, kill them, never will be &s;o fat again. Wa&s;h them in a warm day, in the middle, or la&s;t of June. Let them run three or four days in the pa&s;ture, and &s;weat in their wool, be|fore you &s;hear them: and then avoid pricking and cutting them. If a cold rain falls &s;oon after &s;hear|ing, hou&s;e them. Black wool is never &s;o &s;trong, nor fine, as white.</P>
<P>SALTHAY may be cut one day, cocked the next, and hou&s;ed the third&mdash;throw &s;traw between each layer, in the barn. A portion of it excellent for cattle in the winter.</P>

SPINDLEWORM on Indian corn, is killed by &s;prinkling the corn with a week lye of wood a&s;hes.</P>
<P>SWINE, profitable. Every family &s;hould keep one, to take off the weeds of the garden, and refu&s;e of the kitchen. Carrots good for them&mdash;&s;hould have a change of diet and be fed in a cleanly manner. Some Farmers throw their corn to them in the dur|tie&s;t of pens, where it is buried at once in filth, and almo&s;t entirely lo&s;t. Nothing can be more &s;lovenly. Keep them in a &s;mall pa&s;ture, or orchard, well fen|ced and watered; with a clo&s;e warm &s;tye to retreat to. Keep them always in a middling good plight; yokes prejudicial to them; but no hog &s;hould ever be &s;een without a ring in his no&s;e. Put them up to fatten in September, and kill them middle of Nov|ember or &s;ooner. He who fats a hog in winter mu&s;t be a lo&s;er&mdash;meal better for them than corn&mdash;green corn out of the field, excepted. Give them fair wa|ter for drink&mdash;the wa&s;h of the kitchen, wor&s;e than nothing for fatting hogs. Let them have no more food at a time, than they will eat up clean. If mangy, pour oil on their backs. Give them litter in plenty, and keep their i&s;&s;ues open, or they will not fatten. The Chine&s;e breed very good to propa|gate.</P>
<P>TURKEY. Plunge the chick into cold water, as &s;oon as hatched, or the next day after, and force down one whole pepper corn, &amp; give it to its mother to be brooded, it will be as hardy as the chick of a hen. If they droop while young, view their rumps, and you will find two or three feathers, who&s;e quill parts are filled with blood&mdash;draw them, and the chick will &s;oon recover.</P>
<P>TURNIP. Sow on a light, &s;andy &s;oil, not very rich. New cleared land proper. Sow middle of Ju|ly, when the ground is moi&s;t; not when it is dry.

<P>WHEAT. Sow one bu&s;hel and an half on an a|cre, on a loamy &s;oil well pulverized. Manure with old dung, and change your &s;eed annually. Wa&s;h it before &s;owing, and &s;ow in the latter part of Augu&s;t, and never when the earth is very dry. Plough it in with a &s;hallow furrow, and leave the land rough. Spring wheat &s;hould be &s;owed as early as po&s;&s;ible, and only harrowed in. Never feed grain, unle&s;s it be likely to ear out in the fall.</P>
