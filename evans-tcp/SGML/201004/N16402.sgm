<HEAD>TO THE REVEREND DR. <HI>ISAAC WATTS.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>REV. AND DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WITH the mo&s;t affectionate gratitude and re&s;pect, I beg leave to pre&s;ent you a book, which owes its exi&s;tence to your reque&s;t, its copiou&s;ne&s;s to your plan, and much of its per&s;picuity to your review, and to the u&s;e I made of your remarks on that part of it, which your health and lei&s;ure would permit you to examine. I addre&s;s it to you, not to beg your patronage to it, for of that I am already well a&s;&s;ured; and much le&s;s from any ambition of attempting your character, for which, if I were more, equal to the &s;ubject, I &s;hould think this a very improper place: but chiefly, from a &s;ecret delight which I find in the thought of being known to tho&s;e whom this may reach, as one whom you have honored, not only with your friend&s;hip, but with &s;o much of your e&s;teem and approbation too, as mu&s;t &s;ub&s;tantially appear in your committing a work to me, which you had your|&s;elf projected as one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable &s;ervices of your life.</P>
<P>I have long thought the love of popular applau&s;e a meanne&s;s, which a philo&s;ophy far inferior to that of our divine Ma&s;ter might have taught us to conquer; but to be e&s;teemed by eminently great and good men, to whom we are intimately known, appears to me, not only one of the mo&s;t &s;olid atte&s;tations of &s;ome real worth, but, next to the approbation of God and our own con&s;ciences, one of its mo&s;t valuable rewards. It will, I doubt not, be found &s;o in that world, to which &s;pirits like yours are tending, and for which, through divine grace, you have obtained &s;o uncommon a degree of ripene&s;s. And per|mit me, Sir, while I write this, to refre&s;h my&s;elf with the hope, that when that union of hearts, which has &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us &s;hall arive to its full maturity and endearment there, it will be matter of mutual de|light to recollect, that you have a&s;&s;igned me, and that I have in &s;ome degree executed a ta&s;k, which may per|haps, under the ble&s;&s;ing of God, awaken and improve re|ligious &s;entiments in the minds of tho&s;e whom we leave

behind us, and of others who may ari&s;e after us in this vain, tran&s;itory, en&s;naring world.</P>
<P>Such is the improvement you have made of your ca|pacities for &s;ervice, that I am fully per&s;uaded heave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> has received very few, in the&s;e latter ages, who h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> done &s;o much to &s;erve its intere&s;ts here below; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> who have laboured in this be&s;t of cau&s;es with equal a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> duity, and equal &s;ucce&s;s. And, therefore, I cannot bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> join with all who wi&s;h well to the Chri&s;tian intere&s;t among us in acknowledging the goodne&s;s of Providence to you and to the Church of Chri&s;t, in prolonging a life, at once &s;o valuable and &s;o tender, to &s;uch an advanced pe|riod. With them, Sir, I rejoice, that God hath given you to po&s;&s;e&s;s, in &s;o extraordinary a degree, not only the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of intending great benefit to the world, but the &s;atisfaction of having effected it, and of &s;eeing &s;uch an harve&s;t already &s;pringing up, I hope as an earne&s;t of a much more copious increa&s;e from thence. With multi|tudes more I ble&s;s God, that you are not, in this even|ing of &s;o afflicted, and yet &s;o laborious a day, rendered entirely incapable of &s;erving the public from the pre&s;s, and from the pulpit; and that amid&s;t the pain which your active &s;pirit feels, when the&s;e plea&s;ing &s;ervices &s;uffer long interruptions from bodily weakne&s;s, it may be &s;o &s;ingularly refre&s;hed by reflecting on that &s;phere of exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s, in which by your writings you con|tinually move.</P>
<P>I congratulate you, dear Sir, that, while you are in a multitude of families and &s;chools of the lower cla&s;s, con|de&s;cending to the humble, yet important work, of form|ing infant-minds to the fir&s;t rudiments of religious knowledge and devout impre&s;&s;ions, by your various Chatechi&s;ms and divine Songs, you are al&s;o daily reading Lectures on Logic, and other branches of philo&s;ophy, to &s;tudious youth; and this not only in private academies, but in the mo&s;t public and celebrated &s;eats of learning; not merely in Scotland, and in our American colonies, (where, from &s;ome peculiar con&s;iderations, it might mo&s;t naturally be expected;) but through the amiable candour of &s;ome excellent men and accompli&s;hed tutors in our Engli&s;h univer&s;ities too. I congratulate you, that you are teaching, no doubt hundreds of mini&s;ters, and
<PB N="v" REF="021060_0004_0FB20F48B7D35608">
thou&s;ands of private Chri&s;tians, by your &s;ermons and o|ther theological writings; &s;o happily calculated to dif|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> through their minds that light of knowledge, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">gh their hearts that fervor of piety, which God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">en plea&s;ed to enkindle in your own. But, above <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> congratulate you, that, by your &s;acred poetry, e&s;pe|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ally by your P&s;alms and your Hymns, you are leading the wor&s;hip, and, I tru&s;t, al&s;o animating the devotion, of myriads, in our public a&s;&s;emblies every &s;abbath, and in their families or clo&s;ets every day. This, Sir, at lea&s;t, &s;o far as it relates to the &s;ervice of the &s;anctuary, is an unparalleled favour, by which God hath been plea&s;ed to di&s;tingui&s;h you, I may boldly &s;ay it, beyond any of his &s;ervants now upon earth. Well may it be e&s;teemed a glorious equivalent, and indeed much more than equiva|lent for all tho&s;e views of eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferment, to which &s;uch talents, learning, virtues and intere&s;t, might have entitled you in an e&s;tabli&s;hment; and I doubt not, but you joyfully accept it as &s;uch.</P>
<P>Nor is it ea&s;y to conceive in what circum&s;tances you could, on any &s;uppo&s;ition, have been ea&s;ier and happier, than in that pious and truly honorable family, in which as I verily believe, in &s;pecial indulgence both to you and it, Providence has been plea&s;ed to appoint that you &s;hould &s;pend &s;o con&s;iderable a part of your life. It is my earne&s;t prayer, that all the remainder of it may be &s;e|rene, u&s;eful, and plea&s;ant. And as, to my certain know|ledge, your compo&s;itions have been the &s;ingular comfort of many excellent Chri&s;tians (&s;ome of them numbered a|mong my deare&s;t friends) on their dying bed: for I have heard &s;tanzas of them repeated from the lips of &s;everal, who were doubtle&s;s in a few hours to begin the Song of Mo&s;es and the Lamb; &s;o I hope and tru&s;t, that when God &s;hall call you to that &s;alvation, for which your faith and patience hath &s;o long been waiting, he will &s;hed around you the choice&s;t beams of his favour, and gladden your heart with con&s;olations, like tho&s;e which you have been the happy in&s;trument of admini&s;tering to others.</P>
<P>In the meantime, Sir, be a&s;&s;ured, that I am not a little animated in the various labours to which Provi|dence has called me, by reflecting, that I have &s;uch a contemporary, and e&s;pecially &s;uch a friend; who&s;e
<PB N="vi" REF="021060_0005_0FB20F4C3A3D7450">
&s;ingle pre&s;ence would be to me as that of a cloud of wit|ne&s;&s;es here below, to awaken my alacrity in the race that is &s;et before me. And, I am per&s;uaded, that whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> I &s;ay this, I &s;peak the &s;entiments of many of my br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ren, even of various denominations; a con&s;idera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> which, I hope, will do &s;omething towards reconcili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> heart &s;o generous as yours, to the delay of that exceed|ing and eternal weight of glory, which is now &s;o nearly approaching. Yes, my honoured Friend, you will, I hope, chearfully endure a little longer continuance in life amid&s;t all its infirmities; from an a&s;&s;urance, that while God is plea&s;ed to maintain the exerci&s;e of your rea&s;on, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould live in vain, to the world, or your&s;elf. Every day, and every trial, is brightening your crown, and rendering you &s;till more meet for an inheritance among the &s;aints in light. Every word that you drop from the pulpit has now, &s;urely, its peculiar weight: the eyes of many are on their a&s;cend|ing prophet, eagerly intent that they may catch, if not his mantle, at lea&s;t &s;ome divine &s;entence from his lips, which may long guide their ways, and warm their hearts. This &s;olicitude your friends bring into tho&s;e happy moments in which they are favoured with your conver&s;e in private: and when you are retired from them, your prayers, I doubt not, largely contribute to|wards guarding your country, watering the church, and ble&s;&s;ing the world. Long may they continue to an&s;wer the&s;e great ends! And permit me, Sir, to conclude, with expre&s;&s;ing my chearful confidence, that in tho&s;e be&s;t mo|ments you are often particularly mindful of one, who &s;o highly e&s;teems, &s;o greatly needs, and &s;o warmly returns, that remembrance, as,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;everal hints given me in the Dedication, and the fir&s;t chapter of this Treati&s;e, which contains a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ticular plan of the de&s;ign, render it unnece&s;&s;ary to introduce it with a long preface. Some of my readers may perhaps remember, that, &s;everal years ago, I pro|mi&s;ed this work to the Public, in the preface to the &s;e|cond edition of my &s;ermons <HI>on the power and grace of Chri&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. My much honoured friend Dr. WATTS had laid the &s;cheme, e&s;pecially of the former part. But as tho&s;e indi&s;po&s;itions, with which (to the un&s;peakable grief of the churches) God has been plea&s;ed to exerci&s;e him, had forbid his hopes of being able to add <HI>this</HI> to his many <HI>labours of love</HI> to immortal &s;ouls, he was plea&s;ed, in a very affectionate and importunate manner, to urge me to undertake it. And I ble&s;s GOD, with my whole heart, not only that he hath carried me through this delightful ta&s;k (for &s;uch indeed I have found it) but al|&s;o that he hath &s;pared that worthy and amiable per&s;on to &s;ee it accompli&s;hed, and given him &s;trength and &s;pirit to review &s;o con&s;iderable a part of it. His appro|bation expre&s;&s;ed in &s;tronger terms than mode&s;ty will per|mit me to repeat, encourages me to hope that it is ex|ecuted in &s;uch a manner as may, by the divine ble&s;&s;ing, render it of &s;ome general &s;ervice. And I the rather hope it will be &s;o, as it now comes abroad into the world, not only with my own prayers and his, but al&s;o with tho&s;e of many other pious friends, which I have been particularly careful to engage for its &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Into whatever hands this work may come, I mu&s;t de|&s;ire that, before any pa&s;s their judgment, they would plea&s;e to read it through, that they may di&s;cern the connection between one part of it and another. Which I the rather reque&s;t, becau&s;e I have long ob&s;erved, that Chri&s;tians of different parties have been eagerly laying hold on particular parts of the &s;y&s;tem of divine truths, and have been contending about them; as if each had been all; or, as if the &s;eparation of the members from each other, and from the head, were the pre&s;ervation of the body in&s;tead of its de&s;truction. They have been
<PB N="viii" REF="021060_0007_0FB20F4F8E8262D0">
zealous to e&s;pou&s;e the defence, and to maintain the ho|nour and u&s;efulne&s;s of each apart; whereas their ho|nour as well as u&s;efulne&s;s, &s;eems to me to lie much in their connection: and &s;u&s;picions have often ari&s;en be|twixt the re&s;pective defenders of each, which have a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+peared as unrea&s;onable and ab&s;urd, as if all the prepa|rations for &s;ecuring one part of a &s;hip in a &s;torm were to be cen&s;ured as a contrivance to &s;ink the re&s;t. I pray God to give to <HI>all his mini&s;ters</HI> and <HI>people</HI> more and more of <HI>the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom,</HI> and of <HI>love,</HI> and <HI>of a &s;ound mind;</HI> and to remove far from us tho&s;e mutual jealou&s;ies and animo&s;ities, which hinder our acting with that un|animity, which is nece&s;&s;ary in order to the &s;ucce&s;sful carrying on our common warfare again&s;t the enemies of Chri&s;tianity. We may be &s;ure the&s;e enemies will never fail to make their own advantage of our multi|plied divi&s;ions and &s;evere conte&s;ts with each other. But they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily lo&s;e both their ground and their influence, in proportion to the degree in which the e|nergy of Chri&s;tian principles is felt, to unite and trans|form the hearts of tho&s;e by whom they are profe&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I take this opportunity of adding, that as this Trea|ti&s;e may be looked upon as the &s;equel of my <HI>&s;ermons on Regeneration,</HI> though in &s;omething of a different method, a &s;econd edition of tho&s;e &s;ermons is now publi&s;hed (in compliance with the reque&s;t of many of my friends) in the &s;ame form and &s;ize with this book. I have been &s;o|licitous to make them both as cheap as po&s;&s;ible, that I may fall in with the charitable de&s;igns of tho&s;e who may purpo&s;e to give them away. There is, however, an e|dition of this treati&s;e in octavo, for &s;uch as rather chu&s;e to have it in a larger character and fairer form.</P>
<P>I have &s;tudied the greate&s;t plainne&s;s of &s;peech, that the lowe&s;t of my readers may, if po&s;&s;ible, be able to un|der&s;tand every word; and, I hope, per&s;ons of a more elegant ta&s;te and refined education, will pardon what appeared to me &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a piece of charity. Such a care in practical writers, &s;eems one important in&s;tance of that honouring all men, which our amiable and con|de&s;cending religion teaches; and I have been particu|larly obliged to my worthy patron, for what he hath done to &s;horten &s;ome of the &s;entences, and to put my
<PB N="ix" REF="021060_0008_0FB20F50D5A22D70">
meaning into plainer and more familiar words. Yet, I dare &s;ay, the world will not &s;u&s;pect it of having con|tracted any impropriety or inelegance of language by pa&s;&s;ing through the hands of Dr. WATTS.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t add one remark here, which I heartily wi&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not omitted in the fir&s;t edition, viz. That though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> do in this book con&s;ider my reader as &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in a great variety of &s;uppo&s;ed circum&s;tances, beginning with tho&s;e of <HI>a thoughtle&s;s &s;inner,</HI> and leading him through &s;everal &s;tages of conviction, terror, <HI>&amp;c</HI> as what may be previous to his &s;incerely accepting the go&s;pel, and devoting him&s;elf to the &s;ervice of; yet I would by no means be thought to in&s;inuate, that every one who is brought to that happy re&s;olution, arrives at it through tho&s;e particular &s;teps or feels agitations of mind equal, in any degree, to tho&s;e I have de&s;cribed. Some &s;en&s;e of &s;in, and &s;ome &s;erious and humbling apprehen&s;ion of our danger and mi&s;ery in con&s;equence of it, mu&s;t in|deed be nece&s;&s;ary, to di&s;po&s;e us to receive the grace of the go&s;pel, and the Saviour who is there exhibited to our faith: but God is plea&s;ed &s;ometimes to begin the work of his grace on the heart almo&s;t from the fir&s;t dawning of rea&s;on, and to carry it on by &s;uch gentle and in&s;en&s;ible degrees, that very excellent per&s;ons, who have made the mo&s;t eminent attainments in the divine life, have been unable to recount any remarkable hi&s;tory of their conver&s;ion. And, &s;o far as I can learn, this is mo&s;t frequently the ca&s;e with tho&s;e of them who have enjoyed the benefits of a pious education, when it has not been &s;ucceeded by a vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious and licentious youth. God forbid, therefore, that any &s;hould be &s;o in&s;en&s;ible of their own happine&s;s as to fall into perplexity with relation to their &s;piritual &s;tate, for want of being able to trace &s;uch a ri&s;e of religion in their minds as it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary, on my plan, for me to de&s;cribe and exemplify here.&mdash;I have &s;poken my &s;entiments on this head &s;o fully in the VIIIth of my <HI>&s;ermons on Regeneration,</HI> that I think none who has read, and remembers the general contents of it, can be in danger of mi&s;taking my mean|ing here. But as it is very po&s;&s;ible this book may fall into the hands of many who have not read the other, and have no opportunity of con&s;ulting it, I thought pro|per
<PB N="x" REF="021060_0009_0FB20F54647E6070">
to in&s;ert this caution in the preface to this; and I am much obliged to that worthy and excellent per&s;on who kindly reminded me of the expediency of doing it.</P>
<P>I conclude, with de&s;iring my friends to forgive the nece&s;&s;ary interruption which this work has given to the <HI>third volume</HI> of my <HI>Family Expo&s;itor,</HI> which I am now &s;ending to the pre&s;s as fa&s;t as I can, and hope to publi&s;h in le&s;s than a year. To this volume I have referred &s;e|veral <HI>additional notes,</HI> and the <HI>indexes,</HI> which are nece&s;|&s;ary to render the former volumes complete; having determined to add nothing to the &s;econd edition which &s;hould depreciate the former. I do not think it nece&s;|&s;ary to trouble my friends with a new &s;ub&s;cription, tak|ing it for granted, that few who were plea&s;ed with the other part of the work, will fail of perfecting the &s;et on the <HI>hi&s;torical books</HI> of the <HI>New Te&s;tament.</HI> When my Ex|po&s;ition on the <HI>epi&s;tolary part</HI> may be completed, God only knows. I will proceed in it as fa&s;t as the other duties of my &s;tation will permit; and I earne&s;tly beg, that if my readers find edification and advantage by any of my writings, they would in return offer a prayer for me, that God may carry me on, in that <HI>mo&s;t important labour of my pen,</HI> under the remarkable tokens of his guidance and ble&s;&s;ing.</P>

<HEAD>THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF <HI>RELIGION IN THE SOUL.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. The Introduction to the WORK, with &s;ome general Account of its De&s;ign.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>That true religion is very rare, appears from comparing the nature of it with the lives and characters of men around us, &sect; <HI>1, 2.</HI> The want of it is matter of ju&s;t lamentation, &sect; <HI>3.</HI> To remedy this evil is the de&s;ign of the en&s;uing treati&s;e, &sect; <HI>4.</HI> To which, therefore, the author earne&s;tly be&s;peaks the atten|tion of the reader, as his own heart is deeply intere&s;ted in it, &sect; <HI>5, 6.</HI> A general plan of the work; of which the fifteen fir&s;t chapters relate chiefly to the <HI>RISE</HI> of Religion, and the remaining chapters to its <HI>PROGRESS, &sect; 7.&mdash;12.</HI> The chapter concludes with a prayer for the &s;ucce&s;s of the work.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">&sect; 1. WHEN we look round about us with an attentive eye, and con&s;ider the cha|racters and pur&s;uits of men, we plain|ly &s;ee, that though, in the original con&s;titution of their natures, they only, of all the creatures that dwell on the face of the earth, be capable of religion, yet many of them &s;hamefully neglect it. And whatever diffe|rent notions people may entertain of what they call re|ligion, all mu&s;t agree in owning, that it is very far from being an univer&s;al thing.</P>
<P N="2">&sect; 2. Religion, in its mo&s;t general view, is &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of God on the &s;oul, and &s;uch a conviction of our obliga|tions to him, and of our dependance upon him, as &s;hall engage us to make it our great care to conduct our&s;elves in a manner which we have rea&s;on to believe will be
<PB N="2" REF="021060_0015_0FB20F5FD59F37A0">
plea&s;ing to him. Now, when we have given this plain account of religion, it is by no means nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould &s;earch among the &s;avages of the African or Ame|rican nations, to find in&s;tances of tho&s;e who are &s;trangers to it. When we view the conduct of the generality of people at home, in a Chri&s;tian and Prote&s;tant nation, in a nation who&s;e obligations to God have been &s;ingular, almo&s;t beyond tho&s;e of any other people under Heaven, will any one pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that religion has an univer|&s;al reign among us? will any one &s;uppo&s;e that it prevails in every life? that it reigns in every heart? alas! the avowed infidelity, the profanation of the name and day of God, the drunkenne&s;s, the lewdne&s;s, the inju&s;tice the fal&s;ehood, the pride, the prodigality, the ba&s;e &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, the &s;tupid in&s;en&s;ibility of the &s;piritual and eternal inte|re&s;ts of them&s;elves and others, which &s;o generally appear among us, loudly proclaim the contrary. So that one would imagine, upon this view, that thou&s;ands and ten thou&s;ands thought the neglect and even the contempt, of religion were a glory rather than a reproach. And where is the neighbourhood, where is the &s;ociety, where is the happy family, (con&s;i&s;ting of any con&s;iderable num|ber,) in which, on a more exact examination, we find rea&s;on to &s;ay, "Religion fills even this little circle?" There is, perhaps, a freedom from any gro&s;s and &s;canda|lous immoralities, an external decency of behaviour, an attendance on the outward forms of wor&s;hip in public, and (here and there) in the family; yet amid&s;t all this, there is nothing which looks like the genuine actings of the &s;piritual and divine life. There is no appearance of love to God, no reverence for his pre&s;ence, no de&s;ire of his favour as the highe&s;t good: there is no cordial belief of the go&s;pel of &s;alvation; no eager &s;olicitude to e&s;cape that condemnation which we have incurred by &s;in; no hearty concern to &s;ecure that eternal life which Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed and &s;ecured for his people, and which he freely promi&s;es to all who will receive him. Alas! whatever the love of a friend, or ever of a parent, can do: whatever inclination there may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to hope all things, and believe all things, the mo&s;t favourable; evi|dence
<PB N="3" REF="021060_0016_0FB20F64E8429848">
to the contrary will force it&s;elf upon the mind, and extort the unwilling conclu&s;ion, that, whatever el&s;e may be amiable in this dear friend, in that favourite child, "religion dwells not in its brea&s;t."</P>
<P N="3">&sect; 3. To a heart that firmly believes the go&s;pel, and views per&s;ons and things in the light of eternity, this is one of the mo&s;t mournful con&s;iderations in the world. And indeed, to &s;uch a one, all the other calamities and evils of human nature appears trifles when compared with this, the ab&s;ence of real religion, and that contra|riety to it, which reigns in &s;o many thou&s;ands of man|kind. Let this be cured, and all the other evils will ea&s;ily be borne; nay, good will be extracted out of them: but if this continue, it "bringeth forth fruit unto death<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 5.</NOTE>;" and in con&s;equence of it, multitudes, who &s;hare the entertainments of an indulgent Providence with us, and are at lea&s;t allied to us by the bond of the &s;ame common nature, mu&s;t, in a few years, be &s;wept away into "utter de&s;truction," and be plunged beyond redemption "into everla&s;ting burnings."</P>
<P N="4">&sect; 4. I doubt not but that there are many, under tho&s;e various forms of religious profe&s;&s;ion, which have &s;o un|happily divided us in this nation, who are not only la|menting this in public, if their office in life calls them to an opportunity of doing it, but are likewi&s;e mourning before God in &s;ecret, under a &s;en&s;e of this &s;ad &s;tate of things; and who can appeal to him that &s;earches all hearts, as to the &s;incerity of their de&s;ires to revive the langui&s;hing cau&s;e of vital Chri&s;tianity and &s;ub&s;tantial piety, and, among the re&s;t, the author of this treati&s;e, may with confidence, &s;ay, it is this which animates him to the pre&s;ent attempt, in the mid&s;t of &s;o many other cares and labours; for this, he is willing to lay a&s;ide many of tho&s;e curious amu&s;ements in &s;cience which might &s;uit his own private ta&s;te, and perhaps open a way to &s;ome reputation in the learned world: for this, he is willing to wave the laboured ornaments of &s;peech, that he may, if po&s;&s;ible, de&s;cend to the capacity of the

lowe&s;t part of mankind: for this, he would endeavour to convince the judgment, and to reach the heart, of every reader: and in a word, for this, without any dread of the name of an Enthu&s;ia&s;t, whoever may at random throw it out upon the occa&s;ion, he would, as it were, enter with you into your clo&s;et from day to day, and with all plainne&s;s and freedom, as well as &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s, would di&s;cour&s;e to you of the great things which he has learnt from the Chri&s;tian revelation, and on which he a&s;&s;uredly knows your everla&s;ting happine&s;s to depend: that if you hitherto have lived without religion, you may now be awakened to the con&s;ideration of it, and may be in&s;tructed in its nature and importance; or that, if you are already, through divine grace, experi|mentally acquainted with it, you may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted to make a greater progre&s;s.</P>
<P N="5">&sect; 5. But he earne&s;tly intreats this favor of you, that, as it is plainly a &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s we are entering upon, you would be plea&s;ed to give him a &s;erious and an at|tentive hearing. He intreats that the&s;e addre&s;&s;es, and the&s;e meditations, may be peru&s;ed at lei&s;ure, and be thought over in retirement; and that you would do him and your&s;elf the ju&s;tice to believe the repre&s;entations which are here made, and the warnings which are here given, to proceed from &s;incerity and love; from an heart which would not de&s;ignedly give one moment's unnece&s;&s;ary pain to the meane&s;t creature on the face of the earth, and much le&s;s to any human mind. If he be importunate, it is, becau&s;e he at lea&s;t imagines that there is ju&s;t rea&s;on for it; and fears, lea&s;t amid&s;t the multi|tudes who are undone by the utter neglect of religion, and among tho&s;e who are greatly damaged for want of a more re&s;olute and con&s;tant attendance to it: this may be the ca&s;e of &s;ome into who&s;e hands this treati&s;e may fall.</P>
<P N="6">&sect; 6. He is a barbarian, and de&s;erve, not to be called a man, who can look on the &s;orrows of his fellow-creatures without drawing out his &s;oul unto them, and wi&s;hing, at lea&s;t, that it were in the power of his hand to help them. Surely earth would be in Heaven to that man

who could go about from place to place, &s;cattering hap|pine&s;s where&s;oever he came, though it were only the body that he were capable of relieving, and though he could impart nothing better than the happine&s;s of a mor|tal life. But the happine&s;s ri&s;es in proportion to the na|ture and degree of the good which he imparts. Happy, are we ready to &s;ay, were tho&s;e honored &s;ervants of Chri&s;t, who in the early days of his church, were the be|nevolent and &s;ympathi&s;ing in&s;truments of conveying mi|raculous healing to tho&s;e who&s;e ca&s;es &s;eemed de&s;perate; who poured in upon the blind and the deaf the plea&s;ures of light and &s;ound, and called up the dead to the powers of action and enjoyment. But this is an honor and hap|pine&s;s which it is not fit for God commonly to be&s;tow on mortal men. Yet there have been in every age, and, ble&s;&s;ed be his name, there &s;till are tho&s;e, whom he has conde&s;cended to make his in&s;truments in conveying nobler and more la&s;ting ble&s;&s;ings than the&s;e to their fel|low-creatures. Death hath long &s;ince veiled the eyes and &s;topped the ears of tho&s;e who were the &s;ubjects of miraculous healing, and recovered its empire over tho&s;e who were once recalled from the grave. But the &s;ouls who were prevailed on to receive the go&s;pel live for ever. God has owned the labours of his faithful mini&s;ters in every age to produce the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed effects; and &s;ome of them being dead, yet &s;peaketh<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi. 4.</NOTE> with power and &s;uc|ce&s;s in this important cau&s;e. Wonder not then if, living and dying, I be ambitious of this honor; and if "my mouth be freely opened," where I can truly &s;ay, "My heart is enlarged<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. vi. 11.</NOTE>."</P>
<P N="7">&sect; 7. Informing my general plan, I have been &s;olicitous that this little treati&s;e might, if po&s;&s;ible, be u&s;eful to all its readers, and contain &s;omething &s;uitable to each. I will therefore take the man, and the Chri&s;tian, in a great variety of circum&s;tances. I will fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf ad|dre&s;&s;ing to one of the va&s;t number of thoughtle&s;s crea|tures, who have hitherto been utterly unconcerned about religion; and will try what can be done, by all plainne&s;s and earne&s;tne&s;s of addre&s;s, to awaken him from this fa|tal

lethargy, to a care (chap. 2.) an affectionate and an immediate care about it, (chap. 3.) I will labour to fix a deep and awful conviction of guilt upon his con&s;cience. (chap. 4.), and to &s;trip him of his vain excu&s;es and his flattering hopes, (chap. 5.) I will read to him, oh! that I could fix on his heart, that &s;entence, that dreadful &s;en|tence, which a righteous and an Almighty God hath de|nounced again&s;t him as a &s;inner, (chap. 6.); and endea|vour to &s;how him in how helple&s;s a &s;tate he lies under this condemnation, as to any capacity he has of deliver|ing him&s;elf, (chap. 7.) But I do not mean to leave any in &s;o terrible a &s;ituation; I will joyfully proclaim <Q>the glad tidings of pardon and &s;alvation by Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord,</Q> which is all the &s;upport and confidence of my own &s;oul, (chap. 8.); and then I will give &s;ome ge|neral view of the way by which this &s;alvation is to be obtained, (chap. 9.); urging the &s;inner to accept of it as affectionately as I can, (chap. 10.); though nothing can be &s;ufficiently pathetic, where, as in this matter, the life of an immortal &s;oul is in que&s;tion.</P>

Too probable it is, that &s;ome will, after all this, remain in&s;en&s;ible; and therefore, that their &s;ad ca&s;e may not incumber the following articles, I &s;hall here take a &s;olemn leave of them, (chap. 11.); and then &s;hall turn and addre&s;s my&s;elf, as compa&s;&s;ionately as I can to a mo&s;t contrary character; I mean to a &s;oul overwhelmed with a &s;en&s;e of the greatne&s;s of its &s;ins, and trembling under the burden, as if there were no more hope for him in God, (chap. 12.) and that nothing may be omitted which may give &s;olid peace to the troubled &s;pirit, I &s;hall endea|vour to guide its enquiries as to the evidences of &s;incere repentance and faith, (chap. 13.); which will be far|ther illu&s;trated by a more particular view of the &s;everal branches of the Chri&s;tian temper, &s;uch as may &s;erve at once to a&s;&s;i&s;t the reader in judging what he is, and to &s;how him what he &s;hould labour to be, (chap. 14) This will naturally lead to a view of the need we have of the influ|ences of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the important and difficult work of the true Chri&s;tian; and of the encourage|ment we have to hope for the&s;e divine a&s;&s;i&s;tances, (chap.

And that it may be done more effectually, I &s;hall urge a &s;olemn dedication of him&s;elf to God, (chap. 17.); to be confirmed by entering into the full communion of the church by an approach to the &s;a|cred table, (chap. 18.) That the&s;e engagements may be more happily fulfilled, we &s;hall endeavour to draw a more particular plan of that devout, regular, and accu|rate cour&s;e, which ought daily to be attended to, (chap. 19.); and becau&s;e the idea will probably ri&s;e &s;o much higher than what is the general practice, even of good men, we &s;hall endeavour to per&s;uade the reader to make the attempt, hard as it may &s;eem, (chap. 20.); and &s;hall caution him again&s;t various temptations, which might otherwi&s;e draw him a&s;ide to negligence and &s;in, (chap. 21.)</P>

And as the one or the other of the&s;e tends, in a proportionable degree, to provoke the ble&s;&s;ed God to hide his face, and his injured Spirit to withdraw, that melancholy condition will be taken into a particular &s;urvey, (chap. 24.) I &s;hall then take notice al&s;o of the ca&s;e of great and heavy afflictions in life, (chap. 25.) a di&s;cipline which the be&s;t of men have rea&s;on to expect, e&s;pecially when they back&s;lide from God, and yield to their &s;piritual enemies.</P>

And as nothing conduces more to the advancement of grace than the lively ex|erci&s;e of love to God, a holy joy in him, we &s;hall here remind the real Chri&s;tian of tho&s;e mercies which tend to excite that love and joy (chap. 27.) and, in the views of them, to animate him to tho&s;e vigorous efforts of u&s;efulne&s;s in life which &s;o well becomes his character, and will have &s;o happy an efficacy on brightening his crown, (chap. 28.) Suppo&s;ing him to act accordingly, we &s;hall then labour to illu&s;trate and a&s;&s;i&s;t the delight with which he may look forward to the awful &s;olemnities of death and judgment, (chap. 29.): and &s;hall clo&s;e the &s;cene by accompanying him, as it were, to the neare&s;t confines of that dark valley, through which he is to pa&s;s to glory; giving him &s;uch directions as may &s;eem mo&s;t &s;ub&s;ervient to his honouring God, and adorning religion, by his dying behaviour, (chap. 30.) Nor am I without a plea&s;ing hope, that, through the divine ble&s;&s;ing and grace, I may be, in &s;ome in&s;tances, &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as to leave tho&s;e triumphing in the views of judgment and eternity, and glorifying God by a truly Chri&s;tian life and death, whom I found trembling in the apprehen&s;ions of future mi&s;ery; or, perhaps, in a much more dangerous and mi&s;erable circum&s;tance than that; I mean, entirely forgetting the pro&s;pect, and &s;unk into the mo&s;t &s;tupid in&s;en&s;ibility of tho&s;e things, for an attendance to which the human mind was formed, and in compari&s;on of which all the pur&s;uits of this tran&s;itory life are emptier than wind, and lighter than a feather.</P>

Accounts, corre&s;pondencies, &s;tudies, may often bring you into your clo&s;et; but if nothing but devotion were to be tran&s;acted there, it would be to you quite an unfrequent|ed place. And thus you go on from day to day, in a con|tinual forgetfulne&s;s of God; and are as thoughtle&s;s a|bout religion, as if you had long &s;ince demon&s;trated it to your&s;elf that it was a mere dream.

You need not go back to the helple&s;s days of your infancy and childhood to convince you of the contrary; you need not, in order to this, to recollect the remark|able deliverances which, perhaps, were wrought out for you many years ago: the repo&s;e of the la&s;t night, the refre&s;hment and comfort you have received this day; yea, the mercies you are receiving this very moment, bear witne&s;s to him; and yet you regard him not. Ungrateful creature that you are! could you have treat|ed any human benefactor thus? Could you have borne to neglect a kind parent, or any generous friend that had but for a few months acted the part of a parent to you? to have taken no notice of him, while in his pre|&s;ence; to have returned him no thanks; to have had no contrivances to make &s;ome little acknowledgment for all his goodne&s;s?

It &s;eems matter of wonder, that, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, you are not almo&s;t di&s;tracted with the thoughts of the uncertainty of life, and are not even ready to die for fear of death. To trifle with God any longer, after &s;o &s;olemn an admo|nition as this, would be a circum&s;tance of additional provocation, which, after all the re&s;t, might be fatal: nor is there any thing that you can expect in &s;uch a ca&s;e, but that he &s;hould cut you off immediately, and teach other thoughtle&s;s creatures, by your ruin, what a hazardous experiment they make when they act as you are acting.</P>

<P N="1">&sect; 1. AS I am attempting to lead you to true religion, and not merely to &s;ome &s;uperficial form of it, I am &s;en&s;ible I can do it no otherwi&s;e than in the way of deep humiliation. And therefore, &s;uppo&s;ing you are per&s;uaded, through the divine ble&s;&s;ing on which you have before read, to take it into con&s;ideration, I would now endeavour, in the fir&s;t place, with all the &s;e|riou&s;ne&s;s I can, to make you heartily &s;en&s;ible of your guilt before God. For I well know, that unle&s;s you are convinced of this, and affected with the conviction, all the provi&s;ions of go&s;pel grace will be &s;lighted, and your &s;oul infallibly de&s;troyed in the mid&s;t of the noble&s;t means appointed for its recovery. I am fully per&s;uaded that thou&s;ands live and die in a cour&s;e of &s;in, without feeling upon their hearts any &s;en&s;e that they are &s;in|ners; though they cannot, for &s;hame, but own it in words. And therefore let me deal faithfully with you, though I may &s;eem to deal roughly; for complai&s;ance is not to give law to addre&s;&s;es in which the life of your &s;oul is concerned.</P>
<P N="2">&sect; 2. Permit me, therefore, O &s;inner, to con&s;ider my|&s;elf at this time as an advocate for God; as one employ|ed in his name to plead again&s;t thee, and to charge thee with nothing le&s;s than being a rebel and a traitor a|gain&s;t the &s;overeign Maje&s;ty of heaven and earth. However thou maye&s;t he dignified or di&s;tingui&s;hed a|mong

men; if the noble&s;t blood run in thy veins; if thy &s;eat were among princes, and thine arm were "the terror of the Mighty in the land of the living<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxii, 27.</NOTE>;" it would <Q>be nece&s;&s;ary thou &s;hould&s;t be told, and told plainly, thou ha&s;t broken the "laws of the King of kings,</Q> and by the breach of it art become ob|noxious to his righteous condemnation.</P>
<P N="3">&sect; 3. Your con&s;cience tells you, that you were born the natural &s;ubject of God: born under the indi&s;pen|&s;ible obligations of his law. For it is mo&s;t apparent, that the con&s;titution of your rational nature, which makes you capable of receiving law from God, binds you to obey it. And it is equally evident and certain, that you have not exactly obeyed this law; nay, that you have violated it in many aggravated in&s;tances.</P>
<P N="4">&sect; 4. Will you dare to deny this! Will you dare to a&s;&s;ert your innocence! Remember, it mu&s;t be a com|plete innocence; yes, and a perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s too; or it can &s;tand you in no &s;tead, farther than to prove that, though a condemned &s;inner, you are not quite &s;o criminal as &s;ome others, and will not have quite &s;o hot a place in hell as they. And when this is con&s;idered, will you plead not guilty to the charge? Search the records of your own con&s;cience, for God &s;earcheth them: a&s;k it &s;eriou&s;ly, "Have you never in your lives &s;inned again&s;t God?" Solomon declared, that, in his day, there was not a ju&s;t man upon earth, who did good, and &s;inned not<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Eccl. vii, 20.</NOTE>:" and the apo&s;tle Paul, that "all had &s;inned and come &s;hort of the glory of God<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii, 23.</NOTE>:" that "both Jews and Gentiles," which, you know, comprehended the whole human race,) "were all under &s;in<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii, 9.</NOTE>." And can you pretend any imaginable rea&s;on to believe the world is grown &s;o much better &s;ince their days, that any &s;hould now plead their own ca&s;e as an exception? Or will you, however, pre&s;ume to ari&s;e in the face of the omni&s;cient Maje&s;ty of heaven, and &s;ay, "I am the man."</P>

Does it not prove you guilty of pride, of pa&s;&s;ion, of &s;en|&s;uality, of an exce&s;&s;ive fondne&s;s for the world and its enjoyments; of murmuring, or at lea&s;t of &s;ecretly re|pining again&s;t God under the &s;trokes of an afflictive pro|vidence; of mi&s;pending a great deal of your time; of abu&s;ing the gifts of God's bounty to vain, if not (in &s;ome in&s;tances) to pernicious purpo&s;es; of mocking him when you have pretended to engage in his wor&s;hip, "drawing near to him with your mouth and your lips, while your heart has been far from him<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xxix, 13.</NOTE>?"

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">&sect; 1. SINNER, thou ha&s;t heard the &s;entence of God, as it &s;tands upon record in his &s;acred and im|mutable word. And wilt thou lye down under it in everla&s;ting de&s;pair? wilt thou make no attempt to be delivered from it, when it &s;peaks nothing le&s;s than <HI>eter|nal death</HI> to thy &s;oul? If a criminal, condemned by hu|man laws, has but the lea&s;t &s;hadow of hope that he may po&s;&s;ibly e&s;cape, he is all attention to it. If there be a friend who he thinks can help him, with what &s;trong importunity does he entreat the interpo&s;ition of that friend? And, even while he is before the judge, how difficult is it often to force him away from the bar, while the cry of Mercy, mercy, mercy, may be heard, though it be never &s;o unrea&s;onable? A mere po&s;&s;ibility that it may make &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion makes him eager in it, and unwilling to be &s;ilenced and removed.</P>
<P N="2">&sect; 2. Wilt thou not then, O &s;inner, ere yet execution is done, that execution which may, perhaps, be done this very day, wilt thou not ca&s;t about in thy thoughts what mea&s;ures may be taken for deliverance? Yet what mea&s;ures can be taken? Con&s;ider attentively; for it is
<PB N="64" REF="021060_0077_0FB20FFE15828010">
an affair of moment. Thy wi&s;dom, thy power, thy e|loquence, or thine intere&s;t, can never be exerted on a greater occa&s;ion. If thou can&s;t help thy&s;elf, do. If thou ha&s;t any &s;ecret &s;ource of relief, go not out of thy|&s;elf for other a&s;&s;i&s;tance. If thou ha&s;t any &s;acrifice to offer, if thou ha&s;t any &s;trength to exert, yea if thou ha&s;t any allies on earth, or in the invi&s;ible world, who can defend and deliver thee, take thine own way, &s;o that thou maye&s;t but be delivered at all, and we may not &s;ee thy ruin. But &s;ay, O &s;inner, in the pre&s;ence of God, what &s;acrifice thou wilt pre&s;ent, what &s;trength thou wilt exert, what allies thou wilt have re|cour&s;e to, on &s;o urgent, &s;o hopele&s;s an occa&s;ion: for, hopele&s;s I mu&s;t indeed pronounce it, if &s;uch methods are taken.</P>

Shall it be by any calamities to be endured in this mor|tal momentary life? Is the ju&s;tice of God, then, e&s;teem|ed &s;o little a thing, that the &s;orrows of a few days &s;hould &s;uffice to an&s;wer its demands? Or do&s;t thou think of fu|ture &s;ufferings in the invi&s;ible world? If thou do&s;t, that is not deliverance: and, with regard to that, I may venture to &s;ay, When thou ha&s;t made full &s;atisfaction, thou wilt be relea&s;ed: when thou ha&s;t paid the utmo&s;t farthing of that debt, thy pri&s;on-doors &s;hall be opened.

It would indeed be well for thee if thou coulde&s;t carry down with thee &s;uch a hope, fal&s;e and flattering as it is: but, alas! thou wilt &s;ee things in &s;o ju&s;t a light, that to have no comfort but this will be eternal de&s;pair.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. News of Salvation by Chri&s;t, brought to the con|vinced and condemned Sinner.</HEAD>

<P>The awful things which have hitherto been &s;aid, intended not to grieve, but to help, &sect; <HI>1.</HI> After &s;ome reflection on the plea&s;ure with which a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel may de|liver the me&s;&s;age with which he is charged, &sect; <HI>2.</HI> and &s;ome rea&s;ons for the repetition of what is in &s;peculation &s;o generally known, &sect; <HI>3.</HI> the author proceeds briefly to de|clare the &s;ub&s;tance of the&s;e glad tidings: <HI>viz.</HI> That God having, in his infinite compa&s;&s;ion, &s;ent his Son to die for &s;inners, is now reconcileable through him, &sect; <HI>4.&mdash;6.;</HI> So that the mo&s;t heinous tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions &s;hall be entirely pardoned to believers, and they made completely and eternally happy, &sect; <HI>7, 8</HI> The &s;inner's reflection on this good news.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>&sect; 1. MY dear reader! it is the great de&s;ign of the go&s;pel, and, wherever it is cordially received, it is the glorious effect of it, to fill the heart with &s;enti|ments of love; to teach us to abhor all unnece&s;&s;ary ri|gour and &s;everity, and to delight, not in the grief, but in the happine&s;s of our fellow-creatures. I can hardly apprehend how he can be a Chri&s;tian who takes plea|&s;ure in the di&s;tre&s;s which appears even in a brute, much le&s;s in that of a human mind; and, e&s;pecially, in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s as the thoughts I have been propo&s;ing mu&s;t give, if there be any due attention to their weight and ener|gy. I have often felt a tender regret while I have been repre&s;enting the&s;e things; and I could have wi&s;hed from mine heart that it had not been nece&s;&s;ary to have placed them in &s;o &s;evere and &s;o painful a light. But now I am addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to a part of my work, which I undertake with untterable plea&s;ure; and to that which indeed I had in view, in all tho&s;e awful things which I have already been laying before you. I have been &s;howing you, that, if you hitherto have lived in a &s;tate of impenitence and &s;in, you are condemned by God's righteous judgment&punc; and have in your&s;elf no &s;pring of hope and no po&s;&s;ibility of deliverance. But I
<PB N="71" REF="021060_0084_0FB210125DD8F9D8">
mean not to leave you under this &s;ad apprehen&s;ion, to lye down and die in de&s;pair, complaining of that cruel zeal which has "tormented you before the time." Matth. viii, 29.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. Ari&s;e, O thou dejected &s;oul, that art pro&s;trate in the du&s;t before God, and trembling under the ter|rors of his righteous &s;entence: for I am commi&s;&s;ioned to tell thee, that though <Q>thou ha&s;t de&s;troyed thy&s;elf, in God is thine help, Ho&s;ea 13, 9." I bring thee good tidings of great joy, Luke 2, 10,</Q> which de|light my own heart while I proclaim them, and will, I hope, reach and revive thine; even the tidings of &s;alvation by the blood and righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Redeem|er. And I give it thee, for thy greater &s;ecurity, in the words of a gracious and forgiving God, that <Q>he is in Chri&s;t reconciling the world unto him&s;elf, and not imputing to them their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, 2 Cor. 5, 19.</Q></P>
<P>&sect; 3. This is the be&s;t news that ever was heard, the mo&s;t important me&s;&s;age which God ever &s;ent to his creatures; and though I doubt not at all, but living, as you have done, in a Chri&s;tian country, you have heard it often, perhaps a thou&s;and and a thou&s;and times, I will, with all &s;implicity and plainne&s;s, repeat it to you again, and repeat it as if you had never heard it before. If thou, O &s;inner, &s;hould&s;t now, for the fir&s;t time, feel it, then will it be as a new go&s;pel unto thee, though &s;o fa|miliar to thine ear; nor &s;hall it be grievous for me to &s;peak what is &s;o common, &s;ince to you it is &s;afe and ne|ce&s;&s;ary, Phil. 3, 1. They who are mo&s;t deeply and in|timately acquainted with it, in&s;tead of being cloyed and &s;atiated, will hear it with di&s;tingui&s;hed plea&s;ure; and as for tho&s;e who have hitherto &s;lighted it, I am &s;ure they had need to hear it again. Nor is it ab&s;olutely impo&s;|&s;ible that &s;ome one &s;oul, at lea&s;t, may read the&s;e lines who hath never been clearly and fully in&s;tructed in this important doctrine, though his everla&s;ting All de|pends on knowing and receiving it. I will therefore take care that &s;uch a one &s;hall not have it to plead at the bar of God, that tho' he lived in a Chri&s;tian coun|try, he was never plainly and faithfully taught the doctrine of &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <Q>the way, the
<PB N="72" REF="021060_0085_0FB21014A11F33C8">
truth, and the life, by whom alone we come unto the Father, John 14, 6.</Q></P>
<P N="4">&sect; 4. I do therefore te&s;tify unto you this day, that the holy and gracious Maje&s;ty of heaven and earth, fore&s;ee|ing the fatal apo&s;tacy into which the whole human race would fall, did not determine to deal in a way of &s;trict and rigorous &s;everity with us, &s;o as to con&s;ign us over to univer&s;al ruin and inevitable damnation; but, on the contrary, he determined to enter into a treaty of peace and reconciliation, and to publi&s;h to all, whom the go&s;pel &s;hould reach, the expre&s;s offers of life and glory, in a certain method, which his infinite wi&s;dom judged &s;uit|able to the purity of his nature, and the honour of his go|vernment. This method was indeed a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing one, which, familiar, as it is to our thoughts and our tongues, I cannot recollect and mention without great amazement. He determined to &s;end his own Son into the world, "the brightne&s;s of his glory, and the expre&s;s image of his per&s;on, Heb. 1, 3. partaker of his own di|vine perfections and honours, to be not merely a teacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and a me&s;&s;enger of grace, but al&s;o a &s;acrifice for the &s;ins of men; and would con&s;ent to his &s;aving them on no other condition but this, that he &s;hould not only labour, but die in the cau&s;e.</P>
<P N="5">&sect; 5. Accordingly, at &s;uch a period of time as infinite Wi&s;dom &s;aw mo&s;t convenient, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t ap|peared in human fle&s;h; and after he had gone through ince&s;&s;ant and long continued fatigues, and borne all the preceding injuries which the ingratitude and malice of men could inflict, he voluntarily <Q>&s;ubmitted him&s;elf to death, even the death of the cro&s;s; Phil. 2, 8.</Q> and having been <Q>delivered for our offences, was rai&s;|ed again for our ju&s;tification, Rom. 4, 25.</Q> After his re&s;urrection he continued long enough on earth to give his followers mo&s;t convincing evidences of it, and then "a&s;cended into heaven in their &s;ight, Acts 1, 9&mdash; 11;" and &s;ent down his Spirit from thence upon his apo&s;|tles, to enable them, in the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive and autho|ritative manner, to "preach the go&s;pel, Luke 24, 40:" and he has given it in charge to them, and to tho&s;e who,
<PB N="73" REF="021060_0086_0FB2101616FB0A98">
in every age, &s;ucceed them in this part of their office, that it &s;hould be publi&s;hed "to every creature, Mark. 16, 15;" that all who believe in it may be &s;aved, by virtue of its abiding energy, and the immutable power and grace of its divine author, who is, <Q>the &s;ame ye&s;|terday, to-day and for ever, Heb. 13, 8.</Q></P>
<P N="6">&sect; 6. This go&s;pel do I therefore now preach, and pro|claim unto thee, O reader, with the &s;incere&s;t de&s;ire that, through divine grace, it may this very day be <Q>&s;alva|tion to thy &s;oul, Luke 19, 9.</Q> Know therefore, and con&s;ider it, who&s;oever thou art, that as &s;urely as the&s;e words are now before thine eyes, &s;o &s;ure it is that the incarnate Son of God "was made a &s;pectacle to the world, and to "angels, and to men, 1 Cor. 4, 9;" his back torn with &s;courges, his head with thorns, his limbs &s;tretched out as on a rack, and nailed to the accur&s;ed tree; and in this mi&s;erable condition he was hung up by his hands and his feet, as an object of public infamy and contempt. Thus did he die, in the mid&s;t of all the taunts and in&s;ults of his cruel enemies who thir&s;ted for his blood; and which was the &s;adde&s;t circum&s;tance of all, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e agonies with which he clo&s;ed the mo&s;t innocent, perfect, and u&s;eful life that ever was &s;pent upon earth, he had not tho&s;e &s;upports of the divine pre&s;ence which &s;inful men have often ex|perienced, when they have been &s;uffering for the te&s;ti|mony of their con&s;cience. They have often bur&s;t out into tran&s;ports of joy and &s;ongs of prai&s;e while their ex|ecutioners have been glutting their helli&s;h malice, and more than &s;avage barbarity, by making their tor|ments artificially grievous; but the crucified Je&s;us cried out, in the di&s;tre&s;s of his &s;potle&s;s and holy &s;oul, <Q>My God, my God, why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me? Matth. 27, 46.</Q></P>
<P N="7">&sect; 7. Look upon our dear Redeemer! Look up to this mournful, dreadful, yet, in one view, delightful &s;pectacle, and then a&s;k thine own heart, Do ye believe that Je&s;us &s;uffered and died thus? and why did he &s;uf|fer and die? Let me an&s;wer in God's own words, <Q>He was wounded for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, he was brui&s;ed for our iniquities, and the cha&s;ti&s;ement of our peace was
<PB N="74" REF="021060_0087_0FB21017B7630420">
upon him, that by his &s;tripes we might be healed: it plea&s;ed the Lord to brui&s;e him, and to put him to grief, when he made his &s;oul an offering for &s;in?</Q> for, the Lord "laid on him the iniquity of us all, I&s;a. 53, 5.6.10. So that I may addre&s;s you in the words of the Apo&s;tle, <Q>Be it known unto you therefore, that through this man is preached unto you the forgive|ne&s;s of &s;in, Acts 13, 38.</Q> as it was his command, ju&s;t after he aro&s;e from the dead, that <Q>repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of his &s;ins &s;hould be preached in his name unto all nations, beginning at Jeru&s;alem, Luke 24, 47;</Q> the very place where his blood had &s;o lately been &s;hed in &s;o cruel a manner. I do therefore te&s;tify unto you, in the words of another in&s;pired writer, that "Chri&s;t was made &s;in," that is, a &s;in-offering, "for us though he knew no &s;in, that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him, 2 Cor. 5, 21;" that is, that through the righteou&s;ne&s;s he has fulfilled, and the atonement he has made, we might be accepted by God as righteous, and be not only pardoned, but re|ceived into his favour. <Q>To you is the word of this &s;alvation &s;ent, Acts 13, 26;</Q> and to you, O reader, are the ble&s;&s;ings of it even now offered by God; &s;in|cerely offered; &s;o that, after all I have &s;aid under the former heads, it is not your having broken the law of God that &s;hall prove your ruin, if you do not al&s;o reject his go&s;pel. It is not all tho&s;e legions of &s;ins which ri&s;e up in battle array again&s;t you that &s;hall be able to de|&s;troy you, if unbelief do not lead them on, and final impenitence do not bring up the rear. I know that guilt is a timorous thing: I will therefore &s;peak in the words of God him&s;elf; nor can any be more comfort|able: <Q>He that believeth on the Son hath everla&s;ting life, John 3, 36; and he &s;hall never come into con|demnation, John 5, 24: there is therefore now no condemnation,</Q> no kind or degree of it, to them, to any one of them, <Q>who are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who walk not after the fle&s;h, but after the Spirit, Rom. 8, 1.</Q> You have indeed been a very great &s;inner, and your offences have truly been attended with mo&s;t heinous aggravations; neverthele&s;s, you may rejoice in

the a&s;&s;urance, that <Q>where &s;in hath abounded, there &s;hall grace much more abound, Rom. 5, 20; that where &s;in hath reigned unto death,</Q> where it has had its mo&s;t unlimited &s;way, and mo&s;t unre&s;i&s;ted tri|umph, there &s;hall <Q>righteou&s;ne&s;s reign to eternal life through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord, Rom. 5, 21.</Q> That righteou&s;ne&s;s, to which, on believing on him, thou wilt be entitled, &s;hall not only break tho&s;e chains by which &s;in is (as it were) dragging thee at its chariot wheels with a furious pace to eternal ruin, but it &s;hall clothe thee with the robes of &s;alvation, &s;hall &s;ix thee on a throne of glory, where thou &s;halt live and reign for ever among the princes of heaven; &s;halt reign in immortal beauty and joy, without one remaining &s;car of divine di&s;plea&s;ure upon thee, without any &s;ingle mark by which it could be known that thou had&s;t ever been obnoxious to wrath and a cur&s;e; except it be an anthem of prai&s;e, to "the Lamb that was &s;lain, and "has wa&s;hed thee from thy &s;ins in his own blood, Rev. 1, 5.</P>

Nor is it nece&s;&s;ary, in order to thy being re|lea&s;ed from guilt, and entitled to this high and com|plete felicity, that thou &s;hould&s;t, before thou wilt ven|ture to apply to Je&s;us, bring any good works of thine own to recommend thee to his acceptance.

<P>OH, my &s;oul, how a&s;toni&s;hing is the me&s;&s;age which thou ha&s;t this day received! I have indeed often heard it before, and it is grown &s;o common to me that the &s;urpri&s;e is not &s;en&s;ible: but reflect, O my &s;oul, what it is thou ha&s;t heard, and &s;ay, whether the name of the Saviour, who&s;e me&s;&s;age it is, may not well be called, "Wonderful Coun&s;ellor, I&s;a. 9, 6," when he di&s;plays before thee &s;uch wonders of love, and propo&s;es to thee &s;uch coun&s;els of peace!</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, is it indeed thus! Is it not the fiction of the human mind? &s;urely it is not! What human mind could have invented or conceived it? Is it a plain certain fact, that thou did&s;t leave the magnificence and joy of the heavenly world in compa&s;&s;ion to &s;uch a wretch as I? Oh, had&s;t thou from that height of dig|nity and felicity only looked down upon me for a mo|ment, and &s;ent &s;ome gracious word to me for my di|rection and comfort even by the lea&s;t of thy &s;ervants, ju&s;tly and might I have pro&s;trated my&s;elf in grateful admiration, and have ki&s;&s;ed the very foot&s;teps of him that publi&s;hed &s;alvation, I&s;a. 52, 7. But did&s;t thou conde&s;cend to be thy&s;elf the me&s;&s;enger! What grace had that been though thou had&s;t but once in per&s;on made the declaration, and immediately returned back to the throne, from whence divine compa&s;&s;ion brought thee down? But this is not all the triumph of thine il|lu&s;trious grace: it not only brought thee down to earth, but kept thee here in a frail and wretched tabernacle for long &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years, and at length it co&s;t thee thy life, and &s;tretched thee out as a malefactor upon the cro&s;s, af|ter thou ha&s;t borne in&s;ult and cruelty, which it may ju&s;tly wound my heart &s;o much as to think of: and thus thou ha&s;t atoned injured ju&s;tice, and <Q>redeemed me to God with thine own blood, Rev. 5, 9.</Q></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">&sect; 1. I NOW con&s;ider you, my dear reader, as com|ing to me with the enquiry which the Jews once addre&s;&s;ed to our Lord. "What &s;hall we do that we may work the works of God, John 6, 28?" what method &s;hall I take to &s;ecure that redemption and &s;al|vation which I am told Chri&s;t has procured for his peo|ple? I would an&s;wer it as &s;eriou&s;ly and carefully as po&s;|&s;ible, as one that knows of what importance it is to you to be rightly informed; and that knows al&s;o how &s;trictly he is to an&s;wer to God for the &s;incerity and care with which the reply is made. May I be enabled to "&s;peak as his oracle, 1 Pet. 4, 11." that is, in &s;uch a manner as faithfully to echo back what the &s;acred o|racles teach!</P>
<P N="2">&sect; 2. And here, that I may be &s;ure to follow the &s;afe&s;t guides, and the faire&s;t examples, I mu&s;t preach &s;alvati|on to you, in the way of <Q>repentance towards God, and of faith in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Acts 20, 21;</Q> that Good old doctrine which the apo&s;tles preached, and which no man can pretend to change, but at the peril of his own &s;oul and of theirs who attend to him.</P>
<P N="3">&sect; 3. I &s;uppo&s;e that you are by this time convinced of your guilt and condemnation, and of your own ina|bility to recover your&s;elf. Let me, neverthele&s;s, urge you to feel that conviction yet more deeply, and to im|pre&s;s it with yet greater weight upon your &s;oul; that you have "undone your&s;elf," and that <Q>in your&s;elf is not your help found, Ho&s;ea 13, 9.</Q> Be per&s;uaded, therefore, expre&s;sly and &s;olemnly, and &s;incerely, to give up all &s;elf-dependence, which, if you do not guard again&s;t it, will be ready to return &s;ecretly, before it is ob&s;erv|ed, and will lead you to attempt building up what you have ju&s;t been de&s;troying.</P>
<P N="4">&sect; 4. Be a&s;&s;ured, that if ever you are &s;aved, you mu&s;t a&s;cribe that &s;alvation entirely to the free grace of God. If, guilty and mi&s;erable as you are, you are not only ac|cepted
<PB N="79" REF="021060_0092_0FB210257332B080">
but crowned, you mu&s;t "lay down your crown," with all humble acknowledgment, before the throne Rev. 4, 10. <Q>No fle&s;h mu&s;t glory in his pre&s;ence; but he that glorieth mu&s;t glory in the Lord: for of him are we in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who of God is made unto us wi&s;dom, and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;anctification, and redemption, 1 Cor. 1.29,&mdash;31.</Q> and you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible you are in &s;uch a &s;tate, as having none of the&s;e in your&s;elf, to need them in another. You mu&s;t there|fore be &s;en&s;ible that you are ignorant and guilty, pollut|ed, and en&s;laved; or, as our Lord expre&s;&s;es it, (with re|gard to &s;ome that were under a Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion,) that, as a &s;inner, <Q>you are wretched, and mi&s;erable, and poor, and blind, and naked, Rev. 3, 17.</Q></P>
<P N="5">&sect; 5. If the&s;e views be deeply impre&s;&s;ed upon your mind, you will be prepared to receive what I am now to &s;ay. Hear, therefore, in a few words, your duty, your remedy, and your &s;afety, which con&s;i&s;ts in this, <Q>That you mu&s;t apply to Chri&s;t with a deep abhorrence of your former &s;ins, and a firm re&s;olution of for&s;aking them; forming that re&s;olution in the &s;trength of his grace, and fixing your dependence on him for your ac|ceptance with God, even while you are purpo&s;ing to do your very be&s;t; and when you have actually done the be&s;t you ever will do in con&s;equence of that pur|po&s;e.</Q></P>
<P N="6">&sect; 6. The fir&s;t and mo&s;t important advice that I can give you in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances is, That "you look to Chri&s;t, and apply your&s;elf to him." And here, "&s;ay not in your heart, Who &s;hall a&s;cend into heaven, to bring him down to me Rom. 10, 6?" or, Who &s;hall rai&s;e me up thither to pre&s;ent me before him? The ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, "by whom all things con&s;i&s;t Col. 1, 17." by whom the whole &s;y&s;tem of them is &s;upported, for|gotten as he is by mo&s;t that bear his name, "is not far from any of us "Acts 17, 27;" nor could he have pro|mi&s;ed to have been, <Q>wherever two or three are met together in his name Mat. 18, 20,</Q> but in con&s;e|quence of tho&s;e truly divine perfections by which he is every where pre&s;ent. Would you therefore, O &s;inner, de&s;ire to be &s;aved? go to the Saviour: would you de&s;ire
<PB N="80" REF="021060_0093_0FB2102AF25383B0">
to be delivered, look to that great Deliverer; and though you &s;hould be overwhelmed with guilt, and &s;hame, and fear, and horror, that you &s;hould be incapa|ble of &s;peaking to him, fall down in this &s;peechle&s;s con|fu&s;ion at his feet, and <Q>behold him, as the Lamb "of God, that taketh away the &s;in of the world John 1, 29.</Q></P>
<P N="7">&sect; 7. Behold him therefore with an attentive eye, and &s;ay whether the &s;ight does not touch, and even melt, thy very heart? Do&s;t thou not feel what a fooli&s;h and what a wretched creature thou ha&s;t been, that for the &s;ake of &s;uch low and &s;ordid gratifications and intere&s;ts as tho&s;e which thou ha&s;t been pur&s;uing, thou &s;hould&s;t thus <Q>kill the Prince of life Acts 3, 15.</Q> Behold the deep wounds which he bore for thee. <Q>Look on him whom thou ha&s;t pierced, and &s;urely thou mu&s;t mourn Zech. 12, 10,</Q> unle&s;s thine heart be hardened into &s;tone. Which of thy pa&s;t &s;ins can&s;t thou reflect upon, and &s;ay, "For this it was worth my while thus to have injured my Saviour, and to have expo&s;ed the Son of God to &s;uch &s;ufferings!" And what future temptations can a|ri&s;e &s;o con&s;iderable, that thou &s;houlde&s;t &s;ay, <Q>For the &s;ake of this I will crucify my Lord again Heb. 6, 6?</Q> Sinner, thou mu&s;t repent; thou mu&s;t repent of every &s;in, and mu&s;t for&s;ake it; but if thou do&s;t it to any pur|po&s;e, I well know it mu&s;t be as at the foot of the cro&s;s. Thou mu&s;t &s;acrifice every lu&s;t, even the deare&s;t tho' it &s;hould be like a right hand, or a right eye Mat. 5.29.30; and therefore, that thou maye&s;t, if po&s;&s;ible, be an|imated to it, I have led thee to that altar, on which <Q>Chri&s;t him&s;elf was &s;acrificed for thee, an offering of a &s;weet-&s;melling &s;avour Eph. 5, 2. Thou mu&s;t yield up thy&s;elf to God, as one alive from the dead Rom. 6, 13;</Q> and therefore I have &s;howed thee at what a price he purcha&s;ed thee: <Q>For thou wa&s;t not redeemed with corruptible things, as &s;ilver and gold, but with the precious blood of the Son of God, that Lamb without blemi&s;h and without &s;pot 1 Pet. 1, 18.19.</Q> And now I would a&s;k thee, as before the Lord, what does thine own heart &s;ay to it? Art thou grieved for thy former offences? art thou willing to
<PB N="81" REF="021060_0094_0FB2102C9C3E8F70">
for&s;ake thy &s;ins? art thou willing to become the chear|ful, thankful &s;ervant of him, <Q>who hath purcha&s;ed thee with his own blood?</Q></P>
<P N="8">&sect; 8. I will &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a purpo&s;e as this ri&s;ing in thine heart: how determinate it is, and how effectual it may be, I know not; what different views may ari&s;e hereafter, or how &s;oon the pre&s;ent &s;en&s;e may wear off: but this I a&s;&s;uredly know, that thou wilt never &s;ee rea&s;on to change the&s;e views; for however thou may|e&s;t alter, the Lord <Q>Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the &s;ame ye&s;ter|day, to-day, and forever Heb. 13, 8:</Q> and the rea|&s;ons that now recommend repentance and faith, as fit and as nece&s;&s;ary, will continue invariable, as long as the perfections of the ble&s;&s;ed God are the &s;ame, and as long as his Son continues the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="9">&sect; 9. But while you have the&s;e views and the&s;e pur|po&s;es, I mu&s;t remind you, that this is not all that is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to your &s;alvation. You mu&s;t not only purpo&s;e, but, as God gives opportunity, you mu&s;t act as tho&s;e who are convinced of the evil of &s;in, and of the nece&s;&s;ity and excellence of holine&s;s: and that you may be enabled to do &s;o in other in&s;tances, you mu&s;t, in the fir&s;t place, and as the fir&s;t great work of God, (as our Lord him&s;elf calls it,) <Q>believe in him whom God hath &s;ent John 6, 29.</Q> You mu&s;t confide in him; <Q>mu&s;t commit your &s;oul into the hands of Chri&s;t, to be &s;aved by him in his own appointed method of &s;alvation.</Q> This is the great act of &s;aving faith; and I pray God that you may experimentally know what it means, &s;o as to be able to &s;ay with the apo&s;tle Paul, in the near view of death it&s;elf, <Q>I know whom I have believed, and am per|&s;uaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him until that day, 2 Tim. 1, 12;</Q> that great deci&s;ive day, which, if we are Chri&s;tians, we have always in view. To this I would urge you; and oh that I could be &s;o happy as to engage you to it while I am illu&s;trating it in this and the following ad|dre&s;&s;es! Be a&s;&s;ured you mu&s;t not apply your&s;elves im|mediately to God, as ab&s;olutely or in him&s;elf con&s;idered, in the neglect of a Mediator.

<P N="10">&sect; 10. Apply therefore to this glorious Redeemer, a|miable, (as he will appear to every believing eye,) in the blood which he &s;hed upon the cro&s;s, and in the wounds which he received there. Go to him, O &s;in|ner, this day, this moment, with all thy &s;ins about thee. Go ju&s;t as thou art; for if thou wilt never ap|ply to him till thou art fir&s;t righteous and holy, thou wilt never be righteous and holy at all; nor can&s;t be &s;o, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, unle&s;s there were &s;ome way of be|ing &s;o without him, and then there would be no occa|&s;ion for applying to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s. It were indeed as if it &s;hould be &s;aid, that a &s;ick man &s;hould defer his application to a phy&s;ician till his health be recovered. Let me, therefore, repeat it without offence, go to him ju&s;t as thou art, and &s;ay, (Oh that thou maye&s;t this moment be enabled to &s;ay it from thy very &s;oul!) <Q>Ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, I am &s;urely one of the mo&s;t &s;inful, and one of the mo&s;t mi&s;erable creatures that ever fell pro&s;trate before thee;</Q> neverthele&s;s, I come becau&s;e I have heard that thou did&s;t once &s;ay, <Q>Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you re&s;t, Matt. 11, 28.</Q> I come becau&s;e I have heard that thou did&s;t graciou&s;ly &s;ay, <Q>Him, that cometh unto me, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out, John 6, 37.</Q> O thou Prince of peace, O thou King of glory, I am a condemned mi&s;erable &s;in|ner.

O Lord, I have fooli&s;hly attempted to be mine own &s;a|viour, but it will not do: I am &s;en&s;ible the attempt is vain; and therefore I give it over, and look unto thee.

life too. The unmeaning words of the lips would be a vain mockery. The mo&s;t affectionate tran&s;port of the pa&s;&s;ions, &s;hould it be tran&s;ient and ineffectual, would be but like a blaze of &s;traw pre&s;ented in&s;tead of incen&s;e at his altar. With &s;uch humility, with &s;uch love, with &s;uch cordial &s;elf dedication and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of &s;oul, mu&s;t thou often pro&s;trate thy&s;elf in the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t: and then thou mu&s;t go away, and keep him in thy view; mu&s;t go away, and live unto God through him, "denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts," and behav|ing thy&s;elf <Q>&s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly, in this vain en&s;naring world, Tit. 2, 12.</Q> You mu&s;t make it your care to &s;hew your love by obedience; by form|ing your&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible according to the temper and manner of Je&s;us, in whom you believe.

<P N="12">&sect; 12. This, &s;o far as I have been able to learn from the word of God, is the way to &s;afety and glory; the &s;ure&s;t, the only way you can take. It is the way which every faithful mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t has trod, and is tread|ing; and the way to which, as he tenders the &s;alvation of his own &s;oul, he mu&s;t direct others. We cannot, we would not, alter it in favour of our&s;elves, or of our dear|e&s;t friends. It is the way in which alone, &s;o far as we can judge, it becomes the ble&s;&s;ed God to &s;ave his apo&s;|tate creatures. And therefore, reader, I be&s;eech and intreat you &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider it; and let your own con&s;cience an&s;wer, as in the pre&s;ence of God, whether you are willing to acquie&s;ce in it or not.

<P>I dare not deliberately &s;ay this method is unrea&s;onable. My con&s;cience te&s;tifies that I have &s;inned, and cannot be ju&s;tified before God as an innocent and obedient crea|ture. My con&s;cience tells me that all the&s;e humbling circum&s;tances are fit: that it is fit a convicted criminal &s;hould be brought upon his knees; that a captive rebel &s;hould give up the weapons of his rebellion, and bow before his &s;overeign, if he expects his life. Yea, my rea&s;on as well as my con&s;cience, tells me, that it is fit and nece&s;&s;ary that, if I am &s;aved at all, I &s;hould be &s;aved from the power and love of &s;in, as well as from the con|demnation of it; and that, if &s;overeign mercy gives me a new life, after having de&s;erved eternal death, it is mo&s;t fit I &s;hould <Q>yield my&s;elf to God as alive from the dead, Rom. 6, 13." But, Oh wretched man that I am, I feel a law in my members that wars again&s;t the law of my mind, Rom. 7, 23. 24</Q>, and oppo&s;es the conviction of my rea&s;on and con&s;cience. Who &s;hall deliver me from this bondage? who &s;hall make me willing to do that which I know in my own &s;oul to be mo&s;t expedient? O Lord &s;ubdue my heart, and let it not be drawn &s;o &s;trongly one way, while the nobler powers of my mind would direct it another! Conquer every licentious principle within, that it may be my joy to be wi&s;ely governed and re&s;trained! e&s;pe|cially &s;ubdue my pride, that lordly corruption which &s;o ill &s;uits an impoveri&s;hed and condemned creature; that thy way of &s;alvation may be amiable to me, in pro|portion to the degree in which it is humbling! I feel a di&s;po&s;ition to <Q>linger in Sodom, but, oh, be merciful to me, and pull me out of it, Gen. 19, 16,</Q> before the &s;torms of thy flaming vengeance fall, and there be no more e&s;caping!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. The Sinner &s;eriou&s;ly urged and intreated to accept of Salvation in this way.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Since many, who have been impre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e things, &s;uffer the impre&s;&s;ion to wear off in vain, &sect; <HI>1.</HI> Strongly as the ca&s;e &s;peaks for it&s;elf, &s;inners are to be intreated to accept this &s;alvation, &sect; <HI>2.</HI> Accordingly the reader is in|treated. <HI>(1.)</HI> By the Maje&s;ty and mercy of God, &sect; <HI>3. (2.)</HI> By the dying love of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &sect; <HI>4. (3.)</HI> By the regard due to fellow creatures, &sect; <HI>5. (4.)</HI> By the worth of his own immortal &s;oul, &sect; <HI>6.</HI> The mat|ter is &s;olemnly left with the reader, as before God, &sect; <HI>7.</HI> The &s;inner yielding to the&s;e intreaties, and declaring his acceptance of &s;alvation by Chri&s;t.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THUS far have I often known convictions and im|pre&s;&s;ions to ari&s;e, (if I might judge by the &s;trong|e&s;t appearances,) which, after all, have worn off again, Some unhappy circum&s;tance of external temptation, ever joined by the inward reluctance of an un&s;anctified heart, to this holy and humbling &s;cheme of redemption, has been the ruin of multitudes. And <Q>through the de|ceitfulne&s;s of &s;in, they have been hardened, Heb. 3, 13, till they &s;eem to have been utterly de|&s;troyed, and that without remedy, Prov. 29, 1.</Q> And therefore, O thou immortal creature, who art now reading the&s;e lines, I be&s;eech thee, that while affairs are in this critical &s;ituation; while there are the&s;e ba|lancings of mind between accepting and rejecting that glorious go&s;pel, which, in the integrity of my heart, I have now been laying before you, you would once more give me an attentive audience, while I plead in God's behalf (&s;hall I &s;ay?) or rather in your own; while <Q>as an amba&s;&s;ador for Chri&s;t, and as tho' God did be&s;eech you by me, I pray you in Chri&s;t's &s;tead, that you would be reconciled to God, 2 Cor. 5, 20;</Q> and would not, after the&s;e awakenings, and the&s;e in|quiries, be a madne&s;s, which it will &s;urely be the dole|ful
<PB N="88" REF="021060_0101_0FB20E7096A0BD68">
bu&s;ine&s;s of a mi&s;erable eternity to lament, reject this compa&s;&s;ionate coun&s;el of God towards you.</P>
<P N="2">&sect; 2. One would, indeed, imagine there &s;hould be no need of importunity here. One would conclude, that as &s;oon as peri&s;hing &s;inners are told that an offending God is ready to be reconciled; that he offers them a full pardon for all their aggravated &s;ins; yea, that he is willing to adopt them into his family now, that he may at length admit them to his heavenly pre&s;ence; all &s;hould, with the utmo&s;t readine&s;s and plea&s;ure, embrace &s;o kind a me&s;&s;age, and fall at his feet in &s;peechle&s;s tran&s;ports of a&s;toni&s;hment, gratitude and joy. But, alas! we find it much otherwi&s;e. We &s;ee multitudes quite unmoved, and the impre&s;&s;ions which are made on many more, are feeble and tran&s;ient. Le&s;t it &s;hould be thus with you, O reader, let me urge the me&s;&s;age with which I have the honour to be charged: let me entreat you to be reconciled to God, and to accept of pardon and &s;alvation in the way in which it is &s;o freely offered to you.</P>
<P N="3">&sect; 3. I intreat you, by the maje&s;ty of that God, in who&s;e name I come; who&s;e voice fills all heaven with reverence and obedience. He &s;peaks not in vain to le|gions of angels; but if there could be any contention a|mong tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirits, it would be, who &s;hould be fir&s;t to execute his commands. O let him not &s;peak in vain to a wretched mortal! I intreat you <Q>by the ter|rors of his wrath,</Q> who could &s;peak to you in thun|der; who could&punc; by one &s;ingle act of his will, cut off this precarious life of yours, and &s;end you down to hell. I be&s;eech you by his mercies, by his tender mercies; by the bowels of his compa&s;&s;ion which &s;till earn over you, as tho&s;e of a parent over a dear &s;on, over a tender child, whom, notwith&s;tanding his former ungrateful rebellions, "he earne&s;tly remembers &s;till, Jer. 31, 20." I be&s;eech and intreat you, by all this paternal goodne&s;s, that you do not (as it were) compel him to lo&s;e the character of the gentle parent in that of the righteous judge; &s;o that (as he threatens with regard to tho&s;e whom he had ju&s;t called his &s;ons and his daughters) <Q>a fire &s;hould be kin|dled in his anger, which &s;hould burn unto the lowe&s;t hell, Deut. 32, 19.22.</Q></P>

I be&s;eech you farther, by the name and love of our dying Saviour; I be&s;eech you by all the conde&s;cen|&s;ion of his incarnation; by that poverty to which he vo|luntarily &s;ubmitted, that you might be enriched with eternal trea&s;ures, 2 Cor. 8, 9; by all the gracious in|vitations which he gave, which &s;till &s;ound in his word, and &s;till coming (as it were) warm from his heart <Q>are &s;weeter than honey, or the honey comb, P&s;. 19, 10.</Q> I be&s;eech you by all his glorious works of power and wonder, which were al&s;o works of love. I be&s;eech you by the memory of the mo&s;t benevolent per&s;on, and the mo&s;t generous friend. I be&s;eech you by the memory of what he &s;uffered, as well as of what he &s;aid and did; by the agony which he endured in the garden, when his body was covered <Q>with a dew of blood, Luke 22, 44.</Q> I be&s;eech you by all that tender di&s;tre&s;s which he felt, when his deare&s;t friends <Q>for&s;ook him and fled, Matt. 26, 56</Q> and his blood thir&s;ty enemies dragged him away, like the meane&s;t of &s;laves, and like the vile&s;t of criminals. I be&s;eech you by the blows and brui&s;es, by the &s;tripes and la&s;hes, which this injured Sovereign endured while in their rebellious hands; by the &s;hame of &s;pitting, from which he hid not that kind and ve|nerable countenance, I&s;a. 50, 6. I be&s;eech you by the purple robe, the &s;ceptre of reed, and the crown of thorns, which this King of glory wore, that he might &s;et us among the princes of heaven, P&s;alm 113, 8. I be&s;eech you by the heavy burden of the cro&s;s, under which he panted, and toiled, and fainted, in the pain|ful way to Golgotha, John 19, 17, that he might free us from the burden of our &s;ins. I be&s;eech you by the remembrance of tho&s;e rude nails that tore the veins and arteries, the nerves and tendons, of his &s;acred hands and feet; and by that invincible, that triumphant good|ne&s;s, which, while the iron pierced his fle&s;h, engaged him to cry out, <Q>Father forgive them for they know not what they do, Luke 22, 34.</Q> I be&s;eech you by the unutterable angui&s;h which he bore when lifted up upon the cro&s;s, and extended there as on a rack, for &s;ix painful hours, that you open your heart to tho&s;e at|tractive influences, which have drawn to him thou&s;ands

I be&s;eech you by all that in&s;ult and deri&s;ion which the Lord of glory bore there, Matt. 27, 29&mdash;44; by that parching thir&s;t, which could hardly obtain the relief of vinegar, John 19, 28.29; by that doleful cry, &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing in the mouth of the only begotten of the Father, <Q>My God, my God, why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me? Matt. 27, 46.</Q> I be&s;eech you by the grace that &s;ubdued and pardoned a dying ma|lefactor, Luke 23, 42.43; by that compa&s;&s;ion for &s;in|ners, by that compa&s;&s;ion for you, which wrought in his heart, long as its vital motion continued, and which ended not when he <Q>bowed his head, &s;aying, It is fini&s;hed, and gave up the gho&s;t, John 19, 30.</Q> I be|&s;eech you by the triumphs of that re&s;urrection, by which he was <Q>declared to be the Son of God with power, by the Spirit of holine&s;s,</Q> which wrought to accom|pli&s;h it, Rom. 1, 4; by that gracious tenderne&s;s which attempered all tho&s;e triumphs, when he &s;aid to <Q>her out of whom he had ca&s;t &s;even devils,</Q> concerning his di&s;ciples who had treated him &s;o ba&s;ely, <Q>Go, tell my brother, I a&s;cend unto my Father and your Father, unto my God and your God, John 20, 17.</Q> I be&s;eech you by that conde&s;cen&s;ion with which he &s;aid to Tho|mas, when his unbelief had &s;uch an unrea&s;onable de|mand, <Q>Reach hither thy finger and behold my hands, and reach thither thine hand, and put it into my &s;ide; and be not faithle&s;s but believing, John 20, 27.</Q> I be&s;eech you by that generous and faithful care of his people, which he carried up with him to the regions of glory, and which engaged him to &s;end down his Spirit, in that rich profu&s;ion of miraculous gifts, to &s;pread the progre&s;s of his &s;aving word, Acts 2, 33. I be&s;eech you by that voice of &s;ympathy and power with which he &s;aid to Saul, while injuring his church, <Q>Saul, Saul, why per&s;ecute&s;t thou me? Acts 9, 4.</Q> by that generous goodne&s;s which &s;pared that pro&s;trate enemy, when he lay trembling at his feet, and rai&s;ed him to &s;uch a dignity as to be not inferior to the very chiefe&s;t apo&s;|tles, 2 Cor. 12, 11. I be&s;eech you by the memory of all that Chri&s;t hath already done, by the expectation of all he will farther do, for his people. I be&s;eech you at

<P N="5">&sect; 5. I be&s;eech you by all the bowels of compa&s;&s;ion which you owe to the faithful mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, who are &s;tudying and labouring, preaching and praying, wearing out their time, exhau&s;ting their &s;trength, and, very probably, &s;hortening their lives, for the &s;alvation of your &s;oul, and of &s;ouls like yours. I be&s;eech you by the affection with which all that love our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in &s;incerity, long to &s;ee you brought back to him.

I be&s;eech you by the great expectation of that important day, <Q>when the Lord Je&s;us &s;hall be revealed from heaven, 2 The&s;&s;. 1, 7;</Q> by "the terrors of a di&s;&s;olving world 2 Pet. 3, 10;" by "the &s;ound of the arch-angel's trumpet," and of that infinitely more awful &s;entence, "Come ye, ble&s;&s;ed," and "Depart, ye cur&s;ed," with which that grand &s;o|lemnity &s;hall clo&s;e, Matt. 25, 34.41.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">&sect; 1. I WOULD humbly hope that the preceding chapters will be the means of awakening &s;ome &s;tupid and in&s;en&s;ible &s;inners; the means of convincing them of their need of go&s;pel &s;alvation, and of engaging &s;ome cordially to accept it. Yet I cannot flatter my&s;elf &s;o far as to hope this &s;hould be the ca&s;e with regard to all into who&s;e hands this book &s;hall come. What <Q>am I, alas, better than my fathers, 1 Kings 19, 4,</Q> or better than my brethren, who have, in all ages, been repeating their complaints, with regard to multitudes, that they <Q>have &s;tretched out their hands all the day long to a di&s;obedient a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> gain&s;aying people?

<PB REF="021060_0108_0FB20E8122889B50">
&s;aid. Here, therefore, we mu&s;t part; in this chapter I mu&s;t take my leave of them; and, oh, that I could do it in &s;uch a manner as to fix, at parting, &s;ome convictions upon their hearts; that, though I &s;eem to leave them for a little while, and &s;end them back to review again the former chapters, as tho&s;e in which alone they have any pre&s;ent concern, they might &s;oon, as it were, over|take me again, and find a &s;uitablene&s;s in the remaining part of this di&s;cour&s;e, which at pre&s;ent they cannot po&s;|&s;ibly find. Unhappy creatures! I quit you, as a phy&s;i|cian quits a patient whom he loves, and is ju&s;t about to give over as incurable; he returns again and again, and re-examines the &s;everal &s;ymptoms, to ob&s;erve whether there be not &s;ome one of them more favourable than the re&s;t, which may encourage a renewed application.</P>
<P N="2">&sect; 2. So would I once more return to you. You do not find in your&s;elf any di&s;po&s;ition to embrace the go&s;|pel, to apply your&s;elf to Chri&s;t, to give your&s;elf up to the &s;ervice of God, and to make religion the bu&s;ine&s;s of your life. But, if I cannot prevail upon you to do this, let me engage you at lea&s;t to an&s;wer me, or rather to an&s;wer your own con&s;cience, <Q>Why you will not do it?</Q> Is it owing to any &s;ecret di&s;belief of the great principles of religion? If it be, the ca&s;e is different from what I have yet con&s;idered, and the cure mu&s;t be differ|ent. This is not a place to combat with the &s;cruples of infidelity. Neverthele&s;s, I would de&s;ire you &s;eriou&s;ly to inquire how far tho&s;e &s;cruples extend.

Study the argument as for your life; for much more than life depends on it. See how far you are &s;a|tisfied, and why that &s;atisfaction reaches no farther. Compare evidences on both &s;ides. And, above all, con|&s;ider the de&s;ign and tendency of the New Te&s;tament, to what it would lead you, and all them that cordially obey it; and then &s;ay whether it be not good.

With plea&s;ure do I now turn my&s;elf to tho&s;e who will hear me with more regard.

<P N="2">&sect; 2. It is very po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome afflicted creature maybe ready to cry out, It is enough: aggravate my grief and my di&s;tre&s;s no more. The &s;entence you have been &s;o awfully de&s;cribing, as what &s;hall be pa&s;&s;ed and execut|ed on the impenitent and unbelieving, is my &s;entence; and the terrors of it, are my terrors. For <Q>mine ini|quities are gone up unto the heavens Rev. 18, 5,</Q> and my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions have reached unto the clouds. My ca&s;e is quite &s;ingular. Surely there never was &s;o great a &s;inner as I. I have received &s;o many mercies, I have enjoyed &s;o many advantages, I have heard &s;o ma|ny invitations of go&s;pel grace; and yet my heart has been &s;o hard, and my nature is &s;o exceeding &s;inful, and the number and aggravating circum&s;tances of my pro|vocations have been &s;uch, that I dare not hope. It is enough that God hath &s;upported me thus long; it is e|nough that, after &s;o many years of wickedne&s;s, I am yet out of hell. Every day's reprieve is a mercy at which I am a&s;toni&s;hed. I lie down and wonder, that death and damnation have not &s;eized me in my walks the day pa&s;t. I ari&s;e and wonder that my bed hath not been my grave; wonder, that my &s;oul is not &s;eparated from fle&s;h, and &s;urrounded with devils and damned &s;pirits.</P>

grace are things in which I fear I have no part, and mu&s;t expect none. There are exceeding rich and precious promi&s;es in the word of God; but they are to me as a &s;ealed book, and are hid from me as to any per&s;onal u&s;e. I know Chri&s;t is able to &s;ave; I know he is willing to &s;ave &s;ome; but that he &s;hould be willing to &s;ave me, &s;uch a poluted, &s;uch a provoking creature, as, God knows, and as con&s;cience knows, I have been, and to this day am; this I know not how to believe; and the utmo&s;t that I can do towards believing it is to acknow|ledge that it is not ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, and that I do not yet lye down in complete de&s;pair; though, alas! I &s;eem upon the very borders of it, and expect every day and hour to fall into it.</P>

I &s;hould not, perhaps, have entered &s;o fully into this ca&s;e if I had not &s;een many in it; and I will add, reader, for your encouragement, if it be your ca&s;e, &s;everal who are now in the number of the mo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, chearful, and u&s;eful Chri&s;tians. And I hope divine grace will add you to the re&s;t, if "out of the&s;e depths" you be enabled to "cry unto God P&s;al. 130, 1;" and though, like Jonah, you may &s;eem to be "ca&s;t out from his pre&s;ence," yet &s;till, with Jonah, you "look towards his holy temple Jonah 2, 4."</P>
<P N="5">&sect; 5. Let it not be imagined that it is in any neglect of that ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, who&s;e office it is to be the great Comforter, that I now attempt to rea&s;on you out of this di&s;con&s;olate frame; for it is as the great &s;ource of rea|&s;on that he deals with rational creatures, and it is in the u&s;e of rational means and con&s;iderations that he may mo&s;t ju&s;tly be expected to operate. Give me leave, therefore to addre&s;s my&s;elf calmly to you, and to a&s;k you what rea&s;on you have for all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ionate complaints and accu&s;ations again&s;t your&s;elf? what rea&s;on have you to &s;ugge&s;t that your ca&s;e is &s;ingular, when &s;o many have told you they have felt the &s;ame? what rea&s;on have you to conclude &s;o hardly again&s;t your&s;elf, when the go&s;pel &s;peaks in &s;uch favourable terms? or what rea&s;on to imagine that the gracious things it &s;ays are not intended for you?

Nay though it would be daring wickedne&s;s and mon&s;trous folly for any "to &s;in that grace might abound Rom. 6, 1," yet had you indeed rai&s;ed your account beyond all that divine grace has ever yet pardoned, who &s;hould <Q>limit the holy One of I&s;rael P&s;al. 78, 41?</Q> or who &s;hould pretend to &s;ay that it was impo&s;&s;ible that God might, for your very wretchedne&s;s chu&s;e you out from others, to make you a monument of mercy, and a trophy of hitherto unparalleled grace?

great danger there is of &s;elf-flattery on this important head; and how nece&s;&s;ary is it to caution men again&s;t too ha&s;ty a conclu&s;ion that they are really converted, becau&s;e they have felt &s;ome warm emotion on their minds, and have reformed the gro&s;s irregularities of their former conduct. A mi&s;take here might be in|finitely fatal; it may prove the occa&s;ion of that fal&s;e peace, which &s;hall lead a man to ble&s;s him&s;elf in his own heart, and to conclude him&s;elf &s;ecure, while all the threatenings and cur&s;es of God's law are &s;ounding in his ears, and lye indeed directly again&s;t him Deut. 29, 19.20; while, in the mean time he applies to him|&s;elf a thou&s;and promi&s;es, in which he has no &s;hare; which may prove therefore, like generous wine to a man in an high fever, or &s;trong opiates to one in a lethargy. The &s;tony ground received the word with joy, and a promi|&s;ing harve&s;t &s;eemed to be &s;pringing up; yet it &s;oon wi|thered away Matth. 13, 5.6, and no reaper filled his arms with it. Now, that this may not be the ca&s;e with you, that all my labours and yours hitherto may not be lo&s;t, and that a vain dream of &s;ecurity and happine&s;s may not plunge you deeper in mi&s;ery and ruin, give me leave to lead you into a &s;erious inquiry into your own heart; that &s;o you may be better able to judge of your ca&s;e, and to di&s;tingui&s;h between what is at mo&s;t being only near the kingdom of heaven, and becoming indeed a member of it.</P>
<P N="2">&sect; 2. Now this depends upon the &s;incerity of your faith in Chri&s;t, when faith is taken in its large&s;t extent, as explained above; that is as comprehending repent|ance, and that &s;teady purpo&s;e of new and univer&s;al obe|dience of which, wherever it is real, faith will a&s;&s;ured|ly be the vital principle. Therefore to a&s;&s;i&s;t you in judging of your &s;tate, give me leave to a&s;k you, or ra|ther to intreat you to a&s;k your&s;elf, What views you have had, and now have of &s;in, and of Chri&s;t? and what your future purpo&s;es are with regard to your conduct in the remainder of life that may lye before you? I &s;hall not rea&s;on largely upon the &s;everal particulars I &s;ugge&s;t under the&s;e heads, but rather refer you to your own reading and ob&s;ervation, to judge how agreeable they are to the word of God, the great rule by which

our characters mu&s;t quickly be tried, and our eternal &s;tate unalterably determined.</P>
<P N="3">&sect; 3. Inquire &s;eriou&s;ly, in the fir&s;t place, what views you have had of &s;in, and, what &s;entiments you have felt in your &s;oul with regard to it. There was a time when it wore a flattering a&s;pect, and made a fair in|chanting appearance, &s;o that all your heart was charm|ed with it, and it was the very bu&s;ine&s;s of your life to practi&s;e it. But you have &s;ince been undeceived: you have felt it <Q>bite like a &s;erpent, and &s;ting like an ad|der Prov. 23, 32:</Q> you have beheld it with an abhor|rence far greater than the delight which it ever gave you. So far it is well. It is thus with every true penitent, and with &s;ome I fear who are not of that number. Let me, therefore inquire farther, whence aro&s;e this abhor|rence? Was it merely from a principle of &s;elf love? was it merely becau&s;e you had been wounded by it; was it merely becau&s;e you had thereby brought condemnation and ruin upon your own &s;oul? Was there no &s;en&s;e of its deformity, of its ba&s;ene&s;s, of its malignity, as committed again&s;t the ble&s;&s;ed God, con&s;idered as a glorious, a bountiful, and a merciful being? Were you never pierc|ed by an apprehen&s;ion of its vile ingratitude? And as for tho&s;e purpo&s;es which have ari&s;en in your heart a|gain&s;t it, let me be&s;eech you to reflect how they have been formed, and how they have hitherto been executed. Have they been univer&s;al? have they been re&s;olute? and yet, amid&s;t all that re&s;olution, have they been humble? When you declared war with &s;in, was it with every &s;in? and is it an irreconcileable war which you determine by divine grace to pu&s;h on, till you have en|tirely conquered it, or die in the attempt? And are you accordingly active in your endeavours to &s;ubdue and de&s;troy it? If &s;o, what are <Q>the fruits worthy or re|pentance which you bring forth Luke 3, 8?</Q> It does not, I hope, all flow away in floods of grief: have you <Q>cea&s;ed to do evil? are you learning to do well I&s;a. 1, 16.17?</Q> Doth your reformation &s;how that you repent of your &s;ins; or do your renewed relap&s;es into &s;in prove that you repent even of what you call your repentance? Have you an inward abhorrence of all &s;in, and an un&s;eigned zeal again&s;t it? And doth that pro|duce

Are you now convinced they will not &s;uffice; and that you mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the Lamb which God hath provided? Have you had a view of Je&s;us, as <Q>taking away the &s;in of the world John 1, 29? as made a &s;in-offering for us, though he knew no &s;in, that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him 2 Cor. 5, 21?</Q> Have you viewed him as perfectly righteous in him&s;elf; and de&s;pairing of being ju&s;tified by any righteou&s;ne&s;s of your own, have you "&s;ubmitted to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God Rom. 10, 3?" Has your heart ever been brought to a deep conviction of this important truth, that if ever your are &s;aved at all, it mu&s;t be through Chri&s;t; that if ever God extend mercy to you at all, it mu&s;t be for his &s;ake; that if ever you are fixed in the temple of God above, you mu&s;t &s;tand there as an ever|la&s;ting

And to cheri&s;h the&s;e &s;acred influences, you will often have recour&s;e to &s;erious con&s;ideration and meditation: you will ab&s;tain from tho&s;e &s;ins which tend to grieve him: you will improve the tender &s;ea&s;ons in which he &s;eems to breathe upon your &s;oul; you will &s;trive earne&s;tly with God in prayer, that you may have him <Q>&s;hed on you &s;till more abundantly through Je&s;us Chri&s;t Tit. 3, 6:</Q> and you will be de&s;irous to fall in with the great end of his mi&s;&s;ion, which was to <Q>glorify Chri&s;t John 16, 14,</Q> and to e&s;tabli&s;h his kingdom.

And e&s;pecially, you will be deeply &s;en&s;ible of your guilt; the remembrance of which will fill you with &s;hame and confu&s;ion, even when you have &s;ome rea&s;on to hope it is forgiven. This will forbid all haughtine&s;s and in&s;olence in your behaviour to your fellow creatures. It will teach you under afflictive pro|vidences, with all holy &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to <Q>bear the in|dignation of the Lord," as tho&s;e that know they have &s;inned again&s;t him Micah 7, 9.</Q>&mdash;Again, if you are a Chri&s;tian indeed, you will labour after <Q>pu|rity of &s;oul,</Q> and maintain a fixed abhorrence of all prohibited &s;en&s;ual indulgence. A recollection of pa&s;t impurities will fill you with &s;hame and grief; and you will endeavour for the future to guard your thoughts and de&s;ires, as well as your words and actions, and to ab&s;tain not only from the commi&s;&s;ion of evil, but from the di&s;tant appearance and probable occa&s;ions of it 1 The&s;. 5, 22; as con&s;cious of the perfect holine&s;s of that God with whom you conver&s;e, and of the purifying nature of that hope 1 John 3, 3, which, by has go&s;pel, he hath taught you to entertain.</P>

It will mode|rate your de&s;ires of tho&s;e wordly enjoyments, after which many feel &s;uch an in&s;atiable thir&s;t, ever growing with indulgence and &s;ucce&s;s. You will guard again&s;t an immoderate care about tho&s;e things which would lead you into a forgetfulne&s;s of your heavenly inheritance. If Providence di&s;appoint your undertaking, you will &s;ubmit. If others be more pro&s;perous, you will not en|vy them; but rather will be thankful for what God is plea&s;ed to be&s;tow upon them, as well as for what he gives you. No unlawful methods will be u&s;ed to alter your pre&s;ent condition; and whatever it is, you will endeavour to make the be&s;t of it; remembering it is what infinite Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s have appointed you, and that it is beyond all compari&s;on better than you have de&s;erved; yea, that the very deficiencies and inconveniencies of it may conduce to the improvement of your future and complete happine&s;s.</P>

As you are &s;en&s;ible of your own rights, you will be &s;en&s;ible of his; as you &s;upport your own character, you will &s;up|port his.

So far as this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ch of the Chri&s;tian temper prevails in your heart, you will take care to avoid every thing which might give unnece&s;&s;ary offence to others; you will be|have your&s;elf in a mode&s;t manner, according to your &s;tati|on; and it will work, both with regard to &s;uperiors and inferiors; teaching you duly to honor the one, and not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> overbear or oppre&s;s the other.

Having thus briefly illu&s;trated the principle branches of the Chri&s;tian temper and character, I &s;hall conclude the repre&s;entation with reminding you of &s;ome general qualifications, which mu&s;t be mingled with all, and give a tincture to each of them; &s;uch as &s;incerity, con&s;tancy, tenderne&s;s, zeal and prudence.</P>
<P N="25">&sect; 25. Always remember, <Q>that &s;incerity is the very &s;oul of true religion.</Q> A &s;ingle intention to plea&s;e God, and to approve our&s;elves to him mu&s;t animate and govern all that we do in it. Under the influence of this principle you will impartially inquire into every intimation of duty, and apply to the practice of it &s;o far as it is known to you. Your heart will be engaged in all you do. Your conduct in private and in &s;ecret will be agreeable to your mo&s;t public behaviour. A &s;en&s;e of the divine authority will teach you to <Q>e&s;teem all God's precepts concerning all things to be right, and to hate every fal&s;e way P&s;al. 119, 128.</Q></P>
<P N="26">&sect; 26. Thus are you <Q>in &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity to have your conver&s;ation in the world 2 Cor. 1, 12.</Q> And you are al&s;o to charge it upon your &s;oul to be "&s;ted|fa&s;t and <Q>immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord 1 Cor. 15, 58.</Q> There mu&s;t not only be &s;ome &s;udden fits and &s;tarts of devotion, or of &s;omething which looks like it, but religion mu&s;t be an habitual and permanent thing. There mu&s;t be a purpo&s;e to adhere to it at all times. It mu&s;t be made the &s;tated and ordi|nary bu&s;ine&s;s of life. Deliberate and pre&s;umptuous &s;in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mu&s;t be carefully avoided; a guard mu&s;t be maintained again&s;t the common infirmities of life; and falls of one kind or of another mu&s;t be matter of proportionable hu|miliation before God, and mu&s;t occa&s;ion renewed re&s;o|lution for his &s;ervice. And thus you are to go on to the end of your life, not di&s;couraged by the length and dif|ficulty of the way, nor allured on the one hand, or teri+fied on the other, by all the various temptations which may &s;urround and a&s;&s;ault you. Your &s;oul mu&s;t be fir|ed on this ba&s;is, and you are &s;till to behave your&s;elf as

<P N="27">&sect; 27. Again, &s;o far as the go&s;pel prevails in your heart, <Q>your &s;pirit will be tender, and the &s;tone will be transformed into fle&s;h.</Q> You will de&s;ire that your apprehen&s;ion of divine things may be quick, your affections ready to take proper impre&s;&s;ions, your con&s;ci|ence always ea&s;ily touched, and, on the whole, your re&s;olutions pliant to the divine authority, and cordially willing to be, and to do, whatever God &s;hall appoint. You will have a tender regard to the word of God, a tender caution again&s;t &s;in, a tender guard again&s;t the &s;nares of pro&s;perity, a tender &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to God's afflict|ing hand: in a word, you will be tender wherever the divine honour is concerned; and careful neither to do any thing your&s;elf, nor to allow any thing in another, &s;o far as you can influence, by which God &s;hould be of|fended, or religion reproached.</P>
<P N="28">&sect; 28. Nay, more than all this, you will, &s;o far as true Chri&s;tianity governs in your mind, <Q>exert an holy zeal in the &s;ervice of your Redeemer and your Father.</Q> You will be zealou&s;ly affected in every good thing Gal. 4, 18. in proportion to its apprehended goodne&s;s and im|portance. You will be zealous e&s;pecially to correct what is irregular in your&s;elves, and to act to the utmo&s;t of your ability for the cau&s;e of God. Nor will you be a|ble to look with an indifferent eye on the conduct of others in this view; but, &s;o far as charity, meekne&s;s, and prudence will admit, you will te&s;tify your di&s;ap|probation of every thing in it which is di&s;honourable to God and injurious to men. And you will labour not only to reclaim men from &s;uch cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s, but to engage them to religion, and to quicken them in it.</P>
<P N="29">&sect; 29. And, once more, you will de&s;ire <Q>to u&s;e the prudence which God hath given you,</Q> in judging what is, in pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, your duty to God, your neighbour and your&s;elf; what will be, on the whole, the mo&s;t acceptable manner of di&s;charging it, and how far it may be mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly pur&s;ued; as remembering, that he is indeed the wi&s;e&s;t and the happie&s;t man who, by con&s;tant attention of thought, di&s;|covers

I HAVE now laid before you a plan of that tem|per and character which the go&s;pel requires, and which, if you are a true Chri&s;tian, you will de&s;ire and pur&s;ue. Surely there is in the very de&s;cription of it, &s;omething which mu&s;t powerfully &s;trike every mind, which has any ta&s;te for what is truly beautiful and ex|cellent. And I que&s;tion not, but you, my dear reader, will feel &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion of it upon your heart.

You &s;ee how rea&s;onable it is, and what de&s;irable con&s;equences ne|ce&s;&s;arily attend it, and the a&s;pect which it bears on your pre&s;ent enjoyment, and your future happine&s;s; and therefore are determined you will act accordingly. But give me leave &s;eriou&s;ly to remind you how many there have been (would to God that &s;everal of the in&s;tances had not happened within the compa&s;s of my per&s;onal ob&s;ervation!) <Q>who&s;e goodne&s;s hath been like a morn|ing cloud, and the early dew, which &s;oon pa&s;&s;eth a|way Ho&s;. 6, 4.</Q>&mdash;There is not room indeed ab&s;o|lutely to apply the words of Jo&s;hua taken in the mo&s;t rigorous &s;en&s;e, when he &s;aid to I&s;rael, (that he might humble their too ha&s;ty and &s;anguine re&s;olutions,) "You cannot &s;erve the Lord Jo&s;h. 24, 19."

Accordingly, if you give your&s;elf leave to con|&s;ult Scripture on this head, (and if you would live like a Chri&s;tian, you mu&s;t be con&s;ulting it every day, and forming your notions and actions by it,) you will &s;ee, that the whole tenor of it teaches that dependence up|on God which I am now recommending. You will particularly &s;ee, that the production of religion in the &s;oul is matter of divine promi&s;e; that when it has been effected, Scripture a&s;cribes it to a divine agency, and that the increa&s;e of grace and piety in the heart of tho&s;e who are truly regenerate, is al&s;o &s;poken of as the work of God, who begins and carrys it on until the day of Je&s;us Chri&s;t Phil. 1, 6.</P>

You have often heard them mar&s;halled as it were, under three great leaders, the fle&s;h, the world, and the devil; and according to this di&s;tribution, I would call you to con|&s;ider the forces of each, as &s;etting them&s;elves in array again&s;t you.

They who have once been your companions in &s;in will try a thou&s;and artful methods to allure you back again to their for&s;aken &s;ociety: &s;ome of them perhaps with an appearance of tender fondne&s;s; and many more by the almo&s;t irri&s;i&s;tible art of banter and ridicule; that boa&s;ted te&s;t of right and wrong, as it has been wantonly called, will be tried upon you, perhaps without any regard to decency, or even to common humanity.

At one time he will &s;tudy, by his vile &s;ugge&s;tions, to interrupt you in your duties, as if they gave him an additional power over you: at another time he will endeavour to weary you of your devotion, by influencing you to prolong it to an immoderate and tedious length, le&s;t his pow|er &s;hould be exerted upon you when it cea&s;es.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. The Chri&s;tian urged to, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in, an expre&s;s act of Self-dedication to the Service of God.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The advantages of &s;uch a &s;urrender are briefly &s;ugge&s;ted, &sect; <HI>1.</HI> Advices for the manner of doing it; that it may be deliberate, chearful, entire, and perpetual, &sect; <HI>2,&mdash;4;</HI> and that it be expre&s;&s;ed with &s;ome affecting &s;olemnity, &sect; <HI>5.</HI> A written in&s;trument to be &s;igned and declared before God at &s;ome &s;ea&s;on of extraordinary devotion, propo&s;ed, &sect; <HI>6, 7.</HI> The chapter concludes with a &s;peci|men of &s;uch an in&s;trument, together with an ab&s;tract of it, to be u&s;ed with proper and requi&s;ite alterations.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1"><PB N="151" REF="021060_0164_0FB20EF5607DDF00">&sect; 1. AS I would hope, that, notwith&s;tanding all the views of oppo&s;ition which do or may ari&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in con&s;ideration of tho&s;e noble &s;upports and motives which have been mentioned in the two preceding chapters, you are heartily determined for the &s;ervice of God, I would now urge you to make a &s;olemn &s;urrender of your&s;elf unto it. Do not only form &s;uch a purpo&s;e in your heart, but expre&s;sly declare it in the divine pre|&s;ence. Such &s;olemnity in the manner of doing it is cer|tainly very rea&s;onable in the nature of things; and &s;ure|ly it is highly expedient, for binding to the Lord &s;uch a treacherous heart, as we know our own to be. It will be plea&s;ant to reflect upon it, as done at &s;uch and &s;uch a time, with &s;uch and &s;uch circum&s;tances of place and method, which may &s;erve to &s;trike the memory and the con&s;cience. The &s;en&s;e of the vows of God which are upon you will &s;trengthen you in an hour of temptation; and the recollection may al&s;o encourage your humble boldne&s;s and freedom in applying to him, under the character and relation of <Q>your covenant God and Fa|ther,</Q> as future exigencies may require.</P>
<P N="2">&sect; 2. Do it therefore, but do it deliberately. Con&s;ider what it is you are to do: and con&s;ider how rea&s;onable it is that it &s;hould be done, and done cordially and chearfully; "and not by con&s;traint but willingly 1 Pet. 5, 2:" for, in this &s;en&s;e and in every other, "God loves a chearful giver 2 Cor. 9, 7." Now, &s;urely there is nothing we &s;hould do with greater chearful|ne&s;s, or more cordial con&s;ent, than making &s;uch a &s;urrender of our&s;elves to the Lord; to the God who created us, who brought us into this plea&s;ant and well furni&s;hed world, who &s;upported us in our ten|der infancy, who guarded us in the thoughtle&s;s days of childhood and youth, who has hitherto continually helped, &s;u&s;tained, and pre&s;erved us. Nothing can be more rea&s;onable than that we &s;hould acknowledge him as our rightful Owner and our &s;overeign Ruler; than that we &s;hould devote our&s;elves to him as our mo&s;t gracious Benefactor, and &s;eek him as our &s;upreme feli|city. Nothing can be more apparently equitable than that we, the product of his power, and the price of his Son's blood, &s;hould be his, and his forever. If you &s;ee
<PB N="152" REF="021060_0165_0FB20EF6D9C7F9C0">
the matter in its ju&s;t view, it will be the grief of yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;oul that you have ever alienated your&s;elf from the ble&s;|&s;ed God and his &s;ervice; &s;o far will you be from wi&s;hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to continue in that &s;tate of alienation another year, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> another day. You will rejoice to bring back to him his revolted creature; and as you have in times pa&s;t <Q>yielded your members, as in&s;truments of unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s unto &s;in, you will delight to yield your&s;elves unto God, as alive from the dead, and to employ your members as in&s;truments of righteou&s;ne&s;s unto God Rom. 2, 13.</Q></P>
<P N="3">&sect; 3. The &s;urrender will al&s;o be as entire as it is chear|ful and immediate. All you are, and all you have, and all you can do, your time, your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, your influ|ence over others, will be devoted to him, that for the future it may be employed entirely for him, and to his glory. You will de&s;ire to keep back nothing from him; but will &s;eriou&s;ly judge that you are then in the true&s;t and noble&s;t &s;en&s;e your own when you are mo&s;t entire|ly his. You are al&s;o, on this great occa&s;ion, to re&s;ign all that you have to the di&s;po&s;al of his wi&s;e and gracious Providence, not only owning his power, but con&s;enting to his undoubted right, to do what he plea&s;es with you, and all that he has given you; and declaring a hear|ty approbation of all that he has done, and of all that he may farther do.</P>
<P N="4">&sect; 4. Once more, let me remind you, that this &s;ur|render mu&s;t be perpetual. You mu&s;t give your&s;elf up to God in &s;uch a manner, as never more to pretend to be your own: for the rights of God are, like his na|ture, eternal and immutable: and with regard to his rational creatures, are <Q>the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to-day, and for ever.</Q></P>
<P N="5">&sect; 5. I would farther advi&s;e and urge, that this de|dication may be made with all po&s;&s;ible &s;olemnity. Do it in expre&s;s words. And perhaps it may be in many ca&s;es mo&s;t expedient, as many pious divines have re|commended, to do it in writing. Set your hand and &s;eal to it, That on &s;uch a day of &s;uch a month and year, and at &s;uch a place, on full con&s;ideration and &s;erious reflection, you came to this happy re&s;olution, <Q>that whatever others might do, you would &s;erve the Lord Jo&s;h. 24, 13.</Q></P>
<P N="6"><PB N="153" REF="021060_0166_0FB20EF899DE0648">&sect; 6. Such an in&s;trument you may, if you plea&s;e, draw up for your&s;elf; or if you rather chu&s;e to have it drawn up to your hand, you may find &s;omething of this nature below, in which you may ea&s;ily make &s;uch al|terations as &s;hall &s;uit your circum&s;tances, where there is any thing peculiar in them. But whatever you u&s;e, weigh it well, meditate attentively upon it, that you may <Q>not be ra&s;h with your mouth to utter any thing before God Eccl. 5, 2.</Q> And when you determine to execute this in&s;trument, let this tran&s;action be at|tended with &s;ome more than ordinary religious retire|ment. Make it, if you conveniently can, a day of &s;e|cret fa&s;ting and prayer; and when your heart is pre|pared with a becoming awe of the divine maje&s;ty, with an humble confidence in his goodne&s;s, and an earne&s;t de&s;ire of his favour, then pre&s;ent your&s;elf on your knees before God, and read it over deliberately and &s;olemn|ly; and when you have &s;igned it, lay it bye in &s;ome &s;ecure place, where you may review it whenever you plea&s;e; and make it a rule with your&s;elf to review it, if po&s;&s;ible, at certain &s;ea&s;ons of the year, that you may keep the remembrance of it.</P>
<P N="7">&sect; 7. At lea&s;t, take this cour&s;e 'till you &s;ee your way clear to the table of the Lord, where you are to renew the &s;ame covenant, and to &s;eal it with more affecting &s;olemnities. And God grant that you may be enabled to keep it, and, in the whole of your conver&s;ation, to walk according to it! May it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e an anchor to your &s;oul in every temptation, and a cordial to it in every afflic|tion!

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">&sect; 1. I HOPE this chapter will find you, by a mo&s;t expre&s;s con&s;ent, become one of God's covenant-people, &s;olemnly and cordially devoted to his &s;ervice; and it is my hearty prayer, that the covenant you have
<PB N="161" REF="021060_0174_0FB20F0AD509E8F8">
made on earth may be ratified in heaven. But for your farther in&s;truction and edification, give me leave to re|mind you, that our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath appointed a peculiar manner of expre&s;&s;ing our regard to him, and of &s;olemnly renewing his covenant with him, which, though it does not forbid any other proper way of do|ing it, mu&s;t by no means be &s;et a&s;ide or neglected for any human methods, how prudent and expedient &s;o|ever they may appear to us.</P>
<P N="2">&sect; 2. Our Lord has wi&s;ely ordained, that the advan|tages of &s;ociety &s;hould be brought into religion; and as, by his command, profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians a&s;&s;emble together for other acts of public wor&s;hip, &s;o he has been plea&s;ed to in&s;titute a &s;ocial ordinance, in which a whole a&s;&s;em|bly of them is to come to his table, and there to eat the &s;ame bread, and drink the &s;ame cup. And this they are to do as a token of their affectionate remembrance of his dying love, of their &s;olemn &s;urrender of them&s;elves to God, and of their &s;incere love to another, and to all their fellow Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P N="3">&sect; 3. That the&s;e are indeed the great ends of the Lord's &s;upper, I &s;hall not now &s;tay to argue at large.&mdash; You need only read what the Apo&s;tle St. Paul has writ|ten in the tenth and eleventh chapters of his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to the Corinthians, to convince you fully of this. He there expre&s;sly tells us, that our Lord commanded the bread to be eaten, and the wine to be drank in remem|brance of him 1 Cor. 11, 24.25. or as a commemora|tion or memorial of him: &s;o that, as often as we at|tend this in&s;titution, we &s;hew forth our Lord's death, which we are to do even until he come again Ver. 26. And it is particularly a&s;&s;erted, That the cup is the new Te&s;tament in his blood Ver. 25; that is, it is a &s;eal of that covenant which was ratified by his blood. Now, it is evident that, in con&s;equence of this, we are to ap|proach it with a view to that covenant, de&s;iring its ble&s;&s;ings, and re&s;olving by divine grace to comply with its demands. On the whole, therefore, as the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks, we have communion in the body and the blood of Chri&s;t Cor. 10, 16; and partaking of his table, and of his cup, we conver&s;e with Chri&s;t, and join our&s;elves to him as his people: as the Heathens had, in their i|dolatrous
<PB N="162" REF="021060_0175_0FB20F0BD7DD4890">
rites, communion with their deities, and joined them&s;elves to them; and the Jews by eating their &s;a|crifices, conver&s;ed with Jehovah, and joined them&s;elves to him. He farther reminds them, that though many, they were "one bread and one body, being all partakers of that one bread 1 Cor. 10, 17." and being <Q>all made to drink into one &s;pirit 1 Cor. 12, 13;</Q> that is, meet|ing together as if they were but one family, and join|ing in the commemoration of that one blood which was their common ran&s;om, and of the Lord Je&s;us their com|mon head. Now, it is evident, all the&s;e rea&s;onings are applicable to Chri&s;tians in &s;ucceeding ages. Permit me, therefore, by the authority of our divine Ma&s;ter, to pre&s;s upon you the ob&s;ervation of this precept.</P>
<P N="4">&sect; 4. And let me al&s;o urge it, from the apparent ten|dency which it has to promote your true&s;t advantage. You are &s;etting out in the Chri&s;tian life; and I have reminded you at large of the oppo&s;ition you mu&s;t expect to meet with in it. It is the love of Chri&s;t which mu&s;t animate you to break through all. What then can be more de&s;irable than to bear about with you a lively &s;en&s;e of it? and what can awaken that &s;en&s;e more than the contemplation of death as there repre&s;ented! Who can behold the bread broken, and the wine poured out, and not reflect how the body of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us was even torn in pieces by his &s;ufferings, and his &s;acred blood pou|red forth like water on the ground? Who can think of the heart-rending agonies of the Son of God, as the price of our redemption and &s;alvation, and not feel his &s;oul melted with tenderne&s;s, and inflamed with grateful affection? What an exalted view doth it give us of the ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel-covenant, when we con&s;ider it as "e&s;tabli&s;hed in the blood of God's only begotten Son?" and when we make our approach to God, as our hea|venly Father, and give up our&s;elves to his &s;ervice in this &s;olemn manner, what an awful tendency has it to fix the conviction, that <Q>we are not our own, being bought with &s;uch a price 1 Cor. 6, 19.20?</Q> What a tendency has it to guard us again&s;t every temptation to tho&s;e &s;ins which we have &s;o &s;olemnly renounced, and to engage our fidelity to him to whom we have <Q>bound our &s;oul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as with an oath?

<P N="5">&sect; 5. It is al&s;o the expre&s;s in&s;titution and command of our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, that the members of &s;uch &s;o|cieties &s;hould be tenderly &s;olicitous for the &s;piritual wel|fare of each other; and that, on the who&s;e, his churches may be kept pure and holy, that they &s;hould <Q>with|draw them&s;elves from every brother that walketh di&s;|orderly 2 The&s;&s;. 3, 6; that they &s;hould mark &s;uch as cau&s;e offences or &s;candals among&s;t them, contrary to the doctrine which they have learned, and avoid them Rom. 16, 17;</Q> that if any obey not the word of Chri&s;t by his apo&s;tles, they &s;hould have no fellow&s;hip or communion with &s;uch, that they may be a&s;hamed 2 The&s;&s;. 2, 14; that they &s;hould not eat with &s;uch as are notoriou&s;ly irregular in their behaviour; but, on the contrary, &s;hould put away from among them&s;elves &s;uch wicked per&s;ons 1 Cor. 5, 11.13. It is evident, there|fore, that the in&s;titution of &s;uch &s;ocieties is greatly for the honour of Chri&s;tianity, and for the advantage of its particular profe&s;&s;ors and con&s;equently, every con&s;i|deration of obedience to our common Lord, and of pru|dent regard to our own benefit, and that of our brethren, will require, that tho&s;e who love the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in &s;incerity &s;hould enter into them, and a&s;&s;emble among them in the&s;e their mo&s;t &s;olemn and peculiar acts of communion at his table.</P>

The great que&s;tion is that which relates to your being prepared for a worthy attendance: and, in con|junction with what hath been &s;aid before, I think that may be brought to a very &s;hort i&s;&s;ue. Have you, &s;o far a you know your own heart, been &s;incere in that deliberate &s;urrender of your&s;elf to God through Chri&s;t, which I recommend in the former chapter? If you have, (whether it were with or without the particular form or manner of doing it there recommended,) you have certainly taken hold of the covenant, and therefore have a right to the &s;eal of it. And there is not, and cannot be, any other view of the ordinance in which you can have any farther objection to it. If you de&s;ire to remember Chri&s;t's death, if you de&s;ire to renew the dedication of your&s;elf to God through him, if you would li&s;t your&s;elf among his people, if you would love them, and do them good according to your ability; and, on the whole, would not allow your&s;elf in the practice of any one known &s;in, or in the omi&s;&s;ion of any one known duty, then I will venture confidently to &s;ay, not only that you will be welcome to the ordinance, but that it was in&s;tituted for &s;uch as you.</P>
<P N="7">&sect; 7. As for other objections, a few words may &s;uffice, by way of reply.

This may, by the divine ble&s;&s;ing, be an effectual remedy again&s;t the evil you fear; and, it is certain, that after what you mu&s;t already have known and felt before you could be brought into your pre&s;ent &s;ituation, (on the &s;uppo&s;itions I have now been making,) there can be no room to think of a retreat; no room, even for the wretched hope of be|ing le&s;s mi&s;erable than the generality of tho&s;e that have peri&s;hed. Your &s;cheme, therefore, mu&s;t be to make your &s;alvation as &s;ure, and to make it as glorious as po&s;&s;ible: and I know not any appointment of our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer which may have a more comfortable a&s;pect upon that ble&s;&s;ed end than this which I am now re|commending to you.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE you de&s;ire my thoughts in writing, and at large on the &s;ubject of our late conver&s;ation, <HI>viz.</HI> "By what particular methods, in our daily conduct, a life of devo|tion and u&s;efulne&s;s may be mo&s;t happily maintained and

&s;ecured?" I &s;et my&s;elf with chearfulne&s;s to recollect and dige&s;t the hints which I then gave you, hoping it may be of &s;ome &s;ervice to you in your mo&s;t important intere&s;ts, and may al&s;o fix on my own mind a deeper &s;en&s;e of my obligations to govern my own life by the rules I offer to others. I e&s;teem attempts of this kind among the plea|&s;ante&s;t fruits, and the &s;ure&s;t cements of friend&s;hip; and, as I hope ours will la&s;t for ever, I am per&s;uaded a mu|tual care to cheri&s;h &s;entiments of this kind will add e|verla&s;ting endearments to it.</P>
<P N="2">&sect; 2. The directions you will expect from me on this occa&s;ion naturally divide them&s;elves into three heads.&mdash; How we are to regard God&mdash;in the beginning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">he progre&s;s&mdash;and the clo&s;e of the day. I will ope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> heart freely to you with regard to each, and will leave, you to judge how far the&s;e hints may &s;uit your circum|&s;tances; aiming at lea&s;t to keep between the extremes of a &s;uper&s;titious &s;trictne&s;s in trifles, and of an indolent remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, which, if admitted in little things, may draw after it criminal neglects, and at length yet more criminal indulgencies.</P>
<P N="3">&sect; 3. [I.] In the beginning of the day, it &s;hould cer|tainly be our care,&mdash;to lift up our hearts to God as &s;oon as we awake, and while we are ri&s;ing,&mdash;and then, to &s;et our&s;elves &s;eriou&s;ly and immediately to the &s;ecret de|votions of the morning.</P>
<P N="4">&sect; 4. For the fir&s;t of the&s;e, it &s;eems exceedingly na|tural. There are &s;o many things that may &s;ugge&s;t a great variety of pious reflections and ejaculations, which are &s;o obvious, that one would think a &s;erious mind could hardly mi&s;s them. The ea&s;e and chearfulne&s;s of our mind at our fir&s;t awakening; the refre&s;hment we find from &s;leep; the &s;ecurity we have enjoyed in that de|fencele&s;s &s;tate; the provi&s;ion of warm and decent ap|parel; the chearful light of the returning &s;un; or (what is not unfit to mention to you,) the contrivances of Art, taught and furni&s;hed by the great author of all our con|veniencies, to &s;upply us with many u&s;eful hours of life in the ab&s;ence of the &s;un; the hope of returning to the dear &s;ociety of our friends; the pro&s;pect of &s;pending a|nother day in the &s;ervice of God, and the improvement
<PB N="171" REF="021060_0184_0FB20F21B59ABF70">
of our own minds; and, above all, the lively hope of a joyful re&s;urrection to an eternal day of happine&s;s and glory. Any of the&s;e particulars, and many more, which I do not mention, may furni&s;h us with matter of plea|&s;ing reflection, and chearful prai&s;e, while we are ri&s;ing. And, for our farther a&s;&s;i&s;tance, when we are alone at this time, it may not be improper to &s;peak &s;ometimes to our&s;elves, and &s;ometimes to our heavenly Father, in the natural expre&s;&s;ions of joy and thankfulne&s;s. Permit me, Sir, to add, that if we find our hearts in &s;uch a frame at our fir&s;t awakening, even that is ju&s;t matter of prai&s;e, and the rather, as perhaps it is an an&s;wer to the prayer with which we lay down.</P>
<P N="5">&sect; 5. For the exerci&s;e of &s;ecret devotion in a morn|ing, which I hope will generally be our fir&s;t work, I cannot pre&s;cribe an exact method to another. You mu&s;t, my dear friend, con&s;ult your own ta&s;te in &s;ome mea&s;ure. The con&s;tituent parts of the &s;ervice are, in the general, plain. Were I to propo&s;e a particular model for tho&s;e, who have half, or three quarters of an hour at com|mand, (which, with prudent conduct, I &s;uppo&s;e mo&s;t may have) it &s;hould be this:</P>
<P N="6">&sect; 6. To begin the &s;tated devotions of the day with a &s;olemn act of prai&s;e, offered to God on our knees, and generally with a low, yet di&s;tinct voice; acknowledging the mercies we had been reflecting on while ri&s;ing; never forgetting to mention Chri&s;t, as the great foun|dation of all our enjoyments and our hopes, or to re|turn thanks for the influences of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, which have led our hearts to God, or are then engaging us to &s;eek him. This, as well as other offices of devotion af|terwards mentioned, mu&s;t be done attentively and &s;in|cerely; for, not to offer our prai&s;es heartily, is in the &s;ight of God, not to prai&s;e him at all. This addre&s;s of prai&s;e may properly be concluded with an expre&s;s re|newal of our covenant with God, declaring our continued repeated re&s;olution of being devoted to him, and parti|cularly of living to his glory the en&s;uing day.</P>
<P N="7">&sect; 7. It may be proper, after this, to take a pro&s;pect of the day before us, &s;o far as we can probably fore&s;ee, in the general, where and how it may be &s;pent; and &s;e|riou&s;ly to reflect, "How &s;hall I employ my&s;elf for God
<PB N="172" REF="021060_0185_0FB20F2318733F30">
this day? What bu&s;ine&s;s is to be done, and in what or|der? What opportunities may I expect, either of doing or of receiving good? What temptations am I like to be a&s;&s;aulted with, in any place, company, or circum|&s;tance, which may probably occur? In what in&s;tances have I lately failed? and how &s;hall I be &s;afe&s;t now?"</P>
<P N="8">&sect; 8. After this review, it will be proper to offer up a &s;hort prayer, begging, that God would quicken us to each of the&s;e fore&s;een duties; that he would fortify us again&s;t each of the&s;e apprehended dangers; that he would grant us &s;ucce&s;s in &s;uch or &s;uch a bu&s;ine&s;s under|taken for his glory; and al&s;o that he would help us to di&s;cover and improve unfore&s;een opportunities, to re&s;i&s;t unexpected temptations, and to bear patiently and re|ligiou&s;ly any afflictions which may &s;urpri&s;e us in the day on which we are entering.</P>
<P N="9">&sect; 9. I would advi&s;e you after this to read &s;ome por|tion of &s;cripture; not a great deal, nor the whole Bible in its cour&s;e; but &s;ome &s;elect le&s;&s;ons out of its mo&s;t u&s;e|ful parts; perhaps ten or twelve ver&s;es; nor troubling your&s;elf much about the exact connexion, or other cri|tical niceties which may occur, (though at other times I would recommend them to your inquiry, as you have ability and opportunity;) but con&s;idering them merely in a devotional and a practical view. Here take &s;uch in&s;tructions as readily pre&s;ent them&s;elves to your thoughts, repeat them over to your own con&s;cience, and charge your heart religiou&s;ly to ob&s;erve them, and act upon them under a &s;en&s;e of the divine authority which attends them. And if you pray over the &s;ub&s;tance of this Scrip|ture, with your Bible open before you, it may impre&s;s your memory and your heart yet more deeply, and may form you to a copiou&s;ne&s;s and variety both of thought and expre&s;&s;ion in prayer.</P>
<P N="10">&sect; 10. It might be proper to clo&s;e the&s;e devotions with a p&s;alm or hymn; and I rejoice with you, that through the pious care of Dr. WATTS, and &s;ome other &s;acred poets, we are provided with &s;o rich a variety for the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of the clo&s;et and family on the&s;e occa&s;ions, as well as for the &s;ervice of the &s;anctuary.</P>
<P N="11">&sect; 11. [II.] The mo&s;t material directions which have
<PB N="173" REF="021060_0186_0FB20F2562D246B0">
occurred to me, relating to the progre&s;s of the day, are the&s;e:&mdash;That we be &s;erious in the devotions of the day:&mdash;that we delight in the bu&s;ine&s;s of it, that is, in the pro&s;ecution of our worldly callings:&mdash;that we be temperate and prudent in the recreations of it:&mdash;that we carefully mark the providences of the day:&mdash;that we cautiou&s;ly guard again&s;t the temptations of it:&mdash; that we keep up a lively and humble dependence upon the divine influence, &s;uitable to every emergency of it: &mdash;that we govern our thoughts well in the &s;olitude of the day,&mdash;and our di&s;cour&s;es well in the conver&s;ations of it. The&s;e, Sir, were the heads of a &s;ermon which you lately heard me preach on this occa&s;ion, and to which I know you referred in that reque&s;t which I am now en|deavouring to an&s;wer. I will, therefore, touch upon the mo&s;t material hints which fell under each of the&s;e particulars.</P>
<P N="12">&sect; 12. (1.) For &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s in devotion, whether pub|lic or dome&s;tic: Let us take a few moments, before we enter upon &s;uch &s;olemnities, to pau&s;e, and reflect, on the perfections of the God we are addre&s;&s;ing to, on the im|portance of the bu&s;ine&s;s we are coming about, on the plea&s;ure and advantage of a regular and devout attend|ance, and on the guilt and &s;olly of an hypocritical for|mality. When engaged, let us maintain a &s;trict watch|fulne&s;s over our own &s;pirits, and check the fir&s;t wanderings of thought, And when the duty is over, let us imme|diately reflect on the manner in which, it has been per|formed, and a&s;k our con&s;ciences whether we have rea&s;on to conclude that we are accepted of God in it? For there is a certain manner of going through the&s;e offices, which our own hearts will immediately tell us it is impo&s;&s;ible for God to approve: and if we have inadvertently fallen into it, we ought to be deeply humbled before God for it, le&s;t "our very prayer become &s;in, P&s;. 109, 7.</P>
<P N="13">&sect; 13. (2,) As for the hours of worldly bu&s;ine&s;s; whe|ther it be, as with you, that of the hands; or whether it be the labour of a learned life, not immediately re|lating to religious matters: Let us &s;et to the pro&s;ecution of it with a &s;en&s;e of God's authority, and with a regard to his glory. Let us avoid a dreaming, &s;luggi&s;h, indolent temper, which nods over its work, and does only the
<PB N="174" REF="021060_0187_0FB20F27135595C0">
bu&s;ine&s;s of one hour in two or three. In oppo&s;ition to this, which runs through the life of &s;ome people, who yet think they are never idle, let us endeavour to di&s;|patch as much as we well can in a little time; con&s;ider|ing that it is but a little we have in all. And let us be habitually &s;en&s;ible of the need we have of the divine ble&s;&s;ing to make our labour &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P N="14">&sect; 14. (3.) For &s;ea&s;ons of diver&s;ion: Let us take care that our recreations be well clo&s;en; that they be pur|&s;ued with a good intention, to fit us for a renewed ap|plication to the labours of life; and thus that they be only u&s;ed in &s;ubordination to the honor of God, the great end of all our actions. Let us take heed that our hearts be not e&s;tranged from God by them; and that they do not take up too much of our time; always remembering that the faculties of the human nature, and the advanta|ges of the Chri&s;tian revelation, were not given us in vain; but that we are always to be in pur&s;uit of &s;ome great and honorable end, and to indulge our&s;elves in a|mu&s;ements and diver&s;ions no farther than as they make a part in a &s;cheme of rational and manly, benevolent and pious conduct.</P>
<P N="15">&sect; 15. (4.) For the ob&s;ervation of providences: It will be u&s;eful to regard the divine interpo&s;ition in our comforts and in our afflictions. In our comforts, whe|ther more common or extraordinary: That we find our|&s;elves in continued health; that we are furni&s;hed with food for our &s;upport and plea&s;ure; that we have &s;o many agreeable ways of employing our time; that we have &s;o many agreeable friends, and tho&s;e &s;o good and &s;o hap|py; that our bu&s;ine&s;s goes on pro&s;perou&s;ly; that we go out and come in &s;afely; and that we enjoy compo&s;ure and chearfulne&s;s of &s;pirit, without which nothing el&s;e could be enjoyed. All the&s;e &s;hould be regarded as pro|vidential favours, and due acknowledgments &s;hould be made to God on the&s;e accounts, as we pa&s;s through &s;uch agreeable &s;cenes. On the other hand, Providence is to be regarded in every di&s;appointment, in every lo&s;s, in every pain, in every in&s;tance of unkindne&s;s from tho&s;e who have profe&s;&s;ed friend&s;hip: and we &s;hould endea|vour to argue our&s;elves into a patient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, from this con&s;ideration, that the hand of God is always medi|ately,
<PB N="175" REF="021060_0188_0FB20F2A59872FD0">
if not immediately, in each of them; and that if they are not properly the work of Providence, they are at lea&s;t under its direction. It is a reflection, which we &s;hould particularly make with relation to tho&s;e little cro&s;s accidents, (as we are ready to call them) and tho&s;e in|firmities and follies in the temper and conduct of our intimate friends, which may el&s;e be ready to di&s;compo&s;e us. And it is the more nece&s;&s;ary to guard our minds here, as wi&s;e and good men often lo&s;e the command of them&s;elves on the&s;e comparatively little occa&s;ions; who calling up rea&s;on and religion to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;tand the &s;hock of great calamities with fortitude and re&s;o|lution.</P>
<P N="16">&sect;. 16. (5.) For watchfulne&s;s again&s;t temptations; It is nece&s;&s;ary, when changing our pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> or our employ|ment, to reflect, "what &s;nares attend me here?" And as this &s;hould be our habitual care, &s;o we &s;hould e&s;pecially guard again&s;t tho&s;e &s;nares which in the morning we fore&s;aw. And when we are entering on tho&s;e circum|&s;tances in which we expected the a&s;&s;ault, we &s;hould re|flect, e&s;pecially if it be a matter of great importance, "Now the combat is going to begin: now God and the ble&s;&s;ed angels are ob&s;erving what con&s;tancy, what for|titude, there is in my &s;oul; and how far the divine autho|rity, and the remembrance of my own prayers and re|&s;olutions will weigh with me when it comes to the trial."</P>
<P N="17">&sect; 17. (6.) As for dependance on divine grace and in|fluence: It mu&s;t be univer&s;al; and &s;ince we always need it, we mu&s;t never forget that nece&s;&s;ity. A mo|ment &s;pent in humble &s;ervent breathings after the com|munications of the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance may do more good than many minutes &s;pent in more rea&s;onings: and though indeed this &s;hould not be neglected, &s;ince the light of rea&s;on is a kind of divine illumination, yet &s;till it ought to be pur&s;ued in a due &s;en&s;e of our dependance on the father of lights, or where we <Q>think our&s;elves wi&s;e&s;t, we may become vain in our imaginations Rom. 1, 21.22.</Q> Let us therefore always call upon God; and &s;ay for in&s;tance, when we are going to pray, <Q>Lord fix my attention! Awaken my holy affections, and pour out upon me the &s;pirit of grace and of &s;up|plication

<P N="18">&sect; 18. (7.) For the government of our thoughts in &s;o|litude: Let us accu&s;tom our&s;elves, on all occa&s;ions, to exerci&s;e a due command over our thoughts. Let us take care of tho&s;e entanglements of pa&s;&s;ion, and tho&s;e attach|ments to any pre&s;ent intere&s;t in view, which would de|prive us of our power over them. Let us &s;et before us &s;ome profitable &s;ubject of thought; &s;uch as, the perfec|tions of the ble&s;&s;ed God, the love of Chri&s;t, the value of time, the certainty and importance of death and judg|ment, and of the eternity of happine&s;s or mi&s;ery which is to follow. Let us al&s;o at &s;uch intervals reflect on what we have ob&s;erved, as to the &s;tate of our own &s;ouls, with regard to the advance or decline of religion; or on the la&s;t &s;ermon we have heard, or the la&s;t portion of Scripture we have read. You may, perhaps, in this connection. Sir&punc; recollect what I have (if I remember right,) propo&s;ed to you in conver&s;ation; that it may
<PB N="177" REF="021060_0190_0FB20F2D981F2BC0">
be very u&s;eful to &s;elect &s;ome one ver&s;e of Scripture, which we had met with in the morning, and to trea&s;ure it up in our mind, re&s;olving to think of that at any time when we are at a lo&s;s for matter of pious reflection, in any intervals of lei&s;ure for entering upon it. This will often be as a &s;pring, from whence many profitable and delightful thoughts may ari&s;e, which perhaps we did not before &s;ee in that connection and force. Or, if it &s;hould not be &s;o, yet I am per&s;uaded it will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> better to repeat the &s;ame Scripture in our mind an hun|dred times in a day, with &s;ome pious ejaculations form|ed upon it, than to leave our thoughts at the mercy of all tho&s;e various trifles which may otherwi&s;e in|trude upon us, the variety of which will be far from making amends for their vanity.</P>
<P N="19">&sect; 19. (8.) La&s;tly for the government of our di&s;|cour&s;e in company: We &s;hould take care that nothing may e&s;cape us which can expo&s;e us, or our Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, to cen&s;ure and reproach: nothing injurious to tho&s;e that are ab&s;ent, or to tho&s;e that are pre&s;ent; noth|ing malignant, nothing in&s;incere, nothing which may corrupt, nothing which may provoke, nothing which may mi&s;lead tho&s;e about us. Nor &s;hould we by any means be content that what we &s;ay is innocent: it &s;hould be our de&s;ire that it may be edifying to our&s;elves and o|thers. In this view we &s;hould endeavour to have &s;ome &s;ubject of u&s;eful di&s;cour&s;e always ready, in which you may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the&s;e hints given about furniture for thought under the former head. We &s;hould watch for decent opportunities of introducing u&s;eful reflections; and if a pious friend attempt to do it, we &s;hould endea|vour to &s;econd it immediately. When the conver&s;ati|on does not turn directly on religious &s;ubjects, we &s;hould endeavour to make it improving &s;ome other way; we &s;hould reflect on the character and capacities of our com|pany, that we may lead them to talk of what they un|der&s;tand be&s;t; for their di&s;cour&s;es on tho&s;e &s;ubjects will probably be mo&s;t plea&s;ing to them&s;elves, as well as mo&s;t u&s;eful to us. And, in pau&s;es of di&s;cour&s;e, it may not be improper to lift up an holy ejaculation to God, that his grace may a&s;&s;i&s;t us and our friends in our endeavours to do good to each other; that all we &s;ay and do may

I &s;hould; Sir, advi&s;e to read a portion of Scrip|ture in the fir&s;t place, with &s;uitable reflections and pray|er, as above: then to read a hymn or p&s;alm: after this to enter on &s;elf-examination, to be followed by a longer prayer than that which followed reading, to be formed on this review of the day. In this addre&s;s to the throne of grace it will be highly proper to intreat that God would pardon the omi&s;&s;ions and offences of the day; to prai&s;e him for mercies temporal and &s;piritual; to recom|mend our&s;elves to his protection for the en&s;uing night; with proper petitions for others, whom we ought to bear on our hearts before him; and particularly for the&s;e friends with whom we have conver&s;ed or corre&s;ponded with in the preceding day. Many other concerns will occur, both in morning and evening prayer, which I have not here hinted at; but I did not apprehend that a full enumeration of the&s;e things belonged, by any means, to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="22">&sect; 22. Before I quit this head, I mu&s;t take the liberty to remind you, that &s;elf-examination is &s;o important a duty that it will be worth our while to &s;pend a few words upon it. And this branch of it is &s;o ea&s;y, that when we have proper que&s;tions before us, any per&s;on of a common under&s;tanding may hope to go through it with advantage under a divine ble&s;&s;ing. I offer you, therefore, the following queries, which I hope you will with &s;uch alterations as you may judge requi&s;ite, keep near you for daily u&s;e. "Did I awake, as with God this morning, and ri&s;e with a grateful &s;en&s;e of his good|ne&s;s? How were the &s;ecret devotions of the morning performed? Did I offer my &s;olemn prai&s;es, and renew the dedication of my&s;elf to God, with becoming atten|tion
<PB N="179" REF="021060_0192_0FB20F32FA9F9568">
and &s;uitable affections? Did I lay my &s;cheme for the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day wi&s;ely and well? How did I read the Scripture, and any other devotional or practi|cal piece, which I might afterwards conveniently re|view? Did it do my heart good, or was it a mere amu&s;e|ment? How hath the other &s;tated devotions of the day been attended, whether in the family or in public? Have I pur&s;ued the common bu&s;ine&s;s of this day with diligence and &s;pirituality; doing every thing in &s;ea&s;on, and with all convenient di&s;patch, and "as unto the Lord Col. 2, 23?" What time have I lo&s;t this day, in the morning or the forenoon, in the afternoon or the evening; (for the&s;e divi&s;ions will a&s;&s;i&s;t your recollection;) and what has occa&s;ioned the lo&s;s of it? With what temper, and under what regulations have the recreations of this day been pur&s;ued? Have I &s;een the hand of God in my mercies, health, chearfulne&s;s, food, clothing, books, pre&s;ervation in journies, &s;ucce&s;s of bu&s;ine&s;s, conver&s;ation and kindne&s;s of friends, &amp;c.?&mdash;Have I &s;een it in af|flictions, and particularly in little things which had a tendency to vex and di&s;quiet me? And with regard to this interpo&s;ition, have I received my comforts thank|fully, and my afflictions &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively? How have I guarded again&s;t the temptations of the day, particularly again&s;t this or that temptation which I fore&s;aw in the morning? Have I maintained an humble dependence on divine influences? Have I <Q>lived by faith on the Son of God Gal. 2, 20,</Q> and regarded Chri&s;t this day as my Teacher and Governor, my Atonement and Interce&s;&s;or, my Example and Guardian, my Strength and Forerunner? Have I been looking forward to death and eternity this day, and con&s;idered my&s;elf as a proba|tioner for heaven, and through grace an expectant of it? Have I governed my thoughts well, e&s;pecially in &s;uch or &s;uch an interval of &s;olitude? How was my &s;ubject of thought this day cho&s;en, and how was it regarded? Have I governed my di&s;cour&s;es well in &s;uch and &s;uch company? Did I &s;ay nothing pa&s;&s;ionate, mi&s;chievous, &s;landerous, imprudent, impertinent? Has my heart this day been full of love to God, and to all mankind? and have I &s;ought, and found, and improved opportunities of doing and of getting good?&mdash;With what attention

and improvement have I read the Scripture this even|ing? How was &s;elf-examination performed the la&s;t night? and how have I profited this day by any remarks I then made on former negligencies and mi&s;takes? With what temper did I then lye down and compo&s;e my|&s;elf to &s;leep?"</P>
<P N="23">&sect; 23. You will ea&s;ily &s;ee, Sir, that the&s;e que&s;tions are &s;o adju&s;ted as to be an abridgment of the mo&s;t material advices I have given in this letter; and I believe I need not, to a per&s;on of your under&s;tanding, &s;ay any thing as to the u&s;efulne&s;s of &s;uch inquiries. Con&s;cience will an|&s;wer them in a few minutes; but if you think them too large and particular, you may make a &s;till &s;horter ab|&s;tract for daily u&s;e, and re&s;erve the&s;e, with &s;uch obvious alterations as will then be nece&s;&s;ary, for &s;ea&s;ons of more than ordinary exactne&s;s in review, which I hope will occur at lea&s;t once a week. Secret devotion being thus performed before drow&s;ine&s;s render us unfit for it, the interval between that and our going to re&s;t mu&s;t be con|ducted by the rules mentioned under the next head.

Now, here it is obviou&s;ly &s;uitable to think of the divine goodne&s;s in add|ing another day, and the mercies of it, to the former days and mercies of our life: to take notice of the in|dulgence of Providence in giving us commodious habi|tations and ea&s;y beds, and continuing to us &s;uch health of body that we can lay our&s;elves down at ea&s;e upon them and &s;uch &s;erenity of mind as leaves us any room to hope for refre&s;hing &s;leep: a refre&s;hment to be &s;ought not merely as an indulgence to animal nature, but as what our wi&s;e Creator, in order to keep us humble in the mid&s;t of &s;o many infirmities, has been plea&s;ed to make nece&s;&s;ary to our being able to pur&s;ue his &s;ervice with re|newed alacrity. Thus may our &s;leeping, as well as our walking, hours be, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, devoted to God. And when we are ju&s;t going to re&s;ign our&s;elves to the image of death, (to what one of the Ancients beautifully calls <HI>its le&s;&s;er my&s;teries,</HI>) it is al&s;o evidently proper to think &s;eriou&s;ly of that end of all the living, and to renew tho&s;e

You have once, Sir, &s;een a meditation of that kind in my hand: I will tran&s;cribe it for you in the po&s;t&s;cript; and there|fore &s;hall add no more to this head, but here put a clo&s;e to the directions you de&s;ired.</P>

This, reader, with the alteration of a very few words, is the letter I wrote to a worthy friend, (now, I doubt not, with God,) about &s;ixteen years ago: and I can a&s;&s;uredly &s;ay, that the experience of each of the&s;e years has confirmed me in the&s;e views, and e&s;tabli&s;hed me in the per&s;ua&s;ion, that one day thus &s;pent is prefer|able to whole years of &s;en&s;uality and the neglect of re|ligion.

of thy latter end Deut. 32, 29.</Q> Another of thy mortal days is now numbered and fini&s;hed: and as I have put off my clothes, and laid my&s;elf upon my bed for the repo&s;e of the night, &s;o will the day of his quickly come to its period; &s;o mu&s;t the body it&s;elf he put off, and laid to its repo&s;e in a bed of du&s;t.

<P>But if the great account be already adju&s;ted, if thou ha&s;t cordially repented of thy numerous offences, if thou ha&s;t &s;incerely committed thy&s;elf by faith into the hands of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, and ha&s;t not renounced thy co|venant with him by returning to the allowed practice of &s;in, then &s;tart not at the thoughts of a &s;eparation; it is not in the power of Death to hurt a &s;oul devoted to God, and united to the great Redeemer.

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">&sect; 1. I HAVE been a&s;&s;igning in the preceding chapter, what I fear will &s;eem to &s;ome of my readers &s;o hard a ta&s;k, that they will want courage to attempt it; and it is indeed a life, in many re&s;pects, &s;o far above that of the generality of Chri&s;tians, that I am not with|out apprehen&s;ions that many who de&s;erve the name may think the directions, after all the precautions with which I have propo&s;ed them, are carried to an unnece&s;&s;ary de|gree of nicety and &s;trictne&s;s. But I am per&s;uaded much

of the credit and comfort of Chri&s;tianity is lo&s;t in con&s;e|quence of its profe&s;&s;ors fixing their aims too low, and not conceiving of their high and holy calling in &s;o ele|vated and &s;ublime a view as the nature of religion would require, and the word of God would direct. I am fully convinced, that the expre&s;&s;ions of <Q>walking with God; of being in the fear of the Lord all the day long Prov. 23, 17.</Q> and, above all, that of <Q>loving the Lord our God with all our heart and &s;oul, and mind and &s;trength Mark. 12, 30.</Q> mu&s;t require, if not all the&s;e circum&s;tances, yet the &s;ub&s;tance of all that I have been recommending, &s;o far as we have capacity, lei&s;ure and opportunity; and I cannot but think, that many might command more of the latter, and perhaps improve their capacities too, if they would take a due care in the im|provement of them&s;elves, if they would give up vain and unnece&s;&s;ary diver&s;ions, and certain indulgencies, which only &s;uit and delight the lower part of our nature, and (to &s;ay the be&s;t of them) deprive us of plea&s;ures much better than them&s;elves, if they do not plunge us into guilt. Many of the&s;e rules would appear ea&s;ily practicable, if men would learn to know the value of time, and particularly to redeem it from unnece&s;&s;ary &s;leep, which wa&s;tes &s;o many golden hours of the day: hours in which many of God's &s;ervants are delighting them&s;elves in him, and drinking in full draughts of the water of life, while the&s;e their brethren are &s;lumbering upon their beds, and lo&s;t in vain dreams, as far below the common entertainments of a rational creature as the plea&s;ures of the &s;ublime&s;t devotion are above them.</P>
<P N="2">&sect; 2. I know, likewi&s;e, that the mind is very fickle and incon&s;tant, and that it is a hard thing to pre&s;erve &s;uch a government and authority over our thoughts as would be very de&s;irable, and as the plan I have laid down will require. But &s;o much of the honour of God, and &s;o much of your own true happine&s;s depends upon it, that I beg you will give me a patient and attentive hearing while I am pleading with you; and that you will &s;eri|ou&s;ly examine the arguments, and then judge whether a care and conduct like that which I have advi&s;ed be not in it&s;elf rea&s;onable; and whether it will not be highly conducive to your comfort and u&s;efulne&s;s in life, your

peace in death, and the advancement and increa&s;e of your eternal glory.</P>
<P N="3">&sect; 3. Let con&s;cience &s;ay, whether &s;uch a life, as I have de&s;cribed above, be not in it&s;elf highly rea&s;onable. Look over the &s;ub&s;tance of it again, and bring it under a clo&s;e examination; for I am very apprehen&s;ive that &s;ome weak objections may ari&s;e again&s;t the whole, which may, in their con&s;equences, affect particulars, again&s;t which no rea&s;onable man would pre&s;ume to mark any objection at all. Recollect, O Chri&s;tian, and carry it with you in your memory and your heart, while you are pur&s;uing his review, that you are the creature of God, that you are purcha&s;ed with the blood of Je&s;us; and then &s;ay whether the&s;e relations in which you &s;tand do not de|mand all that application and re&s;olution which I would engage you to. Suppo&s;e all the coun&s;els I have given reduced into practice: &s;uppo&s;e every day begun and concluded with &s;uch devout breathings after God, and &s;uch holy retirements for morning and evening conver&s;e with him and your own heart: &s;uppo&s;e a daily care in contriving how your time may be managed, and in re|flecting how it has been employed: &s;uppo&s;e this regard to God, this &s;en&s;e of his pre&s;ence, and zeal for his glory to run through your acts of wor&s;hip, your hours of bu|&s;ine&s;s and recreation: &s;uppo&s;e this attention to Provi|dence, this guard again&s;t temptations, this dependence upon divine influence, this government of the thoughts in &s;olitude and of the di&s;cour&s;es in company: nay, I will add farther, &s;uppo&s;e every particular direction giv|en to be pur&s;ued, excepting when particular ca&s;es oc|cur, with re&s;pect to which you &s;hall be able in con&s;ci|ence to &s;ay, <Q>I wave it not from indolence and carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, but becau&s;e I think it will ju&s;t now be more plea&s;ing to God to be doing &s;omething el&s;e;</Q> which may of|ten happen in human life where general rules are be&s;t concerted: &s;uppo&s;e, I &s;ay, all this to be done, not for a day, or a week, but through the remainder of life, whether longer or &s;horter; and &s;uppo&s;e this to be re|viewed at the clo&s;e of life, in the full exerci&s;e of your rational faculties, will there be rea&s;on to &s;ay, in the re|flection, "I have taken too much pains in religion; the Author of my being did not de&s;erve all this from me:
<PB N="186" REF="021060_0199_0FB20D8ED9DACE10">
le&s;s diligence, le&s;s fidelity, le&s;s zeal, than this might have been equivalent for the blood which was &s;hed for my re|demption. A part of my heart, a part of my time, a part of my labours, might have &s;ufficed for him who hath given me all my powers; for him, who hath deli|vered me from that de&s;truction, which would have made them my everla&s;ting torment; for him who is rai&s;ing me to the regions of a bli&s;sful immortality." Can you with any face &s;ay this? If you cannot, then &s;urely your con&s;cience bears witne&s;s, that all I have recommended under the limitations above is rea&s;onable; that duty and gratitude require it; and con&s;equently that, by e|very allowed failure in it, you bring guilt upon your own &s;oul, you offend God, and act unworthy your Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="4">&sect; 4. I intreat you farther to con&s;ider whether &s;uch a conduct as I have now been recommending would not conduce much to your comfort and u&s;efulne&s;s in life. Reflect &s;eriou&s;ly what is true happine&s;s Does it con&s;i&s;t in di&s;tance from God, or in nearne&s;s to him! Surely you cannot be a Chri&s;tian, &s;urely you cannot be a ration|al man, if you doubt whether communion with the great Father of our &s;pirits be a plea&s;ure and felicity: and if it be, then &s;urely they enjoy mo&s;t of it who keep him mo&s;t con&s;tantly in view. You cannot but know in your own con&s;cience, that it is this which makes the happine&s;s of heaven; and therefore the more of it any man enjoys upon earth, the more of heaven comes down into his &s;oul. If you have made any trial of religion, though it be but a few months or weeks &s;ince you fir&s;t became acquainted with it, you mu&s;t be &s;ome judge of it upon your own experience, which have been the mo&s;t plea&s;ant days of your life. Have they not been tho&s;e in which you have acted mo&s;t upon the&s;e principles; tho&s;e, in which you have mo&s;t &s;teadily and re&s;olutely carried them through every hour of time, and every circum&s;tance of life? The check which you mu&s;t, in many in&s;tances, give to your own inclinations might &s;eem di&s;agreeable; but it would &s;urely be overbalanced in a mo&s;t happy manner by the &s;atisfaction you would find in a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;elf-government; in having &s;uch a command of your thoughts, affections and ac|tions,
<PB N="187" REF="021060_0200_0FB20D905F6CCCC0">
as is much more glorious than any authority over others can be.</P>
<P N="5">&sect; 5. I would al&s;o intreat you to con&s;ider the influence which &s;uch a conduct as this might have upon the hap|pine&s;s of others. And it is ea&s;y to be &s;een it mu&s;t be very great; as you would find your heart always di&s;|po&s;ed to watch every opportunity of doing good, and to &s;eize it with eagerne&s;s and delight. It would engage you to make it the &s;tudy and bu&s;ine&s;s of your life to or|der things in &s;uch a manner that the end of one kind and u&s;eful action might be the beginning of another; in which you would go on as naturally as the inferior animals do in tho&s;e productions and actions by which mankind are relieved or enriched; or as the earth bears her &s;ucce&s;&s;ive crops of different vegetable &s;upplies. And though mankind be, in this corrupt &s;tate, &s;o unhappily inclined to imitate evil examples rather than good; yet it may be expected, that while your light &s;hines before men &s;ome &s;eeing your good works, will endeavour to tran&s;cribe them in their own lives, and &s;o to <Q>glorify your Father which is in heaven Matth 5, 1.</Q> The charms of &s;uch beautiful models would &s;urely impre&s;s &s;ome, and incline them at lea&s;t to attempt an imitation; and every attempt would di&s;po&s;e to another. And thus, through the divine goodne&s;s, you might be entitled to a &s;hare in the prai&s;e, and the reward, not only of the good you had immediately done your&s;elf, but likewi&s;e of that which you had engaged others to do. And no eye but that of an all &s;earching God can &s;ee into what di&s;tant times or places the ble&s;&s;ed con&s;equences may reach. In every in&s;tance in which the&s;e con&s;equences appear, it will put a generous and &s;ublime joy into your heart, which no worldly pro&s;perity could afford, and which would be the livelie&s;t emblem of that high delight which the ble&s;&s;ed God feels, in &s;eeing and making his crea|tures happy.</P>

<P N="1">&sect; 1. THE repre&s;entation I have been making of the plea&s;ure and advantage of a life &s;pent in de|votedne&s;s to God, and communion with him, as I have de&s;cribed it above, will, I hope, engage you, my dear reader, to form &s;ome purpo&s;es, and make &s;ome attempt to obtain it. But, from con&s;idering the nature, and ob|&s;erving the cour&s;e of things, it appears exceedingly evi|dent,

that, be&s;ides the general oppo&s;ition, which I for|merly mentioned, as like to attend you in your fir&s;t en|trance on a religious life, you will find, even after you have re&s;olutely broke through this, a variety, of hinder|ances in any attempts of exemplary piety, and in the pro|&s;ecution of a remarkably &s;trict and edifying cour&s;e, will pre&s;ent them&s;elves daily in your path. And whereas you may, by a few re&s;olute efforts baffle &s;ome of the former &s;ort of enemies, the&s;e will be perpetually renew|ing their on&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, and a vigorous &s;truggle mu&s;t be continu|ally maintained with them. Give me leave now, there|fore, to be particular in my cautions again&s;t &s;ome of the chief of them. And here I would in&s;i&s;t upon the difficul|ties which will ari&s;e from indolence and the love of plea|&s;ure, from vain company, and from worldly cares. Each of the&s;e may prove en&s;naring to any, and e&s;pecially to young per&s;ons, to whom I would now have &s;ome par|ticular regard.</P>
<P N="2">&sect; 2. I entreat you, therefore, in the fir&s;t place, that you would guard again&s;t a &s;luggi&s;h and indolent temper. The love of ea&s;e in&s;inuates it&s;elf into the heart, under a variety of plau&s;ible pretences, which are often allowed to pa&s;s, when temptations of a gro&s;&s;er nature would not be admitted. The mi&s;pending a little time &s;eems to wi&s;e and good men but a &s;mall matter; yet this &s;ometimes runs them into great inconveniences. It often leads them to break in upon the &s;ea&s;ons regularly allotted to devo|tion, and to defer bu&s;ine&s;s. which might immediately be done, but being put off from day to day, is not done at all; and therefore the &s;ervices of life are at lea&s;t dimi|ni&s;hed, and the rewards of eternity dimini&s;hed propor|tionably; not to in&s;i&s;t upon it, that very frequently lays the &s;oul open to farther temptations, by which it falls, in con&s;equence of being found unemployed. Be, therefore, &s;u&s;picious of the fir&s;t approaches of this kind. Remember, that the &s;oul of man is an active being, and that it mu&s;t end its plea&s;ure in activity. Gird up, therefore, the "loins of your mind 1 Pet. 1, 13." En|deavour to keep your&s;elf always well employed. Be ex|act, if I may with humble reverence u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, in your appointments with God. Meet him early in the morning; and &s;ay not with the &s;luggard, when the
<PB N="195" REF="021060_0208_0FB20DA2AB3A77A0">

Quit the company of your deare&s;t friends, and retire to your proper bu&s;ine&s;s whether it be in the field, the &s;hop, or the clo&s;et: for by acting contrary to the &s;ecret dictates of your mind, as to what it is ju&s;t at the pre&s;ent moment be&s;t to do, though it be but in the man|ner of &s;pending half an hour, &s;ome degree of guilt is con|tracted, and a habit is cheri&s;hed, which may draw after it much wor&s;e con&s;equences. Con&s;ider, therefore, what duties are to be di&s;patched, and in what &s;ea&s;ons. Form your plan as prudently as you can, and pur&s;ue it re&s;olute|ly: unle&s;s any unexpected incident ari&s;es, which leads you to conclude that duty calls you another way. Al|lowances for &s;uch unthought of interruptions mu&s;t be made; but if, in con&s;equence of this, you are obliged to omit any thing of importance which you purpo&s;ed to have done to-day. do it if po&s;&s;ible to-morrow: and do not cut your&s;elf out new work till the former plan be di&s;patched; unle&s;s you really judge it, not merely more amu&s;ing, but more important. And always re|member, that a &s;ervant of Chri&s;t &s;hould &s;ee to it that he determine on the&s;e occa&s;ions as in his Ma&s;ter's pre|&s;ence.</P>
<P N="3">&sect; 3. Guard al&s;o again&s;t an exce&s;&s;ive love of &s;en&s;itive and animal plea&s;ure, as that which will be a great hin|drance to you in that religious cour&s;e which I have now been urging. You cannot but know that Chri&s;t has told us, that <Q>a man mu&s;t deny him&s;elf, and take up his cro&s;s daily, if he de&s;ire to become his di&s;ciple Luke 9, 23. Chri&s;t the Son of God, the Former and the Heir of all things, plea&s;ed not him&s;elf Rom. 15, 1;</Q> but &s;ubmitted to want, to difficulties and hard&s;hips, in the way of duty, and &s;ome of them in the extreme&s;t kind and degree, for the glory of God, and the &s;alvation of men. In this way we are to follow him; and as we know not how &s;oon we may be called even to <Q>re&s;i&s;t unto blood, &s;triving again&s;t &s;in Heb. 12, 4,</Q> it is cer|tainly be&s;t to accu&s;tom our&s;elves to that di&s;cipline which
<PB N="196" REF="021060_0209_0FB20DA5A377E520">
we may po&s;&s;ibly be called out to exerci&s;e, even in &s;uch rigorous heights. A &s;oft and delicate life will give force to temptations, which might ea&s;ily be &s;ubdued by one who has habituated him&s;elf to <Q>endure hard&s;hip, as a &s;oldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t 2 Tim 2, 3.</Q> It al&s;o produces an attachment to this world, and an unwillingne&s;s to leave it; which ill becomes tho&s;e who are &s;trangers and pilgrims on earth, and who expect &s;o &s;oon to be called away to that better country which they profe&s;s to &s;eek Heb. 11, 13&mdash;16. Add to this, that what the world calls a life of plea&s;ure, is nece&s;&s;arily a life of expence too, and may, perhaps, lead you, as it hath done many others, and e&s;|pecially many who have been &s;etting out in the world, beyond the limits which providence has a&s;&s;igned; and &s;o, after a &s;hort cour&s;e of indulgence, may produce pro|portionable want. And while in other ca&s;es it is true, that pity &s;hould be &s;hown to the poor, this is a poverty that is ju&s;tly contemptible, becau&s;e it is the effect of a man's own folly; and when your want thus <Q>comes upon you as an armed man Prov. 6, 11,</Q> you will not only find your&s;elf &s;tripped of the capacity you might otherwi&s;e have &s;ecured for performing tho&s;e works of charity, which are &s;o ornamental to a Chri&s;tian pro|fe&s;&s;ion, but, probably, will be under &s;trong temptations to &s;ome low artifice, or mean compliance, quite beneath the Chri&s;tian character, and that of an upright man. Many who once made a high profe&s;&s;ion, after a &s;eries of &s;uch &s;orry and &s;candalous &s;hifts, have fallen into the infamy of bankrupts, and of the wor&s;t kinds of bank|rupts; I mean &s;uch as have lavi&s;hed away on them&s;elves what was indeed the property of others, and &s;o have injured, and perhaps ruined, the indu&s;trious, to feed a fooli&s;h, luxurious, or o&s;tentatious humour, which, while indulged, was the &s;hame of their own families, and, when it can be indulged no longer, is their torment. This will be a terrible reproach to religion: &s;uch a reproach to it, that a good man would rather chu&s;e to live on bread and water, or indeed to die for want of them, than to occa&s;ion it.</P>
<P N="4">&sect; 4. Guard, therefore, I be&s;eech you, again&s;t any thing which might tend that way, e&s;pecially by diligence in bu&s;ine&s;s, and by prudence and frugality in expence;

<P N="5">&sect; 5. In this view, give me leave al&s;o &s;eriou&s;ly and tenderly to caution you, my dear reader, again&s;t the &s;nares of vain company. I &s;peak not, as before, of that company, which is openly licentious and profane. I hope there is &s;omething now in your temper and views which would engage you to turn away from &s;uch with dete&s;tation and horror. But I be&s;eech you to con&s;ider, that tho&s;e companions may be very dangerous who might at fir&s;t give you but very little alarm; I mean tho&s;e, who, though not the declared enemies of religion, and profe&s;&s;ed followers of vice and di&s;order, yet neverthele&s;s have no practical &s;en&s;e of divine things on their hearts, &s;o far as can be judged by their conver&s;ation and beha|viour. You mu&s;t often of nece&s;&s;ity be with &s;uch per&s;ons, and Chri&s;tianity not only allows, but requires, that you &s;hould, on all expedient occa&s;ions of intercour&s;e with them, treat them with civility and re&s;pect: but chu&s;e not &s;uch for your mo&s;t intimate friends, and do not contrive to &s;pend mo&s;t of your lei&s;ure moments a|mong them. For &s;uch conver&s;e has a &s;en&s;ible tendency to alienate the &s;oul from God, and to render it unfit for all &s;piritual communion with him. To convince you of this, do but reflect on your own experience, when you have been for many hours together among per&s;ons of &s;uch a character. Do you not find your&s;elf more in|di&s;po&s;ed for devotional exerci&s;es? Do you not find your
<PB N="189" REF="021060_0211_0FB20DA863663D98">
heart, by in&s;en&s;ible degrees, more and more inclined to a conformity to this world, and to look with a &s;ecret di&s;reli&s;h on tho&s;e objects and employments to which rea|&s;on directs as the noble&s;t and the be&s;t? Ob&s;erve the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms, and guard again&s;t the &s;nare in time: and, for this purpo&s;e endeavour to form friend&s;hips founded in piety, and &s;upported by it. "Be a companion of them that fear God, and of them that keep his precepts P&s;. 119, 63." You well know, that in the &s;ight of God "they are the excellent of the earth;" let them therefore "be all your delight P&s;al. 16, 3." And that the peculiar benefit of their friend&s;hip may not be lo&s;t, endeavour to make the be&s;t of the hours you &s;pend with them. The wi&s;e&s;t of men has ob&s;erved, that when "council in the heart of a man is like deep waters," that is, when it lyes low and concealed, "a man of un|der&s;tanding will draw it out Prov. 20, 5." Endeavour therefore, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, &s;o far as you can do it with decency and convenience, to give the conver&s;ation a re|ligious turn. And when &s;erious and u&s;eful &s;ubjects are &s;tarted in your pre&s;ence, lay hold of them, and cultivate them; and, for that purpo&s;e, <Q>let the word of Chri&s;t dwell richly in you Col. 3, 16.</Q> and be continually made "the man of your coun&s;el P&s;al. 119, 24."</P>

And it will al&s;o engage you to guard again&s;t tho&s;e exce&s;&s;ive hurries of worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, which would fill up all your time and thoughts, and thereby choke the good word of God, and render it in a great mea&s;ure, if not quite unfruitful Matth. 13, 22. Young people are generally of an enterpri&s;ing di&s;po&s;i|tion: having experienced comparatively little of the fa|tigue of bu&s;ine&s;s, and of the di&s;appointments and incum|brances of life, they ea&s;ily &s;wallow them up, and anni|hilate them in their imagination, and fancy that their &s;pirit, their application and addre&s;s, will be able to en|counter and &s;urmount every ob&s;tacle or hindrance. But the event proves it otherwi&s;e. Let me intreat you, therefore, to be cautious how you plunge your&s;elf into a greater variety of bu&s;ine&s;s than you are capable of ma|naging as you ought, that is, in con&s;i&s;tence with the

care of your &s;ouls, and the &s;ervice of God; which cer|tainly ought not on any pretence to be neglected. It is true indeed, that a prudent regard to your worldly in|tere&s;t would require &s;uch a caution; as it is obvious to every careful ob&s;erver, that multitudes are undone by gra&s;ping at more than they can conveniently manage.&mdash; Hence it has frequently been &s;een, that while they have &s;eemed <Q>re&s;olved to be rich, they have pierced them&s;elves through with many &s;orrows 1 Tim. 6, 10.</Q> have ruined their own families, and drawn down many others into de&s;olation with them: whereas, could they have been contented with moderate employments, and moderate gains, they might have pro&s;pered in their bu&s;ine&s;s, and might, by &s;ure degrees, under a divine ble&s;&s;ing, have advanced to great and honourable increa&s;e. But if there were no danger at all to be apprehended on this head; if you were as certain of becoming rich and great as you are of perplexing and fatiguing your|&s;elf in the attempt; con&s;ider, I be&s;eech you, how pre|carious the&s;e enjoyments are. Con&s;ider how often a <Q>plentiful table becomes a &s;nare, and that which &s;hould have been for a man's welfare becomes a trap P&s;. 69, 22.</Q> Forget not that &s;hort le&s;&s;on, which is &s;o com|prehen&s;ive of the highe&s;t wi&s;dom, <Q>One thing is need|ful Luke 10, 4. Be daily thinking, while the gay and great things of life are glittering before your eyes, how &s;oon death will come, and impoveri&s;h you at once; how &s;oon it will &s;trip you of all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions but tho&s;e which a naked &s;oul can carry along with it into eternity, when it drops the body into the grave.</Q> E|TERNITY!

You &s;ee indeed, that the generality of men act as if they thought the great thing which God requires of them, in order to &s;ecure his favour, was to get as much of the world as po&s;&s;ible; at lea&s;t, as much as they can without any gro&s;s immorality, and without ri&s;king the lo&s;s of all, for mak|ing a little addition.

In mo&s;t in&s;tances men &s;eek the world,&mdash;either that they may hoard up riches for the mean and &s;candalous &s;atisfaction of look|ing upon them while they are living, and of thinking, that when they are dead, it will be &s;aid of them, that they have left &s;o many hundreds or thou&s;ands of pounds behind them; very probably to in&s;nare their children, or other heirs, (for the vanity is not peculiar to tho&s;e who have children of their own: &mdash;or el&s;e, that they may lavi&s;h away their riches on their lu&s;ts, and drown them&s;elves in a gulph of &s;en&s;uality, in which, if rea&s;on be not lo&s;t, religion is &s;oon &s;wallowed up, and, with it, all the noble&s;t plea&s;ures which can enter into the heart of man. In this view, the generality of rich people ap|pear to me objects of much greater compa&s;&s;ion than the poor; e&s;pecially as when both live (which is frequently the ca&s;e) without any fear of God before their eyes, the rich abu&s;e the greater variety and abundance of his fa|vours, and therefore will probably feel in that world of future ruin which awaits impenitent &s;inners, a more exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;e of their mi&s;ery.</P>

When, therefore, an attachment to the world may be followed with &s;uch fatal con&s;equences, <Q>let not thine heart envy &s;inners Prov. 22, 17;</Q> and do not, out of a de&s;ire of gaining what they have, be guilty of &s;uch folly, as to expo&s;e your&s;elf to this double danger of fail|ing in the attempt, or of being undone by the &s;ucce&s;s of it.

Refer, therefore, all this to him.

Much do I fear that you will feel your mind langui&s;h and tire in the good ways of God! nay, that you may be prevailed upon to take &s;ome &s;tep out of them, and may thus fall a prey to &s;ome of tho&s;e temptations which you now look upon with a holy &s;corn. The probable con&s;equence of this will be, that God will hide his face from you; that he will &s;tretch forth his afflicting hand again&s;t you; and that you will &s;till &s;ee your &s;orrowful moments, how chearfully &s;oever you may now be <Q>rejoicing in the Lord, and joying in the God of your &s;alvation Hab. 3, 18.</Q> I hope, therefore, it may be of &s;ome &s;ervice, if this too probable event &s;hould happen, to con&s;ider the&s;e ca&s;es a little more particularly: and I heartily pray that God would make what I &s;hall &s;ay concerning them the means of re&s;toring, comforting, and &s;trengthening your &s;oul, if he ever &s;uffers you in any degree to deviate from him.</P>

And here I de&s;ire that, before I proceed any farther, you would ob&s;erve, that I do not comprehend under this head, every abate|ment of that fervour which a young convert may find, when he fir&s;t becomes experimentally acquainted with divine things. Our natures are &s;o framed, that the no|velty of objects &s;trikes them in &s;omething of a peculiar manner; not to urge how much more ea&s;ily our pa&s;&s;i|ons are impre&s;&s;ed in the earlier years of life, than when we are more advanced in the journey of it. This, per|haps, is not &s;ufficiently con&s;idered. Too great a &s;tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is commonly laid on the flow of affections; and for want of this, a Chri&s;tian who is ripened in grace, and greatly advanced in his preparations for glory, may &s;ometimes be ready to lament imaginary rather than real decays, and to &s;ay, without any ju&s;t foundation. <Q>Oh that it were with me as in months pa&s;t Job. 29, 2.</Q> There|fore
<PB N="205" REF="021060_0218_0FB20DB817438160">
you can hardly be too frequently told, that reli|gion con&s;i&s;ts chiefly "in the re&s;olution of the will for God, and in a con&s;tant care to avoid whatever we are per&s;uaded he would di&s;approve, to di&s;patch the work he has a&s;&s;igned us in life, and to promote his glory in the happine&s;s of mankind." To this we are chiefly to at|tend, looking in all to the &s;implicity and purity of tho&s;e motives from which we act, which we know are chiefly regarded by that God who &s;earches the heart; hum|bling our&s;elves before him at the &s;ame time under a &s;en&s;e of our many imperfections, and flying to the blood of Chri&s;t and the grace of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="3">&sect; 3. Having given this precaution, I will now a little more particularly de&s;cribe the ca&s;e which I call the &s;tate of a Chri&s;tian, who is declining in religion, &s;o far as it does not fall in with tho&s;e which I &s;hall con&s;ider in the following chapters. And I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that it chiefly con&s;i&s;ts "in a forgetfulne&s;s of divine objects, and a remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in tho&s;e various duties to which we &s;tand engaged by that &s;olemn &s;urrender which we have made of our&s;elves to the &s;ervice of God." There will be a variety of &s;ymptoms, according to the different circum&s;tances and relations in which the Chri&s;tian is placed; but &s;ome will be of a more univer&s;al kind. It will be peculiarly proper to touch on the&s;e; and &s;o much the rather as the&s;e declen&s;ions are often unob&s;erved, like the grey hairs which were upon Ephraim, when he knew it not Ho&s;. 7 9.</P>
<P N="4">&sect; 4. Should you, my good reader, fall into this &s;tate, it will probably fir&s;t di&s;cover it&s;elf by a failure in the duties of the clo&s;et. Not that I &s;uppo&s;e they will at fir&s;t or certainly conclude, that they will at all be wholly omitted, but they will be run over in a cold and formal manner. Sloth, or &s;ome of tho&s;e other &s;nares which I cautioned you again&s;t in the former chapter, will &s;o far prevail upon you, that though perhaps you know and recollect that the proper &s;ea&s;on for retirement is come, you will &s;ometimes indulge your&s;elf upon your bed in the morning, &s;ometimes in conver&s;ation or bu&s;ine&s;s in the evening, &s;o as not to have convenient time for it: or perhaps, when you come into your clo&s;et at that &s;ea|&s;on, &s;ome favourite book you are de&s;irous to read, &s;ome corre&s;pondence that you chu&s;e to carry on, or &s;ome other

amu&s;ement will pre&s;ent it&s;elf, and plead to be dipatched fir&s;t. This will probably take up more time than you imagine; and then &s;ecret prayer will be hurried over, and perhaps reading the Scripture quite neglected. You will plead perhaps, that it is but for once; but the &s;ame allowance will be made a &s;econd and a third time; and it will grow more ea&s;y and familiar to you each time than it was the la&s;t. And thus God will be mocked, and your own &s;oul will be defrauded of its &s;piritual meals, if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion; the word of God will be &s;lighted, and &s;elf-examination quite di&s;u&s;ed; and &s;ecret prayer it&s;elf will grow a burden rather than a delight; and a trifling ceremony rather than a devout homage, &s;it for the acceptance of our Father who is in heaven.</P>
<P N="5">&sect; 5. If immediate and re&s;olute mea&s;ures be not taken for our recovery from the&s;e declen&s;ions, they will &s;pread farther, and reach the acts of &s;ocial wor&s;hip. You will feel the effect in your families, and in public ordinances. And if you do not feel it, the &s;ymptoms will be &s;o much the wor&s;e. Wandering thoughts will (as it were) eat out the very heart of the&s;e duties. It is not, I believe, the privilege of the mo&s;t eminent Chri&s;tians to be entire|ly free from them: but, probably, in the&s;e circum&s;tan|ces, you will find but few intervals of &s;trict attention, or of any thing which wears the appearance of inward de|votion. And when the&s;e heartle&s;s duties are concluded, there will &s;carce be a reflection made how little God hath been enjoyed in them, how little he hath been ho|noured by them. Perhaps the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper, being &s;o admirably adapted to fix the attention of the &s;oul, and to excite its warme&s;t exerci&s;e of holy affections, may be the la&s;t ordinance in which the&s;e de|clen&s;ions will be felt. And yet who can &s;ay that the &s;a|cred table is a privileged place? Having been unnece&s;&s;a|rily &s;traitened in your preparations, you will attend with le&s;s fixedne&s;s and enlargement of heart than u&s;ual. And perhaps a di&s;&s;atisfaction in the review, when there has been a remarkable alienation or in&s;en&s;ibility of mind, may occa&s;ion a di&s;po&s;ition to for&s;ake your place and your duty there.

When your love to God our Father, and to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t fails, your fervour of Chri&s;tian affec|tion to your brethren in Chri&s;t will proportionally de|cline, and your concern for u&s;efulne&s;s in life abate; e|&s;pecially, where any thing is to be done for &s;piritual edi|fication. You will find one excu&s;e or another for the neglect of religious di&s;cour&s;e, perhaps not only among neighbours and Chri&s;tian friends, when very convenient opportunities offer, but even with regard to tho&s;e who are members of your own families, and to tho&s;e who, if you are fixed in the &s;uperior relations of life, are com|mitted to your care.</P>

In &s;ome in&s;tances, perhaps the &s;tricte&s;t bounds of temperance, and the regular appoint|ments of life, may be broken in upon through a fondne&s;s for company, and the entertainments which often attend it. In other in&s;tances, the intere&s;ts of life appearing greater than they did before, and taking up more of the mind, contrary intere&s;ts of other per&s;ons may throw you into di&s;quietude, or plunge you in debate and contenti|on; in which it is extremely difficult to pre&s;erve either the &s;erenity or the innocence of the &s;oul. And perhaps, if mini&s;ters and other Chri&s;tian friends ob&s;erve this, and endeavour, in a plain and faithful way, to reduce you from your wandering, a fal&s;e delicacy of mind, often contracted in &s;uch a &s;tate as this, will render the&s;e at|tempts extremely di&s;agreeable. The ulcer of the &s;oul (if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion) will not bear being touched when it mo&s;t needs it; and one of the mo&s;t generous and &s;elf denying in&s;tances of Chri&s;tian friend|&s;hip &s;hall be turned into an occa&s;ion of coldne&s;s and di&s;|ta&s;te, yea perhaps of enmity.</P>

Nay, you may think it a great improvement in under&s;tanding that you have learnt from &s;ome new ma&s;ters, that if a man treat his fellow creatures with humanity and good nature, judging and reviling only tho&s;e who would di&s;turb others by the narrowne&s;s of their notions (for the&s;e are generally exempted from other objects of the mo&s;t univer&s;al and di&s;intere&s;ted be|nevolence &s;o often boa&s;ted of) he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be in a very good &s;tate, though he pretend not to conver&s;e much with God, provided that he think re&s;pectfully of him, and do not provoke him by any gro&s;s immo|ralities.</P>

One &s;erious thought of eternity &s;hames a thou|&s;and vain excu&s;es, with which, in the forgetfulne&s;s of it, we are ready to delude our own &s;ouls. And when you feel that &s;ecret mi&s;giving of heart, which will naturally ari&s;e on this occa&s;ion, do not endeavour to palliate the matter, and to find out flight and artful coverings for what you cannot forbear &s;ecretly condemning; but ho|ne&s;tly fall under the conviction, and be humbling for it. Pour out your heart before God, and &s;eek the renewed influences of his Spirit and grace. Return with more exactne&s;s to &s;ecret devotion, and to &s;elf-examination. Read the Scripture with yet greater diligence, and e&s;|pecially the more devotional and &s;piritual parts of it. Labour to ground it in your heart, and to feel what you have rea&s;on to believe the &s;acred penmen felt when they wrote, &s;o far as circum&s;tances may agree. Open your &s;oul with all &s;implicity to every le&s;&s;on which the word of God would teach you; and guard again&s;t tho&s;e things which you perceive to alienate your mind from inward religion, though there be nothing criminal in the things them&s;elves. They may perhaps in the general be law|ful; to &s;ome, po&s;&s;ibly, they may be expedient; but if they produce &s;uch an effect, as was mentioned above, it is certain they are not convenient for you.

THE declen&s;ions which I have de&s;cribed in the foregoing chapter mu&s;t be acknowledged worthy of deep lamentation: but happy will you be, my dear reader, if you never know, by experience, a cir|cum&s;tance yet more melancholy than this. Perhaps, when you con&s;ider the view of things which you now have, you imagine that no con&s;iderations can ever bribe you, in any &s;ingle in&s;tance, to act contrary to the pre|&s;ent dictates or &s;ugge&s;tions of your con&s;cience, and of the Spirit of God as &s;etting it on work.

But Peter thought and &s;aid &s;o too: <Q>Though I &s;hould die with thee, yet will I not deny thee Mat. 26, 35: and yet after all he fell; and therefore be not high minded, but fear Rom. 9, 20.</Q> It is not im|po&s;&s;ible but you may fall into that very &s;in of which you imagine you are lea&s;t in danger, or into that again&s;t which you have mo&s;t &s;olemnly re&s;olved, and of which you have already mo&s;t bitterly repented. You may re|lap&s;e into it again and again; but, oh, if you do, nay, if you &s;hould deliberately and pre&s;umptuou&s;ly fall but once, Low deep will it pierce your heart; how dear will you pay for all the plea&s;ure with which the temptation has been baited? how will this &s;eperate between God and you? What a de&s;olation, what a dreadful de&s;olation, will it &s;pread over your &s;oul! It is grievous to think of it. Perhaps in &s;uch a &s;tate you may feel more agony and di&s;|tre&s;s in your own con&s;cience, when you come &s;eriou&s;ly to reflect, than you ever felt when you were fir&s;t awakened and reclaimed; becau&s;e the &s;in will be attended with &s;ome very high aggravations beyond tho&s;e of your unregene|rate &s;tate.

Your &s;piritual con&s;olations will be gone; and your temporal enjoyments will al&s;o be rendered ta&s;tele&s;s and in&s;ipid.

Let me addre&s;s you in the lan|guage of God to his back&s;liding people, when they were ready to apprehend that to be their ca&s;e, and to draw &s;uch a conclu&s;ion from it: <Q>Only return unto me, &s;aith the Lord Jer. 3, 1.13.</Q> Cry for renewed grace; and, in the &s;trength of it, labour to return. Cry with David under the like guilt. <Q>I have gone a&s;tray like a lo&s;t &s;heep, &s;eek thy &s;ervant; for I do not forget thy commandment P&s;. 119, 176;</Q> and that remembrance of them is, I hope, a token for good.

If this has been the &s;ad ca&s;e with you, my then unhappy reader, I would pity you, and mourn over you; and would be&s;eech you, as you tender your peace, your recovery, the health and the very life of your &s;oul, that you would not loiter away an hour. Retire immediately for &s;erious reflection. Break thro' other engagements and employments, unle&s;s they be &s;uch as you cannot in con&s;cience delay for a few hours, which can &s;eldom happen in the circum&s;tance I now &s;uppo&s;e. This is the one thing needful. Set your|&s;elf to it, therefore, as in the pre&s;ence of God, and hear at large patiently and humbly, what con&s;cience has to &s;ay, though it chide and reproach &s;everely. Yea, ear|ne&s;tly pray, that God would &s;peak to you by con&s;cience, and make you more thoroughly to know and feel <Q>what an evil and bitter thing it is that you have thus for|&s;aken him Jer. 2, 19.</Q> Think of all the aggravating circum&s;tances attending your offence, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e which ari&s;e from abu&s;ed mercy and goodne&s;s; which ari&s;e not only from your &s;olemn vows and engagements to God, but from the views you have had of a Redeem|er's love, &s;ealed even in blood. And are the&s;e the returns? Was it not enough that Chri&s;t &s;hould have been <Q>thus injured by his enemies? mu&s;t he be wounded in the hou&s;e of his friends, too Zech. 13, 6? Were

Oh, think how ju&s;tly God might ca&s;t you out from his pre&s;ence! How ju&s;tly he might num|ber you among the mo&s;t &s;ignal in&s;tances of his ven|geance! And think how <Q>your heart would endure, or your hands be &s;trong, if he would deal thus with you Ezek. 22, 14!</Q> Alas! all your former experi|encies would enhance your &s;en&s;e of the ruin and mi&s;ery that mu&s;t be felt in an eternal bani&s;hment from the di|vine pre&s;ence and favour.</P>
<P N="5">&sect; 5. Indulge &s;uch reflections as the&s;e. Stand the humbling &s;ight of your &s;ins in &s;uch a view as this. The more odious and more painful it appears, the greater pro&s;pect there will be of your benefit by attending to it. But the matter is not to re&s;t here. All the&s;e re|flections are intended, not to grieve, but to cure; and to grieve no more than promote the cure. You are in|deed to look upon &s;in; but you are al&s;o, in &s;uch a cir|cum&s;tance, if ever, to <Q>look upon Chri&s;t: to look upon him whom you have now pierced" deeper than be|fore, and to mourn for him with &s;incerity and ten|derne&s;s Zech. 12, 10.</Q>&mdash;The God whom you have injured and affronted, who&s;e laws you have broken, and who&s;e ju&s;tice you have (as it were) challenged by this fooli&s;h wretched apo&s;tacy, is neverthele&s;s <Q>a mo&s;t mer|ciful God Deut. 4, 31</Q> You cannot be &s;o ready to return to him, as he is ready to receive you. Even now does he, as it were, &s;olicit a reconciliation by tho&s;e tender impre&s;&s;ions which he is making upon your heart. But remember how he will be reconciled. It is in the very &s;ame way in which you made your fir&s;t approaches to him; in the name, and for the &s;ake of his dear Son. Come, therefore, in an humble dependence upon him. Renew your application to Je&s;us, that his blood may (as it were) be &s;prinkled upon your &s;oul, that your &s;oul may thereby be purified, and your guilt removed. This very &s;in of your's, which the ble&s;&s;ed God fore&s;aw, increa&s;ed the weight of your Redeemer's

&s;ufferings: it was concerned in &s;hedding his blood. Humbly go, and place your wounds (as it were) un|der the droppings of that precious balm by which alone they can be healed. That compa&s;&s;ionate Saviour will delight to re&s;tore you, when you lye as an humble &s;up|plicant at his feet, and will graciou&s;ly take part with you in that peace and plea&s;ure which he gives. Through him renew your covenant with God, that broken co|venant, the breach of which divine ju&s;tice might teach you to know <Q>by terrible things in righteou&s;ne&s;s P&s;. 65, 5;</Q> but mercy allows of an accommodation. Let the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s and remembrance of the breach engage you to enter into a covenant a new, under a deeper &s;en&s;e than ever of your own weakne&s;s, and a more cordial dependence on divine grace for your &s;ecurity, than you have ever yet entertained. I know you will be a&s;hamed to pre&s;ent your&s;elf among the children of God in his &s;anctuary, and e&s;pecially at his table, under a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;o much guilt; but break through that &s;hame, if Providence open you the way. You would be humbled before your of|fended Father; but &s;urely there is no place where you are more like to be humbled, than when you &s;ee your|&s;elf in his hou&s;e; and no ordinance admini&s;tered there can lay you lower than that in which <Q>Chri&s;t is evi|dently &s;et forth as crucified before your eyes Gal. 3, 1.</Q> Sinners are the only per&s;ons who have bu&s;ine&s;s there; the be&s;t of men come to that &s;acred table as &s;in|ners; as &s;uch make your approach to it; yea, as the greate&s;t of &s;inners; as one who needs the blood of Je&s;us as much as any creature upon earth.</P>
<P N="6">&sect; 6. And let me remind you of one thing more: If your fall has been of &s;uch a nature as to give any &s;candal to others, be not at all concerned to &s;ave appearances, and to moderate tho&s;e mortifications, which deep humi|liation before them would occa&s;ion. The depth and pain of that mortification is indeed an excellent medicine, which God has in his wi&s;e goodne&s;s appointed for you in &s;uch circum&s;tances as the&s;e. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, confe&s;s your fault with the greate&s;t frankne&s;s: aggravate it to the utmo&s;t; intreat pardon and prayer from tho&s;e whom you have offended. Then, and never till then, will you be in the way to peace: not by palliating a fault, not by
<PB N="219" REF="021060_0232_0FB29E5763CAFAA8">
making vain excu&s;es, not by objecting to the manner in which others may have treated you; as if the lea&s;t ex|ce&s;s of rigour in a faithful admonition were a crime equal to &s;ome great immorality that occa&s;ioned it. This can only proceed from the madne&s;s of pride and &s;elf-love: it is the &s;en&s;ibility of a wound which is hardened, &s;well|ed, and enflamed! and it mu&s;t be reduced and cooled, and &s;uppled, before it can po&s;&s;ibly be cured. To be cen|&s;ured and condemned by men, will be but a little griev|ance to a &s;oul thoroughly humbled and broken under a &s;en&s;e of having incurred the condemning &s;entence of God. Such a one will rather de&s;ire to glorify God, by &s;ubmitting to de&s;erved blame; and will fear deceiving others into a more favourable opinion of him than he in|wardly knows him&s;elf to de&s;erve. The&s;e are the &s;enti|ments which God gives to the &s;incere penitent in &s;uch a ca&s;e; and by this means he re&s;tores him to that credit and regard among others, which he does not know how to &s;eek; but which, neverthele&s;s for the &s;ake both of his comfort and u&s;efulne&s;s, God wills that he &s;hould have; and which it is, humanely &s;peaking, impo&s;&s;ible for him to recover any other way. But there is &s;omething &s;o honorable in the frank acknowledgment of a fault, and in deep humiliation for it, that all who &s;ee it mu&s;t needs approve it. They pity an offender who is brought to &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition, and endeavour to comfort him with returning expre&s;&s;ions, not only of their love, but of their e&s;teem too.</P>

Excu&s;e this digre&s;&s;ion, which may &s;uit &s;ome ca&s;es; and which would &s;uit many more, if a regular di&s;cipline were to be exerci&s;ed in churches: for on &s;uch a &s;uppo|&s;ition, the Lord's &s;upper could not be approached af|ter vi&s;ible and &s;candalous falls without &s;olemn confe&s;&s;ion of the offence and declarations of repentance.

<P>O Mo&s;t holy, holy, holy, Lord God! when I &s;eri|ou&s;ly reflect on thy &s;potle&s;s purity, and on the &s;trict and impartial methods of thy &s;teady admini&s;tration, to|gether with that almighty power of thine, which is able to carry every thought of thine heart into immediate and full execution, I may ju&s;tly appear before thee this day with &s;hame and terror, in confu&s;ion and con&s;terna|tion of &s;pirit. This day, O my God, this dark mourn|ful day, would I take occa&s;ion to look back to that fad &s;ource of our guilt and our mi&s;ery, the apo&s;tacy of our common parents, and &s;ay, with thine offending &s;ervant David, "Behold, I was &s;hapen in iniquity, and in &s;in did my mother conceive me P&s;. 51, 5."

<P>Behold me, O Lord God, falling down at thy feet! Behold me, pleading guilty in thy pre&s;ence, and &s;ur|rendering my&s;elf to that ju&s;tice which I cannot e&s;cape!

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">&sect; 1. THERE is a ca&s;e which often occurs in the Chri&s;tian life, which they who accu&s;tom them|&s;elves much to the exerci&s;e of devotion, have been u&s;ed to call <HI>hidings of God's face.</HI> It is a phra&s;e borrowed from the word of God, which I hope may &s;helter it from contempt at the fir&s;t hearing. It will be my bu&s;i|ne&s;s in this chapter to &s;tate it as plainly as I can, and then to give &s;ome advices as to your own conduct when you fall into it, as it is very probable you may, before you have fini&s;hed your journey through this wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">&sect; 2. The meaning of it may partly be under&s;tood by the oppo&s;ite phra&s;e, of <HI>God's cau&s;ing his face to &s;hine</HI> upon a per&s;on, or <HI>lifting upon him the light of his countenance.</HI> This &s;eems to carry in it an allu&s;ion to the plea&s;ant and delightful appearance which the face of a friend has, and e&s;pecially if, in a &s;uperior relation of life, when he
<PB N="225" REF="021060_0238_0FB29E690D79A948">
conver&s;es with tho&s;e whom he loves and delights in. Thus Job, when &s;peaking of the regard paid him by his attendants, &s;ays, <Q>If I &s;miled upon them, they be|lieved it not, and the light of my countenance they ca&s;t not down Job. 29, 24;</Q> that is, they were care|ful, in &s;uch an agreeable circum&s;tance, to do nothing to di&s;plea&s;e me, or (as we &s;peak) to cloud my brow. And David, when expre&s;&s;ing his de&s;ire of the manife&s;tation of Gods favour to him, &s;ays, <Q>Lord lift thou up the light of thy reconciled countenance upon me;</Q> and, as the effect of it, declares, <Q>thou ha&s;t put gladne&s;s in my heart more than if corn and wine increa&s;ed P&s;al. 4, 6.7.</Q> Nor is it impo&s;&s;ible that, in this phra&s;e, as u&s;ed by David, there may be &s;ome allu&s;ion to the bright &s;hining forth of the Shechinah, that is, the lu|&s;tre which dwelt in the cloud as the vi&s;ible &s;ign of the divine pre&s;ence with I&s;rael, which God was plea&s;ed pe|culiarly to manife&s;t upon &s;ome public occa&s;ions, as a to|ken of his favour and acceptance.&mdash;On the other hand, therefore, for God to hide his face, mu&s;t imply the with|holding the tokens of his favour, and mu&s;t be e&s;teemed a mark of his di&s;plea&s;ure.

All that David &s;ays of <Q>beholding the beauty of the Lord P&s;. 27, 4. or being &s;atisfied as with marrow and fatne&s;s, when he remembered him upon his bed P&s;. 63, 5, 6." as well as with the goodne&s;s of his hou&s;e, even of his holy temple P&s;. 65, 4.</Q> is to be taken in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, and can need very little explication to the truly experienced &s;oul. But tho&s;e that have known the light of God's counte|nance, and the &s;hinings of his face, will, in proportion to the degree of that knowledge, be able to form &s;ome notion of the hiding of his face, or the withdrawing of the tokens he has given his people of his pre&s;ence and favour, which &s;ometimes greatly imbitters pro&s;perity; as where the contrary is found, it &s;weetens afflictions, and often &s;wallows up the &s;en&s;e of it.</P>

And give me leave to remind you, my Chri&s;tian friend (for under that character I now addre&s;s my rea|der) that to be thus deprived of the &s;en&s;e of God's love, and of the tokens of his favour, may &s;oon be the ca&s;e with you, though you may now have the plea&s;ure to &s;ee "the candle of the Lord &s;hining upon you," or though it may even &s;eem to be &s;un&s;hine and high noon in your &s;oul. You may lo&s;e your lively views of the di|vine perfections and glories, in the contemplation of which you now find that inward &s;atisfaction. You may think of the divine wi&s;dom and power, of the divine mercy and fidelity, as well as of his righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s, and feel little inward complacency of &s;oul in the view; it may be, with re&s;pect to any lively im|pre&s;&s;ion, as if it were the contemplation merely of a com|mon object. It may &s;eem to you as if you bad lo&s;t all idea to tho&s;e important words, though the view had

It may be matter of great and &s;ad doubt with you, whether you do indeed belong to God; and all the work of his ble&s;&s;|ed &s;pirit may be &s;o vailed and &s;haded in the &s;oul, that the peculiar characters by which the hand of that &s;a|cred Agent might be di&s;tingui&s;hed, &s;hall be in a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t; and you may be ready to imagine you had only deluded your&s;elf in all the former hopes you have entertained. In con&s;equence of this, tho&s;e ordinances, in which you now rejoice, may grow very uncomfort|able to you, even when you do indeed de&s;ire communion with God in them. You may hear the mo&s;t delightful evangelical truths opened, you may hear the privileges of God's children mo&s;t affectionately repre&s;ented, and not be aware that you have any part or lot in this mat|ter; and from that coldne&s;s and in&s;en&s;ibility, may be drawing a farther argument, that you have nothing to do with them. And then your heart may meditate terror I&s;. 33, 18; and under the di&s;tre&s;s that overwhelms you, your deare&s;t enjoyments may be reflected upon as adding to the weight of it, and making it more &s;en|&s;ible, while you con&s;ider that you had once &s;uch a ta&s;te for the&s;e things, and have now lo&s;t it all. So that per|haps it may &s;eem to you, that they who never felt any thing at all of religious impre&s;&s;ions, are happier than you, or at lea&s;t are le&s;s mi&s;erable. You may perhaps, in the&s;e melancholy hours, even doubt whether you have ever prayed at all; and whether all that you called your enjoyment of God were not &s;ome fal&s;e delights, excited by the great enemy of &s;ouls, to make you apprehend that your &s;tate was good, that &s;o you might continue his more &s;ecure prey.</P>

(7.)</HI> That when it is di&s;covered, it &s;hould humbly be complied with and an&s;wered, &sect; <HI>7.</HI> A prayer &s;uited to &s;uch a ca&s;e.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">&sect; 1. SINCE <Q>man is born unto trouble as the &s;parks fly upward Job. 5, 7.</Q> and Adam has en|tailed on all his race the &s;ad inheritance of calamity in their way to death, it will certainly be prudent and ne|ce&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould all expect to meet with trials and afflictions; and that you, reader, whoever you are, &s;hould be endeavouring to gird on your armour, and put your&s;elf into a po&s;ture to encounter tho&s;e trials which will fall to your lot as a man, and a Chri&s;tian. Pre|pare your&s;elf to receive your afflictions, and to endure them, in a manner agreeable to both tho&s;e characters. In this view, when you &s;ee others under the burden, con&s;ider how po&s;&s;ible it is that you may be called out to the very &s;ame difficulties, or to others equal to them. Put your &s;oul as in the place of theirs. Think how you could endure the load under which they lie; and endeavour at once to comfort them, and to &s;trengthen your own heart; or rather, pray that God would do it. And ob&s;erving how liable mortal life is to &s;uch &s;orrows, moderate your expectations from it; rai&s;e your thoughts above it; and form your &s;chemes of happine&s;s only for that world where they cannot be di&s;appointed: in the mean time, ble&s;&s;ing God, that your pro&s;perity is length|ened out this far, and a&s;cribing it to his &s;pecial provi|dence that you continue &s;o long unwounded, when &s;o many &s;howers of arrows are flying around you, and &s;o many are falling by them on the right hand and on the left.</P>
<P N="2">&sect; 2. When at length your turn comes, as it certainly will, from the fir&s;t hour in which an affliction &s;eizes you, realize to your&s;elf the hand of God in it, and lo&s;e not the view of him in any &s;econd cau&s;e, which may
<PB N="238" REF="021060_0251_0FB20E04DEB8A3A8">
have proved the immediate occa&s;ion. Let it be your fir&s;t care <Q>to humble your&s;elf under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time 1 Pet. 5, 6.</Q> Own, that <Q>he is ju&s;t in all that is brought upon you. Neh. 9, 33." and "that in all the&s;e things he puni&s;hes you le&s;s than your iniquities de&s;erve Ezra 9, 13.</Q> Compo&s;e your&s;elf to bear his hand with patience, to glorify his name by a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his will, and to fall in with the gracious de&s;ign of this vi&s;itation, as well as to wait the i&s;&s;ue of it quietly, whatever the event may be.</P>
<P N="3">&sect; 3. Now that <Q>patience may have its perfect work James 1, 4.</Q> reflect frequently and deeply upon your own meanne&s;s and &s;infulne&s;s. Con&s;ider how often every mercy has been forfeited, and every judgment de&s;erved. And con&s;ider too, how long the patience of God hath borne with you, and how wonderfully it is &s;till exerted towards you; and, indeed, not only his patience, but his bounty too. Afflicted as you are, (for I &s;peak to you now as actually under the pre&s;&s;ure,) look round and &s;urvey your remaining mercies, and be gratefully &s;en&s;i|ble of them. Make the &s;uppo&s;ition of their being re|moved: what if God &s;hould &s;tretch out his hand again&s;t you, and add poverty to pain, or pain to poverty, or the lo&s;s of friends to both; or the death of &s;urviving friends to that of tho&s;e who you are now mourning over; would not the wound be more grievous? Adore his goodne&s;s that this is not the ca&s;e: and take heed, le&s;t your un|thankfulne&s;s &s;hould provoke him to multiply your &s;or|rows. Con&s;ider al&s;o the need you have of di&s;cipline; how whole&s;ome it may prove to your &s;oul, and what merciful de&s;igns our heavenly Father has in all the cor|rections he &s;ends upon his children.</P>
<P N="4">&sect; 4. Nay, I will add, that, in con&s;equence of all the&s;e con&s;iderations, it may well be expected, not only that you &s;hould &s;ubmit to your afflictions, as what you can|not avoid, but that you &s;hould &s;weetly acquie&s;ce in them, approve them; that you &s;hould not only ju&s;tify, but glorify God, in &s;ending them; that you &s;hould glorify him with your heart, and with your lips too. Think not prai&s;e un&s;uitable on &s;uch an occa&s;ion; nor think that prai&s;e alone to be &s;uitable which takes its ri&s;e from
<PB N="239" REF="021060_0252_0FB20E06D7CB81C8">
remaining comforts: but know that it is your duty, not only to be thankful in your afflictions, but to be thank|ful on account of them.</P>
<P N="5">&sect; 5. God him&s;elf has &s;aid, <Q>In every thing give thanks 1 The&s;&s;. 5, 18; and he has taught his &s;er|vants to &s;ay, Yea al&s;o we glory in tribulation Rom. 5, 3.</Q> And mo&s;t certain it is, that to true believers they are in&s;tances of divine mercy; for <Q>whom the Lord loveth he cha&s;teneth, and &s;courgeth every &s;on whom he receiveth</Q> with peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hing en|dearment Heb. 12, 6. View your pre&s;ent afflictions in this light as cha&s;ti&s;ements of love; and then let your own heart &s;ay, whether love does not demand prai&s;e. Think with your&s;elf, it is thus that God is making me conformable to his own Son; it is thus that he is training me up for complete glory. Thus he kills my corruptions; thus he &s;trengthens my graces; thus he is wi&s;ely contriving to bring me nearer to him&s;elf, and to ripen me for the honours of his heavenly kingdom. It is <Q>if need be, that I am in heavine&s;s 1 Pet. 1, 6;</Q> and he &s;urely knows what that need is better than I can pretend to teach him; and knows what peculiar propriety there is in this affliction to an&s;wer my pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity, and do me that peculiar good which he is gra|ciou&s;ly intending me by it. <Q>This tribulation &s;hall work patience, and patience experience and experience a more a&s;&s;ured hope; even a hope which &s;hall not make a&s;hamed, while the love of God is &s;hed abroad in my heart Rom. 5, 3.4.5.</Q> and &s;hines through my af|fliction like the &s;un through a gently-de&s;cending cloud, darting in light upon the &s;hade, and mingling fruitful|ne&s;s with weeping.</P>
<P N="6">&sect; 6. Let it be then your earne&s;t care, while you thus look on your affliction, whatever it maybe, as coming from the hand of God, to improve it to the purpo&s;es for which it was &s;ent. And that you may &s;o improve it, let it be your fir&s;t concern to know what tho&s;e purpo&s;es are. Summon up all the attention of your &s;oul to <Q>hear the rod, and him who hath appointed it Mic. 6, 9;</Q> and pray earne&s;tly that you may under&s;tand its voice. Ex|amine your life, your words, and your heart; and pray,
<PB N="240" REF="021060_0253_0FB20E0A878A3CA0">
that God would &s;o guide your inquiries, that you may "return unto the Lord that &s;miteth you I&s;a. 9, 13." To a&s;&s;i&s;t you in this call in the help of pious friends, and particularly of your mini&s;ters: intreat not only their prayers, but their advices too, as to the probable de&s;ign of Providence; and encourage them freely to tell you any thing which occurs to their minds upon this head. And if &s;uch an occa&s;ion &s;hould lead them to touch upon &s;ome of the imperfections of your character and conduct, look upon it as a great token of their friend&s;hip, and take it not only patiently but thankfully. It does but ill be|come a Chri&s;tian at any time to re&s;ent reproofs and ad|monitions, and lea&s;t of all does it become him when the rebukes of his heavenly Father are upon him: he ought rather to &s;eek admonitions at &s;uch a time as this, and voluntarily to offer his wounds to be &s;earched by a faithful and &s;kilful hand.</P>
<P N="7">&sect; 7. And when, by one means or another, you have got a ray of light to direct you in the meaning and language of &s;uch di&s;pen&s;ations, take heed that you do not in any degree, "harden your&s;elf again&s;t God, and walk contrary to him Lev. 26, 27." Ob&s;tinate reluctance to the apprehended de&s;ign of any providential &s;troke is inexpre&s;&s;ibly provoking to him. Set your&s;elf therefore to an immediate reformation of whatever you di&s;cover ami&s;s; and labour to learn the general le&s;&s;ons of great|er &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to God's will, of a more calm indifference to the world, and of a clo&s;er attachment to divine con|ver&s;e, and to the views of an approaching invi&s;ible &s;tate. And whatever particular proportion or corre&s;|pondence you may ob&s;erve between this or that cir|cum&s;tance in your affliction and your former tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions, be e&s;pecially careful to act according to that more peculiar and expre&s;s voice of the rod. Then you may perhaps have &s;peedy and remarkable rea&s;on to &s;ay, that <Q>it hath been good for you, that you have been af|flicted P&s;. 119, 71;</Q> and, with a multitude of others, may learn to number the times of your &s;harpe&s;t trials, among the &s;weete&s;t and the mo&s;t exalted moments of your life. For this purpo&s;e, let prayer be your frequent employment; and let &s;uch &s;entiments as the&s;e, if not in the very &s;ame terms, be often and affectionately poured out before God.</P>

<P>O THOU &s;upreme, yet all righteous and gracious Governor of the whole univer&s;e!

<P>But &s;hall I &s;peak unto thee only as my Judge? O Lord, thou ha&s;t taught me a tender name: thou con|de&s;cende&s;t

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">&sect; 1. IF by divine grace, you have been <Q>born again, not of corruptible &s;eed, but of incorruptible 1 Pet. 1, 23. even by that word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever,</Q> not only in the world, and in the church, but in particular &s;ouls in which it is &s;own; you will, <Q>as new-born babes, de&s;ire the &s;in|cere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby 1 Pet. 2, 2.</Q> And though, in the mo&s;t advanced &s;tate of religion on earth, we are but infants in compari&s;on of what we hope to be, when in the heavenly world we arrive <Q>unto a perfect man, unto the mea&s;ure of the &s;tature of the fullne&s;s of Chri&s;t Eph. 4, 13;</Q> yet, as we have &s;ome exerci&s;e of a &s;anctified rea&s;on, we &s;hall be &s;olicitous that we may be growing and thriving in|fants. And you, my reader, if <Q>&s;o be that you have ta&s;ted that the Lord is gracious 1 Pet. 2, 3.</Q> will, I doubt not, feel this &s;olicitude. I would therefore endeavour to a&s;&s;i&s;t you in making the inquiry, whether religion be on the advance in your &s;ouls. And here I &s;hall warn you again&s;t &s;ome fal&s;e marks of growth;
<PB N="245" REF="021060_0258_0FB20E145B092098">
and then &s;hall endeavour to lay down others on which you may depend as more &s;olid.&mdash;In this view, I would ob&s;erve, that you are not to mea&s;ure your growth in grace only, or chiefly, by your advances in knowledge, or in zeal, or any other pa&s;&s;ionate impre&s;&s;ion of the mind; no, nor by the fervor of devotion alone; but by the habitual determination of the will for God, and by your prevailing di&s;po&s;ition to obey his commands, to &s;ubmit to his di&s;po&s;als, and to &s;ub&s;erve his &s;chemes in the world.</P>
<P N="2">&sect; 2. It mu&s;t be allowed, that knowledge and affec|tion in religion are indeed de&s;irable. Without &s;ome degree of the former, religion cannot be rational; and it is very rea&s;onable to believe, that without &s;ome de|gree of the latter it cannot be &s;incere, in creatures who&s;e natures are con&s;tituted like ours. Yet there may be a great deal of &s;peculative knowledge, and a great deal of rapturous affection, where there is no true religion at all; and therefore much more, where there is no ad|vanced &s;tate in it.&mdash;The exerci&s;e of our rational facul|ties upon the evidences of divine revelation, and upon the declaration of it as continued in &s;cripture, may fur|ni&s;h a very wicked man with a well dige&s;ted body of orthodox divinity in his head, when not one &s;ingle doctrine of it has ever reached his heart. An eloquent de&s;cription of the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, of the &s;olemni|ties of judgment, of the joys of the ble&s;&s;ed, and the mi|&s;eries of the damned, might move the brea&s;t even of a man who did not firmly believe them; as we often find our&s;elves &s;trongly moved by well-wrought narrations, or di&s;cour&s;es, which, at the &s;ame time, we know to have their foundation in fiction. Natural con&s;titution, or &s;uch accidental cau&s;es as are, &s;ome of them, too low to be here mentioned, may &s;upply the eyes with a flood of tears, which may di&s;charge it&s;elf plenteou&s;ly upon almo&s;t any occa&s;ion that &s;hall fir&s;t ari&s;e. And a proud impatience of contradiction, directly oppo&s;ite as it is to the gentle &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity, may make a man's blood boil when he hears the notions he has entertained, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e which he has openly and vigorou&s;ly e&s;pou&s;ed, di&s;puted and oppo&s;ed. This may po&s;&s;ibly lead him, in terms of &s;trong indignation, to pour out his
<PB N="246" REF="021060_0259_0FB20E15E66C9028">
zeal and his rage before God in a fond conceit, that, as the God of truth, he is the patron of tho&s;e favourite doctrines, by who&s;e fair appearances perhaps he him|&s;elf is mi&s;led&mdash;And if the&s;e &s;peculative refinements, or the&s;e affectionate &s;allies of the mind, be con&s;i&s;tent with a total ab&s;ence of true religion, they are much more ap|parently con&s;i&s;tent with a very low e&s;tate of it. I would de&s;ire to lead you, my friend, into &s;ublimer notions and ju&s;ter marks; and refer you to other practical writers, and, above all, to the book of God, to prove how ma|terial they are. I would therefore intreat you to bring your own heart to an&s;wer, as in the pre&s;ence of God, to &s;uch inquiries as the&s;e:</P>
<P N="3">&sect; 3. Do you find <Q>divine love, on the whole, ad|vancing in your &s;oul?</Q>&mdash;Do you feel your&s;elf more and more &s;en&s;ible of the pre&s;ence of God? and does that &s;en&s;e grew more delightful to you than it formerly was? Can you, even when your natural &s;pirits are weak and low, and you are not in any frame for the ardors and ec&s;tacies of devotion, neverthele&s;s find a plea&s;ing re&s;t, a calm repo&s;e of heart, in the thought that God is near you, and that he &s;ees the &s;ecret &s;entiments of your &s;oul, while you are, as it were labouring up the hill, and ca&s;ting a longing eye towards him, though you cannot &s;ay you enjoy any &s;en&s;ible communications from him? Is it agreeable to you to open your heart to his in&s;pec|tion and regard? to pre&s;ent it to him laid bare of every di&s;gui&s;e, and to &s;ay with David, <Q>Thou, Lord, know|e&s;t thy &s;ervant 2 Sam. 7, 20?</Q> Do you find a growing e&s;teem and approbation of that &s;acred law of God, which is the tran&s;cript of his moral perfections? Do you in|wardly <Q>e&s;teem all his precepts concerning all things to be right P&s;al. 119, 128?</Q> Do you di&s;cern, not on|ly the nece&s;&s;ity, but the rea&s;onablene&s;s, the beauty the plea&s;ure, of obedience; and feel a growing &s;corn and contempt for tho&s;e things which may be offered as the price of your innocence, and would tempt you to &s;acri|fice or to hazard your intere&s;t in the divine favour and friend&s;hip? Do you not find an ingenuous de&s;ire to plea&s;e God, not only becau&s;e he is &s;o powerful, and has &s;o many good and &s;o many evil things entirely at his command, but from a veneration of his mo&s;t amiable

nature and character; and do you find your heart habi|tually reconciled to a mo&s;t humble &s;ubjection, both to his commanding and to his di&s;po&s;ing will? Do you per|ceive that your own will is now more ready and di&s;po&s;|ed in every circum&s;tance, to bear the yoke, and to &s;ub|mit to the divine determination, whatever he appoints to be borne or forborne? Can you <Q>in patience po&s;&s;e&s;s your &s;oul Luke 21, 19?</Q> Can you maintain a more &s;teady calmne&s;s and &s;erenity when God is &s;triking at your deare&s;t enjoyments in this world, and acting mo&s;t directly contrary to your pre&s;ent intere&s;ts, to your na|tural pa&s;&s;ions and de&s;ires? If you can, it is a mo&s;t certain and noble &s;ign that grace is grown up in you to a very vigourous &s;tate.</P>
<P N="4">&sect; 4. Examine al&s;o, "what effections you find in your heart towards tho&s;e who are round about you, and to|wards the re&s;t of mankind in general."&mdash;Do you find your heart overflow with undi&s;&s;embled and unre&s;trained benevolence? Are you more &s;en&s;ible than you once were of tho&s;e many endearing bonds which unite all men, and e&s;pecially all Chri&s;tians, into one community; which make them brethren and fellow-citizens? Do all the un|friendly pa&s;&s;ions die and wither in your &s;oul, while the kind &s;ocial affections grow and &s;trengthen? And though &s;elf-love was never the reigning pa&s;&s;ion &s;ince you be|came a true Chri&s;tian, yet as &s;ome remainders of it are &s;till too ready to work inwardly, and to &s;how them&s;elves, e&s;pecially as &s;udden occa&s;ions ari&s;e, do you perceive that you get ground of them? Do you think of your&s;elf only as one of a great number, who&s;e particular intere&s;ts and concerns are of little importance when compared with tho&s;e of the community, and ought by all means, on all occa&s;ions, to be &s;acrificed to them?</P>
<P N="5">&sect; 5. Reflect e&s;pecially "on the temper of your mind towards tho&s;e whom an un&s;anctified heart might be rea|dy to imagine it had &s;ome ju&s;t excu&s;e for excepting out of the li&s;t of tho&s;e it loves, and towards whom you are ready to feel a &s;ecret aver&s;ion, or at lea&s;t an alienation from them."&mdash;How does your mind &s;tand affected to|wards tho&s;e who differ from you in their religious &s;en|timents and practices? I do not &s;ay that Chri&s;tian chari|ty will require you to think every error harmle&s;s. It

argues no want of love to a friend in &s;ome ca&s;es to fear lea&s;t his di&s;order &s;hould prove more fatal than he &s;eems to imagine; nay, &s;ometimes the very tenderne&s;s of friend&s;hip may increa&s;e that apprehen&s;ion. But to hate per&s;ons becau&s;e we think they are mi&s;taken, and to ag|gravate every difference in judgment or practice, into a fatal and damnable error, that de&s;troys all Chri&s;tian communion and love, is a &s;ymptom generally much wor&s;e than the evil it condemns. Do you love the image of Chri&s;t in a per&s;on who thinks him&s;elf obliged in con|&s;cience to profe&s;s and wor&s;hip in a manner different from your&s;elf? Nay farther, can you love and honour that which is truly amiable and excellent in tho&s;e in whom much is defective: in tho&s;e in whom there is a mixture of bigotry and narrowne&s;s of &s;pirit, which may lead them perhaps to &s;light, or even to cen&s;ure, you? Can you love them as the di&s;ciples and &s;ervants of Chri&s;t, who, through a mi&s;taken zeal, may be ready to <Q>ca&s;t out your name as evil Luke 6, 22.</Q> to warn others again&s;t you as a dangerous per&s;on? This is none of the lea&s;t triumphs of charity, nor any de&s;picable evidence of an advance in religion.</P>
<P N="6">&sect; 6. And, on this head, reflect farther, <Q>how can you bear injuries?</Q>&mdash;There is a certain hardne&s;s of &s;oul in this re&s;pect, which argues a confirmed &s;tate in piety and virtue. Does every thing of this kind hurry and ruffle you, &s;o as to put you on contrivances how you may recompen&s;e, or, at lea&s;t, how you may di&s;grace and expo&s;e him who has done you the wrong? or can you &s;tand the &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">k calmly, and ea&s;ily divert your mind to other objects, only (when you recollect the&s;e things) pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ying and praying for tho&s;e who, with the wor&s;t tempers and views, are a&s;&s;aulting you?

<P N="7">&sect; 7. Examine farther "with regard to the other evils and calamities of life, and even with regard, to its un|certainties, how can you bear them?"&mdash;Do you find your &s;oul is in this re&s;pect gathering &s;trength? Have you fewer foreboding fears and di&s;quieting alarms than you once had as to what may happen in life? Can you tru&s;t the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God to order your af|fairs for you with more complacency and chearfulne&s;s than formerly? Do you find you are unable to unite your thoughts more in &s;urveying pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, that you may collect immediate duty from them, though you know not what God will next appoint or call you to? And when you feel the &s;mart of affliction, do you make a le&s;s matter of it? can you transfer your heart more ea&s;ily to heavenly and divine objects, without an anxi|ous &s;olicitude, whether this or that burthen be remov|ed, &s;o it may be but &s;anctified to promote your commu|nion with God; and your ripene&s;s for glory?</P>
<P N="8">&sect; 8. Examine al&s;o, "whether you advance in humi|lity."&mdash;This is a &s;ilent, but mo&s;t excellent grace; and they who are mo&s;t eminent in it, are deare&s;t to God, and mo&s;t fit for the communications of his pre&s;ence to them. Do you then feel your mind more emptied of proud and haughty imaginations; not prone &s;o much to look back upon pa&s;t &s;ervices which it has performed, as forward to tho&s;e which are yet before you, and inward upon the remaining imperfections of your heart? Do you more tenderly ob&s;erve your daily &s;lips and mi&s;carriages, and find your&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to mourn over tho&s;e things before the Lord that once pa&s;&s;ed with you as &s;light mat|ters; though when you come to &s;urvey them as in the pre&s;ence of God, you find they were not wholly invo|luntary, or free from guilt?

<P N="9">&sect; 9. But there is another great branch and effect of Chri&s;tian humility, which it would be an unpardonable negligence to omit. Let me, therefore, farther enquire, Are you more frequently renewing your application, your &s;incere, &s;teady, determinate application, to the righteou&s;ne&s;s and blood of Chri&s;t, as being &s;en&s;ible how unworthy you are to appear before God otherwi&s;e than in him? And do the remaining corruptions of your heart humble you before him, though the di&s;orders of your life are in a great mea&s;ure cured? Are you more earne&s;t to obtain the quickening influences of the Holy Spirit? and have you &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of your own weakne&s;s, as to engage you to depend in all the duties you perform up|on the communications of his grace to <Q>help your in|firmities Rom. 8, 26?</Q> Can you, at the clo&s;e of your mo&s;t religious, exemplary, and u&s;eful days, blu&s;h before God for the deficiencies of them, while others perhaps may be ready to admire and extol your conduct? And while you give the glory of all that has been right to him from whom the &s;trength and grace has been derived, are you coming to the blood of &s;prinkling to free you from the guilt which mingles it&s;elf even with the be&s;t of your &s;ervices? Do you learn to receive the bounties of Providence, not only with thankfulne&s;s as coming from God, but with a mixture of &s;hame and confu&s;ion too, un|der a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that you do not de&s;erve them, and are continually forfeiting them? And do you ju&s;tify Providence in your afflictions and di&s;appointments, even while many are flouri&s;hing around you in the full bloom of pro&s;perity, who&s;e offences have been more vi&s;ible at lea&s;t, and more notorious than yours?</P>

Do you feel in your brea&s;t that you are more frequently "devi&s;ing liberal things I&s;a. 32." and ready to weave your own advantage or plea&s;ure that you may accom|pli&s;h them? Do you find your imagination teeming (as it were) with conceptions and &s;chemes for the ad|vancement of the cau&s;e and intere&s;t of Chri&s;t in the world, for the propogation of his go&s;pel, and for the happine&s;s of your fellow-creatures?

And not to enlarge on this copious head, reflect once more, how your affections &s;tand with regard to this world and another?"&mdash;Are you more deeply and practically convinced of the vanity of the&s;e <Q>things which are &s;een and are temporal 2 Cor. 4, 18?</Q> Do you perceive your expectations from them, and your at|tachments to them, to dimini&s;h? You are willing to &s;tay in this world as long as your Father plea&s;es, and it is right and well; but do you find your bonds &s;o loo&s;ened to it, that you are willing, heartily willing, to leave it at the &s;horte&s;t warning; &s;o that if God &s;hould &s;ee fit to &s;ummon you away on a &s;udden, though it &s;hould be in the mid&s;t of your enjoyments, pur&s;uits, expectations, and hopes, you would cordially con&s;ent to that remove; without &s;aying, Lord, let me &s;tay a little while longer to enjoy this or that agreeable entertainment, to fini&s;h this or that &s;cheme? Can you think with an habitual calmne&s;s, and hearty approbation, if &s;uch be the divine plea&s;ure, of walking no more when you lie down on your bed, of returning home no more when you go out of your hou&s;e?

<P N="1">&sect; 1. I WOULD now &s;uppo&s;e my reader to find, on an examination of his &s;piritual &s;tate, that he is growing in grace. And if you de&s;ire that this growth may at once be acknowledged and promoted, let me call your &s;oul to that more affectionate exerci&s;e of love to God, and joy in him, which &s;uits, and &s;trengthens, and exalts, the character of the advanced Chri&s;tian; and which I be&s;eech you to regard, not only as your privi|lege, but as your duty too. Love is the mo&s;t &s;ublime generous principle of all true and acceptable obedience; and with love, when &s;o wi&s;ely and happily fixed, when &s;o certainly returned, joy, proportionable joy, mu&s;t na|turally be connected. It may ju&s;tly grieve a man that enters into the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity to &s;ee how low a life the generality even of &s;incere Chri&s;tians commonly live in this re&s;pect. <Q>Rejoice then in the Lord, ye righteous, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holine&s;s P&s;al. 97, 12.</Q> and of all tho&s;e other perfecti|ons and glories which are included in that maje&s;tic, that wonderful, that delightful, name, THE LORD THY GOD! Spend not your &s;acred moments merely in con|fe&s;&s;ion, or in petition, though each mu&s;t have their dai|ly &s;hare: but give a part, a con&s;iderable part, to the cele&s;tial and angelic work of prai&s;e. Yea labour to carry about with you continually an heart overflowing with &s;uch &s;entiments, warmed and inflamed with &s;uch affections.</P>

Come, my Chri&s;tian friend and brother, come and &s;urvey with me the goodne&s;s of our heavenly Father. And oh that he would give me &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of it, that I might repre&s;ent it in a &s;uitable manner; that "while I am mu&s;ing the fire may burn" in my own

<P N="3">&sect; 3. Have you not rea&s;on to adopt the words of David, and &s;ay, <Q>How many are thy gracious thoughts unto me, O Lord! how great is the &s;um of them! When I would count them, they are more in number than the &s;and P&s;. 139, 17.18.</Q> You indeed know where to begin the &s;urvey; for the favours of God to you began with your being. Commemorate it there|fore with a grateful heart, that the, <Q>eyes which &s;aw your &s;ub&s;tance, being yet imperfect,</Q> beheld you with a friendly care, "when you were made in &s;ecret," and have watched over you ever &s;ince; and that <Q>the hand, which drew the plan of your members, when as yet there was none of them P&s;. 139, 15, 16,</Q> not only fa&s;hioned them at fir&s;t, but from that time has been concerned in keeping all your bones, &s;o that not <Q>one of them is broken P&s;. 34, 20; and that indeed it is to this you owe it that you live.</Q> Look back up|on the path you have trod, from the day that God brought you out of the womb, and &s;ay, whether you do not, as it were, &s;ee all the rod thick &s;et with the marks and memorials of the divine goodne&s;s. Recollect the places where you have lived, and the per&s;ons with whom you have mo&s;t intimately conver&s;ed; and call to mind the mercies you have received in tho&s;e places, and from tho&s;e per&s;ons, as the in&s;truments of the divine care and goodne&s;s. Recollect the difficulties and dangers with which you have been &s;urrounded; and reflect attentive|ly on what God hath done to defend you from them, or to carry you through them. Think how often there has been "but a &s;tep between you and death;" and how &s;uddenly God hath &s;ometimes interpo&s;ed to &s;et you in &s;afety, even before you apprehended your danger. Think of tho&s;e chambers of illne&s;s in which you have been confined, and from whence perhaps you once thought you &s;hould go forth no more; but &s;aid, (with
<PB N="256" REF="021060_0269_0FB20E2A486A7AE0">
Hezekiah,) <Q>In the cutting off of your days I &s;hall go to the gates of the grave; I am deprived of the re&s;idue of my years I&s;a. 38, 10.</Q> God has, it may be, &s;ince that time, added many years to your life; and you know not how many may be in re&s;erve, or how much u&s;efulne&s;s and happine&s;s may attend each. Sur|vey your circum&s;tances in relative life; how many kind friends are &s;urrounding you daily, and &s;tudying how they may contribute to your comfort. Reflect on tho&s;e remarkable circum&s;tances in providence, which occa&s;i|oned the knitting of &s;ome bonds of this kind, which, next to tho&s;e which join your &s;oul to God, you number among the happie&s;t. And forget not, in how many in&s;tances, when the&s;e dear lives have been threatened, lives perhaps more &s;en&s;ibly dear than your own, God hath given them back from the borders of the grave, and &s;o added new endearments ari&s;ing from that tender circum&s;tance to all your after conver&s;e with them. Nor forget, in how gracious a manner he hath &s;upported &s;ome others in their la&s;t moments, and enabled them to live behind a &s;weet odour of piety, which hath embalm|ed their memories revived you when ready to faint un|der the &s;orrows of the fir&s;t &s;eparation, and, on the whole, made even the recollection of their death de|lightful.</P>
<P N="4">&sect; 4. But it is more than time that I lead on your thoughts to the many &s;piritual mercies which God hath be&s;towed upon you, Look back, as it were, to the <Q>rock from whence you were hewn, and to the hole of the pit from whence you were digged I&s;a. 51, 1.</Q> Reflect &s;eriou&s;ly on the &s;tate wherein divine grace found you: under how much guilt, under how much pollu|tion! in what danger, in what ruin! Think what was, and, oh, think with yet deeper reflection, what would have been the ca&s;e! The eye of God, which penetrates into eternity, &s;aw that your mind, amu&s;ed with the trifles of pre&s;ent time and &s;en&s;ual gratification, was ut|terly ignorant and regardle&s;s of it; it &s;aw you on the borders of eternity, and pitied you; &s;aw that you would in a little time have been &s;uch a helple&s;s wretched crea|ture, as the &s;inner that is ju&s;t now dead, and has, to his in|finite &s;urpri&s;e and everla&s;ting terror, met his unexpected

doom, and would, like him, &s;tand thunder-&s;truck in a|&s;toni&s;hment and de&s;pair. This God &s;aw, and he pitied you; and being merciful to you, he provided in the coun&s;els of his eternal love and grace, a Redeemer for you, and purcha&s;ed you to him&s;elf with the blood of his Son; a price, which, if you will pau&s;e upon it, and think &s;eriou&s;ly what it was, mu&s;t &s;urely affect you to &s;uch a degree as to make you fall down before God in wonder and &s;hame, to think it &s;hould ever have been given for you. To accompli&s;h the&s;e ble&s;t purpo&s;es, he &s;ent his grace into your heart; &s;o that, though <Q>you were once darkne&s;s, you are now light in the Lord Eph. 5, 8.</Q> He made that happy change which you now feel in your &s;oul, and by his Holy Spirit which is given to you, he &s;hed abroad that principle of love Rom. 5, 5, which is enkindled by this review, and now flames with greater ardor than before. Thus far he hath &s;upported you in your Chri&s;tian cour&s;e; and, <Q>having obtained help from him, it is that you continue even to this day Acts 26, 22.</Q> He hath not only ble&s;&s;ed you, but made you a ble&s;&s;ing Gen. 12, 2: and though you have not been &s;o u&s;eful as that holy genero&s;ity of heart, which he has excited, would have engaged you to de&s;ire, yet &s;ome good you have done in the &s;tation in which he has fixed you. Some of your brethren of mankind has been re|lieved, perhaps, too, &s;ome thoughtle&s;s creature reclaimed to virtue and happine&s;s, by his ble&s;&s;ing on our endea|vours. Some in the way to heaven are prai&s;ing God for you; and &s;ome, perhaps, already there are long|ing for your arrival, that they may thank you in no|bler and more expre&s;&s;ive forms for benefits, the im|portance of which they now &s;ufficiently under&s;tand, though while here they could never conceive it.</P>
<P N="5">&sect; 5. Chri&s;tian, look round on the numberle&s;s ble&s;&s;|ings of one kind and of another with which you are al|ready encompa&s;&s;ed; and advance your pro&s;pect &s;till farther to what faith yet di&s;covers within the veil. Think of tho&s;e now unknown tran&s;ports with which thou &s;halt drop every burthen in the grave, and thine immortal &s;pirit &s;hall mount, light and joyful, holy and happy, to God, its original, its &s;upport, and its hope to God; the &s;ource of being, of holine&s;s, and of plea&s;ure;
<PB N="258" REF="021060_0271_0FB20E30171BB5E0">
to Je&s;us, through whom all the&s;e mercies are derived to thee, and who will appoint thee a throne near his own, to be for ever the &s;pectator and partaker of his glory. Think of the rapture with which thou &s;halt attend his triumph in the re&s;urrection day, and receive this poor mouldering corruptible body, transformed into his glo|rious image; and then think, "the&s;e hopes are not mine alone, but the hopes of thou&s;ands and millions. Multi|tudes, whom I number among the deare&s;t of my friends upon earth, are rejoicing with me in the&s;e apprehen|&s;ions and views: and God gives me &s;ometimes to &s;ee the &s;miles on their cheeks, the &s;weet humble hope that &s;par|kles in their eyes, and &s;hines through the tears of tender gratitude; and to hear that little of their inward com|placency and joy which language can expre&s;s. Yea, and multitudes more, who were once equally dear to me with the&s;e, though I have laid them in the grave, and wept over their du&s;t, are living to God, living in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of inconceivable delights, and drinking large draughts of the water of life, which flows in perpetual &s;treams at his right hand."</P>
<P N="6">&sect; 6. O Chri&s;tian, thou art &s;till intimately united and allied to them. Death cannot break a friend&s;hip thus cemented; and it ought not to render thee in&s;en&s;ible of the happine&s;s of tho&s;e friends for who&s;e memory thou retaine&s;t &s;o ju&s;t an honour. They live to God, as his &s;er|vants; they "&s;erve him, and &s;ee his face Rev. 22, 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">4;" and they make but a &s;mall part of that glorious a&s;&s;em|bly. Millions equally worthy of thine e&s;teem and af|fections with them&s;elves inhabit tho&s;e bli&s;sful regions: and wilt thou not rejoice in their joy? and wilt thou not adore that everla&s;ting &s;pring of holine&s;s and happine&s;s from whence each of the&s;e &s;treams is derived? Yea, I will add, while the ble&s;&s;ed angels are &s;o kindly regard|ing us, while they are mini&s;tering to thee, O Chri&s;tian, and bearing thee in their arms, <Q>as an heir of &s;alvation Heb. 1, 14,</Q> wilt thou not rejoice in their felicity too; and wilt thou not adore that God, who gives them all the &s;uperior glory of their more exalted nature, and gives them a heaven, which fills them with ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, even while they &s;eem to withdraw from it that they may attend on thee?</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="259" REF="021060_0272_0FB20E3136C823B0">&sect; 7. This, and infinitely more than this, the ble&s;&s;ed God is, and was, and &s;hall ever be. The felicities of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirits that &s;urround his throne, and thy felicities, O Chri&s;tian, are immortal.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX. The CHRISTIAN rejoicing in the Views of Death and Judgment.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Death and Judgment are near; but the Chri&s;tian has rea|&s;on to welcome both, &sect; <HI>1.</HI> Yet nature recoils from the &s;o|lemnity of them, &sect; <HI>2.</HI> An attempt to reconcile the mind, <HI>[I.]</HI> To the pro&s;pect of death, &sect; <HI>3.</HI> from the con&s;ideration, <HI>(1.)</HI> Of the many evils that &s;urround us in that mortal life, &sect; <HI>4. (2.)</HI> Of the remainder of &s;in which we feel within us, <HI>5.</HI> And, <HI>(3.)</HI> Of the happine&s;s which is im|mediately to &s;ucceed death, &sect; <HI>6, 7.</HI> All which might make the Chri&s;tian willing to die, in the mo&s;t agreeable circum|&s;tances of human life, <HI>8. [II.]</HI> The Chri&s;tian has rea&s;on to rejoice in the pro&s;pect of judgment, &sect; <HI>9.</HI> Since, however awful it be, Chri&s;t will then come to vindicate his honour, to di&s;play his glory, and to triumph over his enemies, &sect; <HI>10.</HI> As al&s;o to complete the happine&s;s of every believer, &sect; <HI>11.</HI> and of the whole church, &sect; <HI>12. 13.</HI> The meditation of a Chri&s;tian, who&s;e heart is warm with the&s;e pro&s;pects.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">&sect; 1. WHEN the vi&s;ions of the Lord were clo&s;ing upon John, the beloved di&s;ciple in the i&s;|land of Patmos, it is ob&s;ervable, that he who gave him that revelation, even Je&s;us, the faithful and true witne&s;s concludes with tho&s;e lively and important words: <Q>He who te&s;tifieth the&s;e things, &s;aith, Surely I come quick|ly:</Q> and John an&s;wers, with the greate&s;t readine&s;s and plea&s;ure, <Q>Amen, even &s;o come, Lord Je&s;us Rev. 22, 20.</Q> Come as thou ha&s;t &s;aid, &s;urely, and quick|ly!&mdash;And remember, O Chri&s;tian, whoever you are, now reading the&s;e words, your divine Lord &s;peaks in the &s;ame language to you: "Behold I come quickly." Yes, very quickly will he come by death, to turn the key, to open the door of the grave for thine admittance thither, and to lead thee through it into the now un|known regions of the invi&s;ible world. Nor is it long
<PB N="275" REF="021060_0288_0FB20E52994540E8">
before the judge, who <Q>&s;tandeth, at the door James 5, 9.</Q> will appear al&s;o to the univer&s;al judgment: and though perhaps not only &s;cores but hundreds of years may lie between that period and the pre&s;ent moment, yet it is but a very &s;mall point of time to him, who views at once all the unmea&s;urable ages of a pa&s;t and future eternity. <Q>A thou&s;and years are with him but as one day, and one day as a thou&s;and years 2 Pet. 3, 8.</Q> In both the&s;e &s;en&s;es then does he come quickly; and I tru&s;t you can an&s;wer, with a glad <HI>Amen,</HI> that the warning is not terrible or unplea&s;ant to your ears, but rather that his coming, his certain, his &s;peedy coming, is the object of your delightful hope, and of your long expectation.</P>
<P N="2">&sect; 2. I am &s;ure it is rea&s;onable it &s;hould be &s;o; and yet perhaps Nature, fond of life, and unwilling to part with a long known abode, to enter on a &s;tate to which it is entirely a &s;tranger, may recoil from the thoughts of dying; or, &s;truck with the awful pomp of an expiring and di&s;&s;olving world, may look on the judgment-day with &s;ome mixture of terror. And therefore my dear brother in the Lord, (for as &s;uch I can now e&s;tem you,) I would rea&s;on with you a little on this head, and would intreat you to look more attentively on this &s;olemn ob|ject, which will, I tru&s;t, grow le&s;s di&s;agreeable to you, as it is more familiarly viewed. Nay, I hope, that in|&s;tead of &s;tarting back from it, you will rather &s;pring forward towards it with joy and delight.</P>
<P N="3">&sect; 3. Think, O Chri&s;tian, when Chri&s;t comes to call you away by death, he comes&mdash;to &s;et you at liberty from your pre&s;ent &s;orrows,&mdash;to deliver you from your &s;trug|gles with remaining corruption,&mdash;and to receive you to dwell with him&s;elf in complete holine&s;s and joy. You &s;hall <Q>be ab&s;ent from the body, and be pre&s;ent with the Lord 2 Cor. 5, 8.</Q></P>
<P N="4">&sect; 4. He will indeed call you away from this world! But, oh, what is this world that you &s;hould be fond of it, and cling to it with &s;o much eagerne&s;s? How low are all tho&s;e enjoyments that are peculiar to it; and how many its vexations, its &s;nares, and its &s;orrows? Review your pilgrimage thus far; and though you mu&s;t ack|nowledge, that <Q>goodne&s;s and mercy have followed
<PB N="276" REF="021060_0289_0FB20E56617C0D50">
you all the days of your life P&s;al. 23, 6.</Q> yet has not that very mercy it&s;elf planted &s;ome thorns in your paths, and given you &s;ome wi&s;e and nece&s;&s;ary, yet pain|ful, intimations, that "this is not your re&s;t Mic. 2, 10?" Review the monuments of your withered joys, of your bla&s;ted hopes; if there be yet any monuments of them remaining, more than a mournful remembrance they have left behind in your afflicted heart. Look upon the graves that have &s;wallowed up many of your deare&s;t and mo&s;t amiable friends, perhaps in the very bloom of life, and in the greate&s;t intimacy of your conver&s;e with them; and reflect, that if you hold it out a few years more, death will renew its conque&s;ts at your ex|pence, and devour the mo&s;t precious of tho&s;e that yet &s;urvive. View the living as well as the dead; behold the &s;tate of human nature, under the many grievous marks of its apo&s;tacy from God; and &s;ay, whether a wi&s;e and good man would wi&s;h to continue always here.</P>
<P>Methinks, were I my&s;elf &s;ecure from being reached by any of the arrows that fly around me, I could not but mourn to &s;ee the wounds that are given by them, and to hear the groans of tho&s;e that are continually falling un|der them. The di&s;ea&s;es and calamities of mankind are &s;o many, and, which is mo&s;t grievous of all, the di&s;tem|pers of their minds are &s;o various and &s;o threatening, that the world appears almo&s;t like an ho&s;pital: and a man, who&s;e heart is tender, is ready to feel his &s;pirits broken, as he walks through it, and &s;urveys the &s;ad &s;cene; e&s;pecially when he &s;ees how little he can do for the recovery of tho&s;e whom he pities. Are you a Chri&s;|tian, and does it not pierce your heart to &s;ee how human nature is &s;unk in vice and in &s;hame? to &s;ee with what amazing in&s;olence &s;ome are making them&s;elves openly vile, and how the name of Chri&s;t is di&s;honoured by ma|ny too that call them&s;elves his people? to &s;ee the un|lawful deeds and filthy practices of them that live un|godly, and to behold, at the &s;ame time, the infirmities at lea&s;t, and irregularities, of tho&s;e concerning whom we have better hopes? and do you not wi&s;h to e&s;cape from &s;uch a world, where a righteous and compa&s;&s;ion|ate &s;oul mu&s;t be vexed from day to day by &s;o many &s;pec|tacles of &s;in and mi&s;ery 2 Pet. 2, 8?"</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="277" REF="021060_0290_0FB20E59061ACA38">&sect; 5. Yea, to come nearer home; do you not feel &s;omething within you which you long to quit, and which would imbitter even Paradi&s;e it&s;elf? &s;omething, which, were it to continue, would grieve and di&s;tre&s;s you even in the &s;ociety of the ble&s;&s;ed? Do you not feel a remainder of indwelling &s;in; the &s;ad con&s;equence of the original revolt of our nature from God? Are you not &s;truggling every day with &s;ome re&s;idue of corrup|tion, or at lea&s;t mourning on account of the weakne&s;s of your graces? Do you not often find your &s;pirits dull and languid when you would de&s;ire to rai&s;e them to the greate&s;t fervor in the &s;ervice of God? Do you not find your hearts too often in&s;en&s;ible of the riche&s;t in&s;tances of his love, and your hands feeble in his &s;ervice, even when "to will is pre&s;ent with you Rom. 7, 18?" Does not your life, in its be&s;t days and hours, appear a low, unprofitable thing, when compared with what you are &s;en&s;ible it ought to be, and with what you wi&s;h that it were? Are you not frequently, as it were, &s;tretching the pinions of the mind, and &s;aying, <Q>Oh that I had wings like a dove, that I might fly away and be at re&s;t P&s;. 55, 6?</Q></P>
<P N="6">&sect; 6. Should you not then rejoice in the thought that Je&s;us comes to deliver you from the&s;e complaints? That he comes to an&s;wer your wi&s;hes, and to fulfil the large&s;t de&s;ires of your hearts; tho&s;e de&s;ires that he him&s;elf has in&s;pired? That he comes to open upon you a world of purity and joy, of active, exalted, and unwearied &s;er|vices?</P>
<P N="7">&sect; 7. O Chri&s;tian, how often have you ca&s;t a longing eye towards tho&s;e happy &s;hores, and wi&s;hed to pa&s;s the &s;ea, the boi&s;terous, unplea&s;ant, dangerous &s;ea, that &s;eparates you from them? When your Lord has conde|&s;cended to make you a &s;hort vi&s;it in his ordinances on earth, how have you ble&s;t the time and the place, and pronounced it, amid&s;t any other di&s;advantage of &s;itu|ation, to be the very gate of heaven Gen. 28, 17? And is it &s;o delightful to behold this gate, and will it not be much more &s;o to enter into it? Is it &s;o delightful to re|ceive the vi&s;its of Je&s;us for an hour, and will it not be infinitely more &s;o to dwell with him for ever? "Lord," may you well &s;ay, <Q>when I dwell with thee, I &s;hall

Is it not enough that what is taken from a mortal life &s;hall be added to a glorious eternity; and that you &s;hall &s;pend tho&s;e days and years in the pre&s;ence and &s;ervice of Chri&s;t in heaven which you might otherwi&s;e have &s;pent with him and for him in the imperfect enjoyments and labours of earth?</P>

For with regard to his final appearance to judgment, our Lord &s;ays, Surely I come quickly, in the &s;en&s;e illu&s;trated before: and &s;o it will appear to us, if we compare this interval of time with the bli&s;sful eternity which is to &s;ucceed it; and probably if we compare it with tho&s;e ages which have already pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ince the &s;un began to mea&s;ure out to earth its days and its years.

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">&sect; 1. THUS, my dear reader, I have endeavoured to lead you through a variety of circum&s;tances; and tho&s;e not fancied and imaginary, but &s;uch as do indeed occur in the human and Chri&s;tian life. And I can truly and chearfully &s;ay, that I have marked out to you the path which I my&s;elf have trod, and in which it is my de&s;ire &s;till to go on. I have ventured my own everla&s;ting intere&s;ts on that foundation on which I have directed you to adventure yours. What I have recom|mended as the grand bu&s;ine&s;s of your life, I de&s;ire to make the bu&s;ine&s;s of my own; and the mo&s;t con&s;ider|able enjoyments which I expect or de&s;ire in the remain|ing days of my pilgrimage on earth, are &s;uch as I have directed you to &s;eek, and endeavoured to a&s;&s;i&s;t you in attaining. Such love to God, &s;uch con&s;tant activity in his &s;ervice, &s;uch plea&s;urable views of what lies beyond the grave, appear to me (God is my witne&s;s,) a felicity incomparable beyond any thing el&s;e which can offer it|&s;elf to our affection and pur&s;uit: and I would not for
<PB N="285" REF="021060_0298_0FB20E6B6312FD18">
ten thou&s;and worlds re&s;ign my &s;hare in them, or con&s;ent even to the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the delights which they afford, during the remainder of my abode here.</P>
<P N="2">&sect; 2. I would humbly hope, through the divine ble&s;&s;ing, that the hours you have &s;pent in the review of the&s;e plain things may have turned to &s;ome profitable account, and that in con&s;equence of what you have read, you have either been brought into the way of life and peace, or been induced to quicken your pace in it. Mo&s;t heartily &s;hould I rejoice in being further u&s;eful to you, and that even to the la&s;t. Now there is one &s;cene re|maining; a &s;cene through which you mu&s;t infallibly pa&s;s, which has &s;omething in it &s;o awful, that I cannot but attempt doing a little to a&s;&s;i&s;t you in it; I mean the dark valley of the &s;hadow of death. I would earne&s;tly wi&s;h, that, for the credit of your profe&s;&s;ion, the comfort of your own &s;oul, and the joy and edification of your &s;urviving friends, you might die not only &s;afely, but ho|nourably too: and therefore I would offer you a few parting advices. I am &s;en&s;ible indeed that Providence may determine the circum&s;tances of your death in &s;uch a manner as that you may have no opportunity of act|ing upon the hints I now give you. Some unexpected accident from without, or from within, may, as it were, whirl you to heaven before you are aware; and you may find your&s;elf &s;o &s;uddenly there, that it may &s;eem a tran&s;lation rather than a death. Or it is po&s;&s;ible the force of a di&s;temper may affect your under&s;tanding in &s;uch a manner that you may be quite in&s;en&s;ible of the circum&s;tances in which you are; and &s;o your di&s;&s;olution (though others may &s;ee it vi&s;ibly and certainly approach|ing, may be as great a &s;urpri&s;e to you as if you died in full health.</P>
<P N="3">&sect; 3. But as it is, on the whole, probable you may have a more &s;en&s;ible pa&s;&s;age out of time into eternity; and as much may, in various re&s;pects, depend on your dying behaviour, give me leave to propo&s;e &s;ome plain directions with relation to it, to be practi&s;ed, if God give you opportunity, and remind you of them. It may not be improper to look over the twenty-ninth chapter again, when you find the &s;ymptoms of any threatening di&s;order: and I the rather hope, that what
<PB N="286" REF="021060_0299_0FB20C2DE239E6E0">
I &s;ay may be u&s;eful to you, as methinks, I find my&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to addre&s;s you with &s;omething of that peculiar tenderne&s;s which we feel for a dying friend; to whom, as we expect that we &s;hall &s;peak to him no more, we &s;end out, as it were, all our hearts in every word.</P>
<P N="4">&sect; 4. I would advi&s;e then, in the fir&s;t place, "that, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, you would endeavour to get rid of all further care with regard to your temporal concerns, by &s;ettling them in time, in as rea&s;onable and Chri&s;tian a manner as you can." I could wi&s;h, there may be no|thing of that kind to hurry your mind when you are lea&s;t able to bear it, or to di&s;tre&s;s or divide tho&s;e who come after you. Do that which, in the pre&s;ence of God, you judge mo&s;t equitable, and which you verily believe will be mo&s;t plea&s;ing to him. Do it in as pru|dent and effectual a manner as you can: and then con&s;ider the world as a place you have quite done with, and its affairs as nothing farther to you, more than to one actually dead; unle&s;s as you may do any good to its inhabitants while yet you continue among them; and may, by any circum&s;tance in your la&s;t actions or words in life leave a ble&s;&s;ing behind you to tho&s;e who have been your friends and fellow-travellers, while you have been di&s;patching that journey through it, which you are now fini&s;hing.</P>
<P N="5">&sect; 5. That you may be the more at lei&s;ure, and the bet|ter prepared for this, "enter into &s;ome &s;erious review of your own &s;tate, and endeavour to put your &s;oul into as fit a po&s;ture as po&s;&s;ible, for your &s;olemn appearance before God." For a &s;olemn thing indeed it is to go into his immediate pre&s;ence! to &s;tand before him, not as a &s;upplicant at the throne of his grace, but at his bar as a &s;eperate &s;pirit, who&s;e time of probation is over, and who&s;e eternal &s;tate is to be immediately determined. Renew your humiliation before God for the imperfec|tions of your life, though it has in the main been devo|ted to his &s;ervice. Renew your application to the mer|cies of God, as promi&s;ed in the covenant of grace, and to the blood of Chri&s;t, as the ble&s;&s;ed channel in which they flow. Re&s;ign your&s;elf entirely to the divine di&s;po&s;al and conduct, as willing to &s;erve God, either in this world or the other, as he &s;hall &s;ee fit. And &s;en&s;ible of
<PB N="287" REF="021060_0300_0FB20C2F26B90E30">
your &s;infulne&s;s on the one hand, and of the divine wi&s;|dom and goodne&s;s on the other, &s;ummon up all the forti|tude of your &s;oul to bear, as well as you can, whatever his afflicting hand may further lay upon you, and to re|ceive the la&s;t &s;troke of it, as one who would obtain the mo&s;t entire &s;ubjection to the great and good Father of &s;pirits.</P>
<P N="6">&sect; 6. Whatever you &s;uffer, <Q>endeavour to &s;how your|&s;elf an example of patience." Let that amiable grace have its perfect work James 1, 4;</Q> and &s;ince it has &s;o little more to do, let it clo&s;e the &s;cene nobly. Let there not be a murmuring word; and that there may not, watch again&s;t every repining thought; and when you feel any thing of that kind ari&s;ing, look by faith up|on a dying Saviour, and a&s;k your own heart, "was not his cro&s;s much more painful than the bed on which I lie? Was not his &s;ituation among blood-thir&s;ty enemies infinitely more terrible than mine amid&s;t the tenderne&s;s and care of &s;o many affectionate friends? Did not the heavy load of my &s;ins pre&s;s him in a much more over|whelming manner than I am pre&s;&s;ed by the load of the&s;e afflictions? and yet he bore all "as a Lamb" that is brought "to the &s;laughter I&s;a. 53, 7." Let the re|membrance of his &s;ufferings be a means to &s;weeten your's: yea, let it cau&s;e you to rejoice, when you are called to bear the cro&s;s for a little while, before you wear the crown. Count it all joy that you have an op|portunity yet once more of honouring God by your pa|tience, which is now acting its la&s;t part, and will in a few days, perhaps in a few hours, be &s;uper&s;eded by com|plete everla&s;ting ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. And I am willing to hope, that in the&s;e views you will not only &s;uppre&s;s all pa&s;&s;i|onate complaints, but that your mouth will be filled with the prai&s;es of God? And that you will be &s;peaking to tho&s;e that are about you, not only of his ju&s;tice, but of his goodne&s;s too. So that you will be enabled to com|municate your inward joys in &s;uch a manner, as may be a lively and edifying comment upon tho&s;e words of the apo&s;tle, <Q>Tribulation worketh patience; and pati|ence, experience; and experience, hope; even a hope which maketh not a&s;hamed, while the love of God is &s;hed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Gho&s;t, which is given unto us Rom. 5, 3.4.5.</Q></P>
<P N="7"><PB N="288" REF="021060_0301_0FB20C3164BB2ED8">&sect; 7. And now, my dear friend, now is the time, when it is e&s;pecially expected from you that you bear an honourable te&s;timony to religion. Tell tho&s;e that are about you, as well as you can, (for you will never be able fully to expre&s;s it,) what comfort and &s;upport you have found in it. Tell them, how it has brightened the darke&s;t circum&s;tances of your life; tell them, how it now reconciles you to the near views of death. Your words will carry with them a peculiar weight at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on: there will be a kind of eloquence, even in the infirmities with which you are &s;truggling, while you give them utterance; and you will be heard with atten|tion, with tenderne&s;s, with credit. And therefore, when the time of your departure is at hand, with un|affected freedom breathe out your joy, if you then feel (as I hope you will) an holy joy and delight in G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> breathe out, however, your inward peace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of mind, if you be then peaceful and &s;erene: oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> mark it, and be encouraged to tread the &s;teps which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to &s;o happy an end.

<P N="8">&sect; 8. And, to inforce the conviction the more, "give a &s;olemn charge to tho&s;e that are about you, that they &s;pend their lives in the &s;ervice of God, and govern them&s;elves by the principles of real religion." You may remember, that Jo&s;hua and David, and other good men did &s;o, when they perceived that the days drew near in which they &s;hould die. And you know not how the admonitions of a dying friend, or (as it may be with re&s;pect to &s;ome,) of a dying parent, may impre&s;s tho&s;e who may have di&s;regarded what you and others may have &s;aid to them before. At lea&s;t, make the tri|al; and die labouring to glorify God, to &s;ave &s;ouls, and generou&s;ly to &s;ow the &s;eeds of goodne&s;s and happine&s;s in a world where you have no more harve&s;ts to reap. Per|haps they may &s;pring up in a plentiful crop when the clods of the valley are covering your body: but if not,
<PB N="289" REF="021060_0302_0FB20C32D9BDCC48">
God will approve it; and the angels that wait around your bed to receive your departing &s;oul will look upon each other with marks of approbation in their counte|nance, and own that this is to expire like a Chri&s;tian, and to make a glorious improvement of mortality.</P>
<P N="9">&sect; 9. And, in this la&s;t addre&s;s to your fellow-mortals, whoever they are that providence brings near you "be &s;ure that you tell how entirely and how chearfully your hopes and dependence in this &s;ea&s;on of the la&s;t extremi|ty are fixed, not upon your own merits and obedience, but on what the great Redeemer has done and &s;uffered for &s;inners." Let them &s;ee that you die, as it were, at the foot of the cro&s;s: nothing will be &s;o comfortable to your&s;elf, nothing &s;o edifying to them. Let the name of Je&s;us, therefore, be in your mouth, while you are able to &s;peak; and when you can &s;peak no longer, let it be in your heart, and endeavour that the la&s;t act of your &s;oul, while it continues in the body, may be an act of humble faith in Chri&s;t. <Q>Come unto God by him: enter into that which is within the veil, as with the blood of &s;prinkling, fre&s;h upon you.</Q> It is an awful thing for &s;uch a &s;inner (as you, my Chri&s;tian friend, with all the virtues the world may have admired, know your&s;elf to be) to &s;tand before that infinitely pure and holy Being, who has &s;een all your ways, and all your heart, and has a perfect knowledge of every mix|ture of imperfection, which has attended the be&s;t of your duties; but venture in that way, and you will find it both &s;afe and plea&s;ant.</P>
<P N="10">&sect; 10. Once more: "To give you comfort in a dy|ing hour, and to &s;upport your feeble &s;teps while you are travelling through this dark and painful way, take the word of God as a &s;taff in your hand." Let books and mortal friends, now do their la&s;t office for you. Call, if you can, &s;ome experienced Chri&s;tian, who has felt the power of the word of God upon his own heart; and let him bring the &s;cripture, and turn you to &s;ome of tho&s;e precious promi&s;es, which have been the food and re|joicing of his own &s;oul. It is with this view, that I may carry the good office I am now engaged in, as far as po&s;&s;ible. I &s;hall here give you a collection of a few &s;uch admirable &s;criptures, each of them infinitely <Q>more

valuable than thou&s;ands of gold and &s;ilver P&s;. 119, 27.</Q> And to convince you of the degree in which I e&s;teem them, I will take the freedom to add, that I de&s;ire they may (if God give an opportunity) be read over to me, as I lie on my dying bed, with &s;hort inter|vals between them, that I may pau&s;e upon each, and renew &s;omething of that delightful reli&s;h, which, I ble&s;s God, I have often found in them. May your &s;oul and mine be then compo&s;ed to a &s;acred &s;ilence (whatever be the commotion of animal nature) while the voice of God &s;peaks to us in language which he &s;poke to his &s;ervants of old, or in which he in&s;tructed them how they &s;hould &s;peak to him, in circum&s;tances of the great|e&s;t extremity!</P>

<P>O THOU &s;upreme Ruler of the vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible worlds! thou Sovereign of life and of death; of earth and of heaven! Ble&s;&s;ed be thy name, I have often been taught to &s;eek thee. And now once more do I pour out my &s;oul, my departing &s;oul, unto thee. Bow down thy gracious ear O God, and let my cry come before thee with acceptance!</P>
<P>The hour is come when thou wilt &s;eparate me from this world, with which I have been &s;o long and &s;o fami|liarly acquainted, and lead me to another as yet un|known. Enable me, I be&s;eech thee, to make the ex|change as becomes a child of Abraham, who being <Q>called of thee to receive an inheritance, obeyed, and went out, though he knew not particularly whither he went Heb. 11, 8.</Q> as becomes a child of God, who knows that, through &s;overeign grace, <Q>it is his Father's good plea&s;ure to give him the kingdom Luke 12, 32!</Q></P>
<P>I acknowledge, O Lord, the ju&s;tice of that &s;entence by which I am expiring; and own thy wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s in appointing my journey through this gloomy vale which is now before me. Help me to turn it into the happy occa&s;ion of honouring thee, and adorning my profe&s;&s;ion! and I will ble&s;s the pangs by which thou art glorified, when this mortal and &s;inful part of my nature is di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>Gracious Father, I would not quit this earth of thine, and this hou&s;e of clay in which I have &s;ojourned during my abode upon the face of it, without my grateful ac|knowledgments to thee, for all that abundant goodne&s;s which thou ha&s;t cau&s;ed to pa&s;s before me here Exo. 33, 19. With my dying breath I bear witne&s;s to thy faith|ful care. I have wanted no good thing P&s;al. 34, 10. I thank thee, O my God, that this guilty, forfeited, un|profitable

life, was &s;o long &s;pared: that it has been &s;till maintained by &s;uch a rich variety of thy bounty. I thank thee that thou ha&s;t made this beginning of my ex|i&s;tence &s;o plea&s;ant to me. I thank thee for the mercies of my days and nights, of my months and years, which are now come to their period: I thank thee for the mercies of my infancy, and for tho&s;e of my riper age; for all the agreeable friends which thou ha&s;t given me in this hou&s;e of my pilgrimage, the living and the dead; for all the help I have received from others, and for all the opportunities which thou ha&s;t given me of being helpful to the bodies or &s;ouls of my brethren of man|kind. Surely goodne&s;s and mercy have followed me all the days of my life P&s;al. 23, 6. and I have rea&s;on to ri&s;e a thankful gue&s;t from the various and plea&s;ant entertainments with which my table has been furni&s;hed by thee. Nor &s;hall I have rea&s;on to repine or to grieve, at quitting them: For, O my God, are thy bounties exhau&s;ted? I know that they are not. I will not wrong thy goodne&s;s and thy faithfulne&s;s &s;o much as to imagine, that becau&s;e I am going from this earth, I am going from happine&s;s. I adore thy mer|cy, that thou ha&s;t taught me to entertain nobler views through Je&s;us thy Son. I ble&s;s thee with all the powers of my nature, that I ever heard of his name, and of his death: and would fain exert a more vigorous act of thankful adoration than in this broken &s;tate I am capable of, while I am extolling thee for the riches of thy grace manife&s;ted in him; for his in&s;tructions and his example, for his blood and his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and for that ble&s;&s;ed Spirit of thine which thou ha&s;t given me, to turn my &s;in|ful heart unto thy&s;elf, and to bring me into the bonds of thy covenant; of that covenant, which is <Q>ordered in all things and &s;ure 2 Sam. 23, 5,</Q> and which this death, though now &s;eparating my &s;oul from my body, &s;hall never be able to di&s;&s;olve.</P>
<P>I ble&s;s thee, O Lord, that I am not dying in an unre|generate and impenitent &s;tate; but that thou did&s;t gra|ciou&s;ly awaken and convince me; that thou did&s;t renew and &s;anctify my heart, and did&s;t by thy good Spirit work in it an unfeigned faith, and real repentance, and the be|ginning of a divine life. I thank thee for mini&s;ters and
<PB N="294" REF="021060_0307_0FB20C4024D2F4C8">
ordinances; I thank thee for my &s;abbaths, and my &s;a|crament-days; for the weekly and monthly refre&s;hments which they gave me: I thank thee for the fruits of Canaan, which were &s;ent me in the wilderne&s;s, and are now &s;ent me on the brink of Jordan. I thank thee for thy ble&s;&s;ed word, and for tho&s;e exceeding rich and pre|cious promi&s;es of it, which now lie as a cordial warm at my heart in this chilling hour; promi&s;es of &s;upport in death, and of glory beyond it, and of the re&s;urrection of my body to everla&s;ting life. O my God, I firmly believe them all, great and wonderful as they are, and am <Q>waiting for the accompli&s;hment of them through Je&s;us Chri&s;t; in whom they are all yea and amen 3 Cor. 1, 20. Remember thy word unto thy &s;ervant on which thou ha&s;t cau&s;ed me to hope P&s;al. 119, 40!</Q> I covenanted with thee not for worldly enjoyments, which thy love taught me comparatively to de&s;pi&s;e; but for eternal life, as <Q>the gift of thy free grace through Je&s;us Chri&s;t my Lord Rom. 6, 23;</Q> and now permit me, in his name, to enter my humble claim to it! Permit me to con&s;ign this departing &s;pirit into thine hand; for <Q>thou ha&s;t redeemed it, O Lord God of truth P&s;al. 31, 5? I am thine &s;ave me P&s;al. 119, 94,</Q> and make me happy!</P>
<P>But may I indeed pre&s;ume to &s;ay, I am thine! O God, now I am &s;tanding on the borders of both worlds; now I view things as in the light of thy pre&s;ence and of eter|nity; how unworthy do I appear, that I &s;hould be taken to dwell with thy angels and &s;aints in glory! Alas, I have rea&s;on to look back with deep humiliation on a poor unprofitable &s;inful life, in which I have daily been de&s;erving to be ca&s;t into hell. But I have this one com|fortable reflection, that I have fled to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t; and I now renew my application to it. To think of ap|pearing before God in &s;uch an imperfect righteou&s;ne&s;s as my own, were then thou&s;and times wor&s;e than death. No, Lord! I come unto thee as a &s;inner; but as a &s;in|ner who has believed in thy Son for pardon and life: I fall down before thee as a guilty polluted wretch; but thou ha&s;t made him to be unto thy people for wi&s;dom and righteou&s;ne&s;s, for &s;anctification and redemption 1 Cor. 1, 30."

And <Q>I know in whom I have believed 2 Tim. 1, 12.</Q> The infernal lion may attempt to di&s;may me in this awful pa&s;&s;age: but I rejoice that I am in the hands of the good Shepherd John 10, 11.28; and I defy all my &s;piritual enemies, in a chearful dependence on his faithful care. I lift up my eyes and my heart to him, who <Q>was dead and is alive again; and behold he lives for ever more, and hath the keys of death, and of the un&s;een world Rev. 6, 18.</Q> Ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, I die by thine hand, and I fear no harm from the hand of a Saviour! I fear not that death which is allotted to me by the hand of my deare&s;t Lord, who him&s;elf died to make it &s;afe and happy. I come, Lord, I come, not only with a willing, but with a joyful con&s;ent. I thank thee that thou re|membere&s;t me for good; that thou art breaking my chains, and calling me to "the glorious liberty of the children of God Rom. 8, 21." I thank thee, that thou wilt no longer permit me to live at a di&s;tance from thine arms; but after this long ab&s;ence, wilt have me at home, at home for ever.</P>
<P>My feeble nature faints in the view of that glory, which is now dawning upon me; but thou knowe&s;t how, gracious Lord, to let it in upon my &s;oul by ju&s;t degrees, and to <Q>make thy &s;trength perfect in my weakne&s;s 2 Cor. 12, 9.</Q> Once more, for the la&s;t time, would I look down on this poor world, which I am going to quit, and breathe out my dying vows for its pro&s;peri|ty, and that of thy church in it. I have loved it, O Lord, as a living member of the body; and I love it to the la&s;t. I humbly be&s;eech thee, therefore, that thou wilt guard it, and purify it, and unite it more and more! Send down more of thy ble&s;&s;ed Spirit upon it, even the Spirit of wi&s;dom, of holine&s;s, and of love; till in due time <Q>the wilderne&s;s be turned into a garden of the Lord I&s;a. 51, 3. and all fle&s;h &s;hall &s;ee thy &s;alvation Luke 3, 6!</Q></P>
<P>And as for me, bear me, O my heavenly Father, on the wings of everla&s;ting love, to that peaceful, that

Let faith perform its la&s;t office in an honourable manner! Let my few re|maining moments on earth be &s;pent for thy glory; and &s;o let me a&s;cend, with love in my heart, and prai&s;e on my faultering tongue, to the world where love and prai&s;e &s;hall be complete!

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT was the amiable character of our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, that <HI>he went about doing good</HI> Acts 10, 38. This great motive which animated all his actions, brought him to the hou&s;e of his friend Lazarus at Bethany, and directed his behaviour there. Though it were a &s;ea&s;on of rece&s;s from public labour, our Lord brought the &s;entiments and the pious cares of a preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s into the parlour of a friend; and there his doctrine dropped as the rain, and di&s;tilled as the dew, on the little happy circle that were then &s;urrounding him. Mary, the &s;i&s;|ter of Lazarus, with great delight, made one among&s;t them; &s;he &s;et her&s;elf down at the feet of Je&s;us, in the po&s;ture of an humble di&s;ciple; and we have a great deal of rea&s;on to believe, that Martha his &s;i&s;ter, would glad|ly have been with her there; but dome&s;tic care pre&s;&s;ed hard upon her, and &s;he was cumbered with much &s;erv|ing, being perhaps too &s;olicitous to prepare a &s;umptu|ous entertainment for her heavenly Ma&s;ter, and the train that attended him. Happy are they that in a crowd of bu&s;ine&s;s, do not loo&s;e &s;omething of the &s;piritu|ality of their minds, and of the compo&s;ure and &s;weet|ne&s;s of their tempers! This good woman comes to our Lord with too impatient a complaint; in&s;inuating &s;ome little reflection, not only on Mary, but on him&s;elf too.
<PB N="298" REF="021060_0311_0FB20C4685204568">
<HI>Lord, do&s;t thou not care that my &s;i&s;ter hath left me to &s;erve alone? Bid her therefore that &s;he help me</HI> Luke 10, 40. Our Lord, willing to take all opportunities of &s;ugge&s;ting u&s;eful thoughts, an&s;wers her in the&s;e words, of which the text is a part,&mdash;Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things, but one thing is need|ful, and Mary has cho&s;en that good part, which &s;hall not be taken away from her. <HI>q. d.</HI> Alas, Martha! The concerns of the &s;oul are of &s;o much greater importance than tho&s;e of the body, that I cannot blame your &s;i&s;ter on this occa&s;ion: I rather recommend her to your imi|tation, and caution you, and all my other friends, to be much on your guard that, in the mid&s;t of your worldly cares, you do not lo&s;e the &s;ight of that which &s;o much better de&s;erves your attention.</P>
<P>I &s;hall con&s;ider the&s;e words, one thing is needful, as a kind of Aphori&s;m, or wi&s;e and weighty &s;entence, drop|ped from the mouth of our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, and evi|dently worthy of our mo&s;t &s;erious regard. In handling them I &s;hall,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Con&s;ider what we are to under&s;tand by the one thing here &s;poken of.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Shew you what is intended when it is repre&s;ented as the one thing needful</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. I will &s;hew how ju&s;tly it may be &s;o repre&s;ented or prove that it is indeed the one thing needful.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. Conclude with &s;ome reflections and application.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>My friends, the words which are now before us are, to this day, as true as they were &s;eventeen hundred years ago. Set your hearts to attend to them. Oh that you might, by divine grace, be awakened to hear them with a due regard, and might be &s;o impre&s;&s;ed with the plain and &s;erious things which are now to be &s;poken, as you probably would, if I were &s;peaking by your dying beds, and you had the full exerci&s;e of your rea&s;on, and the near and lively view of eternity!</P>
<P N="1">I. I am briefly to con&s;ider what we are to under&s;tand by the one thing needful.</P>
<P>Now, I an&s;wer in a few words, it is the care of the &s;oul, oppo&s;ed, as you &s;ee in the text, to the care, <HI>i. e.</HI>
<PB N="299" REF="021060_0312_0FB20C47EA930470">
the exce&s;&s;ive care of the body; for which Martha was gently admoni&s;hed by our Lord. This is a general an|&s;wer, and it comprehends a variety of important parti|culars, which is the bu&s;ine&s;s of our mini&s;try often to open to you at large: The care of the &s;oul implies a readine&s;s to hear the words of Chri&s;t, to &s;et our&s;elves with Mary at his feet, and to receive both the law and the go&s;pel from his mouth. It &s;uppo&s;es that we learn from this divine teacher the worth of our &s;ouls, their danger, and their remedy. That we become above all things &s;olicitous about their eternal &s;alvation. That, heartily repenting of all our &s;ins, and cordially believ|ing the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, we receive the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t for righteou&s;ne&s;s and life, re&s;ting our &s;ouls on the value of his atonement, and the efficacy of his grace. It imports the &s;incere dedication of our&s;elves to the &s;er|vice of God, and a faithful adherence to it, notwith|&s;tanding all the oppo&s;itions ari&s;ing from inward corrup|tions, or outward temptations, and a re&s;olute per&s;e|verence in the way of go&s;pel dependence, till we receive the end of our faith in our complete &s;alvation. This is the one thing needful repre&s;ented indeed in various &s;criptures by various names. Sometimes it is called re|generation, or the new creature, becau&s;e it is the ble&s;&s;ed work of God's efficacious grace. Sometimes the fear of God, and &s;ometimes his love, and the keeping his com|mandments; and very frequently in the New Te&s;ta|ment it is called faith, or receiving Chri&s;t, and believ|ing on him, which therefore is repre&s;ented as the great work of God John 6, 9; <HI>i. e.</HI> the great thing which God in his glorious go&s;pel requires, as well as by his Spirit produces in us each of the&s;e, if rightly under&s;tood and explained, comprehends all that I have &s;aid on this head. On the whole, we may &s;ay, that, as the body is one, though it has many members, and the &s;oul is one, though it has many faculties, &s;o in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, this real, vital religion is one thing, one &s;acred principle of divine life, bringing us to attend to the care of our &s;ouls, as of our greate&s;t trea&s;ure. It is one thing, notwith|&s;tanding all the variety of views in which it may be con&s;idered, and of characters under which it may be de&s;cribed. I proceed,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="300" REF="021060_0313_0FB20C4A18312D20">II. To con&s;ider what may be intended in the repre|&s;entation which is here made of it, as the one thing needful.</P>
<P>Now I think it naturally includes the&s;e three parti|culars: it is a matter of univer&s;al concern, of the highe&s;t importance, and of &s;o comprehen&s;ive a nature, that every thing which is truly worthy of our regard, may be con|&s;idered as included in it, or &s;ub&s;ervient to it. Let me a little illu&s;trate each of the&s;e particulars, re&s;erving the proof of what I now a&s;&s;ert to the third general, where it will abundantly appear.</P>
<P N="1">1. The care of the &s;oul may be called the one thing needful, "as it is matter of univer&s;al concern."</P>
<P>Our Lord you &s;ee &s;peaks of it as needful in the gene|ral. He &s;ays not for this or that particular per&s;on; or for tho&s;e of &s;uch an age, &s;tation, or circum&s;tance in life, but needful for all. And indeed, when di&s;cour&s;ing on &s;uch a &s;ubject, one might properly introduce it with tho&s;e &s;olemn words of the P&s;almi&s;t. <HI>Give ear all ye people, hear all ye inhabitants of the earth, both high and low, rich and poor together</HI> P&s;. 49, 1.2. For it is the concern of all, from the king that &s;its upon the throne, to the &s;ervant that grindeth at the mill, or the beggar that li|eth upon the dunghill. It is needful for us that are mi|ni&s;ters, for our own &s;alvation is concerned. And woe, un&s;upportable woe, will be to our &s;ouls, if we think it enough to recommend it to others, to talk of it in a warm, or an awful manner, in public a&s;&s;emblies, or in our private conver&s;e: while it doth not penetrate our hearts as our own greate&s;t care. Our ca&s;e will then be like that of the I&s;raeliti&s;h Lord in Samaria 2 Kings 7, 2. who was employed to di&s;tribute the corn when the &s;iege was rai&s;ed, &s;eeing it with our eyes, and di&s;|pen&s;ing it with our hands, we &s;hall our&s;elves die mi&s;e|rable, without ta&s;ting the ble&s;&s;ings we impart. It is needful to all you that are our hearers, without the ex|ception of one &s;ingle per&s;on. It is needful to you that are rich, though it may on &s;ome accounts be peculiarly difficult for you; even as difficult, comparatively &s;peak|ing, as for <HI>a camel to go through the eye of a needle</HI> Mat. 19, 24; yet if it be neglected, you are poor in the mid&s;t of all your wealth, and mi&s;erable in all your abundance,
<PB N="301" REF="021060_0314_0FB20C4DAD507AA8">
and a wretch &s;tarving for hunger, in a magnificent palace and a rich dre&s;s, might be le&s;s the object of compa&s;&s;ion than you. It is needful for you that are poor; though you are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with &s;o many anxious cares, <HI>what you &s;hall eat, and what you &s;hall drink, and wherewithal you &s;hall be cloathed</HI> Mat. 6, 31. The nature that makes you capable of &s;uch anxieties as the&s;e, argues your much greater concern in the <HI>bread which endures to eternal life</HI> John 6, 27, than in that by which this mortal body mu&s;t be &s;upported. It is needful for you that are advanced in years; though your &s;trength be impaired, &s;o that the <HI>gra&s;hopper is a burthen</HI> Eccl. 12, 5; though you have by your long continuance in &s;in ren|dered this great work &s;o hard that were it le&s;s impor|tant, one would in pity let you alone without remind|ing you of it; yet, late as it is, it mu&s;t be done, or your hoary heads will be brought down to the grave with wrath, and &s;ink under a cur&s;e aggravated by every year and by every day of your lives. It is needful to you that are young, though &s;olicited by &s;o many gay vanities, to neglect it; though it may be repre&s;ented as an un&s;ea&s;onable care at pre&s;ent, yet I repeat it, it is needful to you; immediately needful, unle&s;s you who walk &s;o frequently over the du&s;t of your brethren and companions, that died in the bloom and vigor of their days, have made &s;ome &s;ecret covenant with the grave for your&s;elves, and found out &s;ome wonderful method, hitherto unknown, of &s;ecuring this precarious life, and of an&s;wering for days and months to come, while others cannot an&s;wer for one &s;ingle moment.</P>
<P N="2">2. The care of the &s;oul is <Q>a matter of the highe&s;t importance;</Q> beyond any thing which can be brought into compari&s;on with it.</P>
<P>As Solomon &s;ays of wi&s;dom, that it is more precious than rubies; and that all things which can be de&s;ired are not to be compared with her Prov. 3, 15. So may I properly &s;ay of this great and mo&s;t important branch of wi&s;dom, whatever can be laid in the balance with it; will be found altogether lighter than vanity. This is &s;trongly implied when its &s;aid in the next text, one thing is needful; <HI>q. d.</HI> One thing, and one thing alone i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;o. Ju&s;t as the ble&s;&s;ed God is &s;aid to be <HI>only wi&s;e</HI>
<PB N="302" REF="021060_0315_0FB20C4EAABD5478">
1 Tim. 1, 17, and <HI>only holy</HI> Rev. 15, 4, becau&s;e the wi&s;|dom and holine&s;s of angels and men is as nothing when compared with his. What &s;eems mo&s;t great and important in life, what kings and &s;enates, what the wi&s;e&s;t and great|e&s;t of this world are imploying their time, their coun|cils, their pens, their labours upon, are trifles, when compared with this one thing. A man may &s;ub&s;i&s;t, he may in &s;ome con&s;iderable mea&s;ure be happy, without learning, without riches, without titles, without health, without liberty, without friends, nay though <HI>the life be more than meat, and the body than raiment</HI> Mat. 6, 25. Yet may he be happy, un&s;peakably happy, without the bo|dy it&s;elf. But he cannot be &s;o in the neglect of the one thing needful. I mu&s;t therefore be&s;peak your regard to it in the words of <HI>Mo&s;es, It is not a light thing, but it is your life</HI> Deut. 32, 47.</P>
<P N="3">3. The care of the &s;oul is of &s;o comprehen&s;ive a na|ture, that every thing truely worthy of our regard may "be con&s;idered as included in it, or &s;ub&s;ervient to it."</P>
<P>As David ob&s;erves, that the <HI>commandment of God is exceeding broad</HI> P&s;al. 119, 96, &s;o may we &s;ay of this one thing needful; and as Solomon very ju&s;tly and empha|tically expre&s;&s;es it, to fear God and keep his command|ments is the whole of man; his whole duty, and his whole intere&s;t; and every thing which is wi&s;e and rational does in its proper place and connection make a part of. We &s;hould judge very ill concerning the na|ture of this care, if we imagined, that it con&s;i&s;ted merely in acts of devotion or religious contemplation; it com|prehends all the lovely and harmonious bonds of &s;ocial, and human virtues. It requires a care of &s;ociety, a care of our bodies, and of our temporal concerns; but then all is to be regulated, directed, and animated by pro|per regards to God, Chri&s;t, and immortality. Our food, and our re&s;t, our trades and our labours are to be attended to, and all the offices of humanity performed in obedience to the will of God, for the glory of Chri&s;t, and in a view to the improving the mind in a growing meekne&s;s for a &s;tate of complete per|fection. Name any thing which has no reference at all to this, and you name a worthle&s;s trifle, however it may be gilded to allure the eye, however it may be &s;weetened

<P N="3">III. To &s;hew you with how much propriety the care of the &s;oul may be repre&s;ented under this character, as the one thing needful, as a matter of univer&s;al and mo&s;t &s;erious concern, to which every thing el&s;e is to be con|&s;idered as &s;ub&s;ervient, if at all worthy of our care and pur&s;uit. Now let me appeal to the &s;entiments of tho&s;e who mu&s;t be allowed mo&s;t capable of judging, and to the evident rea&s;on of the care of it&s;elf, as it mu&s;t appear to every unprejudiced mind.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let me argue from the &s;entiments of tho&s;e who mu&s;t be allowed mo&s;t capable of judging in &s;uch an af|fair, and we &s;hall quickly &s;ee that the care of the &s;oul appears to them the one thing needful.</P>
<P>Is the judgment of the ble&s;&s;ed God according to truth, how evidently and how &s;olemnly is that judgment de|clared? I will not &s;ay merely in this or the other parti|cular pa&s;&s;age of his word, but in the whole &s;eries of his revelations to the children of men; and the whole tenor of his addre&s;&s;es to them. Is not this the language of all, from the early days of Job and Mo&s;es, to the conclu&s;ion of the canon of Scripture. If wi&s;dom be hid from the eyes of all the living, &s;urely God under&s;tandeth the way thereof, he knoweth the place thereof; and if he does, it is plainly pointed out, for <HI>unto man he &s;till &s;aith, be|hold the fear of the Lord, that is wi&s;dom, and to depart from evil, that is under&s;tanding</HI> Job 28, 21.23.28. By Mo&s;es therefore, he declared to the I&s;raelites, that to do the commandments of the Lord, would be their wi&s;dom and their under&s;tanding in the &s;ight of the na|tions who &s;hould hear his &s;tatutes, and &s;ay, &s;urely this is a wi&s;e and under&s;tanding people Deut. 4, 6. When he had rai&s;ed up one man on the throne of I&s;rael, with the character of the wi&s;e&s;t that ever lived upon the face of
<PB N="304" REF="021060_0317_0FB20C525A3BB2C0">
the earth, he cho&s;e to make him eminently a teacher of this great truth. And now all that he &s;poke on the cu|rious and le&s;s concerning &s;ubjects of natural philo&s;ophy is lo&s;t, <HI>though he &s;poke of trees from the cedar to the by&s;&s;op, and of bea&s;ts, and of fowls, and of creeping things, and of fi&s;hes</HI> 2 Kings 6, 33; that &s;aying is pre&s;erved in which he te&s;tifies, that <HI>the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wi&s;dom</HI> Prov. 1, 7.9.10. and tho&s;e proverbs, in almo&s;t every line of which they who neglect God and their own &s;ouls are &s;poken of as fools, as if that were the mo&s;t proper &s;ignification of the word, while the religious a|lone are honoured with the title of wi&s;e. But, in this re&s;pect, as atte&s;ting this truth in the name of God and in his own, a greater than Solomon is here.</P>
<P>For if we require what it was that our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t judged to be the one thing needful, the words of the text contain as full an an&s;wer as can be imagined; and the &s;en&s;e of them is repeated in a very lively and emphatical manner, in that remarkable pa&s;&s;age wherein our Lord not only declares his own judgment, but &s;eems to appeal to the con&s;ciences of all, as obliged by their own &s;ecret convictions to &s;ub&s;cribe to the truth of it. <HI>What is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lo&s;e his own &s;oul, or what will a man give in exchange for his &s;oul</HI> Mat. 16, 26? If it were once lo&s;t, what would he not be willing to give to redeem it. But it depends not on the words of Chri&s;t alone. Let his actions, his &s;ufferings, his blood, his death, &s;peak what a value he &s;et on the &s;ouls of men. Is it to be imagined, that he would have relinqui&s;hed heaven, that he would have dwelt upon earth, that he would have laboured by night and by day, and at la&s;t have expired on the cro&s;s, for a matter of light importance? Or can we think that he, in whom dwells all the trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom and know|ledge, and all the fulne&s;s of the Godhead bodily, was mi&s;taken in a judgment &s;o deliberately formed, and &s;o &s;olemnly declared.</P>
<P>If, after this, there were room to mention human judgment and te&s;timonies, how ea&s;y would it be to pro|duce a cloud of witne&s;&s;es in &s;uch a cau&s;e, and to &s;hew that the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t, of men in all ages of the world have agreed in this point, that, amid&s;t all the diver&s;ities
<PB N="305" REF="021060_0318_0FB20C566DF63C40">
of opinion and profe&s;&s;ion, which &s;ucceeding generations have produced, this has been the unanimous judgment, this the common and mo&s;t &s;ollicitous care of tho&s;e, who&s;e characters are mo&s;t truly valuable, to &s;ecure the &s;alvation of their own &s;ouls, and to promote the &s;alvation of others.</P>
<P>And let me be&s;eech you &s;eriou&s;ly to reflect what are the characters of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> who have taken the liberty, mo&s;t boldly and freely t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> clare their judgment on the con|trary &s;ide?

<P>But you will &s;ay, and you will &s;ay it too truly, though but a few may venture in words to declare for the ne|glect of the &s;oul and its eternal intere&s;t, the greater part of mankind do it in their actions. But are the greater part of mankind &s;o wi&s;e, and &s;o good, as implicitly to be followed in matters of the highe&s;t importance? And do not multitudes of the&s;e declare them&s;elves on the other &s;ide, in their mo&s;t &s;erious moments? When the intoxications of worldly bu&s;ine&s;s and plea&s;ures are over, and &s;ome langui&s;hing &s;ickne&s;s forces men to &s;olitude and retirement; what have you generally ob&s;erved to be the effect of &s;uch a circum&s;tance? Have they not then de|clared them&s;elves convinced of the truth we are now labouring to e&s;tabli&s;h? Nay, do we not &s;ometimes &s;ee that a di&s;temper which &s;eizes the mind with violence, yet does not utterly de&s;troy its rea&s;oning faculties, fixes this conviction on the &s;oul in a few hours, nay &s;ometimes in a few moments? Have you never &s;een a gay, thought|le&s;s creature, &s;urprized in the giddy round of plea&s;ure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and amu&s;ements, and pre&s;ently brought not only to &s;e|riou&s;ne&s;s, but terror and trembling, by the near view<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

of death? Have you never &s;een the man of bu&s;ine&s;s and care interrupted, like the rich fool in the parable, in the mid&s;t of his &s;chemes for the pre&s;ent world? And have you not heard one and the other of them owning the vanity of tho&s;e plea&s;ures and cares, which but a few days ago, were every thing to them? Confe&s;&s;ing that religion was the one thing needful, and recom|mending it to others with an earne&s;tne&s;s, as if they hoped thereby to atone for their own former neglect? We that are mini&s;ters frequently are witne&s;&s;es to &s;uch things as the&s;e, and I believe few of our hearers are entire &s;trangers to them.</P>
<P>And once more, what if, to the te&s;timony of the dy|ing, we could add that of the dead? What if God were to turn a&s;ide the veil which &s;eparates between us and the invi&s;ible world, and to permit the mo&s;t carele&s;s &s;in|ner in the a&s;&s;embly to conver&s;e for a few moments with the inhabitants of it? If you were to apply your&s;elf to a happy Spirit, that trod the mo&s;t thorny road to pa|radi&s;e or pa&s;&s;ed through the mo&s;t fiery trial, and to a&s;k him, <Q>Was it worth your while to labour &s;o much, and to endure &s;o much for what you now po&s;&s;e&s;s?</Q> Surely if the ble&s;&s;ed in heaven were capable of indig|nation, it would move them to hear that it &s;hould be made a que&s;tion. And, on the other hand, if you could enquire of one tormented in that flame below, though he might once be cloathed in purple and fine linen, and fare &s;umptuou&s;ly every day, if you could a&s;k him, <Q>Whether his former enjoyments were an equivalent for his pre&s;ent &s;ufferings and de&s;pair?</Q> What an&s;wer do you &s;uppo&s;e he would return? Perhaps an an&s;wer of &s;o much horror and rage, as you would not be able &s;o much as to endure. Or if the malignity of his na|ture &s;hould prevent him from returning any an&s;wer at all, &s;urely there would be a language even in that &s;ilence, a language in the darkne&s;s and flames, and groans of that infernal pri&s;on, which would &s;peak to your very &s;oul what the word of God is with equal certainty, though le&s;s forcible conviction, &s;peaking to your &s;oul's ear, that one thing is needful. You &s;ee it is &s;o in the judgment of God the Father, and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of men, of many who &s;eemed to judge

mo&s;t differently of it, when they came to more delibe|rate and &s;erious thought, and not only of the dying, but of the dead too, of tho&s;e who have experimentally known both worlds, and mo&s;t &s;urely know what is to be pre|ferred. But I will not re&s;t the whole argument here, I add therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. I appeal to the evident rea&s;ons of the ca&s;e it&s;elf, as it mu&s;t appear to every unprejudiced mind, that the care of the &s;oul is indeed the one thing needful.</P>
<P>I &s;till con&s;ider my&s;elf as &s;peaking not to Athei&s;ts, or to Dei&s;ts, but to tho&s;e who not only believe the exi&s;t|ence and providence of God, and a future &s;tate of happi|ne&s;s and mi&s;ery, but likewi&s;e who credit the truth of the Chri&s;tian revelation, as many undoubtedly do who live in a fatal neglect of God and their own &s;ouls. Now, on the&s;e principles, a little reflection may be &s;ufficient to convince you, that it is needful to the pre&s;ent repo&s;e of your own mind, needful, if ever you would &s;ecure eter|nal happine&s;s, if ever you would avoid eternal mi&s;ery, which will be aggravated, rather than alleviated, by all your pre&s;ent enjoyments.</P>
<P N="1">1. The care of the &s;oul is the one thing needful, <Q>be|cau&s;e without it you cannot &s;ecure the peace of your own mind, nor avoid the upbraidings of your con&s;ci|ence.</Q></P>
<P>That noble faculty is indeed, as you are often told, the vicegerent of God in the &s;oul. 'Tis &s;en&s;ible of the dignity and worth of an immortal Spirit, and will &s;ome|times cry out of the violence that is offered to it, and cry &s;o loud, as to compel the &s;inner to hear, whether he will or no. Do you not &s;ometimes find it your&s;elves? When you labour mo&s;t to forget the concerns of your &s;oul, do they not &s;ometimes force them&s;elves on your remembrance? You are afraid of the reflections of your own mind, but with all your artifice and all your re&s;o|lution, can you entirely avoid them? Does your con&s;ci|ence follow you to your beds, even if denied the oppor|tunity of meeting you in your clo&s;ets, and though with an unwelcome voice, there warn you, <Q>that your &s;oul is neglected, and will quickly be lo&s;t:</Q> Does it not follow you to your &s;hops and your fields, when you are bu&s;ie&s;t there? Nay I will add, does it not &s;ometimes

follow you to the fea&s;t, the club, to the dance, and per|haps, amid&s;t all re&s;i&s;tance, to the theatre too? Does it not &s;ometimes mingle your &s;weete&s;t draught with wormwood, and your gaye&s;t &s;cenes with horror? So that you are like a trade&s;man, who, &s;u&s;pecting his af|fairs to be in a bad po&s;ture, lays up his books and his papers, yet &s;ometimes they will come accidentally in his way. He hardly dares to look abroad for fear of meeting a creditor, or an arre&s;t; and if he labours to forget his cares and his dangers, in a cour&s;e of luxury at home, the remembrance is &s;ometimes awakened, and the alarm increa&s;ed, by tho&s;e very extravagancies in which he is attempting to lo&s;e it. Such, no doubt, is the ca&s;e of &s;ome of your minds, and it is a very painful &s;tate, and while things are thus within, external circum|&s;tances can no more make you happy, than a fine dre&s;s could relieve you under a violent fit of the &s;tone. Whereas, if this great affair were &s;ecured, you might delight in reflection, as much as you now dread it; and con&s;cience your bittere&s;t enemy, would become a delightful friend, and the te&s;timony of it your greate&s;t rejoicing.</P>
<P N="2">2. The care of the &s;oul is the one thing needful, <Q>be|cau&s;e without it you cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;ecure your eter|nal happine&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>A crown of everla&s;ting glory is not &s;urely &s;uch a trifle as to be thrown away on a carele&s;s creature, that will not in good earne&s;t pur&s;ue it. God doth not ordinarily deal thus, even with the bounties of his common provi|dence, which are comparatively of little value. As to the&s;e, the hand of the diligent generally makes rich, and he would be thought di&s;tracted, rather than prudent, who &s;hould expect to get an e&s;tate, merely by wi&s;hing for it, or without &s;ome re&s;olute and continued applica|tion to a proper cour&s;e of action for that purpo&s;e. Now, that we may not fooli&s;hly dream of obtaining heaven in, the mid&s;t of a cour&s;e of indolence and &s;loth, we are ex|pre&s;sly told in the word of God, that the <HI>kingdom of heaven &s;uffers violence, and the violent take it by force</HI> Matt. 11, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. And are therefore exhorted to &s;trive, with the greate&s;t inten&s;ene&s;s, and eagerne&s;s of mind, as the word properly &s;ignifies, to enter in at the &s;trait gate, for this great and

important rea&s;on, <HI>becau&s;e many &s;hall</HI> another day, <HI>&s;eek to enter in, and &s;hall not be able</HI> Luke 12, 24. Nay, when our Lord makes the mo&s;t gracious promi&s;es to the hum|ble petitioner, he does it in &s;uch a manner as to exclude the hopes of tho&s;e who are carele&s;s and indifferent.&mdash; <HI>A&s;k, and it &s;hall be given you; &s;eek, and you &s;hall find; knock, and it &s;hall be opened unto you</HI> Mat. 7, 7. If therefore you do not a&s;k, &s;eek, and knock, the door of mercy will not be opened, and eternal happine&s;s will be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>And &s;urely if I could &s;ay no more as to the fatal con|&s;equences of your neglect, than this, that eternal hap|pine&s;s will be lo&s;t, I &s;hould &s;ay enough to impre&s;s eve|ry mind that con&s;iders what eternity means. To fall into a &s;tate of everla&s;ting forgetfulne&s;s, might indeed appear a refuge to a mind filled with the apprehen&s;ion of future mi&s;ery. But, Oh how dreadful a refuge is it! Surely it is &s;uch a refuge as a va&s;t precipice, from which a man falling, would be da&s;hed to pieces in a moment, might appear to a per&s;on pur&s;ued by the officers of ju&s;|tice, that he might be brought out to a painful and lin|gering execution. If an extravagant youth would have rea&s;on to look round with augui&s;h on &s;ome fair and am|ple paternal inheritance, which he had &s;old or forfeited merely for the riot of a few days: how much more me|lancholy would it be for a rational mind to think that its eternal happine&s;s is lo&s;t for any earthly con&s;ideration whatever. Tormenting thought! had I attended to the one thing which I have neglected, I might have been great and happy, beyond expre&s;&s;ion, beyond conception. Not merely for the little &s;pan of ten thou&s;and thou&s;and ages, but FOR EVER. So that the moment would have come, when, if it had been a&s;ked concerning me, <Q>How long has that glorious Spirit been an inhabitant of heaven? How long has it been enjoying God, and its &s;elf in that &s;tate of perfection?</Q> The an&s;wer would have been &s;uch, that no line of any determinate finite length would have been &s;ufficient to have contained the number of ages, no time can be a&s;&s;igned &s;ufficient to figure them down. This is eternity, but I have lo&s;t it, and am now on the verge of being. This lamp, which might have outla&s;ted tho&s;e of the firmament, will pre|&s;ently be extingui&s;hed, and I blotted out from among&s;t
<PB N="310" REF="021060_0323_0FB20C60EC65D458">
the works of God, and cut off from all the bounties of his hand. Would not this be a very mi&s;erable ca&s;e, if this were all? And would it not be &s;ufficient to prove this to be the better part, which, as our Lord ob&s;erves, can never be taken away? But, God forbid, that we &s;hould be &s;o unfaithful to him, and to the &s;ouls of men, as to re&s;t in &s;uch a repre&s;entation alone. I therefore add once more.</P>
<P N="3">3. The care of the &s;oul is the one thing needful, be|cau&s;e without it, you cannot avoid a &s;tate of eternal mi&s;ery, which will be aggravated, rather than alleviated by all your pre&s;ent enjoyments.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more evident from the word of the God of truth. It there plainly appears to be a deter|mined ca&s;e which leaves no room for a more favourable conjecture or hope. The wicked &s;hall be turned into hell, even all the nations that forget God. They &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, into a &s;tate where they &s;hall in vain wi&s;h for death, and &s;hall not be able to find it. Oh! &s;irs, 'tis a certain, but an awful truth, that your &s;ouls will be thinking and immortal beings, even in &s;pight of them&s;elves. They may indeed tor|ment, but they cannot de&s;troy them&s;elves. They can no more &s;u&s;pend their power, thought and perception, than a mirrour its property of reflecting rays that fall on its &s;urface. Do you &s;u&s;pect the contrary? Make the trial immediately. Command your minds to cea&s;e from thinking but for one quarter of an hour, or for half that time, and exclude every idea and every reflection. Can you &s;ucceed in that attempt? Or rather, does not thought pre&s;s in with a more &s;en&s;ible violence on that re&s;i&s;tence, as anxious de&s;ire to &s;leep, makes us &s;o much the more wakeful. Thus, will thought follow you be|yond the grave, thus will it, as an unwelcome gue&s;t, force it&s;elf upon you, when it can &s;erve only to perplex and di&s;tre&s;s the mind. It will for ever upbraid you, that, notwith&s;tanding all the kind remon&s;trances of con|&s;cience, and the pleadings of the blood of Chri&s;t, you have gone on in your folly, till heaven is lo&s;t, and dam|nation incurred; and all for what? for a &s;hadow and a dream.</P>
<P>Oh think not, &s;inners, that the remembrance of your
<PB N="311" REF="021060_0324_0FB20C62E3D460E8">
pa&s;t plea&s;ures, of your &s;ucce&s;s in your other cares whil&s;t that of the one thing needful was forgotten think not that this will ea&s;e your minds. It will rather torment them the more. Son, remember that thou in thy life|time received&s;t thy good things. Bitter remembrance! Well might the heathen poets repre&s;ent the unhappy &s;pirits in &s;hades below, as eagerly catching at the water of forgetfulne&s;s, yet unable to reach it. Your pre&s;ent comforts will only &s;erve to give you a livelier &s;en&s;e of your mi&s;ery, as having ta&s;ted &s;uch degrees of enjoyment; and to inflame the reckoning, as you have mi&s;improved tho&s;e talents lodged in your hands for better purpo&s;es. Surely if the&s;e things were believed, and &s;eriou&s;ly con|&s;idered, the &s;inner would have no more heart to rejoice in his pre&s;ent pro&s;perity, than a man would have to a|mu&s;e him&s;elf with the curio&s;ities of a fine garden, through which he was led to be broke upon the rack.</P>
<P>But I will enlarge no further upon the&s;e things.&mdash; Would to God that the unaccountable &s;tupidity of mens minds, and their fatal attachment to the plea&s;ures and cares of the pre&s;ent life, did not make it nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;i&s;t on them &s;o frequently and &s;o copiou&s;ly!</P>
<P N="4">IV. I proceed to the reflections which naturally ari&s;e from hence, and &s;hall only mention two.</P>
<P N="1">1. How much rea&s;on have we to lament the folly of mankind, in neglecting the one thing needful.</P>
<P>If religion be indeed the true&s;t wi&s;dom, then &s;urely we have the ju&s;te&s;t rea&s;on to &s;ay with Solomon, that folly and madne&s;s is in mens hearts. Is it the one thing needful? Look on the conduct of the generality of man|kind, and you would imagine they thought it the one thing needle&s;s: the vaine&s;t dream, and the idle&s;t amu&s;e|ment of the mind. God is admoni&s;hing them by ordi|nances, and providences, &s;ometimes by &s;uch as are mo&s;t awful, to lay it to heart: he &s;peaks once, yea twice, yea a multitude of times, but man regards it not. They pro|fe&s;s perhaps to believe all that I have been &s;aying, but act as if the contrary were &s;elf-evident; they will ri&s;k the&s;e &s;ouls and this eternity, for a thing of nought, for that for the &s;ake of which they would not ri&s;k &s;o much as a hand or a finger, or a joint, no, nor perhaps a toy that adorns it. Surely this is the wonder of angels, and per|haps
<PB N="312" REF="021060_0325_0FB20C6464DAD468">
of devils too, unle&s;s the ob&s;ervation of &s;o many ages may have rendered it familiar to both. And can we my Chri&s;tian brethren, behold &s;uch a &s;cene with indifference? If &s;ome epidemical madne&s;s had &s;eized our country, or the places where we live, &s;o that as we went from one place to another, we &s;hould every where meet with lunaticks, and &s;ee among&s;t the re&s;t, &s;ome per|haps of the fine&s;t genius and improvements, and the mo&s;t eminent &s;tate&s;men of life, amu&s;ing them&s;elves with &s;traws and bubbles, or wounding them&s;elves and others; &s;urely were we ever &s;o &s;ecure from the danger of infec|tion or a&s;&s;ault, the &s;ight would cut us to the heart. Surely a good natured man would hardly be able to go abroad, or even be de&s;irous to live among&s;t &s;o many &s;ad &s;pectacles. Yet the&s;e poor creatures might, notwith|&s;tanding this, be the children of God, and the higher their frenzy ro&s;e, the nearer might their complete hap|pine&s;s be. But, alas, the greater part of mankind are &s;eized with a wor&s;e kind of madne&s;s, in which they are ruining their &s;ouls: and can we behold it with indif|ference! The Lord awaken our compa&s;&s;ion, our prayers, and our endeavours, in dependence on divine grace, that we may be in&s;trumental in bringing them to their right mind, and making them wi&s;e indeed, that is, wi&s;e to &s;alvation.</P>
<P N="2">2. How nece&s;&s;ary is it that we &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly inquire how this one thing needful is regarded by us!</P>
<P>Let me intreat you to remember your own concern in it, and inquire&mdash;Have I thought &s;eriou&s;ly of it?&mdash; Have I &s;een the importance of it?&mdash;Has it lain with a due and an abiding weight on my mind?&mdash;Has it brought me to Chri&s;t, that I might lay the &s;tre&s;s of the&s;e great eternal intere&s;ts on him? And am I acting in the main of my life as one that has the&s;e convictions?&mdash;Am I willing in fact to give up other things, my intere&s;ts, my plea&s;ures, my pa&s;&s;ions to this?&mdash;Am I conver&s;ing with God and with man, as one that believes the&s;e things, as one that has deliberately cho&s;en the better part, and is determined to abide by that choice?</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve the an&s;wer which con&s;cience returns to the&s;e inquiries and you will know your own part in that more particular application, with which I am to conclude my di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="313" REF="021060_0326_0FB20C65E33588D8">1. Let me addre&s;s my&s;elf to tho&s;e that are entirely unconcerned about the one thing needful.</P>
<P>Sirs, I have been &s;tating the ca&s;e at large, and now I appeal to your con&s;ciences, are the&s;e things &s;o? or are they not? God and your own hearts be&s;t know for what the care of your &s;oul is neglected; but be it what it will, the difference between one grain of &s;and, and a|nother is not great, when it comes to be weighed again&s;t a talent of gold. Whatever it is, you had need to examine it carefully. You had need to view that commodity on all &s;ides, of which you do in effect &s;ay, for this will I &s;ell my &s;oul, for this will I give up heaven and venture hell, be heaven and hell whatever they may. In the name of God, &s;irs, is this the part of a man, of a rational creature? To go on with your eyes open towards a pit of eternal ruin, becau&s;e there are a few gay flowers in the way. Or what if you &s;hut your eyes? will that prevent your fall? It &s;ignifies little to &s;ay, I will not think of the&s;e things, I will not con&s;ider them. God has &s;aid, In the la&s;t days they &s;hall con&s;ider it perfectly. The revels of a drunken malefactor will not prevent, nor re&s;pite his execution. Pardon my plainne&s;s, if it were a fable or a tale, I would endeavour to amu&s;e you with words, but I cannot do it where your &s;ouls are at &s;take.</P>
<P N="2">2. I would apply to tho&s;e who are convinced of the importance of their &s;ouls, yet are inclined to defer that care of them a little longer, which, in the general, they &s;ee to be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>I know you that are young, are under peculiar temp|tations to do this; though it is &s;trange that the death of &s;o many of your companions &s;hould not be an an&s;wer to &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;pecious and dangerous of tho&s;e temptations. Methinks if there were the lea&s;t degree of uncertainty, the importance is too weighty to put matters to the venture. But here the uncertainty is great and apparent. You mu&s;t &s;urely know that there are critical &s;ea&s;ons of life for managing the concerns of it, which are of &s;uch a nature, that if once lo&s;t, they may never return: here is a critical &s;ea&s;on. Now is the accepted time, now is the day of &s;alvation. To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. This

language may not be &s;poken to-morrow. Talk not of a more convenient &s;ea&s;on, none can be more convenient; and, that to which you would probably refer it, is lea&s;t of all &s;o. A dying time. You would not chu&s;e then to have any important bu&s;ine&s;s in hand; and will you of choice refer the greate&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s of all to that lan|gui&s;hing, hurrying, amazing hour? If a friend were then to come to you with the balance of an intricate ac|count, or a view of a title to an e&s;tate, you would &s;hake your fainting head, and lift up your pale trembling hand, and &s;ay perhaps with a feeble voice, <Q>alas, is this a time for the&s;e things!</Q> And is it a time for &s;o much greater things than the&s;e! I wi&s;h you knew, and would con&s;ider in what a &s;trait we that are mini&s;ters are &s;ometimes brought, when we are called to the dy|ing beds of tho&s;e who have &s;pent their lives in the ne|glect of the one thing needful. On the other hand, we fear lea&s;t, if we palliate matters, and &s;peak &s;mooth things, we &s;hall betray and ruin their &s;ouls; and, on the other hand, that if we u&s;e a becoming plainne&s;s and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, in warning them of their danger, we &s;hall quite overwhelm them, and ha&s;ten the dying moment, which is advancing by &s;uch &s;teps. Oh let me intreat you for our &s;akes, and much more for your own, that you do not drive us to &s;uch &s;ad extremities; but that if you are convinced, as I hope &s;ome of you may now be, that the care of the &s;oul is that needful thing we have repre&s;ented, let the conviction work, let it drive you immediately to the throne of grace, that from thence you may derive that wi&s;dom and &s;trength which may direct you in all the intricacies which intangle you, and animate you in the mid&s;t of difficulty and di&s;courage|ment.</P>
<P N="3">3. I would, in the la&s;t place, addre&s;s my&s;elf to tho&s;e happy &s;ouls who have in good earne&s;t attended to the one thing needful.</P>
<P>I hope when you &s;ee how commonly it is neglected, neglected indeed by many, who&s;e natural capacities, improvements, and circum&s;tances in life, appear to you &s;uperior to your own, you will humbly acknowledge, that it was di&s;tingui&s;hing grace that brought you into this happy &s;tate, and formed you to this mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary

care. Ble&s;s the Lord, therefore, who hath given you that coun&s;el, in virtue of which you can &s;ay, that he is your portion.&mdash;Rejoice in the thought, that the great concern is &s;ecured; as it is natural for us to do, when &s;ome important affair is di&s;patched which has long lain before us, and which we have been inclined to put off from one day to another, but have at length &s;trenuou&s;ly and &s;ucce&s;sfully attended.&mdash;Remember &s;till to continue acting on the&s;e great principles which at fir&s;t determined your choice; and &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider, that tho&s;e who de|&s;ire their life may at la&s;t be given them for a prey, mu&s;t continue on their guard, in all &s;tages of their journey through a wilderne&s;s, where daily dangers are &s;till &s;ur|rounding them. Having &s;ecured the great concern, make your&s;elves ea&s;y as to others of &s;maller importance. You have cho&s;en the kingdom of God, and his righteou&s;ne&s;s, other things therefore &s;hall be added unto you; and if any which you de&s;ire &s;hould not be added, comfort your|&s;elves with this thought, that you have the good part which can never be taken away. And, not to enlarge on the&s;e obvious hints, which mu&s;t &s;o often occur, be very &s;olicitous that others may be brought to a care a|bout the one thing needful. If it be needful for you, it is for your children, your friends, your &s;ervants. Let them therefore &s;ee your concern in this re&s;pect for them, as well as for your&s;elves. Let parents, e&s;pecially, attend to this exhortation, who&s;e care for their off&s;pring often exceeds in other re&s;pects, and fails in this. Remember that your children may never live to enjoy the effects of your labour and concern, to get them e&s;tates and portions. The charges of their funerals may perhaps be all their &s;hare of what you are &s;o anxiou&s;ly careful to lay up for them. And, oh! think what a &s;word would pierce through your very heart, if you &s;hould &s;tand by the corps of a beloved child with this reflection, <Q>This poor creature has done with life, before it learnt its great bu&s;ine&s;s in it, and is gone to eternity, which I have been &s;eldom warning it to prepare for, and which perhaps it learnt of me to forget</Q>.</P>
<P>On the whole, may this grand care be awakened to tho&s;e by whom it has hitherto been neglected; may it be revived in each of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> minds. And that you may be
<PB N="316" REF="021060_0329_0FB20C6C80594778">
encouraged to pur&s;ue it with greater chearfulne&s;s, let me conclude with this comfortable thought, that in pro|portion to the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, is the provi&s;ion which divine grace has made for our a&s;&s;i&s;tance. If you are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;it down at Chri&s;t's feet, he will teach you by his word and &s;pirit. If you commit this precious jewel, which is your eternal all, into his hand, he will pre&s;erve it unto that day, and will then produce it richly adorned, and gloriou&s;ly improved to his own honour, and to your everla&s;ting joy. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
