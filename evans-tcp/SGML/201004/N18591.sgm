<Q><BIBL>EXOD. xxi. 16.</BIBL>
<P>HE THAT STEALETH A MAN AND SELLETH HIM, OR IF HE BE FOUND IN HIS HAND, HE SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO adore our Almighty Maker, to confide in the Lord Redeemer, and to exerci&s;e genuine benevolence towards all mankind, mani|fe&s;tly include both our duty and happine&s;s in the pre&s;ent &s;tate. To the fir&s;t we are bound as rea|&s;onable creatures; to the &s;econd, we are encou|raged by the go&s;pel, as peri&s;hing &s;inners; and to the la&s;t we are obliged as &s;ocial beings, &s;ur|rounded with multitudes of our own &s;pecies.&mdash; To promote this wor&s;hip of God our Creator, this confidence in Chri&s;t the Redeemer, and this cordial affection for our neighbours, in the great end of an evangelical mini&s;try, and of all divine in&s;titutions that are of a religious kind. For this end are we now a&s;&s;embled; and to plead the cau&s;e of moral ju&s;tice, of true benevolence, and of compa&s;&s;ion, relative to the poor oppre&s;&s;ed Africans, I have read that part of &s;acred writ
<PB N="4" REF="024128_0004_0FC3B3B5A3A2C1C8">which is now before us. Yes, my brethren, I now &s;tand to bear a public te&s;timony again&s;t that diver&s;ified iniquity, which is in&s;eparable from a commerce in the human &s;pecies&mdash;that commerce which is called the <HI>Slave-Trade,</HI> together with its numerous and horrid con&s;equences.</P>
<P>That &s;lavery again&s;t which I am going to plead is not of a civil or political kind, but entirely of a <HI>per&s;onal</HI> nature. For though it is much to be wi&s;hed that liberty, in a civil and political &s;en&s;e, may be enjoyed and &s;louri&s;h without licentiou&s;|ne&s;s, in all the nations of the earth; yet I ne|ver thought &s;ubjects of that nature proper to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the pulpit, and e&s;pecially on the Lord's day. But the exerci&s;e of moral ju&s;tice, of benevolence, and of humanity, being enforced by every principle of evangelical truth; an en|deavour to promote tho&s;e virtuous affections to|ward our extremely degraded and oppre&s;&s;ed fel|low-creatures, the Negroes, mu&s;t be completely con&s;i&s;tent with the commands of divine law, the grace of the glorious go&s;pel, and the &s;olemni|ties of public wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>It may be proper for me here to remark, that it is not again&s;t <HI>per&s;onal</HI> &s;lavery, as ab&s;olutely, univer&s;ally, and in every po&s;&s;ible ca&s;e, evil, that I am going to &s;peak. By no means. For a man may &s;o violate the laws and rights of &s;ociety, as ju&s;tly to forfeit his liberty; as to de&s;erve &s;lave|ry&mdash; <HI>&s;lavery,</HI> in a &s;trict and proper &s;en&s;e&mdash;that he may be an example to others, and compen|&s;ate, as far as lies in his power, the injuries done to &s;ociety by an abu&s;e of his own liberty. Yet
<PB N="5" REF="024128_0005_0FC3B3B7348ED580">even in this ca&s;e, the holding of his po&s;terity, not guilty of &s;imilar crimes, in a &s;tate of &s;lave|ry, would be a flagrant violation of ju&s;tice. It is then, again&s;t the &s;tealing, the purcha&s;ing, and the en&s;laving of innocent per&s;ons, that I intend to argue&mdash;<HI>innocent,</HI> not in a moral, but in a civil &s;en&s;e. For if we con&s;ider our&s;elves as the &s;ubjects of Jehovah's moral government, we are all guilty; we all de&s;erve to peri&s;h, and lie at his merey: nor would any man have the lea&s;t ground of complaint again&s;t the divine conduct, were eternal ju&s;tice to plunge him in final ruin. But with regard to that relation in which men &s;tand to a &s;ecular &s;overeign, and as members of civil &s;ociety, the ca&s;e is widely different. For here they may be <HI>innocent;</HI> and, being &s;o, are completely entitled to per&s;onal freedom.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of my de&s;ign, I &s;hall now &s;how, That the law in our text, though given to the ancient Hebrews as a body politic, proceeds on a moral ground&mdash;That though God, in certain ca&s;es, permitted the I&s;raelites to purcha&s;e their fellow-creatures for &s;ervitude; yet that purcha&s;e and &s;ervitude were attended with &s;uch re&s;tricti|ons, as rendered them e&s;&s;entially different from the European Slave-Trade and its con&s;equences. That &s;uppo&s;ing God had permitted the I&s;raelit|i&s;h people to traffic in the human &s;pecies, and to en&s;lave the Gentiles in a much greater degree than he did; it would not have warranted the conduct of Europeans toward the Africans.&mdash; And, that the European commerce in man, and the &s;lavery con&s;equent upon it, are ab&s;olutely in|imical
<PB N="6" REF="024128_0006_0FC3B3B8A2C6C178">to the precepts of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the whole tenor of his doctrine.</P>
<P>FIRST, <HI>The law in our text, though given to the ancient Hebrews as a body politic, proceeds on a moral ground.</HI></P>
<P>That no great labour of proof is nece&s;&s;ary to evince the truth of this propo&s;ition, a &s;mall de|gree of reflection will &s;how. For though the divine law before us was manife&s;tly given to the I&s;raelites, as part of their judicial code, and was intended to regulate their conduct one to|wards another; yet it no le&s;s apparently proceeds on the &s;ame principle with that prohibition of the decalogue, <HI>Thou &s;halt not &s;teal.</HI> So Paul, with reference perhaps to this very pa&s;&s;age, &s;ays, <HI>The law is not made for a righteous man, but for &mdash;murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for man&s;layers, for whoremongens, for them that defile them&s;elves with mankind, for</HI> MEN-STEAL|ERS, <HI>for liars, for perijured per&s;ons.</HI> Man-&s;teal|ing is here cla&s;&s;ed with &s;uch crimes as are mo&s;t dete&s;table in the &s;ight of God, mo&s;t pernicious to &s;ociety and mo&s;t de&s;erving of death by the &s;word of the civil magi&s;trate. Man&s;tealing, there|fore, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a moral evil&mdash;univer|&s;ally evil, in every age and in every nation. Nor is it only an evil, but one of the fir&s;t magnitude again&s;t our neighbour. If he who pilfers any one's property, &s;teals a &s;heep, robs on the high road, or commits a burglary, be con&s;idered and treated as a thief, a robber, a pe&s;t of &s;ociety; of what enormous villainy mu&s;t he be guilty, who kidnaps my hone&s;t neighbour, my faithful
<PB N="7" REF="024128_0007_0FC3B3BA2E18DF70">&s;ervant, my dutiful child, or my affectionate wife, to tran&s;port the one or the other to a country entirely unknown, and never thence to return! This outrage on the &s;acred rights of liberty, of ju&s;tice, and of humanity, is greatly enhanced, if that wor&s;t of thieves intend, either to treat them him&s;elf as the mo&s;t abject of &s;laves, like tho&s;e in the Briti&s;h We&s;t-Indies; or to &s;ell them for that mo&s;t infamous and cruel purpo&s;e. In either of the&s;e ca&s;es, and much more when both are united, rea&s;on and con&s;cience, the com|mon &s;entiments and feelings of mankind, will all unite, if not debauched by avarice, or blunted by habit, in approving this law of Jehovah as ju&s;t; <HI>He that &s;tealeth a man and &s;elleth him, or if he be found in his hand,</HI> HE SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH. Nor is there a man upon earth, not even among tho&s;e who are grown hoa|ry in the trade of man&s;tealing, or of bartering "brandy and baubles" for human fle&s;h and blood; that would not execrate the character of him to who&s;e power of &s;ubtilty he had fallen a victim for fimilar purpo&s;es, and that would not pronounce him <HI>worthy of death.</HI></P>
<P>Now, if this law of the Lord, given to the ancient Hebrews, be founded on a &s;trictly moral principle; if it re&s;t on the broad ba&s;is of com|mon rectitude, of ju&s;tice, and of humanity; as the man&s;tealer him&s;elf de&s;erves to die for his fla|gitious crime, the <HI>purcha&s;er</HI> of tho&s;e who are be|come the victims of his avarice, cannot be ac|counted innocent. <HI>Innnoent!</HI> far from it! For his known, or, at lea&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ed readine&s;s to
<PB N="8" REF="024128_0008_0FC3B3BBABF20000">buy unoffending fellow-creatures, is generally the <HI>principal</HI> motive to the commi&s;&s;ion of the horrid theft. There is a vulgar &s;aying, "If there were no receivers, there would be no thieves." It is on the principle of that old ob&s;ervation the cri|minal law of this country proceeds, in puni&s;h|ing the purcha&s;ers of &s;tolen goods, knowing them to be &s;tolen: and it is much to be lamented, that this part of our criminal code &s;hould have no force, relative to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, who purcha&s;e on the coa&s;ts of Africa, not a little de&s;picable property, but innocent <HI>per&s;ons,</HI> knowing, or hav|ing the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible pre&s;umptive rea&s;on to believe, that they were &s;tolen! How in&s;ulting to moral ju&s;tice, and how affronting to common &s;en&s;e, that tho&s;e very per&s;ons who, in England, would be flogged at the cart's tail, or perhaps tran&s;ported to Botany Bay, for &s;ecretly purcha&s;|ing five &s;hillings worth of property, knowing it to have been &s;tolen, &s;hould have it in their pow|er publicly to buy and &s;ell whole families of &s;to|len, innocent Africans, with complete impuni|ty, and without violating any prohibitory law of the land! As if rectitude and robbery were local things! the former lo&s;ing its re&s;pectability, and the latter its turpitude, whenever the li|berty and the lives of harmle&s;s Negroes become the object of Briti&s;h avarice! Or as if it were equally con&s;i&s;tent with private ju&s;tice and nati|onal honour, actually to fit out a number of &s;hips, furni&s;hed with manacles, chains, and fet|ters, for cargoes of harmle&s;s men and women; as it is for the Greenland traders to equip others,
<PB N="9" REF="024128_0009_0FC3B3BD2E30CC70">for the capturing and &s;towage of all that is va|luable in whales and &s;eals!&mdash;It being apparent then, that the law under con&s;ideration re&s;ts on a moral ground, I &s;hall proceed to &s;how,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, <HI>That though God, in certain ca&s;es, permitted the I&s;realites to purcha&s;e their fellow-creatures for &s;ervitude; yet that purcha&s;e and &s;er|vitude were attended with &s;uch re&s;trictions, as rendered them e&s;&s;entially different from the Euro|rean Slave-Trade and its con&s;equences.</HI></P>
<P>There were two ca&s;es in which an I&s;raelite him&s;elf might, according to divine law, be &s;old into a &s;tate of &s;ervitude. The&s;e were, <HI>theft</HI> and <HI>in&s;olvency.</HI> Relative to the <HI>former,</HI> the Mo&s;aic &s;tatute runs thus: <HI>If a man &s;hall &s;teal an ox, or a &s;heep, and kill it, or &s;ell it; he &s;hall re&s;tore five oxen for an ox, and four &s;heep for a &s;heep&mdash; If a thief have nothing, then he &s;hall be &s;old for his theft.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> xxii. 1&mdash;4.</NOTE> Here it is manife&s;t the laws of the Hebrews had &s;uch a regard for per&s;onal free|dom, that even a <HI>thief</HI> was not con&s;idered as a proper &s;ubject of &s;ale and &s;ervitude, except he was unable to make the appointed re&s;titution.</P>
<P>The Mo&s;aic &s;tatutes permitted <HI>in&s;olvent</HI> debt|ors to be &s;old for the benefit of their creditors: but then the &s;ervitude to which &s;uch debtors were obliged, was far from being oppre&s;&s;ive and cruel. For thus runs the law of the ca&s;e: <HI>If thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be &s;old unto thee; thou &s;halt not comple him to &s;erve as a</HI> BOND-SERVANT, <HI>but as an</HI> HIRED
<PB N="10" REF="024128_0010_0FC3B3BEA96248B8"><HI>&s;ervant, and as a &s;ojourner, he &s;hall be with thee, and &s;hall &s;erve thee to the year of jubile; and then &s;hall he depart from thee, both he and his children with him, and &s;hall return unto his own family, and unto the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of his father &s;hall he return. Thou &s;halt not rule over him with</HI> RIGOR, <HI>but &s;halt fear thy God.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lev.</HI> xxv. 39&mdash;43. <HI>See</HI> 2 <HI>Kings</HI> iv. 1. <HI>Matt.</HI> xviii. 24, 25.</NOTE> So &s;trictly, in this ca&s;e, did the divine law guard again&s;t &s;everity and oppre&s;&s;ion in the &s;ervitude! Be&s;ides, the duration of that &s;ervitude, both in regard to theft and in&s;olvency, was at the longe&s;t expre&s;sly limited to &s;ix years. For thus it is written: <HI>If thou buy an Hebrew &s;ervant, &s;ix years &s;hall he &s;erve; and in the &s;e|venth he &s;hall go out free for nothing.</HI> Nay, re|&s;pecting tho&s;e who had been &s;old for debt, it is in another place, enacted: <HI>When thou &s;ende&s;t him out free from three, thou &s;halt not let him go away empty; thou &s;halt furni&s;h him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy wine|pre&s;s; of that wherewith the Lord thy God hath ble&s;&s;ed thee, thou &s;halt give unto him.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exed.</HI> xxi. 2. <HI>Deut.</HI> xv. 12&mdash;15.</NOTE> How dif|ferent all this from the laws relating to &s;lavery in the We&s;t-India i&s;lands! It is evident, there|fore, that the &s;ervitude to which any of Abra|ham's natural po&s;terity were expo&s;ed, was not, properly &s;peaking, <HI>&s;lavery;</HI> and much le&s;s was it &s;imilar to that which is endured by many thou|&s;ands of Negroes in our &s;ugar i&s;lands.</P>
<P>The &s;tate and circum&s;tances of certain Gen|tiles
<PB N="11" REF="024128_0011_0FC3B3CA0604EC90">among the ancient Hebrews, now claim our &s;erious con&s;ideration; becau&s;e the &s;ituation of tho&s;e Heathens, and the Mo&s;aic law re&s;pecting them, afford the mo&s;t plau&s;ible argument that can be deduced from the Scripture, in favor of We&s;t-India &s;lavery Relative to this ca&s;e the law of Jehovah &s;ays: <HI>Both thy bondmen and thy bond|maids, which thou &s;halt have, &s;hall be of the Hea|then that are round about you, of them &s;hall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids. Moreover, of the children of the &s;trangers that do &s;ojourn among you, of them &s;hall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lev.</HI> xxv. 44, 45.</NOTE>&mdash; On this divine &s;tatute it may be remarked, that it did not <HI>require,</HI> but only <HI>permit,</HI> the I&s;rael|ites to purcha&s;e Heathens for a lower degree of &s;ervitude than that in which any Hebrew might be employed. That is, if they held bond &s;er|vants at all, tho&s;e meane&s;t of &s;ervants mu&s;t be had from among the Gentiles. This law did not warrant the I&s;raelites to go by &s;ea or land to a far di&s;tant country, as the &s;lave-merchants now do, to purcha&s;e their fellow-creatures for &s;ervi|tude; but ordered, if they made any &s;uch pur|cha&s;e, that it &s;hould be either of the &s;trangers who &s;ojourned among them; or of the petty Heathen &s;tates that were around them. The bond&s;ervice permitted by this law, could not, with the lea&s;t appearance of rea&s;on, be &s;o un|der&s;tood by the Hebrews, as to think them&s;elves warranted to exerci&s;e oppre&s;&s;ion and cruelty up|on
<PB N="12" REF="024128_0012_0FC3B3CABA434880">their Gentile &s;ervants; becau&s;e, to treat &s;tran|gers of any de&s;cription in that manner, was mo&s;t expre&s;sly and repeatedly forbidden<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exed.</HI> xxii. 21. xxiii. 9. <HI>Lev.</HI> xxv. 35. <HI>Deut.</HI> x. 17.18.19. xxiv. 14, 15, 17. xxvii. 19.&mdash; <HI>Ezek.</HI> xxii. 7.</NOTE>. So far was divine law, relative to the treatment of either males or females in a &s;tate of &s;ervitude, from au|thorizing an offended ma&s;ter to exerci&s;e cruelty upon their per&s;ons, that its language is: <HI>If a man &s;mite the eye of his &s;ervant, or the eye of his maid, that it peri&s;h,</HI> HE SHALL LET HIM GO FREE FOR HIS EYE'S SAKE. <HI>And if he &s;mite out his man-&s;ervant's tooth, or his maid-&s;ervant's tooth;</HI> HE SHALL LET HIM GO FREE FOR HIS TOOTH'S SAKE.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> xxi. 26, 27.</NOTE> Again: <HI>He that killeth</HI> ANY MAN, <HI>&s;hall &s;urely be put to death.

<P>There is great rea&s;on to conclude, that the divine permi&s;&s;ion which is under our notice, was limited to the remains of tho&s;e Canaaniti&s;h nati|ons, the extermination of which had been con|&s;igned to I&s;rael. To this conclu&s;ion we are led by the following con&s;iderations. Divine law, as already ob&s;erved, was far from authorizing the cho&s;en tribes to vi&s;it di&s;tant continents, in order to capture or to purcha&s;e their fellow-creatures,
<PB N="13" REF="024128_0013_0FC3B3CC33AC7848">either for their own u&s;e, or to barter with other nations; making commerce in the human &s;pe|cies an e&s;tabli&s;hed article of their trade, which, to our immorral infamy, is now the ca&s;e with us. No: the attention of the I&s;raelites, re&s;pect|ing this in&s;tance of Jehovah's plea&s;ure, was di|rected to the neighbouring Gentile &s;tates, and to them only. Though the natives of Gentile nations in general, when re&s;iding among the I&s;|raelites, were denominated <HI>&s;trangers;</HI> and tho' none of them were to be treated with cruelty, yet the Mo&s;aic laws did not con&s;ider them as all on a level, or as equally entitled to the benevo|lence of the Hebrews. For while God permit|ted &s;ome of tho&s;e aliens to be purcha&s;ed and placed in the &s;tate of <HI>bond&s;ervants,</HI> which was expre&s;sly prohibited, with regard to any I&s;rael|ite; he required, in the very &s;ame chapter, that others of them, if oppre&s;&s;ed with poverty, &s;hould experience all that compa&s;&s;ion which was due to the de&s;cendants of Abraham, when in a &s;imilar &s;ituation. Re&s;pecting this particular, the law was: <HI>If thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee, then thou &s;halt relieve him; yea, though he be a</HI> STRANJER, <HI>or a</HI> SOJOURNER, <HI>that he may live with thee</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lev.</HI> xxv. 35.</NOTE> Hence ari&s;es no &s;mall degree of pre&s;umptive evidence, that none but &s;trangers of the Canaaniti&s;h race were to be pur|cha&s;ed for <HI>bond&s;ervants.</HI> It does not appear, that the I&s;raelites were warned by their Eternal Sovereign, to carry their arms into di&s;tant coun|tries,
<PB N="14" REF="024128_0014_0FC3B3CDA5F2A920">except when tho&s;e countries were the ag|gre&s;&s;ors. Their commi&s;&s;ion to invade, to &s;ub|jugate, or to de&s;troy, was limited, if I be not under a great mi&s;take, to the flagitious inhabi|tants of the land; which, by a divine grant, had been expre&s;sly con&s;igned to Abraham and his po&s;terity. It is natural to conclude, there|fore, that the law which authorized the de&s;cend|ants of Abraham to purcha&s;e fellow-creatures of the Heathens around them for <HI>bond&s;ervants,</HI> had its operation limited to the remains of tho&s;e Ca|naaniti&s;h nations. The hi&s;tory of the Gibeonites is, if I mi&s;take not, perfectly conformable to this view of the ca&s;e. Tho&s;e Hivites con&s;tituted a part of the Cannaniti&s;h nations whom God had ordered to be &s;ubdued. Alarmed with appre|hen&s;ions of impending ruin, they, by an act of deception, made a league with I&s;rael, pre&s;erved their own lives, and were permitted to dwell among the cho&s;en people: but, as an expre&s;&s;ion of re&s;entment again&s;t their di&s;ingenuity, and as a mark of their being part of tho&s;e nations again&s;t whom the &s;everity of puni&s;hment had been denounced, they were placed in a &s;tate of inferiority, and occupied in mean employments.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;hua <HI>ix.</HI></NOTE> We find, however, that when Saul had treated their po&s;terity with cruelty, the divine anger was rou&s;ed; and God was offended with David, for not having avenged that cruelty in a more early art of his reign.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxi.</NOTE> We have another in&s;tance much to our purpo&s;e, in the reign of David's

<P>As the ca&s;e of tho&s;e Canaaniti&s;h Heathens is the only thing which, in the law of Mo&s;es, and in the authorized conduct of the I&s;raelites, bears almo&s;t any re&s;emblance to that per&s;onal &s;lavery again&s;t which I plead; it may be expedient, briefly to enquire into the rea&s;ons of it. Be it
<PB N="16" REF="024128_0016_0FC3B3D0C5B5D290">ob&s;erved then, that God, being the Creator of all things, is the univer&s;al Proprietor.

Mankind having revolted from God, and rebelled again&s;t him, they have univer&s;ally forfeited their all to Eternal Ju&s;tice. God may therefore ju&s;tly deprive them of their property, their liberty, or their lives, according to his own &s;overeign plea&s;ure, without being ac|countable to any of his creatures.

He was perfectly at liberty, there|fore, to permit the I&s;raelites to purcha&s;e tho&s;e Canaanites for <HI>bond&s;ervants,</HI> and to inflict &s;uch hard&s;hips upon them as he plea&s;ed. Nay, he might not only permit, but expre&s;sly <HI>command</HI> them, to treat tho&s;e devoted people in &s;uch a manner as would have been enormou&s;ly criminal, detached from that command. Thus, for in|&s;tance, it would have been highly criminal for the I&s;raelites to have invaded the Canaaniti&s;h country, had not he who is the Univer&s;al Pro|prietor, and Ab&s;olute Sovereign, ordered them
<PB N="17" REF="024128_0017_0FC3B3D232E720C0">&s;o to do. But, as that land was his own; as, by a divine grant, it had been con&s;igned to A|braham's po&s;terity; and as the tribes of Jacob were ordered to invade the country, to &s;ubdue its inhabitants, and to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, their con|duct in &s;o doing was lawful.

But he, by who&s;e command they were to be extirpated, was equally at liberty to order their execution by the &s;word of I&s;rael, as to have de&s;troyed them by an earth|quake, by the pe&s;tilence, or, as in the ca&s;e of Sodom, by fire from heaven.&mdash;It is on this ground, as I conceive, that the Mo&s;aic laws re|lative to <HI>bond&s;ervants</HI> proceed; the degrading &s;er|vice it&s;elf being &s;ubjected to the fore-mentioned limitations&mdash;I mu&s;t now &s;how,</P>
<P>THIRDLY, <HI>That &s;uppo&s;ing God had permitted the I&s;raeliti&s;h people to traffic in the human &s;pecies, and to en&s;lave the Gentiles in a much greater de|gree than he did, it would not have authorized the conduct of Europeans towards the Africans.</HI></P>
<P>To prove and illu&s;trate this po&s;ition, the follow|ing particulars may not be impertinent. The I&s;raelites, as a body politic, were the peculiar people of God, in di&s;tinction from all other na|tions then upon earth. But this is not the ca&s;e, with any people now in the world. While the Mo&s;aic Di&s;pen&s;ation continued, that &s;ingular and high prerogative was exclu&s;ively enjoyed by the Jews: but when the Chri&s;tian Economy was
<PB N="18" REF="024128_0018_0FC3B3D3B2587D20">e&s;tabli&s;hed, that prerogative cea&s;ed; nor did any other nation &s;ucceed to the honour. If the Engli&s;h, for in&s;tance, the Dutch, the French, or the Spaniards, were to claim the privilege; it would behove them to produce the divine char|ter by which it was granted. But it is manife&s;t that no &s;uch authority can be adduced. God, un|der that &s;ublime&s;t of all names, JEHOVAH, was not only the object of religious wor&s;hip to the cho&s;en people; but al&s;o their political monarch. The whole &s;tatute law of that kingdom, as well judicial, as moral and religious, was of his en|acting: and on the ob&s;erving that &s;y&s;tem of law which was promulgated by Jehovah, their nati|onal happine&s;s depended. Now it is plain from what has been &s;aid, that the divine &s;tatute which authorized the Hebrews to purcha&s;e per&s;ons of the nations around them for <HI>bond-&s;ervants,</HI> be|longed to the judicial part of their legal code. But what nation pretends now to be governed by a &s;y&s;tem of law that is divine, or to have Je|hovah for its political &s;overeign? The Cana|aniti&s;h country was, by Jehovah, expre&s;sly given to the I&s;raelites for their inheritance; which ren|dered it lawful for them to conquer and po&s;&s;e&s;s it. But what nation in Europe has the lea&s;t pre|tence to a divine grant of any particular di&s;trict on the African continent? Divine ju&s;tice doom|ed the profligate and impious Canaaniti&s;h nati|ons to de&s;truction, or to a low &s;tate of &s;ubjuga|tion; and Abraham's po&s;terity were expre&s;sly appointed to execute the &s;entence. But to which of the European powers has God committed the
<PB N="19" REF="024128_0019_0FC3B3D52D9B9150">execution of &s;imilar judgments upon the Afri|cans? Tho&s;e whom Jehovah permitted his peo|ple to buy, for a comparative degree of &s;lave|ry, were to be, either Canaanites re&s;iding among them, or per&s;ons of the &s;ame de&s;cription in the nations around them. But will this warrant our having recour&s;e to a di&s;tant continent, for the purpo&s;e of purcha&s;ing and en&s;laving its innocent inhabitants? Tho&s;e Gentiles whom God permit|ted the Hebrews to buy, were to be employed in low &s;ervices among them&s;elves. But will this ju&s;|tify the Engli&s;h, or any commercial people, in purcha&s;ing Negroes and &s;elling them to other na|tions? The <HI>former</HI> were treated as <HI>men,</HI> who, in the divine e&s;timation, had forfeited the rights of citizens; but the <HI>latter,</HI> like <HI>bea&s;ts</HI> of burden, or as articles of mere commerce. Canaaniti&s;h bond-&s;ervants, among the I&s;raelites, were under the protection of divine law, which prohibited the exerci&s;e of cruelty upon them. But will any defender of We&s;t-India &s;lavery pretend, that our Colonial laws afford an equal degree of protecti|on to the poor Negroes?</P>
<P>Again: The ancient di&s;tinction between Jews and Gentiles being entirely aboli&s;hed, by the di|vine e&s;tabli&s;hment of Chri&s;tianity, tho&s;e preroga|tives that were peculiar to Judai&s;m and its profe&s;|&s;ors, do not now exi&s;t: among which preroga|tives, the right of purcha&s;ing Gentiles for bond-&s;ervants is to be cla&s;&s;ed. Con&s;equently, it is now as criminal and wicked for Europeans, either to &s;teal, or to purcha&s;e and &s;ell, the innocent Afri|cans for &s;laves, as it would have been for the I&s;|raelites
<PB N="20" REF="024128_0020_0FC3B3D6A6CE7E78">to have &s;tolen, &s;old, and en&s;laved one an|other: which, neverthele&s;s, as appears from our text it&s;elf, was ab&s;olutely forbidden under the &s;evere&s;t of all temporal penalties. Nay, &s;uppo&s;|ing our own countrymen, for in&s;tance, could prove, that they have &s;ucceeded to the ancient I&s;raeliti&s;h prerogative re&s;pecting this matter; yet, from the particulars adduced in the preceding paragraph, it is apparent, that their conduct would &s;tand condemned by the Mo&s;aic law. This would be more &s;trikingly evident &s;till, were I to lay before you the decetiful arts and iniquitous violence which are frequently u&s;ed to obtain the poor Africans in their own country&mdash;the cruel manner in which they are &s;towed on board the &s;hips, when tran&s;ported to the We&s;t-India i&s;lands; the brutal mode of expo&s;ing them to &s;ale when there&mdash;the inhuman &s;eparation of brothers and &s;i&s;ters, of parents and children, of hu&s;bands and wives, on that infamous occa&s;ion&mdash;and the cru|elty with which they are generally treated, when employed in the &s;ugar i&s;lands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an Ab&s;tract of the Evidence before a Se|lect Committee of the Hou&s;e of Commons, relative to the Slave-Trade.</NOTE>.

<P>Further: Suppo&s;ing the lawfulne&s;s of purcha&s;|ing
<PB N="21" REF="024128_0021_0FC3B3D824BA86E0">and of en&s;laving our innocent fellow-crea|tures were granted, it would be natural to a&s;k&mdash;For <HI>whom</HI> is it lawful, and on <HI>what de&s;cription</HI> of unoffending per&s;ons does the exerci&s;e of that de&s;|potic right fall? Is it lawful for the Engli&s;h, the French, the Europeans in general, to buy and en|&s;lave the Africans? But whence did they, rather than tho&s;e very Africans, derive that dreadful right? I &s;ay, <HI>dreadful</HI> right. For the idea of any individual, or of any people, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing au|thority to treat the innocent as if they were fla|gitiou&s;ly guilty, is hateful, and &s;hocking to rea|&s;on, to con&s;cience, and to common &s;en&s;e.&mdash;Whence, then, I demand, is that authority de|rived? From the Europeans profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;ti|anity, the Africans in que&s;tion being Pagans?&mdash;But, as tho&s;e Pagans are men, are neighbours, are brethren of the human kind, &s;o Chri&s;tianity is the religion of truth and ju&s;tice, of benevo|lence, and of peace. It in&s;pires them by whom it is known, and not di&s;graced, with love to God and love to their neighbours: Whereas the <HI>traffic in</HI> MAN is unju&s;t and cruel, is barbarous and &s;avage. Does, then, the right in que&s;tion originate in divine law, as given to the ancient I&s;raelites? but tho&s;e laws that were peculiar to the Hebrew theocracy, have long been ob&s;olete; nor, were they in full force, would the pre&s;ent MAN-<HI>trade</HI> be countenanced by them. As to that part of the Jewi&s;h law, which is properly and &s;trictly &s;peaking <HI>moral,</HI> the obligation of which extends to all mankind in every age; it forbids nothing to an African, that is equitable
<PB N="22" REF="024128_0022_0FC3B3D9B2B83120">in the conduct of a European. It knows no more of a <HI>white</HI> man buying and en&s;laving a <HI>black</HI> one, than it does of the <HI>latter</HI> &s;o treating the <HI>former.</HI> In its impartial e&s;timate, and under its command|ing power, Africans and Europeans, Pagans and Chri&s;tians, are all on a level. Mu&s;t the right under con&s;ideration, then, be inferred from what is called the law of <HI>nature?</HI> But that is the &s;ame in Africa, as it is in Europe; entirely the &s;ame all over the globe. According to this law, be the &s;tation of an <HI>innocent</HI> Negro ever &s;o ob&s;cure, his poverty ever &s;o great, his manners ever &s;o rude, or his mental capacities ever &s;o contract|ed, he has an equal claim to per&s;onal liberty with any man upon earth. For the rights of humanity being common to the whole of our &s;pecies, are the &s;ame in every part of the world.</P>
<P>It follows, therefore, that if the lawfulne&s;s of purcha&s;ing innocent per&s;ons for the mo&s;t degrad|ing and cruel &s;lavery exi&s;t among men, it mu&s;t be a common right, and equally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by all nations: nor can the exerci&s;e of it have any li|mitation from principles of a <HI>moral</HI> nature. No limits can be here a&s;&s;igned, except tho&s;e of power, of policy, or of inclination. It would, con&s;e|quently, be quite as equitable, benevolent, and humane, for the Africans, laden with produce of their own country, annually to vi&s;it our Engli&s;h ports, as we do theirs, and for &s;imilar purpo&s;es. Yes, they might, if it were in their power, with equal ju&s;tice, and with le&s;s di&s;honour, fit out an hundred and eighty, or two hundred &s;hips, for the port of London, of Bri&s;tol, and of Liver|pool&mdash;&s;hips

<P>Once more: Were the conduct of our man-merchants lawful, neither the principles of mo|rality,
<PB N="24" REF="024128_0024_0FC3B3DCA813B460">nor tho&s;e of religon, could lie in the way of their buying, and &s;elling for &s;laves, the in|nocent natives of Holland or France, or any other neighbouring nation. For as it is impo&s;|&s;ible to prove, that the natural rights of hu|manity are not equally &s;acred in Africa, as they are in Europe; &s;o the cruel and bloody hand of rapacity might with equal ju&s;tice lay hold of the Dutchman, or the Frenchman, as of the &s;war|thy Guineaman. Nor, other things being equal, is there the lea&s;t rea&s;on for us to imagine, that the white &s;kin of a European would afford any more protection again&s;t a violent &s;eizure, than does the black &s;kin of an African. No: had the trader in <HI>man</HI> an equal opportunity of grati|fying his cruel avarice; were he equally &s;ure of impunity, and no more expo&s;ed to infamy, in the one ca&s;e than in the other; the &s;ame di&s;re|gard to ju&s;tice, and the &s;ame principle of ava|rice, would have a &s;imilar operation on the per|&s;ons of neighbouring Europeans, as they have on the poor Negroes.

Yet &s;uch are the Negro Trade and its con&s;equences, that the mo&s;t diabolical malice, which ever exi&s;ted in the heart of man again&s;t his bittere&s;t enemy, could &s;carce|ly contrive or with more aggravated mi&s;ery to befall him in this life, than that under which

<P>Again: <HI>All things what&s;oever ye would, that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them,</HI> is another of our Lord's precepts.

<P><HI>All things what&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them.</HI> This has been
<PB N="28" REF="024128_0028_0FC3B3E2B2681938">frequently called, THE GOLDEN RULE. It re|commends it&s;elf to every man's rea&s;on and con|&s;cience, as completely wi&s;e and good. Every one implicitly appeals to it as worthy of the highe&s;t regard, when his own rights are violated by his neighbour: nor mu&s;t even the Negro merchants, or the &s;lave-holders, be con&s;idered as in&s;en&s;ible to the excellence of this moral precept, when their own per&s;ons, families, or intere&s;ts, are con|cerned. For who among all the traders in man, and holders of &s;laves, would think him&s;elf treat|ed with equity, were he, after having been kid|napped by a villain, to find his bones and &s;inews, his bowels and blood, expo&s;ed to &s;ale, and act|ually purcha&s;ed by one who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion it was to <HI>trade in the per&s;ons of men?</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ezek.</HI> xxvii. 13.</NOTE> Mu&s;t not his in|dignation ri&s;e, and would he not prefer in&s;tant death to a life of &s;lavery, if an apprehen&s;ion of eternal fire did not forbid? Nay, would not his indignation and angui&s;h be greatly heightened, if po&s;&s;ible, were his affectionate wife and his dutiful children in the &s;ame &s;ituation; ju&s;t go|ing to be &s;eparated, and never more to &s;ee one another? The very thought of &s;uch a cata&s;tro|phe &s;tings with di&s;tre&s;s; and yet if any man upon earth de&s;erves to be &s;o treated, it mu&s;t be he who has made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to buy and to en|&s;lave his innocent fellow-creatures.</P>
<P><HI>To the</HI> DOCTRINE <HI>of Chri&s;t.</HI> This doctrine is denominated <HI>the go&s;pel,</HI> or <HI>glad tidings,</HI> by way of eminence. Yes, my Brethren, it is glad
<PB N="29" REF="024128_0029_0FC3B3E42A9E1478">tidings of pardon, of peace, and of life eternal, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for peri&s;hing &s;inners.&mdash; The go&s;pel, &s;trictly &s;o called, is the doctrine of divine benevolence to man; of mercy to the mi&s;erable, and of grace to the unworthy. It reveals Je&s;us Chri&s;t as <HI>coming into the world to &s;ave &s;inners.</HI> Its whole bu&s;ine&s;s is with tho&s;e that are ju&s;tly condemned by divine law, and who de|&s;erve to peri&s;h. In this gracious go&s;pel the Lord Redeemer addre&s;&s;es Jews and Gentiles, Europe|ans and Africans, without any difference; and his charming language is, <HI>Look unto Me, and he ye &s;aved, all ye ends of the earth. Come unto Me, all ye that labour, and and are heavy laden, and I will give you re&s;t. Him that cometh unto Me, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out.</HI> Such are the benign import, and the benevolent de&s;ign of our Lord's doctrine! Con&s;equently, its natural tendency mu&s;t be to produce and promote love to God, and love to man. But nothing can be more in|imical to that devout and kind affection, than the buying, the &s;elling, and the en&s;laving of our in|nocent fellow-creatures. For that commerce and &s;lavery originate in the ba&s;e&s;t avarice; are car|ried on by inju&s;tice and cruelty, and i&s;&s;ue in the mi&s;ery and murder of thou&s;ands, who have an equal claim to liberty and to happine&s;s with our|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Were you, my Brethren, mutually to con&s;i|der the character of a <HI>Slave Merchant,</HI> it would be &s;ound, I pre&s;ume, to include the following particulars. He is, by profe&s;&s;ion, a buyer and &s;eller of men, women, and children. If not a
<PB N="30" REF="024128_0030_0FC3B3E5A912D0F8">kidnapper him&s;elf, he encourages, rewards, and rejoices in the practice: for without it his trade would be at a &s;tand. In&s;tead of delighting in the dome&s;tic happine&s;s of others, univer&s;ally, he makes it his bu&s;ine&s;s violently to &s;eparate the neare&s;t and deare&s;t relatives: for conjugal, pa|rental, and fraternal ties, are by him di&s;&s;olved without the lea&s;t remor&s;e. So far is he from &s;ympathizing with widows and orphans, as &s;uch, in their afflictions, that the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of multi|tudes under tho&s;e characters, ari&s;e from his ra|pacity. Such is the nature of his employment, that it cannot &s;ucceed, without his fellow-crea|tures being deprived of their mo&s;t &s;acred natu|ral rights: becau&s;e, for numbers to be dive&s;ted of their per&s;onal freedom, their mental tranqili|ty, their &s;ocial connections, their bodily ea&s;e, and their pittance of property, is e&s;&s;ential to the joy of his gain. His profe&s;&s;ion is, as a man of bu&s;ine&s;s, to provide victims for abject &s;lavery, for pinching want, for capricious cruelty, for dark de&s;pair, and for untimely death, in its va|rious forms. His trade, as well as his profits, mu&s;t cea&s;e, except he diver&s;ify and propagate human mi&s;ery. He may call him&s;elf a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> or a di&s;ciple of Him that <HI>went about doing good;</HI> but the amiable character is profaned by his traf|fic in man: for it becomes none but a &s;avage, or a votary of Moloch. He may, po&s;&s;ibly, de|&s;erve commendation for the exerci&s;e of benevo|lent affections in his own family, and in the neighbourhood where he re&s;ides; but, con&s;ider|ed as a <HI>trader in</HI> MAN, he declares war again&s;t
<PB N="31" REF="024128_0031_0FC3B3F1866DC850">the dignity and happine&s;s of his own &s;pecies; he in&s;ults the laws of his Maker, and &s;u&s;tains a character, that is completely fitted for univer&s;al abhorrence. So enormou&s;ly criminal are the trade and the &s;lavery under our notice, that, had they commenced among Britons but a few years ago, and been practi&s;ed only by five or &s;ix merchants and planters, the conduct of tho&s;e concerned would have met with general execra|tion; their characters would have been &s;tigma|tized with public infamy; and all intimacy with them would have been &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided by every per&s;on of decent morals. Nay, had the MAN-trade, the &s;lavery con&s;equent upon it, and the execrable wickedne&s;s of both, been of &s;o re|cent a date, practi&s;ed by &s;o few, and the ini|quitous tran&s;actions laid open to public view, as they now are, there is rea&s;on to conclude, that various articles of commerce, produced by the &s;weat, and groans, and tears of the poor Negroes, would have been con&s;idered by Britons as tinged with human blood. Did the man af|ter God's own heart, on a certain occa&s;ion, &s;ay, <HI>Is not thie the blood of the men that went and jeo|parded their lives?</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxiii. 15, 16, 17.</NOTE> &s;o, it is probable, the ge|nerality of our countrymen would have &s;aid, re|&s;pecting certain &s;pecies of We&s;t-India produce; <HI>Are not the&s;e the</HI> BLOOD <HI>of innocent men, that have been &s;tolen, and bought, and &s;old, and treat|ed like brutes?</HI> It behoves us to remember, how|ever, that a &s;y&s;tem of iniquity is not &s;anctified by
<PB N="32" REF="024128_0032_0FC3B3F27004A9E0">its inveteracy, nor yet by the multitudes concern|ed in it. Evidently, therefore, does it appear, that the commerce and &s;lavery of which I &s;peak, are ab&s;olutely inimical to the precepts of Chri&s;t, and to the whole &s;cope of his doctrine, as might be more largely proved, would time permit.</P>
<P>As our Engli&s;h &s;eaports, Liverpool and Bri&s;tol, are infamou&s;ly con&s;picuous in modern times, for their trading in the per&s;ons and rights of men, &s;o were Tyre and Zidon, in the ages of remote antiquity. Let us hear, then, what Jehovah &s;ays to the inhuman, though opulent merchants of tho&s;e ancient cities. Thus run the divine re|mon&s;trance, and the awful prediction: <HI>What have ye to do with me, O Tyre and Zidon, and all the coa&s;ts of Pale&s;tine? Will ye render me a recompence? and if ye recompence me, &s;wiftly and &s;peedily will I return your recompence upon your own head: becau&s;e&mdash;the children al&s;o of Judah and the children of Jeru&s;alem, have ye</HI> SOLD <HI>un|to the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border. Behold! I will rai&s;e them out of the place whither ye have &s;old them, and will return your recompence upon your own head: and I will</HI> SELL <HI>your &s;ons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they &s;hall &s;ell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off: for the Lord hath &s;poken it</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> iii. 4&mdash;8. <HI>Compare Ezek.</HI> xxvii. <HI>Rev.</HI> xviii. 10&mdash;13.</NOTE> Such was Jehovah's de|termination again&s;t Tyre and Zidon, the Li|verpool and Bri&s;tol of ancient times!</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="024128_0033_0FC3B3F400798D30">
It may perhaps be objected, Per&s;onal flavery, though authorized by the laws of Greece and Rome, and though much practi&s;ed in the apo&s;|tolic times, is no where expre&s;sly condemned in the New Te&s;tament: nay, Chri&s;tian &s;laves are exhorted lo live in peaceable &s;ubjection to their own ma&s;ters. To this it may be replied: Nor was the &s;anguinary de&s;poti&s;m of NERO expre&s;sly condemned; but the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t were commanded to behave peaceably under his go|vernment. The &s;ports of the gladiators, autho|rized by the Roman laws, were extremely bloody and wicked; yet are they no where expre&s;sly condemned by the Apo&s;tles. Numerous are the &s;pecies of di&s;hone&s;ty and theft, which are com|mon among us, and perhaps were &s;o among peo|ple in tho&s;e times; which, neverthele&s;s, are not expre&s;sly forbidden in the New Te&s;tament. But, as all the&s;e things are breaches of moral duty; and as they are all incon&s;i&s;tent with that regard which is due to our neighbour's happine&s;s, it is quite &s;ufficient, that they are implicitly and &s;trongly forbidden by general moral principles, and by requi&s;itions of a contrary conduct. Any man of common &s;en&s;e, who&s;e mind is not bi|a&s;&s;ed by &s;elf-intere&s;t, may ea&s;ily infer, from the general principles, commands and prohibitions of Chri&s;tianity, that &s;tealing an innocent man mu&s;t be the wor&s;t of rapine; that buying &s;uch a kidnapped per&s;on is ju&s;tifying the robbery; and that actually en&s;laving him, gives a &s;anction to tho&s;e infamous deeds, by putting a fini&s;hing hand
<PB N="34" REF="024128_0034_0FC3B3F56E5367D0">to the work of inju&s;tice. Be&s;ides, as an expre&s;s prohibition of &s;lavery might have exeited a more violent oppo&s;ition to the Chri&s;tian cau&s;e, than almo&s;t any thing with which it had to conflict, &s;o, neither the doctrine of Chri&s;t, nor the &s;pi|ritual nature of his kingdom, require it. If the gracious go&s;pel found per&s;ons in a &s;tate of &s;lave|ny, whether civil or per&s;onal, it relieved their con&s;ciences, and cheered their hearts; but it made no altenation re&s;pecting that &s;lavery. The &s;ubject of a tyrannical civil governor continued to be a &s;ubject; and the &s;lave of a private ma&s;|ter continued to be a &s;lave; except the governor and the ma&s;ter became acquainted with their own duty, and willing, to perform it.</P>
<P>Having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed my &s;ubject according to the plan propo&s;ed, I &s;hall now conclude with a few exhortations relative to our own duty. As being profe&s;&s;edly the followers of Chri&s;t, and the friends of mankind, I would exhort you, my Bretheren, <HI>carne&s;tly and frequently to pray for the interpo&s;ition of Providence to aboli&s;h the dete&s;table traffic in man.</HI> That it is our indi&s;pen&s;able duty to pray for the enlargement of our Lord's vi&s;ible kingdom among men, is plain; that the de&s;pi&s;ed Africans are na|turally as capable of being made the &s;piritual &s;ub|jects of Je&s;us Chri&s;tias our&s;elves, ought not to be que&s;tioned; and that the Slave-Trade is, at pre|&s;ent, an effectual bar to the propagation of Chri&s;|tianity among them, appears with deci&s;ive evi|dence. Nay, it is an in&s;uperable ob&s;truction to the progne&s;s of civilization among them, and to an honourable commerce with them. Zeal for
<PB N="35" REF="024128_0035_0FC3B3F6E973ADD8">the honour of God, and love for our fellow-creatures, ought therefore to in&s;pire us with ar|dent prayer, that the horrid impediment may be removed, and that Chri&s;t may be glorified among them. Nor ought we to pray, merely that God would aboli&s;h the infamous commerce in man, on the &s;hores of Africa; but al&s;o for the gra|dual emancipation of oppre&s;&s;ed Negroes in the We&s;t-India i&s;tands: that the &s;lavery of innovent per&s;ons may cea&s;e to exi&s;t, and &s;ink under the de|te&s;lation of all Europe. For what mu&s;t the en|&s;laved Africans in tho&s;e i&s;lands think of Chri&s;|tians, of Chri&s;tianity, and of Chri&s;t, under the tuition of their oppre&s;&s;ors?</P>
<P>Again: Let your ardent and frequent pray|ers be <HI>accompauied with prudent, peaceable, and &s;teady efforts, in order to procure the toral aboli|tion of that criminal traffic, and of the cruel &s;la|very con&s;equent upon it.</HI> This is manife&s;tly en|joined by the law of the Lord, <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf.</HI> A divine precept this, which requires us to do to others, as we might rea&s;onably wi&s;h them to treat us, were we in their &s;ituation and they in ours. When re&s;lect|ing on this branch of moral duty, with refe|rence to the ca&s;e before us, I have &s;ometimes been &s;truck with the following &s;uppo&s;ed ca&s;e: I have imagined my&s;elf, my family, and all my deare&s;t &s;ocial connections, with many thou&s;ands of my countrymen, to have been kidnapped, bought, and &s;old into a &s;tate of cruel &s;lavery. I have imagined the inhabitants of my native coun|try in general, to have received authentic infor|mation
<PB N="36" REF="024128_0036_0FC3B3F868CE4DE8">of the iniquitous manner in which we were captured, tran&s;ported into a foreign land, and there en&s;laved. I have &s;till further ima|gined, that extremely few among Britons had any compa&s;&s;ion for us; that only here and there one would remember us in their prayers, or ex|ert any endeavours, either to relieve our di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, or to prevent many thou&s;ands of equally innocent per&s;ons from falling, year after year, into &s;imilar mi&s;eries. I have then &s;uppo&s;ed, that, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, I &s;hould con&s;ider Britons as quite in&s;en&s;ible to the honour of national cha|racter, to the claims of private ju&s;tice, and to the finer feelings of civilized humanity. Nay, I have imagined that, when under paroxi&s;ms of pain, I &s;hould reflect on their mercile&s;s conduct with indignation; con&s;ider them as devoted to the gain of oppre&s;&s;ion; as filling up their mea|&s;ure of national guilt; and as the de&s;tined ob|jects of Divine vengeance.</P>
<P>On the other hand, I have &s;uppo&s;ed all tho&s;e myriads of Negroes in our We&s;t-India i&s;lands, that are groaning under cruel &s;lavery, to be ac|quainted with the true God, and with the pray|ers of thou&s;ands in this country, in order to pro|cure a &s;peedy abolition of the horrid traffic in man on the coa&s;t of Africa, and a total, but <HI>gradual</HI> abolition of &s;lavery in our &s;ugar i&s;lands. I have then thought of the gratitude which mu&s;t, on &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition, abound in the bo&s;oms of tho&s;e Negroes toward their compa&s;&s;ionate friends; of the ten thou&s;and times ten thou&s;and prayers which they mu&s;t addre&s;s to the Father of Mer|cies,
<PB N="37" REF="024128_0037_0FC3B3F9E40C8FB8">that &s;ucce&s;s may attend the cau&s;e of ju&s;|tice and of humanity, in which their friends were &s;incerely engaged; and of the numerous bene|dictione which, from their hearts, they mu&s;t pro|nounce on the per&s;ons, the families, and all the lawful pur&s;uits of tho&s;e who are &s;eeking to do them good.</P>
<P>On my own mind the&s;e thoughts have &s;ome|times made a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion, and have rou&s;ed attention to the natural rights of oppre&s;&s;ed Afri|cans. For though they are ignorant of true God, and unacquainted with our concern to pro|mote their happine&s;s; yet they are <HI>men,</HI> they are <HI>brethren</HI> of the human race: agreeable to that &s;aying, <HI>God hath made of one blood all nati|ons of men.</HI> Few of them, indeed, can either &s;peculate on our conduct re&s;pecting a meliorati|on of their &s;tate, or pray for us; yet they are no le&s;s the proper objects of our benevolence, but rather de&s;erve a greater degree of compa&s;&s;i|on on that account.</P>
<P>As it is our de&s;ign at this time to make a col|lection for promoting the general de&s;ign of that worthy <HI>Society,</HI> which has exi&s;ted for &s;ome years in this Metropolis, in order to <HI>effect the Aboli|tion of the Slave-Trade,</HI> I would earne&s;tly ex|hort you to make a liberal contribution for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The members of that benevolent So|ciety have done worthily. They de&s;erve the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance and the thanks of every friend to moral ju&s;tice, and to humanity. Let us therefore en|deavour to &s;trengthen their hands, and to pro|mote the righteous cau&s;e in which the are unit|ed:
<PB N="38" REF="024128_0038_0FC3B3FB702804A8">not doubting but the wi&s;dom, the rectitude, and the benevolence of our Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature, will ere long be manife&s;ted, in totally aboli&s;hing the Engli&s;h commerce in man; and for provid|ing for the gradual emancipation of Negro Slaves in our We&s;t-India i&s;lands.</P>
<P>To conclude, my Brethren, as each di&s;inte|re&s;ted individual that is tolerably well informed, re&s;pecting the &s;ubject before us, and maturely re|flects upon it, cannot but dete&s;t both the Trade and the Slavery again&s;t which I plead; &s;o every one is bound, by the authority of God, and by the regard which is due to his own immortal intere&s;ts, to guard again&s;t every corruption with|in, and every temptation without, that would render him a &s;lave to &s;in. Becau&s;e it is po&s;&s;ible for a man to be ju&s;t, kind, and humane to his fellow-creatures, while he is under the power of &s;trong di&s;affection to God, and a &s;ubject of Sa|tan's domion. Having the <HI>love of God &s;head abroad in our hearts,</HI> and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the liberty of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, it would be incomparably better for us, after having been bought and &s;old like bea&s;ts, to be &s;laves in the We&s;t-Indies; than to enjoy all the liberties of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, and to conti|nue under the dominion of our own depravity. For, whatever may be our &s;ituation as to &s;ecu|lar bondage, if we do but po&s;&s;e&s;s peace in our con&s;ciences through atoning blood, and freedom from the power of corruption through regene|rating grace, we are freemen of Chri&s;t, and heirs of immortal glory.</P>
