<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE very flattering Reception my <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Roman Commonwealth</HI> has received, has encouraged me to attempt, on the &s;ame plan, and with the &s;ame views, A Hi&s;tory of the Grecian States: tho&s;e States which, though incon&s;iderable in their extent, gave law to the &s;urrounding nations, and brought &s;avage man, who till then wandered in the wilds of igno|rance and barbarity, into the pale of civil &s;ocie|ty, and forced the rude cu&s;toms of &s;avages to yield to the refinements of the polite arts and &s;ciences. Though her lo&s;ty domes are now no longer vi&s;ible, though her &s;tately and mag|nificent cities have been long &s;ince levelled with the earth, and the martial &s;pirit has cea&s;|ed to exi&s;t on Grecian &s;oil; yet the deeds of her Heroes, Legi&s;lators, and Philo&s;ophers, will die only with Time it&s;elf.</P>
<P>After what has been advanced in the Preface to my Roman Hi&s;tory, little need further be &s;aid in apology for this publication. I &s;hall, therefore, only ju&s;t mention the three heroes of my Fronti&s;piece.</P>
<P>HOMER was the mo&s;t celebrated and illu&s;tri|ous of all the Poets of antiquity; and yet we are not certain of what part of Greece he was a native; nor do we know exactly the time of his birth, though he is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have lived about eight hundred and forty years before Chri&s;t. No nation in the world has produced poems comparable to his.</P>
<P><PB REF="026819_0004_1013717E78D06F00">
XENOPHON was &s;o celebrated a Greek Hi&s;to|rian, that they called him the <HI>Attic Bee.</HI> He was a &s;cholar of Socrates, and no le&s;s the war|rior than the &s;cholar. He wrote &s;everal books, of which &s;ome are &s;till in being, and their &s;tile is con&s;idered as a ma&s;ter piece. His Cyropae|dia, which he dedicated to Cyrus, has not its equal.</P>
<P>The character of DEMOSTHENES, the mo&s;t celebrated Athenian Orator, will be found in different parts of this work. We have here only to add, that, when Antipater &s;ucceeded Alexander, he fled to &s;ave his life; and, in or|der to avoid falling into his enemy's hands, he &s;wallowed poi&s;on, which he had prepared and kept for that purpo&s;e in his pen, and &s;o ended his days.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE GRECIAN STATES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>GREECE, in its earlie&s;t infancy, was a combination of little &s;tates, each governed by its re&s;pective &s;overeign, yet all uniting for their mutual &s;afety and general advantage. Their inte&s;tine contentions, however, were carried on with great animo&s;ity; and, as it happens in all petty &s;tates under the domi|nion of a &s;ingle commander, the jealou&s;ies of the princes were a continual cau&s;e of di&s;cord. From this di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ituation, tho&s;e &s;tates, by degrees, began to emerge; a different &s;pirit began to &s;eize the people, and, &s;ick of the con|tentions of their princes, they de&s;ired to be free. A &s;pirit of liberty prevailed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> over Greece, and a general change of government was effected in every part of the country, ex|cept in Macedonia. Thus monarchy gave way to a republican government, which, however, was diver&s;ified into as many various forms as there were different cities, according to the pe|culiar character of each people.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="026819_0010_1013719D992D9A38">
Though the&s;e cities &s;eemed to differ from each other in their laws and intere&s;ts, yet they were united by one common language, one re|ligion, and a national pride, that taught them even to con&s;ider all other nations as barbarous and feeble. Even Egypt it&s;elf, from whence they had derived many of their arts and in&s;ti|tutions, was con&s;idered in a very &s;ubordinate light. To make this union among the &s;tates of Greece &s;till &s;tronger, there were games in|&s;tituted in different parts of the country, with rewards for excellence in every pur&s;uit. The&s;e &s;ports were in&s;tituted for very &s;erious and u&s;eful purpo&s;es: they afforded an opportunity for the &s;everal &s;tates meeting together; they gave them a greater real for their common religion; they exerci&s;ed the youths for the purpo&s;es of war, and encrea&s;ed that vigour and activity, which were then of the utmo&s;t importance in deci|ding the fate of a battle.</P>
<P>Their chief bond of union, however, aro&s;e from the council of the Amphictyons, which was in&s;tituted by Amphictyon, king of Athens, about the year 2500, and was appointed to be heid twice a year at Thermopylae, to delibe|rate for the general good of tho&s;e &s;tates, of who&s;e deputies it was compo&s;ed. The &s;tates, who &s;ent deputies to this council, were twelve, namely, the The&s;&s;alians, the Thebans, the Do|rians, the Ionians, the Perhaabeans, the Mag|nates, the Locrians, the Oetans, the Pthiotes, the Maleans, the Phocians, and the Delopians. Each of the&s;e cities, which had a right to a&s;|&s;i&s;t at the Amphictyonic council, was obliged
<PB N="11" REF="026819_0011_1013719F65B8D858">to &s;end two deputies to every meeting. The one was entitled the Hieroumuemon, who took care of the intere&s;ts of religion; the other was called the Pylagoras, and had in charge the civil intere&s;ts of his community.</P>
<P>This confederacy united the Greeks for a time into a body of great power, and greater emulation. By this a&s;&s;ociation, a country, not half &s;o large as England, was able to di&s;pute the empire of the earth with the mo&s;t powerful monarchs of the world; by this a&s;&s;ociation, they not only made head again&s;t the numerous armies of Per&s;ia, but di&s;per&s;ed, routed, and de&s;troyed them, reducing their pride &s;o low, as to make them &s;ubmit to conditions of peace, as &s;hameful to the conquered as glorious to the conquerors. But, among all the cities of Greece there were two, which by their merit, their valour, and their wi&s;dom, particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves from the re&s;t: the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> were Athens and Lacedaemon. As the&s;e cities &s;erved for examples of bravery or learning to the re&s;t, and as the chief burthen of every &s;o|reign war devolved upon them, we &s;hall pro|ceed to give the reader a general idea of the ge|nius, character, manners, and government, of their re&s;pective inhabitants.</P>
<P>Though the kingdom of Lacedaemon was not &s;o con&s;iderable as that of Athens, yet, as it was of much earlier in&s;titution, it de&s;erves our fir&s;t attention. Lacedaemon was, for a long time, governed with turbolence and oppre&s;|&s;ion, and required the earl of &s;evere lows and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ou. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.

<PB N="12" REF="026819_0012_101371A48961EE88">di&s;cipline were at la&s;t impo&s;ed upon it by Licurgus, one of the fir&s;t and mo&s;t extra|ordinary legi&s;lators that ever appeared among mankind. There is perhaps nothing more re|markable in profane hi&s;tory, yet nothing &s;o well atte&s;ted, as what relates to the laws and government of Lycurgus. What indeed can be more amazing, than to behold a mutinous and &s;avage race of mankind yielding &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to laws, that controuled every &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure, and every private affection! To behold them give up for the good of the &s;tate, all the com|forts and conveniences of private life, and making a &s;tate of dome&s;tic privacy more &s;evere and terrible, than the mo&s;t painful campaigns and the mo&s;t warlike duties! Yet all this was effected by the per&s;everance and autho|rity of a &s;ingle legi&s;lator, who gave the fir&s;t le&s;&s;ons of hard re&s;ignation in his own generous examples.</P>
<P>Lycurgus was the &s;on of Eunomus, one of the two kings who reign e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> together in Sparta: During the minority of Charilaus, Licurgus act|ed as regent: but re&s;olving to make him&s;elf acquainted with all the improvements of other nations, he travelled into Crete, pa&s;&s;ed over into A&s;ia, and from thence went into Egypt. But while he was thus employed abroad, his pre&s;ence was greatly wanted at home, where every thing was ha&s;tening to anarchy and ruin. On his return, he found the people wearied out with their own importunities, and ready to receive any new impre&s;lious he might attempt. He fir&s;t communicated his de&s;ign of
<PB N="13" REF="026819_0013_101371A867E5A368">altering the whole code of laws to his particu|lar friends, and then by degrees gained over the leading men to his party, until things be|ing ripe for a change, he ordered thirty of the principal men to appear armed in the market|place. Charilus, who was at this time king, at fir&s;t oppo&s;ed the revolution, but was &s;oon per&s;uaded to join in the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>To continue the kings &s;till with a &s;hadow of power, he confirmed them in their rights of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as before; but dimini&s;hed their au|thority by in&s;tituting a &s;enate, which was to &s;erve as a counterpoi&s;e between the preroga|tive and the people. The kings however, had &s;till all their former marks of outward dignity and re&s;pect. The government hitherto had been un&s;teady, tending at one time towards de&s;poti&s;m, at another to democracy; but the &s;enate in&s;tituted by Lycurgus &s;erved as a check upon both, and kept the &s;tate balanced in tran|quility.</P>
<P>To keep the people in plenty and depen|dence, &s;eems to have been one of the mo&s;t re fined &s;trokes in this philo&s;opher's legi&s;lation. The generality of people were at that time &s;o poor, that they were de&s;titute of every kind of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, while a &s;mall member of individuals were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the lands and the wealth of the country. In order, therefore, to ban|i&s;h the in&s;olence, the fraud. and the luxury of the one, as well as the mi&s;ery, the repining, and the factious de&s;pair of the other, he per|&s;uaded them majority, and forced the re&s;t, to give up all their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and to the commonwealth, and
<PB N="14" REF="026819_0014_101371AA5C2ED418">to make a new divi&s;ion of them, that they might all live together in perfect equality. Thus all the &s;en&s;ual goods of life were di&s;tributed among the governors and the governed, and &s;uperior merit alone conferred &s;uperior di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>It would, however, have an&s;wered no per|manent purpo&s;e to divide the lands, if the money had been &s;till &s;uffered to accumulate. To prevent, therefore, all other di&s;tinctions but that of merit, he re&s;olved to level down all fortune to one &s;tandard. He did not, indeed, &s;trip tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of gold or &s;ilver of their property; but, what was equivalent, he cried down its value, and &s;uffered nothing but iron money to pa&s;s in exchange for every commo|dity. This coin al&s;o he made &s;o heavy, and fixed at &s;o low a rate, that a cart and two even were required to carry home a &s;um equi|valent to twenty pounds Engli&s;h, and a whole hou&s;e was nece&s;&s;ary to keep it in. By the&s;e means, money was &s;oon brought into di&s;u&s;e, and few troubled them&s;elves with more than was &s;ufficient to &s;upply their nece&s;&s;aries. Thus not only riches, but their attendant train of avarice, fraud, rapine, and luxury, were ba|ni&s;hed from this &s;imple fiare.</P>
<P>Even the&s;e in&s;titutions were not thought &s;uf|ficient to prevent that tendency, which man|kind have to private exce&s;s. A third regula|tion was therefore made, commanding that all meals &s;hould be in public. He ordained, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the men &s;hould eat in one common hall without di&s;tinction; and, le&s;t &s;trangers &s;hould attempt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o corrupt his ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by their exam|ples,
<PB N="15" REF="026819_0015_101371AE228E7368">a law was expre&s;sly made again&s;t their entrance into the city. By the&s;e means, fru|gality was not only made nece&s;&s;ary, but the u&s;e of riches was at once aboli&s;hed. Every man &s;ent monthly his provi&s;ions to the com|mon &s;tock, with a little money for other con|tingent expences.</P>
<P>So rigorous an injunction, which thus out off all the delicaries and refinements of lux|ury, was by no means plea&s;ing to the rich, who took every occa&s;ion to in&s;ult the law|giver on his new regulations. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|mults it excited were frequent; and in one of the&s;e, a young fellow, who&s;e name was Alexander, &s;truck out one of Lycurgus's eyes; but he had the majority of the people on his &s;ide, who, provoked at the outrage, delivered the young man into his hands, to treat him with all proper &s;everity. Lycurgus, in&s;tead of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tifying any brutal re&s;entment, won over his aggre&s;&s;or by all the arts of ability and ten|derne&s;s, till at la&s;t, from being one of the proude&s;t and mo&s;t turbulent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">en of Sparta, he became an example of wi&s;dom and moderation, and an u&s;eful a&s;&s;i&s;tant to Lycurgus in promo|ting his new in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>Thus undaunted by oppo&s;ition, and &s;teady in his de&s;igns, he went on to make reforma|tion in the manners of his country <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">en. As the education of youth was one of the mo&s;t important objects of a legi&s;lator's care, he fir&s;t in&s;tituted, that &s;uch children as, upon a pub|lic view were deemed deformed or weekly, and unfitted for a future li&s;t of vigout and &s;a|tigue,
<PB N="16" REF="026819_0016_101371B5559596C8">&s;hould be expo&s;ed to peri&s;h in a cavern near mount Taygetus. Tho&s;e infants that were born without any capital defects, were adopted as children of the &s;tate, and delivered to their parents to be nur&s;ed with &s;everity and hard&s;hip. From their tendere&s;t age, they were accu&s;tomed to make no choice in their eating, nor to be afraid in the dark, or when left alone; not to be peevi&s;h or fretful, to walk barefoot, to lie hard at nights, to wear the &s;ame cloathes winter and &s;ummer, and to fear nothing from their equals. At the age of &s;e|ven they were taken from their parents, and delivered over to the cla&s;&s;es for their educa|tion. Their di&s;cipline there was little el&s;e than an apprentice&s;hip to hard&s;hip, &s;elf-denial, and obedience.</P>
<P>All o&s;tentatious learning was bani&s;hed from this &s;imple common wealth: their only &s;tudy was to obey, their only pride was to &s;uffer hard&s;hips. There was yearly a cu&s;tom of whipping them at the altar of Diana, and the boy that bore this puni&s;hment with the greate&s;t fortitude came off victorious. Every in&s;titu|tion &s;eemed calculated to harden the body, and &s;harpen the mind for war. In order to pre|pare them for &s;tratagems and &s;udden incur|&s;ions, the boys were permitted to &s;teal from each other; but, if they were caught in the fact, they were puni&s;hed for their want of dexterity.</P>
<P>At twelve years old, the boys were removed into another cla&s;s of a more advanced kind. There, in order to cru&s;h the &s;eeds of vice
<PB N="17" REF="026819_0017_101371B730088240">which at that time began to appear, their la|bour and di&s;cipline were encrea&s;ed with their age. They had now their &s;kirmi&s;hes between parties, and their mock fights between larger bodies. In the&s;e they often fought with hands, feet, teeth, and nails with &s;uch ob&s;tinacy, that it was common to &s;ee them lo&s;e their eyes, and often their lives, before the fray was de|termined. Such was the con&s;tant di&s;cipline of their minority, which la&s;ted till the age of thirty, before which they were not permitted to marry, to go into the troops, or to bear any office in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>With regard to the virgins, their di&s;cipline was equally &s;trict with the former. They were inured to a con&s;tant cour&s;e of labour and in|du&s;try, until they were twenty years old, before which time they were not allowed to be mar|riageable.</P>
<P>Valour and genero&s;ity &s;eemed the ruling mo|tives of this new in&s;titution; arms were their only exerci&s;e and employment, and their life was much le&s;s au&s;tere in the camp than in the city. The Spartans were the only people in the world, to whom the time of war was a time of ea&s;e and refre&s;hment; becau&s;e then the &s;everity of their manners was relaxed, and the men were indulged in greater liberties. With them the fir&s;t principles of war was never to turn their backs on their enemies, however di&s;proportioned in forces, not to deliver up their arms until they re&s;igned them with life.</P>
<P>Such was the general purport of the in&s;titu|tions of Ly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rgus, which from their tendency
<PB N="18" REF="026819_0018_101371BB63DB2B30">gained the e&s;teem and admiration of all the &s;urrounding nations. The Greeks were ever apt to be dazzled rather with &s;plendid than u&s;eful virtues, and prai&s;ed the laws of Lycur|gus, which at be&s;t were calculated rather to make men warlike than happy, and to &s;ub|&s;titute in&s;en&s;ibility in&s;tead of enjoyment.</P>
<P>When Lycurgus had thus compleated his military in&s;titution, and when the form of go|vernment he had e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;eemed &s;trong and vigorous enough to &s;upport it&s;elf, his next care was to give it all the permanence in his power. He therefore &s;ignified to the people, that &s;omething &s;till remained for the completion of his plan, and that he was under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of going to con&s;ult the oracle of Delphos for its advice. In the mean time, he per&s;ua|ded them to take an oath, for the &s;trict ob&s;er|vance of all his laws until his return, and then departed with a full re&s;olution of never &s;eeing Sparta more. When he was arrived at Delphos, he con&s;ulted the oracle, to know whether the laws he had made were &s;ufficient to render the Lacedaemonians happy; and be|ing an&s;wered, that nothing was wanting to their perfection, he &s;ent this an&s;wer to Sparta, and then voluntarily &s;tarved him&s;elf to death-Others &s;ay he died in Crete, ordering his body to be burnt, and his a&s;hes to be thrown into the &s;ea. The death of this great lawgiver gave a &s;anction and authority to his laws, which his life was m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ble to confer. The Spartans regarded his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d as the mo&s;t glorious of all his actions, and a nob fini&s;hing of all
<PB N="19" REF="026819_0019_101371BCF3A96720">his former &s;ervices. They built a temple, and paid divine honours to him after his death; they con&s;idered them&s;elves as bound by every tie of gratitude and religion to a &s;trict ob&s;er|vance of all his in&s;titutions; and the long con|tinuance of the Spartan government is a proof of their per&s;evering re&s;olution.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>THE Athenians having, for more than a century, &s;een the good effects of laws in the regulation of the Spartan commonwealth, about the year 3380, became de&s;irous of being governed by written laws. They pitched up|on Draco, a man of acknowledged wi&s;dom and un&s;haken integrity, but rigid even beyond human &s;ufferance. Draco not &s;ucceeding in this bu&s;ine&s;s, Solon was applied to for his ad|vice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as he was the wi&s;e&s;t and ju&s;te&s;t man in all Athens. His great learning had acquired him the reputation of being the fir&s;t of the &s;even wi&s;e men of Greece, and his known humanity procured him the love and veneration of every rank among his fellow ci|tizens. Solon was a native of Salamis, an i&s;land dependent on Athens, but which had revolted to put it&s;elf under the power of the Megareans. In attempting to recover this i&s;land, the Athenians had &s;pent much blood and trea&s;ure, until at la&s;t v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ed out with &s;uch ill-&s;ucce&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, a law was made, rendering it
<PB N="20" REF="026819_0020_101371BEA56D4898">capital ever to advi&s;e the recovery of their lo&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Solon, however, undertook to pu|&s;uade them to another trial; and, feigning him&s;elf mad, he ran about the &s;treets, u&s;ing the mo&s;t violent ge&s;tures and language; but the purport of all was, to upbraid the Athenians for their remi&s;&s;ne&s;s and effeminacy, in giving up their conque&s;ts in de&s;pair. In &s;hort, he acted his part &s;o well, by the oddity of his manners, and the &s;trength of his rea&s;oning, that the people ro&s;olved on another expedition again&s;t Salamais; and, by a &s;tratagem of his contrivance, in which he introduced &s;everal young men upon the i&s;land in women's cloaths, the place was &s;urpri&s;ed, and added to the dominion of Athens.</P>
<P>But this was not the only occa&s;ion, on which he exhibited &s;uperior addre&s;s and wi&s;dom. At a time when Greece had carried the arts of eloquence, poetry, and government, higher than they had yet been &s;een among mankind, Solon was con&s;idered as one of the foremo&s;t in each perfection. The &s;ages of Greece, who&s;e &s;ame is &s;till undimini&s;hed, acknowledged his merit, and adopted him as their a&s;&s;ociate. The cor|re&s;pondence between the&s;e wi&s;e men was at once in&s;tructive, friendly, and &s;incere. They were &s;even in number, namely, Thales the Mile&s;ian, Solon of Athens, Chilo of Lacedae|mon, Pittacus of Mitylene, Periander of Co|rinth, Bias and Cleobulus, who&s;e birth-places are not a&s;certained.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ages often vi&s;ited each other, and their conver&s;ations generally turned upon the
<PB REF="026819_0021_101371C1A87CFD80">methods of in&s;tituting the be&s;t form of govern|ment, or the arts of private happine&s;s. One day, when Solon went to Miletus to &s;ee Thales, the fir&s;t thing he &s;aid, was to expre&s;s his &s;urpri&s;e that Thales had never de&s;ired to marry, or have children. Thales made no an|&s;wer then, but a few days after contrived that a &s;tranger, &s;uppo&s;ed to arrive from Athens, &s;hould join their company. Solon, hearing from whence the &s;tranger came, was inqui&s;itive after the news of his own city, but was only informed, that a young man died there, for whom the whole place was in the greate&s;t af|fliction, as he was reputed the mo&s;t promi&s;ing y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> in all Athens. "Alas! (cried Solon) how much is the poor father of the youth to be pitied! Pray, what was his name?" "I heard the name, (replied the &s;tranger, who was in|&s;tructed for the occa&s;ion) but I have forgotten it: I only remember, that all people talked much of his wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice." Every an|&s;wer afforded new matter of trouble and terror to the inqui&s;itive father, and he had ju&s;t &s;trength enough to a&s;k, if the youth was the &s;on of Solon. "The very &s;ame," replied the &s;tranger; at which words Solon &s;he wed all the marks of the mo&s;t incon&s;olable di&s;tre&s;s. This was the opportunity which Thales wanted, who took him by the hand, and &s;aid to him with a &s;mile, "Comfort your&s;elf, my friend, all that has been told you is a mere fiction, but may &s;erve as a very proper an&s;wer to your que&s;tion, why I never thought proper to marr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">"</P>
<P>One day, at the court of Periander of Co|rinth,
<PB N="22" REF="026819_0022_101371C8692A8B30">a que&s;tion was propo&s;ed, "Which was the mo&s;t perfect popular government?" "That (&s;aid Bias) where the laws have no &s;uperior." "That (&s;aid Thales) where the inhabitants are neither too rich nor too poor." "That (&s;aid Anachar&s;is the Scythian) where virtue is honoured and vice dete&s;ted." "That (&s;aid Pittacus) where dignities are al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ys conferred upon the virtuous, and never upon the ba&s;e." "That (&s;aid Cleobulus) where the citizens fear blame more than puni&s;hment." "That (&s;aid Chilo) where the laws are more regarded than the orators." But Solon's opinion &s;eems to have the greate&s;t weight, who &s;aid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> "Where an injury done to the meane&s;t &s;ubject is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|&s;ult upon the whole con&s;titution."</P>
<P>Upon a certain occa&s;ion, when Solon was conver&s;ing with Anachar&s;ia, the Scythian phi|&s;olopher, about his intended reformation in the &s;tate, "Alas (cried the Scythian) all your laws will be found to re&s;emble &s;piders webs: the weak and &s;mall flies will be caught and entangled, but the great and powerful will always have &s;trength enough to break through."</P>
<P>A matter &s;till more celebrated is Solon's in|terview with Croe&s;us, king of Lydia. This monarch, who was reputed the riche&s;t of all A&s;ia Minor, was willing to make an o&s;tenta|tious di&s;play of his wealth before the Greek philo&s;opher, and after &s;hewing him immen&s;e heaps of trea&s;ures, and the greate&s;t variety of other ornaments, he demanded, whether he did not think the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of them the mo&s;t happy
<PB N="23" REF="026819_0023_101371CA00D48258">of all mankind. "No, (replied Solon) I know one more happy, a poor pea&s;ant of Greece, who, neither in affluence nor in po|verty, has but few wants, and has learned to &s;upply them by his labour." This an&s;wer was by no means agreeable to the vain monarch, who by this que&s;tion hoped only for a reply that would tend to flatter his pride. Willing, there|fore, to extort one &s;till more favourable, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e a&s;ked, whether, at lea&s;t, he did not think him happy. "Alas! (cried Solon) what man can be pronounced happy before he dies!" The integrity and the wi&s;dom of Solon's replies ap|pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d in the event. The kingdom of Lydia w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">invaded by Cyrus, the empire de&s;troyed, and Croe&s;us him&s;elf was taken pri&s;oner. When he was led out to execution, according to the barbarous manner of the times, he then too late recollected the maxims of Solon, and could not help crying out when on the &s;caffold upon Solon's name. Cyrus, hearing him repeat the name with great earne&s;tne&s;s, was de&s;irous of knowing the rea&s;on: and being informed by Croe&s;us of that philo&s;opher's remarkable ob|&s;ervation, he began to fear for him&s;elf, par|doned Croe&s;us, and took him for the future in|to confidence and friend&s;hip. Thus Solon had the merit of &s;aving one king's life, and of re|forming another.</P>
<P>Such was the man, to whom Athens ap|plied for a&s;&s;i&s;tance in reforming the &s;everity of their government, and in&s;tituting a ju&s;t body of law. His fir&s;t attempt was, therefore, in &s;avour of the poor, who&s;e deb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">aboh&s;hed
<PB N="24" REF="026819_0024_101371CDF704AFB0">at once, by an expre&s;s law of in&s;olvency. His next &s;tep was to repeal all the laws enacted by Draco, except tho&s;e again&s;t murder. He then proceeded to the regulation of offices, employ|ments, and magi&s;trates, all which he left in the hands of the rich; and he di&s;tributed the rich into three cla&s;&s;es, ranging them according to their incomes. The Areopagus, &s;o called from the place where the court was held, had been e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ome centuries before, but So|lon re&s;tored and augmented its authority. No|thing was &s;o augu&s;t as this court, and its repu|tation for judgment and integrity became &s;o very great, that the Romans &s;ometimes referr|ed cau&s;es, which were too intricate for their own deci&s;ion, to the determination of this tri|bunal. Nothing was regarded here but truth: that no external objects might pervert ju&s;tice, the tribunal was held in darkne&s;s, and the ad|vocates were denied all attempts to work upon the pa&s;&s;ions of the judges. Superior to this, Solon in&s;tituted the great council of four hun|dred, who were to judge upon appeals from the Areopagus, and maturely to examine every que&s;tion before it came to be debated in a ge|neral a&s;&s;embly of the people.</P>
<P>He aboli&s;hed the cu&s;tom of giving portions in marriage with young women, unle&s;s they were only daughters. The bride was to carry no other fortune to her hu&s;band than three &s;uits of clothes, and &s;ome hou&s;ehold goods of little value. It was his aim to prevent making matrimony a traffic: he con&s;idered it as an ho|nourable connection, calculated for the mutual
<PB N="25" REF="026819_0025_101371CF8A78A230">hapine&s;s of both parties, and the general ad|vantage of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the principal in&s;titutions of this celebrated lawgiver, and though neither &s;o &s;triking, nor yet &s;o well authori&s;ed as tho&s;e of Lycurgus, they did not fail to operate for &s;eve|ral &s;ucceeding ages, and &s;eemed to gather &s;trength by ob&s;ervance. In order to perpetu|ate his &s;tatutes, he engaged the people by a public oath to ob&s;erve them religiou&s;ly, at lea&s;t for the term of an hundred years: and thus, having completed the ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned him, he withdrew from the city, to avoid the importu|nity of &s;ome, and the captious petulence of o|thers; for, as he well knew, it was hard, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to plea&s;e every individual. Solon being now employed on his travels in vi&s;iting Egypt. Lydia, and &s;everal other countries, left Athens to become habituated to his new in&s;titutions, and to try by experience the wi&s;|dom of their formation.</P>
<P>While Solon was thus on his travels, civil conten&s;ions di&s;turbed Athens, and the &s;pirit of party was ha&s;tening every thing to ruin. Af|ter ten years ab&s;ence, Solon returned to Athens, and found the city involved in &s;lavery. Pi&s;i&s;|tratus had procured him&s;elf a guard formed of his own creatures, who at length &s;eized on the citidel, while none were left, who had &s;ufficient courage or conduct to oppo&s;e him.</P>
<P>In this general con&s;ternation, which was the re&s;ult of folly on the one hand, and treachery on the other, the whole city was one &s;cene of tu|mal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and di&s;order, &s;ome flying, others inwardly
<PB N="26" REF="026819_0026_101371D42EE470B8">complaining, others preparing for &s;lavery with patient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Solon was the only man, who, without fear or &s;hrinking, deplored the folly of the times, and reproached the Athe|nians with their cowardice and treachery. "You might with ea&s;e (&s;aid he) have cru&s;hed the tyrant in his bud; but nothing now re|mains but to pluck him up by the roots. As for my&s;elf, I have at lea&s;t the &s;atisfaction of hav|ing di&s;charged my duty to my country and the laws: as for the re&s;t, I have nothing to fear; and now, upon the de&s;truction of my country, my only confidence is in my great age, which gives me the hopes of not being a long &s;urvi|vor." In fact, he did not &s;urvive the liberty of his country above two years; he died at Cyprus, in the eightieth year of his age, la|mented and admired by every &s;tate of Greece. Be&s;ides his &s;kill in legi&s;lation, Solon was re|marakble for &s;everal other &s;hining qualities: he was ma&s;ter of eloquence in &s;o high a de|gree, that from him Cicero dates the origin of oratory in Athens. He was al&s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in poetry; and Plato a&s;&s;erts, that it was only for want of due application, that he did not come to di&s;pute the prize with Homer him&s;elf.</P>

<P>FROM the death of Solon, to about the year of the world 3500, Athens continued to be the &s;cene of party cabals, and u&s;urped
<PB N="27" REF="026819_0027_101371D5DBF7A718">tyranny; but, about this period, two young citizens began to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves at Athens, namely Ari&s;tides and Themi&s;tocles. The&s;e youths were of very different di&s;po&s;i|tions; but from this difference re&s;ulted the greate&s;t advantages to their country. The|mi&s;tocles was naturally inclined to a popular government, and omitted nothing that could render him agreeable to the public, or gain him friends. His complai&s;ance was boundle&s;s, and his de&s;ire to oblige &s;ometimes out&s;tepped the bounds of duty. His partiality was often con&s;picuous. Ari&s;tides was remarkable for his ju&s;tice and integrity. Being a favourer of ari&s;tocracy, in imitation of Lycurgus, he was friendly, but never at the expence of ju&s;tice-In &s;eeking honours, he ever declined the in|tere&s;ts of his friends, le&s;t they &s;hould, in turn, demand his intere&s;t when his duty was to be impartial. The love of the public good was the great &s;pring of all his actions, and with that in view no difficulties could daunt, no &s;uc|ce&s;s or elevation exalt him. On all occa&s;ions he pre&s;erved his u&s;ual calmne&s;s of temper, be|ing per&s;uaded, that he was entirely his coun|try's, and very little his own.</P>
<P>At this time, Darius, king of Per&s;ia, was turning his arms again&s;t Greece, while the&s;e illu&s;trious Athenians were in&s;piring their fel|low citizens with a noble confidence in their bravery, and made every preparation for the expected inva&s;ion, which prudence and delibe|rate valour could &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="026819_0028_101371D8A37D4808">
In the mean time, Darius' generals made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the i&s;lands in the Aegean &s;ea, and laid &s;iege to Eretria, which they at la&s;t took by &s;torm, owing to the treachery of &s;ome of the principal inhabitants. The town was plundered and burnt, and the inhabitants put in chains, and &s;ent as the fir&s;t fruits of war to the Per&s;ian monarch; but he, contrary to their expectations, treated them with great jenity, and gave them a village in the country of Ci&s;&s;a to live in.</P>
<P>This was &s;oon followed by the battle of Ma|rathon, the fir&s;t great battle the Greeks had ever engaged in. It was not like any of their former conte&s;ts ari&s;ing from jealou&s;y, and ter|minating in an ea&s;y accommodation: it was a battle that was to be decided with the greate&s;t monarch of the earth. This was an engage|ment that was to decide the liberty of Greece, and, what was of infinitely greater moment, the future progre&s;s of refinement among man|kind. Upon the event of this battle depended the complexion, which the manners of the We&s;t were hereafter to a&s;&s;ume, whether they were to adopt A&s;iatic cu&s;toms with their con|querors, or to go on in modelling them&s;elves upon Grecian refinements. This therefore may be con&s;idered as one of the mo&s;t important bat|tles that ever was fought, and the event was as little to be expected as the &s;ucce&s;s was glo|rious.</P>
<P>Miltiodes, who was now inve&s;ted with the &s;upreme command of the Greek army, like au experienced general, endeavoured, by the ad|vantage
<PB N="29" REF="026819_0029_101371DE14750B98">of his ground, to make up for his de|ficiency in &s;trength and number, his whole army con&s;i&s;ting but of ten thou&s;and. He was &s;en&s;ible, that by extending his front to oppo&s;e the enemy, he mu&s;t weaken it too much, and give their den&s;e body the advantage. He therefore drew up his army at the foot of a mountain, &s;o that the enemy &s;hould not &s;urround him, or charge him in the rear. On the flanks, on either &s;ide, becau&s;ed large trees to be thrown, which were cut down for that purpo&s;e, and the&s;e &s;erved to guard him from the Per&s;ian ca|valry, that generally wheeled on the flank in the heat of an engagement. Datis, the Per&s;ian general, was &s;en&s;ible of this advantageous di&s;|po&s;ition; but relying on his &s;uperiority of num|bers, and unwilling to wait till Miltiades &s;hould receive reinforcements, he determined to en|gage.</P>
<P>The &s;ignal was no &s;ooner given than the Athenians, without waiting the Per&s;ian on&s;et, ru&s;hed in upon their ranks with de&s;perate ra|pidity, as if wholly regardle&s;s of &s;afety. The Per&s;ians con&s;idered this fir&s;t &s;tep of the Athen: ans as the re&s;ult of madne&s;s, and were more inclined to de&s;pi&s;e them as maniacs. than op|po&s;e them as &s;oldiers. However, they were quickly undeceived. It had never been the cu&s;tom of the Grecks to run on with this head|long valour; but comparing the number of their own forces with that of the enemy and expecting &s;afety only from ra&s;hne&s;s, they deter|mined to break through the enemy's ranks, or fall in the attempt. The greatne&s;s of their
<PB N="30" REF="026819_0030_10137220CF70BE58">danger added to their courage, and de&s;pair did the re&s;t. The Per&s;ians, however, &s;tood their ground with great intrepidity, and the battle was long, fierce, and ob&s;tinate. Miltiades had made the wings of his army exceedingly &s;trong, but had left the main body weaker, and not &s;o deep; for having but ten thou&s;and men to op|po&s;e &s;uch a numerous army, be &s;uppo&s;ed the victory could be obtained by no other means than by &s;trengthening his flanks. He doubted not but that, when his wings were once victo|rious, they would be able to wheel upon the enemy's main body on either &s;ide, and then ea&s;ily rout them. The Per&s;ians, therefore, finding the main body weake&s;t, attacked it with their utmo&s;t vigour. It was in vain that Ari&s;|tides and Themi&s;tocles, who were &s;tationed in this po&s;t of danger, endeavoured to keep their troops to the charge: courage and intrepidity were unable to re&s;i&s;t the torrent of encrea&s;ing numbers, &s;o that they were at la&s;t obliged to give ground. In the mean time the wings were victorious; and now, ju&s;t as the main bo|dy was fainting under the unequal encounter, the&s;e ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e up, and gave them time to recover their &s;trength and order. Thus the &s;cale of victory quickly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urned in their favour, the Per|&s;ians began to give ground in turn, and, being un&s;upported by fre&s;h forces, they fled to their &s;hips with the utmo&s;t precipitation. The con|fu&s;ion and di&s;order was now univer&s;al, the A|thenians followed them to the beach, and &s;et many of their &s;hips on fire.</P>

Of the Greeks, not above two hundred men were killed, among whom was Callimachus, who gave his vote for bringing on the engagement. The Per&s;ian forces, before the battle, cou&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix hundred &s;hips, and an army of an hundred and twenty thou&s;and men. Their in&s;tructions were, to give up Athens to be plundered, to burn all the hou&s;es and temples and to lead away all the inhabitants into &s;lavery. The country was to be laid de&s;olate, and the army was provided with chains and fetters for bind|ing the conquered nations.</P>
<P>Thus ended the famous battle of Marathon, which the Per&s;ians were &s;o &s;ure of gaining, that they had brought marble into the field, in or|der to erect a trophy there. This battle was fought in the year of the world 3514.</P>
<P>A part of the army, immediately after the battle, marched forward to Athens, to protect it from any attemps the enemy might make,
<PB N="32" REF="026819_0033_101371EA908BEE70">which proved a very prudent mea&s;ure; for the Per&s;ian fleet, in&s;tead of &s;ailing directly back to A&s;ia, made an attempt to &s;urpri&s;e Athens, be|fore they &s;uppo&s;ed the Greek troops could ar|rive from Marathon. The Athenian troops, however, took the precaution to move directly thither, and performed their march with &s;o much expedition, that, though it was forty miles from Marathon, they arrived there in one day. In this manner the Greeks not only expelled their enemies, but confirmed their &s;ecurity. By this victory, the Grecians were taught to know their own &s;trength, and not to tremble before an enemy only terrible in name.</P>
<P>The gratitude of the Athenians to Miltiades &s;poke a noblene&s;s of mind, that far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed expen&s;ive triumphs, or ba&s;e adulation. Sen&s;i|ble that his merits were too great for money to repay, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">u&s;ed a picture to be painted by Polygnotus, one of their mo&s;t celebrated arti&s;ts, in which Miltiades was repre&s;ented, at the head of the ten commanders, exhorting the &s;oldiers, and &s;etting them an example of their duty. This picture was pre&s;erved for many ages, with other paintings of the be&s;t ma&s;ters, in the por|tico where Zeno afterwards in&s;tituted his &s;chool of philo&s;ophy. Every officer, as well as private &s;oldier, who fell in this battle, had a monument erected to his memory on the plains of Mara|thon.</P>
<P>Though the gratitude of the Athenians to Miltiades was very &s;incere, yet it was of no long continuance. This fickle and jealous peo|ple, naturally capricious and now more than
<PB N="33" REF="026819_0034_101371EE94BB6F20">ever careful of pre&s;erving their freedom, were willing to take every opportunity of mortifying a general, from who&s;e merit they had much to fear. Being appointed, with &s;eventy &s;hips, to puni&s;h tho&s;e i&s;lands that had favoured the Per&s;ian inva&s;ion, he &s;ailed to Paros, and inve&s;ted that place. Here, having broken his thigh by an accident, he was obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege, and return home. On his arrival at Athens, the whole city began to murmur, and he was accu&s;ed of having taken a bribe from Per&s;ia. As he was not in a condition to an&s;wer this charge, being confined to his bed by the wound he re|ceived at Paros, the accu&s;ation took place again&s;t him, and he was condemned to lo&s;e his life. However, in con&s;ideration of his former &s;ervices, his &s;entence was commuted into a penalty of fifty talents, the &s;um which it had co&s;t the &s;tate in fitting out the late un&s;ucce&s;sful expedition. Not being rich enough to pay this &s;um, he was thrown into pri&s;on, where his wound growing wor&s;e, from bad air and con|finement, it turned at la&s;t to a gangrene, and put an end to his life and misfortunes. Thus peri&s;hed a man, who has been very ju&s;tly prai&s;|ed for his conde&s;cen&s;ion, moderation, and ju&s;tice. To him Athens was indebted for all its glory, he being the man who fir&s;t taught her to de&s;pi&s;e the empty menaces of the boa&s;tful Per&s;ians. Cimon, his &s;on, who was at this time very young, &s;ignalized his piety on this occa|&s;ion. As this ungrateful city would not permit the body of Milt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ades to be buried until all his debts were paid, this young man employed all
<PB N="34" REF="026819_0035_101371F169559E88">his intere&s;t among his friends, &s;trained his ut|mo&s;t credit to pay the fine, and procured his father an honourable interment.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>DARIUS, king of per&s;ia, died amid&s;t the preparations he was making for a &s;econd expedition into Greece; but he was &s;ucceeded by a &s;on, who inherited all his ambition, with|out any &s;hare of his abilities. He was a young man, &s;urrounded by flatterers, and naturally vain and &s;uperficial. Having drained all the Ea&s;t to compo&s;e his own army, and the We&s;t to &s;upply tho&s;e of the Carthagenians, who were come to his aid, he &s;et out from Suca, in order to enter on this war, ten years after the battle of Marathon, and in the year of the world 3523.</P>
<P>Sardis was the place, where the various na|tions that were compelled to his banner were to a&s;&s;emble. His fleet was to advance along the coa&s;t of A&s;ia Minor towards the Helle&s;pont; but as, in doubling the cape of Mount Athos, many &s;hips were detained, he was re&s;olved to cut a pa&s;&s;age through that neck of land, which joined the mount to the continent, and thus gave his &s;hipping a &s;horter and &s;afer pa&s;&s;age. This canal was a mile and a half long, and hol|lowed out from a high mountain. It required immen&s;e labour to perform &s;o great a work: but his numbers and his ambition were &s;ufficient to &s;urmount all difficulties. To urge on
<PB N="35" REF="026819_0036_101371F392F23C28">the undertaking the fa&s;ter, he treated his labor|ers with the greate&s;t &s;everity; while, with all the o&s;tentation of an ea&s;tern prince, he gave his commands to the mountains to &s;ink before him: "Athos, (&s;aid he) thou proud a&s;piring moun|tain, that lifte&s;t up thy head unto the heavens, be not &s;o audacious as to put ob&s;tacles in my way. If thou give&s;t them that oppo&s;ition, I will cut thee level to the plain, and throw thee headlong into the &s;ea!"</P>
<P>Early in the &s;pring, he directed his march down towards the Helle&s;pont, where his fleet lay in all their pomp, expecting his arrival. Here he was de&s;irous of taking a &s;urvey of all his forces, which compo&s;ed an army that was never equalled either before or &s;ince. It was compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t powerful nations of the Ea&s;t, and of people &s;carce known to po&s;terity, except by name. The remote&s;t India contri|buted its &s;upplies, while the colde&s;t tracts of Scythia &s;ent their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Medes, Per&s;ians, Bactirans, Lydians, A&s;&s;yrians, Hyrcanians, and an hundred other countries of various com|plexions, languages, dre&s;&s;es, and arms. The land army, which he brought out of A&s;ia, con|&s;i&s;ted of &s;eventeen hundred thou&s;and foot, and four&s;core thou&s;and hor&s;e. Three hundred thou&s;and more that were added upon cro&s;&s;ing the Helle&s;pont, made all his land forces toge|ther amount to above two millions of men. His fleet, when it &s;et out from A&s;ia, con&s;i&s;ted of twelve hundred and &s;even ve&s;&s;els, each car|rying two hundred men. The Europeans augmented his fleet with an hundred and twenty
<PB N="36" REF="026819_0037_101371F69C50BFB0">ve&s;&s;els, each of which carried two hundred men. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there were a thou&s;and &s;maller ve&s;&s;els, fitted for carrying provi&s;ions and &s;tores. The men contained in the&s;e, with the former, amounded to &s;ix hundred thou&s;and: &s;o that the whole army might be &s;aid to amount to two millions and a half, which, with the women, &s;laves, and &s;ettlers, always accompanying a Per&s;ian army, might make the whole above five millions of &s;ouls. Such was the &s;tate of this proud monarch's forces.</P>
<P>Lord of &s;o many and &s;uch various &s;ubjects, Xerxes found aplea&s;ure in reviewing his forces: beholding all the earth covered with his troops, and all the &s;ea crouded with his ve&s;&s;els, he felt a &s;ecret joy diffu&s;e it&s;elf through his frame, from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own &s;uperior power. But all the workings of this monarch's mind were in extreme: a &s;udden &s;adne&s;s &s;oon took place of his plea&s;ure, and di&s;&s;olving into a &s;nower of tears, he give him&s;elf up to the reflection, that not one of &s;o many thou&s;ands would be alive an hundred years after.</P>
<P>In the mean time Xerxes had given orders for building a bridge of boats acro&s;s the Helle|&s;pont, for the tran&s;porting of his army into Europe. This narrow &s;trait, which now goes by the name of the Dardanelles, is near an Engli&s;h mile over. However, &s;oon after the completion of this work, a violent &s;torm ari&s;ing, the whole was broken and de&s;troyed, and the labour was to be undertaken anew. The fury of Xerxes, upon this di&s;appointment, was at|tended with equal extravagance and cruelty.
<PB N="37" REF="026819_0038_101371F85410E6E0">His vengeance knew no bounds, the workmen who had undertaken the ta&s;k, had their heads &s;truck off by his order; and that the &s;ea al&s;o might know its duty, he ordered it to be la&s;hed as a delinquent, and a pair of fetters to be thrown into it, to curb its future irregularities. Hav|ing thus given vent to his ab&s;urd re&s;entment, two bridges were ordered to be built in the place of the former, one for the army to pa&s;s over, and the other for the baggage and bea&s;ts of burden. The workment, now warned by the fate of their predece&s;&s;ors, undertook to give their labours greater &s;tability <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t they placed three hundred and &s;ixty ve&s;&s;els acro&s;s the &s;trait, &s;ome of them having three banks of oars, and others fifty oars a-piece. They then ca&s;t large anchors on both &s;ides into the water, in order to fix tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els again&s;t the violence of the winds and current. They then drove large piles into the earth, with huge rings fa&s;tened to them, to which were tied &s;ix va&s;t cables, which went over each of the two bridges.&mdash; Over all the&s;e they laid trunks of trees, cut purpo&s;ely for that u&s;e, and flat boats over them, fa&s;tened and joined together, &s;o as to &s;erve for a floor, or &s;olid bottom. When the whole work was thus completed, a day was appointed for their pa&s;&s;ing over; and as &s;oon as the fir&s;t rays of the &s;un began to ap|pear, &s;weet odours of all kinds were abundantly &s;cattered over the new work, and the way was &s;tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed with myrtle. At the &s;ame time, Xerxes, turning bis face tow-res the ea&s;t, wor|&s;hipped the &s;un, which is the god of the Per|&s;ians.
<PB N="38" REF="026819_0039_101371FCD2BCFF40">Then, throwing his libations into the &s;ea, together with a golden cup and Per&s;ian &s;cyn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tar, he went forwards, and gave orders for the army to follow. This immen&s;e train were no le&s;s than &s;even days and &s;even nights pa&s;&s;ing over, while tho&s;e who were appointed to conduct the march, quickened the troops by la&s;hing them along; for the &s;oldiers of the Ea&s;t, at that time, and to this day, are treated like &s;laves. Thus this immen&s;e army having landed in Europe, and being joined by the &s;everal Eu|ropean nations that acknowledged the Per&s;ian power, Xerxes prepared for marching directly forward into Greece.</P>
<P>He continued his march through Thrace, Macedonia, and The&s;&s;aly, every knee bending before him till he came to the &s;traits of Thermo|pylae, where he fir&s;t found an enemy prepared to di&s;pute his pa&s;&s;age. This army was a body of Spartans, led on by Leonidas their king, who had been &s;ent thither to oppo&s;e him. None of the Grecian &s;tates were found bold enough to face this formidable army but Athens and Lacodaemon. One cannot, without a&s;to|ni&s;hment, reflect on the intrepidity of the&s;e two &s;tates, who determined to face the innumerable army of Xerxes with &s;uch di&s;proportioned forces. Their whole army amounted to only eleven thou&s;and two hundred men. Ari&s;tides was called from bani&s;hment, and placed at the head of their forces.</P>
<P>It was &s;oon re&s;olved to &s;end a body of men to guard the pa&s;s at Thirmopylae, where a few would be capable of acting again&s;t numbers. Thirmopylae was a narrow pa&s;s of twenty five
<PB N="39" REF="026819_0040_1013720207F500A8">feet broad, between The&s;&s;aly and Phocis, de|fended by the remains of a wall, with gates to it. This place was pitched upon, as well for the narrowne&s;s of the way, as for its vicinity to the &s;ea, from whence the land forces could oc|ca&s;ionally receive a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the fleet. The command of this important pa&s;s was given to Leonidas, one of the kings of Sparta, who led thither a body of &s;ix thou&s;and men. They were all along taught to look upon them&s;elves as a forlorn hope, only placed there to check the progre&s;s of the enemy, and give them a fore|ta&s;te of the de&s;perate valour of Greece. Even oracles were not wanting to check their ardour; for it had been declated, that to precure the &s;afety of Greece it was nece&s;&s;ary that a king, one of the de&s;cendants of Hercules, &s;hould die. This ta&s;k was cheerfully under<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ken by Leoni|das; and as he marched but from Lacedoemon, he con&s;idered him&s;elf as a willing victim offered up for the good of his country. However, he joyfully put him&s;elf at the head of his little hand, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his po&s;t, and with de|liberate de&s;peration wai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed at Thirmopylae for the coming up of the Per&s;ian army.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Xerxes approached with his numerous army, flu&s;hed with &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cee&s;t, and confident of victory. His camp exhibited all the marks of Ea&s;tern magni&s;icence and A&s;iatic lux|ury. As he expected to meet no ob&s;tructions on his way to Greece, he was &s;urpri&s;ed to find, that a handful of men would dare to di&s;pute his pa&s;&s;age. He waited four days to give the Greeks time to retire; but they continued their
<PB N="40" REF="026819_0041_10137203AC4A8428">po&s;t a mu&s;ing them&s;elves in their u&s;ual way.&mdash;He &s;ent to them to deliver up their arms; but Leonidas, with a truly Spartan &s;pirit, de&s;ired him <HI>to come and take them.</HI> Xerxes offered, if they would lay down their arms, to recieve them as friends, and to give them a country much lager and better than what they fought for. "No country (they replied) was worth acceptance, unle&s;s won by virtue; and as for their arms, they &s;hould want them, whether as his friends or enemies."</P>
<P>Xerxes, thus treated with contempt, at length ordered a body of Medes to advance, who be|gan the on&s;et, but were repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s. The number of the a&s;&s;ailants only &s;erved to increa&s;e their confu&s;ion; and it now began to appear, that Xerxes had many followers, but few &s;oldiers. The&s;e forces being routed by the Grecian troops, the Per&s;ian immortal band was brought up; but the&s;e were as un&s;ucce&s;sful as the former. Thus did the Greeks keep their ground for two days, and no power on earth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eemed capable of removing them from their advantageous &s;ituation. The Per&s;ians, how|ever, by the treachery of a Grecian de&s;erter, got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an advantageous po&s;t, which commanded the rear of the Spartans.</P>
<P>Leonidas, apprized of this misfortune, and &s;eeing that his po&s;t was no longer tenable, ad|vi&s;ed the troops of his allies to retire, and re|&s;erve them&s;elves for better times and the future &s;afety of Greece. As for him&s;elf, and his fel|low Spartans, they were obliged by their laws not to fly; that he owed a life to his country,
<PB N="41" REF="026819_0042_1013720580D5E1E8">and that it was now his duty to fall in its de|fence. Having thus di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all but his three hundred Spartans, with &s;ome The&s;bians and Thebans, in all not a thou&s;and men, he ex|horted his followers, in the mo&s;t cheerful man|ner, to prepare for death. "Come, my fellow|&s;oldiers, &s;aid he, let us dine cheerfully here, for to-night we &s;hall &s;up with Pluto." His men, upon hearing his determined purpo&s;e, &s;et up a loud &s;hout, as if they had been invited to a banquet, and re&s;olved every man to &s;ell his life as dearly as he could. The night now began to advance, and this was thought the mo&s;t glo|rious opportunity of meeting death in the ene|my's camp. Thus re&s;olved, they made directly to the Per&s;ian tents, and, in the darkne&s;s of the night, had almo&s;t reached the royal pavilion, with hopes of &s;urpri&s;ing the king. The ob|&s;curity added much to the horror of the &s;cene; and the Per&s;ians, falling upon each other with|out di&s;tinction, rather a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Grecians t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an defended them&s;elves. Thus &s;ucce&s;s &s;eemed to crown the ra&s;hne&s;s of their enterprize, until the morning beginning to dawn, the light di&s;|covered the &s;mallne&s;s of their numbers. They were then &s;oon &s;urrounded by the Per&s;ian forces, who fearing to fall in upon them, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ng their javelins from every quarter, till the Greeks, not &s;o much conquered as tired with conquering, fell amid&s;t heaps of the &s;laughtered enemy, leaving behind them an example of intrepidity never known before. Leonidas was one of the fir&s;t that fell, and the endeavours of the Lace-daemon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ans to defend his dead body were i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e|dible.
<PB N="42" REF="026819_0043_1013720A6D7F5E90">Of all the train, two only e&s;caped, who were treated with contempt and infamy.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of Xerxes in this battle was &s;aid to amount to twenty thou&s;and men, among whom were two of his brothers. Xerxes, therefore, di&s;mayed at an ob&s;tinacy that co&s;t him &s;o dear, was for &s;ome time more inclined to try his for|tune at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea, than to proceed immediately into the country, where he was informed, eight thou&s;and Spartans, &s;uch as he had but lately fought with, were ready to receive him. Ac|cordingly, the very day of the battle of Thirmo|pylae, there was an engagement at &s;ea between the two fleets. The Grecian flee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> con&s;i&s;ted of two hundred and &s;eventy-one ve&s;&s;els: that of the enemy had lately lo&s;t four hundred ve&s;&s;els in a &s;hipwreck, but were &s;till greatly &s;uperior to the Grecian fleet.</P>
<P>Xerxes, to repair his lo&s;s by a victory, ordered two hundred Per&s;ian ve&s;&s;els to take a compa&s;s, and &s;urpri&s;e the Grecians lying in the &s;traits of Eubaea; but the Grecians, being appri&s;ed of their de&s;igns, &s;et &s;ail by night, and &s;o, by a counter &s;urpri&s;e, fell in with them while they were thus &s;eparated from the main body, took and &s;unk thirty, forced the re&s;t to &s;ea, and there, by &s;tre&s;s of weather, they were all &s;oon after &s;unk or &s;tranded. Enraged at the&s;e di&s;ap|pointments, the Per&s;ians bore down the next day with the whole fleet, and drawing up in form of an half-moon, made an offer of battle, which the Greeks as readily accepted. The Athenians having been reinforced with three and fi&s;ty &s;ail, the battle was very ob&s;tinate and
<PB N="43" REF="026819_0044_1013720C4C8C1110">bloody, and the &s;ucce&s;s pretty nearly equal on both &s;ides, &s;o that both parties &s;eemed content to retire in good order.</P>
<P>After this, Xerxes, having entered the coun|try of Phocis with his numerous army, plun|dered and burned every town throught which he pa&s;&s;ed. Having &s;ent off a con&s;iderable detach|ment to plunder the temple at Delpho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, with the re&s;t he marched down into Attica, where he found Athens de&s;erted by all but a few in the citadel. The&s;e men de&s;pairing of &s;uccour, and unwilling to &s;urvive the lo&s;s of their country, would li&s;ten to no terms of accommodation: they boldly with&s;tood the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault, and, warmed by the enthu&s;ia&s;m of religion, began to hope for &s;ucce&s;s. However, a &s;econd a&s;&s;ault carried their feeble outworks, they were all put to the &s;word, and the citadel reduced to a&s;hes.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the confederate Greeks de|termined in council, that they &s;hould prepare to receive the Per&s;ians on the i&s;thmus by land, and in the &s;traits of Salamis by &s;ea. Xerxes, after having demoli&s;hed and burned Athens, marched down towards the &s;ea, to act in con|junction with his fleet, which he had determined &s;hould once more come to an engagement with the enemy. The Grecian &s;leet con&s;i&s;ted of three hundred and eighty &s;hips, the Per&s;ian &s;leet was much more numerous; but whatever ad|vantage they had in numbers, and the &s;ize of their &s;hips, they fell infinitely &s;hort of the Greeks in their naval &s;kill, and their acquaint|ance with the &s;eas where they fought.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="026819_0045_101372141E073D98">
Themi&s;tocles, watching a favorable oppor|tunity, gave the &s;ignal for battle, when the Grecian fleet &s;ailed forward, in exact order.

Thus ended the inva&s;ion of Greece, nor ever after was the Per&s;ian army &s;een to cro&s;s the Helle&s;pont.&mdash; During the&s;e events, Xerxes lay at Sardis, ex|pecting a rever&s;ion of his fortune; but me&s;|&s;engers cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">g every hour, loaded with the news of &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tal di&s;a&s;ter, and finding him|&s;elf unable to retrieve his aflairs, he retired further into the country, and endeavoured to drown in luxury and riot the unea&s;y reflections of his &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s ambition. To the want of &s;ucce&s;s abroad was added the contempt of his &s;ubjects at home; and this brought on a train of trea&s;ons, in&s;urrections, &s;acrilege, murder; ince&s;t, and cruelty: &s;o that the latter part of his reign was as &s;candalous, as the fir&s;t part of it had been unfortunate.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of Athens, being thus in a great mea&s;ure freed from its fears of a foreign ene|my, began to cheri&s;h inte&s;tine animo&s;ities, and its citizens laboured with every art to &s;upplant each other in aiming at places of tru&s;t and an|thority. But the conduct of Ari&s;tides, in the di&s;charge of his duty on all occa&s;ions, confirmed the great opinion mankind had formed of his integrity.</P>
<P>Ari&s;tides pre&s;ided over the trea&s;ury with the care of a father over his family, and the caution of a mi&s;er over what he holds dearer than his life. No man complained of his ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nini|&s;tration, and no part of the public money wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> exhau&s;ted in vain.

<PB N="47" REF="026819_0048_1013721C1824EC68">and &s;o far was he from being a&s;hamed of po|verty, that he con&s;idered it as glorious to him as all the victories he had won. Ari&s;tides a&s;|&s;erted, that he only might be &s;aid to want, who permitted his appetites to tran&s;gre&s;s the bounds of his income: and that he, who could di&s;pen&s;e with a few things, thus rendered him|&s;elf more like the gods who want nothing.</P>
<P>Thus he lived, ju&s;t in his public, and inde|pendent in his private character. His hou&s;e was a public &s;chool for virtue, and was open to all young Athenians who &s;ought wi&s;dom, or were ambitious of power. He gave them the kinde&s;t reception, heard them with patience, in&s;tructed them with familiarity, and endea|voured, above all things, to give them a ju&s;t value for them&s;elves. Hi&s;tory does not men|tion the exact time or place of his death; but it pays the mo&s;t glorious te&s;timony to his di&s;in|tere&s;ted character, in telling us, that he who had the ab&s;olute di&s;po&s;al of all the public trea|&s;ures died poor. It is even a&s;&s;erted, that he did not leave money enough behind him to pay the expences of his funeral, but that the go|vernment was obliged to bear the charge of it, and to maintain his family. His daughters were married, and his &s;on &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, at the ex|pence of the public; and &s;ome of his grand|children were &s;upported by a pen&s;ion, equal to that which &s;uch received, who had been victo|rious at the Olympic games. But the greate&s;t honour that his countrymen paid to his me|mory, was in giving him the title of Ju&s;t, a character far &s;uperior to all the empty title of wi&s;dom or conque&s;t; &s;ince fortune or accident
<PB N="48" REF="026819_0049_101371DFEF9C6290">may confer wi&s;dom or valour, but the virtues of morality are &s;olely of our own making.</P>
<P>About the year of the world 3572, a rupture happened between the Athenians and the La|cedaemonians; and thus the Grecian &s;tates, having now no foreign enemy to di&s;turb them, began to harra&s;s and depopulate each other. But a more terrible puni&s;hment now began to threaten them from nature: a plague broke out in the city of Athens, a more terrible one than which is &s;carcely recorded in the annals of hi&s;tory. It is related, that it began in Ethio|pia, from thence de&s;cended into Egypt, then travelled into Lybia and Per&s;ia, and at la&s;t broke out like a flood upon Athens. This pe&s;tilence baffled the utmo&s;t efforts of art; the mo&s;t robu&s;t con&s;titutions were unable to with|&s;tand its attacks; no &s;kill could obviate, nor no remedy di&s;pel the terrible infection. The in|&s;tant a per&s;on was &s;eized, he was &s;truck with de&s;pair, which quite di&s;abled him from attempt|ing a cure. The humanity of friends was as fatal to them&s;elves, as it was ineffectual to the unhappy &s;ufferers. Mo&s;t of the inhabitants, for want of lodging, lived in little cottages, in which they could &s;carce breathe, while the burning heat of the &s;ummer encrea&s;ed the pe&s;|tilential malignity. They were &s;een confu|&s;edly huddled together, the dead as well as the dying; &s;ome crawling through the &s;treets, &s;ome lying along by the &s;ides of fountains, whither they had endeavored to repair, to quench the raging thir&s;t that con&s;umed them. Their very temples were filled with dead bodies, and every
<PB N="49" REF="026819_0050_10137223E97C25D0">part of the city exhibited a dreadful &s;cene of mortality, without the lea&s;t remedy for the pre|&s;ent, or the lea&s;t hopes with regard to futurity. It &s;eized the people with &s;uch violence, that they fell one upon another as they pa&s;&s;ed along the &s;treets. It was al&s;o attended with &s;uch un|common pe&s;tilential vapours, that the very bea&s;ts and birds of prey, though fami&s;hing round the walls of the city, would not touch the bodies of tho&s;e who died of it. Even in tho&s;e who recovered, it le&s;t &s;uch a tincture of its malignity, that it &s;truck upon their &s;en&s;es. It effaced the memory of all the pa&s;&s;ages of their former lives, and they knew neither them|&s;elves, nor their neare&s;t relations. Such was the effects of this dreadful pe&s;tilence; out of the manner in which it ended, and of the num|bers de&s;troyed by it, we have no certain ac|count.</P>
<P>We &s;hall pa&s;s over many particulars of the Peloponne&s;ian war, as they afford only a wretched &s;cene of the citizens of one Grecian &s;tate &s;taining their hands with the blood of others; but we &s;hall be more particular in mentioning the actions and character of tho&s;e heroes and philo&s;ophers, who flouri&s;hed during that period. Among the&s;e, Pericles formed no incon&s;iderable character. He was de&s;cended from the greate&s;t and mo&s;t illu&s;trious families of Athens; his father, Xanthippus, defeated the Per&s;ians at Mycale, and his mother, Aga|ruta, was niece to Cali&s;thenes, who expellant the tyrants, and ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d a popular govern|ment in Athens. He had early thoughts of
<PB N="50" REF="026819_0051_1013722613FF6E38">ri&s;ing in the &s;tate, and took le&s;&s;ons from Anax|agoras, in the philo&s;ophy of nature. He &s;tu|died politics with great a&s;&s;iduity, but particu|larly devoted him&s;elf to eloquence, which, in a popular &s;tate, he con&s;idered as the fountain of all promotion. His &s;tudies were crowned with &s;ucce&s;s; and the poets, his contempora|ries, affirm, that his eloquence was &s;o power|ful, that, like thunder, he &s;hook and a&s;toni&s;h|ed all Greece. He had the art of uniting force and beauty; there was no re&s;i&s;ting the &s;trength of his arguments, or the &s;weetne&s;s of his deli|very. Thucydides, his great opponent, was often heard to &s;ay, that though he had often overthrown him, the power of his per&s;ua&s;ion was &s;uch, that the audience could never perceive him fallen.</P>
<P>To this eloquence he added al&s;o a thorough in&s;ight into human nature, as well as a perfect acquaintance with the di&s;po&s;ition of his audi|tors. It was a con&s;tant &s;aying with him to him&s;elf, "Remember, Pericles, thou art go|ing to &s;peak to men born in the arms of Li|berty, and do thou take care to flatter them in their ruling pa&s;&s;ion." He re&s;embled the tyrant Pi&s;i&s;tratus, not only in the &s;weetne&s;s of his voice, but the features of his face, and his whole air and manner. To the&s;e natural and acquired graces, he added tho&s;e of fortune: he was very rich, and had an exten&s;ive alliance with all the mo&s;t powerful families of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The death of Ari&s;tides, and &s;ome other fa|vourable circum&s;tances, gave opportunities to
<PB N="51" REF="026819_0052_101372282B4627D0">his growing ambition: yet he at fir&s;t concealed his de&s;igns <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ith the mo&s;t cautious re&s;erve, till finding the people encrea&s;e in his intere&s;t, he &s;et him|&s;elf at their head, and oppo&s;ed the principal men of the &s;tate with great appearance of di&s;|intere&s;ted virtue. The chief ob&s;tacle to his ri&s;e was Cimon, who&s;e candour and liberality had gained him a numerous party of all ranks and denominations. In oppo&s;ition to him, Peri|cles called in popular a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and by ex|pending the public money in bribes, large&s;&s;es, and other di&s;tributions, he ea&s;ily gained the mul|titude to e&s;pou&s;e his intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Having thus laid a &s;ecure foundation in po|pularity, he next &s;truck at the council of the Areopagus, which was compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable per&s;ons of all Athens; and, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of one Ephialtes, another popular champion, he drew away mo&s;t cau&s;es from the cognizance of that court, and brought the whole order into contempt. In this manner, while Cimon was permitted to conduct the war abroad, he managed all the &s;upplies at home; and, as it was his intere&s;t to keep Cimon at a di&s;tance, he took care to provide him with a &s;uf|ficiency of foreign employment.</P>
<P>Pericles every day gained new ground, till he at la&s;t found him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the autho|rity of the whole &s;tate. It was then that he be|gan to change his behaviour, and from acting the humble and fawning &s;uppliant, he a&s;&s;umed the haughty airs of royalty. He now no longer &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to the caprice of the people, but changed the democratic &s;tate of Athens in|to
<PB N="52" REF="026819_0053_1013722D204D1AA0">a kind of monarchy, without departing, however, from the public good. He would &s;ometimes, indeed, win his fellow-citizens over to his will; but at other times, when he found them ob&s;tinate, he would in a manner compel them to con&s;ult their own intere&s;ts.&mdash; Thus between power and pur&s;ua&s;ion, public profu&s;ion, and private oeconomy, political fal&s;ehoods, and private integrity, Pericles be|came the principal ruler at Athens, and all &s;uch as were his enemies became the enemies of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Ficklene&s;s and incon&s;tancy, however, were the prevailing characters of the Athenians; and, as the&s;e carried them on to their greate&s;t exce&s;&s;es, they &s;oon brought them hack within the bounds of moderation and prudence. Pe|ricles had long been a favourite. but the &s;tate having &s;uffered great calamities, he at la&s;t came to be obnoxious: they had depo&s;ed him from the command of the army; but &s;oon repented of their ra&s;hne&s;s, and rein&s;tated him, a &s;hort time after, with more than former authority.&mdash; However, he did not live long to enjoy his honours. He was &s;eized with the plague, which, like a malignant enemy, &s;truck its &s;e|vere&s;t blow at parting. Being extremely ill, and ready to breathe his la&s;t, the principal citizens, and &s;uch of his friends that had not for&s;aken him, di&s;cour&s;ing concerning the lo&s;s they were about to &s;u&s;tain, ran over his ex|ploits, and computed the number of his vic|tories. They did not imagine that Pericles at|tended to what they &s;aid, as he &s;eemed in&s;en|&s;ible;
<PB N="53" REF="026819_0054_10137232469739B0">but it was far otherwi&s;e, as not a &s;ingle word of their di&s;cour&s;e had e&s;caped him. At la&s;t, cried he, "Why will you extol a &s;eries of actions, in which Fortune had the greate&s;t part? There is one circum&s;tance which I would not have forgotten, yet which you have pa&s;&s;ed over: I could wi&s;h to have it remem|bered, as the mo&s;t glorious circum&s;tance of my life, that I never yet cau&s;ed a &s;ingle citizen to put on mourning." Thus died Pericles, in whom were united a number of excellent qua|lities without impairing each other. He was as well killed in naval affairs as in the conduct of arraies; as well &s;killed in the arts of rai&s;ing money as of employing it; eloquent in public, and plea&s;ing in private; he was a patron of arti&s;ts, at once informing them by his ta&s;te and example.</P>
<P>Not long after the death of Pericles, the Athenians and Lacedaemonians made peace, and every thing now promi&s;ed a re&s;toration of former tranquility; but a new promoter of troubles was now beginning to make his appear|ance, and from him, tho&s;e who wi&s;hed for peace had every thing to fear: this was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he ce|lebrated Alcibiades, the di&s;ciple of Socrates, a youth equally remarkable for the beauty of his per&s;on, and the graces of his mental accompli&s;h|ments.</P>
<P>The &s;trict intimacy between Alcibiades and Socrates is one of the mo&s;t remarkable circum|&s;tances of his life. This philo&s;opher ob&s;erving excellent natural qualities in him, which were greatly heightened by the beauty of his per&s;on,
<PB N="54" REF="026819_0055_10137233DE14C670">be&s;towed incredible pains in cultivating &s;o va|luable a plant, le&s;t, being neglected, it &s;hould wither as it grew, and in the end degenerate. Alcibiades, indeed, was expo&s;ed to numberle&s;s dangers: the greatne&s;s of his extraction, his va&s;t riches, the authority of his family, the cre|dit of his guardians, his per&s;onal talents, and, &s;till more than the&s;e, the flattery and complai|&s;ance of all who approached him.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the &s;trong endeavours that were u&s;ed to divert this young Athenian from a corre&s;pondence, which alone was capable of &s;ecuring him from &s;o many &s;nares, he devoted him&s;elf entirely to it. He had the mo&s;t un|bounded wit; he was fully &s;en&s;ible of So|crates' extraordinary merit, and could not re|&s;i&s;t the charms of his &s;weetly in&s;inuating elo|quence, which at that time, had a greater a&s;|cendant over him than the alurements of plea|&s;ure. He was &s;o zealous a di&s;ciple of that great ma&s;ter, that he followed him wherever he went, took the utmo&s;t delight in his conver&s;a|tion, received his in&s;tructions, and even his re|primands, with wonderful docility, and was &s;o moved with his di&s;cour&s;es, as even to &s;hed tears, and abhor him&s;elf: &s;o weighty was the force of truth in the mouth of Socrates, and in &s;o odious a light did he &s;how the vices, to which Alcibiades began to abandon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Alcibiades, in tho&s;e moments when he li&s;|tened to Socrates, differed &s;o much from him|&s;elf, that he appeared quite another man. How|ever, his head &s;trong fie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> temper, and his na|tural fondne&s;s for pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> height|ened
<PB N="55" REF="026819_0056_10137236054A89B8">and enflamed by the di&s;cour&s;es and ad|vi&s;es of young people, &s;oon plunged him into his former irregularities, and tore him as it were from his ma&s;ter, who was obliged to pur|&s;ue him as a &s;lave who had e&s;caped correction. This vici&s;&s;itude of flights and returns of virtu|ous re&s;olutions, and relap&s;es into vice, conti|nued a long time; but &s;till Socrates was not di&s;gu&s;ted with his levity, and always flattered him&s;elf with the hopes of bringing him back to his duty. Hence certainly aro&s;e the &s;trong mixture of good and evil that always appeared in his conduct, the in&s;tructions his ma&s;ter had given him &s;ometimes prevailing, and, at other times, the fire of his pa&s;&s;ion hurrying him, in a manner, again&s;t his own will, into things of a quite oppo&s;ite nature. Among the various pa&s;&s;ions that were di&s;covered in him, the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t prevailing was a haughty turn of mind, which would force all things to &s;ubmit to it, and could not bear a &s;uperior, or even an equal.</P>
<P>Alcibiades, with &s;uch a ca&s;t of mind as w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have de&s;cribed, was not born for repo&s;e, and had &s;et every engine at work to rever&s;e the treaty lately concluded between the Athenians and Lacedaemonians. He was di&s;gu&s;ted with the latter, becau&s;e they directed them&s;elves only to Nicias, of whom they had a very high opinion; and, on the contrary, &s;eemed to take no manner of notice of him, though his ance&s;|tors had enjoyed the rights of ho&s;pitality among them.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="026819_0057_1013723B42F16EE8">
Having found means to carry his point again&s;t the Lacedaemonians, he was declared general, and appointed to command the fleet; but was &s;oon afterwards di&s;graced. After having experienced &s;trange vici&s;&s;itudes of for|tune, being &s;ometimes bani&s;hed or condemned to death by the Athenians, at other times at the head of their fleets and armies, he at la&s;t took &s;helter at the court of Per&s;ia, where the Lacedaemonians found means to per&s;uade that monarch to di&s;patch him. Alcibiades was then in a &s;mall town in Phrigia, where he lived with his concubine Timandra. Tho&s;e who were &s;ent to kill him, not daring to enter his hou&s;e, contented them&s;elves with &s;urrounding and &s;et|ting it on fire. Alcibiades having quitted it through the flames, &s;word in hand, the bar|barians were afraid to &s;tay to come to blows with him, but flying and retreating as he ad|vanced, they poured their darts and arrows up|on him from a di&s;tance, and he fell dead upon the &s;pot. Timandra took up his body, and having adorned and covered it with the fine&s;t robes &s;he had, &s;he made as magnificent a fu|neral for it as her condition would admit.</P>
<P>Such was the end of Alcibiades, who&s;e great virtues were &s;tifled and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by &s;till greater vices. It is not ea&s;y to &s;ay, whether his good or bad qualities were mo&s;t pernicious to his country; for with the one he deceived, and with the other he oppre&s;&s;ed it. In him di&s;tingui&s;hed valour was united with robility of blood. He was eloquent, of great ability in affairs, in&s;inuating, and formed for charming
<PB N="57" REF="026819_0058_1013723D644E7EA0">all mankind. He loved glory, but indulged at the &s;ame time, his inclination for plea&s;ure; nor was he &s;o fond of plea&s;ure, as to neglect his glory for it. He knew how to give into, or ab&s;tract him&s;elf from, the allurements of luxury, according to the &s;ituation of his af|fairs. Never was there ductility of genius equal to his: he metamorpho&s;ed him&s;elf, with in|credible facility, into the mo&s;t contrary forms, and &s;upported them all with as much ea&s;e and grace as if each had been natural to him.</P>
<P>The death of Alcibiades naturally leads us to give the character of his ma&s;ter, one of the greate&s;t philo&s;ophers that the world perhaps ever produced, the immortal Socrates. He was the &s;on of an ob&s;cure citizen of Athens, and, emerging from the meanne&s;s of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">irth, he gave a&s;toni&s;hing examples of courage, mo|deration and wi&s;dom. He oppo&s;ed the power of the thirty tyrants, who had u&s;urped the go|vernment of Athens, and &s;poke loudly again&s;t the bigotry and pro&s;ecution of the times. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed unexampled good-nature, and an uni|ver&s;al love to mankind. As it was very diffi|cult to correct the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, and to make people change principles, who revere the errors in which they are grown grey, he devoted his labours principally to the in&s;truction of youth, in order to &s;ow the &s;eeds of virtue in a &s;oil more &s;it to produce the fruits of it. He had no open &s;chool like the re&s;t of the philo&s;ophers, nor &s;et times for his le&s;&s;ons. He had no benches prepared, nor even mounted a pro|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;&s;or's chair; he was the philo&s;opher of all
<PB N="58" REF="026819_0059_101372472F3EE110">times and &s;ea&s;ons; he taught in all places, and upon all occa&s;ions; in walking, conver&s;a|tion at meals, in the army, and in the mid&s;t of the camp, in the public a&s;&s;embly of the &s;e|nate or people. Such was the man, whom a faction in the city had long devoted to de&s;truc|tion: he had been, for many years before his death, the object of their &s;atire and ridicule.</P>
<P>Ari&s;tophanes, the comic poet, was engaged to expo&s;e him on the &s;tage&punc; he compo&s;ed a piece called The Clouds, wherein he introduced the philo&s;opher in a ba&s;ket, uttering the mo&s;t ridiculous ab&s;urdities. This was the fir&s;t blow &s;truck at him; but it was not till twenty years afterwards that Melites appeared in a more for|mal manner as his accu&s;er, and entered a regular proce&s;s again&s;t him. His accu&s;ation con&s;i&s;ted of two heads: the fir&s;t was, that he did not admit the gods acknowledged by the republic, and introduced new divinities; the &s;econd, that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">upted the youth of Athens; and concluded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> inferring, that &s;entence of death ought to be pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t him.

<PB N="59" REF="026819_0060_1013724BE26D0CA0">had attained to the notion of the one only true God, in&s;omuch that, upon the account both of his belief of the Deity, and the exempla|rine&s;s of his life, &s;ome have thought fit to rank him among the Chri&s;tian philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>Upon the day a&s;&s;igned, the proceedings com|menced in the u&s;ual forms, the parties appeared before the judges, and Melitus &s;poke. The wor&s;e his cau&s;e, and the le&s;s it was provided with proofs, the more occa&s;ion he had for addre&s;s and art to cover its weakne&s;s. He omitted nothing that might render Socrates odious; and in&s;tead of rea&s;ons, which could not but fail him, he &s;ub&s;tituted the delu&s;ive glitter of a lively and pompous eloquence. Socrates' defence is con|&s;idered as &s;o great a ma&s;terpiece of ancient ora|tory, that even the narrow limits this work is confined to, will not permit of our pa&s;&s;ing it ever in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>"I am accu&s;ed (&s;aid Socrates) of corrupting the youth, and of in&s;tilling dangerous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> into them, as well in regard to the wor&s;hip <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the gods, as the rules of government. You know, Athenians, that I never made it my profe&s;&s;ion to teach, nor can envy, however violent again&s;t me, reproach me with having &s;old my in&s;tructions. I have an undeniable evidence for me in this re&s;pect, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> poverty. I was always equally ready to com|municate my thoughts either to the rich or poor, and to give them entire lei&s;ure to que&s;|tion or an&s;wer me. My whole employment is to per&s;uade the young and old again&s;t too much love for the body, for riches, all other
<PB N="60" REF="026819_0061_1013724DAADF6EF0">precarious things, of what&s;oever nature they be; and again&s;t too little regard for the &s;oul; which ought to be the object of their affection: for I ince&s;&s;antly urge upon you, that virtue does not proceed from riches, but, on the contrary, riches from virtue; and that all the other goods of human life, as well public as private, have their &s;ource in the &s;ame prin|ciple.</P>
<P>"If to &s;peak in this manner be to corrupt youth, I confe&s;s, Athenians, that I am guilty, and de&s;erve to be puni&s;hed.

But, perhaps, the re&s;erve and con&s;ideration for a ma&s;ter who has in&s;tructed them, will prevent them from declaring again&s;t me; at lea&s;t, their fathers, brothers, and uncles, cannot, as good relations and good citizens, di&s;pen&s;e with their not &s;tanding forth to demand vengeance again&s;t the corrupter of their &s;ons, brothers, and ne|phews. But the&s;e are the per&s;ons who take upon them my defence, and intere&s;t them&s;elves in the &s;ucce&s;s of my cau&s;e.</P>
<P>"Pa&s;s on me what &s;entence you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> plea&s;e, Athenians; but I can neither repent nor change my conduct: I mu&s;t not abandon or &s;u&s;pend a function, which God him&s;elf has impo&s;ed on me. If, after having faithfully kept all the po&s;ts wherein I was placed by our general at Potidaea, Amphipolis, and Delium, the fear of death &s;hould at this time make me abandon that, in which the divine Providence has
<PB N="61" REF="026819_0062_1013724F6F26E470">placed me, by commanding me to pa&s;s my life in the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy, for the in&s;truction of my&s;elf and others; this would be a mo&s;t criminal de&s;ertion indeed, and make me highly worthy of being cited before this tribunal as an impious man, who does not believe the gods. Should you re&s;olve to acquit me, for the fu|ture, I &s;hould not he&s;itate to make an&s;wer, Athenians, I honor and love you, but I &s;hall choo&s;e rather to obey God than you, and to my late&s;t breath &s;hall never renounce my philo|&s;ophy, nor cea&s;e to exhort and reprove you, according to my cu&s;tom, by telling each of you, when you come in my way, My good friend and citizen of the mo&s;t famous city in the world for wi&s;dom and valour, are you not a&s;hamed to have no other thoughts than that of ama&s;&s;ing wealth, and of acquiring glory, credit, and diguities, whil&s;t you neglect the trea&s;ures of prudence, truth, and wi&s;dom, and take no pains in rendering your &s;oul as good and perfect as it is capable of being.</P>
<P>"I am reproached with abject fear and meanne&s;s of &s;pirit, for being &s;o bu&s;y in im|parting my advice to every one in private and for having avoided to be pre&s;ent in your a&s;|&s;emblies, to give my coun&s;el to my country. I think I have &s;ufficiently proved my courage and fortitude, both in the field, where I have borne arms with you, and in the &s;enate when I oppo&s;ed the violence and cruel orders of the thirty tyrants.</P>
<P>"For the re&s;t, Athenians, if, in the ex|treme danger I now am, I do not imitate the
<PB N="62" REF="026819_0063_1013725367797FD0">behaviour of tho&s;e, who, upon le&s;s emergen|cies, have implored and &s;upplicated their judges with tears, and have brought forth their chil|dren, relations, and friends, it is not through pride and ob&s;tinancy, or any contempt for you, but &s;olely for your honor, and for that of the whole city. You &s;hould know, that there are among our citizens tho&s;e, who do not regard death as an evil, and who give that name only to inju&s;tice and infamy. At my age, and with the reputation, true or fal&s;e, which I have, would it be con&s;i&s;tent for me, after all the le&s;|&s;ons I have given upon the contempt of death, to be afraid of it my&s;elf, and to belie in my la&s;t actions all the principles and &s;entiments of my pa&s;t life?</P>
<P>"But without &s;peaking of my &s;ame, which I &s;hould extremely injure by &s;uch a conduct, I do not think it allowable to intreat a judge, nor to be ab&s;olved by &s;upplications. He ought to be per&s;uaded and convinced. The judge does not &s;it upon the bench to &s;hew favour, by violating the laws; but to do ju&s;tice in con|forming to them. He does not &s;wear to di&s;|charge with impunity whom he plea&s;es, but to do ju&s;tice where it is due. We ought not, therefore, to accu&s;tom you to perjury, nor you to &s;uffer your &s;elves to be accu&s;tomed to it; for, in &s;o doing, both the one and the other of us equally injure ju&s;tice and religion, and both are criminals.</P>
<P>"Do not, therefore, expect from me, Athe|nians, that I &s;hould have recour&s;e among you to means, which I believe neither hone&s;t nor
<PB N="63" REF="026819_0064_10137256C0E850A8">lawful; e&s;pecially upon this occa&s;ion, wherein I am accu&s;ed of impiety by Melitus; for, if I &s;hould influence you by my prayers, and there|by induce you to violate your oaths, it would be undeniably evident, that I teach you not to believe in the gods; and even in defending and ju&s;tifying my&s;elf, I &s;hould furni&s;h my ad|ver&s;aries with arms again&s;t me, and prove that I believe no divinity. But I am very far from &s;uch bad thoughts: I am more convinced of the exi&s;tence of God than my accu&s;ers; and &s;o convinced, that I abandon my&s;elf to God and you, that you may judge of me as you &s;hall deem be&s;t for your&s;elves."</P>
<P>Socrates pronounced this di&s;cour&s;e with a firm and intrepid tone: his air, his action, his vi&s;age, expre&s;&s;ed nothing of the accu&s;ed; he &s;eemed the ma&s;ter of his judges, from the a&s;|&s;urance and greatne&s;s of his &s;oul with which he &s;poke, without however lo&s;ing any thing of the mode&s;ty natural to him. But how &s;light &s;oever the proofs were again&s;t him, the faction was powerful enough to find him guilty, and his death was certainly a concerted th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng.</P>
<P>By his fir&s;t &s;entence, the judges only declared Socrates guilty; but when, by his an&s;wer, he appeared to appeal from their tribunal to that of ju&s;tice and po&s;terity; when, in&s;tead of confe&s;|&s;ing him&s;elf guilty, he demanded rewards and honour from the &s;tate, the judges were &s;o very much offended, that they condemned him to drink hemlock, a method of execution in u&s;e among them.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="026819_0065_1013725E072E6CB8">
Socrates received this &s;entence with the ut|mo&s;t compo&s;ure. Apollodorus, one of his di&s;|ciples launching out into bitter invectives, and lamenting that his ma&s;ter &s;hould die <HI>innocent,</HI> "What, (replied Socrates, with a &s;mile.) would you have me die guilty? Melytus and Ayntus may kill, but they cannot hurt me."</P>
<P>After his &s;entence, he &s;till continued with the &s;ame &s;erene and intrepid a&s;pect, with which he had long enforced virtue, and held tyrants in awe. When he entered his pri&s;on, which now became the re&s;idence of virtue and probity, his friends followed him thither, and continued to vi&s;it him during the interval be|tween his condemnation and death, which la&s;t|ed for thirty days.</P>
<P>The day before the death of Socrates, Crito, his intimate friend, went to him early in the morning to let him know, that in depended only on him&s;elf to quit the pri&s;on; that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ailor was gained; that he would find the doors open, and offered him a &s;afe retreat in The&s;&s;aly. Socrates laughed at his propo|&s;al, and an&s;wered, that he reverenced the laws of his country, and re&s;olved to obey them in all things, even in his death.</P>
<P>Socrates employed the la&s;t day of his life in entertaining his friends on the great and im|portant &s;ubject of death; he explained to them all the arguments for believing the &s;oul to be immortal, and refuted all the objections again&s;t it. After he came out of the bath, his chil|dren were brought to him, for he had three,
<PB N="65" REF="026819_0066_1013725F97172DB8">two very little, and the other grown up. He &s;poke to them for &s;ome time, gave orders to the women who took care of them, and then di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed them. Being returned into his chamber, he laid him&s;elf down upon his bed.</P>
<P>The keeper of the pri&s;on entered at the &s;ame in&s;tant, and having informed him, that the time for drinking the hemlock was come, which was at &s;un &s;et, the keeper was &s;o much afflicted with &s;orrow, that he turned his back and fell a weeping. The fatal cup, however, was at la&s;t brought, and Socrates a&s;ked what it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to do. "Nothing more (replied the officer) than as &s;oon as you have drank off the draught, to walk about till you find your legs grow weary, and afterwards to lie down upon your bed." He took the cup without any emotion, or change in his colour or counte|nance, and regarding the man, with a &s;teady and a&s;&s;ured look, "Well, (&s;aid he) what &s;ay you of this drink: may one make a libation out of it?" Upon being told, there was only enough for one do&s;e, "At lea&s;t, (continued he) we may &s;ay our prayers to the gods, as it is our duty, and implore them to make our exit from this world, and our la&s;t &s;tage happy, which is what I mo&s;t earne&s;tly beg of them." After having &s;poken the&s;e words, he kept &s;i|lence for &s;ome time, and then drank off the whole draught with an amazing tranquility and &s;erenity of a&s;pect, not to be expre&s;&s;ed or conceived.</P>
<P>Till then his friends, with great violence to them&s;elves, had refrained from tears; but af|ter
<PB N="66" REF="026819_0067_10137261906981F0">he had drank the potion, they were no longer their own ma&s;ters, and wept abun|dantly. Apollodorus, who had been in tears during almo&s;t the whole conver&s;ation, began then to rai&s;e great tries, and to lament with &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive grief, as pierced the hearts of all that were pre&s;ent. Socrates alone re|mained unmoved, and even reproved his friends, though with his u&s;ual mildne&s;s and good nature. "What are you doing? (&s;aid he to them) Oh! what is become of your vir|tue! Was it not for this I &s;ent away the wo|men, that they might not fall into the&s;e weak|ne&s;&s;es? I have always heard you &s;ay, that we ought to die peaceably, and ble&s;&s;ing the gods. Be at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e, I beg you, and &s;hew more con&s;tancy and re&s;olution." He then obliged them to re|&s;train their tears.</P>
<P>In the mean time he kept walking to and fro; and, when he found his legs grow weary, he laid down upon his bed, as he had been di|rected. The poi&s;on then operated more and more. When Socrates found it began to gain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">on the heart, uncovering his face, which had been covered, without doubt, to prevent any thing from di&s;turbing him in his la&s;t moments, "Crito, (&s;aid he) we owe a cook to Ae&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olapius: di&s;charge that vow for me, and pray do not forget it." Soon after this, he breathed his la&s;t. Crito went to his body, and clo&s;ed his mouth and eyes. Such was the and of Socrates, in the fir&s;t year of the ninety-fifth olympaid, and in the &s;eventieth of his age.</P>

It was not till &s;ome time after the death of this great man, that the people of Athens per|ceived their mi&s;take, and began to repent of it. Their hatred being &s;atisfied, their preju|dices expired, and time having given them an opportunity for reflection, the notorious inju&s;|tice of the &s;entence appeared in all its horrors. Nothing was heard throughout the city but di&s;|cour&s;es in favour of Socrates. The Academy, the Lycaeum, private hou&s;es, publick walks, and market places, &s;eemed &s;till to re-echo the &s;ound of his loved voice. "Here (&s;aid they) he formed our youth, and taught our children to love their country, and to honor their pa|rents. In this place he gave us his admirable le&s;&s;ons, and &s;ometimes made us &s;ea&s;onable re|proaches, to engage us more warmly in the pur&s;uit of virtue. Alas! how have we re|warded him for &s;uch important &s;ervices!" Athens was in univer&s;al mourning and con&s;ter|nation. The &s;chools were &s;hut up, and all ex|erci&s;es &s;u&s;pended. His accu&s;ers were called to account for the innocent blood they had cau&s;ed to be &s;hed: Melitus was condemned to die, and the re&s;t bani&s;hed. Plutarch ob&s;erves, that all tho&s;e, who had any &s;hare in this black ca|lumny, were held in &s;uch abomination among the citizens, that no one would give them fire, an&s;wer them any que&s;tion, nor go into the &s;ame bath with them; and they had the place cleaned where they had bathed, le&s;t they &s;hould be polluted by touching it, which drove them into &s;uch de&s;pair, that many of them killed them&s;elves. The Athentans, not contented

<P>THE Athenians had hitherto taken the lead in the Grecian &s;tates; but the Spartans, who had completely conquered them, became their ma&s;ters, and &s;unk them into ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>At this period, Age&s;ilaus, who was cho&s;en king of Sparta, was &s;ent into A&s;ia with an army, under pretence of freeing the Grecian ci|ties. He gained a &s;ignal victory over the Per|&s;ian general, Ti&s;&s;aphernes, near the river Pacto|clus, where he forced the enemy's camp, and found con&s;iderable plunder. This &s;ucce&s;s in|duced the Per&s;ian monarch, in&s;tead of meeting Age&s;ilaus openly in the field, to &s;ubvert his in|tere&s;t among the Grecian &s;tates by the power of bribery; and indeed this confederacy was now &s;o weakened, its concord and unanimity &s;o to+tally de&s;troyed, that they were open to ever offer. The love of money was now rooted i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their affections, and the Spartans were the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> people that, for a while, &s;eemed to di&s;dain it; but the contagion &s;till &s;preading, even they a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="69" REF="026819_0070_1013726E43148B30">la&s;t yielded to its allurements, and every man &s;ought private emolument, without attending to the good of his country.</P>
<P>The Spartans, however, being freed from the terror of foreign enemies, proceeded to &s;pread terror among the petty &s;tates of Greece, whom they compelled to pay obedience to their will. The&s;e proceedings of the Spartans, however, gave birth to a powerful confederacy again&s;t them; and, through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of engage|ments, both by &s;ea and land, the Spartans grow every day weaker, and their enemies more dar|ing.</P>
<P>It &s;oon began to appear, that the Thebans, one of the &s;tates of Greece, lately oppre&s;&s;ed by the Spartans, were growing into power; and, while Sparta and Athens were weakening each other by mutual conte&s;ts, this &s;tate, which had enjoyed all the emoluments, without any of the expences of the war, was every day growing more vigorous and independent. The Thebans, who now began to take the lead in the affairs of Greece, were naturally a hardy and robu&s;t peo|ple, of &s;low intellects, and &s;trong con&s;titutions. It was a con&s;tant maxim with them, to &s;ide either with Athens or Sparta in their mutual conte&s;ts, and which &s;oever they inclined to, they were generally of weight enough to turn the balance. However, they had hitherto made no other u&s;e of that weight than to &s;ecure them|&s;elves; but the &s;pirit which now appeared among them was fir&s;t implanted by Pelopidas, their deliverer from the Spartan yoke; but &s;till further carried to its utmo&s;t height by Epima|nondas,
<PB N="70" REF="026819_0071_10137275B811B6C8">who now began to figure in the affairs of Greece.</P>
<P>Epimanondas was one of tho&s;e few exalted characters, who have &s;carce any vice, and al|mo&s;t every virtue, to di&s;tingui&s;h them from the re&s;t of mankind. Though in the beginning, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every quality nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;er|vice of the &s;tate, he cho&s;e to lead a private life, employed in the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy, and &s;hew|ing an example of the mo&s;t rigid ob&s;ervance of all its doctrines. Truly, a philo&s;opher, and poor out of ta&s;te, he de&s;pi&s;ed riches, without affecting any reputation from that contempt; and, if Ju&s;tin may be credited, he coveted glory as little as he did money. It was always again&s;t his will that commands were conferred upon him; and he behaved him&s;elf, when inve&s;ted with them, in &s;uch a manner as did more honour so dignities, than dignities did to him. Fond of lei&s;ure, which he devoted to the &s;tudy of philo|&s;ophy, he &s;hunned public employments, and made no intere&s;t but to be excluded from them. His moderation concealed him &s;o well, that he lived ob&s;cure, and almo&s;t unknown. His me|rit, however, di&s;covered him at la&s;t. He was taken from his &s;olitude by force, to be placed as the head of armies; and he demon&s;trated, that philo&s;ophy, though generally held in contempt with tho&s;e who a&s;pire at the glory of arms, is wonderfully u&s;eful in forming heroes; for it was, in his opinion, a great advance towards conquering an enemy, to know how to conquer our&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="026819_0072_1013727961A18AF8">
Such was the general appointed to command the Theban army, and act in conjuction with Pelopidas. The Thebans being left out in the general treaty of peace, and thus having the Spartans and Athanians again&s;t them, they ap|peared under the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation, and all Greece looked upon them as lo&s;t and undone. Nothing now remained on both &s;ides but to prepare for action. Epimanondas immediately rai&s;ed all the troops he could, and began his march; but his army did not amount to &s;ix thou&s;and men, while the enemy had above four times that number.</P>
<P>The two armies met at Leuctra, and drew up on a plain. Cleombrotus was upon the right, at the head of a body con&s;i&s;ting of Lacedaemonians, in whom he confided mo&s;t, and who&s;e files were twelve deep, to take the advantage, which his &s;uperiority of hor&s;e gave him in an open coun|try. Archidamus, the &s;on of Age&s;ilaus, was at the head of the allies, who formed the left wing.</P>
<P>Epimanondas, who re&s;olved to charge with his left, which he commanded in per&s;on, &s;trengthened it with the choice of his heavy armed troops, whom he drew up fifty deep; the &s;acred battalion was upon his left, and clo&s;ed the wing; the re&s;t of his infantry were po&s;ted upon his right, in an oblique line, which, the farther it extended, was the more di&s;tant from the enemy. By this uncommon di&s;po&s;ition, his de&s;ign was to cover his flank on the right; to keep off his right wing, as a kind of re&s;erved body, that he might not hazard the event of the
<PB N="72" REF="026819_0073_1013727D59ADD658">battle upon the weake&s;t part of his army. He was a&s;&s;ured that, if he could penetrate the La|cedaemonian phalanx, the re&s;t of the army would &s;oon be put to the rout.</P>
<P>The action began with the cavalry. As the The|bans were better mounted, and braver troops than the Lacedaemonian hor&s;e, the latter were not long before they were broken, and driven upon the infantry, which they put into &s;ome confu|&s;ion. Epimanondas following his hor&s;e clo&s;e, marched &s;wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tly up to Cleombrotus, and fell upon his phalanx with all the weight of his heavy battalion. The latter, to make a diver|&s;ion, detached a body of troops, with orders to take Epimanondas in flank, and to &s;urround him. Pelopidas upon &s;ight of that movement, advanced with incredible &s;peed and boldne&s;s, at the head of the Sacred Battalion, to prevent the enemy's de&s;ign, and flanked Cleombrotus him|&s;elf, who, by that &s;udden and unexpected unexpected at|tack, was put into diferder. The battle w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> very fierce and ob&s;tinate; and, whil&s;t Cleom|brotus could act, the victory continued i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;u&s;pence, and declared for neither party. But when he fell dead with his wounds, the The|bans, to complete the victory, and the Lacedae|monians, to avoid the &s;hame of abandoning the body of their king, redoubled their efforts, and a great &s;laughter en&s;ued on both &s;ides.

The Thebands remained ma&s;ters of the field of battle, erected a trophy, and permitted the ene|my to bury their dead.</P>
<P>The Lacedaemonians had never received &s;uch a blow: the mo&s;t bloody defeat, till then, had &s;carce ever co&s;t them more than four or five hundred of their citizens; here they lo&s;t four thou&s;and men, of whom one thou&s;and were La|cedaemonians, and four hundred Spartans, out of &s;even hundred who were in the battle. The Thebans had only three hundred men killed, among whom were four of their citizens.</P>
<P>So great a victory was followed with in&s;tan|taneous effects: numbers of the Grecian &s;tates, who had hitherto remained neuter, now de|clared in favour of the conquerors, and en|crea&s;ed their army to the amount of 70,000 men. Epimanondas entered Laconia with an army, the twelfth part of which were not The|bans; and finding a country hitherto un|touched by an enemy, he ran through it with fire and &s;word, de&s;troying and plundering, as far as the river Eurotas.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Spartans, &s;truck with con&s;ternation at their late defeat, applied to the Athenians for &s;uccour, who, after &s;ome he&s;itation, determined to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with all
<PB N="74" REF="026819_0075_101372848B0430C0">their forces; and a &s;light advantage the Spar|tans had gained over the Thebans, in which they did not lo&s;e a man, gave a promi&s;ing dawn of &s;ucce&s;s. The war was then carried on with unabating vigour on both &s;ides. The Theban troops were headed by their favourite general Epimanondas; tho&s;e of Sparta by Age&s;ilaus, the only man in Greece that was then able to oppo&s;e him.</P>
<P>Epimanondas, having failed in an attack up|on Sparta, was re&s;olved, before he laid down his command, which was now nearly expiring, to endeavour to effect &s;omething that might compen&s;ate for his failure. In order to protect Sparta, Age&s;ilaus had withdrawn all the troops from Mantinca; thither, therefore, Epima|nondas re&s;olved to bend his cour&s;e. Being de|termined to attack the town, he di&s;patched a troop of hor&s;e to view its &s;ituation, and to clear the fields of &s;tragglers; but ju&s;t before they had reached Mantinea, an army of &s;ix thou&s;and Athenian auxiliaries arrived by &s;ea, who, without taking any refre&s;hment to their men or hor&s;es, ru&s;hed out without the city, and attacked and defeated the Theban hor&s;e. In the mean time, Epimanondas was advancing with his whole army, with the enemy clo&s;e up|on his rear. Finding it impo&s;&s;ible to accom|pli&s;h his purpo&s;e, before he would be over|taken, he determined to halt and give them battle. He had now got within a &s;hort way of the town, which has had the honour of giving its name to the conflict of that day&mdash;a conflict
<PB N="75" REF="026819_0076_1013728BB2C38778">the mo&s;t &s;plendid and be&s;t conte&s;ted, that ever figured in the ho&s;tory of any country.</P>
<P>The Greeks had never fought among them|&s;elves with more numerous armies: the Lace|daemonians con&s;i&s;ted of more than twenty thou|&s;and foot, and two thou&s;and hor&s;e; the The|bans, of thirty thou&s;and foot, and three thou|&s;and hor&s;e. The Theban general marched in the &s;ame order of battle, in which he intended to fight, that he might not be obliged, when he came up with the enemy, to lo&s;e, in di&s;po|&s;ing of his army, a precious time that cannot be recovered.</P>
<P>He did not march directly, and with his front to the enemy, but in a column upon the hills, with his left wing foremo&s;t, as if he did not intend to fight that day. When he was oppo&s;ite to them, at a quarter of a league's di&s;|tance, he made the troops halt, and lay down their arms, as if he de&s;igned to encamp there. The enemy, in effect, were deceived by his &s;tand; and, reckoning no longer upon a battle, they quitted their arms, di&s;per&s;ed them|&s;elves about the camp, and &s;uffered that ar|dor to be extingui&s;hed, which a near approach of a battle is accu&s;tomed to kindle in the hearts of &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>Epimanondas, however, by &s;uddenly wheel|ing his troops to the right, having changed his column into a line, and having drawn out the choice troops, whom he had in his march po&s;ted in front, made them double their files upon the front of his left wing, to add to its &s;trength, and to put it into a condition to attack in point
<PB N="76" REF="026819_0077_1013728DA2316330">the Lacedaemonian phalanx, which, by the movement he had made, faced it directly. He ordered the center and right wing of his army to move very &s;lowly, and to half before they came up, with the enemy, that he might not hazard the event of the battle upon troops, of whom he had no great opinion.</P>
<P>He expected to decide the victory by that body of cho&s;en troops, which he commanded in per&s;on, and which he had formed into a co|lumn to attack the enemy in a wedge-like point. He had per&s;uaded him&s;elf, that if he could penetrate the Lacedaemonian phalanx, in which the enemy's principal force con&s;i&s;ted, he &s;hould not find it difficult to rout the re&s;t of the army, by charging upon the right and left with his victorious troops. After having di&s;|po&s;ed his whole army in this manner, he moved on to charge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> enemy with the whole weight of his column. They were &s;trangely &s;urpri&s;ed when they &s;aw Epimanondas advance to them in this order, and re&s;umed their arms, bridled their hor&s;es, and made all the ha&s;te they could to their ranks.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Epimanodas marched again&s;t the enemy, the cavalry that covered his flank, on the left, the be&s;t at that time in Greece, en|tirely compo&s;ed of Thebans and The&s;&s;alians, had orders to attack the enemy's hor&s;e.

<P>The furious &s;laughter on both &s;ides having continued a great while, without the victory inclining to either, Epimanondas, to force it to declare for him, thought it his duty to make an extraordinary effort in per&s;on, without re|gard to the danger of his own life.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>DURING the&s;e tran&s;actions, a power was growing up in Greece, hitherto unob|&s;erved, but now too con&s;picuous and formi|dable to be overlooked in the general picture: this was that of the Macedonians; a people hitherto ob&s;cure, and in a manner barbarous; and who, though warlike and courageous, had never yet pre&s;umed to intermeddle in the af|fairs of Greece. Now &s;everal circum&s;tances concurred to rai&s;e them from that ob&s;curity, and to involve them in mea&s;ures, which, by degrees, wrought a thorough change in the &s;tate of Greece.</P>
<P>This &s;tate began to make a figure about the beginning of the ninety-&s;ixth Olympiad. Phi|lip, the father of Alexander the Great, who had been the pupil of Epimanondas, was no &s;ooner become king of Macedon, than he began to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf. He &s;ucceeded in every thing he undertook, by the art|fulne&s;s of his addre&s;s, and the force of his eloquence, of which he was a great ma&s;ter.&mdash; He fir&s;t gained the affections of his &s;ubjects, then trained and exerci&s;ed them. and reformed their di&s;cipline. It was at this time he in&s;ti|tuted the famous Macedonian phalanx, which did &s;o much execution. It was an improve|ment upon the ancient manners of fighting among the Grecians, who generally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">w up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eir foot &s;o clo&s;e, as to &s;tand the &s;hock of the
<PB N="82" REF="026819_0084_101372ACBA375DB8">enemy without being broken. The complete phalanx was thought to contain above &s;ixteen thou&s;and men; but this of Philip's invention is de&s;cribed by Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ybins to be an oblong figure, con&s;i&s;ting of eight thou&s;and pikemen, &s;ixteen deep, and five hundred in front, the men &s;tand|ing &s;o clo&s;e together, that the pikes of the fifth rank were extended three feet beyond the line of the front. The re&s;t, who&s;e di&s;tance from the front redered their pikes u&s;ele&s;s, re&s;ted them upon the &s;houlders of tho&s;e who &s;tood before them, and &s;o locking them together in file, pre&s;&s;ed forward to &s;upport and pu&s;h on the for|mer ranks, whereby the a&s;&s;ault was rendered more violent and irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>Philip having, by &s;ome means or other, &s;et the Greeks to quarrelling among them&s;elves, thought it his intere&s;t to remain neuter in the commotions he had partly occa&s;ioned. It was con&s;i&s;tent with the ambitious policy of this prince to be intent only upon his own intere&s;t, and not to engage in a war, by which he could reap not the lea&s;t benefit; and to take advan|tage of a juncture, in which all Greece, employ|ed and divided by a great war, gave him an op|portunity to extend his frontiers, and pu&s;h his conque&s;ts, without any apprehen&s;ions of oppoli|tion. He was al&s;o well plea&s;ed to &s;ee both par|ties weaken and con&s;ume each other, as he &s;hould thereby be enabled to fall upon them afterwards to greater advantage.</P>
<P>Philip, as &s;oon as his &s;on Alexander was born, lo&s;t no time in acquainting Ari&s;totle of what had happend. He wrote to that di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
<PB N="83" REF="026819_0085_101372B0F9DF8958">philo&s;opher, in terms the mo&s;t polite and flattering; begging of him to come and undertake his education, and to be&s;tow on him tho&s;e u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons of inaguanimity and virtue, which every great man ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and which his numerous avocations rendered im|po&s;&s;ible to be attempted by him. He added, "I return thanks to the Gods, not &s;o much for having given me a &s;on, as for having given him to me in the age in which Ari&s;tole lives."</P>
<P>Though brevity will not permit us to follow every method Philip took to en&s;lave all Greece, yet we mu&s;t not omit to mention a circum&s;tance that happened at the &s;iege of Merhone, where Philip lo&s;t one of his eyes in a very &s;ingular manner. A&s;ter of Amphipolis had offered his &s;ervices to Philip, telling him, that he was &s;o excellent a mark&s;man, that he could bring down birds in their mo&s;t rapid flight. The monarch made this an&s;wer: "Well, I will take you into my &s;ervice, when I make war upon &s;tarlings;" which an&s;wer &s;tung the archer to the quick. A repartee prove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> often of fatal con&s;equence to him who makes it. A&s;ter, having thrown him&s;elf into the city, let fly an arrow, on which was written, "To Philip's left eye." This carried a mo&s;t cruel proof that he was a good mark&s;man, for he hit him in the right eye; and Philip &s;ent him back the &s;ame arrow, with this in&s;cription. "If Philip takes the city, he will hang up A&s;ter;" and accord|ingly he was as good as his word. A &s;kilful &s;urgeon drew the arrow out of Philip's eye with &s;o much art and dexterity, that not the lea&s;t
<PB N="84" REF="026819_0086_101372B56577EB40">&s;car remained; and though he could not &s;ave his eye, yet he took away the blemi&s;h.</P>
<P>The ha&s;ty &s;trides Philip was now making to|wards en&s;laving all Greece, particularly at|tracted the attention of Demo&s;thenes, who rou&s;ed the Athenians from their lethargy of plea&s;ure. This celebrated orator &s;aw, from the beginning, the ambition of Philip, and the power, of which he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to carry him through his de&s;igns. This illu&s;trious orator and &s;tate&s;men was born in the la&s;t year of the ninety ninth Olympiad. He was the &s;on of an eminent Athenian citizen, who rai&s;ed a con&s;i|derable fortune by the manufacture of arms. At the age of &s;even years, he lo&s;t his father; and, to add to this misfortune, the guardians, to whom he was entru&s;ted, wa&s;ted and embezzled a con&s;iderable part of his inheritance. Thus oppre&s;&s;ed by fraud, and di&s;couraged by a weak and effeminate habit of body, he yet di&s;covered an early ambition to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf as a popular &s;peaker. His fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay was made a|gain&s;t his guardian, by whom he had been &s;o injuriou&s;ly treated; but the goodne&s;s of his cau&s;e was here of more &s;ervice than the abilities of the young orator: for his early attempts were unpromi&s;ing. He twice afterwards attempted to harrangue the people; but he &s;ucceeded &s;o badly, that they even hi&s;&s;ed him, when he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt away a&s;hamed, confounded, and quite in de|&s;pair.</P>
<P>After a length of time, however, after proper in&s;tructions&punc; and unwearied application, he ap|peared again in public, and &s;ucceeded &s;o we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">
<PB N="85" REF="026819_0087_101372B7A70472F8">that people flocked from all parts of Greece to hear him. From thence he was looked upon as the &s;tandard of true eloquence, in&s;omuch that none of his contry men have been put in com|pari&s;on with him, nor even among the Romans, any but Cicero. His eloquence was grave and au&s;tere, like his temper; ma&s;culine and &s;ub|lime, bold, forcible, and impetuous; abound|ing with metaphors, apo&s;trophes, and interro|gations, which, with his &s;olemn way of invok|ing and appealing to the gods, the planets, the elements, and the manes of tho&s;e who fell at Salamis and Marathon, had &s;uch a wonderful effect upon his hearers, that they thought him in&s;pired. But Demo&s;thenes could not have made &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions on them, if his talent of &s;peaking had not been &s;upported by their opinion of his integrity. It was that which added weight and empha&s;is to every thing he &s;aid, and animated the whole; it was that which chiefly engaged their attention, and de|termined their councils, when they were con|vinced he &s;poke from his heart and had no in|tere&s;t to manage but that of the community. Of this he gave the &s;tronge&s;t proof in his zeal again&s;t Philip, who &s;aid he was of more weight again&s;t him than all the fleets and armies of the Athenians, and that he had no enemy but De|mo&s;thenes. He was not wanting in his en|deavours to corrupt him, as he had done mo&s;t of the leading men in Greece; but this great orator, with&s;tood all his efforts; and as it was ob&s;erved, all the gold in Macedon could not bribe him.</P>

Though Philip's public character was by no means a credit to him, yet the following act of private ju&s;tice does him honour. A certain &s;oldier in the Macedonian army had, in many in&s;tances, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by extraordinary acts of valour, and had received many marks of Philip's favour and approbation. On &s;ome occa&s;ion, he embarked on board a ve&s;&s;el, which was wrecked in a violent &s;torm, he him&s;elf ca&s;t on the &s;hore helple&s;s and naked, and &s;carce|ly with the appearance of life. A Macedonian, who&s;e lands were contiguous to the &s;ea, came opportunely to be witne&s;s of his di&s;tre&s;s, and with all humane and charitable tenderne&s;s, flew to the relief of the unhappy &s;tranger. He bore him to his hou&s;e, laid him in his own bed, re|vived, cheri&s;hed, comforted, and for forty days &s;upplied him freely with all the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniences, which his langui&s;hing condition could require. The &s;oldier, thus happily re&s;|cued from death, was ince&s;&s;ant in the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude to his benefactor, a&s;&s;ured him of his intere&s;t with the king, and of his power and re&s;olution of obtaining for him, from the royal bounty, the noble returns which &s;uch extraordinary benevolence had merited. He was now completely recovered, and his kind ho&s;t &s;upp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ied him with money to pur&s;ue his journey.</P>
<P>Some time after, the &s;oldier pre&s;ented him&s;elf before the king; he recounted his misfortunes, magnified his &s;ervices, and, having looked with an eye of envy on the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the man who had pre&s;erved his life, was now &s;o aban|doned
<PB N="87" REF="026819_0089_101372C1D3A90CF0">to every &s;en&s;e of gratitude, as to reque&s;t the king to be&s;tow upon him the hou&s;e and lands where he had been &s;o kindly and tenderly entertained. Unhappily, Philip, without ex|amination, incon&s;iderately and precipitately granted his infamous reque&s;t. This &s;oldier now returned to his pre&s;erver, repaid his good|ne&s;s by driving him from his &s;ettlement, and taking immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the fruits of his hone&s;t indu&s;try. The poor man, &s;tung with this in&s;tance of unparalleled ingratitude and in|&s;en&s;ibility, boldly determined, in&s;tead of &s;ub|mitting to his wro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gs, to &s;eek relief; and, in a letter addre&s;&s;ed to Philip, repre&s;ented his own and the &s;oldier's conduct, in a lively and affect|ing manner. The king was in&s;tantly fired with Indignation, and ordered that ju&s;tice &s;hould be done without delay; that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;hould be immediately re&s;tored to the man, who&s;e cha|ritable office<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had been thus horribly repaid; and, having &s;eized the &s;oldier, cau&s;ed the&s;e words to be branded on his forehead. "The Ungrateful Gue&s;t:" a character infamous in every age, and among all-nations; but parti|cularly among the Greeks, who, from the ear|lie&s;t times, were mo&s;t &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;ervant of the laws of ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>Philip, having proved un&s;ucce&s;sful in his at|tacks on the Grecian States, marched again&s;t Athens, king of Scythia, from whom he had received &s;ome per&s;onal cau&s;e of di&s;content, and cook his &s;on Alexander with him in this expe|dition. Though the Scythians had a very nu|merous army, he defeated them without any

<P>At his return from Scythia, the Triballi, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> people of Moe&s;ia, di&s;puted the pa&s;s with him, laying claim to part of the plunder he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> rying off.

<P>The fatal morning now arrived, which was for ever to decide the cau&s;e of liberty, and the empire of Greece. Before the ri&s;ing of the &s;un, both armies were ranged in order of battle. The Thebans, commanded by Theogenes, a man of but moderate abilities in war, and &s;u&s;pected of corruption, obtained the po&s;t of honor on the right wing of the confederate Greeks, with that famous body in the front, called the Sacred Band, formed of generous and warlike youths, connected and endeared to each other by all the noble enthu&s;ia&s;m of love and friend&s;hip. The centre was formed of the Corinthians and Peloponne&s;ians, and the Athe|nians compo&s;ed the le&s;t wing, led by their ge|nerals Ly&s;icles and Chares. On the left of the Macedonian army &s;tood Alexander, at the head of a cho&s;en body of noble Macedonians, &s;up|ported by the famous cavalry of The&s;&s;aly. As this prince was then but nineteen years old, his father was careful to curb his youthful impetu|o&s;ity, and to direct his valour, and for this pur|po&s;e &s;urrounded him with a number of expe|rienced
<PB N="90" REF="026819_0093_101372D2D65BA9D0">officers. In the centre were placed tho&s;e Greeks who had united with Philip, and on who&s;e courage he had the lea&s;t dependence; while the king him&s;elf commanded on the right wing, where his renowned phalanx &s;tood, to oppo&s;e the impetuo&s;ity, with which the Atheni|ans were well known to begin their on&s;et.</P>

At the &s;ame time, the Athenians, on the right wing, fought with a &s;pirit and intrepidity wor|thy of the character which they boa&s;ted, and of the cau&s;e by which they were animated. Many brave efforts were exerted on each &s;ide, and &s;ucce&s;s was for &s;ome time doubtful; till at length, part of the center, and the left wing of the Macedonians, except the phalanx, yielded to the impetuous atrack of the Athenians, and ded with &s;ome precipitation. Happy had it been on that day for Greece, if the conduct and abilities of the Grecian generals had been equal to the valour of their &s;oldiers; but the&s;e brave champions of liberty were led on by the de&s;picable creatures of intrigue and cabal.&mdash; Tran&s;ported by the advantage now obtained, the pre&s;umptuous Ly&s;icles cried out, "Come of, my gallant countrymen, the victory is ours; let us pur&s;ue the&s;e cowards, and drive them to Macedon." Thus, in&s;tead of improving the happy opportunity, by charging the phalanx in flank, and &s;o breaking that formidable body, the Athenians wildly and precipitately pre&s;&s;ed forward, in pur&s;uit of the flying enemy, them|&s;elves in all the di&s;order and tumult of a rout.</P>
<P>Philip &s;aw this fatal error with all the con|tempt of a &s;kilful general, and the &s;ecret exul|tation ari&s;ing from the a&s;&s;urance of aporoach|ing victory. He cooly ob&s;erved to the officers that &s;tood round him, that the Athenians knew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> how to conquer. He ordered the phalanx to change its potition, and, by a &s;udden evolu|tion, to gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an adjacent eminence. From thence they marched deliberately down,
<PB N="92" REF="026819_0095_101372D7D8C01710">firm and collected, and fell, with their united force, on the Athenians, now confident of &s;uc|ce&s;s, and blind to their danger. The &s;hock was irre&s;i&s;tible, they were at once overwhelmed, many of them lay cru&s;hed by the weight of the enemy, and expiring by their wounds; while the re&s;t e&s;caped from the dreadful &s;laughter by a &s;hameful and precipitate &s;light, bearing down, and hurrying away with them, tho&s;e troops that, had been &s;tationed for their &s;upport. Now Demo&s;thenes, that renowned orator and &s;tate&s;|man, who&s;e noble &s;entiments and &s;pirited ha|rangues had rai&s;ed the courage on this day &s;o eminently excited, betrayed that weakne&s;s, which has &s;ullied his great character. He alone, of all his countrymen, advanced to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> charge cold and di&s;mayed; and, on the v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> fir&s;t appearance of a rever&s;e of fortune, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> agony of terror, turned his back, ca&s;t away that &s;hield, which he had adorned with this in&s;crip|tion, in golden characters, "To Good For|tune," and appeared the foremo&s;t in the general ront. The ridicule and malice of his enemies related, or perhaps invented, another &s;hameful circum&s;tance; being impeded in his &s;light by &s;ome brambles, his imagination was &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the pre&s;ence of an enemy, that he loudly cri|ed out for quarter.</P>
<P>While Philip was thus triumphant on his &s;ide, Alexander continued the conflict on the other wing, and at length broke the Thebans in &s;pite of all their acts of valor, who now fled from the field, and were pur&s;ued with great carnage. The center of the confederates war

But &s;laughter enough had been already made; more than one thou&s;and of the Athenians lay dead on the field of battle, two thou&s;and were made pri&s;oners. and the lo&s;s of the Thebans was not inferior. Philip, therefore, determined to conclude his important victory by an act of apparent clemency, which his ambition and policy really dictated. He gave orders that the Greeks &s;hould be &s;pared, con|&s;cious of his own de&s;igns, and &s;till expecting to appear in the field the head and leader of that body, which he had now completely conquered.</P>
<P>This defeat was attributed chiefly to the ill conduct of the generals Ly&s;icles and Chares; the former whereof the Athenians put to death at the in&s;tance of a judge, named Lycurgus, who had great credit and influence with the people, but was a &s;evere judge, and a mo&s;t bitter accu&s;er. "You, Ly&s;icles, (&s;aid he) were general of the army: a thou&s;and citizens were &s;lain, and two thou&s;and taken pri&s;oners; a tro|phy has been erected to the di&s;honour of this city, and all Greece is en&s;laved. You had the command when all the&s;e things happened; and yet you dare to live, to view the light of the fun, and blu&s;h not to appear publicly in the forum: you, Ly&s;icles, who are born the mo|nument of your country's &s;hame!" It does not appear that Charles underwent any kind of per|&s;ecution for his &s;hare of this action; though, according to his general character, he de&s;erved it more than his colleague: he had no talent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> command, and was very little different

<P>After the battle of Chaeronea, &s;uch orators as oppo&s;ed Demo&s;thenes, having all ri&s;en up in concert again&s;t him, and having cited him to take his trial according to law, the people not only declared him innocent of the &s;everal accu|&s;ations laid to his charge, but conferred on him additional honors.</P>
<P>Philip, however, did not long enjoy the fruits of his conque&s;ts in Greece. Pau&s;anius, a young Macedonian nobleman, having receiv|ed a mo&s;t &s;hameful in&s;ult from Attilus, a rela|tion of Philip's, he applied to the monarch for redre&s;s; but not being able to obtain it, he re|&s;olved on the de&s;truction of Philip.

His de&s;ign had been for &s;ome time premeditated, and now was the dread|ful moment of effecting is. As Philip marched on in all his pride and pomp, this young Mace|donian &s;lipped through the crowd, and, with a de&s;perate and revengeful re&s;olution, waited his approach in a narrow pa&s;&s;age, ju&s;t at the en|trance into the theatre.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>IN the year of the world 3648, and 356 be|fore the birth of Chri&s;t, Alexander, the &s;on of Philip, a&s;cended the throne of Macedon; and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a kingdonm rendered flou|ri&s;hing and powerful by the policy of the pre|ceding reign. Alexander, upon his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, &s;aw him&s;elf &s;urrounded with ex|treme dangers; the barbarous nations, with whom Philip contended during his whole reign, thought this change for their advantage; and, de&s;pi&s;ing the youth and inexperience of the young monarch, re&s;olved to &s;eize this opportu|nity of regaining their freedom. Nor had he le&s;s to fear from the Greeks them&s;elves, who now thought this a convenient opportunity to re&s;tore their ancient form of government; re|venge their former injuries, and reclaim tho&s;e rights they had enjoyed for ages. Alexander; however, re&s;olved to prevent their machina|tions, and to give them no time to complete their confederacies again&s;t him. He made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to check the arms of the barbe|rians, by marching his troops to the banks of the Danube, which he cro&s;&s;ed in one night&mdash; He defeated the king of the Triballi in a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> battle, made the Ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ae fly at his approach, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>The fir&s;t object of Alexander's ambition was the conque&s;t of Per&s;ia: and he now expected, that he &s;hould have lei&s;ure and opportunity to prepare for &s;o great an enterprize. He was however, &s;oon called to a new undertaking; for the Athenians, Thebans, and Lacedaemo|nians, united again&s;t him, hoping by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of Per&s;ia, to recover their freedom. Ex|pedition and activity were the characteri&s;ties of Alexander. Having heard of the union formed again&s;t him by the Grecian States, he cro&s;&s;ed over the craggy top of Mount O&s;&s;a, to elude the The&s;&s;ilonians, who had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the defiles lying between The&s;&s;aly and Ma|cedon; and moved on with &s;uch rapidity, that his appearance in Greece gave the fir&s;t news of his preparation for war. A great battle was &s;oon fought, in which the Thebans exerted them&s;elves with a bravery and ardour much above their &s;trength; but they were at la&s;t &s;ur|rounded on all &s;ides, the greate&s;t part of them were cut to pieces, and the city taken, plun|dered and de&s;troyed. However, he &s;et at liberty the prie&s;ts; all &s;uch as liad a right of ho&s;pitaliry with the Macedonians; the de&s;cendants of Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dar, the famous poet, who had done &s;o much to Greece; and &s;uch as had oppo&s;ed the revolt: but all the re&s;t in number about thirty thou&s;and, he &s;old; and upwards of &s;ix thou&s;and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">iled in battle.</P>

This dreadful example of &s;everity towards &s;o powerful a city as Thebes, &s;pread the terror of his arms through all Greece, and made all things give way before him.

<P>Having thus far accompli&s;hed his wi&s;hes, and after having completely &s;ettled his affairs in Macedonia, he &s;et out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or A&s;ia in the begin|ning of the &s;pring. His army con&s;i&s;ted of little mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e than thirty thou&s;and foot, and four or five thou&s;and hor&s;e; but they were all brave men, well di&s;ciplined, and enured to fatigue. They had made &s;evera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> campaigns under Philip <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> were each of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity capa|ble of commanding. Mo&s;t of the officers were
<PB N="99" REF="026819_0102_101372E203749520">near three-&s;core years of age, and the common men fifty; and when they were either a&s;&s;em|bled, or drawn up at the head of a camp, they had the air of a venerable &s;enate. Such was the army that was to decide the fortune, not on|ly of Greece, but of all the ea&s;tern world.</P>
<P>When the news of Alexander's landing in A&s;ia, without oppo&s;ition, was brought to Da|rius, he te&s;tified the utmo&s;t contempt for the Macedonian army, and indignation at the pre|&s;umption of their generals. In a letter which he wrote, he reprehended his andacious in&s;o|lence, and gave orders to his various governors, in the different parts of his dominions, that, if they took Alexander alive, to whip him with rods, make pri&s;oners of his whole army, and &s;end them as &s;laves to one of the mo&s;t de&s;erted parts of his dominions. Thus confiding in the glittering but barbarous multitude he com|manded, he di&s;po&s;ed of the enemy as already vanqui&s;hed; but confidence goes but a &s;hort part of the road to &s;ucce&s;s. The great num|bers he had gathered only brought unwieldy &s;plendor into the field, and, in&s;tead of procur|ing him &s;ecurity, encrea&s;ed his embarra&s;&s;ments.</P>
<P>Alexander, in the mean time, marched on at the head of his heavy-armed infantry, drawn up in two lines, with the cavalry in the wings, and the baggage following in the rear. Being arrived on the banks of the Grannicus, he there found the Per&s;ian hor&s;e, which were very numerous, on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, forming a large front, in order to oppo&s;e Alexa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">der, whenever he &s;hould attempt to pa&s;s. The two
<PB N="100" REF="026819_0103_101372E3CCCBD160">armies continued a long time in &s;ight of each other, on the banks of the river, as if dread|ing the event. The Per&s;ians waited till the Macedonians &s;hould enter the river, in order to charge them to advantage upon their landing; and the latter &s;eemed to be making choice of a place proper for landing.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, Alexander ordered his hor&s;e to be brought, commanded the noblemen of the court to follow him and behave gallantly. He him&s;elf commanded the right wing, and Par|menio the left. The king fir&s;t cau&s;ed a &s;trong detachment to march into the river, him&s;elf following it with the re&s;t of the forces. He made Parmenio advance afterwards with the left wing, the trumpet &s;ounding, and the whole army rai&s;ing cries of joy. The Per&s;ians, &s;eeing this detachment advance forward, began to let fly their arrows&punc; and march to a place where the declivity was not &s;o great, in order to keep the Macedonians from landing. but now the hor&s;e engaged with great fury, one part endea|vouring to land, and the other &s;triving to pre|vent them. The Macedonians, who&s;e cavalry were inferior in number, be&s;ides the di&s;advan|tage of the ground, were wounded with the darts that were &s;hot from the eminence; not to mention, that the flower of the Per&s;ian hor&s;e were drawn together in this place. The Ma|cedonians, therefore, at fir&s;t gave ground, after having lo&s;t the fir&s;t ranks, which made a vigor|ous defence. Alexander, who clo&s;ely followed them, reinforced them with his be&s;t troops, headed them him&s;elf, animated them by his

<P>Spithrobates, lieutenant-governor of Ionia, and &s;on-in-law to Darius di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf above the re&s;t of the Per&s;ian generals by his &s;u|perior bravery. Being &s;urrounded by forty Per&s;ian lords, all of them his relations, of ex|perienced valor, and who never moved from his &s;ide, he carried terror wherever he went. Alexander ob&s;erving in how gallant a manner he &s;ignalized him&s;elf, clapt &s;purs to his hor&s;e, and advanced towards him. They immediately engaged, and each having thrown a javelin, wounded the other &s;lightly. Spithrobates fell furiou&s;ly &s;word in hand upon Alexander, who, being prepared for him, thru&s;ts his pike into his face, and laid him dead at his feet. At that very moment Rafaces, brother to that nobleman, charging him on the &s;ide, gave him &s;o furious a blow on the head with a battle axe, that he beat off his plume, but went no deeper than the hair. As he was going to repeat his blow on the head, which now appeared through his frac|tured helmet. Chrus cut off Rafaces' hand with one &s;troke of his &s;cimitar, and thereby &s;aved his &s;overeign's life. The danger to which Alex|ander had been expo&s;ed, greatly animated the courage of his &s;oldiers, who now performed wonders.

The battle was &s;o hot round him, that mo&s;t of the Macedonians, who lo&s;t their lives on this occa&s;ion, fell here; for they fought again&s;t a body of men, who were well di&s;ciplined, had been inured to war, and fought in de&s;pair. They were all cut to pieces, except two thou&s;and, who were taken pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>In this battle twenty thou&s;and foot, and two thou&s;and five hundred hor&s;e, were killed on the &s;ide of the barbarians; and of the Macedoni|ans, twenty-five of the royal hor&s;e were killed on the fir&s;t attack. Alexander ordered Ly&s;ip|pus to make their &s;tatues in bra&s;s, all of which were &s;et up in a city of Macedon, called Dia,

About three-&s;tore of the other hor&s;e were killed, and near thirty foot, who, the next day, were all laid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">th their arms and equipage in one grave; and the king granted an exemption to their fathers and children from every kind of tribute and &s;er|vice. This victory not only impre&s;&s;ed the Per|&s;ians with con&s;tar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ion, but &s;erved to excite, the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">door of the invading army.</P>

Four days after, he arrived at Ephe&s;us, carrying with him tho&s;e who had been bani&s;hed from thence for being his adherents, and re&s;tored its popular form of government.</P>
<P>Alexander afterwards took Miletus, and de|moli&s;hed Halicana&s;&s;us to the very foundation. He next re&s;tored Ada, queen of Caria, to her kingdom, of which &s;he had been di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome time before; and as a te&s;timony of the deep &s;en&s;e &s;he had of the favours received from Alexander, &s;he &s;ent him every day meats dre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite manner, and the mo&s;t ex|cellent cooks of every kind. Alexander an|&s;wered the queen upon this occa&s;ion, that all this train was of no &s;ervice to him; for that he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much better cooks, whom Le|onidas his governor had given him: one of whom prepared him a good dinner, and the other an excellent &s;upper: the&s;e were Tempe|rance and Exerci&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="026819_0107_101372F551FC0CB8">
He &s;oon afterwards marched into Phrygia, the ancient dominion of the celebrated king Midas. Having taken the capital city, he was de&s;irous of &s;eeing the famous cheriot, to which the gordian knot was tied. This knot, which fa&s;tened the yoke to the beam, was tied with &s;o much intricacy, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover where the ends begun, or how they were con|cealed. According to an ancient tradition of the country, an oracle had foretold, that the man who could untie it &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the empire of A&s;ia. Alexander being firmly per&s;uaded that the oracle was meant for him, after many fruitle&s;s trials, in&s;tead of attempting to untie it in the u&s;ual manner, drew his &s;word, and cut it into pieces, crying out, &s;uch was the only way to untie it. The prie&s;t hailed the omen, and declared that Alexander fulfilled the oracle.</P>
<P>Darius having been employed, for a long time, in collecting a numerous army to oppo&s;e Alexander, advanced towards the river Eu|phrates. Over his tent was exhibited, to the view of his whole army, the image of the &s;un in jewels, while wealth and magnificence &s;hone in every quarter of the army. Fir&s;t they carried &s;ilver altars, on which lay fire, called by them Sacred and Eternal; and the&s;e were followed by the Magi, &s;inging hymns, after the manner of their country. They were accompanied by three hundred and &s;ixty-five youths, equalling the number of days in a year, clothed in purple ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s. Afterwards came a chariot con&s;ecrated to Jupiter, drawn by white hor&s;es, and followed
<PB N="105" REF="026819_0108_101372F97B2F5E00">by a cour&s;er of prodigious &s;ize, to whom they gave the name of the Sun's Hor&s;e; and the equerries were dre&s;&s;ed in white, each having a golden rod in his hand.</P>
<P>Ten chariots, adorned with &s;culptures of gold and &s;ilver, followed afterwards. Then marched a body of hor&s;e, compo&s;ed of twelve nations, who&s;e manners and cu&s;toms were various, and all armed in a different manner. Next advanc|ed tho&s;e, whom the Per&s;ians called <HI>The Immortals,</HI> amounting to ten thou&s;and, who &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of the barbarians in the &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s of their apparel. They all wore golden collars, were cloathed in robes of gold ti&s;&s;ue, with ve&s;t|ments having &s;leeves to them, quite covered with precious &s;tones. Thirty paces from them, followed tho&s;e called the king's relations, to the number of fifteen thou&s;and, in habits very much re&s;embling tho&s;e of women, and more remarkable for the vain pomp of their dre&s;s, than the glitter of their arms. Tho&s;e called the Dourphori came afterwards: they carried the king's cloak, and walked before the chariot, in which he &s;eemed to &s;it as on a high throne. This chariot was enriched on both &s;ides with images of the gods, in gold and &s;ilver; and from the middle of the yoke, which was covered with jewels, ro&s;e two &s;tatues, a cubit in height, the one repre&s;enting war, the other peace, hav|ing a golden eagle between them, with wings extended, as ready to take flight.

Afterwards came fifteen large chariots, in which were the king's children, and tho&s;e who had the care of their education, with a band of eunuchs. Then marched the concubines, to the number of three hundred and &s;ixty, in the equipage of queens, followed by &s;ix hundred mules, and three hundred ca|mels, which carried the king's trea&s;ure, and guarded by a great body of archers. After the&s;e came the wives of the crown-officers, and of the greate&s;t lords of the court; then the &s;ut|lers and &s;ervants of the army, feated al&s;o in chariots.

Such was the &s;plendour of this pageant mo|narch: he took the field encumbered with an unnece&s;&s;ary train of concubines, attended with troops of various nations, &s;peaking different languages; from their numbers impo&s;&s;ible to be mar&s;halled, and &s;o rich and effeminate in gold and in garments, as &s;eemed rather to invite than deter an enemy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<P>ALEXANDER, as frequently happens to the greate&s;t captains, felt &s;ome emotions, when he &s;aw that he was going to hazard all at once. The more fortune had favoured him hitherto, the more he now dreaded her frowns: the mo|ment was approaching, which was to determine his fate. On the other &s;ide, his courage revived from the reflection, that the reward of his toils exceeded the dangers of them; and, though he was uncertain with regard to the victory, he at lea&s;t hoped to die gloriou&s;ly, and like Alexander. However, he did not divulge the&s;e thoughts to any one, well knowing that, upon the approach of a battle, a general ought not to di&s;cover the lea&s;t, marks of &s;adne&s;s or perplexity, and that the troops &s;hould read nothing but re&s;olution and intrepidity in the countenance of their command|er.</P>
<P>Having made his &s;oldiers refre&s;h them&s;elves, and ordered them to be ready by three o'clock in the morning, he went to the top of a moun|tain,
<PB N="108" REF="026819_0111_1013730210474C20">and there, by torch light, &s;acrificed, after the mander of his country, to the gods of the place. As &s;oon as the &s;ignal was given, his ar|my, which was ready to march and fight, ar|rived by day-break at the &s;everal po&s;ts a&s;&s;igned them. But the &s;pies now bringing word, that Darius was not above thirty furlongs from them the king cau&s;ed his army to halt, and then drew it up in battle array. The pea&s;ants, in the greate&s;t terror, came al&s;o, and acquainted Darius with the arrival of the enemy, which he would not at fir&s;t believe, imagining that Alex|ander fled before him, and was endeavoring to e&s;cape. This news threw his troops into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, who, in their &s;urpri&s;e, ran to their arms with great precipitation and di&s;order.</P>
<P>The &s;pot where the battle was fought, lay near the city of I&s;&s;us, which the mountains bounded on one &s;ide, and the &s;ea on the other. The plain that was &s;ituated between them both mu&s;t have been con&s;iderably broad, as the two armies en|camped in it. The river Pinarius ran through the middle of this plain, from the mountain to the &s;ea, and divided it very nearly into two equal parts. The mountain formed a hollow kind of gulf, the extremity of which, in a curved line, bounded part of the plain.</P>
<P>Alexander had at fir&s;t advanced very &s;lowly, to prevent the ranks on the front of the phalanx from breaking, and haired by intervals, but when he was got within bow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ot; he com|manded all his right wing to plunge impet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ou&s;ly into the river, purpo&s;ely that he might &s;urpri&s;e the barbarlans, come &s;ooner to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="109" REF="026819_0112_101373044203B388">engagement, and be le&s;s expo&s;ed to the enemy's arrows; in all which he was very &s;ucce&s;sful. Both &s;ides fought with the utmo&s;t bravery and re&s;olution; and, being now forced to fight clo&s;e, they charged both &s;ides &s;word in hand, when a dreadful &s;laughter en&s;ued each enga|ging man to man. Alexander wi&s;hed nothing &s;o ardently as to kill with his own hand Darius, who, being &s;eated on a high chariot, was con&s;picuous to the whole army. Oxathres, brother to Darius, ob&s;erving that Alexander was going to charge that monarch with the ut|mo&s;t vigour, ru&s;hed before his chariot with the hor&s;e under his command, and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf above the re&s;t. The hor&s;es that drew Darius's chariot lo&s;t all command, and &s;hook the yoke &s;o violently, that they were upon the point of overturning the king, who, &s;eeing him&s;elf going to fall alive into the hands of his enemies, leaped down and mounted another chariot. The re&s;t, ob&s;erving this, fled as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, and throwing down their arms, made the be&s;t of their way. Darius, the in|&s;tant he &s;aw his left wing broken, was one of the fir&s;t who fled in his chariot; but getting afterwards into craggy rugged places, he mounted on hor&s;eback, throwing down his bow, &s;hield, and royal mantle. Alexander, however did not attempt to pur&s;ue him, till he &s;aw his phalanx had conquered the Greeks who ob|&s;tinately oppo&s;ed them, and that the Per&s;ian hor&s;e were put to flight; which proved of great advantage to the prince that fled. In this bat|tle, &s;ixty thou&s;and of the Per&s;ian infantry, and
<PB N="110" REF="026819_0113_1013730B6F4516E8">ten thou&s;and hor&s;emen, were &s;lain; while of Alexander's army, there &s;ell but two hundred and eighty in all.</P>
<P>Sy&s;igambis, Darius's mother, and that mo|narch's queen, were found remaining in the camp, with two of the king's daughters, his &s;on, yet a child, and &s;ome Per&s;ian ladies; for the re&s;t had been carried to Dama&s;cus, with part of Darius's trea&s;ure, and all &s;uch things as contributed only to the luxury and magnificence of his court. No more than three thou&s;and talents were found in his camp; but the re&s;t of the trea&s;ure &s;ell afterwards into the hands of Par|menio, at the taking of the city of Dama&s;cus.</P>
<P>The next day, Alexander vi&s;ited his royal pri&s;oners; and his noble and generous beha|viour on this occa&s;ion, Plutarch occa&s;ion to &s;ay, that "the prince&s;&s;es of Per&s;ia lived in an enemy's camp, as if they had been in &s;ome &s;acred temple, un&s;een, unapproached, and un|mole&s;ted." Sy&s;igambis was di&s;tingui&s;hed by extraordinary marks of Alexander's favours: Darius him&s;elf could not have treated her with more re&s;pect than did that generous prince. He allowed her to regulate the funerals of all the Per&s;ians of the royal family, who had fallen in battle; and, through her interce&s;&s;ion, he par|doned &s;everal of Darius' nobles, who had ju&s;tly incurred his di&s;plea&s;ure. This magnanimous conduct has done more honour to Alexander's character, than all his &s;plendid conque&s;ts. The gentlene&s;s of his manners to his &s;uppliant cap|tives, his cha&s;tity and continence, when he had the power to enforce obedience, were &s;etting an
<PB N="111" REF="026819_0114_1013730EE319DAE8">example to heroes, which it has been the pride of many &s;ince to imitate.</P>
<P>After this conque&s;t, all Phoenicia, the capital city Tyre, only excepted, was yielded to the conqueror. Good fortune followed him to fa&s;t, that it rewarded him beyond his expectations. Antigonus, his general in A&s;ia, overthrew the Capadocians, Paphlagonians, and others lately revolted. Ari&s;todemus, the Per&s;ian admiral was overcome at &s;ea, and a great part of his fleet taken. The city of Dama&s;cus, al&s;o, in which the trea&s;ures of Darius were depo&s;ited, was given up to Alexander.</P>
<P>Alexander next went to Sidonia, who&s;e king, Strabo, he dethroned for his attachment to Da|rius, and permitted Hephae&s;tion to elect in his &s;tead, whom&s;oever of the Sidonians he &s;hould judge worthy of &s;o exalted a character. This favourite was quartered at the hou&s;e of two bro|thers, who were young, and of the mo&s;t con&s;i|derable family in the city. To the&s;e he offered the crown; but they refu&s;ed it, telling him, that, according to the laws of their country, no per&s;on could a&s;cend the throne unle&s;s he were of the royal blood.

<P>The Macedonians had already &s;ubdued Syria and Phoenicia, the city of Tyre excepted. This city was ju&s;tly entitled the Queen of the &s;ea, that element bringing to it the tribute of all nations. She boa&s;ted of having fir&s;t invented navigation, and taught mankind the art of braving the winds and waves by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a frail bark. The happy &s;ituation of Tyre, the conveniency and extent of its ports, the character of its inhabi|tants, who were indu&s;trious, laborious, patient, and extremely courteous to &s;trangers, invited thither merchants from all parts of the globe: &s;o that it might be con&s;idered, not &s;o much a city belonging to any particular nation, as the common city of all nations, and the centre of their commerce.</P>
<P>Alexander thought it nece&s;&s;ary, both for his pride and his intere&s;t, to take the city, though it was generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be impregnable from its fortifications, and inacce&s;&s;ible from its &s;ituation.

<P>WHILST Alexander was carrying on the &s;iege of Tyre, he received a &s;econd let|ter from Darius, in which that monarch &s;eemed more &s;en&s;ible of his power than before: he now gave him the title of king, and offered him ten thou&s;and talents, as a ran&s;om for his captive m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">er, and wife: he offered him his daughter Stati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a in marriage, with all the country he had conquered, as far as the river Euphrates: he hinted to him the incon&s;tancy of fortune, and de&s;cribed at large the powers he was &s;till po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of to oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e terms were &s;o con&s;iderable, that, when the king debated upon them in council, Parme|nio, one of his generals, could not help ob&s;erv|ing, that if he were Alexander, he would agree to &s;uch a propo&s;al. To which Alexander nobly replied, "And &s;o would I were I Parmenio." He therefore treated the propo&s;al of Darius with haughty contempt, and refu&s;ed to accept of trea&s;ures which he already conceived as his own.</P>
<P>From Tyre, Alexander marched to Jeru&s;alem where the Jews opened their gates to receive him. From this city, he went on to Gaza, where he found a more ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance than
<PB N="115" REF="026819_0119_1013732126478B98">he had expected; but at length, taking the town by &s;torm, and having cut the garri&s;on con&s;i&s;t|ing of ten thou&s;and men, to pieces, with brutal ferocity, he ordered B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etis, the governor, to be brought before him; and having in vain endea|voured to intimidate, him commanded, at la&s;t, that holes &s;hould be bored through his heels, and thus to be tied by cords to the back of his chariot, and in this manner to be dragged round the walls of the city. This he did in limitation of Achilles, whom Homer de&s;cribe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as having dragged Hector round the walls of Troy in the &s;ame manner: but it was read|ing that poet to very little advantage, to imitate this hero in the mo&s;t unworthy part of his cha|racter.</P>
<P>He then marched into Egypt, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the whole of it, without meeting with the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition. He afterwards vi&s;ited the temple of Jupiter, and cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be acknowledged by the prie&s;ts as the &s;on of that god. Having &s;ettled his affairs in Egypt, he &s;et out to march again&s;t Darius, who was now preparing to oppo&s;e him.</P>
<P>On his march, Statira, the wife of Darius, died in child-bed, and was honoured with a funeral ceremony due to her exalted character and &s;tation. The news of that melancholy event was carried to Darius by Tricus, one of Statira's eunuchs, who had affected his e&s;cape from the Macedonian camp. The news of Statira's death overwelmed the mind of Darius with the deepe&s;t &s;orrow: but when he was told of the generous manner, in which the royal
<PB N="116" REF="026819_0120_10137324EDE52158">captives had been treated, he broke out into this exclamation: "Ye gods, the guardians of our births, and who decree the fate of nations, grant that I may be enabled to leave the Per&s;ian &s;tate rich and flouri&s;hing as I found it; that I may have it in my power to make Alexander a proper return for his genero&s;ity to the deare&s;t pledges of my affection! But, if the duration of this empire is near at an end, and the greatne&s;s of Per&s;ia about to be forgotten, may none but Alexander be permitted to &s;it on the throne of Cyrus? Such &s;entiments in a de&s;potic prince mu&s;t give a very favourable idea of the liberality of his mind.</P>
<P>The armies of Alexander and Darius were now ha&s;tily approaching each other, and at length met on a plain near the city of Arbela. The army of Darius, con&s;i&s;ted, at lea&s;t, of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and foot, and forty thou&s;and hor&s;e: and the other of no more than forty thou&s;and foot, and about eight thou&s;and hor&s;e. The two armies engaged, and the battle was ob&s;tinate and bloody; but the Per&s;ians were at length routed, and Darius and his army put to &s;light. Alexander then marched for Babylon, and entered that city in triumph, being received by its inhabitants in the mo&s;t magnificent man|ner. He next took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Perepolis, at the head of his victorious &s;oldiers; who, though the inhabitants made no re&s;i&s;tance, began to cut in pieces all tho&s;e who &s;till remained in the city. However, the king &s;oon put an end to the ma&s;&s;acre, and forbad his &s;oldiers to commit any further violence.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="026819_0121_101373298696D038">
While Alexander was thus triumphing in all the exultation of &s;ucce&s;s, the wretched Darius was by this time arrived at Ecbatana, the ca|pital of Media. There remained &s;till with this fugitive prince thirty thou&s;and foot; among whom were four thou&s;and Greeks, who were faithful to him to the la&s;t. Be&s;ides the&s;e he had four thou&s;and &s;lingers, and upwards of three thou&s;and Bactrian hor&s;e, whom Be&s;&s;us, their governor, commanded. Darius, even with &s;o &s;mall a force, &s;till conceived hopes of oppo&s;ing his rival, or at lea&s;t of protracting the war; but he was &s;urrounded with traitors, his want of &s;ucce&s;s having turned all mankind again&s;t him. Nabarzanes, one of the greate&s;t lords of Per&s;ia, and general of the hor&s;e, had con&s;pired with Be&s;&s;irs, general of the Bactrians, to commit the blacke&s;t of all crimes: to &s;eize upon the per&s;on of the king, and lay him in chains, which they might ea&s;ily do, as each of them had a great number of &s;oldiers under his command. Their de&s;ign was, if Alexan|der &s;hould pur&s;ue them, to &s;ecure them&s;elves by giving up Darius alive into his hands; and, in ca&s;e they e&s;caped, to murder that prince, and afterwards u&s;urp his crown, and begin a new war. The&s;e traitors &s;oon won over the troops, by repre&s;enting to them, that they were going to their de&s;truction; that they would &s;oon be cru&s;hed under the ruin of an empire, which was ju&s;t ready to fall; at the &s;ame time that Bactriana was open to them, and offered them immen&s;e ri&s;hes. The&s;e pro|mi&s;es &s;oon prevailed upon the perfidious army,
<PB N="118" REF="026819_0122_1013732CCD6BDA20">the Greek mercenaries excepted, who rejected all their propo&s;als with di&s;dain. Darius, thus betrayed by his generals, and pur&s;ued by his enemies, the Greeks &s;olicited the honour of protecting his per&s;on, a&s;&s;uring him they would &s;o do, at the expence of the la&s;t drop of their blood. But his noble &s;pirit would not &s;uffer him to accept the offer: "If my own &s;ub|jects (&s;aid he) will not give me protection, how can I &s;ubmit to receive it from the hands of &s;trangers?" His faithful Grecian &s;oldiers, finding it beyond their power to grant him any relief, threw them&s;elves upon the mercy of Alexander; who, in con&s;ideration of their noble &s;pirit, forgave them, and employed them in his own &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The traitors &s;eized and bound their monarch in chains of gold, under the appearance of ho|nour, as he was a king; then enclo&s;ing him in a covered chariot, they &s;et out towards Bac|triana. In this manner they carried him with the utmo&s;t di&s;patch&punc; until being informed, that the Grecian army was &s;till clo&s;ely pur|&s;uing them, they found it impo&s;&s;ible either to conciliate the friend&s;hip of Alexander, or to &s;ecure a throne for them&s;elves. They, there|fore once more gave Darius his liberty, and de&s;ired him to make the be&s;t of his e&s;cape with them from the conqueror; but he replied that the gods were ready to revenge the evils he had already &s;uffered; and, appealing to Alex|ander for ju&s;tice, refu&s;ed to follow a band of traitors. At the&s;e words they fell into the ut|mo&s;t fury, wounding him with their darts and
<PB N="119" REF="026819_0123_1013732FACB04AD8">their &s;pears, and left him to linger in this man|ner, unattended, the remainder of his wre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed life. The traitors then made their e&s;cape d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f|ferent ways; while the victorious Macedo|nians at length coming up, found Darius in &s;olitude, lying in his chariot, and drawing near his end. However, he had &s;trength enough, before he died, to call for drink, which a Macedonian, Poly&s;tratus by name, brought him. On this melancholy occa&s;ion, the genero&s;ity of the unfortunate monarch &s;hone forth, in the addre&s;s he made to this &s;tranger: "Now, indeed, (&s;aid he) I &s;uffer the extremity of mi&s;ery, &s;ince it is not in my power to reward thee for this act of huma|nity." He had a Per&s;ian pri&s;oner, whom he employed as his interpreter. Darius, after drinking the liquor that had been given him. turned to the Macedonian, and told him, that in the deplorable &s;tate to which he was re|duced, he however &s;hould have the comfort to &s;peak to one who could under&s;tand him, and that his la&s;t words would not be lo&s;t. He therefore charged hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to tell Alexander, that he had died in his debt, that he gave him many thanks, for the great humanity he had exerci&s;ed towards his mother, his wife, and his children, who&s;e lives he had not only &s;pared, but re&s;tored to their former &s;plendour; that he be &s;ought the gods to give victory to his arms, and make him monarch of the univer&s;e; that he thought he need not entreat him to revenge the execrable murder committed on his per|&s;on, as that was the common cau&s;e of kings.
<PB N="120" REF="026819_0124_10137331710B0208">After this, taking Poly&s;tratus by the hand, "Give him (&s;aid he) thy hand, as I give thee mine: and carry him, in my name, the only pledge I am able to give of my gratitude and affection." Having &s;aid the&s;e words, he breathed his la&s;t.</P>
<P>Alexander coming up a moment after, and &s;eeing Darius's body, he wept bitterly; and, by the &s;tronge&s;t te&s;timonies of affection that could be given, proved how intimately he was affected with the unhappine&s;s of a prince who de&s;erved better. He immediately pulled off his military cloak, and threw it on Da|rius's body; then cau&s;ing it to be embalmed, and his coffin to be adorned with royal magni|ficence, he &s;ent it to Sy&s;igambis. to be in|terred with the honours u&s;ually paid to the decea&s;ed Per&s;ian monarchs, and entombed with his ance&s;tors. Thus died Darius, in the fif|tieth year of his age, &s;ix of which he reigned with felicity.

<P>The traitor Be&s;&s;us did not e&s;cape the fate due to his crimes. Alexander pur&s;ued him, to avenge on the murderer the death of his royal ma&s;ter.

<P>THE death of Darius only &s;erved to en|flame the &s;pirit of ambition in Alexan|der to pur&s;ue further conque&s;ts. He cro&s;&s;ed Parthia, and arrived in the province of Hyrca|nia, which &s;ubmitted to his arms. He after|wards &s;ubdued the Mandii, the Arii, the Dran|gae, the Hracho&s;ii, and &s;everal other nations, into which his army marched with greater &s;peed than people generally travel. He frequently would pur&s;ue an enemy for whole days and nights together, almo&s;t without &s;uffering his troops to take any re&s;t. By this prodigious rapidity, he came unawares upon nations, who thought him at a great di&s;tance, and &s;ubdued them before they had time to put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of defence.</P>
<P>Alexander, now enjoying a little repo&s;e, ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndoned him&s;elf to &s;en&s;uality; and he, whom the arms of the Per&s;ians could not conquer, fell a victim to their vices. Nothing was now to be &s;een but games, parties of plea&s;ure, wo|men and exce&s;&s;ive fa&s;ting, in which he u&s;ed to revel whole days and nights. Not &s;atisfied with the buffoons, and the performers on in|&s;trumental mu&s;ic, whom he had brought with him out of Greece, he obliged the captive wo|men, whom he carried along with him, to &s;ing &s;ongs after the manner of their country. He happened, among tho&s;e women, to perceive
<PB N="122" REF="026819_0126_1013734294C6D518">one who appeared in deeper affliction than the re&s;t, and who by a mode&s;t, and at the &s;ame time a noble confu&s;ion, di&s;covered a greater reluctance than the others to appear in public. She was a perfect beauty, which was very much heightened by her ba&s;hfulne&s;s, whil&s;t &s;he threw her eyes to the ground, and did all in her power to conceal her face. The king &s;oon imagined, by her air and mien, that &s;he was not of vulgar birth; and enquiring him&s;elf in|to it, the lady an&s;wered, that &s;he was grand|daughter to Ochus, who not long before had &s;wayed the Per&s;ian &s;cepter, and daughter of his &s;on; that &s;he had married Hy&s;ta&s;pes, who was related to Darius, and general of a great army. Alexander, being touched with com|pa&s;&s;ion, when he heard the unhappy fate of a prince&s;s of the blood royal, and the &s;ad condi|tion to which &s;he was reduced, not only gave her liberty, but returned all her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and cau&s;ed her hu&s;band to be &s;ought for, in order that &s;he might be re&s;tored to him. This &s;ingle act of genero&s;ity &s;hould draw a veil over many of his faults.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have &s;een Alexander triumphing by a cour&s;e of virtue, we are now to behold him &s;wollen up by &s;ucce&s;s, &s;poiled by flattery, and enervated by vices, exhibiting a very doubt|ful character, and mixing the tyrant with the hero. Upon a charge of a real or imaginary plot again&s;t him, he fir&s;t put Philotas to death, and afterwards the father, Parmenio, who was at the time of his death &s;eventy years of age,
<PB N="123" REF="026819_0127_101373450901B9A0">and had &s;erved his ma&s;ter with fidelity and zeal, which in the end was thus rewarded. Alexan|der, thus uniting in his per&s;on at once great cruelty and great enterprize, &s;till marched for|ward in &s;earch of new nations, whom he might &s;ubdue.</P>
<P>Having &s;ubdued the Ma&s;&s;age<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ae, the Dahae, and other nations, he entered the province of Bar&s;aria, from thence he advanced to Mara|cander, and appointed Clitus governor of that province. This was an old officer, who had fought under Philip, and &s;ignalized him&s;elf on many occa&s;ions. At the battle of the Gran|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous, as Alexander was fighting bareheaded, and Ra&s;aces had his arm rai&s;ed, in order to &s;trike him behind, Clitus covered the king with his &s;hield, and cut off the barbarian's hard.&mdash; This favour, however, only advanced Clitus to a po&s;t of greater danger. One evening, as an entertainment, the king, after drinking im|moderately, began to celebrate his own exploits, in a manner which &s;hocked all his old generals. Clitus, who was al&s;o intoxicated, contradicted Alexander in all his a&s;&s;ertions, and &s;ung, with an air of in&s;olence, ver&s;es reflecting highly on the price, who &s;eeing the general near him, he &s;truck him dead with a javelin. The king had no &s;ooner murdered his faithful &s;ervant, than he perceived the atrociou&s;ne&s;s of the act; he threw him&s;elf upon the dead body, forced out the javelin, and would have de&s;troyed him&s;elf, had he not been prevented by his guards, who &s;eized and carried him forcibly to his own a|partment,
<PB N="124" REF="026819_0128_10137347282E1260">where the flattery and per&s;ua&s;ions of his friends at length &s;erved to alleviate his remor&s;e. Alexander, in order to divert his melancholy, a&s;&s;embled his army, and marched in pur&s;uit of new conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>He advanced into India, which having never been a warlike nation, he &s;ubdued it with the rapididity rather of a traveller than a conqueror. Numberle&s;s petty &s;tates &s;ubmitted to him, &s;en|&s;ible that his &s;tay would be &s;hort, and his con|que&s;ts evane&s;cent. Sailing down the river In|dus, and conquering every thing in his way, he at la&s;t come to the country of the Oxydraci and the Mallis, the mo&s;t valiant people in the Ea&s;t. However, Alexander defeated them in &s;everal engagements, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them of their &s;trong holds, and at la&s;t marched again&s;t their capital city, where the greate&s;t part of their forces were retired. It was upon this occa&s;ion, that &s;eizing a &s;caling ladder, him&s;elf fir&s;t mounted the wall, followed only by two of his officers. His attendants believing him to be in danger, mounted &s;wiftly to &s;uccour him; but the lad|der breaking, he was left alone. It was now that his ra&s;hne&s;s became his &s;afety; for leaping from the wall into the city, which was crowded with enemies, &s;word in hand, he repul&s;ed &s;uch as were neare&s;t, and even killed the gene|ral, who advanced in the throng. Thus with his back to a tree that happened to be near, he received all the darts of the enemy in a &s;hield, and kept even the bolde&s;t at a di&s;tance. At la&s;t, an Indian di&s;charging an arrow of three feet
<PB N="125" REF="026819_0129_1013734973485390">long, it pierced his coat of mail and his right brea&s;t, and &s;o great a quantity of blood i&s;&s;ued from the wound, that he dropped his arms, and lay as dead. The Indian came to &s;trip him, &s;uppo&s;ing him really what he appeared: but Alexander that in&s;tant recalled his &s;pirits, and plunged a dagger in his &s;ide. By this time, a part of the king's attendants came to his &s;uccour, and forming them&s;elves round his body, till his &s;oldiers without found means of bur&s;ting the gates, &s;aved him, and put all the inhabitants, without di&s;tinction, to the &s;word.</P>
<P>The wound which at fir&s;t &s;eemed dangerous, having, in the &s;pace of &s;ix or &s;even days, a&s;|&s;umed a more favourable appearance, Alexan|der mounted his hor&s;e, and &s;hewed him&s;elf to the army, who &s;eemed to view him with in|&s;atiable plea&s;ure. Then continuing his voyage, and &s;ubduing the country on each &s;ide, as he pa&s;&s;ed along, the pilots perceived from the &s;well of the river, that the &s;ea could not be far di&s;tant; and they informed the king, that they already felt the breezes of the ocean. No|thing &s;o much a&s;toni&s;hed the Macedonian &s;oldiers as the ebbing and flowing of the tide. Ac|cu&s;tomed to the gentle floods of the Mediter|ranean, they were amazed when they &s;aw the Indus ri&s;e to a great heighth, and overflrow the country, which they con&s;idered as a mark of divine re&s;entment. They were no le&s;s terrified &s;ome hours afterwards, when they &s;aw the river for&s;ake its banks, and leave tho&s;e lands unco|vered, which it had &s;o lately overflowed. Thus,

<P>His army &s;u&s;tained incredible hard&s;hips on their return: pa&s;&s;ing through a country de&s;titute of all &s;orts of provi&s;ions, they were obliged to fea&s;t on the bea&s;ts of burden, and were forced to burn tho&s;e rich &s;poils, for the &s;ake of which they had encountered &s;o many dangers. Tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es al&s;o, that generally accompany famine, compleated their calamity, and de|&s;troyed them in great numbers: but the king's fortitude appeared to great advantage on this occa&s;ion. The army being in ab&s;olute want of water, &s;ome &s;oldiers were &s;ent to endeavor to find out a &s;pring. They fortunetely fell upon one; but it yielded them but a very &s;mall quantity of water. With what they had got|ten, the &s;oldiers returned rejoicing to the king, who, in&s;tead of drinking it, poured it upon the ground, unwilling that his &s;oldiers &s;hould &s;u&s;tain a calamity, in which he refu&s;ed to bear a part. This generous act in&s;pired the &s;oldiery with fre&s;h &s;pirits.</P>
<P>After a march of &s;ixty days, they arrived in the province of Gedro&s;is, the fertility of which
<PB N="127" REF="026819_0131_10137355B77B04A8">&s;oon bani&s;hed from the minds of the &s;oldiery all their former difficulties. Alexander pa&s;&s;ed through the country, not in the military pomp of a conqueror, but in the licentious di&s;gui&s;e of an enthu&s;ia&s;t: &s;till willing to imitate Bacchus, he was drawn by eight hor&s;es, on a &s;caffold in the form of a &s;quare &s;tage, where he &s;pent the days and nights in fea&s;ting. Along the roads where he pa&s;&s;ed, were placed ca&s;ks of wine in great abundance, and the&s;e the &s;ol|diers drained in honour of their mock deity. The whole country echoed with the &s;ound of in&s;truments, and the howling of bacchanals, who, with their hair di&s;hevelled, and frantic mirth, ran up and down, abandoning them|&s;elves to every kind of lewdne&s;s. This vice produced one of a much more formidable na|ture in the king's mind; for it always inflam|ed his pa&s;&s;ions to cruelty, and the executioner generally crowned the fea&s;t.</P>
<P>After various combats, conque&s;ts, cruelties, follies, and exce&s;&s;es, Alexander arrived at Babylon. On his approach to the city, many &s;ini&s;ter omens were ob&s;erved; on which account the Chaldeans, who pretended to fore&s;ee future events, attempted to per&s;uade him not to enter that city. The Greek philo&s;ophers, on the other hand, di&s;played the futility of their pre|dictions. Babylon was a theatre for him to di&s;play his glory on; and amba&s;&s;adors from all the nations he had conquered were there in readine&s;s to celebrate his triumphs. After mak|ing a mo&s;t magnificent entry, he gave audience
<PB N="128" REF="026819_0132_1013735816A8FAC8">to the amba&s;&s;adors with a grandeur and dignity &s;uitable to his power, yet with the affability and politene&s;s of a private courtier.</P>
<P>Alexander, finding Babylon, in extent and conveniency Iupperior to all other cities of the Ea&s;t, he re&s;olved to make it the &s;eat of his em|pire; and for that purpo&s;e was de&s;irable of adding to it all the ornaments po&s;&s;ible. Though he was much employed in projects of this kind, and in &s;chemes beyond human power to execute, he &s;pent the greater part of his time in &s;uch plea&s;ures as this magnificent city afforded; but his plea&s;ures often terminated in licentiou&s;ne&s;s and riot. The recollection of the cruel man|ner, in which he had put a period to the lives of &s;ome of his be&s;t friends and favourites fe&s;tered in his mind, and ca&s;t a thick gloom over his &s;pirits; to di&s;&s;ipate which, required the application of &s;ome very powerful remedy. The remedy, to which he had recour&s;e, was <HI>in|temperance.</HI> He was, of cour&s;e frequently in|vited to banquets, at which he drank &s;o immode|rately, as often to have no command left of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>On a particular occa&s;ion, having &s;pent the whole night in a debauch, a &s;econd was pro|po&s;ed: he accepted the invitation, and drank to &s;uch exce&s;s, that he fell upon the floor, to appearance dead, and in this lifele&s;s manner was carried, a &s;ad &s;pectacle of debauchery, to his palace. The fever continued, with &s;ome intervals, in which he gave the nece&s;&s;ary orders for the &s;ailing of the fleet, and the marching
<PB N="129" REF="026819_0133_1013735C05AACE40">of his land forces, being per&s;uaded he &s;houd &s;oon recover. But at la&s;t, finding him&s;elf pa&s;t hopes, and his voice beginning to fail, be gave his ring to Perdiccas, with orders to convey his corps to the temple of Ammon. He &s;truggled, however, with death for &s;ome time, and rai&s;ing him&s;elf upon his elbow, he gave his hand to the &s;oldiers, who pre&s;&s;ed to ki&s;s it. Being then a&s;ked to whom he would leave his empire, he an|&s;wered, "To the mo&s;t worthy." Perdiccas en|enquiring at what time he &s;hould pay him di|vine honours, he replied, "When you are hap|py." With the&s;e words he expired, being thirty-two years and eight months old, of which he had reigned twelve, with more fortune than virtue.</P>
<P>By the death of this illu&s;trious conqueror were fulfilled many of the prophecies of the &s;acred writers. One of them is &s;ingularly &s;trik|ing: "The temple of Belus &s;hall be broken down to the ground, never to rai&s;e from its ruins." That the word of God might &s;tand firm, Alexander is cut off, at the very in&s;tant he is preparing to rebuild that temple, and to rai&s;e Babylon to its wanted &s;plendour. Alex|ander left one &s;on, named Hercules, who was born of Bar&s;ine, the daughter of Artabazus, and widow of Memnon. Both Roxana and Statira are &s;aid to have been left pregnant.</P>
<P>In whatever light we view this monarch, we &s;hall find little to admire, and le&s;s to imitate. That courage, for which he was celebrated, is but a &s;ubordinate virtue; that fortune, which
<PB N="130" REF="026819_0134_1013735D9925DDC0">con&s;tantly attended him, was but an accidental advantage; that di&s;cipline, which prevailed in his army, was produced and cultivated by his father; but his intemperance, his cruelty, his vanity, his pa&s;&s;ion for u&s;ele&s;s conque&s;ts, were all his own. His victories, however, &s;erved to crown the pyramid of Grecian glory; they &s;erved to &s;how, to what a degree the arts of peace can promote tho&s;e of war. In this picture, we view a combination of petty &s;tates, by the arts of refinement, growing more than a match for the re&s;t of the world united, and leav|ing mankind an example of the &s;uperiority of intellect over brutal force.</P>

<P>ALEXANDER having. by his la&s;t words, bequeathed his empire "to the mo&s;t worthy," men who had been accu&s;tomed to rule with ab&s;olute power, in di&s;tant, exten|&s;ive, populous, and wealthy provinces, mu&s;t have been highly plea&s;ed to find, that their &s;overeign's will threw no bar in their way to dominion or power. There was one, how|ever, who appeared to have an extraordinary claim to di&s;tinction: Perdiccas, to whom Alex|ander, in his la&s;t moments, had delivered his royal &s;ignet. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of merit, equal at lea&s;t to that of his competitors, this adventitious circum&s;tance might &s;eem to have given him a
<PB N="131" REF="026819_0135_101373619185B3D8">&s;uperior title to the va&s;t object in que&s;tion; but his rivals were too proud to &s;uffer an equal to be exalted above them, without throwing &s;ome embarra&s;&s;ment in his way; and too fond of power to be&s;tow a title to an em|pire, without advancing their own preten&s;ions. Accordingly they all remon&s;trated, and op|po&s;ed Perdicca's elevation; and, finding that they were not likely to &s;ucceed in their private &s;chemes, by acting intere&s;tedly, they re&s;olved to overturn his, by acting ju&s;tly, in &s;upport|ing the claims of the lawful heirs to the crown. The&s;e were Hercules, the &s;on of Alexander; and Aridaeus, Alexander's own brother. There was little or no conte&s;t about Aridaeus's right to a &s;hare in the &s;overeignty. He had been ac|knowledged to be in&s;ane; and that circum|&s;tance, perhaps more than his con&s;anguinity to the king, procured him an ea&s;y admi&s;&s;ion to the throne. The right of Hercules was not &s;o readily recognized: his mother was not of royal extraction; and as Alexander had al|ways &s;hewn a preference to Roxana and Sta|tira, and had, moreover, omitted to mention Hercules in his la&s;t hours, his title was at once &s;et a&s;ide; but the exclu&s;ive right to the throne was not to be granted to one per&s;on. It was therefore judged proper, by all the leading men, to divide the &s;overeignty between Ari|daeus and the child to be born of Roxana, &s;hould it prove a &s;on. This appointment was ea&s;ily acceded to, as the government that was naturally to be expected from it, would have fall &s;cope for the exerci&s;e of avarice and ambi|tion.
<PB N="132" REF="026819_0136_1013736937251890">This &s;ettlement being made, the va|rious competitors for the Macedonian empire retired to their re&s;pective employments.</P>
<P>Roxana being delivered of a &s;on, whom they named Alexander, Olympias had been re|called to take charge of her infant grand&s;on, and to &s;anction the new admini&s;tration of Ma|cedon by her pre&s;ence. On her arrival at Ma|cedon, &s;he fir&s;t let lo&s;e her &s;avage revenge on Aridaeus, and his queen Eurydice. Aridaeus, the &s;on of Philip by a concubine had from his infancy been &s;ubjected to that aver&s;ion and hatred from Olympias, which the relation&s;hip that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between her and him naturally ex|cited. The infirmity of his under&s;tanding was &s;aid to have been the effect of a potion, which &s;he gave him. Cyna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, the mother of Ari|daeus' queen, had been murdered at the in|&s;tigation of Olympias. Amyntas, her father the &s;on of Philip the Fir&s;t's elder brother, had al&s;o been de&s;troyed through her contrivance: &s;o that neither Aridaeus, nor Eurydice his wife, could be &s;uppo&s;ed to look upon her with com|placence. Indeed, they had every rea&s;on to apprehend bad con&s;equences from her getting into power, and they &s;et them&s;elves to provide for the wor&s;t. Eurydice rai&s;ed an army, and marched to meet Olympias; but on the two armies meeting, the troops of Eurydice went over to the &s;tandard of Olympias, and Ari|daeus and his queen fell into her hands.</P>
<P>Olympias per&s;ecuted the royal couple with all that unrelenting hatred which mark|ed her di&s;po&s;ition: they were confined to a
<PB N="133" REF="026819_0137_1013736ACEF9C938">pri&s;on, which was &s;o &s;mall, that they could &s;carcely turn them&s;elves in it. Their wretched &s;u&s;tenance was thrown in at a little hole, through which pa&s;&s;ed light and air, and all the other limitted comforts they were permitted to enjoy. Percerving that this barbarous treat|ment had no other effect than to excite the compa&s;&s;ion of the people, and fearing that their commi&s;eration would &s;oon be converted into indignation towards her, &s;he re&s;olved to put a period to the mi&s;erable exi&s;tence of her pri&s;oners. She in&s;tructed &s;ome Thracians to enter the pri&s;on, and di&s;patch Aridaeus, which they did without remor&s;e. He had reigned &s;ix years and four months.</P>
<P>This inhuman action being perpetrated, Olympias &s;ent me&s;&s;engers to the queen, fur|ni&s;hed with a poinard, a rope, and a cup of poi&s;on, de&s;iring her to choo&s;e which &s;he plea&s;ed. They found her binding up the wounds of her bleeding &s;pou&s;e, with linen which &s;he had torn from her own body, and paying all that decent and &s;olemn re&s;pect to the lifele&s;s cor&s;e, which became her deplorable &s;ituation. She received the me&s;&s;age that was brought to her with the greate&s;t compo&s;ure; and, after entreating the gods, that Olympias might be rewarded with the like pre&s;ent, &s;he took the rope, and &s;trangled her&s;elf. Thus were that haple&s;s pair cut off. Olympias had now &s;een a period to the life of Aridaeus, whom &s;he had long &s;ince deprived of every rational en|joyment, by robbing him of his under&s;tanding; and &s;he had completed the ruin of Eurydice
<PB N="134" REF="026819_0138_1013736DF4E941F0">and her family, by con&s;igning her to an end &s;i|milar to that, which her violent and vindictive pa&s;&s;ions had formerly procured to her unfor|tunate parents. Nor was her thir&s;t of blood yet quenched: for he cau&s;ed Nicanor, the brother of Ca&s;&s;ander, to be put to death. The body of Io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s, another brother of Ca&s;&s;ander, which had long re&s;ted in the tomb, &s;he had brought forth, and expo&s;ed on the high|way; and an hundred Macedonians of noble birth were &s;eized and executed, on &s;u&s;picion of having been in the intere&s;t of Ca&s;&s;ander. At la&s;t, however, the fortune of war threw her in|to the power of Ca&s;&s;ander, who delivered her into the hands of tho&s;e who&s;e kindred &s;he had murdered, and who thereupon cut her throat.</P>
<P>The furious contentions that now &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among the ambitious &s;urviving captains of Alexander, deluged Greece in blood, and brought on the mo&s;t unnatural murders. Be|&s;ides tho&s;e horrid and unnatural &s;cenes we have already de&s;cribed, Roxana and her &s;op Alex|ander were impri&s;oned, and treated with con|tempt; and Hercules, the &s;on of Alexander by Bartine, the only remaining branch of the royal family, was murdered about two years after. Nor more than twenty eight years had elap&s;ed &s;ince the death of Alexander, and not a &s;ingle branch of his hou&s;e remained to enjoy a portion of that empire, which Philip and his &s;on had acquired at the price of the greate&s;t policy, dangers, and blood&s;hed.

<P>Among the la&s;t kings of Macedon, was Phi|lip, &s;on of Demetrius. He had two &s;ons, Per|&s;eus and Demetrius; the former of which ac|cu&s;ed the latter of a de&s;ign to a&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;inate the king, who retiring into the inner apartment of his palace, with two of his nobles, &s;at in &s;o|lemn judgment on his two &s;ons, being under the agonizing nece&s;&s;ity, whether the charge &s;hould be proved or di&s;approved, of finding one of them guilty. Per&s;eus took care to pro|cure &s;uch evidence again&s;t his brother, as might not fail of convicting him, and Demetrius was accordingly put to death. Philip, when too late, di&s;covered that he had been impo&s;ed upon by a forgery, and died of a broken heart. He was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on Per&s;eus, who, &s;ome time after, was taken pri&s;oner by the Romans, led in triumph through the &s;treets of Rome, and then thrown into a dungeon, where he &s;tarved him&s;elf to death.</P>
<P>The fatal di&s;&s;ention among the Grecian chiefs expo&s;ed them to the inroads of every neighbouring power. The Romans, after the defeat of Per&s;eus, e&s;tabli&s;hed a new form of government in Macedon. The whole king|dom was divided into four di&s;tricts; the inha|bitants of each were to have no connection, intermarriage, or exchange of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, with tho&s;e of the other di&s;tricts; and, among other regulations tendings to reduce them to a &s;tate of the mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bject &s;lavery, they were inhibited from the u&s;e of arms, unle&s;s in &s;uch places as
<PB N="136" REF="026819_0141_1013737942AC2C70">were expo&s;ed to the incur&s;ions of the barba|rians. Triumphal games at Amphipolis, to which all the neighbouring nations, both Eu|ropeans and A&s;iatics, were invited, announced the extended dominion of Rome, and the hu|miliation not only of Macedon, but of all Greece; for the Romans now found nothing in that part of the world that was able to op|po&s;e them.</P>
<P>Greece, now &s;unk in that ma&s;s of nations which compo&s;ed the Roman empire, had lo&s;t every ve&s;tige of national exi&s;tence; and, while &s;he was excluded from all participation in the pro&s;perity of her conquerors, &s;he &s;hared deeply in her misfortunes. The civil wars of Rome drenched Greece with blood; and, when that war was concluded, whoever had not appeared on the &s;ide of the victor, was con&s;idered as his enemy. Greece, in common with the other Roman provinces, had &s;uffered many op|pre&s;&s;ions under the emperors, and from the repeated inva&s;ions of barbarians, when the acce&s;&s;ion of Con&s;tantine the Great to the Im|perial throne, &s;eemed to promi&s;e to the Grecian annals a new aera of glory, and &s;ome comfort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for their pa&s;t misfortunes.</P>
<P>The hopes of Greece, however, were even here di&s;appointed; for Con&s;tantine, by dividing his dominions among his three &s;ons, involved the empire in the flames of civil war; and his &s;on Julian, who at lo&s;t prevailed, overturned every thing his father had done. He was unable to protect the public pro&s;perity, undermined by the de&s;poti&s;m of a military government, and a

The German tribes renewed their inroads into Gaul; Africa rebelled, and a &s;pirit of di&s;content and in&s;ur|rection began to appear among the barbarian tribes on the Danube. In the reign of the Emperor Valens, the Huns, a new tribe of barbarians, in manners and a&s;pect more horrid than any that had yet appeared on the Roman frontiers, plundered and drove from their &s;et|tlements the Gothic tribes on the further &s;ide of the Danube. Gratian, nephew and heir to Va|lens, &s;hared the empire with Theodo&s;ius, whom the calamities of the times rai&s;ed to the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole. The abilities and per|&s;onal valour of this prince be&s;towed on the em|pire an appearance of vigour during his reign; but his &s;ons Arcadius and Honorius, between whom he divided the empire, brought up in the bo&s;om of a luxurious palace, and &s;unk in effeminacy, were unequal to the ta&s;k of govern|ing an empire weakened by divi&s;ion.

It was the genius of Greece that formed tho&s;e very poli|ticians and heroes, who fir&s;t bent her lofty &s;pi|rit under the yoke of foreign dominion. It was in Thebes, under the tuition of Epami|nondas, that her heroes were trained to a love of glory, and of all tho&s;e arts and accompli&s;h|ments of both peace and war, by which it is be&s;t attained. It was a Grecian philo&s;opher who taught Alexander how to manage the pa&s;|&s;ions, and govern the minds of men; while the writings of Homer, by a mo&s;t powerful contagion, in&s;pired his mind with a contempt of danger and death in the pur&s;uit of glory.&mdash; As the light of Greece illuminated her Mace|donian, &s;o it &s;pread over her Roman conque|rors.
