<L>For good king David, once at lei&s;ure,</L>

<L>(Poor thing, &s;he thought of no &s;uch matter,)</L>
<L>His wanton eye beheld &s;uch beauty,</L>
<L>He leap'd the fence of &s;acred duty;</L>
<L>Nor poke, nor &s;hackles could re&s;train</L>
<L>The giddy pa&s;&s;ions of the man,</L>
<L>Who in the ab&s;ence of Uriah,</L>

<L>The cabinet to unlock and rifle,</L>
<L>And with this &s;acred thing to trifle;</L>
<L>Did what he would, without control,</L>

<L>Now, Sir, if fame and truth agree,</L>
<L>For &s;uch there is but one decree,</L>

<L>But I forbear, fame will tell lies,</L>
