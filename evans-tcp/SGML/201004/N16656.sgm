<HEAD>AN ESSAY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THAT our laws do not operate with &s;ufficient force, is a truth too glating to e&s;cape ob&s;ervation. It is &s;een, felt, and lamented by every &s;incere lover of his country. Different cau&s;es, no doubt, co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">operate to produce this effect. To inve&s;tigate all the&s;e, does not fall in with my pre&s;ent de&s;ign, though it might be of &s;ingular &s;ervice to the &s;tate. For as in the human, &s;o in the body politic, the cau&s;e of a di&s;ea&s;e being once di&s;covered, the remedy is more ea&s;ily pre&s;cribed, and the deliterious effect more &s;ucce&s;sfully counteracted. It is more to my purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve, that the general neglect of religion which prevails among us, is one great, if not the chief cau&s;e, why our laws are &s;o feeble in their operation. Immorality is the natural con&s;equence of impiety. An irreligious, will always be an immoral, people; and among &s;uch, good and whole&s;ome laws can never be executed with punctuality</P>
<P>Some of our laws may be erroneous or defective, and not framed with a &s;ufficient regard to the &s;pirit of the people; and this hath been a&s;&s;igned by &s;uperficial thinkers as the only rea&s;on why they are not carried into execution. This, I think, is a great mi&s;take. Our laws though they may partake of that imperfection which is the common mark of all human productions, are in general &s;alutary, and calculated to promote our political happine&s;s. Here lies the grand defect; a defect which is not to be attributed &s;olely or even principally to the badne&s;s of our laws, but to &s;ome other cau&s;es. Whatever the&s;e may be, the effect is &s;ufficiently alarming, and threatens a &s;peedy di&s;&s;olution of our govern|ment. Let our laws be ever &s;o good, if they are not properly executed, our government can be of no long duration.</P>
<P>A tran&s;ient view of tho&s;e &s;tates and kingdoms, which have made the mo&s;t &s;triking figure in the hi&s;tory of the world, and which have been mo&s;t renowned for the felicity of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> convince us, that reli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> was by them
<PB N="4" REF="021418_0003_0FB3EE702BBA4E30">
always con&s;idered as a matter of great importance to civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t politicians and mo&s;t celebrated legi&s;lators of antiquity depended much on this to give &s;anction to their laws, and make them operate with vigour and facility.</P>
<P>If we carefully con&s;ider the nature of religion and of civil government, we will be led to conclude, that in this they did not act at random; but from the mo&s;t profound know|ledge of human nature, and the dictates of the &s;ounde&s;t policy. The manners of the people, though &s;o little attend|ed to by our legi&s;lators, are confe&s;&s;ed by all to be of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence in a commonwealth. The mo&s;t profligate politician can expatiate on the nece&s;&s;ity of good morals; but we hear little of religion from our mo&s;t re&s;pec|table &s;tate&s;men. When the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion is of politics, &s;he is generally kicked out of doors, as having nothing to do either with morality or civil policy. The in&s;eparable connection between this daughter of heaven and her genuine offspring morality, is forgotten, and her influence on civil &s;ociety almo&s;t wholly overlooked.</P>
<P>For the better arrangement of our thoughts on this exten|&s;ive &s;ubject, we &s;hall&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">I. Con&s;ider religion under its more general notion, as comprehending the belief of a deity, a providence, and future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments.</P>
<P N="2">II. We &s;hall con&s;ider the chri&s;tian religion in particular; and, as we pa&s;s along, endeavour to &s;how the influence of both on civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>That religion is of great importance to &s;ociety is univer|&s;ally acknowledged. A&s;&s;uming this for granted, let us proceed to enquire how it operates to produce tho&s;e effects which are confe&s;&s;ed to be of &s;uch &s;ingular &s;ervice. It is a common ob&s;ervation, that we are &s;o formed as to be greatly influenced by whatever works upon our hopes or our fears. Now it is by taking hold on the&s;e that religion produces tho&s;e &s;alutary effects of which we now &s;peak; thus re&s;training men from vice by the dread of puni&s;hment, and alluring them to virtue by the hope of reward. The&s;e are the two princi|ples,
<PB N="5" REF="021418_0004_0FB3EE71AA49CA58">
or if you plea&s;e, pa&s;&s;ions, in human nature, which fir&s;t prompted men to enter into the &s;ocial union; fear of violence from each other, and hope of &s;ecurity by a&s;&s;ociation. And it is only by working on the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, that the union of men in the &s;ocial &s;tate can be rendered permanent, and laws operate with that energy which is nece&s;&s;ary to obtain their end.</P>
<P>They who firmly believe that there is a God who governs the world, who &s;ees all their actions, and who will certainly reward virtue and puni&s;h vice, mu&s;t undoubtedly be influen|ced by this belief; and re&s;trained, at lea&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure, from evil, and excited to good.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed indeed, that there are too many who profe&s;s to believe the doctrines of religion, who &s;eem to be very little influenced by them. Hurried away by the violence of their pa&s;&s;ions, they frequently tran&s;gre&s;s the bounds which religion pre&s;cribes, and prefer the gratification of pre&s;ent appetite to the enjoyment of future good. But we mu&s;t not hence conclude, that religion is in no degree a curb to the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of men. They who in &s;ome in&s;tances act thus contrary to their principles, would go much further, were they void of tho&s;e principles, and the reins laid o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the neck of appetite. It will not follow, that becau&s;e religion does not re&s;train from immorality totally and univer&s;ally, therefore it is no re&s;traint at all. By the &s;ame way of rea&s;oning, we might prove, that civil laws lay no re&s;traint upon men, becau&s;e they do not entirely re&s;train all men, at all times and in all in&s;tances.</P>
<P>In order that we may be more fully convinced of the utility, and even nece&s;&s;ity of religion, to the well-being, we might venture to &s;ay, to the very exi&s;tence of civil &s;ociety, it will be nece&s;&s;ary a little to enquire into the e&s;&s;ential defects of the be&s;t con&s;tituted government po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the end of civil &s;ociety and the evils it was de&s;igned to remedy, we will be convinced from its very nature, that it cannot reach that end, nor guard again&s;t tho&s;e evils, without the aid of religion. Let it &s;uffice to ob&s;erve, that <HI>&s;ecurity</HI> of <HI>life, liberty</HI> and <HI>property,</HI> is the preci&s;e and
<PB N="6" REF="021418_0005_0FB3EE732C719810">
&s;pecific end of the &s;ocial compact. Other advantages it brings with it, and an&s;wers many other valuable purpo&s;es. But the evils for which it was de&s;igned as a remedy, are inju&s;|tice, violence, rapine, mutual &s;laughter and blood&s;hed. The manner in which men aim at the cure of the&s;e evils, is by laws enacted with common con&s;ent, enforced by a &s;anction, and committed to the magi&s;trate to be &s;trictly and impartially carried into execution.</P>
<P>That civil government may fully and completely obtain its end, it is nece&s;&s;ary that its laws &s;hould have &s;uch a &s;anction, and operate in &s;uch a manner, as to prevent or puni&s;h all crimes what&s;oever, which may be injurious to the communi|ty, or tend to its di&s;&s;olution. It will, I &s;uppo&s;e, be readily granted on all hands, that there never were, nor ever will be, laws &s;o &s;anctioned as to operate in this manner. Hence appea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s the in&s;ufficiency of civil &s;ociety to an&s;wer its end.</P>
<P>The two great &s;anctions of all laws have been generally reckoned <HI>reward</HI> and <HI>puni&s;hment,</HI> and indeed without the&s;e two &s;anctions, every one mu&s;t &s;ee, that government cannot, in any tolerable degree, an&s;wer its end, or laws operate in &s;uch a manner as is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure its very exi&s;tence. But civil &s;ociety, without the &s;upport of religion, is altoge|ther de&s;titute of one of the&s;e &s;anctions; and can apply the other but in a very partial manner, and under great re|&s;trictions.</P>
<P N="1">I. Civil &s;ociety wholly wants the <HI>&s;anction</HI> of <HI>reward.</HI></P>
<P>In an age and place &s;o highly enlightened in the nature and principles of &s;ound policy, I &s;hall not enter into a for|mal proof, that reward is not, and cannot be the &s;anction of civil &s;ociety, con&s;idered in it&s;elf. It will be &s;ufficient ju&s;t to ob&s;erve, "that no &s;tate whatever can po&s;&s;e&s;s a fund large enough to reward all its &s;ubjects for obedience to the laws, unle&s;s it be fir&s;t drawn from them by a tax, to be paid back to a reward." Government can indeed, and it hath been the cu&s;tom in all governments, to reward particular &s;ubjects for eminent &s;ervices; but every one mu&s;t &s;ee, that this is &s;omething very different from the idea of reward con&s;idered as the &s;anction of civil laws. A reward barely for obedience

And here I imagine, if any where, it is that &s;o many have fallen into a mi&s;take in this matter. To this it may be briefly replied, that protection is a debt due from <HI>all</HI> to <HI>every individual,</HI> for that portion of his natural liberty which he hath given up in the original compact. If protection, in &s;trict propriety of &s;peech, be reward, then with drawing it mu&s;t be puni&s;hment, which it is not invariably, but only accidentally. The con&s;equence of withdraw|ing protection is, or at lea&s;t always ought to be, bani&s;hment. But bani&s;hment is not always a puni&s;hment. It becomes &s;o only by accident. It is &s;o intentionally, but not always con&s;equentially. Puni&s;hment is not of the e&s;&s;ence of bani&s;hment; for it would be ea&s;y to put a ca&s;e where bani&s;hment mu&s;t be con&s;idered, not as a puni&s;hment, but a very great ble&s;&s;ing. This &s;hows that protection con&s;idered as reward, is not the &s;anction of human laws in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e that puni&s;hment is, to which it ought to be properly oppo&s;ed, if indeed it be the &s;anction of reward.</NOTE> be&s;tow. Without entering any further into this &s;ubject, we &s;hall take it for granted that civil &s;ociety, in it&s;elf, totally wants one of tho&s;e &s;anctions which are nece&s;&s;ary to enforce its laws. That this is a very great and e&s;&s;ential defect, will, we hope, be allowed by every competent judge. How, and in what degree religion &s;upplies this defect, will be &s;een hereafter. At pre&s;ent let us a little enquire,</P>
<P N="2">II. Into the effects of puni&s;hment con&s;idered as a &s;anction. This is the proper and only &s;anction of civil laws. But how imperfectly it can be enforced by &s;ociety will appear from the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">I. Civil government cannot puni&s;h &s;ecret crimes.</P>
<P>That the&s;e abound in every &s;ociety, is matter of univer&s;al experience; that they are injurious to it, is too plain to admit of the lea&s;t doubt; that they are even multiplied by it, a little attention to human nature, will evince. When men are re&s;trained from open tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, by the terror of laws and the dread of puni&s;hment, it is natural for them to fly to the covert of &s;ecrecy, that they may evade the laws, and e&s;cape with impunity. They know that civil judica|tures take cognizance only of tho&s;e crimes which are appa|rent:
<PB N="8" REF="021418_0007_0FB3EE76ED384758">
and if they can only conceal their guilt from the eyes of men, they are &s;ure to e&s;cape that puni&s;hment which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s the &s;anction of human laws. This will deter them from open violence, but at the &s;ame time, &s;pur them on to &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ret craft and &s;tratagem. This will lead them to &s;tudy and improve all the latent arts of mi&s;chief and malice: and the very &s;ecurity which &s;ociety affords, by throwing men off their guard, gives de&s;igning villains an opportunity of practi&s;ing the&s;e with greater &s;ucce&s;s. I crave the readers particular attention to this circum&s;tance, as it is of the fir&s;t impor|tance to the point in hand, and in the cleare&s;t manner &s;hows the nece&s;&s;ity of religion in civil government.</P>
<P N="2">II. Civil &s;ociety not only cannot puni&s;h &s;ecret crimes, but, in &s;ome ca&s;es, cannot adequately puni&s;h even &s;uch as a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e apparent and can be clearly proven. So inordinate are the appetites of men, and &s;o violent the impul&s;e of the &s;en&s;ual pa&s;&s;ions, that the &s;evere puni&s;hment of one crime, would &s;ometimes, open a door to others of a more attrocious nature and pernicious tendency. We give only one in&s;tance of this kind. The judicious reader may, if he be &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, &s;upply others of a &s;imilar nature. Fornication is undoubt|edly injurious, and attended with very pernicious con&s;equen|ces to a &s;tate: but notwith&s;tanding this, it would not be wi&s;|dom in any government to puni&s;h it in proportion to its evil influence. The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e &s;uch puni&s;hment would lead to more fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gitious lu&s;ts, to more enormous and unnatural crimes. Accordingly, we find, that no great wi&s;e and fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uri&s;hing community, hath ever pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;hed fornication as its pernicious effects on &s;ociety confe&s;&s;edly de&s;erve. It will be difficult to a&s;&s;ign any other rea&s;on for this than that which we have ju&s;t now mentioned.</P>
<P N="3">III. Imperfect rights, by &s;ome termed the duties of im|perfect obligation, &s;uch as gratitude, ho&s;pitality, charity, &amp;c. are not the proper objects of civil laws. They cannot conveniently reach the&s;e, nor enforce the ob&s;ervance of them by penal &s;anction. We have no laws among us to puni&s;h the neglect of the&s;e duties; and civil &s;ociety, at lea&s;t in its
<PB N="9" REF="021418_0008_0FB3EE77A9A773C0">
legi&s;lative capacity, takes no notice of them. For this, I &s;uppo&s;e, two rea&s;ons may be given.</P>
<P N="1">I. The violation of the&s;e is not &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o immediately and directly to &s;trike at the exi&s;tence of the &s;ocial union, as the violation of the duties of perfect obligation.</P>
<P N="2">II. There can be no preci&s;e and fixed rule laid down for the regulation of mens conduct with re&s;pect to the&s;e duties.</P>
<P>Of all the imperfect rights, gratitude approaches neare&s;t to tho&s;e which are of complete obligation None of all tho&s;e duties which cannot be properly exacted by law, admits of &s;uch accurate and determinate rules: But altho' the crime of ingratitude may be more ea&s;ily a&s;certained than any other of the &s;ame cla&s;s, the &s;lighte&s;t con&s;ideration will con|vince us, that no law can be framed by the wit of man for the puni&s;hment of it, which will not be loo&s;e, vague and liable to a thou&s;and exceptions. And if this be the ca&s;e with ingratitude, much more with the others. We may therefore conclude without he&s;itation, that human laws cannot enforce the duties of imperfect obligation. Now, altho' the violation of the&s;e duties may not &s;o directly tend to the di&s;&s;olution of &s;ociety, nor bring on &s;uch rapid de&s;truc|tion, as the neglect of tho&s;e which are called <HI>perfect rights,</HI> it is clear, that it mu&s;t gradually &s;ap the foundations of government, and de&s;troy that union and concord &s;o nece&s;&s;a|ry to its well-being&punc; If then civil laws, by their proper power cannot provide for the ob&s;ervance of the duties which are of &s;uch great moment to &s;ociety, it mu&s;t be acknowledged a great deficiency. Thus it appears, that civil &s;ociety totally wants <HI>one</HI> of tho&s;e &s;anctions which have been always reck|oned its two grand p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">llars, and can apply the <HI>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her</HI> only in a very limited degree. An eminent writer hath a&s;&s;erted, "that civil &s;ociety by its own proper power, cannot provide for above one third of the moral duties." I have not made the calculation, but believe he is near the truth. And we may add, that it can provide for the&s;e few but very imperfectly. Let us now enquire how religion &s;upplies the&s;e deficiencies.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t natural and obvious notions of the deity is, that he abhors vice and delights in virtue, will puni&s;h
<PB REF="021418_0009_0FB3EE792B792A68">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and reward the other. They who firmly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> properly attend to this important religious truth, mu&s;t, without doubt, be greatly influenced by it. When they call to mind that they are accountable creatures, and mu&s;t be happy or mi&s;erable hereafter, according as they behave them|&s;elves here, this will doubtle&s;s be a powerful motive to &s;hun vice and pur&s;ue virtue. Religion holds up to all her &s;incere votaries, a reward, than which nothing can be greater, more noble, and better &s;uited to influence the mind. The pro&s;|pect of an happine&s;s the mo&s;t exalted in its nature, the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite in degree, and eternal in duration, mu&s;t &s;trongly allure tho&s;e to whom the de&s;ire of happine&s;s is natural. Such, in the opinion of &s;ome of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of the heathens, is that felicity which awaits the virtuous man after death. This is the reward which religion promi&s;es, and which the good man expects to enjoy as the recompence of his virtue and piety.</P>
<P>Without determining whether the hope of reward, or the dread of puni&s;hment, mo&s;t influences the actions of men, in general, we may &s;afely affirm, that on minds of a particular ca&s;t, the former works much more powerfully than the latter. Men of great and haughty &s;ouls, of elevated and daring &s;pirits, revolt again&s;t every thing that wears the appearance of compul&s;ion. They &s;corn to be overawed by the fear of puni&s;hment; and con&s;ider it as a motive fit only to operate upon little minds, and timorous &s;pirits. The dread of civil laws, and even the terrors of religion, can have but little effect upon &s;uch men; but they may be ea&s;ily wrought upon by the pro&s;pect of a reward &s;uited to the greatne&s;s of their minds. The religioni&s;t, tho' he may not be prompted to yield obedience to the wi&s;e and &s;alutary laws of his country, by the hope of a reward from his fellow citizens, expects ample retribution from him who knows the &s;incerity and uprightne&s;s of his conduct. He looks for no reward from man, but expects it from him who is the rewarder of all tho&s;e who walk in the paths of virtue. As the laws in every well con&s;tituted and wi&s;ely governed &s;tate, will, as far as they reach, ever coincide with the eternal laws of the deity, he
<PB N="11" REF="021418_0010_0FB3EE7AAA270BD0">
pay a religious regard to them, not only as ratified by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> authority of government, but as bearing the &s;tamp, and being the &s;overeign mandates of the &s;upreme lord of all.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Human laws are mea&s;ures in re&s;pect of men who&s;e actions they mu&s;t direct, how-be-it &s;uch mea&s;ures they are, as have al&s;o their higher rules to be mea&s;ured by, which rules are two, the law of God and the law of nature; &s;o that laws human, mu&s;t be made according to the general laws of nature, and without contradiction to any po&s;itive law of &s;cripture, otherwi&s;e they are ill made. Hooker.</P>
<P>This was al&s;o the opinion of Mr. Locke, who quotes this very pa&s;&s;age of Hooker in his treati&s;e on government. If &s;ome of our laws, in the &s;tate of South Carolina, were brought to this te&s;t, I think they would be found not exactly agreeable to tho&s;e two rules; and therefore not good.</P></NOTE> Deeply impre&s;&s;ed with this awful &s;anction of the deity, powerfully influenced by the hope of that reward which is the con&s;equence of obedience to his laws, he will practi&s;e ju&s;tice in all its various branches. This important virtue is the proper object of laws, both human and divine; and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, not only to the welfare, but al&s;o to the very exi&s;tence of civil government. Even a &s;ociety of robbers, according to a trite ob&s;ervation, cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t with|out &s;ome degree of it. Whatever, therefore, hath a tenden|cy to lead men to the practice of this cardinal virtue, mu&s;t be peculiarly advantageous to civil &s;ociety. Now certainly that man who acts under the influence of religious motive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and principles, who con&s;iders the laws of ju&s;tice as the laws of God, who, he believes, will reward him for obedience and puni&s;h him for di&s;obedience, is more likely to practi&s;e ju&s;tice, than one who is influenced only by human authority, and the terror of human laws, which he can often evade, and &s;o e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed. It is ea&s;y to determine which of the&s;e will be mo&s;t faithful to his tru&s;t, mo&s;t hone&s;t and upright in his dealings, mo&s;t careful to &s;hun every thing that may be injurious to his neighbour, in per&s;on, character, or property.</P>
<P>But further: religion will not only lead tho&s;e who are influenced by it to the exerci&s;e of ju&s;tice in it's various branches; but will induce them to the exact performance of all tho&s;e duties of imperfect obligation which human laws cannot enforce. The civil magi&s;trate takes no notice of
<PB N="12" REF="021418_0011_0FB3EE7C39591F30">
and can neither reward the performance, nor puni&s;h the neglect of them; but the laws of God extend to them; and religion as &s;trongly exacts them as the duties of perfect obligation. The religious man con&s;iders them as truly binding, as the mo&s;t obvious dictates of ju&s;tice. He as much expects to be rewarded for the one, as the other. This will lead him to pay the mo&s;t &s;acred regard to the duties of gratitude, humanity, ho&s;pitality, charity,&mdash;in a word, to all tho&s;e kind and beneficent offices, which are &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the welfare of the community; tho' they are not, and indeed cannot be, the proper objects of human laws. We think it unnece&s;&s;ary to enlarge upon the duties ju&s;t now mentioned, by &s;hewing how much the careful performance of them tends to &s;trengthen and confirm the &s;ocial union. The &s;lighte&s;t con&s;ideration will immediately convince us, of what va&s;t importance they are to &s;ociety, and how much they promote peace, love, harmony, and con&s;equently felicity, in the &s;ocial &s;tate. We need only conceive what would be the con&s;equence of the total neglect of the&s;e duties, to be fully convinced of their u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ility. What a &s;hocking and deplorable &s;cene of malice, hatred, &s;trife, cruelty, mi&s;ery, and di&s;traction, opens upon the mind, on the ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;uppo&s;ition. And yet civil &s;ociety, as hath been ob&s;erved, cannot enforce the&s;e duties, the practice of which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to its happine&s;s, and the neglect of which endangers its very exi&s;tence. If then religion enforces the&s;e duties, and leads men to the performance of them, it will certainly follow, that it is u&s;eful to the &s;tate. Thus religion like a powerful ally, comes in to the aid of civil government, and by e&s;tabli&s;hing the &s;anction of reward, which it wholly wants, &s;upplies its defects.</P>
<P>But, in order more fully to demon&s;trate how religion &s;upplies the defects of civil &s;ociety, let it be ob&s;erved, that it not only furni&s;hes the &s;anction of reward, which it &s;o much needs, but al&s;o &s;uperadds a new &s;anction of puni&s;hment, which co-operates with, and gives additional energy to human laws. The reader will plea&s;e to remember, that we have already &s;hewn, that civil &s;ociety can apply the &s;anction of
<PB N="13" REF="021418_0012_0FB3EE7E6CFA7720">
only in a very low and limited degree. Some crimes are &s;ecret and cannot be puni&s;hed by civil laws, becau&s;e they lie wholly beyond their reach. Others are of &s;uch a nature, that the &s;evere puni&s;hment of them opens an avenue to tho&s;e of a more atrocious nature. But this is not the ca&s;e with the &s;anction of puni&s;hment which religion e&s;tabli&s;hes. It applies to all crimes what&s;oever, let their nature or circum|&s;tances be what they may. Men may e&s;cape the puni&s;h|ment which civil &s;ociety decrees, by concealing their crimes; but they cannot thus elude that which religion holds out to all tho&s;e who violate her laws. They who believe that God governs the world in wi&s;dom and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and that his providence extends to all his creatures, mu&s;t al&s;o believe, that he is omni&s;cient, and, of con&s;equence, perfectly acquaint|ed with all their actions and intentions. All who have a firm per&s;ua&s;ion and proper impre&s;&s;ion of this great religious truth, will be &s;en&s;ible, how vain it is to attempt to cover their crimes from him, who&s;e all &s;eeing eye penetrates the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of their hearts. Religion teaches, that all the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions of the wicked, tho' they may e&s;cape the ob&s;ervation of men, lie open to the deity, who&s;e "eyes are like a flame of fire;" and who will in due time inflict that puni&s;hment which they ju&s;tly de&s;erve. As the pro&s;pect of impunity invites men to evil, &s;o the certainty of puni&s;hment tends to re&s;train them from it, e&s;pecially if the puni&s;hment be un&s;peakably great and dreadful. And &s;uch, both chri&s;tians and heathens, have agreed to repre&s;ent the puni&s;hment of vice in a future life. If then the dread of a puni&s;hment certain, terrible, and everla&s;ting, can have any influence on the minds of men, religion mu&s;t be a powerful re&s;traint, not only from open, but &s;ecret crimes. Where crimes are &s;ecret, or of &s;uch a nature as not to be cognizable by human judicatures, the &s;anction of civil laws cea&s;es to operate, and is no longer of any &s;ervice to re&s;train from tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Here religion comes in mo&s;t opportunely to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of civil &s;ociety, by impre&s;&s;ing the idea of a future &s;tate, an omni&s;cient tribu|nal, and a puni&s;hment which the guilty cannot po&s;&s;ibly avoid. On the other hand where the crime is open, and liable to be
<PB N="14" REF="021418_0013_0FB3EE7FEA520F88">
by human laws, the &s;anction of religion falls in with, and &s;trengthens that of human laws, by holding out a puni&s;h|ment much more certain, as well as more formidable, than man can inflict.</P>
<P>Men may be guilty of the blacke&s;t ingratitude, and, in general, totally neglect the duties of imperfect obligation, without incu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring the lea&s;t danger from the civil powers. But altho' civil government ordains no penalties in this ca&s;e, religion does; and thus furni&s;hes a remedy for that material defect. The man who lives under the belief and impre&s;&s;ion of religion, looks upon him&s;elf accountable at the bar of the omni&s;cient for the neglect of tho&s;e duties. Tho' he is under no terror from the laws of men, he fears that future vengeance which awaits the guilty beyond the grave.</P>
<P>But it may be objected again&s;t the above rea&s;oning,&mdash; That religion is not &s;o u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary as hath been repre&s;ented&mdash;That tho' civil &s;ociety labours under great deficiencies, there are other ways by which they may be &s;upplied. It may be &s;aid, that the regard which men have to their own intere&s;t, their own temporal happine&s;s and &s;ecurity, will naturally lead them to pay a &s;trict regard to the laws of &s;ociety, and al&s;o to perform tho&s;e duties which laws cannot enforce, as well as to avoid tho&s;e crimes which they cannot puni&s;h&mdash;That the happine&s;s of every individual in &s;ociety is involved with, and depends upon the happine&s;s of the whole. That every one may &s;ee, that without obedi|ence to good and whole&s;ome laws, government mu&s;t be rent into pieces, and he him&s;elf &s;hare in the common ruin. And further, that the omi&s;&s;ion even of tho&s;e duties which civil laws do not require, and the commi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e crimes which they cannot puni&s;h, mu&s;t be injurious to the welfare of the &s;tate, and con&s;equently to his own happine&s;s;&mdash;therefore a regard to his own intere&s;t, and temporal pro&s;perity, mu&s;t induce him to perform tho&s;e duties, and &s;hun tho&s;e crimes.</P>
<P>To all which we beg leave to reply;&mdash;that it may be readily granted, without any di&s;advantage to the argument, that the con&s;iderations mentioned, will have their weight with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> it would betray no &s;mall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> ignorance

of human nature to &s;uppo&s;e, that tho&s;e things have any con&s;iderable influence on the bulk of mankind. They think but little of &s;uch matters. They are not di&s;po&s;ed to attend to &s;uch far-fetched deductions, nor to refine even thus far. Such kind of rea&s;onings, tho' obvious enough to tho&s;e who have attended to the nature and influence of civil &s;ociety, to them appears not a little intricate and perplexed. There is not perhaps a people on the face of the earth, more enlight|ened in the nature of civil government, than the Americans <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and yet I &s;uppo&s;e it may be mode&s;tly affirmed, that by far the greater part of them, reflect but little, how &s;ociety procures tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings which they enjoy; becau&s;e they are not immediately and directly the con&s;equence of it. The gro&s;s of the common people are too much occupied about other matters, to examine remote con&s;equences, or trace their pre&s;ent happy and flouri&s;hing circum&s;tances to &s;o di&s;tant a &s;ource as civil &s;ociety. They generally attribute the&s;e to their own prudence, indu&s;try and addre&s;s, without looking any further. For the mo&s;t part they are pur&s;uing their own private and &s;eparate intere&s;t, little &s;olicitous about the public good, tho' they may at the &s;ame time be promoting it. They &s;eldom reflect, that they are a part of a whole, with which they are obliged to &s;tand or fall; or con&s;ider, that their happine&s;s depends upon that of the community of which they are members. Men who are immured in their &s;tudies, and conver&s;ant chiefly with books, may wonder how people can be ignorant of the&s;e things: but let them travel through our country, and conver&s;e with tho&s;e of the lower rank, who make the bulk in every government, and they will find great numbers, and tho&s;e not the wor&s;t citizens, much like the &s;imple Hibernian, who when he was informed the &s;hip was &s;inking, made this reply; "what do I care, I am only a pa&s;&s;enger." In order, therefore, that the gro&s;s of the people may di&s;charge their duty as good citizens, &s;ome more obvious and immediate motive is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply the imperfection of civil laws;&mdash;&s;ome principle of action which comes more directly home to them, and affects them more imme|diately as individuals. Such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of religion, which teaches,
<PB N="16" REF="021418_0015_0FB3EE8300250878">
the virtuous &s;hall be rewarded, and the vicious puni&s;hed in a future &s;tate. This leading principle, which &s;eems in a great mea&s;ure natural to the mind of man, will have a much greater influence on the generality of mank<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd, and do more to &s;upply the defects of civil &s;ociety than all the rea&s;onings in the world, which, tho' they may be ju&s;t, are but little attended to by mo&s;t men.</P>
<P>The whole of what is urged in the objection, under the notion of motive, may be re&s;olved into the principle of &s;elf-love; which when duly modified, properly directed, and wi&s;ely regulated, is no doubt, favourable to civil govern|ment. But who does not &s;ee, that the love of &s;elf is almo&s;t always inordinate in the pur&s;uit of pre&s;ent good, and frequent|ly, by a blind and furious impul&s;e to pre&s;ent gratification, breaks thro' all the fences of law, and leads men to all man|ner of violence and inju&s;tice. Indeed, to counteract and re&s;train the exce&s;s of this pa&s;&s;ion, and correct the evils which ari&s;e from it, is the very de&s;ign of the civil compact. <HI>This</HI> government attempts, by laying hold on this &s;ame principle, the &s;tronge&s;t in human nature, and endeavouring to prevent its ill effects, by giving it an oppo&s;ite direction. This it can do but very imperfectly by its own proper power; and therefore &s;tands in need of aid from &s;ome other quarter. Here religion affords the nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance; for by incul|cating a future retribution, and thus exciting the hopes and the fears of men, &s;he oppo&s;es &s;elf-<HI>love</HI> to <HI>&s;elf-love.</HI> My meaning is, that &s;he oppo&s;es the love of &s;elf as de&s;iring future good, and &s;hunning future evil, to the love of &s;elf con&s;idered as pur&s;uing the unlawful gratification of pre&s;ent irregular ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etite. The language of civil laws is, "if you tran&s;gre&s;s, through an inordinate love of &s;elf, you &s;hall be puni&s;hed:" which very threatening is an application to the &s;elfi&s;h principle, &s;elf-love always leading men to avoid that which they reck|on in its nature evil. The language of religion is "if you carefully ob&s;erve the wi&s;e and &s;alutary laws of your countr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and faithfully di&s;charge the duties of a good citizen, you &s;hall have an ample reward; but if hurried away by the impul&s;e of &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions, you violate the laws, and
<PB N="17" REF="021418_0016_0FB3EE85295592D0">
the rights of your fellow-citizens, the mo&s;t dreadful puni&s;h|ment awaits you." It is ea&s;y to &s;ee how far the language of both coincides. They only differ in this, that the one reach|es further than the other. The one denounces puni&s;hment, but promi&s;es no reward; the other not only promi&s;es a reward, but threatens a more dreadful puni&s;hment. Civil laws lay hold, more e&s;pecially, on mens fears; religion both on their hopes and their fears. Both addre&s;s them&s;elves to the &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions; both oppo&s;e &s;elf-love to &s;elf-love, in the &s;en&s;e already explained. But grant all that is &s;uppo&s;ed in the objection, it will by no means overthrow our argument. We have no where a&s;&s;erted, that there are no other princi|ples in human nature, be&s;ides religion, which tend in any degree to remedy the imperfections of &s;ociety; but only, that religion is the mo&s;t proper and natural remedy. What|ever may any how &s;erve as a foundation of moral obligation, if indeed there may be any &s;uch foundation di&s;tinct from the will of the <HI>&s;upreme,</HI> as the <HI>moral &s;en&s;e,</HI> the <HI>e&s;&s;ential differ|ence</HI> of things; the&s;e, as far as they lead men to approve and practi&s;e virtue, and &s;hun vice, tend to promote the happine&s;s of &s;ociety. If a principle of honor and &s;hame, a regard to character and dread of contempt and di&s;grace, induce men to virtuous actions, and re&s;train them from the contrary, they mu&s;t be con&s;idered as contributing in &s;ome degree to &s;upply the defects of civil laws. I am, however, per&s;uaded, that upon a careful examination, the&s;e will be found not to have all that influence &s;ome may imagine. They are not a little precarious, and depend much upon time, place, educa|tion, cu&s;tom and fa&s;hion. What is reckoned honorable at one time and place, is not reckoned &s;o at another. Cu&s;tom and fa&s;hion, which exerci&s;e a kind of de&s;poti&s;m over us in matters of le&s;s con&s;equence, introduce very con&s;iderable changes even in moral &s;entiments and conduct. That rigid virtue and au&s;terity of manners which &s;o &s;trongly marked the ri&s;e of the Roman republic, would have appeared ridicu|lous and contemptible, when that empire began to decline. That &s;tyle of manners which was reckoned honorable, and procured the highe&s;t veneration in Cromwell's time, was the
<PB N="18" REF="021418_0017_0FB3EE86A84616D0">
object of &s;corn and deri&s;ion, under the voluptuous reign of the &s;econd Charles. Cu&s;tom hath reconciled many of the Carolinians and Georgians to a treatment of their &s;laves which a Penn&s;ylvanian looks upon with horror; it is a cu&s;tom among &s;ome &s;avage nations to expo&s;e infants; and this practice prevailed among the Athenians and &s;everal other Grecian &s;tates, tho' civilized in a very high degree. And to increa&s;e our wonder, it was defended and inculcated by their greate&s;t philo&s;ophers. We look upon this cu&s;tom with the utmo&s;t abhorrence, we con&s;ider it as the highe&s;t pitch of barbarity, and the mo&s;t &s;hocking violation of the laws of na|ture and humanity; but among them, it was no way di&s;grace|ful, and pa&s;t without blame or cen&s;ure. After all, from the in&s;tances given above, we mu&s;t not conclude, as &s;ome have done, that there is no other difference in moral actions and &s;entiments than that which ari&s;es from education, cu&s;tom, or opinion. The foundations of morality are more deep and &s;ta|ble, than to be overthrown &s;o ea&s;ily as &s;uch men imagine. There are &s;ome actions and characters to which no education or cu&s;|tom whatever can reconcile men. Cu&s;tom can never bring us to approve of ingratitude and treachery; and to look upon them as honorable and worthy of prai&s;e as gratitude and faithfulne&s;s. Becau&s;e men in &s;ome particular in&s;tances, thro' the influence of cu&s;tom or education, act contrary to what we reckon the plain rules of morality, it will not follow that the&s;e rules have no other foundation. This would prove too much; for by the &s;ame method of arguing, we might prove, that there is no &s;uch thing as a principle of rea&s;on in men; becau&s;e in millions of in&s;tances, cu&s;tom and education lead them to act contrary to its plain dictates. Let the <HI>moral &s;en&s;e,</HI> the <HI>e&s;&s;ential difference,</HI> the principles of <HI>honor</HI> and <HI>&s;hame,</HI> have all the weight which can with any &s;how of rea&s;on be allowed them, enough will &s;till be left for religion. With all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which the&s;e can afford, human laws will be found but a weak fence again&s;t the violence and inju&s;tice of men.</P>
<P>The capable reader will have ob&s;erved, that we have cautiou&s;ly avoided to embroil our&s;elves in tho&s;e di&s;putes
<PB N="19" REF="021418_0018_0FB3EE8829C61F50">
which have been agitated concerning the foundation of moral obligation.</P>
<P>It is well known that three different opinions have been advanced on this head: &s;ome founding it on the <HI>moral &s;en&s;e,</HI> others on the <HI>e&s;&s;ential difference</HI> of things, and others on the <HI>will</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> Strictly &s;peaking, perhaps this la&s;t only, can properly oblige <HI>men.</HI> But in order to maintain this, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to exclude the other two from all influence on morality. Where is the ab&s;urdity of allowing all three a &s;hare in leading men to the practice of virtue? Without determining any thing po&s;itively concerning this matter, we have endeavored to prove, that religion cannot be con&s;ider|ed as unnece&s;&s;ary, even on the principles of tho&s;e who are mo&s;t &s;trongly attached to the <HI>moral &s;en&s;e</HI> and the <HI>e&s;&s;ential difference.</HI> The&s;e two have indeed, of late, been the hobby-hor&s;es of their re&s;pective patrons. They make the princi|pal figure in the writings of mo&s;t of our modern morali&s;ts, not to &s;ay divines. The <HI>will</HI> of God, or what comes nearly to the &s;ame thing, <HI>religion,</HI> which is indeed the only proper and &s;table foundation of morality, is either wholly excluded, or brought in only by the bye, as a matter of little or no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> con|&s;equence. The&s;e &s;ine-&s;pun &s;y&s;tems, however much they may di&s;play the ingenuity of their authors, have but very little tendency to promote virtue, and reform the manners of the people; and therefore can be of little &s;ervice to &s;ociety. It is not ea&s;y to &s;ee how the <HI>moral &s;en&s;e,</HI> or the <HI>e&s;&s;ential differ|ence,</HI> or both taken together, when con&s;idered as wholly di&s;|tinct from religion, if indeed they can be &s;o con&s;idered, can properly e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;anction of future reward and puni&s;h|ment. This we have &s;hewn is of the greate&s;t moment to civil government; and hence ari&s;es the &s;ingular utility of religion.</P>
<P>The ab&s;tract beauty of virtue may operate upon profound rea&s;oners,&mdash;that plea&s;ure which ari&s;es from tho&s;e actions which the moral &s;en&s;e approves, may have its weight with men of elegant minds and delicate &s;entiments; but neither of them will have much effect upon the great body of mankind. They will be always found to operate but very faintly upon
<PB N="20" REF="021418_0019_0FB3EE89AA3D5EA8">
<HI>many,</HI> who have, generally, "quick &s;en&s;es, &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions and gro&s;s intellects." This &s;ingle ob&s;ervation &s;hows of how little con&s;equence they are, when compared with religion, which is calculated to operate upon the bulk of the common people in every &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, tho' we &s;hould grant that other things co-operate with religion in &s;upplying the defects of civil &s;ociety, we need not fear to conclude, that this is the mo&s;t proper, and at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t powerful remedy.</P>
<P>Before we conclude this part, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to add a few words concerning the u&s;e of oaths, which <HI>may</HI> be con|&s;idered as a di&s;tinct argument, to prove the influence of religion on civil &s;ociety. Solemn oaths, as far as I can learn, have obtained in all civilized nations. It is well known, what amazing force and influence they had upon the Romans in the virtuous period of their republic. In the greate&s;t extremity, and mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing dangers, the&s;e were their <HI>der|nier</HI> re&s;ort. We have in&s;tances enow of this in their hi&s;tory. Let one &s;uffice in this place: After the battle of Cannae, the people were &s;truck with &s;uch a panic terror, that they talked of removing to Sicily. But Scipio had the addre&s;s to ob|tain an oath from them, that they would not leave Rome. The dread of violating this oath overwhelmed all other ap|prehen&s;ions. "Rome," &s;ays the excellent Monte&s;quieu, "was a &s;hip held by two anchors, religion and morality, in the mid&s;t of a furious tempe&s;t."</P>
<P>If Mr. Locke, and the American politicians, argue right, all legitimate government is originally founded on compact. This compact is u&s;ually ratified by &s;olemn oaths. The chief magi&s;trate, who is inve&s;ted with the &s;upreme executive power, is bound by oath, faithfully and impartially to execute the laws, and govern agreeably to them. In like manner, every citizen is bound to aid and &s;upport him, as far as he acts conformably to his &s;olemn engagement. Among us, it is well known, that all civil officers from the governor down to the con&s;table, are obliged by oath, to the di&s;charge of their re&s;pective tru&s;ts. The policy, and even nece&s;&s;ity of all this, is very obvious; for altho' our civil
<PB N="21" REF="021418_0020_0FB3EE8B2BACE880">
officers are amenable for their conduct, and liable to be puni&s;hed upon conviction, this can be no &s;ecurity again&s;t clande&s;tine fraud. Here the religion of an oath is nece&s;&s;ary, to re&s;train the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from tho&s;e &s;ecret <HI>mal-practices,</HI> which, however injurious to the public, cannot be legally detected. The &s;ecurity of life and property depends, in a great mea|&s;ure, upon oaths The innocent cannot be ab&s;olved, nor the guilty puni&s;hed without them. In the mo&s;t impor|tant judicial proceedings, the verdict ultimately re&s;ts upon their validity. Take away the u&s;e o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the&s;e religious affirma|tions, and our courts of judicature mu&s;t cea&s;e, or be almo&s;t entirely u&s;ele&s;s. In a word civil government can by no means be carried on without them. If oaths be thus nece&s;&s;ary to the admini&s;tration of government, religion mu&s;t be &s;o; for where there is no religion, there can be no oath. Take away the belief of a deity, a providence and future &s;tate, and there is an end of all oaths at once. In every oath a deity is invoked, as a witne&s;s and avenger, if we deviate from the truth. The athei&s;t, therefore, cannot be bound by it. He who believes there is no providence or future &s;tate, can be in no dread of puni&s;hment, either in this or a coming world, if he can only elude human judicatures. The great|e&s;t free thinker, or mo&s;t abandoned pro&s;tigate in our coun|try, would place very little dependence on the oath of one who believes there is neither God nor devil, heaven nor hell. Civil laws do indeed hold out a &s;evere puni&s;hment to deter men from perjury; but as it is one of tho&s;e crimes, of which a per&s;on can &s;eldom be legally convicted, &s;uch laws &s;trike but little terror, and are of very little &s;ervice. The perjured villain may repeat his crime an hundred times with|out any danger from human laws. If therefore, the laws of religion have no hold upon him, his oath is perfectly in&s;ig|nificant, e&s;pecially, where he is under temptation to depart from the truth. We may therefore venture to affirm, that the obligation of oaths is properly founded on religion; and that whatever weight we allow them above a &s;imple affirma|tion, ari&s;es from a &s;uppo&s;ition, that the <HI>deponent</HI> believes there is a God. the <HI>rewarder</HI> of truth and the <HI>avenger</HI> of
<PB N="22" REF="021418_0021_0FB3EE8CA5B41D68">
perjury, to whom he makes a &s;olemn appeal. This &s;ingle con&s;ideration, were there no other arguments, is &s;ufficient to evince the utility, and even the nece&s;&s;ity of religion to civil &s;ociety. For if government cannot be carried on without the u&s;e of oaths, and the validity of the&s;e depend upon religi|on, the con&s;equence is unavoidable, that civil &s;ociety cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without religion. We proceed to the &s;econd head of argument.</P>
<P>In order to &s;how the influence of the chri&s;tian religion on civil &s;ociety, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider&mdash;the doctrines it teaches&mdash;the worp&s;hip it enjoins&mdash;and the precepts it in|culcates. The two fir&s;t, &s;hall be treated briefly; the la&s;t requires a more ample di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">I. Of the doctrines which chri&s;tianity teaches.</P>
<P>Under this head it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to treat all the doctrines of our religion, but only tho&s;e which more imme|diately and directly tend to the benefit of &s;ociety. Such are tho&s;e concerning the nature of the deity, his providence, and a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e &s;acred writings which contain our religion, we have &s;uch a repre&s;entation of the nature and attributes of the great fir&s;t cau&s;e, as gives us the mo&s;t grand, noble and worthy conceptions of him. The divine character as there drawn, is &s;uited to in&s;pire ideas at once the mo&s;t augu&s;t and awful, the mo&s;t venerable and lovely. His irre&s;tible power, inflexible ju&s;tice and tremendous maje&s;ty; his infi|nite knowledge and immaculate purity, tend to fill us with the mo&s;t profound awe and reverence; to deter us from every thing that may provoke him, and con&s;equently to re&s;train us from every kind of immorality. The&s;e perfec|tions of the deity leave the impenitent and per&s;i&s;ting rebel no hope of e&s;caping the righteous vengeance of heaven. His diffu&s;ive benevolence, the riches of his goodne&s;s, the extent of his mercy, his patience and readine&s;s to pardon the repent|ing and returning &s;inner, are calculated to in&s;pire us with &s;entiments of love and gratitude, encourage us to renounce our vicious practices, and hope in his mercy. In a word, the due con&s;ideration of his attributes, as repre&s;ented in our
<PB N="23" REF="021418_0022_0FB3EE8EF91EC998">
religion, nece&s;&s;arily tends to re&s;train us from all vice, and excite us to walk in the paths of piety and virtue; and con|&s;equently to promote our happine&s;s as &s;ocial beings.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, even by tho&s;e who are inclined to think mo&s;t favourably of the ancient Heathens, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they generally entertained very gro&s;s and unworthy notions of their deities; and &s;uch as plainly tended to corrupt their morals, and encourage them in an indulgence of the &s;en&s;ual pa&s;&s;ions, very pernicious to civil &s;ociety. Their Gods, as the poet well expre&s;&s;es it, were
<Q><L>"Gods partial, changeful, pa&s;&s;ionate, unju&s;t,</L>
<L>"Who&s;e attributes were rage, revenge or lu&s;t."</L></Q></P>
<P>The amorous intrigues, the rapes, quarrels, thefts, &amp;c. for which they were celebrated, are ju&s;tly reckoned &s;canda|lous among mortal men. There was &s;carcely any vice, the practice of which was not countenanced by &s;ome of their deities, male or female. Indeed when we con&s;ider the im|moralities a&s;cribed to the gods of the Heathens, it is &s;urpri|&s;ing they were not more corrupt and di&s;&s;olute in their man|ners. There mu&s;t have been &s;ome powerful antidote in their civil in&s;titutions, which counteracted the influence of religious errors &s;o de&s;tructive of all morality. The idea which chri&s;tianity gives us of the infinite purity of that God whom we wor&s;hip, has a quite contrary tendency. In a word, the perfections of the deity held up to view in divine revelation are &s;uch, that the &s;erious con&s;ideration and devout contemplation of them, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fill us with an abhorrence of all impurity and vice of every kind. The more nearly we re&s;emble him, and the more perfectly we imitate him, the more virtuous we are, and the more di&s;po&s;ed to di&s;charge all the &s;ocial duties.</P>
<P>The doctrines, which chri&s;tianity teaches concerning the divine providence, give us the mo&s;t exalted conceptions of the deity. They are perfectly con&s;onant to, and indeed the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of, his attributes. What a &s;ublime idea does it give us of the great Jehovah, when we con&s;ider him as "ruling in the army of heaven, and among&s;t the inhabitants of this lower world;" exerci&s;ing an ab&s;olute
<PB N="24" REF="021418_0023_0FB3EE9076337530">
&s;upreme and univer&s;al dominion over all his creatures; &s;u&s;taining them by his power, directing them by his wi&s;dom, and &s;upplying them by his bounty? The God whom we are taught to wor&s;hip, is no local deity like tho&s;e of the Heathens, pre&s;iding over this or that portion of nature; the guardian of this or that particular city or country, inhabit|ing this or that particular river, grove or mountain. He fills the va&s;t and complicated machine of the univer&s;e, touches every &s;pring, moves every wheel, and adju&s;ts every motion. <HI>He</HI> is the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">untain not only of being, but of all operation; the &s;ource of all that beauty, order and harmony which are diffu&s;ed over the wide creation, and fill the atten|tive beholder with &s;uch inexpre&s;&s;ible delight. His provi|dence extends to the lea&s;t as well as the greate&s;t of his works. None of his creatures, however in&s;ignificant, e&s;cape his notice: he regards them all with an equal and impartial eye. They are all the objects of his parental care, all the &s;ubjects of his governing power and wi&s;dom. With what beauty and empha&s;is does the in&s;pired poet &s;et forth the exuberant goodne&s;s of the creator, in the ample provi&s;ion he makes for the various tribes of animals which inhabit this &s;pacious earth? "The lord is good to all; and his tender mercies are over all his works. The eyes of all wait upon thee, and thou give&s;t them their meat in due &s;ea&s;on. Thou opene&s;t thy hand and &s;atisfie&s;t the de&s;ire of every living thing." But although his benificence is extended to all his creatures, tho&s;e who devote them&s;elves to his &s;ervice are the objects of his peculiar care. "The young lions may lack and &s;uffer hunger; but they that &s;eek the Lord &s;hall not want any good thing. Their bread &s;hall be given them, their water &s;hall be &s;ure." He who "feeds the young ravens that cry and clothes the gra&s;s of the field," will much more give his own &s;ervants food to eat and raiment to put on.</P>

He looks up to the bounty of his heavenly father, who, with a benignant hand, pours out the ble&s;&s;ings of his providence.

Di&s;contentment with our pre&s;ent condition, envy of wealth and power, and an immoderate fondne&s;s of change, are the &s;ource of innumera|ble evils in &s;ociety. At lea&s;t, it is certain they were &s;o in the republic of Rome, which was continually embroiled by the fierce di&s;putes between the Patricians and the Plebeans. And, if I mi&s;take not, much of the pre&s;ent unea&s;ine&s;s, &s;trife, and political contention in South Carolina, may be traced to the &s;ame &s;ource. If every citizen, with a chri&s;tian tem|per, would acquie&s;ce in that wi&s;e plan of providence, which ordains a certain &s;ubordination of rank and office in the political body; and con&s;ider that in this very thing the beauty, order, and even the excellence of &s;ociety, very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch con&s;i&s;ts, we would not have &s;o many factious and turbulent &s;pirits among&s;t us.

Would men become better members of &s;ociety, if all the &s;entiments of religion, which as a great polititian ob&s;erves, "are perhaps the only motive of hone&s;|ty in the greate&s;t part of mankind," were utterly aboli&s;hed? It hath been often ob&s;erved, that the&s;e &s;age unbelievers, who think them&s;elves too knowing to be carried away with the religious tales of a future &s;tate, are well enough plea&s;ed, that the vulgar &s;hould think there is &s;ome truth in them.

<P N="2">II. Of the wor&s;hip which chri&s;tianity enjoins.</P>
<P>That wor&s;hip which the chri&s;tian religion requires, is pure, &s;imple, &s;piritual, and perfectly conformable to the nature of its object. God is a &s;pirit, and therefore we are command|ed to "wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth." A &s;upreme and unfeigned love, a &s;incere and ardent gratitude, a &s;olemn awe and reverence, an humble confidence and entire re&s;ig|nation to his will, are the leading di&s;po&s;itions he requires in his wor&s;hippers. The &s;upreme excellence of his nature, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ran&s;cendent glory of his attributes, which far &s;urpa&s;s the mo&s;t exalted conceptions of men and angels, render him the pro|per object of our &s;upreme love. His overflowing bounty, the riches of his grace, the number and greatne&s;s of his mer|cies, demand our highe&s;t and warme&s;t gratitude. His awful glory and tremendous maje&s;ty call for holy fear and dread. His power, wi&s;dom, truth and ju&s;tice, &s;hould in&s;pire us with confidence, and lead us to acquie&s;ce with ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n all his righteous di&s;pen&s;ations. In the proper exerci&s;e of the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, con&s;i&s;ts that internal wor&s;hip which our religion enjoins. The external part con&s;i&s;ts in the outward expre&s;&s;ions of the&s;e inward di&s;po&s;itions by &s;uch words, actions and at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itudes as are mo&s;t proper to convey the &s;entiments of the heart. And our religion teaches us that the&s;e outward expre&s;&s;ions are no further acceptable to the deity than as they are connected with, and flow from
<PB N="35" REF="021418_0034_0FB3EEA0ED53F160">
tho&s;e internal di&s;po&s;itions which he requires. To "draw near to God with our lips, when our hearts are far from him," is hypocritical and odious in his &s;ight. To exhibit outward expre&s;&s;ions of love, reverence, gratitude, &amp;c. where there is nothing of the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions at heart, is only a &s;olemn farce, a piece of profane mockery; and &s;o far from plea&s;ing God, it is an abomination to him. He requires "truth in the inward parts." A pure, &s;incere, humble, and upright heart is the object of his highe&s;t approbation. If this be wanting, nothing el&s;e can be acceptable. All the e&s;&s;ential parts of chri&s;tian wor&s;hip are appointed by God him&s;elf, who be&s;t knows what is agreeable to his own nature, and &s;uited to our condition. They all tend to &s;ugge&s;t &s;piritual ideas, to detach the mind from objects of &s;en&s;e, and fix it on the im|portant realities of an invi&s;ible world. Among &s;ome deno|minations of chri&s;tians indeed, much external &s;how, many pompous rites and ceremonies, much &s;olemn farce and mummery, have been introduced into their religious wor|&s;hip. But the&s;e ought to be con&s;idered as mere human inventions, contrary to the primitive &s;implicity, and oppo&s;ite to the genuine &s;pirit and de&s;ign of chri&s;tian wor&s;hip, as in|&s;tituted by its author. The&s;e additaments, which like &s;o many excre&s;cences, mar the comeline&s;s and de&s;troy the &s;im|plicity of our religious wor&s;hip, are to be placed to the account of &s;uper&s;tition, which is ever apt to mingle it&s;elf with religion.</P>
<P>The religious wor&s;hip of a people, e&s;pecially the public part of it, will always have a con&s;iderable influence on their morals; and this influence will be good or bad according to the nature of their wor&s;hip. If that be pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, rational and agreeable to the nature of a holy being, it will lead to purity of morals, and therefore promote the happine&s;s of civil &s;ocie|ty. If the contrary, the effect will be directly oppo&s;ite. In the public wor&s;hip which genuine chri&s;tianity pre&s;cribes, every part is calculated to in&s;pire us with an aver&s;ion from vice, and a love of piety and virtue Our prayers, when a&s;&s;embled for public wor&s;hip, are a &s;olemn addre&s;s to that pure and immaculate being, who is the author of life and

While the mini&s;ters of our religion pur&s;ue the original de&s;ign of their in&s;titution, and live and preach as chri&s;tianity requires, their public in&s;tructions and &s;olemn admonitions will always tend to facilitate the de&s;igns of a wi&s;e and &s;alutary policy.

to the &s;ervice of God, by a life of piety and virtue. The Euchari&s;t is a commemoration of the &s;tupendous and unpa|ralleled love of God, in giving his &s;on to redeem our &s;inful race, to re&s;tore us from the ruins of our fall, and open the gates of the heavenly paradi&s;e. In this memorial of the &s;ufferings and death of our compa&s;&s;ionate Redeemer, we have the mo&s;t &s;triking di&s;play of the immaculate holine&s;s of God, and of his infinite oppo&s;ition to &s;in, which required &s;o co&s;tly a &s;acrifice. Here too, we oblige our&s;elves in the mo&s;t &s;olemn and explicit manner, to depart from all iniquity, and lead a holy life, by practi&s;ing piety towards God, as well as ju&s;tice and charity towards our fellow-men. Pliny tells us, that the primitive chri&s;tians u&s;ed to meet together, and bind them&s;elves by a &s;olemn oath (&s;acramento) "that they would not &s;teal, nor rob, nor be guilty of a breach of faith." This might have taught him, that chri&s;tianity was at lea&s;t favor|able to <HI>morals,</HI> and ought to have &s;heathed the per&s;ecuting &s;word of civil government. What can be more proper than this holy in&s;titution, to keep alive a &s;en&s;e of religion in the hearts of men; to root out from their minds all hatred and malice, and unite them in the bonds of love and friend&s;hip?</P>
<P>If an affecting view of the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing and unmerit|ed love, exhibited to our &s;en&s;es by the mo&s;t apt and &s;ignifi|cant &s;ymbols, can excite our love; if the riche&s;t ble&s;&s;ings which heaven could be&s;tow, can awaken our gratitude; &s;urely this holy fea&s;t upon the &s;acrifice of our Redeemer, mu&s;t have a powerful influence upon our lives. If the mo&s;t &s;olemn vows and oaths of fidelity to the great captain of our &s;alva|tion, have any force to bind chri&s;tians, the &s;acred engage|ments we come under by taking this &s;acrament, mu&s;t be a &s;trong &s;ecurity again&s;t the allurements of vice, and a conti|nual excitement to per&s;evere in the paths of virtue. Thus every part of chri&s;tian wor&s;hip, as pre&s;cribed by its divine author, leads to, and enforces purity of manners, and &s;erves to re&s;train men from tho&s;e vicious cour&s;es, which, in the natural &s;tream of things, tend to the de&s;truction of civil government.

in this re&s;pect would appear in the &s;tronge&s;t light. It cannot be denied, that the wor&s;hip of tho&s;e heathen nations who have been mo&s;t renowned for their civil policy, not only in many in&s;tances encouraged, but even con&s;i&s;ted in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t immoralities. This was the ca&s;e among the Egyp|tians, Greeks, and Romans. To &s;ay nothing of the human &s;acrifices which they offered up to appeale their angry deities, what were their <HI>my&s;teries,</HI> but <HI>my&s;teries</HI> of iniquity? In the celebration of the&s;e, the foule&s;t crimes were perpetrated, and the mo&s;t flagitious lu&s;ts indulged, under the covert of darkne&s;s. Bacchus, Venus and Cupid, were wor&s;hiped with the mo&s;t impure and abominable rights. Female pro&s;titu|tion, lu&s;t, drunkenne&s;s, and the wilde&s;t riot, were not only concomitants, but e&s;&s;ential con&s;tituents of their wor&s;hip. The civil magi&s;trates of Rome were fully &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ary tendency of the&s;e enormities to corrupt the morals of the people, and of the political evils which flowed from the&s;e polluted &s;ources. Accordingly, they endeavoured to obviate them, by enacting &s;evere laws for the regulation of the my&s;teries; but finding the&s;e in&s;ufficient, the <HI>Orgia</HI> were finally aboli&s;hed throughout Italy by a decree of the &s;enate, A. U. 568. The Eleu&s;inian my&s;teries, which were reckoned more pure, continued till the reign of the emperor Theodo&s;ius, and then underwent the fate of all human in&s;ti|tutions.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am not ignorant, that &s;ome chri&s;tian writers have &s;uppo&s;ed the heathen my&s;teries, particularly the Eleu&s;inian, to have been originally pure, and de&s;igned by the civil magi&s;trate to correct the pernicious influ|ence of the commonly received mythology on the morals of the people. The fathers condemn them as impure, and immoral in their original in&s;titution; and in&s;i&s;t much on the &s;hocking enormities practi&s;ed in them under the veil of night.

<P><HI>Whatever objections</HI> have been made by dei&s;ts again&s;t the doctrines and wor&s;hip of chri&s;tianity, the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and ingenious of them, have very little to urge again&s;t its moral precepts. On a careful and candid examination, they are found &s;o conformable to the great principles of na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ural reli|gion, that they who have not renounced all religion, both natural and revealed, are con&s;trained to acknowledge their excellence. Rea&s;on and experience both &s;erve to convince us, that the &s;trict ob&s;ervance of them, tends to exalt our na|tures and promote our happine&s;s in the pre&s;ent life. All who are not blind to the beauty and utility of virtue, and its tendency to promote the happine&s;s of &s;ociety, mu&s;t acknow|ledge the importance of chri&s;tian morality. If we a little con&s;ider the &s;everal duties which chri&s;tianity enjoins upon us as &s;ocial creatures, we w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll immediately &s;ee how exactly its precepts fall in w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he ends of government, and how well they are &s;uited to co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">operate with, and facilitate the execution of, wi&s;e and whole&s;ome laws. "The morality of the Go&s;pel," &s;aid the dying Monte&s;queiu, "is a mo&s;t excel|lent thing, and the mo&s;t valuable pre&s;ent that could po&s;&s;ibly have been received by man from his creator"</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be &s;aid, that tho&s;e duties which we owe to each other in the &s;ocial &s;tate are dictated by rea&s;on, and &s;o a part of natural religion; and that chri&s;tianity is therefore of little con&s;equence in this re&s;pect; I will not now di&s;pute the fact, but mu&s;t take the liberty to deny the con&s;equence. Though it &s;hould be granted, that chri&s;tianity neither en|joins nor forbids any thing in moral practice, which natural religion does not enjoin or forbid, it will not hence follow that chri&s;tianity is u&s;ele&s;s. Tho&s;e moral duties which our religion inculcates, are indeed agreeable to rea&s;on, and
<PB N="41" REF="021418_0040_0FB3EEA9EA2B0370">
appear to have a fitne&s;s and propriety in them, and on this account may be reckoned a part of natural religion. But who will dare to affirm that the whole &s;y&s;tem of what we call NATURAL RELIGION, could be rea&s;oned out by the mo&s;t enlightened of mortals, without, any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from divine revelation? And even &s;uppo&s;ing this were po&s;&s;ible, there is no ground to believe, that men in general could make the di&s;covery in this way; or if they could, there is not the lea&s;t probability that they would, con&s;idering their negligence and inattention to &s;uch things. Many among&s;t us are ignorant of &s;ome very important duties of natural religion, though revealed to them, and repeatedly inculcated upon them in their bibles. What mu&s;t we then &s;uppo&s;e would be the ca&s;e, if they were left to inve&s;tigate the&s;e duties by an intricate chain of rea&s;oning? It ought al&s;o to be con&s;idered, that Chri&s;tianity is a very important confirmation of natural religion. Here the conclu&s;ions of rea&s;on are corroborated, and rendered more certain by the additional evidence of divine te&s;timony. Tho&s;e miracles and prophecies which were de&s;igned as a proof of the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, are al&s;o a proof of the truth of natural religion. Thus the dictates of natural light are ratified, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, by the &s;tamp of divine authority, and their truth proclaimed by a voice from heaven. Hence we &s;ee that the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of morals is to be con&s;idered, not barely as the deductions of rea&s;on; but the deductions of rea&s;on confirmed by an expre&s;s revelation from God him&s;elf, and inculcated by his authoritative command; and therefore ought to have greater weight with us than the meer conclu&s;ions of fallible rea&s;on. Suppo&s;e a man able to demon&s;trate, which I &s;uppo&s;e may be done, though perhaps by few, that it is his duty to love his enemies, would he not reckon it a great confir|mation of his conclu&s;ion, if at the end of his demon&s;tration, he &s;hould di&s;cover, that this duty was expre&s;sly revealed and peremptorily commanded by God him&s;elf? Would not his rea&s;onings be much more &s;atisfactory to him&s;elf, and more likely to influence his practice? It hath been often urged, and therefore we &s;hall not here in&s;i&s;t upon it, that the mo&s;t
<PB N="42" REF="021418_0041_0FB3EEAB64FF7750">
enlightened of the heathens were much in the dark with re&s;pect to many of tho&s;e moral duties; the rea&s;onablene&s;s and propriety of which are evident to tho&s;e in&s;tructed by Chri&s;tianity. And it is worthy of remark, that the&s;e very heathens were, perhaps, more indebted to divine revelation than &s;ome of its enemies are willing to admit. Were this a proper place to enter into &s;uch a &s;ubject, it might be made more than probable, that had they been left to meer rea&s;on and the light of nature, their morals would have been much more deficient than they are. But our profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign will not allow us to enlarge upon the&s;e things. The few hints thrown out may &s;uffice to &s;how, that it does not in the lea&s;t derogate from the importance of Chri&s;tianity in the view we are now con&s;idering it, that its moral precepts coincide with the great <HI>Pandect</HI> of Nature. On the contrary, when the&s;e precepts thus conformable to the light of nature, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e con|firmed by the authority of heaven, urged upon us by our rightful &s;overeign, and enforced by the mo&s;t expre&s;s and awful &s;anctions, it is rea&s;onable to conclude, that they will have a much greater influence on our practice, than if they were the &s;ole re&s;ult of rea&s;on, which all know is liable to err.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be expected, that in treating this part of my &s;ubject, I &s;hould draw a compari&s;on between Chri&s;tian and heathen morality; but as this hath been often done, and the &s;uperior excellence of Chri&s;tian morals fully &s;hown, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with treating &s;ome of tho&s;e moral pre|cepts of Chri&s;tianity, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h appear to have the mo&s;t direct influence on &s;ociety.

<P>Chri&s;tianity is beyond compari&s;on the pure&s;t and mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;y&s;tem of benevolence which hath ever been pub|li&s;hed to the world. It every where breathes the &s;pirit of love, and inculcates the laws of kindne&s;s and humanity. That good will towards men which it requires is univer&s;al,
<PB N="43" REF="021418_0042_0FB3EEACE63EA640">
and embraces the whole human race. It is not confined to the narrow circle of friends and relations, but extends even to enemies. The precept of our Savior which requires us to love, do good to, and pray for our enemies, is peculiar to Chri&s;tianity; at lea&s;t we do not find it &s;o expre&s;sly taught, and particularly enforced, by any other religion. The Jews entertained an implacable hatred again&s;t all tho&s;e who were not of their own nation and religion. Their male-volence to all but their own brethren, was &s;o remarkable, that the heathens have taken notice of it. "Their fidelity," &s;ays Tacitu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, "is inviolable, and their pity ready towards each other; but to all others they bear a mortal hatred." The apo&s;tle Paul, a more impartial judge, gives them the &s;ame character. "They plea&s;e not God, and are contrary to all men." They even thought them&s;elves at liberty to indulge their malice again&s;t private enemies of their own nation. Though the precepts of their law, rightly under|&s;tood, were far from allowing &s;uch a malevolent di&s;po&s;ition, it is certain that by their corrupt interpretations, they drew this inference from them. And it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the god-like duty of loving our enemies, was not &s;o clearly revealed, and &s;o expre&s;sly inculcated, under the Jewi&s;h, as under the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation. Here we have it enforced by the noble&s;t of all con&s;iderations, namely, the re&s;emblance it gives us to the deity, who indi&s;criminately &s;howers down the common ble&s;&s;ings of his providence, both on his friends and enemies. The bloody and vindictive &s;pirit of the Mahometan religion is well known. Grotius has empha|tically characterized it in a few words. "Mahometis re|ligio in armis nata, nihil &s;pirat ni&s;i arma, armis propagatur." "The religion of Mahomet originated in arms, breathes nothing but arms, is propagated by arms." The civil in&s;ti|tutions of the Greeks, particularly tho&s;e of Sparta, were principally directed to war. Conque&s;t, rapine, blood-&s;hed, triumph, were their chief aim. To rob and plunder their neighbors was &s;o far from being reckoned infamous among them, that they gloried in it. And it is worthy of ob&s;er|vation, that the&s;e in&s;titutions were admired by their phi|lo&s;ophers,
<PB N="44" REF="021418_0043_0FB3EEAE684EE0D0">
and approved by their oracles. Ari&s;totle is not a&s;hamed to affirm, "That war with barbarians is natural." The Romans were little better than the robbers and butchers of the world. Their fame, wealth, power, and grandeur, aro&s;e principally from the conque&s;t and &s;poils of tho&s;e whom they made or found their enemies. They were &s;o infamous for their unju&s;t wars and public robberies, that Cicero him&s;elf &s;cruples not to declare, "that if every one had his own, they mu&s;t return to their old cottages." In a word, the many in&s;tances of flagrant inju&s;tice and cruelty publicly approved both by the Greeks and Romans, &s;how, that they had &s;care any idea of that univer&s;al benevolence, that humane, gentle and peaceable di&s;po&s;ition, which the precepts of our religion &s;o &s;trongly recommend and enforce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that Chri&s;tian nations have, in many in&s;tances, &s;hown too little regard to the &s;pirit of their religion, in the wars they have commenced and carried on. They have often been cruel and unju&s;t, contrary to that humane and peaceable di&s;po&s;ition enjoined by the go&s;pel. It cannot, however, be denied, that Chri&s;tianity hath had a con&s;iderable influence on men, and laid them under great re&s;traints in this re&s;pect. The hi&s;tory of Europe evidently &s;hows how much it tends to check the ferocity and &s;often the rugged manners of tho&s;e nations who embrace it. If I mi&s;take not, it produced a remarkable change on the Roman empire. We do not find the &s;ame cruel and &s;anguinary di&s;|po&s;ition prevailing after it became Chri&s;tian. War is dive&s;ted of half its horrors by the mild and gentle &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity.</NOTE>. War was their trade, and their religion re&s;trained them from nothing which they imagined might extend their empire and increa&s;e their power. Some of the heathen morali&s;ts have told us that faith is to be kept with an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">emy; and that injuries &s;hould be forgiven, on the repentance and acknowledgement of the offender; but I do not recollect that one of them before the Chri&s;tian aera, requires men to love tho&s;e who are in a &s;tate of actual enmity with them. To do good to &s;uch, to pray for them, and promote their happine&s;s, is a pitch of philanthropy, to which Chri&s;tianity alone teaches us to a&s;pire. How much &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition tends to the peace and happine&s;s of men in the &s;ocial &s;tate, is obvious at fir&s;t view. Love is the great cement of &s;ociety, and a principal bond of union among its members. As
<PB N="45" REF="021418_0044_0FB3EEAFEA9CFF20">
malice, hatred, envy, and all the inimical pa&s;&s;ions, naturally tend to di&s;unite men, and de&s;troy that concord, which is the greate&s;t &s;trength and &s;ecurity of government; &s;o mutual love &s;weetly and powerfully attracts and binds them to each other. He who loves his neighbor as him&s;elf, and &s;incerely de&s;ires his happine&s;s, needs no other motive to excite him to the mo&s;t exact and careful performance of all the &s;ocial duties. A heart overflowing with benevolence to our fellow-men will be a more powerful re&s;traint from injury, and a &s;tronger excitement to beneficence, than all the terror of civil laws. This noble and generous prin|ciple will operate uniformly and efficaciou&s;ly; and by an internal, &s;ecret impul&s;e, direct and &s;pur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us on to a careful ob&s;ervance of all the laws of kindne&s;s and humanity. Prompted by an ardent wi&s;h to promote the happine&s;s of all around us, we will perform every kind office with a plea&s;ure and facility unknown to a narrow and &s;elfi&s;h mind. We will often forget or over-look our own intere&s;t to oblige a friend, to vindicate the innocent, relieve the di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed and &s;uccour the mi&s;erable. He who is conformed to the temper, governed by the precepts, and influenced by the example of the benevolent Je&s;us, will, like the good Sama|ritan, pour balm even into the wounds of an enemy; will feed him when hungry, cloath him when naked, return him good for evil, and ble&s;&s;ing for cur&s;ing. In a word, that unbounded benevolence which Chri&s;tianity requires, nece&s;|&s;arily leads to the performance of all the duties of charity, ho&s;pitality, gratitude, mercy and compa&s;&s;ion, which we have &s;hown human laws cannot enforce, and which are never|thele&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to the peace and happine&s;s of civil go|vernment.</P>
<P>Let it be further ob&s;erved here, that Chri&s;tianity not only enjoins meekne&s;s and benevolence, but expre&s;sly con|demns a contrary di&s;po&s;ition. A malicious and vindictive temper is directly oppo&s;ite to the precepts of the go&s;pel. Hear the apo&s;tle Paul on this &s;ubject, "Dearly beloved, avenge not your&s;elves, but rather give place unto wrath; for it is written, vengeance is mine; I will repay, &s;aith the

Lord. Therefore, if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thir&s;t, give him drink; for, in &s;o doing, thou &s;halt heap coals of fire upon his head." This is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the precepts and example of his meek and heavenly ma&s;ter, who teaches us to expect forgivene&s;s only, on con|dition that we forgive others. "But if you do not forgive neither will your father, who is in heaven, forgive your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es." The &s;ame precept and example is illu&s;trated and enforced, with incomparable &s;trength and beauty, in the parable of the debtors and creditors, Mat. 18. from the 23d ver&s;e to the clo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Jewi&s;h doctors, by &s;tretching the law of retaliation for per&s;onal injuries beyond its original de&s;ign, gave too much countenance to private revenge. They enjoined it upon men as their duty to in&s;i&s;t upon retaliation; and even went &s;o far as to pronounce it lawful, in many ca&s;es, for the inju|red per&s;on to avenge him&s;elf, provided his revenge did not exceed the due mea&s;ure. This was an evident abu&s;e of the law, which only empowered the judges to give an eye for an eye, or a tooth for a tooth, if the injured party demanded it. Our &s;avior teaches a more excellent morality, and a more heroic pitch of meekne&s;s and patience. "Ye have heard that it hath been &s;aid, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth; but I &s;ay unto you, that you re&s;i&s;t not evil; but who&s;oever &s;hall &s;mite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other al&s;o; and if any man will &s;ue thee at the law and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak al&s;o." Here our Saviour not only condemns the corrupt glo&s;&s;es of the Jewi&s;h Doctors; but, as is plain from the general &s;train of his language, forbids Chri&s;tians &s;ome things which were permitted to the Jews under a more imperfect di&s;pen&s;ation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Tertull.

How favorable this influence is to civil &s;ociety, and how commodiou&s;ly it falls in with the intention of human laws, will appear from the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>Private revenge is utterly repugnant to the principles, di|rectly oppo&s;ite to the nature and end of civil &s;ociety, and there|fore condemned by the laws of all wi&s;ely con&s;tituted and well regulated governments<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The judgement of zeal among the Jews and the law re&s;pecting the avenger of blood, may perhaps be reckoned exceptions. As to the fir&s;t, I am clear, it was not founded on &s;cripture, in that latitude the Jews &s;uppo&s;ed. This I think mu&s;t be evident to any one who reads the account given of it by Philo and Jo&s;ephus. To what execrable purpo&s;es it was applied, appears plain from the many attempts made on the life of our Savior, the &s;toning of Stephen, and the diabolical con&s;piracy again&s;t the apo&s;tle Paul; for in the&s;e and many other in&s;tances which might be mentioned, it appears to me mo&s;t probable, that they proceeded under this pretence. The law concerning apo&s;tates to idolatry, which the Jews tell us was fir&s;t executed by Phineas, gave ri&s;e to the judgment of zeal. But it cannot be made appear from that law, as it lies in &s;crip|ture, that even idolaters were to be put to death without a previous trial: an enquiry was to be in&s;tituted, and witne&s;&s;es &s;ummoned. The ca&s;e of Phineas was extraordinary; and whatever opinion we form of it, could not be de&s;igned by God to authorize every Jew to put to death, without delay, or any form of legal proce&s;s, tho&s;e who did or &s;aid any thing di&s;honorable to his religion. As to the Jewi&s;h law which per|mitted a relation to take vengeance on the man-&s;laver, it was greatly moderated, and the &s;anguinary effects of it guarded again&s;t by the a&s;y|lums appointed for &s;uch as had been guilty of accidental homicide; for the avenger of blood was not at liberty to attack the homicide in his &s;anctuary. The de&s;ign of it was not to encourage men in a vindictive temper; but to in&s;pire them with a horror of blood&s;hed; for by the ri&s;k which they ran from the relations of the &s;lain, and the hard&s;hip of confine|men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the city of refuge, even when innocent, they were taught to be cautious in avoiding every thing that might endanger the li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of a fellow citizen. However, if any one think this an exception to the above general a&s;&s;ertion, I will not ob&s;tinately contend the matter here, for I am ready to allow there are &s;ome exceptions. The laws of Sparta gave the <HI>Ephori</HI> the right of putting per&s;ons to death without a trial. By a law of Solon, a hu&s;band who caught his wife in adultery, was at liberty to &s;lay the adulterer on the &s;pot. In &s;ome governments ma&s;ters and pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nts have been allowed the power of life and death over their &s;laves and children. But whether the&s;e laws were wi&s;e and &s;alutary in any government, is a matter I very much doubt. They are, I think, reprobated by all Chri&s;tian &s;tates.</P>
<P>To prevent objections, I would further ob&s;erve on this &s;ubject, that there are &s;ome extraordinary ca&s;es in which the laws of England admit an extra-judicial remedy, and allow a redre&s;s of injury by the mere act of the party injured. Among the&s;e judge Black&s;tone reckons &s;elf-defence, recaption, abatement of nui&s;ances, di&s;tre&s;s for rent and cattle <HI>damage-fea&s;ant,</HI> with &s;ome others. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is for the prevention rather than redre&s;s of wrong; for if the defender go further than is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for defence and prevention, the law con&s;iders him as an aggre&s;|&s;or. The la&s;t is not &s;o properly redre&s;s as the means of obtaining redre&s;s in a legal way; unle&s;s it be where the <HI>di&s;tre&s;s</HI> is retained for compelling &s;atisfaction. Recaption indeed is, in a proper &s;en&s;e, redre&s;s; and removal of nui&s;ances &s;eems de&s;igned both for redre&s;s and prevention. Yet, even in the&s;e, the per&s;ons aggrieved act under the re&s;traint and direction of law. Recaption mu&s;t be without force or terror; nui&s;ances mu&s;t be removed peaceably and without any riot. But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e and &s;ome other in&s;tances, in which, on account of &s;ome peculiar circum&s;tances, a well regulated &s;ociety may permit a kind of extra|judicial redre&s;s, I have not &s;crupled to affirm in general, that in a &s;tate of civil &s;ociety, men are not at liberty to mini&s;ter redre&s;s to them&s;elves; and I have in&s;i&s;ted the more largely on this, becau&s;e &s;ince the clo&s;e of the war, I find many of my countrymen too much di&s;po&s;ed to take the puni&s;hment of offenders into their own hands&mdash;a mode of proceeding which directly tends to di&s;&s;olve our government, and reduce us to a &s;tate of nature.</P></NOTE>.

<PB N="49" REF="021418_0048_0FB3EEB5E5F75C40">
regulated government the power of judging and puni&s;hing in our ca&s;e is taken from us. Laws are framed to deter|mine the criminality of injuries done by one individual to another, and to fix the kind of puni&s;hment to be inflicted. The&s;e laws are put into the hands of per&s;ons &s;uppo&s;ed to be indifferent, to be carried into execution; and to the&s;e we are to appeal for redre&s;s of injuries. According to the principles of civil &s;ociety therefore, it is criminal to take the puni&s;hment of an offender into our own hands, though we be never &s;o much wronged. The wi&s;dom and nece&s;&s;ity of this plan is obvious. One principal rea&s;on why men cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t in a &s;tate of nature, is their propen&s;ity too highly to re&s;ent, and too &s;everely to puni&s;h, every real or imaginary injury. Men are very improper judges in their own ca&s;e. That pride, that &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and fal&s;e opinion of their own importance, which is natural to them, render them wholly unfit to determine the real demerit of injuries done to them&s;elves. It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for any man entirely to dive&s;t him&s;elf of all partiality in a ca&s;e where he is nearly concerned. Men of the mo&s;t fair and upright minds are generally prejudiced in favor of their own relations and connections; much more then mu&s;t they be partial to them|&s;elves; and this partiality utterly di&s;qualifies them from being proper judges, where they are parties.&mdash; Hence we &s;ee the impropriety of allowing men in a &s;tate of civil &s;ociety to judge in their own ca&s;e, and retali|ate as they may think proper. This is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the common judge con&s;tituted by &s;ociety, and to be done agreeably to certain fixed laws, framed by common con&s;ent, for the redre&s;s of injuries. To this judge therefore, and the&s;e laws, we mu&s;t appeal when we are injured. He, therefore, who takes upon him to retaliate an injury as he thinks fit, and to puni&s;h the offender without &s;uch appeal, is guilty of an outrage on civil government, and &s;tands con|demned by the laws of &s;ociety. The reader will plea&s;e to

ob&s;erve, that we here &s;peak of &s;uch injuries and acts of revenge as human laws can conveniently take notice of and puni&s;h; for there are innumerable in&s;tances of both, which civil &s;ociety, from its natural imper&s;ection, is obliged wholly t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">verlook.

It &s;o bids all tho&s;e acts of revenge which are the proper objects of human laws, and thus affords them that a&s;&s;i&s;tance which they &s;o much need.

Men of a revengeful and malicious di&s;po&s;ition may find a thou&s;and ways to gratify their re&s;entment and ruin their neighbors, without the lea&s;t danger of puni&s;hment from human laws. An innocent man may be robbed of his e&s;tate, and what is much more valuable, of his reputation, without being able to obtain the lea&s;t legal redre&s;s. In a word, infinite mi&s;chief may be done to &s;ociety by deeds of revenge, which the laws of man can neither take cognizance of nor puni&s;h. But Chri&s;tianity forbids all &s;uch acts, con|demns the temper from which they ari&s;e, and refers the puni&s;hment of them to that almighty and omni&s;cient Being, to whom belongeth vengeance.</P>
<P>He who hath felt the power of religion on his heart, and governs his life and temper by the precepts of the go&s;pel, carefully watches again&s;t every emotion of revenge; much more then will he guard again&s;t &s;uffering it to break our in tho&s;e actions which may be injurious to his fellow-citizens, even though he may have the pro&s;pect of e&s;caping with im|punity

from men. He delights in the pro&s;perity, not in the pain and mi&s;ery of others; and feels him&s;elf con&s;trained by an obligation more powerful than all laws, to &s;hun whatever may be hurtful to his neighbor, and detrimental to the public tranquility. When he contemplates the example of the meek and lowly Je&s;us, who, "When he was revi&s;ed, reviled not again;" and who poured our an ardent prayer for his enemies, even when they were &s;hedding his blood; how does it animate him to &s;ubdue his re&s;entment, and crucify every inimical pa&s;&s;ion! He does not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be tran&s;ported with wrath on every &s;light affront; but bears injuries with pat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, conquers by yielding, and &s;hows him&s;elf &s;uperior to his enemies by a meek, humble and forgiving &s;pirit. If, at any time, he &s;ees it ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary for his own &s;ecurity, and the pre&s;ervation of peace and good order in &s;ociety, to re&s;ent injury, he will do it from a &s;en&s;e of duty, and not to gratify a malicious and vindictive temper. He will not attempt to redre&s;s injuries by taking private vengeance on the aggre&s;&s;or; but appeal to the laws for his vindication: and even in this, he will di&s;cover a meek and quiet &s;pirit, which &s;hows, that he is not prompted by a de&s;ire of revenge, but a regard to ju&s;tice and public good. If redre&s;s cannot be obtained in this way, he &s;uffers wrong, and appeals to him who will &s;ooner or later vindicate the innocent and puni&s;h the guilty.</P>
<P>If we were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll thus conformed to the precepts of Chri&s;ti|anity, what a happy &s;ociety would we be! We would not &s;ee &s;uch fierce contentions, &s;o much &s;trife and animo&s;ity, &s;o many in&s;tances of mutual injury and revenge, &s;o much legal wrangling, and &s;o many tedious and expen&s;ive law &s;uits.

be totally aboli&s;hed. I have been often &s;urprized that men who pique them&s;elves on their humanity and politene&s;s, never reflect, that this practice is no refinement of modern times, but was brought into Europe by tho&s;e fierce northern boors, who over-ran the Roman empire. The civilized heathens, the polite Greeks and warlike Romans, were &s;trangers to this ab&s;urd, barbarous cu&s;tom. They reckoned it glorious to die for their country; but never &s;acrificed each other in cold blood to the little punctilios of honor. The prevalence of this practice in Chri&s;tian countries, con|trary to all the laws of religion, as well as rea&s;on and huma|nity, is one of the &s;tronge&s;t proofs of the amazing force of cu&s;tom on the human mind.</P>
<P>To conclude this particular,&mdash;as Chri&s;tianity &s;urpa&s;&s;es all other religions in that meek, gentle and forgiving &s;pirit which it requires: &s;o it mu&s;t be, of all others, the be&s;t adapted to pre&s;erve peace among men, and promote the happine&s;s of civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P N="2">II. That &s;trict regard to ju&s;tice which the precepts of Chri&s;tianity enjoin, is of the greate&s;t importance to civil government.</P>
<P>The practice of ju&s;tice is e&s;&s;ential, not only to the happi|ne&s;s, but to the exi&s;tence of civil &s;ociety. The &s;ocial union cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without &s;ome degree of it. It is the proper, and in a large &s;en&s;e, one might venture to &s;ay, the only object of civil laws. But although human laws are, in a manner, wholly occupied in preventing or puni&s;hing inju&s;|tice, there are innumerable in&s;tances of it, which they can by no means reach. Experience daily teaches us, how ea&s;y it is for men of cra&s;ty and de&s;igning natures to evade the force of laws. The mo&s;t flagrant acts of inju&s;tice may be committed, and the mo&s;t &s;candalous fraud carried on, under umbrage of the be&s;t human laws. An artful villain may rob the widow and the fatherle&s;s, and be guilty of the mo&s;t cruel oppre&s;&s;ions; and yet "&s;o deeply intrench him&s;elf behind the <HI>letter</HI> of the <HI>law,</HI> and &s;o well fortify him&s;elf with <HI>ca&s;es</HI> and <HI>reports,</HI> that there is no coming at him." It is needle&s;s to enlarge here. Every one who will give him&s;elf
<PB N="53" REF="021418_0052_0FB3EEBBE605C3C0">
the trouble of thinking on this &s;ubject, mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that the commerce of men in a &s;tate of &s;ocie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, admits of &s;o many different modifications, and that &s;o many unexpected circum&s;tances often ari&s;e, from the various methods of acqui|ring and transferring property, that no laws can be framed &s;o as to comprehend every ca&s;e which may occur. This &s;hows the imperfection of civil laws, even with re&s;pect to tho&s;e things which are mo&s;t in their power; and at the &s;ame time demon&s;trates the importance of religion to enforce the ob&s;ervance of &s;trict ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The precepts of Chri&s;tianity require the &s;tricte&s;t regard to ju&s;tice in all its branches. All tho&s;e acts of fraud and inju&s;tice which are prohibited by the laws of &s;ociety, are al&s;o prohibited by the precepts of our religion. The Chri&s;tian, therefore, who is influenced by tho&s;e precepts, is under a two-fold obligation to re&s;train him from all acts of inju&s;tice: one ari&s;ing from the laws of his country, the other from the laws of his religion; and the latter not only tends to facilitate the execution of the former, but often prevents the nece&s;&s;ity of their exertion. He who is bound by the obligation of religion, &s;uperadded to that of human laws, is more likely to practi&s;e the rules of ju&s;tice, than he who is influenced only by a regard to tho&s;e laws.</P>
<P>But this is not all: Our religion goes further, and extends to all tho&s;e acts of inju&s;tice, which are beyond the reach of human laws, and cannot be puni&s;hed by them. That the&s;e are numerous, even where ju&s;tice is mo&s;t carefully and im|partially admini&s;tered, is matter of univer&s;al experience. And that they are injurious to civil government, by creating the bittere&s;t animo&s;ities among fellow-citizens; &s;tirring up &s;trife, malice, hatred, and &s;o de&s;troying that mutual love and confidence, which are nece&s;&s;ary to hold men together in the &s;ocial &s;tate, is too plain to need any proof. As far, therefore, as Chri&s;tianity re&s;trains men from the&s;e acts of inju&s;tice, &s;o far it mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">end to the benefit of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The precepts of Chri&s;tianity, which re&s;pect the practice of ju&s;tice, are given in the mo&s;t univer&s;al terms&mdash;"What|&s;oever things are ju&s;t;" the&s;e the Chri&s;tian is commanded to

practi&s;e. "All things, what&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do unto you, do ye even &s;o to them." This precept of our Savior, on account of its excellence, is called the <HI>golden rule.</HI> It is conci&s;e and ea&s;ily remembered, plain and ea&s;ily under&s;tood; comprehen&s;ive, and <HI>mutatis mutandis,</HI> applies to all men, at all times, and in all circum&s;tances. It is a portable di|rectory, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, which every man may carry in his own brea&s;t. It is an unan&s;werable appeal to the feelings of every man, and carries immediate conviction to the mind; enforcing and awakening, by the authority of heaven, tho&s;e natural &s;entiments of ju&s;tice, which are en|graven on our hearts. He who believes the divine autho|rity, and duly feels the force of the&s;e and &s;uch-like pre|cepts of our religion, will pay a &s;acred regard to the practice of ju&s;tice in its various branches. He will be hone&s;t and upright in all his dealings, faithful to his tru&s;t, and give to every man his due. Where the laws are &s;ilent, he finds a rule of right and &s;tandard of equity in his own brea&s;t, which points out the fair line of conduct he ought to pur&s;ue. He will not impo&s;e upon the ignorance and &s;implicity, or take advantage of, the open and un&s;u&s;pecting temper of his neighbor. He does nor lie in wait to &s;eize every open door, which the imperfection of civil laws may give him, to invade the property of others. It is not enough for him that he can evade the force of civil laws, and e&s;cape puni&s;hment from men, while the laws of religion and his own con&s;cience co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">emn him of inju&s;tice. His fair, open and upright mind, abhors all tho&s;e little low acts of chicane and knavery, which they who regulate their conduct only by human laws &s;o often employ, to over-reach, rob and ruin the hone&s;t and the unwary. He has a higher &s;tandard, and a more accu|rate rule of action, which re&s;trains him from all unfair and fraudulent dealings, all di&s;hone&s;t &s;hifts and unequitable &s;ub|terfuges If &s;uch a temper as this were generally prevalent among&s;t us, what a de&s;irable effect would it have!

If the precepts of Chri&s;tianity had that influence upon us, which their excellence naturally leads us to expect, there would be little need of that order of men, who are now &s;o generally, I will not &s;ay how ju&s;tly, the objects of envy and execration among us. Were I permitted to &s;peak my mind freely on this &s;ubject, I would &s;ay, that generally &s;peaking, people ought to blame them&s;elves for &s;uffering the&s;e men to drain them of their ca&s;h. If they were of that temper which becometh Chri&s;tians, they would not &s;o frequently fall into contentions, or take &s;ome other method of compromi&s;ing them, which might be more cheap and eligible. They might refer the deci&s;ion of them to a few hone&s;t and impar|tial neighbors, who are acquainted with the merits of the cau&s;e; which they are often obliged to do, after they have &s;pent their time, and emptied their pur&s;es by a tedious &s;uit at law.</P>
<P>But I have not room here to point out the many happy con&s;equences which would flow from that &s;trict regard to the practice of ju&s;tice, which our religion inculcates. Leav|ing the judicious reader to trace them in his own mind, we proceed to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations concerning that religious adherence to truth, which the precepts of Chri&s;tianity enjoin. This is an important branch of ju&s;tice, and very properly comes in here.</P>
<P>How excellent &s;oever the rules which the heathen mo|rali&s;ts have laid down for the practice of ju&s;tice, they appear to have been very defective in this particular. It is not ea&s;y indeed to reconcile them to each other, or even to them&s;elves, on this point. Plato in &s;ome places condemns lying; in others, he &s;eems plainly to approve of it. But the mo&s;t general opinion, as far as I can find from their writings, was, that lies are admi&s;&s;ible, where there is a pro&s;pect of advantage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"He may lie," &s;ays Plato, "who knows how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> in a fit &s;ea&s;on."

<P>"There is nothing comely in truth," &s;ays Maximus Tyrius, "but when it is profitable. And &s;ometimes a lie profits and truth hurts men." Plato and the Sto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es framed a kind of Je&s;uitical di&s;tinction on this head, making a difference between lying in words and in the &s;oul, or with a&s;&s;ent to a fal&s;houd The wi&s;e man was admitted to lie craftily and with a pro&s;pect of gain; but not to embrace fal&s;hood through igno|rance.

<PB N="56" REF="021418_0055_0FB3EEC0665DFDB0">
philo&s;ophers held it as an undoubted maxim, that it was lawful, and even a duty, to lie for the public good. Cicero is &s;o clear in this, upon the authority of Plato, that he pronounces it <HI>ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as,</HI> a horrid wickedne&s;s, not to do it. This conclu&s;ion ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e from another equally fal&s;e, namely, that <HI>truth and general utility do not coincide.</HI></P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity grants no &s;uch licence, but condemns every &s;pecies of fal&s;hood, and inculcates the mo&s;t &s;acred regard to truth in all circum&s;tances what&s;oever. "Lie not one to another. Putting away lying, &s;peak every man the truth with his neighbor." I &s;uppo&s;e it will be readily acknow|ledged, that a &s;trict adherence to truth, e&s;pecially in &s;uch promi&s;es and declarations as re&s;pect the intere&s;t of others, is of no &s;mall con&s;equence to &s;ociety. It certainly tends to beget and maintain that mutual confidence which hath been always reckoned one principal bond of the &s;ocial union.&mdash; This is evident from the pernicious effects which we daily experience from an oppo&s;ite conduct. Nothing hath a greater tendency to plant di&s;tru&s;t and &s;u&s;picion in the hearts of men, de&s;troy mutual love, and &s;tir up malignant pa&s;|&s;ions among them&punc; than the practice of fal&s;hood and di&s;&s;i|mulation. It is therefore of the greate&s;t importance in &s;ociety, that men &s;hould be laid under all po&s;&s;ible re&s;traints in this re&s;pect. If they were left at liberty to depart from the truth in &s;ome particular ca&s;es, and on &s;ome extraordi|nary occa&s;ions, for their own advantage, or even for the good of others, what would be the con&s;equence? Would it not nece&s;&s;arily tend to annihilate all faith in every &s;uch ca&s;e? If men univer&s;ally thought it lawful to lie in certain given circum&s;tances, no one would be credited in tho&s;e circum&s;tances; becau&s;e he would not be con&s;idered, as
<PB N="57" REF="021418_0056_0FB3EEC1E747E880">
any obligation to &s;peak the truth. All faith in the decla|rations of others depends on the &s;uppo&s;ition of a general obligation to truth. Take away this &s;uppo&s;ition, and there is at once an end of all confidence. So that lying, in all &s;uch circum&s;tances, would defeat its own purpo&s;e, and would be no advantage, either to our&s;elves or others. It ought therefore to be reckoned a peculiar excellence of our reli|gion, that its precepts afford not the lea&s;t encouragement to &s;uppo&s;e it allowable, in any ca&s;e what&s;oever, to &s;werve from the truth. Had Chri&s;tianity granted any &s;uch permi&s;&s;ion, it might be made an objection again&s;t it, as giving counte|nance to a practice detrimental to civil government.</P>
<P>If the religious ob&s;ervance of truth, in our ordinary com|munications, be of &s;o much importance in &s;ociety, much more mu&s;t this be the ca&s;e in our &s;olemn oaths. Here al&s;o the excellence of Chri&s;tian morality is apparent. "O|ther laws," &s;aith the learned Grotius, "forbid perjury, but this requires us to ab&s;tain even from an oath without nece&s;|&s;ity; and &s;o to cultivate truth in all our words, that an oath may not be required of us." The precepts of Chri&s;tianity are &s;o &s;trict in this particular, that &s;ome Chri&s;tians of weak and &s;crupulous minds, have &s;uppo&s;ed they prohibit all oaths. But this is a very erroneous conclu&s;ion. It might be ea&s;ily &s;hown, were it thought nece&s;&s;ary, that they contain no &s;uch prohibition. Tho&s;e who rai&s;e &s;uch &s;cruples, little con&s;ider how much they wrong Chri&s;tianity. It would be a &s;ad reflection on our religion, if it condemned the u&s;e of &s;olemn oaths, which are &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the admini&s;tration of government, and one of the be&s;t means for the &s;peedy deci&s;ion of controver|&s;ies, which tend to the de&s;truction of &s;ociety. But though Chri&s;ti|anity does not forbid us to &s;wear in a &s;olemn manner, when legally called to it, it enjoins great caution in this matter; and teaches us not to be precipitate in making &s;uch a &s;olemn appeal, where the importance of the ca&s;e does not evidently demand it. Thus the precepts of our religion conduct us &s;afely between two extremes, guarding us on the one &s;ide from perjury, and on the other from that &s;uper&s;titious timi|dity which would lead us to omit a duty that we owe to &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="021418_0057_0FB3EEC3645F0CE8">Perjury is, in it&s;elf, a crime &s;o horrid, and at the &s;ame time &s;o pernicious to government, that it ought to be guarded again&s;t with the utmo&s;t care. It is of great mo|ment therefore, that men &s;hould be re&s;trained from every thing that tends this way. Lying, profane &s;wearing, and even a needle&s;s and too frequent u&s;e of lawful oaths, have this tendency: and as all the&s;e are prohibited by the precepts of Chri&s;tianity, tho&s;e precepts mu&s;t be one of the greate&s;t &s;ecurities again&s;t perjury; and of con&s;equence &s;ingularly u&s;eful to government. A little attention to human nature may convince us that a needle&s;s repetition of oaths, tends to le&s;&s;en their &s;olemnity.

No good rea&s;on, I think, can be given for the u&s;ual practice of &s;wearing them previou&s;ly to every trial. It appears to me a needle&s;s repetition of oaths, which nece&s;&s;arily takes off from their &s;olemnity. Would it not be much more eligible to qualify our juries once for all, at the commencement of the &s;e&s;&s;ion? I take the liberty al&s;o to ob&s;erve here, that oaths are not admini&s;tered in our courts with that &s;olemnity which their nature requires. The clerk, with a vacant face and carele&s;s air, chymes over the words of the oath, without any empha&s;is of expre&s;&s;ion, or &s;olemnity of manner, &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion. The &s;ame marks of negligence and inattention may be often ob&s;erved in the countenance of the deponent.

One great cau&s;e of this I take to be a too frequent and unnece&s;&s;ary u&s;e of oaths, which tends to turn them into meer farces. The&s;e ob&s;ervations may perhaps be thought trifling by &s;ome; but to a thinking per&s;on, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">othing will appear &s;o which &s;erves to guard again&s;t perjury.</NOTE> As to the ab&s;urd and impious practice of PROFANE SWEARING, which &s;o much prevails

among&s;t us, it evidently tends to bani&s;h all fear of God from the minds of men, and of con&s;equence leads directly to perjury. The lea&s;t reflection may convince us of this. It is rea&s;onable to expect, that an impious wretch who is daily invoking the vengeance of Heaven on him&s;elf and others, and who confirms every petty a&s;&s;everation, whether true or fal&s;e, by the addition of the <HI>&s;acred name;</HI> is it rea&s;onable, I &s;ay, to expect that &s;uch an one &s;hould have a proper &s;en&s;e of the &s;olemnity of an oath, or any &s;uitable dread of perjury? Mu&s;t it not be allowed that, other things being equal, the te&s;timony of a man who makes con&s;cience of taking God's name in vain, has much greater weight, and de&s;erves more credit? It is, in a manner, &s;elf-evident, that an habitual profanation of God's holy name by impious oaths and cur&s;es, mu&s;t tend to le&s;&s;en that awe and reverence of him, which is one of the &s;tronge&s;t guards again&s;t perjury, and con&s;equently mu&s;t be in a high degree injurious to civil &s;ociety. Hence the pro|priety of re&s;training and puni&s;hing it by civil laws. If this practice were only an offence again&s;t God, the puni&s;h|ment of it &s;hould be referred to him alone; but as it is not only a daring impiety, but al&s;o productive of effects baneful to the &s;tate, and detrimental to public good, the civil magi&s;trate ought to take notice of and re&s;train it by civil penalties. Indeed, every man who wi&s;hes well to his country &s;hould make it his bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;countenance this vice, which is now become &s;o common among&s;t us. It is the <HI>opprobrium</HI> of South Carolina; and together with our other national crimes, likely to call down the vengeance of Hea|ven upon us. If gentlemen, who&s;e wealth and rank give them re&s;pectability, would con&s;pire, and by their influence and example, di&s;countenance this <HI>dialect</HI> of <HI>devils,</HI> it might, in a great mea&s;ure, be bani&s;hed from among us. But while men of the fir&s;t figure, who&s;e commanding manners have &s;uch a mighty influence on all the inferior ranks, lead the way; and tho&s;e who have a principal hand in making and executing our laws, are too often chargeable with a breach of them by the practice of common &s;wearing, we are not to expect much effect from the operation of our laws again&s;t

If a ju&s;tice of the peace, in compliance with his oath, &s;hould attempt to puni&s;h profane &s;wearing, he would, in many parts of our &s;tate, make him&s;elf ridiculous. It is with regret I mention the&s;e things. But they are as true, as they are lamentable; and in the mind of every thoughtful man, who wi&s;hes well to religion and his country, portend no &s;mall evils. In truth, if the principles and precepts of religion are not &s;ufficient to re&s;train men from fal&s;hood, profanity, perjury, and other enormities of this nature, we cannot expect much aid from civil laws, which, though ex|ecuted ever &s;o faithfully, can &s;eldom puni&s;h crimes of this &s;ort. However, if men have &s;o far thrown off all fear of God, that no &s;en&s;e of religion can deter them from this da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing impiety, let them, at lea&s;t, &s;how &s;ome re&s;pect to rea&s;on, and relinqui&s;h a cu&s;tom which brings them neither honor nor profit, and is attended with the mo&s;t pernicious con&s;equences to civil &s;ociety.

<P N="3">III. That temperance and moderation which the pre|cepts of Chri&s;tianity require, are of great importance to civil &s;ociety, and evidently tend to promote public good.</P>
<P>It is a tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e ob&s;ervation, that &s;ociety, by cultivating the arts of life, greatly increa&s;es our wants; and con&s;equently inflames our appetites in proportion. The wants of nature are few&punc; and ea&s;ily &s;upplied; but tho&s;e created by &s;ociety, which may be called artificial, are without bounds or num|ber. In the &s;ocial &s;tate, therefore, where mens wants are &s;o numerous, and the de&s;ire of &s;atisfying them &s;o highly excited, temperance and moderation mu&s;t be peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary. It is too plain to need any proof, that by far the greater part of tho&s;e evils which di&s;turb &s;ociety, flow from the inordinate appetites and ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions of men. An immoderate de&s;ire of tho&s;e things which have, at lea&s;t,
<PB N="61" REF="021418_0060_0FB3EEC7E83D73E0">
the appearance of <HI>natural good,</HI> and which are generally thought nece&s;&s;ary to our happine&s;s in poli&s;hed life, is the &s;ource of numberle&s;s civil crimes. A too eager and violent pur&s;uit of wealth, honor, power and &s;en&s;ual gratification, prompts men to rapine, violence, cruelty, oppre&s;&s;ion, and every &s;pecies of inju&s;tice. Hence flows a long tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of evils, which bring a con&s;umption on the body poli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, de&s;troy public happine&s;s, and overturn kingdoms and empires. The principal de&s;ign, therefore, of civil laws, is to check the fury of exorbitant appetite, re&s;train the unruly pa&s;&s;ions, and keep them within the bounds which rea&s;on and common good require. How imperfectly they an&s;wer this de&s;ign, and how much they need the aid of religion for this pur|po&s;e, the experience of all ages is a &s;ufficient proof. All the re&s;traint which civil government can lay upon the pa&s;&s;ions, is by prohibiting and pun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hing &s;ome of their mo&s;t dangerous effects: but religion, by enjoining a due govern|ment of all our appetites, teaches us to eradicate from our minds the very cau&s;e of tho&s;e effects. <HI>That</HI> only lops off &s;ome of the mo&s;t noxious branches; <HI>this</HI> &s;trikes at the root: <HI>that</HI> only counteracts or diverts the &s;treams; <HI>this</HI> dries up the fountain.</P>
<P>Temperance is a very comprehen&s;ive virtue; and, as enjoined by Chri&s;tianity, not only requires a certain mode|ration in <HI>eating</HI> and <HI>drinking;</HI> but in all tho&s;e affections, pur&s;uits and enjoyments, which are liable to become faulty by exce&s;s. He who profe&s;&s;es to govern his life by the pre|cepts of the go&s;pel, mu&s;t be temperate in all things. His moderation mu&s;t be con&s;picuous to all, and vi&s;ible in the whole of his deportment. Thus exhorts the in&s;pired Apo&s;|tle: "Let your moderation be known to all men." But though our religion &s;o &s;trictly prohibits all kinds of intem|perance, it allows us a free u&s;e of the gifts of Providence, and deprives us of no plea&s;ure or enjoyment, which is not injurious to our&s;elves, or prejudicial to others. The Stoic Philo&s;ophers, who have &s;aid &s;o many excellent things on temperance, and who&s;e morality, in the opinion of Jerome, came neare&s;t to the Chri&s;tian, ab&s;urdly taught that the
<PB N="62" REF="021418_0061_0FB3EEC966A64980">
pa&s;&s;ions ought to be wholly eradicated. According to them, all the tender emotions of love and pity, all the &s;weet &s;en&s;ibilities, and melting affections of nature, mu&s;t be ex|tingui&s;hed, as unworthy of a philo&s;opher. Thus, before men can become wi&s;e and virtuous, they mu&s;t dive&s;t them|&s;elves of all the tender feelings of humanity, and be trans|formed into &s;tatues. How much more excellent and rea|&s;onable the precepts of Chri&s;tianity! They require us not to eradicate, but to govern and regulate our pa&s;&s;ions, in &s;uch a manner, as is mo&s;t worthy of the dignity, and mo&s;t conducive to the perfection and felicity of rational creatures. They point out the objects on which we ought to fix them, the degree in which they &s;hould be indulged, and &s;how their due balance and &s;ubordination. Were it po&s;&s;ible for men to bring them&s;elves to that total in&s;en&s;ibility, which was the pride and boa&s;t of the Stoic, it would deprive them of a great part of that happine&s;s which they derive from a reciprocal exchange of kind affections and mutual offices of love, which con&s;titutes one of the principal bonds, as well as chief felicities of &s;ocial life. How well &s;oever the doctrines of the Stoics in general were calculated to form the good citizen, the <HI>dogma</HI> we are now &s;peaking of, not to mention other parodoxes which they held, was far from being favorable to &s;ociety. Had the <HI>retortion</HI> of nature permitted their much de&s;ired <HI>apathy,</HI> they would have made very aukward members of the community. Rea&s;on is too weak to rou&s;e men to that vigor and activity, which are nece&s;&s;ary for the di&s;charge of the &s;ocial duties. The impul&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ions is therefore requi&s;ite, and they are implanted in us for this purpo&s;e. The ve&s;&s;el which is &s;tripped of its &s;ails, though the rudder be ever &s;o good, is not likely to reach the port. What fails are to a &s;hip, pa&s;&s;ions are to the man. Let them be under the conduct of rea&s;on; give them the due tone; keep them within the bounds of mode|ration which Chri&s;tianity pre&s;cribes, and they will invariably tend to &s;ocial happine&s;s. Thus tempered and re&s;trained, they are a principal &s;ource of &s;ocial enjoyment, give the nece&s;&s;ary &s;pring and energy to civil life, and impel us only
<PB N="63" REF="021418_0062_0FB3EECAE7624680">
to &s;uch actions and pur&s;uits, as &s;erve at once to promote both private and public good. Hence we &s;ee how far the morality of the go&s;pel &s;urpa&s;&s;es that of the <HI>Porch,</HI> the mo&s;t celebrated, and indeed the mo&s;t perfect, to be found among the heathen &s;ages. It is more conformable to the con&s;titution of our nature, better adapted to our pre&s;ent condition, and hath a greater tendency to promote the ends of civil government.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e it will be readily acknowledged, that drunken|ne&s;s, gluttony and lawle&s;s lu&s;t, not to mention many other evil con&s;equences which flow from them, enervate the body, deba&s;e the mind, and tend to unfit us for the di&s;charge of tho&s;e duties which we owe to &s;ociety. As far, therefore, as the precepts of Chri&s;tianity re&s;train men from the&s;e vices, &s;o far they mu&s;t be u&s;eful to government. We have no laws, at lea&s;t none which operate, for the puni&s;hment of drunkenne&s;s, though it is detrimental to the &s;tate, by intro|ducing di&s;ea&s;es, de&s;troying the health and vigor of its inha|bitants, and reducing thou&s;ands of families to want and mi&s;ery. As to tho&s;e again&s;t uncleanne&s;s, they are &s;o &s;eldom carried into execution, that we might almo&s;t as well be without them. If, therefore, men are under no re&s;traint from religion, they are left at full liberty to abandon them|&s;elves to tho&s;e vicious cour&s;es A regard to credit and re|putation, or a dread of infamy, cannot re&s;train men from &s;uch practices, where they are &s;o common as not to be di&s;|graceful; and where the number of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors exempts them from cen&s;ure or reproach. How far this is the ca&s;e in many parts of our &s;tate, I leave others to &s;ay; and only remark, that the abominable mixture of colors in our capital, as well as in &s;ome other places, and the &s;cenes of lewdne&s;s, riot and debauchery, common in town and coun|try, are too plain a proof of our di&s;&s;olute manners, and a melancholy pre&s;age of approaching ruin. I am &s;en&s;ible we have no &s;mall number among&s;t us, and tho&s;e too of high rank and con&s;iderable political influence, who make light of the&s;e crimes; but it is not the le&s;s true, that they are at|tended with effects highly dangerous to government, and open a wide door to a group of political evils, which menace

de&s;truction to our country. Whatever men of loo&s;e morals may think of the&s;e things, to tho&s;e who con&s;ider their pernicious tendency, they are &s;ufficiently alarming, and clea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly indicate the nece&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y of a reformation. All that <HI>can,</HI> ought to be done by civil laws for this purpo&s;e; but I am per&s;uaded that nothing but a &s;en&s;e of religion, and a regard to the precepts of Chri&s;tianity, will prove effectual.</P>
<P>But, not to dwell any longer on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e in&s;tances of intem|perance, which are a reproach to rea&s;on, and transform men into brutes; we proceed to ob&s;erve, that the moderation which Chri&s;tianity enjoins in the pur&s;uit of wealth greatly tends to the advantage of &s;ociety. Avarice is in&s;atiable, and productive of infinite mi&s;chief in government. The mo&s;t numerous and flagrant acts of inju&s;tice, and the mo&s;t atrocious crimes, even murder it&s;elf, may be often traced to an immoderate de&s;ire of riches, as their &s;ource. Experience confirms the a&s;&s;ertion of the Apo&s;tle, "The love of money is the root of all evil." As an immoderate love of wealth, therefore, is one principal &s;ource of tho&s;e crimes which plainly tend to the &s;ubver&s;ion of &s;ociety, it is of great mo|ment that it &s;hould be curbed; and whatever hath a tendency to keep it in proper bounds, mu&s;t be &s;ub&s;ervient to public good. Chri&s;tianity gives us &s;uch a &s;triking picture of the empty and un&s;atisfying, as well as dangerous, nature of riches, as cannot fail to have a mighty influence on the minds of all tho&s;e who have a cordial belief of its truth. He who has a full conviction that "a man's life con&s;i&s;teth not in the abundance of the things which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth," and pays a due regard to tho&s;e divine precepts, which forbid us to &s;et our hearts on earthly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, will be moderate in his pur&s;uit of riches. Sen&s;ible of their uncertain and en|&s;naring nature, he will be under little temptation to u&s;e fraud or violence in order to acquire them.

God hath given him, and that he mu&s;t be accountable for the u&s;e he makes of his e&s;tate, he is careful not to con&s;ume it in luxury, nor make it the fuel of lu&s;t. He keeps the golden mean between the mi&s;er and the prodigal; not hoarding up u&s;ele&s;sly, nor &s;pending profu&s;ely, but contributing according to his ability in promoting &s;uch de&s;igns as are u&s;eful to the public; feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, or in&s;tructing the ignorant. Such is the temper of the man formed upon the precepts of the go&s;pel: and how admirably it is adapted to promote the peace and happine&s;s of &s;ociety, is too plain to need illu&s;tration. If this Chri&s;tian moderation were more prevalent among us, how many acts of extortion, oppre&s;&s;ion, fraud and rapine; how much &s;trife and contention, envy and emulation, would it prevent? It would be a much &s;tronger &s;ecurity again&s;t the&s;e and a thou&s;and other irregularities, than the dread of human laws, though framed with the highe&s;t wi&s;dom, and executed with the greate&s;t punctuality.</P>
<P>But further; Chri&s;tianity is not more favorable to govern|ment by moderating our love of riches, than by enjoining an hone&s;t care and diligence as the means of acquiring a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Idlene&s;s, &s;loth and negligence, in our &s;everal occupations, are as expre&s;sly condemned by our religion, as a too eager and violent pur&s;uit of the world. Thus we are guarded again&s;t two extremes equally perni|cious to &s;ociety. Extreme poverty and want &s;timulate men to theft, robbery and many other di&s;hone&s;t practices, highly injurious to the community. Tho&s;e who are extremely poor, and tho&s;e who are extremely rich, are generally the mo&s;t vicious: and though their vices may be of different kinds, they are equally oppo&s;ite to public good. The <HI>mean</HI> in life is mo&s;t de&s;irable: and this is generally the re&s;ult of that moderate care and diligence which the precepts of Chri&s;tianity require. They who are placed between the extremes of want and abundance, are generally the be&s;t members of &s;ociety, mo&s;t happy them&s;elves, and contribute mo&s;t to the happine&s;s of others. Over-grown e&s;tates are &s;eldom acquired or enjoyed, in a manner wholly con&s;i&s;tent with Chri&s;tianity. They are often a cur&s;e and incumbrance

This, as I take it, is a pretty accurate definition of <HI>luxury,</HI> which is undoubt|edly vicious, and as contrary to the precepts of our religion, as it is pernicious to civil &s;ociety.

to the detriment of civil &s;ociety. All who con&s;ider the fatal effects and dangerous tendency of luxury, will acknow|ledge, that Chri&s;tianity in this view is of great importance to the &s;tate. In all rich and flouri&s;hing republics, <HI>&s;umptu|ary laws</HI> have been generally thought nece&s;&s;ary; but they &s;eldom fully an&s;wer the end de&s;igned by them. A &s;trict regard to that moderation which Chri&s;tianity requires, would have much greater influence, and lay a more effectual curb on luxury, than the mo&s;t rigorous &s;umptuary laws. How much we need the influence of religion in this par|ticular, is too plain to admit of a doubt. If luxury be an "abu&s;e of the gifts of Providence," there is certainly a great deal of it among us. Our progre&s;s in this vice &s;ince the clo&s;e of the war, has been &s;o amazingly rapid, that I could not believe it, were I not convinced by my own &s;en&s;es. The nature of our government, the lo&s;&s;es we have &s;u&s;tained, and the debts we have contracted, in the cour&s;e of a bloody and de&s;olating war, call for the &s;evere&s;t oeconomy and the mo&s;t exact frugality; and yet &s;uch is the profu&s;ion, prodi|gality and extravagance, which generally prevail among our citizens, that a &s;agacious politician would be alom&s;t tempted to pronounce us in the la&s;t &s;tage of political cor|ruption.

At a certain period of the Roman republic, it was common for a bold tribune, who aimed at popularity, to propo&s;e a total abolition of all debts: and if the ruinous &s;cheme of credit be continued as in times pa&s;t, I &s;hall not be at all &s;urprized, if &s;uch a motion &s;hould be made in our a&s;&s;embly.

<P>If religion be of that importance to the &s;tate which we have been endeavoring to prove, it certainly merits the public attention; and tho&s;e who are engaged in the arduous and important ta&s;k of government, ought to avail them&s;elves of its force, to give vigour to the operation, and facilitate the execution of wi&s;e and whole&s;ome laws. The mo&s;t in|telligent of my readers will perhaps blame me for taking &s;o much pains to prove what very few either doubt or deny. To this I can only &s;ay, that how well &s;oever the truths in|&s;i&s;ted upon are known and believed, it is clear they have been too much over-looked: and if what hath been offered may &s;erve, in any mea&s;ure, to draw the public attention to this important object, I &s;hall not regret the labor I have be&s;towed. All our politicians will readily grant, that the morality of the people is a matter of no &s;mall moment, e&s;|pecially in republics; but many of them &s;eem to forget the in&s;eparable connection between religion and morality. They appear not &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible, how impo&s;&s;ible it is to pre|&s;erve purity of morals among the people at large, even in the lax political &s;en&s;e of that expre&s;&s;ion, without a &s;en&s;e of religion. A complete morality, independent of all religion, is merely vi&s;ionary, and never, in fact exi&s;ted. It is the dream of theory &s;pinners, and the unmeaning language of pidling profligate politicians. The nece&s;&s;ity of morality to the commonwealth being once granted, the nece&s;&s;ity of

They may without any inva&s;ion of the rights of con&s;cience, take mea&s;ures for the in&s;truction of &s;ubjects in the important doctrines and pre|cepts of Chri&s;tianity, which &s;o evidently tend to the &s;afety of the body politic. If mea&s;ures of this nature were ever nece&s;&s;ay in any government, they are &s;o in South-Carolina. The greater part of our citizens are ignorant of religion to to a degree which is equally a&s;toni&s;hing and deplorable. Whole &s;ettlements may be found, where but very few can &s;o much as read the &s;criptures. There are &s;ome hundreds, one might venture to &s;ay, &s;ome thou&s;ands of young per&s;ons growing up among us, almo&s;t as ignorant of the God who made them, as the Hottentots of Africa. In&s;tructed in no one duty which they owe, either to God or man, is it rea|&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, they will ever make good citizens or u&s;eful members of the community? Brought up, as many of them are, in the mo&s;t abject poverty and the mo&s;t crimi|nal idlene&s;s, and taught no kind of employment by which they can procure an hone&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, mu&s;t we not expect they will prove pe&s;ts of &s;ociety? Re&s;trained by no obligations of virtue or religion, &s;timulated by want, and &s;harpened by keen nece&s;&s;ity, they are expert only in &s;tealing, and in time, will, no doubt, make dextrous hor&s;e-thieves. Do we not find in fact, that tho&s;e &s;ettlements, where idlene&s;s, ignorance and irreligion mo&s;t prevail, are at once the &s;eminaries and a&s;ylums of public offenders? Here the laws are not exe|cuted at all, or with the greate&s;t difficulty; and in &s;ome of them the people are &s;carcely one degree above downright

barbari&s;m. Is there any other method to bring them out of this &s;tate, and make them hone&s;t and worthy citizens, but by diffu&s;ing knowledge among them, and in&s;tructing their children in the principles of religion and morality? And is not this an object worthy of the public attention? A&s;ide com|pa&s;&s;ion to the &s;ouls of men, which &s;hould &s;trongly operate with tho&s;e who profe&s;s them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, our own peace and happine&s;s, as a political body, evidently require it. If parents either cannot, or will not provide for, and educate their children, in a proper manner, it would certainly be ju&s;t and expedient, to take them out of their hands, and have them brought up in &s;uch a way, as might afford &s;ome rational pro&s;pect of their being u&s;eful to &s;ociety. This would be, at once, an act of charity and compa&s;&s;ion to the children, and highly beneficial to the state.</P>
<P>One principal rea&s;on why ignorance is &s;o prevalent among our citizens, is the want of public teachers, properly qua|lified to in&s;truct them in the doctrines and precepts of Chri&s;|tianity. If our country were properly &s;upplied with able, pious and faithful mini&s;ters, it would doubtle&s;s be one of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing means to diffu&s;e religious knowledge, &s;tem the torrent of vice, and promote the practice of piety and virtue. Without attempting to prove, I make no &s;cru|ple boldly to affirm, that the preaching of the go&s;pel in its genuine purity and &s;implicity, is the mo&s;t powerful mean to reform the manners of men. If &s;o, is it rea&s;onable to expect, that a reformation will take place, while this mean is neglected? Can we rationally hope, that a &s;en&s;e of reli|gion will be kept alive in the hearts of men, when there are none among&s;t them, who&s;e &s;tated bu&s;ine&s;s it is to explain its doctrines and inculcate its precepts? It is the appoint|ment of the great Author of our religion, that there &s;hould be &s;uch an order of men. And when they conduct them&s;elves with that gravity and dignity which become their office; when they are zealous, active and diligent in preaching, in&s;tructing, reproving, and, by their holy and exemplary lives, give weight and influence to their doctrines, we are authorized to expect the mo&s;t &s;alutary effects from their
<PB N="76" REF="021418_0075_0FB3EEDE665C4448">
mini&s;trations. Had we a &s;ufficient number of &s;uch clergy|men fixed in the different parts of our &s;tate, it would be a &s;ingular ble&s;&s;ing, and greatly facilitate the execution of our laws. Were this the ca&s;e, we might expect, that our citizens would be more generally enlightened in the nature and end of government, and the &s;everal duties they owe to &s;ociety, more &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity of order in the body politic, and of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to all tho&s;e civil ordinances which are &s;ub&s;ervient to the common good. Virtue would be more countenanced and promoted, vice more di&s;couraged, and a &s;tronger curb laid on the licentious and profane.</P>
<P>But how are &s;uch clergymen to be obtained? how &s;up|ported? "Hoc opus, hic labor." We do not take upon us to dictate. We point out the influence of religion on civil &s;ociety, the need we have of that influence, and give one rea&s;on why we are &s;o deficient in the knowledge and practice of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>It may, however, be ob&s;erved, that the mo&s;t probable means of furni&s;hing our country with u&s;eful pa&s;tors, is to promote learning, and educate pious and promi&s;ing youth among our&s;elves. The encouragement of literature on this, and many other accounts, &s;hould be con&s;idered as a very capital object of public attention in South-Carolina. It is neither for our honor, nor our intere&s;t, to have our learned departments filled up with foreigners. How far this is the ca&s;e, none can be ignorant. To &s;ay nothing of the inundation of Phy&s;icians from Great-Britain, Ireland and the northern &s;tates, we have not &s;o much as one learned clergyman among&s;t us, who is a native of South-Carolina. Of the few mini&s;ters who are &s;ettled in our &s;tate, the greater number are illiterate. Some of the&s;e are no doubt u&s;eful: but if their learning equalled their piety and zeal, they would certainly be much more &s;o; and religion would be more &s;olid and rational, than it is at pre&s;ent in many places. The mo&s;t able and judicious of the&s;e illiterate preachers, are &s;en&s;ible of the di&s;advantages they labour under, and lament their want of a liberal education; but at the &s;ame time, urge the difficulty of obtaining it, and the deplorable
<PB N="77" REF="021418_0076_0FB3EEDFE646EB70">
ignorance which prevails, as their excu&s;e for a&s;&s;uming the character of public in&s;tructors. And in truth, con&s;idering the &s;tate of learning among us, and the &s;carcity of religious teachers, this argument appears to me to have no &s;mall weight. If &s;uch preachers were capable of nothing further than to inculcate the doctrine of a future &s;tate, and pre&s;s upon men the nece&s;&s;ity of moral and &s;ocial duties, even this would be of no &s;mall utility to the &s;tate. It requires but little know|ledge to in&s;truct many of our citizens, and they who can only read the &s;criptures in their own language, may do much good in many parts of our country, by teaching the gro&s;sly ignorant, and reforming the notoriou&s;ly vicious. After all, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that they would be much more u&s;eful, were their knowledge more enlarged, and their education more liberal: and if a method could be fallen upon to make learning cheap and convenient, this would be more generally the ca&s;e. This is the point at which we ought to aim, and the mo&s;t &s;pirited efforts &s;hould be made for this purpo&s;e. While learning continues &s;o expen&s;ive, as it is at pre&s;ent among&s;t us, we cannot expect it to become general. The more opulent only will be able to give their &s;ons a liberal education; and there is little probability, that any con&s;iderable number of the&s;e will devote them&s;elves to the &s;ervice of the church<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As our form of government tends to an ari&s;tocracy, if learning were properly diffu&s;ed, it might, I think, &s;erve to counteract this tendency in &s;ome mea&s;ure. In a republic, offices of high tru&s;t and preferment ought to be rotatory, and diffu&s;ed as much as po&s;&s;ible. If learning be confined to a few of the mo&s;t wealthy, it will naturally tend to keep the&s;e offices in a few hands; the con&s;equence of which will be, that the rich and learned <HI>few</HI> will rule and oppre&s;s the poor and ignorant <HI>many.</HI> Every proud politic <HI>ari&s;tocrat</HI> knows, that if he can keep a people in poverty and ignorance, he can <HI>ride</HI> them at plea&s;ure, and will therefore &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;e every attempt of the legi&s;lature to put learning upon &s;uch a footing, that it may be acquired by tho&s;e of lower rank.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is the opinion of many, that the be&s;t way to &s;upply our&s;elves with clergymen, is to encourage their emigration from Great-Britain and Ireland. In our provincial &s;tate this plan was not altogether ineligible; but, in our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, I think there are &s;trong political objections

again&s;t it. An important revolution hath taken place. We are now an independent people, and have rejected the govern|ment of Great-Britain, as equally odious and intolerable, Tho&s;e men, whom it is propo&s;ed to bring in among&s;t us, are the &s;ubjects of king George III; and in ju&s;tice to them, it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, loyal &s;ubjects. Their education has a deep tincture of the government under which they have lived. They have been brought up with that predilection for monarchy, and that &s;uper&s;titious reverence for royalty, and the high-&s;ounding title of <HI>king,</HI> which is u&s;ual in regal governments. Can we rea&s;onably expect that men of this de&s;cription will generally have the &s;ame &s;trong attachment to our country the &s;ame high re&s;pect to our republican forms of government, as tho&s;e who are educated among us, and im|bibe the principles and &s;pirit of freedom and independence with the milk of their mothers? Have we any ground to hope, that they will &s;how the &s;ame zeal for the &s;upport and pro&s;perity of our free con&s;titutions, as the natives of America, who&s;e fathers have &s;uffered &s;o much for their e&s;tabli&s;hment?</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e gentlemen, who have ventured to cro&s;s the water &s;ince the the e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace, and are now in que&s;t of &s;ettlements among&s;t us, make no &s;cruple to declare their hatred and contempt of our government; and expre&s;s their great regret that the revolution ever took place. "Better," &s;ay they, "we had &s;till continued our connection with England; we would have now been a much more happy people." That they &s;hould hold &s;uch language, is not all &s;urpri&s;ing. It is the natural re&s;ult of their education, and the prejudices which hang about them in favor of a kingly government: and how plainly it tends to embroil our government, and facilitate our return to a &s;ervile de|pendence on Great-Britain, is &s;ufficiently obvious. Others, who have more prudence, and better know how to accom|modate them&s;elves to their intere&s;t, are &s;ilent on the matter. Few, if any of them, di&s;cover that cordial approbation of our government, or intere&s;t them&s;elves in our welfare with that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">r which we find in true republicans. Indeed, it would be un&s;ea&s;onable to expect it. Suppo&s;e 40 or 50 of

the&s;e foreign clergymen &s;ettled in different parts of our &s;tate; &s;uppo&s;e them to be as re&s;pectable as men of their function ought to be, and to have that influence on the minds of their people, which is nece&s;&s;ary to render them u&s;eful, it is ea&s;y, I think, to &s;ee what might be the con&s;equence to the &s;tate. How weak &s;oever this objection may appear to &s;ome, it &s;hows at lea&s;t, that in a political view, it is mo&s;t eligible to have a clergy well affected to our government: and the mo&s;t probable method of obtaining &s;uch, is to pro|mote learning in our own country.</P>
<P>As to the method of &s;upporting our clergy, it &s;eems to be the mo&s;t general opinion, e&s;pecially among tho&s;e for|merly called Di&s;&s;enters, that it &s;hould be by the free con|tributions of the people. And indeed no other mode ap|pears more eligible, where people are generally &s;en&s;ible of the utility of religion, and di&s;po&s;ed to contribute according to their abilities for its &s;upport. It ought however to be con&s;idered, that in many parts of our &s;tate, the people are &s;o totally &s;unk in vice and ignorance, that they have &s;carcely any idea of the nece&s;&s;ity and importance of religion; and con&s;equently will not exert them&s;elves, either to obtain or &s;upport public teachers. And yet, the&s;e are the people who mo&s;t need in&s;truction. What is to be done in this ca&s;e? Can nothing, con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice and the rights of con|&s;cience, be attempted by civil authority to oblige per&s;ons of this de&s;cription to contribute to the &s;upport of religion? If religion be of that utility to government, which we have been endeavoring to &s;how, it will certainly follow, that every citizen reaps advantage from it in a political view; and therefore ought to contribute for its &s;upport. Nor is there any more inju&s;tice in obliging him to this by law, than in obliging him to pay a public tax for the &s;upport of go|vernment: becau&s;e religion is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to govern|ment; and were it not for this, he would be deprived of tho&s;e benefits which he enjoys from the &s;ocial union. We may therefore venture to affirm, that every member of civil &s;ociety ought, and may be ju&s;tly obliged by law, to pay &s;omething for the &s;upport of religion. Nor will there be
<PB N="80" REF="021418_0079_0FB3EEE467D1EC88">
any ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint on the &s;core of con&s;cience, pro|vided every one be left at liberty to pay to whatever deno|mination of the clergy he plea&s;es. We do not take upon us to affirm that &s;uch a law ought to be made: &s;ome diffi|culties would probably ari&s;e in the execution of it. We only &s;how, that &s;uch a law would have nothing in it unju&s;t, were it thought expedient. If properly executed, it would, I think, have at lea&s;t one good effect; it would excite people to make &s;ome efforts to obtain fixed clergymen among them&s;elves. It is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, that avarice on the one hand, and contempt of religion on the other, will rake up many objections again&s;t this plan: but as we only ju&s;t throw out the hint, and are far from being &s;anguine on the matter, we &s;hall not, at pre&s;ent, take any notice of the&s;e. There is, however, one objection which, with me, has no &s;mall weight, and which, no doubt, will operate &s;trongly with all tho&s;e who wi&s;h well to religion. If the law pro|po&s;ed could be &s;o framed and executed, as to afford &s;upport and encouragement only to the pious, &s;ober and diligent of all denominations, it would certainly be of &s;ingular &s;ervice to the &s;tate; but the great danger is, that tho&s;e of the oppo|&s;ite character would probably be &s;upported and encouraged. Could matters be &s;o managed, as to guard again&s;t this, I &s;hould not he&s;itate a moment to pronounce &s;uch a law highly expedient and &s;alutary. This may perhaps be difficult, and could I think it ab&s;olutely impracticable, I would be one of the la&s;t men in South-Carolina to propo&s;e, or con&s;ent to, a law of this nature. It would be an intolerable hard&s;hip indeed, to be obliged to give our money for the maintenance of idle, ignorant or vicious eccle&s;ia&s;tics. But however true this may be, if tho&s;e who &s;o violently oppo&s;e every other mode of &s;upporting religion but by voluntary contribution, would properly con&s;ider the &s;ituation of our country, and what va&s;t numbers there are among&s;t us, who neither do nor will a&s;&s;i&s;t in maintaining the teachers of religion, unle&s;s they be compelled by law; if, I &s;ay, they would con|&s;ider the&s;e, and many other things, which might be urged, they would not wholly reprobate every attempt to encourage

religion at the public expence. We have the be&s;t religion in the world. There is no other &s;o well adapted to the genius of a free and independent people, &s;o favorable to liberty and the natural rights of men: nor is there any other which &s;o commodiou&s;ly falls in with that form of govern|ment which we have pitched upon, the &s;upreme end and &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le object of which is the common good<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monte&s;quieu, with his u&s;ual penetration, has ob&s;erved, that the Catholic religion is mo&s;t agreeable to monarchy, and the prote&s;tant to a republic. Indeed the Popi&s;h &s;y&s;tem contains many things which mu&s;t be unfavorable to any form of civil government whatever. Such are indulgencies, bodily penance, di&s;pen&s;ing with oaths, celibacy of the clergy, mona&s;tic in&s;titutions; to &s;ay nothing of the enormous power claimed by the Pope in things mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly civil, and the &s;uperiority which he arrogates over all Chri&s;tian rules.</NOTE>. Tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion of every kind are condemned by the precepts, and utterly repugnant to the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity. It mu&s;t be corrupted, abu&s;ed and perverted, before it can be brought to &s;peak the language of de&s;poti&s;m, and give countenance to arbitrary power. There is not a de&s;potic government on the face of the earth, where it prevails in any con&s;iderable degree of purity. We ought not, therefore, to &s;pare a little co&s;t and pains to &s;upport and encourage a religion &s;o friendly to equal government and laws; and which &s;o directly tends to promote the great de&s;igns of the American revolution. A &s;ufficient number of u&s;eful pa&s;tors might be &s;upported with but very little expence to the public. I am none of tho&s;e who wi&s;h to heap wealth upon eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and make them wholly independent of the people. This would be highly impolitic, and the ready way to de&s;troy their u&s;e|fulne&s;s, by making them proud, luxurious, indolent and negligent of their duty. But they certainly ought to have what is &s;ufficient to keep them above that contempt, which, unhappily among us, is too often connected with a certain degree of hone&s;t poverty. It requires little le&s;s than the re&s;olution of a martyr to undertake the &s;acred employment, where a man has no rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of a maintenance for him&s;elf and his family. When the road to wealth and honor lies open to gentlemen of a liberal education, in &s;o many
<PB N="82" REF="021418_0081_0FB3EEE768A9C658">
other ways, we cannot rea&s;onably expect, that many of them will prefer an employment, from which they can look for little el&s;e in this world, but poverty and contempt. This is very much the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent, e&s;pecially among&s;t tho&s;e formerly called Di&s;&s;enters, many of whom &s;eem to expect, that men will &s;acrifice every earthly con&s;ideration to the de&s;ire of &s;aving &s;ouls. It would be well, if they could find a &s;ufficient number of this temper; but as Chri&s;tianity requires no &s;uch &s;acrifice, and gives tho&s;e who preach the go&s;pel a right to live by the go&s;pel, few, I believe, will think it their duty to relinqui&s;h this right, and engage in a work at once &s;o arduous and painful, without &s;ome hope of a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. If, therefore, we would enjoy tho&s;e advantages which flow from religion, we mu&s;t give proper encouragement <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o its mini&s;ters; and &s;upport them in &s;uch a manner, that the pro&s;pect of extreme indigence, may not deter them from entering into the &s;acred office. And if our citizens had a proper &s;en&s;e of the importance of religion, even in a political view, they would think it no great hard&s;hip to contribute their part for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>What others think of it, I know not; but to me it ap|pears clearer than the &s;un, that we never can be a great, happy or re&s;pectable people, while religion is generally de&s;|pi&s;ed and neglected among us. A general corruption of morals, will always be the con&s;equence of a general con|tempt of religion. The more irreligious a people are, the more vicious; and the more vicious, generally &s;peaking, the more mi&s;erable. However &s;lowly vice may operate, in the end it brings &s;ure and inevitable perdition on the body politic. I hear &s;ome of my countrymen bewailing our political factions and civil di&s;&s;en&s;ions; others lamenting the precarious &s;tate of our trade, the &s;carcity of money and the weight of our taxes; but, I confe&s;s, none of all the&s;e appears to me half &s;o alarming as our rapid progre&s;s in vice. Faction, tumult and inte&s;tine commotions, may be com|pared to certain acute and violent di&s;ea&s;es, which, though for a &s;hort time, they cruelly ravage the human frame; yet, where the con&s;titution is good, a cri&s;is is frequently made,
<PB N="83" REF="021418_0082_0FB3EEE8E9080B28">
the di&s;order thrown off, and the body re&s;tored to its pri&s;tine health and vigor: but vice, like a deadly poi&s;on, &s;ometimes &s;low, but always &s;ure in its operation, infects every member of the political body, corrupts the whole ma&s;s, and i&s;&s;ues in certain de&s;truction. Many, who wi&s;h well to their country, are greatly alarmed with the dread of an ari&s;tocracy, and &s;eem to think, that nothing is &s;o much to be feared, as the undue influence of a few wealthy and a&s;piring gentlemen in the lower parts of our &s;tate, who, they imagine, are com|bining to &s;eize our liberties, and engro&s;s all the power into their own hands. I will not affirm that we are in no danger from this quarter. Our government naturally tends to an ari&s;tocracy; and we cannot be too careful to guard again&s;t the encroachments of power, and watch over tho&s;e privileges which we have &s;o dearly purcha&s;ed. But tru&s;t me, my dear countrymen, it is not a matter of much moment to a people &s;unk in vice, what their form of government is. None can make them happy. There is a certain point of moral corruption, to which if we once arrive, we can no longer exi&s;t as a republic. A revolution mu&s;t then of con|&s;equence take place, and &s;ome other kind of government better &s;uited to our circum&s;tances, and the &s;pirit of the people, be adopted. There is a degree of vice which utterly deba&s;es human nature, and renders men incapable either to think, or judge, or act for them&s;elves. When they come to this, they are prepared for &s;lavery, and it is nece&s;&s;ary, perhaps be&s;t for them, to have a ma&s;ter. The hi&s;tory of the mo&s;t noted republics &s;hows how vain mu&s;t be all the efforts of a few virtuous men, to &s;upport our con&s;titution and pre&s;erve our liberty, when once that virtue, which is the ba&s;is of freedom, and the very &s;oul of a democracy, is no more. When Cae&s;ar pa&s;&s;ed the Rubicon, he &s;aw that Rome mu&s;t have a ma&s;ter; and why not Cae&s;ar as well as another? The virtuous and gallant &s;pirit of Brutus could not brook this ma&s;ter. He thought that by &s;acrificing the tyrant, he could aboli&s;h the tyranny, and re&s;tore the republic; but he found him&s;elf mi&s;taken. The &s;acrifice was not acceptable to the people The Roman &s;pirit was departed; and in&s;tead
<PB N="84" REF="021418_0083_0FB3EEEA6651FB78">
of re&s;uming their liberty, they ungratefully ro&s;e up again&s;t their deliverers. A &s;econd triumvirate was formed, wor&s;e than the fir&s;t; and the lords of the world &s;ervilely &s;urren|dered their liberties into the hands of a boy.

Would you pre&s;erve tho&s;e liberties, which have been bought with the blood of thou|&s;ands of your brave countrymen? Be virtuous. Would you ri&s;e to that &s;ummit of glory and felicity which was the end of your &s;eparation from Great-Britain? Promote re|ligion; and endeavor to &s;tem that torrent of vice which threatens to break in upon us, and bla&s;t all tho&s;e &s;anguine hopes, which animated us to do and &s;uffer &s;o much in the cau&s;e of freedom. Let the rich and the great u&s;e their influence to encourage purity of morals, and in&s;pire their fellow-citizens with tho&s;e &s;entiments of religion and virtue, which are &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to our political welfare.

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>You owe an immen&s;e debt to your country. Providence hath placed you in an exalted &s;tation. Your wealth and rank make you re&s;pectable; your gentle and commanding manners, give an irre&s;i&s;tible force and charm to your exam|ple. In <HI>you,</HI> virtue and religion appear in their mo&s;t lovely and alluring forms. As you, of all men, have it mo&s;t in your power to &s;pread the infection of vice, and corrupt the manners of the multitude: &s;o none can more effectually recommend piety and virtue, or more &s;ucce&s;sfully re&s;train the licentious and the profligate. Only &s;et the example&mdash; we are ready to follow you You are no &s;trangers to the influence of a court on the morals of a kingdom. What courts a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e in monarchies, you are in a republic: you give the tone and tincture to our manners; and if you be di&s;&s;o|lute in your morals and profligate in your lives, the infection will in time &s;pread through all inferior ranks, and corrupt the whole ma&s;s of the people.</P>
<P>Do you profe&s;s your&s;elves lovers of your country? Do you de&s;ire its pro&s;perity? Do you wi&s;h to &s;ee the laws re&s;pected and good order pre&s;erved? And are you convinced that purity of morals, and con&s;equently religion, is nece&s;&s;ary for this purpo&s;e? Lead the way then; &s;how us a pattern we may dare to imitate; and u&s;e that influence and authority which Heaven has put into your hands, &s;o that you may be a "Terror to evil-doers, and a prai&s;e to tho&s;e that do well." This is the only road to true honor and renown; this is the mo&s;t effectual way to advance the glory of your country, to make your names re&s;pectable while you live, and your me|mory dear to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>But I wi&s;h not to confine this addre&s;s to tho&s;e only of high rank and figure: permit me therefore, my dear country|men, to call upon you all, of whatever rank, character, or &s;tation, to lend your aid; and by your example and influ|ence do your utmo&s;t, for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of vice and the encouragement of virtue. There is none of you in a &s;ta|tion

&s;o low, or circum&s;tances &s;o ob&s;cure, as to put it wholly out of your power to contribute, in &s;ome degree, for this purpo&s;e. The longer I con&s;ider the &s;ubject, the more fully I am convinced of the fatal effects of vice, and the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of piety and purity of morals, in order to make us a great and a happy people: and there is no other way in which you can more effectually promote the pro&s;perity of your country, than by the practice of the&s;e. Do you love your country? Do you wi&s;h to di&s;charge the debt you owe to &s;ociety? Do you de&s;ire to be happy here, and enjoy eternal felicity hereafter? Show your re&s;pect for that reli|gion you profe&s;s; and endeavor to conform your lives to the precepts of Chri&s;tianity. "True religion always enlarges the heart, and &s;trengthens the &s;ocial tie." If you be good Chri&s;tians, you can never fail of being good citizens.</P>
<P>The God of Heaven hath favored us, in common with the other States of America, with many &s;ingular ble&s;&s;ings. He has given us many advantages which no other people on the face of the earth have ever enjoyed; and if we im|prove the&s;e advantages in a proper manner, we may &s;oon be the wonder and envy of the world. But if we forget the kind hand which covered us in the hour of danger, and conducted us through a &s;ea of troubles to the calm haven of peace and &s;ecurity; if we abu&s;e the gifts of Providence, turn our liberty to licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and provoke the vengeance of Heaven by our daring impiety, and &s;hocking immoralities; what can we expect, but that a righteous God will give us up to the fatal con&s;equences of our own vices, and inflict upon us that puni&s;hment which we ju&s;tly de&s;erve? Hath he &s;o vi&s;ibly and remarkably interpo&s;ed in our behalf; wrought &s;o many &s;ignal deliverances for us, and poured out &s;o many ble&s;&s;ings upon us; and &s;hall we, by our ingra|titude and abu&s;e of his di&s;tingui&s;hing mercies, provoke him to withdraw them from us, and hold us up to the world as a monument of what an impious and ungrateful people may expect from his hand? Forbid it my countrymen! Forbid it gratitude!&mdash;Forbid it Heaven!</P>

<P><PB REF="021418_0086_0FB3EEEEE38185F8">THE reader has now my ideas on the &s;ubject. They are &s;ubmitted to the candor of my countrymen.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be thought, that, in &s;ome places, the dark &s;ide of things is expo&s;ed, I can hone&s;tly &s;ay, that in this my de&s;ign was good. To awaken my fellow-citizens to a &s;en&s;e of their danger, and thus excite them more carefully to guard again&s;t it, was my motive, and I hope will be my excu&s;e. Born in America, the author yields to none in attachment to his country, of which he can &s;ay, perhaps with greater &s;incerity than father Paul of Venice, <HI>e&s;to perpetua.</HI> He has been the companion of his countrymen in tribu|lation, has &s;hared in the dangers, and &s;everely felt the effects of a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing war: and counts it his glory and happine&s;s to have contributed his part in bringing forward a revolu|tion unequalled in the annals of the world. Content in ob&s;curity, and unambitious of wealth or &s;ame, if ever he had a &s;incere wi&s;h, or breathed an ardent prayer, it is, that this revolution may be productive of tho&s;e happy con&s;equences, to which it hath opened &s;o fair a pro&s;pect, not only to Ame|ricans, but the whole human race. This he is fully per|&s;uaded never <HI>will,</HI> never <HI>can</HI> be the ca&s;e, unle&s;s piety and virtue be re&s;pected and practi&s;ed. And if the candid and judicious &s;hall only pronounce <HI>this,</HI> a <HI>weak</HI> but <HI>well-means</HI> attempt to promote the&s;e, and by con&s;equence the happi|ne&s;s of his country, he will re&s;t &s;atisfied; and &s;ubmit to their deci&s;ion with &s;ilence and re&s;pect.</P>
