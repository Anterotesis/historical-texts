</EPIGRAPH>
<P>PARTIES and divi&s;ions among the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity have hurt and wounded the cau&s;e of religion, more than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll the external at|tacks of dei&s;ts and in&s;idels, heathens and devils.&mdash; The Church of Chri&s;t, at this day, is bleeding, even unto death, by the wounds &s;he has received from this quarter. And what renders the ca&s;e of the poor afflicted Church more pitiable and deplo|rable, is, that, while many are crying out again&s;t divi&s;ions and their &s;ad effects, few con&s;ider at who&s;e door the divi&s;ions lie, or who the per&s;ons
<PB N="4" REF="047065_0003_10229F6320E45190">are, that cau&s;e and foment them: And it often happens that the principal authors of divi&s;ions are the loude&s;t again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Bigots of all parties cry out again&s;t divi&s;ions; but their ideas are very contracted;&mdash;for they care not how much the body of Chri&s;t is rent, or divided, if they can but keep one of his <HI>fingers,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, whole and en|tire to them&s;elves. Thus while many lament the want of <HI>unity,</HI> they mean unity in &s;ome <HI>favourite part</HI> only, and not in the <HI>whole.</HI> If <HI>this part</HI> be in a thriving way, they have no concern for other parts, but rather feel a &s;ecret &s;atisfaction in hear|ing that they are crumbling to pieces,&mdash;and this often becomes a very agreeable topic of conver&s;a|tion.&mdash;I wi&s;h profe&s;&s;ors would impartially examine them&s;elves, and &s;ee if they do not find too much of <HI>this</HI> in their own brea&s;ts, notwith&s;tanding all their pretended de&s;ires of love and unity.</P>
<P>And &s;hould any man, being grieved at the di&s;|tractions of <HI>Zion,</HI> and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a &s;pirit of mo|deration and peace, come forward, and, with a lenient hand, attempt to clo&s;e the breaches, and heal the wounds of the bleeding Church,&mdash;nothing can be more unpromi&s;ing and unpopular. His prof|fered &s;ervices are very unacceptable, and he &s;ubjects him&s;elf to dreadful &s;u&s;picious from every &s;ide:&mdash; Su&s;picious of his <HI>intention</HI>&mdash;and of his leaning more
<PB N="5" REF="047065_0004_10229F65A15FEA30">to <HI>this</HI> part than to <HI>that.</HI> Dreadful in&s;inuations are thrown out, as if he was inimical to this <HI>part</HI> or <HI>that,</HI>&mdash;and grave cautions are given again&s;t pay|ing any regard to what he &s;ays, or even giving him a hearing:&mdash;his doctrine is poi&s;onous&mdash;it &s;a|vours too much of <HI>Calvini&s;in,</HI> &s;ays one,&mdash;and too much of <HI>Arminiani&s;in,</HI> &s;ays another:&mdash;and, per|haps, the more effectually to counteract, and hin|der the &s;alutary effects of the healing balm, his character is attacked, and the &s;oundne&s;s of his re|ligion called greatly into que&s;tion.&mdash;And all this time the &s;ame cry is kept up again&s;t divi&s;ions and their &s;ad effects.&mdash;Is not &s;uch a conduct ju&s;t as ab&s;urd, as if a man &s;hould &s;et a hou&s;e on fire, and furiou&s;ly rail again&s;t any one, that would attempt to quench it, and yet execrate, and vehemently bawl out again&s;t all hou&s;e-burners? But the truth is, that men of <HI>this</HI> bigoted and contracted ca&s;t care not who&s;e hou&s;es are burnt, <HI>&s;o their own eggs are roa&s;ted.</HI></P>
<P>Contentions and divi&s;ions had grievou&s;ly infe&s;t|ed the Church at <HI>Corinth,</HI> and St. Paul wrote this epi&s;tle to the <HI>Corinthians</HI> for the purpo&s;e of putting an end to them. Therefore, after &s;ome introduc|tion, he pre&s;&s;es into the body of his de&s;ign, by ad|dre&s;&s;ing the Church in the&s;e pathetic words:&mdash; <Q>How I be&s;eech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that you all &s;peak the
<PB N="6" REF="047065_0005_10229F672CFE0548">&s;ame thing, and that there be no divi&s;ions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the &s;ame mind and in the &s;ame judgment.</Q> He &s;olemnly charges them to cultivate a &s;pirit of LOVE and UNITY in the Church, and to avoid all party di&s;tinctions and party names, which are pregnant with mi&s;chief,&mdash;naturally tending to contract the mind, &s;tir up &s;trife, and confine cha|rity within the narrow limits of a very &s;mall circle, and thus defeat and de&s;troy the very de&s;ign of Chri&s;tianity in the world. Such baleful con&s;equen|ces are &s;ure to take place, when one and auother are &s;aying, <HI>I am of Paul,&mdash;and I of Apollos,&mdash;and I of Cophas,</HI> or Peter,&mdash;<HI>and I of Chri&s;t.</HI>&mdash;Thus it was at <HI>Corinth,</HI> and a partiality, in favor of this or that preacher, &s;o much prevailed, and gave ri&s;e to &s;uch warm contentions and bitterne&s;s,&mdash;that, I dare &s;ay, they might wi&s;h to have their &s;eparato a&s;&s;emblies,&mdash;and that &s;ome would not go to hear <HI>Paul,</HI> had he preached within 100 yards of their door. They might not like his clo&s;e, &s;earching doctrine&mdash;and to hear human nature &s;o degraded, and &s;ee it drawn in &s;uch black lines, as <HI>Paul</HI> was wont to do;&mdash;nor to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear &s;o much about faith, and righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed&mdash;and their own works <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> from all &s;hare of merit in point of ju&s;tifi|cation. The&s;e, you know, were favourite topics with that great Apo&s;tle.&mdash;<HI>Apelles</HI> was their man&mdash;
<PB N="7" REF="047065_0006_10229F69AC1EAD80">they would go any di&s;tance to hear him. O, he was a &s;weet preacher&mdash;his oratorial powers were &s;o charming, that he might be unto them <HI>as a ve|ry lovely &s;ong of one that had a plea&s;ant voice.</HI>&mdash;Some would hear neither Paul or Apollos but would turn out in all weathers, by night or by day&mdash;be the &s;ea&s;on hot or cold, wet or dry, to hear <HI>Peter</HI>&mdash;they were plea&s;ed with his plain, blunt manner of addre&s;s&mdash;and be&s;ides he &s;eemed, at times, to countenance ceremonies and the works of the law more than Paul did.&mdash;Others again had no ear for any but <HI>Paul</HI>&mdash;for he had the cha|racter of a fir&s;t-rate &s;cholar, and a ma&s;terly rea|&s;oner;&mdash;they were for none of your <HI>fi&s;herman</HI>&mdash;they mu&s;t have one brought up at the &s;eat of the <HI>Mu&s;es,</HI> or at the feet of &s;ome <HI>Gamaliel,</HI> or he would not do for them.&mdash;And there were others who were for no preacher at all,&mdash;they &s;aw no ne|ce&s;&s;ity of going to hear any body&mdash;they could <HI>&s;tay at home, and &s;ay their prayers, and do as well. I am of Chri&s;t,</HI> was their language.</P>
<P>Thus, or, perhaps, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, they went on rapidly, to the great di&s;grace of Chri&s;ti|anity, the di&s;traction of the Church, and the hurt of their own &s;ouls.&mdash;Again&s;t &s;uch proceedings the Apo&s;tle pungently remon&s;trates, as a dangerous rook&mdash;the bane of charity, and the ruin of the Chri&s;tian Church.&mdash;<HI>Is Chri&s;t divided?</HI> &s;ays he.
<PB N="8" REF="047065_0007_10229F6B39387FA0">This is his fir&s;t argument to &s;how the impropriety and ab&s;urdity of church divi&s;ions. The argument &s;tands thus&mdash;<HI>Is Chri&s;t divided?</HI>&mdash;Every body will an&s;wer, no. Then the natural conclu&s;ion, from the premi&s;es, is, Therefore, "his members &s;hould not be divided."&mdash;Chri&s;t is the head of the Church, and all his people are the members o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that one head,&mdash;the con&s;tituent parts of Chri&s;t's body.

The Apo&s;tle makes u&s;e of the &s;ame rea&s;oning, in the 12th chapter of this epi&s;tle, when he reproves the <HI>Corinthiant</HI> for the divi&s;ions, which had ari&s;en among them, from the diver&s;ity of their &s;piritual gifts.

<P>But &s;ome might be willing to a&s;k, what are the e&s;&s;entials of Chri&s;tianity,&mdash;and what is nece&s;&s;ary for a man to profe&s;s, and be, in order to his being a member of Chri&s;t's Church?&mdash;<HI>This</HI> que&s;tion may be an&s;wered in a few words.&mdash;Every man, who &s;o believeth in God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Gho&s;t, that his faith puri|fieth his heart, and worketh by obedient love, is a true Chri&s;tian, and con&s;equently a member of the Church of Chri&s;t, as <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> and <HI>invi&s;ible.</HI>&mdash;But to render this matter more plain, I &s;hall expre&s;s my&s;elf a little more full on the <HI>e&s;&s;entials</HI> of Chri&s;ti|anity and the characteri&s;tics of church members. Every man, then, is a church member, who &s;o believes in God, as to take him for his Lord and God&mdash;his Creator, Ruler and Governor,&mdash;his portion, his happine&s;s and ultimate end:&mdash;that &s;o believes in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as to receive and rely on him, as his only Redeemer and God-man Media|tor, who has fulfilled all righteou&s;ne&s;s for us men,

<P>What I have ju&s;t now enumerated comprize the e&s;&s;entials of the Chri&s;tian religion,&mdash;and who|&s;oever
<PB N="12" REF="047065_0011_10229F762F1E1688">profe&s;&s;eth the&s;e things, profe&s;&s;eth the e&s;&s;en|tials of Chri&s;tianity. And he that not only profe&s;|&s;eth, but hath al&s;o known the transforming power of the&s;e truths his own heart, and his profe&s;&s;ion is attended with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and &s;obriety&mdash;holine&s;s of life and conver&s;ation&mdash;a diligent u&s;e of all the means of grace, and the performance of all the known duties of religion,&mdash;piery toward God, and ju&s;tice and mercy toward men&mdash;and a de&s;ire to know more of God and his holy will, that his obe|dience may be more perfect, and him&s;elf more dead to the world and &s;in&mdash;more alive to God, and more conformed to his holy image:&mdash;if he lives a life of &s;elf-denial&mdash;takes up the cro&s;s, and is daily endea|vouring to crucify the fle&s;h with its affections and lu&s;ts:&mdash;He, I &s;ay, that &s;o believes, and walks, is a Chri&s;tian, both in faith and practice,&mdash;is a living member of Chri&s;t's body the Church, and in a &s;tate of &s;alvation.</P>
<P>And he that profe&s;&s;eth all this, profe&s;&s;eth him|&s;elf to be a Chri&s;tian: And though he may not have that living faith, which &s;avingly unites him to Chri&s;t&mdash;purifies the heart, and con&s;titutes an <HI>invi&s;ible</HI> member,&mdash;yet, if his life does not noto|riou&s;fly contradict and nullify his profe&s;&s;ion, he i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a member of the Church as <HI>vi&s;ible,</HI> and mu&s;t be re|ceived as &s;uch, by the pa&s;tors of the Church, who

<P>Particular <HI>modes</HI> and <HI>forms</HI> of religious wor&s;hip, adopted by one or another, enter not at all into the <HI>e&s;&s;entials</HI> of Chri&s;tianity; nor ought <HI>the&s;e</HI> to be made a bone of contention. If a man has faith in God, as reconciled to him through Je&s;us Chri&s;t&mdash;if he has repentance from dead works&mdash; believes in the Holy Gho&s;t, and, by his &s;acred in|fluence, is made a partaker of the divine nature, and evidences the &s;ame, as expre&s;&s;ed above,&mdash;this man is <HI>fundamentally right,</HI> and ought by no means to be excluded from our charity.&mdash;In ex|ternals, let every man be fully per&s;uaded in his own mind&mdash;and make prayer and &s;upplication to God, in that way, which he finds mo&s;t profitable to him&s;elf.&mdash;If men will not endeavour to culti|vate love and unity with one another, becau&s;e one prays with a form, and another does not,&mdash;I think there is great rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that their zeal &s;avours more of the things of men, than the things of God.</P>
<P>But among the members of the Catholic Church, there is a great variety, in &s;everal re&s;pects. Some are babes, &s;ome are young men, and &s;ome are fa|thers. Some are but lately converted&mdash;others have borne the burden and heat of the day. The <HI>former,</HI> being weak in grace and knowledge, mu&s;t
<PB N="14" REF="047065_0013_10229F7C351F1F00">be fed with milk, and taught and grounded in the fir&s;t principles of the doctrines of Chri&s;t;&mdash;the <HI>lat|ter,</HI> having their &s;en&s;es exerci&s;ed by u&s;e, mu&s;t be fed with &s;tronger meat, and carried on to matu|rity, or perfection.&mdash;They differ much in their complexion. Though all the members of the fa|mily re&s;emble their heavenly Father in holine&s;s, yet, by their complexion, they may be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed one from another.&mdash;Some are meek, mild and timorous;&mdash;others are more choleric and &s;an|guine. The <HI>former</HI> often complain of doubt, fear and difficulty;&mdash;but the latter are wont to &s;peak in more po&s;itive &s;trains, and appear more warm, zealous and confident.&mdash;They differ much as to &s;piritual health. Some are &s;o vigorous that they &s;eem all alive in the duties of religion, and their reli&s;h and appetite for their &s;piritual food, are &s;o quick and &s;harp, that they go to the &s;eve|ral ordinances of religion and means of grace, with chearfulne&s;s and plea&s;ure. Others have but weak &s;tomachs, and are obliged to drag them|&s;elves on, e&s;pecially to &s;ecret duties, and to &s;trive hard to get down the heavenly manna.&mdash;In a word, &s;ome live much in holy peace and joy,&mdash; while others are under frequent complaints of deadne&s;s, coldne&s;s and indi&s;po&s;ition, though they are truly tender and con&s;cientious in all they do and &s;ay, and would not offend God, on any con|&s;ideration,
<PB N="15" REF="047065_0014_10229F7DC3D6C5D8">&mdash;while others, not a jot more con&s;cien|tious, and perhaps having a con&s;iderable &s;hare of mi&s;guided zeal, have few, or no complaints at all.</P>
<P>The members al&s;o differ in this, that all are not equally u&s;eful, nor have they all the &s;ame of|fice. Some, like pillars in the hou&s;e, are the &s;upports of the &s;piritual building, in the places where they live.

Had they been told that &s;uch would be the effects, and that, in a little while, they would be led to for&s;ake, and oppo&s;e even their fathers in the go&s;pel&mdash;probably, they would have replied, with <HI>Hazael,</HI> <Q>Is thy &s;ervant a dog that he &s;hould do this thing?</Q> But after hearing and &s;eeing tho&s;e men, whom they e&s;teem eminent|ly pious, make it their religion and frequent prac|tice to vilify and traduce all others as enemies to Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel&mdash;and hearing their own &s;ide extolled as mere angels, and all others repre&s;ent|ed as of &s;u&s;picious characters, or reproached and &s;poken again&s;t as blind, lifele&s;s and formal&mdash;ene|mies to the <HI>Church,</HI> or to <HI>them,</HI> as they generally call them&s;elves the church, by way of eminence and di&s;tinction;&mdash;when they hear the principle of one, or another loaded with hard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> as if they were the offspring of the devil, and &s;uch like: &mdash;When this is the ca&s;e, it is no wonder it &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mprint a &s;chi&s;matical or party di&s;po&s;ition on the minds of their hearers and admirers. Conver&s;ing
<PB N="30" REF="047065_0029_10229FA5372EA9C8">with &s;uch a party imbitters the mind, and natural|ly creates uncharitablene&s;s towards all others;&mdash; and their con&s;cience becomes &s;o perverted and &s;eared, that they can &s;lander, revile, and throw out the mo&s;t opprobrious &s;peeches again&s;t any that differ from them, without any &s;en&s;e of <HI>guilt</HI> or <HI>&s;hame,</HI>&mdash;nay, they will call it <HI>faithfulne&s;s,</HI> and think they are <HI>bold for God,</HI> while they are acting as contrary to the genius and de&s;ign of the go&s;pel and the law of Chri&s;t, as light is to darkne&s;s. O that you, my dear brethren, would bear with my plainne&s;s, and hear without prejudice&mdash;for be a&s;|&s;ured I have no end to &s;erve, but the good of your &s;ouls, and the peace and happine&s;s of the Catholic church.&mdash;Whenever you hear a man extolling his own party&mdash;and vilifying others, either in plain terms, or by hints and in&s;inuations&mdash;mark that man, and beware&mdash;take care how you catch that &s;pirit,&mdash; for it is not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, but the &s;pirit of pride, bigotry and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s&mdash;yea, it is the &s;pirit of him, who is <HI>the accu&s;er of the brethren,</HI> and the enemy of love and peace.</P>
<P>How much better would it be, and how much mere of the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity would it mani|fe&s;t, if, in&s;tead of <HI>this,</HI> chri&s;tians of every denomi|nation would be tender of the character of each other, and defend it, as long as it could be done with honor&mdash;and endeavour to cultivate a friend|ly
<PB N="31" REF="047065_0030_10229FA6C81ACC70">corre&s;pondence with each other;&mdash;and if there is a diver&s;ity of &s;entiment, in &s;ome particular ar|ticles, which are not <HI>e&s;&s;ential,</HI>&mdash;why &s;hould <HI>that</HI> which is not e&s;&s;ential in it&s;elf, be &s;uffered to do &s;uch an <HI>e&s;&s;ential injury,</HI> as that of tearing the body of Chri&s;t to pieces, wounding the cau&s;e of religion&mdash;and de&s;troying the peace and happine&s;s of its profe&s;&s;ors. What if there be a diver&s;ity in &s;ome <HI>modes</HI> of external wor&s;hip, or <HI>rules</HI> of go|vernment; &mdash;this is only the <HI>body</HI> and ought by no means to hinder our unity and agreement in the <HI>&s;oul</HI> of religion.</P>
<P>The e&s;&s;entials of religion, as briefly laid down under my fir&s;t head, are embraced, I believe by all per&s;ua&s;ions&mdash;and I &s;hould think, they con&s;ti|tute a bottom broad enough, for all Chri&s;tians to &s;tand on together&mdash;and afford a &s;ufficient ba&s;is, for catholic unity.&mdash;Surely, tho&s;e, who will not unite here, mu&s;t have &s;ome other ends to &s;erve than the peace, harmony and welfare of the <HI>Church,</HI> and the good of precious &s;ouls.</P>
<P>O could this ble&s;&s;ed agreement, in the SOUL of religion once be permitted to take place, and prevail, its happy con&s;equences would &s;oon be apparent. Religion would gain credit and e&s;teem in the earth, and force the world to &s;ay, "See how the&s;e Chri&s;tians love!"&mdash;And it would not only gain credit, but influence, when
<PB N="32" REF="047065_0031_10229FA982A70808">its genuine tendency &s;hould manife&s;t it&s;elf, and prevail in love and charity to all mankind.&mdash;We &s;hould hear of no more jars and contentions a|mong its true profe&s;&s;ors, nor pro&s;criptions of this or that preacher, who has nothing wor&s;e to be laid to his charge, than that he does not join &s;ully to our particular party, and is not &s;ubject to our im|mediate controul.&mdash;It would be &s;ufficient for an union of hearts, if he fears God, and orders his conver&s;ation agreeably to the <HI>rules</HI> of the go&s;pel of God, though he might not think proper to &s;ub|ject him&s;elf to every <HI>rule</HI> devi&s;ed by man.</P>
<P>I have &s;poke the more freely on this &s;ubject, becau&s;e it is well known, that during the long cour&s;e of my mini&s;try, I have never &s;at up as a head, or violent abettor of any party. And though I am a mini&s;ter and a member of what is called the Old Church, and &s;uch I expect to live and die,&mdash;yet have I &s;trenuou&s;ly endeavored to cultivate love, affection, harmony and friend&s;hip with <HI>all</HI>&mdash;I have vindicated the characters of <HI>all,</HI> which I believed to be unju&s;tly a&s;per&s;ed,&mdash;and, as far as opportunity has &s;erved, I have heard <HI>all</HI> &mdash;preached to <HI>all,</HI> and gladly joined with <HI>all,</HI> in their places of wor&s;hip, in every ordinance of Chri&s;t.&mdash;But I have &s;een &s;o much mi&s;chief done by bigotry and a party &s;pirit, not only in that particular corner of the vineyard where I have
<PB N="33" REF="047065_0032_10229FAC5537ABD0">more &s;tatedly laboured, but el&s;ewhere, that I thought it incumbent on me to &s;hew the im|propriety of the&s;e things, and point out their baneful effects&mdash;and to bear my te&s;timony again&s;t them. And at the &s;ame time to lay down the broad and &s;olid ba&s;is of chri&s;tian <HI>love</HI> and <HI>unity</HI> in the Soul&mdash;the vitals and e&s;&s;entials of religion, and to invite and exhort <HI>all</HI> to lay a&s;ide all their jars, contentions, animo&s;ities and unchri&s;tian cen&s;ures, and henceforth endeavour to cultivate a friendly corre&s;pondence with all,&mdash;and to imbibe a &s;pirit of love and charity&mdash;as unbounded as the limits of the <HI>Holy Catholic Church.</HI> That God of his in|finite mercy may render what has been &s;aid ef|fectual to &s;ub&s;erve the de&s;ign and end intended, I beg for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, Amen.</P>
