<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>SOME of the principal debates of the pre|&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s, with Remarks there|on, appeared a few weeks ago, under the Title of, "A Pro&s;pect from the Congre&s;s-Gallery," publi&s;h|ed by Mr. Thomas Bradford. The favourable re|ception of that work led me to undertake that which I now offer to the public. My plan, how|ever, being altered, for rea&s;ons with which I am going to acquaint the reader, it became nece&s;&s;ary to alter the title al&s;o.</P>
<P>No one, who has been an attentive ob&s;erver of the violent and dangerous attempts, which have been made, and are &s;till making, again&s;t the Fede|ral Con&s;titution, and con&s;equently again&s;t the peace, pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of our country, can have failed to perceive, that they had their ri&s;e in the de|ception, which has been &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated through every part of the United-Sates. It is not to be pre&s;umed, indeed, that the leaders in this ho|&s;tile and formidable combination have been deceiv|ed: they have long been mar&s;halled and ready for the attack; but, it is the delu&s;ion, which has been quietly &s;uffered to &s;teal its way among the people, that has called them into the field and encouraged them to a&s;&s;ault, fir&s;t the out-works, and at la&s;t the very citadel of our liberties and our lives.</P>
<P><PB REF="030219_0005_0FE5264C763F40B8">The &s;ource of this delu&s;ion it is not difficult to di&s;cover: we have it continually before our eyes. I mean the <HI>public papers,</HI> and I &s;peak with a very few exceptions.</P>
<P>The general government adopted the mo&s;t effec|tual mea&s;ures for facilitating the conveyance of in|formation to every quarter of the Union, at the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible expence. Hence &s;ub&s;cribers to papers were found in abundance, and the editors, &s;triking off numerous impre&s;&s;ions, were, of cour&s;e, ena|bled to furni&s;h them at a low price. The intention of the government, as expre&s;&s;ed by the Pre&s;ident him&s;elf, was certainly the mo&s;t beneficent, that of &s;preading <HI>true</HI> information and <HI>u&s;eful</HI> knowledge among all cla&s;&s;es of the community. But what has been the con&s;equence? Exactly the contrary. The French Revolution bur&s;t forth like a vulcano, and its devouring lava reached even us. The editors, perceiving the partiality of the mo&s;t <HI>numerous</HI> cla&s;s of their &s;ub&s;cribers for this revolution, and all the novel and wild principles it has given ri&s;e to, have been &s;educed, by the love of gain, to flatter that partiality by extolling tho&s;e principles, at the ex|pence of every thing, their own private intere&s;t ex|cepted. Their papers, which &s;warm like &s;ummer flies, are become the vehicles of fal&s;ehood in place of truth, of ignorance in place of knowledge. Like the tenebrificous &s;tars, mentioned by a celebrated author, they &s;hed darkne&s;s in place of light.</P>
<P>A veil has been carefully drawn over the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es and horrors re&s;ulting from the anarchical &s;y&s;tem of France; or, when this could not be done, when the editors have feared to be anticipated by their fellow-labourers, they have endeavoured to out-vie each other in apologies for what ought to
<PB N="v" REF="030219_0006_0FE5264E01286EB8">
have been held up to dete&s;tation, or, at lea&s;t, as an awful le&s;&s;on to our&s;elves. Every one, even of the mo&s;t de&s;tructive and impious acts of that pre|tended republic, has been trumpeted forth as the effect of a liberal and enlightened policy; while no in&s;inuation, no &s;ubtilty, no audacious fal&s;ehood, has been left une&s;&s;ayed to thwart all the mea&s;ures of our own mild and wi&s;e government, to disfigure its principles, and &s;ever it from the affections of the people.</P>
<P>To countervail the malignant efforts of the&s;e retailers has ever been my wi&s;h; and, I hope, it will not be thought pre&s;umption in me, if I be|lieve that the trifles from my pen, which the public have honoured with their peru&s;al, have, in &s;ome &s;light degree, had the de&s;ired effect. But, alas, what can a &s;traggling pamphlet, nece&s;&s;arily confined to a &s;ingle &s;ubject, do again&s;t a hundred thou&s;and volumes of mi&s;cellaneous fal&s;ehood in folio! Their &s;heets, if extended, would more than cover the &s;ur|face of our country.</P>
<P>In oppo&s;ing a literary mon&s;ter like this, I am aware that a Porcupine, with all his quills, can ne|ver hope for complete &s;ucce&s;s: but, nothing can be accompli&s;hed without being begun: I hope to call up abler hands to my aid: to me, it will be a &s;uf|ficient honour to have led the way.</P>
<P>This I &s;hall attempt, in a monthly work, of the &s;ame bulk and price as the one which is here &s;ub|mitted to the public. In this work I &s;hall take a re|view of the political tran&s;actions of the pa&s;t month; give an account of every democratic trick, whe|ther of native growth or imported from abroad; unravel the windings of the pretended patriots,
<PB N="vi" REF="030219_0007_0FE5268C04A1F190">
and more particularly tho&s;e of the <HI>flour-merchants;</HI> and I tru&s;t, I &s;hall be enabled to give, monthly, a &s;ketch of political affairs more &s;atisfactory, becau&s;e more correct, than has ever yet appeared in this country. The&s;e will be the leading objects; but I &s;hall exclude nothing, not entirely foreign to the nature of the work, that may contribute to the u&s;e or amu&s;ement of my readers.</P>
<P>The news-papers are &s;upported by &s;ub&s;cription, and for that very rea&s;on the <HI>Cen&s;or</HI> &s;hall not. As long as people read, &s;o long &s;hall I write; and, when the Book&s;eller adverti&s;es me that the work lies on his &s;helf, it will be a very good hint for me to draw in my quills.</P>
<P>Here, then, begins a <HI>bellum eternum</HI> between the fabricating <HI>Quid-Nuncs</HI> and me.&mdash;There is my glove, gentlemen; take it up as &s;oon as you will. You well know that your abu&s;e will infinitely re|dound to my honour; and therefore, to &s;ilence me, by rendering my work &s;terile and unintere&s;ting, you are reduced to the cruel nece&s;&s;ity of telling the truth.</P>
<P>I &s;hould think it nece&s;&s;ary to offer an apology for having prefixed the title of <HI>Cen&s;or</HI> to the pre|&s;ent Number; but the reader will at once perceive; that it is now a&s;&s;umed for the &s;ake of uniformity, as applicable to the future contents of the work, and not to the remarks on the debates of Con|gre&s;s, a <HI>body</HI> to which I &s;hould be very &s;orry to be wanting in re&s;pect.</P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>POLITICAL</HI> CENSOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reader will plea&s;e to recollect, that, in the <HI>Pro&s;pect from the Congre&s;s Gallery,</HI> I brought down the proceedings in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;enta|tives to the 5th of January, the memorable day of the exhibition of the French Flag. I &s;hould not now have thought of returning to the &s;ame &s;ubject, had I not been led to it by an attack on the Pre&s;i|dent, in the anarchical Aurora of Philadelphia.</P>
<P>One would have thought, that giving this flag a place among the <HI>Archives</HI> of the United States, would have been conferring honour enough on it; but nothing would content the French-Americans, who write in the paper I have ju&s;t mentioned, &s;hort of its being hoi&s;ted in the Congre&s;s Chamber, as a trophy of the victory of French influence. They cite us the example of the Convention. But, let
<PB N="8" REF="030219_0009_0FE526B71C79E2F0">
them &s;ay under what circum&s;tances, and with what motive our flag was granted a con&s;picuous place in their hall. It was di&s;honoured by being &s;wung up, gibbeted up, by the &s;ide of the flag of <HI>regenerated</HI> Geneva; a &s;tate in which the Convention had e&s;ta|bli&s;hed their &s;y&s;tem of pillage and murder, and which they treated as a conquered country, rather than as an <HI>independent</HI> ally. To add to our humili|ation, a duplicate, as I may call it, of our flag was &s;ent to Geneva, and there exhibited in the Con|vention of a poor little degraded nation of thirty thou&s;and bodies, I will not call them &s;ouls. This was &s;aying to the Geneve&s;e: See, you are not the only people who have thrown them&s;elves on our protecting power, and &s;ent us a pledge of their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to our principles.</P>
<P>Thus, by the indi&s;cretion (to give it the milde&s;t term) of our Amba&s;&s;ador, have we been degraded in the eyes of even <HI>Italians,</HI> and expo&s;ed to the gibes of the little &s;candalizing circles of the lea&s;t re&s;pectable people in Europe: and, in return for this cruel in&s;ult, we are called upon to di&s;tingui&s;h the flag of the Convention with a place in the pub|lic &s;ittings of our legi&s;lature, and by this act ac|knowledge our&s;elves the &s;upple tools of our in|&s;ulters!&mdash;This is modern patrioti&s;m.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="debate">
<HEAD>DEBATE ON THE APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE MINT.
<DATE><HI>January</HI> 19th.</DATE></HEAD>
<P><HI>Mr. Williams,</HI> agreeably to notice before given, mov|ed <HI>to &s;trike out of the Appropriation Bill all the gro&s;s &s;um, appropriated for the officers of the Mint.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="030219_0010_0FE526EA95703478">Mr. SEDGWICK (from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts) thought that the cour&s;e which the gentleman is pur&s;uing, has never been adopted before. It is incorrect to di&s;cu&s;s the merits of the mint in pa&s;&s;ing this bill. We might as well take up the &s;alary of the chief ju&s;tice, or any other article in the bill, as the mint. We never would have done at this rate. We are now only to vote for the bill, as agreeably to the laws already made. Mr. Sedgwick &s;aid that if the gentleman from New-York (Mr. Williams) would bring forward any propo&s;ition for the regulation, or even the abolition of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the mint, if it could be proved productive of public benefit, he, with every other gentleman, would give him their aid to effect the object; but that now, he conceived, it could not regularly be brought forward. He thought an appropriation bill &s;hould be conformed exactly to the &s;tate of the public en|gagements, and that where e&s;tabli&s;hments had been form|ed and &s;alaries provided, the amount of them &s;hould be the principle of calculating the amount of appropriations; and the Hou&s;e ought not, by witholding appropriations, to break in upon and de&s;troy e&s;tabli&s;hments formed by the whole legi&s;lature. That the&s;e ob&s;ervations had hitherto been &s;anctioned by the practice on this &s;ubject. He ob|&s;erved, that if the Hou&s;e was to inve&s;tigate, in the di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of an appropriation bill, the amount of &s;alaries and the legal e&s;tabli&s;hments of government, the public &s;ervice would be dangerou&s;ly de&s;troyed. He remarked, that it was to be ob&s;erved, that no appropriation was made for any purpo&s;e &s;ince the commencement of the year.</P>
<P>Mr. GALLATIN (from <HI>Geneva</HI>) ro&s;e to &s;tate a general principle which he thought it of importance to lay down on this occa&s;ion; le&s;t the deci&s;ion on the pre&s;ent que&s;tion grounded on a different principle, &s;hould on &s;ome future occa&s;ion be brought forward. The principle was, <HI>that this Hou&s;e has a right by witholding appropiations when they &s;ee proper, to &s;top the wheels of Government.</HI> This he &s;aid was plainly to be inferred from the practice of the Hou&s;e, in their pa&s;&s;ing annually an appropriation law&mdash;He ob|&s;erved, that in one in&s;tance the Hou&s;e had departed from that principle. In re&s;pect to the payment of the intere&s;t on the public debt, for the &s;upport of the public credit,
<PB N="10" REF="030219_0011_0FE5265944C86938">
the Hou&s;e had thought it nece&s;&s;ary to give up that right. If this principle is not ju&s;t, it would be be&s;t to make a permanent provi&s;ion at once.</P>
<P>Mr. SEDGWICK &s;aid that he had certainly no intention to have given occa&s;ion to the ob&s;ervations which had been made, but as the general principle which he had laid down, had been denied, and as it had &s;ome relation either intimate or remote to the &s;ubject before the committee, he would take the liberty to repeat the principle, and to &s;ay a few words in &s;upport of it.</P>
<P>The principle, then, which he had a&s;&s;umed was, that when legal e&s;tabli&s;hments were made, it was the duty of the legi&s;lature to make appropriations conformably to the public engagements; and that neither branch had a right to withhold its a&s;&s;ent.&mdash;He ob&s;erved that the whole legi&s;|lature, and not a part, were competent to form contracts, and to e&s;tabli&s;h, and alter compen&s;ations and &s;alaries. The legi&s;lature, and not either branch of it, had the pow|er of expre&s;&s;ing the public will, and pledging the public faith: that when a &s;alary is a&s;certained, the public faith is pledged that it &s;hall be paid, according to the &s;tipulati|on; and that therefore the public credit is involved in making the nece&s;&s;ary appropriations, without which it could not be paid. He a&s;ked if in &s;uch ca&s;e it was com|petent to the Hou&s;e rightfully to withhold the means ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the performance of the public engagements!</P>
<P>He &s;aid he had always &s;uppo&s;ed that the power of the Hou&s;e, in the ca&s;e of appropriations, did not give a pow|er to yield or withhold a&s;&s;ent on &s;uch a &s;ubject. He be|lieved in every &s;uch in&s;tance the exerci&s;e of di&s;cretion was re&s;trained; to illu&s;trate his ideas, he could mention a &s;imilar in&s;tance. The con&s;titution had declared, that the Pre&s;ident &s;hould receive a &s;tated compen&s;ation for his &s;er|vices, to be a&s;certained by law; which could neither be dimini&s;hed nor enlarged during the term for which he &s;hould have been elected. Here was a duty impo&s;ed on the legi&s;lature, with the performance of which they could not, they had no power to di&s;pen&s;e. Yet after the compen&s;a|tion was &s;tated, no payment could be made in con&s;e|quence of appropriating. He a&s;ked if in this ca&s;e, when
<PB N="11" REF="030219_0012_0FE5268A7AAC5AF0">
the public will was expre&s;&s;ed, the engagement and the national faith pledged, the legi&s;lature could of right with|hold the nece&s;&s;ary appropriation? The &s;ame ob&s;ervations might he &s;aid be applied to every in&s;tance where public controuls were formed. The public faith was pledged, the nece&s;&s;ary appropriations mu&s;t be made to prevent a violation of it, and if withheld &s;uch violation might ju&s;tly be charged on the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>Here a long conver&s;ation took place with re&s;pect to the expediency of the propo&s;ed mea&s;ure, on the ad|vantages and di&s;advantages of a Mint, &amp;c. After which Mr. <HI>Living&s;ton,</HI> whom we &s;hall by-and-by &s;ee making a con&s;iderable figure in the field of oppo&s;ition to the govern|ment, made a motion <HI>for the &s;triking out the whole appro|priation for the Mint.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. MURRAY, (from Maryland) &s;aid that had the gen|tleman from New-York moved for delay, for the purpo&s;e of introducing a motion to repeal the law which rendered this appropriation nece&s;&s;ary, he would not have troubled the Hou&s;e with a &s;ingle remark; but his motion to &s;trike out an appropriation for the purpo&s;e of bringing the poli|cy of the law it&s;elf into di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, contained a principle in his mind &s;o repugnant to the great legi&s;lative duties of the Hou&s;e that he would oppo&s;e it. The object of the appropriation is not a temporary one, but a part of the machinery of our government, under the expre&s;s authori|ty of the con&s;titution by law. The doctrine now contend|ed for by the gentlemen from New-York and Penn&s;ylvania (Mr. Living&s;ton and Mr. Gallatin) was that this Hou&s;e have a di&s;cretionary power of appropriating or not&mdash;To this doctrine, taken in the extent which he conceived they contended for, he could not give his &s;upport. On the contrary, he thought, that in all ca&s;es where an ap|propriation flowed from a law to make good a contract, or to erect a permanent organ in the government, and from any law who&s;e object was permanent, the true doctrine was, that it was the duty of the Hou&s;e to vote an appropriation. A law is the will of the nation. The &s;ame powers only, that formed it can repeal it. If it be a con&s;titutional act, no power can lawfully ob&s;truct its operation or its exi&s;tence. But attending to the doctrine
<PB N="12" REF="030219_0013_0FE526F5D8F505D8">
maintained to day it would follow, that though this Hou&s;e had not the power of repealing a law made by all the branches of government, it may ob&s;truct its operations and render it a dead letter; though it cannot repeal, it may do what &s;hall amount to a repeal, which is the a&s;|&s;umption of a power almo&s;t equal to that of exclu&s;ive le|gi&s;lation. He thought he &s;aw in this an evil of great ex|tent, and an anarchy of theoretic principles. It appeared to him that though we originate money bills, we had no right to refu&s;e an appropriation to exi&s;ting laws that either &s;ecured a debt or any contract, or that related to objects permanent by the law that created or acknowleged them, as long as the law it&s;elf remained unrepealed. We had but a &s;hare of legi&s;lative power. Where a law relative to &s;uch objects as he had alluded to exi&s;ted, from which an appropriation followed, till the law cea&s;ed by repeal or by other con&s;titutional means, it was obligatory upon us as well as upon our con&s;tituents, and the only powers we could exerci&s;e of a di&s;cretionary &s;ort re&s;olved them&s;elves either into the mode of making good the appropriation, or of voting for its repeal. The other branches would then judge of the propriety of our proceeding; but till they who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in its enacting, judged with us the nece&s;&s;ity of doing it away, a duty re&s;ulted that we &s;hould give it the energy intended by its enaction.</P>
<P>The Appropriation for the mint was finally pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="remarks">
<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t three items in the Appropriation Bill were as follows:
<TABLE>
<ROW>
<CELL>&nbsp;</CELL>
<CELL><HI>DOL.</HI></CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>For compen&s;ation to the Pre&s;ident of the United States</CELL>
<CELL>25,000</CELL>

<CELL>5,000</CELL>
</ROW>

<CELL>To the Members of the Senate</CELL>
<CELL>38,000</CELL>
</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>Now, would it not have been much the &s;horte&s;t way for Mr. <HI>Living&s;ton</HI> to move for &s;triking out the&s;e three items! This would have been coming to the mark at once. By only three &s;trokes of the
<PB N="13" REF="030219_0014_0FE5272B47DF2300">
<HI>"Calm Ob&s;erver's"</HI> pen, the free, the indepen|dant, the beneficent government of the United States might have been changed into a National Convention; and in the &s;ame number of days, we might have &s;een our &s;treets patrolled by revolu|tionary ruffians, our property expo&s;ed to requi&s;iti|ons and our heads to the guillotine.</P>
<P>But, it is not my intention to enter into the me|rits of a motion, at once the height of malevolence and ab&s;urdity; I have introduced this debate mere|ly to have an opportunity of introducing the prin|ciple laid down by <HI>Mr. Gallatin,</HI> and <HI>Mr. Galla|tin</HI> along with it.</P>
<P>This gentleman tells us, that the Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives <Q><HI>have a right, by withholding appro|priations</HI> when they &s;ee proper, <HI>to</HI> &s;top the wheels of Government.</Q>&mdash;I &s;hould be glad to know were he learnt this: whether from his companions in Brad|dock's Field, or from their corre&s;pondents, the corrupted <HI>flour-merchants</HI> in Philadelphia. They, indeed, were well ver&s;ed in &s;topping the wheels of government, by the agency of <HI>appropriations.</HI></P>
<P>When Mr. Gallatin ro&s;e from his &s;eat to broach this clogging principle, there was an old farmer &s;itting be&s;ide me, to whom the per&s;on of the ora|tor &s;eemed familiar. "Ah, ah!" &s;ays he, <Q>what's little Mo&s;es in Congre&s;s!</Q>&mdash;I &s;harply reprimand|ed him for taking one of our Repre&s;entatives for a Jew; but, to confe&s;s a truth, the gentleman from <HI>Geneva</HI> has an accent not unlike that of a wander|ing I&s;raelite. It is neither Italian German nor French, and, were it not a &s;ort of leze republican|i&s;m, I would &s;ay he clipped the king's Engli&s;h mo&s;t unmercifully. Such an accent is admirably adapted for extolling the value of leaden buckles,
<PB N="14" REF="030219_0015_0FE5271C6259BF38">
or for augmenting the di&s;cordant howlings of a &s;y|nagogue; but it throws a certain air of ridicule over the debates of a legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly, and forms a &s;ort of burle&s;que on the harmonious eloquence of the other members.</P>
<P>When I told the good jog-trot to take care what he was &s;aying, for that the per&s;onage then on his legs was no other than the great Gallatin, he open|ed his eyes, and with a look and voice expre&s;&s;ive of an hone&s;t indignation, "what!" &s;ays he, <Q>that &s;ame Gallatin who was one of the leaders in the We&s;tern In&s;urrection?</Q>&mdash;I could not help &s;mil|ing at the &s;implicity of my country friend, in not perceiving that &s;uch a circum&s;tance was the highe&s;t proof of Mr. Gallatin's patrioti&s;m, and the only one that recommended him to the &s;uffrages of his con&s;tituents.&mdash;"No wonder," &s;ays the farmer, <Q>that he wants to &s;top the wheels of government. I wi&s;h he'd attempt to &s;top the wheels of my waggon, as I am going down hill.</Q>&mdash;God for|give me, but I believe I &s;aid <HI>amen.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Gallatin has been accu&s;ed of incon&s;i&s;tency, but here I cannot join the enemies of that gentle|man. Whatever a man may be, I love to do him ample ju&s;tice. This is a principle &s;o &s;trongly im|printed in my brea&s;t, that it induces me to under|take the defence of Mr. Gallatin's con&s;i&s;tency, though I have not the highe&s;t re&s;pect for his gene|ral conduct or for his character.</P>
<P>We might follow this gentleman through his political career from the day of his di&s;embarkation to the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s, but it will not, I imagine, be nece&s;&s;ary to go further back than the We&s;tern Rebellion.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="030219_0016_0FE526B8CCA70B50">So early as the 21&s;t of July, 1791, we find him Clerk to a meeting for oppo&s;ing the exci&s;e law, or, in other words, <Q>&s;topping the wheels of go|vernment.</Q>&mdash;On the 21&s;t of April, 1792, we find this adjourned meeting declaring: <Q>That whereas &s;ome men may be found among us, &s;o far lo&s;t to every &s;en&s;e of virtue, and feeling for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our country, as to accept the office for the collection of the duty.</Q></P>

<P>Thus, then, I think here is no incon&s;i&s;tency; no change of principles.

<P>It is &s;aid, indeed, that Mr. Gallatin has &s;ince re|pented of his in&s;urrection conduct, that he called the above quoted re&s;olution his "political &s;in," and we all know that he &s;igned a promi&s;e of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the laws; but, let it be remembered, that he never talked about this political &s;in, until he came down to Philadelphia, and that his promi&s;e of &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion

<HEAD>DEBATE ON THE APPOINTMENT OF A STENOGRAPHER.
<DATE>January 29th.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>On the 28th a report of the Stenographical committee was given in, &s;pecifying that the committee had received propo&s;als from Mr. <HI>David Robert&s;on</HI> of Virginia, who&s;e demand for one &s;e&s;&s;ions was 4,000 dollars. The report became the order of the day for the twenty ninth, when a re&s;olution was propo&s;ed in favour of the appointment.</P>
<P>I &s;hall choo&s;e from this debate what fell from Mr. Swan|wick and Mr. William Smith, as appearing to me to comprize nearly all that was urged on both &s;ides.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="030219_0018_0FE5269992B1B888">Mr. SWANWICK (from Penn&s;ylvania) As to the gentle|man who is the &s;ubject of the re&s;olution, If I have more &s;trenuou&s;ly than u&s;ual oppo&s;ed the motion, it is from a de&s;ire to keep him from quitting the lucrative &s;ituation he is &s;aid to find him&s;elf in, to embark on the &s;tormy &s;ea he is contemplating: to be the organ of the members of this Hou&s;e to their con&s;tituents is indeed a very delicate ta&s;k; one for which, con&s;idering the danger he might be in of an Orpheus's fate, that of being torn to pieces, the &s;alary is but a poor compen&s;ation. He is to do ju&s;tice to the eloquence of &s;ome members&mdash;he is to clothe in an elegant dre&s;s the uncouth, yet well meaning expre&s;&s;ions of others, but what will he do with the &s;ilent members, who never &s;peak at all?&mdash;What will their con&s;tituents think of them; indeed, Sir, if he had the idea I have formed of his dan|ger, he will not undertake at all. Faction and party have been mentioned&mdash;happy Stenographer if he can keep clear of the&s;e. If he fall into their power, in&s;en&s;ibly he will repre&s;ent one &s;ide in clouds and darkne&s;s, the other as ornamented with the brighte&s;t beams of light. How will he plea&s;e both? Mi&s;repre&s;entation is complained of alas, Sir, how quick is error, how flow is the progre&s;s of truth in almo&s;t all things: our Stenographer mu&s;t indeed be a wonder working man, if he can revert this tide, and make every where light, and correct rea&s;oning prevail. The be&s;t mode of informing our con&s;tituents is by the yeas and nays on our acts; this truly &s;hews, as a gentle|man from New-Hamp&s;hire has ob&s;erved, our doings, which are much more intere&s;ting to them than our ab|&s;tract rea&s;onings; the&s;e our con&s;tituents will ea&s;ily form to them&s;elves ideas of when they know our votes.</P>
<P>Mr. W. LYMAN (Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts) &s;aid that, if this re&s;olu|tion did not pa&s;s, <HI>it would be advi&s;able to &s;end all the Prim|ers to the gallery.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. W. SMITH (South Carolina) &s;aid it was admitted on all &s;ides, that it was highly important for the people to receive the mo&s;t accurate information of the proceed|ings of the hou&s;e, and that the debates were in general extremely mi&s;repre&s;ented. Was it not then the duty of the hou&s;e to remedy this evil and to adopt &s;uch mea&s;ures as would tran&s;mit to the people in every part of the Unit|ed States the mo&s;t accurate information of the conduct of
<PB N="18" REF="030219_0019_0FE5265BD7C1AE28">
their repre&s;entatives? The hou&s;e had now an opportuni|ty of obtaining the &s;ervices of a gentleman peculiarly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for the rare talent of reporting with accuracy pub|lic debates: the compen&s;ation which would be adequate to &s;uch u&s;eful and laborious &s;ervice was beyond the ability of any printer, the hou&s;e ought therefore to contribute to|wards it; the &s;um required was a trifle when compared with the advantages; it was no object: the only que&s;tion then was whether the &s;tenographer ought to be an officer of the Hou&s;e; in that capacity he certainly would be more ea&s;ily re&s;trained from the commi&s;&s;ion of any wilful mi&s;re|pre&s;entation. Mr. Smith did not feel the force of the ob|jections again&s;t the report. It had been &s;aid that although the members were now mi&s;repre&s;ented, yet they had it in their power to publi&s;h corrections; but the&s;e corrections were often overlooked, while the mi&s;repre&s;entation was operating very injuriou&s;ly to the character of the member: this was generally the ca&s;e in places remote from the &s;eat of government; the mangled account of a debate was re|publi&s;hed in a di&s;tant paper, and the correction if it reach|ed the di&s;tant printer, was generally di&s;regarded. Among the opponents to the report, Mr. Smith &s;aid that he was &s;urpri&s;ed to find the gentleman who repre&s;ented this city, (Mr. Swanwick) who more than any other member &s;hould have withdrawn his oppo&s;ition to the mea&s;ure propo&s;ed; that gentleman's con&s;tituents had it in their power at any time to hear the debates of Congre&s;s; they were on the &s;pot; ought he not then in candor to a&s;&s;i&s;t in facilitating to the remote citizens the means of obtaining the be&s;t knowledge of the proceedings, and the mo&s;t correct &s;tate|ment of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of the hou&s;e; ought they, from their remotene&s;s, to be kept in the dark, or to be furni&s;h|ed with &s;uch light as would only mi&s;lead? Had they not a claim on the hou&s;e to adopt &s;uch means as would ena|ble the citizens in every &s;tate to judge of the propriety of public mea&s;ures? The member from this city had ano|ther exclu&s;ive advantage; if mi&s;repre&s;ented he could cor|rect the error, and the correction will be read; that was not the ca&s;e with the members of remoter &s;tates, who&s;e reputation might be injured by mi&s;repre&s;entation without a &s;imilar advantage: the member from this city was in the mid&s;t of his con&s;tituents; he had daily opportunities of &s;etting right any mi&s;tatement by per&s;onal explanation.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="030219_0020_0FE526F9871629C8">Mr. SMITH &s;aid he did not agree with &s;ome Gentlemen that it was &s;ufficient for the people to know what laws were pa&s;&s;ed, without knowing the previous di&s;cu&s;&s;ions; he thought on the contrary, the favorable or unfavorable impre&s;&s;ion of a Law on the public mind would depend in a great degree on the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned for and again&s;t it in debates, and the people ought to know tho&s;e rea&s;ons; when a Law pa&s;&s;es, impo&s;ing a Tax, would not the peo|ple be reconciled, if they &s;aw from the di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of the hou&s;e that &s;uch Tax was unavoidable, and that the par|ticular mode of taxation was the be&s;t which could be de|vi&s;ed? And ought this information to depend entirely on the caprice or convenience of the reporters, who at|tended when it plea&s;ed them, and who publi&s;hed ju&s;t as much of the debates as they found lei&s;ure or patience to accompli&s;h? Mr. Smith &s;aid, he was convinced that the errors which had excited &s;o much complaint were not the effect of de&s;ign, but merely of inadequacy to the ta&s;k; very few were competent to &s;uch a bu&s;ine&s;s, which requir|ed peculiar &s;kill in &s;tenography, very laborious application, and a clear comprehen&s;ion of the &s;ubject matter of debate. It could not be expected that per&s;ons thus qualified would devote their whole time to this bu&s;ine&s;s without an ample reward. The report was objected to becau&s;e there was novelty in the plan; it was true the Hou&s;e of Com|mons of England had no &s;uch officer, but their practice was not a fit precedent for us on this occa&s;ion, for they admitted no per&s;on to write down in the hou&s;e their pro|ceedings; their debates were taken from memory. This hou&s;e on the contrary had from its fir&s;t in&s;titution, facili|tated, by every accommodation, the reporting their pro|ceedings. The thing was not altogether however without precedent; during the exi&s;tence of the national a&s;&s;embly of France there were officers of the hou&s;e who compo&s;ed a daily work called the Logography, which was an exact account of the debates of that body. It had been a&s;ked what controul the hou&s;e were to have over this officer? he an&s;wered that the Stenographer would be liable to be cen|&s;ured or di&s;placed, if he &s;hould be guilty of wilful mi&s;re|pre&s;entation; it would be always ea&s;y to di&s;criminate be|tween a ca&s;ual inadvertence, and a criminal mi&s;tatement: the officer's character and talents, his re&s;pon&s;ibility to the hou&s;e, and his oath to report with impartiality, would
<PB N="20" REF="030219_0021_0FE4FE54D8CB59E0">
be a &s;ufficient pledge of his accuracy. Mr. Smith &s;eriou&s;|ly believed, that the character of the hou&s;e had &s;uffered from the erroneous &s;tatements which had gone abroad; he wi&s;hed to guard again&s;t this evil in future; he was will|ing, for him&s;elf, that every &s;yllable he uttered within tho&s;e walls, &s;hould be carried to every part of the union, but he deprecated mi&s;repre&s;entation. He was anxious that the truth &s;hould be known, in relation to every act of the government, for he was as &s;atisfied that the affection and confidence of the people in this government would in|crea&s;e with the promulgation of truth, as that whatever it had lo&s;t of that affection and confidence was owing al|together to the propagation of detraction and calumny. It was under the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions that he had originally brought forward the propo&s;ition, and that he now recom|mended the report, and having heard no rea&s;ons to change his &s;entiments of the expediency of the mea&s;ure, he &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in &s;upporting it.</P>
<P>The committee of the whole was di&s;charged from any further con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="remarks">
<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>The Hou&s;e had nearly got upon a rock here, which they would have found it difficult to get off from in &s;afety. Perhaps there was never a re&s;olu|tion propo&s;ed, at once &s;o apparently trifling and &s;o pregnant with mi&s;chief. Let any man reflect for a moment on the &s;tate of parties in this country, and he will look with affright at the appointment of an officer, inve&s;ted with the power of disfiguring every argument and even every phra&s;e that a member of the legi&s;lature may let fall. The gentlemen who &s;upported the re&s;olution, talk of his being &s;worn; and, did we live in tho&s;e good old times, when oaths were &s;uperior to the &s;pirit of party, the ar|gument would be unan&s;werable: but, alas! tho&s;e times are no more. Oaths on the Evangeli&s;ts are, in this <HI>enlightened</HI> age, little more than mockery.
<PB N="21" REF="030219_0022_0FE5265DB54511D8">
The members of the pre&s;ent Congre&s;s have every man of them &s;worn to maintain the Con&s;titution of the United States, and yet, how many of them do we &s;ee at this moment &s;training every faculty of the mind to render it null and void? what, then could be hoped from a Stenographer.</P>
<P>Were a perfect &s;tranger to li&s;ten to a debate he would contract a partiality for one &s;ide or the other, before it was half over. Every man in a popular government has his party; and who can &s;uppo&s;e that the Stenographer would not have his? It was &s;aid that the Hou&s;e had a check upon him, in their power to di&s;mi&s;s him from his office. But, this mu&s;t be done by a vote of the Hou&s;e, and there|fore it could be no defence for a member who had the misfortune to find him&s;elf in a minority.</P>
<P>Indeed, this power of di&s;mi&s;&s;ion is one of the wor&s;t parts of the plan; for, as the Stenographer would be loath to quit &s;o lucrative an employment, he would of nece&s;&s;ity be led to pre&s;erve a majority in his favour; and, what would be &s;o &s;ure a way of doing this as mi&s;repre&s;enting the &s;peeches of the minority? a member might complain; but the Stenographer, &s;ecure in his majority, would laugh at him. Thus might a man of talents and inte|grity be officially repre&s;ented as a fool or a knave, without having the po&s;&s;ibility of redre&s;s. In vain would he endeavour to ju&s;tify him&s;elf: the &s;worn Stenographer would be believed before him, and the Hou&s;e, by a &s;olemn deci&s;ion, would determine that he had &s;aid what he never dreamt of.</P>
<P>Should an officer like this ever enter the Hou&s;e, it is ea&s;y to for&s;ee that he will not be long wanted. The very &s;ight of &s;uch a tremendous umpire
<PB N="22" REF="030219_0023_0FE5269C6D288818">
would frighten away all freedom of &s;peech. It is true the members of the majority might prattle away, but tho&s;e of the other &s;ide would naturally look upon them&s;elves in the &s;ituation of a man who is making a depo&s;ition. One party only would dare to open their mouths. Where there is no op|po&s;ition there can be no debate, and, of cour&s;e no need of a Stenographer.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Smith's</HI> objection to citing the example of the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons on this occa&s;ion did not appear to me well founded. They permit no one to write down their words after them; yet I believe it will be allowed that their debates are very well reported, and this is a pretty good proof that an officer for that purpo&s;e is by no means nece&s;&s;ary,</P>
<P>This gentleman mentioned the officers of the <HI>Logography</HI> employed by the &s;econd National A&s;|&s;embly in France. Unfortunate in&s;tance! the French Con&s;titution, that <Q>ma&s;ter-piece of legi&s;|lation,</Q> which was to la&s;t as long as the round world, la&s;ted only ten months and ten days; and, among the engines by which it was de&s;troyed, the office of the Logography claims a con&s;picuous place. There were ten of the&s;e reporters. They wrote in the literal character: one took the fir&s;t &s;entence, another the &s;econd, and &s;o on. Ten men were much more difficult to warp and corrupt than one would be, and yet we ever &s;ee them the decided tools of the &s;tronge&s;t party. Members complained of mi&s;repre&s;entations, and had the &s;ati&s;|faction to &s;ee their complaints &s;till more disfigured than their &s;peeches. The con&s;equence was, the few real friends of the Con&s;titution were obliged to hold their tongues, and &s;uffer the inflamatory har|rangues
<PB N="23" REF="030219_0024_0FE52639D28B6BD8">
of their opponents to go forth among the people uncontradicted.</P>
<P>I never like to hear the examples of foreign go|vernments applied to our own, particularly the ex|amples of what is called the government of France. I was a&s;toni&s;hed that a gentleman of Mr. Smith's good &s;en&s;e and good intentions &s;hould hold up for our imitation, or even mention as an in&s;tance, one of the mo&s;t in&s;idious mea&s;ures of an A&s;&s;embly, who were guilty of every crime under heaven; who, after having repeatedly &s;worn to defend with their lives the inviolability of their &s;overeign, cooly planned an in&s;urrection to hurl him from his throne, afterwards made this very in&s;urrection the &s;ubject of an article of accu&s;ation again&s;t him, and decreed that their own <HI>perjury was a virtue!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mr. Lyman's</HI> hint for driving all the printers out of the hou&s;e, <HI>unle&s;s the re&s;olution pa&s;&s;ed,</HI> was a &s;triking in&s;tance of the domineering &s;pirit, which would infallibly have overborn any Stenographer who had been unfortunate enough to accept of the po&s;t.</P>
<P>This hint broke out, &s;ome days after, in the form of a re&s;olution, from the lips of <HI>Mr. Heath</HI> of Virginia.&mdash;<Q><HI>Re&s;olved, that, until a Stenogra|pher be appointed, or further provi&s;ion made for taking the debates of this Hou&s;e,</HI> no printer be permitted to publi&s;h ab&s;tracts of the &s;peeches of mem|bers, unle&s;s permitted by members making the &s;ame.</Q> This was the &s;ub&s;tance of the re&s;olution, and a curious one it is.</P>
<P>The&s;e gentlemen &s;eem to have been determined to force their harrangues, at full length, down
<PB N="24" REF="030219_0025_0FE526A30B50F130">
our throats, or to keep us in a &s;ort of political &s;tarvation. We mu&s;t either &s;wallow them by do|zens of yards, as buffoons do ribbons, or we mu&s;t never have a ta&s;te.</P>
<P>I wonder where Mr. Lyman learnt a doctrine like this. Such an idea could certainly never be engendered in the free temperate air of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts. As to the gentleman from Virginia I am not &s;urprized; for, we know that, when a &s;ulky negro will not lick up his me&s;s clean, however in&s;ipid, di&s;gu&s;ting and nau&s;eous it may be, he is muzzled till his &s;tomach comes to. But, are we Penn&s;ylva|nians to be treated thus?&mdash;No, no, Mr. Heath; when you get the government on the other &s;ide of the Potomack, you may, and undoubtedly will, do what you plea&s;e with it; but we have four years to live, at any rate; be not in &s;uch ha&s;te to muzzle us then.</P>
<P>Should this re&s;olution ever reach the other &s;ide of the Atlantic, what idea will it give the Engli&s;h patriots of our liberty of the pre&s;s? If a mem|ber of the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons were to pro|po&s;e &s;uch a tyrannical re&s;olution, I &s;hould not wonder to hear of his being &s;toned to death. Not publi&s;h ab&s;tracts from &s;peeches without particular permi&s;&s;ion! The idea was certainly imported from the borders of the <HI>Palus Meotis.</HI></P>
<P>Had the&s;e two gentlemen re&s;tricted the prohibiti|on to their <HI>own &s;peeches,</HI> I believe that neither the Hou&s;e nor the public would have cared much about the matter; for neither of them is of the Ci|ceronian &s;tamp. It is ob&s;ervable, that tho&s;e who appeared mo&s;t anxious for the appointment of a Stenographer, if we except one or two, are among&s;t the few who&s;e &s;peeches can do them no &s;ort of cre|dit

with any party. This is the way of the world. Animals, whether endued with the faculty of &s;peech or not, &s;eem to fly in the face of nature. The ug|ly woman is everla&s;tingly at her gla&s;s: the owl thought her frightful brood the prettie&s;t little crea|tures in the world; and the in&s;ipid orator, while his voice is drowned in the hemmings, coughings and &s;norings of his drow&s;y audience, thinks he is uttering &s;entences that ought to be written in let|ters of gold.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved in the cour&s;e of the debate, that, if the printers committed errors, gentlemen might write out their &s;peeches and &s;end them to the pre&s;s. To this Mr. Nichols replied, that he was above do|ing any &s;uch thing.&mdash;For my part, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that, were I capable of making a &s;peech, I &s;hould be too lazy to write it out for the News-Papers; but as to its being beneath a law-giver, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing; for we have an example before our eyes of a folio orator in the Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly of Penn&s;ylvania, who is &s;o far from thinking it be|neath him to write out his &s;peeches, that he even reads them from his &s;eat, like a &s;chool-boy from his bench. I allude here to one <HI>Doctor Morpheus,</HI> who, finding his neighbours determined not to die under his hands, is now endeavouring to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the State. The State, however, &s;eems to partake of the ob&s;tinacy of his neighbours, turning a deaf ear to all his pre&s;criptions. The bolus of &s;edition which he had kneaded up for the A&s;&s;embly, did, indeed, at fir&s;t, operate as a provocative on &s;ome of the members from Whi&s;kyland; but, luckily, the &s;oporific qualities of it &s;oon became predominant, and, at la&s;t, ab&s;olutely irre&s;i&s;tible. At the end of the &s;econd paragraph the Chairman was perceived to yawn, the third rocked him off, and the fourth laid the whole A&s;&s;embly fa&s;t a&s;leep. The fifth

reached the door-keeper, at the further end of the pa&s;&s;age, and before the &s;ixth was half fini&s;hed, an old woman who fells apples at the gate, dropped from her &s;tool. The political <HI>Morpheus</HI> continued to &s;pread his poppies, till, perceiving the effects of his bolus, he &s;lunk off home to his liver nippy and &s;our cront.&mdash;Should this quack in politicks as well as phy&s;ick be &s;uffered to continue his lectures, the A&s;&s;embly of Penn&s;ylvania may write over their doors, as the French do over tho&s;e of their burying grounds: "This is the place of everla&s;ting &s;leep."</P>
<P>After this little trip to the Land of Nod, let us return to our Stenographer.</P>
<P>I by no means call in que&s;tion the virtue of Mr. Robert&s;on, the officer propo&s;ed: on the contrary, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e his virtue mu&s;t be very high; for, like that of Fielding's po&s;t-boy, it is very high priced.

<HEAD>DEBATE ON HALF AN HOUR'S ADJOURN|MENT.
<DATE>February 22nd.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>This was the Birth-Day of <HI>General Wa&s;hington.</HI> The morning was remarkably fair: the firmament decked in its brighte&s;t robes. May it ever be &s;o! Never, never may a cloud darken this au&s;picious day!</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="030219_0029_0FE526BC347F1A28">The city was all alive: joy &s;eemed to gli&s;ten in every face; the workman had thrown by his ham|mer and the hou&s;ewife her needle, to celebrate this fe&s;tival of valour, wi&s;dom, and true patrioti&s;m. I was going, among hundreds of others, to &s;ee the cannons of the &s;tate fired on this joyful occa&s;ion, when, pa&s;&s;ing by the Hou&s;e where the Repre&s;enta|tives meet, I perceived the doors open. I thought I would ju&s;t &s;tep in, and &s;ee what they were about, I entered, found the gallery quite empty, and was &s;urprized not to find the hou&s;e empty al&s;o. This &s;urprize &s;oon gave way to indignation, as the rea|der will readily believe, when he hears what was pa&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Smith</HI> (from South Carolina) moved, that the Hou&s;e adjourn for <HI>half an hour,</HI> in order to give the mem|bers an opportunity of congratulating the Pre&s;ident of the United States on the return of his Birth-Day.</P>
<P>Strange to tell! this motion was oppo&s;ed. The ground of this oppo&s;ition was, that it was the duty of the Hou&s;e fir&s;t to attend to the di&s;charge of their legi&s;lative functions, before they attended to the paying of compliments. It was &s;aid, on the other hand, that it had been the practice, ever &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the general government, for the Hou&s;e to make a &s;hort adjournment, for the pur|po&s;e mentioned in the motion.</P>
<P>After &s;ome conver&s;ation in this way, <HI>Mr. Gal|latin</HI> (from <HI>Geneva,</HI> la&s;t from <HI>Whi&s;kyland</HI>) moved, that the words, <HI>"half an hour,"</HI> be &s;truck out,</P>
<P>This amendment was rejected. The motion was then put, and lo&s;t.</P>

<P><PB N="29" REF="030219_0030_0FE5273B14D757A8">Thus was it determined, by a majority of twelve, to withhold from the Pre&s;ident a &s;light compliment, which he had been accu&s;tomed to receive from the Hou&s;e, from the fir&s;t year of its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>I was but too right in &s;aying, that, at the open|ing of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, <Q>he &s;aw, even among tho&s;e to whom he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, numbers, who, to repay all his labours, all his anxious cares for their welfare, were ready to pre&s;ent him the cup of humiliation filled to the brim.</Q></P>
<P>It was <HI>Mr. Parker,</HI> the <HI>blooming</HI> and <HI>accompli&s;h|ed</HI> Mr. Parker, the <HI>hone&s;t</HI> and <HI>virtuous</HI> Mr. Parker of the <HI>free</HI> State of Virginia, who is as punctual in the di&s;charge of his legi&s;lative functions as his con|&s;tituents are in the di&s;charge of their debts: it was this celebrated gentleman, who opened the career, by a motion for not waiting on the Pre&s;ident with an an&s;wer to his &s;peech to both Hou&s;es. Mr. Park|er was, without doubt, per&s;uaded of the truth of John&s;on's maxim:
<Q><L>"Fate never wounds more deep the <HI>gen'rous heart,</HI></L>
<L>"Than when a <HI>blockhead's in&s;ult</HI> points the dart."</L></Q></P>
<P>The excu&s;e, <Q>that it was the duty of the Hou&s;e fir&s;t to attend to the di&s;charge of their legi&s;lative func|tions,</Q> was the mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;ubterfuge, that ever i&s;&s;ued from the lips of malevolence. <HI>Half an hour</HI> only was a&s;ked for. Heavens! How many half hours have been idled away this very &s;e&s;&s;ion!&mdash; The Speaker &s;ends word that he is <HI>indi&s;po&s;ed.</HI>&mdash;Ad|journ!

the "di&s;charge of their legi&s;lative functions?" Yet, this was not done, nor, I believe, propo&s;ed; though &s;ome one of the&s;e fifty indefatigable mem|bers were certainly pre&s;ent. How differently do men &s;ee the &s;ame object, under different circum|&s;tances! the Speaker's head-ache adjourns the Hou&s;e for whole days. But, <HI>half an hour,</HI> a poor thir|ty minutes, was too precious to be wa&s;ted in a re|&s;pectful compliment to the be&s;t man, perhaps, this day exi&s;ting in the world!</P>
<P>The gentleman from <HI>Whi&s;kyland</HI> was, without doubt, afraid, that the motion would not be reject|ed altogether. He imagined the Hou&s;e had not &s;o far got the better of all decency, as to come to an unqualified determination not to wait on the Pre&s;i|dent, he therefore propo&s;ed to leave out the words, <HI>"half an hour."</HI> If this amendment had pa&s;&s;ed, the Hou&s;e would have adjourned, not for <HI>half an hour,</HI> but for the whole day; but then it would have &s;eemed that they did it for their own plea&s;ure and recreation, and not for the purpo&s;e of compli|menting General Wa&s;hington, the only thing that Mr. Gallatin &s;eems to have been afraid of.</P>
<P>This propo&s;ed amendment is an excellent ex|planation of the ambiguous excu&s;e, <Q>that it was the duty of the Hou&s;e fir&s;t to attend to the di&s;|charge of their legi&s;lative functions.</Q> What! would their duty permit them to &s;eparate for <HI>the whole day,</HI> and not permit them to &s;eparate for <HI>half an hour?</HI> the&s;e gentlemen &s;eem to count time as the French do their a&s;&s;ignats; a thirtieth part is more valuable than the whole. Mr. Gallatin appears to have &s;corned the &s;ubterfuge. No matter how much time was &s;pent, or in what manner, &s;o that it was
<PB N="31" REF="030219_0032_0FE526A9E02F49D0">
not for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of waiting on the Pre|&s;ident; &s;o that the in&s;ult was rendered acute.</P>
<P>What mu&s;t have been the Pre&s;ident's reflections, when he read the &s;ketch of this debate? an intrud|ing foreigner, a mere adventurer, who never &s;at his foot in the United States, until long after the revolution, comes here to arraign the conduct of General Wa&s;hington, to alienate the affections of the people from him, while he ba&s;ks in the &s;un&s;hine of his government, and reaps the fruits of his val|our and his wi&s;dom. And, what are the &s;ervices Mr. Gallatin ever rendered America? is this que|&s;tion nece&s;&s;ary? where is the man who does not recollect the alarm, the di&s;tre&s;s, cau&s;ed by the We&s;tern In&s;urrection? the million and a half of dollars that it co&s;t the Union, be&s;ides immen&s;e pri|vate &s;acrifices? fifteen thou&s;and men forced from their bu&s;ine&s;s and their homes, to undergo one of the mo&s;t fatiguing marches ever performed, and which many of them did not &s;urvive, cannot alrea|dy be forgotten. A&s;k any of the&s;e men; a&s;k the families, the widows and orphans, of tho&s;e who lo&s;t their lives in this expedition, what are the &s;er|vices Mr. Gallatin has rendered their country. And yet this man now rai&s;es his head among the legi&s;lators of the United States, and refu&s;es thirty minutes of re&s;pect to the very man, to who&s;e leni|ty, to who&s;e <HI>amne&s;ty</HI> alone he owes, that he is now in a &s;ituation to in&s;ult him.</P>
<P>When I compare the determination of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of this day, with their conduct and that of the people, at the time of the Pre&s;ident's in&s;tallation, I blu&s;h for them.&mdash;His journey from his &s;eat in Virginia to New York, was almo&s;t one continued triumphal entry. As he approached the towns, he found the road decked with laurel and
<PB N="32" REF="030219_0033_0FE5263CD5C906C0">
&s;trewed with flowers. Sometimes he was hailed with the firing of cannon, at others with the ring|ing of bells, and every where with the &s;houts of the multitude. Proce&s;&s;ions were formed to con|duct him, the magi&s;trates, the military, men of all trades, companies of matrons and choirs of white-robed virgins. It were vain to attempt an account of the fe&s;tivals, balls, galas, fireworks, illuminati|ons, mottos, &s;onnets, and odes, in honour of the "Saviour of his Country."&mdash;<Q>Merit (&s;aid one of his panegyri&s;ts on this occa&s;ion)</Q> Merit mu&s;t be great indeed, <Q>when it can call forth &s;uch hon|ours from a free and enlightened people. Hon|ours due to a man, who&s;e life has been one &s;e|ries of labours, which are upon a &s;cale that hea|ven never before a&s;&s;igned to mortal. <HI>Future ge|nerations</HI> will &s;ay of him with the poet:</Q>
<Q><L>"So near perfection, that he &s;tood</L>
<L>"Upon the bound'ry line</L>
<L>"Of finite from <HI>infinite good,</HI></L>
<L>"Of human from <HI>divine.</HI>"</L></Q></P>
<P>Will "future generations" believe, that, in le&s;s than &s;even years after this unbounded &s;train of pa|negyric was in vogue, the Repre&s;entatives of the people came to a formal determination, that <HI>half an hour</HI> was too much to be wa&s;ted in congratu|lating this &s;ame man on the return of his Birth-Day?</P>
<P>When the Pre&s;ident fir&s;t accepted the honoura|ble po&s;t he now fills, what was the &s;tate of this country? Suffice it to &s;ay, that it was &s;uch as ex|cited &s;hame at home and contempt from abroad. His acceptance of the Pre&s;idency in&s;pired a kind of national joy; it was the pre&s;age of a pro&s;perity that
<PB N="33" REF="030219_0034_0FE5273C9A47C498">
was to heal the wounds of a long and tire&s;ome &s;tate of di&s;credit and confu&s;ion. The people clung to him as the anchor of their hope: and, have they been deceived? Have not the riches and pro&s;perity of the whole country far out&s;tripped what could be hoped for by the mo&s;t &s;anguine? More has been accompli&s;hed in the &s;hort &s;pace of &s;even years, under the Federal government than was accompli&s;hed in an age, under any other go|vernment in the world. If, then, the Pre&s;ident merited &s;uch high eulogiums, at the time of his tak|ing on him the admini&s;tration of this government, what does he merit now? Certainly he does not merit to be in&s;ulted. Certainly <HI>thirty minutes</HI> of adjournment would not have been too much for a man, who, a few years ago, <Q>&s;tood upon the boundary line between human and divine good|ne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>Do the gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;enta|tives recollect, that not only our eyes but the eyes of the world are on them? What will other nati|ons &s;ay to us? What will Europeans, who look on General Wa&s;hington as the fir&s;t of mankind, and who have heard and admired all our prai&s;es be&s;towed on him, what will they think of us and our Repre&s;entatives, when they are told of this thir|ty minutes deci&s;ion. We have often boa&s;ted that our Pre&s;ident was happier than any monarch upon earth, as reigning in the hearts of a free people. I hope this tone will cea&s;e, until we take effectual mea&s;ures to guard him again&s;t future indignities. When a king is in&s;ulted, we &s;ee all the worthy part of his &s;ubjects pre&s;s forward to the throne with a&s;|&s;urances of their love and e&s;teem, and pledging their lives and fortunes for his &s;ecurity. Here a certain torpidity &s;eems to pervade all this cla&s;s of &s;ociety: if their wi&s;hes are kind and &s;incere, they
<PB N="34" REF="030219_0035_0FE52669842D9480">
are u&s;ele&s;s, as long as they do not break out into action.</P>
<P>But, it would be unju&s;t not to &s;ay, that this de|ci&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, was very far from being &s;anctioned by the voice of the peo|ple. That voice breathed &s;entiments very different from tho&s;e of the oppo&s;ers of Mr. Smith's motion for an adjournment; and of this the Hou&s;e had a &s;triking and humiliating proof.&mdash;For my part, the motion was no &s;ooner lo&s;t than I quitted the Gallery, boiling with indignation, and went to par|take in the jollity of the day; but, the next morning, I had the &s;atisfaction of reading the fol|lowing extracts from the debates, that took place in my ab&s;ence. <Q><HI>Mr. Nichols,</HI> &s;ays the reporter, offered his ob&s;ervations on the bill; but, from the firing of cannon, beating of drums, ringing of bells, and huzzas, <HI>in honour of the Pre&s;ident's Birth-Day,</HI> it was impo&s;&s;ible to hear what he &s;aid.</Q></P>
<P>Nothing on earth was ever more apropos than this. How mu&s;t the oppo&s;ers of the motion have felt? &s;omething like a king of England, when he heard the &s;houts of his &s;oldiers for the acquittal of the bi&s;hops, who&s;e di&s;grace and ruin he had con|templated. If ever malice met its true reward, it was at this moment. As if the people had &s;aid: <Q>you have aimed a blow at the reputation of our friend and father: you wi&s;h to per&s;uade us, that he is no longer worthy of our love and veneration; but you &s;hall not &s;ucceed. He is as dear to us as ever. You may continue your harrangues; but we will drown your voices with our accla|mations for the return of the happy day, that gave him to the world.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="030219_0036_0FE5274B3A92B488">It is with triumphant &s;atisfaction I ob&s;erve, that the 22nd of February was never &s;o honoured as this year. Every State, every town in the Union, re|&s;ounded with fe&s;tivity and joy. The city of Phila|delphia, ever di&s;tingui&s;hed for its attachment to the Pre&s;ident, &s;eemed truly &s;en&s;ible of the trea&s;ure it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.

<HEAD>DEBATE ON THE BILL AUTHORIZING A LOAN FOR THE USE OF THE CITY OF WASHINGTON.
<DATE>February 23rd.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>This debate was very long, and rather unintere&s;ting; but, as I mean to &s;peak on it my&s;elf, I cannot with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|dour refu&s;e to give a &s;ketch of what was &s;aid by o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> two of my opponents, to enable the reader to judge be|tween us.</P>
<P>Mr. SWANWICK (who &s;poke on the &s;ame &s;ide that I &s;hall do) &s;aid, that he objected to the bill generally upon the &s;ame ground as ye&s;terday, with re&s;pect to joining the &s;ecurities of the lots and the faith of the United States to|gether. He a&s;ked how the pa&s;&s;ing of this bill could give value to the buildings of the Federal City? Is it not, &s;aid he, already enacted that Congre&s;s &s;hall fit there in the year 1801? The value of the lots, he &s;aid, was to be increa&s;ed only by the &s;elling them to a number of per|&s;ons. The city mu&s;t owe its pro&s;perity to its peculiar ad|vantages as a commercial &s;pot, and not from its being the &s;eat of government. It was, therefore, the intere&s;t of the United States to &s;ell the lots and induce the people to &s;et|tle there. The higher price the lots bore, the greater would be the ob&s;tacles to &s;ettlement. If it was the inten|tion of the United States to grant money for the completion of the buildings let the Hou&s;e &s;ay &s;o. When it was fir&s;t propo&s;ed to remove the government to the Federal city, it was &s;aid that it would be the intere&s;t of per&s;ons to give lots to encourage the government to come there. The &s;ecu|rity now a&s;ked for was never contemplated. He had, however, no objection to the United States granting money, but he was again&s;t the making of two loans, one on the credit of the United States, and another on that of the United States, and certain lots.</P>
<P>Mr. BRENT (from Virginia) &s;aid, that it had been ob|&s;erved, that if the lots be a &s;ufficient &s;urety for the loan, why guaranty it? at pre&s;ent, he &s;aid, the lots were not &s;ufficient. Mr. Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;erved, <HI>that the bill before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">

con&s;idered as the touch&s;tone to determine whether the &s;eat of govern|ment will go to the banks of the Potomack, or not.</HI> Motives of poli|cy and economy, and objections to increa&s;ing the public debt, will not apply in this ca&s;e; the very act provides funds to guaranty the loan, for though the property, until the propo&s;ed loan be guarantied, would &s;ell for <HI>a mere trifle,</HI> when it is <HI>guarantied,</HI> it will &s;ell for a <HI>great price;</HI> &s;o great a difference would it make, that he believed property which will then &s;ell for two millions of dollars, would not otherwi&s;e be worth 100,000 dollars. If, therefore, gen|tlemen are again&s;t the bill from economical views, they are mi&s;taken; for, it was his opinion, that the property would not only pay off the loan, but eventually <HI>be a con&s;i|derable fund towards the di&s;charge of the public debt.</HI> It had been &s;ugge&s;ted that the United States were under no ob|ligation to make this guarantee. He thought differently; he believed the credit of the United States materially con|cerned. The public have relied fully upon the counte|nance of government in the bu&s;ine&s;s, many per&s;ons, in|deed, have made great &s;acrifices to procure lots in this new city, and, if after holding out temptations to people, government &s;hould not go there at the propo&s;ed time, all the&s;e per&s;ons will be ruined, and <HI>a &s;tain will be laid on the national character.</HI> He hoped, therefore, no objection would be made to carrying the bill into effect.</P>
<P>Mr. GILES (from Virginia) wi&s;hed to remark on what had fallen from a member from Penn&s;ylvania ye&s;terday, with re|&s;pect to the law providing for the removal of the &s;eat of go|vernment. <HI>That law, he &s;aid, differed from all others.</HI> The Con&s;titution it&s;elf, he &s;aid, pre&s;cribes the rule, the act only fixes the &s;pot where it &s;hould be carried into effect. <HI>The act is, therefore, not repealable.</HI> The Con&s;titution does not give a power to fix upon two &s;pots, but upon one &s;pot. He thought it nece&s;&s;ary to make this remark, le&s;t he might be &s;uppo&s;ed to countenance the opinion he comba|ted. It had been remarked, that it would be in &s;ome de|gree degrading to the United States, to borrow money on the credit of lots; he thought differently, and &s;hewed that it was a common thing in governments to borrow money on different funds. It had been wi&s;hed to di&s;connect the government from the bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;whil&s;t government guarantied the loan, he &s;aid, it would make no difference
<PB N="38" REF="030219_0039_0FE526AD58A91858">
whether the loan was bottomed on the lots or otherwi&s;e. The nature of the engagement was the &s;ame. The que|&s;tion was whether the Hou&s;e would agree to guaranty the loan, or not.</P>
<P>Mr. GILES &s;aid, that he had &s;een and was acquainted with the buildings carrying on in the Federal city. He thought <HI>the hou&s;e erecting for the re&s;idence of the Pre&s;ident was much too magnificent,</HI> much more &s;o than was intend|ed. Every one thought &s;o who &s;aw it; but this was no rea&s;on for ob&s;tructing the progre&s;s of the bu&s;ine&s;s. He hoped the bill would be formed in a manner &s;o as to meet the general &s;en&s;e of the Hou&s;e. Though he had <HI>objected to the grandeur of the hou&s;e intended for the Pre&s;ident,</HI> he would have the buildings <HI>for congre&s;s erected on a grand &s;cale, and fitted for the repre&s;entatives of a great and free peo|ple.</HI></P>
<P>The Bill was finally recommitted.</P>

You will not therefore ex|pect from me the wily &s;ophi&s;try of a G&mdash;tin, the quibbling of a G&mdash;les, the verbo&s;ity of a B&mdash;win, or the patriotic bomba&s;t of a Liv&mdash;ton.</P>
<P>It is &s;eldom, Sir, that I trouble the Hou&s;e with my &s;entiments on any que&s;tion whatever. There are &s;o many gentlemen among us, who are &s;peechi|fiers by profe&s;&s;ion, who deck every &s;ubject, howe|ver &s;terile and trifling, with all the flowers of the
<PB N="39" REF="030219_0040_0FE5266B62153070">
garden of eloquence, that a plain &s;poke&s;man like me can have little chance of being heard with any degree of patience. On the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, how|ever, the&s;e gentlemen do not &s;eem to be come, like the bee, loaded with &s;weets; the few they have brought with them are already &s;cattered abroad, and have lo&s;t their fragrance: and, as the day is not yet far enough advanced to countenance an adjournment, permit me to hope for indulgence, while I humbly endeavour to &s;pin out the time be|tween this and dinner; or, as our ploughmen have it, while I take a gentle turn to wind down the &s;un.</P>
<P>Should gentlemen find them&s;elves inclined to repo&s;e, as I have often been in li&s;tening to them, I beg them not to &s;tand upon ceremony, but to loll back at their ea&s;e, and leave me to jog qui|etly on.</P>
<P>We are called upon, Sir, to <HI>guaranty</HI> a loan, for which the lots of the City of Wa&s;hington are to be a <HI>&s;ecurity;</HI> and the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Brent, tells us, that, though the lots are at pre&s;ent worth but a <HI>mere trifle,</HI> they will, when guarantied, be of <HI>great value.</HI> This is rather ob|&s;cure, I &s;hall therefore endeavour to explain it by compari&s;on; which, I make no doubt, I &s;hall do to the &s;atisfaction of the Hou&s;e. Suppo&s;e I had a lot, not worth a bra&s;s farthing, and was to draw a note payable out of the produce of this &s;ame lot, &s;uch note would be worth but a <HI>"mere trifle;"</HI> but, when endor&s;ed by a man of credit, it would be <HI>"of great value;"</HI> becau&s;e the holder would al|ways know where to look for payment.</P>
<P>But the friends of the guarantee do not &s;top here. They a&s;&s;ure us, that it would render the
<PB N="40" REF="030219_0041_0FE5271DE5AE1A58">
lots &s;o very valuable as to <Q>create a con&s;iderable fund towards the di&s;charge of the public debt!</Q> Much as I wi&s;h to &s;ee that debt di&s;charged, I by no means approve of its being done by taking ad|vantage of an over&s;trained genero&s;ity. The Vir|ginians have mo&s;t generou&s;ly be&s;towed part of the land, and, not content with that, they now offer us an opportunity of paying off the public debt with &s;peculations in the lots. I am one of tho&s;e who are willing to forego any and every offer of this kind. I am willing that the Virginians them&s;elves &s;hould be permitted to guaranty this loan, and re|ceive exclu&s;ively all the immen&s;e advantages accru|ing therefrom. Let them undertake the negocia|tion upon their own bottom, which, from the great credit they enjoy in foreign countries, they cannot fail to effect upon the mo&s;t rea&s;onable terms.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that foreigners will not venture their money on the lots, becau&s;e they can form no idea of their value; neither can I, and this is another rea&s;on for my wi&s;hing to leave the bu&s;ine&s;s in the hands of tho&s;e who are upon the &s;pot, and who &s;eem to be the only per&s;ons intere&s;ted in the matter.</P>
<P>The gentleman, who made us the bounteous propo&s;al for paying off the public debt by the means of the guarantee, concluded with an argument, which, I believe, he conceived to carry more weight with it: that is; unle&s;s the government went to the City of Wa&s;hington at the time &s;pecified by the act, it would be <HI>"a &s;tain on the national character."</HI>&mdash; I participate with Mr. Brent in his anxiety for our national character, and am glad to have it in my power to convince him, that it could be in no dan|ger from the di&s;appointment he &s;eems &s;o much afraid of. We &s;ee a very con&s;iderable State of the
<PB N="41" REF="030219_0042_0FE5272CCD5D0928">
Union, Sir, tenaciou&s;ly adhering to a law, made expre&s;sly to &s;kreen its citizens from the obligation of di&s;charging their ju&s;t debts; and we have &s;een this very Hou&s;e pa&s;s a re&s;olution for the &s;eque&s;tration of all debts, due from Americans to their creditors in Great Britain. Neither of the&s;e has ever been called a &s;tain on our national character; and, if the&s;e are not, if our character is proof again&s;t the&s;e, I imagine we have little to fear from the go|vernments' remaining at Philadelphia. I will men|tion another in&s;tance, Sir, &s;till &s;tronger. If we look back into the journals of Congre&s;s, we &s;hall find the king of France &s;tiled, our <HI>great</HI> and <HI>good ally,</HI> our <HI>friend</HI> and <HI>deliverer;</HI> and yet we have applauded his murd................ [there the Chairman would have called me to or|der, upon which I &s;hould have &s;aid]&mdash;Sir, I &s;hould be &s;orry to break through the rules of this Hou&s;e; and, I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t that I am perfectly in order. The gentleman from Virginia had laid great &s;tre&s;s on what he pre&s;umed would be a &s;tain on our natio|nal character. I looked upon my&s;elf as entitled to prove, that he was mi&s;taken; and I certainly had a right to do this, by bringing forward what I con|ceived to be much better calculated to impre&s;s a &s;tain, and which, however, had not produced that effect. If, therefore, there was any deviation from the que&s;tion, the gentleman led the way, and I was only following him. Be&s;ides, Sir, look over the debates of this Hou&s;e, and you will &s;ee to what a nut-&s;hell compa&s;s they will be reduced, if you exclude all the extraneous matter. If members are to be bound down to the &s;imple que&s;tion before them, if no latitude of digre&s;&s;ion is allowed of, no little rambles to France for eulogium and to Great Britain for invective, how do you imagine, Sir, that <HI>patriotic</HI> members would be able to give proofs
<PB N="42" REF="030219_0043_0FE5266CE4BE6EE0">
of their diligence, by eking out the &s;e&s;&s;ion to &s;ix or &s;even months?&mdash;Your a&s;&s;ent, Sir, to the ju&s;t|ne&s;s of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, encourages me to take up the thread of my argument.</P>
<P>If, on the day of our pompous reception of the French Flag, poor murdered Louis had ri&s;en up through the floor, and &s;aid: <Q>Ungrateful Ameri|cans! you who flattered me in the hour of my pro&s;perity and your di&s;tre&s;s; you who called me your deliverer; you who made public rejoicings for the day of my nativity, are now joining hands with the very men who led me to the block; are expre&s;&s;ing "your &s;incere and lively &s;en&s;ibili|ty, your &s;ympathy and affection" towards them; are giving a pompous reception to the emblems of their triumph over me, at the very moment that my portrait, which was to be the memento of my &s;ervices and of your gratitude, is hang|ing up within your walls.</Q>&mdash;If the &s;pectre of this injured prince had thus &s;poken, what &s;hould we have &s;aid? I know a member who would have replied: Avaunt, "ermined mon&s;ter!" But, for my part, I &s;hould have felt the &s;tain: I &s;hould have thought my&s;elf &s;potted as a leopard. And yet, Sir, this has never been mentioned as a &s;tain on our na|tional character. To apprehend, therefore, any danger from our not removing to the banks of the Patomack, is to &s;train at a gnat, while we &s;wallow a giant.</P>
<P>Much has been &s;aid, Sir, on the manner in which the buildings of the City of Wa&s;hington have been conducted. This is a branch of the &s;ubject that I &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence, had it not been for an expre&s;&s;ion or two that fell from another gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Giles. That gentleman
<PB N="43" REF="030219_0044_0FE526FE282FC7E0">
ob&s;erved, that <Q>the hou&s;e erecting for the re&s;idence of the Pre&s;ident was <HI>much too magnificent;</HI>" but that, though he <HI>objected to the grandeur</HI> of the hou&s;e intended for <HI>the Pre&s;ident,</HI> he would have the buildings <HI>for Congre&s;s</HI> erected upon a <HI>grand &s;cale,</HI> and fitted for the <HI>Repre&s;entatives</HI> of a <HI>great</HI> and <HI>free people.</HI></Q>&mdash;I do not choo&s;e, Sir, to let this &s;ally go abroad unnoticed, le&s;t the world &s;hould imagine us all tainted with that ungovernable vani|ty, which &s;eems to have engro&s;&s;ed the &s;oul of our unfortunate colleague.</P>
<P>The gentleman is afraid that the hou&s;e of the Pre&s;ident may be <HI>too magnificent;</HI> but that which he expects to occupy <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> he wi&s;hes to &s;ee upon a <HI>grand &s;cale</HI>&mdash;Mode&s;t man! The Pre&s;ident is to be kept within the walls of a plain building, to remind him of the lowline&s;s of his e&s;tate, of his being the <HI>&s;ervant</HI> of the public; while Mr. Giles is to &s;trut beneath the roof of buildings upon a <HI>grand &s;cale,</HI> fitted for the <HI>Repre&s;entatives</HI> of a <HI>great people;</HI> or, in other words, for the <HI>great Repre&s;entatives</HI> of the people.</P>
<P>I am thinking, Sir, that the public will do well to keep <HI>us</HI> within a plain building, or I am afraid our heads will &s;oon be turned. We are in ab&s;olute need of being dieted, for we are gra&s;ping not only at all honour but at all power too. If we once enter the pile propo&s;ed by our colleague; if we once get under tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: corinthian columns and &s;tarry vaults, we &s;hall expect other things on a <HI>"grand &s;cale"</HI> al&s;o; we mu&s;t hvae our coaches-and-&s;ix, our led hor&s;es, our pages, our grooms, our hunt&s;|men and our buck-hounds; our villas, baths, &s;ofas and beds of &s;tate. We may expect, in due time, to hear the gentleman from Virginia propo&s;e a <HI>&s;e|raglio</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="030219_0045_0FE5272E5127C8E0">
as among the conveniences of the <Q><HI>Repre|pre&s;entatives</HI> of a <HI>great</HI> and <HI>free</HI> people.</Q></P>
<P>Much do I fear, Sir, that if we were once got in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the&s;e pretty things, we &s;hould be very loath to return to our humble dwellings and our homely fare. In &s;hort, I think we &s;hould do like the <HI>great Repre&s;entatives</HI> of the French; that is, declare our&s;elves permanent, or, at lea&s;t, order the people to elect nobody but our&s;elves, which amounts to exactly the &s;ame.</P>
<P>But, we are told, that this building upon a <HI>grand &s;cale,</HI> is not intended as an honour to us, but to our con&s;tituents. This is the very gull-trap which the poor &s;illy French have fallen into. Every thing that their grovelling low-bred tyrants have a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves, has been done under the &s;pecious pretext of doing honour <Q>to a <HI>great</HI> and <HI>free</HI> peo|ple.</Q> They have &s;cized on all the palaces in the kingdom, on the royal &s;tuds, coaches, and every other article of luxury, for their own exclu&s;ive u&s;e; they wallow in &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s, while their rag|ged &s;laves have but two or three ounces of dirty-coloured bread a day, and, if they murmur, they &s;hoot them down by thou&s;ands; and, all this is for the "honour of a <HI>great</HI> and <HI>free</HI> people." A great people, a free people, a &s;overeign people, and the like, are very pretty phra&s;es: they tickle the ears of the multitude; but, &s;hould they per|ceive how completely the demagogues transfer this grandeur, liberty, and &s;overeignty, to them&s;elves, perhaps they would cea&s;e to admire them; and no|thing &s;eems better calculated to open their eyes, than &s;eeing them in a &s;plendid palace, while they, many of them at lea&s;t, are obliged to put up with log-huts.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="030219_0046_0FE5266E66B4EF80">It is become a prevailing fa&s;hion, among the op|po&s;ers of our government, to confine the expre&s;|&s;ion, "Repre&s;entatives of the people," to this Hou&s;e only. But, Sir, is not this a very fal&s;e, as well as dangerous notion? Is not the Pre&s;ident the Repre&s;entative of the people as well as Mr. Giles? Yes, and of the whole of the people too, while Mr. Giles repre&s;ents but a very &s;mall part of one State. The epithet <HI>immediate</HI> is &s;ometimes prefix|ed; but then, Mr. Giles can be the <HI>immediate re|pre&s;entative</HI> of no more than an eighteenth part of the State of Virginia, while the Pre&s;ident is the im|mediate repre&s;entative of the whole Union; for the repre&s;entation mu&s;t ever be immediate, though the election may not. If therefore, a preference is due to any branch of the government, the Pre&s;i|dent &s;eems to have a better title to it than any of us, and &s;eeing the thing in this light, I cannot help looking upon the ob&s;ervation of the gentle|man from Virginia as extremely improper, if not indecent.</P>
<P>I thought, Sir, I heard the word <HI>Capitol</HI> menti|oned during the debate. For the love of mode&s;ty, I hope the Congre&s;s Hou&s;e is not to be called a <HI>Capitol!</HI> If this be the ca&s;e, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to go a &s;tep further, and a&s;&s;ume the ma&s;querade dre&s;s of the French Romans. How pretty we &s;hall look in long white robes, de&s;cending to our toes, a blue girdle about our wai&s;ts, a &s;carlet cloak on our &s;houlders, and a red liberty cap on our heads! Let them all be well embroidered with gold, as tho&s;e of the French legi&s;lators <HI>are to be;</HI> and, if they are even &s;et with precious &s;tones, it will be an ad|ditional proof of our jealou&s;y for the honour of "a <HI>great</HI> and <HI>free people.</HI>" We &s;hall, indeed, bring on us a ridicule equal to that excited by the
<PB N="46" REF="030219_0047_0FE52677A1C31100">
up&s;tart pettifoggers of the National A&s;&s;embly, when they in&s;i&s;ted on the Folding-Doors of the Louvre to be thrown open at their approach; but, let the world be merry while we are &s;wagg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring about in our con&s;ular robes, we &s;hall care but little whe|ther we are called ambitious buffoons or not.</P>
<P>This idea of a <HI>Capitol</HI> &s;eems to be borrowed from the State of Virginia, the A&s;&s;embly-Hou&s;e of which has taken that name. For what rea&s;on it was there adopted, I know not, unle&s;s it be, that there are &s;uch numbers of Cae&s;ars and Pompeys in the neighbourhood, again&s;t who&s;e ambitious pro|jects the grave and virtuous &s;enate are ever vigilant to pre&s;erve the liberty of their country. The <HI>Ca|pitol</HI> of Virginia re&s;embles that of Rome al&s;o, in that it has a <HI>&s;lave mart</HI> in its vicinity,</P>
<P>I &s;hall now, Sir, return to the propo&s;ed guaran|tee, and advert to another of the forcible argu|ments of Mr. Brent. <Q>This gentleman tells us, that the guarantee is the touch&s;tone to prove whether the &s;eat of government is to be removed or not.</Q> I am willing to take the gentleman at his word. I am willing to allow, that refu&s;ing the guarantee of the loan, will amount to a declaration of our wi&s;h to remain where we are; and, with this view, I &s;hall give the refu&s;al my hearty &s;upport..... [Here a loud cry of, hear him! hear him!]&mdash;I am glad to find, Mr. Chairman, that gentlemen are &s;o di&s;po&s;ed to hear; for, I can a&s;&s;ure them, that, what I have to &s;ay, is not only worth hearing, but attending to al&s;o.</P>
<P>I look forward, Sir, to the day of removing the government to the banks of the Potomack, as the dawn of its de&s;truction. Open the page of hi&s;tory,
<PB N="47" REF="030219_0048_0FE52647D99BF820">
and you will &s;ee, that the &s;ate of every popular go|vernment in a great mea&s;ure depends on the di&s;po|&s;ition of the people immediately in its neighbour|hood. I could cite you a thou&s;and examples, from the fall of the Grecian States down to our own times; but I &s;hall content my&s;elf with one of modern date; and, as the gentlemen on the other &s;ide of the Hou&s;e are &s;o fond of flying to France, I tru&s;t I &s;hall be excu&s;ed for doing the &s;ame.</P>
<P>When the Con&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly conceived the de&s;tructive project of annihilating the government, which their con&s;tituents had po&s;itively ordered them to aid and &s;trengthen, what did they do? Remo|ved them&s;elves to Paris, where they knew the great|e&s;t number of di&s;affected per&s;ons were a&s;&s;embled. The con&s;equences are but too well known.</P>
<P>We are not ignorant of the general di&s;po&s;ition of the State to which this government is to be re|moved. We have &s;een its legi&s;lature, during this very &s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;oliciting every State in the Union to join them in reducing this government to a mere democracy. Nor can any of us have forgotten the public invitation to the people of other States, to oppo&s;e the treaty with His Britannic Maje&s;ty by open force, boa&s;ting that there were <Q>a hun|dred thou&s;and free and independent Virginians,</Q> ready to &s;trike the fir&s;t blow. Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, then, if we were now a&s;&s;embled at the City of Wa&s;hington, that the&s;e hundred thou&s;and free and independent Virginians, whether black, white or yel|low, would not dictate to us all we &s;hould dare to &s;ay or do? Do you think, Sir, that the cutting truths which have this day fallen from my lips, would ever have been uttered in the City of Wa&s;h|ington?
<PB N="48" REF="030219_0049_0FE52691F1F64C68">
No; I &s;hould have expected to have my throat cut, or my eyes gouged out, by &s;ome &s;lave or &s;lave-dealer, before I got home to my dinner.

<P>Mr. GILES has told us, Sir, that the law for the removal of the &s;eat of government differs from all others; that <Q>the Con&s;titution it&s;elf has mark|ed the <HI>rule,</HI> and only left Congre&s;s to name the &s;pot; that the law is therefore not <HI>repealable.</HI></Q> Curious quibble!&mdash;The Con&s;titution &s;ays, that the Congre&s;s &s;hall <Q>exerci&s;e exclu&s;ive legi&s;lation over &s;uch di&s;trict as may become the &s;eat of government of the United States.</Q>&mdash;Now, what is there here, that makes the act unrepealable? What <HI>rule</HI> is here marked out? Is there a word about the law being unalterable? Does the Con&s;titution &s;ay, that when the di&s;trict is once fixed on, it &s;hall ne|ver be changed for another? There is &s;omething &s;o ridiculous in the idea, that one would wonder how it ever found its way into words; and, to hazard tho&s;e words, the gentleman mu&s;t have a very high opinion of the forbearance of this Hou&s;e. Suppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, the banks of the Potomack &s;hould be vi&s;ited with the plague or yellow fever; are we to remain there, and let our carca&s;&s;es be thrown into the river? Suppo&s;e a vulcano or earthquake, or, in &s;hort, &s;uppo&s;e what you will; are we yet bound to make the City of Wa&s;hing|ton the &s;eat of government? And what, I a&s;k, are plagues, yellow fevers, vulcanos and earthquakes, compared with the knives of "a hundred thou&s;and <HI>free</HI> and <HI>independent" &s;laves?</HI>&mdash;In a word, Mr. Chairman, &s;o fully am I convinced, that the re|moval
<PB N="49" REF="030219_0050_0FE527024D158490">
of the &s;eat of government to the State of Virginia will prove the overthrow of our happy Con&s;titution, and eventually plunge our country in anarchy and blood, that I &s;hall not only oppo&s;e every mea&s;ure that may accelerate the fatal epoch, but I pledge my&s;elf to bring forward a motion for the repeal of the act altogether.&mdash;And now, Sir, as I &s;ee the gentlemen from Virginia are bur&s;ting with reply, I &s;it down, &s;atisfied of having di&s;charg|ed my duty, without giving offence to any one, to who&s;e ears truth is not di&s;agreeable.</P>

The com|mittee have reported that they do not think it nece&s;&s;ary to adduce any particular in&s;tances in which American Seamen have been impre&s;&s;ed by foreign nations, the facts, they alledged, are too notorious to require particu|larizing. He could not &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e gentlemen would believe that the Hou&s;e could proceed to legi&s;late on un|certain new&s;paper reports. He tru&s;ted they would afford &s;ome proof who, what number, when, and where Ame|rican &s;eamen have been impre&s;&s;ed. Until this was done, he &s;hould doubt the fact.&mdash;He was heard, he believed, by Repre&s;entatives from every port in the United States, and if the fact was &s;o notorious as to need no further evi|dence, he doubted not &s;ome of the&s;e gentlemen would be able to give &s;ome account of the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>If the facts were e&s;tabli&s;hed, Mr. Harper believed there would be but one opinion on the propriety of grant|ing relief; but before they proceeded farther, &s;ome infor|mation was nece&s;&s;ary re&s;pecting the exi&s;tence of this abu&s;e. He had applied to the office of the Secretary of State, and to other offices likely to afford information on the &s;ubject; but he found no in&s;tance of the impre&s;&s;ment complained of, which redre&s;s had not been given. But, if any &s;uch in|&s;tances do exi&s;t, in which relief has been applied for, and not obtained, gentlemen from &s;ome of the &s;ea ports will be able to mention them. If not, he hoped the commit|tee would ri&s;e and recommit the report.</P>
<P>Mr. LIVINGSTON &s;aid, the pre&s;ent mea&s;ure was intend|ed to afford relief to &s;uch of their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed fellow citizens as had been illegally &s;eized on the high &s;eas. The gen|tleman, he &s;aid, who brings forward objections to the pro|po&s;ed enquiry, was in his place when the re&s;olution upon which the report of the committee is founded, pa&s;&s;ed un|animou&s;ly. Why did he not then come forward; [Mr. Harper &s;aid he was not in the Hou&s;e at the time.]&mdash;The re&s;olution does not direct the committee to enquire into facts, they were con&s;idered as notorious, and nothing
<PB N="52" REF="030219_0053_0FE5270A9C792F40">
&s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary but to fix upon the be&s;t mode of furni&s;h|ing relief. The Legi&s;lature of the United States have formerly had evidence, and they have acted upon it. If the gentleman will look into the proceedings of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s, he will find a con&s;iderable &s;um grant|ed to Mr. Cutting, for relief of this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed body of men. Some he relieved, others he did not. When the dignity of the nation, &s;aid he, is in&s;ulted, in the per&s;ons of our fellow-citizens, it is nece&s;&s;ary at lea&s;t to make enquiry in|to their &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>A remark had fallen, Mr. Living&s;ton &s;aid, from the member from South Carolina, which he wi&s;hed to notice. He &s;aid he had applied to the office of the Secretary of State, and found there no complaint which had not been redre&s;&s;ed. Now, he had waited upon the Secretary of State, as chairman of the committee, in vain for informa|tion on this &s;ubject. The Secretary informed him, that he could not give him the evidence which it appears he has given to the member from South Carolina. How, he wi&s;hed to know, happened it that a member who oppo&s;es the bu&s;i|ne&s;s in que&s;tion, &s;hould be furni&s;hed with that information which was denied to a member who &s;upported it?</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, added Mr. Living&s;ton, that we are attempting to legi&s;late without evidence. Though no facts are at pre|&s;ent before the Hou&s;e, it is notorious that numerous in|&s;tances have been made known to government, and the pre&s;ent mea&s;ure is meant to enquire into the ca&s;es of &s;uf|ferers and remedy them as far as po&s;&s;ible. It is admitted by the member from South Carolina that facts have ex|i&s;ted, but that they have been removed. If the&s;e griev|ances, then, &s;aid he, have exi&s;ted, let us prevent them in future. Let us not wait till it is too late to grant relief. The men, &s;aid he, who &s;uffer by the depradations com|plained of, are at a great di&s;tance from their homes and friends, in foreign ports; dragged on board Tenders, and made to experience every hard&s;hip which can be conceiv|ed. And now, when a mode is propo&s;ed for the relief of the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ed citizens, evidence is called for! <HI>If one of the&s;e men is confined in the Ea&s;t Indies, can evidence of his bon|dage be expected to be given here?</HI> Such hard&s;hips have ex|i&s;ted, and it was their bu&s;ine&s;s <HI>to prevent them from again
<PB N="53" REF="030219_0054_0FE526830EBFCD78">
occurring.</HI> He hoped, therefore, the committee would not ri&s;e, as he tru&s;ted there was &s;ufficient evidence on which to ground the enquiry.</P>
<P>Mr. HARPER wi&s;hed to remark on what had fallen from the member from New-York, on the Secretary of State's re|fu&s;ing information to certain members and giving it to o|thers. He applied to the office of the Secretary of State, to learn whether there were any documents there to &s;up|port the propo&s;ed enquiry, and was informed there were only two ca&s;es; in one of which application was made to the Briti&s;h government; <HI>four per&s;ons</HI> were &s;aid to have been impre&s;&s;ed; but on enquiry, it appeared, <HI>that two of them were Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, and the other two had enli&s;ted into the &s;ervice.</HI> The other complaint came to the office when the Secretary of State was much engaged in other concerns, but he believed relief was granted. This, he &s;aid, was verbal information; he had applied for written documents on the &s;ubject, and doubted not he &s;hould receive them as &s;oon as other bu&s;ine&s;s would permit.</P>
<P>Mr. SWANWICK (Penn&s;ylvania) &s;aid the member from S. Carolina had called for information; he conceived no particular information nece&s;&s;ary. He could mention an in&s;tance in which he had immediate concern. A ve&s;&s;el of his going to the We&s;t-Indies had all her hands taken out of her, and obliged to work the guns of an Engli&s;h fri|gate; and, on their expo&s;tulating that though they were pri&s;oners they did not wi&s;h to work the guns they were threatened with whipping, and the captain was told if he interfered, he &s;hould be whipped and <HI>&s;ent home</HI> to England in irons. If he had thought facts were wanting, by a &s;ingle adverti&s;ement in one of the Philadelphia papers, they would have been overpowered with facts. But if he had done &s;o, he &s;uppo&s;ed he &s;hould have been charged with rai&s;ing di&s;&s;atisfaction in the minds of the people, or with encouraging Jacobinical principles. He therefore did not do it. But, without going out of the walls of the Hou&s;e, he &s;aid, he found evidence &s;ufficient. He read an extract from the communication of the Secretary of State, dated March 2, 1794, in which were mentioned the repre&s;entations made by &s;undry merchants of Phila|delphia (of whom he was one) re&s;pecting the impre&s;&s;ment
<PB N="54" REF="030219_0055_0FE526CA91BBFA60">
of American &s;eamen. This document was thought &s;uf|ficiently &s;trong to make an article of in&s;truction to Mr. Jay in his late negociation; but, owing to certain difficulties, no &s;pecific agreement was entered into by him for their relief.</P>
<P>The plan now before the Hou&s;e, &s;aid Mr. Swanwick, is in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ded to remedy the difficulties which have been urged as o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">acles in this bu&s;ine&s;s, by opening regi&s;ters in which to enter every American &s;eaman, by which may be known at any time the number of &s;eamen belonging to the Uni|ted States, and by means of which every &s;uch &s;eaman would be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a certificate of his <HI>citizen&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P>Every one knows, &s;aid he, what has <HI>been felt</HI> on account of American &s;eamen carried into <HI>Algiers. No evidence was required with re&s;pect to their numbers, or how they were employed.</HI> The united exertions of the whole American people <HI>&s;eemed to cry out</HI> for their relea&s;ement, and the bu&s;i|ne&s;s, at length, has been effected. And let us not, &s;aid he, attend to our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed citizens, in one part only, but in all parts of the world. Let us not, &s;aid he, <HI>be too nice about evidence.</HI> The&s;e men are generally <HI>ignorant,</HI> and can|not give the nece&s;&s;ary information; he thought, however, they had information &s;ufficient for legi&s;lating upon in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. He hoped, therefore, the report would not be recommitted, until the committee had di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the bu|&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. TRACY (Connecticut) believed that every member in that Hou&s;e felt the propriety of extending the benefit of the laws to every cla&s;s of citizens, and to none more than to American &s;eamen. Some members &s;eemed to &s;uppo&s;e that the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of American &s;eamen have been looked upon with apathy, but if due attention had been paid to the efforts of government, it would have been &s;een that they had always been duly attended to. It is well known that great difficulties ari&s;e when it is attempted to di&s;tin|gui&s;h between <HI>Engli&s;h and American &s;eamen.</HI> This has been the rea&s;on why ample regulations have not always taken place. He hoped the government would be popu|lar, and that the new members in the Hou&s;e would a&s;&s;i&s;t the old ones to render it more and more &s;o; but thought
<PB N="55" REF="030219_0056_0FE52688F7D3BB98">
government ought not to be charged with apathy without paying due attention to what government had done.</P>
<P>Mr. TRACY proceeded to take notice of the re&s;olutions propo&s;ed in the report. He enquired what good the agent to be &s;ent to Great Britain would do. Are there &s;eamen, &s;aid he, employed but at one place? Had not the United States Con&s;uls at every port, and can they not do the bu|&s;ine&s;s? He wi&s;hed for information on the &s;ubject. <HI>A great part of the &s;eamen were foreigners,</HI> he &s;aid, and it would be very difficult to &s;eparate them. If the plan pro|po&s;ed, however, could be made to appear to be beneficial, he would heartily join in effecting the de&s;ired relief to the cla&s;s of citizens alluded to.</P>
<P>Mr. GOODHUE (Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts) &s;aid the member from New York, on bringing forward this bu&s;ine&s;s, had charg|ed government with looking upon the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Ame|rican &s;eamen with apathy, and <HI>blu&s;hed</HI> on account of its conduct towards them. He repre&s;ented, he believed, twenty times the number of American &s;eamen that that gentleman repre&s;ented; he was him&s;elf, indeed, formerly a &s;eaman; yet he did not believe the evil complained of exi&s;ted to any alarming degree. Mr. Cutting, it had been &s;aid, had relieved many &s;eamen; that it was in the year 1790. La&s;t &s;ummer the Briti&s;h took many ve&s;&s;els bound to France but they did not take the crews. There were &s;ome in&s;tances, he &s;aid, in which &s;eamen had been impre&s;|&s;ed, and he &s;hould be in favour of every nece&s;&s;ary &s;tep to afford them relief; but no obloquy &s;hould be thrown on government. Neither does the evil exi&s;t to the extent it might have been &s;uppo&s;ed, when the bu&s;ine&s;s was brought forward. A member from Penn&s;ylvania had mentioned a particular in&s;tance: he could mention a particular in|&s;tance of a French captain who had &s;o ill-treated &s;ome American &s;eamen, as to be ca&s;hiered, on a repre&s;entation being made to the French government.</P>
<P>Mr. DAYTON (New Jer&s;ey) &s;aid that he had not ex|pected an oppo&s;ition to the re&s;olution under con&s;ideration on the ground of fact, that he could not have &s;uppo&s;ed any member would have que&s;tioned the exi&s;tence of the
<PB N="56" REF="030219_0057_0FE5270D291768C0">
evils, which the propo&s;itions were calculated to remedy. He entertained a belief that the impre&s;&s;ment of American &s;eamen, particularly on board of Briti&s;h &s;hips of war, was a matter of too great notoriety, to need any evidence at this time. But the member from South Carolina, who manife&s;ted the mo&s;t zealous oppo&s;ition to the&s;e mea&s;ures, had admitted that there had exi&s;ted in&s;tances of this &s;ort, and as it mu&s;t follow that what had once exi&s;ted might again exi&s;t, it behoved Congre&s;s to make provi&s;ions tend|ing to prevent, or at lea&s;t mo&s;t &s;peedily and efficaciou&s;ly to remedy them.</P>
<P>Mr Dayton declared that he heartily approved the ob|ject of the re&s;olution, as originally propo&s;ed by the mem|ber from New York, and the general principles of the re|port founded thereon, as a que&s;tion of humanity, and of great national policy. It was, however, with pain that he heard the worthy mover draw into unfavourable que|&s;tion, the conduct of the Secretary of State, and indulge him&s;elf in &s;ome &s;evere reflections and imputations upon that officer. Mr. Dayton a&s;cribed it to an irritability, and perhaps an hone&s;t irritability, upon this &s;ubject &s;o affect|ing and intere&s;ting to Americans. He a&s;cribed it to a warmth of temper in which, in this particular ca&s;e, the cooler judgment of that gentleman, and the knowledge of the real character and conduct of the Secretary of State had no agency or influence. The expre&s;&s;ions which had been uttered by &s;ome gentlemen in the cour&s;e of the di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion tending to charge our government with a criminal apathy and indifference towards this de&s;cription of citizens, did by no means, Mr. Dayton &s;aid, meet with his appro|bation. He believed them to be unfounded, for he was per&s;uaded that whenever it heard, it did whatever it could to relieve the &s;eamen of the United States, and to obtain for tho&s;e who unfortunately needed it, complete redre&s;s. Having &s;aid thus much in vindication of the conduct of the government he returned to the re&s;olution it&s;elf, and declared him&s;elf its advocate. It contained neither in its words nor &s;pirit, any imputation upon the Executive, of the &s;ort hinted at.</P>
<P>In the former ca&s;e, every one mu&s;t perceive it more than po&s;&s;ible, that owing to di&s;tance and the time which
<PB N="57" REF="030219_0058_0FE526DA1B056F48">
mu&s;t con&s;equently be expended in the communication to, and remon&s;trance from our government, an <HI>American citi|zen</HI> might be impre&s;&s;ed and compelled to &s;erve months, perhaps years in a &s;ervice which he dete&s;ted, <HI>and po&s;&s;ibly forced to apply the match to a cannon charged with balls aimed for the de&s;truction of his friends.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. BOURNE (Rhode I&s;land) propo&s;ed to amend the re|&s;olution, by &s;triking out that part of it which appoints an agent for Great Britain and confines the &s;ending of an agent to that part of the Engli&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the We&s;t Indies to which the greate&s;t number of American ve&s;&s;els &s;ail.</P>
<P>Mr. LIVINGSTON was plea&s;ed to &s;ee gentlemen concur in endeavouring to form a plan for the relief of American &s;eamen. It has been a&s;ked why the Con&s;uls were not entru&s;ted with this bu&s;ine&s;s; the committee con&s;idered that, as the Con&s;uls of the United States received no other recom|pence for their &s;ervices, than the dignity and con&s;equence which, their office gives them, they would not be likely to pay &s;ufficient attention to a bu&s;ine&s;s of this kind. They con&s;idered the immen&s;e labour of Mr. Cutting to deliver the impre&s;&s;ed American &s;eamen. They &s;uppo&s;ed, there|fore, if the duty were laid upon the Con&s;uls, a &s;alary &s;hould be annexed to their office? but, as there is no Con|&s;ul in the We&s;t Indies, a &s;pecial agent &s;hould be appoint|ed.&mdash;In order to bring a view of the bu&s;ine&s;s before the Hou&s;e, he would a&s;k, how relief is to be afforded to a &s;eaman who has been impre&s;&s;ed? Suppo&s;e he is &s;eized in London, he is &s;ent down to Port&s;mouth. The agent mu&s;t attend immediately, get certificates, pay fees of office, employ council, &amp;c. to relea&s;e a &s;ingle &s;eaman; a trouble he believed no Con&s;ul would take. The committee &s;up|po&s;ed that the &s;olemnity of commi&s;&s;ioning an agent e&s;peci|ally on the bu&s;ine&s;s, would convince <HI>Foreign powers</HI> that they would no longer <HI>&s;uffer the Briti&s;h,</HI> or others, to exer|ci&s;e that power over American &s;eamen which they them|&s;elves could not exerci&s;e. It is to be hoped, al&s;o, that when the government of Great Britain &s;ees a &s;tep of this &s;ort taken, it will give up the practice of &s;eizing American &s;eamen, and let them pa&s;s in quietne&s;s. If not, the agents employed could tran&s;mit to this country an account of what &s;eamen were &s;eized by them, and every particularly
<PB N="58" REF="030219_0059_0FE52720A7E72238">
re&s;pecting the &s;ame. This con&s;ideration influenced the committee, and he tru&s;ted it would influence the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. S. SMITH (Maryland) &s;aid that as the member from South Carolina had called upon gentlemen from &s;ea ports for evidence, if they were &s;ilent, it would be &s;up|po&s;ed no information could be given on the &s;ubject under di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. He &s;uppo&s;ed he &s;hould be prevented from giv|ing this information now, becau&s;e the amendment of the fir&s;t re&s;olution was under con&s;ideration. [The Hou&s;e cal|led for information.] He &s;aid he repre&s;ented a port where the fact of American &s;eamen being impre&s;&s;ed by the Brit|i&s;h was <HI>&s;o notorious,</HI> that <HI>every</HI> man knew it. But how, &s;aid he, is this information to be got and tran&s;mitted to the Secretary of State, no complaint is likely to reach his office, except brought there by merchants. In his <HI>own trade,</HI> he had frequent in&s;tances of this &s;ort, almo&s;t in every voyage. He could <HI>not &s;ay the men impre&s;&s;ed were al|ways Americans, but they were men &s;ailing under the authori|ty of the United States.</HI> We have a flag, under that flag men are &s;eized, and they have a right to expect, when &s;eized, redre&s;s from government. There is <HI>no difference</HI> between <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Algerines,</HI> for, by the former, they are compelled to fight again&s;t tho&s;e whom they <HI>wi&s;h well,</HI> which <HI>is equal to any &s;lavery that can be impo&s;ed.</HI> He &s;aid, that from one of his &s;hips there were two New-England men impre&s;&s;ed; one of whom being a &s;tout, courageous man, wi&s;hed to have defended him&s;elf again&s;t his a&s;&s;ai|lants; but the &s;upercargo &s;aid, no, this will ri&s;k the car|go of the owner. The advice he gave, &s;uppo&s;ing govern|ment would afford the&s;e men relief.</P>
<P>If the member from South Carolina wi&s;hed for <HI>&s;uch in|formation as would be received before a court of Judicature, it could not be got.</HI> Mr. Smith thought &s;ufficient attention had not been paid by government <HI>to merchants and &s;eamen.</HI> Mr Jay, in his communication to Lord Grenville &s;ays, an impre&s;&s;ment of American &s;eamen had taken place, who had been forced to fight, &amp;c. If this had not been &s;o, it had not been written by Mr. Jay, nor would Lord Gren|ville have promi&s;ed relief. He hoped this information would be thought &s;ufficient.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="030219_0060_0FE5270EC0B4D110">It had been &s;aid that there were not many in&s;tances of American &s;eamen impre&s;&s;ed; but, &s;uppo&s;e there were but one man, <HI>and be a negro,</HI> &s;uffering under <HI>the galling yoke of impre&s;&s;ment,</HI> it is the duty of government to provide relief for that man. The &s;ame member has &s;aid that the Quibe|ron ve&s;&s;els did not impre&s;s the crews of the &s;hips; he &s;aid it was &s;ufficient to take their flour and pay them nine dol|lars for what might have been &s;old the next day for twen|ty or upwards.&mdash;Mr. Smith concluded by ob&s;erving, that if we were a feeble nation, we had a right to expect ju|&s;tice; but he hoped we were not to feeble as &s;ome gentle|men imagined.</P>
<P>Mr. GILES (Virginia) was of opinion, with the mem|ber from Rhode I&s;land, that American citizens &s;hould be attended to in other countries, as well as in Great Britain. He had not heard, of any <HI>impre&s;&s;ments</HI> but by the Briti&s;h, but he had heard of <HI>captivities;</HI> and that Hou&s;e had heard of a French officer being ca&s;hiered, for ill-treating Ame|rican citizens; but it had heard no in&s;tance of Great Bri|tain puni&s;hing officers for ill-treating American citizens. No, this marked the different character of the two nations towards the Americans.</P>
<P>Mr. SWANWICK ro&s;e to inform the hou&s;e that &s;ince he was in his place ye&s;terday, he had been called upon with evidence on the &s;ubject now before the committee, in con&s;equence of the call made for it in the cour&s;e of the debate. The in&s;tances he had given to him were, the ca&s;e of Robert Norris a native of Princeton in New-Jer&s;ey, and <HI>five others</HI> who &s;ailed on board the American brig Matilda, captain Burke, from Philadelphia, which &s;ailed from this port in May la&s;t, for Bourdeaux, and were on the 9th of July, brought to by four Briti&s;h frigates, for|cibly taken into the ve&s;&s;el, impre&s;&s;ed and compelled to go and &s;erve on board one of the &s;aid frigates called the Stag, where they &s;erved four months, when the &s;aid Robert Norris made his e&s;cape from the frigate at Sheerne&s;s, at the ri&s;k of his life, and returned in January la&s;t to the United States. His companions he believes are yet in bondage. The other in&s;tance was the brig Sally captain Wilkins, which &s;ailed from this port in May la&s;t bound to Madeira, and five days after leaving the Capes was brought

to by the Rattle Snake &s;toop of war, captain York, and the mate (<HI>a native of Scotland,</HI> but who had &s;ailed for <HI>ma|ny years</HI> out of the United States) and one of the be&s;t &s;eamen (an American) taken out. They were carried to Hallifax, from whence the fore-ma&s;t man made his e&s;cape, and arrived here the beginning of July. Before they ar|rived at Hallifax, he informs, that fifteen men were taken out of American ve&s;&s;els.&mdash;Mr. Swanwick read al&s;o an ac|count from an owner of &s;everal other impre&s;&s;ments.</P>
<P>Mr. SEDGWICK (Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts) &s;aid, he was ye&s;terday prevented from attending the Hou&s;e by indi&s;po&s;ition. The &s;ubject &s;truck his mind, he &s;aid, in &s;everal points of view which had not been noticed. He was &s;urprized why the bu&s;ine&s;s was undertaken in the way it was. No de&s;crip|tion of men, he &s;aid, were more entitled to regard than &s;eamen; but this did not reconcile the adoption of the &s;ubject in the manner propo&s;ed. The executive, he was of opinion, would con&s;ider it&s;elf as charged with this bu&s;ine&s;s. An agent who is neither con&s;ul nor mini&s;ter, is an in&s;trument unknown, an undefined character that would not be recognized. It was impo&s;&s;ible, he &s;aid, for any two agents, one in Great Britain and the other in the We&s;t-Indies, to gain information of the &s;ufferings of &s;ea|men in different parts of the two countries, particularly in Great Britain. He called upon gentlemen to &s;ay whe|ther they had ever heard of &s;uch a character as they were propo&s;ing to create? He &s;aid America had con&s;uls in every part of the world, and if they have not, they ought to have &s;alaries for the bu&s;ine&s;s. Why appoint agents? and what authority will they have?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. L&mdash;</SPEAKER>
<P>The &s;eamen, &s;ailing under the &s;anc|tion of our national flag, have been violently forced into a &s;ervice they abhor, cruelly torn from their dear wives and &s;miling babes, and ignominiou&s;ly &s;courged for a&s;&s;erting their privileges as citizens! The country to which they looked for relief has re|garded their &s;ufferings with apathy and indifference. Three long, long years we have beheld their whip|pings and heard their lamentable cries; yet, for three long, long years we have been &s;ilent &s;pec|tators of the di&s;graceful &s;cene! We have begun a compact with their oppre&s;&s;ors, in which the&s;e poor dear fellows look with longing eyes in vain for one little tiny article, one ray of hope! <HI>I blu&s;h,</HI> that an A&mdash;can Mini&s;ter could be <HI>guilty</HI> of this <HI>di&s;graceful</HI> omi&s;&s;ion!</P>

<P>Mr. Chairman, the gentleman who &s;poke la&s;t, has de&s;cribed the &s;ufferings of our injured fellow citizens in a manner that does infinite honour to his feelings. He talks about <HI>blu&s;hing</HI> and <HI>guilty di&s;graceful omi&s;&s;ions</HI> with a warmth peculiar to him&s;elf, and admirably calculated to produce what the players call &s;tage effect. Indeed, Sir, I cannot help looking on our&s;elves as engaged in the perform|ance of a tragedy here: the gentleman has gone back 2203 years, even to the days of <HI>Euripides,</HI>

for his model. The piece will certainly do us ho|nour; but, it &s;eems to be incomplete without a chorus to throw light on &s;ome parts of it, that in par|ticular where he &s;peaks of <HI>blu&s;hing;</HI> and, as I have a few ver&s;es in my hand, which are not quite foreign to this &s;ubject, I beg leave to read them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Peter Porcupine.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gen|tleman for his hint about per&s;onalities; but he will allow, that I am as excu&s;able as Mr L&mdash;, who talked about the <HI>&s;hameful, guilty,</HI> and <HI>di&s;graceful</HI> conduct of a mo&s;t upright public Mini&s;ter. I may not have the mellifluent eloquence of the gentleman la&s;t up: I know I am a rough-hewn mortal; but, as I am &s;peaking to men, and not to an a&s;&s;embly of <HI>little mi&s;&s;es,</HI> the want of that gentleman's &s;ilver li&s;p may not amount to a total di&s;qualification.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now turn to what the gentleman has ad|vanced on the &s;ubject before us.&mdash;He begs us <Q>not to be <HI>too nice</HI> about evidence.</Q> This is going a &s;tep beyond the Revolutionary Tribunal of Paris. There the <HI>accu&s;er</HI> is heard, and if the jury are &s;a|tisfied of the guilt of the pri&s;oner, <HI>no evidence is heard in his defence.</HI> This is not being over nice; but we are required to be &s;till le&s;s nice. The mer|ciful French hear the witne&s;&s;es <HI>again&s;t</HI> the pri&s;oner at any rate; but we are called upon to give our verdict, without hearing any at all; poor unfortu|nate Great Britain is to be condemned upon the bare indictment. One comes forward and accu&s;es her; &s;he holds up her feeble emaciated hand, and pleads, NOT GUILTY, my Lords. Some of us wi&s;h to hear what can be urged again&s;t her; but the gentlemen tell us not to be too nice about evi|dence
<PB N="65" REF="030219_0066_0FE52710432557F8">
that &s;he is a notorious offender; that <Q><HI>eve|ry</HI> man <HI>knows</HI> it, though <HI>no one</HI> can give <HI>regular information</HI> of it,</Q> and, in &s;hort, that &s;he ought to have been annihilated long ago. In vain do we, like Pontius Pilate, a&s;k, <HI>for what;</HI> &s;till they cry with one voice: Let her be crucified! Let her be crucified!&mdash;And, is it thus we treat our poor old mother in the hour of her di&s;tre&s;s?</P>
<P>The gentleman produces, as a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for our not being <HI>too nice,</HI> the great "<HI>ignorance</HI> of the <HI>citizens</HI> impre&s;&s;ed." And, do I hear this lan|guage from Mr. S&mdash;k? Is it po&s;&s;ible for the people to be ignorant while under the rays of this focus of &s;cience? Do I live, Mr. Chairman, to hear the words <HI>ignorance</HI> and <HI>citizens</HI> articulated in the &s;ame breath? How long, Sir, have our ears been dinned with, <HI>an informed people, an enlighten|ed people;</HI> with the de&s;truction of &s;uper&s;tition and prejudice, and the luminous clo&s;e of the eighteenth century? And, &s;hall we now be told, that our <HI>citizens</HI> are <HI>ignorant?</HI> That they are &s;uch &s;tupid brutes as not to be able to give an account of what has befallen them? not even of their impri|&s;onments and their &s;tripes?</P>
<P>But, Mr. S&mdash;k, after two or three days dili|gent &s;earch, brings us &s;omething like an account of &s;ome men impre&s;&s;ed from a ve&s;&s;el <HI>of his own,</HI> and this, he in&s;i&s;ts, is evidence enough for any rea&s;on|able man. Thus, when a &s;ailor can be brought to &s;ay, that he has been impre&s;&s;ed and &s;courged, he is an <HI>enlighted citizen;</HI> but when he cannot, he is a poor ignorant devil, <Q>not capable of giving the nece&s;&s;ary information.</Q></P>
<P>The gentleman told us &s;omething about <HI>Algiers,</HI> and, though I cannot for my &s;oul preceive why
<PB N="66" REF="030219_0067_0FE5267BF4EC9968">
Algiers was dragged into the debate, I look upon my&s;elf as entitled to &s;ay a word or two in reply. <Q>The united exertions, &s;ays he, of the whole A&mdash;can people &s;eemed <HI>to cry out</HI> for the re|lea&s;ement of the pri&s;oners in Algiers,</Q> I believe, Sir, that the people in general were much affected with the fate of tho&s;e unfortunate men, and that, had proper mea&s;ures been taken to call their feel|ings into action, the pri&s;oners would long ago have been re&s;tored to their families and country, with|out the interpo&s;ition of government; but, no one will deny, that the&s;e mea&s;ures &s;hould have originat|ed with the <HI>merchants;</HI> that the example &s;hould have been given, and, indeed, the greate&s;t part of the money be&s;towed by them&s;elves. Was this the ca&s;e; They did, indeed, <HI>"cry out;"</HI> they might, for ought I know, make fervent applications to heaven; but the applications to their pur&s;es, which had been filled by the toil and hard&s;hips of the&s;e poor fellows, were very faint and ineffectual. A &s;ub&s;cription was opened in this city, Mr. S&mdash;k was him&s;elf one of the receivers, and I now call upon him to &s;ay, how much his brethren &s;ub&s;crib|ed, and how much he &s;ub&s;cribed him&s;elf. I call upon him to &s;ay, whether a company of <HI>foreign players,</HI> yea, even Engli&s;h players, did not &s;ub&s;cribe more than all the merchants of this great, rich and flouri&s;hing city!&mdash;Here was <Q>apathy and indiffer|ence,</Q> indeed! Here Mr. L&mdash; might have &s;een rea&s;on to "<HI>blu&s;h</HI> for a <HI>di&s;graceful omi&s;&s;ion!</HI>"</P>
<P>I am not &s;orry that the little gentleman be&s;towed a few of his &s;ilver &s;ounds on the &s;laves in Algiers, as it furni&s;hes me with an opportunity of comparing the conduct of the friends of the re&s;olution towards tho&s;e men, and that which they now hold towards &s;eamen impre&s;&s;ed by the Engli&s;h. The &s;laves in Algiers could have been at any time ran&s;omed, and
<PB N="67" REF="030219_0068_0FE5267EB8B5BB10">
we well know, that they were <HI>all</HI> real <HI>A&mdash;cans.</HI> The &s;eamen impre&s;&s;ed are indefinite; we know not who or where they are; all we know about them, is, that they are <HI>all,</HI> or nearly &s;o, &s;ubjects of the king of Great Britain. Now, how comes it, that the&s;e gentlemen &s;how &s;uch amazing zeal, and are &s;o deeply touched with what they gravely call the <HI>&s;ufferings</HI> of the&s;e &s;ubjects of His Britannic Maje&s;ty, while they &s;how &s;uch indifference for our own citi|zens? This &s;eems totally unaccountable, yet, Mr. Chairman, I think I can explain it in a few words. The impre&s;&s;ment of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;eamen by the Briti&s;h forms a &s;ubject of oppo&s;ition to the treaty; any mea&s;ures taken to re&s;i&s;t that impre&s;&s;ment may lead to a war; the expence attending the agents &s;ent out will come from the public pur&s;e, and not from the pur&s;e of the&s;e gentlemen. None of the&s;e weigh|ty rea&s;ons exi&s;ted with re&s;pect to the &s;laves in Al|giers, and therefore, they might have remained there, 'till they had rotted in their chains, had not that government which the&s;e &s;ticklers for humanity now accu&s;e of apathy and indifference, been much more vigilant and humane than they.</P>
<P>I have much more to &s;ay on this &s;ubject, Sir; but as the hour of Turkey and Madeira is at hand, I &s;it down, in order to give the Hou&s;e an opportu|nity of adjourning.</P>

<HEAD><HI>NARRATIVE</HI> Of the Suicide of the <HI>Argus</HI> of New York.</HEAD>
<P>OF All the acts ari&s;ing from folly, wickedne&s;s, or de|&s;pair, that of Suicide is be&s;t calculated to awaken curio|&s;ity. It is &s;o hard to be accounted for from the common evils incident to life, and is &s;uch a direct violation of the fir&s;t law of
<PB N="68" REF="030219_0069_0FE526ECB2F36560">
nature, that a man mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s an extraordinary degree of &s;to|ici&s;m, not to feel &s;ome inclination to be informed of the cau&s;e. For my part, I felt this inclination &s;o forcibly, upon hearing of the fate of the renowned <HI>Argus,</HI> that I could not re&s;t, 'till I had obtained a circum&s;tantial account of the whole affair. I tru&s;t, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay how my brea&s;t has been wrung by this melancholy relation; neverthele&s;s, I &s;hould not think that I di&s;charged my duty as <HI>Cen&s;or,</HI> did I neglect to impart it to my readers.</P>
<P>By way of preface to this Narrative, it may not be ami&s;s to give &s;ome account of the wonderful two-legged creature who is the &s;ubject of it.</P>
<P>His name indicates that he has a hundred eyes, which is a real fact. The&s;e eyes, like tho&s;e of the bea&s;t in the vi&s;ion, are divided between his fore and hinder parts; but, in other re&s;pects, they re&s;emble tho&s;e of the Lamper Eel: that is, they emit filth and noxious matter in place of admitting light; or, in other words, they an&s;wer none of the u&s;eful purpo&s;es of this organ in other animals. He is extremely vindictive and fero|cious, and, though his &s;tupid eyes are too dim to wound in the manner of the ba&s;&s;ili&s;k, yet, when he has no other means of vengeance left, he drops tears that &s;cald and burn like <HI>aqua fortis</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e qualities could not fail to recommend him to the great Citizen G&mdash;t, of &s;editious and in&s;olent memory. He very &s;oon became the Citizen's chief favourite, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have drank deeply at the fountain of his large&s;&s;es. From mo|tives of gratitude, therefore, he was de&s;perately attached to the cau&s;e of the French Republic. He has written, &s;worn, and lied in that cau&s;e; and, of all the tools of faction, has, per|haps, been the mo&s;t &s;teady to his tru&s;t. He has chanted the Marfeillois Hymn, and celebrated all the &s;ucce&s;sful ma&s;&s;acres of his benefactors, with that kind of &s;avage joy that animates the ravages of bea&s;ts of prey.</P>
<P>But, alas! how tran&s;itory are all &s;ublunary things! The di&s;graceful defeats, or to u&s;e their own expre&s;&s;ion, <Q><HI>the</HI> little &s;ucce&s;s,</Q> of his ma&s;ters, during the la&s;t campaign, plunged him into a &s;tate of dejection, from which he was only rai&s;ed to be &s;unk over head and ears in de&s;pair. Like many other cha|ritable patriots, he was buoyed up by the hope of a rebellion, or, to give it the fa&s;hionable term, of a <HI>revolution,</HI> in Great Britain; and this event was reduced to a certainty by the ac|count concerning the <HI>Sedition Bills,</HI> which our indu&s;trious and faithful and impartial news-mongers &s;pread through the country.</P>
<P>This, then, was the rock of our <HI>Argus's</HI> hope: &s;till, how|ever, he had his doubts and his fears, and the&s;e were left to fluctuate during the wide cha&s;m in our foreign intelligence. No|thing
<PB N="69" REF="030219_0070_0FE526DBDC9F1E30">
torments and harra&s;&s;es the mind like &s;u&s;pence. The poor <HI>Argus</HI> became pen&s;ive and melancholy, was often &s;een to &s;top in the middle of the &s;treet, and heard to mutter incoherent ex|pre&s;&s;ions about rebellion and <HI>Sedition Bills</HI> and Pitt and King George, or Citizen Guelph, as he called him.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day, the fatal 23rd of March, about a quarter after &s;ix in the morning, he was perceived, with a &s;pying-gla&s;s in his hand, walking on the battery oppo&s;ite the port. He was ob&s;erved to &s;top often and olap the gla&s;s to one of his eyes, then &s;cratch his head, clench his fi&s;t, and give other evident tokens of anger or madne&s;s. At la&s;t, turning him&s;elf towards the water, he laid the tele&s;cope to his &s;houlder, as if it were a gun, and, after making a motion to fire, uttered a loud cry and ran down to the beach. Two labourers, who had viewed him all this time, now lo&s;t fight of him. One of them ha&s;ten|ed to the &s;pot, where he found the poor di&s;tracted wretch be|labouring a log which had been thrown up by the tide. His left hand was all over blood, and the tele&s;cope was reduced to &s;plinters, except about four inches of it, which he &s;till gri|ped fa&s;t in his right. Upon being a&s;ked what was the matter: "Look," &s;ays he, holding his bloody hand to the man, <Q>Look, my lad, that's the heart's blood of Pitt: no pity! no pity! let's to the palace and cut all their throats!</Q></P>
<P>The other workman now came up, and the two together, with the help of a third per&s;on, made &s;hift to get him home, without further mi&s;chief. This was not effected, however, without &s;ome danger; for, as he conceived him&s;elf going to Newgate, as a preparative for a voyage to Botany Bay, there is not a mean of annoyance that he did not make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of, or an execration that he did not vomit forth.</P>
<P>When he was put to bed, he &s;wore he was on a rack a million times crueler than that of Damien. <Q>Ra&s;cals, &s;ays he, I have only killed a mini&s;ter. I have only done my duty as a citizen and a patriot.</Q> The&s;e ravings continued for nearly two hours, after which, having been copiou&s;ly bled, he dropt off to &s;leep.</P>
<P>About four in the afternoon he waked, when to the joy of his friends, and the &s;urprize of every body, he &s;eemed perfectly re&s;tored to his &s;en&s;es. He eat a ba&s;on of panada, drank a lit|tle wine and water, and appeared quite recovered, except from the brui&s;es he had received from the ribs of mini&s;ter Log.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as things were taking this happy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> one of his printers brought word that a &s;hip was that mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rived from Liver-pool, bringing news to the end of February. This imprudent communication was the cau&s;e of an immediate relap&s;e. He jumped up, and, without either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> coat, ran down to the wharf, from whence he got o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> board the ve&s;&s;el. "Well,"
<PB N="70" REF="030219_0071_0FE527296ECF90F8">
&s;ays he, with a voice and look that &s;cared the whole crew, <Q>Well, ra&s;cals, you are come at la&s;t.

Being prevented here, he a&s;|&s;umed a placid mein, pretended he was only in a joke, though it was evident to every one, he was but too much in earne&s;t. Soon after this he &s;lipped from among the crowd (which was very con&s;iderable on account of the great news that was ex|pected) and got away on the foreca&s;tle, where he was prepa|ing to hang him&s;elf. He had even got the cord round his neck, when he was perceived by a man upon the yards. His intentions were now &s;o manife&s;t, that it would have been down|right inhumanity to neglect him any longer. He was conduct|ed home by &s;ome of the citizens, and put under the care of his own people.</P>
<P>Arrived once more at his home, he &s;eems to have been re|&s;olved to defer the execution of his de&s;perate de&s;ign no longer. He di&s;&s;embled, however; talked very connectedly; enquired whether the paper was nearly compo&s;ed or not, and even &s;at down and took his pen under pretence of writing an article of news. By tho&s;e means he prevailed on his people to leave him alone; two of them, however, thought it prudent to remain at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d of the &s;tairs, in order to be at hand, &s;hould he make any attempt on his life. Their &s;u&s;picious were but too well founded; for, at the end of half an hour's dead &s;ilence, they heard him utter a mo&s;t dreadful groan, and, pre&s;ently after, fall on the floor. They attempted to force the door, but it was too &s;ecurely fa&s;tened. They then applied to the wain&s;cot, and, at la&s;t, made an opening, when, &s;hocking to relate! they found their dear ma&s;ter weltering in his blood, his throat being cut nearly acro&s;s.
