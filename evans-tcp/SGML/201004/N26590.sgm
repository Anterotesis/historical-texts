<Q><BIBL><HI>2 TIMOTHY iii. 1&mdash;9.</HI></BIBL>
<P>In the la&s;t days perilous times &s;hall come: For men &s;hall be lovers of their own &s;elves, covetous, boa&s;ters, proud, bla&s;|phemers, di&s;obedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce-breakers, fal&s;e accu&s;ers, incontinent, fierce, de&s;pi&s;ers of the&s;e who are good, trai|tors, heady, high-minded, lovers of plea&s;ures more than lovers of God; having a form of godline&s;s, but denying the power thereof: from &s;uch turn away.

<P>THE works of the Lord are great, &s;ought out of all them who have plea&s;ure therein. How fre|quently and plainly are we enjoined by the voice of Scripture to behold the works of the Lord and con&s;id|er the operation of his hands&mdash;To con&s;ider how Infi|nite Wi&s;dom determines the character and condition of men and the different ages of the world. Our Lord reproved the Jews for not di&s;cerning the &s;igns of the
<PB N="4" REF="035364_0003_1004A13AEA8909C0">times. Hence the advice before us. This know al&s;o that in the la&s;t days perilous times &s;hall come, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If it was nece&s;&s;ary for Timothy to know this, it can|not be le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary for us to know it, who are &s;o much more intere&s;ted in the events of the la&s;t days than Timothy could be, or any other per&s;on in that age of the world. Let us then con&s;ider,</P>
<P><HI>What time is here intended by the la&s;t days:</HI></P>
<P>And, <HI>How it appears that the character of men in the la&s;t days fulfils the prophecy in view.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. What time is here intended by the la&s;t days.</P>
<P>The &s;cripture mentions, at lea&s;t, two important pe|riods by this appellation: The la&s;t days of the Jews and the la&s;t days of the Chri&s;tians. <HI>Gather your&s;elves together,</HI> &s;aid Jacob to his &s;ons, <HI>that I may tell you that which &s;hall befal you in the la&s;t days,</HI> i. e. the la&s;t times of the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation. <HI>God, who at &s;undry times and in divers manners, &s;pake in time pa&s;t unto the fathers by the prophets,</HI> &s;ays Paul, <HI>hath in the&s;e la&s;t days &s;poken unto us by his Son.</HI> Here al&s;o it is plain that the phra&s;e means <HI>the la&s;t days of the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation.</HI> But in our text the phra&s;e is &s;poken in the future ten&s;e, and therefore mu&s;t &s;ignify the la&s;t days of the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation. Such are the pre&s;ent days. It is allow|ed by the mo&s;t excellent commentators, that the mo|ment is very near when time &s;hall be no longer; when the my&s;tery of God &s;hall be fini&s;hed; when the Millen|nium, the third di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel, &s;hall com|mence, and when Chri&s;t will de&s;troy the man of &s;in by the brightne&s;s of his coming; but this will further appear if we con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="2">II. How it appears that the character of mankind in the&s;e days fulfils the prophecy in view. The pro|phecy begins by declaring that perilous times &s;hall come, times of great danger. And cannot the friends of religion now &s;ee the fulfilment? How perilous are the pre&s;ent times, with regard to the &s;piritual welfare of mankind! Our father and fathers' fathers never &s;aw &s;uch a day as this: &s;uch a day of delu&s;ion in the
<PB N="5" REF="035364_0004_1004A13C88AD0DD8">Chri&s;tian world. Univer&s;ali&s;m, Dei&s;m and Athei&s;m have &s;et their mouths again&s;t the heavens, and laughed at the &s;olemn threatenings of Jehovah. They &s;ay unto the wicked, It &s;hall be well with him, and cry, <HI>Peace, peace,</HI> where there is no peace.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle Peter, writing to Chri&s;tians in general, foretels this our dreadful apo&s;ta&s;y: <HI>There were fal&s;e prophets al&s;o among the people, even as there &s;hall be fal&s;e teachers among you, who privily &s;hall bring in damnable here&s;ies, even denying the Lord who bought them, and bring upon them&s;elves &s;wift de&s;truction. And many &s;hall follow their pernicious ways, by rea&s;on of whom the way of truth &s;hall be evil &s;poken of.</HI> Tho&s;e among us, who have the proper u&s;e of their eyes, can clearly &s;ee the accom|pli&s;hment of tho&s;e predictions, which tell us that the Chri&s;tian world, in the la&s;t days, &s;hall be filled with all manner of delu&s;ions, and pernicious, fooli&s;h errors. Our fal&s;e teachers are now performing the work long &s;ince a&s;&s;igned for them, that the &s;cripture may be ful|filled. Some of them have crept into hou&s;es, and led captive &s;illy women, laden with &s;ins, led away with di|vers lu&s;ts. When the infidel fal&s;e teachers in France publi&s;hed their infamous writings, Mr. Pirie tells us, that the <HI>poi&s;ardes</HI> or fi&s;h-women of Paris were the fir&s;t objects of their &s;eduction; and by their means the whole fabric of Church and State was o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> hrow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in an in&s;tant.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wei&s;haupt, the founder of the Illuminees, has given to his regents partic|ular &s;ecret in&s;tructions for &s;educing the women.

<P>Now I a&s;k, what can render the times more perilous than the&s;e pernicious and damnable errors, which al|lure &s;uch multitudes to everla&s;ting ruin? 'He who flattereth his neighbour, &s;preadeth a net for his feet. There is a way which &s;eemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof is the way of death.'</P>
<P>The&s;e horrid delu&s;ions are the &s;ource of horrid im|moralities, which render the times perilous with regard to temporal life, peace and property! <HI>For men &s;hall be lovers of their own &s;elves,</HI> &s;ays the text.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="035364_0005_1004A13E54669C48">
Men were always lovers of their own &s;elves, in all ages of the world; but now this evil of evils &s;hall greatly prevail. Selfi&s;hne&s;s is the e&s;&s;ence of &s;in; the fountain of all immorality; and as &s;ome wicked men are more &s;elfi&s;h than others, &s;o it is not unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;ome wicked ages of men are more &s;elf|i&s;h than others. Accordingly the pre&s;ent age exhibits abundant &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. How many are there among us, &s;u&s;|taining public offices, and under &s;olemn oaths to main|tain the cau&s;e of virtue and the authority of the laws, who can trample on both to accompli&s;h their own &s;ini&s;ter purpo&s;es. Innumerable are the forms in which this ba&s;e principle appears; but I &s;hall particularly attend to tho&s;e which the text pre&s;ents to our view.</P>
<P>To &s;hew how &s;elf-love &s;hould operate in the la&s;t days, the text declares that men &s;hall be <HI>covetous, boa&s;ters, proud, bla&s;phemers.</HI> Covetou&s;ne&s;s now appears every where among all ranks of people, each one looking for gain from his quarter. Such horrid robbery and exten&s;ive violation of property have lately afflicted the earth and the &s;ea, as were &s;eldom known in former times.</P>
<P>And what age of the world ever heard &s;uch boa&s;ting as the pre&s;ent? What great &s;welling words of vanity do we hear from the lips of our infidel &s;ons of liberty! What a treat Patriot was Robe&s;piere in profe&s;&s;ion, ready to die for his country and the cau&s;e of virtue! and was there ever a greater Tyrant? I &s;hall plant the tree of liberty in London next &s;ummer, &s;aid Dumourier. The&s;e are but two, among innumerable in&s;tances of this kind, which may be quoted from the hi&s;tory of the pre&s;ent times. The rulers of France have undertook to regenerate the world, and diffu&s;e liberty, peace and happine&s;s every where; and more &s;welling language never was heard from the tongue of man than has proceeded from the leading part of that infidel a&s;&s;em|bly, re&s;pecting the great good which the world are to receive by their means. The eloquent Abbe Maury, &s;peaking of the great and dreadful change of <HI>times and

The&s;e we know are the effects of pride; for men &s;hall be <HI>proud</HI> in the la&s;t days. Who more proud than he who is wife in his own conceit? and who more wife in his own conceit than he who is wife above what is written, as all our in&s;idels are, while they ridicule every doctrine, every propo&s;ition, which a creature of ye&s;terday, a vile worm of the du&s;t cannot comprehend. Accordingly they &s;et their mouth in bla&s;phemy again&s;t the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth: For men &s;hall be <HI>bla&s;phe|mers,</HI> &s;ays the text. Never before was there &s;o much bla&s;phemy known among mankind as &s;ounds in the world at this day. 'We have no other religion but the Con&s;titution, and no other God but Liberty;' &s;aid the infamous Marat, when the petition of the Bapti&s;ts in France to be relea&s;ed from bearing arms was rejected. The impious Cerutideclared in his expiring moments that the only thing which was matter of regret with him in leaving the world was, that he left a religion on the earth.</P>
<P>Bla&s;phemous catechi&s;ms have been publi&s;hed in France, in which the Con&s;titution of the Republic was &s;ub&s;tituted for God, and the National A&s;&s;embly for the Saints. Our Saviour's incarnation has been the &s;ub|ject
<PB N="8" REF="035364_0007_1004A142126BAED8">of printed ridicule in the ba&s;e language of the dregs of the people.</P>
<P>The horrid Ma&s;&s;acre at Lyons in the year 1793 was introduced by a proce&s;&s;ion, which &s;et Heaven and an hereafter at de&s;iance. An a&s;s was dre&s;&s;ed in the ve&s;t|ments of Prie&s;ts, with the Old and New Te&s;tament tied to his tail, and made to drink out of the &s;acramental cup: and, when the proce&s;&s;ion had arrived to a certain &s;pot of ground prepared for the purpo&s;e, the Bible was publickly burnt amid the &s;houts and rejoicings of the bla&s;phemous a&s;&s;i&s;tants. The impious courtezan of Hebert at Paris was on a certain public occa&s;ion bril|liantly dre&s;&s;ed, placed on a throne of ivory, and wor|&s;hipped as the <HI>godde&s;s of Rea&s;on;</HI> all with a view to ca&s;t contempt on the wor&s;hip of JEHOVAH. The rulers of France have declared our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Redeem|er to be an impo&s;tor; have prohibited the acknow|ledgment of him and the exerci&s;e of his wor&s;hip.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A comedian, during the French revolution, appeared per&s;onally attacking Almighty God; &s;aying: "No, thou doit not exi&s;t. If thou ha&s;t power over the thunder-bolts, gra&s;p them; aim them at the man who dares &s;et thee at de|fiance in the face of thy altars But no, I bla&s;pheme thee, and I &s;till live. No, thou do&s;t not exi&s;t."&mdash;<HI>Anti&s;ocial Con&s;p.</HI> p 129.</NOTE></P>
<P>But to proceed,</P>
<P>Another evil here predicted is di&s;obedience to pa|rents. How vi&s;ible is the difference between family government fifty years &s;ince, and that which appears at the pre&s;ent time! There was &s;uch a thing as family prayer in former times; it was nothing wonderful for a child to hear his father pray and give religious in|&s;truction; but now family wor&s;hip and government are generally neglected, and di&s;obedience in children is the natural con&s;equence. The pre&s;ent age is fa|voured with great light, abundant knowledge, impor|tant privileges; but ah! the ingratitude every where manife&s;t! how great their damnation with whom &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings remain un&s;anctified! But the text mu&s;t be fulfilled, <HI>Unthankful, unholy.</HI></P>
<P>The next prediction demands particular notice: <HI>With|out natural affection.</HI> The prevalence of this evil is now clear to every di&s;cerning eye. Kin&s;men were more re|garded
<PB N="9" REF="035364_0008_1004A1481B7CF108">formerly than brethren are at pre&s;ent; I think any per&s;on may be challenged to find in the whole hi&s;to|ry of mankind &s;o many in&s;tances of this depravity, in &s;o &s;hort a period, as have di&s;graced human nature within the la&s;t ten years. What per&s;on, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of natural affection, could murder his whole family at once, as that infidel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr BEABLE, of Weathersfield.</NOTE> did in Connecticut? A &s;imilar &s;pecies of murder was lately attempted in the State of Vermont, by another Dei&s;t. For more in&s;tances of this kind, look into France, where infidelity reigns triumphant. There hundreds of fathers and mothers have been lately led to pri&s;on, and publickly accu&s;ed by their own chil|dren, that they might be put to death, for &s;ome differ|ence of &s;entiment in politics or religion. Our Lord has foretold this as one &s;ign of his &s;econd coming&mdash; 'Children &s;hall ri&s;e up again&s;t their parents, and cau&s;e them to be put to death.'</P>
<P>Mont&s;oy tells us, that a certain child, about ten years old, having been corrected by his mother for &s;ome fault, repaired to the revolutionary tribunal, and accu&s;ed her of favouring the Chri&s;tian Religion. The accu&s;ation was admitted, the boy recompen&s;ed, and the mother executed in a few hours. One Philippe, in Paris, cut off the heads of his father and mother, while they were a&s;leep, and carried them to the Jacobin Club, as a proof of his patrioti&s;m. One Goutin, of Nantz, beat his father on his death bed. Many chil|dren, in that infidel country, have been known not only to de&s;pi&s;e and ridicule their parents, but to beat and lacerate them in a cruel manner, becau&s;e they re|fu&s;ed the precepts of the new infidel &s;y&s;tem of politics. The &s;ame want of natural affection has been expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t other relatives. The Abb&eacute; Barruel, in his Hi&s;|tory of the French Clergy, mentions a father who led his &s;on to death; of one O'Sullivan, who led his brother to the guillotine, after he had ca&s;t him&s;elf into his arms for protection. And we know that a brother of the late King of France was one of tho&s;e who &s;ought his de&s;truction.</P>

Some of the French officers, when they ravaged Swabia and the banks of the lake of Con&s;tance, we are informed, drowned their own children, which they had by their wives and concubines, to avoid the trou|ble of providing for them.</P>
<P>That infernal Society, &s;tyled the <HI>Illuminati,</HI> or <HI>Illumi|nces,</HI> maintain it, as one of their important doctrines, that natunal affection ought to have no exi&s;tence, and that marriage, the &s;ource of all natural affection, is not only u&s;ele&s;s but injurious to &s;ociety,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is the modern doctrine of the Ency<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lopedi&s;ts and the Illuminees, "That the paternal authority cea&s;es with the wants of the children: The father would wrong his children, &s;hould he pretend to any authority over them after this pe|riod." &mdash;"All th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ties of nature, as well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tho&s;e of government or religion, &s;ays Abbe Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">" <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">re to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters">d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">upt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> la&s;t My<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters">."&mdash;<HI>Anti&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> p. 164. 165.</NOTE>&mdash;And the dread|ful <HI>&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">otte</HI> oath &s;pares neither parents, friends, nor relations.

<P>Another character of men which the text mentions are, <HI>truce breakers.</HI></P>
<P>The word <HI>truce,</HI> here means any &s;tipulation, cov|enant, or agreement, which two or more per&s;ons may form with each other. Look now through the land and through the world: do we not find that truces, &s;tipulations, oaths and promi&s;es are violated every where? The merchant can tell you how few there are at this day, who&s;e words are more than wind. I do not believe that there was ever a time in which cov|enants, oaths and promi&s;es were more impudently vi|olated than they are at this day. Are not thou&s;ands of oaths broken in America and England annually? Some late French publications inform us, that the con|&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly of France broke their oaths and promi&s;es in the mo&s;t public manner. The deputies were all furni&s;hed with written in&s;tructions, in which they were po&s;itively enjoined to make no innovations as to the form of government; yet they framed a con|&s;titution, by which the government was totally chang|ed. So every individual of the convention in the year 1792, took an oath to maintain the authority of the
<PB N="11" REF="035364_0010_1004A14E4A69AA28">king. What was the con&s;equence? In a few months after, they declared France a republic, and murdered the king. And it would be tedious to enumerate the in&s;tances of perfidy which the French have exhibited towards the numerous towns in Europe, which have fallen within the gra&s;p of their in&s;atiable rapacity.</P>
<P>But why &s;hould oaths and promi&s;es be le&s;s regard|ed now than formerly? The an&s;wer is ea&s;y: The pre&s;ent age is the age of <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> the age of infidelity. Only believe that there is no future mi&s;ery, no Bible, or no God, and what need you care for oaths or prom|i&s;es? For the &s;ame rea&s;on, <HI>fal&s;e accu&s;ers</HI> are multipli|ed, and the <HI>incontinent, levers of plea&s;ures more than lov|ers of God.</HI> Here is the figure <HI>meio&s;is;</HI> q. d. <HI>They &s;hall wallow in carnal plea&s;ures, and be filled with enmity again&s;t God.</HI></P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for any di&s;cerning per&s;on, who has lived forty years, not to perceive how much more nu|merous intemperate and la&s;civious per&s;ons now are, than formerly, in proportion to the number of people; ruining property, family, body, &s;oul and all forever.</P>
<P>Another characteri&s;tic of the la&s;t days is expre&s;&s;ed by the word <HI>fierce:</HI> What terrible fiercene&s;s has ap|peared in the conduct of our infidel &s;ons of liberty, in promoting the cau&s;e of their licentious politics! It would be tedious to enumerate, and horrible to de&s;cribe the cruelties, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations and ma&s;&s;acres in France and other parts of Europe, by which the &s;avage ferocity of the&s;e wicked men has been diverted and delighted. In the term of three years, Mr. Harper tells us, that be|&s;ides tho&s;e &s;lain in the war, no le&s;s than three millions of per&s;ons were de&s;troyed in France; of which there were two hundred and fifty thou&s;and women, and two hundred and thirty thou&s;and children.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My authorities are not particularly quoted; for they are not with me.

<P>But we ha&s;ten to the next prediction: <HI>De&s;pi&s;ers of tho&s;e who are good.</HI> Good people have always been
<PB N="12" REF="035364_0011_1004A151157EDE60">de&s;pi&s;ed in every age; but there is one new doctrine peculiar to the&s;e la&s;t days, which our infidels are rap|idly propagating; which is, that <HI>piety, in a candidate for any political office, is no qualification or recommendation at all. Good men, as &s;uch, are of no u&s;e at all in any public employment of the State.</HI> Can &s;uch a doctrine as this gain ground among a people, unle&s;s good men are de|&s;pi&s;ed as they never were before?</P>
<P>The mini&s;ters of the Chri&s;tian religion too, whether they are Papi&s;ts or Prote&s;tants, are reproached and &s;coffed at as they never were before, in any former period. They are con&s;idered by multitudes as a nui|&s;ance in &s;ociety, and a con&s;tant impediment to that great <HI>&s;omething,</HI> which the boa&s;ting and licentious politicians of our age have in &s;tore for the liberty and regenera|tion of mankind.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What a par&s;imenious di&s;po&s;ition prevails, at this day, with re&s;pect to the &s;upport of the go&s;pel. This pre&s;ents a melancholy a&s;pect. The regular and honourable &s;upport of religious teachers is oppo&s;ed by a number who appear con&s;cientious. Little do they con&s;ider what they are doing; how much they help the devil; what a&s;&s;i&s;tance they afford to our modern enemies of all good order, civil and religious.</NOTE> But believe the prophecy, my hearers; the day, the dreadful day, is near, even at the door, when God will teach the world, by an awful le&s;&s;on, that our patriotic in&s;idels are as great enemies to the true welfare of civil &s;ociety as they are to re|ligion. For the prophecy before us declares, that men &s;hall be <HI>traitors</HI> in the la&s;t days. The Apo&s;tle Peter, de&s;cribing the apo&s;ta&s;y of the la&s;t times, more e&s;pecial|ly marks out tho&s;e for de&s;truction who walk in the lu&s;t of uncleanne&s;s and de&s;pi&s;e government. Pre&s;ump|tuous are they, he &s;ays, &s;elf-willed, they are not afraid to &s;peak evil of dignities. He repre&s;ents them as &s;peaking great &s;welling words of vanity, and promi&s;|ing liberty, while they them&s;elves are &s;ervants to cor|ruption. The &s;ame are the prophetic ideas of the text: <HI>Traitors, heady, high-minded;</HI> which clearly pre|&s;ignify that men &s;hall countenance licentious politics, and be filled with pride and &s;elf-importance. They &s;hall trample on the laws of men, as well as the laws of God, and oppo&s;e the be&s;t principles of government and &s;ound policy. Accordingly it is impo&s;&s;ible for
<PB N="13" REF="035364_0012_1004A15419D60B50">any one, who has the proper u&s;e of his eyes, not to &s;ee what a traitorous, rebellious &s;pirit breathes among mankind at the pre&s;ent day. We are a young people, favoured by Infinite Goodne&s;s with &s;ome of the be&s;t con&s;titutions of government that any nation ever en|joyed; but, young as we are, and happy as we are in this re&s;pect, we are already di&s;graced by three in&s;urrec|tions. Many there are among us filled with di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t the wi&s;e mea&s;ures and even the foundation of our government. Ungrateful people! we know not our privileges&mdash;we cannot enjoy them: &s;uch is our unrea&s;onable jealou&s;y and di&s;contentment: like the man to whom God has given riches, wealth and hon|our, &s;o that he wanteth nothing of all that his &s;oul de|&s;ireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof.</P>
<P>As the minds of men, at this day, are polluted with wicked and licentious principles re&s;pecting religion, &s;o they are with re&s;pect to politics. The fal&s;e doctrines of <HI>liberty and equality,</HI> which have contaminated mill|ions of mankind, have certainly a mo&s;t pernicious influence in &s;ociety, and are introductory to all tho&s;e horrid &s;cenes of in&s;urrection and anarchy, di&s;tre&s;s of nations and perplexity, which mu&s;t fulfil the prophetic &s;criptures in the la&s;t days. There are many in our land, who behave as if they e&s;teemed it their indi&s;pen|&s;able duty to oppo&s;e government and reproach the ru|lers, whenever the mode of admini&s;tration happens not to coincide with their political ideas. What violent reproaches and mi&s;repre&s;entations have &s;ome gazettes poured forth again&s;t the principal rulers of our nation, for that cour&s;e of admini&s;tration which demands our warm approbation!</P>
<P>But what &s;aith the &s;cripture? 'Thou &s;halt not &s;peak evil of the ruler of thy people. Thou &s;halt not revile the gods, nor cur&s;e the ruler of thy people.' When the Roman officer demanded tribute of our Lord and Pe|ter, did they, like &s;ome of our great patriots, refu&s;e or oppo&s;e the tyranny of the tax? No: 'Le&s;t we &s;hould offend,' &s;aid Chri&s;t to Peter, 'go thou to the &s;ea and ca&s;t in a hook, and take up the fi&s;h that cometh up fir&s;t,
<PB N="14" REF="035364_0013_1004A155C33384E0">and when thou ha&s;t opened it, thou &s;halt find a piece of money: that take and give unto them, for me and thee.'</P>
<P>Subjection to the powers that be is enjoined by the Apo&s;tle upon Chri&s;tians, as their indi&s;pen&s;able duty. Whereby, I think, it is plain, that Chri&s;tians &s;hould never appear the fir&s;t in political revolutions. That mankind every where &s;hould enjoy as much liberty as can be con&s;i&s;tent with &s;alutary government, mu&s;t be con|&s;onant to the feelings of every benevolent mind; but in&s;urrection is the la&s;t mode of redre&s;s that even an oppre&s;&s;ed people &s;hould ever contemplate.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When our &s;tates &s;uffered that oppre&s;&s;ion from Britain which occa&s;ioned the revolution, petition after petition was &s;ent to the Briti&s;h court, while we &s;uffered injury upon injury, before the &s;word was un&s;heathed on our part Every mild method for obtaining relief was adopted. And after all, the ruler of Britain, and no we, were the rebels again&s;t the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;titution of their gov|ernment, which plainly prohibited <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cation without repre&s;entation.</NOTE> We find in the &s;criptures very little which can be con&s;trued to favour political rebellion. 'The Mo&s;t High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whom&s;oever he will, and &s;etteth up over it the ba&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t of men.' So long as the plurality of mankind are exceedingly de|praved and wicked, all governments will be afflicted with wicked men and wicked mea&s;ures, in a le&s;s or greater degree. The hand of piety <HI>for the mo&s;t part</HI> has not &s;wayed the civil &s;ceptre in time pa&s;t, and we may believe never will, while the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel remains. To what purpo&s;e then can it be for Chri&s;tians to be eager in the bu&s;ine&s;s of revolu|tion; to exchange one form of government for anoth|er? &s;ince <HI>true</HI> Chri&s;tianity, perhaps, will have no more influence under the latter government than under the former. What great benefit can it be to exchange one mode of tyranny for another, and one mode of per&s;ecution for another? Political revolutions are fre|quently political judgments, their circum&s;tances and con&s;equences being far more dreadful than the oppre&s;|&s;ion which occa&s;ioned them. The ten tribes complain|ed and had rea&s;on to complain of the tyranny of Re|hoboam. Accordingly they revolted. What did they gain by it? Their hi&s;tory declares that their character
<PB N="15" REF="035364_0014_1004A1580146F720">was far more abominable, and their condition far more mi&s;erable, than they ever were before.</P>
<P>How happy were the Chri&s;tians in their own view in the days of Con&s;tantine, when the old empire was de|&s;troyed. Their pro&s;pect was all tranquillity and peace: Nothing to do now but to ba&s;k in the vernal &s;un of their great revolution. But clouds, O how black and di&s;mal! &s;oon ob&s;cured all this glory. They &s;oon &s;ound that their new government was not the kingdom of heaven, but nouri&s;hed the man of &s;in, and more dreadful &s;cenes of per&s;ecution and cruelty were now to follow than ever were known before.</P>
<P>Other revolutions, too numerous to particularize, have been attended with &s;imilar con&s;equences.</P>
<P>It is a great truth, that &s;ome forms of government are better calculated to promote the welfare of &s;ociety than others; but it is not enough that a con&s;titution be good: it mu&s;t be in good hands, in the hands, not of Dei&s;ts and Athei&s;ts, but of tho&s;e who fear God, and hate covetou&s;ne&s;s; for 'when the righteous bear rule, the city rejoiceth; when the wicked bear rule, the people mourn.' A good con&s;titution in bad hands tends to far greater evils than a bad con&s;titution in good hands.</P>
<P>When therefore a nation are become exceedingly corrupt and degenerate, the mere change of their gov|ernment will accompli&s;h but a poor purpo&s;e. There mu&s;t be a change of morals as well as government; otherwi&s;e their revolution will prove a cur&s;e and not a ble&s;&s;ing: For &s;till the wicked will bear rule, and &s;till the people will mourn.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, in ordinary ca&s;es, not only great wickedne&s;s, but extreme folly, for Chri&s;tians to &s;eek a kingdom in this world by political in&s;urrection; to &s;eek that by in&s;urrection, which Chri&s;t has plainly told them they never &s;hall obtain by any means whatever. It is the future kingdom of heaven which Chri&s;tians are to look for: a kingdom, which will very &s;oon be e&s;tabli&s;hed on the earth: for the Judge &s;tands before the door, the Millennium is at hand; and then 'the
<PB N="16" REF="035364_0015_1004A15C1D206008">greatne&s;s of the kingdom under the whole heaven &s;hall be given to the people of the &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High.' Accordingly we &s;ind that the fir&s;t di&s;ciples were peaceable citizens: we have no account that either Paul, Peter, James, or John, belonged to any republi|can &s;ociety or Jacobin Club; though they had far more rea&s;on to complain than any cla&s;s of white people now have, either in America or Britain. They never &s;wore hatred to royalty; but '&s;ubmit, &s;ay they, to every or|dinance of man for the Lord's &s;ake; fear God, honour the KING.'</P>
<P>If the ob&s;ervations now made be ju&s;t, the principles and conduct of multitudes, at this day, are clearly traitor|ous, and amply fulfil this &s;olemn prediction of the text.</P>
<P>But I hear the voice of objection: "What bu&s;i|ne&s;s have the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel with politicians in their preaching!" The an&s;wer is, Becau&s;e politicians have bu&s;ine&s;s with them. The mini&s;ters of religion in France have had bu&s;ine&s;s with infidel politicians, drowning boats and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, becau&s;e all the&s;e have had bu&s;ine&s;s with them. Among the many devices of Satan at the pre&s;ent day, this is one, that the teachers of religion have no concern with polities. But had Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and other prophets, no concern in the&s;e affairs? Had the Apo&s;tles no concern with them, when they taught &s;ubjection to rulers? Read your Bibles, and determine. Indi&s;pen&s;able is the duty of the watchmen, on the walls of Zion, as they are ena|bled to di&s;cern the &s;igns of the times, to warn the churches and people of their approaching danger.</P>
<P>But to proceed. While many bla&s;pheme the Lord of glory, others oppo&s;e him &s;ecretly, by the form of god|line&s;s, while they deny the power, &s;lumbering on the principles of fal&s;e religion, as on a bed of down; from &s;uch, we are exhorted by the text, to turn away, deny our&s;elves, and take up the cro&s;s. Gog and Magog &s;ig|nify <HI>covered and uncovered,</HI> &s;ecret enemies, and open enemies: the&s;e are the two grand per&s;ecutors of the church, in the la&s;t days.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="035364_0016_1004A1606B223898">
We now attend to the next prediction. <HI>Ever learn|ing, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</HI></P>
<P>The pre&s;ent age exceeds all others for learning; many have run to and fro, and knowledge is increa&s;ed. Yet va&s;t multitudes are not only de&s;titute of the &s;pirit|ual knowledge of Chri&s;t; but they wander more and more in the mazes of &s;trong delu&s;ion, that they all might be damned, who believe not the truth, but have plea&s;ure in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. For, &s;ays the text, 'Evil men and &s;educers wax wor&s;e and wor&s;e, deceiving and being deceived.' For 'as Jannes and Jambres with|&s;tood Mo&s;es, &s;o do the&s;e al&s;o re&s;i&s;t the truth; men of cor|rupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.' Jannes and Jambres endeavoured to repre&s;ent Mo&s;es as an im|po&s;tor: &s;o do the&s;e men al&s;o re&s;i&s;t the truth, endeav|ouring to repre&s;ent all the prophets as impo&s;tors. 'But they &s;hall proceed no further: for their folly &s;hall be manife&s;t unto all men, as theirs al&s;o was.' Jannes and Jambres were magi, wi&s;e men, who became fools, and were &s;hewn to be &s;uch. And our modern magi are wi&s;e men, in reality, with regard to the &s;ciences; but profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to be wi&s;e with regard to relig|ion, they become fools; and it will not be long, before God will exhibit them as &s;uch to the view of the whole world.</P>
<P>There were giants in the earth, in tho&s;e days of wickedne&s;s which preceded the flood; and there are giants in the earth in the&s;e days, with re&s;pect to litera|ture, exerting their wi&s;dom again&s;t Heaven.

<P N="1">1. Ob&s;erve the remarkable analogy between the la&s;t days of the Jews, and the&s;e la&s;t days of the Chri&s;|tians. The Jews of that time had more knowledge than their ance&s;tors.

The &s;ame is our condition in all the&s;e re&s;pects. Jo&s;ephus tells us, that the young peo|ple among them were fond of innovations: that &s;om|ilies were greatly divided among them&s;elves, and the deare&s;t connexions broke through all re&s;traints, with re&s;pect to each other.</P>
<P>How remarkable the re&s;emblance between the Jew|i&s;h zealots and the infidel Jacobins of Europe! The zealots were great patriots. "They exhorted one an|other to a&s;&s;ert their liberty," &s;ays Jo&s;ephus. "They trampled on the laws of men, and laughed at the laws of God. They ridiculed the oracles of the prophets, as the tricks of jugglers." "They di&s;annulled the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the prie&s;thood, and ordained vile, ignoble, and unde&s;erving per&s;ons for that office, that they might have their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their wicked undertakings." Such has been the conduct of the Jacobins, with re|&s;pect to the laws of men and the laws of God. The con&s;cientious Catholic prie&s;ts were driven from their places and livings, and were &s;ucceeded by licentious and perjured per&s;ons, who favoured the Jacobins, and taught the religion of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The zealots murdered many of the prie&s;ts, and de+&s;troyed the remains of political government. "They erected tribunals," &s;ays Jo&s;ephus, "for the de&s;truction of tho&s;e who were obnoxious to their n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious de|&s;igns. Their thir&s;t was chiefty after the blood of good families. And while they were de&s;troying the people, their terror was &s;o great, that no one had cour|age enough openly to weep for his decea&s;ed friend or relation, or to bury him." Ju&s;t like the conduct of the Jacobins, in Robe&s;piere's reign of terror; with this difference, that the tyranny and wickedne&s;s of the latter have been far more exten&s;ive. And as the la&s;t days of the Jews were more and more perilous, till the time of their de&s;truction; &s;o we may expect that our days will be more and more perilous, till the Chri&s;|tian world are de&s;troyed by fire from heaven: Chri&s;t has expre&s;sly told us, that there &s;hall now be &s;uch a time
<PB N="20" REF="035364_0019_1004A16A6DDEF738">of trouble 'as was not from the beginning of the crea|tion; di&s;tre&s;s of nations and perplexity, the &s;ea and waves roaring, men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after tho&s;e things which are coming on the earth.' Many will tell you that the coming of Chri&s;t is far off, and that the Chri&s;tian world will &s;oon be filled with holine&s;s and happine&s;s.

<P N="2">2. Hence we may expect that the church mu&s;t drink one more bitter cup of per&s;ecution, before Chri&s;t's &s;econd coming.

<P>Some will tell you there is too much knowledge in the world for the exi&s;tence of per&s;ecution. But this is a great mi&s;take. When Chri&s;t and the fir&s;t di&s;ciples were per&s;ecuted, there was more knowledge both among the Jews and Romans than ever there had been in any for|mer period. The true &s;ource of per&s;ecution is neither ignorance nor knowledge, with re&s;pect to the &s;ciences; but wickedne&s;s of heart, joined with ignorance of the|ological truth and the rights of con&s;cience. The inno|cent blood in France, which has run in torrents on ac|count of religion as well as politics within &s;even years pa&s;t by means of the men of knowledge, is a glaring evidence that there may be &s;uch a creature in the world as a patriotic, per&s;ecuting philo&s;opher. In that age of the world, which re&s;embled this, the infidel Romans fir&s;t per&s;ecuted and de&s;troyed a per&s;ecuting church, and then turned their fury again&s;t the &s;aints; &s;o our mod|ern infidels are now per&s;ecuting and de&s;troying a per&s;e|cuting church.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> under&s;tood of Papi&s;ts, as individuals.

Hence learn the wickedne&s;s and folly of tho&s;e Chri&s;tians, who are now promoting infidels, by their &s;uffrages, to important employments in the State, and putting a &s;word into their hand to &s;tay us. They prom|i&s;e you liberty, and loud is their cry in favour of rea&s;on and the rights of man. Believe them not; for they them&s;elves are &s;ervants to corruption. They appear harmle&s;s, at pre&s;ent; but in a few years longer, their power will be great, and the people in general exceed|ingly corrupt and degenerate. Then it will be &s;ound that our calendar, churches, and clergy are attended with lo&s;s to the public&mdash;lo&s;s of time and lo&s;s of money &mdash;and are utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the wi&s;e&s;t political economy.
