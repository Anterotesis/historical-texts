<HEAD>A LETTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LIVING in the country where I &s;ee &s;o few of the London papers, that I hardly know what pa&s;&s;es in the world; but lately meeting with your letter, up|on the &s;ubject of &s;lavery, in the General Evening Po&s;t of the 22d of November; and al&s;o tho&s;e of your friend Africanus, in the preceding papers, which you re|fer to, I have &s;at down to make a few brief remarks upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve that your letters, and all the writings that I have &s;een upon that &s;ide of the que&s;tion, are in the &s;ame declamatory &s;tyle, which may be&s;peak the compa&s;&s;ion of your readers; but when &s;ubjects of &s;uch magnitude are brought before the public, wherein &s;o many individuals are materially intere&s;ted; and even the nation it&s;elf may be involved in the event, they ought to be fairly and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately di&s;cu&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The abolition of the &s;lave trade, and the con&s;equences at|tending it, which would evidently be the breaking up of the Briti&s;h &s;ugar colonies, and the total ruin of a multitude of in|nocent families, is not a little thing. Neither are a few exag|gerated tales told by mariners, or others, who probably may not be competent judges of the polity of the princes of Africa; or the default of tho&s;e towns which you mention, on which the depredations fall: or is an in&s;tance or two of &s;uch inhuman ma&s;ters as Macmahon, if they are true, &s;ufficient to found a law upon to aboli&s;h this trade.</P>
<P>There are various ways which &s;upply the markets in Africa with &s;laves; but the convicts, which you &s;eem to think the principal &s;upport of the trade, are very few, compared with oth|ers that are brought to market.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="020993_0004_0FB16FDCF4FB2410">
The &s;laves &s;old from the e&s;tates of the grandees, who&s;e &s;ole property they are, as much as other &s;tock upon their planta|tions, or as much &s;o as an Engli&s;h farmer by the law of Eng|land is entitled to the &s;tock upon his e&s;tate, amount to a great number; but the principal &s;ource of the &s;lave trade are the cap|tives taken in war, which is indeed often kindled by tho&s;e ty|rannical princes upon &s;mall occa&s;ions, but generally ari&s;es from rebellion or default in the payment of tribute.</P>
<P>When a tribe is conquered they become tributary to the conqueror, and upon failure in the payment, the war is renew|ed, and the captives on either &s;ide are made &s;laves; but cer|tainly this practice is not founded upon their commerce with Europeans, as is often &s;ugge&s;ted by tho&s;e who cen&s;ure the trade. It was the common u&s;age very many ages before the Europeans had any intercour&s;e with Africa: the &s;tates of Carthage, at a very early time, after they grew powerful, obliged &s;ome Afri|can princes to pay them tribute, which was one &s;ource they had to get &s;laves; but the great commerce that the Carthagenians, Numidians, the Mauritanians, and others, who occupied the northern coa&s;ts of Africa, carried on with the Lybians or Ni|gritians, a people who inhabited the interior country that we now call Negroland, was the fountain from whence &s;prung the multitude of blacks which recruited their armies, and &s;erved for labourers and all &s;ervile purpo&s;es as well as commerce, as appears by the fragments of ancient hi&s;tory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the ancient hi&s;tory of Carthage, of Numidia, the Nigritians, the Getulians, the Melano Getulians, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But in regard to the cu&s;tom of &s;eizing and carrying off in|habitants for default in the payment of tribute, we have a very early in&s;tance from divine revelation.&mdash;Several nations of the African race, who held territories in Arabia, were tributary to the king of Elam, and paid him tribute regularly for a number of years, and then rebelled again&s;t him: upon which Chedor|laomer, the king of Elam or Per&s;ia, went out to war again&s;t them, and &s;ubdued them, and was carrying off his booty, of which the principal part was captives, when the patriarch Abra|ham, with his little army, met him. And this expedition was but three hundred and &s;eventy-&s;even years after the flood<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xiv. 4, 16.</NOTE>.</P>

Mr. Clark&s;on, a late writer <HI>on the commerce and &s;lavery of the human &s;pecies,</HI> cites Homer to prove that the &s;lave trade was in practice in Egypt and Cyprus &s;o long ago as the Trojan war; but he might have a&s;certained this fact upon much higher au|thority, and done more than hinted that Homer coincided with &s;cripture in this point. Slaves are expre&s;sly mentioned as a part of the trade of antient Babylon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xviii. 13.</NOTE>; they are al&s;o mentioned as part of the trade of Tyre<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxvii. 13.</NOTE>, and of Haran, a city of Babylon, built by Nimrod<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xii. 5.</NOTE>, and in many other places, as will appear hereafter<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Gen. x. 10. and Ezek. xxvii. 23.</NOTE>. If we trace it further, we &s;hall find that it was not only in practice among the heathen nations, but univer&s;ally &s;o among the wor&s;hippers of the true GOD. Abraham and Lot got &s;laves in Haran, when they were going to Canaan<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xii. 4.</NOTE>. The &s;cripture calls the&s;e people <HI>the &s;ouls they got in Haran;</HI> but if they were not &s;laves, then Bi&s;hop Patrick, Dr. Whitby, and many other learned divines have been mi&s;taken in their com|ment upon this text; and if Abraham's &s;ervants, of which he had a great multitude, were not &s;laves, it &s;eems &s;trange that they &s;hould be enumerated as I&s;aac's inheritance when he was offered in marriage to Rebecca<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxiv. 35.</NOTE>. We are al&s;o told, expre&s;&s;|ly, that Pharaoh, king of the Egyptians, and Abimeleck, king of Gerer, or of the Phili&s;tians, both branches of Ham's family, gave Abraham &s;heep and oxen, and men &s;ervants and women &s;ervants<NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xii. 16. and xx. 14.</NOTE>; and I believe nobody will doubt of tho&s;e pre&s;ents being the property of the king's who be&s;towed them upon Abra|ham. Hagar who was al&s;o an Egyptian, is expre&s;sly called the <HI>bondmaid</HI> or &s;lave of Sarah, over whom Abraham tells her &s;he had ab&s;olute power; and when &s;he run away from her mi&s;|tre&s;s, <HI>the angel of the Lord met her, and &s;aid to her, Hagar, re|turn to thy mi&s;tre&s;s and &s;ubmit thy&s;elf unto her</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xvi. 6, 9. This admonition, according to Mr. Sharp, <HI>was a &s;hameful and notorious breach of the law of God.</HI> See his ju&s;t limitation of &s;lavery, page 53.</NOTE>. The &s;cripture informs us that I&s;aac had &s;uch &s;tore of &s;ervants, <HI>that he was en|vied even by the Phili&s;tines;</HI> who abounded in &s;laves<NOTE N="&sect;&sect;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxvi. 14.</NOTE>. When Jacob met his brother E&s;au, he ordered me&s;&s;engers to go for|ward to greet him, and pre&s;s him to accept of a pre&s;ent of any
<PB N="8" REF="020993_0006_0FB16FE1B8219930">thing he had, and thus enumerates his &s;ub&s;tance; <HI>I have &s;o|journed with Laban, and I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of oxen and a&s;&s;es, and men &s;ervants and maid &s;ervants</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxxii. 5.</NOTE>. When Jo&s;eph was carried into Egypt, &s;laves were bought and &s;old there in open market, which Mr. Clark&s;on admits<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxxvii. 27, 28.</NOTE>. When Mo&s;es was going out of Egypt with the I&s;raelites, it plainly appears that &s;laves were then bought and &s;old there, and that the I&s;raelites were allowed to buy them to carry out with them<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Exod. xii. 44.</NOTE>. And when Mo&s;es form|ed his code of laws for the I&s;raelites, he expre&s;sly points out a people of the &s;ame family, from whom he directs them to buy their hereditary &s;laves; and among the &s;ame laws, in&s;titutes the mo&s;t humane precepts for their government<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Levit. xxv. 44, 45, 46. Exod. xxi&s;t chapter, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If the&s;e in&s;tances from divine writ need the corroboration of profane hi&s;tory, I recommend the reader to the various rela|tions of the ancient &s;lave fea&s;ts, namely the Sacae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">, the Saturna|lia, &amp;c. among the Babylonians, the A&s;&s;yrians, the Greeks, the Romans, &amp;c.</P>
<P>From the&s;e general hints, which the limits of this letter will not admit of enlarging, we may fairly infer, that the traffic in &s;laves is of very early date, and that it was con&s;idered as a legal commerce under the law of Mo&s;es. And if we trace it further with an unbia&s;&s;ed mind, we &s;hall find that it was not aboli&s;hed under the go&s;pel; but, on the contrary, St. Paul frequently ex|horts &s;ervants in their duty to their ma&s;ters, in the&s;e words. <HI>Servants obey your ma&s;ters according to the fle&s;h, and not with eye|&s;ervice</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Col. iii. 22.</NOTE>. <HI>Servants be obedient to your ma&s;ters according to the fle&s;h, &amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Eph. vi. 5, 6, 7, 8.</NOTE> <HI>Let every man abide in the &s;ame calling wherein he is called</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. vii. 20.</NOTE>. <HI>Let as many as are under the yoke count their own ma&s;ters worthy of all honor</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi. 1.</NOTE>. In his epi&s;tle to Titus he &s;ays, <HI>Exhort &s;ervants to be obedient unto their ma&s;ters, and plea&s;e them well in all things, not an&s;wering again, and not purloining, but &s;hewing all good fidelity</HI><NOTE N="&sect;&sect;" PLACE="foot">Titus ii. 9.</NOTE>. <HI>Servants be &s;ubjects to your ma&s;ters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but al&s;o to the frow|ard</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 18.</NOTE>. St Paul mutually admoni&s;hes ma&s;ters re&s;pecting their
<PB N="9" REF="020993_0007_0FB16FE2FAE69148">duty to their &s;ervants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mo&s;es di&s;tingui&s;hes tho&s;e &s;ervants who were con&s;idered as an inheritance, by the name of bondmen, and before Mo&s;es's time they were called by that name. St. Paul calls them by the general name of &s;ervants, or &s;ervants under the yoke, or &s;ervants ac|cording to the fle&s;h. One&s;imus is called Philemon's &s;ervant; but even Mr. Clark&s;on allows that he was Philemon's &s;lave. The prophet Ezekiel calls tho&s;e which were &s;old with ve&s;&s;els of bra&s;s at the markets of Tyre, <HI>the per&s;ons of men.</HI> St. John calls them <HI>bondmen,</HI> and <HI>&s;ouls of men,</HI> and <HI>&s;laves,</HI> promi&s;cuou&s;ly. Gen. xxi. 10. Levit. xxv. 44. Ezek. xxvii. 13. 1 Tim. vi. 1. Rev. vi. 15. and xiii. 16. and xviii. 13.</NOTE>: and he is &s;o explicit in both, that it needs no comment; but he never once hints to his di&s;ciples that it is the duty of Chri&s;tians to emancipate their &s;laves.</P>
<P>The&s;e exhortations are contained in the epi&s;tles and di&s;cour&s;|es which St. Paul addre&s;&s;es to the people of the Greek cities and churches of A&s;ia Minor, Greece and Macedonia, that is Ephe&s;us, Colo&s;&s;e, The&s;&s;ilonica, Corinth, Achaia, Smyrna, Pontus, Galatia, Phrygia, Cappadocia, Bythinia, Athens, &amp;c. where mi&s;&s;ionaries were employed to propagate chri&s;tianity, and where a multitude of &s;laves were held as property. In the little city of Athens only, they reckoned no le&s;s than four hundred thou&s;and &s;laves<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory, vol. 6. page 43.</NOTE>, who were treated in this city with more hu|manity than in other places; yet by the Greeks in general they were con&s;idered as an inferior people, and by the Lacedemoni|ans in particular they were u&s;ed with a &s;everity offen&s;ive to human nature. Ari&s;totle, as Mr. Clark&s;on remarks, advi&s;ed Alexander to treat his Barbarians with rigor; &s;ugge&s;ting that they could not bear gentle u&s;age, but it is very evident that Ari&s;totle does not &s;peak of Greeks or Jews, but of the African &s;laves in Alexander's army; whom, I &s;ay, the Greeks looked upon in a very degraded light, but not more &s;o, by calling them Barbarians, for even St. Paul frequently di&s;tingui&s;hes them by that appellation, which looks as if that name was not a term of reproach.</P>
<P>The Lacedemonians began their commerce in &s;laves at a ve|ry early period with the Mauritarians, and other &s;tates on the northern coa&s;ts of Africa, who &s;pread it all over the Mediterra|nean, and many other places, and it continued among the Car|thagenians, the Phenicians, and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and is at this day in a flouri&s;hing condition in the &s;tates of Barbary, and in the dominions of the king of Morocco, and all over the em|pire of the grand Seignor.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="020993_0008_0FB16FE4A4FA2020">
Therefore if &s;lavery &s;hould be aboli&s;hed by all the nations in Europe, it is evident that even that would not put an end to it; and if it is annihilated in the Briti&s;h dominions only, it can an&s;wer no other purpo&s;e, but to ruin a great many unoffend|ing families, and to increa&s;e the &s;ugar colonies of France, Spain, Portugal, Holland, &amp;c. upon the downfall of ours. It ought to be con&s;idered too, that our &s;lave trade is not of that magnitude that is &s;ugge&s;ted by its oppo&s;ers, and that it bears no proportion to that of other nations. Cooke tells us in the fir&s;t volume of his voyages, page 30, among his remarks at Rio Janeiro, that in that province alone there were &s;ix hundred and twenty-nine thou&s;and negroe &s;laves belonging to the Portu|gueze, which is near double the number that there is in all the Briti&s;h plantations; others &s;ay; that the Spani&s;h colonies require an annual &s;upply of &s;eventy or eighty thou&s;and, but it is an undoubted fact, that the &s;laves imported into the Portugueze colonies in America are more than double of tho&s;e imported into the Briti&s;h plantations. Guthrie &s;ays, they import about fifty thou&s;and &s;laves annually into the Brazils, and it is &s;uppo|&s;ed that about twenty thou&s;and are imported annually into the Briti&s;h colonies. The Portugueze having their &s;laves at a low|er rate from their African colonies than the Engli&s;h can get theirs, may be the rea&s;on that their &s;ugars are cheaper; but I wi&s;h I could impute it to another cau&s;e, which is &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;ome, namely, <HI>That the Portugueze treat their &s;laves with more humanity than other nations,</HI> and therefore get more labor from them.</P>
<P>I &s;hould al&s;o be glad to have it fairly pointed out, how Great-Britain is to be &s;upplied with We&s;t-India produce when this &s;cheme takes place, as it is now become a nece&s;&s;ary of life. Who are we to &s;tipulate with for tho&s;e &s;upplies; and are we &s;ure that we can pay for them in the produce and manufactures of this country? Shall we &s;uffer nothing by having &s;everal millions con&s;umed among foreigners which is now &s;pent among our&s;elves; and is it not a matter worthy of con&s;ideration, how far our navy may be affected when this great branch of trade is lopped off; which now returns annually three or four millions &s;terling to Great-Britain. Or can there be many people &s;o vi|&s;ionary, as to think the project of Dean Tucker eligible, that is,
<PB N="11" REF="020993_0009_0FB16FE5F46ADE78">of replacing this trade by e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;ugar colonies among the natives of Africa, or going to Cochin China for &s;ugar. When this &s;cheme takes place, is will be time to look out for the ac|compli&s;hment of the Dean's prophecy, which he de&s;ires may never be forgotten, and therefore I, for one, record it, which is as follows:</P>
<P><HI>That in the cour&s;e of half a century, Great-Britain and Ire|land, and all Europe, if they plea&s;e, may be &s;upplied with We&s;t-India produce; without &s;laves, without colonies, without govern|ments, without forts or men of war, and without officers and con|tracts</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dean Tueker's reflections on the matters in di&s;pute between Great-Britain and Ireland 1785, page 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I know that the Dean, as well as Mr. Ram&s;ay and &s;ome others, who have wrote upon this &s;ubject, are impre&s;&s;ed with an opinion, that the enlargement of &s;laves would make the We&s;t-India produce come cheaper to the con&s;umer, and that negroes in that condition would become more u&s;eful to Great-Britain, and more profitable to the owners of plantations than they are now; that they of cour&s;e would get into the habits of Europeans, and having families of their own, would be encour|aged to do more labour. But experience informs tho&s;e who have made the trial, &s;o far as re&s;pects their having families, that it has ju&s;t the contrary effect: that there is a greater &s;urplu&s;age from the labour of one &s;ingle man in the cour&s;e of the year, than from the labour of another with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a wife and children, and that this is the general ob&s;ervation. Therefore it is, as &s;ome of you, gentlemen, remark, that the mo&s;t ava|ricious planters always chu&s;e to buy a much greater proportion of males for their plantations; and <HI>that it falls mo&s;tly to the lot of indigent planters to buy females.</HI> Still I think this a great op|pre&s;&s;ion, and requires a better regulation, for I do not &s;ee why a negro &s;lave &s;hould not have every comfort in human life that is con&s;i&s;tent with his duty and the &s;afety of his ma&s;ter. But we have no example of a body of negroes under their own gov|ernment, or in a &s;tate of freedom, making a figure in agricul|ture or u&s;eful arts. If we look into Africa among their coun|trymen, we &s;hall find nothing that favors this opinion. If we have recour&s;e to the African i&s;lands, or other places, where
<PB N="12" REF="020993_0010_0FB16FE83199D488">negroes form the community, we &s;hall find a parcel of in|dolent, improvident mi&s;erable wretches, who out of a &s;tate of warfare with their neighbors, know not how to employ their time. If we form our judgment by the cu&s;toms and manners of Europeans, who are bred up in different habits, and naturally of a different bent of mind, the parallel will not be ju&s;t. Several hi&s;torians of good authority inform us, that the natives of interior Africa remain, in general, at this day, in the &s;ame rude &s;ituation that they were in two thou&s;and years ago; that they have made no progre&s;s in &s;cience, and even in agriculture they do no more than what is extorted from them; but tru&s;t to &s;pontaneous fruits and other adventitious &s;upplies for their &s;upport; that in general they live promi&s;cuou&s;ly with their women, and have nothing of humanity about them but the form: and that wherever any civilization is found among them upon the frontiers, it is owing to the trade which you cen&s;ure. If we look into the deportment of negroes that have come more within our own &s;phere of knowledge; who have had oppor|tunity of improving by the cu&s;toms of white people, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;till perceive the &s;ame indolence and the &s;ame improvidence.</P>
<P>During the late war with America, &s;ome of the United States to the northward emancipated their &s;laves, and tho&s;e &s;laves having lived in the habit of indu&s;try, under humane ma&s;ters, one would naturally think they would be able to pro|vide for them&s;elves when they had their freedom; but a&s;k any candid man from that country, and he will tell you, that more than half of them are become vagabonds in this &s;hort &s;pace of time, and but very few of them are able to provide for them|&s;elves. A &s;mall colony of negroes, not le&s;s than four or five thou&s;and were tran&s;ported from the &s;tates of America, on the late peace, to Nova-Scotia, who had every privilege of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects; lands a&s;&s;igned them for an inheritance; allowed to chu&s;e officers among them&s;elves, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted with rations from government; yet now, in the cour&s;e of a few years are dwind|led away and coming to nothing.&mdash;It is well known how the city of London, and the country about it, was lately infe&s;ted with American negroes. Now I appeal to any gentleman un|der who&s;e particular in&s;pection they came, whether one in a hundred of them would apply &s;teadily to labour; or was fit to
<PB N="13" REF="020993_0011_0FB16FE8F4A77630">take care of him&s;elf. Some in&s;tances came to my own know|ledge of able bodied negroe men that found employ in the country; but never worked longer, than till they got a little money in their pockets, and then got off to &s;pend it, and never provided cloaths for winter, or &s;carce enough to cover their nakedne&s;s in &s;ummer; and wherever they gained a &s;ettlement became a burthen to the pari&s;h.</P>
<P>If I have here given a true characteri&s;tic of negroes, which I think is agreeable to the general opinion of mankind who are acquainted with them; then their enlargement would not have the effect that you &s;eem to expect from it. But if you can make it plainly appear, that it would be for the intere&s;t of pro|prietors to emancipate their &s;laves, there would be no need of parliamentary aid to accompli&s;h your point. Or could you prove what you a&s;&s;ert, viz. that their manumi&s;&s;ion would be of public utility, I have no doubt but admini&s;tration would find ways and means to rai&s;e fourteen or fifteen millions &s;terling to compen&s;ate the proprietors.</P>
<P>Still, if the object of your &s;ociety is nothing more than the re|gulation of the &s;lave trade, and to obtain an act of parliament for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of binding ma&s;ters and &s;laves in their duty to each other, I &s;hould think that every man would unite to promote it: or, if this trade is as you affirm, <HI>contrary to all laws human and divine,</HI> no man would oppo&s;e the annihilation of it; but to make this appear, there mu&s;t be &s;omething more than mere a&s;&s;ertion; or pervertion of texts, or &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of parts of texts to &s;erve your purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It has been too much the practice of tho&s;e who have wrote on your &s;ide the que&s;tion, in order to make their argument more &s;pecious, to accommodate pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture to their own convenience, and do not &s;eem to have &s;o &s;acred a regard to truth as they ought to have, who profe&s;s to write only to &s;erve the cau&s;e of humanity, and I am &s;orry to ob&s;erve, that even Mr. Sharp, the pre&s;ident of your &s;ociety, is not free from cen|&s;ure in this point. In his book, entitled, <HI>The ju&s;t Limitations of Slavery,</HI> he is endeavouring to prove that this commerce is incompatible with the will of GOD; and in one place cites a pa&s;|&s;age from the 23d chapter of Deuteronomy, the 14th and 15th ver&s;es, which he gives us in the&s;e words. <HI>That though the Jews
<PB N="14" REF="020993_0012_0FB16FEA804C08D8">were permitted by the law of Mo&s;es to keep &s;laves, yet there was no inherent right of &s;ervice implied from this permi&s;&s;ion; becau&s;e whenever the &s;lave could e&s;cape, he was e&s;teemed free, and it was ab&s;olutely unlawful for any man to deliver him up again to his ma&s;|ter.</HI> This is a &s;trange doctrine for a legi&s;lature to advance, who makes it death for any man to &s;teal or withhold a &s;lave from his lawful ma&s;ter. But before we cen&s;ure the lawgiver for in|con&s;i&s;tency, let us examine the text, and &s;ee whether Mr. Sharp has given us a ju&s;t interpretation of it. It is the 15th ver&s;e that is alluded to; but it is thus introduced in the 14th ver&s;e. <HI>For the Lord thy God walketh in the mid&s;t of thy camp to deliver thee, and give up thine enemies before thee.</HI> Then in the 15th ver&s;e are the&s;e words. <HI>Thou &s;halt not deliver unto his ma&s;ter, the &s;ervant which e&s;capes from his ma&s;ter unto thee.</HI> Now I think it mu&s;t appear plain to any candid reader, that the text refers to &s;ervants that e&s;caped from the enemy, who encompa&s;&s;ed Mo&s;es's camp. It was good policy, and agreeable to the cu&s;tom of all nations to &s;uccour de&s;erters.</P>
<P>In the appendix, page 22, Mr. Sharp &s;ays, that the I&s;raelites were expre&s;sly permitted by the law of Mo&s;es to give a bill of divorce to their wives, <HI>whenever they plea&s;ed,</HI> and to marry other women, and from hence concludes, that the laws of Mo&s;es <HI>are not con&s;i&s;tent with natural equity.</HI> But this is not a fair repre|&s;entation of the text which we find in the fir&s;t ver&s;e of the 24th of Deuteronomy, where we may &s;ee that this law does not allow of a divorce whenever the hu&s;band plea&s;ed; but only upon a breach of the marriage covenant; &s;o this is not &s;ufficient to mark the law of Mo&s;es with inju&s;tice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Compare Deut. xxiv. 1, with Lev. xv. chap. and Rom. 1&s;t chap. &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the 36th page, Mr. Sharp quotes the 23d ver&s;e of the 7th chapter of the 1&s;t of Corinthians, in the&s;e words: <HI>Ye are bought with a price, be not therefore the &s;ervants of men;</HI> as if St. Paul was enticing &s;ervants to run away from their ma&s;ters. But the words of the text are the&s;e. <HI>You are bought with a price, be not ye the &s;ervants of men?</HI> which the context fully explains.</P>
<P>The bounds of a letter will not permit of my following Mr. Sharp any further at pre&s;ent; but I cannot conclude this letter
<PB N="15" REF="020993_0013_0FB16FEBF40254C0">without remarking the &s;ame di&s;ingenuity in Mr. Clark&s;on; who al&s;o mi&s;leads his readers in &s;ome material hi&s;torical facts. In his e&s;&s;ay <HI>upon the &s;lavery and commerce of the human &s;pecies,</HI> he a&s;&s;erts, page 38, <HI>That it is nece&s;&s;ary for a man to be free, to be a Chri&s;tian.</HI> But I deny this to be &s;cripture doctrine. We are po&s;itively a&s;&s;ured, that all men are alike in the &s;ight of GOD. <HI>Jew or Greek, Barbarian or Scythian, bond or free.</HI></P>
<P>In page 206, he is &s;peaking in favor of a &s;y&s;tem which &s;ome have advanced, namely, that white men and negroes do not differ from each other in complexion or hair, but only according to the climate they live in; and in &s;upport of this hypothe&s;is, he &s;ays, <HI>we cannot have a more &s;triking in&s;tance of this, than in the Jews, who are &s;cattered over the face of the whole earth; yet have pre&s;erved them&s;elves di&s;tinct from the re&s;t of the world by their re|ligion, as they never intermarry with any but tho&s;e of their own &s;ect, &s;o they have no mixture of blood in their veins, that they &s;hould differ from each other: and yet their complexion is different according to the country they re&s;ide in.</HI> But if we inve&s;tigate this point, we &s;hall find it not founded in fact. Mo&s;es married an Ethiopian woman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numb. xii. 1.</NOTE>; Jo&s;eph married an Egyptian woman, from whence &s;prung the two tribes of Ephraim and Mana&s;&s;ah, who of cour&s;e were mingled nations, that is, a mixture of Egyptian and Hebrew blood. King Solomon had at lea&s;t one wife that was an African, and many other foreign women, which mo&s;t probably was imitated by his &s;ubjects. The Jews were &s;cat|tered over all the dominions of Aha&s;uerus, who is called Ar|taxerxes, which contained a hundred and twenty-&s;even provin|ces, extending from Ethiopia to India; and there is a plain intimation in the book of E&s;ther, that when they had re&s;t from their enemies, they mingled with the natives of the land<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">E&s;ther viii. 9, 17. and ix. 27.</NOTE>.

E&s;dras viii. 69, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>In page 245 of the &s;ame book, Mr. Clark&s;on &s;ays, that <HI>St. Paul having converted One&s;imus, who was a fugitive &s;lave of Phi|lemon, &s;ent him back to his ma&s;ter with this addre&s;s. I &s;end him back to you, but not in his former capacity, not now as a &s;ervant,
<PB N="16" REF="020993_0014_0FB16FEF5640ABA8">but above a &s;ervant, a brother beloved. In this manner I be&s;eech you to receive him, for though I could enjoin you to do it, yet I had rather it &s;hould be a matter of your own will than of nece&s;&s;ity.</HI> Now if we look into the 16th ver&s;e of St. Paul's epi&s;tle to Phi|lemon, we &s;hall find a very material part of that ver&s;e &s;uppre&s;|&s;ed, which plainly &s;hows that One&s;imus did continue in his for|mer capacity, that is, Philemon's &s;ervant in the fle&s;h, though he had become his brother according to the bond of chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>After all Mr. Sharp will &s;ay, that though this commerce may have the voice of the people, or of the whole world in its fa|vor, and divine revelation to &s;upport it, <HI>yet it is incon&s;i&s;tent with natural equity for one man to be a &s;lave to another.</HI></P>
<P>Many things occur in the cour&s;e of Providence that may have this appearance to our inadequate ideas of Divine ju&s;tice. What &s;hall we then &s;ay? <HI>Is there unrighteou&s;ne&s;s with God? God forbid. Shall the thing formed &s;ay unto him that formed it, why ha&s;t thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay, to make one ve&s;&s;el unto honor and another unto di&s;honor?</HI></P>
<P>Eve di&s;obeyed the command of GOD, and her puni&s;hment was to bring forth children in &s;orrow; but her innocent po&s;ter|ity were doomed to &s;uffer, and do &s;uffer the &s;ame affliction.</P>
<P>When the &s;erpent &s;educed Eve to ta&s;te the forbidden fruit, he walked erect, and &s;poke with a human voice; but as a pun|i&s;hment for his crime, he was doomed to crawl upon his belly and lick the du&s;t, and be deprived of the form he had appeared in before, and his i&s;&s;ue have continued in that degraded &s;tate to this day.</P>
<P>All the po&s;terity of Adam feel the effect of the cur&s;e denoun|ced upon him. And can we believe that the po&s;terity of Cain alone, who committed &s;uch an atrocious act, &s;hould e&s;cape pun|i&s;hment?</P>
<P>Ham committed a crime for which it plea&s;ed GOD to cur&s;e Canaan.

<P>Much might be &s;aid to elucidate this &s;ubject; but the bounds pre&s;cribed to this letter, will not admit of entering farther into

<HEAD>CASES RESPECTING NEGROE SLAVES, WITH OPINIONS THEREON.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="opinion">
<P>DUDLY CROFTS, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a negroe &s;lave in the We&s;t-Indies, born on his own plantation, who &s;erved him in the capacity of his &s;ervant. Mr. Crofts was made a captain of the new rai&s;ed forces in North-America, for the expedition again&s;t Canada. He, by the indulgence of the colonel, permitted the &s;aid &s;lave to act as a drummer in his company, though never inli&s;ted, the captain all the while re|ceiving his pay as being his &s;ervant. On his returning from that expedition to England, the captain and his &s;lave were taken on board a merchant &s;hip by a French privateer, but the &s;lave was returned to the captain by the French commi&s;&s;ary, as one of the king of England's officers, though it &s;eems the commi&s;|&s;ary's agent &s;igned a pa&s;&s;port (which the &s;lave hath now in his hand) &s;ignifying that he was exchanged as a pri&s;oner of war, and by the commi&s;&s;ary was returned to his ma&s;ter, the captain. Since this the captain hath thought fit to &s;end this &s;lave back to his plantation at Barbadoes, ordering him on board a &s;hip, where he was hand-cuffed, to prevent an e&s;cape; however, by &s;ome means the fellow got to &s;hore, and is commencing an action again&s;t his ma&s;ter for this u&s;age, alledging that as he was in England he is become a freeman.</P>

<PB N="19" REF="020993_0017_0FB16FF45402ECC0">him his drummer or the commi&s;&s;ary's pa&s;&s;port, alters the ca&s;e?</P>
<P N="2">2. Can the captain compel him to return to the We&s;t-Indies, or does a &s;lave, by being in England, become a freeman, &s;o as to maintain an action for his wages, or can the owner &s;ue any per&s;on who detains him for the lo&s;s of his &s;ervice?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I am of opinion that captain Croft's negroe, by his com|ing to, and re&s;iding with his ma&s;ter in England, or by being baptized, does not gain his freedom; and that the owner of a negroe in England has a right to &s;end him to the plantations, or where&s;oever el&s;e he thinks fit; and that &s;uch owner, in ca&s;e the &s;lave will not obey his commands, has a right to u&s;e all nece&s;&s;ary force.</P>
<P>I am al&s;o of opinion, that the captain's negroe, by his &s;erv|ing as a drummer in his company, did not thereby gain his liberty, as he never was inli&s;ted in his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, accord|ing to the articles of war; nor do I think that the negroe's be|ing returned by the French commi&s;&s;ary, as one of the king's officers, makes any alteration in the ca&s;e; as in fact, he was not then an officer of the king, nor could &s;uch negroe, if he had run away from that &s;ervice, have been puni&s;hed by martial law, therefore I am of opinion, that &s;uch negroe is the captain's pro|perty, and that he may &s;ue any per&s;on who detains him for lo&s;s of &s;ervice.</P>

<HEAD>A copy of Lord Mansfield's &s;peech in the ca&s;e of Somer&s;et and Knowles.</HEAD>
<P>On Monday, the 22d June, in Trinity term, 1772, the Court of King's Bench proceeded to give judgment in the ca&s;e of Somer&s;et and Knowles, upon the return of the Habeas Cor|pus. Lord Mansfield fir&s;t &s;tated the return; and then &s;poke to the following purport:</P>
<P>We pay due attention to the opinion of Sir Philip Yorke and Mr. Talbot, in the year 1729, by which they pledged them&s;elves to the Briti&s;h planters for the legal con&s;equences of bringing negroe &s;laves into this kingdom, or their being bap|tized; which opinion was repeated and recognized by Lord
<PB N="21" REF="020993_0019_0FB16FF7436120A8">Hardwicke, &s;itting as chancellor, on the 19th of October 1749, to the following effect: he &s;aid, <Q>That trover would lay for a negro &s;lave: that a notion prevailed, that if a &s;lave came into England, or became a chri&s;tian, he thereby became emancipated; but there was no foundation in law for &s;uch a notion: that when he and Lord Talbot were attorney and &s;olicitor general, this notion of a &s;lave becoming free by be|ing baptized prevailed &s;o &s;trongly, that the planters indu&s;|triou&s;ly prevented their becoming chri&s;tians: upon which their opinion was taken; and <HI>upon their be&s;t con&s;ideration they were both clearly of opinion,</HI> that a &s;lave did not in the lea&s;t al|ter his &s;ituation or &s;tate towards his ma&s;ter or owner, either by being chri&s;tened or coming to England: that though the &s;tatute of Charles II. had aboli&s;hed tenure &s;o far, that no man could be a villein regardant; yet if he would acknowledge him&s;elf a villein in gro&s;s in any court of record, he knew of no way by which he could be entitled to his freedom, with|out the con&s;ent of his ma&s;ter.</Q> We feel the force of the inconveniences and con&s;equences that will follow the deci|&s;ion of this que&s;tion: yet all of us are &s;o clearly of one opinion upon the only que&s;tion before us, that we think we ought to give judgment without adjourning the matter to be argued be|fore all the judges, as u&s;ual in the habeas corpus, and as we at fir&s;t intimated an intention of doing in this ca&s;e. The only que&s;tion then is, <HI>Is the cau&s;e returned &s;ufficient for the remanding him?</HI> If not, he mu&s;t be di&s;charged. The cau&s;e returned is, the &s;lave ab&s;ented him&s;elf and departed from his ma&s;ter's &s;er|vice, and refu&s;ed to return and &s;erve him during his &s;tay in Eng|land; whereupon, by his ma&s;ter's orders, he was put on board the &s;hip by force, and there detained in &s;ecure cu&s;tody, to be carried out of the kingdom and &s;old. So high an act of dominion mu&s;t derive its authority, if any &s;uch it has from the law of the kingdom where executed. A foreigner can|not be impri&s;oned here on the authority of any law ex|i&s;ting in his own country. The power of a ma&s;ter over his &s;ervant is different in all countries, more or le&s;s limited or exten&s;ive, the exerci&s;e of it therefore mu&s;t always be regulated by the laws of the place where exerci&s;ed. The &s;tate of &s;lavery is of &s;uch a nature, that it is incapable of being now introduced
<PB N="22" REF="020993_0020_0FB16FF9403160A0">by courts of ju&s;tice upon mere rea&s;oning, or inferences from any principles natural or political; it mu&s;t take its ri&s;e from po&s;itive law; the origin of it can in no country or age be traced back to any other &s;ource. Immemorial u&s;age pre&s;erves the memory of po&s;itive law long after all traces of the occa&s;ion, rea&s;on, authority, and time of its introduction, are lo&s;t, and in a ca&s;e of &s;o odious a nature as the condition of &s;laves mu&s;t be taken &s;trictly. The power claimed by this return was never in u&s;e here: no ma&s;ter ever was allowed here to take a &s;lave by force to be &s;old abroad becau&s;e he had de&s;erted from his &s;ervice, or for any other rea&s;on whatever; we cannot &s;ay, the cau&s;e &s;et forth by this return is allowed or approved of by the laws of this kingdom, and therefore the man mu&s;t be di&s;charged.</P>

<HEAD>Pari&s;h of Thames Ditton, again&s;t St. Luke's, Chel&s;ea.</HEAD>
<P>A &s;pecial ca&s;e re&s;erved at the &s;e&s;&s;ions came on for the de|termination of the court of King's Bench, in Ea&s;ter term la&s;t.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e was, Charlotte Howe, a negroe girl, was bought in America by Captain Howe as a &s;lave, and by him brought to England in 1781: that in November 1781, Capt. Howe went to live in the &s;aid pari&s;h of Thames Ditton, and took this girl with him, and &s;he continued with him there in his &s;ervice till the 7th June 1783, when he died, &s;oon after which &s;he was bap|tized at Thames Ditton, by the name of Charlotte Howe. That &s;he continued after his death to live with Mrs. Howe, his widow and executrix, who afterwards removed to Chel&s;ea, and &s;he continued to live with her there as before, for five or &s;ix months, when &s;he left Mrs. Howe; that &s;he was all this time childle&s;s, and unmarried, and removed by Ditton to Chel&s;ea, as having &s;erved the la&s;t 40 days in that pari&s;h.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e Lord Mansfield very particularly took occa&s;ion to declare, that the public were generally mi&s;taken in the deter|mination of the court of King's Bench, in ca&s;e of Somer&s;et the negroe, which had been often quoted, for nothing more was then determined, than that there was no right in the ma&s;ter forcibly to take the &s;lave and carry him abroad. That the ge|neral que&s;tion, whether the ma&s;ter might not &s;ue any one who entertained him in his &s;ervice, or for wages, was not before the court, nor was it held that the baptizing &s;uch &s;lave made any
<PB N="23" REF="020993_0021_0FB16FFA52F38060">alteration in his freedom, or that on &s;etting foot in this coun|try he in&s;tantly became emancipated.
