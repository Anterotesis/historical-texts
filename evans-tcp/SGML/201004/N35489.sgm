<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IDEAS increa&s;e and are renewed; error and truth &s;ucceed each other, and appear by turns, like the fa&s;hions of female dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Arts and &s;ciences, like empires and kingdoms, are de&s;tined, by Providence, to flouri&s;h and decay. There is no &s;cience, however u&s;eful, &s;ublime, or perfect it may appear, but will admit the po|li&s;hing hand of improvement; though time too often &s;erves rather to veil, than to di&s;play its perfections. Whatever has been di&s;co|vered, has been di&s;covered by degrees, and, airballoon like, has often been neglected and renewed. Human knowledge pre&s;erves its revolution round the truth, as the terre&s;trial globe does round that luminous body, which cheers us with its rays: but, in the propre&s;s of our knowledge, ignorance &s;till attends, and reigns al|ternately, as darkne&s;s after light. It was many centuries ago, when &s;everal people knew this &s;cience, and, without knowing the cau&s;e, produced many effects; which being &s;uppo&s;ed the work of witchcraft, the performers were put to the torture, in tho&s;e times of ignorance, and, con&s;equently, the art was lo&s;t. I have, my&s;elf, been looked upon, by many ignorant people, in <HI>France, En|gland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> as a magician, by putting &s;everal ladies and gentlemen into <HI>Somnambuli&s;m,</HI> or <HI>Sleepwalking;</HI> and, in that &s;tate, have made them <HI>eat</HI> and <HI>drink, &s;ing,</HI> and <HI>play upon the harp&s;icord,</HI> by telling an unknown per&s;on their di&s;ea&s;es, and pre&s;cribing for them, &amp;c. All the&s;e things appear to them won|derful, and beyond the power of Nature, or of human art; in|a&s;much as they know not the cau&s;e. If you li&s;ten to many Doctors and Apothecaries, who&s;e practice, like their under&s;tanding, is ve|ry limited, they will tell you, that "Animal Electricity and Mag|neti&s;m, Sympathy and Antipathy, &amp;c, <HI>is all a cheat;</HI> there is not &s;uch a thing in Nature." The former is afraid of lo&s;ing his Fee, and the latter, the advantage to be derived from his Gallipot.</P>
<P>In my fir&s;t part I &s;hall give a philo&s;ophical idea of the theo|ry; in my &s;econd part I &s;hall explain the different manners of the be&s;t practitioners of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;cience; particularly that of Dr. <HI>Me&s;mer,</HI> and tho&s;e of the Philo&s;ophical, Harmonic Society, in <HI>Paris, Lions, Bourdeaux,</HI> and <HI>Stra&s;bourg,</HI> &amp;c. I &s;hall neither give the doc|trine of tho&s;e, called the <HI>Illuminated,</HI> at the head of whom is a famous <HI>Hibernian;</HI> nor that, called the <HI>In&s;pirated,</HI> of whom

I &s;hall only give &s;uch prin|ciples as appear to me philo&s;ophically rea&s;onable, and on them lay the foundation of that &s;cience, in the practice of which I have had a great deal of &s;ucce&s;s; and, by encouraging my pupils to la|bour in the &s;ame exten&s;ive field, they may reap the &s;ame advan|tages. It would be too long to recite, tho&s;e of the Ancients, who have written on this &s;ubject; I &s;hall only mention <HI>Flud,</HI> the <HI>Mo&s;aical Philo&s;ophy, Tengelinus,</HI> the <HI>Art of curing by Sym|pathy, Paracel&s;us,</HI> &s;o much known by his <HI>Alkahe&s;tical Tincture,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Digby, Friend, Maxwel, Mu&s;grave, Bacon,</HI> and many more who have treated on that &s;ubject. Among the many who have cured by Animal Electricity and Magneti&s;m, or by Touch|ing, was <HI>Phyrrhus,</HI> King of <HI>Macedon</HI> and <HI>Epirus,</HI> who u&s;ed to touch his patients with his toe; the Emperor <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI> who performed many cures by touching. <HI>Edward, the Confe&s;&s;or,</HI> u&s;ed to touch for the Scrophula, &s;ince him called the King's Evil. Se|veral Kings in Europe have had that gift. <HI>Louis XVI.</HI> when crowned, touched &s;everal patients, &s;aying, "The King toucheth thee, God may cure thee." It is &s;ince <HI>Philip I. King of France,</HI> that his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors have practi&s;ed it. <HI>Valentine Greatreak,</HI> from the county of Waterford, &s;o much known, and called, by <HI>Boyle,</HI> "The Stroker," cured many by Touching; particularly the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and &s;everal of the fir&s;t people in <HI>England.</HI> Dr. <HI>Ga&s;ner,</HI> at <HI>Rati&s;bone,</HI> in <HI>1774,</HI> made &s;everal cures, <HI>Me&s;|mer,</HI> and mo&s;t part of his pupils did the &s;ame; and I think it mu&s;t &s;oon become as familiar to the mind, as the practice of Elec|tricity, Inoculation, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION. ON THE LAWS OF MOTION, IN WHICH ARE EXPLAINED, ANIMAL ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM, BOTH NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Animal Electricity and Magneti&s;m.</HEAD>
<P>THESE words are u&s;ed only to &s;how that &s;uch a fluid exi&s;ts in all animated bodies, and acts imperceptably, as in a magnet; for it might al&s;o be called, a Vital Fluid, Ele|mentary, or Innate Fire, Phlogi&s;tical, or Univer&s;al Fluid.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is now indi&s;putably demon&s;trated, that all bodies, ex|i&s;ting in &s;pace, gravitate towards each other, and attract one another in con&s;equence of their mutual gravitation.</P>
<P N="2">2. Bodies can neither gravitate towards each other, nor at|tract one another, in con&s;equence of their mutual gravitation, unle&s;s they are immer&s;ed in a medium which tran&s;mits, from one to the other, the action to which they yield.</P>
<P N="3">3. That medium is a fluid. A fluid is a body, of which the parts are in motion among&s;t each other. A &s;olid is a bo|dy, of which the parts are all at re&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is, con&s;equently, an univer&s;al fluid, which is the medium of the reciprocal actions of bodies, and which di&s;tri|butes, among them, the various motions to which they yield.</P>
<P N="5">5. The univer&s;al fluid occupies all &s;pace. If it did not, there would be places, in &s;pace, in which bodies could not tran&s;mit action to one another; and, of cour&s;e, the order of the Univer&s;e would be interrupted.</P>
<P N="6">6. There is, then, a kind of plenum throughout all &s;pace: If not ab&s;olutely, it is, at lea&s;t, contiguou&s;ly full.</P>
<P N="7">7. Bodies, moving in &s;pace, have points of introduction, and inter&s;tices, to receive and return the univer&s;al fluid. If it were otherwi&s;e, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to conceive their mu|tual gravitation, and the attraction which is the con&s;equence of it.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="6" REF="046381_0005_1021513F1D4B92A0">
8. The mutual gravitation, and attraction of bodies are produced by the currents, which i&s;&s;ue from one body, and tend towards another, and &s;o reciprocally.</P>
<P N="9">9. The points of introduction which receive, and tho&s;e, which return the currents, are called poles and, as all bo|dies gravitate, and attract one another, of cour&s;e, all bodies have poles.</P>
<P N="10">10. The more &s;pace bodies occupy, the more currents they receive and return, and the greater is the quantity of other bo|dies which they involve in their motions.</P>
<P N="11">11. The motions and actions of bodies are, of cour&s;e, in proportion to the &s;pace they occupy; therefore, the motions of &s;mall bodies are &s;ubordinate to the motions of great ones; con&s;equently, the motions of the Moon are &s;ubordinate to tho&s;e of the Earth; and, of cour&s;e, the motions of the Moon and Earth are &s;ubordinate to tho&s;e of the Sun.</P>
<P N="12">12. Great motions rectify &s;mall ones, in the Univer&s;e, in the &s;ame manner as motions, accidentally excited in a river, are rectified by the general motion of that river. Thus, the motions of men, other animals, and plants, which are moved, and exi&s;t on the &s;urface of the Earth, are rectified by the mo|tions of the Moon and Sun, which the Earth yields to. The reciprocal motions of the Earth and Moon, and the motions of planets, with re&s;pect to each other, are rectified by the mo|tions of the Sun. The motion of our Sun, and of other Suns, which move, like it, in the immen&s;e Space, are rectified by the general motion of the Univer&s;e, which is the perpetual re|&s;torer; and, extending an invariable reflux upon the aberrati|ons of all beings, &s;ingle and compound, combines them in the mo&s;t unbounded harmony.</P>
<P N="13">13. It is the nature of all fluids to te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to an equilibrium.</P>
<P N="14">14. If fluids have a tendency to an equilibrium, all move|ments of gravitation and attraction in the Univer&s;e, which are made in con&s;equence of the univer&s;al fluid, tend, con&s;e|quently, to e&s;tabli&s;h an equilibrium among all bodies, which receive and return the fluid.</P>
<P N="15">15. Therefore, all bodies, in the va&s;t Space, exert their ef|forts to keep up an equilibrium among them.</P>
<P N="16">16. All bodies, in &s;pace, yield, therefore, to a power, or motion, which con&s;tantly excites them to an equilibrium.</P>
<P N="17">17. Motion, determining bodies to an equilibrium, pro|duces Magneti&s;m.</P>
<P N="18">18. The effort which bodies make, to e&s;tabli&s;h an equili|brium, produces Electricity.</P>
<P N="19"><PB N="7" REF="046381_0006_10215140C8DF54F0">
19. Therefore, Magneti&s;m is, e&s;&s;entially, that equilibrium which takes place, between the inward and outward currents; or, in other words, between the motions to which bodies yield.</P>
<P N="20">20. Electricity is no more than the phenomenon produced between two bodies, one of which has more motion than the other: A phenomenon proving, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at the body, which has mo&s;t motion, communicates it to the other, until an equilibri|um of motion be e&s;tabli&s;hed between them.</P>
<P N="21">21. With inequality of motion, there is Electricity; with equality and reciprocity of motion, there is Mag|neti&s;m.</P>
<P N="22">22. It is the purpo&s;e of Nature, that Electricity &s;hould ex|i&s;t, only to produce Magneti&s;m: The former ends, where the latter begins.</P>
<P N="23">23. Such being our doctrine, we call univer&s;al Magneti&s;m, the general equilibrium of beings, ree&s;tabli&s;hed, every mo|ment, by the motion la&s;t de&s;cribed: That motion, perpetual|ly re&s;torative, which involves all other motions, and combines them in a general harmony of the whole.</P>
<P N="24">24. We call univer&s;al Electricity, the general effort of all beings, or all bodies moving in &s;pace, to form one common equilibrium among them.</P>
<P N="25">25. We call particular Magneti&s;m, an equilibrium between two or more bodies, or between all the parts of the &s;ame bo|dy; which takes place in con&s;equence of a particular motion between the Moon and the Earth, produced in con&s;equence of a particular motion, to which the Moon and the Earth yield. There is a particular Magneti&s;m between all bodies, which move or exi&s;t on the &s;urface of the Earth, or that of the Moon; produced by the particular motion, which over|rules tho&s;e bodies.</P>
<P N="26">26. We call particular Electricity, the effort made by two or more bodies to put them&s;elves, reciprocally, into equilibri|um, in con&s;equence of a particular motion to which they are liable.</P>
<P N="27">27. I divide, again, both Magneti&s;m and Electricity, into natural and artificial Magneti&s;m and Electricity.</P>
<P N="28">28. Natural Magneti&s;m and Electricity proceed from the reciprocal and natural action of bodies, relatively to them|&s;elves, in con&s;equence of the natural motions which overrule them.</P>
<P N="29">29. Artificial Magneti&s;m is produced, when proceedings, invented by art, accelerate between bodies, or between the
<PB N="8" REF="046381_0007_10215144DC56B320">various parts of the &s;ame body, that action of Nature which tends to put, either bodies, or the different parts of the &s;ame body into equilibrium.</P>
<P N="30">30. Artificial Electricity is produced, when proceedings, invented by art, increa&s;e the inequality of the motion exi&s;t|ing between two or more bodie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as, for example, when they accumulate, in a body, more motion than it would have, if it yielded to the &s;ingle action of Nature.</P>
<P N="31">31. From what has been &s;aid, it is evident, that there ex|i&s;ts, in all bodies, a peculiar quality that renders them &s;u&s;|ceptible, both of Electricity and Magneti&s;m.</P>
<P N="32">32. That peculiar quality, found in animated bodies, is called Animal Magneti&s;m, or Animal Electricity.</P>
<P N="33">33. Motion alone produces modification in bodies. Re&s;t is the ce&s;&s;ation of all action, and produces no modification.</P>
<P N="34">34. The great motion, in Nature, is that by which all be|ings are mo&s;t univer&s;ally and intimately modified.</P>
<P N="35">35. But the greate&s;t motion, in Nature, is that which, cau&s;ing bodies to gravitate towards each other, produces, equally, their Electricity and Magneti&s;m.</P>
<P N="36">36. Motion, which produces both Electricity and Mag|neti&s;m in bodies, or, in other words, which makes them u&s;e their efforts to bring them&s;elves into an equilibrium; is, con|&s;equently, that which more intimately modifies.</P>
<P N="37">37. But every modification, every alteration &s;uffered by a body, nece&s;&s;arily concerns the duration of that body; that is to &s;ay, &s;uch alteration mu&s;t, ab&s;olutely, tend to expand, to pre&s;erve, or de&s;troy it.</P>
<P N="38">38. The motion which produces Electricity and Magnet|i&s;m is, con&s;equently, that by which Nature pre&s;erves, ex|pands, keeps, and repairs all beings, and makes them go through every period of their time.</P>
<P N="39">39. On &s;uch motion, con&s;equently, is founded the law, which univer&s;ally pre&s;erves and re&s;tores all beings.</P>
<P N="40">40. Electricity is not properly in Nature, as has been ob|&s;erved before, con&s;idering it to be a termination of action; but is under&s;tood to be the mean of arriving at that termina|tion, which is Magneti&s;m.</P>
<P N="41">41. Nature's mode of pre&s;erving is by Magneti&s;m; it on|ly makes u&s;e of Electricity to produce Magneti&s;m: or rather, Magneti&s;m belongs to Nature, forming the fir&s;t of its laws, and Electricity is the accidental effect of the meeting of two or more bodies, that make reciprocal efforts to yield to Mag|neti&s;m.</P>
<P N="42"><PB N="9" REF="046381_0008_1021514748440720">
42. Thence it follows, that to increa&s;e, by artificial means, the Electricity of a body; to remove it from Magneti&s;m, or, what is the &s;ame, to prevent the natural effect of its tendency to an equilibrium with all &s;urrounding bodies; is to act again&s;t that law which pre&s;erves all beings: Artificial Electricity, in|&s;ulating bodies in order to concentrate motion in them, is, in con&s;equence, generally dangerous.</P>
<P N="43">43. It follows again, that making u&s;e of artificial means to forward the equilibrium of the various parts of the &s;ame body among them&s;elves, and the equilibrium of that body with all &s;urrounding bodies; is conformable to the law that pre&s;erves all beings: Artificial Magneti&s;m, then, becomes as u&s;eful as Nature it&s;elf; imitating its general action, or rather de|termining its general action towards particular bodies, in a more accelerated manner.</P>
<P N="44">44. In few words, Nature gives motion to organized bo|dies, on purpo&s;e that they may return it to others in the &s;ame manner as they receive it. It is only by that reciprocal communication of motion, that bodies are united among them&s;elves to form an immen&s;e &s;ociety; and Nature only pre&s;erves them by tho&s;e laws which con&s;titute that phy&s;ical &s;ociety: To interrupt &s;uch a &s;ociety, to &s;eperate a being from it, by any proceedings whatever; is, then, generally doing harm.</P>
<P>On the other hand; to render that &s;ociety more intimate; to e&s;tabli&s;h, in a being, a quicker and ea&s;ier communicati|on of motion, either between the &s;everal con&s;tituent parts, or with the &s;urrounding bodies; is, con&s;equently, doing good.</P>
<P>In the former ca&s;e the modified being is compre&s;&s;ed; in the latter, it is expanded: and a being cea&s;es to live, when its expan&s;ion is &s;topped, and it is no more able to react on other beings, that move with it in the wide Space.</P>
<P N="45">45. Suppo&s;ing that all beings, moving in &s;pace; all bo|dies, great and &s;mall, were &s;uddenly in&s;ulated; the Univer&s;e would be utterly di&s;&s;olved: Its life, then, is the communi|cation of motion; its health or harmony is kept up by an equilibrium of parts: Its death is cau&s;ed by interruption of communication.</P>
<P N="46">46. We have ob&s;erved, that the &s;maller motion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, in the Univer&s;e, are rectified by the greater, even up to the greate&s;t, con&s;idered as a perpetual repairer, which connects and rectifies all motion; and we now add, as a natural con&s;equence of that propo&s;ition, that the more exten&s;ive motions are, the more regular they are.</P>
<P N="47"><PB N="10" REF="046381_0009_102151491C394010">
47. We mu&s;t con&s;ider &s;mall motions, &s;uch as proceed from the action of beings exi&s;ting on the Earth's &s;urface, like mo|tions produced in a river by the rolling of a multitude of peb|bles: Each pebble produces its motion, contrary to the ge|neral motion, which &s;eldom agrees with the motion of a neighbouring pebble; but the general motion of the river tends to regulate, among them, all tho&s;e motions, and cor|rects their particular aberrations. Thus, the general motion of the &s;tars, or of great bodies which the Earth obeys, tends, continually, to correct the particular aberrations which, like|wi&s;e, continually flow from the bodies moving on its &s;ur|face.</P>
<P N="48">48. It is, therefore, in the aberrations of particular moti|ons, that we are to find the real cau&s;e of all phy&s;ical evils to which each being is liable. It is, then, in the general moti|on, which corrects tho&s;e aberrations, that the principal re&s;tor|er of all tho&s;e evils exi&s;ts.</P>
<P N="49">49. Thence, for all &s;en&s;ible beings, is derived the nece&s;&s;ity of watching, and &s;leeping.</P>
<P N="50">50. In watching, all &s;en&s;ible beings are modified, by the general motion which rules the Earth, and the &s;pontaneous motions produced in them&s;elves, or imparted to them by the &s;mall bodies they corre&s;pond with. Spontaneous motions are too often contrary to the motion which rules the Earth.</P>
<P N="51">51. In &s;leep, all &s;en&s;ible beings obey, only, the general motion, ju&s;t now &s;poken of. That motion is the beneficent mini&s;ter of Nature, and is totally employed, in &s;leep, to re|pair the errors ari&s;en during the time of watching.</P>
<P N="52">52. It is in &s;leep, when particular motions are not contra|ry to the general one, that great expan&s;ions, and great repara|tions take place; with regard to men, animals, plants, and, generally, all &s;en&s;ible beings.</P>
<P N="53">53. Thus, may a genuine idea be formed of what is meant by Artificial Magneti&s;m. It is no more than a theory of pro|ceedings, invented to &s;ubject, in a more particular manner than the u&s;ual order of Nature, any being, whatever, to the action of the motion that is the pre&s;erver and re&s;torer of all beings.</P>
<P N="54">54. Since it is through Magneti&s;m, alone, that beings are both pre&s;erved and re&s;tored, it mu&s;t be de&s;irable to know the laws by which univer&s;al Magneti&s;m is practi&s;ed, and the the|ory of the proceedings, by the means of which artificial Mag|neti&s;m is produced; as they are the object of the true art of pre&s;erving and curing, or the true, univer&s;al medecine, the
<PB N="11" REF="046381_0010_1021514C7143C160">only one which Nature avows; becau&s;e it does no more than favour its pre&s;erving and re&s;toring action upon di&s;ordered or|ganizations.</P>
<P N="55">55. Next to the phy&s;ical law, which pre&s;ides over organi|zations, exi&s;ts the moral one, governing our intellectual fa|culties.</P>
<P N="56">56. Since the Univer&s;e is ruled by one &s;ingle plan and ef|fect, the Moral Law, in all intelligent beings, ought to agree with the phy&s;ical one, that rules over all organizations.</P>
<P N="57">57. As the Phy&s;ical Law, the univer&s;al pre&s;erver and re|&s;torer of organized beings, tends, continually, to maintain and re&s;tore the equilibrium or phy&s;ical harmony among&s;t all organizations; the Moral Law, the univer&s;al ruler and re&s;tor|er of all intelligent beings, tends to maintain, continually, and re&s;tore, con&s;tantly, the equilibrium or moral harmony among&s;t all intelligent beings.</P>
<P N="58">58. As all organizations, involuntarily, endeavour, reci|procally, to arrive at a phy&s;ical equilibrium; &s;o, all intellect|ual faculties, reciprocally, try to attain the moral equilibrium among them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="59">59. As there is, in all organized beings, a faculty or qua|lity which inclines them to an equilibrium; &s;o, there exi&s;ts, in intelligent beings, a faculty which prompts them to aim at a moral equilibrium.</P>
<P N="60">60. The faculty or quality here con&s;idered, in intelligent beings, is con&s;cience. From it ari&s;es all involuntary motion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y which all intelligent beings are either re&s;trained from, or prompted to a moral equilibrium.</P>
<P N="61">61. For new ideas, new words mu&s;t be formed.</P>
<P N="62">62. I entitle, <HI>Moral, Univer&s;al Magneti&s;m,</HI> the moral equi|librium of all wills, which, continually, tends to e&s;tabli&s;h that moral law which moves all con&s;cience.</P>
<P N="63">63. <HI>Moral, Univer&s;al Electricity</HI> is the univer&s;al effort, which all con&s;cience exerts, to arrive at the moral, univer&s;al equili|brium.</P>
<P N="64">64. Moral, particular Magneti&s;m is the moral equilibrium between certain intelligent beings, which tends to e&s;tabli&s;h the moral, particular law which rules over their con&s;cience.</P>

<P N="67">67. As, in the phy&s;ical world, particular motions are on|ly &s;alutary, when they agree with the univer&s;al motion; &s;o, in the moral world, particular laws are only good, as far as they agree with the moral, univer&s;al law.</P>
<P N="68">68. In continuing to di&s;play the analogy &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the phy&s;ical and moral laws, by which the world is governed, one might ju&s;tly a&s;&s;ert, that there is a moral Magneti&s;m in intelligent beings, whenever a harmony and reciprocation, both of affections and habits are found among&s;t them.</P>
<P N="69">69. Likewi&s;e, that there is a moral Electricity between in|telligent beings, whenever &s;uch a harmony and reciprocity are wanting.</P>
<P N="70">70. Moral, artificial Magneti&s;m might be deemed a theory of means, invented to produce, among intelligent beings, a harmony and reciprocation of affections and habits. To that theory belong the political in&s;titutions, and the various forms of education adopted by different people, in order to in&s;ure the peace and happine&s;s of &s;ociety.</P>
<P N="71">71. Moral, artificial Electricity might, likewi&s;e, be called the guilty effort, exerted by one or more individuals, to avert the affections and habits by which they are united to their equals, and accumulate them on them&s;elves. Thence pro|ceeds egoti&s;m, which is nothing el&s;e but a kind of moral in&s;ulation.</P>
<P N="72">72.

<P N="73">73. As it is by the effect of phy&s;ical, univer&s;al Magneti&s;m that all beings are, or ought to become found; it is in con&s;e|quence of moral, univer&s;al Magneti&s;m, or the moral, univer|&s;al law which moves all con&s;cience, that all beings are, or become good.</P>
<P N="74">74. To know the law after which phy&s;ical, univer&s;al Mag|neti&s;m is practi&s;ed, and the theory of the proceedings which can either unfold or increa&s;e the energy of that law; is the &s;ole object of the art of pre&s;erving and curing, or Medi|cine: &s;o, likewi&s;e, to know the moral, univer&s;al law, ac|cording to which is produced the harmony of intelligent be|ings, and determine, in all circum&s;tances, the in&s;titutions, the

<P N="75">75. Since, as I have ob&s;erved, the phy&s;ical and moral laws of the world are &s;o ordained and contrived, that, belonging to a &s;ingle plan, they terminate in a &s;ingle effect; whatever, in an organized being, prevents or averts the action of phy|&s;ical laws, ought to weaken, or render more difficult the ac|tion of moral laws.</P>

<P N="77">77. Man, con&s;idered as a phy&s;ical being, is &s;ound, when nothing intercepts the action of the currents &s;uppo&s;ed to put him into equilibrium, either with him&s;elf, or with other &s;ur|rounding beings.</P>
<P N="78">78. Man, con&s;idered as a moral being, is good, when no|thing interrupts the affections and habits which prompt him to tend to the moral equilibrium, both with him&s;elf, and his equals.</P>

<P>Combination is a &s;tate relative, from re&s;t, to the motion of Matter.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="046381_0015_1021515BA730FD50">
In &s;uch relations alone con&s;i&s;ts the proportion of all po&s;&s;i|bles, forms, and qualities.</P>
<P>Matter being only liable to different combinations, the no|tion we have concerning numbers, or arithmetical quantities, may &s;erve to give us an idea of the immen&s;ity of the unfold|ing of po&s;&s;ibilities. Con&s;idering the various particles of ele|mentary Matter as &s;o many units, it is ea&s;y to conceive, that the&s;e units can be combined by 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c. and that &s;uch combinations may amount to an infinite number.</P>
<P>The &s;everal reunions of tho&s;e unities con&s;titute the fir&s;t &s;pe|cies of combination. Then, con&s;idering the&s;e original com|binations as new unities, we &s;hall have as many different kinds of unities as there are po&s;&s;ible numbers; and we &s;hall &s;till be able to conceive the union of the&s;e unities together. If tho&s;e unions be compounded of unities of the &s;ame kind, they con&s;titute the homogeneous Matter: If not, the hetero|geneous one.</P>
<P>Every one of the&s;e new combinations being &s;till liable to be extended, <HI>ad infinitum,</HI> we can ea&s;ily conceive the immen|&s;ity of po&s;&s;ible combinations.</P>
<P>Matter, &s;trictly &s;peaking, having of it&s;elf no quality, is indifferent to any combination; and the properties which it offers are only the re&s;ult of various combinations.</P>
<P>A quantity of Matter in a &s;tate of combination, con&s;idered as forming a whole, is what we call a body.</P>
<P>If, in the combination of the con&s;tituent parts of a body, there is &s;uch an order, that, in con&s;equence of it, there re|&s;ults new effects or combinations, that whole is an organical body.</P>
<P>A whole, in which &s;uch order is not to be &s;een, is called, an inorganical body; though there is none &s;o.</P>
<P>That order is &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;everal degrees of perfection, from which &s;pring the different degrees of organizations.</P>
<P>If, in that order there is ob&s;erved &s;uch a perfection, that from it re&s;ults, not only new effects, but even new combina|tions of the &s;ame kind; that perfection of organization is called Mould.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the divers parts of Matter, as exi&s;ting one without the other, we have then the idea of Place.</P>
<P>A number of imaginary points, which are or can be filled up by Matter, determine the idea of Space.</P>
<P>Whenever Matter changes place, and, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, occupies different points, that change is called Motion.</P>

<HEAD>Motion modifies Matter.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t motion is an immediate effect of Creation; it is, of cour&s;e, the very fir&s;t cau&s;e of all combinations and forms.</P>
<P>That original motion is univer&s;ally and con&s;tantly kept up, by the mo&s;t &s;lender and loo&s;e parts of the matter called Fluid.</P>
<P>In every motion of fluid Matter, three things are to be con&s;idered; the Direction, Celerity, and Tone.</P>
<P>A Tone is that kind or mode of determined motion, which the &s;everal parts have between them.</P>
<P>There are two &s;orts of oppo&s;ite directions; by the one, the parts come near, and by the other, they draw back: Com|bination is operated by the one; Di&s;&s;olution, by the other. All po&s;&s;ible directions are compounded by tho&s;e two.</P>
<P>The equality of motion, in tho&s;e two directions, prevents the different parts from drawing back, or coming near; they are, of cour&s;e, neither in a &s;tate of cohe&s;ion, nor in that of di&s;&s;olution; which con&s;titutes the &s;tate of perfect Fluidity.</P>
<P>Combination or cohe&s;ion takes place, when the direction of the parts of motion is oppo&s;ite, or the celerity towards the fame direction is unequal.</P>
<P>The different &s;orts of motion may be con&s;idered, either in the whole body, or in the con&s;tituent parts.</P>
<P>The con&s;tituent parts of fluid Matter may be combined in all po&s;&s;ible manners, and receive every kind of po&s;&s;ible moti|on between them.</P>
<P>All qualities, either of organical or inorganical bodies, de|pend on the manner according to which the parts are combin|ed, and the motion of tho&s;e parts between them.</P>
<P>A quantity of fluid put in motion, in one and the &s;ame direction, is called Current.</P>
<P>If we &s;uppo&s;e a Current, which, by in&s;inuating it&s;elf in a body, is divided into &s;everal &s;mall currents, very &s;lender, and in the form of a line; tho&s;e &s;ubdivi&s;ions are termed, Very &s;mall Tubes.</P>
<P>When the elementary matter, either by oppo&s;ite directions, or unequal celerities, puts it&s;elf at re&s;t, and acqures &s;ome co|he&s;ion; intervals or inter&s;tices re&s;ult from the manner accord|ing to which the &s;everal parts are combined.</P>
<P>The inter&s;tices of ma&s;&s;es remain permeable to the currents or pores of &s;ubtile Matter.</P>
<P>Every body, dipt in a fluid, yields to the motion of that fluid; whence it follows, that, if a body be in a current, it
<PB N="18" REF="046381_0017_10215160661C60D0">is carried away in its direction; what never befalls a body yielding to many confu&s;ed directions.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>If a body moves from A to B, and the cau&s;e of the moti|on be in A, it is repul&s;ion; if that cau&s;e were in B, it would be an attraction: But if, in&s;tead of being in one or the other, this cau&s;e is in C, it is an intermediate current in which that body is plunged, and the attraction or repul&s;ion are only apparent.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of the apparent attraction or repul&s;ion lies in the relative direction of the currents coming in and out.</P>
<P>In a &s;pace, where Matter admits of no vacuum, there can|not exi&s;t a current coming in, without one going out; and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI></P>

<ITEM>8. How, again, an infinity of tho&s;e gro&s;&s;e&s;t molecules have, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, drawn near the mo&s;t con&s;iderable ones, and &s;tuck to them; which has con&s;tituted ma&s;&s;es, which are become the &s;pring and origin of all bodies.</ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P>Therefore, in the infinite number of the combinations of Matter, which divers notions had either ventured or attempted, &s;uch as were perfect (becau&s;e without contradiction of move|ment) have been pre&s;erved; and, by improving, have formed moulds for the propagation of &s;pecies.</P>
<P>Two particles at re&s;t form an ob&s;tacle to the two channels of the currents which lead to them; the&s;e two channels, not being in the way to pa&s;s directly, join the neigbouring channels, the motion of which they ha&s;ten; and that accele|ration is in proportion to the &s;carcity and narrowne&s;s of in|ter&s;tices.</P>
<P>On the approach of a &s;olid body, the current is accelerat|ed; and that acceleration is in proportion to the compactibi|lity, or &s;olidity of the body.</P>
<P>If the channels of a current, going through the inter&s;tices of the bodies, meet with no ob&s;tacles, they obey their fir&s;t direction; lo&s;e it in the contrary ca&s;e, and experience the ef|fect of a confu&s;ed motion.</P>
<P>The force of currents is in compound proportion to the number of channels in the &s;ame direction, and their celerity.</P>
<P>If, between two oppo&s;ite bodies, the currents, coming out, are predominant over tho&s;e, coming in, thence re&s;ults an ap|parent atraction.</P>
<P>The equilibrium and nece&s;&s;ity of pre&s;&s;ure require, that a current &s;hould not enter into a body, without another, like|wi&s;e, coming out; with this difference alone, that the beams of the current, coming out, are much weaker; becau&s;e they are di&s;per&s;ed, and divergent.</P>

<HEAD>General Ideas on Motion.</HEAD>
<P>MOTION exi&s;ts in every part of the Univer&s;e: All bodies are endowed with a certain degree of motion in proportion to their different organizations.</P>
<P>None are in a perfect &s;tate of re&s;t.</P>
<P>It is, however, impo&s;&s;ible to imagine how<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We under&s;tand here, by Motion, the &s;ingle deplacing of body: But &s;trength, which is the principle of its motion, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> be communicated, propagated; but can never be di&s;troyed.</NOTE> motion de|&s;troys it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Any round body falls off my table, rolls on my chair, falls on the floor. What happens in con&s;equence of it? Does it &s;tand at re&s;t? No. Its motion meets with an ob&s;tacle; it continues, it always exi&s;ts; or, at lea&s;t, it lo&s;es the motion of acceleration, to pre&s;erve only that of it own gravitation. It has comunicated the former to the body which it has touch|ed, whence it has &s;pread in the matter, and &s;o far divided as to have become in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>If there were no animate beings, it would be, perhaps, very ea&s;y to calculate the effect of all po&s;&s;ible motions: whe|ther they be tho&s;e of &s;ublunary bodies, or cele&s;tial ones, which all tend to a common centre of gravity: But, animate be|ings have particular motions, in the adopted &s;y&s;tem of our days; that &s;y&s;tem which con&s;iders Matter only as dead, or, in other words, pa&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>Man is not endowed with the power of di&s;cerning the e&s;|&s;ential attributes of things, and it is only through exi&s;tence and privation that we conceive any di&s;tinct idea of them. It is thus, by the idea of the night, that we conceive any di|&s;tinct idea of the day; and <HI>vice ver&s;a:</HI> For, were we always to perceive the light, that continual perception could not be felt; at lea&s;t, we could neither be con&s;cious of it, nor able to give it any proper appellation.</P>
<P>Through con&s;equence of this narrowne&s;s of our faculties, we are acquainted with Motion, only becau&s;e we know what Re&s;t is. We have &s;een &s;ome beings moving, and others at re&s;t, whence we have infered, that motion did not always exi&s;t.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e that all animated beings which live on the &s;urface of the Earth, &s;hould knock with their feet at the &s;ame in|&s;tant; would they not produce an additional motion? a mo|tion which could not have been fore&s;een, in the laws which
<PB N="22" REF="046381_0021_1021516B9702B388">natural Philo&s;ophers have laid down? That motion al&s;o tends towards the centre of the Earth. But where does it &s;top? Where is it to be anihilated?</P>
<P>If animated matter can produce irregular motions, is not the centre, wherein tho&s;e motions end, to be animated it&s;elf; that it may be proportionate to tho&s;e anomalies, and &s;o re&s;tore the equilibrium and force which are the pre&s;ervers of the world.</P>
<P>I &s;ay more; it is not nece&s;&s;ary to have any regard to the motion impre&s;t upon animate matter, to conclude that which we look upon as dead; for, even the globe of the Earth is animated: All weigh towards the centre of that globe but the gravitation is, in reality, nothing el&s;e but an impre&s;t mo|tion towards a determinate direction. Or, of two things, one mu&s;t ab&s;olutely follow; either, tho&s;e motions mu&s;t be reflect|ed, with new directions, from the centre of the Earth, or, they mu&s;t be de&s;troyed. But, if it be true in the art of rea|&s;oning, the analogy or method of &s;implifying the principle, as much as po&s;&s;ible, is to be con&s;idered as the &s;ure&s;t way of pro|ceeding; we &s;hall be authorized to think that Nature modi|fies, alters, di&s;tributes, rather than de&s;troys. Thus, as we acknowledge, in all organized bodies, a faculty which divides, di&s;tributes, and returns all tho&s;e motions, who&s;e impre&s;&s;ions they receive, or, rather, which are communicated to them; &s;ince we &s;ee that tho&s;e motions are never anihilated; why &s;hould we imagine, in Nature, an incomprehen&s;ible proceed|ing; a &s;ecret quality, which we are not in want of? Why &s;hould we imagine that it does not operate upon &s;pheres, as well as upon individuals?</P>
<P>If the known laws of heavine&s;s, communication of mo|tion, &amp;c. &s;olely belong to dead matter, and animated mat|ter can, arbitrarily, act upon it; all animated forces will on|ly be trouble&s;ome ones, and all will be in confu&s;ion, in the Univer&s;e.</P>
<P>But, if all matter be confidered as animated, then the phe|nomena of the whole world will not be more extraordinary, than tho&s;e of the human body; who&s;e be&s;t phy&s;iologi&s;ts could not explain, a &s;ingle moment of exi&s;tence, if they did not ad|mit an animated principle, the pre&s;erver of it; and which, by laws unknown to us, compen&s;ates all irregularities of pa&s;&s;ions and impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Now, without proceeding any farther in tho&s;e relations and analogies, the paths through which it would be a difficult ta&s;k to pur&s;ue, let us only ob&s;erve, that whatever can be con&s;ider|ed as the centre of the action; as performing the function of
<PB N="23" REF="046381_0022_1021516D2D1E6A40">receiving, di&s;tributing, and &s;ending back the motion; always &s;eems to be productive of a more &s;ubtile matter, more elabo|rate, more unlike dead matter, more near to that which we conceive by animated matter.</P>
<P>Let us, for example, only mention &s;permatic liquors, and the &s;pirits which &s;eem to come out of them to perfect the hu|man body, tran&s;piration, emanations, tho&s;e currents e&s;tabli&s;h|ed between the beings which lead us to imitation, and make us yield to &s;trange motions; &s;uch as de&s;ires, pa&s;&s;ions, fympa|thies, antipathies, &amp;c. even Animal Electricity and Magnet|i&s;m; which &s;eem to be the great ocean from which &s;prings out truly the animated matter.</P>
<P>Nature thus leads us to a way of thinking which prevents us from believing, that the interior part of the globe is a grand receptacle of motion, and, con&s;equently, a grand centre of ac|tivity. Since, in our principles, there are no anihilated mo|tions, what hinders us from thinking that both Electricity and Magneti&s;m are the produce of that elaboration, the par|ticular &s;ecretions of the globe, the principles of that va&s;t indi|vidual's life, its corre&s;pondence with all the world?</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing that general corre&s;pondence of motions well e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, kept up by a &s;ubtile matter, more or le&s;s animated; &s;hould we not, then, more ea&s;ily explain the duration and equality of cele&s;tial motions? For, on one hand, it is a little repugnant to rea&s;on, to imagine an ab&s;olute vacuum; and, on the other, every matter, however clo&s;ely it may be kept, im|plies the idea of a friction, and diminution of motion. Hence we &s;hall find our&s;elves greatly comforted, by an hypothe&s;is which &s;hall &s;how the very cau&s;e of motion in the fluids, which ought to &s;top it; and the difference would proceed from this principle alone, that, in&s;tead of con&s;idering the &s;pace as filled up with a dead and pa&s;&s;ive matter, we &s;uppo&s;e it con&s;tantly traver&s;ed by currents, which both keep up and pre&s;erve the motion.</P>
<P>The decompo&s;ition of different parts of matter, extended through all &s;pace, gives room to the unfolding and increa&s;ing of that matter; which, being originally endowed with the faculty of receiving, is a&s;&s;imulated in con&s;equence of that pri|mitive law; the molecules bearing analogy to them; and even Nature, her&s;elf, however exten&s;ive, is but an immen&s;e laboratory, in which all operations &s;ucceed one another, with|out interruption.</P>
<P>Every motion may be communicated to &s;ome parts of mat|ter, and increa&s;e that which is proper to them; in conform|ity,
<PB N="24" REF="046381_0023_1021516FBB80CDA8">however, to the law given to it by the particular ar|rangement of the body which receives it. Thence it fol|lows, that a motion is never given in the &s;ame manner it is received.</P>
<P>Three blows, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively given with a hammer, on a bell, a &s;tone, or a mattra&s;s, will certainly produce three different effects; though the &s;ame in&s;trument and the &s;ame &s;trength be employed on each of the bodies.</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;olvent, employed to reduce too equal parts of different matter, will produce upon one a con&s;iderable effer|ve&s;cence, whil&s;t the divi&s;ion of the other operates with &s;carce|ly any appearance of motion; in con&s;equence of the difference that exi&s;ts in the configuration of their parts.</P>
<P>Therefore, the increa&s;ing of motion, communicated by a man to a tree, in order to become a centre of motion to re|pair his phy&s;ical aberrations, will be received by the tree, in its way, and returned from the tree to the man, who will al|&s;o return it in his own manner; on account of the particular properties of their different organs.</P>
<P>Of all the magnetic actions (which, con&s;idered attentively, may be looked upon al&s;o as belonging to Electricity, not ac|cidentally, but e&s;&s;entially univer&s;al) nothing repre&s;ents a chain of motion more calm and gentle, and more relative to the re|paration of the animal economy, than a healthy tree, in &s;um|mer time; becau&s;e, being continually placed in the &s;phere of activity, which has operated its gradual growth, alimented by the &s;ame ground, and formed in the &s;ame manner, the gene|ral currents of the world operate upon it with equal efforts; &s;o that it exi&s;ts without any &s;eeming perturbation. The ef|fects produced carry with them a &s;tamp of the &s;ame character and cri&s;is by which the di&s;covery of illne&s;s is produced; by that mean it &s;eldom extends beyond &s;leeping; &s;o that the pa|tients are deprived of their other faculties, only yielding to the repairing action of Nature.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to conceive, that the action which &s;hall proceed from this tree, being added to that which man is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, will ree&s;tabli&s;h, in his being, the equilibrium; which is ne|ver interrupted, but by the decrea&s;ing of motion, occa&s;ioned by divers aberrations; and which, being attacked in the ori|gin of their formations, &s;hall be the more ea&s;ily re&s;olved, and &s;hall oppo&s;e le&s;s re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>After having demon&s;trated, that from the combination of the different parts of matter proceeds a tone of motion, ana|logous to the animal economy, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;how how
<PB N="25" REF="046381_0024_10215173230CC358">man is compo&s;ed; a being &s;o exten&s;ive in his primitive pro|perties, that he &s;eems to have been born, merely to pre&s;ide over the other beings, which are all &s;ubmitted to him, who is edowed with the faculty of thinking, judging, &amp;c. and in whom are connected, as in a common centre, all motions of &s;urrounding bodies; who acts again, in his turr, on the &s;ame bodies, with more or le&s;s energy, in con&s;equence of his will, and the natural tone of his organs.</P>
<P>It is a long time &s;ince the law of the &s;tronge&s;t has been looked upon as the &s;afe&s;t; though it is not always the mo&s;t ju&s;t: But it is now time to explain it according to the &s;trict|ne&s;s of the exception.</P>
<P>Man, in a &s;tate merely phy&s;ical, like all other parts of matter, has the motion proper to his organization, &s;ubordi|nate to the general motion which he obeys in the &s;tate of his &s;u&s;pen&s;ive intellectual faculties. Like them, he unfolds him|&s;elf, increa&s;es, declines; and fini&s;hes, by being re&s;tored to the general ma&s;s, in order to be decompo&s;ed: But, the &s;ta|bility of his exi&s;tence depends on the harmonic parts forming his body, &s;ome of which may be vitiated. In that &s;tate of illne&s;s he &s;inds him&s;elf deprived of a proper portion of facul|ty, which renders him inferior to man in health; he is not in equal affinity with all that &s;urround him, nor acce&s;&s;able to the &s;ame external quantity of animal fluid.</P>
<P>The more he advances, the more his equality of motion di|mini&s;hes; his currents weaken; his humours increa&s;e; cohe&s;i|on is e&s;tabli&s;hed; want of harmony immediately takes place; and he dies.</P>
<P>If the decrea&s;e of motion has produced that havoc, the in|crea&s;e of motion, analogous, communicated in time, might have overcome the fir&s;t ob&s;tacle; and the return of health might have been undoubtedly obtained.</P>
<P>Of all the repairing motions of man, in a &s;tate of illne&s;s, none &s;eems to be more appropriated, than that which he re|ceives from his like, in a &s;tate of health; becau&s;e, coming from the focus communicated to him, it takes a proper direc|tion, with all the analogous character nece&s;&s;ary for its ad|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The motion of man, in a &s;tate of health, will be then powerful in con&s;equence of the other's weakne&s;s; but, that empire of &s;trength being only employed to eradicate illne&s;s, in&s;tead of oppre&s;&s;ing the individual, that great function of hu|manity &s;hall be a &s;ituation more adapted for &s;ociety; con&s;e|quently,

<P>In order the better to unfold tho&s;e proceedings, I mu&s;t be permitted to employ &s;ome compari&s;ons, which perhaps may appear &s;trange, but which will tend to elucidate, phy&s;ically, tho&s;e proceedings; by the exi&s;tence of a doubtle&s;s fluid, ridi|culou&s;ly denied by many, becau&s;e they do not &s;ee it.</P>
<P>The feruginous matters of the magnetic currents of the world, will acquire a property they had not before, and be|come Magnets, or Load&s;tones, by the mere operation of Nature.</P>
<P>In many ca&s;es, art can imitate Nature, and even &s;urpa&s;s it. (As an authentication) an artificial Magnet is, &s;pecifically, more active than a natural one.</P>
<P>Nature, con&s;tant in her proceedings, by giving a magnetic virtue to a quantity of iron, does not determine its poles, but in the points which are diametrically oppo&s;ite, and in the right line.</P>
<P>It is natural to conclude, hence, that Nature has a uniform manner of acting; but, directed by the knowledge of man, &s;he is &s;u&s;ceptible of increa&s;ing that power, and of concentra|tion, by her &s;trength in a determined point.</P>
<P>That there exi&s;ts an invi&s;ible fluid, from its action upon iron, is well demon&s;trated. Is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Great and Supreme Architect of the world, in his &s;hining and profound views, would have created the general currents which apparently rule the Univer&s;e, only to put in activity a part of Matter, called Iron; to form artificial Magnets, which, in their turn, &s;hould be only empowered to in&s;truct us how the tendency and reciprocity of the action of bodies, one towards the other are exerci&s;ed; as has been demon|&s;trated?</P>
<P>In that great hypothe&s;is, let us &s;ee if the parts of Matter are not formed in &s;uch a manner, as to participate of the &s;ame advantages.</P>
<P>Of metallic matters, united in a ma&s;s in &s;ome places, or &s;pread abroad therein, none is &s;o much diffu&s;ed as iron: Al|mo&s;t all bodies, &s;ubmitted to analogies, furni&s;h a quantity, more or le&s;s con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Vegetables contain &s;ome al&s;o; and it may be e&s;tabli&s;hed as a principle in animal fluid: A proof of which appears, in a certain quantity of it being extracted from blood. Iron en|ters into the compo&s;ition of man, and is combined in &s;uch a

I have &s;een Mi&s;s Eloi&s;a Walke, in Dublin, who had the &s;ame power.</NOTE> people have the power of moving the needle of the compa&s;s, by only approaching the finger to it.</P>
<P>Thence it is ea&s;y to conclude, that the general currents po&s;&s;e&s;s the quality of putting iron into action.</P>
<P>Man, by his con&s;titution, will be &s;trongly &s;aturated with that matter, expo&s;ed, in a regular manner, to the action of tho&s;e &s;ame currents; and ought to acquire more magnetic faculty, and, con&s;equently, more means to prevail over his like.</P>
<P>In that circum&s;tance, the will of him who gives mu&s;t be ab&s;olute. It is that which more particularly determines the fluid to be directed, with vehemence, towards the extremities, whence it e&s;capes; becau&s;e, in a motion which tends to make a vacuum, all contiguous parts are forced to accumulate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear the place where it operates.</P>
<P>From that principle, a &s;ick man may be in a &s;tate of im|perfection, compared to a &s;teel bar; and is in that &s;tate of imperfection, becau&s;e he has not received the magnetic ope|ration: And a whole&s;ome man, able to magneti&s;e, re&s;em|bles an artificial magnet, the harmony being completely un|folded; becau&s;e the regularity of its fibres, in which the magnetic effluvia is always accumulating, has determined the action upon it. Con&s;equently, to magneti&s;e a man, or im|pregnate a piece of &s;teel with a magnetic power, is very near|ly the &s;ame, in communicating the action of the &s;ame fluid; received according to the law of the different modifications of two different bodies.</P>
<P>It will happen, for a time, that bodies acting will cea&s;e to produce their effects upon the receiving one. That point of time, in the &s;teel bar, is the period of the ab&s;olute regularity of its fibres or pores, which &s;hall produce the reciprocal equi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rium; and, in man, is that, when the ob&s;tacles are van|qui&s;hed by the efforts of the fluid, and, where the parts be|ing in harmony together, the re&s;ult is an in&s;en&s;ibility to the action.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance, being more or le&s;s di&s;tant, partakes of the nature of ob&s;tacles in the place they occupy, and accord|ing to the antiquity of their exi&s;tence. Two whole&s;ome per|&s;ons,

<P>The &s;ame phenomenon takes place between two bars, weakly impregnated with a magnetic power. By &s;trength|ening them, alternately, one by the other, their power is in|&s;en&s;ibly increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>There exi&s;t many ways of magneti&s;ing, which ought all to be &s;ubordina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to circum&s;tances, to different maladies, to &s;en|&s;ations of the patient, and to the reaction of the magneti&s;er; which I &s;hall explain herea&s;ter.

In &s;uch a ca&s;e, power united with ignorance may be truly compared to a loaded pi&s;tol in the hands of a child.</P>
<P>Action and reaction are commonly more &s;en&s;ible at a cer|tain di&s;tance, than in too near a po&s;ition; becau&s;e that reci|procal &s;en&s;ations are confounded, and have no di&s;tinctive cha|racter, whil&s;t pa&s;&s;ing through the medium of the &s;urrounding fluid, of which all the molecules are ela&s;tic: Tho&s;e &s;erving as conductors to actions, act again in proportion to the ob|&s;tacles intended to be overcome.</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes happens, that though the exi&s;tence of a di&s;|ea&s;e be evidently demon&s;trated, by certain, unequivocal &s;igns; yet the action of the univer&s;al agent, in its immediate ap|plication, is in&s;en&s;ible to the patient.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a ca&s;e we ought to think, that this fluid impercep|tibly pa&s;&s;es on the local vice; becau&s;e of the ob&s;tacles being too ancient, and, con&s;equently, in a &s;tate of too con&s;iderable cohe&s;ion: That the ma&s;s of the fluid molecules, exi&s;ting be|tween the patient and the magneti&s;er, is not &s;trong enough, in proprtion to the re&s;i&s;tance of cohe&s;ion to be overcome. Then, after having been in communication with the patient, by touching, one directs the extermities of the hands over the parts which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be affected.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, with &s;ome degree of attention to particu|lar &s;en&s;ations, one mu&s;t feel, at the extremities of his fingers, a reaction of heat, or cold, or &s;upinene&s;s; which &s;hall give

This phenomenon is produced, merely becau&s;e at that di&s;tance there exi&s;ts, between the magneti&s;ed and magneti&s;er, a &s;ufficient co|lumn of fluid, put into vibration by the combination of the action and the ab&s;olute <HI>will</HI> of the magneti&s;er; which, di|recting and accumulating all fluid molecules in the &s;ame point, determines, in this circum&s;tance, all the patient's &s;en&s;ations. This mode of operating &s;till reunites the advantages of com|manding, and changing, at plea&s;ure, the centre of activity, when it is peceptible that, by mean of reaction, it may pro|duce a &s;tronger perturbation; which it is always material to avoid. A compari&s;on will form an ample elucidation, on the diver&s;ity of di&s;tances.</P>
<P>A gun, loaded with a ball, fired, within twenty yards, at a piece of timber of a certain thickne&s;s (this is only an <HI>hypo|thetical datum,</HI> which is to be con&s;idered as a mere relative) &s;hall not, at &s;uch a di&s;tance, produce the &s;ame effect, as at the &s;pace of, or within fifty; becau&s;e the ball &s;hall not have acquired, in the former ca&s;e, the degree of celerity impre&s;t on it by the re&s;i&s;tance of the column of air, which it, as with velocity, pa&s;&s;ed in the fifty yards: But, be&s;ides, after the di&s;tance wherein is produced the greate&s;t effort of the ball, whatever it pa&s;&s;es over dimini&s;hes the more its celerity; and its effects have a certain term, and will, in the end, equal that of the former di&s;tance.</P>
<P>From all that has been &s;aid, I mu&s;t conclude, that motion is the principle of the permanent exi&s;tence of the Univer&s;e.</P>
<P>From the combination of many partial motions, the re&s;ult is a more con&s;iderable one.</P>

When man &s;uffers, all the action of life is directed towards him, in order to de&s;troy the cau&s;e of &s;uffering; likewi&s;e, when two per&s;ons are acting on each other, the whole power of that union acts on the di&s;ordered parts, with a force proportioned to the increa&s;e of the ma&s;s. It may, therefore, be in general a&s;&s;erted, that the action of Animal Electricity and Magneti&s;m, &amp;c. increa&s;es in proporti|on to the ma&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible to direct the action of Animal Electricity and Magneti&s;m, &amp;c. more particularly on any individual part, by fixing your <HI>idea,</HI> and directing the fluid upon the part affect|ed. Our arms may be con&s;idered as conductors to the animal fluid, and &s;erve to attract or repel, according to our <HI>will,</HI> and e&s;tabli&s;h a kind of continuity between bodies. It follows, from what has been &s;aid on the mo&s;t advantageous po&s;ition of two beings, acting on each other in order to maintain the har|many of the whole; that one ought to touch the right part with the left arm, and the right foot in contact with the left, &amp;c. In that po&s;ition you are in affinity with your patient; your two <HI>atmo&s;pheres</HI> are joined: It &s;hows the oppo&s;ition of poles in the human body, which are nearly the &s;ame as tho&s;e which may be ob&s;erved in the Load&s;tone, or Artificial Mag|net.</P>
<P>Paracel&s;us, as well as many other anatomi&s;ts, have admit|ted poles in man. Mr. George Adams, in his Treati&s;e on
<PB N="33" REF="046381_0032_1021518992909040">Magneti&s;m, ju&s;tly &s;ays, <Q>In &s;ome future period it may be di&s;covered, that mo&s;t bodies are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a polarity, as well as one direction relative to the various affinity of the elements of which they are compounded.</Q> The better <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> conceive the poles of the human body, we ought to con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|der man as divided into two parts, by a line drawn from the top to the <HI>pubis.</HI> All the joints of the left part may be con&s;idered as poles, oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e corre&s;ponding there|with. The fluid pa&s;&s;es out more &s;en&s;ibly, and in greater a|bundance from the extremities; as tho&s;e extremities are con&s;i|dered as poles oppo&s;ite to the right, and are the be&s;t conduct|ors of the animal fluid.</P>
<P>You may give polarity to animate and inanimate bodies; that is to &s;ay, to increa&s;e an action to a degree which they had not before, only by a friction, very nearly re&s;embling that which you give to a piece of &s;teel, before it becomes a Magnet; except that it will not be &s;o palpable. You may al&s;o change the poles in the human body, pretty nearly the &s;ame as you change tho&s;e of a Magnet. You may al&s;o &s;trengthen or increa&s;e the action of Animal Electricity and Magneti&s;m, by animate and inanimate bodies, as you increa&s;e the action of an artificial Magnet, by adding more Magnets; provided the poles are contrary: Therefore, every thing is filled in the Univer&s;e by means of an univer&s;al fluid, in which all bodies are immer&s;ed; and, con&s;equently, all beings touch one another, in con&s;equence of the continual circulation by which the currents of the magnetic fluid flow out and pa&s;s in. In con&s;equence of this, you may affect a per&s;on at a di&s;tance; provided he be of a weak habit of body, and has been in a <HI>cri&s;is</HI> before you put the column of air into vibration, which exi&s;ts between the per&s;on you treat and your&s;elf: That will affect him, as is &s;een at a concert in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, or other places.</P>
<P>In order to be in affinity or harmony with your patients you mu&s;t touch him by the hand. As there is a circulation which forms it&s;elf between you and him, and tends to an equilibrium, it is generally, by that mean, ea&s;ier to take your patient out of his <HI>cri&s;is.</HI></P>
<P>You next hold up both your hands parallel to the <HI>bead,</HI> and bring them gently down as far as the <HI>pubis:</HI> You may follow the direction of the nerves. Then &s;ix you hands upon the <HI>diaphragm</HI> or <HI>&s;tomach,</HI> where lies the greate&s;t abundance of nerves. You may put your thumbs upon the <HI>plexus,</HI> and
<PB N="34" REF="046381_0033_1021518B549B0258">put the nerves in motion. You may al&s;o &s;ix one hand upon the &s;tomach, and draw the other towards you: By that mean you attract, or repel at plea&s;ure. There are various ways of manipulation, which the operator makes u&s;e of according to circum&s;tances. If you wi&s;h to procure <HI>&s;leep,</HI> &s;oon change your po&s;ition; get either to the right or left &s;ide of your patient. In that po&s;ition, you &s;ix one of your hands <HI>before</HI> the head, and the other, <HI>behind.</HI> Keep them there, with all your might, till you &s;eel &s;ome heat in the palms. If the per&s;on is not inclined to &s;leep, you mu&s;t charge the head in different direc|tions, by &s;hutting your hands, as if you were boxing; then you open them quick; and this you repeat often. The per|&s;on then &s;eels a drow&s;ine&s;s. You mu&s;t keep your hands in oppo&s;ition, as before. By tho&s;e means the animal fluid gets into the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els; acts al&s;o upon the nerves; which &s;timulates the body, and produces a <HI>cri&s;is.</HI> If you &s;ee the pa|tient too much agitated, get oppo&s;ite to him, and bring both your hands downwards, from head to foot, or, as if you were to fan a per&s;on; and, getting backwards, it will compo&s;e him.</P>
<P>Then you &s;eek for the cau&s;e and place of the illne&s;s; or, you hold the per&s;on's hand, and a&s;k him where he &s;eels pain; as it is increa&s;ed by treating. If he does not an&s;wer your que&s;tions properly, it is a &s;ign he is not in a perfect &s;tate of <HI>Somnambuli&s;m.</HI> You mu&s;t keep him a&s;leep longer, without &s;peaking to him.</P>
<P>You then &s;eek for the &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e, by extending your hands at a little di&s;tance from his body, beginning from head to foot. If your &s;en&s;ations are good, you may, with a little attention, &s;eel within your&s;elf, pains, in the &s;ame part in which the patient is affected: Or you may &s;eel, at the ends of your fingers, a heat, if it is an inflamation, or ob|&s;truction. If you feel a coldne&s;s, it is in the lymphatic ve&s;|&s;els. If billious, you &s;eel a numbne&s;s; and many other ways, which different con&s;titutions &s;eel.</P>
<P>Either of the&s;e circum&s;tances will inform you where the di&s;ea&s;e lies: But, by touching, which is the &s;ure&s;t way, you &s;oon become certain of the &s;eat and cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e; which &s;ometimes lies in the &s;ide oppo&s;ite to the pain, particu|larly in nervous affections, &amp;c.</P>
<P>You may touch, if you like, the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, or charge it, as you do the head: by tho&s;e means you keep up the &s;ymptomatical pain, till you have rendered it critical;
<PB N="35" REF="046381_0034_1021518D4E0222C8">you &s;econd the effort of Nature again&s;t the cau&s;e of the di&s;|ea&s;e, and act like a &s;timulus; which will produce a &s;alutary <HI>cri&s;is,</HI> by putting the whole frame in action; which will re|move any di&s;ea&s;e proceeding from ob&s;truction, &amp;c. After this the patient finds him&s;elf compo&s;ed, and the cau&s;e of the di&s;order dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>When the patient is a&s;leep, you a&s;k him if it is time to take him out of it. If he an&s;wer, Yes; draw your hands towards his head, down to the feet, and rub the eyes with your thumbs &s;everal times; and wave your hands, as if fan|ning a per&s;on who is too hot. You get, by degrees, back|wards, till he is recovered.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of mo&s;t part of di&s;ea&s;es is an <HI>irritability,</HI> or <HI>&s;ever dibility,</HI> or <HI>ob&s;truction.</HI> By the flowne&s;s or abolition of moti|on is produced an <HI>ob&s;truction</HI> or <HI>debility,</HI> and by its accelertion, an <HI>irritability, in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation,</HI> and <HI>&s;ever.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;eat of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es is generally in the <HI>vi&s;cera;</HI> as, the <HI>inte&s;tines,</HI> the <HI>&s;pleen,</HI> the <HI>liver,</HI> the <HI>epiploon, me&s;entery,</HI> the <HI>loins,</HI> &amp;c. In women, the <HI>&s;tomach,</HI> the <HI>womb,</HI> &amp;c. The&s;e aberra|tions or ob&s;tructions are an impediment in the circulation of one part, which pre&s;&s;es on the blood or lymphatic ve&s;&s;els, and on the nerves; which produces tho&s;e &s;pa&s;ms, becau&s;e the flu|id circulates &s;lowly. For that rea&s;on, tho&s;e per&s;ons are the &s;oone&s;t affected, and put into a <HI>cri&s;is,</HI> when they are labouring under tho&s;e maladies. If tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els pre&s;s upon the root of a nerve, the motion and &s;en&s;ibility of the corre&s;ponding parts are quite &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; as in an apoplexy, pal&s;y, &amp;c. There are no better conductors for the animal fluid, than the nerves; as they are &s;pread all over the body. They abound more par|ticularly in the diaphragm, &s;tomatical and ombelical <HI>plexus;</HI> where lie the roots of the nerves, which extend their branches (as a tree does its branches and roots in the Earth) all over the body.</P>
<P>Many philo&s;ophers have thought, that in them the &s;oul lies. It is through them that the <HI>Somnambules</HI> &s;ee in the dark, when their eyes are &s;hut. When you treat a per&s;on, you mu&s;t fol|low, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the direction of the nerves. You may treat at a &s;mall di&s;tance, and fix your hand upon the part affected; and, by motion, you put the column of air (exi&s;ting between you and the patient) into vibration; which will cau&s;e an irritation, and produce a <HI>cri&s;is.</HI></P>
<P>Many profe&s;&s;ors make u&s;e of conductors, either gla&s;s, &s;teel, &s;ilver, or gold, about eight inches long. They have a good
<PB N="36" REF="046381_0035_10215193CD332680">effect in &s;ome ca&s;es. All this proceeds from the idea of the operator. Mr. Me&s;mer tells us, <Q>When you make u&s;e o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> conductors, you mu&s;t magneti&s;e from right to right;</Q> that is, the poles are changed. I have repeatedly produced the &s;ame effect, by treating from left to left; except when I have put a per&s;on into &s;leep, without a conductor. If, while a|&s;leep, I magneti&s;ed them from right to right, &s;ome have gone into a <HI>cri&s;is;</HI> others have awaked. If you touch the forehead with your right hand, you mu&s;t put your left in oppo&s;ition behind; and in the &s;ame manner to any other part of the bo|dy; becau&s;e there is a reaction of fluid, from one pole to the other. like a Magnet. As Dr. Me&s;mer repre&s;ents the human body as a Magnet; if you e&s;tabli&s;h the north to the right the left becomes the fourth, and the middle, like the equator which is without predominant action. I repeat it; It is mo&s;t advantageous to be oppo&s;ite the per&s;on you want to treat, it order to cure him effectually.</P>
<P>Curing con&s;i&s;ts in ree&s;tabli&s;hing the di&s;turbed harmony. The general remedy is the application of the animal fluid, which &s;erves to ree&s;tabli&s;h the equilibrium which is lo&s;t in &s;ome part of the body.</P>
<P>As there is but one di&s;ea&s;e, there is but one remedy. If motion is dimini&s;hed, it ought to be increa&s;ed: If there is too great irritability, it ought to be decrea&s;ed. As it is on &s;olid bodies that this fluid operates, particularly on our <HI>vi&s;cera,</HI> in order to rectify them; as they are de&s;tin|ed, by Nature, to prepare, to di&s;&s;olve, and a&s;&s;imulate ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> humours; they &s;hould be brought to their equilibrium, by any means whatever; either by employing internal or ex|ternal remedies: But we ought to be very cautious how we admini&s;ter them, except &s;uch as the patients will order for them&s;elves, or pre&s;cribe for others; which are generally very &s;imple.</P>
<P>There are few remedies, taken internally, which are good; becau&s;e, when received into the &s;tomach and the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, they experience the &s;ame elaboration as our aliments; the parts of which, analogous to our humours, are a&s;&s;imulated there by chylification; and the heterogeneous particles are ex|pelled by the means of excretions. Tho&s;e remedies, which may be given, will often prove to have effects contrary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the intentions of the pre&s;criber; becau&s;e mo&s;t of them a very aqueous, &s;timulate too much, and will increa&s;e irritati|on, &s;pa&s;ms, &amp;c. and produce effects di&s;cordant to the harm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ny

<P>If treating is not &s;ufficient to produce vomiting, in the ca&s;e of a per&s;on who has too much putridity, or abundance of bile which has been too long &s;tanding; then a gentle eme|tic is to be given; or magne&s;ia, if there is too much acid. If alkali is predominant, order a &s;olution of &s;oluble tartar, or other acid which you think will agree with your patient. In ca&s;e of a violent cholic and co&s;tivene&s;s, or &s;ore throat, in|jections are the be&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the general remedies which ought to be admini|&s;tred to the patients; as I am &s;ure that all tho&s;e preparations of minerals, &amp;c. which we &s;ee in an apothecary's &s;hop, were never intended by Nature for the human body. Modern phy|&s;icians have, from an interre&s;ted view, neglected the know|ledge of the vegetable kingdom, more adapted by Providence for the human body.</P>
<P>The diet of the patient is whatever Nature points out to him. She dictates what every man ought to follow; becau&s;e &s;he &s;eldom deceives us in our manner of living. It is not what we eat, nor the quantity, which does good: It is what we dige&s;t.</P>
<P>Animals, by in&s;tinct, will never touch any thing, but what Nature has dictated to them. In this, their in&s;tinct is far &s;u|perior to our rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Spirituous liquors are forbidden; &s;trong, green tea, with|out milk; coffee; hot aliments, and the u&s;e of &s;nuff; be|cau&s;e it irritates the pituirary membranes in the throat, the &s;tomach, and the head; and will produce cri&s;pation, and irri|tation.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual drink may be, water with a bit of toa&s;t in it; wine and water, or good, rich wine; old &s;mallbeer; good porter; lemonade, or different &s;yrups: All the&s;e may be or|dered, according to the ca&s;e of the patient.</P>
<P>The eating may be, good broth, either of beef, mutton, or veal; chicken, boiled; and roa&s;ted meat. Avoid any &s;alt or fat meat. Make u&s;e of any fallads, good, ripe fruits, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Gentle exerci&s;e in an open air, either riding or walking; and cold or warm baths are mo&s;t excellent. The drinking of &s;ome mineral waters is good.</P>
<P>In fact, a good ob&s;erver (though not a phytician) may cure more people than a man of the faculty; becau&s;e a doctor ne|ver

<P>If you have but one patient, and cannot move him out o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|bed, gather round him as many healthy per&s;ons as you can: Make them rub their hands well; then make them hold one another, and communicate to the patient. This is what I call, Forming a chain. By that you communicate to him the animal fluid, which will vivify him, if he is too much debi|litated. You may &s;eat him upon an in&s;ulated &s;tool, as when you electrify a per&s;on. You may &s;eat him upon a chair, and make a healthy per&s;on &s;it upon the &s;ame chair; back to back. You may magneti&s;e a tree in a garden: You may have one in your room, or a &s;mall re&s;ervoir. There are various ways, which depend upon the idea of the magneti&s;er.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal ways of treating and curing. For that effect, much attention and prudence is required; and an ho|ne&s;t man, willing to do good to his fellowereatures who la|bour under any infirmities, will never treat his patients in public, nor make them walk in their &s;leep, or do many other things. The&s;e things may convince many incredulous people of the effects; but cannot do good to the patient. I will &s;ay al&s;o, that a per&s;on cannot treat more than two or three pati|ents in a day, to do them ju&s;tice; and tho&s;e who do treat more, &s;eldom cure by magneti&s;ing alone. The patients may fancy they have been cured; but, if they had not been &s;o treated, they might al&s;o have been well. As their treatments are long, Nature operates and is a better doctre&s;s.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome who will firmly a&s;&s;ure you, that they have cured people at the di&s;tance of two or three hundred miles off, without ever having &s;een the patients, or putting them into <HI>cri&s;es.</HI> I will an&s;wer them. They are either fools or mad|men. Their imaginations being heated with this idea, they are like vi&s;ionaries.</P>
<P>I knew an ingenious phy&s;ician, who &s;aw every body with the yellow jaundice; and another, who thought every body had a <HI>virus</HI> in the blood, and treated all his patients, as hav|ing a <HI>gallicus morbis;</HI> and another, who pretended to cure every body, only by looking at them: All the&s;e are &s;ome de|grees of in&s;anity.</P>
<P>I knew &s;everal per&s;ons, who &s;uppo&s;ed I had been treating them after I had left their hou&s;es. They fell a&s;leep, &s;ome twenty miles off; and they have related this, as a fact, to &s;e|veral of their friends; while I was amu&s;ing my&s;elf, and ne|ver
<PB N="39" REF="046381_0038_10215198E80D4BC0">thought of them. And &s;uppo&s;e I had been treating them, and they, by chance, had fallen a&s;leep, I could not, with pro|priety, relate the &s;tory as a fact; becau&s;e, to hold good, it mu&s;t be often repeated.</P>
<P>I never re&s;t my judgement upon a &s;ingle experiment. In experimental philo&s;ophy facts are &s;tubborn, and no one can contradict them when repeated.</P>

Perhaps the patient will tell you, if you cannot find it. If it is a <HI>Hemicrania,</HI> which is owing to the foulne&s;s of the &s;to|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ach, you fix your eyes upon your left hand, which you di|rect towards the &s;tomach with your right hand, and do the &s;ame as if you were to turn a pancacke. This you repeat &s;e|veral times; which &s;tirs the atmo&s;phere, relaxes the &s;tomach, and makes him vomit. You may give a little warm water to promote your operation. You may al&s;o treat the head, by drawing the fluid downwards. If the pain has been of long &s;tanding, you may order a vomit, or a gentle purge; treat him every day; and afterward order bitters to &s;trengthen the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>There are different headachs; as, the <HI>Cephalagia,</HI> when the head is affected &s;lightly in one part. <HI>Cephaloea</HI> is when the whole head is affected: One &s;ide only is called, <HI>Hemicrania;</HI> and a &s;mall &s;pot affected is called, <HI>Clavis Hi&s;tericus.</HI></P>

<P>Treating the part which you think affected is very nece&s;&s;ary. You do this with one hand or both, by drawing your hands towards you &s;everal times, as before.

There is no doubt but we are en|dowed with an internal &s;en&s;e, which is in affinity with the Univer&s;e, and is con&s;idered as an exten&s;ion of &s;ight.

<HEAD>Of the Cri&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Cri&s;es</HI> are an effort of Nature again&s;t the di&s;order, endeavouring to di&s;&s;ipate the ob&s;tacles which are in the circulation, and to re&s;tore harmony or equilibrium to all parts of the body. Few di&s;ea&s;es can be cured without a <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> par|ticularly when they proceed from ob&s;tructions, &amp;c.</P>
<P>There are two &s;orts of <HI>Cri&s;es.</HI> The <HI>natural,</HI> which is at|tributed to Nature alone, gets rid of what offends her, by an increa&s;e of movement, producing <HI>vomitting, motion, per&s;pira|tion,</HI> &amp;c. The&s;e are the mo&s;t &s;alutary, as Nature acts &s;ilent|ly, without violence, and expels the ob&s;tacles which impede circulation; by moving gently the <HI>molecules</HI> which form tho&s;e impediments, and go off by per&s;piration, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>forced,</HI> is &s;ometimes &s;alutary in <HI>ob&s;tructions, windy,</HI> and <HI>bilious complaints.</HI> The&s;e are produced, when Nature is in&s;uf|ficient to expel what offends her. The u&s;e of Animal Elec|tricity and Magneti&s;m puts the whole body in action, and, in conjunction with her, acts efficiou&s;ly on the patient, who receives benefit and ea&s;e; particularly if it has produced eva|cuations, &amp;c. There are various means of producing them, according to the &s;ubject, and the cau&s;e of his di&s;ea&s;e. Some &s;ay there are &s;ix degrees of <HI>Cri&s;es.</HI> I &s;ay there are as many, as there are different con&s;titutions to treat. Some, will al&s;o call it <HI>luminous Cri&s;is,</HI> from that new &s;ect called the <HI>Illuminated.</HI> All the&s;e are imaginary.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e you have a patient on whom you would wi&s;h to produce a gentle <HI>Cri&s;is;</HI> you mu&s;t put your&s;elf in affinity; then put one hand behind the head, and the other before, till the per&s;on is a&s;leep. If he be agitated, calm him, by drawing the fluid downwards from the head. If you treat the cau&s;e by touching, it will increa&s;e the pain. If you put your thumb upon the <HI>frontal &s;inus,</HI> he will fall into a <HI>Cri&s;is.</HI> You may magneti&s;e your watch, and &s;how him the time of day, he will go into it. Magneti&s;e a flower, and give him a &s;mell, he will fall in. Magneti&s;e a harp&s;icord, as &s;oon as you play on it he will go in. Magneti&s;e a per&s;on between you and the patient, which will put him in. Magneti&s;e a pond, make the patient &s;tand on the &s;ide oppo&s;ite to you, and hold a &s;tick in his hand to touch the water; you mu&s;t al&s;o touch the water with your magneti&s;ed conductor: the per&s;on will go into a <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> immediately. Have &s;omebody behind him, to
<PB N="52" REF="046381_0051_102151BC027FFFD8">prevent his falling into the water: it is the be&s;t conductor of animal fluid. Make a per&s;on read, be behind him, and magneti&s;e the lines as he reads, he will go in. Place the pa|tient behind you, oppo&s;ite a lookinggla&s;s, that you may &s;ee him, and magneti&s;e, with a conductor, the figure in the gla&s;s. The reaction of the fluid will produce a <HI>Cri&s;is.</HI> Magneti&s;e a tree in a walk, as &s;oon as the patient comes near it, he will fall into a <HI>Cri&s;is.</HI> A per&s;on may be put in a <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> through a door, from one room to another; and in fact, an ingenious ob&s;erver may, by what I have related, make a great many curious expe|riments; provided he has <HI>proper &s;ubjects.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of Somnambuli&s;m.</HEAD>
<P>IN my little e&s;&s;ay on <HI>Somnambuli&s;m,</HI> I have &s;aid, that it was a &s;tate between &s;leeping and waking, partaking of both. The patient is a <HI>Somnambule,</HI> when he can do the &s;ame as if he were awake. The&s;e natural <HI>Somnambules,</HI> who get up at night, and do many wonderful things, are well demon&s;trated. They are di&s;ea&s;es, and may be cured by treating. The <HI>magnetic Som|nambules,</HI> are tho&s;e, whom art has found out a mean of ob&s;or|bing or &s;u&s;pending &s;ome of the external &s;en&s;es of for a while; and the patient eats, and drinks; goes up and down; plays upon the harp&s;icord; and does many things which you de&s;ire him; provided he be willing. The fir&s;t I &s;aw was at the Mar|quis de <HI>Puy&s;egur</HI>'s, in the year 1784: and all tho&s;e who pre|tended to it, in this country before, were impo&s;tors, and none of them had yet dreamt of it; and for all this, we are indebt|ed to Dr. <HI>Me&s;mer.</HI> Whenever any per&s;on has a real <HI>Somnambule,</HI> which is very ea&s;y, by care he has a trea&s;ure. They are call|ed by us, <HI>Malades Medecins;</HI> or &s;ick Phy&s;icians. The&s;e beings &s;ee in the dark, and go through an external atmo&s;phere, the &s;ame as a glow worm. They have, be&s;ides, an internal atmo&s;|phere, which they make u&s;e of to perceive objects pre&s;ent, di&s;|tant, vi&s;ible, and invi&s;ible. I have had &s;everal who related to me, what they could perceive. All of them differ, in ma|ny re&s;pects, according to their con&s;titutions. One mu&s;t not always depend upon what they &s;ay, on account of their differ|ing &s;ometimes. You may make them move in any direction, <HI>by your will</HI> alone; or by moving your conductor any way up|on the floor, they will follow its directions. You may make them play on any in&s;trument they can; they will read, write,
<PB N="53" REF="046381_0052_102151BE194EA340">and work: all the&s;e they will do better than if awake. Being deprived of their other faculties, they become &s;tronger. No phy&s;ician can tell the di&s;ea&s;e of a per&s;on better than a real <HI>Som|nambule.</HI> They &s;eldom fail to tell unknown per&s;ons their di&s;|ea&s;es, and pre&s;cribe for them.</P>
<P>At a future time, when the Science is better e&s;tabli&s;hed, I &s;hall publi&s;h a full account of the theory of <HI>Somnambuli&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>Some will accu&s;e me of having &s;aid too much; but tho&s;e who know me per&s;onally, will never accu&s;e me of relating any thing which I cannot demon&s;trate; and tho&s;e who repeat the&s;e mar|vellous narrations, hurt them&s;elves and the &s;cience, in the eyes of really learned men. Tho&s;e &s;tories, like traditions, which are handed down from generation to generation, and become improbable; like antiquity, lo&s;e their former lu&s;tre.

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>To make an electric, or magnetical Apparatus.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL not give you a full account of the <HI>Apparatus</HI> of our &s;ociety in <HI>Paris.</HI> It is more like a grove. Mine, which I had in <HI>London,</HI> and <HI>Dublin,</HI> is a large oak tub, eight feet in diameter, well pitched in the in&s;ide, about an inch thick, (that belonging to our &s;ociety, has lookinggla&s;&s;es all round it), in|&s;ulated upon four gla&s;s feet, bottles of water well corked; you magneti&s;e the bottles, and lay them down, the neck of one in the bottom of the other all round; &s;o that the la&s;t comes to the centre. You may fill up the &s;pace with broken bottles, or vi|trifiable matter, brim&s;tone, or re&s;inous matter, minerals, &amp;c. Fill it up all but &s;ix inches; put &s;ome load&s;tones and artificial magnets in different directions; then cover the whole, to the edge, with fine, dry, river &s;and&mdash;put the lead over; place in the middle a poli&s;hed iron bar about eight feet high, with &s;prigs to it, to attract the univer&s;al fluid which concentres it&s;elf in the re&s;ervoir. At the far corner place an <HI>Arbor Vitoe</HI> in a box; and place under it a &s;trong magnet; the north pole upwards; the &s;outh pole is fixed in a hole upon the cover; by that mean you increa&s;e the motion of the tree, and, becoming vegetali&s;ed, it will grow without water. You make holes all round about, eighteen inches di&s;tant, put iron or bra&s;s conductors behind, &s;o as to touch the patients who come next to it. Connect a chain of an electric machine; in&s;ulate your patients, and make them hold hands; it will increa&s;e the action in them. You may treat
<PB N="54" REF="046381_0053_102151C367528740">them in that manner; you will the &s;ooner put them into <HI>Cri&s;es&punc;</HI> I have had all my patients, round my re&s;ervoir, in a <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> at a time. I could not attend them. You may have a tree in a box, upon in&s;ulated feet; have a &s;mall box, filled with vitri&s;i|able matter, and fill it with water; you may make u&s;e of a large bottle, filled with water only, and connect a chain to it. All this apparatus may be made differently, according to your idea.</P>
<P>To magneti&s;e a tree, you mu&s;t &s;tand facing the north; you mu&s;t have a conductor, which you have magneti&s;ed. You mu&s;t point it from the top of the highe&s;t branches to the roots; do the &s;ame from the other branches. If the tree is &s;o large that you cannot &s;ee the branches on the other &s;ide, change your po|&s;ition, from &s;outh to north, and do the &s;ame. Then approach the tree, cla&s;p your hands round it, and &s;tay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that po&s;ition five minutes: your tree becomes magneti&s;ed. Any patient, who has been in a <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> or <HI>Somnambuli&s;m,</HI> will di&s;tingui&s;h it. Some will go into a <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> as &s;oon as they come near it; others, if they are in <HI>Somnambuli&s;m,</HI> will di&s;cover it among the re&s;t.</P>
<P>You may magneti&s;e a myrtle, or any other &s;hrub: it will appear luminous in the dark. You may magneti&s;e a flower, by putting your thumbs in the middle, and e&s;tabli&s;hing an equa|tor; then, drawing your thumbs to the extremities, you pre&s;s your thumb with the next finger, and you throw the fluid upon the flower. It will appear luminous in the dark. By giving it to a per&s;on to &s;mell, who has been in a <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> before, he will go into one again.</P>
<P>To magneti&s;e a conductor or a cane, put your hands in the middle of it; &s;lide your hands to the extremities; your thumbs at the top, and rub the extremities with them. By the&s;e means you will impregnate it with an electrical fluid, that &s;eems lu|minous in the dark, and as &s;ulphurous as the electric rubbing.</P>
<P>To magneti&s;e a &s;hilling, or a guinea, put your thumbs in the middle, and draw them to the extremities: it will appear as a ball of fire. A watch is magneti&s;ed in the &s;ame manner, by drawing your two thumbs at the top, and your index under it. E&s;tabli&s;h an equator, and draw your fingers to the two poles. By &s;hewing it to a per&s;on who has already been in a <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> he will fall into one again. They can tell you what o'clock it is in the dark. If a&s;leep, they can tell you the &s;ame, by &s;hewing a watch.</P>
<P>To magneti&s;e a harp&s;icord, fix your hands &s;pread on the middle, and draw them towards the extremities: then rub the
<PB N="55" REF="046381_0054_102151C5C437BE10">end you touch the &s;trings with, one after another, in the &s;ame manner. By that mean you will impregnate it with an electric fluid. As &s;oon as a per&s;on plays upon the harp&s;icord, make your patient touch it with his hand or finger: he will fall into a <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> immediately.</P>
<P>To magneti&s;e a room, or a bed is the &s;ame. Set it to the north, facing the &s;outh; point your conductor up to the ceiling; bring it down towards you. Point it to the we&s;t and ea&s;t, and bring it al&s;o to your feet: the room will appear all luminons, and the bed al&s;o.</P>
<P>A pond may be magneti&s;ed in the &s;ame manner. By point|ing your conductor over the &s;urface of the water, from the car|dinal points. Touch the water with it, and make your pati|ent do the &s;ame. He will have a &s;hock in falling in, and it may be of &s;ervice to him.</P>
<P>From the&s;e few experiments it is ea&s;y to conceive, that any inanimate body may be electrified, or magneti&s;ed, which you plea&s;e to call it. I have lately received information from <HI>Lon|don</HI> and <HI>Paris,</HI> that a per&s;on may kill a dog, a hor&s;e, or a man; by fixing his eyes upon the heart, it will &s;top the circu|lation, and kill them in an in&s;tant. My corre&s;pondant, who has as little &s;aith as my&s;elf in the&s;e &s;tories, informs me, "That in a bu&s;tle in the place Louis XV. an hu&s;&s;ar came full gallop towards him, &s;word in hand: he treated the man and hor&s;e, but could not &s;top him. Having his gun loaded, he killed the man, and thru&s;t the bayonet into the brea&s;t of the hor&s;e. He treated them both effectually." Others pretend to &s;ink a &s;hip at &s;ea. This would be a good thing for an admiral! All tho&s;e pretended experiments do no honour to tho&s;e who relate them.</P>
<P>To treat one's &s;elf is as ea&s;y as to make our arms, feet, and other parts of the body, move in any direction we plea&s;e. You may make your&s;elf &s;ick in your &s;tomach by your <HI>ab&s;olute will,</HI> as well as to cau&s;e motion, per&s;piration, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now take leave of my pupils, and beg of them never to relate any thing but what they have repeated often; and hope, they will excu&s;e my Engli&s;h, as I have not employed any clerks.</P>
