<HEAD>Brotherly Love inculcated.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>1 JOHN iii. 18.</HI></BIBL>
<P>&mdash;Let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BROTHERLY LOVE is &s;o agreeable to the uncorrupted principles of our nature, and &s;o plainly nece&s;&s;ary and conducive to the well-being and happine&s;s of human &s;ociety, that per&s;ons of all per&s;ua&s;ions will, in general, acknowledge it to be a virtue of peculiar excellency, which none ought to neglect. And while they thus allow its im|portance, there are but few but what pretend to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it. But notwith&s;tand|ing men &s;o generally agree in commending and laying claim to this virtue, there are, it is probable, many who have but a very
<PB N="6" REF="016307_0004_0F9C1EE6D3C44D80">imperfect idea of it. Some there are who &s;eem to think that it con&s;i&s;ts only in good words and good wi&s;hes, or in de&s;iring the welfare of others; altho' they do nothing to promote it any further than mere words will go. They are full of kind expre&s;&s;ions; and <HI>there</HI> their charity begins and ends.</P>
<P>This is the error which the Apo&s;tle cau|tions us again&s;t in the text; "Let us not love in word, neither in tongue." He does not mean that it is improper to u&s;e kind words, or to make profe&s;&s;ions of love and good-will; but that we &s;hould not content our&s;elves with the&s;e only, or imagine that benevolence requires nothing more of us. Such language is agreeable and plea&s;ant, and u&s;ing it is one way of &s;hewing kindne&s;s, tho' it by no means proves a real principle of love in the heart, and in many ca&s;es can be of no &s;ub&s;tantial &s;ervice to the per&s;on to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed. For, in the language of the Apo&s;tle James, "If a brother or &s;i&s;ter be naked and de&s;titute of daily food; and one of you &s;ay unto him, depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled: notwith&s;tanding ye give them not tho&s;e things which are needful for the body; what doth it profit?" Is this true charity? Does this amount to loving our neighours as our&s;elves? By no means. People do but
<PB N="7" REF="016307_0005_0F9C1EE78FE8E810">deceive them&s;elves, if they imagine they have either chri&s;tian faith, or chri&s;tian charity, unle&s;s they &s;hew it by good works: But more e&s;pecially, if they &s;cruple not to defraud, to defame and otherwi&s;e to injure their neigh|bours, with &s;uch good words as brotherly-love and charity in their mouths. In&s;tead of contenting our&s;elves with this merely verbal charity, the Apo&s;tle exhorts us to love in deed and in truth; i. e. to cultivate a princi|ple of love and benevolence in our hearts, that we may with truth and &s;incerity make profe&s;&s;ions of it; and be ever ready to mani|fe&s;t it by deeds of charity.</P>
<P>This duty of brotherly-love is a very exten|&s;ive one: It virtually compri&s;es all the duties of the &s;econd table, all moral and &s;ocial vir|tues, as they are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the duties that immediately relate to God as their object: Accordingly, the Apo&s;tle Paul &s;ays, "he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law." Nor is it improbable that many who make pre|ten&s;ions to this virtue are under other mi&s;takes about it, be&s;ides that cautioned again&s;t in the text. It may therefore be u&s;eful to us all, and conducive to one profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of that ancient in&s;titution which gave occa&s;ion to this &s;olemnity, to &s;pend a little time in explaining that charity or brotherly-love recommended in the text.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="016307_0006_0F9C1EE84DBE18D0">
It is to be con&s;idered both in its principle, and in its effects or operations as it is called forth into exerci&s;e on various occa&s;ions, and in different circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>It primarily intends &s;incere good-will or unfeigned benevolence; heartily wi&s;hing well to others, and de&s;iring both their temporal and eternal good. Seeing, &s;ays the Apo&s;tle Peter, in his fir&s;t epi&s;tle, 1 chap. "Seeing ye have puri&s;ied your &s;ouls in obeying the truth unto unfeigned love of the brethren; &s;ee that ye love one another with a pure heart fer|vently."&mdash;This is the general idea of chri&s;tian charity, or brotherly-love.</P>
<P>But it will be proper to be more particular in explaining the nature of this virtue, by pointing out &s;ome of the principal properties of it and &s;hewing what is contrary thereto. Love is an active principle in the &s;oul: Wherever it is, it has a mighty influence upon the mind and behaviour; producing effects corre&s;pondent to its nature&punc; and re&s;training the &s;ubjects of it from every thing contrary thereto: And it is to be made manife&s;t both to our&s;elves and others by its fruits, and not by an empty profe&s;&s;ion. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. It is a property of brotherly-love to rejoice in the goodne&s;s of God
<PB N="9" REF="016307_0007_0F9C1EE911E0A518">to others; and to delight in their happine&s;s. We are enjoined to "rejoice with them that do rejoice," in te&s;timony of the good-will which we bear to them. And if we &s;incerely love others we are of cour&s;e plea&s;ed when we &s;ee them happy and pro&s;perous; e&s;pecially when we &s;ee them wi&s;e, good and virtuous; and &s;o in a fair way to obtain eternal &s;alvation. "Charity rejoiceth not in iniquity, but re|joiceth in the truth." And the apo&s;tle John, declares that he "had no greater joy than to &s;ee others walking in the truth."</P>
<P>From hence it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, how contrary an envious temper and repining at the welfare of others is to brotherly-love. Accordingly one part of the Apo&s;tle's de&s;cription of this virtue is this, "charity envieth not." If then we would be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this amiable virtue we mu&s;t avoid all envy at tho&s;e who are wi&s;er, richer, more virtuous, more e&s;teemed, more pro&s;perous, than our&s;elves. Living in malice, and living in envy are akin to each other, and joined together in &s;cripture, as being both oppo&s;ite in their nature to brotherly-love or chri&s;tian charity.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another property of brotherly-love is to &s;ympathi&s;e with others in their troubles and afflictions; bearing a part in their &s;or|rows, and being &s;incerely grieved for them
<PB N="10" REF="016307_0008_0F9C1EEA48B08490">when they are in adver&s;ity. Accordingly we are exhorted in &s;cripture to "weep with them that weep," as well as to rejoice with them that do rejoice. Every one knows by ex|perience that whenever he &s;incerely loves another, as for example, a child, a brother, or a friend nearer than a brother; he is of cour&s;e grieved and afflicted for them when they are in trouble. So the truly charitable man can|not &s;ee any others in &s;orrow and di&s;tre&s;s with an eye of indifference; but will as it were feel for them, and &s;hare in their &s;orrows; according to the exhortation of the Apo&s;tle &mdash;"Bear ye one another's burdens, and &s;o fulfil the law of Chri&s;t;" that is, the law of love, which is emphatically the law of Chri&s;t, who &s;aid, "Hereby &s;hall all men know that ye are my di&s;ciples, if ye have love one for another." If we can &s;ee our brethren or neighbours in &s;orrow and difficulty, without any pity or compa&s;&s;ion, without a tender &s;ympathy with them, we do not certainly love them in &s;ince|rity and truth; e&s;pecially if we are rather plea&s;ed than grieved when we &s;ee them labor|ing under adver&s;ity.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is the property of this virtue to mourn for the errors and vices of others, by which their future happine&s;s is endangered, as well as for their worldly &s;orrows and afflictions.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="016307_0009_0F9C1EEAB5817AB0">
Whoever is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of true benevolence, de&s;ires the eternal happine&s;s of all men; and therefore cannot but be grieved when he &s;ees any walking in the ways of &s;in and folly which lead to mi&s;ery and de&s;truction.</P>
<P>From this property of brotherly-love we &s;ee that it is incon&s;i&s;tent therewith to be de|&s;ignedly or willingly in&s;trumental in leading others into wickedne&s;s; to tempt and intice them to intemperance, uncleanne&s;s, profane|ne&s;s, unlawful gaming, or any kind of vicious extravagance; or even to &s;et them an exam|ple of &s;uch wickedne&s;s: Whoever does thus is &s;o far from imitating the father of mercies in benevolence, as we are exhorted to do, that he rather re&s;embles the grand adver&s;ary of God and man, "who, as a roaring lion, walketh about &s;eeking whom he may devour."</P>
<P N="4">4. Brotherly-love, or true benevolence, im|plies doing good to all as we have opportu|nity; relieving their wants, comforting them in trouble, and doing what in us lies to pro|mote their welfare. Love is a generous boun|tiful principle; it exerts it&s;elf in &s;ub&s;tantial acts of kindne&s;s, as occa&s;ion and opportunity are pre&s;ented. He that loves in deed and in truth "does good to all men, as he hath op|portunity;" according the Apo&s;tle's exhorta|tion;
<PB N="12" REF="016307_0010_0F9C1EF49BC17BE8">who &s;ays al&s;o, "to do good and to com|municate forget not; for with &s;uch &s;acrifices God is well plea&s;ed." We are indeed directed by the Apo&s;tle to do good, "e&s;pecially unto them who are of the hou&s;hold of faith." The rea&s;on of this direction is, that we, as chri&s;tians, are more nearly connected with them; they belong, as it were, to the &s;ame family and are our brethren in a more appro|priate &s;en&s;e, than mankind in general; and becau&s;e they are al&s;o &s;uppo&s;ed to be more worthy characters, better and more u&s;eful members of &s;ociety than others. And tho' chri&s;tianity has on this account been charged with recommending a contracted &s;pirit: Yet, if I mi&s;take not, the other in&s;titution above referred to, in like manner recommends to its profe&s;&s;ors the members of their own &s;o|ciety as the fir&s;t objects of their liberality and beneficence. Nor do I apprehend that any rea&s;onable objection can be brought again&s;t this direction. One end of all &s;ocial connec|tions is to promote mutual affection among tho&s;e who form them: They have plainly a tendency to do this. Members of the &s;ame &s;ociety mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be better acquaint|ed with the wants and nece&s;&s;ities of one ano|ther, than with tho&s;e of other men; and to be more concerned for their good. By en|tering into a particular connection with others
<PB N="13" REF="016307_0011_0F9C1EF5F784E018">we take upon our&s;elves a new obligation to love and do good to them, in addition to that which we are naturally under to men in gene|ral, con&s;idered only as human creatures. We ought not indeed to confine our good-will and good offices to our brethren by profe&s;|&s;ion; nor does chri&s;tianity or the other in&s;ti|tution above mentioned require us to do &s;o; but only to give them the preference. Both the&s;e in&s;titutions leave the natural obligations to univer&s;al charity in their full force; and induce &s;ome new ones with re&s;pect to tho&s;e of our own particular fraternity. Our neare&s;t connections are naturally the fir&s;t objects of our benevolence; from them it extends to others more remote.</P>
<Q><L>"Friend, parent, neighbour fir&s;t it will embrace,</L>
<L>"Our country next, and next all human race."</L></Q>
<P>According to our ability we are to do good to all men, &s;o far as we can con&s;i&s;tently with our obligations to tho&s;e to whom we are un|der particular engagements; not only to enter|tain &s;trangers and afford relief and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the poor and tho&s;e who are in &s;orrow and di&s;tre&s;s; but to do all we can to promote both the temporal and eternal happine&s;s of mankind. And therefore this excellent vir|tue will naturally lead a man to lend his a&s;&s;i&s;tance for the &s;upport of religion and vir|tue,
<PB N="14" REF="016307_0012_0F9C1EF6AF718DB8">of good order and government; for op|po&s;ing the encroachments of tyranny and arbitrary power, for the encouragement of arts and &s;ciences, of u&s;eful manufactures, of com|merce, of agriculture, and of every thing which tends to the real good of mankind. And he who has it in his power to be u&s;eful in this way and neglects it, mu&s;t be deficient in that brotherly love and charity which the go&s;pel recommends.</P>
<P N="5">5. Loving in deed and in truth implies for|bearance and candor towards tho&s;e who may differ from us in opinion in &s;ome re&s;pects, in&s;tead of ra&s;hly judging, condemning, per&s;ecuting or reviling them. "Judge not, that ye be not judged," &s;ays our Saviour, "condemn not, and ye &s;hall not be condemned." It is indeed al|lowable for us to &s;peak of known errors in opi|nion or practice, as &s;uch, as contrary to the truth and go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; yea, Chri&s;tians are commanded to contend earne&s;tly for the faith once delivered to the &s;aints. But then it is in love that we ought to &s;peak the truth, to oppo&s;e error and to contend for the faith; not with wrath and bitterne&s;s, as is too com|monly done by different &s;ects and parties. We ought to remember that we our&s;elves are fallible and liable to err, as well as tho&s;e that differ from us; that we have no more right
<PB N="15" REF="016307_0013_0F9C1EF7585A5C18">to lord it over their faith and con&s;ciences, than they have over ours; nor, con&s;equently, have we any right to harm them, merely for their religious opinions, though they are erroneous.</P>
<P>The go&s;pel is a plan of liberty, allowing, and even requiring all men to exerci&s;e their own judgment and con&s;ciences; and forbid|ding them to u&s;urp authority over one ano|ther, or uncharitably to cen&s;ure each other. The holy &s;criptures abound with precepts to this purpo&s;e; and an habitual regard to them is required in the exhortation in the text.</P>
<P N="6">6. This virtue implies a pacific di&s;po&s;ition; and endeavouring, as much as in us lies, to live peaceably with all men; more e&s;pecially with our chri&s;tian brethen; and therefore re|quires humility and mutual conde&s;cention, without which there can be no peace, no dwelling together in unity; but uncharitable contentions and fatal divi&s;ions mu&s;t needs take place. "I therefore the pri&s;oner of the Lord," &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, Eph. iv, "be&s;eech you, that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called; with all lowline&s;s and meek|ne&s;s; with long&s;uffering; forbearing one ano|ther in love, endeavouring to keep the unity of the &s;pirit in the bond of peace."</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="016307_0014_0F9C1EF81377FE58">
Whoever loves his brethren in deed and in truth, will be de&s;irous to maintain peace and unity; even though in &s;ome ca&s;es he &s;hould be obliged for that end to give up his own ju&s;t right. This mu&s;t however be confined to things indifferent in their own nature; for we are not in any ca&s;e to do evil, or &s;in again&s;t God for the &s;ake of peace: Nor are we oblig|ed, for this cau&s;e, to give up our temporal rights when they are con&s;iderable, or wil|lingly to become &s;laves to encroaching and ambitious men. But whatever can be done con&s;i&s;tently with a good con&s;cience, and the pre&s;ervation of our own valuable rights, brotherly-love obliges us to do, rather than contend.</P>
<P N="7">7. This virtue implies a forgiving temper of mind, and a di&s;po&s;ition to overlook injuries. Forgiving others their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es is a material branch of that charity which the go&s;pel re|quires. "Put on therefore," &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, "as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindne&s;s, meekne&s;s, long|&s;uffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel again&s;t any; even as Chri&s;t forgave you, &s;o al&s;o do ye." (Col. iii. 12.) And it ought to be re|membered what great &s;tre&s;s our ble&s;&s;ed Lord him&s;elf puts upon this, &s;aying,&mdash;"If ye forgive
<PB N="17" REF="016307_0015_0F9C1EF8D0583058">men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, your heavenly Father will al&s;o forgive your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es: But if ye forgive not men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, neither will your Father forgive you."</P>
<P>And if this be the ca&s;e, we &s;ee that it is plainly incon&s;i&s;tent with brotherly love, to indulge an implacable &s;pirit and a de&s;ire of revenge;&mdash;it is &s;o let the injury be ever &s;o great; but it is more inexcu&s;able when the injury is too trifling to de&s;erve the re&s;entment of a wi&s;e man; being only an idle word, or unguarded expre&s;&s;ion, utterred perhaps in a pa&s;&s;ion. A man who for &s;uch trifling offences in&s;i&s;ts upon being revenged, even though it &s;hould be by taking the life of the offender, has a &s;pirit as contrary to that of love, as light is to darkne&s;s; even tho' he &s;hould in con|tempt of common &s;en&s;e and good breeding, and in defiance of the feelings of humanity and the laws of God, be ab&s;urd enough to call this <HI>genteel &s;atisfaction.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. And la&s;tly; it is to be ob&s;erved, that he who loves in deed and in truth, will be careful to ab&s;tain from every kind of injury towards his neighbour, and to practice all tho&s;e &s;ocial and relative duties which are nece&s;&s;ary for the good order, peace and happine&s;s of &s;ociety, All the&s;e duties have their foundation in love as their principle; and they naturally flow
<PB N="18" REF="016307_0016_0F9C1EF98D6BFD48">from it, as &s;treams from their fountain. Nor can a per&s;on break any of God's command|ments, relative to &s;ocial life, without violating the great law of chri&s;tian charity at the &s;ame time. The Apo&s;tle Paul him&s;elf explains the chri&s;tian law of love in this latitude; repre|&s;enting it as incon&s;i&s;tent with every kind and degree of fraud and inju&s;tice, and including in it every &s;ocial virtue&mdash;our whole duty to|wards our neighbour. For thus he &s;peaks Rom. xiii. "Owe no man any thing but to love one another; for he that loveth another, hath fulfilled the law. For this, thou &s;halt not commit adultery; thou &s;halt not kill; thou &s;halt not &s;teal; thou &s;halt not bear fal&s;e witne&s;s; thou &s;halt not covet: And if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this &s;aying, namely, thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: Therefore love is the fulfilling of the Law."</P>
<P>Having thus explained the great and im|portant duty recommended in the text, I &s;hall a&s;k your patience no longer, than while I briefly apply the &s;ubject. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us ever bare upon our minds the great extent, the comprehen&s;ive nature of the law of love;&mdash;that it requires not merely good words and kind wi&s;hes, or even giving
<PB N="19" REF="016307_0017_0F9C1EFA5183D360">alms; but the practice of all moral and &s;ocial virtues, and the ab&s;taining from all vice; and that if we allow our&s;elves to lead di&s;&s;olute immoral lives, we in vain pretend to be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of brotherly-love.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us con&s;ider the many obligations we are all under to the duty we have been con|&s;idering;&mdash;from the relation we bare to all men, as our brethren, they in common with us, being all the offspring of the &s;ame great Father of our &s;pirits; from the example of univer&s;al love and beneficence which this great Parent has &s;et us;&mdash;from our weakne&s;s and in&s;ufficiency to our own happine&s;s, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> they &s;tand in of help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance from one another;&mdash;from the &s;ocial nature of man, his love of &s;ociety, and di&s;|po&s;ition to be plea&s;ed with the exerci&s;es of benevolence, whether he feels them in him&s;elf or &s;ees the effects of them in others: And as chri&s;tians, we are obliged to this duty, by the repeated and expre&s;s commands of the go&s;pel, and the example of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, our Lord and Ma&s;ter, who gave the mo&s;t convinc|ing evidences of &s;incere affection to us, and has commanded us to love one another as he has loved us; and by our de&s;ires and hopes of eternal happine&s;s in heaven, which cannot be obtained or enjoyed without a benevolent
<PB N="20" REF="016307_0018_0F9C1EFB12C488F0">temper.&mdash;And let me add, that the brethren of the ancient Society of Free and Accepted Ma&s;ons, are under an additional obligation to this duty. They have voluntarily bound them&s;elves to ob&s;erve the laws and orders of an in&s;titution, one de&s;ign of which is to promote brotherly-love, and which allows of nothing contrary thereto; of no immoral, no injurious practice. For, this, I am fully &s;atisfied, may be truly &s;aid of their in&s;titution; that it was in part de&s;igned to make men bene|volent kind and virtuous; and that the more clo&s;ely a brother conforms to the rules of his profe&s;&s;ion, the more happy he will be in him|&s;elf, and the more u&s;eful to others. It may however and no doubt often does, fail of ef|fecting its de&s;ign; as is the ca&s;e of chri&s;tianity, though planed by the wi&s;dom of God him&s;elf. But it would be highly unrea&s;onable to make either of the&s;e in&s;titutions an&s;werable for the ill conduct of their profe&s;&s;ors. Shame be to all unworthy, to all immoral brethren. But let not a blamele&s;s, a benevolent and a wi&s;e in&s;titution be repreached for their &s;akes.</P>
<P>A vicious and uncharitable Ma&s;on is pe|cularly inexcu&s;able. He is bound to be other|wi&s;e by the laws of nature, of revelation and of ma&s;onry: And yet &s;o great is his corrup|tion, &s;o &s;trong his propen&s;ity to wickedne&s;s,
<PB N="21" REF="016307_0019_0F9C1EFBD47993C0">that he breaks a&s;under this three fold cord to the di&s;grace of his profe&s;&s;ion, and even of his humanity. Let then, the gentlemen of this fraternity be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider, how &s;trongly they are obliged to the practice of charity and all virtue. Your in&s;titution, you know, has been faulted by &s;ome, unacquainted with its principles, as having a bad tendency, and by others as trifling and u&s;ele&s;s. But it is not all the reproaches of its enemies that can &s;o much di&s;honor it, as the vicious lives of its profe&s;&s;ors. Take care then to confute all &s;uch in&s;inuations by &s;hewing that it has a good influence upon your tempers and lives. Demean your&s;elves according to the good rules and orders of your &s;ociety. Let there be found among you no in&s;tance of impiety, of profanene&s;s, of intemperance, of impurity, of di&s;hone&s;ty, of covetou&s;ne&s;s, of contention, or of any other vice: But &s;trive to excel in all the virtues of a good life. This will ren|der the badges of your profe&s;&s;ion honorable; will gain re&s;pect to your in&s;titution from tho&s;e who do not profe&s;s it; will make you happy in your&s;elves, and increa&s;e the happine&s;s and dimini&s;h the &s;orrows of your family and do|me&s;tic connections, and cau&s;e tho&s;e who are not intru&s;ted with your &s;ecrets to ble&s;s your in&s;titution; it will make you good hu&s;bands, good fathers, good friends, and good mem|bers
<PB N="22" REF="016307_0020_0F9C1EFC9A3993C8">of &s;ociety; you will be workers together with God in promoting the happine&s;s of man|kind; and in that day, when all <HI>&s;ecrets</HI> &s;hall be di&s;clo&s;ed, you will be approved by your Judge, and admitted <HI>free</HI> of the city that is above, who&s;e builder and maker is God.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not forget the collection for the poor, which was propo&s;ed to be part of the bu|&s;ine&s;s of this a&s;&s;embly. This benevolent pro|po&s;al coming from a &s;ociety of free Ma&s;ons, &s;hews that tho' their charity regards in the fir&s;t place their own members, yet it is not confined to them, but extends to all who need relief. In this good work they invite all who are able to join them.&mdash;Give me leave to &s;econd the invitation.&mdash;Though giving alms is not the whole, it is yet an e&s;&s;ential part of charity, where there is occa&s;ion and ability for it. That there is at pre&s;ent great occa&s;ion for it among us mu&s;t be known to mo&s;t of you. Be&s;ides &s;uch poor as we always have with us, there are many per&s;ons now in this town re|duced, by the con&s;equences that have re&s;ulted from the war, from comfortable circum&s;tances, to &s;uch poverty as to be unable to procure the real nece&s;&s;aries of life: This is &s;aid to be the ca&s;e with the families of &s;ome of tho&s;e who are now in the public &s;ervice, or have died fighting in defence of their country, for
<PB N="23" REF="016307_0021_0F9C1F0130B97ED8">a very inadequate reward. And at the &s;ame time that the war has been thus unfavorable to &s;ome, it has given opportunity to others to acquire great wealth. Suppo&s;e then that you were thus reduced, &s;o as not to have where|withal to purcha&s;e bread and fuel to keep your&s;elf and your family from &s;uffering. Would not you think that tho&s;e around you who had enough and to &s;pare ought to a&s;&s;i&s;t you: And if in&s;tead of doing it, they &s;hould &s;pend in &s;umptuous living, in expen&s;ive equi|page, furniture, &s;ervants, needle&s;s diver&s;ions, and idle amu&s;ements, enough to &s;upport many &s;uch families as yours, would you think that they did right? Or that they had any regard for the laws of chri&s;tianity, of ma&s;onry, or even of humanity? Or &s;uppo&s;e in&s;tead of being thus poor and neglected, you were one of tho&s;e who have, in this day of general cala|mity, found means greatly to encrea&s;e your riches, and &s;hould thus neglect a poor bro|ther or neighbour, though you every day &s;pent in needle&s;s &s;how and luxury enough to &s;upport a poor family with frugality; would not your con&s;cience accu&s;e you of a very criminal neglect of duty, if you &s;hould reflect but a moment upon the matter? Would not your own heart condemn you? Could you think that you acted as became a chri&s;tian, a free Ma&s;on, or even a man? And would it not chil your &s;pirits in your gaye&s;t amu&s;e|ments
<PB N="24" REF="016307_0022_0F9C1F026A964090">to think, that there were many among us &s;uffering for want of nece&s;&s;aries, which they could procure with what you needle&s;sly &s;pend? Suppo&s;e farther; that in&s;tead of thus &s;huting up your bowels of compa&s;&s;ion, you &s;hould retrench &s;ome of your unnece&s;&s;ary expences, and give what you thus &s;aved to &s;ome poor worthy family, to di&s;pel the melancholy of an affectionate father, to revive the &s;pirits of an anxious di&s;tre&s;&s;ed mother, to &s;pread a &s;mile over the meagre, dejected countenances of half-fami&s;hed children, or to cau&s;e &s;ome widow's heart to &s;ing for joy, who&s;e hu&s;band has died in the &s;ervice of his country; &s;hould you, I &s;ay, thus be&s;tow what you &s;aved by denying your&s;elf a needle&s;s gratification, would it not afford you more true &s;atisfaction and joy of heart, than you ever received from an <HI>a&s;&s;embly</HI> or a <HI>concert,</HI> or any other diver&s;ion or amu&s;ement?&mdash;It certainly would, unle&s;s you are quite dive&s;ted of humanity. And would not the ble&s;&s;ing of per&s;ons ready to peri&s;h coming on you, be worth more than to be applauded by the unthinking votaries of plea&s;ure, as a jovial companion, a man of ta&s;te, who knew how to &s;pend money and make a figure?</P>
<P>As to the families of &s;oldiers, it is no more than ju&s;tice to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, if they need a&s;&s;i&s;|tance.
<PB N="25" REF="016307_0023_0F9C1F0408794408">For you cannot but be &s;en&s;ible that it is principally owing to our army that you have had an opportunity of acquiring your affluence, and are now in the peaceable en|joyment of it; nor can you be ignorant that their wages have been in&s;ufficient for their &s;upport. And can you pretend to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of brotherly-love, while you neglect to a&s;&s;i&s;t them&mdash;neglect to do ju&s;tice?</P>
<P>You cannot but know that the &s;acred &s;crip|tures repre&s;ent this duty as of the utmo&s;t im|portance. The pa&s;&s;ages to this purpo&s;e, both in the old and new te&s;tament, are almo&s;t in|numerable: And they all de&s;erve the con|&s;ideration of every one who de&s;ires to be ap|proved of God: But I would particularly a&s;k your attention to the words of our ble&s;&s;ed Savior, recorded in the 25th chapter of Mat|thew. There he has given us a repre&s;entation of the final judgment; in which we are taught, that the main thing, upon which the doom of every one will turn, will be the having prac|ti&s;ed, or neglected this duty:&mdash;That when the Son of man &s;hall &s;it upon the throne of his glory, and all nations be gathered before him. &mdash;"He &s;hall &s;ay unto them on his right hand, come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the founda|tion of the world: For I was an hungred and
<PB N="26" REF="016307_0024_0F9C1F040F7AE7E8">ye gave me meat: I was thir&s;ty, and ye gave me drink: I was a &s;tranger, and ye took me in: Naked, and ye cloathed me: I was &s;ick, and ye vi&s;ited me: I was in pri&s;on, and ye came unto me.&mdash;Ina&s;much as ye have done it unto one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e my brethren, ye have done it unto me. Then &s;hall he &s;ay al&s;o unto them on his left hand, depart from me, ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thir&s;ty, and ye gave me no drink: I was a &s;tranger, and ye took me not in: Naked and ye cloathed me not: Sick, and in pri&s;on, and ye vi&s;ited me not.&mdash;Ina&s;much as ye did it not to one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e, ye did it not to me." Can any argument more forceable be devi&s;ed to recommend the practice of charity? What! &s;hall the great Judge of the world, &s;eated upon his tribunal declare before angels and men, that our having relieved a brother in di&s;tre&s;s, was doing a kindne&s;s to him; and accordingly reward us with eternal happine&s;s; &mdash;And that our having neglected to &s;hew kindne&s;s to the nece&s;&s;ituous, was neglecting him; and accordingly puni&s;h us with ever|la&s;ting de&s;truction! And do we after this, need to be urged to this duty? Shall we not rather be &s;earching for objects of charity, and be de|&s;irous of employing as much of the wealth
<PB N="27" REF="016307_0025_0F9C1F04D44EEDC8">which God has given us, in this way, as we can? Thus di&s;po&s;ed of, upon right principles, it will draw more than <HI>&s;terling intere&s;t:</HI>&mdash; It will, in this world, gain us the "favor of God, which is life, and his loving kindne&s;s, which is better than life;" and, in due time, be repaid with glory, honor, and immortal felicity. One would think that this con&s;ider|ation would induce the hard-hearted Mi&s;er, the griping Extortioner, and even the thought|le&s;s Voluptuary, with all the unpitying herd of Worldings, to abound in acts of charity, even from a principle of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. How|ever, if this argument has no effect, I can think of no other that will be likely to pre|vail; and will, therefore, conclude with the words of king Solomon, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e with tho&s;e of our Savior ju&s;t recited; "Who&s;e &s;toppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he al&s;o &s;hall cry him&s;elf, but &s;hall not be heard. &mdash;He that hath pity upon the poor, lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath given, will he pay him again."</P>
