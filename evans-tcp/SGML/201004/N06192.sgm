<P>WE have pre&s;umed to put the following Sheets under your Protection, tho' we have not the Honour of be|ing per&s;onally known to you, nor have applied to you for the Liberty of u&s;ing your celebrated Name on this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>As this Book is a faithful Extract from the Journals of two <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Seamen, late Officers in his Maje|&s;ty's Navy, we thought we could not more properly dedicate it than to a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Admiral.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="007859_0006_102DDA40DE6207C8">
We know your Dete&s;tation of Flattery; and you know, from long Experience, that a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Seaman hath a Spirit too brave to &s;toop to &s;o degenerate a Practice.</P>
<P>The following Pages we hope will recommend them&s;elves to you, be|cau&s;e they are written in a plain maritime Stile, and void of Parti|ality and Prejudice.</P>
<P>The Di&s;tre&s;&s;es mention'd in this Book have perhaps not been equal'd in our Age; and we que&s;tion whe|ther any Navigators living have, for &s;o long a Continuance, &s;uffer'd &s;uch Variety of Hard&s;hips, as the unfortunate People of the <HI>Wager.</HI></P>

<P>We, Sir, who pre&s;ent you with this Book, have been &s;everal Years in the Navy, and thought our&s;elves well acquainted with its Laws and Di&s;cipline, and have many Certifi|cates to produce, that we have al|ways acted in Obedience to Com|mand; but the Proceedings of the Officers and People, &s;ince the Lo&s;s of the Ship, are reckoned &s;o dark and intricate, that we know not what to expect, nor what will be the Re&s;ult of our Superiors Deter|mination.</P>
<P>The only Con&s;olation we have in our pre&s;ent Anxiety, is placed in a Confidence of the unbias'd Integrity,

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS an Introduction, we think proper to ac|quaint the Reader with our Rea&s;ons for cau&s;ing the following Sheets to be made publick to the World. The chief Motive, which induced us to this Ta&s;k, was to clear our Characters, which have been exceedingly blemi&s;h'd by Per|&s;ons who (next to Heaven) owe the Pre&s;ervation of their Lives to our Skill, and indefatigable Care; and who having an Opportunity of arriving be|fore us in <HI>England,</HI> have endeavour'd to rai&s;e their Reputation on the Ruin of Ours.</P>
<P>It will appear to the Reader, on Peru&s;al of the following Pages, that this Journal was at|tempted to he taken from us by Violence at <HI>Rio Janeiro;</HI> that we have pre&s;erved it, at the Ha|zard of our Lives; that there was no Journal kept after the Lo&s;s of the Ship, by any Officers but our&s;elves; and if we had not been careful in making Remarks on each Day's Tran&s;actions, Per&s;ons mu&s;t have continued in the Dark, in re|lation to all the &s;ub&s;equent Proceedings.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="007859_0011_102DDA4C9579C998">
It is a very u&s;ual Thing to publi&s;h Voyages, e&s;pecially when the Navigators have met with any extraordinary Events. We believe, our Expedi|dition, though it was not a Secret, is allowed to be an extraordinary One, and con&s;equently at|tended with extraordinary Events: Indeed while the Commodore was with us, every thing went well, but when the Squadron &s;eparated, Things began to have a new Face; after the Lo&s;s of the <HI>Wager,</HI> there was a general Di&s;order and Con|fu&s;ion among the People, who were now no longer implicitly obedient. There were two Seamen par|ticularly, who propogated this Confu&s;ion, they &s;aid they had &s;uffer'd Ship-wreck in his Maje&s;ty's Ship the <HI>Biddeford,</HI> and received no Wages from the Day that the Ship was lo&s;t; that when they were out of Pay, they look'd upon them&s;elves as their own Ma&s;ters, and no longer &s;ubjected to Command. The People however were not alto|gether infected, but &s;till continued to pay a duti|ful Re&s;pect to their Commander; but when the Captain had ra&s;hly &s;hot Mr. <HI>Cozens</HI> (who&s;e Fate the Reader will find particularly related) they then grew very turbulent and unruly, the Captain daily lo&s;t the Love of the Men, who with their Affection lo&s;t their Duty.</P>
<P>Our confining the Captain is reckoned an au|dacious and unprecedented Action, and our not bringing him home with us, is reckon'd wor&s;e;
<PB N="xii" REF="007859_0012_102DDA4F1BD20648">but the Reader will find that Nece&s;&s;ity ab&s;olutely compell'd us to act as we did, and that we had &s;ufficient Rea&s;ons for leaving him behind.</P>
<P>Our Attempt for Liberty in &s;ailing to the Southward through the Streights of <HI>Magellan</HI> with &s;uch a Number of People, &s;low'd in a Long Boat, has been cen&s;ur'd as a mad Undertaking: De&s;perate Di&s;ea&s;es require de&s;perate Remedies; had we gone to the Northward, there appear'd no Probability of e&s;caping the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and when we had fallen into their Hands, 'tis not unlikely but they might have employed us as Drudges in their Mines for Life, therefore we rather cho&s;e to encounter all Difficulties than to become Slaves to a mercile&s;s Enemy.</P>
<P>Some Per&s;ons have objected again&s;t our Capaci|ty for keeping a Journal of this Nature; but &s;everal Judges of Maritime Affairs, allow this Work to be exact and regular. We think, Per|&s;ons with a common Share of Under&s;tanding are capable of committing to Paper daily Remarks of Matters worthy their Ob&s;ervation, e&s;pecially of Facts in which they them&s;elves had &s;o large a Share. We only relate &s;uch Things as could not po&s;&s;ibly e&s;cape our Knowledge, and what we ac|tually know to be true. We don't &s;et up for Na|turali&s;ts and Men of great Learning, therefore have avoided meddling with Things above our Capacity.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="007859_0013_102DDA51C66EA310">
We are al&s;o condemn'd by many for being too bu&s;y and active for Per&s;ons in our Stations. There was a Nece&s;&s;ity for Action, and a great deal of it too; and had we been as indolent and regardle&s;s for the Pre&s;ervation of the People, as others who were &s;uperior in Command, there would not have been &s;o many who were &s;hipwreck'd in the <HI>Wager,</HI> now in <HI>England</HI> to give a Relation of the Matter.</P>
<P>The Gentleman who commanded in the Long-Boat on his Arrival before us at <HI>Li&s;bon,</HI> re|pre&s;ented us to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants in a ve|ry vile Light, we were even advi&s;ed by &s;ome of our Friends there not to return to our Country, le&s;t we &s;hould &s;uffer Death for Mutiny. But when the Gentlemen of the Factory had perus'd our Journal, they found, if there was any Mutiny in the Ca&s;e, the very Per&s;on who accu&s;ed us, was the Ringleader and chief Mutineer. We were con|fident of our own Innocence, and determin'd to &s;ee our Country at all Events, being po&s;itive that we have acted to the be&s;t of our Under&s;tandings, in all Re&s;pects, for the Pre&s;ervation of our Lives and Liberties; and when our Superiors &s;hall think proper to call us to an Account, which we expect will be at the Commodore's Arrival, we do not doubt but we &s;hall clear our&s;elves in &s;pite of all invidious Reflections and malicious Imputations.</P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="007859_0014_102DDA545CFC5960">
It has been hinted to us, as if publi&s;hing this Journal would give Offence to &s;ome Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction. We can't conceive how any Tran&s;|actions relating to the <HI>Wager,</HI> although made e|ver &s;o publick, can give Offence to any Great M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n at Home. Can it be any Offence to tell the World that we were &s;hip-wreck'd in the <HI>Wager,</HI> when all People know it already? Don't they know that the <HI>Wager</HI> was one of his Maje&s;ty's Store-Ships? That we had on Board not only Naval Stores but other Stores of an immen&s;e Value? Don't they al&s;o know that we went abroad with Hopes of acquiring great Riches, but are return'd Home as poor as Beggars? We are guilty of no indecent Reproaches, or unmannerly Reflections; though, it is certain, we cannot but lament our being en|gaged in &s;o fatal an Expedition. When Per|&s;ons have &s;urmounted great Difficulties, it is a Plea&s;ure for them to relate their Story; and if we give our&s;elves this Satisfaction, who has any Cau&s;e to be offended? Are we, who have faced Death in &s;o many Shapes, to be intimidated, le&s;t we &s;hould give Offence to the&mdash;Lord knows whom? We never &s;aw a &s;atyrical Journal in our Lives, and we though that Kind of Wri|ting was the mo&s;t obnoxious to give Offence.</P>
<P>It has been a Thing u&s;ual, in publi&s;hing of Voyages, to introduce abundance of Fiction; and &s;ome Authors have been e&s;teem'd merely for being
<PB N="xv" REF="007859_0015_102DDA567569FB10">marvelous. We have taken Care to deviate from tho&s;e, by having a &s;trict Regard to Truth. There are undoubtedly in this Book &s;ome Things which will appear incredible. The Account given of the <HI>Patagonian Indians,</HI> and our own Di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, tho' ever &s;o well atte&s;ted, will not ea&s;i|ly obtain Credit; and People will hardly be|lieve that Human Nature could po&s;&s;ibly &s;upport the Mi&s;eries that we have endured.</P>
<P>All the Difficulties related we have actually endur'd, and perhaps mu&s;t endure more: Till the Commodore's Arrival we cannot know our Fate; at pre&s;ent we are out of all Employment, and have nothing to &s;upport our&s;elves and Fami|lies, but the Profits ari&s;ing from the Sale of our Journal; which perhaps may be the Sum Total we &s;hall ever receive for our <HI>Voyage to the South-Seas</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By what is added to this <HI>Second Edition,</HI> it will appear, that after the Arrival of the Captain, the Officers were try'd for the Loft of the Ship, and being all acquitted, except Lieutenant <HI>Beans,</HI> they were paid their Wages to the Time the Ship was wreck'd.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Captain <HI>Kidd</HI> was heard to &s;ay, a few Days before his Death, That this Voyage, which both Officers and Sailors had engag'd in, with &s;o much Cheerfulne&s;s and Alacrity, would prove in the End very far from their Expectations, notwith&s;tanding the va&s;t Trea|&s;ure they imagined to gain by it; that it would end in Poverty, Vermin, Famine, Death and De&s;truction.

<P>The 13th, under reeft Cour&s;es, the Lar|board Tacks; the Commodore being on the Weather Quarter, bore down under our Lee, and &s;poke, with us.

<P>The 14th, the Carpenter return'd from the <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> it being the only Day this Fort|night a Boat could live in the Sea.

The Lieutenant told me, he had &s;aid every Thing he could to di&s;|&s;uade the Captain from it, but found him de|termin'd to go there. The fifth Night, and every Night after, made Sail; the Wind to the We&s;tward. I never reliev'd the Lieute|nant, but I a&s;k'd him, what he thought of a Lee-&s;hore with the Ship in this Condition? he always reply'd, He could not tell. We

The Lieutenant and Mate being by, I &s;aid, Gentlemen, what can we do with the Ship in the mi&s;erable Condition &s;he is in on a Lee-&s;hore? The Leiutenant an&s;wer'd, When|ever I have been with the Captain &s;ince our fir&s;t lying to, I always per&s;waded him to go for <HI>Juan Ferdinandez;</HI> therefore I would have you go to him, he may be per&s;waded by you, tho' he will not by me. I &s;aid, If that was the Ca&s;e, my going to him is need|le&s;s. In a Quarter of an Hour afterwards, the Captain &s;ent for me, and &s;aid, Gunner! What Longitude have you made? I told him 82. 30. What di&s;tance do you reckon your&s;elf off the Land? I an&s;wer'd, about 60 Leagues: But if the two I&s;lands we &s;aw are tho&s;e which are laid down in your Chart to lay off <HI>Brewer</HI>'s <HI>Streights,</HI> and the &s;ame Current continues with the We&s;tern &s;well, we can't be above a third Part of the Di&s;tance off the Land. The Captain made An&s;wer, as for the Cur|rents, there is no Account to be given for 'em; &s;ometimes they &s;et one Way, and &s;ome|times another. I &s;aid, Sir, very true; but
<PB N="14" REF="007859_0046_102DDA9B3979BAD8">as the Ship has been always under reeft Cour&s;es, with the Mizen-Ma&s;t gone, &s;he mu&s;t wholly drive to Leeward, and nigher the Land than expected. The Captain then told me, I &s;uppo&s;e you are not unacquainted of my rendezvous for the I&s;land of <HI>No&s;tra Signora Di Socora,</HI> in the Latitude of 44. I reply'd, Sir, the Ship is in a very bad Condition to come in with the Lee-&s;hore; and if it is po&s;&s;ible to bring the Ship to an Anchor, we &s;hall never purcha&s;e him again. The Captain an&s;wer'd, I don't de&s;ign to come to an Anchor; for there are no Soundings until you come within &s;even Leagues of the Land. I purpo&s;e to &s;tand off and on twenty-four Hours; and if I don't &s;ee the Commo|dore, or any of the Squadron in that Time, we will go for <HI>Juan Ferdinandez.</HI> To this I &s;aid, Sir, the Ship is a perfect Wreck; our Mizen-Ma&s;t gone, with our &s;tanding rig|ging afore and abaft, and all our People down; therefore I can't &s;ee what we can do in with the Land.

<P>On the 13th, at Eight in the Morning, the Straps of the Fore-Jeer Blocks broke; reeff'd the Top ropes, and lower'd the Yard; went

He an&s;wer'd, No. The Carpenter &s;hew'd it him, and he &s;aw it plain. The Carpenter then &s;hew'd it to the Lieutenant; but he would not believe it to be Land, becau&s;e it bore N. N. W. and &s;aid it was impo&s;&s;ible; there|fore he never inform'd the Captain of the Sight of Land, as the Honourable Mr. <HI>Byron</HI> hath heard the Captain &s;ay. At Two in the Afternoon lower'd the Fore-Yard, and hawl'd the Fore-&s;ail up. Notwith&s;tanding I was Officer of the Watch, I was oblig'd to go upon the Fore-Yard, where was Mr. <HI>Camp|bell</HI> Mid&s;hipman, one Boat&s;wain's Mate, four Seamen, and the Ma&s;ter's Servant; which were all the Hands we could get out of the Ship's Company to a&s;&s;i&s;t. Whil&s;t on the Yard I &s;aw the Land very plain, on the Lar|board-beam, bearing N. W. half N. neare&s;t High Land, with Hillocks, and one remark|able Hommacoe like a Sugar-loaf, very high. At the Sight of Land I came off the Fore-yard, and acquainted the Captain. He imme|diately gave Orders to &s;way the Fore-yard
<PB N="16" REF="007859_0048_102DDAA04C4C9710">up, and &s;et the Fore-&s;ail; then we wore Ship, with her Head to the Southward. The Cap|tain coming forward unhappily received a Fall, which di&s;located his Shoulder, &s;o that he was obliged to be put into the Surgeon's Cab|bin. Some Time after he &s;ent for the Lieu|tenant and my&s;elf, acquainting us of the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity there was for making Sail, as being on a Lee-Shore; therefore de&s;ired we would u&s;e our utmo&s;t Endeavours to crowd the Ship off. You &s;ee, Gentlemen, &s;aid he, my Misfortune will not permit me to continue on the Deck: As for the Ma&s;ter, he is not worthy of the Charge of a Watch; there|fore I mu&s;t de&s;ire you Mr. <HI>Bulkely,</HI> to be in the Watch with him, and to make but two Watches: Keep a good Look-out, and, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;et the Main-top-&s;ail.

The Ship for the&s;e three Weeks hath been no better than a Wreck; the Mizen-ma&s;t gone; the &s;tanding rigging and Chain-Plates, afore and abaft, mo&s;tly broke and ruin'd. The Top-&s;ails now at the Yards are &s;o bad, that if we attempt to loo&s;e 'em for making Sail, we are in Danger of &s;plitting 'em; and we have not a &s;pare Sail in the Ship that can be brought to the Yard without being repair'd. This is the pre&s;ent deplorable Situation of the Ship.

In a &s;hort Time after, &s;he &s;truck, bilged, and grounded, be|tween two &s;mall I&s;lands, where Providence directed us to &s;uch a Place as we could &s;ave our Lives. When the Ship &s;truck it was about Break of Day, and not above a Mu&s;ket-&s;hot from the Shore. Launch'd the Barge, Cutter, and Yaul over the Gunnel; cut the Main and Fore-Ma&s;t by the Board, and the Sheet-Anchor from the Gunnel. The Cap|tain &s;ent the Barge on Shore, with Mr. <HI>Snow</HI> the Mate, to &s;ee if the Place was inhabited, and to return aboard directly; but, without any regard to his Duty, or the Pre&s;ervation of the Lives of the People, he &s;taid a&s;hore. The Barge not returning as expected, the Lieutenant was &s;ent in the Yawl, with Orders to bring off the Barge. The Lieute|nant tarried a&s;hore, but &s;ent off the Boat. As &s;oon as the Boat came on Board, the Cap|tain, being very iil, was per&s;uaded by the Officers to go a&s;hore: With the Captain went the Land Officers, Mate, and Mid|&s;hipmen; the Officers remaining on Board were the Ma&s;ter, Boat&s;wain, Gunner, and Carpenter: The Boat&s;wain, who was laid up a Month before the Lo&s;s of the Ship, became
<PB N="19" REF="007859_0051_102DDAA63229B490">of a &s;udden very vigorous and active. At Night it blow'd very hard at North, with a great tumbling Sea; we expected every Mo|ment that the Ship would part, fetching &s;uch Jirks and Twi&s;tings as &s;hock'd every Per&s;on aboard, who had the lea&s;t Care for the Pre|&s;ervation of Life; yet, in the di&s;mal Situa|tion we were in, we had &s;everal in the Ship &s;o thoughtle&s;s of their Danger, &s;o &s;tupid, and in&s;en&s;ible of their Mi&s;ery, that upon the principal Officers leaving her, they fell into the mo&s;t violent Outrage and Di&s;order: They began with broaching the Wine in the Laza|retto; then to breaking open Cabbins and Che&s;ts, arming them&s;elves with Swords and Pi&s;tols, threatning to murder tho&s;e who &s;hould oppo&s;e or que&s;tion them: Being drunk and mad with Liquor, they plunder'd Che&s;ts and Cabbins for Money and other Things of Va|lue, cloathed them&s;elves in the riche&s;t Appa|rel they could find, and imagined them&s;elves Lords, Paramount.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 15th the Ship was bilged in the Mid-&s;hips on a great rock; we took Care to &s;ecure &s;ome Powder, Ball, and a little Bread. In the Afternoon, the Carpenter and my&s;elf went a&s;hore with &s;everal of tho&s;e imaginary Lords in the rich Attire they had

On our coming a&s;hore, we found the Captain had taken his Lodging in a little Hut, &s;uppos'd to be built by <HI>Indians;</HI> as for our Parts, we were forced to take Shelter under a great Tree, where we made a large Fire; but it rain'd &s;o hard, that it had almo&s;t co&s;t us our Lives; an Invalid died that very Night on the Spot. Before I left the Ship I went to my Cabbin for my Jour|nal, but could not find it; I believe it is de|&s;troy'd with the re&s;t, for there is not one Journal to be produced; we have good rea|&s;on to apprehend there was a Per&s;on employ'd to de&s;troy them; I afterwards found Part of the Ma&s;ter's Journal along &s;hore, tore to Pieces: Whatever is related in this Book, preceeding the Lo&s;s of the <HI>Wager,</HI> is extracted from a Journal belonging to a Gentleman lately an Officer on Board the <HI>Pearl.</HI> After we lo&s;t &s;ight of the <HI>Pearl,</HI> I was oblig'd to have recour&s;e to my Memory, which I be|lieve has been very faithful to me.

<P>On the 16th, the Weather very boi&s;terous, and a great Sea, the Boat&s;wain wanted a Boat; but finding no Appearance of any coming aboard, brought a Quarter-deck Gun, a four Pounder, to bear on the Captain's Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and fir'd two Shot, which went ju&s;t over the Captain's Tent. This Day, being re&s;olv'd to contrive &s;omething like a Hou&s;e, to &s;ecure us from the Inclemency of the rain, and Severity of the Weather, we hawl'd up the Cutter, and propping her up, we made a tolerable Habitation. As for Food this I&s;land produces none; nor is there any Vegetable upon it but Cellery, which grows here in abundance, and is of great U&s;e to us, the Men being in general very much troubled with the Scurvy.</P>

<P>The 8th, Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> and my&s;elf went to the De&s;erters; we find they are determined to go off to the Northward; the rea&s;on of their Stay is the Want of Craft to go off in. They now find them&s;elves mi&s;taken, they believed at fir&s;t they were on the Main, but are convinced they are four or five Leagues from it, therefore they purpo&s;e to build a Punt out of the Wreck of the Ship: They live on Sea Weed and Shell Fi&s;h; got up one Ca&s;k of Beef, which was brought on Shore with a Ca&s;k of Brandy, found one Ca&s;k of Beef on the rocks.</P>
<P>On <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 9th, I went with the Doc|tor's Mate to the De&s;erters, and &s;poke to <HI>William Oram,</HI> a Carpenter, and a very u&s;eful Man, de&s;iring him to return, with a Promi&s;e of Pardon from the Captain: In this Affair I was obliged to Act very &s;ecretly. To-day, Mr. <HI>Cozens,</HI> the Mid&s;hipman, had a Di&s;|pute with the Surgeon; the latter having

In the Evening the Captain &s;ent for me and the Carpenter to his Tent: We found with the Captain, the Lieu|tenant, Pur&s;er, Surgeon, and Lieutenant <HI>Hamilton</HI> of Marines. Here we had a Con|&s;ultation, which was chiefly concerning the Di&s;turbances among the People, as well in our Tent as in the re&s;t. Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> and I a&s;&s;u|red the Captain, that the People in our Tent were generally very well affected to him, and that we never would engage in any Mutiny again&s;t him, or any other Officer that would act for the publick Good, and his Ma|je&s;ty's Service: The Captain &s;aid, he had no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect us, for we were the only two in the Ship, that he put any Tru&s;t or Confidence in; &s;trict Orders were given the Centinel to keep a good Look-out, and have a watchful Eye on the Provi&s;ions; notwith|&s;tanding all this Precaution and Care, there was one third Part of a Barrel of Flour, and half a Barrel of Gunpowder taken away that Night. It is to be ob&s;erved, that this
<PB N="30" REF="007859_0062_102DDAB9C93D8E08">Day's Con&s;ultation was the fir&s;t that Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> ever had with his Officers; had he &s;ometimes con&s;ulted them aboard, we might probably have e&s;caped our pre&s;ent unhappy Condition.</P>

In our Tent we had eigh|teen of the &s;toute&s;t Fellows that belonged to the Ship; and I believe the Captain, and the Gentlemen above-mentioned, have &s;ome Su&s;|picion of Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> and my&s;elf, believing we can &s;way mo&s;t of the Seamen on Shore:
<PB N="32" REF="007859_0064_102DDABDB4989598">But I think this Day we have given a Proof of the Sincerity of our Intentions, and our Dete&s;tation of Mutiny, by not appearing in Arms at the report of Mr. <HI>Cozens</HI> being &s;hot; we walked up with the Captain, where we &s;aw Mr. <HI>Cozens</HI> with his Elbow on the Ground re&s;ting his right Cheek on the Palm of his Hand, alive, and to Appearance &s;en&s;ible, but &s;peechle&s;s; the Captain ordered him to the &s;ick Tent, the Surgeon's Mate dre&s;&s;ed his left Cheek where he was &s;hot, and felt a Ball about three Inches under his right Eye; the Surgeon refu&s;ed dre&s;&s;ing him; this we may impute to his having lately a Quarrel with Mr. <HI>Cozens,</HI> which has been already mentioned. The &s;hooting of Mr. <HI>Cozens</HI> was a very unhappy Affair: the Per&s;on who&s;e Al|lowance was &s;topped, made no Complaint to him, he was too officious in the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and his preceeding Behaviour, and notorious di&s;re&s;pectful Words to the Captain, might probably make the Captain &s;u&s;pect his De|&s;ign was Mutiny; tho' this we mu&s;t aver, that Mr. <HI>Cozens</HI> neither on this, or any other Oc|ca&s;ion, appeared in Arms &s;ince the Lo&s;s of the Ship: However, his Fate laid the Foundation of a great deal of Mi&s;chief which afterwards followed.</P>

<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 29th, launch'd the Yawl to go with the <HI>Indians</HI> to &s;hew us where they get the Mu&s;cles; but being too late for the Tide, we came away without any: The Captain &s;ent to our Tent two Quarters of Mutton; the Carpenter daily at Work on the Long-Boat.

The Captain &s;aid, That's true, and I can get Bills of Credit in any Part of <HI>Brazil;</HI> be&s;ides, the People may be &s;eparated, &s;ome in the <HI>Flota,</HI> and &s;ome in other Ships; with le&s;s Hands we may go to <HI>Barbados.</HI> Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> told him, We might venture to <HI>England</HI> with twelve Hands. Yes, you may, &s;ays the Captain, with thirty. It is to be ob&s;erv'd, during all this Debate, the Lieutenant &s;poke not a Word. The Carpen|ter a&s;king him the rea&s;on of his Silence i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> all the Con&s;ulation he; an&s;wer'd, I'll give my Opinion hereafter.

I ima|gin'd the Captain meant our Paper, and im|mediately an&s;wer'd with &s;ome Warmth, As he had refus'd &s;igning at fir&s;t, and at the
<PB N="56" REF="007859_0088_102DDAEF6F5CD508">&s;ame Time agreed to the Propo&s;al, that I had &s;ign'd &s;o clo&s;e, that there was no room left for his Name, and now it was too late for him to &s;ign. The Captain &s;urpriz'd me, by &s;ay|ing, I don't mean your Paper. I told him, Any other, which &s;hould be contrary to ours, would never be &s;ign'd by us. Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> &s;aid to the Captain, Sir, 'tis all owing to you that we are here; if you had con&s;ulted your Officers, we might have avoided this Misfor|tune; con&s;idering the Condition the Ship was in, &s;he was not fit to come in with the Land, all our Men being &s;ick, and not above three Seamen in a Watch; &s;uppo&s;e the Ma&s;t had gone by the Board, as was every Moment expected. The Captain made An&s;wer, Gen|tlemen, you do not know my Orders, there never were any &s;o &s;trict given to a Com|mander before; and had I but two Men li|ving be&s;ides my&s;elf, I mu&s;t, and was obliged to go to the fir&s;t rendezvous, which was the I&s;land of <HI>No&s;tra Senhora di Socora:</HI> I was obliged to go there at all Events. I made An&s;wer to this, Sir, if that is the Ca&s;e, it &s;eems plain, the Thing was de&s;ign'd we &s;hould be here; But, Sir, I am of Opinion, notwith|&s;tanding the Commodore had his Orders from &mdash;to go with the Squadron to <HI>Baldavia,</HI>
<PB N="57" REF="007859_0089_102DDAF157F938E8">that at the &s;ame Time tho&s;e Orders were &s;o far di&s;cretional, that if the Squadron was di&s;|abled, Care was to be taken not to endanger his Maje&s;ty's Ships. Yes, that (&s;ays the Cap|tain) was &s;ettled at <HI>St. Julian</HI>'s: Notwith|&s;tanding what has been &s;aid, Gentlemen, I am agreeable to take any Chance with you, and to go any Way; but would have you con&s;ider of it, and defer your Determination till all is ready to go off the Spot. I then told the Captain, You have known, Sir, from the Time you &s;aw the Propo&s;al, that the People are unea&s;y, and the Work is at a Stand, and in this Situation Things will be until this Affair is &s;ettled; therefore the &s;ooner you re&s;olve, the better. The Captain re|ply'd, I de&s;ign to have a Con&s;ultation among my Officers: Have you any more Objections to make? I an&s;wer'd, Yes, Sir, one more; which is, When you go from hence, you are not to weigh, come to an Anchor, or alter Cour&s;e, without con&s;ulting your Officers. The Captain &s;aid, Gentlemen, I was your Commander till the Ship parted, or as long as any Stores or Provi&s;ions were getting out of her. We told him, we had always taken Care to obey his Orders in the &s;tricte&s;t Man|ner; which he allow'd us to have done; and
<PB N="58" REF="007859_0090_102DDAF43627E828">he added, You were the Officers that I placed my whole Dependence in. We an&s;wer'd, Sir, we will &s;upport you with our Lives, at long as you &s;uffer rea&s;on to rule; and then we parted. After this Con&s;ultation the Cap|tain &s;eldom came out of his Tent, which oc|ca&s;ion'd great Di&s;turbances among the People.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 7th, the Wind at W. N. W. with rain. This Day the Navigators work'd the Bearings and Di&s;tance along Shore, from one Place to another, to know the true Di&s;|tance: Hereupon it was agreed to proceed through the <HI>Streights of Magellan,</HI> according to Sir <HI>John Narborough</HI>'s Directions, which give us great Encouragement to go that Way. Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI> draw'd his Men up, and di&s;mi&s;s'd 'em again. Great Unea&s;ine&s;s among the People.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 8th, this Morning went to the Lieutenant, for him to acquaint the Cap|tain all his Officers were ready to give &s;uffi|cient rea&s;ons for going through the <HI>Streights of Magellan,</HI> de&s;iring a Con&s;ultation might be held in the Afternoon. At Three o'Clock the Captain &s;ent for me and Mr. <HI>Cummins;</HI> when we came, the Ma&s;ter and Bort&s;wain were &s;ent for, but they were gone in Search of Sub&s;i&s;tence, as Limpets, Mu&s;cles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="007859_0091_102DDAF5D2FB2950">The Captain &s;aid, Gentlemen, I don't doubt but you have con&s;ider'd upon the Bu&s;ine&s;s you are come about; therefore I am determin'd to take my Fate, with you, or where the Spirit of the People leads, and &s;hall u&s;e my be&s;t Endeavours for their Pre&s;ervation; but I am afraid of meeting contrary Winds, for after the Sun has cro&s;s'd the Line we mu&s;t expect to meet 'em. I made An&s;wer, By all Accounts, the Wind hangs from N. W. to the S. W. above three Parts of the Year; which is in our Favour. Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> told him, There was fre&s;h Water to be got as well on one Coa&s;t as the other; and if Sir <HI>John Narborough</HI>'s Treatment was &s;o ill in a profound Peace, what mu&s;t we expect in a Time of open War? The Captain &s;aid, I am afraid very bad. Then Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> &s;poke in this Manner to the Captain: Sir, I always took you for an honourable Gentle|man, and I believe you to be &s;uch; on your Honour, Sir, I beg you will give the true Sentiments of your Mind, whether thro' the <HI>Streights</HI> is not the &s;ure&s;t and &s;afe&s;t Way to pre&s;erve our Lives, notwith&s;tanding we have a Thou&s;and Difficulties to encounter with any Way? The Captain an&s;wer'd, I really think going to the Northward is the
<PB N="60" REF="007859_0092_102DDAF76A118418">&s;afe&s;t Way; for &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hould be drove off to Sea, when on the other Side the Land, what is to be done then? I &s;aid, Sir, it is our Bu&s;ine&s;s to keep the Shore, to prevent all Accidents that may happen that Way. Then Lieutenant <HI>Beans</HI> made an Objection, Suppo&s;e you have the Wind blowing right in, and a tumbling Sea, &s;o as to endanger the Boat, what are we to do? I made An&s;wer, Sir, If you remember, when we were riding at <HI>St. Juli|an</HI>'s, it blow'd a very hard Gale of Wind right in from the Sea, yet, even then, the Sea did not run &s;o high as to endanger a Boat riding at Anchor: Another In&s;tance I bring you from <HI>St. Catherine</HI>'s, when we had &s;uch hard Gales, that the <HI>Tryal</HI> lo&s;t her Ma&s;ts, and the <HI>Pearl</HI> &s;eparated from the Squadron; yet, at that Time, there was no Sea compa|rable to what we have met with this Side the Land. The Lieutenant allow'd this to be Fact. Then the Captain &s;aid, I will allow you to have Water at <HI>Port De&s;ire;</HI> but do you con&s;ider the lengthening your Di&s;tance, by keeping along Shore, and rounding every Bay, and &s;ome of tho&s;e Bays are very deep. I told him, That undoubtedly there was Wa|ter all along the Coa&s;t, and that we had no Bu&s;ine&s;s to round the Bays, but to &s;teer from
<PB N="61" REF="007859_0093_102DC6F66F8CD618">one Head-land to the other. Then Lieute|nant <HI>Beans</HI> made a &s;econd Objection, Sup|po&s;e we are forced into a Bay, and Shoal-Water? I an&s;wer'd, We &s;hould always have a Boat a-head, and our Draught of Water will not be above four or five Feet at mo&s;t; and if we &s;hould be &s;o unfortunate as to lo&s;e our Boat, we mu&s;t keep the Lead a going. The Lieutenant reply'd, That was true, and there could not be a great deal of Difficulty in it. This was the only Time the Lieutenant ever &s;poke in Publick on the Affair; he always allow'd, when ab&s;ent from the Cap|tain, that going through the <HI>Streights</HI> was the be&s;t Way; but in the Captain's Pre&s;ence he &s;ided with him, and was for going to the Northward.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 9th, at Three this Afternoon, I went with Mr. <HI>Cummins,</HI> the Ma&s;ter, and Boat&s;wain, as de&s;ir'd, to the Captain, to give him our Opinions, believing, going thro' the <HI>Streights</HI> the &s;ure&s;t Way to pre&s;erve Life: It was therefore agreed, That if the Wind did not &s;et in again&s;t us, at the Sun's Cro&s;&s;ing the Line, that the Captain would go that Way. The Captain ask'd every Man's Opi|nion, and found the People unanimous for the <HI>Streights of Magellan.</HI> To-day, being
<PB N="62" REF="007859_0094_102DDAFB9CBB5CA8">fair Weather, launch'd the Yawl to go a Fowling; &s;hot &s;everal Gee&s;e, Ducks, Shaggs, and Sea-pies. Heel'd the Long-Boat for planking.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 10th, Wind at N. and N.N.W. rainy Weather. Eat Slaugh and Sea-weed fry'd with Tallow-Candles, which we pick'd up along Shore; this we reckon at pre&s;ent exceeding good Eating, having nothing to live on but a Quarter of a Pound of Flour a Man <HI>per</HI> Day, and what we can get off the rocks; for many Days the Weather has been &s;o bad, that we have not been able to &s;tir abroad, though almo&s;t &s;tarv'd for want of Food.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 11th, hard Gales at S. W. with heavy rains. This Afternoon the People came in Arms to acquaint us of the Stores being robbed; they therefore wanted our Con&s;ent for moving the Stores to our Tent; on which we de&s;ir'd they would de&s;i&s;t from offering any Violence; we told 'em of the ill Con&s;equence of Mutiny, which, as we al|ways abhorr'd, we took all imaginable Care to prevent: The People, on our Per&s;ua&s;ions, in&s;tantly quitted their Arms. The Captain pre&s;ently &s;ent for me and Mr. <HI>Cummins,</HI> to acquaint us with what had happen'd: He
<PB N="63" REF="007859_0095_102DDAFDDE34C5D8">told us, the Pur&s;er accidentally coming by, &s;aw the Pri&s;oner, <HI>Rowland Cru&s;&s;et,</HI> a Marine, crawling from the Bu&s;hes, and from under the Store-Tent, and found on him upwards of a Day's Flour for Ninety Souls, with one Piece of Beef under his Coat, and three Pieces more, which were conceal'd in the Bu&s;hes, to carry off when an Opportunity offer'd; and the Centry, <HI>Thomas Smith,</HI> his Me&s;s-mate, a Marine, undoubtedly was privy to the robbery. The Captain farther &s;aid, We have nothing to do with them; but I &s;hall &s;end to Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI> to in&s;i&s;t on a Court-Martial: I really think, that for rob|bing the Store-Tent (which, in our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, is &s;tarving the whole Body of People) the Pri&s;oners de&s;erve Death. This was not only the Captain's Opinion, but in|deed the Sentiments of every Per&s;on pre&s;ent. After we parted from the Captain, we were &s;ent for by Capt. <HI>Pemberton:</HI> He acquainted us, he would go as far as the Martial Law would allow him, and in Conjunction with the Sea-Officers: I look (&s;aid he) on the Lieutenant as nothing, and the Captain in the &s;ame Light: As for you two (meaning the Gunner and Carpenter) I confide in, and &s;hall have re|gard to your Opinions. When the Articles
<PB N="64" REF="007859_0096_102DDB0088C21890">of War were read, we found their Crime did not touch Life, but that they were to &s;uffer Corporal Puni&s;hment. Whil&s;t Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> was laying open the Nature of their Guilt, and the ill Con&s;equence of Lenity in the Cir|cum&s;tances we were in, I propos'd a Way, next to Death; which was, if judg'd proper by Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI> and Captain <HI>Cheap,</HI> to carry them off to an I&s;land where the Ship parted, there being Mu&s;cles, Limpets, and Clams in Abundance, and no want of Water, and there to be left till we &s;hould be ready for &s;ailing; and, to &s;trike a Terror in all for the future, that if any Man &s;hould be guilty of the like Offence, without any re&s;pect of Per&s;on, he &s;hould &s;hare the &s;ame Fate. This Propo&s;al was approved of by both the Cap|tains. At Night Lieutenant <HI>Beans</HI> &s;urpriz'd us with a new kind of Propo&s;al we little dreamt of, which was, to have a proper Place of Devotion to perform Divine Ser|vice in every Sabbath-Day: For this Sacred Office our Tent was judg'd the mo&s;t commo|dious Place. The Duty of publick Prayer had been entirely neglected on board, though every Seaman pays Four-pence per Month towards the Support of a Mini&s;ter; yet De|votion, in &s;o &s;olemn a Manner, is &s;o rarely
<PB N="65" REF="007859_0097_102DDB0276818978">perform'd that I know but one In&s;tance of it during the many Years I have belong'd to the Navy. We believe religion to have the lea&s;t Share in this Propo&s;al of the Lieute|nant. If our Tent &s;hould be turn'd into a a Hou&s;e of Prayer, and this Project takes, we may, perhaps, in the Mid&s;t of our Devotion, be &s;urpriz'd, and our Arms taken from us, in order to fru&s;trate our De&s;igns, and pre|vent our return to <HI>England</HI> through the <HI>Streights of Magellan,</HI> or any other Way.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 12th, hard Gales from S.W. to W. with heavy Showers of Hail and rain. Serv'd out Provi&s;ions To-day, a Piece of Beef for four Men; &s;ome Time pa&s;t we have had but a Quarter of a Pound of Flour per Man per Day, and three Pieces of Beef; we live chiefly on Mu&s;&s;les, Limpits, and Clams, with Saragraza and Thromba; one is a green broad Weed, common on the rocks in <HI>England;</HI> the other is a round Sea-Weed, &s;o large, that a Man can &s;carce gra&s;p it; it grows in the Sea, with broad Leaves; this la&s;t we boil, the Saragraza we fry in Tallow; in this Manner we &s;upport Life: Even tho&s;e Shell-Fi&s;h and Weeds we get with great Difficulty; for the Wind, the rain, and Coldne&s;s of the Cli|mate in this Sea&s;on, are &s;o extremely &s;evere,
<PB N="66" REF="007859_0098_102DDB04703998A8">that a Man will pau&s;e &s;ome Time whether he &s;hall &s;tay in his Tent and &s;tarve, or go out in Que&s;t of Food.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 14th, very hard Gales at W. and N. W. with Showers of rain and Hail, which beat with &s;uch Violence again&s;t a Man's Face, that he can hardly with&s;tand it; however, one of our Me&s;s-mates To-day &s;hot three Gulls and a Hawk; which gave us a very elegant repa&s;t. This Day was held a Court-Martial on the Centry who was believ'd confederated with the Marine that robbed the Store-Tent: Sentence was pa&s;s'd on 'em to receive &s;ix hundred La&s;hes each: Captain <HI>Cheap,</HI> not thinking the Puni&s;h|ment adequate to the Crime, cut 'em &s;hort of their Allowance; &s;o that they have now but half the Provi&s;ions they had before: The Day following the Offenders receiv'd Two Hundred La&s;hes each, as Part of their Puni&s;h|ment. We hawl'd the Long-Boat higher up, for fear the Sea &s;hould wa&s;h the Blocks from under her. We have found out a new Way of managing the Slaugh; we fry it in thin Batter with Tallow, and u&s;e it as Bread.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 16th, Fre&s;h Gales of Wind at S. W. with heavy Showers of Hail: The People generally complain of a Malady in
<PB N="67" REF="007859_0099_102DDB0664727D78">their Eyes; they are in great Pain, and can &s;carce &s;ee to walk about. The la&s;t Tide flowed nine Feet perpendicular; To-day we picked up Shell-Fi&s;h in Abundance, with Pieces of Beef and Pork. The Pri&s;oners re|ceived two Hundred La&s;hes more.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 18th, this Day the Carpenter, who has all along been indefatigable in working about the Long-Boat, &s;aw one of the Seamen cutting up an Anchor Stock for Fire-Wood, which had been de&s;igned for a particular U&s;e for the Boat; at Sight of the Fellow's Folly be could not contain him&s;elf: This Affair, added to the little Concern and intollerable Indifference that appeared in the Generality of the People, for &s;ome Time impaired his Under&s;tanding, and made him delirious; all po&s;&s;ible Methods are u&s;ed to re&s;tore him, as he is the only Man, who, through the A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of Providence, can compleat the Means of our Deliverance.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 19th, The Carpenter was &s;o much recovered, that he went to work as u&s;ual; at Night, the Lieutenant acquainted us, that the Captain de&s;ired to &s;peak with the Carpenter and me To-morrow at Noon, to con&s;ult what &s;hould be done with the Two Pri&s;oners, having received but Four Hundrrd
<PB N="68" REF="007859_0100_102DDBB8A524AAC0">La&s;hes out of the Six, to which they were &s;entenced by a Court-Martial, the other Two Hundred being remitted by their own Offi|cers.</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 20th, We waited on the Captain, who acquainted us with what the Lieutenant had mentioned la&s;t Night relating to the Pri&s;oners: We told him the People were very unea&s;y about this Mitigation of the Puni&s;hment inflicted on them by a Court Martial; therefore it was agreed they &s;hould provide for them&s;elves as well as they could; but to have no Sort of Provi&s;ions out of the Store-Tent for the future.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 22d, we begun upon &s;everal Contrivances to get Provi&s;ions, &s;uch as build|ing Punts, Ca&s;k-Boats, Leather-Boats, and the like.</P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> the 23d, The Store-Tent was again robbed, and, on Examination, was found a Deficiency of Twelve Days Brandy for Ninety Men: The Lieutenant, my&s;elf, and Carpenter went to the Captain to con&s;ult &s;ome Way which might effectually prevent tho&s;e villainous Practices for the future; the Captain de&s;ired us to make a nice Enquiry into this robbery, being determined to in|flict the &s;evere&s;t Puni&s;hment on the Offen|ders;
<PB N="69" REF="007859_0101_102DDB08AA01EBE8">tho' it would give him the greate&s;t Concern if any innocent Per&s;on &s;hould &s;uffer. This Day we confined one of the Centinels for being drunk on his Po&s;t; the Day follow|ing the Boat&s;wain gave us Information of the Per&s;ons who had robbed the Tent; they were two Centinels, <HI>Smith</HI> and <HI>Butler;</HI> tho&s;e very Per&s;ons were the fir&s;t who in&s;i&s;ted, that the Seamen, as well as them&s;elves, &s;hould watch the Store-Tent; their own Officers, as ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, have brought them to no Examination: We have al&s;o Information that the Pur&s;er holds frequent Conver&s;ation with the rebels, contrary to all the Laws of the Navy, &s;up|plying them with Liquors in Abundance, to the great Di&s;tre&s;s of his Maje&s;ty's faithful Subjects, who have but Half a Pint per Day to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on. There are now great Di&s;tur|bances among the People concerning going to the Northward; they believe Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> never intended to return to <HI>Eng|land</HI> by his propo&s;ing this Way, in Oppo&s;ition to the Opinion of all the Navigators, who have given rea&s;ons for going thro' the <HI>Streights of Magellan.</HI> There is a Sort of Party-rage among the People, fomented by a kind of Bribery that has more Influence on the Seamen than Money; there are &s;ome daily

As &s;oon as the Officers were &s;eated, a Con&s;ultation was held concerning <HI>Smith</HI> and <HI>Butler</HI>'s robbing the Store-Tent; they were &s;entenced to be tran|&s;ported to the Main, or &s;ome I&s;land. As &s;oon as this Affair was over, we talk'd to the Captain of the Unea&s;ine&s;s among the People; that there had been a long Time a vi&s;ible In|quietude among 'em, and that we could not help &s;eeing there were Schemes form'd to ob|&s;truct our De&s;ign in going to the Southward. The Captain an&s;wer'd, Gentlemen, it is Time enough to think of this when we are ready to go off: Have not I told you before, that I do not care which Way I go, Southward or Northward? I will take my Fate with you. Every Body now expected the Lieutenant to reply, e&s;pecially after the Zeal he expre&s;s'd
<PB N="73" REF="007859_0105_102DDB121C0FC6E0">him&s;elf with the Day before; but he &s;at &s;peechle&s;s, without any regard to the Wel|fare of the People, or to his own Propo&s;als. Finding he did not move in the Affair, I took out the Paper which was agreed to by the Lieutenant and the re&s;t of the Officers, and read it to the Captain, and ask'd him to &s;ign it; which he &s;trenuou&s;ly oppos'd and &s;eem'd very much enrag'd that it &s;hould be propos'd to him. Upon this we dropt the Matter, and began to di&s;cour&s;e concerning the Provi|&s;ions: We thought it nece&s;&s;ary, that ten Weeks Sub&s;i&s;tence &s;hould be &s;ecur'd to carry with us, and that the Liquor &s;hould be buried under Ground; but he gave us no An&s;wer. Finding no relief here, we went to Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI>'s Tent, to con&s;ult with him what we &s;hould do in the pre&s;ent Exigence. On our coming out from the Captain, we &s;aw a Flag hoi&s;ted on Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI>'s Tent, the Captain him&s;elf &s;eated in a Chair, &s;urrounded by the People. On &s;eeing this, all the Officers pre&s;ent at the Con&s;ultation, except the Lieu|tenant, went over to Captain <HI>Pemberton.</HI> Here it was agreed, in Ca&s;e the Captain per&s;i&s;ted to refu&s;e &s;igning the Paper, to take the Com|mand from him, and to give it the Lieutenant, according to the Lieutenant's own Propo&s;al.
<PB N="74" REF="007859_0106_102DDB13B5DAE938">At the &s;ame Time Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI> told the People, he would &s;tand by 'em with his Life, in going through the <HI>Streights of Magellan,</HI> the Way propos'd in the Paper. The People gave three Cheers, crying aloud for <HI>England.</HI> The Captain hearing the Noi&s;e, got out of Bed to his Tent Door, and call'd the People, enquiring what they wanted; then &s;ent for all the Officers: He was then told, &s;ince he refus'd &s;igning the Paper, and had no regard to the Safety of our Provi&s;ions, the People unanimou&s;ly agreed to take the Command from him, and transfer it to the Lieutenant. Hearing this, with an exalted Voice, Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> &s;ays, Who is he that will take the Command from me? Addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Lieutenant, Is it you, Sir? The Lieute|nant reply'd, No, Sir. The Terror of the Captain's A&s;pect intimidated the Lieutenant to that Degree, that he look'd like a Gho&s;t. We left him with the Captain, and return'd to Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI>'s Tent, to acquaint him of the Lieutenant's refu&s;ing the Command. We had not been long here before Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> &s;ent for us. I was the fir&s;t Per&s;on call'd for; at my entering his Tent, I &s;aw him &s;eated on a Che&s;t, with a cock'd Pi&s;tol on his right Thigh; ob&s;erving this, I de&s;ir'd
<PB N="75" REF="007859_0107_102DDB15F7E02F18">Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> who was the Mate he always re|ly'd on for Navigation, to tell the Captain I did not think proper to come before a cock'd Pi&s;tol: Notwith&s;tanding I was arm'd, I drew back, altho' I had my Pi&s;tol cock'd, and there were &s;everal Men near me arm'd with Mu&s;|kets. The Captain's per&s;onal Bravery no Man doubted of; his Courage was exce&s;&s;ive, and made him ra&s;h and de&s;perate; his &s;hoot|ing Mr. <HI>Cozens</HI> was a fatal Proof of it; he was grown more de&s;perate by this unhappy Action, and was ob&s;erv'd &s;ince &s;eldom to be|have him&s;elf with any Compo&s;ure of Mind. It is a Piece of human Prudence to retreat from a Man in a Phrenzy, becau&s;e he who does not value his own Life, has another Man's in his Power. I had no De&s;ire of fall|ing by the Hand of Captain <HI>Cheap,</HI> and &s;hould be greatly di&s;turb'd to be compell'd, for my own Pre&s;ervation, to di&s;charge a Pi&s;tol at a Gentleman again&s;t whom I never had any Spleen, and who was my Command|er. When Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> acquainted him with what I de&s;ired him, the Captain threw his Pi&s;tol a&s;ide, and came out of his Tent; he told the People, he would go with them to the Southward; he de&s;ired to know their Grievances, and he would redre&s;s them: They
<PB N="76" REF="007859_0108_102DDB183B1ADFE8">all call'd out for their Sea-Store of Provi&s;ions to be &s;ecur'd, and the re&s;t equally divided. Here the Captain &s;how'd all the Conduct and Courage imaginable; he was a &s;ingle Man again&s;t a Multitude, all of 'em di&s;&s;atisfy'd with him, and all of 'em in Arms: He told 'em the ill Con&s;equence of &s;haring the Provi|&s;ions, that it was living To-day and &s;tarving To-morrow; but the People were not to be &s;atisfy'd, the Officers had now no Authority over 'em, and they were &s;ome Time deaf to their Per&s;ua&s;ions; nay, it was with Difficulty that they could di&s;&s;uade 'em from pulling down the Store-Tent, and taking away the Provi&s;ions by Force; they remov'd the Pro|vi&s;ions out of the Store-Tent, then fell to digging a Hole to bury the Brandy; the Sea-Store to be &s;ecur'd, the remainder to be im|mediately &s;har'd. Had this been comply'd with, the Con&s;equences might have been very terrible: However, to pacify 'em in &s;ome Shape, it was agreed, that every Man &s;hould have a Pint of Brandy <HI>per</HI> Day, which, by Calculation, would la&s;t 'em three Weeks. On this they &s;eem'd very ea&s;y, and went to their re&s;pective Tents. The Captain told his Officers, that he would act nothing contrary to what was agreed on for the Welfare and
<PB N="77" REF="007859_0109_102DDB19DE90A560">Safety of the Community. Finding the Cap|tain in a Temper of Mind to hearken to rea&s;on, I &s;aid to him, Sir, I think it my Duty to inform you, that I am not the Per|&s;on whom you imagine to be the Principal in this Affair. The Captain an&s;wer'd, How can I think otherwi&s;e? I reply'd, Sir, the Paper I read to you was your Lieutenant's Projec|tion: There &s;its the Gentleman, let him di&s;|own it, if he can. The Captain turning him|&s;elf to the Lieutenant, &s;ays, Mr. <HI>Bulkeley</HI> has hone&s;tly clear'd him&s;elf. We then drank a Gla&s;s of Wine, and took our Leaves. At Night the Captain &s;ent for Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> and me to &s;up with him; we were the only Offi|cers pre&s;ent with him: When I was &s;eated, I &s;aid, Sir, I have my Character at Stake, for drawing back from your cock'd Pi&s;tol: Had I advanc'd, one of us mu&s;t have dropt.</P>
<P>Captain an&s;wer'd, <HI>Bulkeley,</HI> I do a&s;&s;ure you, the Pi&s;tol was not de&s;ign'd for you, but for another; for I knew the Whole before. We then talk'd of indifferent Things, and &s;pent the Evening in a very affable Manner.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 29th, came here five <HI>Indian</HI> Canoes, loaden with Mu&s;&s;els; Men, Women and Children were about fifty: The&s;e <HI>In|dians</HI> had never been with us before; they
<PB N="78" REF="007859_0110_102DDB1BE3455F88">are not &s;o generous and good natur'd as our Friends I have already mention'd; they were &s;o mercenary, that they would not part with a &s;ingle Mu&s;&s;el without &s;omething in Ex|change; their Stay was but &s;hort with us, for the next Morning they launch'd their Ca|noes and went off.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day, September</HI> the 1&s;t, the Carpenter was &s;hot in the Thigh with &s;everal large Pewter Sluggs by the Captain's Cook; but he being at a great Di&s;tance, the Sluggs did not enter his Skin: Whether this was de&s;ign'd, or accidental, we don't know; however, we thought it proper to di&s;arm him.</P>

<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 4th, &s;ome Di&s;orders among the People about watching the Provi&s;ions, &s;ome taking all Opportunities to rob the Stores. Our Living now is very hard; Shell-fi&s;h are

<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 6th, la&s;t Night the Store-Tent was robbed of Brandy and Flour: The People at hearing of this were greatly enraged, and in&s;i&s;t on &s;earching the Marines Tents; on Search they found four Bottles of Brandy, and four &s;mall Parcels of Flour. The Captain &s;ent for the Lieutenant, Ma&s;ter, Gunner, Carpenter, and Surgeon, with Lieu|tenants <HI>Hamilton, Ewers,</HI> and <HI>Fielding,</HI> of the Army; Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI> was al&s;o &s;ent for, but was &s;o ill that he could not be pre|&s;ent, but de&s;ir'd all might pa&s;s according to the Judgment of the above-mentioned Offi|cers. A Con&s;ultation was held: Five of the accus'd Marines did not appear, dreading the Puni&s;hment due to their Crime; they march'd off to the De&s;erters: Four more, who &s;taid to be try'd, receiv'd Sentence, on the fir&s;t Opportunity, to carry them off to the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, and there to &s;hift for them&s;elves with the former De&s;erters.

<P>The next Day, the above mention'd added one more to their Number, <HI>viz.

<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 10th, hard Gales at W. N. W. with rain and Hail. The Captain &s;ent for the Lieutenant, Ma&s;ter, my&s;elf, the Carpen|ter, and Boat&s;wain: When we were all met, the Captain a&s;k'd us, if <HI>Pla&s;tow</HI> had men|tion'd any Thing to us about going off in the Yawl. We told him he had. <HI>Pla&s;tow</HI> being &s;ent for, the Captain &s;aid, <HI>Peter!</HI> I hear you are for going in the Boat. He an&s;wer'd, Yes, Sir; I will take my Chance, for I want to get to <HI>England.</HI> The Captain bade him be gone for a Villain, and &s;aid no more. This <HI>Pla&s;tow</HI> was a mighty Favourite with the Captain, and had often been admitted to his Conver&s;ation: He above all Men ought to

It was this Day agreed, that the Sentence put off on the 6th &s;hould be executed the fir&s;t Opportunity, without any Delay; and that no Boat &s;hould go off from hence before all was ready, believing &s;ome have a De&s;ign to go to the Northward.</P>

<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 14th, la&s;t Night very hard Gales at N. and W. N. W. with large Showers of Hail, with Thunder. The Wind To-day is much abated. As to the Article of Provi&s;ions, nothing comes ami&s;s; we eat Dogs, rats, and, in &s;hort, every Thing we can come at.</P>

<HI>Friday</HI> the 18th, <HI>Dennis O'Lary</HI> and <HI>John Redwood,</HI> Seamen, with &s;ix Marines, were put off to the Main, according to their Sen|tence; it being a fine Summer's Day. This Day the Lieutenant, bringing a Pair of Pi&s;|tols to the Carpenter, and complaining they were in bad Order, did not imagine they were loaded, &s;napping the fir&s;t it mi&s;s'd Fire, the &s;econd went off, but providentially did no Harm, tho' the Lieutenant had then a Crowd of People about him.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 20th, little Wind, and clear Weather. Launch'd the Barge, and went off to the Wreck; we took up four Ca&s;ks of Beef, with a Ca&s;k of Pea&s;e, which was &s;tav'd; we &s;erv'd out to each Man five Pieces of Beef, and Pea&s;e to &s;uch as would have 'em, but there were none to take 'em, ha|ving now Plenty of Meat, our Stomachs are become nice and dainty.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 23d, the People went to the Captain with a Two Gallon Cagg, and a&s;k'd it full of Wine: The Captain refus'd 'em; but apprehending that they would make no Ceremony of filling it without Leave, and carrying it off by Force, he thought proper to order it to be fill'd: They brought it to the Long-Boat, and drank it in her Hold.

Six <HI>Indian</HI> Canoes likewi&s;e came in our Ab&s;ence loaded with Men, Women and Children; they brought with them Clams out of the Shells &s;trung on Lines: The <HI>In|dian</HI> Women dived for Mu&s;&s;els, and brought them a&s;hore in abundance; the Men went to the fre&s;h Water river, and caught &s;everal Fi&s;h like our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mullets. The People bought Dogs of the <HI>Indians,</HI> which they kill'd, and eat, e&s;teeming the Fle&s;h very good Food: The next Day the <HI>Indians</HI> went out and caught a va&s;t Quantity of Fi&s;h out of a Pond, where they &s;ent in their Dogs to hunt;
<PB N="85" REF="007859_0117_102DDB2AB478A9B8">the Dogs dived, and drove the Fi&s;h a&s;hore in great Numbers, to one Part of the Pond, as if they had been drawn in a Seyne: the <HI>In|dians</HI> &s;old the Fi&s;h to the People. This Me|thod of catching Fi&s;h is, I believe, unknown any where el&s;e, and was very &s;urpri&s;ing; and, what is al&s;o very &s;trange, after the <HI>Indians</HI> went away, we hauled the Seyne over the Pond, and could never get a Fi&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 28th, returned with the Barge; the fir&s;t Evening we were out we had a good Harbour for the Barge, which we put into; the fir&s;t Animal we &s;aw was a fine large Bitch, big with Puppies; we killed her; we then roa&s;ted one Side, and boiled the other, were exceeding well plea&s;ed with our Fare, &s;upped heartily, and &s;lept well: The next Morning we got up at Day-breaking, and proceeded on our Cruize, finding all along the Coa&s;t to be very dangerous; at Evening put into a Place of very good Shelter for the Barge: Here we found the <HI>Indians</HI> had been very lately, the Shore being covered with the Offals of Seal: In an Hour's Time we killed ten wild Fowl; we roa&s;ted three Gee&s;e and two Ducks, the re&s;t we put into a Sea Pye, &s;o that we fared mo&s;t elegantly; got up at Day-light next Morning, but &s;eeing the

S. W. right over an Inlet of Land, about two Miles. After landing, lived as we did la&s;t Night; in the Morning we walked over, where we found a deep Bay, it being eighteen Leagues deep, and twelve Leagues broad; here we had a very good Pro&s;pect of the Coa&s;t; we found here the green Pea&s;e that Sir <HI>John Nar|borough</HI> mentions in his Book.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 3d of <HI>October,</HI> after our re|turn from the Cruize, the Lieutenant, the Ma&s;ter, my&s;elf, the Boat&s;wain, and Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> the Mate, went to the Captain, to acquaint him how forward the Boat was, and to con&s;ult &s;ome Mea&s;ures to be ob&s;erv'd on board the Boat, to prevent Mutiny; he de&s;ir'd a Day or two to con&s;ider of it.</P>

<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 8th, this Day the Ma&s;ter went to the Captain concerning ten half Bar|rels of Powder more than can be carried off, which will make good Water-Ca&s;ks for the Boats: The Captain told him not to &s;tart the Powder, or de&s;troy any Thing without his Orders; and &s;aid, he mu&s;t have Time to con&s;ider of it.

This Evening the Carpenter went up to the Hill-Tent, &s;o cal|led from its Situation; the People were &s;hooting Balls at Marks; &s;ome of 'em were firing in Vollies, without Shot or Sluggs: One of the Men on the Beach fir'd at the Tent while the Carpenter was in it, who was &s;tanding with a Book in his Hand; there was a Piece of Beef hung clo&s;e at his Cheek, the Ball went through the Tent and the Beef, but the Carpenter receiv'd no Damage.

I de&s;ired him to acquaint the Captain with my Intention; that &s;ince he had no re|gard for the Publick Good, or to any Thing that tending to promoting it, the Carpenter and I had determin'd never to go near him again. The Lieutenant declin'd going, fear|ing the Captain would murder him; but he
<PB N="90" REF="007859_0122_102DDB35A4F2C938">&s;ent the Ma&s;ter to him, to let him know the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;tarting the Powder: The Cap|tain's An&s;wer to the Ma&s;ter was, I de&s;ire you will not de&s;troy any one Thing without my Orders. We now are convinc'd the Cap|tain hath no Intention of going to the South|ward, notwith&s;tanding he had lately given his Word and Honour that he would; there|fore Captain <HI>Pemberton,</HI> in order to put an End to all future Ob&s;tructions, demanded our A&s;&s;i&s;tance to make him a Pri&s;oner for the &s;hooting Mr. <HI>Cozens,</HI> intending to carry him as &s;uch to <HI>England;</HI> at the &s;ame Time to confine Lieutenant <HI>Hamilton</HI> with him: which was readily agreed to by the whole Body. It was reckon'd dangerous to &s;uffer the Cap|tain any longer to enjoy Liberty; therefore the Lieutenant, Gunner, Carpenter, and Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> the Mate, re&s;olv'd next Morning to &s;urprize him in his Bed.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 9th, this Morning went in a Body and &s;urpriz'd the Captain in Bed, di&s;|arm'd him, and took every Thing out of his Tent. The Captain &s;aid to the Seamen, what are you about? Where are my Offi|cers? At which the Ma&s;ter, Gunner, Car|penter, and Boat&s;wain, went in. The Cap|tain, &s;aid, Gentlemen, do you know what
<PB N="91" REF="007859_0123_102DDB37E4CFFB10">you have done, or are about? He was an|&s;wer'd, Yes, Sir, our A&s;&s;i&s;tance was demanded by Captain <HI>Pemberton,</HI> to &s;ecure you as a Pri|&s;oner for the Death of Mr. <HI>Cozens;</HI> and as we are Subjects of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> we are oblig'd to take you as &s;uch to <HI>England.</HI> The Captain &s;aid, Gentlemen, Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI> hath nothing to do with me; I am your Commander &s;till; I will &s;hew you my In|&s;tructions; which he did to the People; on this we came out. He then call'd his Officers a &s;econd Time, and &s;aid, What is this for? He was an&s;wer'd, as before, That A&s;&s;i&s;tance was demanded by Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI> to take him Pri&s;oner for the Death of Mr. <HI>Cozens.</HI> He &s;till in&s;i&s;ted, Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI> has no Bu|&s;ine&s;s with me; I could not think you would &s;erve me &s;o. It was told him, Sir, it is your own Fault: you have given your&s;elf no man|ner of Concern, for the Publick Good, on our going from hence; but have acted quite the rever&s;e, or el&s;e been &s;o carele&s;s and indifferent about it, as if we had no Com|mander; and if other Per&s;ons had given them|&s;elves no more Trouble and Concern than you have, we &s;hould not be ready to go from hence as long as Provi&s;ions la&s;ted. The Captain &s;aid, Very well, Gentlemen, you have
<PB N="92" REF="007859_0124_102DDB3A275D4158">caught me Napping; I do not &s;ee any of you in Liquor; you are a Parcel of brave Fel|lows, but my Officers are Scoundrels: Then turning him&s;elf to me, he &s;aid, Gunner, where's my Lieutenant? Did not he Head You? I told him, No, Sir; but was here to &s;ee it executed, and is here now. One of you (&s;ays the Captain) call Mr. <HI>Beans.</HI> When Mr. <HI>Beans</HI> came, he &s;aid, What is all this for, Sir? Sir, it is Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI>'s Order. Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI> hath no Bu&s;ine&s;s with me, and you will an&s;wer for it here|after; if I do not live to &s;ee <HI>England,</HI> I hope &s;ome of my Friends will. On this the Lieu|tenant left him. The Captain then addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to the Seamen, &s;aying, My Lads, I do not blame you; but it is the Villany of my Officers, which they will an&s;wer for here|after. He then call'd Mr. <HI>Beans</HI> again, and &s;aid, Well, Sir, what do you de&s;ign to do by me? The Lieutenant an&s;wer'd, Sir, your Officers have de&s;ign'd the Pur&s;er's Tent for you. Hum! I &s;hould be obliged to the Gentlemen, if they would let me &s;tay in my own Tent. The Lieutenant came to acquaint the Officers of the Captain's reque&s;t; but they judg'd it inconvenient; as Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Tent join'd the Pur&s;er's, one Guard might &s;erve
<PB N="93" REF="007859_0125_102DDB3BC45413F8">'em both; accordingly all his Things were mov'd to the Pur&s;er's Tent: As he was com|ing along, he &s;aid, Gentlemen, you mu&s;t excu&s;e my not pulling my Hat off, my Hands are confin'd. Well, Captain <HI>Beans!</HI> you will be call'd to an Account for this here|after. The Boat&s;wain, after the Captain's Confinement, mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly in&s;ulted him, reproaching him with &s;triking him, &s;aying, Then it was your Time; but now, G&mdash;d d&mdash;n you, it is mine. The Captain made no reply but this, You are a Scoundrel for u&s;ing a Gentleman ill when he is a Pri&s;oner. When the Captain was a Pri&s;oner, he de|clared, he never intended to go to the South|ward, having more Honour than to turn his Back on his Enemies; and farther, he &s;aid, Gentlemen, I do not want to go off in any of your Craft; for I never de&s;ign'd to go for <HI>England,</HI> and would rather chu&s;e to be &s;hot by you; there is not a &s;ingle Man on the Beach dare engage me; but this is what I fear'd.</P>
<P>It is very odd, that Capt. <HI>Cheap</HI> &s;hould now declare he never intended to go to the South|ward, when he publickly gave his Word and Honour he would go that Way, or any Way where the Spirit of the People led: But he
<PB N="94" REF="007859_0126_102DDB3E08F17978">afterwards told his Officers, he knew he had a &s;evere Trial to go through, if ever he came to <HI>England;</HI> and as for tho&s;e who liv'd to return to their Country, the only Favour he reque&s;ted from them, was to declare the Truth, without Favour or Prejudice; and this we promis'd faithfully to do: His Words, in this re&s;pect, were as much regarded by us as the Words of a dying Man, and have been mo&s;t punctually ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 10th, little Wind at N. and N. W. Getting all ready for going off this Afternoon, the Captain &s;ent for the Lieu|tenant and me, de&s;iring us both to go to Captain <HI>Pemberton,</HI> to know what he intended to do with him. We accordingly came, and both promis'd to go directly, and bring him his An&s;wer. When we came out, went to the Lieutenant's Tent; from thence I ex|pected, and made no doubt, but he would go to Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI>'s: But when I a&s;k'd him; he refus'd; which very much &s;urpriz'd me. I thought it very ungenerous to triflle with Captain <HI>Cheap,</HI> or any Gentleman in his unhappy Situation; therefore went alone to Captain <HI>Pemberton.</HI> When I deliver'd him Captain <HI>Cheap</HI>'s Me&s;&s;age, the An&s;wer was, I de&s;ign, and mu&s;t carry him Pri&s;oner to
<PB N="95" REF="007859_0127_102DDB4053BCC7B8"><HI>England.</HI> I return'd, and acquainted Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> with Captain <HI>Pemberton</HI>'s An&s;wer: He ask'd me then, if the Lieutenant was with me. I told him, No; and I believe did not de&s;ign it. He &s;aid, Mr. <HI>Bulkeley,</HI> I am very much oblig'd to you, and could not think the Lieutenant would u&s;e me thus. In the Evening the Lieutenant and I were &s;ent for again: The Captain &s;aid to the Lieutenant, Sir, have you been with Captain <HI>Pemberton?</HI> He an&s;wer'd, No, Sir. I thought, Sir, you promis'd me you would: However, I have his An&s;wer from Mr. <HI>Bulkeley;</HI> I am to be carry'd a Pri&s;oner to <HI>England.</HI> Gentlemen, I &s;hall never live to &s;ee <HI>England,</HI> but die by Inches in the Voyage; and it is &s;urprizing to me to think, what you can expect by going to the Southward, where there are ten Thou|&s;and Difficulties to be encounter'd with: I am &s;orry &s;o many brave Fellows &s;hould be led to go where they are not acquainted, when, by going to the Northward, there is the I&s;land of <HI>Chili,</HI> not above ninety Leagues, where we need not fear taking Prizes, and may have a Chance to &s;ee the Commodore. I made An&s;wer, Sir, you have &s;aid, that we &s;hall be call'd to an Account for this in <HI>Eng|land:</HI> I mu&s;t tell you, for my Part, had I
<PB N="96" REF="007859_0128_102DDB4244146348">been guilty of any Crime, and was &s;ure of being hang'd for it in <HI>England,</HI> I would make it my Choice to go there, &s;ooner than to the Northward: Have not you given your Word and Honour to go to the South|ward? It is true, there is a Chance in going to the Northward, by delivering us from this unhappy Situation of Life to a wor&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pri&s;on. The Captain &s;aid no more but this, Gentlemen, I wi&s;h you well, and &s;afe to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 11th, this Morning the Cap|tain &s;ent for me, and told me, he had rather be &s;hot than carried off a Pri&s;oner, and that he would not go off with us; therefore de|&s;ired me to ask the People to &s;uffer him to remain on the I&s;land: The People readily agreed to his reque&s;t; and al&s;o con&s;ented to leave him all Things needful for his Support, as much as could be &s;par'd. Lieutenant <HI>Hamilton</HI> and the Surgeon cho&s;e to &s;tay with him. We offer'd him al&s;o the Barge and Yawl, if he could procure Men to go with him. The Que&s;tion was propos'd before the whole Body; but they all cry'd aloud for <HI>England,</HI> and let him &s;tay and be d&mdash;n'd; does he want to carry us to Pri&s;on? There is not a Man will go. The Captain being
<PB N="97" REF="007859_0129_102DDB43DE9B24E0">depriv'd of his Command in the Manner above-mentioned, and for the rea&s;ons already given, it was re&s;olv'd to draw &s;ome Articles to be &s;ign'd for the Good of the Community, and to give the Lieutenant a limited Com|mand. The Paper was drawn up in this Manner:</P>
<P>WHereas Captain <HI>David Cheap,</HI> our Commander in his Maje&s;ty's Ship the <HI>Wager,</HI> never con&s;ulted any of his Officers for the Safety and Pre&s;ervation of the &s;aid Ship, and his Maje&s;ty's Subjects thereto be|longing; but &s;everal Times, &s;ince the un|happy Lo&s;s of the &s;aid Ship, he has been &s;o|licited in the mo&s;t dutiful Manner, promi|&s;ing him at the &s;ame Time to &s;upport his Command with our Lives, de&s;iring no more than to go off Heart in Hand from this Place to the Southward, which he gave his Word and Honour to do; and being almo&s;t ready for &s;ailing, did apply to him, &s;ome few Days pa&s;t, to draw up &s;ome proper Articles, in order to &s;uppre&s;s Mutiny, and other material Things, which were thought nece&s;&s;ary to be agreed to before we went off; but he, in the mo&s;t &s;cornful Manner, hath rejected every Thing propos'd for the Publick Good; and
<PB N="98" REF="007859_0130_102DDB45CF72AE70">as he is now a Pri&s;oner, and the Command given to the Lieutenant, upon his Approba|tion of the following Articles.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As we have no Conveniency for dre&s;&s;ing Provi&s;ions on Board the Ve&s;&s;el for a third Part of the Number to be carried off the Spot, therefore this Day &s;erv'd ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to every Man and Boy twelve Days Provi&s;ion, for them to dre&s;s before we go off; and al&s;o it is agreed, that whoever is guilty of de|frauding another of any Part of his Allow|ance, on &s;ufficient Proof thereof, the Per&s;on found guilty (without any re&s;pect of Per|&s;on) &s;hall be put on Shore at the fir&s;t con|venient Place, and left there.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> In regard to the Boats going off with us, we think proper to allow one Week's Provi&s;ion for each Man appointed to go in them, in order to prevent Separation from each other, which would be of the wor&s;t Con&s;equence of any Thing that can happen to us; to prevent which we do agree, that when under-way they &s;hall not &s;eparate, but always keep within Musket-&s;hot, and on no Pretence or Excu&s;e what&s;oever go beyond that reach. The Officer, or any other Per|&s;on, that &s;hall attempt a Separation, or ex|ceed
<PB N="99" REF="007859_0131_102DDB48333A51A0">the above mention'd Bounds, &s;hall, on Proof, be put on &s;hore and left behind.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> It is agreed, in order to &s;uppre&s;s Mutiny, and prevent Broils and Quarrels on Board the Ve&s;&s;el, that no Man &s;hall threaten the Life of another, or offer Violence in any Shape; the Offender, without any re&s;pect of Station or Quality, being found guilty, &s;hall be put on Shore, and left behind.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> We do agree, whatever Fowl, Fi&s;h, or Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, we &s;hall hap|pen to meet with in our Pa&s;&s;age, the &s;ame &s;hall be divided among the whole; and if Captain <HI>David Cheap</HI> &s;hall be put on Board a Pri&s;oner, it &s;hall not be in the Lieutenant's Power to relea&s;e him.</P>
<P>The afore&s;aid Articles were agreed to, and &s;ign'd by the under-mentioned.

<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 15th, This Morning, it being Calm, made a Signal for the Boats to come off, by firing five Mu&s;kets. At Day-light came to Sail, with the Wind at W. by N. It blowing hard, and a great Swell, the Ve&s;&s;el would not work; therefore we were oblig'd to put into a &s;mall Bay, lying S. W. of <HI>Harvey</HI>'s Bay, where we had a very good Shelter, there being a large Ledge of rocks without us, which broke the Sea off. At Eleven we &s;ent the Barge to <HI>Cheap</HI>'s Bay for what Canva&s;s could be found &s;erviceable, having left a &s;ufficient Quantity behind, to &s;upply us with Sails, in Ca&s;e we wanted 'em. Went in the Barge the Hon. <HI>John Byron,</HI> at his own reque&s;t, <HI>Alexander Campbell</HI> Mid|&s;hipman, <HI>William Harvey</HI> Quarter-Gunner, <HI>David Buckley</HI> ditto, <HI>William Ro&s;e</HI> Quarter-Ma&s;ter, <HI>Richard Noble</HI> ditto, <HI>Peter Pla&s;tow</HI> Captain's Steward, <HI>Jo&s;eph Clinch</HI> Seaman, and <HI>Rowland Cru&s;&s;et</HI> Marine. This Afternoon the Carpenter want a&s;hore in the Cutter, with
<PB N="109" REF="007859_0141_102DDB5BF08EB1D0">&s;everal of the People, to look for Proven|der. Shot &s;everal Gee&s;e, and other Sea-Fowl; rainy Weather. Wind W. N. W.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 16th, continual rain, and hard Gales all Night at S. W. This Morning the Carpenter came on Board, and acquainted us that he &s;aw an Anchor of &s;even Feet in the Shank, the Palm of each Arm filed off ju&s;t above the Crown: This Anchor we &s;uppo&s;e to have belong'd to &s;ome &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el wreck'd on the Coa&s;t. The Cutter brought off Abun|dance of Shell-fi&s;h ready dre&s;s'd for the People.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 18th, at Noon, the Cutter came off, and brought aboard Plenty of Shell-fi&s;h and Greens. The Honourable Mr. <HI>Byron</HI> Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> and three of the Barge's Crew, came from where the Barge lay. Mr. <HI>Byron</HI> came aboard, and inform'd us of the Barge's being &s;afe in the Bay, where we left her, and only waited the Opportunity of Weather to come round with her: At the &s;ame Time he de&s;ired to know, if we would give him, and tho&s;e who would &s;tay with Captain <HI>Cheap,</HI> their Share of Provi&s;ions. This Que&s;tion of Mr. <HI>Byron</HI>'s very much &s;urpriz'd us; and what &s;urpriz'd us more was, that he &s;hould be influenc'd by Mr. <HI>Campbell,</HI> a Per&s;on whom he always held in Contempt. As for my
<PB N="110" REF="007859_0142_102DDB5EA5EBC768">Part, believe Mr. <HI>Byron</HI> left us becau&s;e he could not get any Accomodation aboard the Ve&s;&s;el that he lik'd, being oblig'd to lie forward with the Men; as were al&s;o the Carpenter and my&s;elf, when below: It is very certain, that we are &s;o clo&s;ely pent up for want of room, that the wor&s;t Jail in <HI>England</HI> is a Palace to our pre&s;ent Situation.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 20th, &s;erv'd out to the People eight Days Flour, to be dre&s;s'd a&s;hore. I went in the Cutter to Command in my Turn for a Week.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 21&s;t, clo&s;e Weather; the Wind from W. to N. W. with rain and Hail. Brought aboard Shell-fi&s;h in abun|dance. At Noon the Honourable Mr. <HI>Byron</HI> came with &s;ome of the Crew Over-land; he a&s;k'd me, whether the Boat's Crew were gone off, and if we had &s;erv'd the Provi&s;ion, for he wanted to return to the Barge. I told him all the People were out a Fi&s;hing, and that the fir&s;t who came in &s;hould carry him off. On which he &s;aid, I think we will go and get &s;ome Fi&s;h too, having nothing el&s;e to live on. This was the la&s;t Time I ever &s;aw his Honour. When the People return'd from fi&s;hing, they told me Mr. <HI>Byron</HI> had lo&s;t his Hat, the Wind blowing it off his Head,
<PB N="111" REF="007859_0143_102DDB60E8E29D20">I &s;aid, rather than he &s;hould want a Hat, I would give him my own. One of the Sea|men forced a Hat on his Head; his Name was <HI>John Duck:</HI> But Mr. <HI>Byron</HI> would by no Means wear it; &s;aying, <HI>John!</HI> I thank you; if I accept of your Kindne&s;s, you mu&s;t go bare-headed; and, I think, I can bear Hard&s;hips as well as the be&s;t of you, and mu&s;t u&s;e my&s;elf to them. I took eight Peo|ple, and went over Land to the Place where the Barge lay, to get the Canva&s;s that we &s;tood &s;o much in Need of; but found &s;he was gone from thence. The People in the Barge told our Men, that they would return to us again; but it is plain they never intended it.</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 22d, This Day we &s;aw Sea-Fowl in va&s;t Flocks flying to the Southward, where was a dead Whale. Look'd out all this Day for the Barge, but to no Purpo&s;e. The Barge not returning was a very great Misfortune, having no Boat but the Cutter; and if by an unlucky Accident we lo&s;e her, we mu&s;t be reduced to the greate&s;t Extremi|ties to get Provi&s;ion. The Per&s;ons in the Barge, except the Captain's Steward, always approv'd of going to the Southward; but it &s;eems Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> the Patroon prevail'd on 'em to return to Captain <HI>Cheap.</HI></P>

<HI>Friday</HI> the 23d, Saw Thou&s;ands of Sea-Fowl; in the Morning they fly to the North|ward, and in the Evening come back to the South; they are Birds of a very large Size, but of what Kind we do not know. Since we have been here we &s;aw &s;everal <HI>Indian</HI> Graves; they are dug ju&s;t within the Surface of the Earth, with a Board on each Side, and a Cro&s;s &s;tuck up at the Head. The Day following a Gun, a four Pounder, was &s;een near the Anchor in <HI>Clam</HI> Bay; we call it by this Name, becau&s;e of the va&s;t Quantities of this Sort of Shell-fi&s;h which are found there.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the 26th, it being very calm, and fair Weather, I went a&s;hore to bring off the People; weigh'd the Long-Boat, and took her in Tow over a Bar, where was ten Feet Water, but a great Swell; as &s;oon we got over the Bar, there &s;prung up a Breeze of Wind at N. W. &s;teer'd away S. half E. for the Southmo&s;t Part of Land, which bore S. by E. di&s;tant fourteen Leagues. The two Points of Land make a large and deep &s;andy Bay; we &s;ounded, but found no Ground; it is a bold Shore clo&s;e to. I kept a-head in the Cutter, in order to provide a Harbour for the Long-Boat; Providence directed us to a very good one: It blew &s;o hard, with thick
<PB N="113" REF="007859_0145_102DDB6460DD48C8">hazy Weather, that we could not keep the Sea. At Eight at Night we anchor'd in eight Fathom Water a-brea&s;t of a fine &s;andy Bay, and Land lock'd not above three Boats Length from the Shores: At the Entrance of the Harbour, which lies about a League up the <HI>Lagoon,</HI> I &s;et the Land; the Northmo&s;t Point bore by the Compa&s;s N. by E. di&s;tant twelve Leagues, and the Southmo&s;t S. by W. di&s;tant five Leagues, the Entrance lies E.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 27th, Fre&s;h Gales at W. and cloudy Weather, with a great Swell without, in&s;omuch that we could not put out to Sea; we therefore &s;ent the People a&s;hore to dre&s;s their Provi&s;ions: each Man is allow'd but a Quarter of a Pound of Flour <HI>per</HI> Day, without any other Sub&s;i&s;tence, but what Pro|vidence brings in our Way.</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 29th, Early this Morning, it being calm and thick Weather, with &s;mall rain, we rowed out of the <HI>Lagoon;</HI> at Five it cleared up, with a fre&s;h Breeze at S. S.

We &s;teer'd in E. and found the Opening to be a large <HI>Lagoon,</HI> on the Southmo&s;t Side, running into a very good Harbour; here our &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el lay &s;ecure in a Cove, which Nature had form'd like a Dock; we had no Occa&s;ion to let go an An|chor, but ran along-&s;ide the Land, and made fa&s;t our Head and Stern.

Several of the People have de&s;ired to be put on Shore, de&s;iring us to allow them &s;ome few Nece&s;&s;aries: We wanted to know what could induce them to reque&s;t our putting them a&s;hore in this re|mote and de&s;olate Part of the World: They an&s;wer'd, they did not fear doing well, and

I never in my Life, in any Part of the World, have &s;een &s;uch a Sea as runs here; we expected every Wave to &s;wallow us, and the Boat to founder. This Shore is full of &s;mall I&s;lands, rocks and Breakers; &s;o that we can't haul further to the South|ward, for fear of endangering the Boat; we are oblig'd to keep her right before the Sea. At Five broach'd to, at which we all be|liev'd &s;he would never ri&s;e again. We were &s;urrounded with rocks, and &s;o near that a Man might to&s;s a Bi&s;ket on them: We had
<PB N="129" REF="007859_0161_102DDB85A3815330">nothing but Death before our Eyes, and every Moment expected our Fate. It blew a Hurricane of Wind, with thick rainy Wea|ther, that we could not &s;ee twice the Boat's Length; we pray'd earne&s;tly for its clearing up, for nothing el&s;e could &s;ave us from pe|ri&s;hing; we no &s;ooner a&s;k'd for Light, but it was granted us from above. At the Weather's clearing up, we &s;aw the Land on the North-Shore, with I&s;lands, Rocks, and Breakers all around us; we were obliged to put in among 'em for Shelter, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to keep the Sea; we were in with the Land among&s;t them, and compell'd to pu&s;h thro', looking Death in the Face, and expecting every Sea to bury us; the bolde&s;t Men among us were di&s;may'd, nor can we po&s;&s;ibly give an Account in what Manner we have been this Day deliver'd. After &s;ailing amid&s;t I&s;lands, rocks, and Breakers, for above a League, we got &s;afe into a good Harbour, &s;urrounded with &s;mall I&s;lands, which kept the Sea off; here the Water was as &s;mooth as in a Mill-pond.

<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 11th, The Wind much abated, with rain. This Morning weigh'd and ran farther in.

We would not &s;uffer above two Men to go a&s;hore, and tho&s;e di&s;arm'd, le&s;t we &s;hould put them in Fear. The <HI>Indians</HI> had nothing in their Hands but a Club, like to our Cricket-Batts, with which they kill their Seal.

The two <HI>Indians</HI> got into the Canoe, and put her off the Shore before we could get nigh them; as &s;oon as we got a-brea&s;t of the Canoe, they made Signs as if they wanted Cloathing; we en|deavour'd to make them under&s;tand we wanted Fi&s;h, and would truck with them; they had none, but &s;ignified to us they would go and get &s;ome: They had a mangey Dog, which they parted with to one of the People for a Pair of Cloth Trow&s;ers; this Dog was &s;oon kill'd, dre&s;s'd, and devour'd.

<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 24th, This Morning, it being calm, row'd out; at Eight o'Clock had the &s;uppo&s;ed right <HI>Streights</HI> open, having a Breeze at W. N. W. S. E. by E. through the fir&s;t reach, and S. S. E. through the &s;econd; then &s;aw three I&s;lands, the large&s;t of which lies

Steer'd a|way for the I&s;land S. E. about two Leagues; then came into a narrow Pa&s;&s;age, not a|bove a Cable's Length over, which put us all to a &s;tand, doubting of any farther Pa&s;|&s;age. The Wind took us a-head, and the Tide being &s;pent, we put into a &s;mall Cove, and made fa&s;t. At Seven in the Evening, being calm, ca&s;t loo&s;e, being willing to &s;ee if there was any Opening; but, to our great Misfortune, found none; which very much &s;urpriz'd us.

I told him, as for a Chart, we had none of any kind; but I had a good Ob&s;ervation the Day before, that our Ve&s;&s;el drew but a &s;mall Draught of Water; that we kept the Lead always going, and in the Nece&s;&s;ity we were in, we were oblig'd, at all Events, to ven|ture; and if we had not &s;een the Opening of the river before Night, we mu&s;t have been compell'd to run the Ve&s;&s;el a&s;hore. He ex|amin'd me al&s;o concerning the Places we &s;topt at, from Cape <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> to this Port, and more particularly relating to the river <HI>Plate.</HI> He was very nice in his Enquiry of our put|ting in at Cape St. <HI>Mary's,</HI> and of the Bear|ings and Di&s;tance along Shore from thence to this Port. When he throughly &s;atisfy'd him|&s;elf, he embraced us, and ble&s;t him&s;elf to think of our Deliverance, which he term'd a Miracle. He offer'd every Thing the Coun|try could afford to our relief; the Sick were order'd to be taken Care of in the Ho&s;pital. He took the Lieutenant and the Land Offi|cers home with him; and de&s;ired the Com|mandant to &s;ee that the re&s;t of the Officers and People wanted for nothing. Before he went he inform'd us, that his Maje&s;ty's Ships
<PB N="172" REF="007859_0204_102DDBD5346698B8">the <HI>Severn</HI> and <HI>Pearl</HI> were at <HI>Rio Janeiro,</HI> in great Di&s;tre&s;s; that they had &s;ent to <HI>England</HI> for Men, and could not &s;ail from thence until the Arrival of the <HI>Flota,</HI> which would be in <HI>May</HI> or <HI>June.</HI> He al&s;o told us, that we &s;hould be di&s;patch'd in the fir&s;t Ve&s;&s;el which arriv'd in this Port; for he did not think we could with Safety go any farther in our own; and that there could not be found twelve Seamen in the <HI>Brazils</HI> that would venture over the Bar in her to &s;ail to <HI>Rio Janeiro;</HI> therefore he order'd our little <HI>Speedwell</HI> a&s;hore; this Wonder the People are continually flocking to &s;ee: and it is now about nine Months &s;ince we were ca&s;t away in the <HI>Wager;</HI> in which Time, I believe, no Mortals have experienc'd more Difficulties and Mi&s;eries than we have. This Day may be ju&s;tly &s;tiled the Day of our Deliverance, and ought to be remember'd ac|cordingly.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 31&s;t, Little or nothing remark|able &s;ince the Day we came in, only a won|derful Change in our Diet; we live on the be&s;t the Country can produce, and have Plenty of every Thing. This Afternoon the Governor, Commandant, and Commi&s;&s;ary, came on Board, to &s;ee our little <HI>Speedwell;</HI> they were &s;urpriz'd that thirty Souls, the
<PB N="173" REF="007859_0205_102DDBD6DDE2AE38">Number of People now living, could be &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow'd in &s;o &s;mall a Ve&s;&s;el; but that &s;he could contain the Number which fir&s;t embark'd with us, was to them amazing, and beyond all Belief: They could not conceive how the Man at Helm could &s;teer without falling over-board, there not being above four Inches ri&s;e from the Deck. I told them he &s;at down, and clap'd his Feet again&s;t the ri&s;e; and &s;how'd them in what Manner we &s;ecured our&s;elves. The Governor, after viewing the Ve&s;&s;el over, told us, we were more welcome to him in the mi&s;erable Condition we arriv'd, than if we had brought all the Wealth in the World with us. At the &s;ame Time he fully a&s;&s;ur'd us, we &s;hould be &s;upply'd with every Thing that the Country could afford; that he would di&s;patch us the fir&s;t Opportunity to <HI>Rio Janeiro;</HI> and whenever we &s;tood in Need of any Thing, he order'd us to acquaint the Commandant, and our Wants &s;hould be in|&s;tantly &s;upply'd. He then took Leave of us, and wi&s;h'd us well. All the Deference and dutiful re&s;pect we could &s;how him, to ex|pre&s;s a grateful Sen&s;e of his Favour, was by manning the Ve&s;&s;el, and giving him three Cheers. The next Day arriv'd at this Place the Brigadier-Governor of the I&s;land St. <HI>Ca|tharine;</HI>
<PB N="174" REF="007859_0206_102DDBD89AD36A98">he came clo&s;e by our Ve&s;&s;el, we mann'd her, and gave him three Cheers. The Soldiers of the Garri&s;on, having twenty Months Arrears due to them, expected the Brigadier was come to pay them; but when they found them&s;elves di&s;appointed, they made a great Di&s;turbance among them&s;elves. I apply'd to the Commandant for a Hou&s;e, the Ve&s;&s;el, in rainy Weather, not being fit to lie in; he order'd me one joining to his own, and gave me the Key. I took with me Mr. <HI>Cummins,</HI> Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> Mr. <HI>Snow,</HI> Mr. <HI>Oakley,</HI> and the Cooper; we brought our trifling Nece&s;&s;aries on Shore, and remov'd to our new Habitation: Here we were dry and warm; and tho' we had no Bedding, we lodg'd very comfortably. Since the Lo&s;s of the <HI>Wager,</HI> we have been u&s;ed to lie hard; at pre&s;ent we think our&s;elves very happily fix'd, and heartily wi&s;h that all the Per&s;ons who &s;urviv'd the Lo&s;s of the Ship were in &s;o good a Situation as our&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day, February</HI> the 2d, 1741-2, Great Murmurings among the Soldiers; they de|tain'd the Brigadier from going back as he intended this Morning, till he promis'd to di&s;patch the Money, Cloaths, and Provi&s;ions, and to &s;ee their Grievances adju&s;ted. On
<PB N="175" REF="007859_0207_102DDBDB4F9C8178">tho&s;e Terms they have agreed he &s;hall go; and this Evening he return'd for St. <HI>Catha|rine</HI>'s. We apprehended, till now, that the right Officers were in Place; but we find our&s;elves mi&s;taken. Some Time before we arrived here, there was an In&s;urrection among the Soldiers: Their De&s;ign was again&s;t the Governor; but by his Addre&s;s, and fair Pro|mi&s;es of &s;eeing them righted, he diverted the Storm from him&s;elf, and got him&s;elf conti|nued in his Station; as were al&s;o the Major and Commi&s;&s;ary. The Soldiers di&s;mi&s;s'd the re&s;t of the Officers, and &s;upply'd their Places with their own People, tho' they were lately private Men; they appear'd very grand, and were not di&s;tingui&s;h'd in Dre&s;s from the pro|per Officers. The Di&s;turbance at <HI>Rio Grand</HI> is of no Service to us, for we feel the Effects of it; our Allowance is now &s;o &s;mall that it will hardly &s;upport Nature; the People have been without <HI>Farina,</HI> which is their Bread, for &s;ome Days pa&s;t. We apply'd to the Go|vernor, who promis'd to &s;upply us the next Day; accordingly we went for a Supply, which created fre&s;h Murmurings among the Soldiers; however we got a &s;mall Quantity of Bread to &s;upply us for ten Days. The Store-keeper &s;how'd me all the Provi&s;ions,
<PB N="176" REF="007859_0208_102DDBDD3A8BA008">which, con&s;idering there were a thou&s;and to draw their Sub&s;i&s;tence from it, was a &s;mall Stock indeed, and not above &s;ix Weeks at the pre&s;ent Allowance. He told me we were &s;erv'd equally with the Soldiers; and when more Stores came, which they &s;hortly ex|pected, our Allowance &s;hould be encreas'd. I think, in rea&s;on, this is as much as we can expect. The Lieutenant not coming nigh us &s;ince our fir&s;t landing, I went with the Peo|ple up to him at the Governor's, about two Miles from this Port, to endeavour to pre|vail with him to get us di&s;patch'd, acquaint|ing him of the Call and Nece&s;&s;ity there was for our A&s;&s;i&s;tance on Board the two di&s;tre&s;s'd Ships at <HI>Rio Janeiro.</HI> He &s;aid he had &s;poke to the Governor, and could not get us di&s;|patch'd till another Ve&s;&s;el came in. I told him, as the Garri&s;on were in want of Pro|vi&s;ions, what we were living on here, would carry us off; and if any Misfortune &s;hould attend the Ve&s;&s;el expected in with the Provi|&s;ions, we &s;hould be put very hard to it for a Sub&s;i&s;tence. He promis'd to acquaint the Governor; on which I took my Leave.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> the 17th, This Evening came into this Garri&s;on three Seamen, giving an Account of their belonging to a Ve&s;&s;el with
<PB N="177" REF="007859_0209_102DDBDF30B60050">Provi&s;ions and Stores for this Place, from <HI>Rio Janeiro;</HI> that they had been from thence three Months, and had been off the Bar waiting an Opportunity to come in; that not having any fre&s;h Water aboard, they were oblig'd to come to an Anchor ten Leagues to the Southward of this Port; that a Canoe was &s;ent with tho&s;e three Men to fill the Water, but the Wind coming in from the Sea, and blowing hard, oblig'd the Ve&s;&s;el to put to Sea, and leave them a&s;hore, from whence they travelled here, and believ'd the Ve&s;&s;el was gone to St. <HI>Catharine</HI>'s. The Governor, not &s;atisfy'd with their report, took them for Spies, and kept them as &s;uch. However, in a Day or two afterwards, he di&s;patch'd a Pilot and two Seamen for the I&s;land St. <HI>Ca|tharine,</HI> to bring the Ve&s;&s;el round, in Ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould be there.</P>
<P>I took this Opportunity of &s;ending a Let|ter by them to the Honourable Capt. <HI>Murray,</HI> Commander of his Maje&s;ty's Ship the <HI>Pearl,</HI> at <HI>Rio Janeiro;</HI> de&s;iring them to order it to be di&s;patch'd by the fir&s;t Ship from St. <HI>Ca|tharine</HI>'s to the <HI>Rio Janeiro.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 20th, La&s;t Night the three Seamen which came here, as mention'd be|fore, with five more of this Place, attempted to run away with one of the large Boats; but they were pur&s;u'd and taken: Their De|&s;ign was for the river <HI>Plate,</HI> the Wind then favouring them. This is evident, that the Governor was right in his Conjecture, and did not &s;u&s;pect them wrongfully; they are now Pri&s;oners in the Guard-Hou&s;e. The next Morning I went to the Lieutenant, de|&s;iring him to apply to the Governor for a Pa&s;s and Hor&s;es for my&s;elf, Mr. <HI>Cummins,</HI> and <HI>John Young,</HI> to go by Land to St. <HI>Catha|rine</HI>'s and St. <HI>Franci&s;co;</HI> where we need not doubt of a Pa&s;&s;age to his Maje&s;ty's di&s;tre&s;s'd Ships at <HI>Rio Janeiro:</HI> That it was our Duty to ha&s;ten to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance: That he, the Lieutenant, ought, the very Day after our Arrival into this Port, without any regard
<PB N="181" REF="007859_0213_102DDBE8E5B38128">to Expence and Charges, to have di&s;patch'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;pecial Me&s;&s;enger by Land; and then we might have been a&s;&s;ured of a Ve&s;&s;el before now. The Lieutenant an&s;wer'd, he had a Thought of enquiring at fir&s;t coming about what I had mention'd, and of going him&s;elf, tho' it co&s;t him fifty Pounds; but he was in|form'd it was impo&s;&s;ible to go by Land. I a&s;k'd him, if &s;o, how came the Brigadier from St. <HI>Catharine</HI>'s here? And how do Peo|ple weekly go from hence thither? As for Fatigue or Trouble, whoever undertook to go, he mu&s;t expect that; but there was no Hard&s;hip to be encounter'd comparable to what we had already undergone. We lay here on Expence to the King, without doing any Service, and run the Hazard of not only lo&s;ing the Opportunity of getting on Board our own Ships, but perhaps of mi&s;&s;ing the <HI>Flota,</HI> and of wintering here; therefore I beg'd he would entreat the Governor to let us have Hor&s;es and Guides; which he pro|mis'd to mention to the Governor at Dinner, and &s;end me his An&s;wer in the Afternoon without fail. I waited with Impatience for this An&s;wer; but the Lieutenant failing in his Promi&s;e, was the Occa&s;ion of my &s;ending him this Letter.</P>

The Meaning of which I believe is owing to you, by the endeavour|ing, through the Per&s;ua&s;ions of the Per&s;ons you confide in, to blacken us, and in &s;o vile a Manner, that you &s;eem unacquainted with the ill Con&s;equence, which may attend the touching a Man's Character.

If I am not mi&s;taken, you told me that what we were &s;upply'd with here, was a Bounty flowing from the

If they &s;hould revolt at this Juncture, we &s;hall &s;tand a very bad Chance. I mu&s;t acquaint you, Sir, the Ve&s;&s;el we came in, is not &s;o much out of repair, but that, if you can get Canvas out of the Store for Sails, we can make 'em, and get ready for &s;ailing in ten Days Time. And if the Ve&s;&s;el expected here with Supplies comes in a &s;horter Time, our Ve&s;&s;el will be ready fix'd for the U&s;e of the Governor; and if one Ve&s;&s;el &s;hould not be large enough to carry us all off, we can go in Company. I imagine you know of the Stores being robb'd, and the Di&s;turbance among the Soldiers, which mu&s;t occa&s;ion Unea&s;ine&s;s enough, without repeating Griev|ances, where relief is not to be had.

This Day we are re&s;olv'd to go by Land, if the Governor will only allow us a Guide; we acquainted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Lieutenant with our re&s;olution; he went with me and Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> to the Governor; we obtain'd Leave to go, with the Promi&s;e of a Guide. Captain <HI>Pemberton,</HI> being at the Gover|nor's, de&s;ired to go with us; the Governor told him the Journey was &s;o difficult and tedious, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for him to encounter with it.

<P><HI>March</HI> the 9th, This Morning Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> went over with me to the North Side, to make an Agreement for &s;ix People to go to St. <HI>Ca|tharine</HI>'s; while we were here, the Governor received Letters from St. <HI>Catharine</HI>'s, which gave an Account of four Ve&s;&s;els on their Pa&s;&s;age for this Port; on the News of this we put by our Journey: It was very lucky we had not &s;et out on this Journey before we heard the News: For on the nineteenth the Ve&s;&s;els from <HI>Rio Janeiro</HI> arrived, and brought an Account that the <HI>Severn</HI> and <HI>Pearl</HI> were &s;ail'd from thence for the I&s;land of <HI>Barbadoes.</HI> Tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els not only brought the Soldiers Provi&s;ions, but al&s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Pardon.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="007859_0218_102DDBF402390BC8">
On the 20th, The Brigadier arriv'd, and had all the Soldiers drawn up, where their Pardon was read to them: He ac|quainted them with what Money was come, which was not above a third Part of their Arrears, but the remainder was on the Pa&s;&s;age. The Money he had for them &s;hould be paid directly as far as it would go, if they would take it; but they cry'd out with one Voice, The Whole or none; and a great Di&s;turbance there was, &s;ome were for revolting to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;ome began to change their Notes, and were for taking Part of the Money, and the re&s;t in&s;i&s;ted upon the Whole. To quell this Di&s;turbance, the Commandant, whom they look'd upon more than the Brigadier, or the Governor, u&s;ed his utmo&s;t Endeavours. They told the Commandant they were no longer Soldiers than while they were in the King's Pay, and let tho&s;e who are for the King, draw off one Way by them&s;elves; you are our Commander, we tru&s;t in you to an&s;wer for us, what you do we will &s;tand by with our Lives: On which the Commandant deliver'd his Command up, &s;houldering his Firelock, and took the Place of a common Soldier, telling

I left the Lieutenant, and went with Mr. <HI>Cummins,</HI> Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> Mr. <HI>Snow,</HI> Mr. <HI>King,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Oakley</HI> to the Governor, to obtain leave for our going; the Lieutenant follow'd us, and &s;aid, but one half could go at a time. The Governor told us it was order'd that the Land Officers, my&s;elf and the re&s;t that apply'd to go by Land, &s;hould be the fir&s;t di&s;patch'd, and might go on board when we would; but as the Ve&s;&s;el did not belong to the King, we mu&s;t buy Provi&s;ions, and pay for our Pa&s;&s;age. I &s;aid, Sir, we have not Money to an&s;wer the Expence: He then a&s;k'd me whether I had not &s;everal Times apply'd to him for Leave to go by Land at my own Charges? I an&s;wer'd, we were oblig'd to di&s;po&s;e of our Watches to rai&s;e that Money, which will barely be &s;uf|ficient to carry us &s;ix off that intended to go by Land, therefore what mu&s;t become of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t who have not a &s;ingle Penny?

<PB N="189" REF="007859_0221_102DDBFB9D2A56D0">his Subjects, di&s;tre&s;s'd in this Manner, five Vintins <HI>per</HI> Day to each Man for Sub&s;i&s;tence. On my &s;aying this, the Governor call'd the Commi&s;&s;ary and Major; he walk'd and talk'd with them a&s;ide; then came back again, and told us the Account was &s;o &s;mall, that it was not worth charging the King of <HI>England</HI> with it; therefore we mu&s;t buy our own Provi|&s;ions, and pay our Pa&s;&s;age; and as to what we had receiv'd from them, we were wel|come; upon which we thank'd them, and came away. We then con&s;ulted with the Lieutenant, to know what could be done with the People; and that as the Ve&s;&s;el we came in was not fit to proceed in any farther, it was to no Purpo&s;e to leave her there; therefore we de&s;ired his con&s;ent to &s;ell her, believing the Money &s;he would bring, would be &s;ufficient to carry us all off. To this Pro|po&s;al the Lieutenant con&s;ented. We then apply'd to the Ma&s;ter of the Ve&s;&s;el, to know what he would have for our Pa&s;&s;age; his De|mand was forty Shillings <HI>per</HI> Man; of which we acquainted the Lieutenant, who told us he could not &s;ee what we could do, and, on &s;econd Con&s;ideration, would not give his Con&s;ent to &s;ell the Boat; for, when &s;old, he did not think &s;he would fetch the Money.
<PB N="190" REF="007859_0222_102DDBFEB3B70380">Tho&s;e Words of the Lieutenant put us all to a Stand, e&s;pecially after he had but now given his Con&s;ent to &s;ell her; and in &s;o &s;hort Time to declare the rever&s;e, was very odd; tho' indeed it did not much &s;urprize us, be|cau&s;e this Gentleman was never known to be over &s;tedfa&s;t to his Word. Seeing no Po&s;&s;i|bility of carrying he People off without &s;el|ling the Boat, I told the Lieutenant, if he left them behind, I could not think but &s;o many of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects were &s;old; and believ'd he had made a Pre&s;ent of the Ve&s;&s;el to the Governor. At this the Lieute|nant paus'd for a while; and then &s;aid, he had not Money to carry him&s;elf off without &s;elling his Coat. I reply'd, there was no Occa&s;ion for that, when he had a Gold Watch. The next Morning went to the Lieutenant again about our going off; he acquainted us, that the Brigadier had order'd Things in ano|ther Manner; that myfelf, and nine more, being the Per&s;ons di&s;irous of going, &s;hould be di&s;patch'd in the fir&s;t Ve&s;&s;el, and every Thing found us; that he, the Lieutenant, was to tarry behind with the re&s;t of the Peo|ple, and to come in the next Ve&s;&s;el, an E&s;ti|mate of the Charges being made out; and al&s;o he told us, he had a &s;evere Check for
<PB N="191" REF="007859_0223_102DDC006D3F5BD8">reque&s;ting to go fir&s;t him&s;elf, and offering to leave the People behind.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, March</HI> 28, I embark'd on Board the St. <HI>Catharine</HI>'s Brigantine, with the Car|penter, Boat&s;wain, the two Mates, the Sur|geon of Marines, the Cooper, and &s;ix of the People; the Provi&s;ions laid in for us were two Ca&s;ks of Salt Beef, and ten Alcadoes of <HI>Farina.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 31&s;t, we &s;ail'd for <HI>Rio Ja|neiro,</HI> with the Wind at W. &s;teer'd S. E. and S. E. by E. until over the Bar; then E. by N. and E. N. E. with a fine Gale and clear Wea|ther; there is not above two Fathom and half Water on the Bar at High-Water; when you are in, it is a fine commodious Harbour for &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els; it is a low Land of a &s;andy Soil: Here is Abundance of fine Cattle; with Fre&s;h-water Fi&s;h, Melon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> exceeding good, Plenty of Water, and the be&s;t Milk I ever ta&s;ted.</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day, April</HI> the 8th, Little Wind at S. W. and fair Weather. At ten this Morn|ing anchor'd before the Town of St. <HI>Seba&s;tians.</HI> The <HI>Portugueze</HI> Pilots, who have been in <HI>England,</HI> call the Land here the <HI>I&s;le of Wight;</HI> and indeed it is very like it, tho' not &s;o large, being only eight Miles in Length. This is a
<PB N="192" REF="007859_0224_102DDC034E2EC878">very &s;ecure Harbour for Shipping; a Stranger may go in or out without any Difficulty. At this Place I was a&s;hore, and think it as de|lightful and plea&s;ant a Place as ever I &s;aw in <HI>America;</HI> abounding with Fruit, as Oranges, Lemons, Bonano's; al&s;o with Yams, Pota|toes, Fi&s;h and Fowl.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 10th, Sail'd from St. <HI>Seba&s;ti|ans;</HI> little Wind at S. W. &s;teer'd out S. E. between the I&s;land and the Main; and at Eight in the Morning, on the <HI>Monday</HI> follow|ing, we anchor'd before the City of <HI>Rio Ja|neiro.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 13th, This Morning we were all order'd before the Governor. A <HI>Dutch</HI> Surgeon was &s;ent for, who &s;poke very good <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> After an Enquiry into our Misfor|tunes, the Governor order'd him to be our Con&s;ul; telling us, that we &s;hould have a convenient Hou&s;e, with Firing, and eight Vintins a Man <HI>per</HI> Day Sub&s;i&s;tence-Money: He al&s;o de&s;ir'd we might make no Di&s;turbance among our&s;elves; which we promis'd to avoid. A Nobleman went with the Con&s;ul to look out for our Habitation; they fix'd on a large magnificent Hou&s;e, fit for a Per&s;on of Qua|lity. This being the fir&s;t Day of our coming a&s;hore, they were pleas'd to order a Dinner,
<PB N="193" REF="007859_0225_102DDC0543A33A88">and Supper out of Doors, and &s;ent us where we were to eat all together. This was the fir&s;t Time of the Boat&s;wain's eating with the re&s;t of the Officers &s;ince we left <HI>Cheap</HI> I&s;land. The Con&s;ul was &s;o kind as to &s;end us a Ta|ble, Benches, Water Pots, and &s;everal u&s;eful Things, from his own Hou&s;e; we thought our&s;elves very happily &s;eated.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 14th, This Morning the Con&s;ul went with the Officers and People to the Trea&s;ury for our Money. Mr. <HI>Oakley,</HI> Surgeon of his Maje&s;ty's Land Forces, was de&s;ired by the Con&s;ul to &s;ign for it. The Boat&s;wain, who now look'd upon him&s;elf as our Captain, was not a little di&s;pleas'd at this. When the Money was received, the Con&s;ul would have given it the Surgeon to pay us; but he excus'd him&s;elf, telling the Con&s;ul the Boat&s;wain was a trouble&s;ome Man, and it might occa&s;ion a Di&s;turbance; on which the Con&s;ul was &s;o good as to come and pay it him&s;elf. Being all together, he told us the Governor had order'd us eight Vintins a Man <HI>per</HI> Day; but at the &s;ame Time had made a Di&s;tinction between the Officers and Seamen; that the Money re|ceived was to be paid in the Manner follow|ing, <HI>viz.</HI> to the Seamen &s;ix Vintins <HI>per</HI> Man,
<PB N="194" REF="007859_0226_102DDC0742193370">and the Officers ten. The rea&s;on of this Di&s;tinction was, that the Seamen could go to work, and get Money by their Labour; when the Officers could not, but mu&s;t be obliged to live entirely on their Allowance. This Di&s;tinction cau&s;ed great Unea&s;ine&s;s, the Boat&s;wain in&s;i&s;ting that the People had a right to an equal Share with us. The Offi|cers, willing to make all Things ea&s;y, de&s;ir'd the Con&s;ul it might be &s;o. The Con&s;ul re|ply'd, the Money &s;hould be di&s;pos'd of ac|cording to the Governor's Direction, or not at all. The Boat&s;wain then objected again&s;t the Cooper, becau&s;e he was no Office<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. The Con&s;ul &s;aid, Ma&s;ter! I believe the Cooper to be a very good quiet Man, and I dare &s;ay will take it as the Men do; but &s;ooner than this be an Objection, I will pay the Money out of my own Pocket. The Boat&s;wain then began at me, abu&s;ing me in a very &s;canda|lous and abominable Manner; &s;aying, among other Things; that the Cooper was got among the re&s;t of the Pirates, for &s;o he term'd me and the re&s;t of the Officers. When the Mo|ney was paid, we acquainted the Con&s;ul, that we had, till now, been &s;eparated from the Boat&s;wain; that he was of &s;o perver&s;e and turbulent a Temper, and &s;o abu&s;ive in Speech,
<PB N="195" REF="007859_0227_102DDC09B35382D8">that we could not bear with him. The Boat&s;wain then cho&s;e to be with the People, and gave us the Preference of the Fore|room, where we de&s;ired to be by our&s;elves. There were two Doors to our room; we look'd both of them, and went to take a Walk in the Country: At our return in the Evening, we found the Doors broke open, and a &s;mall Sword belonging to me was bro|ken an Inch off the Point, and the Scabbard all in Pieces. The Boat&s;wain had in his room an <HI>Iri&s;hman,</HI> whom he &s;ent in on Pur|po&s;e to quarrel with us. This <HI>Iri&s;hman</HI> and <HI>Richard Ea&s;t,</HI> one of our own People, fell upon the Cooper and me: <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> cho&s;e to en|gage with me; he &s;truck me &s;everal Times; he compell'd me to &s;tand in my own Defence, and I &s;oon ma&s;ter'd him. During this Quar|rel the Carpenter call'd the Guards; at Sight of whom the <HI>Iri&s;hman</HI> made his E&s;cape. I de&s;ir'd the Guards to &s;ecure <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> a Pri&s;oner, but the Officer told me he could not, unle&s;s I would go to Pri&s;on with him. I told him it was my de&s;ire, and accordingly I went. The Pri&s;on was in the Governor's Hou&s;e. I had not been there but a few Minutes before the Governor &s;ent for me; he enquired of the Officer concerning the Di&s;turbance, and or|der'd
<PB N="196" REF="007859_0228_102DDC0C00FB4438">me to my Habitation; but detain'd <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> a Pri&s;oner. When I came Home I found the Boat&s;wain, and two renegadoes with him, all about the Cooper. On &s;eeing me, he repeated his former abu&s;ive Words. He made us &s;o unea&s;y in our Lodging, that, to prevent Murder, we were oblig'd to lie out of the Hou&s;e. Next Morning Mr. <HI>Oakley</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> went to the Con&s;ul; he came with them to the Hou&s;e, where we were all &s;ent for; he told us it was very &s;trange, that People who had undergone &s;o many Hard&s;hips and Difficulties, could not agree lovingly together. We an&s;wer'd, we never us'd to me&s;s together; and &s;ooner than we would be with the Boat&s;wain, we would make it our Choice to take a Hou&s;e in the Country at our own Expence. The Boat|&s;wain, on hearing this, fell again into his u&s;ual Strain of Slander and abu&s;ive Language, cal|ing us rogues, Villains, and Pirates. It was the Governor's fir&s;t reque&s;t, that we might have no Di&s;turbance among us; yet the Boat|&s;wain hath not &s;uffer'd us to have a quiet Minute &s;ince we have been here. The Con|&s;ul went with us two Miles out of the City, at a &s;i&s;hing Village; where we took a Hou&s;e, at our own Expence, to pay at the rate of
<PB N="197" REF="007859_0229_102DDC0DCB752AA0">ten Shillings <HI>per</HI> Month, there being &s;even of us in all, <HI>viz.</HI> my&s;elf, the Carpenter, Sur|geon, the two Mates, the Cooper, and a Seaman. Here we thought our&s;elves &s;afe and &s;ecure. The next Day, in the After|noon, two of the Boat&s;wain's Friends, which had lately de&s;erted from his Maje&s;ty's Service, and an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Clerk with them, came to pay us a Vi&s;it. They were &s;o impertinent, as not only to enquire into the rea&s;ons of the Di&s;turbance among our&s;elves, but they al&s;o in&s;tructed us in our Duty, telling us, they came from our Commander the Boat&s;wain, with Orders to &s;ee our Journal. I told them the Journal &s;hould not be a Secret to any Per&s;on who could read; but at the &s;ame Time I would never part with it to be copied out: They then drank a Gla&s;s of Punch with us and left us. This is a Place that a Man is oblig'd &s;ometimes to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be u&s;ed ill; if he re&s;ents all Affronts, he runs a great Hazard of lo&s;ing his Life; for here ruf|fians are to be hired at a &s;mall Expence; and there is no Place in the World where People will commit Murder at &s;o cheap a rate. Be|tween Nine and Ten at Night, three People, came to our Door; one of which knock'd, telling us that he was the Per&s;on that was
<PB N="198" REF="007859_0230_102DDC10314B3F58">with me and the Cooper in the Afternoon. Being apprehen&s;ive that they came with no good Intent, we refus'd opening the Door; telling them, that it was an improper Sea&s;on of the Night, and that we did not know they had any Bu&s;ine&s;s with us; if they had, we told them to come in the Morning: But they &s;till in&s;i&s;ted upon the Door being open'd; &s;aying, it would be better to do &s;o, than to be taken away in three Hours Time. When they had &s;aid this, they went away. We did not know the Meaning of their Words, but imagin'd they were gone to bring &s;ome A&s;&s;o|ciates to be&s;et the Hou&s;e; having nothing to defend our&s;elves with, we got over the Back-Wall of the Hou&s;e, and took to the Country for Safety: In the Morning apply'd to the Con&s;ul, who remov'd us to a Hou&s;e in the Mid&s;t of the Village; he gave an Account to the Inhabitants of the De&s;ign the Boat&s;wain had form'd again&s;t us, either to compel us to deliver up the Journal, or to take our Lives; he therefore de&s;ired that the Journal and Pa|pers might be depo&s;ited in the Hands of a Neighbour there, till the Time of our going off. The People of the Place offer'd to &s;tand by us with their Lives, in Oppo&s;ition to any
<PB N="199" REF="007859_0231_102DDC12C65B4DD8">Per&s;ons who &s;hould attempt to do us an In|jury.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> the 18th, Early this Morning we were &s;ent for to the Con&s;ul. He &s;aid to us, Gentlemen, as the Lives of three of you are in Danger, and I don't know what Villany your Boat&s;wain may be capable of acting, in regard to your Peace and Safety; I'll endea|vour to get you three on Board a Ship bound for <HI>Bahia</HI> and <HI>Li&s;bon;</HI> accordingly he went to the Captain of the Ship, who con&s;ented that we &s;hould go with him, on the&s;e Con|ditions, that the Governor would give us a Pa&s;s, and that we would work for our Pa&s;|&s;age; this we agreed to: After this we re|que&s;ted the Governor for a Pa&s;s, which he was &s;o good as to grant, and is as follows.</P>

<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 21&s;t, Early this Morning the Captain came on Board; on &s;eeing us, he a&s;k'd us, How we came on Board without his Leave? Notwith&s;tanding he gave Leave to the Con&s;ul for our Pa&s;&s;age, we ought to have waited on him a&s;hore. There was on Board the Ship a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Don, a Pa&s;&s;enger, who told the Captain no <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> &s;hould go in the &s;ame Ship with him; therefore de|&s;ired we might be turn'd a&s;hore; but the Captain in&s;i&s;ted upon doing what he pleas'd aboard his own Ship, and would not comply with his reque&s;t. The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Don, when we came to conver&s;e with him, was very much mov'd with the relation of our Mi&s;|fortunes; and &s;aid to us, though our royal Ma&s;ters, the Kings of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> are at War, it was not our Fault; that we were now on Board a Neutral Ship belonging to a King who was a Friend to both Nations;
<PB N="206" REF="007859_0238_102DDC21AEAE7468">that he would not look upon us as Enemies, but do us all the Service he could. He ex|toll'd the Conduct and Bravery of Admiral <HI>Vernon</HI> at <HI>Porto-Bello;</HI> but, above all, ap|plauded him for his Humanity and generous Treatment of his Enemies. He made great Encomiums on the Magnificence of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Fleet, and the Boldne&s;s and Imtrepidity of the Sailors, &s;tiling the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> the <HI>Soldiers of the Sea.</HI> He &s;upplied us in our Pa&s;&s;age not only with Provi&s;ions from his Table, but al&s;o with Wine and Brandy; and during the whole Voyage appear'd &s;o different from an Enemy, that he took all Opportunities of giving us Proofs of his Genero&s;ity and Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 7th of <HI>May</HI> 1742, This Morn|ing anchor'd before the City of <HI>Bahia,</HI> went on Shore to the Vice-roy, &s;hew'd him the Pa&s;s we had from the Governor of <HI>Rio Janeiro:</HI> He told us the Pa&s;s was to di&s;patch us to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and that the fir&s;t Ship which &s;ail'd from hence would be the Ship we came in; we petition'd him for Provi&s;ions, acquainting him of our reception at <HI>Rio Grand,</HI> and <HI>Rio Janeiro,</HI> that we had hitherto been &s;upply'd at the rate of eight Vintins each Man <HI>per</HI> Day. He refu&s;ed &s;upplying us with any Thing; upon which I told him,
<PB N="207" REF="007859_0239_102DDC2453C2CEB0">we had better been Pri&s;oners to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who would allow us Bread and Water, than in a Friend's Country to be &s;tarv'd. The Captain of the Ship we came in, hearing the Vice-roy would not &s;upply us, was &s;o kind as to go with us to him, acquainting him how we were provided for at <HI>Rio Janeiro,</HI> and that he would &s;upply us him&s;elf, if he would &s;ign an Account to &s;atisfy the Con&s;ul General at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> &s;o that he might be reimburs'd. The Vice-roy an&s;wer'd, he had no Orders concerning the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that he had Letters from the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> his Ma&s;ter to &s;upply the <HI>French,</HI> but had no Orders about any other Nation, and if he gave us any thing, it mu&s;t be out of his own Pocket, therefore he would not &s;upply us; The Captain then told him that we were Officers and Subjects to the King of <HI>England,</HI> and in Di&s;tre&s;s; that we did not want great Matters, only barely enough to &s;upport Life, and begg'd that he would allow but four Vintins <HI>per</HI> Day, being but half the Sum hitherto allow'd us. The Cap|tain's Intreaties avail'd nothing, the Vice-roy continuing as fix'd in his re&s;olution of giving us no relief; I don't believe there

<P>Since our being here, we have been in|form'd of one of his Maje&s;ty's Ships with three Store-Ships being arriv'd at <HI>Rio Ja|neiro,</HI> &s;upply'd with Stores and Men for the relief and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Severn</HI> and <HI>Pearl</HI> (which were &s;ail'd before in <HI>January</HI> la&s;t for <HI>Barbadoes)</HI> and that our People were
<PB N="212" REF="007859_0244_102DDC2E23184C78">gone on board of them, and bound for the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>Here is a very good Bay for Ships to ride in, with the Wind from the E. S. E. to the Northward and We&s;tward back to the S. W. and Wind to the Southward, which blows in, and makes a very great Sea. At the Ea&s;t Side coming in, &s;tandeth <HI>Point de Gloria,</HI> where is a very large Forti|fication, with a Tower in the mid&s;t; from this Point the Land ri&s;es gradually; about a League from hence is the City of <HI>Bahia;</HI> it is &s;urrounded with Fortifications and equally capable of defending it again&s;t any Attempts from the Sea or Lands.</P>
<P>Provi&s;ions her of all kinds are exce&s;&s;ive dear, e&s;pecially Fi&s;h, this we impute to the great Number of Whales that come into this Bay, even where the Ships lie at Anchor; the Whale Boats go off and kill &s;ometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">even or eight Whales in a Day. The Fle&s;h of which is out up in &s;mall Pieces, then brought to the Market Place, and &s;old at the rate of a Vintin <HI>per</HI> Pound; it looks very much like coar&s;e Beef, but inferior to it in Ta&s;te. The Whales here are not at all equal in Size to the Whales in <HI>Green|land,</HI> being not larger than the Grampus.
<PB N="213" REF="007859_0245_102DDC2FCDE7F3A8">After living here above four Months with|out any relief from the Governor or the Inhabitants, who behaved to us as if they were under a Combination to &s;tarve us, we embark'd on board the St. <HI>Tubes</HI> with our good Friend the Captain who brought us from <HI>Rio Janeiro;</HI> we &s;ail'd from <HI>Bahia</HI> the 11th of <HI>September</HI> for <HI>Lisbon,</HI> in Company with one of the King of <HI>Portugal</HI>'s Ships of War, and two <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ships; but the St. <HI>Tubas</HI> not being able to &s;ail &s;o well as the other Ships, lo&s;t &s;ight of them the fir&s;t Night. About 70 Leagues from the We&s;tward of <HI>Madeira,</HI> we bent a new Fore&s;ail; within two or three Days afterwards, we had a very hard Gale of Wind, &s;cudding under the Fore&s;ail, and no Danger happening to the Ship during this Gale. When the Wind had ceas'd, and we had fair Weather, the Captain, after the Evening Ma&s;s, made an Oration to the People, telling them that their Deli|verance from Danger in the la&s;t Gale of Wind, and that the Ship though leaky mak|ing no more Water than before, was owing to their Prayers to <HI>Nue&s;tra Senhora Boa Mortua</HI> and her Interce&s;&s;ion. That in Gra|titude they ought to make an Acknowledg|ment to that Saint for &s;tanding their Friend
<PB N="214" REF="007859_0246_102DDC31E14DF0A0">in time of Need. That he him&s;elf would &s;hew the Example by giving the new Fore|&s;ail, which was bent to the Yard, to the Saint their Deliverer; accordingly one of the Seamen went forward and mark'd out the&s;e Words on the Sail, <HI>Deal e&s;ta Trinckado pour no&s;tra Senhora Boa mortua</HI> (which is as much as to &s;ay) <HI>I give this Fore&s;ail to our Saint the Deliverer from Death.</HI> The Sail and Money collected on this Occa&s;ion amount|ed to upwards of twenty Moidores.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday</HI> the 23d of <HI>November,</HI> in the Latitude 39: 17 North, and Longitude 6: 00 W. that Day at Noon the <HI>Rock</HI> of <HI>Li&s;bon</HI> bearing S. by W. di&s;tant &s;ixteen Leagues; we &s;teer'd E. S. E. to make the <HI>Rock</HI> before Night. At Four o'Clock it blew a very hard Gale, and right on the Shore; the Ship lay to under a Fore&s;ail with her Head to the Southward; at Six it blew a Storm, the Fore&s;ail &s;plitting, oblig'd us to keep her before the Wind, which was running her right on the Shore. The Ship was now given over for lo&s;t, the People all fell to Prayers, and cry'd out to their Saints for Deliverance, offering all they had in the World for their Lives; and yet at the &s;ame time neglected all Means to &s;ave them&s;elves;
<PB N="215" REF="007859_0247_102DDC34A34480E0">they left off pumping the Ship, though &s;he was exceeding leaky. This Sort of Proceed|ing in time of Extremity is a thing unknown to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seamen; in tho&s;e Emergencies all Hands are employ'd for the Pre&s;ervation of the Ship and People, and, if any of them fall upon their Knees, 'tis after the Danger is over. The Carpenter and my&s;elf could by no Means reli&s;h this Behaviour, we begg'd the People for God's &s;ake to go to the Pumps, telling them we had a Chance of &s;aving our Lives, while we kept the Ship above Water, that we ought not to &s;uffer the Ship to &s;ink, while we could keep her free. The Captain and Officers hearing us pre&s;&s;ing them &s;o earne&s;tly, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t off Prayers, and intreated the Men to keep the Pumps going, accordingly we went to pumping, and pre&s;erv'd our|&s;elves and the Ship: In half an Hour after|wards the Wind &s;hifted to the W. N. W. then the Ship lay South, which would clear the Cour&s;e along Shore had the Wind not &s;hifted; we mu&s;t in an Hour's time have run the Ship a-&s;hore. This Deliverance, as well as the Former, was owing to the Interce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Nue&s;tra Senhora Boa Mortua:</HI> On this Oc|ca&s;ion they collected Fifty Moidores more, and made this pious re&s;olution, that, when
<PB N="216" REF="007859_0248_102DDC3694BA9078">the Ship arriv'd &s;afe at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> the Fore|&s;ail, which was &s;plit in the la&s;t Gale of Wind, &s;hould be carried in Proce&s;&s;ion to the Church of this grand Saint, and the Captain &s;hould there make an Offering equal in Value to the Fore&s;ail, which was reckon'd worth eighteen Moidores.</P>
<P>On <HI>Saturday</HI> the 28th of <HI>November,</HI> we ar|rived at <HI>Lisbon;</HI> and on the next Morning every Per&s;on who came in the Ship, (except|ing the Carpenter, my&s;elf; and the Cooper) Officers, Pa&s;&s;engers, the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Don him&s;elf, and all the People, Men and Boys, walk'd bare-footed, with the Fore-&s;ail in Proce&s;&s;ion, to the Church of <HI>Nue&s;tra Senhora Boa Mor|tua;</HI> the Weather at that Time being very cold, and the Church a good Mile di&s;tant from the Landing-Place. We <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> when we came a&s;hore, went immediately on the <HI>Change.</HI> I was pretty well known to &s;ome Gentlemen of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory. When I inform'd them that we were three of the un|fortunate People that were ca&s;t away in the <HI>Wager,</HI> and that we came here in one of the <HI>Brazil</HI> Ships, and wanted to embrace the fir&s;t Opportunity of going to <HI>England;</HI> they told me, that the Lieutenant had been before us; that he was gone home in the Packet Boat,
<PB N="217" REF="007859_0249_102DDC388BD93FB8">and left us a very indifferent Character. I an&s;wer'd, I believ'd the Lieutenant could give but a very bad Account of him&s;elf, having kept no Journal, nor made any remarks &s;ince the Lo&s;s of the Ship, nor perhaps be|fore; that we doubted not but to acquit our|&s;elves of any fal&s;e Accu&s;ations, having with us a Journal, which gave an impartial re|lation of all our Proceedings. The Journal was read by &s;everal Gentlemen of the Facto|ry, who treated us, during our Stay at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> with exceeding Kindne&s;s and Benevolence.</P>
<P>On the 20th of <HI>December,</HI> we embark'd on Board his Maje&s;ty's Ship the <HI>Stirling-Ca&s;tle</HI> for <HI>England:</HI> Here we had again the Happi|ne&s;s of experiencing the Difference between a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and a Foreign Ship, particularly in regard to Cleanline&s;s, Accomodation, Diet and Di&s;cipline. We met with nothing ma|terial in our Pa&s;&s;age, and arrived at <HI>Spithead</HI> on the 1&s;t of <HI>January,</HI> 1742-3. Here we thought of nothing but going a&s;hore im|mediately to our Families; but were told by the Captain, we mu&s;t not &s;tir out of the Ship till he knew the Plea&s;ure of the Lords of the Admiralty, having already wrote to them con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rning us. This was a very great Affliction to us; and the more &s;o becau&s;e
<PB N="218" REF="007859_0250_102DDC3AA7EC42B8">we thought our Troubles at an End. The Carpenter and my&s;elf were in View of our Habitations; our Families had long given us over for lo&s;t; and, on the News of our Safety, our relatives look'd upon us as Sons, Hu&s;|bands, and Fathers, re&s;tor'd to them in a mi|raculous Manner. Our being detain'd on Board gave them great Anxiety; we endea|vour'd to con&s;ole 'em as well as we could; being a&s;&s;ured, that we had done nothing to offend their Lord&s;hips; that, if Things were not carried on with that Order and regula|rity which is &s;trictly ob&s;erv'd in the Navy, Nece&s;&s;ity drove us out of the common road. Our Ca&s;e was &s;ingular: Since the lo&s;s of the Ship, our chiefe&s;t Concern was for the Pre|&s;ervation of our Lives and Liberties; to ac|compli&s;h which we acted according to the Dictates of Nature, and the be&s;t of our Un|der&s;tanding.</P>

<P>I received for An&s;wer by one of the Me&s;|&s;engers, <Q>That the Journal was our own, and that their Lord&s;hips would have nothing to do with it, &s;o you may do as you will with it.</Q> I thought this An&s;wer was Leave &s;ufficient, on which I went to publi&s;h|ing the Journal, which &s;ome People in the World have condemned me for; had I not wrote to their Lord&s;hips for Leave, they might have blamed me. After publi&s;hing the Work, we were told by many, that we were to be hang'd for Piracy in coming away with the King's Long-boat without the Capt. and al&s;o for mutinying, and not bringing him home with us. There was one great good Man that gave his Judgment in our Favour, &s;o far as to &s;ay, She was not the King's Long-boat; giving the&s;e rea&s;ons: At the fir&s;t

They obey his Orders, go off to the Wreck, &s;aw the Gunnel down, launch the Boat, and bring her on Shore; when there, the Captain orders her to be haul'd up at a proper Place for lengthning; his Or|ders are obey'd; after which he orders the Carpenter to &s;aw her a&s;under; the Carpen|ter goes to work, obeys the Captain's Orders; now, it is to be ob&s;erved, that the Long-boat is in two Parts, and by Capt. <HI>Cheap</HI>'s Orders; by which Orders, he has not only made her u&s;ele&s;s to the whole Body of the People on the I&s;land, but as u&s;ele&s;s to him&s;elf as the Wreck in the Sea, and by his own Orders: But the Carpenter, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the People, have gone into the Woods, out their own Timber, &s;aw'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their own Plank, and brought her into a Po&s;ition of 23 Tun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

After receiving the above, I proceeded for <HI>Plymouth,</HI> there took charge and fix'd the Ship with Jury Ma&s;ts, mu&s;ter'd forty Men, and ten Guns. In the middle of July &s;ail'd in Com|pany with three Sail bound for <HI>London,</HI> the Ma&s;ters whereof engaged with me not to Part Company, being doubtful of falling in with two French Dogger Privateers, which had done a great Deal of Mi&s;chief in the Channel. The next Morning about Six o'Clock, it being little Wind, the <HI>Starts</HI> bearing N.N.W. &s;aw the two Privateers in cha&s;e of three Ships to the S. in about two Hours after they left off their Chace, and haul'd their Wind, in order to &s;peak with us; at which the three Sail be|ing within me, haul'd their Wind in order to run their Ve&s;&s;els on &s;hore: on this I bore down to the Privateers, run the ten Guns out of the &s;tarboard Side, and as &s;oon as with|in Gun &s;hot hoi&s;ted the King's Colours and fired a Shot, which they did not regard, by not hoi&s;ting any Colours; at which I ordered the Men below to get all ready at once to haul all the lower Deck Ports up, by doing which we'll give them to believe we are in a Man of War, and by having Jury Ma&s;ts, will think that we lo&s;t them in an Engagement or bad Weather; as &s;oon as they acquainted me
<PB N="228" REF="007859_0260_102DDC510EB6FF90">they were ready, I order'd them to haul up, and fired another Shot, which had the de&s;ired Effect, for they in&s;tantly hoi&s;ted <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Colours, and tack'd from us; by which Scheme &s;ix Sail of Merchant Ve&s;&s;els were &s;aved from being taken; the Privateers had each a Hundred and Seventeen Men on Board. To the Fact of this I refer to the St. James's Evening Po&s;t, it being publi&s;hed there. In about ten Months after this Captain Cheap arrived in <HI>England</HI> from <HI>France:</HI> The Account he gave of his Proceed|ings, and the Perils and Dangers he went thro' after he was left by us, is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the Long-boat and Cutter were gone, the Captain, and tho&s;e who were left with him, propo&s;ed to pa&s;s to the North|ward in the Barge and Yawl; But the Wea|ther was &s;o bad, and the Difficulty of &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting &s;o great, that it was two Months af|ter the Departure of the Long-boat before he was able to put to Sea. But as it has been already &s;aid, the Place where the <HI>Wager</HI> was ca&s;t away, was not a Part of the Conti|nent, but an I&s;land at &s;ome &s;ome di&s;tance from the Main, which afforded no other Sorts of Provi&s;ion but Shell-fi&s;h, and a few Herbs; and as the greate&s;t Part of what they had
<PB N="229" REF="007859_0261_102DDC52FAE30320">gotten from the Ship was carried off in the Long-boat, the Captain and his People were often in great Nece&s;&s;ity, e&s;pecially as they cho&s;e to pre&s;erve what little Sea-provi&s;ions remained, for their Store when they &s;hould go to the Northward. During their re&s;i|dence at this I&s;land, which was by the Sea|men denominated <HI>Wager's I&s;land,</HI> they had now and then a &s;traggtling Canoe or two of <HI>Indians,</HI> which came and bartered their Fi&s;h and other Provi&s;ions with our People. This was indeed &s;ome little Succour, and at ano|ther Sea&s;on might perhaps have been great|er; for as there were &s;everal <HI>Indian</HI> Huts on the Shore, it was &s;uppo&s;ed that in &s;ome Years, during the height of Summer, ma|ny of the&s;e Savages might re&s;ort thither to fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Upon the 14th of <HI>December,</HI> the Captain and his People embarked in the Barge and the Yawl, in order to proceed to the North|ward, taking on board with them all the Provi&s;ions they could ama&s;s from the Wreck of the Ship; but they had &s;carcely been an Hour at Sea, when the Wind began to blow hard, and the Sea ran &s;o high, that they were obliged to throw the greate&s;t Part of their Provi&s;ions over-board, to avoid im|mediate
<PB N="230" REF="007859_0262_102DDC54E22CE2D8">De&s;truction. This was a terrible Mi&s;|fortune, in a Part of the World where Food is &s;o hard to be got: However, they &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in their De&s;ign, putting on Shore as often as they could to &s;eek Sub&s;i&s;tance. But about a Fortnight after, another dreadful Ac|cident befel them, for the Yawl &s;unk at an Anchor, and one of the Men in her was drown|ed; and as the Barge was incapable of car|rying the whole Company, they were now re|duced to the hard Nece&s;&s;ity of leaving four Marines behind them on that de&s;olate Shore. But they &s;till kept on their Cour&s;e to the Northward, &s;truggling with their Di&s;a&s;ters, and greatly delayed by the Perver&s;ene&s;s of the Winds, and the frequent Interruptions which their Search after Food occa&s;ioned; Till at la&s;t, about the End of <HI>January,</HI> having made three un&s;ucce&s;sful Attempts to double a Head-land, which they &s;uppo&s;ed to be what the <HI>Spaniards</HI> called Cape <HI>Tres Montes,</HI> it was unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to give over this Expe|dition, the Difficulties of which appeared in|&s;uperable, and to return again to <HI>Wager I&s;land,</HI> where they got back about the Middle of <HI>February,</HI> quite di&s;heartned and dejected with their reiterated Di&s;appointments, and almo&s;t peri&s;hing with Hunger and Fatigue.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="007859_0263_102DDC56C3967500">
However, on their return they had the good Luck to meet with &s;everal Pieces of Beef, which had been wa&s;hed out of the Ship, and were &s;wimming in the Sea. This was a mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable relief to them, after the Hard&s;hips they had endured: And to compleat their good Fortune, there came, in a &s;hort Time, two Canoes of <HI>Indians,</HI> a|mong&s;t which was a Native of <HI>Chiloe,</HI> who &s;poke a little <HI>Spani&s;h;</HI> and the Surgeon, who was with Captain <HI>Cheap,</HI> under&s;tanding that Language, he made a Bargain with the <HI>Indi|an,</HI> that if he would carry the Captain and his People to <HI>Chiloe</HI> in the Barge, he &s;hould have her, and all that belonged to her for his Pains. Accordingly, on the 6th of <HI>March,</HI> the eleven Per&s;ons to which the Company was now reduced, embark'd in the Barge on this new Expedition; but after having proceeded for a few Days, the Captain and four of his principal Officers being on Shore, the Six, who together with an <HI>Indian</HI> remain|ed in the Barge, put off with her to Sea, and did not return.</P>
<P>By this Means there were left on Shore Captain <HI>Cheap,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> Lieutenant of Marines, the Honourable Mr. <HI>Byron,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Campbel,</HI> Mid&s;hipmen, and Mr. <HI>Elliot,</HI> the Sur|geon.
<PB N="232" REF="007859_0264_102DDC590C4BE748">One would have thought their Di&s;|tre&s;&s;es had long before this Time been inca|pable of Augmentation; but they found, on reflection, that their pre&s;ent Situation was much more di&s;maying than any Thing they had yet gone through, being left on a de&s;o|late Coa&s;t, without any Provi&s;ion, or the Means of procuring any; for their Arms, Ammunition, and every Conveniency they were Ma&s;ters of, except the tattered Habits they had on, were all carried away in the Barge.</P>
<P>But when they had &s;ufficiently revolved in their own Minds the various Circum&s;tances of this unexpected Calamity, and were per|&s;waded that they had no relief to hope for, they perceived a Canoe at a Di&s;tance, which proved to be that of the <HI>Indian,</HI> who had un|dertaken to carry them to <HI>Chiloe,</HI> he and his Family being then on Board it. He made no Difficulty of coming to them; for it &s;eems he had left Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> and his People a little before to go a fi&s;hing, and had in the mean Time committed them to the Care of the other <HI>Indian,</HI> whom the Sail|ors had carried to Sea in the Barge. But when he found the Barge gone and his Com|panion mi&s;&s;ing, he was extreamly concerned,
<PB N="233" REF="007859_0265_102DDC5B2BFFCB40">and could with Difficulty be per&s;waded that the other <HI>Indian</HI> was not murdered; but, being at la&s;t &s;atisfied with the Account that was given him, he &s;till undertook to carry them to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Settlements, and (as the <HI>Indians</HI> are well &s;killed in fi&s;hing and fowl|ing) to procure them Provi&s;ions by the Way.</P>
<P>About the middle of <HI>March</HI> Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> and the Four that were left with him, &s;et out for <HI>Chiloe,</HI> the <HI>Indian</HI> having procured a Number of Canoes, and gotten many of his Neighbours together for that Purpo&s;e. Soon after they embarked, Mr <HI>Elliot</HI> the Surgeon died, &s;o that there now remained only Four of the whole Company. At la&s;t, after a very complicated Pa&s;&s;age by Land and Water, Captain <HI>Cheap,</HI> Mr. <HI>Byron,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Campbel,</HI> arrived in the Beginning of <HI>June</HI> at the I&s;land of <HI>Chiloe,</HI> where they were received by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with great Humanity; but, on Ac|count of &s;ome Quarrel among the <HI>Indians,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> did not get there till two Months after. Thus, above a Twelvemonth after the Lo&s;s of the <HI>Wager</HI> ended this fatiguing Peregrination, which by a Variety of Misfor|tunes dimini&s;hed the Company from Twen|ty to no more than Four, and tho&s;e too brought &s;o low, that, had their Di&s;tre&s;&s;es con|tinued
<PB N="334" REF="007859_0266_102DDC5D35DA9348">but a few Days longer, in all Proba|bility none of them would have &s;urvive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. For the Captain him&s;elf was with Difficulty recovered; and the re&s;t were &s;o reduced by the Severity of the Weather, their Labour, and their Want of all kinds of Nece&s;&s;aries, that it was wonderful how they &s;upported them&s;elves &s;o long. After &s;ome Stay at <HI>Chiloe,</HI> the Captain and the Three who were &s;ent to <HI>Valparai&s;o,</HI> and thence to St. <HI>Jago,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Chili,</HI> where they conti|nued above a Year: But on the Advice of a Cartel being &s;ettled betwixt <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> Captain <HI>Cheap,</HI> Mr. <HI>Byron,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> were permitted to return to <HI>Europe</HI> on board a <HI>French</HI> Ship. The other Mid&s;hipman, Mr. <HI>Campbel,</HI> having changed his religion, whil&s;t at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> cho&s;e to go back to <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> with <HI>Pizarro</HI> and his Offi|cers, with whom he went afterwards to <HI>Spain</HI> on board the <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> and there having failed in his Endeavours to procure a Commi&s;&s;ion from the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> he returned to <HI>En|gland,</HI> and attempted to get rein&s;tated in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Navy; and has &s;ince publi&s;hed a Narration of his Adventures, in which he complains of the Inju&s;tice that had been done him, and &s;trongly di&s;avows his ever being in

<P>After Capt. <HI>Cheap</HI>'s Arrival as above re|lated, on reading an Adverti&s;ement in the News-Paper, I found there was an Order for all the Officers and People of the <HI>Wa|ger</HI> that were in <HI>England</HI> to repair on board Admiral <HI>Steward,</HI> in order to give their De|po&s;itions in for a Court-Martial, to be held concerning the Lo&s;s of his Maje&s;ty's Ship the <HI>Wager.</HI> I being then in <HI>London,</HI> &s;ent into their Lord&s;hips to acquaint them that on reading the Adverti&s;ement, I was going to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> in order to comply with their Directions. I was an&s;wer'd by one of the Me&s;&s;engers, it was very well. The next Day being on the <HI>Royal-Exchange,</HI> a Gentleman which was one of the Procters of <HI>Doctors-Commons,</HI> a&s;k'd me what News now our Captain was come home? I told him I was going to <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> to the Court-Martial: He then a&s;k'd me if I knew nothing more than the Adverti&s;ement for the Court-Mar|tial? I told him no; at which he told me,
<PB N="236" REF="007859_0268_102DDC61B24F41D8">that the <HI>Monday</HI> before the Adverti&s;ement was publi&s;hed, there were four Me&s;&s;engers di&s;patch'd from the Mar&s;hal of the Admiralty, in order to take up the Lieutenant, Boat|&s;wain, My&s;elf and Carpenter. On this I re|ply'd, if that is Fact, I will go and deliver my &s;elf up to the Mar&s;hal here in Town; finding me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ix'd in my re&s;olution, he de&s;i|red me to go and dine at the <HI>Paul's-Head</HI> Tavern in <HI>St. Paul's Church-Yard,</HI> where the Deputy Mar&s;hal was to dine that Day, ac|cordingly I went, and after Dinner apply'd to him, de&s;iring to know his Opinion in regard to the Officers of the <HI>Wager,</HI> as their Cap|tain was come home; for that I had a near relation which was an Officer that came in that Long-boat to the <HI>Brazil,</HI> and it would give me Concern if he &s;hould &s;uffer: His An&s;wer was, that he believ'd we &s;hould be hang'd; to which I replied, for God's Sake for what, for not being drown'd? And is a Murderer at la&s;t come Home to be their Ac|cu&s;er? I have carefully peru&s;ed the Journal, and can't conceive that they have been guilty of Piracy, Mutiny, not any Thing el&s;e to de|&s;erve it.

As I was not known to him, on the&s;e Words, I told him, then I was one of the Men that mu&s;t &s;uffer, for that I was the unfortunate Gunner of the <HI>Wager:</HI> After he was convinced, he told me, I was then be|come his Pri&s;oner; he had me to his Hou&s;e, where I was confined until the re&s;t of the Officers were brought up to Town, which, as &s;oon as they came up, he wrote to their Lord|&s;hips to inform them, that he had us all in Cu&s;tody; but that I had delivered my &s;elf up to him here in Town; de&s;iring their Lord|&s;hips farther Directions concerning us.

<P>Hearing this Sermon gave us &s;ome rea&s;on to think, that we were to fall by the Violence of Power, contrary to the Laws of our Country. In the Evening of the &s;ame Day we were in|formed by the Ma&s;ter and Gunner of the &s;aid Ship, that a certain Gentleman had &s;ent Word that we might have the Privilege of Pen, Ink and Paper until the Day of Tryal, which was to be on the <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> following, and that he had made a re&s;olution, that no Man after Sen|tence
<PB N="239" REF="007859_0271_102DDC65ED79FBA8">of Death &s;hould be indulged with it on any Account.</P>
<P>All this we imagined was done on purpo&s;e to intimidate us, to retract from the Truth which was publi&s;hed to the World: But our great, good and ju&s;t God &s;upported and &s;trengthened our Faith to bear with the&s;e In|&s;ults from Men. The next Day in the Morn|ing came on Board the Judge Advocate, in order to take our Depo&s;itions for Trayl. When I was &s;ent for, I was a&s;ked for a Depo&s;ition concerning the Lo&s;s, of His Maje&s;ty's Ship the <HI>Wager;</HI> I made An&s;wer, Sir, I am &s;urpri&s;ed that you &s;hould offer to a&s;k me for a Depo|&s;ition whil&s;t a Pri&s;oner. Sir, this is not the fir&s;t, but the &s;econd Time to your Knowledge, that I have been confined on this very Occa&s;i|on; I always thought, or at lea&s;t the Laws of my Country tell me, that when a Man is a Pri&s;oner, he mu&s;t be accu&s;ed; and I take my Accu&s;er to be Captain <HI>Cheap,</HI> expecting you was come here on purpo&s;e to have given me his Charge, to prepare my&s;elf for Tryal again&s;t him. The Mar&s;hal's An&s;wer was, <HI>Sir, this Court-Martial is only to know how the Ship was lo&s;t, therefore you mu&s;t give me your Depo&s;ition in Regard to it.</HI> I an&s;wered, Sir, that is made mention of in a very particular Manner in the
<PB N="240" REF="007859_0272_102DDC686954FE60">Journal that is publi&s;hed, and by the Truth of which Book I &s;tand or fall. He made An&s;wer, <HI>Sir, that does not avail, you mu&s;t give it us from under your own Hand Writing,</HI> I reply'd, if I do, Sir, I mu&s;t take it from the Journal; which I did. The next Day came on the Tryal, where Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> alledged the Lo&s;s of the Ship on Lieutenant <HI>Robert Beans</HI> by not &s;etting the Main-top-&s;ail, and letting go the Anchor, according to his Orders. However it was proved by &s;ome of the Offi|cers there, the Impo&s;&s;ibility of it. After being examined about the Lo&s;s of the Ship, was or|der'd by the Court to withdraw; &s;ome time af|ter was order'd into Court again, where was read, <HI>We do Honourably acquit Captain</HI> David Cheap, <HI>with the Re&s;t of his Officers, from the Lo&s;s of His Maje&s;ty's Ship the</HI> Wager, <HI>excepting Lieu|tenant</HI> Robert Beans, <HI>who has di&s;obey'd his Cap|tain's Orders, by not &s;etting the Main-top-&s;ail, and letting go the Anchor, as ordered; however, in Regard to his Hard&s;hips and Misfortunes, do al&s;o acquit him with a Reprimand from the Court.</HI></P>
<P>In this Day's Proceedings we beheld the great and glorious Power of the Almighty, in plead-our Cau&s;e, and defending us from falling by the Violence of Men. In about a Week's time after, I went to <HI>London,</HI> and writ unto their
<PB N="241" REF="007859_0273_102DDC6B050C1570">Lord&s;hips for Wages, receiving no An&s;wer, apply'd to &s;ome of their Lord&s;hips in Per|&s;on, one of which was plea&s;ed to a&s;k me if I was not one of the Men that publi&s;hed the Book? I made An&s;wer, I was; to this he replyed, <Q>How dare you pre&s;ume to touch a Gentleman's Character in &s;o publick a Manner as you have done? Do you think that Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> has nothing to &s;ay in Vindication of his Character? He will no doubt call you to an Account for it: We have not heard as yet, what he has to Charge you with, therefore no Wages, nor any Thing el&s;e can be done for you, unle&s;s a Hearing from him.</Q> I made An&s;wer, My Lord, I was honourably acquitted with him, and the Book that is publi&s;hed has put it out of the Power of Captain <HI>Cheap</HI> to al|ledge any Thing again&s;t us. His Lord&s;hip an&s;wer'd, <HI>I wi&s;h you may clear your Point in it.</HI></P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding my thus being appoint|ed to the Command of the &s;aid Cutter, yet, I afterwards, upon maturely con&s;idering it, declined the Service; &s;he being too &s;mall to bear the Sea; which was verify'd in her Crui&s;e, for &s;he founder'd in the Bay of <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> and every Man in her was drowned.</P>
<P>About this Time arrived in <HI>England Sa|muel Cooper, John Andrews,</HI> and <HI>I&s;aac Morris,</HI> three of the Men left on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Pata|gonia,</HI> as mentioned <HI>Page</HI> 160 the Narrative they gave of their Sufferings, is as follows:</P>
<Q>A <HI>NARRATIVE</HI> of the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, &amp;c. of Eight of the Crew of the Long Boat, who were left on Shore by the Lieutenant of the <HI>Wager</HI> on an uninhabited Part of <HI>Patagonia,</HI> mentioned in this Book, <HI>Page 160,</HI> and taken from the Ac|count of <HI>I&s;aac Morris</HI> (one of the Men) who arrived in <HI>England,</HI> July, <HI>1746.</HI></Q>
<P>ON the 14th of <HI>January,</HI> 1741-2, the Wind blew hard at E. S. E. and we &s;aw our Ve&s;&s;el &s;tretching further off, and &s;oon after we received, in a &s;cuttled Ca&s;k, a few Ne|ce&s;&s;aries,
<PB N="245" REF="007859_0277_102DDC75AF29DE28">with Ammunition, and a Letter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>p. 162,</HI> for the Rea&s;ons for leaving the&s;e unhappy Men a&s;hore.</NOTE>to acquaint us of the ri&s;que they &s;hould run in lying near the Shore, and that they were obliged to &s;tand farther off for their own Safety till the Weather &s;hould be more fa|vourable. Next Morning we expected they would have &s;tretch'd in for the Land; but, to our great Surprize, we &s;aw the Schooner with her En&s;ign hoi&s;ted at the Topping-lift, and under Sail from us.</P>
<P>The di&s;mal Apprehen&s;ion we were under at &s;uch an unexpected Stroke, appeared plain|ly in our Countenances, and are much ea|&s;ier to be imagin'd than de&s;cribed. We found our&s;elves on a wild de&s;olate Part of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> World, fatigued, &s;ickly, and de&s;titute of Pro|vi&s;ions. 'Tis true we had Arms and Ammu|nition, and, whil&s;t that la&s;ted, made a toler|able Shift for a Livelihood. The neare&s;t in|habited Place we knew of was <HI>Buenos-Ayres,</HI> about three hundred Miles to the N. W. but at pre&s;ent we were in a very poor Condi|tion to undertake &s;uch an hazardous Journey, being &s;o mi&s;erably reduced by our tedious Pa&s;&s;age thro' the <HI>Streights of Magellan.</HI> No|thing remained but to commit our&s;elves to
<PB N="246" REF="007859_0278_102DDC77B3CB9908">kind Providence, and make the be&s;t of our melancholy Situation, till we had recruited our&s;elves.</P>
<P>We were in Number eight who were thus abandoned by our Crew, for who&s;e Pre&s;erva|tion we ri&s;qued our Lives, in &s;wimming a&s;hore for Provi&s;ions. Our Names were <HI>Guy Broad|water, Samuel Cooper, Benjamin Smith, John Duck, Jo&s;. Clinch, John Andrews, John Allen,</HI> and my&s;elf. After deliberating upon our un|happy Circum&s;tances, and comforting each other with imaginary Hopes, we came to a re&s;olution of taking up our Quarters on the Beach where we landed, till we &s;hould grow &s;trong enough to undergo the Fatigue of a Journey to <HI>Buenos-Ayres.</HI> The Weather being very favourable, we took up our Lodg|ing in a Trench near the Sea-&s;ide, quite ex|po&s;ed, without any Covering but the Hea|vens. Here we &s;tay'd about a Month, du|ring which Time we lived upon Seal, which were very plenty, and which we knocked down with Stones after we had cut off their retreat, by getting between them and the Sea. Here was likewi&s;e plenty of fre&s;h Water, from a &s;mall Spring which ro&s;e out of the Trench; &s;o that, at the Month's End, we had pretty well recover'd our&s;elves, and
<PB N="247" REF="007859_0279_102DDC798E579D98">concluded upon laying in a Stock of Provi|&s;ions for our Journey to <HI>Buenos-Ayres.</HI></P>
<P>Having provided our&s;elves each with a Knap&s;ack, which we made of Seal-&s;kin, in the be&s;t Manner we could, we put into it as much dried Seal as we could carry, and their Bladders we filled with Fre&s;h Water, which &s;erved us for Bottles. We took our Mu&s;kets and Ammunition with us, and, thus accoutred, we &s;et out on our Journey about the Middle of <HI>February;</HI> and, that we might proceed with the more Certainty, we were determined to keep clo&s;e to the Sea-&s;ide till we &s;hould come to the Mouth of the <HI>River Plate.</HI> The fir&s;t two Days we travelled about &s;ixty Miles, but could meet with no fre&s;h Water, be&s;ides what we brought with us, the Country being &s;corch'd with Drought, and the rains not yet &s;et in. Our Water be|ing near expended, we were afraid to proceed, le&s;t we &s;hould peri&s;h for want of more; &s;o, after a few Debates, we agreed to return back to our old Quarters, and wait till the rainy Sea&s;on. We were two Days and a half on our return, after which we employ'd our&s;elves in building a Sort of Hut under a Cliff adjoining the Sea-&s;ide, to &s;ecure us from the Inclemencies of the Weather. Here we tarried three Months, during which Time
<PB N="248" REF="007859_0280_102DDC7BCF1F9500">our Food was Seals and Armadillos, which was the only Provi&s;ion to be met with here, except Sea-weed, which we &s;ometimes made u&s;e of with our Meat in&s;tead of Bread. The Seal here differ from tho&s;e which I have &s;een in other Parts, both in Size and Make. The Males are the Bigne&s;s of a good Calf; their Neck is &s;haggy; their Head and Face is &s;omewhat like a Lion's. The Females are like Lione&s;&s;es before, but their Hair is &s;mooth all over like an Hor&s;e's, whereas the Male is &s;mooth only on his hinder Parts. From the hinder Part grow two large Fins like Feet, and two more out of the Brea&s;t, by Means of which they can climb rocks and Precipices, tho' they delight chiefly to lie a&s;leep near the Shore. Some are fourteen Feet long, and very fat; but in general they are about eight Feet: The Fle&s;h of the young ones is almo&s;t as white as Lamb, and tolerable good Eating. From the Shoulders to the Tail they grow tapering like Fi&s;h; and when the Females give &s;uck to their Young they &s;it upon their Fins, which grow out of their hinder Part. Their Hair is of different Colours, looking very &s;leek when they come fir&s;t out of the Sea.</P>
<P>The Armadillo is as big nearly as a &s;mall Sucking-Pig, the Body of it pretty large.
<PB N="249" REF="007859_0281_102DDC7DB975B780">It is inclo&s;ed in a thick Shell, which guards all its Back, and comes down on both Sides, meeting under the Belly, leaving room for the four Legs; the Head is &s;mall, with a No&s;e like a Hedgehog, and a pretty long Neck, which it thru&s;ts out before its Body when it walks, but on any Danger &s;he draws it in under the Shell, and, thru&s;ting in her Feet, &s;he lies &s;tock-&s;till like a Land Turtle, and tho' you kick her about &s;he will not move her&s;elf. The Shell is jointed in the Middle of the Back, &s;o that &s;he can turn the fore Part of her Body which Way &s;he plea&s;es; the Feet are like tho&s;e of a Land Turtle, and it has &s;trong Claws, with which it digs Holes in the Ground, and burrows in them like a rabbit. Its Fle&s;h is very good Eating, and ta&s;tes much like a Turtle.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable happen'd to us in the&s;e three Months. Our Provi&s;ions, &s;uch as they were, were not very difficult to be pro|cured, and we were &s;upplied with Fire-wood enough from a &s;mall Wood or Coppice a|bout &s;even Miles from us. We &s;eldom fail|ed of bringing home &s;omething every Night, and generally had a hot Supper. We pa&s;|&s;ed our Time as chearful as poor Fellows in our Circum&s;tances could. But we knew we could not take up this Place for our &s;et|tled
<PB N="250" REF="007859_0282_102DDC7FADE26DF0">Abode; and there was no Likelihood of any Inhabitants near us, nor for many Miles round could we perceive the lea&s;t Traces of any ever having been there; and 'twas to no Purpo&s;e to expect the Sight of any Ve&s;&s;el off at Sea; for, it being a deep Bay, and &s;hoal Water, no Ships ever put in there, unle&s;s forced by Stre&s;s of Weather, and then they mu&s;t be wrecked. Nothing remain'd for us but to make a &s;econd Attempt for the river <HI>Plate;</HI> for, if we &s;hould march to the Inland Country in que&s;t of Inhabitants, po&s;&s;ibly we &s;hould meet with in&s;uperable Difficulties in finding the Way back again to what I may call our Home; whereas if we kept our Cour&s;e along the Sea-&s;hore we could not err. For which rea&s;ons we re&s;olved upon another Attempt by the &s;ame rout, and, having laid in our Stock of Seal, Armadillos, and fre&s;h Water, towards the latter End of <HI>May,</HI> we &s;et forward once more.</P>
<P>In three Days we travelled about &s;eventy Miles; when towards Night, there came on a violent Storm of rain, Thunder and Light|ning, which continued the whole Night: We had a plain open Country, and no Place of Shelter could be found; we had nothing to cover us but a Seal-&s;kin Jacket, were half dead with Cold, and afraid how our Provi|&s;ions
<PB N="251" REF="007859_0283_102DDC81EFDD1510">would hold out; for we met with no Supplies of any Kind by the Way. To proceed farther was only lengthening our Journey back again, which we feared, would be the Con&s;equence at la&s;t, even tho' we &s;hould &s;till pu&s;h on. There had been the &s;tricte&s;t Harmony and Good-nature between us till now; but now we were like to have di&s;agreed even to parting. Some were for pu&s;hing forward, be the Event what it might; and 'twas with Difficulty they were per&s;waded not to divide. However, upon a repre&s;entation of the great Di&s;tance we were as yet from the Mouth of the river, and the Improbability of meeting with Supplies of Provi&s;ion by the Way, our Debates ended, and we jointly concluded on making the be&s;t of our Way back to our Hut, having been a &s;econd Time di&s;appointed in our At|tempt.</P>
<P>After being arrived at our old Quarters, we began to con&s;ult what Mea&s;ures to take for our Security from the Inclemencies of the Weather, and to provide for our Sub&s;i&s;tence, till it &s;hould plea&s;e God, one Way or other, to deliver us out of this Melancholy Situa|tion. In order to avoid Di&s;putes about the laborious Part of getting Provi&s;ions, we a|greed to divide our&s;elves into two Parties,
<PB N="252" REF="007859_0284_102DDC83B61EC838">who were, alternately, to provide for the Whole: Four were appointed to &s;cour the Country one Day, and the other four the next. And we had bound our&s;elves by an Oath never to quit each other, unle&s;s obli|ged by a &s;uperior Force; for tho' we had as yet &s;een no Foot&s;teps of Inhabitants, we could not be certain there were none on this Part of the Globe. We had killed &s;uch a Number of Seal, that they now became ve|ry &s;hy of us, and had lived upon them &s;o long that we were almo&s;t &s;urfeited; yet there was hardly any thing el&s;e to be met with. We &s;aw a great Number of wild Dogs, but could never come near enough to kill any; tho' now and then we chanced to &s;hoot a Puppy, which, as it was change of Diet, we thought delicious Fare. We &s;aw al&s;o &s;ome Deer, but could contrive no Method to take them. One Day in our rambles, we met with a Litter of young Puppies: they were but three, and &s;eemed to be about two Months old, and taken Shelter in a Hole of one of the Sand-hills. We took 'em out, and brought 'em home to our Hut. Having di&s;|cover'd that the&s;e Puppies were whelped in Holes like tho&s;e of rabbits but larger, we went all out the next Day in que&s;t of more, and had the good Luck to find three Litters, in
<PB N="253" REF="007859_0285_102DDC86141FAC20">Number thirteen, which we carried home with us, de&s;igning if po&s;&s;ible, to bring them up tame. We fed them with Broth made of Seals, and &s;ometimes with the Fle&s;h minced &s;mall; and they afterwards became very &s;er|viceable to us. Each of us had his Brace of Dogs, which were brought up under as much Command as an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Spaniel, nor would they leave us to a&s;&s;ociate with the wild Ones; they often &s;upplied us with Ar|madillos, and once they killed us a Deer. Be|ing one Day hunting, we &s;aw &s;ome wild Hogs, with their Young; our Dogs pur&s;ued them, and took two of the Young, which we &s;aved alive; and we &s;hot one of the old Ones, which afforded us many dainty Sup|pers. The young ones proved to be a Boar and a Sow, which was very fortunate, and we de&s;igned to rear them for Breeding, le&s;t we &s;hould be obliged to a long re&s;idence in this de&s;olate Country. We brought them up very tame, in&s;omuch that they followed our Dogs when ever we went a hunting; and at Night both Dogs and Pigs, took up their Lodging with us in our Hut.</P>
<P>For the pre&s;ent our Condition &s;eemed to|lerable; nay, we thought our&s;elves in very comfortable Circum&s;tances: We wanted for nothing, and, if we could have confined our
<PB N="254" REF="007859_0286_102DDC88158DE9F0">Thoughts to pre&s;ent Enjoyments, our Situa|tion was very agreeable. But our Views were farther, and the Fears of what might happen frequently &s;truck a Damp on our Plea&s;ures. Winter was now approaching; we had the Inclemencies of the Sea&s;on to guard again&s;t, and if po&s;&s;ible, a Stock of Pro|vi&s;ions to be laid up again&s;t future Emergen|cies. but we could not be much before|hand with Provi&s;ions, having no Salt to cure them, and at pre&s;ent not Sun enough to dry them; for with Winter came on continual Storms, with rains, in&s;omuch that &s;ome Days we could not &s;tir out of our Hut.</P>
<P>'Twas now more than &s;even Months &s;ince the Long-boat left us. Winter came on very fa&s;t, and we were but badly &s;ecured from the Severity of the Weather. We re&s;olved im|mediatety to put our Habitation in Order, and to &s;ecure our Hut in the be&s;t Manner we could. Accordingly it was agreed that &s;ix &s;hould &s;tay at home next Day to prepare Ma|terials, and two only to go out after Pro|vi&s;ions, the Lot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> upon my&s;elf and <HI>John Duck,</HI> to go ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d: All the Game we could meet with w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e three Armadillos, tho's we travelled many Miles. 'Twas &s;o dark before we returned, that we de&s;paired of finding our Hut, and were like to have taken up our
<PB N="255" REF="007859_0287_102DDC8A617A7EE0">Lodging in the open Plain, if our Comrades had not come out in que&s;t of us, and, by making a Fire, directed us towards them. After we had broiled our Game, and fed heartily, about Twelve we went to &s;leep. But, about Two in the Morning, a violent Storm, with rain, Thunder, and Lightning, threw down Part of the Cliff upon us, under which we had built our Hut, and was very near proving fatal to us all; but, thro' Pro|vidence, none were hurt. With Day-light came on tolerable Weather; and now the fir&s;t Thing we had to do was to rebuild our Hut. We immediately went to the Coppice where we u&s;ed to &s;eek our Fire-wood, in order to fell &s;ome Poles. As we had but one Hatchet betwixt us, one only could fell them, and the re&s;t of us brought them out and bundled 'em. We had cut &s;everal, and were bundling them, when we &s;aw <HI>Jo&s;. Clinch</HI> running out of the Wood, and crying, <HI>Lord have Mercy upon us, here's a great Tyger.</HI> We were in the utmo&s;t Con&s;ternation; for having been frequently there before, and never once &s;eeing any Foot|&s;teps of Wild Bea&s;ts, we came without our Arms, &s;u&s;pecting no Danger from that Quar|ter. We all took to our Heels, and &s;oon &s;aw him running out of the Wood in Pur&s;uit of us. When he was come within twenty
<PB N="256" REF="007859_0288_102DDC8D2DE367F0">Yards of us, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape him, we all turned towards him, clapping our Hands, and making a loud Holo, in order to frighten him, which had the de&s;ired Ef|fect; for he immediately &s;at back on his Tail, gazing at us. What to do we knew not, whe|ther 'twas be&s;t to fly, or wait for his turning; but Fear prevailed, and we walked gently off, without his pur&s;uing us. Next Day we all went with our Mu&s;kets in Chace of him, but could not meet with him. We brought home our Poles, and fitted up our Hut in the be&s;t Manner we could, &s;ufficient to guard us from the rain.</P>
<P>About three Weeks after, when we were hunting on the Plain, about four Miles from home, we &s;aw a Lion couched on the Ground, watching his Prey, as we imagin'd, it being clo&s;e by a wild Cat's Hole. We joined clo&s;e together in a Body, with our Mu&s;kets ready; and <HI>Jo&s;. Clinch</HI> fired a Ball at him at twenty Yards Di&s;tance, re&s;ting his Piece on my Shoul|der, but mi&s;s'd him: The Lion took no No|tice of the report of the Gun, nor &s;tirred from his Po&s;ture. He charged a &s;econd Time, ours being kept in readine&s;s in Ca&s;e he &s;hould advance towards us; he fired, and &s;hot him in the right Shoulder; he fell on his Back, and we ran to him, and knock'd him in the
<PB N="267" REF="007859_0289_102DDC8F70878DB0">Head with the Bones of a dead Hor&s;e which lay near him. We carried him to our Hut, dre&s;s'd his Heart and Part of his ribs; but 'twas very indifferent Eating.</P>
<P>Finding our&s;elves beginning to be &s;urround|ed with wild Bea&s;ts, and every Day and Night in continual Danger (for we now &s;eldom went abroad without meeting &s;ome Bea&s;t of Prey; this being, I &s;uppo&s;e, the Time of Year when they take their Haunts towards the Sea-coa&s;t), we determin'd to make another Pu&s;h for our Deliverance, and try our Fortune once more in an Expedition to <HI>Buenos Ayres.</HI> In order hereto we provided our&s;elves Shoes and Jack|ets of Seal-&s;kins, and made our&s;elves Knap|&s;acks of the &s;ame to carry our Provender. The Weather was &s;et in fair, and we were fully determin'd to lay in &s;uch a Stock of Pro|vi&s;ions as &s;hould la&s;t us to the End of our Journey, if we &s;hould be a Month in per|forming it. To this End we divided our&s;elves into two Parties; four of us were to go to the rocks for Seal, and the other four to hunt on the Plain. Accordingly we &s;et out early in the Morning: 'twas my Lot, with <HI>Sam. Coop|er, John Andrews,</HI> and <HI>John Duck,</HI> to go to the rocks. Our u&s;ual Way in killing Seal being with Stones or Clubs, we never carried our Mu&s;kets with us, we had been out all Day,
<PB N="268" REF="007859_0290_102DDC91C8AC8CF0">and killed three; and in the Du&s;k of the Even|ing, when we were got within a Stone's Ca&s;t of our Hut, I perceiv'd our Dogs very bu&s;y at a &s;mall Di&s;tance, wagging their Tails in a very fondling Manner. Being a-head of my Companions, I pa&s;&s;ed on without much regard|ing it, thinking they had lighted on a dead Colt. But when I came to the Hut, I was quite confounded: The Hut was rifled, and all our Nece&s;&s;aries taken away. In the ut|mo&s;t Con&s;ternation I ran back to my Com|rades, whom I &s;aw &s;tanding where I had left the Dogs: Seeing me running eagerly towards them, they cry'd out, <HI>What's the Matter,</HI> I&s;aac? I told them our Hut was pull'd down, and e|very thing taken away. <HI>Ay,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>and &s;omething wor&s;e has happened; for yonder lie poor</HI> Guy Broad-water <HI>and</HI> Ben. Smith <HI>murder'd.</HI> 'Twas a mo&s;t &s;hocking Sight: One had his Throat cut and the other was &s;tabb'd in the Brea&s;t; they were hardly cold, &s;o we thought the Murderers could not be far off. And we were under no &s;mall Apprehen&s;ion of &s;haring a like Fate. We went to the Hut to in&s;pect more narrowly, and found every thing taken away; our Powder, Ball, and Mu&s;kets gone, the Fire extingui&s;h'd, and not the lea&s;t Uten|&s;il left. Where to go or what to do we knew not. We dur&s;t not tru&s;t our&s;elves another
<PB N="269" REF="007859_0291_102DDC93FA8CC8E8">Night on this fatal Spot, and yet were afraid to venture farther. At la&s;t we came to a re|&s;olution of going to the next &s;andy Bay, about a Mile off, and take up our Quarters there for that Night: But, when there, we could find no Shelter, not &s;o much as a Cliff to lie under; &s;o were obliged to return to our old Place, and pa&s;s the Night there, happen what would. Next Morning the Dogs which belonged to our Comrades &s;tood on the Top of the Cliff barking at us, and would not come down, tho' we called them by their Names; and 'twas with Difficulty we enticed them down in the Evening. What became of <HI>Jo&s;. Clinch</HI> and <HI>John Allen</HI> we knew not, nor could we after|wards learn any Account of them: What &s;eem'd mo&s;t probable to us was, that the <HI>In|dians</HI> had carried them off, and murder'd the other two, who po&s;&s;ibly might make &s;ome re|&s;i&s;tance, as we had all agreed to do, in Ca&s;e we &s;hould be attack'd; but, if &s;o, we might probably have expected to have found &s;ome or other of their Enemies killed, as our People had Fire-Arms with them. And it was im|po&s;&s;ible it could be the re&s;ult of a Quarrel a|mong&s;t them&s;elves, from the Manner of their Death; for one was &s;tabb'd, and the other had his Throat cut, both very plainly done with a Knife, an In&s;trument which none of
<PB N="270" REF="007859_0292_102DDC964CD942C8">us had the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of. We buried 'em in the the be&s;t Manner we could, by &s;craping a|way the light Sand with our Hands two Feet deep, and rai&s;ing a Bed of Sand over the Corp&s;es.</P>
<P>This was the mo&s;t afflicting Stroke of any we received &s;ince our re&s;idence in this unhap|py Country. I won't pretend to de&s;cribe the Horrors we felt; the compa&s;&s;ionate reader will paint our Di&s;tre&s;s in his Imagination in &s;tronger Colours than can be de&s;cribed by Words. To &s;ee four of our Companions &s;natched from us &s;uddenly we knew not how, our&s;elves deprived of our Arms and Uten&s;ils, left without Fire, or any Method of procur|ing it, expecting every Moment to &s;hare their Fate, or to be &s;tarved to Death, filled us with un&s;peakable Terrors.</P>
<P>In this melancholy State the only thing that remain'd to be done was immediately to quit this unhappy Place, and make one Attempt more for <HI>Buenos Ayres.</HI> We had no Time to lo&s;e, but in&s;tantly &s;et about tearing up the Seal in &s;mall Pieces, raw as it was, with which we filled our Knap&s;acks, and their Bladders we filled with Water, le&s;t we &s;hould find none on our Journey. Having furni&s;h'd our|&s;elves with as much Provi&s;ion as we could carry, we &s;et forward on our Journey, with
<PB N="271" REF="007859_0293_102DC7076EA400A0">our &s;ixteen Dogs and two Pigs; praying the Almighty to be our Guide. We kept clo&s;e along the Sea Coa&s;t, as we had done be|fore, by which Means we could not mi&s;s the <HI>River Plate;</HI> where when we &s;hould arrive our De&s;ign was to travel along the Side of that river till we &s;hould come to &s;ome inhabi|ted Place: A Scheme ea&s;y enough in Ima|gination, but in Practice attended, as we found, with in&s;uperable Difficulties.</P>
<P>The Sea Coa&s;t all along is a plain &s;andy Beach; on the Land Side are here and there very high Sand-hills: In the Valleys of tho&s;e Hills we repo&s;ed our&s;elves at Night. On the Beach we &s;ometimes found &s;ome Cockles, which the Sea had wa&s;h'd in; the&s;e were a great Dainty to us. We met with Part of the Wreck of a large Ship which was drove upon the Beach, particularly a Man of War's Gang|board, and a Piece of Plank mark'd fifteen Foot. In the Valleys of the Sand-hills was Plenty of Water, which had been ponded up after the rains; and we frequently met with dead Fi&s;h thrown in upon the Beach; &s;o that we had a Variety of raw Meat to feed upon. We al&s;o found by the Sea-&s;ide a very large dead Whale which was a Fea&s;t for our Dogs and Pigs, and at a little Di&s;tance a Parcel of fine Whale-bone.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="007859_0294_102DDC9A32B9EE70">
At the End of ten Days we made the Cape of the river, having travelled very hard every Day, and met with tolerable Weather, but when we got there we found a Multitude of &s;mall rivers and muddy Swamps to ob&s;truct us. We &s;wam over &s;everal of them, with our Knap&s;acks acro&s;s our Shoulders; and when Night came on we cover'd our&s;elves with the ru&s;hes, but were almo&s;t devour'd by Mu&s;ke|toes. Next Day we made &s;everal Attempts to proceed farther, but found it impo&s;&s;ible to accompli&s;h our Journey; the farther we went the greater Difficulties we met with. We were &s;everal times in Danger of being &s;uffo|cated, the Bog often &s;inking us to the Shoul|ders; &s;o that, after many fruitle&s;s Attempts to proceed, we found we had no remedy left but to tread back the melancholy Path, and return to our old Place of rendezvous; which we performed in le&s;s than ten Days.</P>
<P>At our return we were afraid to ramble far abroad, having neither Arms nor Ammunition to defend our&s;elves from the Wild Bea&s;ts. Our two Pigs maintained us near a Fortnight, and afterwards we were obliged to live upon &s;ome of our tru&s;ty Dogs; but this raw Way of feeding, which continued three Months long|er, brought us into an ill State of Health. About a Quarter of a Mile from our Hut we
<PB N="273" REF="007859_0295_102DDC9CECADA328">found a dead Hor&s;e, of which now and then we took a Mor&s;el, by Way of Change; and could we have got Fire to dre&s;s it, the Vari|ety would have been agreeable enough. Not|with&s;tanding our Fears, Nece&s;&s;ity compell'd us to go abroad in Search of other kind of Provi&s;ions, and &s;ometimes we had the good Fortune to bring home an Armadillo.</P>
<P>One Morning we found the Trunk of a large Tree, and imagined 'twas not impo&s;&s;i|ble, with the Help of the Skins of Seal and Hor&s;es, to make a Sort of a Boat with it, which might &s;erve to convey us along Shore to the river <HI>Plate.</HI> But we had no kind of Tool to u&s;e. <HI>J. Duck</HI> recollected that about eleven Months before, at the End of our fir&s;t Attempt for <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> he threw away his Mu&s;ket, it being a very indifferent one, and not worth the trouble of bringing home, ha|ving enough be&s;ides for our U&s;e. We pro|po&s;ed to go in Search of it, which if we could find might &s;erve to make a Hatchet, Acoord|ingly we furni&s;h'd our&s;elves with &s;ome ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Seal and Water, went, and found the Mu&s;ket, tho' above &s;ixty Miles. On our return home we found &s;everal O&s;triches Eggs, about half buried in the Sand, which was a refre&s;hing Meal to us (tho' we never met with any of the Birds.) When we brought it home <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="274" REF="007859_0296_102DDC9F373C07A8">beat half the length of the Barrel flat with Stones, and whetted an Edge to it again&s;t a rock, the other Half &s;erved for the Handle, and it made a tolerable Hatchet; at lea&s;t what would have &s;erved in&s;tead of one, if Provi|dence had not put an End to our De&s;ign in the following Manner.</P>
<P>Two Days after we had fini&s;hed our Hatch|et, it being my Turn to &s;tay in the Hut, my three Comrades went to a Place which we called the <HI>Long Point</HI> in Search of Provi&s;ions. Towards Evening I walked out to &s;ee if they were returning; when, to my A&s;toni&s;hment, I di&s;cover'd about a Dozen of Hor&s;es gallop|ing down the &s;andy Bay towards our Hut, and, as they came nearer, I plainly &s;aw Men on their Backs, and that they were <HI>Indians.</HI> 'Twas in vain to fly; I imagined nothing but Death approaching, and prepared to meet it with all the re&s;olution I could mu&s;ter up. I ran towards them, and fell on my Knees, begging my Life with all the Signs of Hu|mility I could make; when I heard a Voice &s;aying, <HI>Don't be afraid</HI> I&s;aac! <HI>we are all here.</HI> This revived me. The <HI>Indians</HI> alighted, and whil&s;t &s;ome were intent on examining the Hut, others &s;tood with drawn Knives, ready to di&s;patch us in ca&s;e we made any re&s;i&s;tance. When they had &s;atisfied ther Curio&s;ity they
<PB N="275" REF="007859_0297_102DDCA189963558">gave three confu&s;ed Shouts, and immediately made us get up behind them, and carried us away a few Miles in from the Sea-&s;hore to the S. W. where were about a Dozen more of their Companions, with upwards of four hundred Hor&s;es which they had taken in Hunt|ing. They treated us with great Huma|nity, killed a Hor&s;e for us, kindled a Fire, and roa&s;ted a Part of it, which to us, who had been three Months eating raw Fle&s;h, was a mo&s;t delicious Entertainment. They al&s;o gave each of us a Piece of an old Blanket to co|ver our Nakedne&s;s. I was in great Danger, it &s;eems, of being left alone; for when the <HI>Indians</HI> met with my three Comrades, they were immediately for hurrying them away to their Place of rendezvous, till, with Difficul|ty they were brought to under&s;tand, by Signs, that there was one more belonging to them a little Way off; and then guided them to the Hut, where I had the Happine&s;s of being ta|ken Pri&s;oner with them.</P>
<P>Next Morning we decamped from this Place, driving our Troop of Hor&s;e before us. We travelled nineteen Days before we arri|ved at their next Place of rendezvous, which. I imagine, was about two hundred Miles from our Hut to the S. W. in a Valley be|tween two very high Mountains, where was
<PB N="276" REF="007859_0298_102DDCA3268CCA28">fine Pa&s;ture for their Hor&s;es, and &s;everal &s;mall rivers of fre&s;h Water, but very little Wood to be &s;een for many Miles round. In this Val|ley were about a Dozen <HI>Indian</HI> Huts, built with Poles and the Skins of Hor&s;es, inhabi|ted by another Party of <HI>Indians,</HI> with their Wives and Children, who gazed very earne&s;t|ly on us, as tho' they had never &s;een any White People before. Here we were bought and &s;old four different Times for a Pair of Spurs, a Bra&s;s Pan, O&s;triches Feathers, and &s;uch like Trifles, which was the low Price generally &s;et on each of us; and &s;ometimes we were played away at Dice; &s;o that we chan|ged Ma&s;ters &s;everal Times in a Day. In this Place we remained near a Month, by which Time the &s;everal Parties of <HI>Indians</HI> had re|turned from their Hunting, and joined us, each Party bringing the Hor&s;es they had ta|ken in hunting, and mixing them all in the common Stock; which were examin'd and told over by one of the <HI>Indians</HI> who &s;eemed to be a &s;ort of a Captain over the re&s;t, and they amounted to the Number of fifteen Hundred and upwards, &s;ome of which were no way inferior to the be&s;t of our <HI>European</HI> Breed.</P>
<P>After one Day's grand Fea&s;ting, we &s;et out in a Body for their Chief Town, where the
<PB N="277" REF="007859_0299_102DDCA5D94E6C90">King, or Captain, lived, with fifteen hundred String of Hor&s;es in our Cavalcade. We were four Months in performing our Jour|ney, and, by the Method of our traveling, I believe it mu&s;t be a thou&s;and Miles from the Sea-Coa&s;t where our Hut &s;tood. In the Day-time we travelled, and at Night repo&s;ed our&s;elves in their moveable Huts, which &s;helter'd us from the Weather. Our con|&s;tant Food was Hor&s;e-fle&s;h, which &s;ome cho&s;e to eat raw, and others broiled or roa&s;ted; and, as for Drink, we never fail'd of Water; for I found they were well acquainted with every &s;mall rivulet, of which there are Num|bers in the rout they took, tho' a Stranger would hardly have found them.</P>
<P>At length we arrived to the End of our Journey, the Chief Town, where the King lives; but our Ma&s;ters who had made the la&s;t Purcha&s;e of us were carrying us with them to their own Home (which we learnt after|wards was about two hundred Miles beyond the Town where the King re&s;ided) and had carried us &s;ome Miles; when a Party of Hor&s;e came after us, and brought us back to the Capital, the King claiming us as his Proper|ty. This Town con&s;i&s;ts of about 30 Huts, built, in a low irregular Manner, with Poles and Hor&s;es Skins, &s;urrounded with Pali&s;adoes,
<PB N="278" REF="007859_0300_102DE9254F597D38">about three Foot Di&s;tance from each other. The Inhabitants, Men, Women, and Chil|dren, were about four&s;core. We were &s;oon &s;ummoned to appear before his Maje&s;ty, who received us in his Hut, &s;itting on the Ground, with a Javelin on one Side of him, and a Bow and Arrows on the other, a loo&s;e Man|tle round his Wai&s;t, and a &s;ort of Turret of O&s;triches Feathers on his Head, and a long reed Pipe in his Mouth, &s;moaking. After paying our Obedience to him, he began to a&s;k us &s;everal Que&s;tions in <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> of which they all can &s;peak a little, which we &s;oon let him know we under&s;tood a little of; en|quired what Countrymen we were, and how we came to this Country. We told him we were <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> lo&s;t in the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> in an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man of War, as we were going to fight again&s;t our Enemies the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> that we were eight in Number who were left on a de&s;olate Part of the Continent; that one Evening, on our return from getting Provi|&s;ion, we found two of our Companions mur|dered, and two more carried off, on the Spot of Ground where we were taken, our Hut pull'd down, and every thing taken from us; which we &s;uppo&s;ed mu&s;t be done by &s;ome of his Countrymen. He then called three or four of his Men, and talked very
<PB N="279" REF="007859_0301_102DC71041874410">earne&s;tly to them in their own Language. But it &s;eems they knew nothing of the Af|fair, as he told us; tho' he was plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ure us &s;trict Enquiry &s;hould be made of the other Parties which were out at the &s;ame Time. For I found by him, that he &s;ends out &s;everal different Parties every Spring from every different Town under his Govern|ment, who take different routs, and &s;ome|times join one another accidentally on their return. But of this more hereafter. When he found we were at War with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> he expre&s;s'd a great deal of Joy, and a&s;k'd if we were Great Men in our Country. We told him yes. He &s;aid the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were great Enemies to them, had took away their Country from them, and drove them to the Mountains. When he had done examining us, he ordered a Hor&s;e to be killed immedi|ately and dre&s;s'd for us; and lodged us in his own Hut for that Night, till we had one built for us, which was the next Day. Here we &s;taid eight Months, and winter'd, during which Time we had frequently Snow five or &s;ix Feet deep. Our Work was chief|ly to fetch Wood and Water, and &s;kin all the Hor&s;es which they killed; and tho' we were their Slaves, we were treated very humanely, and they would &s;uffer no one to u&s;e us ill.
<PB N="280" REF="007859_0302_102DDCA7F6EAF1D8">There were four <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Women in the Town, whom they had taken captive in a Skirmi&s;h near <HI>Buenos-Ayres;</HI> and the King told us, with a Smile, he would give us each a Wife.</P>
<P>The Country where the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> re&s;ided, as indeed the whole Coa&s;t of <HI>Patagonia,</HI> is ve|ry fruitful in Pa&s;ture, and abounds with great Plenty of wild Hor&s;es, and a few black Cat|tle, which are entirely neglected by the <HI>In|dians;</HI> Hor&s;e-fle&s;h being preferr'd by them for eating, before any other Kind of Fle&s;h, and what they con&s;tantly feed upon. 'Tis &s;ituated in a very healthy Climate, and, if the Soil was cultivated, would certainly pro|duce Plenty of all Kind of Crain. They have likewi&s;e Plenty of Wood, tho' few or no Timber Trees, &s;everal large Coppices grow|ing all round the Country, tho' near the Sea-&s;ide we &s;ee nothing but a plain open &s;and|dy Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Patagonian Indians,</HI> at lea&s;t tho&s;e in that Part of the Country where we re&s;ided, were tall and well-made, being in general, from five to &s;ix Feet high, good-natur'd and obliging to one another, and never &s;ee each other Want. Tho' they have what they call a King, yet he &s;eems to be only a Chief or Captain of a Party; for, as they have no &s;et|led Abode, but live &s;cattered throughout that
<PB N="281" REF="007859_0303_102DDCAA976CEED8">Part of the World in little Towns or Parties, each Party &s;eems to have a Chief, who pro|fides over them like a Petty King. I never could ob&s;erve any rules of Government a|mong 'em; but in a Drinking-bout King and Subjects are all alike. Their King is di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd from the re&s;t by his being the big|ge&s;t Man, and by wearing a kind of Sa&s;h round his Wai&s;t. 'Tis true he has a Defe|rence paid him by his Subjects, and whatever he orders to be done is immediately per|formed, being him&s;elf exempted from any kind of Work; but I never &s;aw any Puni&s;h|ments inflicted by him, nor any Quarrels a|mong them&s;elves, except when they get at a Drinking-Fea&s;t, and then their Wives always took Care no ill Con&s;equence &s;hould follow, by putting every Weapon out of their Way, and e&s;pecially taking Care of their Knives. For which rea&s;on I imagine that in Liquor they are always quarrel&s;ome. One or two In&s;tances of that Kind happen'd whil&s;t we were among them. Their Method of Fea&s;t|ing is this: They have in the Summer a Plen|ty of &s;mall &s;weet Berries growing like our Whortle Berries, and when they have pro|cured a &s;ufficient Quantity of them, they dig a Pit in the Ground, about four Feet &s;quare, the Bottom and Sides of which they line
<PB N="282" REF="007859_0304_102DDCAC399420A8">with Hor&s;e Hides. This Ca&s;k (if I may &s;o call it) they half fill with the&s;e Berries, and then fill it up with Water, which they &s;tir well with Sticks, and afterwards leave it to ferment about forty eight Hours. They all &s;it round, &s;moaking and drinking, for a whole Night together, Women as well as Men, &s;ing|ing in their Way, but more like &s;hrieking Cries; and when drunk frequently proceed to Blows.</P>
<P>They &s;eldom live long in one Place; for when their Hor&s;es have eat up the Pa&s;ture in one Place, they remove their Town and all their Goods, which is &s;oon done, a few Miles from the Former; and this &s;everal Times in the Year; &s;o that they have no &s;ettled Place of Abode. They have &s;catter'd Habitations all over the Country, and but few Huts together: The Town where their Chief re&s;ides has three times the Number of Dwellings to any of the re&s;t which I &s;aw.</P>
<P>They &s;eem to have &s;ome Notion of a Deity, and pay a &s;ort of Wor&s;hip to the Sun and Moon; e&s;pecially at every New Moon, they collect them&s;elves in a Body, and make a &s;o|lemn Proce&s;&s;ion round the Town, one going before with a kind of Hoop in his Hand, round which are tied little Bra&s;s Bells a|dorn'd with O&s;triches Feathers, which he
<PB N="283" REF="007859_0305_102DE8FBD8806660">would frequently &s;wing round in his Hand; and then the whole Company would make a mo&s;t hideous Noi&s;e, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, they de&s;igned for Singing. This Ceremony u&s;ual|ly la&s;ted about half an Hour. This Method with their Hoop and Bells is likewi&s;e u&s;ed when any of them are &s;ick or dying. A white Flannel Cloth is hung up before the &s;ick Per&s;on, and the Man with his Hoops and Bells, who is generally one of his relati|ons, comes to vi&s;it him; and after a few Mi|nutes Conver&s;ation, he leaves him, and walks &s;everal times round the Hut, jingling his Bells, and talking aloud in a variety of Ac|cents which we could under&s;tand nothing of, but imagined he de&s;igned it for Prayers for his &s;ick Friend. When any of 'em dies, they &s;oon bury him, generally the next Morning. They roll the Dead Body in a Hide, with eve|ry Thing that belongs to him, as Bows, Ar|rows, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and carry it, without any Ceremony, at &s;ome Di&s;tance from the Town; where they throw it into a large round Pit, dug on pur|po&s;e, which they afterwards fill up with Earth. Yet notwith&s;tandind they have no Ceremony at their Funeral, their Mourning for the Dead is very &s;trict, which the Friends of the Decea&s;ed ob&s;erve for three Months; during which Time they remove them&s;elves
<PB N="284" REF="007859_0306_102DE8FE65A106B0">at a Di&s;tance from any of the re&s;t of the Hou|&s;es, and conver&s;e with nobody; but are &s;up|plied with Provi&s;ions from the whole Town, by the King's Order, 'till the Time of Mourn|ing is over. They &s;eem to have &s;ome Notion of the Devil, at lea&s;t are afraid of Apparitions; for none of 'em will &s;tir out of his Hut, when dark, without Company. And one Night in particular we heard a great Noi&s;e in the Town, like &s;everal Drums beating, which, the next Day, we found to be &s;ome of the <HI>Indians</HI> beating the Sides of their Hou&s;es, which were made of Hor&s;e-Skins, with large Sticks, in or|der to frighten away the Devil.</P>
<P>Each <HI>Indian</HI> has but one Wife, and they live together in a very loving Manner. When any of 'em lye-in, there's a Provi&s;ion made for them different from what they are acco|modated with at another Time; for the En|trance of the Hut, which at other Times is al|ways open, is &s;hut up with Hor&s;es-Skins as &s;oon as the Woman begins to be in Tra|vail; and no one goes in till &s;he comes out with the Child in her Arms, which is pre|&s;ently wrapt up in a Sheep's Skin, and, in&s;tead of a Bed or Cradle, is lain an a Machine &s;ome|what like our Hand-barrow, the Bottom of which is likewi&s;e covered with a Sheep's Skin. This is hung up by the four Corners,
<PB N="285" REF="007859_0307_102DE900C6CF58E0">and the Child &s;wings forwards and back|wards, in&s;tead of being rock'd in a Cradle, its Arms and Legs being fa&s;ten'd to this En|gine by a La&s;h of Hor&s;e-&s;kin, to prevent its falling over. By this Method of Treatment, when Children, the back Part of all the <HI>Indians</HI> Heads are very flat; for they never lay them but on their Backs. Perhaps it may be ow|ing to this likewi&s;e that there is not a crooked Per&s;on among&s;t them. In two or three Hours after they have lain-in they go about their u&s;ual Work. Every Morning they take all their Children, young and old, and carry them to the next Brook or rivulet adjoin|ing, and plunge them naked under Water, even when the ground is covered with Snow; by which Means they are harden'd to run a|bout naked, even in the Mid&s;t of Winter. The Men wear Beads and little Bells round their Neck, Wri&s;t, and &s;mall of their Legs; and the Women adorn their long Hair with the &s;ame. For &s;uch Trifles as the&s;e, toge|ther with Knives, Bra&s;s Pans, and &s;uch like, they traffick their Hides with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> when at Peace with them.</P>
<P>And now their Time for making the Hunt|ing Voyage approaching, which they conti|nually do every Spring, and generally &s;pend a whole Summer in taking their wild Hor&s;es,
<PB N="286" REF="007859_0308_102DE903EB9C0830">we made great Interce&s;&s;ion to go with them; but were given to under&s;tand, that we mu&s;t be &s;ent farther into the Country, to remain with other <HI>Indians</HI> till their return. But at la&s;t we prevailed, by a&s;&s;uring the Chief that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had Friends at <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> who would make him very hand&s;ome Satisfaction for us, and would redeem us at any Price he &s;hould put upon us. This &s;eemed to plea&s;e him, and he then con&s;ented. We were at pre&s;ent about 1000 Miles from <HI>Buenos Ayres;</HI> and their rout extends to the Ea&s;tern Coa&s;t of <HI>Patagonia,</HI> home to the Sea, about an hun|dred Miles to the Southward of <HI>Buenos Ayres.</HI> When they &s;et out, they carry with them e|very Thing belonging to them, Women, Chil|dren, Hou&s;es, and all. The&s;e la&s;t are &s;lung acro&s;s the Hor&s;es, and at Night taken down for &s;heltering them&s;elves from the Weather. They take with them a few Hor&s;es more than they ride, which &s;erve for maintaining them till their Hunting begins, which &s;el|dom happens till they have travelled &s;even or eight Days.</P>
<P>And now the wi&s;h'd for Time was come, when we all &s;et out in a Body, except <HI>John Duck,</HI> who&s;e Misfortune it was to be too near of a Complexion with tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> (for he was a <HI>Molat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o,</HI> born in <HI>London</HI>) for which
<PB N="287" REF="007859_0309_102DE9059364F358">rea&s;on he was &s;old by the Chief to a Ma&s;ter farther up in the Country; where, I believe, he will end his Days, there being no Pro&s;pect of his ever returning to <HI>England.</HI> We had travell'd ten or twelve Days before we had a|ny wild Hor&s;es; but &s;oon after &s;everal Strag|glers &s;ell Victims to their Ingenuity. Their Method of taking them is really a&s;toni&s;hing, and worthy of a very particular De&s;cription. As they are excellent Hor&s;emen, and their Hor|&s;es as fleet as the wild Ones, 'tis very &s;eldom they mi&s;s, tho' now and then an Accident of that Kind happens; but the rider is look'd upon with Contempt. They have two different Me|thods of taking them, each of which I have &s;een them perform with incredible Dexteri|ty. The fir&s;t is with a La&s;h of Hor&s;e Skins, about two Inches Broad, and fifty Feet long, with a running Noo&s;e at one End of it. This Noo&s;e they hold in their right Hand, and the other End in the Left, till they come within a few Yards of the Bea&s;t, when they throw the Noo&s;e over his Head, even on full Speed, and hold the other End fa&s;t in their Left Hand. The Bea&s;t is &s;oon &s;topt and taken. The other Method is with a narrow Strap of Hor&s;e-&s;kin, about twelve Feet long, to each End of which is fa&s;tened a round Ball of Iron, about two Pounds Weight. When within
<PB N="288" REF="007859_0310_102DE9087757A9E0">Di&s;tance of their Game, they hurl one of the Balls &s;everal Times round their Head, till they have got the proper Swing, and then throw it at the Hor&s;e's Legs, parting with the Ball in their Left Hand at the &s;ame Time; which &s;eldom fails of entangling their Legs, and throwing them to the Ground. The Hor&s;es thus taken are &s;ecured by &s;ome of the Company, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s is chiefly to tie the&s;e Hor&s;es together in a String, and guard them. In a few Days they become very tame. They are likewi&s;e very dextrous in killing Birds with the&s;e Balls, and will throw them to a prodigious Height in the Air. This is what they are trained up to from their Infan|cy, and are very expert at, even in their Youth. The&s;e Iron Balls, fa&s;ten'd in the above Man|ner, are likewi&s;e their chief warlike Wea|pons, next to their Bows and Arrows.</P>
<P>Being now arrived within an hundred Miles of <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> we begged of him to di&s;patch one of his Men to the Governor, to acquaint him of three <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners he had with him at &s;uch a Di&s;tance, and to a&s;k if he would redeem us; which he did. And the Me&s;&s;en|ger, on his return, brought him a certain Pledge for fulfilling his Promi&s;e, which was a Gold-laced Wai&s;tcoat. Next Day we were told to get our&s;elves ready to go to <HI>Buenos
<PB N="289" REF="007859_0311_102DE90B0E7ED890">Ayres,</HI> and that he and &s;ome of his Men would go with us.</P>
<P>The Hopes of once more &s;eeing our Fel|low Chri&s;tians filled us with Joy. We were brought immediately before the Governor, who &s;atisfy'd our <HI>Indian</HI> Prince, and paid him his ran&s;om, which was ninety Dollars, and a few Trifles, and then di&s;mi&s;s'd him. We return'd him our hearty Thanks for his Kindne&s;s towards us during our abode with him; in which Time we were treated with greater Humanity, than we afterwards met with in our long Confinement on board the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Admiral <HI>Pizarro.</HI></P>
<P>After we had pa&s;s'd Examination by the Governor, and had given him a full Account of our pa&s;t Misfortunes, we were for a &s;hort Time di&s;mi&s;s'd upon Parole. And here I &s;hould be very ungrateful if I did not do Ju&s;|tice to the Pre&s;ident of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> A&s;&s;iento Hou&s;e, Mr. <HI>Grey,</HI> by acknowledging that 'twas entirely owing to his Compa&s;&s;ion and kind In|terce&s;&s;ion with the Governor, that we were thus redeemed from the Hands of the <HI>Indians,</HI> he offering to do it at his own Charge. We were &s;ent for &s;everal Times before the Go|vernor, and earne&s;tly pre&s;t to turn Catholicks, and &s;erve the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> but our An|&s;wer was, we were Prote&s;tants, and true <HI>En|gli&s;hmen,</HI>

When he found all his Efforts were of no Effect, we were &s;ent as Pri&s;oners of War on board the <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> which lay then at <HI>Monte Vedio,</HI> about thirty Leagues down the river, waiting for Orders, and had lain there upwards of two Years. This was the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Admiral <HI>Pizarro</HI>'s Ship, which, after an un&s;ucce&s;sful Attempt to pa&s;s <HI>Cape Horn,</HI> in order to be in the <HI>South Seas</HI> with his Squadron before ours, was, by tem|pe&s;tuous Weather, drove back, and obliged to put into the river <HI>Plate,</HI> having lo&s;t near half her Crew; the Admiral having quitted her, and gone over Land to <HI>Chili.</HI></P>
<P>We were confin'd on board the <HI>A&s;ia</HI> above a Year, with 16 other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners, in which Time we were treated more like Slaves than Pri&s;oners of War. Our Bu&s;ine&s;s was to do all their na&s;ty Work; to &s;wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and clean the Decks, fore and aft, every Morning; and, after the Work was done, were confin'd be|tween Decks, with a Centin over us, as tho' we had been Criminals, with a poor Allow|ance of Victuals. In &s;hort, our U&s;age was &s;o bad that we agreed with the re&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners to attempt our Liberty, tho' at the ri&s;que of our Lives. Accordingly one
<PB N="291" REF="007859_0313_102DE90F6A3B0CE8">Night we e&s;caped from our Guard, intend|ing to &s;wim a&s;hore, and travel to a <HI>Portu|gue&s;e</HI> Settlement on the North Side of the ri|ver, the Ship lying within a Quarter of a Mile of the Shore. My&s;elf and one more got &s;afe to Land; the others were di&s;covered before they got into Water. I was quite naked; the other had a Shirt wrapped round his Head. Before we got halfway to the Shore, a Gun was fir'd from the Ship to alarm the Town. We travelled till Two in the Morn|ing, and then lay down among the ru&s;hes. The Weather being very fro&s;ty, our Feet &s;well'd and full of Thorns, we could travel no farther. Soon after Day-light we met with &s;ome Men on Hor&s;eback, belonging to the Plantations, to whom we &s;urrendered our|&s;elves; and they took us behind them to their Hou&s;e. The next Day we were carried from thence by &s;ome Soldiers, who were &s;ent in Pur&s;uit of us, and were carried on board the Ship; where we were put in the Stocks, Neck and Heels, Four Hours every Day for a Fortnight.</P>
<P>At length we were inform'd of the Admi|ral's Arrival at <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> who &s;oon after came on board, and gave Orders for refitting the Ship in the be&s;t Manner they could, being determin'd to carry her to <HI>Old Spain.</HI> But
<PB N="292" REF="007859_0314_102DE9126375E950">there was a geat Deficiency of Hands, for which rea&s;on Orders were given to impre&s;s what Men they could at <HI>Monte Vedio.</HI> The&s;e, with the 11 <HI>Indians</HI> whom they had four Months before taken Pri&s;oners in a Skirmi&s;h at a Di&s;tance from <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> whom they de&s;ign'd for their Row Gallies, were &s;ent on board; and &s;oon after I had the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing my Brother Mid&s;hipman Mr <HI>Campbell,</HI> who was lo&s;t in the <HI>Wager</HI> with us, but chu|&s;ing to follow the Fortune of Capt. <HI>Cheap,</HI> ar|rived with him at <HI>Chili.</HI> He came by Land from <HI>Chili</HI> with &s;ome Officers belonging to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Admiral, and arrived in <HI>March</HI> at <HI>Bu|enos Ayres.</HI> The latter End of <HI>October</HI> fol|lowing, 1745, we &s;et &s;ail from <HI>Monte Vedio</HI> in the <HI>A&s;ia</HI> bound for <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Three Days after we &s;ailed, an Affair hap|pened on board, which was like to have pro|ved fatal to the whole Crew; for about Nine at Night, we were alarmed with the Cry of a Mutiny; and &s;o indeed it proved: But &s;uch a one as would never have been &s;u&s;pected by any of the Ship's Crew, or per|haps credited by Po&s;terity, if &s;uch a Number of Per&s;ons were not &s;till living to atte&s;t the Fact. But, le&s;t I &s;hould do Inju&s;tice to the Memory of &s;uch a &s;urpri&s;ing Event, I &s;hall beg Leave to relate it in the Language of Mr.
<PB N="293" REF="007859_0315_102DE914700716F8"><HI>Walters,</HI> a&s;&s;uring the reader that I was a Wit|ne&s;s to the whole Affair.</P>
<P>"<HI>Pizarro</HI> had not yet compleated the Se|ries of his Adventures; for when he and <HI>Mendinuetta</HI> came back by Land from <HI>Chili</HI> to <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> in the Year 1745, they found at <HI>Monte Vedio</HI> the <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> which near three Years before they had left there. This Ship they re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to carry to <HI>Europe;</HI> and with this View they refitted her in the be&s;t manner they could. But their great Dif|ficulty was to procure a &s;ufficient Number of Hands to navigate her; for all the remaining Sailors of the Squadron to be met with in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> did not a|mount to an hundred Men. They endeavour|ed to &s;upply this Defect by pre&s;&s;ing and put|ting on board many of the Inhabitants of <HI>Bu|enos Ayres,</HI> be&s;ides all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners then in their Cu&s;tody, together with a Num|ber of <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Smugglers, whom they had taken at different Times, and &s;ome of the <HI>In|dians</HI> of the Country. Among the&s;e la&s;t was a Chief and ten of his Followers, who had been &s;urprized by a Party of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Soldiers about three Months before. The Name of this Chief was <HI>Orellana.</HI> He belonged to a very powerful Tribe which had committed great ravages in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Buenos Ayres.</HI>
<PB N="294" REF="007859_0316_102DE91619095CE0">With this motley Crew (all of them, except the <HI>European Spaniards,</HI> extremely aver&s;e to the Voyage) <HI>Pizarro</HI> &s;et &s;ail from <HI>Monte Ve|dio,</HI> in the <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Plate,</HI> about the beginning of <HI>November,</HI> 1745. And the native <HI>Spaniards,</HI> being no Strangers to the Di&s;&s;atisfaction of their forced Men, treated both the&s;e, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners, and the <HI>Indians,</HI> with great In&s;o|lence and Barbarity; but more particularly the <HI>Indians:</HI> For it was common for the meane&s;t Officers in the Ship to beat them mo&s;t cruel|ly, on the &s;lighte&s;t Pretences, and oftentimes only to exert their Superiority. <HI>Orellana</HI> and his Followers, tho' in Appearance &s;ufficiently patient and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, meditated a &s;evere re|venge for all the&s;e Inhumanities. As he con|ver&s;ed very well in <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> (the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> ha|ving in Times of Peace, a good Intercour&s;e with <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI>) he affected to talk with &s;uch of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as under&s;tood that Lan|guage, and &s;eemed very de&s;irous of being in|formed how many <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> there were on board, and which they were. As he knew that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were as much Enemies to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> as him&s;elf, he had doubtle&s;s an Intention of di&s;clo&s;ing his Purpo&s;e to them, and making them Partners in the Scheme he had projected for revenging his Wrongs and recovering his Liberty. But having &s;ounded
<PB N="295" REF="007859_0317_102DE919ED1E9920">them at a Di&s;tance, and not finding them &s;o precipitate and vindictive as he expected, he proceeded no further with them; but re&s;olved to tru&s;t alone to the re&s;olution of his ten faith|ful Followers. The&s;e, it &s;hould &s;eem, readi|ly engaged to ob&s;erve his Directions, and to execute whatever Commands he gave them. And, having agreed on the Mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;a|ry to be taken, they fir&s;t furni&s;hed them&s;elves with <HI>Dutch</HI> Knives, &s;harp at the Point, which being the common Knives u&s;ed in the Ship, they found no Difficulty in procuring. Be|&s;ides this, they employed their Lei&s;ure in &s;e|cretly cutting out Thongs from raw Hides, of which there were great Numbers on board, and in fiting to each End of the&s;e Thongs the double headed Shot of the &s;mall Quarter-Deck Guns. This, when &s;wung round their Heads, according to the Practice of their Country, was a mo&s;t mi&s;chievous Weapon, in the U&s;e of which the <HI>Indians</HI> about <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> are train'd from their Infancy, and con&s;equently are extremely expert. The&s;e Particulars be|ing in good Forwardne&s;s, the Execution of their Scheme was perhaps precipitated by a particular Outrage committed on <HI>Orellana</HI> him&s;elf. For one of the Officers, who was a very brutal Fellow, ordered <HI>Orellana</HI> aloft, which being what he was incapable of per|forming,
<PB N="296" REF="007859_0318_102DE91B9673D938">the Officer, under Pretence of his Di&s;obedience, beat him with &s;uch Violence that he left him bleeding on the Deck, and &s;tupified for &s;ome Time with his Brui&s;es and Wounds. This U&s;age undoubtedly heighten|ed his Thir&s;t for revenge, and made him eager and impatient till the Means of executing it were in his Power; &s;o that, within a Day or two after this Incident, he and his Fol|lowers opened their de&s;perate re&s;olves in the en&s;uing Manner.</P>
<P>"It was about Nine in the Evening, when many of the principal Officers were on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Quarter-Deck, indulging in the Fre&s;hne&s;s of the Night Air; the Wai&s;t of the Ship was filled with live Cattle; and the Foreca&s;tle was manned with its cu&s;tomary Watch. <HI>Orellana</HI> and his Companions under Cover of the Night, having prepared their Weapons, and thrown off their Trow&s;ers and the more cum|berous Part of their Dre&s;s, came altogether on the Quarter-Deck, and drew towards the Door of the Great Cabbin. The Boat&s;wain immediately reprimanded them, and order'd them to be gone. On this <HI>Orellana</HI> &s;poke to his Followers in his Native Language; when four of them drew off, two towards each Gang-way, and the Chief and the &s;ix remain|ing <HI>Indians</HI> &s;eemed to be &s;lowly quitting the
<PB N="297" REF="007859_0319_102DE91D41643768">Quarter Deck. When the detached <HI>Indians</HI> had taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Gang-way, <HI>Orella|na</HI> placed his Hands hollow to his Mouth, and bellowed out the War-Cry u&s;ed by the&s;e Sa|vages, which is the har&s;he&s;t and mo&s;t terri|fying Sound known in Nature. This hideous Yell was the Signal for beginning the Ma&s;|&s;acre: For on this they all drew their Knives, and brandi&s;h'd their prepared double Head|ed Shot; and the &s;ix, with their Chief, which remained on the Quarter-Deck, immediately fell on the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who were intermingled with them, and laid near forty of them at their Feet; of which about twenty were kill|ed on the Spot, and the re&s;t di&s;abled. Ma|ny of the Officers in the Beginning of the Tumult, pu&s;hed into the great Cabin; where they put out the Lights, and barricadoed the Door; and of the others, who had avoided the fir&s;t Fury of the <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;ome endeavour|ed to e&s;cape along the Gangways into the Foreca&s;tle; but the <HI>Indians,</HI> placed there on Purpo&s;e, &s;tabbed the greate&s;t Part of them as they attempted to pa&s;s by, or forced them off the Gangways into the Wai&s;t: Others threw them&s;elves voluntarily over the Barrica|does into the Wai&s;t, and thought them&s;elves happy to lie concealed among the Cattle: But the greate&s;t Part e&s;caped up the Main Shrowds,
<PB N="298" REF="007859_0320_102DE9202D6DF970">and &s;heltered them&s;elves either in the Tops or rigging. And tho' the <HI>Indians</HI> attack|ed only the Quarter-Deck, yet the Watch in the Foreca&s;tle, finding the Communication cut off, and being terrified by the Wounds of the few who, not being killed on the Spot, had Strength &s;ufficient to force their Pa&s;&s;age along the Gangways, and not knowing either who their Enemies were, or what were their Numbers, they likewi&s;e gave all over for lo&s;t, and, in great Confu&s;ion, ran up into the rig|ging of the Forema&s;t and Bow&s;prit.</P>
<P>"Thus, the&s;e eleven <HI>Indians,</HI> with a re&s;o|lution perhaps without Example, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, almo&s;t in an In&s;tant, of the Quar|ter-Deck of a Ship mounting &s;ixty &s;ix Guns, with a Crew of near five hundred Men, and continued in peaceable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Po&s;t a con&s;iderable Time: For the Officers in the Great Cabin (among whom were <HI>Pizarro</HI> and <HI>Mindinuetta</HI>) the Crew between Decks, and tho&s;e who had e&s;caped into the Tops and rigging, were only anxious for their own Safe|ty, and were for a long Time incapable of forming any Project for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the In&s;ur|rection, and recovering the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ship. It is true, the Yells of the <HI>Indians,</HI> the Groans of the Wounded, and the confu&s;ed Clamours of the Crew, all heighten'd by the
<PB N="299" REF="007859_0321_102DE922CBE55D48">Ob&s;curity of the Night, had at fir&s;t greatly magnify'd their Danger, and had filled them with the imaginary Terrors which Darkne&s;s, Di&s;order, and an Ignorance of the real Strength of an Enemy, never fail to produce. For as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were &s;en&s;ible of the Di&s;affection of their pre&s;t Hands, and were al&s;o con&s;cious of their Barbarity to their Pri&s;oners, they ima|gined the Con&s;piracy was general, and con|&s;ider'd their own De&s;truction as infallible; &s;o that, it is &s;aid, &s;ome of them had once ta|ken the re&s;olution of leaping into the Sea, but were prevented by their Companions.</P>
<P>"However, when the <HI>Indians</HI> had entirely clear'd the Quarter-Deck, the Tumult in a great mea&s;ure &s;ub&s;ided; for tho&s;e who had e&s;caped were kept &s;ilent by their Fears, and the <HI>Indians</HI> were incapable of pur&s;uing them, to renew the Di&s;order. <HI>Orellana,</HI> when he &s;aw him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Quarter-Deck, broke open the Arm-Che&s;t, which, on a &s;light Su&s;picion of Mutiny, had been ordered there a few Days before, as to a Place of the greate&s;t Security. Here he took it for grant|ed he &s;hould find Cutla&s;&s;es &s;ufficient for him|&s;elf and his Companions, in the U&s;e of which they were all extremely &s;kilful; and with the&s;e, it was imagined, they purpo&s;ed to force the Great Cabin. But on opening the Che&s;t,

There were indeed Cutla&s;&s;es in the Che&s;t, but they were hid by the Fire Arms being laid over them. This was a &s;en&s;ible Di&s;appointment to them; and by this Tme <HI>Pizarro</HI> and his Companions in the Great Cabin were capable of conver&s;ing aloud, thro' the Cabin Windows and Port|holes, with tho&s;e in the Gun-room and be+tween Decks; and from hence they learnt that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> (whom they principally &s;u&s;pected) were all &s;afe below, and had not intermeddled in this Mutiny; and by other Particulars they at la&s;t di&s;cover'd, that none were concern'd in it but <HI>Orellana</HI> and his People.

With this View <HI>Pizarro</HI> got together what Arms were in the Cabin, and di&s;tributed them to tho&s;e who were with him; but there were no other Fire-Arms to be met with but Pi&s;|tols, and for the&s;e they had neither Powder nor Ball. However, having now &s;ettled a Cor|re&s;pondence with the Gun-room, they lower|ed down a Bucket out of the Cabin Window,
<PB N="301" REF="007859_0323_102DE927667C3028">into which the Gunner, out of one of the Gun-room Ports, put a Quantity of Pi&s;tol Cartriges. When they had thus procured Ammunition, and had loaded their Pi&s;tols, they &s;et the Cabin Door partly open, and fired &s;ome Shot among the <HI>Indians</HI> on the Quarter-Deck, at fir&s;t without Effect; but at la&s;t <HI>Mendinuetta,</HI> whom we have often menti|oned, ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the good Fortune to &s;hoot <HI>Orellana</HI> dead on the Spot. On which his faithful Companions, abandoning all Thoughts of farther re&s;i&s;tance, in&s;tantly leaped into the Sea; where they every Man peri&s;hed. Thus was the In&s;urrection quelled, and the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Quarter-Deck regained, after it had been full two Hours in the Power of this Great and daring Chief, and his gallant and unhap|py Countrymen."</P>
<P>After this all was quiet; and the Admiral, finding that none of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were engaged in this In&s;urrection, for a few Days treated us with a little Humanity, endeavouring to en|gage us, by large Promi&s;es of Preferment, to enter into the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Service. But finding nothing would work on us, we afterwards felt the Smart of his re&s;entment by a &s;evere U&s;age.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable happened afterwards, more than what commonly happens at Sea, till
<PB N="302" REF="007859_0324_102DE9290E7026D8">we arrived at <HI>Concubene,</HI> a Harbour about Five Leagues to the South of Cape <HI>Fini&s;terre;</HI> which was the latter End of <HI>February,</HI> 1745-6.</P>
<P>We begged to be &s;ent a&s;hore as Pri&s;oners of War, but were told we mu&s;t go in the Ship to the <HI>Groyne.</HI> Whereupon we all went in a Body on the Quarter Deck, and told the Admi|ral, if he would not &s;end us a&s;hore, we would be no longer Slaves on board. Next Day we were &s;ent a&s;hore, and confined fifteen Days in a Pri&s;on, with an Allowance only of Bread and Water, and chained together as Criminals, till the Ship &s;ail'd for the <HI>Groyne;</HI> when we were relea&s;ed from our Dungeon, and guard|ed to the <HI>Groyne</HI> by Land with a File of Mu&s;|queteers.

<P>In Eight Days we got to <HI>Oporto,</HI> and made Application to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;ul, who, after hearing the Hard&s;hips we had gone
