<P>THERE are in every country certain important cri&s;es when exertion or neglect mu&s;t produce con&s;equences of the utmo&s;t moment. The period at which the inhabitants of the&s;e &s;tates have now arrived, will be admitted by every attent|ive and &s;erious mind to be clearly of this de&s;cription.</P>
<P>Our money ab&s;orbed by a wanton con|&s;umption of imported luxuries, a fluctuat|ing
<PB N="6" REF="020306_0005_0FAE99CA4E24C210">paper medium &s;ub&s;tituting in its &s;tead, foreign commerce extremely circum&s;crib|ed and a foederal government not only in|effective but disjointed, tell us indeed too plainly that further negligence may ruin us forever. Impre&s;&s;ed with this view of our affairs, the writer of the following pages has ventured to intrude upon the public. But as neither his time nor op|portunities will permit him to treat of all the great objects, which excite his appre|hen&s;ions or engage his wi&s;hes, he means principally to confine him&s;elf to that part of them, which have been mo&s;t &s;ubjected to his ob&s;ervations and enquiries.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t opinions on our general affairs, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily precede &s;uch a wi&s;e &s;y&s;|tem of commercial regulations, as will extend our trade to the greate&s;t length to which it can be carried without affecting
<PB N="7" REF="020306_0006_0FAE99CB15476728">unfavorably our other weighty intere&s;ts. It may therefore be u&s;eful in the fir&s;t place, to take a comparative view of the two mo&s;t important objects in the United States&mdash;our agriculture and commerce.</P>
<P>In a country ble&s;t with a fertile &s;oil, and a climate admitting &s;teady labour, where the cheapne&s;s of land tempts the European from his home, and the manu|facturer from his trade, we are led by a few moments of reflexion to fix on agri|culture as the great leading intere&s;t. From this we &s;hall find mo&s;t of our other ad|vantages re&s;ult, &s;o far as they ari&s;e from the nature of our affairs, and where they are not produced by the coercion of laws &mdash;the fi&s;heries are the principal exception. In order to make a true e&s;timate of the magnitude of agriculture, we mu&s;t re|member that it is encouraged by few or
<PB N="8" REF="020306_0007_0FAE99CBE701F258">no duties on the importation of rival pro|duce&mdash;that it furni&s;hes outward cargoes not only for all our own &s;hips, but tho&s;e al&s;o which foreign nations &s;end to our ports, or in other words, that it pays for all our importations&mdash;that it &s;upplies a part of the cloathing of our people and the food of them and their cattle&mdash;that what is con&s;umed at home, including the materials for manufacturing, is four or five times the value of what is exported &mdash;that the number of people employed in agriculture, is at lea&s;t nine parts in ten of the inhabitants of America&mdash;that there|fore the planters and farmers do form the body of the militia, the bulwark of the nation&mdash;that the value of property, occu|pied by agriculture, is manifold greater than that of the property employed in every other way&mdash;that the &s;ettlement of our wa&s;te lands, and &s;ubdividing our im|proved
<PB N="9" REF="020306_0008_0FAE99CCA49F1F40">farms is every year encrea&s;ing the pre-eminence of the agricultural intere&s;t &mdash;that the re&s;ources we derive from it are at all times certain and indi&s;pen&s;ibly ne|ce&s;&s;ary&mdash;and la&s;tly, that the rural life pro|motes health and morality by its active nature, and by keeping our people from the luxuries and vices of the towns. In &s;hort, agriculture appears to be the &s;pring of our commerce, and the parent of our manufactures.</P>
<P>The commerce of America, including our exports, imports, &s;hipping, manufac|tures and fi&s;heries, may be properly con|&s;idered as forming one intere&s;t. So un|informed or mi&s;taken have many of us been, that it has been &s;tated as the great object, and I fear it is yet believed to be the mo&s;t important intere&s;t of New-Eng|land. But from the be&s;t calculations I
<PB N="10" REF="020306_0009_0FAE99CD4F91D700">have been able to make, I cannot rai&s;e the proportion of property or the number of men employed in manufactures, fi&s;h|eries, navigation and trade to one-eighth of the property and people occupied by agriculture, even in that commercial quar|ter of the Union. In making this e&s;ti|mate I have deducted &s;omething from the value and population of the large towns for the idle and di&s;&s;ipated, for tho&s;e who live upon their incomes, and for &s;upernu|merary dome&s;tic &s;ervants. But the di&s;|proportion is much greater, taking the Union at large, for &s;everal of the &s;tates have little commerce, and no manufac|tures&mdash;others have no commerce and &s;carcely manufacture any thing. The timber, iron, cordage and many other ar|ticles nece&s;&s;ary for building &s;hips to fi&s;h or trade&mdash;nine parts in ten of their car|goes&mdash;the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the manufac|turers,
<PB N="11" REF="020306_0010_0FAE99CDF8E3CC08">and much of their raw materials are the produce of our lands. In almo&s;t all of the countries of Europe the mo&s;t ju|dicious writers have con&s;idered commerce as the handmaid of agriculture; and if true there, with us it mu&s;t be unque&s;tion|able. We have few manufactories to throw into the &s;cale again&s;t the landed in|tere&s;t. We have in our lands full employ|ment for our pre&s;ent inhabitants, and in|&s;tead of &s;ending colonies to new-di&s;cover|ed i&s;lands, we have adjoining town&s;hips and counties who&s;e vacant fields await the future increa&s;e of our people.</P>
<P>If a comparative view of the importance of our various intere&s;ts &s;hould terminate in a decided and great &s;uperiority of agricul|ture over all the re&s;t combined&mdash;if emi|gration and natural increa&s;e are daily add|ing to the number of our planters and farmers&mdash;if the &s;tates are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of mil|lions
<PB N="12" REF="020306_0011_0FAE99CEC765EBC0">of vacant acres, that court the cul|tivator's hand&mdash;if the &s;ettlement of the&s;e immen&s;e tracts will greatly and &s;teadily encrea&s;e the objects of taxation, the re|&s;ources, the powers of the country&mdash;if they will prove an inherent trea&s;ure of which neither folly nor chance can de|prive us, let us be careful to do nothing that can interrupt this happy progre&s;s of our affairs. Should we from a mi&s;con|ception of our true intere&s;ts, or from any other cau&s;e, form a &s;y&s;tem of commercial regulations, prejudicial to this great ma&s;s of property, and to this great body of the people, we mu&s;t injure our country during the continuance of the error. I mu&s;t final|ly return, under the di&s;advantages of fur|ther changes, to that plan, which it mu&s;t be our &s;incere de&s;ire, as it is our &s;erious duty at this time to devi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="020306_0012_0FAE99CF8DDFCDB8">
While I feel an ab&s;olute conviction that our true intere&s;ts &s;hould re&s;train us from burdening or impeding agriculture in any way whatever, I am not only ready to admit, but mu&s;t beg leave to urge, that &s;ound policy requires our giving every encouragement to commerce and its con|nexions, which may be found con&s;i&s;tent with a due regard to agriculture.</P>
<P>The communication between the dif|ferent ports of every nation is a bu&s;ine&s;s entirely in their power&mdash;The policy of mo&s;t countries has been to &s;ecure this do|me&s;tic navigation to their own people. The exten&s;ive coa&s;ts, the immen&s;e bays and numerous rivers of the United States have already made this an important ob|ject, and it mu&s;t increa&s;e with our popu|lation
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The coa&s;ting ve&s;&s;els, entered at the cu&s;tom hou&s;e of Philadel|phia in the year 1785, were 567 fail; all the other entries of &s;ea ve&s;&s;els in the &s;ame year were 501.</NOTE>.&mdash;As the places at which the car|goes
<PB N="14" REF="020306_0013_0FAE99D2A0EC1DA8">of coa&s;ting ve&s;&s;els are delivered mu&s;t be &s;upplied with American produce from &s;ome part of the Union, and as the mer|chant can always have American bot|toms to tran&s;port the goods of the pro|ducing &s;tate to the &s;tate con&s;uming them, no interruption to the market of the planters and farmers can be apprehended from prohibiting tran&s;portation in fo|reign bottoms from port to port within the United States&mdash;A &s;ingle exception may perhaps be proper, permitting fo|reign ve&s;&s;els to carry from port to port, for the purpo&s;e of fini&s;hing their &s;ales, any goods that &s;hall be part of the car|goes they brought into the Union, from the la&s;t foreign place at which they load|ed. The fleets of colliers on the Briti&s;h coa&s;t evince the po&s;&s;ible benefits of &s;uch a regulation</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="020306_0014_0FAE99D37AABB6E0">
The con&s;umption of fi&s;h, oil, whale|bone and other articles obtained through the fi&s;heries, in the towns and counties, that are convenient to navigation, has become much greater than is generally &s;uppo&s;ed. I am informed that no le&s;s than five thou&s;and barrels of mackarel, &s;almon and pickled cod-fi&s;h, are vended in the city of Philadelphia annually; add to them the dried fi&s;h, oil, &s;permaceti candles, whalebone, &amp;c. and it will be found a little fleet of &s;loops and &s;choon|ers are employed in the bu&s;ine&s;s. The demand for the u&s;e of the inhabitants of tho&s;e parts of the Union to which the&s;e &s;upplies can be carried, is already con&s;i|derable, and the increa&s;e of our towns and manufactures will render it more &s;o every year. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our navigation we can be in no doubt of pro|curing the&s;e &s;upplies by means of our
<PB N="16" REF="020306_0015_0FAE99D49D090F48">own ve&s;&s;els. The country that interferes mo&s;t with us at our own market is Nova Scotia, which al&s;o, I am informed, has had &s;ome emigrants from our fi&s;hing towns &s;ince the decline of their bu&s;ine&s;s. Such encouragement to this valuable branch of commerce, as would &s;ecure the benefits of it to our own people, without injuring our other e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts, is certainly worth attention.&mdash;The Convention will probably find on con&s;ideration of this point that a duty or prohibition of foreign articles, &s;uch as our own fi&s;heries &s;upply, will be &s;afe and expedient.</P>
<P>The article in the Briti&s;h trade laws, which confines the importation of foreign goods to the bottoms of the country pro|ducing them, and of their own citizens, appears applicable to our &s;ituation. By means of tho&s;e two flags we &s;hould be
<PB N="17" REF="020306_0016_0FAE99D4B47E7A00">certain of the nece&s;&s;ary importations, and we &s;hould throw out of each department of the carrying trade every competitor, except the &s;hips of the nation by which the goods were rai&s;ed or manufactured. All trade with &s;everal countries, &s;uch as China and India, who&s;e ve&s;&s;els &s;eldom or never make foreign voyages, would be &s;ecured into our hands. It will be found, that an application of this regulation in practice, will be attended with no diffi|culties or inconveniencies, and be&s;ides the immediate benefits already mentioned, our merchants will be led directly to the original market for the &s;upplies of which we &s;tand in need. In&s;tead of purcha&s;|ing the goods of Ru&s;&s;ia or the Ea&s;t-Indies in England, France or Holland, our own &s;hips will &s;ail directly to the fountain from whence they have flowed to us through foreign channels. The credits
<PB N="18" REF="020306_0017_0FAE99D58120E508">given us in Europe after the peace, kept us in the practice of going to a very few places, for all our importations. But they have tru&s;ted us in many in&s;tances at a dear rate indeed, and however u&s;eful cre|dit may be as a &s;upplement to our means of trade in this young country, it is very certain that we &s;hould fir&s;t lay out to the be&s;t advantage our funds in hand.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the principal encouragements to foreign commerce, which occur to me at pre&s;ent as proper to form a part of a permanent &s;y&s;tem for the United States. Regulations for temporary purpo&s;es, &s;uch as re&s;trictions and prohibitions affecting particular nations, I do not mean to &s;peak of here. I mu&s;t however ob&s;erve, that they &s;hould be adopted with great pru|dence and deliberation, as they may affect us very unfavorably, if they &s;hould be
<PB N="19" REF="020306_0018_0FAE99D634BE6930">tried in vain. In taking mea&s;ures to pro|mote manufactures, we mu&s;t be careful that the injuries to the general intere&s;ts of commerce do not exceed the advantages re&s;ulting from them. The circum&s;tances of the country, as they relate to this bu|&s;ine&s;s, &s;hould be di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately and tho|roughly examined. Tho' it is confe&s;&s;ed, that the United States have full employ|ment for all their citizens in the exten&s;ive field of agriculture, yet as we have a va|luable body of manufacturers already here, as many more will probably emigrate from Europe, who will chu&s;e to continue at their trades, and as we have &s;ome citi|zens &s;o poor as not to be able to effect a little &s;ettlement on our wa&s;te lands, there is a real nece&s;&s;ity for &s;ome whole&s;ome ge|neral regulations on this head. By tak|ing care not to force manufactures in tho&s;e &s;tates, where the people are fewer, tillage
<PB N="20" REF="020306_0019_0FAE99D70EC72460">much more profitable, and provi&s;ions dear|er than in &s;everal others, we &s;hall give a|griculture its full &s;cope in the former, and leave all the benefits of manufacturing (&s;o far as they are within our reach) to the latter. South-Carolina, for in&s;tance, mu&s;t manufacture to an evident lo&s;s, while the advancement of that bu&s;ine&s;s in Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts will give the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to many, who&s;e occupations have been ren|dered unprofitable by the con&s;equences of the revolution. A liberal policy on this &s;ubject &s;hould be adopted, and the produce of the &s;outhern &s;tates &s;hould be exchanged for &s;uch manufactures as can be made by the northern, free from impo&s;t.</P>
<P>Another inducement to &s;ome &s;alutary regulations on this &s;ubject, will be &s;ug|ge&s;ted by con&s;idering &s;ome of our means of conducting manufactures. Unle&s;s bu|&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="21" REF="020306_0020_0FAE99D7CAB9BA40">of this kind is carried on, certain great <HI>natural powers</HI> of the country will remain inactive and u&s;ele&s;s. Our nume|rous mill &s;eats, for example, by which flour, oil, paper, &s;nuff, gunpowder, iron|work, woolen cloths, boards and &s;cant|ling, and &s;ome other articles are prepar|ed or perfected, would be given by pro|vidence in vain. If properly improved, they will &s;ave us an immen&s;e expence for the wages, provi&s;ions, cloathing and lodging of workmen, without diverting the people from their farms&mdash;Fire, as well as water, affords, if I may &s;o &s;peak, a fund of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that cannot lie un|u&s;ed without an evident neglect of our be&s;t intere&s;ts. Breweries, which we can|not e&s;timate too highly, di&s;tilleries, &s;ugar hou&s;es, potteries, ca&s;ting and &s;teel fur|naces, and &s;everal other works are carri|ed on by this powerful element, and at|tended
<PB N="22" REF="020306_0021_0FAE99D876356930">with the &s;ame &s;avings, that were particularized in &s;peaking of water ma|chines&mdash;'Tis probable al&s;o that a fre|quent u&s;e of &s;team engines will add great|ly to this cla&s;s of factories. In &s;ome ca|&s;es where fire and water are not employ|ed, hor&s;es are made to &s;erve the purpo&s;e as well and on much lower terms than men. The cheapne&s;s and the ea&s;y en|crea&s;e of the&s;e &s;erviceable animals in&s;ure us this aid to any extent that occa&s;ion may require, which however is not like|ly to be very great.</P>
<P>The encouragement to agriculture, af|forded by &s;ome manufactories, is a rea|&s;on of &s;olid weight in favor of pu&s;hing them with indu&s;try and &s;pirit. Malt li|quors, if generally u&s;ed, lin&s;eed oil, &s;tarch (and were they not a poi&s;on to our mo|rals and con&s;titutions I might add corn,
<PB N="23" REF="020306_0022_0FAE99D934C9EA80">&s;pirits) would require more grain to make them, than has been exported in any year &s;ince the revolution&mdash;I cannot omit to ob&s;erve here, that beer &s;trengthens the arm of the labourer without debauching him, while the noxious drink now u&s;ed enervates and corrupts him&mdash;The work|ers in leather too of every kind, in flax and hemp, in iron, wood, &s;tone and clay, in furs, horn, and many other articles employ either the &s;pontaneous producti|ons of the earth or the fruits of cultiva|tion.</P>
<P>If we are convinced by the&s;e con&s;ider|ations, that regular factories of many kinds &s;hould be promoted in the mo&s;t &s;uitable parts of the Union, let us next con&s;ider whether the encouragements now held out to them are both &s;ufficient and proper. The neare&s;t rivals of our
<PB N="24" REF="020306_0023_0FAE99DA69FF7AE8">manufacturers are tho&s;e of Europe, who are &s;ubjected to the following charges in bringing their goods into our market&mdash; The merchant's commi&s;&s;ion for &s;hipping and the &s;ame for &s;elling, co&s;t of pack|ages, cu&s;tom hou&s;e papers in Europe, and the &s;ame with a duty of 5 per cent. here, porterages, freight, in&s;urance, damage, intere&s;t of money, wa&s;te, and lo&s;s on ex|change&mdash;The&s;e may be rated at 25 per cent on the lea&s;t bulky of our manufac|tures<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>We have no manufacture more compact than a piece of yard wide linen, equal to what co&s;ts 15<ABBR>d.</ABBR> &s;terling in Europe.

<P>In this calculation, wa&s;te, which of &s;ome articles is great, da|mages below 5 per cent. which the underwriters do not pay, in|juries not within the ri&s;que in&s;ured, difference of exchange now 6 per cent. above par, and other lo&s;&s;es on remitting, po&s;tages of letters, and bad debts on &s;ales at a long credit, as well as the profit of the importer are not taken notice of, though &s;everal of them re|ally occur in every importation.</P></NOTE>. Here is a &s;olid premium, operat|ing
<PB N="25" REF="020306_0024_0FAE99DB4BF5E3C0">like a bounty, while it happily co&s;ts the con&s;umer nothing, for the charges of importation are unavoidable and the du|ty being merely for the purpo&s;e of reve|nue, is applied to pay the public debts and expences of which he owes his pro|portion.
<PB N="26" REF="020306_0025_0FAE99DBA660CC70">This encouragement can only be encrea&s;ed by exempting raw materials from duty, which may be very &s;afe and proper and by additional duties and pro|hibitions, which would induce the lo&s;s of the revenue and an injury to morals from &s;muggling, and would throw upon the other members of the commercial intere&s;t and the cultivators and improvers of our lands an unnece&s;&s;ary burden. The ma|nufacturers are a ju&s;t and &s;en&s;ible body of men, and love their country. I feel a perfect confidence therefore, that when they &s;ee a &s;ub&s;tantial advantage of 25 per cent. in favour of their goods, which cannot be taken from them, they will de|&s;ire that government &s;hould refrain from further duties and prohibitions. This e&s;timate being made upon the fine&s;t of our manufactures, it is evident that the more
<PB N="27" REF="020306_0026_0FAE99DC77EBCBC0">bulky and weighty would &s;hew the ad|vantages of our own workmen in a yet &s;tronger light.</P>
<P>The clear air and powerful &s;un of Ame|rica is another advantage our manufacto|rers enjoy. When the linen and cotton branches &s;hall become con&s;iderable, a great &s;aving of time and money will be made by the climate, and where bleaching is effected principally by the &s;un and water, the quality of the cloth is known to be more excellent. The European proce&s;s by drugs and machines impairs the &s;trength. Ireland, I confe&s;s, with a cli|mate very different from ours, is remark|able for the quality of its linens, but they do not equal the American home&s;pun in &s;trength. In confirmation of the above opinion, I may mention that there was a plan formed before the revolution, by a
<PB N="28" REF="020306_0027_0FAE99DCF28FA250">number of Engli&s;h merchants of e&s;ta|bli&s;hing a company with a large capital, to import the brown linens of Europe to be bleached here for the &s;upply of our markets.</P>
<P>In this country the con&s;umer's money follows the delivery of the manufacture, therefore le&s;s capital is required. In e|very part of Europe exten&s;ive credits are given upon their goods. For though &s;ome nations have not got into the habit of tru&s;ting us, their own merchants are known to buy on ea&s;y terms of payment. France is perhaps as little accu&s;tomed to give the&s;e indulgencies as any other great country in Europe, yet nothing is paid for there, in le&s;s than two months, and the credits are extended from that time to twelve months according to the article. At the expiration of the term an accepted bill at &s;ixty days is con&s;ider|ed
<PB N="29" REF="020306_0028_0FAE99DED4D242E0">as prompt payment, &s;o that the actual term of credit is from four months to fourteen.</P>
<P>To the&s;e might be added &s;everal other little advantages, the joint benefits of which are &s;en&s;ibly felt, but I tru&s;t enough has been &s;aid to &s;atisfy the ju&s;t and pa|triotic mind, though concerned in the bu&s;ine&s;s, that a further addition of duties would not promote the general intere&s;ts of the country. I mu&s;t here beg leave however &s;trenuou&s;ly to recommend, that every duty on American produce or ma|nufactures, impoliticly and unkindly im|po&s;ed by the laws of &s;everal of the &s;tates, &s;hould be taken off, and that the ju&s;tice and &s;ound policy of the alteration &s;hould be declared and admitted in &s;ome public in&s;trument: And as &s;hips may be very properly con&s;idered as the greate&s;t article
<PB N="30" REF="020306_0029_0FAE99DF9D8C6848">we make, the tonnage on our own bottoms &s;hould be equalized throughout the Uni|on, and the extra duties on goods import|in ve&s;&s;els not belonging to the &s;tate in which they are landed, &s;hould be done a|way&mdash;Complaints again&s;t the trade laws of foreign nations come not con&s;i&s;tently from tho&s;e who lay &s;imilar burdens on their &s;i&s;ter &s;tates.</P>
<P>A further encouragement to manu|factures will re&s;ult from improvements and di&s;coveries in agriculture&mdash;There are many raw materials, that could be produced in this country on a large &s;cale which have hitherto been very confined. Cotton for many years before the revolution was not worth more than nine-pence &s;terling in the We&s;t-India I&s;|lands. The perfection of the factories in Europe has rai&s;ed it to &s;uch a pitch, that be&s;ides the prohibition again&s;t &s;hipping it
<PB N="31" REF="020306_0030_0FAE99E008777330">from the colonies to any foreign port, the price has ri&s;en fifty per cent. The con|&s;umers in Penn&s;ylvania have paid near two &s;hillings &s;terling for the importation of this year. This article mu&s;t be worth the attention of the &s;outhern planters.</P>
<P>If the facts and ob&s;ervations in the pre|ceding part of this paper be admitted to be true and ju&s;t, and if we take into con&s;idera|tion with them the acknowledged &s;uperior|ity of foreign commerce, and the fi&s;heries over our manufactories, we may come to the following conclu&s;ions&mdash;That the U|nited States of America cannot make a proper u&s;e of the natural advantages of the country, nor promote her agriculture and other le&s;&s;er intere&s;ts without manu|factures, that they cannot enjoy the at|tainable benefits of commerce and the fi&s;heries, without &s;ome general re&s;tricti|ons
<PB N="32" REF="020306_0031_0FAE99E0C1A41AE0">and prohibitions affecting foreign nations, that in forming the&s;e re&s;trictions and prohibitions, as well as in e&s;tabli&s;h|ing manufactories, there is occa&s;ion for great deliberation and wi&s;dom, that no|thing may be introduced, which can in|terfere with the &s;ale of our produce, or with the &s;ettlement and improvement of our wa&s;te lands.</P>
<P>Among the political con&s;iderations, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be admitted in treating of this &s;ubject, the force that may be required for our protection is not to be forgotten. It is certainly the greate&s;t that attends it. America, we may a&s;&s;ume, can have no inducement to engage in Eu|ropean wars. From our local &s;ituation we may keep our&s;elves long di&s;engaged from them. The principal European na|tions would find us an unprofitable and
<PB N="33" REF="020306_0032_0FAE99E1740788C8">trouble&s;ome enemy. The trade of France, Great-Britain, Spain, Holland and Portu|gal, which pa&s;&s;es by our coa&s;ts, are a &s;e|curity again&s;t their ho&s;tilities. A war a|mong them, in which we &s;hould take no part, would be more beneficial to our farmers, merchants and manufacturers than all the advantages we could obtain, if engaged in it our&s;elves. Our &s;hips would carry for them, or in&s;tead of theirs, and our lands and manufactories would furni&s;h the &s;upplies of their fleets and i&s;|lands in the We&s;t-Indies. To counter|balance the&s;e advantages, and to pay the expences of a war would require captures rich and numerous indeed, but what could compen&s;ate us for the drain of pea&s;antry and the lo&s;t opportunity of cultivating commerce and the arts of peace. A war merely offen&s;ive cannot be apprehended. &mdash;The fortune of the Briti&s;h arms again&s;t
<PB N="34" REF="020306_0033_0FAE99E254190118">America undi&s;ciplined and divided, will in&s;truct our enemies to beware of inva&s;i|ons after the military le&s;&s;ons taken from that long and &s;erious conte&s;t. Having no foreign colonies who&s;e &s;ituation and weakne&s;s would &s;ubject them to their at|tacks, and having all our re&s;ources at hand to defend our own coa&s;ts, and cut up their trade in its pa&s;&s;age by our doors, no Eu|ropean power will be inclined to in&s;ult or mole&s;t us&mdash;&s;hould any of them be &s;o in|&s;en&s;ible to their own intere&s;ts, as to de|part from the policy, which evidently ought to govern them, America, by act|ing in concert with the mo&s;t powerful ene|my of &s;uch ho&s;tile country, mu&s;t com|mence a war, which however inconveni|ent and di&s;agreeable to us, would be ru|inous to their We&s;t-India trade, and fatal to their colonies. We are not de&s;titute of re&s;ources and powers to injure them or
<PB N="35" REF="020306_0034_0FAE99E31A0D1910">defend our&s;elves. Our inland navigation, coa&s;ting trade and fi&s;heries, and the por|tion of foreign commerce we mu&s;t inevi|tably enjoy, are no incon&s;iderable nur&s;e|ries for &s;eamen. Good naval officers we &s;hould not want; they have never been &s;carce, and one happy effect of the revo|lution has certainly been to rai&s;e the re|putation of the marine life and to en|crea&s;e the talents and re&s;pectability of its followers. Foreign &s;eamen too, would find great temptations to enter on board our privateers and &s;hips of war, and might be hired in any numbers we could pay. The increa&s;e of the &s;trength and riches of the country, by filling up our vacant lands, is the infallible method by which the nece&s;&s;ary means may be acquired.</P>
<P>It will not be ami&s;s to draw a picture of our country, as it would really exi&s;t
<PB N="36" REF="020306_0035_0FAE99E3B95DC698">under the operation of a &s;y&s;tem of nation|al laws formed upon the&s;e principles. While we indulge our&s;elves in the con|templation of a &s;ubject at once &s;o intere&s;t|ing and dear, let us confine our&s;elves to &s;ub&s;tantial facts, and avoid tho&s;e plea&s;ing delu&s;ions into which the &s;pirits and feel|ings of our countrymen have too long mi&s;led them.</P>
<P>In the foreground we &s;hould find the ma&s;s of our citizens the cultivators (and what is happily for us in mo&s;t in&s;tances the &s;ame thing) the independent proprie|tors of the &s;oil. Every wheel would ap|pear in motion that could carry forward the intere&s;ts of this great body of our peo|ple, and bring into action the inherent powers of the country. A portion of the produce of our lands would be con&s;umed in the families or employed in the bu&s;i|ne&s;s
<PB N="37" REF="020306_0036_0FAE99E4740F1278">of our manufacturers&mdash;a further por|tion would be applied in the &s;u&s;tenance of our merchants and fi&s;hermen and other numerous a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and the remainder would be tran&s;ported by tho&s;e that could carry it at the lowe&s;t freight (that is with the &s;malle&s;t deduction from the aggregate profits of the bu&s;ine&s;s of the country) to the be&s;t foreign markets. On one &s;ide we &s;hould &s;ee our manufacturers encou|raging the tillers of the earth by the con|&s;umption and employment of the fruits of their labours, and &s;upplying them and the re&s;t of their fellow citizens with the in|&s;truments of their occupations, and the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life, in every in&s;tance where it could be done without injuriou&s;ly and unnece&s;&s;arily in|crea&s;ing the di&s;tre&s;s of commerce, the la|bours of the hu&s;bandmen and the difficul|ties of changing our native wilds into
<PB N="38" REF="020306_0037_0FAE99E545191D60">&s;cenes of cultivation and plenty. Com|merce on the other hand, attentive to the general intere&s;ts, would come forward with offers to range through foreign cli|mates in &s;earch of tho&s;e &s;upplies, which the manufacturers could not furni&s;h but at too high a price, or which nature has not given us at home, in return for the &s;ur|plus of tho&s;e &s;tores, that had been drawn from the ocean or produced by the earth.</P>
<P>On a review of the preceding facts and ob&s;ervations there appears to me rea&s;on to believe, that the nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures might be taken to render our farms pro|fitable and to improve our new lands, and that our manufactures, fi&s;heries, na|vigation and trade, would &s;till be con&s;i|derable. The long voyage by which all interfering foreign articles mu&s;t be brought to the&s;e markets, and the inevit|able
<PB N="39" REF="020306_0038_0FAE99E6479CA778">nece&s;&s;ity for a revenue, give us, as hath been demon&s;trated, a virtual bounty of 25 per cent. in favor of our own commo|dities, and this in the lea&s;t favorable in|&s;tances. When <HI>returning</HI> occonony, and the fall of rents, and provi&s;ions &s;hall have reduced the expences of living, when our increa&s;ing farms &s;hall have poured in their addition of raw materials, and we &s;hall have felt the &s;hortne&s;s of importation produced by the &s;uffering of our credit abroad, and by the check which has been given to foreign adven|turers in our trade, this difference of 25 per cent. will have a &s;en&s;ible effect. Be|ing rated on the whole value of the arti|cle, that is, as well on the labour as the raw materials, it is in fact 50 per cent. on the labour in all ca&s;es where the work|man&s;hip is half the value of the manufac|tured goods, and &s;o in proportion where it
<PB N="40" REF="020306_0039_0FAE99E6B3CBA8A8">is more. Beer, di&s;tilled liquors, pota&s;h, gun|powder, cordage, loaf &s;ugar, hanging and writing paper, &s;nuff, tobacco, &s;tarch, an|chors, nail rods, and many other articles of iron, bricks, tiles, potters ware, mill|&s;tones, and other &s;tone work, cabinet work, corn fans, Wind&s;or chairs, carriages, &s;ad|dlery, &s;hoes and boots, and other wearing apparel, coar&s;e linens, hats, a few coar&s;e woolen articles, lin&s;eed oil, wares of gold and &s;ilver tin and copper, &s;ome braziery, wool cards, worms and &s;tills, and &s;everal other articles may be con&s;idered as e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. The&s;e are tending to greater perfection, and will &s;oon be &s;old &s;o cheap as to throw foreign goods of the &s;ame kind entirely out of the market.</P>
<P>Many of the &s;ame circum&s;tances, that favour the manufacturer will render the fi&s;heries more profitable, and from the
<PB N="41" REF="020306_0040_0FAE99E880038270">cheapne&s;s of ve&s;&s;els, they will be carried on at le&s;s expence than in the few la&s;t years. The American market, where the con&s;umption (with population) is in|crea&s;ing fa&s;t, may be entirely &s;ecured to them. Our manufactories and towns will annually make larger demands for candles, oil, whalebone and pickled fi&s;h, and it may be policy, in cities where meat is yet &s;o dear, to introduce the con&s;umption of the dried cod. The Dani&s;h and French I&s;|lands, and the free ports in the We&s;t-In|dies, receive &s;ome of the produce of the fi&s;heries&mdash;France is likely to take off a con&s;iderable quantity, as al&s;o are the Spa|niards, Portugue&s;e and Italians, and the Engli&s;h will always want certain articles for their manufactories, though not to any great amount&mdash;New-England, the &s;eat of the fi&s;heries, has the great advantage of being the cheape&s;t and mo&s;t populous part
<PB N="42" REF="020306_0041_0FAE99E94070A008">of America. Its inhabitants are healthy, active and intelligent, and can be frugal; wherefore I am very much di&s;po&s;ed to be|lieve, that many factories will in the cour&s;e of a very few years revive their declining towns.</P>
<P>The commercial citizens of America have for &s;ome time felt the deepe&s;t di&s;|tre&s;s&mdash;among the principal cau&s;es of their unhappy &s;ituation were the incon&s;iderate &s;pirit of adventure to this country, which pervaded every kingdom in Europe, and the prodigious credits from thence given to our merchants. To the&s;e may be add|ed the high &s;pirits and the golden dreams that naturally followed &s;uch a war, clo&s;ed with &s;o much honor and &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;Tri|umphant over a great enemy, courted by the mo&s;t powerful nations in the world, it was not in human nature that America
<PB N="43" REF="020306_0042_0FAE99E9C8DD60F0">&s;hould immediately comprehend her new &s;ituation&mdash;really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the means of future greatne&s;s, &s;he anticipated the mo&s;t di&s;tant benefits of the revolution, and con|&s;idered them as already in her hands. She formed the highe&s;t expectations ma|ny of which however, &s;erious experience has taught her to relinqui&s;h, and now that the thoughtle&s;s adventures and imprudent credits from foreign countries take place no more, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An application of the foregoing ob&s;ervations to the commer|cial &s;ubject, can only be admi&s;&s;ible into this e&s;&s;ay.</NOTE> and time has been given for cool reflexion, &s;he will &s;ee her true &s;ituation and need not be di&s;couraged.</P>
<P>Our future trade may comprehend the fi&s;heries with the exclu&s;ive benefit of &s;upplying our own markets, as hath been already ob&s;erved. The coa&s;ting trade will be entirely &s;ecured to us. The right of bringing the commodities of foreign countries may be divided with the &s;hips
<PB N="44" REF="020306_0043_0FAE99EA74681F58">of the nation from whom they come, or in tho&s;e ca&s;es where they have no native &s;hips the carrying trade may be our own. The revolution has opened to us &s;ome new branches of valuable commerce. The intercour&s;e with France was next to none before the war, and with Ru&s;&s;ia, India and China not thought of. With activi|ty and &s;trict oeconomy we may pay Eu|rope with &s;ome of the <HI>produce</HI> of India, for a part of the goods with which they &s;upply us, and if we do not over-regulate trade, we &s;hall be an <HI>entrepot</HI> of cer|tain commodities for their We&s;t-India and &s;outh American colonies. Be&s;ides the&s;e objects all the manufacturing coun|tries and many free ports will be open to us, and we may adventure in foreign &s;hips to a con&s;iderable extent, though it would be more de&s;ireable to employ our own. As the propo&s;ed regulations would
<PB N="45" REF="020306_0044_0FAE99EB479832D8">compel the Briti&s;h or Dutch merchants, to import into the United States a part of the produce of France and Spain in American bottoms, &s;o may ours &s;erve the general intere&s;ts of their country by &s;ending tobacco to Sweden, or flour, rice and live &s;tock to the Briti&s;h colonies in the ve&s;&s;els of the re&s;pective nations.</P>
<P>The foundations of national wealth and con&s;equence are &s;o firmly laid in the United States, that no <HI>foreign</HI> power can undetermine or de&s;troy them. But the enjoyment of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tantial ble&s;&s;ings is rendered precarious by dome&s;tic cir|cum&s;tances. Scarcely held together by a weak and half formed foederal con&s;ti|tution, the powers of our national govern|ment, are unequal to the complete execu|tion of any &s;alutary purpo&s;e, foreign or dome&s;tic. The evils re&s;ulting from this unhappy &s;tate of things have again
<PB N="46" REF="020306_0045_0FAE99EC0D3C2B18">&s;hocked our reviving credit, produced a|mong our people alarming in&s;tances of di&s;|obedience to the laws, and if not remedied, mu&s;t de&s;troy our property, liberties and peace. Foreign powers, however di&s;po|&s;ed to favor us, can expect neither &s;atis|faction nor benefit from treaties with congre&s;s, while they are unable to en|force them. We can therefore hope to &s;ecure no privileges from them, if mat|ters are thus conducted. We mu&s;t im|mediately remedy this defect or &s;uffer exceedingly. De&s;ultory commercial acts of the legi&s;latures, formed on the impre&s;|&s;ion of the moment, proceeding from no uniform or permanent principles, cla&s;h|ing with the laws of the other &s;tates and oppo&s;ing tho&s;e made in the preceding year by the enacting &s;tate, can no longer be &s;upported, if we are to continue one people. <HI>A &s;y&s;tem which will promote
<PB N="47" REF="020306_0046_0FAE99ECB58A3CE0">the general intere&s;ts with the &s;malle&s;t in|jury to particular ones has become indi&s;|pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary.</HI> Commerce is more affected by the di&s;tractions and evils ari&s;|ing from the uncertainty, oppo&s;ition and errors of our trade laws, than by the re|&s;trictions of any one power in Europe. A negative upon all commercial acts of the legi&s;latures, if granted to Congre&s;s would be perfectly &s;afe, and mu&s;t have an excellent effect. If thought expedi|ent it &s;hould be given as well with re|gard to tho&s;e that exi&s;t, as to tho&s;e that may be divi&s;ed in future. Congre&s;s would thus be enabled to prevent every regulation, that might oppo&s;e the general intere&s;ts, and by re&s;training the &s;tates from impolitic laws, would gradually bring our national commerce to order and per|fection. Such of the ideas &s;ugge&s;ted in the preceding part of this paper, as &s;hall
<PB N="48" REF="020306_0047_0FAE99ED76BCF468">be honored with the public approbation, may be better dige&s;ted, and, if they appear worthy of it, may form new articles of con|federation, which would be the founda|tion of the commercial &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>I have ventured to hint at prohibitory powers, but &s;hall leave that point and the general power of regulating trade to tho&s;e who may undertake to con&s;ider the poli|tical objects of the Convention, &s;ugge&s;t|ing only the evident propriety of ena|bling Congre&s;s to prevent the importation of &s;uch foreign commodities, as are made from our own raw materials. When any article of that kind can be &s;upplied at home, upon as low terms as it can be imported on, a manufacture of <HI>our own produce,</HI> &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed, ought not by any means to be &s;acrificed to the intere&s;ts of foreign trade, or &s;ubjected to injury by
<PB N="49" REF="020306_0048_0FAE99EF78E9DEB8">the wild &s;peculations of ignorant adven|turers. In all ca&s;es careful provi&s;ion &s;hould be made for refunding the duties on ex|portation, which renders the impo&s;t a vir|tual exci&s;e without being liable to the ob|jections again&s;t an actual one, and is a great encouragement to trade.</P>
<P>The re&s;toration of public credit at home and abroad &s;hould be the fir&s;t wi&s;h of our hearts, and requires every oecono|my&mdash;every exertion we can make. The wi&s;e and virtuous axioms of our political con&s;titutions, re&s;ulting from a lively and perfect &s;en&s;e of what is due from man to man, &s;hould prompt us to the di&s;charge of debts of &s;uch peculiar obligation. We &s;tand bound to no common creditors. The friendly foreigner, the widow and the orphan, the tru&s;tees of charity and re|ligion, the patriotic citizen, the war-worn

Let her ap|ply all her re&s;ources to this great duty, and wipe away the darke&s;t &s;tain, that has ever fallen upon her. The general im|po&s;t&mdash;the &s;ale of the lands and every other unnece&s;&s;ary article of public property&mdash; re&s;training with a firm hand every need|le&s;s expence of government and private life&mdash;&s;teady and patient indu&s;try, with proper di&s;po&s;itions in the people, would relieve us of part of the burden, and ena|ble Congre&s;s to commence their payments, and with the aid of taxation, would put the &s;inking and funding of our debts with|in the power of all the &s;tates.</P>
<P>The violence committed on the rights of property under the authority of tender laws in &s;ome of the &s;tates, the famili|arity
<PB N="51" REF="020306_0050_0FAE99F129C77AF8">with which that pernicious mea|&s;ure has been recurred to, and the &s;hame|le&s;s per&s;everance with which it has been per&s;i&s;ted in after the value of the paper was confe&s;&s;edly gone, call aloud for &s;ome remedy. This is not merely a matter of ju&s;tice between man and man; it di&s;honors our national character abroad, and the en|gine has been employed to give the <HI>coup de grace</HI> to public credit. It would not be difficult perhaps to form a new article of confederation to prevent it in future, and a que&s;tion may ari&s;e whether fellow|&s;hip with any &s;tate, that would refu&s;e to admit it, can be &s;atisfactory or &s;afe.
