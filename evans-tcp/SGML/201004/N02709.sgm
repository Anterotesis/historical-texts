<P>UNDER the Con&s;ideration of the Shortne&s;s of the Life of Man, and the End for which he was created, engaged my Mind to the Lord that he would make known his Truth unto me, beyond Cu&s;tom or Tradition in which mo&s;t content them&s;elves. And though in the Time of Ignorance the Lord winks, and the Sincere in Heart in all Societies and Gatherings are owned by him, yet if he farther manife&s;ts him&s;elf, who &s;hall with&s;tand him? Tho' in Believing I made not ha&s;te, but de&s;ired to try all Things, and hold fa&s;t by that Univer&s;al Love I was then a Witne&s;s of, in which I tra|velled in my Sprit for the Freedom and

Yet re|joice not thou over &s;uch, but be warned by them, le&s;t thou al&s;o fall. Yet to the Glory of the Grace and Power of the Lord, who cau&s;es Good to redound from Evil to tho&s;e that love him (which does not excu&s;e the Evil-Doer) that many have known Deliverance from this Athe|i&s;tical Practice, and the Offence given by it, being thereby drove into the San|ctuary, where they have &s;een the Ground and Nature thereof, and the Fruit it brings forth, the End of which is for the Fire; Therefore with a &s;ingle Eye to the Lord, and as it concerns thy own E|ternal Welfare, let it have its due weight with thee before thy Day is determined, and receive it as a Token of Love, and in that Simplicity in which it is committed unto thee, in as few Words as my poor

<P>Our Friend <HI>George Fox,</HI> in a Ser|mon taken in Shorthand as it was prea|ched at a Monthly-Meeting in <HI>Barbados,</HI> tho' in the Beginning of Time, when ma|ny were convinced that had Slaves, he advi&s;ed them to u&s;e them well, and to bring them up in the Fear and Know|ledge of God, and after a rea&s;onable Ser|vice to &s;et them free, as we may al&s;o &s;ee in his <HI>Journal,</HI> pag. 354 which was far

from encouraging them to buy more after their Convincement: For if they had gone back again into that Trade, what had their Convincement done for them, but bring them into greater Judgment for their Di&s;obedience to the Manife&s;tation? For before Friends were a People, many of them were valiant Men with the Sword, for which they were had in great E&s;teem among&s;t Men, becau&s;e thereby they &s;ought the Nation's Deliverance from the Op|pre&s;&s;ion of Prie&s;ts, Phy&s;icians and Law|yers, the One making a Trade of the Soul, the Other of the Body, and the Other of the Property of the People: And when our Friend <HI>George Fox</HI> was called forth by the Lord to mini&s;ter, not in the Wi&s;|dom of Man, for in that he was unlearn|ed, but in the Openings of Truth, which manife&s;ted to him wherein all the&s;e were out of the Way, and that by the univer&s;al Grace all might be re&s;tored in their Services, both for the Good of Soul and Body; which cau&s;ed the&s;e Worthies to lay down their Swords, as unfit for the Carrying on of &s;o great a Work,

which mu&s;t be done by a higher Power, in which they went forth, having the Sword of the Spirit, which gave them Victory over Principalities &amp; Powers, and Spi|ritual Wickedne&s;&s;es in High Places: And while Friends &s;tood here, te&s;tifying again&s;t this Practice, and again&s;t every Thing that is high and lifted up, as incon&s;i&s;tent with this glorious Day, then did the Work pro&s;per, that large Meetings were &s;ettled herein and flouri&s;hed. But in Time this dark Trade creeping in among&s;t us, to the very Mini&s;try, becau&s;e of the Profit by it, hath &s;pread over others like a Lepro&s;ie, to the Grief of the Hone&s;t-hearted, that they are con&s;trained to &s;o|journ in Me&s;ech or dwell in the Tents of Kedar, the Habitation of Blood; which the hired Preachers that live by the Law, have te&s;tified again&s;t, as the highe&s;t Im|morality which &s;ome have gone into when all others have failed them, whereby their Hearers have keen convinced by them of the Evil of it.

<P N="1">I. MY FRIEND, Whom&s;oever Thou art that deals in <HI>Slaves,</HI> or hath had any Fellow&s;hip therewith, in the Love of God that de&s;ires the Peace and the Re&s;tora|tion of the whole Creation, do I now Salute Thee, that thou maye&s;t con&s;ider that Principle and Foundation on which this Practice &s;tands, &s;ince for every idle Word we mu&s;t give an Account, and on all our Actions are e&s;tabli&s;hed an Eter|nity, and whom&s;oever we yield our &s;elves to Obey, his Servants we are, whether of Sin unto Death, or of Obedience unto Life.</P>

(who became &s;uch by Rebellion) un|to Death and Hell, where he is Centred; from whom, all Wrath and Violence pro|ceeded. He was not Created &s;uch, nor his Angels, as is ob&s;erved in the Epi|&s;tle of <HI>Jude,</HI> that they fell from their fir&s;t E&s;tate, and from their Habitations God created them in: Which great Fall and Deba&s;ement to <HI>Lucifer,</HI> &s;o proud a Spirit that he is termed the Son of the Morning, and being thus defeated in his evil Purpo&s;e, rai&s;ed in him a Princi|ple of Envy again&s;t God, and all the Cre|ation, which the Lord made very good, according to his own Nature, and made Man the Top of the Creation, a living Soul, an Image of his own Eternity, who is all Love and Goodne&s;s in him&s;elf, and his Works are accordingly; and while Man &s;tood in this upright Life, all was perfect Peace and Love, throughout the whole Creation of God, until Evil was introduced by the In&s;inuations of the Ser|pent, that envy'd the Happine&s;s thereof, and enticed our fir&s;t Parents to Eat of the forbidden Fruit, that was good of it &s;elf, being created by the Lord, but Evil unto them, in that they di&s;obey'd the Holy Commandment.

in the De&s;truction of the Living, but thro' Envy of the Devil came Death into the World; and they that do hold on his Side, do find it &s;o, drawing it to them, by Di&s;obedience; as <HI>Eve</HI> immediately and <HI>Adam</HI> In&s;trumentally, giving Ear to the Temptation, whereby the Mind be|came captivated to Lu&s;t, which being Conceived brought forth Sin, and Sin fini&s;hed brought forth Death, both to the inward and the outward Man, and a Suffering and Degeneracy, throughout the whole Creation, which groans and travels in Pain to be Delivered, even un|til now, through the Evil Property and barbarous Di&s;po&s;ition of the Natural Man; yet through the Mercy and good Will of God, in the Promi&s;ed Seed of the Woman, he was not thus left, but put in a Capacity of being re&s;tored to his Original Purity and Uprightne&s;s, where|by he Governs the Creation, in Love and Tenderne&s;s, that they partake of the Benefit of his Redemption.</P>
<P N="3">III. And the&s;e two Births are emi|nently &s;hewed unto us in <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel; Abel</HI>'s Geniture being of the Lord, through the Promi&s;ed Seed, unto which he was united, gave his Sacrifice Accep|tance,

which rai&s;ed Envy in <HI>Cain,</HI> who rejecting this high Birth, as many now do, he became One with the Evil Pro|perty that was introduced by his Father the Devil; and his Works of Violence and Oppre&s;&s;ion (the height of Wicked|ne&s;s in re&s;pect to Men) he brought forth, which in Time &s;pread over the whole Earth, for which the Lord de&s;troyed them by the Deluge: And thus <HI>Cain</HI>'s Race ended, but his Image and Life re|mains in all them that Act in the &s;ame Principle.</P>
