<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is to be lamented that there are &s;o many <HI>Impo&s;ters</HI> in the world, which &s;ay, <HI>I have dreamed, I have dreamed,</HI> and perhaps have deceived &s;ome; but we &s;hall do well to attend to the Scriptures of Truth, which are a &s;ufficient rule of faith and practice, and able to make us wi&s;e unto &s;alvati|on. The Apo&s;tle tells us to believe no other doctrine but what we have al|ready received; for faith he, <HI>Though we or an Angel from Heaven preach any other Go&s;pel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accur&s;ed;</HI> Gal. i. 8.</P>
<P>IT appears by the life and conver|&s;ation of the Author of this piece, that his mind has been exerci&s;ed in a won|derful manner; for whereas he lately delighted in vice and folly, he is now quite the rever&s;e, and has given us rea&s;on to believe his words, partly by a me&s;&s;age done by him to his Bro|ther, telling him that his time was
<PB N="iv" REF="028509_0004_0FD92C62111E3F78">&s;hort on earth, and that he mu&s;t pre|pare for death, and in a very few days appear before GOD in the eternal world of &s;pirits. Acoordingly &s;oon after, it being in the month of March following, by an unhappy accident, he was drowned in <HI>Su&s;quehanna-Riv|er,</HI> which the people of <HI>Newtown</HI> af|firm to be true; and the VISION is mo&s;t &s;urely believed by tho&s;e who at fir&s;t were regardle&s;s of it, not allow|ing it to be true, nor him to be wor|thy of their approbation, rudely mak|ing him the topic of their di&s;cour&s;e: <HI>But</HI> GOD <HI>hath cho&s;en the fooli&s;h things of the world to confound the wi&s;e; and</HI> GOD <HI>hath cho&s;en the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and ba&s;e things of the world, and things which are de&s;pi&s;|ed hath</HI> GOD <HI>cho&s;en; yea and things which are not to bring to naught things that are, that no fle&s;h &s;hould glory in his pre&s;ence;</HI> 1 Cor. i. 27.</P>

<P>In thoughts from the vi&s;ions of the night, when deep &s;leep falleth on men&mdash;Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my hones to &s;hake&mdash;Then a Spirit pa&s;&s;ed before my face, the hair of my fle&s;h &s;tood up:&mdash;It &s;tood &s;till, but I could not di&s;cern the form thereof: An image was before mine eyes; there was &s;ilence, and I heard a voice, &amp;c.</P></Q>

FOR near two years before this uncommon thing happened to me, I was inclining to be|lieve there was neither Heaven or Hell, and grew &s;o hardened in my heart as to hate the <HI>Holy Bible,</HI> and was in a &s;trange temptation to ca&s;t away all thoughts of GOD, and give my|&s;elf up to all evil, concluding I &s;hould die like the bea&s;ts; but &s;till had &s;ome fear at times, which put me in great trouble, tho' I did not tell my tho'ts and feelings to any per&s;on for near two years; and I think I may &s;ay I was on the brink of ruin: But O the wonderful mercy of GOD, who &s;aw me in my doleful and lamentable &s;tate! And as my ca&s;e was &s;ingular, the merciful GOD dealt with me in a &s;ingular manner, to convince me of my folly. I think I may &s;ay as <HI>David</HI> &s;aid of old, <HI>Come unto me all you that fear the</HI> LORD, <HI>and I will tell you what great things he hath done for my &s;oul.</HI></P>
<P>JAN. 10th, 1791, at night I went to bed as u&s;ual, but &s;lept none 'till late, for trouble of mind; but &s;ometime late in the night, when the people were all a&s;leep, I was ri&s;en up in the bed, and was praying to GOD that if there was any Heaven or Hell I might in&s;tantly know it. As the words were in my mouth, I was &s;mitten with a heavy blow on my brea&s;t, which laid me backward on my
<PB N="7" REF="028509_0007_0FD92C68CE997510">bed: The &s;ame in&s;tant I &s;aw a man in the room with a bright &s;hining light around him, which appeared brighter than the &s;un, &s;hin|ing in his full &s;trength; and he &s;pake to me and &s;aid he knew all my vain thoughts before I told them to him, and bid me fear not and follow him; and in a moment my &s;pirit left my body and followed my Guide, who con|veyed me beyond the moon and &s;tarry regions: Then in&s;tantly I was carried to the mo&s;t-glorious City, which &s;hone with &s;uch bright|ne&s;s that it dazzled my eyes to behold it: Then I was brought to the bar of GOD's awful ju&s;tice, and CHRIST took his &s;eat on the right-hand of power; and I was called as a criminal to an&s;wer for my &s;ins. It appeared to me that the awful <HI>Judge</HI> opened a very great book, which contained the names of the righteous and the wicked; the former was on the right-hand, the latter on the left: Some of the names of the righ|teous were brighter than others; &s;ome &s;eem|ed to be dull: Tho&s;e of the wicked were all black. The <HI>Judge</HI> then pointed to my name, which was on the left hand, and bid me look and &s;ee it; and there I &s;aw my name, which was very black: I al&s;o &s;aw my &s;ins recorded in the book, and that I had been to very wicked frolicks; but the mo&s;t heinous &s;in was, that I hated the <HI>Holy Bible,</HI> and did
<PB N="8" REF="028509_0008_0FD92C6A07EB9680">not believe in CHRIST, or that there was a Heaven or Hell.</P>
<P>THEN I heard the awful <HI>Judge</HI> pronounce his glorious name JEHOVAH! which cau&s;ed the Heavens to rejoice and Hell to tremble; and he likewi&s;e &s;aid, if ever I made game of that <HI>Holy Name,</HI> I &s;hould never have a right there, and the gates &s;hould be forever &s;hut again&s;t me. All this time I &s;tood trembling to hear my doom, and I &s;aw all that was laid to my charge to be true, and GOD was ju&s;t in condemning me; my con&s;cience al&s;o bearing witne&s;s again&s;t me: But O the terrors that filled my &s;oul, none can tell, unle&s;s they were in my &s;oul's &s;tead!&mdash;It appeared to me that the <HI>Judge</HI> held over my head a great &s;word of ju&s;tice, ready to take vengeance on me: But in the mid&s;t of my fears, unexpected to me JESUS CHRIST came and kneeled down between me and the bar of GOD, and like a <HI>Mediator</HI> plead my cau&s;e in a mo&s;t affecting manner, and &s;aid, O <HI>Father,</HI> I have died for this &s;inner! And now, O <HI>Father,</HI> &s;pare this &s;inner! O <HI>Father,</HI> I &s;tand between him and the &s;troke of thy wrath!&mdash;O <HI>Father,</HI> why &s;hould he die!&mdash;And at the&s;e words of the <HI>Mediator,</HI> the ju&s;tice of GOD &s;eemed to be &s;ilent; and GOD was well plea&s;ed with what CHRIST had &s;aid on my be|half,
<PB N="9" REF="028509_0009_0FD92C6B1226B2B0">and CHRIST turned to me with a &s;miling face, and &s;aid, Your &s;ins are for|given, and your tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions I will remem|ber no more. Then he &s;hewed me, and bid me look and &s;ee the prints of the nails in his hands; this, &s;aid he, I bore for you: And at tho&s;e words of his, the heavenly ho&s;t &s;ung for joy, and CHRIST &s;aid, I was welcome as any to all the joys and plea&s;ures of the <HI>New-Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and I could not forbear to &s;ing among the re&s;t. I think I can &s;ay, <HI>There is more joy in Heaven over one &s;inner that re|penteth, than over ninety and nine ju&s;t per&s;ons that needeth no repentance.</HI></P>
<P>CHRIST &s;aid unto me you mu&s;t go back to the world again, and gave me a great charge to my Father and Family, that they &s;hould put away all &s;in, and live a praying life to GOD, or they &s;hould never come to that place. CHRIST &s;aid, that the Bible was his book, and it was all his, and it &s;hould remain to ages yet to come; and if any &s;hould add unto, or dimini&s;h from that book, he never &s;hould come to that glorious place. The people &s;ung after the manner of the chri&s;tian churches on earth; CHRIST <HI>died,</HI> &s;eemed to lead their &s;ong. I &s;aw there, men, women and children, and heard them &s;ing together; the little children &s;ung a ver&s;e of the Go&s;pel &s;onnet, which was as follows;
<PB N="10" REF="028509_0010_0FD92C6E777C0E48">
<Q><L>Babes rather caught from womb and brea&s;t,</L>
<L>Claim a right to &s;ing above the re&s;t,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e they found the happy &s;hore</L>
<L>They never &s;aw nor &s;ought before.</L></Q></P>
<P>CHRIST &s;aid he had &s;uffer'd for me in the world, and I mu&s;t be willing to &s;uffer for him: Then CHRIST took me by the hand, and walked &s;ome di&s;tance from the multi|tude; all which &s;hewed great reverence to him, for as he came toward them they cea&s;ed from their mu&s;ic, and aro&s;e and bow|ed their heads, and gave glory to him, that another &s;inner was &s;uffered to come. I &s;aw al&s;o that they gave glory to him, that they had obtained &s;alvation, and prai&s;ed him as their <HI>Savior</HI> and procurer of all they enjoyed in Heaven. When CHRIST came to the end of his walk, he let go my hand, and pointed toward a man that was yet fur|ther, and &s;at on his &s;eat, and &s;aid, that was the man that made the <HI>P&s;alms.</HI> I a&s;ked, if it was King <HI>David?</HI> He &s;aid, yea. He al&s;o &s;hewed me a man near the King, which was <HI>Nathan</HI> the Prophet, and this, &s;aid he, was my name, and when I &s;hould come here to &s;tay I &s;hould &s;ing with him: He walked back to the bar again, and I followed him. He a&s;ked me, if I were now &s;atis|fied there was a Heaven? I &s;aid I was. Then the <HI>Father</HI> &s;pake to the Son, and &s;aid
<PB N="11" REF="028509_0011_0FD92C73A4C35C98">he mu&s;t know that there is a Hell of woe. CHRIST put forth his hand, and hid me &s;tand thereon, and I did &s;o: Then he car|ried me &s;wift as lightning to Hell, and &s;at me down in the mid&s;t of the bla&s;pheming crew; and indeed as there is nothing on earth that can re&s;emble Heaven, &s;o there is nothing that can re&s;emble Hell: It is a place of woe, and the wretched creatures appeared to be in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s and torment: I heard them &s;cream, and cry, and lament, and cur&s;e the day they were born. I heard them bla&s;pheme again&s;t the GOD of Heaven, and it appeared very frightful, for they &s;eemed to be in full de&s;pair; which they &s;aid was never to be at an end, and they never expected to have any re&s;t: When thou&s;ands of years were pa&s;t, it was &s;till a begining. Some have thought that Hell was a place of fire and brim&s;tones altho' that is the mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters">able compari&s;on we can make, yet it is far &s;hort of what it is indeed, to the wrath of GOD and a guilty con&s;cience, which is their torments. It appeared to burn more terrible than fire.</P>

I SAW that old Serpent the Devil; he ap|peared to be &s;omething in human &s;hape, but black; his countenance appeared very fright|ful, and full of malice again&s;t CHRIST, and in appearance he had a chain about his neck, which &s;o bound him down that he could not ri&s;e up before CHRIST, but lay and growled in the greate&s;t mi&s;ery and torment.</P>
<P>I SAW that the damned crew were in fear of the day of judgment; for they &s;aid their puni&s;hment would then be increa&s;ed; and when I was in Hell I looked to &s;ee if there were any infants in that place, but &s;aw none: Then I a&s;ked CHRIST if there were any in|fants there? He &s;aid no; for I &s;aid I have heard &s;ome &s;ay, they believed there were. He &s;aid, I mu&s;t read his Bible where it &s;ays, <HI>Suffer little children to came unto me, and forbid them not, for of &s;uch is the kingdom of Heaven:</HI> Then CHRIST a&s;ked me if I were now &s;atis|fied that there was. Hell? I &s;aid I was: He put forth his hand, and I &s;eemed to &s;it thereon, and he brought me &s;wift as light|ning to my home, and I &s;aw it no more.</P>
<P>I WOULD &s;ay a few words to the candid and hone&s;t <HI>Reader;</HI> whether it may be a benefit to others I know not, but it is a reality to me, and is what I have &s;een and heard: If any &s;cruple the truth of it, it is all one to me, for I have had no thoughts of the prai&s;e of men in relating this &s;trange and uncommon <HI>Fact</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="028509_0013_0FD92C7953E89E60">and indeed I have been &s;o far from writing any thing that is not true, I have not wrote all that is true; nor is it po&s;&s;ible for me to point out to your view all that I &s;aw while I was there. But I &s;hall proceed to write a few words more: I &s;aw there faces of men which did &s;o much re&s;emble their faces when on earth, that they could ea&s;ily be known; I knew &s;ome of them. One man came and &s;poke to me and &s;aid he once lived near my Father's hou&s;e on earth: He &s;aid his name was <HI>Simeon Dunn.</HI> Al&s;o I &s;aw <HI>Dunn</HI>'s Mother at &s;ome di&s;tance from me; and <HI>Jonathan Hopkins, Barnabas Swea&s;ey</HI> and my Wife's Mother, in the realms of bli&s;s. When CHRIST led me on the heaven|ly ground he a&s;ked me if <HI>I</HI> had ever a child or earth? I told him I had. He pointed to a &s;mall child and &s;aid, there it is; and <HI>I</HI> heard it &s;ing the ver&s;e which <HI>I</HI> mentioned before. When CHRIST led me on, he &s;aid, all the laws of nature are di&s;&s;olved.&mdash;Where <HI>I</HI> &s;tood at the bar of GOD, his awful ju&s;tice appeared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">rible <HI>I</HI> could not endure his face and words. He appeared with terrible maje&s;ty and glory, and had <HI>I</HI> ten thou&s;and times the gift to &s;et it forth, and all the gifts of earth to help me, <HI>I</HI> could not di&s;play the glory and maje&s;ty which <HI>I</HI> &s;aw in him; for GOD is a <HI>Spirit</HI> infinite, eternal and unchangeable.</P>
