<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have given us lately a fine and ju&s;t Dialogu|e between a <HI>Dutch</HI> Magi&s;trate and a <HI>French</HI> Hugonot Preacher; let me here pre&s;ent you with one between a Clergyman and a Quaker. It lately happened at a Meeting of &s;ome Gentlemen of our Country; and I was &s;o taken with it, that as &s;oon as I came home, I recollected what had been &s;aid on both Sides, and think I have done both Sides Ju&s;tice. This Dialogue will &s;hew that the Quakers are not &s;uch contemptible Rea&s;oners as Men of more Learning and Name would gene|rally make them; and that good Sen&s;e is &s;uffi|cient Match for Art, and &s;ome Sorts of Education.</P>

<P>It is thy Fault, and the Fault of thy Bre|thren, if I do not. The Clergy have tran&s;lated it.</P>

<P>If the Clergy under&s;tand them, then are they not difficult to Laymen, who know all Lan|guages: And why do not the Clergy explain them?</P>

<P>That is to &s;ay, ALL Points. Even where you &s;ay, you believe alike, you explain different|ly; which &s;heweth a manife&s;t Difference al&s;o in believing.

<P>Nor can'&s;t thou. As to tho&s;e Places, tho' they may be his Will, yet I am &s;ure they are not his reveal'd Will, becau&s;e he hath not reveal'd it; and if I take thy Interpretation and Conjec|tures for his Word, then do I believe in thy Word, and not in his.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend, as thou art a Chri&s;tian, thou mu&s;t needs know that every Hou&s;e is alike to Almigh|ty God, who filleth Heaven and Earth, and dwel|leth not in Hou&s;es made with Hands: And as to what you call Ordinances, thou knowe&s;t that the Apo&s;tles admini&s;ter'd none. Every Man did it for him&s;elf, and it was done from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e. There were no bloody Sacrifices in the Religion of Je&s;us, and con&s;equently no Prie&s;ts, their only Office being to &s;lay Bea&s;ts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Dare you &s;ay that God has appointed no Bo|dy in his Church to preach and explain his Word?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; I neither do, nor dare &s;ay it; and thou may'&s;t &s;pare thy big Words. He hath left every Man to preach it to another; nor ha&s;t thou any more Call from him than every one of thy Pari&s;h hath. If thou would&s;t re&s;emble the Apo&s;tles, go and preach to the unconverted without Money, and without Price. Thy whole Pari&s;h believe in Chri&s;t already, as much as thou do'&s;t, and did before they knew thee. They have the Bible them&s;elves; and if thou bringe&s;t them any Ti|dings that are not in it, and that they them|&s;elves &s;ee not in it, they ought not to believe thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cler.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>You argue very in&s;incerely with me. Ju&s;t now you contended that I had none of St.</HI> Paul's <HI>Gifts; and now you would have me go without tho&s;e Gifts; and do what he did with them; namely, travel over the World, and convert the unconverted.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I only would &s;hew thee, that as thou do&s;t not re&s;emble him, thou art vain in pretending to &s;ucceed him; and &s;o far I rea&s;on con&s;i&s;tently, as thou do&s;t weakly, if thou claime&s;t all his Re|verence, without any of his Merit.</P>

If I am not mi&s;informed, they abound with young Men who are too often Sinners, and with old Men who are no Saints.

<P>Knowe&s;t thou any Divinity, but what is in the Bible? and have not I the Bible? I think, and am &s;ure, that it is a plain and intelligible Book, at lea&s;t as much of it as is meet for a Chri|&s;tian, and to turn it into Doubtfulne&s;s, and Di&s;|putation, and Science, and Gain, favoureth not of Chri&s;tianity.</P>

Riches may render them formidable; but Piety only, and a holy Conver&s;ation, can make them reverenced. Revenues do not place them above Contempt, but only encourage them to de&s;pi&s;e their People.

<P>To Man as well as to God. Be&s;ides, Friend, let me tell thee, that the u&s;ing the plural Num|ber to &s;ingle Per&s;ons, was begun in Flattery to Princes and great Men; as was al&s;o the Ceremo|ny of the Hat and the Knee, and came to be practis'd as Marks of Adoration paid to Men, who were thereby &s;et up in God's Stead; and where they cannot go that Length, yet they feed natu|ral Pride, and make Differences among&s;t Men, where Nature hath made none.</P>

<P><HI>We do not u&s;e them as Marks of Adorati|on.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe thee; but &s;till they are Marks of In&s;incerity, and of a Submi&s;&s;ion which is not due from Man to Man. Friend, the&s;e civil Ce|remonies are of evil Efficacy, and apt to deceive the Mind into a &s;lavi&s;h and &s;uper&s;titious Vene|ration for Per&s;ons. They make unnatural Di&s;tan|ces in Society; and &s;et Men too far above and below one another. By &s;uch Steps Kings came to be wor&s;hipp'd as Gods, as &s;everal of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors formerly, and lately thy Friend <HI>Louis</HI> was deified by many of thy <HI>French</HI> Brethren.</P>
