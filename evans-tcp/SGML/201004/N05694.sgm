<HEAD>SERIOUS CONSIDERATIONS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS <HI>France</HI> has hitherto, by the Means of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> chiefly, been prevented from en&s;laving the World and Mankind, they are become of Cour&s;e our implaca|ble and mo&s;t inveterate Enemies, and of late every where our Competitors in Trade, and, as one of the Links of their grand Sy&s;tem, Encroachers upon our Territories; regardle&s;s of all Faith, Oaths, or Treaties, their national Polity being one continued Train of Chicane and Deceit; witne&s;s, the late au|dacious In&s;ult of an abandoned Crew of his Maje|&s;ty's own Subjects, in&s;tigated and &s;upported by that grand Monarch, upon the Liberties of <HI>Great-Bri|tain</HI> it&s;elf.</P>
<P>THEIR late Encroachments upon his Maje&s;ty's Rights and Territories, in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> and in <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s-<HI>Bay,</HI> with the mo&s;t pro|voking Circum&s;tances, are &s;o well known, that I believe I need not mention them. And now they &s;eem avowedly, and with much A&s;&s;urance, to open the &s;ame &s;hameful Scene upon this Continent, which they have indeed been long practi&s;ing under|hand. Thus by Sy&s;tem they are become the Di|&s;turbers of the Peace of Mankind, and wor&s;e than a Pe&s;t, for there is no End of it to every conti|guous Society; we are not the only Objects of their Re&s;entment.</P>

THAT va&s;t Sums have been expended upon their royal Geographers, and Hydrographers, in order that their Maps and Sea Charts may quadrate with their political Sy&s;tem of Encroachments upon the Territories of other Nations, is apparent to the whole World; and thus by e&s;tabli&s;hing their imaginary Rights by Pen and Ink, they are determined to confirm their Accuracy by a forcible Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Another Piece of Fine&s;&s;e, or <HI>French</HI> Policy, is that of burying Leaden Plates up and down this Conti|nent, with certain In&s;criptions, in order to form new Preten&s;ions; but in this, I am told, they were di&s;covered by &s;ome of our <HI>Indians,</HI> who, tho' not plea&s;ed, were diverted with the Whim, as I am confident the World mu&s;t be with their other Pro|ject, being equally ridiculous. What Figure we are like to make in this Di&s;pute; we, I &s;ay, who are &s;o nearly concerned in the Event, and who mu&s;t become, in all Probability, the fir&s;t Sacrifice; we, to whom, in a great Mea&s;ure, all this Impertinence is owing, who by an ill-judged Frugality meanly neglected the Preventing their fir&s;t Intru&s;ions at <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> and that important Pa&s;s at <HI>Niagara,</HI> and &s;ome more of the like Kind, together with a total Neglect of <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs, I &s;hall not take upon me to determine; nor &s;hall I enter into a Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the Rea&s;ons of that Neglect, or to whom owing, at this Time; this is not the Time to retro&s;pect, we mu&s;t now look forward. Our Ca&s;e at pre&s;ent is neither more nor le&s;s than this, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>French</HI> are now drawing a Line along the Bor|ders of our Settlements in every Province, from the Mouth of <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> to the Mouth of <HI>Mi&s;&s;i|&s;ippi,</HI> and building Forts to &s;ecure the mo&s;t conve|nient Pa&s;&s;es on the Lakes, that form the Commu|nication; by which they will effectually cut off all Intercour&s;e and Traffick, between us and the <HI>In|dians</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="007223_0004_102B3FF65FC12E50">inhabiting the inland Countries; and likewi&s;e compel tho&s;e who are Neighbours and Allies, by rea&s;on of the ab&s;olute Dependance they mu&s;t have on the <HI>French</HI> for every thing they want, as well as for their Liberty of Hunting and Fi&s;hing, to fall under their Subjection, or &s;tarve. It therefore, I think, behoveth us at this Time to exert our utmo&s;t Endeavours, by all the Means in our Power, to prevent &s;o bad a Neighbourhood. It is a Maxim in <HI>England,</HI> to avoid, if po&s;&s;ible, the Neighbour|hood of a great Lord; by the &s;ame Parity of Rea&s;on, what ought we then not to do, to avoid that of an ambitious, all-gra&s;ping Monarch, who&s;e Will, often the Caprice of a Mi&s;s, or a Favourite, is the Law; <HI>For &s;uch is our Plea&s;ure,</HI> is their whole <HI>Corpus Juris.</HI> One great Step, if not the greate&s;t, to this grand Monarch's univer&s;al Sy&s;tem, is that of being po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of this Northern Continent of <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> a Territory boundle&s;s as is his Ambition, in which he has made not a little Progre&s;s.</P>
<P>THE va&s;t Anxiety the Court and Kingdom of <HI>France</HI> were under on the Lo&s;s of <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> e&s;teemed the Key and <HI>Dunkirk</HI> of <HI>North America,</HI> and which I doubt will be equally baneful to us as ever the other was to <HI>Britain,</HI> together with other numerous Circum&s;tances, and indeed from every Step taken, may convince us, that the Plan for ex|tirpating the Subjects of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> out of <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> has been long in Agitation; the <HI>French</HI> lay their Plans of this Kind at a Di&s;tance, but &s;eldom lo&s;e the Point in view.</P>
<P>THEY have for many Years been indefatigable in their Endeavours to &s;educe our <HI>Indians;</HI> we on the other Side, have been as indolent as they could wi&s;h; and if ever they &s;ucceed in this Point effec|tually, they will have little el&s;e to do.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="007223_0005_102B3FF833485390">
REGULAR Troops are of little U&s;e here, further than to fight from behind Walls; it is by Means of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and by them only, that any Stop can be put to tho&s;e wicked Encroachments. And this is as yet very far from being either impo&s;&s;ible or im|practicable, if all Hands &s;et heartily about it; the very <HI>French</HI> them&s;elves openly upbraid us with our Indolence, and Divi&s;ions, which they acknowledge to be their greate&s;t Security. It is evident therefore I think to a Demon&s;tration, that if we continue to neglect our <HI>Indians</HI> much longer, or, if this Plan of a Congre&s;s for a Confederacy &s;hould prove abor|tive through the Caprice of any Man, or Number of Men, or by any ill-judged Frugality, that we may from thence date the Commencement of the the Di&s;&s;olution and De&s;truction of the&s;e Colonies: As for my own Part I &s;incerely believe the <HI>Indians</HI> will go off in a Body, and in that Ca&s;e we &s;hall mo&s;t certainly be the fir&s;t undone, <HI>Great-Britain</HI> will &s;uffer, and all <HI>Europe</HI> will &s;ooner or later feel the Effects of it. Tho&s;e therefore, who are more immediately concerned, and with whom we have entru&s;ted the Security of our Lives and Fortunes, have not a little to an&s;wer for to the pre&s;ent Gene|ration, as well as to tho&s;e who are to come after us, for their Conduct upon this critical Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>LET us for once &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>French,</HI> by their Fortifications and Lines of Communication, ab&s;o|lutely Ma&s;ters, either by Force, or Friend&s;hip of the <HI>Indians;</HI> how ea&s;y a Matter would it be for them with a &s;mall naval Force to put us between two Fires? A &s;mall Force of regular Troops to at|tack <HI>Albany,</HI> and <HI>New-York,</HI> at the &s;ame Time, while their Blood-hounds are burning and ma&s;|&s;acring our Out-Settlements, is, in my humble Opi|nion, the Plan laid, and which they will put in Ex|ecution &s;ooner or later, according as they become
<PB N="7" REF="007223_0006_102B3FF9D56F4248">Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Indians;</HI> and what a Cata&s;trophe will this create!</P>
<P>WHERE is now that Champion of our Liberties, who &s;o worthily exerted him&s;elf in the Ca&s;es of <HI>Rotten Row,</HI> and <HI>rotten black Gowns?</HI> Let him now &s;tand forth, our All being at Stake, and di&s;play his Eloquence; a <HI>Philippic</HI> or two; for never were Ca&s;es more parallel than that of <HI>Greece</HI> and ours, when <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> by his powerful Eloquence, rai&s;ed &s;uch a Spirit of Liberty in his Countrymen the <HI>A|thenians,</HI> ready to &s;ink, and upon the Brink of De|&s;truction, as &s;aved his Country; a few <HI>Philippics,</HI> I &s;ay, in that Gentleman's per&s;wa&s;ive Manner, I am &s;erious, might have wonderful Effects, and eternize his Memory. And the Ca&s;es being &s;o much alike, the &s;ame Rea&s;oning, with a very few <HI>mutatis mu|tandis,</HI> will hold; we mo&s;t certainly want the A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of our be&s;t Heads and Hands, to infu&s;e &s;ome publick Spirit among&s;t us, and to rai&s;e us out of our pre&s;ent Lethargy.</P>
<P>LET us not, however, de&s;pair, we are not yet pa&s;t Redemption; we have Hands, and I hope Hearts enough, if properly employed, to recover all our pa&s;t Lap&s;es and Mi&s;teps. But, as a worthy Patriot upon the like Occa&s;ion ob&s;erves, this mu&s;t indeed be very burden&s;ome; for if the greate&s;t State in <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> animated by the Pro&s;pect of univer&s;al Domi|nion, enabled by the ab&s;olute Power of its Govern|ment to draw every <HI>Shilling</HI> out of private Pur&s;es into the publick Pur&s;e; and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the per&s;onal Service of all its People, through the national Va|nity, and martial Habit of the Country; if &s;uch a State will pre&s;s the Ruin of its Neighbours with an ob&s;tinate Expence of all its Blood, and all its Trea|&s;ure, no Man can think it is an ea&s;y Ta&s;k to re|duce or re&s;i&s;t a Power which &s;hall act this Part: But you are to con&s;ider, &s;ays he, not &s;o much the
<PB N="8" REF="007223_0007_102B3FFCCD4EB530">Difficulties you mu&s;t now encounter to defend your|&s;elves, in this Conjuncture, as the certain Impo&s;&s;i|bility of your ever being able to do it again in any other, if you lo&s;e the pre&s;ent Opportunity. I &s;hall only therefore beg Leave to &s;ay as to the State of our Affairs, the Fact is this, that &s;uch is the Pow|er, &s;uch the Ambition, &s;uch the de&s;tructive Plan laid down by <HI>France;</HI> a plan to divide and en&s;lave the World; a Plan pur&s;ued with the utmo&s;t Ob&s;ti|nacy through every Difficulty for above a Century pa&s;t; &s;o far my Author; how ju&s;tly applicable to the pre&s;ent Situation of our Affairs, judge O Reader!</P>
<P>BUT as pointing out tho&s;e impending Evils, without offering, or attempting to offer at a Reme|dy, a Practice too common, and is only doing Things by Halves, I &s;hall beg Leave, with much Submi&s;&s;ion, to offer &s;uch Hints as have occurred to me from long Ob&s;ervation, which I hope &s;ome abler Hand will take up and improve with Candour (avaunt Critici&s;m) I invite them, nay I challenge it, as they will an&s;wer the Contrary to their God, their King, their Country, and Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>THAT we have lo&s;t, in a great Mea&s;ure, all that &s;incere Friend&s;hip and Attachment which did once &s;ub&s;i&s;t between us and our <HI>Indians,</HI> upon which, from the Malevolence of a wicked Neighbourhood, our Being, in this Part of the World, chiefly de|pends, is notorious to the World; by what, or by who&s;e Means, as before, I &s;hall not take upon me to di&s;cu&s;s, the Ta&s;k is invidious; I &s;hall only beg Leave to ob&s;erve, that the injurious and villainous Treatment they have met with for the&s;e many Years, in their Way of Trade, and that with|out Redre&s;s, together with the proper U&s;e our im|placable Enemies have made of it, who, by all Ac|counts, however they may treat their <HI>Indians</HI> in
<PB N="9" REF="007223_0008_102B3FFED9EFB1B8">other Matters, in that of Traffick they are always hone&s;tly and ju&s;tly dealt by, are the Sources of our Misfortunes. Now in order to regain their Affec|tions and Friend&s;hip effectually, it will be nece&s;&s;ary, in my humble Opinion, in the fir&s;t Place to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome good and &s;ufficient Laws for the Regulation of their Trade, and for &s;ummary and &s;evere Ju&s;tice in ca&s;e of Abu&s;es: Under the Government of <HI>Bo|&s;ton,</HI> they have &s;everal, which appear to me very rea&s;onable, and may be improved; one I &s;hall here beg Leave to in&s;ert, it is but &s;hort.</P>
<P>BY an Act of the 12th of GEO, it is enacted, <HI>That Provi&s;ions, Cloathing,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>&s;uitable for carrying on a Trade with the</HI> Indians, <HI>not exceeding the Value of</HI> Nine Thou&s;and Pounds, <HI>be procured at the Co&s;t of the Province, and the Produce applied for &s;upply|ing the</HI> Indians, <HI>by &s;uch Per&s;ons as &s;hall be annually cho&s;en,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>who &s;hall annually produce fair Ac|counts of their Proceedings; which Supplies &s;hall be lodged at,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>That a &s;uitable Per&s;on &s;hall be che|&s;en annually at each of the Places where any of the Goods are lodged; which Truck-ma&s;ters &s;hall be under Oath, and give &s;ufficient Security for the faithful Execution of that Tru&s;t, and &s;uch In&s;tructions as they &s;hall receive from Time to Time; and &s;hall keep fair Accounts of their Trade and Dealings with the</HI> In|dians, <HI>and &s;hall return the &s;ame, with the Produce, to the Per&s;on or Per&s;ons who &s;hall be appointed to &s;upply them with Goods; and they &s;hall not trade with the</HI> Indians, <HI>on their own Account. That the Truck|ma&s;ters &s;ell to the</HI> Indians <HI>at the Prices &s;et in the In|voices &s;ent them from Time to Time, without any Ad|vance thereon; and &s;hall allow the</HI> Indians <HI>for their Furs, and other Goods, as the Market &s;hall be at</HI> Bo&s;ton, <HI>according to the la&s;t Advices from the Per&s;on or Per&s;ons that &s;hall &s;upply them with the &s;ame Com|modities of equal Goodne&s;s: Rum to be given to the</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="007223_0009_102B400066F05688">Indians <HI>in moderate Quantities, by the Truck-ma&s;ters only: No Per&s;on what&s;oever, other than the Truck|ma&s;ters, and they only as &s;uch, &s;hall or may pre&s;ume, by them&s;elves, or any other for them, directly or indi|rectly, to &s;ell, truck, barter, or exchange to any</HI> In|dian <HI>or</HI> Indians, <HI>any Wares, Merchandize, or Pro|vi&s;ions, within &s;ix Miles of any Truck-hou&s;e, on Pe|nalty of forfeiting</HI> Fifty Pounds, <HI>or &s;ix Months Im|pri&s;onment,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>SOME good Laws of this Kind would go a great Way to an&s;wer all our Purpo&s;es, if duly executed. The <HI>French</HI> treat <HI>Indians</HI> much <HI>&agrave; la Cavalier,</HI> and often threaten to cut them off, if they do not join with them in their Excur&s;ions, and will be as good as their Words, &s;o &s;oon as they have compleated their Schemes; and of this the <HI>Indians</HI> are not with|out their Apprehen&s;ions, and therefore have &s;till a Hankering or Leaning towards our Intere&s;t, which, if properly managed, will &s;oon reconcile them; they are far from being in&s;en&s;ible that it is their In|tere&s;t to be on our Side, or that they can at any Time, or any where, be &s;o well &s;upplied. They are at this Time upon the Ballance, between Hopes and Fears, and if we do not now fix them, I be|lieve we may bid them fairly adieu! What le&s;s can we expect from them? we, who have been cheat|ing and abu&s;ing them for &s;o many Years, without Redre&s;s, in a mo&s;t abominable Manner, of which take the following Specimen: Without affording them the lea&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance in any Shape, be&s;ides that of a few Pre&s;ents from Time to Time, which in Reality are of no Manner of U&s;e to them, being divided at <HI>Albany,</HI> the far greater Part remains with tho&s;e con&s;cientious Handlers there, for Rum, &s;o that the Ca&s;tles know little more of the Matter than that there was a Pre&s;ent made. The&s;e however are
<PB N="11" REF="007223_0010_102B40021C300C98">but Palliatives, there mu&s;t be &s;omething more &s;ub|&s;tantial in the Ca&s;e:</P>
<P>HAVING, as above, made proper Regulations for the Trade, and that they may be no longer &s;o unmercifully impo&s;ed upon, both in Weight and Mea&s;ure, as well as in Quality and Prices, which has almo&s;t alienated their Hearts from us; the next Step that I would advi&s;e &s;hould be taken, is, that of erecting proper Fortifications in or near every one of the <HI>Indian</HI> Ca&s;tles, with a Garri&s;on of about 15 or 20 Men in each, with an approved Sergeant, two or three of which may be Smiths, in double Pay, with a few Field Pieces, Spare Arms, Snow-Shoes (with which the <HI>French</HI> are always provided) &s;mall Hatchets, and &s;ome Dogs of a proper Kind, to prevent Surprizes in the Night.</P>
<P>THIS, I doubt not, the <HI>Indians</HI> would readily come into, as it would greatly incourage their Hunting, as well as their War Parties, and as it would be a Security for their old Men, Women, and Children, and a &s;afe Retreat for them&s;elves up|on all Occa&s;ions; without &s;uch Security, they are impatient when Abroad, and &s;eldom care to go far; be&s;ides the Lo&s;s of Numbers to the Service, upon any Emergency, who are detained at home for that Purpo&s;e. The&s;e Forts might at the &s;ame time an&s;wer all the Purpo&s;es of Truck or Trading|hou&s;es, to be divided by Lot among&s;t the contri|buting Colonies as far as they will go; and which, if properly &s;tored with <HI>Indian</HI> Goods, and regulated according to the Method in <HI>New-England,</HI> would very &s;oon create &s;uch an Intercour&s;e and Connection between the remote <HI>Indian</HI> Nations and ours. as would turn out greatly to our Advantage. And one &s;ingle independent Company would garri&s;on the whole; and what a Trifle of a Charge would this be, in Compari&s;on to the Advantages we might
<PB N="12" REF="007223_0011_102B400531E88128">hope for, and expect from it; and indeed it is my humble Opinion, that nothing le&s;s will effectually &s;ecure our Intere&s;t and Friend&s;hip with the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>As it is agreed on all Hands, that a good &s;trong Fort ought to be erected at or near the <HI>Wood Creek,</HI> in order to counter-ballance that of <HI>Crown Point,</HI> I &s;hall make no Doubt but that tho&s;e who are entru&s;t|ed with the Care of our Security, will &s;oon &s;ee that Part (as well as every other) of their Duty put in Execution, and I make as little Doubt but that his Maje&s;ty, upon a proper Application, would, out of his wonted Goodne&s;s, favour us with an indepen|dent Company of <HI>Highlanders;</HI> there &s;eems to be &s;o much Affinity both in their Di&s;po&s;ition and Dre&s;s, (which I would have compleat <HI>Highland</HI>) with that of our <HI>Indians,</HI> that I am confident they would be highly plea&s;ed with them, and I doubt not, have a very good Effect. In ca&s;e of enli&s;ting for this Service, Care ought to be taken to avoid all <HI>Roman Catholicks;</HI> we have, I doubt, too many of that Kid|ney already from <HI>Ireland</HI> in the&s;e four Companies.</P>
<P>ONE Objection to this Scheme may be, the Ex|pence and Trouble attending the Victualling and Relieving: To which I beg Leave to &s;ay, that if the <HI>Indians</HI> approve of it, they will undertake to carry and e&s;cort Goods or Provi&s;ions, at an ea&s;y Rate: Or why may not tho&s;e very Garri&s;ons in a little Time, with proper Care, be induced to rai&s;e their own Provi&s;ions? Suppo&s;e the Victualling of twenty Men to co&s;t the Government <HI>Two Hundred Pounds</HI> yearly, let tho&s;e Men be encouraged, and &s;et to Work to provide them&s;elves, and let them have the <HI>Two Hundred Pounds</HI> be&s;ides their Pay, and a Title to all the Lands they do or can im|prove, and their Di&s;charge when demanded; this would &s;ave the Trouble, the Ri&s;que, the Relieving and the Expence of carrying Provi&s;ions, and be the
<PB N="13" REF="007223_0012_102B4007E20A62D0">Means of better &s;ettling our Frontiers; there are tho&s;e to be found, I doubt not, who would under|take, if properly encouraged. That of relieving Garri&s;ons here, is in my humble Opinion but bad Po|licy; I would have none &s;ent but &s;ome Trade&s;men, all the re&s;t &s;hould be only &s;uch as have been u&s;ed to Hu&s;bandry and Labour: Had this Method been taken fifty Years ago, we &s;hould very probably have had many Thou&s;and Families in the <HI>Seneca's</HI> Country at this Day.</P>
<P>THE U&s;e of Garri&s;ons here, are either to encou|rage and protect Settlements, or to &s;ecure import|ant Pa&s;&s;es; the <HI>French</HI> have &s;ucceeded in the latter, we, I &s;hall not &s;ay for what Rea&s;on, in neither.</P>
<P>THIS however is not all, if we intend to con|vince them that we are really in earne&s;t, and that they &s;hould fight for us, we mu&s;t fight along with them, and always to have &s;ome of our People to head their Parties; the <HI>French</HI> &s;eldom fail of this Method: I &s;hould therefore advi&s;e the E&s;tabli&s;hing an independent Company or two, in time of War, of an Hundred good Men each, with an Addition of five <HI>Indians</HI> from each Nation, to be in con&s;tant Pay, Peace or War, as Rangers; one of the Com|panies from <HI>Connecticut</HI> would add Strength to the County of <HI>Albany;</HI> the Officers to be Men of &s;ome Di&s;tinction and Knowledge, and fully impow|ered to receive Complaints, and redre&s;s Grievances among&s;t the <HI>Indians;</HI> to be a Sort of a flying Camp, frequently moving from Nation to Nation, to head all Parties, and to command out as many <HI>Indians</HI> upon any Emergency as they may think proper; one Company of Rangers properly di&s;po&s;ed, will be of more U&s;e than three in Garri&s;on. And here I &s;hall beg Leave once for all to ob&s;erve, that no Per|&s;on employed in this Service be allowed to trade with the <HI>Indians,</HI> on the &s;evere&s;t Penalties.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="007223_0013_102B40099B03EC90">
THUS our <HI>Indians</HI> being &s;ecured in an hone&s;t and fair Trade, their Ca&s;tles &s;ecured, either for the Safety of their Families, or as a Retreat for them|&s;elves; and being well a&s;&s;ured of our being in Ear|ne&s;t to &s;upport them upon all Occa&s;ions, as we have in former Days done, it is not to be doubted but that we &s;hall very &s;oon get into their good Graces and Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>THE King, the Parliament, and indeed every <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Subject, being deeply concerned in the Event of this Congre&s;s at <HI>Albany,</HI> will doubtle&s;s &s;can the Conduct of our Colony A&s;&s;emblies upon this Occa|&s;ion; a hearty and generous Concurrence will have wonderful Effects, and I make no Doubt but that we &s;hall be able in a little Time, by proper Mea|&s;ures, to turn the Tables upon that faithle&s;s Na|tion, who have been long underhand endeavouring our De&s;truction, and who &s;eem now, by their au|dacious In&s;ults upon our Traders and Plantations, openly to avow it.</P>
<P>LET us not therefore, Gentlemen of the A&s;&s;em|blies, by an ill-tim'd Frugality lo&s;e our All; would any of you, pray Gentlemen, lo&s;e a Sheep for a <HI>Halfpenny</HI>'s worth of Tar?

<HEAD><HI>Of the</HI> LYON <HI>and the four</HI> BULLS.</HEAD>
<P><HI>FOUR Bulls which had entered into a very &s;trict Friend&s;hip, kept always near one another, and al|ways fed together. The Lyon often &s;aw them, and had as often a Mind to make one of them his Prey: But tho' he could ea&s;ily have &s;ubdued any of them &s;ingle, yet he was afraid to attack the whole Alliance, as knowing they would be too hard for him, and there|fore contented him&s;elf for the pre&s;ent with keeping at

The Lyon had now obtained his Ends; and, as impo&s;&s;ible it was for him to hurt them while united, he found no Difficulty, now they were parted, to &s;eize and devour every Bull of them, one after another.</HI></P>

<P>SIR <HI>W. Temple</HI> ob&s;erves, that in the Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> when the <HI>Romans</HI> fir&s;t entered, it was divided into &s;everal Di&s;tricts, each governed by its own Prince, or Governor, different in their Views and Councils, by which Means they became an ea&s;y Conque&s;t: <HI>Dum &s;inguli pugnabunt, univer&s;i vinceban|tur;</HI> while they fought &s;ingly, the whole I&s;land was &s;ubdued. The <HI>French</HI> have little to fight for but the Glory of their Monarch; we have the Glory of <HI>Britain,</HI> our Religion, our Liberties and our Pro|perties, and upwards of a Hundred Years Labour in the&s;e wild De&s;arts, for the Sake of our Po&s;terity; in &s;hort, it is <HI>pro aris &amp; focis,</HI> that we are to &s;truggle; and I doubt it is now or never. Should this Con|gre&s;s break up without an&s;wering the intended De|&s;ign of it, I &s;hall very readily advi&s;e my Children to look out in time for a &s;afer Retreat.</P>
<P>LET us &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider what De&s;olation and De&s;truction our innocent Neighbours and Fellow Subjects have undergone from tho&s;e barbarous <HI>Ca|nadeans,</HI> who are e&s;teemed, even in <HI>France,</HI> a Race of Men lo&s;t to all tho&s;e Principles of Honour upon which that Nation pique them&s;elves; who, toge|ther with their Cannibals, take Plea&s;ure in wantonly
<PB N="16" REF="007223_0015_102B400DE9C43AF0">burning Cottages, and in the inhuman Murder, and excruciating harmle&s;s old Women and helple&s;s In|fants; let us, I &s;ay, &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider what we have undergone, when the <HI>French</HI> were but a Handful, and our <HI>Indians</HI> our Friends: What mu&s;t be our Fate when they are become more numerous, and they are daily increa&s;ing, and our <HI>Indians</HI> on their Side? I &s;hudder to think of it.</P>
<P>LET us con&s;ider what Anxiety tho&s;e poor People undergo, with what Unca&s;ine&s;s they go to their Beds, what Alarms and Heart beatings they are un|der upon the lea&s;t Barking of a Dog, expecting every Moment to have their Scalps carried off, and their Bodies mangled; while we enjoy a profound Re&s;t, without Care or Thought: Is this Truth, and will it not move you, Gentlemen?</P>
<P>LET us exert our be&s;t Endeavours to &s;hew our Gratitude to our Mother Country, who has hitherto nur&s;ed and &s;upported us at an infinite Expence, by pre&s;erving to them, and to them only, the Fruits of our Labour.</P>
<P>THE Time was when we had only to &s;end to our <HI>Indians</HI> to di&s;charge the <HI>French</HI> from building Forts, or making Encroachments; but we have lo&s;t it by a fatal Neglect of <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs. It is well known with how much Submi&s;&s;ion they begg'd Leave to erect but a &s;mall Hut, as a Re&s;ting-place only, at <HI>Niagara:</HI> How different the Times! The Execu|tion of this Scheme, or, indeed, any other, and &s;ome one or other there mu&s;t be, will, no doubt, be at|tended with a very con&s;iderable Expence; but when the other Colonies, who are not le&s;s concern|ed in the Event, come in for their Proportion, to|gether with what A&s;&s;i&s;tance his Maje&s;ty may be &s;o good as to favour us with, it is to be hoped the Charge will become tolerably ea&s;y: Be that as it will we mu&s;t launch out. And is there ever a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="007223_0016_102B40100EC87838">Subject among&s;t us, who alone know the true Va|lue of Liberty and Property, that will, upon this Occa&s;ion, grudge a few <HI>Pence</HI> upon every Hundred Acres, or a few <HI>Shillings</HI> for every Slave, to &s;ecure to him and his Po&s;terity, all that is valuable in Life, or for which Life is valuable. Or why may not the Gentry pay for their Sa&s;h-windows upon &s;uch pre&s;|&s;ing Occa&s;ions, and &mdash; <HI>Shillings</HI> upon every Car|riage-wheel of Plea&s;ure? This is all ready Money. And as the Gentlemen paid lately for their Wigs, why may not the Ladies, in their Turn, pay for their Hoops? After all, a gentle Land Tax, being the mo&s;t equitable upon tho&s;e Occa&s;ions, mu&s;t be our dernier Refort. Trade is at pre&s;ent an Object of Compa&s;&s;ion, and mu&s;t be gently treated, as well as the poorer Sort of the People without Property: They mu&s;t fight our Battles; which puts me in mind of the Fable,</P>
<P>The SENSIBLE ASS.</P>
<P><HI>AN old Fellow was feeding an A&s;s in a fine green Meadow; and being alarmed with the &s;udden Approach of the Enemy, was impatient with the A&s;s to put him&s;elf forward, and fly with all the Speed he was able. The A&s;s a&s;k'd him, Whether or no he thought the Enemy would clap two Pair of Panniers upon his Back? The Man &s;aid, No, there was no fear of that. Why then, &s;ays the A&s;s; I'll not &s;tir an Inch; for what is it to me who my Ma&s;ter is, &s;ince I &s;hall but carry my Panniers as u&s;ual.</HI></P>
<P>THAT par&s;imonious Di&s;po&s;ition, in our Colony A&s;&s;emblies, have had, and we now feel it, and ever will have fatal Effects.</P>
<P>OUR Fellow Subjects in <HI>Virginia</HI> have &s;hewn us a noble Example, which has already put &s;ome Life into our <HI>Indians:</HI> Witne&s;s the Half King's Speech to the <HI>French</HI> Officer. And as the like Encroach|ments, as I under&s;tand, have been lately made up|on the People of <HI>New-England,</HI> it is not to be doubted, but that they will exert them&s;elves with the
<PB N="18" REF="007223_0017_102B40119F8B6C98">&s;ame Spirit and Bravery they did at <HI>Cape-Breton.</HI> And &s;hall we, like a Parcel of Poltroons, &s;tand a|gha&s;t, with our Hands on our Pockets; we, I &s;ay, who have co&s;t the People of <HI>England,</HI> in nur&s;ing and protecting us, more, perhaps, than all the o|ther Colonies upon the Continent together; or grudge our Proportion of the Expence, adequate to the Importance it may be of to us? <HI>Let it not be told in</HI> Gath, <HI>or publi&s;hed in the Streets of</HI> A&s;ke|lon.</P>
<P>IT has been ob&s;erved, that Prie&s;ts have been ge|nerally well received among&s;t the <HI>Indians,</HI> whether upon Account of their religious Principles, or that the <HI>Indians</HI> being eternally &s;urrounded by a Parcel of Handlers or Pickpockets, and finding the Par&s;on to avoid the Circle and the whole Sphere of Tran|&s;actions of this Kind, that they conclude him an ho|ne&s;t Man, I &s;hall not take upon me to determine: I believe, however, the latter is the Ca&s;e, as they ve|ry often take his Advice in Matters of Moment, while at the &s;ame time they have a very de&s;picable Opinion of the others. It is by Means of the Prie&s;ts, in a great Mea&s;ure, that the <HI>French</HI> have &s;ucceeded &s;o well in &s;educing our <HI>Indians,</HI> and confirming their own. I &s;hould therefore advi&s;e, that there &s;hould be a Par&s;on appointed for each Ca&s;tle, no matter of what Church, with a hand&s;ome Allowance: And why might he not act as a Commi&s;&s;ary as well as a Mi&s;&s;ionary, and deal out the Goods of the Govern|ment as well as tho&s;e of the Go&s;pel? The Offices are not at all incompatible; Bi&s;hops have frequently been Lord Trea&s;urers. I can by no Means agree in Sentiment with tho&s;e Gentlemen who are for con|tinuing that, in my humble Opinion, pernicious Trade, carried on for &s;o many Years, between <HI>Ca|nada</HI> and <HI>Albany,</HI> if there were no other Rea&s;on than that they &s;eem really to want it, and that more than is generally imagined. I would fain know, whe|ther they, upon any Con&s;ideration, would allow us
<PB N="19" REF="007223_0018_102B4013AC5361B0">the &s;ame Liberties at <HI>Montreal</HI> or <HI>Quebeck?</HI> To &s;ee &s;ome Hundreds of <HI>French Indians,</HI> as Factors from <HI>Quebeck,</HI> trading for <HI>Indian</HI> Goods, who carry off not only Goods, but a large Share of our Spe|cie; nothing of late will go down with them but <HI>Spani&s;h Dollars;</HI> while a poor Trader of ours, if he has the Misfortune to meet with any of the <HI>French,</HI> within what they are now plea&s;ed to call their Do|minions, is immediately hurried away Pri&s;oner to <HI>Quebeck;</HI> This is a Contra&s;t that I &s;hould be glad the Advocates for this Trade would account for.</P>
<P>IT is true, they take off of our Manufactures; but it is as true, that tho&s;e Commodities would be taken off our Hands directly by the <HI>Indians</HI> them|&s;elves, when they found they could not have them among the <HI>French.</HI> It is likewi&s;e &s;aid, if they had them not from us, they would find them el&s;ewhere. To which I beg Leave to &s;ay, That the <HI>French</HI> know their Intere&s;t too well to tru&s;t an Affair of that Con&s;equence &s;o long to &s;o precarious a Method of procuring them, as it is in our Power every Day to put a Stop to it: I therefore conclude, if they could have fallen upon any other Method of pro|curing tho&s;e Commodities, they would have done it long ago, and have kept their Furs to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>OUR &s;elling our <HI>Indian</HI> Goods to the <HI>French,</HI> to trade for us with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and having in Return their coar&s;e&s;t Furs, is, in my humble Opinion, not le&s;s ridiculous than that of our formerly &s;ending our Wheat to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and having our Returns in Bran and &s;ome Flour. Be&s;ides, what is of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence to us, is, that the <HI>Cachawagas,</HI> our old Friends, and their be&s;t <HI>Indians,</HI> whom, <HI>coute qui'l coute,</HI> co&s;t what it will, we ought to recover, are the &s;ole Carriers and Managers in this Affair be|tween <HI>Canada</HI> and <HI>Albany,</HI> which has created &s;uch a Connection between them and the <HI>French,</HI> that till this Trade is aboli&s;hed, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to ac|compli&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="007223_0019_102B401668FD02F0">
NOR can I conceive the Remedy very difficult, as it may very naturally be brought within the very Letter of the Twelfth of CHARLES II. which de|clares, <HI>That no Per&s;on, not born within the Alle|giance of our Sovereign Lord the King,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>&s;hall trade in any of the Plantations, upon Pain of forfeiting all his Goods and Chattels,</HI> &amp;c. A Law, however, here, perhaps, might an&s;wer better. I have but one Thing more to add, and that with great Submi&s;|&s;ion, being a Point that has not been as yet can|va&s;&s;ed, and that is, That a general Combination of all the <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;ar and near, be formed, to demo|li&s;h every Spot of fortified Ground in the <HI>Indian</HI> Countries on this Side <HI>Montreal,</HI> and the other Side of <HI>Schenectady,</HI> at lea&s;t that they be brought to one determinate Number, never to be exceeded: By this Means the Trade will ever be kept open; nor need we apprehend further Encroachments. The <HI>French,</HI> I doubt, are too well fixed to come into any &s;uch Propo&s;al; but it will have one good Effect at lea&s;t, and that is, that it will convince the <HI>Indians,</HI> that we have no other Views but their Intere&s;t; while the <HI>French</HI> are endeavouring their De&s;truction, by cutting them off from all Communication with us, to be Ma&s;ters of their Hunting-grounds, and of Cour&s;e they mu&s;t either become their Slaves, or &s;tarve.</P>
<P>How &s;oon this may happen, God, and that great Monarch, can only tell: I am not, however, without Apprehen&s;ions, you may, if you plea&s;e, call them Dreams, that the <HI>French</HI> are upon a Plan different, and a Cri&s;is much nearer, I doubt, than what we imagine. I can by no Means think that they, who are noted for their Frugality, would at this Time put them&s;elves to the Charge of rai&s;ing an Army of 4 or 5000 Men, for the Sake of a pal|try Block-hou&s;e or two upon a Branch of <HI>Ohio,</HI> or any where el&s;e, which they might have done as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> Men, and without any Noi&s;e,
<PB N="21" REF="007223_0020_102B4018A5729410">according to their u&s;ual Method, in Matters of this Kind. I am further confirmed in my Opinion, that tho&s;e Block-hou&s;es are not the &s;ole Point which the <HI>French</HI> have in View, from the Sentiments of our A&s;&s;embly in a late Repre&s;entation to our Lieute|nant-Governor, in the&s;e Words, <HI>That the</HI> French <HI>have built a Fort at a Place called the</HI> French Creek, <HI>at a con&s;iderable Di&s;tance from the River</HI> Ohio; <HI>which may, but does not, by any Evidence or In|for mation, appear to us to be an Inva&s;ion of any of his Maje&s;ty's Colonies:</HI> This is roundly a&s;&s;erted, but as it in &s;ome Mea&s;ure confirms my Opinion, I &s;hall leave it to whom it more immediately con|cerns to di&s;cu&s;s, hoping at the &s;ame time that our Enemies may not make an improper U&s;e of it.</P>
<P>THOSE Block-hou&s;es therefore, I &s;ay, are not, in my humble Opinion, their &s;ole De&s;igns at pre&s;ent, they are rather imitating, as I conceive, tho&s;e &s;aga|cious little Animals, who, in order to divert your Attention from the proper Object, their little Habi|tations, gently lead you to a proper Di&s;tance, till they think them&s;elves &s;ecure; and may not this be all Grimace, and a Feint, to draw our Attention and Troops from their proper Object, our Fron|tiers? <HI>to wit,</HI> What could be meant by a Num|ber of Troops pa&s;&s;ing <HI>O&s;wego</HI> in one Day, and re|turning in the Night, and the next Day pa&s;&s;ing again by the Fort? This is a very uncommon Piece of Conduct, and can mean nothing le&s;s than to draw our Attention and Troops after them into a Wild-goo&s;e Cha&s;e, with the View to make a Di|ver&s;ion &s;omewhere el&s;e.</P>
<P>WHAT can they mean by declaring that they do not want the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Indians,</HI> but to lull them into a Neutrality till they &s;trike the Blow? If one may be allowed to form any Judgment at this Di&s;tance, of the Situation of our Publick Affairs at Home, a Rupture does not &s;eem to be at &s;o im|men&s;e a Di&s;tance, but that a Mon&s;ieur <HI>Danville,</HI> or
<PB N="22" REF="007223_0021_102B401A61596E08">even that little Squadron, de&s;tined to cha&s;ti&s;e the <HI>Algerines,</HI> may bring us the fir&s;t Account of it. And how &s;oon are tho&s;e Thou&s;ands upon the back of us, now under Arms, collected at <HI>Albany,</HI> with their <HI>Indians?</HI> Judge now, candid Reader, what a Situation we are in for &s;uch an Event: And whom have we to thank for it? Without an <HI>Indian,</HI> with|out a Fort, that can with any Propriety be called &s;o; without Ammunition, without Arms, without Money, and I doubt (from the indifferent Treat|ment tho&s;e Creditors of the Government have hitherto met with) without Credit. And &s;hould we want the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of our Neighbours, we have but ju&s;t &s;hewn a very bad Example. Such is our Situation: And if &s;uch an Event &s;hould happen, I &s;ee nothing left, but to pray to the Lord to have Mercy upon us.</P>
<P>WHAT a Fatality &s;eems to attend the Proceed|ings of a Neighbour Colony, who at this very cri|tical Point of Time treat the Decrees of Heaven, and the King, with great Contempt! They have the &s;ame Directions as the other Colonies have, to furni&s;h their Quota's, and attend the Congre&s;s at <HI>Albany,</HI> for the Pre&s;ervation of the Whole; but becau&s;e Providence has been plea&s;ed to lay its Hand upon that good Gentleman the Governor, &s;o as to di&s;able him from attending the A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Amboy,</HI> they are plea&s;ed to tell him, <HI>When he is well enough to attend them there, they will then con&s;ider what is to be done;</HI> in the mean time their Quota's and the Congre&s;s is evaded: What, for God's Sake, mu&s;t be the Con&s;equence of &s;uch Proceedings, when our All is at Stake? Will that trite Tale of, <HI>We your Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t loyal Subjects,</HI> &amp;c. protect them from his Maje&s;ty's Di&s;plea&s;ure? Or do they tru&s;t to the Rioters to protect them, either from that or the Enemy? Mu&s;t a whole People &s;uffer for the Caprice of a few A&s;&s;embly-men?. Caprice I call it, and have too much Rea&s;on to call it &s;o,
<PB N="23" REF="007223_0022_102B401C6F6FBCE0">and &s;hall ever think it &s;uch, till they are plea&s;ed to let us (in the mo&s;t publick Manner) into the Rea|&s;ons of their Conduct; this we have a Right to demand; but more properly they ought to give it us without demanding, as they are accountable to the People for every Step they take, and, in Matters of Moment, ought not to proceed without fir&s;t con&s;ulting their Con&s;tituents. Here, Mr. <HI>Reflector,</HI> is an ample Field to expatiate in, and I would fain hope, from your pathetick Manner of Rea&s;oning, the Eyes of the Ob&s;tinate, and Ignorant, may be opened, for their own Safety, as well as that of the Whole. I am &s;till in the <HI>Jer&s;eys:</HI> We have had a long Experience of his Maje&s;ty's Lenity, how far it may extend I know not; but this I will af|firm, that we have more to apprehend from a Par|liamentary Scrutiny, than has as yet entered into the Heart of any of us to conceive; can any Bo|dy imagine that this Trifling with his Maje&s;ty's In|&s;tructions, in an Affair of &s;o much Con&s;equence to the Trade and Intere&s;t of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and to every <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Subject, will, according to the u&s;ual Cant, &s;ave the Country's Money? Will not the Commi&s;&s;ioners from the &s;everal Colonies, and it is to be hoped a Majority will attend, in the fir&s;t Place con&s;ider the Danger we are in at this Point of Time? 2dly, How to prevent it now, and for the future? 3dly, Will they not make a Compu|tation of the Expence? 4thly, Wild not tho&s;e very Commi&s;&s;ioners proportion that Expence; giving to each Colony its Quota? Does the <HI>Jer&s;eys</HI> think to e&s;cape? This, of Cour&s;e, will be laid before his Maje&s;ty, which, from the Fate his In&s;tructions have hitherto met with from that A&s;&s;embly, as well as from &s;ome others, he will naturally order it to be laid before the Parliament, with whom there is no contending; and who knows, when their Hands are in, but they may take it into their Heads to lay the Foundation of a regular Government a|mong&s;t
<PB N="24" REF="007223_0023_102B401E73CAF4F8">us, and taking it out of the Hands of the A&s;&s;emblies, by fixing a Support for the Governor, and the other Officers of the Crown, independent of an A&s;&s;embly? Nor can I &s;ee any great Difficul|ty in the Execution of it; it is only reviving our own Revenue Acts, to continue as long as his Ma|je&s;ty, and his Parliament, thinks proper; there is nothing new in this, it is what we have been u&s;ed to; tho&s;e Funds have been thought proper, both by the King, and Subject, and the only Difference is, as to the Point of Time. That a Governor for him&s;elf, and the Support of the Dignity of the Government, or the other Officers in the executive Part of the Laws, and Government, &s;hould de|pend upon the Breath of a few capricious Country Gentlemen in an A&s;&s;embly for their daily or yearly Sub&s;i&s;tence and Support, or whether indeed they &s;hall have any at all, is a Soleci&s;m in Politicks.</P>
<P>AND here I &s;hall beg Leave to conclude with another Fable.</P>
<P><HI>ABOAR &s;tood whetting his Tu&s;ks again&s;t an old Tree; the Fox, who happened to come by at the &s;ame Time, a&s;ked him why he made tho&s;e Preparations of whetting his Teeth, &s;ince there was no Enemy near that he could perceive?

<P>A WISE General has not his Men to di&s;cipline, or his Ammunition to provide, when the Trumpet &s;ounds TO ARMS; but &s;ets apart his Times of Exerci&s;e for one, and his Magazines for t'other, in the calm Sea&s;on of Peace.</P>
