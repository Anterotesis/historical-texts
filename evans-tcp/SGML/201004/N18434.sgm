<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Court of which you are appointed Pre&s;ident, is ordered for the purpo&s;e of enquiring into the conduct of Brigadier General Harmar, the commanding officer upon the late expedition again&s;t the Miami Indians.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of your inve&s;tigations, all the circum&s;tances of the campaign from the time the army departed, until it returned to Fort Wa&s;hington, are to be taken into con&s;ideration. The&s;e will embrace the per&s;onal conduct of the General,&mdash;the organization of the army,&mdash;the orders of march, encampment and battle,&mdash;the motives which influenced the detachments of the 14th, the 19th and the 21&s;t of October, and whether the &s;aid detachments were duly &s;upported, and if not, the rea&s;ons which prevented the &s;aid &s;upport. The articles of war &s;pecify, that Courts of Enquiry &s;hall not give their opinion on the merits of any ca&s;e; excepting they &s;hall be &s;pecially thereto required.&mdash; This &s;eems to be one of the ca&s;es in which an opinion is requi&s;ite; you will therefore plea&s;e, Sir, to take the opinion of the Court on all and every of the points above &s;pecified, and convey the &s;ame to me when the Enquiry &s;hall be clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Some evidences have been expected from Kentuckey&mdash;whether they will attend or not I cannot inform the Court; but the principal officers of the Mili|tia, who &s;erved in the army of General Harmar, have had notice, that the Court would meet this day.&mdash;I have heard from none of them, excepting Lieutenant Colonel Trotter, who writes to me that his attendance is doubtful &mdash;that Colonel Hall is gone to the atlantic States, and he believes Colonel M'Mullen likewi&s;e.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Brigadier General Harmar being called upon for his Evidences, furni&s;hed the Court with a li&s;t of per&s;ons, whereupon the Court ordered them to be &s;um|moned to attend.&mdash;The Court then adjourned to meet at 3 o'clock P. M.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="023905_0005_0FC298670E645F38">Three o'clock P. M.&mdash;The Court met agreeably to adjournment.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen who were &s;ummoned, not being ready to give in their evi|dences, the Court adjourned to meet at 9 o'clock to-morrow morning.</P>
<P>SEPTEMBER 16th.&mdash;The Court met agreeably to adjournment, and Major Fergu&s;on being called in and &s;worn, depo&s;ed as followeth:&mdash;That, &s;ome time about the 15th July, it was determined to carry on an expedition again&s;t the Miami villages. One thou&s;and militia from Kentuckey, and five hundred from Penn&s;ylvania, with what could be collected of the 1&s;t United States regiment, and one company of artillery, was to form the army. The militia from Ken|tuckey began to a&s;&s;emble at Fort Wa&s;hington about the middle of September; tho&s;e were very ill equipped, being almo&s;t de&s;titute of camp kettles and axes; nor could a &s;upply of the&s;e e&s;&s;ential articles be procured. Their arms were gene|rally very bad, and unfit for &s;ervice&mdash;that as he was the commanding officer of artillery, they came under his in&s;pection, in making what repairs the time would permit, and as a &s;pecimen of their badne&s;s, he informed the Court, that a rifle was brought to be repaired without a lock, and another without a &s;tock. That he a&s;ked the owners what induced them to think, that tho&s;e guns could be repaired at that time? and they gave him for an&s;wer, that they were told in Kentuckey that all repairs would be made at Fort Wa&s;hington. Many of the officers told him, that they had no idea of there being half the number of bad arms in the whole di&s;trict of Kentuckey, as was then in the hands of their men. As &s;oon as the principal part of the Kentuckey militia arrived, the Gene|ral began to organize them; in this he had many difficulties to encounter.&mdash; Colonel Trotter a&s;pired to the command, altho' Colonel Hardin was the elde&s;t officer, and in this he was encouraged both by men and officers, who openly declared, unle&s;s Colonel Trotter commanded them, they would return home. After two or three days the bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;ettled, and they were formed into three battalions, under the command of Colonel Trotter, and Colonel Hardin had the command of all the militia. As &s;oon as they were arranged, they were mu&s;tered; cro&s;&s;ed the Ohio, and on the 26th, marched and encamped about ten miles from Fort Wa&s;hington. The la&s;t of the Penn&s;ylvania militia arrived on the 25th September.&mdash;The&s;e were equipped nearly as the Kentuckey, but were wor&s;e armed, &s;everal were without any. The General ordered all the arms in &s;tore to be delivered to tho&s;e who had none, and tho&s;e who&s;e guns could not be repaired.&mdash;Among&s;t the militia were a great many hardly able to bear arms, &s;uch as old infirm men, and young boys; they were not &s;uch as might be expected from a frontier country, viz. the &s;mart active wood&s;man, well accu&s;tomed to arms, eager and alert to revenge the injuries done them, and their connections. No&mdash;there were a great number of them <HI>&s;ub&s;titutes,</HI> who probably had never fired a gun. Major Paul, of Penn&s;ylvania, told him, that many of his men were &s;o aukward, that they could not take their gun|locks off to oil them, and put them on again, nor could they put in their flints &s;o as to be u&s;eful, and even of &s;uch materials, the numbers came far &s;hort of what was ordered, as may be &s;een by the returns. That on the 31&s;t September, the General, with the continental troops, marched from Fort Wa&s;hington, to join Colonel Hardin, who had advanced into the country, for the &s;ake of feed for the cattle, and to open the road for the artillery. On the 3d October, the whole army joined, and was arranged in order of march, encampment, and battle; the&s;e would appear by the orderly-book, with this difference in the encampment, the &s;pace they were to occupy, when in order of battle, which was to be open, was always to be filled up with their fires, nor was any intervals to be left between battalions. This was done to prevent in &s;ome mea&s;ure the cattle and hor&s;es from getting out of camp; and the centinels round camp had orders not to let the cattle or hor&s;es pa&s;s out after dark, ju&s;t before which time they were brought within their fires. Tho&s;e precautions, aided by the care and indu&s;try of Mr. Wells and his a&s;&s;i&s;tants, &s;ucceeded well in preventing lo&s;s
<PB N="3" REF="023905_0006_0FC2986884C64658">
of cattle&mdash;he was informed there were only two oxen lo&s;t from the time the whole army took up the line of march, until it returned to Fort Wa&s;hington;&mdash; but he was &s;orry to &s;ay, it was not the ca&s;e of the pack-hor&s;es, the generality of the people employed in that department were ignorant of their duty, indo|lent, and inactive; nor was it in the power of the General to remedy the&s;e defects.&mdash;The &s;hortne&s;s of the time for a&s;&s;embling and organizing the army, put it out of his power to look about and &s;elect fit characters, he was of cour&s;e obliged to take tho&s;e that offered.&mdash;After he was in the woods it was out of his power to exchange them for better, and puni&s;hments for neglect of duty was out of the que&s;tion. The principles upon which the hor&s;es were employed, induced the drivers who were chiefly parties in the bu&s;ine&s;s, to lo&s;e and other|ways de&s;troy them, rather than return them to their owners; by this means the proprietors had a high apprai&s;ement paid them for their hor&s;es, and daily pay for &s;ervices, until they were lo&s;t; by adding to the above the negligence of centinels, he accounted for the number of hor&s;es lo&s;t, which in his opinion it was out of General Harmar's power to prevent.&mdash;After the army was arranged, they continued their march without any material occurrence, until the 13th, when the hor&s;e fell in with two Indians, and took one of them pri&s;oner, who informed that the Indians were not in force at the Maumee village.&mdash;This day they reached a place called the <HI>French Store,</HI> at which place a Frenchman, who was then with the General as a guide had lived. He informed that the village was about ten leagues di&s;tant. From this place, on the morning of the 14th Colonel Hardin was detached with 600 men, to endeavor to &s;urpri&s;e the Miami village; the army moved at the &s;ame time, and although it rained the whole day, they continued their march with diligence until late.&mdash;The hor&s;e were ordered to be tied up this night, to enable the army to move early the next day, which it did. This diligence of the army on its march induced him to believe, the General was endeavoring to guard again&s;t any di&s;a&s;ter that might happen to Colonel Hardin, which he was of opinion would have been in his power; for Colonel Hardin had not gained more than four miles of the army, on the fir&s;t day's march.&mdash;On the 17th, the army arrived at the Miami village; here were evident &s;igns of the enemy having quitted the place in the greate&s;t confu&s;ion. Indian dogs and cows came into their camp this day, which induced to believe the families were not far off.&mdash;A party of 300 men, with three days provi&s;ion, under the command of Colonel Trotter, was ordered as he under|&s;tood, to examine the country around their camp, but contrary to the General's orders returned the &s;ame evening.&mdash;This conduct of the Colonel's, did not meet the General's approbation, and Colonel Hardin, anxious for the charac|ter of his countrymen, wi&s;hed to have the command of the &s;ame detachment for the remaining two days, which was given him.&mdash;This command marched on the morning of the 19th, and was the &s;ame day &s;hamefully defeated.&mdash; Colonel Hardin told him that the number which attacked him, did not exceed 150, and that had his people fought, or even made a &s;hew of forming to fight, he was certain the Indians would have run. But on the Indians firing, which was at a great di&s;tance, the militia ran, numbers throwing away their arms, nor could he ever rally them; Major Ray confirmed the &s;ame. He did not know what influenced the detachment on the 21&s;t. But from the enemy being flu&s;hed with &s;ucce&s;s on the 19th, it became nece&s;&s;ary if in his power to give them a check, to prevent the army from being harra&s;&s;ed on its return; which they might have done, will readily be granted by every one who has the lea&s;t knowledge of the Indians, and an army encumbered with cattle and pack-hor&s;es, much worn down; and altho' the detachment was not &s;o fortunate, as was rea&s;onably to have been expected, yet, he firmly believed it prevented the Savages from annoying their rear, as they never made their appearance after. With re&s;pect to &s;upporting that detachment, which con&s;i&s;ted of four hundred cho&s;en troops, he always believed them &s;uperior to one hundred and fifty Indians, which was the greate&s;t number as yet di&s;covered, had it not been
<PB N="4" REF="023905_0007_0FC29869F98F4678">
for mi&s;conduct and di&s;obedience of orders by the officers who were on the command. He under&s;tood that Major Ray's battalion had been advanced to cover them, which was as many as could po&s;&s;ibly have been &s;pared, taking into view, that tho&s;e in camp could not be depended on, and many were with|out arms, having thrown them away. To &s;upport with the whole army, was impracticable; the pack-hor&s;es, being weak and greatly reduced in numbers. The artilery hor&s;es very much reduced, and unable to undergo much more fatigue, but at the certain lo&s;s of the artillery; as it was, they were obliged to &s;end to Fort Wa&s;hington for hor&s;es to a&s;&s;i&s;t in hauling it in. The march of the army was regular and well conducted, as was po&s;&s;ible to be done with militia. With re&s;pect to the General's conduct, report &s;ays, that he was intoxicated all the campain, and unable to execute the important duties of his &s;tation; he had mentioned his commanding the artillery, which was po&s;ted at the head of the centre column, and here the General chiefly was during the march, of cour&s;e he had an opportunity of &s;eeing, and being with him through the day; in the morning he received his orders from him, and when they halted to encamp, he chiefly pointed out the ground where the artillery &s;hould be po&s;ted; his duty called him often to his tent, before they marched in the morning, and after they halted in the evening, in &s;hort, had he been given to drunkenne&s;s, he had as good an opportunity of &s;eeing it, as any other officer in the army. &mdash;Yet he declared, that from their leaving Fort Wa&s;hington, until their return, he never &s;aw General Harmar intoxicated, or &s;o as to render him unfit for the execution of any duties.&mdash;In him, and his abilities, as an officer, he placed the greate&s;t confidence, never doubting in his orders, but obeying with chear|fulne&s;s, being con&s;cious they were the production of experience and &s;ound judgment.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion 1&s;t. <HI>By the Court.</HI>&mdash;What were your rea&s;ons for thinking puni&s;h|ment for neglect of duty, out of the que&s;tion?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. The &s;tate of the army being &s;uch, that it obliged the General not to do any thing that would tend to irritate the militia.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Is it your opinion that the organization of the army was a judicious one, &s;uch a one as was well calculated for the &s;ecurity of the troops?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. It is my opinion, that it was the mo&s;t judicious organization that could be made, and calculated for the intere&s;t of the United States.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Is it your opinion, that the order of encampment was a judicious one, and that the extreme parts were &s;o di&s;po&s;ed as were cal|culated to give &s;ecurity to the army and its appendages?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think no better di&s;po&s;ition could have been made.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Do you think the order of battle calculated &s;o as to have been ea&s;y of execution and ea&s;ily formed?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think it was the be&s;t that could have been formed, and well cal|culated for covering the appendages of the army.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Do you know the General's motives for making the detachments of the 14th, 19th and 21&s;t October?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I do not know the General's motives for making the detachment of the 14th, but I &s;uppo&s;e it was for the purpo&s;e of &s;urprizing the <HI>Maumee</HI> village, as we had taken an Indian the day before, who gave us information, that the Indians were in great confu&s;ion there, and that they were not in force, and very much divided in their councils. We expected to &s;urprize them be|fore they &s;eperated.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> What were the movements of the army after that detachment was made?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. We continued our march next day until an expre&s;s arrived to in|form us that the Indians had evacuated the village, when we halted.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> What was the di&s;tance between the main body and the detachment?</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="023905_0008_0FC29870A41CEF20">An&s;wer About four miles.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Do you think that the army was within &s;upporting di&s;tance when that detachment was made?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. On the fir&s;t day we were.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Do you know what induced the General to make the detachment of the 19th?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. The day preceding that on which the detachment was made, In|dian dogs and cattle came into our camp, which led us to believe the Indians were near us, more e&s;pecially as they had left their village in &s;uch ha&s;te. I &s;uppo&s;e it was for the purpo&s;e of examining the country around the camp. A detachment of 300 men under the command of Col. Trotter, with three days provi&s;ion, was made on the 18th, with orders to continue out three days, but which neverthele&s;s returned into camp the &s;ame evening. The General ap|peared di&s;plea&s;ed at their di&s;obedience of orders; Col. Hardin wi&s;hing to re|trieve the character of the militia, a&s;ked the General's permi&s;&s;ion to take out the &s;ame detachment on the 19th, which was granted.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> What motives led Col. Hardin at &s;uch a di&s;tance as 15 miles from camp?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I under&s;tood that he got on the trails of the Indians, and that he had di&s;covered an Indian on hor&s;eback, about one mile from where he fell in with their main body.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Upon hearing of the defeat of that detachment, did you under&s;tand that the General ordered any &s;upport?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I don't know that he did, the fir&s;t intelligence of the defeat was brought us by tho&s;e who were defeated, late in the evening.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Do you know the motives for the detachment of the 21&s;t, either from the General him&s;elf or any of his confidential officers?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I do not know from the General, but it was my opinion, as well as that of other officers, that the defeat of the 19th had &s;o panick &s;truck the army, that had the Indians attacked on the retreat, it might have been lo&s;t, which induced the General to &s;end the detachment in the rear.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Had the General ordered another detachment upon the ground, where the defeat of the 19th happened; do you think the Militia would have gone, or would they have mutinied?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I am rather inclined to think they would not have gone.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> With re&s;pect to the general conduct of General Harmar in the cour&s;e of the campaign, is it your opinion that it was judicious, and in every re&s;pect commendable?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I do think it was perfectly &s;o; I have the greate&s;t confidence in, and good opinion of his military abilities.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Strong</HI> being &s;worn, depo&s;ed&mdash;That he knew of no circum&s;tance during the whole campaign that could in his opinion, affect the military cha|racter of the General.&mdash;That the organization of the army, appeared to his judgment, extremely judicious, and &s;uch he believed was the general opinion of the officers.&mdash;That the order of march &s;eemed to him no le&s;s judicious, and military in all parts&mdash;that the order of encampment and battle, met if he mi&s;|took not, with the approbation of every officer able to judge of it&mdash;that the motives which influenced the detachments of the 14th, 19th and 21&s;t October, appeared to him to be a que&s;tion that could only be an&s;wered by the General, or perhaps by his confidential officers, or tho&s;e more immediately attached to his per&s;on&mdash;that he had rea&s;on to believe, that tho&s;e detachments were not properly &s;upported, but it was his opinion at the &s;ame time, that the fault lay not with the General, who had given orders in each ca&s;e, that were not com|plied with, at lea&s;t until it was too late.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> With re&s;pect to &s;upport in the action of the 21&s;t, was there any &s;upport ordered that you know of?</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="023905_0009_0FC74445805ACE18">An&s;wer. I was pre&s;ent when the order was given to Major <HI>Ray</HI> to move with his battalion to &s;upport Major <HI>Wyllys.</HI></P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Do you know what di&s;tance they marched for that purpo&s;e, or how long they were gone from the army?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I do not recollect perfectly how long, but I think it was not long.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By General Harmar.</HI> Is it your opinion that the making the detachment under Major <HI>Wyllys</HI> was attended with good con&s;equences to the army, or not?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think it was attended with u&s;eful con&s;equences to the army.</P>
<P>The Court then adjourned to 3 o'clock P. M.</P>
<P>Three o'clock P. M.&mdash;The Court having met agreeable to adjournment&mdash;</P>
<P>Lieutenant <HI>Hart&s;horn</HI> was &s;worn, and depo&s;ed&mdash;That he knew of no cir|cum&s;tances during the whole campaign that could in his opinion affect the military conduct of the General&mdash;that the organization of the army appeared to his judgment extremely judicious, and &s;uch he believed was the general opinion of the officers&mdash;that the order of march &s;eemed to him no le&s;s judi|cious and military in all its parts&mdash;that the order of encampment and battle, met if he mi&s;took not with the approbation of every officer able to judge of it&mdash; that the motives which influenced the detachments of the 14th, 19th and 21&s;t of October, appeared to him to be a que&s;tion, that could only be an&s;wered by the General, and perhaps by his confidential officers, or tho&s;e more imme|diately attached to his per&s;on&mdash;that as to the que&s;tion of &s;upport, he had rea|&s;on to believe the detachment was not properly &s;upported, but it was his opi|nion at the &s;ame time, that the fault lays not with the General, who had given orders in each ca&s;e, that was not complied with at lea&s;t until it was too late.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Do you know, Sir, in the cour&s;e of the campaign, from the time the army left Fort Wa&s;hington, until its return to that place, any circum&s;tance that could militate again&s;t the military character of the General?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I know of none.</P>

<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> So far as you are a judge of the organization of the army, do you think it was proper and judicious?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. So far as I could judge, I think it was extremely judicious.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Had you any conver&s;ation with the officers of the army on the &s;ubject of the organization of the army?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I had, and with tho&s;e who I think were judges, who thought it to be very good.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Did the arrangement of march appear to be &s;o connected, as to be able to &s;upport each other in ca&s;e of attack?</P>

<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> In what manner did you attack the enemy, was it in columns, or did you di&s;play in any regular order?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. We were attacked in front of columns.</P>

<P>En&s;ign <HI>Morgan</HI> being &s;worn, depo&s;ed, as followeth&mdash;That as he did not join the army under the command of General Harmar until the 13th October, he was unacquainted with its progre&s;s until that time, when the army appeared in good order. As he was an en&s;ign, and carried the &s;tandard every fourth or fifth day after his joining the army, he was frequently near the General, and always ob&s;erved, as far as he could judge, the greate&s;t propriety of con|duct.&mdash;As to the organization of the army, the order of march, encampment and battle, they are perfectly explained in the general orders&mdash;As to the motives which influenced the General in &s;ending out the different detachments of the 14th, 19th and 21&s;t, he was unacquainted&mdash;the opinion he took up concerning the one of the 14th was, that the General finding the army di&s;|covered, re&s;olved to make a pu&s;h for the towns before they were abandoned, and as he could not do it with his whole army formed the detachment on the 14th under Colonel Hardin; the motive for the detachment on the 19th he was utterly unacquainted with, that of the 21&s;t as he &s;uppo&s;ed, was to pick up any &s;traggling Indians who might have come to the towns, to &s;ee what they had been about, but without an idea of the Indians being in force.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Do you think that the party of militia that were attached to Major <HI>Wyllys'</HI> detachment, was &s;ufficient to have defeated the Indians if they had done their duty?</P>

<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> What time did you return to the army from the action of the 21&s;t?</P>

<P>An&s;wer. I think they were very di&s;orderly, and very inattentive to their duty, and &s;ome appearances of mutiny among them, with both officers and men, and turned out upon one occa&s;ion particularly, to oppo&s;e a puni&s;hment that had been ordered by the General.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Do you remember any thing of General <HI>Harmar</HI>'s ordering his cannon to fire upon them?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I remember that General <HI>Harmar</HI> once &s;aid, that if the militia behaved again, in &s;o &s;candalous a manner, that he would order his cannon to fire on them.</P>
<P>En&s;ign <HI>Britt</HI> being &s;worn, depo&s;ed&mdash;That with re&s;pect to the per&s;onal con|duct of General <HI>Harmar,</HI> he knew that he was indefatigable in making arrangements for the execution of the plans which had been formed for the expedition; and he al&s;o knew that the difficulties were great which the General had to encounter in organizing the militia, and in endeavouring to e&s;tabli&s;h that harmony, which was wanting in their commanding officers Colonels <HI>Hardin</HI> and <HI>Trotter;</HI> which he accompli&s;hed apparently to their &s;atis|faction&mdash;that he was at all times diligent in attending to the conduct of the officers in the different departments of the army, and that he was always ready to attend to &s;uch occurrences, as were con&s;equent to the &s;ame, and the
<PB N="9" REF="023905_0012_0FC7445901FF5A40">
nece&s;&s;ary exertions to have his orders carried into execution were not wanting; but that there were great deficiencies on the part of the militia, either owing to the want of authority in &s;ome of their officers, or from their ignorance or inattention&mdash;that the generality of them, &s;carcely de&s;erved the name of any thing like &s;oldiers&mdash;that they were mo&s;tly <HI>&s;ub&s;titutes</HI> for others, who had nothing to &s;timulate them to do their duty&mdash;that as to the di&s;po&s;itions for the order of march, form of encampment, and order of battle, they were matters which he being a young officer could &s;ay little about; he pre&s;umed they would an&s;wer for them&s;elves&mdash;that the General's motives for detaching Colonel <HI>Hardin</HI> on the 14th October when they were told they were but 10 leagues from the Indian towns, he &s;uppo&s;ed to be, from information they received by a pri&s;oner who was taken on the 13th, that the Indians at the <HI>Maumee</HI> village were in great con&s;ternation and confu&s;ion, and the pro&s;pects were, they might be ea&s;ily defeated if found in that &s;ituation&mdash;that in order to &s;upport this de|tachment, the hor&s;es of the army were ordered to be tied up at night, &s;o that the whole army might be ready to march early in the morning, which was done accordingly, and that when Colonel <HI>Hardin</HI> reached the village, the main body was not more than 5 or 6 miles in his rear&mdash;that the detachment under Colonel <HI>Trotter</HI> was ordered to reconnoitre for 3 days the neighbourhood, to endeavour to find out the Savages, who had fled from their towns&mdash;that this party returned the evening of the &s;ame day they &s;tarted, and next morning Colonel <HI>Hardin</HI> marched with the &s;ame party and fell in with the Indians&mdash;that an engagement en&s;ued, in which he was routed, owing to the cowardly beha|viour of the militia under his command&mdash;that the motives which he conceived led to detaching the party under Major <HI>Wyllys</HI> on the 21&s;t were, that the Indians having avoided engaging the whole army, would collect at their towns, and harra&s;s the rear and flanks, as much as po&s;&s;ible on its return, and a &s;troke at them before they could a&s;&s;emble in large bodies, would prevent their doing it with much effect&mdash;that the party accordingly met with the Indians, and a battle followed in which numbers were killed on both &s;ides&mdash; that the moment the news of this arrived in camp Major <HI>Ray</HI> with his batta|lion of Kentuckey militia, was ordered to march to the &s;upport of Major <HI>Wyllys,</HI> but that he did not proceed far before he returned.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Did you at any time in the cour&s;e of the campaign perceive that General <HI>Harmar</HI> was intoxicated?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I did not, I lived in the General's family and &s;hould have known it, had any thing of that kind happened.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Alli&s;on</HI> being &s;worn, depo&s;ed&mdash;That the organization of the army, the orders of march, encampment and battle, were que&s;tions which would be more amply an&s;wered by a reference to the orderly book, than they could be from the mere relation of an individual, or from any other official information&mdash;that as to the motives which influenced the detachments of the 14th, 19th and 21&s;t October, tho&s;e were que&s;tions, which if an&s;wered at all, mu&s;t be merely &s;peculative opinions, which it was not always prudent to divulge, nor would they in his judgment, be admitted as evidence, or even peru&s;ed by any tribunal, and therefore were nugatory, and as he had not the honour of being in the cabinet, it was utterly out of his power to give any other&mdash;that as &s;oon as the news arrived of the misfortune of the third detachment, a reinforcement was immediately ordered by the General, but whether it actually &s;et out, or what induced it to return, he could not &s;ay, or whether &s;ufficiently &s;trong, he did not conceive him&s;elf a judge. His &s;ituation as &s;urgeon, prevented a minute attention to every, or indeed any of the arrangements of the army; yet, as far as they came within his view, or knowledge, they were judicious and uniform, that every attention was paid to the army by the General in every &s;ituation, that every &s;tep was taken by him, that prudence and military knowledge could &s;ugge&s;t, the circum&s;tances of the army would permit, or that nece&s;&s;ity required.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="023905_0013_0FC2988A4797C578">Lieutenant <HI>Denny</HI> being &s;worn, depo&s;ed&mdash;That General <HI>Harmar</HI> began his preparations for the campaign &s;oon after the 15th July, and that every day was employed in the mo&s;t indu&s;trious manner, that the calculations for provi&s;ions, hor&s;es and &s;tores, were immediately made out, and orders given accordingly, that great exertions were u&s;ed by Captain <HI>Fergu&s;on</HI> to get in readine&s;s the artillery, and military &s;tores, and indeed every officer was bu&s;ily engaged under the eye of the General, in fitting out nece&s;&s;ary matter for the expedition, but particularly the Quarter-Ma&s;ter, not a moment's time appeared to be lo&s;t&mdash; 15th and 16th September the Kentuckey militia arrived, but in&s;tead of &s;eeing active rifle-men, &s;uch as is &s;uppo&s;ed to inhabit the frontiers, they &s;aw a parcel of men, young in the country, and totally unexperienced in the bu&s;ine&s;s they came upon, &s;o much &s;o, that many of them did not even know how to keep their arms in firing order, indeed their whole object &s;eemed to be nothing more than to &s;ee the country, without rendering any &s;ervice whatever.

The militia la&s;t mentioned were &s;imilar to the other, <HI>too many &s;ub&s;titutes.</HI> The General lo&s;t no time in organizing them, tho' he met with many difficulties&mdash; the colonels were di&s;puting for the command, and the one mo&s;t popular was lea&s;t intituled to it. The General's de&s;ign was to reconcile all parties, which he accompli&s;hed after much trouble. The Kentuckians compo&s;ed three battalions, under the Majors <HI>Hall, M'Mullen</HI> and <HI>Ray,</HI> with Lieutenant Colonel Commandant <HI>Trotter</HI> at their head.

The line of march was certainly one of the be&s;t that could be adopted, and great attention was paid to keep the officers with their commands in proper order, and the pack-hor&s;es, &amp;c. as compact as po&s;&s;ible. The order of en|campment appeared to be well calculated, not only for defence, but to pre&s;erve
<PB N="11" REF="023905_0014_0FC298964CC99AF8">
the hor&s;es and cattle from being lo&s;t; however, notwith&s;tanding every pre|caution was taken, and repeated orders given to the hor&s;e-ma&s;ters, to hopple well their hor&s;es, and directions to the officers and men not to &s;uffer any to pa&s;s through the lines, many of them, owing to the carele&s;sne&s;s of the militia, and the &s;carcity of food, (tho' great attention was paid in the choice of ground) broke loo&s;e and &s;trayed thro' the lines after night, and even pa&s;&s;ed the chain of &s;entries which encircled the camp and were lo&s;t. Patroles of hor&s;emen were ordered out every morning by day-light, to &s;cour the neighbouring woods, and to bring in any hor&s;es that might have broke through the lines, and a &s;tanding order directed the pickets to turn out &s;mall parties, and drive in every hor&s;e. This was done he believed, to expedite the movement of the army. There was no le&s;s attention paid to &s;ecuring the cattle, every evening when the army halted, the guard which was compo&s;ed of a commi&s;&s;ioned officer and thirty or thirty-five men, built a yard always within the chain of &s;entries, and &s;ome|times in the &s;quare of encampment, and placed a &s;ufficient number of &s;entries round the enclo&s;ure, which effectually pre&s;erved them, there was not more than two or three head lo&s;t during the whole of the campaign&mdash;On the 13th of October early in the morning a patrole of hor&s;emen captured a Shawanee Indian&mdash;On the 14th October Colonel Hardin was detached with 600 light troops to pu&s;h for the Miami village, he believed that this detachment was &s;ent forward in con&s;equence of the intelligence gained of the Shawanee pri&s;oner, which was, that the Indians were clearing out as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, and that if they did not make more ha&s;te, the towns would be evacuated before their arrival. As it was impo&s;&s;ible for the main body of the army, with all their train, to ha&s;ten their march much, the General thought proper to &s;end on Colonel Hardin in hopes of taking a few, before they would all get off. This night the hor&s;es were all ordered to be tied up, that the army might &s;tart by day-light, on purpo&s;e to keep as near Colonel Hardin as po&s;&s;ible, the di&s;tance to the Indian towns when the detachment marched a-head was about thirty-five miles&mdash;On the 15th every exertion was u&s;ed to get forward the main body this day, they found that the advanced party had gained but very few miles&mdash;On the 16th in the evening met an expre&s;s from Colonel Hardin who had got into the village, informing the General that the enemy had abandoned every place. On the 17th about noon, the army arrived at the Omee towns&mdash;On the 18th Col. Trotter was ordered out with three hundred men, militia and regulars, to reconnoitre the country, and to endeavour to make &s;ome di&s;coveries of the enemy; he marched but a few miles, when his advanced hor&s;emen came upon two Indians and killed them; the Colonel was contented with this victory and returned to camp. Colonel Hardin was di&s;plea&s;ed becau&s;e Colonel Trotter did not execute his orders, and reque&s;ted the General to give him the command of the party, it was granted, and accordingly Hardin marched next morning, but he believed he had not two thirds of his number when two miles from camp, for to his certain knowledge, many of the militia left him on the march and returned to their companies. Whether he knew it or not he could not tell, but that he proceeded on with a determination to trace &s;ome fre&s;h &s;igns of the enemy&mdash;he believed the plan was merely to gain &s;ome knowledge of the Savages. He at length came upon a party not exceeding one hundred, but was wor&s;ted, owing entirely as he was informed to the &s;candalous behaviour of the militia, many of whom never fired a &s;hot, but ran off at the fir&s;t noi&s;e of the Indians, and left the few regulars to be &s;acrificed, &s;ome of them never halted until they cro&s;&s;ed the Ohio. The army in the mean time was employed burning and de&s;troying the hou&s;es and corn, &s;hifting their po&s;ition from one town to another&mdash;that on the 21&s;t of October the army having burned five villages, be&s;ides the capital town, and con&s;umed or de&s;troyed near twenty thou&s;and bu&s;hels of corn in ears, took up the line of march on the rout back to Fort Wa&s;hington and encamped about 8 miles from the ruins&mdash;that about nine o'clock P. M. the General ordered out 400 choice men, militia and regulars,
<PB N="12" REF="023905_0015_0FC29897C2190490">
under the command of Major Wyllys to return to the towns, intending to &s;urprize any parties, that might be a&s;&s;embled there, &s;uppo&s;ing that the Indians would collect to &s;ee how things were left. The General had felt the enemy, knew their &s;trength, and calculated much upon the &s;ucce&s;s of this enterprize&mdash; that it was the general opinion the force of the Savages was nothing equal to this detachment, and unle&s;s by &s;ome &s;uch means, there was no po&s;&s;ibility of getting any advantage of them, however the be&s;t laid plan was in &s;ome mea&s;ure defeated, by the di&s;obedience of the militia, who ran in pur&s;uit of &s;mall parties, and left Major Wyllys un&s;upported&mdash;the con&s;equence was, that the Major with mo&s;t part of the regulars were killed, and our lo&s;s was equal if not greater than the &s;avages&mdash;that the intention of this detachment was evident to all the army, and would have an&s;wered the fulle&s;t expectations, provided a due obe|dience had been ob&s;erved on the part of the militia&mdash;to provide again&s;t di&s;obe|dience of orders was what he believed no one would think of, and had it not been the ca&s;e the Major in his opinion might have returned crowned with laurels. That the main body waited for the return of this detachment but to their mor|tification about eleven o'clock A. M. of the 22d a fellow who ran back from the field, gave them information of Major Wylly's misfortune&mdash;General Harmar immediately di&s;patched Major Ray with his battalion to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the par|ties, but the Major did not get the length, before he met Colonel Hardin return|ing to camp with his wounded. He was led to believe that about this time, the General lo&s;t the confidence he had in the militia, tho&s;e of them among the dead, were of the be&s;t men, that the effective &s;trength was very much reduced by &s;ickne&s;s and otherways&mdash;the regular troops did not furni&s;h more than two hundred they were in his opinion very in&s;ufficient, and he was al&s;o clearly of opinion, that had the enemy made an attack upon their camp that evening or the morning following, the militia were &s;o panick &s;truck that very few of them would have &s;tood, the con&s;equences that would have happened, &s;tared every per&s;on with horror, the &s;ick and wounded, and all the &s;tores, artillery, &amp;c. would have fallen a prey to the &s;avages&mdash;that this was al&s;o the opinion of &s;everal of the principal officers who advi&s;ed General Harmar of the danger of attempting to return to the towns, from the time it would take up, and the probability that the delay would give the &s;avages time to collect from di&s;tant quarters. He ob&s;erved that the 22d October was employed in fixing biers for the wounded, and in making repairs. He al&s;o ob&s;erved that the fro&s;t had de&s;troyed the food early on their march out and that the hor&s;es of the army were now become very much reduced, &s;o much &s;o, that it was utterly impo&s;&s;ible for the main body to perform any thing rapidly, and to get back upon the road which they had &s;o lately pa&s;&s;ed, was attended with difficulty, he &s;aid that the greate&s;t attention was paid, the little army was kept compact, and vigilance was the word from all who had any reputation to lo&s;e&mdash;That the militia on their return began to be refractory, &s;hewing great &s;igns of a revolt, di&s;charging their pieces in open defiance of the general orders, &s;ome of them however were detected and puni&s;hed, which gave umbrage and was afterwards the cau&s;e of many ill-natured reports, &s;pread without any foundation, to injure the General's reputation. He further ob&s;erved that the army returned by &s;low marches, back to Fort Wa&s;hington&mdash;That General Harmar's conduct during the campaign, was ob&s;erved to be &s;ober, &s;teady, and attentive to the &s;ervice, and as his duty required him to be frequently near the General, &s;hould certainly have di&s;covered it, had he been at any time intoxicated, as has been reported. Every evening as duly as the army halted, the General made his remarks for that day, and i&s;&s;ued orders for the movement and arrangements for the next, and every morning he was found among the fir&s;t prepared for the field.</P>

<P>SEPTEMBER 20th.&mdash;The Court having met according to adjournment&mdash;</P>
<P>Major <HI>Ziegler</HI> being &s;worn, depo&s;ed,&mdash;That &s;ome time had elap&s;ed before the different corps and battalions could be organized, on account of rank&mdash;the militia officers di&s;puting for the command; and after a good deal of exertion by General Harmar, they commenced their march on the 30th September 1790. The militia under Colonel Hardin, having been &s;ent on a few days before, and on the 3d October, they joined the militia, and took up their line of march, and encamped as mentioned in the General's orders. He ob&s;erved that the orders of march and encampment, motions, &amp;c. &amp;c. were &s;uch as would have done honor to the fir&s;t officers either in America or Europe. All nece&s;|&s;ary precautions were ob&s;erved to gain the point General Harmar &s;et out for. On the 14th October he was ordered to advance with Colonel Hardin com|manding 50 rank and file of the federal troops, being part of &s;ix hundred men&mdash;at ten o'clock they took up their march, and before they left the ground the re&s;t of the army was ordered to parade and follow them, which he remembered to have &s;een the army from an eminence, as he inclined towards the left, with the column to which he was attached. The 15th about three o'clock P. M. they arrived at the Miami villages, and at the &s;ame time Colonel Hardin &s;ent an expre&s;s to General Harmar, to inform him that the villages were evacuated. It was his opinion that the motives for this manoeuvre was in con&s;equence of a <HI>Shewanu&s;e</HI> which they took a few days before, and who acquainted the General that the Indians were ready to move away, the army arrived the 17th&mdash;in the forenoon and that day as well as the re&s;t they were all bu&s;y in de&s;troying the Indian corn, &amp;c. &amp;c. He further ob&s;erved that on the 18th Colonel Trotter was detached with three hundred men of militia, including thirty federal troops, but that the Colonel returned the &s;ame day without bringing any information, and that on the morning following, Colonel Hardin took command of the &s;ame party, and advanced to procure &s;ome knowledge of the enemy, and on his di&s;covering the enemy tho&s;e which were in the rear would not come up and &s;upport tho&s;e engaged in front, and very few of tho&s;e in front, &s;topped but ran and the militia fled in a &s;hameful manner, and the few federal troops not &s;upported, fell a &s;acrifice; the Major &s;aid that a &s;erjeant of militia behaving very improper at that time, could not be bro't to trial, on account of a brother of his being a captain, and who made parties that would have been attended with bad con&s;equences, &s;hould he be puni&s;hed, as his brother declared he would rai&s;e &s;ome men, and bid defiance. That, on the 21&s;t October 1790, after they had de&s;troyed a great quantity of corn and five or &s;ix villages, they took up their line of march towards Fort Wa&s;hington, and at night Major Wyllys was detached with four hundred choice men, in hopes to &s;urprize a body that might be at the ruins&mdash; this party was &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ufficiently &s;trong for any number of the enemy embodied. Major Wyllys marched in three columns with intention to join with the right and left columns, at the Miami village, but that the column under the command of Major M'Mullen fell in with a &s;mall party of Indians, they followed them and di&s;obeyed the orders of Major Wyllys, in pur&s;uing them and leaving the others un&s;upported, and &s;o was the left wing, which would not have been if they had joined him, as he &s;uppo&s;ed it to be &s;uffi|ciently &s;trong for that party. He al&s;o remembered very well being on picket, or commanding one of the wings as captain <HI>au Carr&eacute;e,</HI> when the fir&s;t men arrived with the intelligence, that their party had gained ground&mdash;and at that very in&s;tant General Harmar ordered Major Ray with his battalion to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e engaged, lea&s;t that information &s;hould not prove true, but he went two miles or two and a half then meeting the &s;cattered detachment, returned to the great &s;urprize of General Harmar&mdash;that the &s;ucce&s;s of the
<PB N="14" REF="023905_0017_0FC2989FF7C56F70">
detachment was defeated in a great mea&s;ure by the militia running a-head, and leaving Major Wyllys un&s;upported.&mdash;The army remained this day in dre&s;&s;ing and fixing the wounded&mdash;the militia behaving &s;o bad in &s;everal in&s;tances, de&s;troyed every confidence the General had in them, otherwi&s;e he would have returned with the army, but as things were &s;ituated, it would have been running too great a hazard. The army returned back to Fort Wa&s;hing|ton, nothing appeared wanting on the part of the General, every attention was paid to the army to guard again&s;t &s;urprize. The Major ob&s;erved that there had been very injurious reports, &s;pread about General Harmar, but if he was to be credited, he knew of nothing that could be alledged again&s;t him, or that could po&s;&s;ibly injure his reputation, in any re&s;pect, the good of the &s;ervice, appeared to be his con&s;tant &s;tudy.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> I think, Sir, you &s;aid that on the 15th at three o'clock P. M. you arrived at the Miami village, what did you do after your arrival there, were the militia in good order?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. When we arrived we were very much fatigued, having marched twenty-eight miles that day, I directed that my own men &s;hould not go thirty yards from camp. The militia like a rabble &s;trolled into the neighbouring villages, in parties of thirty or forty after plunder, &s;uch was the &s;ituation that one hundred and fifty Warriors might have beat us off the ground.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Did you &s;ee any de&s;ire in the militia to return to the ground where Major Wyllys was defeated, or do you &s;uppo&s;e they would have gone had they been ordered to go?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I &s;uppo&s;e they would not have gone&mdash;they appeared to be panick &s;truck.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Are you of opinion that the per&s;onal conduct of the General was regular, &s;teady and tended to the good of the &s;ervice?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. Undoubtedly &s;o, and very much to the credit of the General.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> From your long knowledge of &s;ervice do you think that from the complexion of the troops General Harmar had to organize, that the formation of the army was judicious?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think it was.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. Do you think that the order of march and encampment, was calculated to &s;ecure every part of the army and its appendages?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. Yes, very much &s;o.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> From your experience, do you think that the order of battle directed by General Harmar was judicious?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. Yes, perfectly &s;o.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Doyle</HI> being &s;worn, depo&s;ed&mdash;That previous to the campaign going out la&s;t fall every day was employed in the mo&s;t indu&s;trious manner&mdash;on the arrival of the Kentuckey militia they were all much di&s;appointed, that in&s;tead of &s;eeing complete rifle-men, many were armed with old mu&s;kets, much out of repair&mdash;the General immediately ordered them repaired with all expedition. He referred the Court as to the line of march, to the General's orderly book, and informed the Court, that the per&s;onal conduct of the General through the campaign was uniform and &s;teady, and that had the General's orders been &s;trictly obeyed, he was confident he mu&s;t have come home with honour. As to what influenced the General to make detachments he could not &s;ay&mdash;he was in the detachment of the 14th October, and that the behaviour of the militia in that detachment, was very di&s;graceful, they ran from town to town in pur&s;uit of plunder, contrary to orders, and on the arrival of General Harmar at the town two thirds of them di&s;per&s;ed in the &s;ame manner&mdash;the General ordered cannon to be fired, merely to collect them, and he at the &s;ame time harrangued the officers informing them of the ill-con&s;equences of &s;uch conduct. That the General's not returning to the village after the ill-&s;ucce&s;s of the la&s;t detachment, he believed was owing to his not having confidence in his army. At that time there was a great rumour in camp, the general voice was for
<PB N="15" REF="023905_0018_0FC298A7806DF470">
returning, their hor&s;es were much worn down, and the militia &s;hewed great &s;igns of revolt. The reports that the militia circulated after their return home, and which was much to the prejudice of General Harmar, was he believed owing to the General's having a few of them puni&s;hed for di&s;obedience of orders, he thought it certain, that they had no grounds for their ill-natured reports, and that General Harmar would have been ju&s;tifiable in arre&s;ting one or two of the mo&s;t popular field-officers, and &s;ending them home with di&s;|grace&mdash;but a thing of that kind he ob&s;erved would have broke up the army. He knew of no part of the General's conduct during the whole of the campaign, that could be cen&s;ured, without it was &s;hewing too much lenity to the militia, and thanking them for their conduct, when they merited puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Do you think that the &s;ending the detachment under Major Wyllys tended eventually to the pre&s;ervation of the army?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think the Indians would have harra&s;&s;ed us very much on our return if that detachment had not been made.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By General Harmar.</HI> Did the enemy annoy the army at all after that detachment was made?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. No they did not.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By General Harmar.</HI> Did we &s;ee any Indians afterwards?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. We did not.</P>
<P>Lieutenant <HI>Sedam</HI> being &s;worn, depo&s;ed&mdash;That he had the honour of &s;erving under General Harmar la&s;t fall on a campaign again&s;t the Indians of the Maumee village, and that he &s;aw nothing in his conduct, but what he thought was very proper, that relative to the organization of the army, he was but little acquainted, and therefore referred the Court to the General's orderly book&mdash;that he was entirely unacquainted with General Harmar's motives for &s;ending out the different detachments, and if tho&s;e detachments were not properly &s;upported, it did not appear to him to be the fault of the General, for the militia were a poor &s;et, and behaved very ill upon all occa|&s;ions&mdash;that after the fir&s;t action, he heard Major Paul of the Penn&s;ylvania militia &s;ay&mdash;he hoped General Harmar would not put any confidence in them, for he was &s;ure they would not fight.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By General Harmar.</HI> When I was upon the return at <HI>Chilicoth&eacute;e,</HI> I ordered one of the militia to be whipped, I was informed that Colonel Trotter and Major M'Mullen &s;aid I had no right to puni&s;h them&mdash;did you hear me reprimand them for that conduct?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. After the man was puni&s;hed, I heard you &s;ay to Colonel Trotter and Major M'Mullen, that you would &s;end them both home with di&s;grace, for their bad conduct.</P>
<P>En&s;ign <HI>Arm&s;trong</HI> being &s;worn, depo&s;ed as follows&mdash;That the militia being ordered into battalions and organized in which he knew the General met with great difficulty&mdash;that the order of march and encampment could be better a&s;certained by a reference to the orderly book, than any thing he could add on the &s;ubject&mdash;that the conduct of the militia in every in&s;tance &s;eemed calcu|lated to ob&s;truct every mea&s;ure adopted by General Harmar&mdash;that the conduct of the General in every particular was perfectly con&s;i&s;tent and uniform, and every &s;tep taken by him appeared to be the dictates of prudence and &s;obriety&mdash; that what induced the General to &s;end out the detachments was wholly unknown to him, and therefore unan&s;werable by him.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Arm&s;trong</HI> being &s;worn, depo&s;ed&mdash;That on report being made to General Harmar, by Major M'Mullen and others, that the tracks of women and children had been &s;een on the route leading towards the Kickapoo towns, a North-we&s;t cour&s;e, and &s;uppo&s;ing the enemy had left their families and bag|gage not far di&s;tant from camp, Gen. Harmar, on the morning of October 18th, detached Colonel Trotter, Colonel Hall, Major Ray, and Major M'Mullen, with thirty federal troops, the mounted infantry, part of the cavalry, and a detachment of militia, amounting in the whole to 300 men.&mdash;After they had
<PB N="16" REF="023905_0019_0FC298A8F87D4DC0">
proceeded about one mile, the cavalry gave chace to an Indian, who was mounted; him they overtook and killed&mdash;before they returned to the column, a &s;econd one appeared, on which the four field officers left their commands, and pur&s;ued, leaving the troops near half an hour without any directions whatever.&mdash;The cavalry came acro&s;s the &s;econd Indian, and after wounding one of their party, killed him al&s;o.&mdash;When the infantry came up to this place, they immediately fell into confu&s;ion, which he gained permi&s;&s;ion to leave them &s;ome di&s;tance on the road, where he formed an ambu&s;cade.&mdash;After he had been &s;ome time at his &s;tation, a fellow on hor&s;eback came to him, who had lo&s;t the party in pur&s;uit of the fir&s;t Indian; he was much frightened, and &s;aid he had been pur&s;ued by fifty mounted Indians.&mdash;That on his telling this &s;tory to Colonel Trotter, notwith&s;tanding his ob&s;ervations to him, he changed his route, marched in various directions until night, when he returned to camp.&mdash;That on their arrival in camp, General Harmar &s;ent for him; and after an&s;wering him many que&s;tions, ordered one &s;ubaltern and twenty militia to join his com|mand.&mdash;With tho&s;e he cro&s;&s;ed the river St. Jo&s;eph about ten at night, and with a guide proceeded to an Indian town, about two miles di&s;tant; where he conti|nued with his party until morning of the 19th.&mdash;His party fired upon an Indian and retook from him two hor&s;es.&mdash;About nine o'clock he joined the remainder of the detachment under Colonel Hardin.&mdash;They marched on the route Colonel Trotter had pur&s;ued the day before, and after pa&s;&s;ing a mora&s;s about five miles di&s;tant, they came to where the enemy had encamped the day before.&mdash;Here they made a &s;hort halt, and the commanding officer di&s;po&s;ed of the parties at a di&s;tance from each other; after a halt of half an hour, they were ordered to move on, and Captain Faulkner's company was left on the ground; the Colonel having neglected giving him orders to move on. After they had pro|ceeded about three miles, they fell in with two Indians on foot, who threw off their packs, and the bru&s;h being thick, made their e&s;cape.&mdash;He then a&s;ked Colonel Hardin where Captain Faulkner was? He &s;aid he was lo&s;t, and then &s;ent Major Fontaine with part of the cavalry in &s;earch of him, and moved on with the remainder of the troops.&mdash;That &s;ome time after he informed Colonel Hardin, a gun had fired in their front, which might be con&s;idered as an alarm gun, and that he &s;aw where a hor&s;e had come down the road, and returned again; but the Colonel &s;till moved on, giving no orders, nor making any arrangements for an attack.&mdash;That &s;ome time after he di&s;covered the enemy's fires at a di&s;tance, and informed the Colonel, who replied, that they would not fight, and rode in front of the advance, until fired on from behind the fires; when he the Colonel retreated, and with him all the militia except nine, who continued with him, and were in&s;tantly killed, with twenty-four of the federal troops&mdash;that &s;eeing his la&s;t man fall and being &s;urrounded by the &s;avages, he threw him&s;elf into a thicket and remained there three hours in day-light, during that time he had an opportunity of &s;eeing the enemy pa&s;s and repa&s;s and con|ceived their numbers did not amount to one hundred men&mdash;that &s;ome were mounted, others armed with rifles, and the advance with tomahawks only&mdash; he was of opinion that had Colonel Trotter proceeded on the 18th agreeable to his orders, having killed the enemy's &s;entinels, they would have &s;urpri&s;ed their camp and with ea&s;e defeated them, or had Colonel Hardin arranged his troops, or made any military di&s;po&s;ition on the 19th, that they would have gained a victory, their defeat he therefore a&s;cribed to two cau&s;es, the un-officer-like conduct of Colonel Hardin (who he believed was a brave man) and the cowardly behaviour of the militia&mdash;many of them threw down their arms loaded, and he believed that none except the party under his command fired a gun. What he &s;aw of the conduct of the militia on that day, and what he felt by being under the command of a man who wanted military talents, has cau&s;ed him to determine, that he would not willingly fight with the one, or be commanded by the other. That he referred the Court to the orderly-book which pointed out the line of march, encampment and battle.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="023905_0020_0FC7448244B951F0">Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Are you clearly of opinion that if the militia had done their duty, they were fully competent to have defeated the Indians?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think they were fully &s;o.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> According to your ideas, as an officer of expe|rience was the formation and arrangement of the different corps of the army by General Harmar at the commencement of the expedition judicious?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think they were.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Did the line of march appear to you to be a judi|cious one, calculated for the protection of the army in all its parts?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think &s;o.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Do you think the mode of encampment was calcu|lated both for defence and protection?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. As much &s;o as any one that could po&s;&s;ibly be adopted.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> What was your opinion of the General's order of battle?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think it was a judicious one.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Do you think that the making the detachment of the 21&s;t was in its con&s;equences u&s;eful to the return of the army.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I can judge from circum&s;tances only that we were not harra&s;&s;ed by the enemy afterwards.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Do you know if any detachment was made for the purpo&s;e of &s;upporting Major Wyllys?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. As &s;oon as information of the Major's misfortune arrived in camp, the General ordered all the troops under arms, but whether any de|tachment was made from them or not I don't know.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Do you &s;uppo&s;e that if General Harmar had ordered the army back, the militia would have gone?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I am of opinion that if a &s;erious attack had been made, that in fifteen minutes the militia would have de&s;erted us and left the federal troops and artillery to be &s;acrificed.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By General Harmar.</HI> Do you recollect the proceedings of the militia at <HI>Chilicoth&eacute;e</HI> on our return?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I recollect your &s;aying to Colonel Trotter and Major M'Mullen, that you would po&s;t them in their country, for their un-&s;oldier-like conduct and that they ought to be hanged.</P>
<P>En&s;ign <HI>Shamburgh</HI> being &s;worn, depo&s;ed&mdash;That the organization of the army under General Harmar was, as far as he was capable of judging in military affairs, exceedingly well&mdash;That the march, encampment and order of battle were al&s;o in his opinion very well planned&mdash;that he was not capable of judging of the motives, which influenced the detachments of the 14th, 19th and 21&s;t October, but it was his opinion, at that time, that the General was appre|hen&s;ive, that, as the Savages had been &s;ucce&s;sful in the preceding engagements, they would harra&s;s his army on his return, in con&s;equence thereof he ordered the party commanded by Major Wyllys in order to check them, which he be|lieved had its effect&mdash;he recollected that the different detachments &s;ent out were numerous and he believed &s;ufficient to fight &s;uch number of Indians as were then together, if the commanding officers thereof had taken more precaution, he had been told at the time that Major Ray was ordered to &s;upport Major Wyllys, but he could not determine whether that officer had obeyed his orders. He ob&s;erved that the lo&s;s of &s;o many pack-hor&s;es, was owing to the neglect of hor&s;e-ma&s;ters, notwith&s;tanding the repeated orders of the General on that head, it appeared to him as if they were parties concerned, and glad to lo&s;e their hor&s;es, becau&s;e they had a very great apprai&s;ement for the &s;ame. He ob&s;erved that he did duty in the ordnance department at that time, and had fifty pack-hor&s;es under his direction, which gave him an opportunity to know the negligence and incapacity of both hor&s;e-ma&s;ters and drivers.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By General Harmar.</HI> Do you think after the la&s;t detachment was
<PB N="18" REF="023905_0021_0FC298ABF8148D58">
made under Major Wyllys and the remains of his party returned to camp, that the militia would have gone back if they had been ordered?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think not.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Was the appearance of the militia after the action of the 21&s;t orderly or di&s;orderly?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. Very di&s;orderly.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Was there any particular cau&s;e a&s;cribed that you heard of for their di&s;orderly conduct?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. Not that I know of, the militia both officers and men &s;eemed de|termined to go home, and &s;aid frequently that ten federal regiments &s;hould not keep them.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Did you ob&s;erve whether the militia were as well treated as the federal troops?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. Perfectly the &s;ame.</P>
<P>En&s;ign <HI>Gaines</HI> (who was captain of hor&s;e in General Harmar's expedition) being &s;worn, depo&s;ed&mdash;That on the expedition he was almo&s;t every evening at General Harmar's tent until the 24th October, when he was detached for|wards to Fort Wa&s;hington, and that during the whole time he did not &s;ee General Harmar in the lea&s;t intoxicated with liquor, but that on the contrary the General conducted the army in a manner which in his e&s;timation did him great honour. He further ob&s;erved, that he had &s;erved on a number of expe|ditions again&s;t the Savages, undertaken by the militia of Kentuckey, and that he never &s;aw in any of them, the like good order and military arrangement which accompanied General Harmar's expedition&mdash;he al&s;o ob&s;erved that the people in Kentuckey never alledged any charge again&s;t General Harmar, until Colonel John Hardin had acquitted him&s;elf, before a Board of Enquiry of &s;everal charges exhibited again&s;t him, re&s;pecting his conduct on that expedi|tion&mdash;that the populace finding nothing they could &s;ay to the prejudice of the Colonel would be believed, levelled their malice at General Harmar. He did not conceive that any thing would have been &s;aid again&s;t the General in that country, if a Bapti&s;t preacher's &s;on who re&s;ides there had not been whipped in the army for di&s;obedience of orders.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> I think you &s;ay you have been in &s;everal expedi|tions again&s;t the Indians&mdash;did the militia who were with General Harmar con|duct better or wor&s;e, than tho&s;e in other expeditions?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. Much better, Sir.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Was you in the action of the 19th?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I was.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Is it your opinion, that if the militia had been properly arranged in that action, and would have fought, that they would have been &s;ufficient to have defeated the Indians.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. Yes&mdash;for it appeared to me that the Indians were &s;urprized&mdash;that if Colonel Trotter on the preceding day had not returned, he mo&s;t certainly mu&s;t have been in their camp, and completely defeated them; for I had taken two of their &s;pies the day before, which appeared to be the only two they had out.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Do you think that if General Harmar had ordered the army back, after the action of the 21&s;t, that the militia would have gone?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. They would not have gone willingly. I think in that ca&s;e there would have been danger of mutiny. When the militia of Major Wyllys' de|tachment were ordered to march, they appeared to be unwilling to go, and &s;ome were &s;o much &s;o&mdash;as to cry.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Is it your opinion, that the movement of the de|tachment under Major Wyllys, had a good effect in &s;ecuring the army from being attacked and harra&s;&s;ed on its return?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think it had a very good effect.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Did the Indians ever attack you afterwards?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. Not while I continued with the army.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="023905_0022_0FC298B9EBD603F0">Captain <HI>A&s;heton</HI> being &s;worn, depo&s;ed&mdash;That the organization of General Harmar's army was a &s;ource of trouble and difficulty, ari&s;ing from di&s;putes among the militia officers for precedency; but when effected, was in all its parts &s;y&s;tematical.&mdash;That the organization of the army, the order of march, encamp|ment, and battle, when duly con&s;idered, cannot fail to rai&s;e the General in the e&s;timation of every military man.&mdash;That it had been ba&s;ely reported, that the General was in a &s;tate of intoxication nearly the whole of the campaign. This he a&s;&s;erted to be a malicious fal&s;ehood; and he averred, that his per&s;onal conduct, during that time will ever do him honour.&mdash;He &s;aid the motives which influ|enced the detachments of the 14th, 19th and 21&s;t October, could only be accounted for by the General him&s;elf: but he &s;uppo&s;ed, that the detachment un|der Col. Hardin, was &s;ent in con&s;equence of information gained from a pri&s;oner taken on the morning of the 13th, and from a Frenchman employed as a guide, who reported, that it was &s;omething more than half a day's ride from a place called the French Store (at which place the army encamped the night of the 13th) to the Maumee villages.&mdash;This detachment was &s;upported by the whole army, and moved off the ground at the &s;ame time with as much rapidity as po&s;|&s;ible, and arrived at the villages on the 17th, where the army encamped. On the morning of the 18th, I mounted guard in front of the encampment. In the cour&s;e of that day, I was informed that a detachment of 300 men was ordered out under Colonel Trotter, with three days provi&s;ion, with orders to &s;cour the country; but they returned the &s;ame evening to camp, without effecting any thing. Colonel Hardin, di&s;gu&s;ted at the conduct of Colonel Trotter, and anxious to retrieve the lo&s;t honour of his countrymen, &s;olicited the &s;ame com|mand, which was granted. He marched on the morning of the 19th, while he was yet on guard, and was defeated the &s;ame day by the Indians.&mdash;He could not &s;ay what influenced the General to &s;end out a detachment on the 21&s;t, but he ob&s;erved that the Indians were flu&s;hed with &s;ucce&s;s in the action of the 19th. &mdash;That it had become nece&s;&s;ary to give them a &s;udden check, in order to pre|vent the army from being harra&s;&s;ed on its return; and that if this was the General's intention, he was fully per&s;uaded it had it's de&s;ired effect. On the 21&s;t, the army marched eight miles from the Maumee villages on it's return; late that night a corps of 340 militia, and &s;ixty of the federal troops under the command of Major Wyllys, were detached, that they might gain the vicinity of the Maumee villages before morning, and &s;urprize any Indians who might be found there. The detachment marched in three columns, the federal troops in the centre, at the head of which he was po&s;ted, with Major Wyllys and Colonel Hardin in his front&mdash;the militia formed the columns to the right and left. From &s;everal delays, occa&s;ioned by the militia's halting, they did not reach the banks of the <HI>Omee</HI> till &s;ome time after &s;un ri&s;e. The &s;pies then di&s;co|vered the enemy, and reported to Major Wyllys, who halted the federal troops, and moved the militia on &s;ome di&s;tance in front, where he gave his orders and plan of attack to the &s;everal commanding officers of corps&mdash;tho&s;e orders were not communicated to him&mdash;that Major Wyllys re&s;erved the command of the federal troops to him&s;elf. Major Hall with his battalion was directed to take a circuitous route round the bend of the Omee river, cro&s;s the Pickaway Fort (or St. Mary's) which brought him directly in the rear of the enemy, and there wait until the attack &s;hould commence with Major M'Mullen's battalion, Major Fontaine's cavalry, and Major Wyllys with the federal troops, who all cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Omee</HI> at, and near the common fording place. After the attack commenced, the troops were by no means to &s;eparate, but were to embody, or the batta|lions to &s;upport each other as circum&s;tances required. From this di&s;po&s;ition it appeared evident, that it was the intention of Major Wyllys to &s;urround the enemy, and that if Colonel Hall, who had gained his ground undi&s;covered, had not wantonly di&s;obeyed his orders, by firing on a &s;ingle Indian, the &s;ur|prize mu&s;t have been complete. The Indians then fled with precipitation, the battalions of militia pur&s;uing in different directions. Major Fontaine made a
<PB N="20" REF="023905_0023_0FC298BBBA2930D0">
charge upon a &s;mall party of Savages; he fell the fir&s;t fire, and his troops di&s;|per&s;ed. The federal troops who were then left un&s;upported, became an ea&s;y &s;acrifice to much the large&s;t party of Indians that had been &s;een that day. It was his opinion that the misfortunes of that day, were owing to the &s;eparation of the troops, and di&s;obedience of orders. After the federal troops were de|feated, and the firing in all quarters nearly cea&s;ed, Colonel Hall and Major M'Mullen, with their battalions, met in the town, and after di&s;charging, clean|ing and fre&s;h loading their arms, which took up about half an hour, proceeded to join the army unmole&s;ted. He was convinced that the detachment, if it had been kept embodied, was &s;ufficient to have an&s;wered the fulle&s;t expecta|tions of the General, and needed no &s;upport; but that he was informed a battalion under Major Ray, was ordered out for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Is it your opinion, that if the General had ordered the army back, that the militia would have gone?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I do not think they would.</P>
<P>Lieutenant <HI>Ker&s;ey</HI> being &s;worn, depo&s;ed&mdash;That when the militia arrived at Fort Wa&s;hington, they were formed into battalions and properly organized. He knew that General Harmar had a great deal of difficulty to get them ar|ranged; their arms and accoutrements were in very bad order. He wi&s;hed to refer the Court to the General's orderly book for information relative to the order of march. In his opinion General Harmar's conduct was uniform, &s;teady, and &s;ober during the whole expedition. He was al&s;o of opinion, that the detach|ment of the 14th, was in con&s;equence of information received from a pri&s;oner, taken the morning before, which was, that the enemy were running away; and the detachment of the 19th, was to gain &s;ome knowledge of them, and the detachment of the 21&s;t, was to &s;urprize and take advantage of them; which in his opinion would have happened, had the militia attended to the directions and plan laid down for that enterprize. He ob&s;erved that the reduced &s;tate of the pack-hor&s;es, notwith&s;tanding every attention was paid to &s;ecure and keep them in good condition, rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for the army to take any advan|tage of the enemy.&mdash;The militia had proved that they were not to be depended upon; their da&s;tardly behaviour in three in&s;tances, de&s;troyed every confidence the General had in them. He therefore determined to return, and not to hazard another engagement unle&s;s the enemy came in reach of the main body. That the army took up the march to return to Fort Wa&s;hington, and it was with great difficulty that the General kept them together until they arrived there.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> From your knowledge of &s;ervice, is it your opi|nion that the organization of the army was judicious?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think it was.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Do you think that all the movements of the army were &s;o connected, as to be able to &s;u&s;tain each other in ca&s;e of attack by the enemy?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think they were.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Do you think, that through the cour&s;e of the cam|paign, the General's conduct was open and deci&s;ive throughout?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think it was.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Was the conduct of the militia tolerably regular, on their advance towards the Maumee towns?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. It was more regular than it was on the return; but it was very irregular.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> Do you &s;uppo&s;e that it was nece&s;&s;ary to make the detachment of the 21&s;t, in order to prevent the Indians harra&s;&s;ing the army on its return?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think it was, and for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> If the General had ordered the army to return to the towns, after Major Wyllys's misfortune, would the militia have gone?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think they would not&mdash;they would have mutinied.</P>

<P>The Court adjourned to meet at 9 o'clock to-morrow morning.</P>
<P>SEPTEMBER 21&s;t.&mdash;The Court met according to adjournment.</P>
<P>Major <HI>Heart</HI> was &s;worn, and depo&s;ed&mdash;That General Harmar's conduct on his expedition in October 1790, was at all times &s;teady, calm, and deliberate, and was always attentive to the arrangements and applications made to him, and to the informations given, as far as came under his ob&s;ervation&mdash;that he was often at his quarters and marched in front of the right column, which was generally within fifty yards of him&mdash;That the organization of the army being publi&s;hed in the daily orders, would &s;peak for it&s;elf, he however never heard an individual find fault with it, during the campaign, or point out any defects, except in the commi&s;&s;ary and pack-hor&s;e departments, and in tho&s;e the execution, and not the arrangements were found fault with&mdash;that the order of march was in three columns, covered with front, rear and flank guards, which order was generally pre&s;erved, and as well executed, as could be expected with a body compo&s;ed mo&s;tly of militia, and embarra&s;&s;ed with pack-hor&s;es&mdash; that the encampment was in a &s;quare with the baggage, hor&s;es, cattle and &s;tores in center&mdash;guards were po&s;ted in &s;uch manner as to form a line of &s;entries round the whole, field officers appointed to di&s;po&s;e tho&s;e guards, and to &s;ee duty well done, and they were &s;o di&s;po&s;ed as to prevent &s;urprize, and had the hor&s;e department followed orders would have &s;ecured the hor&s;es&mdash;as they had not occa&s;ion to form the line of battle, he could not determine how it would have been executed, but it was &s;imple, ea&s;y to be under&s;tood, and univer&s;ally approved&mdash;With re&s;pect to making the detachments he had never been in council, and could only a&s;&s;ign &s;uch motives as offered them&s;elves at the time from a concurrence of circum&s;tances&mdash;The detachment of the 14th he pre&s;umed at that time was made in con&s;equence of information obtained from a pri&s;oner, that the Indians were confu&s;ed and di&s;tracted in their councils, and was de&s;igned to &s;urprize them, prevent their concerting mea&s;ures to unite, and attack them and not give them time to &s;ecure their provi&s;ions and property, and that the de&s;ired effect was an&s;wered, &s;o far as to prevent their &s;ecuring &s;o much as they would otherways have done&mdash;The whole army was put in motion the moment the detachment moved off, and followed with as much rapidity as artillery and &s;tores would admit of, to &s;upport the detachment&mdash;That the detachment of the 19th was made in con&s;equence of repeated information of having di&s;covered a trail of men, women, and children, and on the fulle&s;t a&s;&s;urance as he was then informed, that the detachment was adequate for attacking the party they were in que&s;t of, a corps de re&s;erve was ordered but never came up, it was dark before information was brought to the General that the party were defeated, and a &s;upport could not be &s;ent that night&mdash;a detachment was ordered to march next morning, but for what purpo&s;e, he could not &s;ay.&mdash;The detachment of the 21&s;t he had every rea&s;on to believe was made on the general &s;y&s;tem, viz. to find the enemy, and give them a check, to prevent their attacking and harra&s;&s;ing the army, on the retreat, and on that principle the detaching was inevitable&mdash;he did not know that any &s;upport was ordered, he was on the left, but he knew that the greater part of the detach|ment came in very &s;oon after the intelligence of the defeat was brought, and it was too late for giving any a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He did not expect that the General would make a detachment to &s;upport them, after the repeated proofs that the militia would not &s;tand, and he pre&s;umed the &s;ituation of the hor&s;es would not admit of returning with the army. He &s;uppo&s;ed the detachment calculated to cover it&s;elf, and doubtle&s;s would have happily &s;ucceeded, had the right and left columns obeyed the orders which it is &s;aid, Major Wyllys had given. He knew of no one circum&s;tance in the General's conduct during the expedition
<PB N="22" REF="023905_0025_0FC7448C628088E8">
which ought to injure his reputation, and tho' the misfortunes of the 21&s;t were to be lamented, yet he believed the &s;alvation of the remainder of the army, the baggage and &s;tores, were due only to the making that detachment.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>By the Court.</HI> On the arrival of the troops in camp who were defeated on the 21&s;t, do you think from the &s;tate of mind the militia were in, that if the General had ordered the army back the militia would have gone?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I do not know whether they would or not, but if they had gone, and not having any place to retreat to, I am of opinion they would have fled as &s;oon as they were attacked and have left the federal troops to be &s;acrificed.</P>
<P>The Court then adjourned to to-morrow morning nine o'clock.</P>
<P>SEPTEMBER 22d.&mdash;The Court having met according to adjournment directed the Recorder to write the following letter to his Excellency General St. Clair.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER IV. The AFFIDAVIT of Colonel JOHN HARDIN, taken in con&s;equence of a Court of Enquiry to be held at Fort Wa&s;hington, re&s;pecting the conduct of Brigadier General Harmar, on the expedition again&s;t the Maumee Towns, in October 1790.</HEAD>
<P>THIS deponent being fir&s;t &s;worn, depo&s;eth and faith,&mdash;That on his arrival with the Kentuckey militia at the mouth of Licking, he commenced an acquaintance with General Harmar, found from his conver&s;ation that he had the good of his country and the expedition very much at heart; bu&s;ine&s;s was carried on regular and with as much expedition as the nature of the ca&s;e would admit. About the fir&s;t of October we proceeded on our march: after the line of march was formed the General i&s;&s;ued his orders regularly, and ob&s;erved very &s;trictly that they were executed; on our march there was an Indian pri&s;oner taken, who gave information, that the Indians and French were repairing the old fort at the Maumee town, and that the Indians were not likely to get any of the neighbouring tribes to join them; this pri&s;oner al&s;o in|formed us they did not know that General Harmar had any artillery: After receiving this information the General and this Deponent con&s;ulted upon the matter, and it was agreed to detach &s;ix hundred men, leaving all their heavy baggage and march rapidly to the towns, hoping that the enemy would fly to their fort provided the artillery was not di&s;covered, and that &s;ix hundred rank and file would be &s;ufficient to keep them in their fort until General Harmar arrived with the artillery and balance of the army. Accordingly when the General was informed by the guides, that they were within thirty or thirty-five miles of the towns, there was a detachment ordered to make ready with all po&s;&s;ible expedition; tho&s;e orders were &s;o plea&s;ing to the officers that they di&s;|puted who &s;hould go, and &s;ome ca&s;t lots in order to &s;ettle the di&s;pute; this deponent being honoured with the command, left the General with his detach|ment, and &s;aw him no more until he arrived at the Maumee village, which he thinks was about three or four days after he left him, during which time he heard no complaints of General Harmar. After the General's arrival at the Maumee village and the Indians all fled, he expre&s;&s;ed a very great de&s;ire to make
<PB N="29" REF="023905_0032_0FC298DFB837D880">
his route by the Weaw towns on the Waba&s;h; for this purpo&s;e there was a council ordered to be held, but before the council met, finding the Indians had &s;tole the night before a number of the pack-hor&s;es and &s;ome of the light-hor&s;emen's hor&s;es, there was a &s;top put to the bu&s;ine&s;s, and the thoughts of the route by the Weaw towns laid a&s;ide. There was an old French captive that was taken informed us the Indians were &s;cattered in the woods, and were not able by any means to fight us, and that they had not got any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from other tribes; this induced this deponent to &s;olicit the General for a command of about three or four hundred men, to range the woods for ten or twelve miles, which he granted, and ordered the three hundred men to be furni&s;hed with three days provi&s;ions, the&s;e orders were as plea&s;ing to the officers and &s;oldiers as the former; Colonel Trotter in&s;i&s;ted he had been promi&s;ed a com|mand, and as it appeared this would be productive of &s;omething very clever, he wi&s;hed to be indulged with the command of the detachment then ordered out, which was granted by the General, this deponent con&s;enting thereto; Colo|nel Trotter marched on the morning of the 18th of October, equipt for a tour of two or three days, in order to hunt up Indian camps; he returned on the evening of the &s;ame day, at the time the General and the deponent was about fixing of guards in order to captivate any of the enemy that might come to &s;teal hor&s;es: the General appeared much di&s;plea&s;ed with the conduct of Colonel Trotter and ordered the &s;ame party out again that evening, and for this deponent to go next morning and take charge of them; this deponent agreeable to the orders given, collected what he could of the party next morning, and after proceeding about ten miles fell in with a party of Indians, who began a very bri&s;k fire on the detachment, who retired without making but very little re&s;i&s;tance, notwith&s;tanding all the exertions to prevent them:&mdash;this deponent when he returned to camp informed the General what had happened, that it was owing to the cowardly behaviour of the militia, and in&s;i&s;ted on another party's being &s;ent to the battle ground; the General informed this deponent he would let him know in the morning. Accordingly he told him that he had not compleated the object that he was ordered to do, and that if any thing &s;hould happen to prevent him, he &s;hould be reflected on, as he had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the towns &s;o long and had not de&s;troyed them, that he would fir&s;t give orders for that purpo&s;e, and then he would be better able to judge what was be&s;t to be done; on the morning of the 20th orders were given for de&s;troying of the towns, which was executed accordingly; at this time the men appeared more timid than before; the General told this depo|nent he thought it would not an&s;wer a good purpo&s;e to go to the battle ground, as the mens &s;pirits appeared to be very low at the hear&s;ay of &s;o many men being killed, and that the &s;ight of the mangled bodies would make them much more &s;o, and the Indians if not able to fight us would be gone, and that he &s;hould give orders to take up the line of march to Fort Wa&s;hington: accordingly on the morning of the 21&s;t we left the towns and began our march for the mouth of Licking, in about eight or nine miles encamped. The night being very clear and the moon giving light, this deponent informed the General that he thought it would be a good opportunity to &s;teal a march on the Indians, as he had rea&s;on to believe they returned to the towns as &s;oon as they knew the army had left it. The General did not appear fond of &s;ending a party back, but this deponent urged the matter informing the General that as he had been unfortunate the other day he wi&s;hed to have it in his power to pick the militia and try it again, and at the &s;ame time endeavoured to account for the mens not fighting, and de&s;ired an opportunity to retrieve the credit of the militia; the General appeared not to be of opinion the enemy would return &s;o &s;oon, but told this deponent he might take about one hundred men and go back; this deponent replied he did not wi&s;h to go back with le&s;s than five or &s;ix hundred men; the General an&s;wered that the troops were very much fatigued, and that it would not an&s;wer any valuable purpo&s;e to &s;end &s;o many men; this deponent
<PB N="30" REF="023905_0033_0FC298E136C30EE8">
then left the General; in about half an hour he was &s;ent for, when the General informed him that he intended to &s;end Major Wyllys back with all the federal troops that could be &s;pared, &s;aying at the &s;ame time they were the men that would &s;tand to the work, and that he wanted about one hundred of your be&s;t militia; after &s;ome conver&s;ation between the General and this deponent, the latter went to Major Wyllys and told him he did not like his going back with &s;o few men, the Major al&s;o thinking the number too few, wi&s;hed this deponent to &s;peak to the General on the &s;ubject, which was done; Major M'Mullen and Major Hall were then &s;ent for and the de&s;ign made known to them, they both appeared well plea&s;ed with the affair; it was then propo&s;ed what number of men would be &s;ufficient, this deponent recommending from four to &s;ix hundred, they both concluded that four hundred men was fully &s;ufficient; the General &s;eemed perfectly &s;atisfied that any number of troops that were thought adequate to the purpo&s;e &s;hould be ordered; accordingly four hundred men con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ixty regulars, three hundred foot militia and forty hor&s;emen rank and file properly officered were ordered to be ready to march at midnight; this deponent was honored with the command of the militia. The troops marched agreeable to orders about two o'clock, and after proceeding to the towns they fell in with a party of Indians, a battle en&s;ued (the re&s;ult of which is generally known) as they returned, about one and a half miles before we got to camp, this deponent &s;ent a hor&s;eman forward to inform the General what was done, and very &s;hortly after he had di&s;patched this hor&s;eman, met Major Ray with about thirty men, who inform'd him there had come a hor&s;eman into camp, and had acquainted the General that the party was nearly all cut off, that the General had &s;ent him with what men he could get out of the militia to meet what had e&s;caped of the detachment, that tho&s;e with him was all that would turn out; this deponent informed the Major otherwi&s;e and reque&s;ted him to wait until Major M'Mullen, Major Hall, and Major Orm&s;by &s;hould come up, that they were but a &s;mall di&s;tance behind and he would go forward to the General. When this deponent arrived at camp and informed the General what was done he appeared to be well &s;atisfied; he al&s;o a&s;ked the General if he would not &s;end back another party to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the battle ground, he replied he would not divide his army any more, when this deponent in&s;i&s;ted on the whole army's marching back (no per&s;on being pre&s;ent except the General, Major Doughty and this deponent) the General an&s;wered, you &s;ee the &s;ituation of the army, we are now &s;carcely able to move our baggage, it will take up three days to go and return to this place, we have no more forage for our hor&s;es, and if the Indians intend to collect, which he apprehended they would from their &s;ucce&s;s on the 19th, it would give them a great oppor|tunity; that they had got a very good &s;courging, and he would keep the army in perfect readine&s;s to receive them &s;hould they think proper to follow, and finally concluded that under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, it was be&s;t to move forward to Fort Wa&s;hington, and if the Indians did follow he would make every exertion in his power to defeat their intentions; Major Doughty appeared perfectly to agree with the General in opinion. The bounds of the camp were made le&s;s; the army continued at the &s;ame camp until next morning, orders were given to march at the u&s;ual hour which was eight o'clock, during this time this deponent never heard any per&s;on expre&s;s a de&s;ire to go back to the towns, except two &s;oldiers of Major Ray's party by the names of Miller and Hammond. Next morning at the hour appointed to march the General moved with the front of the army and halted at a very &s;mall di&s;tance, litters not being ready for all the wounded; this deponent with the rear-guard and many others did not leave the camp until ten o'clock, when they moved on and joined the army, the whole then proceeded on towards Fort Wa&s;hington, with as much regularity as was ob&s;erved in going out, until we came to the old Chilacothy on little Miami, when a number of the militia contrary to orders fired off their guns, this deponent endeavoured to put a &s;top to &s;uch di&s;orderly behaviour,
<PB N="31" REF="023905_0034_0FC744B42EDC5A68">
and commanded that tho&s;e offenders that could be taken &s;hould be puni&s;hed agreeable to general orders, and having caught a &s;oldier him&s;elf in the very act of firing his gun, ordered a file of men to take him immediately and carry him to the &s;ix pounder, and for the drummer to tye him up and give him &s;ix la&s;hes; this deponent was &s;hortly after met by Colonel Trotter and Major M'Mullen, and a number of militia &s;oldiers, who in an abrupt manner a&s;ked him by what authority he ordered that &s;oldier whipt, he replied in &s;upport of general orders; on which a very warm di&s;pute en&s;ued between Colonel Trotter, Major M'Mullen and this deponent; the General being informed of what had happened came forward and gave Colonel Trotter and Major M'Mullen a very &s;evere reprimand, ordered the federal troops to parade, and the drummer to do his duty, &s;wearing he would ri&s;que his life in &s;upport of his orders, the man received the number of la&s;hes ordered, and &s;everal that were confined were &s;et at liberty; numbers of the militia &s;eem'd much plea&s;ed with what was done; this intended mutiny being &s;oon qua&s;h'd the army proceeded in good order to Fort Wa&s;hington. When the army arrived at the mouth of Licking the General informed this deponent he had determined to arre&s;t &s;ome of the militia officers, for their bad conduct and &s;end them home with di&s;grace; but this deponent oppo&s;ed his intention, alledging that it would be a di&s;grace to the whole militia, that he would perhaps &s;tand in need of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance on &s;ome future occa&s;ion, and it would four their minds and cau&s;e them to turn out with reluctance, and that his di&s;charging them generally with honor perhaps would an&s;wer a better purpo&s;e, the General readily indulged the reque&s;t of this deponent. This deponent further ob&s;erves, that during the expedition he never heard officer nor &s;oldier find fault or give the mo&s;t di&s;tant hint of being di&s;|plea&s;ed with the General's conduct in any re&s;pect, nor charge him with cowardice or drunkenne&s;s, and expected the General had given general &s;atis|faction, and what more confirm'd his opinion, was after their arrival at Fort Wa&s;hington the General invited all the field and &s;ome other officers to dine with him, among&s;t whom was Colonel Trotter, Major Doughty, Major Hall, and Major M'Mullen; dinner being over wine was introduced, the General &s;tepping out on &s;ome occa&s;ion Major Hall propo&s;ed drinking his health, it was unanimou&s;ly agreed to, and with as much cheerfulne&s;s as any other health that was propo&s;ed; this deponent continued at Fort Wa&s;hington a few days after, and never heard any per&s;on &s;peak a di&s;re&s;pectful word of General Harmar, or find fault in the lea&s;t with his conduct whil&s;t on the expedition. When this deponent returned home in Kentuckey, hearing &s;uch reports re&s;pecting the expedition was much amazed, but concluded it aro&s;e from a want of knowledge and proper information or from prejudice. This deponent further &s;aith, that be looked on General Harmar to be a very brave and experienced officer. And further &s;aith not.</P>
