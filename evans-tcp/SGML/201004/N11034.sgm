<Q><L>If &s;ad Britannia wails, in deep di&s;tre&s;s,</L>
<L>Her taxes greater and her freedom le&s;s:</L>

<L>TO you my lord, the&s;e hone&s;t lines I &s;end;</L>
<L>To you the &s;ov'reign's not the people's friend</L>
<L>The &s;ov'reign's friend? yes, when I think again,</L>
<L>A friend like Wol&s;ey in a Harry's reign.</L>
<L>Harry, who gave his royal lu&s;ts full &s;cope;</L>
<L>Commenc'd a devil and renounc'd the pope.</L>
<L>In Bute and North two devils make us groan,</L>
<L>And at Quebec the pope re&s;umes his throne.</L>
<L>Harry's de&s;potic frowns o'er ca&s;t us now;</L>
<L>Fate hangs on Bute's proud will and George's brow.</L>
<L>Below, North repre&s;ents ab&s;conding Bute,</L>
<L>Above, a Nation dyes by Roy le veut.</L>
<L>Proud of North's name corruption wears no veil;</L>
<L>At North's &s;oft bribe, no &s;enator turns pale.</L>
<L>Shrew'd Walpole never went your lord&s;hip's length;</L>
<L>But boldne&s;s with &s;upplies has gather'd &s;trength.</L>

Safe from impeachments in this venal time,</L>
<L>Each parricide may triumph in his crime.</L>
<L>Knaves in your lord&s;hip's numbers put their hope;</L>
<L>Lords fear no ax, and commoners no rope,</L>
<L>Virtue's fair dawn you've clouded with a &s;um;</L>
<L>And check'd her te&s;t for &s;even years to come.</L>
<L>A&s;&s;ociation is a dreadful &s;ound;</L>
<L>And Bute mu&s;t dye if virtue is not bound.</L>
<L>Shou'd te&s;ts en&s;ue; impeachments wou'd take place,</L>
<L>And old St. Stephen wear an hone&s;t face.</L>
<L>What mu&s;t be done?&mdash;"di&s;&s;olve, cries Bute in fits:</L>
<L>"Di&s;&s;olve&mdash;and &s;tab your country with new writs."</L>
<L>He &s;poke, and North obedient to his voice,</L>
<L>With gold prepar'd his boroughs for their choice.</L>
<L>Appriz'd his members of the dex'trous cheat,</L>
<L>And plac'd corruption in her former &s;eat.</L>
<L>Crouching &s;he licks the hand by which &s;he's fed,</L>
<L>And joys to &s;ee Sir Fletcher at her head;</L>
<L>To &s;ee North ape Bute's dictatorial nod,</L>
<L>For George de&s;erts his country and his God.</L>
<L>To &s;ee her &s;ons alert when North commands,</L>
<L>And at his beck lift up four hundred hands.</L>
<L>But whence this mighty influence? whence this pow'r?</L>
<L>All virtue's delug'd in a golden &s;how'r.</L>
<L>A treas'ry &s;torm what virtue can re&s;i&s;t?</L>
<L>Ev'n George to drown her, dips his civil li&s;t.</L>
<L>With thir&s;t hydropic all North's patriots drink,</L>
<L>And half a million &s;carce will make 'em &s;ink.</L>
<L>From craving more no decency re&s;trains,</L>
<L>At once they poi&s;on and exhau&s;t our veins.</L>
<L>Let tho&s;e, who feel the civil li&s;t decrea&s;e,</L>
<L>Call on Mount&s;tewart to re&s;tore his fleece.</L>
<L>Father and &s;on are equally a cur&s;e:</L>
<L>One dupes the &s;ov'reign, and one drains the pur&s;e.</L>

In baubles and douceurs what trea&s;ures fly?</L>
<L>How are the people plunder'd to &s;upply!</L>
<L>Elegance lavi&s;h'd on a Scot is vain,</L>
<L>A hovel might content an embryo thane.</L>
<L>His ance&s;tors (this truth is wormwood now,)</L>
<L>Who&s;e hut contain'd their wife, their bairns, &amp; cow,</L>
<L>Thought e'er their union taught their pride to feel,</L>
<L><HI>A Pounde in Siller was a muckle deale.</HI></L>
<L>But &s;ince Scots felt the ble&s;&s;ings of that law,</L>
<L>Which laid their Thanes on down in&s;tead of &s;traw,</L>
<L>Ble&s;s'd them with commerce, arts, and all their fruits,</L>
<L>And bade them herd no longer with their brutes;</L>
<L>By culture humaniz'd their &s;avage mind,</L>
<L>And plac'd them on a footing with mankind;</L>
<L>Their haughty &s;ons who el&s;e had fed on gra&s;s,</L>
<L>Or filch'd for hunger, thi&s;tles from their a&s;s,</L>
<L>Shiv'ring on mountains de&s;olate and cold,</L>
<L>Strangers alike to luxury and gold.</L>
<L>Forgetting, like their &s;ires, want's bitter &s;ting,</L>
<L>Di&s;dain the palace of an Engli&s;h King;</L>
<L>Demand &s;uperb additions, va&s;t expence,</L>
<L>To fit it for a lordlings re&s;idence.</L>
<L>O! &s;hame! where art thou fled!&mdash;ye Briton ri&s;e?</L>
<L>Is it for Bute's proud race you grant &s;upplies?</L>
<L>With ju&s;t re&s;entment bid Mount&s;tewart fly,</L>
<L>And feed his pride beneath his father's &s;ky;</L>
<L>There pinch on rocks where barren nature &s;leeps;</L>
<L>Yes&mdash;&s;courge him back to his paternal nieps.</L>
<L>Weak &s;ov'reigns, thus their artful minions ble&s;s;</L>
<L>A&s;k what they dare their con&s;tant an&s;wer's yes.</L>
<L>When injur'd &s;ubjects with petitions go,</L>
<L>The &s;ov'reign, low'ring, looks an haughty no.</L>
<L><PB N="152" REF="013984_0004_0F92599BBAC16D78">
Yet if his king&s;hip wants a fre&s;h &s;upply,</L>
<L>Below&mdash;aye, aye,&mdash;above, contents the cry.</L>
<L>Petitioners with rebels are involv'd;</L>
<L>Let Bute but hint&mdash;the parliament's di&s;&s;olv'd.</L>
<L>This influence Beckford labour'd to re&s;i&s;t;</L>
<L>Corruption, was maintain'd, and he di&s;mi&s;s'd.</L>
<L>Cities petition, yet their plague endures;</L>
<L>But virtue's rage quick di&s;&s;olution cures.</L>
<L>Say (for you know, my lord) the cau&s;e of this,</L>
<L>You know who coun&s;els and who acts ami&s;s.</L>
<L>Di&s;gui&s;e no truth by &s;pecious, trite harangue;</L>
<L>But &s;ay, at once your parliament's a gang.</L>
<L>If truth's a crime, and George's frown you dread,</L>
<L>Say in a whi&s;per who is at their head?</L>
<L>That que&s;tion's home&mdash;your lord&s;hip's filent &s;till&mdash;</L>
<L>I'll an&s;wer it my&s;elf then&mdash;frown who will.</L>
<L>In ancient days when &s;imple monarchs &s;aw</L>
<L>No better means by reigning than by law,</L>
<L>When &s;ages coun&s;ell'd with an hone&s;t heart.</L>
<L>And kings religiou&s;ly perform'd their part;</L>
<L>E'er &s;tanding armies were a &s;tanding cur&s;e,</L>
<L>Subjects were children, and their king a nur&s;e;</L>
<L>No &s;uitor unredre&s;s'd then left the throne;</L>
<L>The nur&s;e's intere&s;t and the child's were one.</L>
<L>The three e&s;tates then us'd to coale&s;ce,</L>
<L>With no intention but to &s;ave and ble&s;s.</L>
<L>Now kings, lords, and commons faithfully agree,</L>
<L>Like a banditti in confed'racy.</L>
<L>Combin'd to plunge a nation in di&s;tre&s;s,</L>
<L>To double grievances without redre&s;s.</L>
<L>In vain to George the &s;uppliant knee is bent;</L>
<L>He enjoins &s;ilence, &s;uff'ring and content.</L>
<L>With &s;ullen gloom he arms his &s;ulky brow,</L>
<L>And tells us &s;lav'ry is our charter now,</L>
<L><PB N="153" REF="013984_0005_0F92599C5528D308">
A&s;toni&s;h'd at his city's daring cries,</L>
<L>He tells 'em kings and parliaments are wi&s;e.</L>
<L>Tells 'em their con&s;titution is controul;</L>
<L>That of all trades oppre&s;&s;ion is the &s;oul;</L>
<L>That their protection hangs on royal breath;</L>
<L>To day 'tis &s;lav'ry and to-morrow death.</L>
<L>That all are rebels, but that pa&s;&s;ive tribe,</L>
<L>Who ki&s;s his chains, his foot&s;tool and his bribe.</L>
<L>That ev'ry &s;ubject's traiterous in his view,</L>
<L>Who dares petition, meet, con&s;ult or &s;ue.</L>
<L>The&s;e &s;entiments are Bute's by Mansfield penn'd;</L>
<L>Mansfield who tells us he is virtue's friend.</L>
<L>This doctrine good my lord, full &s;cope affords,</L>
<L>To your vile commons and your &s;upple lords.</L>
<L>Since ev'ry act brings forth &s;ome grievance new,</L>
<L>Enlarge the narrow bounds of trea&s;on too.</L>
<L>Like Mary' Minion in her tyrant reign,</L>
<L>Enlarge old Edward's act amend, explain,</L>
<L>Shew Edward's &s;ages they mi&s;took the ca&s;e;</L>
<L>Declare new trea&s;ons&mdash;'tis an act of grace.</L>
<L>Declare it trea&s;on but to wi&s;h &s;ucce&s;s</L>
<L>To freedom's arms, or &s;upplicate redre&s;s;</L>
<L>Work your new doctor's in&s;ult into fact;</L>
<L>'Tis John&s;on's thought, &s;o call it John&s;on's act.</L>
<L>Go farther &s;till, and &s;top the teeming pre&s;s;</L>
<L>If wi&s;hing's trea&s;on, writing is no le&s;s.</L>
<L>Safe in your votes, corruption now invites:</L>
<L>This is your time&mdash;lop off the hand that writes.</L>
<L>By libels full of truth, your Mansfield bleeds,</L>
<L>And Bute &s;till dreads impeachment's &s;welling &s;eeds.</L>
<L>Pre&s;erve your &s;ov'reign in tyrannic health;</L>
<L>Nor let him read the CRISIS but by &s;tealth.</L>
<L>No quarter to that whiggi&s;h Cri&s;is give;</L>
<L>Aut let the Tory patriot's fal&s;ehoods live.</L>
<L><PB N="154" REF="013984_0006_0F92599D4916D3F8">
Let John&s;on's &s;heets attrack the monarch's eye;</L>
<L>There he may &s;ee how knaves well paid can lye.</L>
<L>In John&s;on's tenets let him read his own,</L>
<L>That kings are born to laugh whil&s;t &s;ubjects groan;</L>
<L>That pow'r is their's in &s;upplication's &s;pite;</L>
<L>Whatever they and heav'n inflict, is right.</L>
<L>When kings for wanton &s;laughter give the word,</L>
<L>Subjects are bound to fall upon their &s;word.</L>
<L>When kings by famine choo&s;e their &s;laves &s;hou'd die;</L>
<L>Tho&s;e &s;laves mu&s;t drop without an a&s;king eye.</L>
<L>So much for life&mdash;to claim our own is vain:</L>
<L>Like Monte&s;quieu they fancy who complain.</L>
<L>What has a &s;lave? nor fire, nor cloaths, nor meat;</L>
<L>Not for them&s;elves they're warm'd, or cloath'd, or eat;</L>
<L>But to de&s;end their ma&s;ter in his pride;</L>
<L>Their &s;ov'reign; who may tax their very hide.</L>
<L>Flay off their &s;kin in wantonne&s;s and &s;port,</L>
<L>Or &s;end an order for their heads from court.</L>
<L>Shou'd freedom's odious form pre&s;ume to ri&s;e,</L>
<L>North makes a motion, and the phantom flies.</L>
<L>Mansfield and Bute the murd'rous bill invent.</L>
<L>North brings it in&mdash;'tis pa&s;s'd&mdash;and gains a&s;&s;ent.</L>
<L>No tax, no pain, no penalty's too much;</L>
<L>All are thrice hallow'd by the &s;cepter's touch.</L>
<L>Thus by no tyranny the &s;lave's oppre&s;s'd;</L>
<L>The means are &s;acred, and the end is ble&s;s'd.</L>
<L>He's the be&s;t &s;ubject who mo&s;t pro&s;trate lies,</L>
<L>He's the true patriot who &s;ubmits and dies.</L>
<L>Thus John&s;on writes: at court his works have prai&s;e;</L>
<L>No re&s;olution whims in George's days!</L>
<L>Thus frantic &s;avages pre&s;ent their brea&s;t,</L>
<L>To pointed lightnings, with fal&s;e zeal po&s;&s;e&s;s'd;</L>
<L><PB N="155" REF="013984_0007_0F92599DD05CE760">
Behold th' enthu&s;ia&s;ts all Jove's rage invoke;</L>
<L>And he's the happie&s;t who receives the &s;troke.</L>
<L>O mighty king! wi&s;e council! righteous throne!</L>
<L>Where freedom, property, nor life's our own.</L>
<L>Briton's adore this &s;un, that gilds your days,</L>
<L>Surround St. James's with new &s;ongs of prai&s;e.</L>
<L>Let Wilkes no more, like Beckford's gho&s;t, ari&s;e,</L>
<L>And with petitions fear his &s;ov'reign's eyes,</L>

<L>O glorious martydom! henceforth appear,</L>

<L>Ble&s;t be tho&s;e &s;hades! who taught our kings to dread,</L>
<L>No lo&s;s of honour like a lo&s;s of head!</L>
<L>'Tis that alone, my lord, that can re&s;train</L>
<L>Kings and their minions in a tyrant reign.</L>
<L>The good or ill their mini&s;ters may do,</L>
<L>Ari&s;es always from the point in view.</L>
<L>Their darling aim gives life to their de&s;igns;</L>
<L>Now vacates patents, and now watches mines.</L>
<L>To day &s;upplants a Bentick in his right,</L>
<L>And backs mean Lowther in a legal fight;</L>
<L>The board of cu&s;toms by direction meet</L>
<L>To-morrow, and pronounce Sir James a cheat.</L>
<L><PB N="156" REF="013984_0008_0F92599F08E61768">
For why? of late Sir James too re&s;tive draws;</L>
<L>To &s;courge him North pretends a public cau&s;e.</L>
<L>Now for Sir James, in patents picking holes,</L>
<L>And now again&s;t him for his frauds in coals.</L>
<L>Thus we di&s;cern the ju&s;tice of the &s;tate;</L>
<L>That kings and mini&s;ters breathe life or fate:</L>
<L>Petitions as rebellious are with&s;tood,</L>
<L>Whil&s;t &s;pleen is gratify'd for public good.</L>
<L>Beware the goal, my lord, nor drive too high;</L>
<L>Kings dare be tyrants, but they dur&s;t not die.</L>
<L>'Tis a nice conduct that can &s;teer between</L>
<L>King's lu&s;ts, mens rights, and ills that intervene.</L>
<L>When godlike kings (like Alfred) give a&s;&s;ent</L>
<L>To all that can relieve, a&s;&s;i&s;t, content;</L>
<L>When ju&s;tice by the royal touch gains force,</L>
<L>And virtue is &s;upported in her cour&s;e;</L>
<L>When regal power is for a ble&s;&s;ing us'd,</L>
<L>And mercy like the beams of heaven diffus'd;</L>
<L>Then righteou&s;ne&s;s and truth &s;urround the throne,</L>
<L>Then kings are mini&s;ters that heav'n may own.</L>
<L>By day their pre&s;ence gives all hearts delight,</L>
<L>And ev'ry &s;ubject is their guard by night.</L>
<L>But when inflate with pride they ape the god;</L>
<L>Affect to damp addre&s;&s;es with a nod;</L>
<L>Check and o'er bear the humble &s;uitor's claim,</L>
<L>And give to liberty, vile trea&s;on's name:</L>
<L>When in their face and words the tyrant's reigns,</L>
<L>And free born &s;ubjects mu&s;t receive their chains;</L>
<L>When you, my lord, behold this daring &s;cene,</L>
<L>With caution &s;teer your little bark between</L>
<L>The &s;ov'reign's and the &s;ubject's &s;ide;</L>
<L>On a rough &s;ea behold each ve&s;&s;el ride,</L>
<L>This mann'd by freedom, that by tyrant pride.</L>
