<HEAD>AN ENQUIRY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN I reflect on the reciprocal benefits of civil &s;ociety, I con&s;ider my&s;elf as one of a &s;hip's com|pany, who are embarked together, and have to &s;truggle with the difficulties and dangers of a boi&s;terous element, where individual &s;afety is ab&s;orbed in that of the whole, and each one, by contributing to the &s;ecurity of the whole, is &s;erving him&s;elf; and tho' all cannot have the com|mand of the helm, yet, being &s;o nearly intere&s;ted, every one has a right to keep a look-out, and, if he appre|hends danger, give the alarm, which to neglect might be a criminal omi&s;&s;ion; and &s;hould his fears appear not equally important to others, his motive being good, ought to &s;ecure him from cen&s;ure. This may apologize for my &s;olicitude for the common &s;afety, when I behold the &s;upinene&s;s and inattention of tho&s;e appointed to the watch.</P>
<P>Phy&s;icians, in judging of the health of a human body, examine &s;ymptoms, &s;ome they deem mortal, others dan|gerous, &amp;c. If we take the &s;ame method to judge of the vigor and health of government, I know of no &s;ymptom more ju&s;tly alarming, than a general &s;light and di&s;regard to good and whole&s;ome laws. That this is too much the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent in New-Jer&s;ey admits of no di&s;pute. Laws calculated to guard the manners and morals of the people; to check vice, and encourage and promote indu&s;try and frugality, the &s;tronge&s;t &s;inews of independence, and true&s;t riches of a &s;tate or nation; when &s;uch laws are treated as objects of trivial moment, and not worthy the &s;erious notice of the Executive au|thority, it certainly denotes a great depravity of man|ners. To &s;hew that this is really our pre&s;ent &s;ituation is the intention of the en&s;uing pages, wherein I &s;hall make
<PB N="4" REF="018458_0004_0FA76E2EAB6FE750">extracts from &s;ome of our laws, with remarks thereon, for the in&s;pection of &s;uch of my fellow-citizens who may not &s;o fully have con&s;idered the power which every ho|ne&s;t man has of lending a hand to &s;uppre&s;s vice. In doing of this, if any thing I &s;ay &s;hould appear har&s;h or &s;evere, I may declare once for all, that I de&s;ire to give no ju&s;t offence to any, my motive is upright and di&s;in|tere&s;ted, at which virtue and worth can never be offend|ed; and as for tho&s;e of a contrary ca&s;t, their obloquy is prai&s;e.

<P>There are two laws in this &s;tate for the regulating of taverns, &amp;c. The fir&s;t was pa&s;&s;ed in 1738, the other in 1768. The preamble to one &s;ays, <HI>The vices &s;o much practi&s;ed in them were to the great &s;candal of religion, the di&s;honor of</HI> GOD, <HI>and impoveri&s;hing of the commonwealth.</HI> That to the other gives the rea&s;on for pa&s;&s;ing it, i. e. <HI>More effectually to prevent taverns from being perverted to places of gaming, tippling, drunkenne&s;s, revelling, extortion, and other vices.</HI> Here we di&s;cover the &s;en&s;e the Legi&s;la|ture had of the conduct common in taverns when the&s;e laws were pa&s;&s;ed, and the nece&s;&s;ity they &s;aw of providing a remedy. In doing of this, they give the Ju&s;tices in their &s;e&s;&s;ions as full and ample a power as words can well expre&s;s&mdash;Licences mu&s;t be renewed every year, and are in the di&s;cretion of the Ju&s;tices either to grant or refu&s;e, with this re&s;triction, that they &s;hall not grant a licence to any per&s;on but what comes to them well recommend|ed, as being of good repute for hone&s;ty and temperance. Neverthele&s;s it is a con&s;tant complaint throughout the &s;tate, that hardly any one ever applies, however bad their character, but they obtain a licence. It may be &s;aid, they come recommended, and that is the guide to the
<PB N="5" REF="018458_0005_0FA76E3072793808">Court. Will that excu&s;e for &s;inning again&s;t knowledge? But the truth is, hardly any good law was ever &s;o trifled with, or tortured, to evade the true intent and meaning of it, as this. It requires a recommendation, &s;igned by at lea&s;t &s;ix freeholders of the neighbourhood where the ta|vern is to be kept; in&s;tead of this, tavernkeepers will &s;ign each others recommendation, be each others &s;ecurity, &amp;c. and &s;uch who cannot get a reputable neighbour to &s;ign, will pick up any they can, and &s;ometimes from the remote&s;t parts of the county. Thus is the &s;ecurity the law provides again&s;t per&s;ons of bad fame rendered a mere farce and mockery, and this in open Court, in the face of the county, thereby teaching the common people to evade and trifle with the &s;olemnity of laws, in&s;tead of en|deavouring on all occa&s;ions to inculcate a reverence for, and religious obedience to them. To enable my readers to judge for them&s;elves, here follows extracts from tho&s;e laws, whereby they may compare the pre&s;ent mode of executing them with their true intent and meaning, and then &s;eriou&s;ly reflect where &s;uch a perver&s;ion of law mu&s;t lead.</P>

<P>In making the foregoing extracts, I have not copied whole &s;ections, but &s;o much only as appeared &s;ufficient to give my reader a true idea of what the law is, whereby he may know when it is tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed; and what his duty, as a lover of rectitude, requires. He may read them at large in Allin&s;on's edition, as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>The law &s;ays&mdash;<HI>No licence &s;hall be granted to any per&s;on but &s;uch who come well recommended, by at lea&s;t &s;ix free|holders of the neighbourhood, as being in good repute for ho|ne&s;ty and temperance, and well accommodated, &amp;c.

<P>Are all tavernkeepers in good repute for temperance, or rather are not many of them well known to the Ju&s;tices who grant them licences to be very intemperate, and &s;uch who are likely to encourage it in others? But they come recommended; the Court cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to know all who apply. Be it &s;o. But many of them are well known to the Court, as al&s;o the &s;candalous orders they have heretofore kept, and that they are not accommodated as the law requires, and often &s;ituate in private corners, or where there is not any ju&s;t pretence of nece&s;&s;ity to an&s;wer the end of that in&s;titution, which is in fact e&s;tabli&s;hing tippling-hou&s;es by authority, to debauch the morals of the people, there being at the writing of this five taverns on the road from Coopers Ferries to Salem, in the di&s;tance of five miles and an half. Did the Ju&s;tices make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to examine into the &s;ituation of propo&s;ed taverns,
<PB N="10" REF="018458_0010_0FA76E3495C86698">whether nece&s;&s;ary, if the &s;igners were of the neighbour|hood, and of good repute, and not tipplers in taverns, they might ea&s;ily di&s;cover if the per&s;on recommended was within the de&s;cription of the law, and if not (which I believe is oftener the ca&s;e than otherwi&s;e) careful to fine tho&s;e who dare offend the law by &s;o impo&s;ing upon them, they would &s;hew them&s;elves real friends to their country, and worthy the dignity of their &s;tations. The good ef|fects of &s;uch a conduct would &s;oon appear; and will any one pretend to &s;ay their duty and office qualification doth not enjoin this care in a matter wherein the good of the commonwealth is &s;o highly intere&s;ted? For, unle&s;s &s;ome method can be fallen upon to check the licentious con|duct &s;o much practi&s;ed in the&s;e hou&s;es, parents may in|deed &s;it down and &s;orrow, and in&s;tead of being careful to &s;ave &s;omething for their children, may conclude the great|e&s;t kindne&s;s will be, not to afford them the means of de|bauching them&s;elves with the fruits of their care in tho&s;e &s;eminaries of corruption, a practice &s;o common with young heirs of the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>The difficulty of checking a licence of conduct among a free people is made an excu&s;e for it by &s;ome, which is ju&s;t in other words &s;aying&mdash;We are willing to do as we plea&s;e, and to give others the &s;ame liberty. Here, if I am not mi&s;taken, is the root of the mi&s;chief. The dif|ficulty is really not &s;o very great, were the executive au|thority but men who joined example with their power, paid a &s;trict obedience to laws them&s;elves, and with a becoming firmne&s;s exacted it from others, always careful to puni&s;h the wilful violators. The ta&s;k, I believe, would then be ea&s;y. I my&s;elf a few years pa&s;t travelled in three of the New-England &s;tates, and &s;uppo&s;ing taverns to be the &s;ame there as in my own country, was very unwilling to lodge in them, and endeavoured &s;everal evenings to get private lodgings, offering to pay full price for what I had, but could not &s;ucceed, and &s;oon found I could lodge and be entertained as quietly in their taverns, as in private hou&s;es; and for &s;everal weeks that I was in tho&s;e parts, &s;aw no tippling or di&s;orderly conduct in any
<PB N="11" REF="018458_0011_0FA76E368B876698">of them, nor one per&s;on di&s;gui&s;ed with liquor. If &s;uch order and decorum can be pre&s;erved in New-England, why not in New-Jer&s;ey? And further, a kin&s;man who was in France a con&s;iderable time during the late war gave me the like account of that country, and a&s;&s;ured me that from what he &s;aw, a per&s;on might travel over the kingdom, and not &s;ee a drunken man. This excel|lent oeconomy appears to have been brought about by not &s;uffering their hotels, or hou&s;es for public entertainment, to keep any &s;pirituous liquors to &s;ell. O America! were thy rulers virtuous enough to e&s;tabli&s;h a like regulation, how many millions would it &s;ave, that is now &s;pent up|on thy lu&s;ts, and perhaps numberle&s;s &s;ouls from perdition. Reader, reflect a moment. Can a &s;ingle rea&s;on of weight be given again&s;t &s;uch a reform here? at lea&s;t that no &s;pi|rits, &s;imple or mixed, nor foreign liquor of any kind, &s;hould be kept to &s;ell in taverns. Their true u&s;e is to accommodate travellers and pa&s;&s;engers with lodging and nece&s;&s;ary entertainment; a dram, bowl of punch, or gla&s;s of wine, cu&s;tom only renders nece&s;&s;ary. Were taverns upon &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment, people of the be&s;t characters would keep them, and u&s;e them when occa&s;ion required. Whereas, in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, it is rather a di&s;reputa|tion for a &s;ober per&s;on to be &s;een in &s;ome of our taverns, nor will they lodge in one if they can make any other &s;hift, which occa&s;ions private hou&s;es in &s;ome places to be much burdened. The public would al&s;o be much better &s;upplied with what is nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful, their profits and attention being now chiefly on tipplers; and indeed, if no other rea&s;on were &s;ufficient, the public debt we are likely &s;o long to groan under ought to induce our rulers to give every di&s;couragement to the introduction of foreign liquors, that are equally unnece&s;&s;ary and mi&s;chievous.</P>
<P>Every tavernkeeper enters into a recognizance of <HI>twen|ty pounds, not to game, nor &s;uffer others to game in his hou&s;e for money, or the value of money, and in all things, as a public hou&s;ekeeper, to maintain good order and rules;</HI> and yet&mdash;how a&s;toni&s;hing&mdash;that per&s;ons who have entered into &s;uch a recognizance in the face of the county &s;hould
<PB N="12" REF="018458_0012_0FA76E36C46536B0">dare to &s;uffer a conduct, and that the mo&s;t public and notorious, whereby they forfeit that recognizance almo&s;t every day they live; but &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hing, that all this &s;hould pa&s;s unnoticed, and hardly an in&s;tance ever known where it hath been called in que&s;tion. If this is not a mockery of the &s;olemnity of laws, I know not any thing which de&s;erves the term. But the &s;cene exhibited in the ca&s;e of Con&s;tables is &s;till more extraordinary; the &s;acredne&s;s of laws, and &s;olemnity of oaths are treated as objects de&s;titute of the lea&s;t binding force, and affords a &s;orrowful &s;pecimen of the manners of a people, when the &s;tronge&s;t bands human wi&s;dom can provide, to make man faithful to man, are treated with &s;o little ceremony, which hath a direct tendency to di&s;&s;olve, or render nuga|tory, every civil compact. This ought indeed to alarm the community; for like a hole through a water bank, if not &s;topped, the breach will grow wider until the who&s;e enclo&s;ure is deluged. If one good law may be tramp|led upon with impunity, it is a kind of licence to treat all laws in the like manner. Let us &s;ee if the portrait hath wronged the original. Con&s;tables are <HI>&s;trictly com|manded to make diligent &s;earch within their re&s;pective di&s;tricts, for per&s;ons who &s;ell &s;trong liquor without licence, and to in|&s;pect taverns at lea&s;t four times in the year, and report to the &s;e&s;&s;ions all evil practices they di&s;cover, &s;uch as gaming, tippling, &s;elling more liquor than is nece&s;&s;ary for refre&s;hment, tippling on the Lord's day; if rates are up in their hou&s;es as the law requires; if they demand, or receive more than &s;aid rates allow; &s;ell liquer to any apprentice, &s;ervant or &s;lave; or &s;uffer any di&s;orders contrary to their recogni|zance.</HI> And that they may have no excu&s;e from ignor|ance, the Clerk of the Court is enjoined to give each Con|&s;table a li&s;t of tavernkeepers names, and the Court to acquaint them with their duty, and command them to perform it, which they <HI>&s;olemnly qualify they will do;</HI> and there the farce ends, and little or no further notice taken either by Court, Clerk or Con&s;table. Yea, &s;ome Ju&s;tices and Con&s;tables are them&s;elves perhaps as ready as any to trample upon the&s;e judicious regulations, and thereby
<PB N="13" REF="018458_0013_0FA76E37828C8EB0">encourage others to do it without hazard. What name this de&s;erves, let every &s;erious Chri&s;tian judge. The con&s;equences which naturally flow from &s;uch a contempt of the&s;e laws is indeed felt by all, and every one appears &s;en&s;ible of, but is become &s;o familiar, that, generally &s;peaking, it operates like laudanum, lulls into a &s;tate of ea&s;e and content, without &s;eeking a remedy.</P>

<P>I have &s;aid &s;o much on the &s;ubject of taverns, &amp;c.

<PB N="15" REF="018458_0015_0FA76E3907BF75A0">common practice again, and no marvel, when civil officers of the foremo&s;t rank will countonance it by receiving drams from the cryer, which he is furni&s;hed with to entice people to bid, as a reward to the highe&s;t bidder, thereby to inflame his ambition, that he may di&s;dain to be outdone.

I am acquainted with an in&s;tance of this kind, in a village where &s;eldom a week pa&s;&s;ed without &s;everal hor&s;e-races, when a neighbour who lived &s;everal miles off, being grieved at the con&s;equences, exerted him&s;elf in the above manner, and &s;o effectually &s;topped it, that for ten years pa&s;t there has not been an attempt to renew the practice.</P>
<P>That of &s;hooting matches is &s;till more ea&s;ily puni&s;hed, by only giving the names of the per&s;ons concerned there|in, and witne&s;&s;es to prove it, to a Grand Juror or States Attorney.</P>
<P>As to <HI>drunkenne&s;s</HI> and <HI>prophane &s;wearing,</HI> they are &s;uch <HI>fa&s;hionable Vices</HI> among our <HI>&s;uperiors,</HI> that I de&s;pair of their being puni&s;hed, while &s;o many of <HI>tho&s;e</HI> who are <HI>cho&s;en</HI> to <HI>make laws,</HI> and <HI>tho&s;e</HI> appointed to <HI>execute them,</HI> think it no blemi&s;h on their characters to bid open defiance in tho&s;e re&s;pects, not only to human laws, but in the mo&s;t daring manner to the laws of that tremendous Judge, be|fore whom they know they mu&s;t &s;oon appear,&mdash;and there I leave them, and proceed to addre&s;s my fellow-citizens at large.</P>

The confu&s;ion of the late times were in a great degree &s;uch, wherein every man did what was right in his own eyes, vice and profanity, with brazen front, &s;talked about in open day, bidding defiance to re&s;traint or controul. The Magi&s;trate who was de&s;irous to di&s;charge his duty by enforcing the laws, found him&s;elf un&s;upported, and too feeble for the mighty ta&s;k. Hence a licence of conduct, and perver&s;ion of manners en&s;ued; numberle&s;s abu&s;es for want of the curb of law were &s;uffered, overlooked, (and &s;orrowful to &s;ay) too often countenanced by &s;ome who held the &s;word of Ju&s;tice.&mdash;That this is a true &s;tate of the ca&s;e, hardly any one will deny.&mdash;The &s;torm is now pa&s;t, the raging billows are become calm, the chan|nel of ju&s;tice is now undi&s;turbed by the bloody &s;word and roaring cannon.&mdash;Now, fellow-citizens, the <HI>calls</HI> of our common <HI>intere&s;t,</HI> our <HI>country,</HI> our <HI>religion,</HI> and our <HI>God,</HI> is to each individual in their &s;everal &s;tations, to exert them&s;elves in promoting the general good of our infant States, and &s;trengthen the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety.&mdash;May we with thankful hearts improve the opportunity, and Ame|rica become as con&s;picuous in the annals of time, for the rectitude of her manners, and love of virtue, as &s;he is for the love of liberty, the continued enjoyment of which &s;he can only thus &s;ecure.</P>
<P>In all the departments of civil government, there are none who have it &s;o much in their power to check and &s;uppre&s;s vice, as the magi&s;tracy. They may indeed be ju&s;t|ly termed the <HI>guardians</HI> of the <HI>laws,</HI> and <HI>manners</HI> of the <HI>people.</HI> But alas! how few who&s;e conduct manife&s;ts a con|&s;cientious care faithfully to di&s;charge the duties of that &s;tation in this re&s;pect, which ought to be a &s;erious &s;ub|ject to all intru&s;ted with authority, if the opinion of an eminent author is believed&mdash;<Q>That each one mu&s;t an|&s;wer for their own offences, and rulers for the &s;ins of others, which they could have prevented and did not.</Q> Eli's care &s;eems to confirm this doctrine. He appears to have been a worthy man. Neverthele&s;s how &s;evere the &s;en|tence again&s;t him for not re&s;training his &s;on's vices.&mdash;I mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h the reflection might make an impre&s;&s;ion on
<PB N="17" REF="018458_0017_0FA76E3A8AC5EB58">every mind equal to its importance. It would occa&s;ion tho&s;e in the foremo&s;t &s;tations to be very guarded in the appointing of others under them, like Mo&s;es, to choo&s;e men <HI>fearing God</HI> and <HI>hating covetuou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Such Magi&s;trates are a ble&s;&s;ing to a people, ever mindful to di&s;charge the duties of their &s;tations, not &s;o much to plea&s;e men, as him, at who&s;e awful Tribunal they &s;oon expect to appear, to account for the u&s;e of that &s;hare of power he hath de|legated to them.</P>
<P>It would al&s;o lead Grand Juries to a&s;&s;ert the antient dignity of their office, in a &s;erious di&s;charge of the very exten&s;ive and important power with which they are in|tru&s;ted, of impeaching mal-admini&s;tration and dignified crimes, dragging vice out of its dark lurking holes, and teaching a reverence to the laws.&mdash;Their power is indeed very great, as their title&mdash;<HI>The Grand Inque&s;t for the County,</HI> and their qualification, point out; which were they religi|ou&s;ly to di&s;charge, the effects would reach beyond what is generally &s;uppo&s;ed. I may not be a competent judge, but mu&s;t believe mo&s;t of the abu&s;es pointed out in the foregoing extracts are objects of their enquiry and pre&s;en|tation; and though a Judge is not puni&s;hable for an <HI>error</HI> in his judgment, where he uprightly endeavours to di&s;|charge his duty, yet it may ju&s;tly be que&s;tioned whether Ju&s;tices are not liable to be called to an account by Grand Juries for granting licences again&s;t their own knowledge, and a manife&s;t evidence of want of proper qualification in the per&s;on licen&s;ed, contrary to the true intent and meaning of the laws.&mdash;However, the legi&s;lative body might be addre&s;&s;ed on &s;uch a conduct to good effect, and is an object highly worthy attention. In general, I expect the following are doubtle&s;s &s;o&mdash;Clerks and Con&s;tables who &s;hew a contemptuous di&s;regard to the duties requir|ed&mdash;di&s;orderly taverns&mdash;&s;uch who demand more than their rates allow&mdash;&s;uch who dare to impo&s;e on a Court by &s;igning an untrue recommendation&mdash;Under Sheriff or Goaler, who &s;hall &s;ell liquor to the pri&s;oners&mdash;&s;hopkeep|ers who encourage frolicking, tippling, &amp;c. in their hou&s;es &mdash;and tho&s;e little pe&s;ts, who, under pretence of &s;elling
<PB N="18" REF="018458_0018_0FA76E3B47B1FC68">cakes, are many of them real tippling hou&s;es, where children and the refu&s;e of mankind re&s;ort, and &s;o pro|lific is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> breed, as in &s;ome places to be in &s;ight of each other, an increa&s;ing evil, which calls for the vigi|lance of Grand Juries to extirpate.&mdash;Whether all the&s;e mi&s;chiefs are within their cognizance and influence or not, the Council a&s;&s;igned them by the con&s;titution can point out; and &s;urely the langui&s;hing calls of virtue, re|ligion, and their country's good, are forcible incentives to every &s;uitable exertion.</P>
<P>And now a few words to Magi&s;trates&mdash;You, gentle|men, are rai&s;ed above your brethren by commi&s;&s;ions. This is a gift from others, but to ri&s;e above them by virtue and good works, depends on your&s;elves, will add digni|ty to the &s;tation, give a weight and influence, and make you loved and revered. Without this, your elevations will only expo&s;e your flaws the more to the notice and con|tempt of tho&s;e below you. E&s;teem begets a chearful obe|dience, but to obey tho&s;e we de&s;pi&s;e, is like a &s;tony piece of bread that almo&s;t choaks in &s;wallowing&mdash;Reflect, I be&s;eech you, on the importance of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed&mdash;how much the &s;cale of virtue and vice is poi&s;ed by your ex|ample and your power.&mdash;If you fear God, and love your country, demon&s;trate it by u&s;ing the &s;word of ju&s;tice as <HI>a terror to evil doers, and prai&s;e of them who do well.</HI> This is the true u&s;e of power, which every human &s;anction ought to corroborate, and will promote at the &s;ame time the two greate&s;t events man can be employed about&mdash; your country's good, and your own pre&s;ent and eternal happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h every intelligent per&s;on would often ad|vert to the foundation of government, detached from &s;o|ciety. Its original object was, to pre&s;erve order, re&s;train corrupt nature, curb and puni&s;h the vices of the people for the good of the whole, agreeable to rules and &s;anctions agreed upon by the whole. In delegating this power, the &s;ociety do not re&s;ign all further care about the com|mon good, but re&s;erves in it&s;elf a power by its Repre&s;en|tatives, Grand Juries, &amp;c. of enquiring into and im|peaching
<PB N="19" REF="018458_0019_0FA76E3EEA38B358">peaching mal-admini&s;tration. In this &s;en&s;e each indivi|dual is, or ought to be, a watch upon the conduct of tho&s;e him&s;elf has agreed to inve&s;t with authority for the gene|ral benefit, and if any of them betray their tru&s;t, neglect their duty, or pervert the end of their appointment, the common good demands it of him to di&s;cover, and endea|vour to have the mi&s;chief remedied; this the very nature of things confirm. Government is a creature of &s;ociety, which inve&s;ts it with all the power it can legally have. The term Maje&s;ty (among human di&s;tinctions) ought on|ly to be a&s;cribed to &s;ociety.&mdash;Society is the creator, go|vernment the creature; government is created for &s;ociety, and not &s;ociety for government. But alas, how liable are human in&s;titutions to be perverted, and none was ever more than government. The fir&s;t &s;ervant of the &s;tate is &s;tiled Maje&s;ty, and his con&s;tituents generally treated as a &s;tock of creatures on a farm, the property of every new ma&s;ter. From this fountain a degree of the &s;ame in&s;olence but too much runs through every department of power, from the King to the Con&s;table, who think them&s;elves ill u&s;ed if their conduct is in&s;pected, or in the lea&s;t called in que&s;tion by tho&s;e from whom their authority is derived; and indeed, as matters &s;tand, it is pretty tickli&s;h to at|tempt, and would lead one to &s;uppo&s;e the above rea&s;on|ing mu&s;t be all wrong&mdash;that a King was fir&s;t created and a country given him, and then a race formed of in|ferior mold to people it,&mdash;or, as a humurous author has it&mdash;<HI>That mankind are born with &s;addles on their backs, and the bu&s;ine&s;s of government is to ride them.</HI> What a humi|liating and degrading picture of the common herd of ra|tional beings&mdash;and is it not a true one?&mdash;</P>
<P>But what does all this rant mean? What end is it to an&s;wer? Government is an arduous bu&s;ine&s;s, and tho&s;e who rule well are worthy of double honor. All this I fully admit. No man can give honor and obedience to good rulers more chearfully than my&s;elf. Such neither neglect nor abu&s;e their power, nor gra&s;p after more than is given them. They act in it as a duty the good of the community demands, and when that requires, will more
<PB N="20" REF="018458_0020_0FA76E4016CFA538">freely re&s;ign their dignity than they received it: An ex|ample of this kind we have &s;een in the fir&s;t and mo&s;t di|&s;tingui&s;hed man in America. To worth of this &s;ort the people are never ungrateful&mdash;But at &s;trutting importance without merit, they cannot but laugh (a &s;ight not unu|&s;ual in our time.) The&s;e, in&s;tead of being attentive to the duties of their &s;tation, uniting their authority and in|fluence for the public good, &s;pend their zeal in pur&s;uing power, promoting parties, abu&s;ing, calumniating, and worrying tho&s;e who di&s;approve their conduct. Such ru|lers are entitled only to contempt; they have no claim to honor.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations on government were &s;ugge&s;ted from an earne&s;t de&s;ire, that all per&s;ons united in civil &s;ociety would a&s;&s;ert the dignity of humanity, and of freemen, in giving their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to enforce obedience to laws which them&s;elves have agreed to be governed by, and is the doctrine I wi&s;h to inculcate&mdash;<HI>That the good of each in|dividual being in&s;eparably connected with the good of the whole, the good of the whole ought to be every one's care</HI>&mdash; That laws and &s;anctions agreed upon by the whole, to promote their joint intere&s;ts, ought to be held &s;acred, and every wilful tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, &s;o far lays wa&s;te the enclo|&s;ure of law, the only protection we have to our lives, li|berty, religion, &amp;c. is &s;o far an enemy to the communi|ty, and ought to be puni&s;hed. The law makes it crimi|nal to conceal great crimes, or &s;uffer the offender that is in our power to e&s;cape. The &s;ame rea&s;on holds good in degree in every &s;pecies of offences again&s;t law; nor can any one demon&s;trate a greater love for his country, or yield her more e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice, than by exerting his in|fluence in promoting a due reverence for and obedience to her good and whole&s;ome laws, more e&s;pecially &s;uch of them who&s;e object is to encourage virtue, and &s;uppre&s;s vice, the ba&s;is on which government is founded; to im|pre&s;s this &s;entiment is my motive for writing. A large part of my life I have at times been pained on reflecting upon the mi&s;chievous effects, and flood of corruption, &s;pread abroad from hou&s;es for public entertainment, which
<PB N="21" REF="018458_0021_0FA76E4220BF2208">indeed admits a que&s;tion, whether all the labour and pains be&s;towed by mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel promotes virtue, equal to what they promote vice; a portentous mi&s;chief, which it appears very clear to me might be entirely re|medied by a virtuous execution of the laws now in force. To endeavour to &s;timulate my fellow-citizens to an exer|tion of their power to effect this, drew me &s;ome time back to ca&s;t a few hints together for the news-paper, but found my&s;elf too much cramped in that way, and threw it by. But the &s;ubject continuing often to pre&s;ent it&s;elf to my reflection, as a debt due to the community, of which I am my&s;elf a part, I have now di&s;charged it in as brief a manner as I well could, omitting however much I intended to have &s;aid; and &s;hould it an&s;wer no other purpo&s;e than to engage &s;ome abler hand to take it up, and do the &s;ubject greater ju&s;tice, I &s;hall not think my labour wholly lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now conclude with part of a &s;peech delivered to a renowned, and then a free people, but who did not long continue &s;o, which this &s;peech &s;eemed to predict. The ob&s;ervations it contains are worthy the notice and practice of every government, and particularly tho&s;e of America in the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<Q><P>When a nation is puffed up with an opinion of her own &s;trength and &s;afety, it is then that her councils are likely to be ra&s;h and imprudent, and their con&s;e|quences fatal, that I cannot help being alarmed at the &s;ecurity in which I &s;ee my country at pre&s;ent &s;unk. Pro&s;perity generally produces arrogance, ra&s;hne&s;s and folly; want and di&s;tre&s;s naturally &s;ugge&s;t prudent and moderate re&s;olutions: Therefore it is not &s;o ea&s;y, as at fir&s;t it may &s;eem, to determine which condition is for the purpo&s;e of real happine&s;s, the mo&s;t to be de|fired for individuals, or for national pro&s;perity&mdash;a &s;tate of perfect &s;uperiority to danger and fear&mdash;or of circum&s;tances requiring-caution, frugality and atten|tion: For perfect pro&s;perity generally brings with it the cau&s;es of misfortune; when narrower circum|&s;tances often lead to care, prudence and &s;afety.</P>

Government ought to promote to high &s;tations men eminent for virtue, as a means to excite a general emu|lation among all ranks, as the people are con&s;tantly ob&s;erved to form their manners upon the model of their &s;uperiors.</P>
<P>What chiefly tends to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a &s;tate is, a police founded in habitual mode&s;ty, temperance, in|tegrity, valour and patrioti&s;m. The general preva|lence of the&s;e di&s;pe&s;itions is not brought about by laws or &s;anctions, but by education, example, and a judi|cious exerci&s;e of power, whereby vice is di&s;counte|nanced, without directly puni&s;hing it, and the &s;ub|jects drawn into that voluntary rectitude of behaviour, which force will never produce.
