<P>PAUL and Timotheus, &s;ervants of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to all the &s;aints in Chri&s;t Je&s;us who are at Philippi,
<MILESTONE N="2"> with the bi&s;hops and deacons, Grace <HI>be</HI> unto you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.
<MILESTONE N="3"> I thank my God upon every mention of you,
<MILESTONE N="4"> Always in all my prayers making &s;upplication for you all with joy,
<MILESTONE N="5"> For your fellow|&s;hip in the go&s;pel from the fir&s;t day until now: Being per&s;uaded of this very thing,
<MILESTONE N="6"> that he who hath begun a good work in you, will perfect <HI>it</HI> un|til the day of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,
<MILESTONE N="7"> As it is right for me to think this of you all, becau&s;e I have you in my heart, who were all partakers of my grace, both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation
<PB N="5" REF="046353_0005_10210E4AF8709FA8">of the go&s;pel.
<MILESTONE N="8"> For God is my witne&s;s, how I long for you all,
<MILESTONE N="9"> with the bowers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more, in all knowledge and <HI>in</HI> all <HI>&s;piritual</HI> &s;en&s;e, That ye may try the things that are excellent,
<MILESTONE N="10"> that ye may be &s;incere and without offence unto the day of Chri&s;t,
<MILESTONE N="11"> Being filled with the fruits of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, which are through Chri&s;t Je&s;us, to the glory and prai&s;e of God.</P>
<P>Now I would have you know,
<MILESTONE N="12"> brethren, that the things concerning me have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the go&s;pel:
<MILESTONE N="13"> So that my bonds in Chri&s;t have been made manife&s;t in the
<PB N="6" REF="046353_0006_10210E44E5E8DD50">whole palace,
<MILESTONE N="14"> and to all others: And many of the brethren tru&s;ting in the Lord through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to &s;peak the word with|out fear.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="15"> Some indeed preach Chri&s;t even through envy and &s;trife;
<MILESTONE N="16"> but &s;ome through good will. The one preach Chri&s;t out of contention, not &s;incerely, &s;up|po&s;ing to add affliction to my bonds:
<MILESTONE N="17"> But the o|thers out of love, knowing that I am &s;et for the defence of the go&s;pel.
<MILESTONE N="18"> What then? &s;till every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Chri&s;t is preached; and in this I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. For I know that this &s;hall turn to my &s;alvation,
<MILESTONE N="19"> through your prayer, and the &s;upply of the Spirit of Je&s;us Chri&s;t:
<MILESTONE N="20"> According to my earne&s;t expect|ation and hope, that I &s;hall be a&s;hamed in nothing, but that with all boldne&s;s, as always, <HI>&s;o</HI> now al&s;o, Chri&s;t &s;hall be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.</P>
<P>For to me to live <HI>is</HI> Chri&s;t,
<MILESTONE N="21"> and to die <HI>is</HI> gain.
<PB N="7" REF="046353_0007_10210E4CC41F5028">But if <HI>I am</HI> to live in the fle&s;h,
<MILESTONE N="22"> this <HI>is</HI> the fruit of my labour, and what I &s;hould chu&s;e, I know not. For I am in a &s;trait between two,
<MILESTONE N="23"> having a de&s;ire to depart and to be with Chri&s;t, <HI>which is</HI> far better. But to remain in the fle&s;h <HI>is</HI> more needful for you.
<MILESTONE N="24"> And being per&s;uaded of this,
<MILESTONE N="25"> I know that I &s;hall remain and continue with you all, for your further|ance and joy of faith:
<MILESTONE N="26"> That your rejoicing for me may abound through Chri&s;t Je&s;us, by my pre|&s;ence with you again.
<MILESTONE N="27"> Only let your behaviour be worthy of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, that whether I come and &s;ee you, or be ab&s;ent, I may hear concern|ing you, that ye &s;tand fa&s;t, in one &s;pirit, with one &s;oul &s;triving together for the faith of the go&s;pel, And in nothing terrified by your adver&s;aries,
<MILESTONE N="28"> which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of &s;alvation.
<MILESTONE N="29"> This al&s;o <HI>is</HI> of God. For to you it is given with regard to Chri&s;t, not only to believe on him,
<MILESTONE N="30"> but al&s;o to &s;uffer for him: Having the &s;ame conflict, which ye &s;aw in me, and now

<P>For your&s;elves, brethren, know our entrance to you,
<MILESTONE N="2"> that it was not in vain: But even after we had &s;uffered before, and had been &s;hamefully treated at Philippi, as ye know, we were bold thro' our God to &s;peak to you the go&s;pel of God with much contention. For our exhortation <HI>is</HI> not of deceit,
<MILESTONE N="3"> nor of unclean|ne&s;s,
<MILESTONE N="4"> nor in guile. But as we have been approved of God to be intru&s;ted with the go&s;pel, &s;o we &s;peak, not as plea&s;ing men, but God who trieth our hearts. For neither at any time u&s;ed we flattering words,
<MILESTONE N="5"> as ye know, nor a cloak of covetou&s;ne&s;s: God is witne&s;s:
<PB N="35" REF="046353_0036_10210EA81243C418">Nor &s;ought we glory of men,
<MILESTONE N="6"> neither from you, nor from others, when we might have been burden&s;ome, as the Apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t.
<MILESTONE N="7"> But we were gentle in the mid&s;t of you, even as a nur&s;e cheri&s;heth her own children.
<MILESTONE N="8"> So, loving you tenderly, we were ready to impart to you not only the go&s;pel of God, but our own &s;ouls al&s;o,
<MILESTONE N="9"> becau&s;e ye were dear to us. For ye remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached to you the go&s;pel of God.
<MILESTONE N="10"> Ye <HI>are</HI> wit|ne&s;&s;es, and God, how ho&s;tly and ju&s;tly and unblamea|bly we behaved among you that believe:
<MILESTONE N="11"> As ye know how we exhorted and comforted every one of you, as a father his own children.
<MILESTONE N="12"> And charged you to walk worthy of God, who hath called you to his kingdom and glory.
<MILESTONE N="13"> For this cau&s;e al&s;o thank we God with|out cea&s;ing, <HI>even</HI> becau&s;e when ye received the word of God which ye heard from us, ye received <HI>it,</HI> not <HI>as</HI> the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, who likewi&s;e effectually worketh in you that believe.
<MILESTONE N="14"> For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, which are in Judea: for ye al&s;o &s;uffered the &s;ame things from your own countrymen,
<MILESTONE N="15"> as they likewi&s;e from the Jews: Who

<MILESTONE N="16"> Forbidding us to &s;peak to the Gentiles, that they may be &s;aved, to fill up their &s;ins always: but wrath is come upon them to the uttermo&s;t.</P>
<P>But we,
<MILESTONE N="17"> brethren, being taken from you for a &s;hort time, in pre&s;ence, not in heart, laboured with great de&s;ire the more abundantly to &s;ee your face.
<MILESTONE N="18"> Wherefore we would have come to you (even I Paul) once and again,

<DIV3 TYPE="outline">
<P>THE Mother of <HI>Timothy</HI> was a Jewe&s;s, but his Father was a Gentile. He was converted to Chri&s;tianity very early; and while he was yet but a Youth, was taken by St. <HI>Paul</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the Work of the Go&s;pel, chiefly in watering the Churches which he had planted.</P>
<P>He was therefore properly (as was <HI>Titus</HI>) an itinerant Evangeli&s;t, a kind of &s;econdary Apo&s;tle, who&s;e Office was, to regulate all Things in the Churches to which he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; and to in&s;pect and reform what&s;oever was ami&s;s either in the Bi&s;hops, Deacons, or People.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Paul</HI> had doubtle&s;s largely in&s;tructed him in private Conver&s;a|tion for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Execution of &s;o weighty an Office. Yet to &s;ix Things more upon his Mind, and to give him an Opportunity of having Re|cour&s;e to them afterward, and of communicating them to others, as there might be Occa&s;ion; as al&s;o to leave Divine Directions in Writ|ing, for the U&s;e of the Church and its Mini&s;ters in all Ages, he &s;ent him this excellent Pa&s;toral Letter, which contains a great Variety of important Sentiments for their Regulation.</P>
<P>Though St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;tiles him his <HI>own &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n in the faith,</HI> yet he does not appear to have been converted by the Apo&s;tle; but only to have been exceeding dear to him, who had e&s;tabli&s;hed him therein; and whom he had diligently and faithfully <HI>&s;erved, like a &s;on with hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fa|ther in the Go&s;pel.

<P>I thank my God,

<HEAD>NOTES ON The Epi&s;tle to the HEBREWS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="outline">
<P>IT is agreed by the general Tenor of Antiquity, that this Epi&s;tle was written by St. <HI>Paul;</HI> who&s;e other Epi&s;tles were &s;ent to the Gentile Converts: This only to the <HI>Hebrews.</HI> But this improper In&s;cription was added by &s;ome later Hand. It was &s;ent to the Jewi&s;h <HI>Uel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ni&s;t Chri&s;tians,</HI> di&s;per&s;ed through various Countries. St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Method and Stile are ea&s;ily ob&s;erved therein. He places, as u&s;ual, the Propo&s;ition and Divi&s;ion before the Treati&s;e; (c. ii. 7.) He &s;ubjoins the Exhortatory to the Doctrinal Part; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">otes the &s;ame Scriptures, c. ii. 8. c. x. 30, 38. c. i. 6.) and u&s;es the &s;ame Expre&s;|&s;ions as el&s;ewhere. But why does he not prefix his Name, which it is plain, from c. iii. 19, was dear to them to whom he wrote? Becau&s;e he prefixes no In&s;cription, in which, it at all, the Name would have been mentioned. The Ardor of his Spirit carries him directly upon his Subject, (ju&s;t like St. <HI>John</HI> in his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle) and throws bac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his u&s;ual Salutation and Thank&s;giving to the Conclu|&s;ion.</P>

St. <HI>Paul</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> at <HI>Rome,</HI> three Years before the De&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> Therefore this Epi&s;tle likewi&s;e was written, while the Temple was &s;tanding. St. <HI>Peter</HI> wrote a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> before his Martyrdom, and refers to the Epi&s;tles of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in particular.</P>
<P>The Scope of it is, To confirm, their Faith in <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> And this he does, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> demon&s;trating his Glory.

<MILESTONE N="3"> Without father, without mother, without pedigree, having neither begin|ning of days, nor end of life, but being made like the &s;on of God, remaineth a prie&s;t continually. Now con&s;ider how great this man <HI>was,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="4"> to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the &s;poils,

<P>JAMES a &s;ervant of God, and of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to the twelve tribes which are &s;cattered abroad, greeting.</P>
<P>My brethren,
<MILESTONE N="2"> count it all joy, when ye fall in|to divers temptations,
<MILESTONE N="3"> Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
<MILESTONE N="4"> But let patience have <HI>its</HI> perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire,
<MILESTONE N="5"> If any of you want wi&s;|dom, let him a&s;k of God, who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it &s;hall be given him.
<MILESTONE N="6"> But let him a&s;k in faith, nothing doubting: for he that doubteth is like a wave of the &s;ea,
<PB N="140" REF="046353_0139_1021101E2F0B55C0">driven with the wind and to&s;&s;ed.
<MILESTONE N="7"> For let not that man think that he &s;hall receive any thing from the Lord.
<MILESTONE N="8"> A double-minded man is un&s;table in all his ways.
<MILESTONE N="9"> Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
<MILESTONE N="10"> But the rich, in that he is made low; becau&s;e as the flower of the gra&s;s he &s;hall pa&s;s away.
<MILESTONE N="11"> For the &s;un aro&s;e with a &s;corch|ing heat, and withered the gra&s;s, and the flower fell off, and the beauty of its form peri&s;hed: &s;o al&s;o &s;hall the rich man fade away in his ways. Happy <HI>is</HI> the man that endureth temptation:
<MILESTONE N="12"> for when he hath been proved, he &s;hall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promi&s;ed to them that love him.
<MILESTONE N="13"> Let no man who is tempted &s;ay, I am tempted of God a for God cannot be tempted with evil,
<MILESTONE N="14"> neither tempteth he any man. But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away by
<PB N="141" REF="046353_0140_10211020021979C0">his own de&s;ire and inticed.
<MILESTONE N="15"> Then de&s;ire having conceived, bringeth forth &s;in; and &s;in being per|fected, bringeth forth death.</P>
<P>Do not err,
<MILESTONE N="16"> my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above,
<MILESTONE N="17"> de&s;cend|ing from the Father of lights, with whom is no variablene&s;s neither &s;hadow of turning.
<MILESTONE N="18"> Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of fir&s;t fruits of his creatures.</P>
<P>Wherefore,
<MILESTONE N="19"> my beloved brethren, let every man be &s;wift to hear, &s;low to &s;peak, &s;low to wrath.
<PB N="142" REF="046353_0141_10211021DD684260">
<MILESTONE N="20"> For the wrath of man worketh not the righteou&s;|ne&s;s of God.
<MILESTONE N="21"> Therefore laying a&s;ide all the filthi|ne&s;s and &s;uperfluity of wickedne&s;s, receive with meekne&s;s the ingrafted word which is able to &s;ave your &s;ouls.
<MILESTONE N="22"> But be ye doers of the word and not hearers only,
<MILESTONE N="23"> deceiving your&s;elves. For if any one be an hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like a man beholding his natural face in a gla&s;s.
<MILESTONE N="24"> For he beheld him&s;elf, and went away, and immediately forgot what manner of man he was.
<MILESTONE N="25"> But he that looketh diligently into the per|fect law, <HI>the law</HI> of liberty, and continueth <HI>therein,</HI> this man being not a forgetful hearer, but a doet of the work, this man &s;hall be happy in his doing. If any one be ever &s;o religious,
<MILESTONE N="26"> and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this
<PB N="143" REF="046353_0142_10211025AFD21890">man's religion is vain.
<MILESTONE N="27"> Pure religion and undefiled before God even the Father is this, To vi&s;it the fatherle&s;s and widows in their affliction, <HI>and</HI> to keep him&s;elf un&s;potted from the world.</P>

The true Prede&s;tination, or Fore-appointment of GOD is, 1. He that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved, from the Guilt and Power of Sin. 2. He that endureth to the End, &s;hall be &s;aved eternally. 3. They who receive the precious Gift of Faith, thereby become the Sons of GOD: And being Sons, they &s;hall receive the Spirit of Holine&s;s, to walk as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> al&s;o walked. Throughout every Part of this Appointment of GOD, <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> and <HI>Duty</HI> go Hand in Hand. All is free Gift; and yet &s;uch is the Gift, that the final I&s;&s;ue depends on our future Obe|dience to the heavenly Call. But other Prede&s;tination than this, either to Life or Death eternal, the Scripture knows not of. More|over, it is, 1. Cruel Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons: An unju&s;t Regard of one, and an unju&s;t Di&s;regard of another. It is mere <HI>creature partiality,</HI> and not <HI>infinite Ju&s;tice:</HI> 2. It is not <HI>plain</HI> Scripture-Doctrine (if true:) but rather, incon&s;i&s;tent with the expre&s;s written Word, that &s;peaks of GOD's univer&s;al Offers of Grace: His Invitations, Promi&s;es, Threat|enings, being all <HI>general.</HI> 3.

It is of fatal Con|&s;equence; all Men being ready, on very &s;light Grounds, to fancy <HI>them&s;elves</HI> of the Elect Number. But the Doctrine of Prede&s;tination is entirely changed from what it formerly was. <HI>Now</HI> it implies nei|ther Faith, Peace, nor Purity.

He is no more a Fountain of &s;piritual Life in the Soul of Believers, but leaves his Elect inwardly <HI>dry,</HI> and outwardly <HI>unfruitful;</HI> and is made little more than a Refuge from the Image of the heavenly: even from Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t: <HI>thro' &s;anctification of the Spirit</HI>&mdash;Through the renewing and purifying In|fluences of his Spirit on their Souls: <HI>unto obedience</HI>&mdash;To engage and enable them to yield them&s;elves up to all holy Obedience, the Foun|dation of all which is, the <HI>&s;prinkling of the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>&mdash; The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Blood of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which was typified by the Sprinkling of the Blood of Sacrifices under the Law; in Allu&s;ion to which it is called <HI>the blood of &s;prinkling.</HI></P>

<HEAD>NOTES ON The Fir&s;t Epi&s;tle of St. JOHN.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="outline">
<P>THE great Similitude, or rather Samene&s;s both of Spirit and Expre&s;&s;ion, which runs through St. <HI>John</HI>'s Go&s;pel, and all his Epi&s;tles, is a clear Evidence of their being written by the &s;ame Per&s;on. In this Epi&s;tle he &s;peaks not to any particular Church, but to all the Chri&s;tians of that Age, and in them to the whole Chri&s;tian Church in all &s;ucceeding Ages.</P>
<P>Some have apprehended, that it is not ea&s;y to di&s;cern the Scope and Method of this Epi&s;tle. But if we examine it with Simplicity, the&s;e may readily be di&s;covered. St. <HI>John</HI> in this Letter, or rather Tract (for he was pre&s;ent with Part of tho&s;e to whom he wrote) has this apparent Aim, To confirm the happy and holy Communion of the Faithful with GOD and <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> by de&s;cribing the Marks of that ble&s;&s;ed State.</P>
<P>The Parts of it are Three:
<TABLE>
<ROW>
<CELL>I. The Preface,</CELL>
<CELL>C. i. 1&mdash;4</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>II. The Tract it&s;elf,</CELL>

</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>III. The Conclu&s;ion,</CELL>
<CELL>13&mdash;21</CELL>
</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>In the Preface he &s;hews the Authority of his own Preaching and Writing, and expre&s;ly points out (ver. 3.) the De&s;ign of his pre&s;ent Writing. To the Preface exactly an&s;wers the Conclu&s;ion, more largely explaining the &s;ame De&s;ign, and recapitulating tho&s;e Marks, by <HI>we know</HI> thrice repeated (ch. v. 18, 19, 20.)</P>
<P>The Tract it&s;elf has Two Parts, treating,
<TABLE>
<ROW>
<CELL>I. Severally,</CELL>
<CELL>&nbsp;</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>1. Of Communion with the Father,</CELL>

<ROW>
<CELL>Of the Te&s;timony of the <HI>Father,</HI> and <HI>Son,</HI> and <HI>Spirits</HI> On which Faith in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the being born of GOD, Love to GOD and his Children, the keeping his Commandments, and Victory over the World are founded,</CELL>
<CELL>C. v. 1&mdash;12</CELL>
</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>The Parts frequently begin and end alike. Sometimes there is an Allu&s;ion in a preceding Part, and a Recapitulation in the &s;ub&s;equent. Each Part treats of a Benefit from GOD, and the Duty of the Faith|ful derived therefrom by the mo&s;t natural Inferences.</P>

<P>It is ob&s;ervable, the Three in the one Ver&s;e are oppo&s;ed not con|jointly, but &s;everally to the Three in the other: As if he had &s;aid, not only the Spirit te&s;tifies, but al&s;o the Father; (<HI>John</HI> v. 37.)

It mu&s;t now appear to every rea&s;onable Man, how ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary the eighth Ver&s;e is. St. <HI>John</HI> could not think of the Te&s;timony of the Spirit, and Water, and Blood, and &s;ubjoin <HI>The te&s;timony of God is greater,</HI> without thinking al&s;o of the Te&s;timony of the Son and Holy Gho&s;t, yea and mentioning it in &s;o &s;olemn an Enumeration. Nor can any po&s;&s;ible Rea&s;on be devi&s;ed, why without <HI>Three te&s;tifying in heaven</HI>&mdash;he &s;hould enumerate <HI>Three,</HI> and no more <HI>who te&s;tify on earth</HI>&mdash;The Te&s;timony of all is given <HI>on earth,</HI> not <HI>in heaven,</HI> but <PB N="204" REF="046353_0203_102110EDFA0B5448"> they who te&s;tify are part on Earth, part in Heaven; the Witne&s;&s;es who are on Earth te&s;tify chiefly concerning his Abode on Earth, though not excluding his State of Exaltation.

<DIV3 TYPE="introduction">
<P>'TIS &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for any that either love or fear GOD, not to feel their Hearts extremely affected, in &s;eriou&s;ly reading either the Beginning, or the latter Part of <HI>the Revelation.</HI> The&s;e, 'tis evident, we cannot con&s;ider too much: but the intermediate Parts I did not &s;tudy at all for many Years: As utterly de&s;pairing of under|&s;tanding them, after the fruitle&s;s Attempts of &s;o many wi&s;e and good Men; and perhaps I &s;hould have lived and died in this Sentiment, had I not &s;een the Works of the great <HI>Bengelius.</HI> But the&s;e revived my Hopes of under&s;tanding even the Prophecies of this Book: At lea&s;t many of them in &s;ome good Degree; for perhaps &s;ome will not be opened but in Eternity. Let us however ble&s;s GOD for the Mea|&s;ure of Light we may enjoy, and improve it to his Glory.</P>
<P>The following Notes are mo&s;tly tho&s;e of that excellent Man; a few of which are taken from his <HI>Gnomon Novi Te&s;tamenti,</HI> but far more from his <HI>Ekklarte Offenbarung,</HI> which is a full and regular Comment on <HI>the Revelation.</HI> Every Part of this I do not undertake to defend. But none &s;hould condemn him, without reading his Proofs at large. It did not &s;uit my De&s;ign to in&s;ert the&s;e: they are above the Capacity of ordinary Readers. Nor had I Room to in&s;ert the entire Tran&s;la|tion of a Book which contains near twelve hundred Pages.</P>
<P>All I can do is, partly to tran&s;late, partly abridge the mo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary of his Ob&s;ervations; allowing my&s;elf the Liberty to alter &s;ome of them, and to add a few Notes where he is not full. His Text, it may be ob&s;erved, I have taken almo&s;t throughout, which I appre|hend
<PB N="220" REF="046353_0219_1021125935E45360">he has abundantly defended both in the <HI>Gnomon</HI> it&s;elf, and in his <HI>Apparatus</HI> and <HI>Cri&s;is in Apocalyp&s;in.</HI></P>
<P>Yet I by no means pretend to under&s;tand, or explain all that is contained in this my&s;terious Book. I only offer what Help I can to the &s;erious Enquirer, and &s;hall rejoice if any be moved thereby, more carefully to read and more deeply to con&s;ider the Words of this Prophecy. Ble&s;&s;ed is he that does this with a &s;ingle Eye. His La|bour &s;hall not be in vain.</P>

<P><LABEL>V. 1.</LABEL>  <HI>The Revelation</HI>&mdash;Properly &s;o called; for Things covered be|fore, are here <HI>revealed</HI> or unveiled. No Prophecy in the Old Te&s;ta|ment has this Title: It was re&s;erved for this alone in the New. It is as it were a Manife&s;to, wherein the Heir of all Things declares, That all Power is given Him in Heaven and Earth, and that He will in the End gloriou&s;ly exerci&s;e that Power, maugre all the Oppo&s;ition of all his Enemies. <HI>Of Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>&mdash;Not, of <HI>John the Divine,</HI> a Title added in latter Ages. Certain it is, that Appellation, <HI>the Di|vine,</HI> was not brought into the Church, much le&s;s was it affixed to <HI>John</HI> the Apo&s;tle, till long after the Apo&s;tolic Age. It was St. <HI>John</HI> indeed who wrote this Book; but the Author of it is <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Which God gave unto him</HI>&mdash;According to his holy, glorified Huma|nity, as the Great Prophet of the Church. GOD gave <HI>the Revela|tion</HI> to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> made it known to his Servants. <HI>To &s;hew</HI>&mdash;This Word recurs, ch. xxii. 6. And in many Places the Parts of this Book refer to each other. Indeed the whole Structure of it breathes the Art of GOD, comprizing in the mo&s;t fini&s;hed Com|pendium, Things to come, many, various; near, intermediate, re|mote; the greate&s;t, the lea&s;t; terrible, comfortable; old, new; long, &s;hort; and the&s;e interwoven together, oppo&s;ite, compo&s;ite; relative to each other at a &s;mall, at a great Di&s;tance; and therefore &s;ome|times as it were di&s;appearing, broken off, &s;u&s;pended, and afterwards unexpectedly and mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onably appearing again. In all its Parts it has an admirable Variety, with the mo&s;t exact Harmony, beauti|fully illu&s;trated by tho&s;e very Digre&s;&s;ions which &s;eem to interrupt it. In this Manner does it di&s;play the manifold Wi&s;dom of GOD &s;hining in the Oeconomy of the Church through &s;o many Ages. <HI>His &s;er|vants</HI>&mdash;Much is comprehended in this Appellation. 'Tis a great Thing to be a Servant of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> This Book is dedicated particularly to the Servants of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in the &s;even Churches in <HI>A&s;ia:</HI> But not exclu&s;ive of all his other Servants, in all Nations and Ages. It is one &s;ingle Revelation, and yet &s;ufficient for them all, from the <PB N="221" REF="046353_0220_102107D63037F6B0"> Time it was written to the End of the World. Serve thou the LORD <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> in Truth. So &s;halt thou learn his Secret in this Book. Yea, and thou &s;halt feel in thy Heart, whether this Book be divine or not. <HI>The things which mu&s;t &s;hortly come to pa&s;s</HI>&mdash;The Things con|tained in this Prophecy did begin to be accompli&s;hed &s;hortly after it was given; and the whole might be &s;aid to <HI>come to pa&s;s &s;hortly,</HI> in the &s;ame Sen&s;e as St. <HI>Peter</HI> &s;ays, <HI>The end of all things is at hand;</HI> and our LORD him&s;elf. <HI>behold I come quickly.</HI> There is in this Book a rich Trea&s;ure of all the Doctrines pertaining to Faith and Holine&s;s. But the&s;e are al&s;o delivered in other Parts of Holy Writ; &s;o that <HI>the Revelation</HI> need not to have been given for the Sake of the&s;e. The peculiar De&s;ign of this is, <HI>To &s;hew the things which mu&s;t come to pa&s;s.</HI> And this we are e&s;pecially to have before our Eyes, whenever we read or hear it.</P>

<P><LABEL>V. 3.</LABEL>  <HI>Happy is be that readeth, and they that hear the words of this Prophecy</HI>&mdash;Some have mi&s;erably handled this Book. Hence others are afraid to touch it. And while they de&s;ire to know all Things el&s;e, reject only the Knowledge of tho&s;e which GOD hath &s;hewn. They enquire after any thing rather than this: as if it were written. <HI>Happy is be that doth not read</HI> this Prophecy. Nay, but <HI>happy is be that readeth, and they that hear and keep the words thereof:</HI> E&s;pecially at this Time, when &s;o con&s;iderable a Part of them is on the Point of being fulfilled.</P>
<P>Nor are Helps wanting whereby any &s;incere and diligent Enquirer may under&s;tand what he reads therein. The Book it&s;elf is written in the mo&s;t accurate Manner po&s;&s;ible. It di&s;tingui&s;hes the &s;everal Things whereof it treats by &s;even Epi&s;tles, &s;even Seals, &s;even Trum|pets, &s;even Phials; each of which Sevens is divided into Four and <PB N="222" REF="046353_0221_1021111F171053D0"> Three. Many Things the Book it&s;elf explains, as the &s;even Stars; the &s;even Candle&s;ticks; the Lamb, his &s;even Horns and &s;even Eyes; the Incen&s;e; the Dragon; the Heads and Horns of the Bea&s;ts; the fine Linen; the Te&s;timony of <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> And much Light ari&s;es from comparing it with the ancient Prophecies, and the Predictions in the other Books of the New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>In this Book our LORD has comprized what was wanting in tho&s;e Prophecies, touching the Time which followed his A&s;cen&s;ion, and the End of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Polity. Accordingly it reaches from the Old <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to the New, reducing all Things into one Sum in the exacte&s;t Order, and with a near Re&s;emblance to the ancient Pro|phets. The Introduction and Conclu&s;ion agree with <HI>Daniel;</HI> the De&s;cription of the Man-Child and the Promi&s;es to <HI>Sion</HI> with <HI>I&s;aiah;</HI> the Judgment of <HI>Babylon,</HI> with <HI>Jeremiah:</HI> Again, the Determination of Times with <HI>Daniel:</HI> the Architecture of the Holy City, with <HI>Ezehiel;</HI> the Emblems of the Hor&s;es, Candle&s;ticks, &amp;c. with <HI>Zechariab.</HI> Many Things largely de&s;cribed by the Prophets are here &s;ummarily repeated; and frequently in the &s;ame Words. To them we may then u&s;efully have Recour&s;e. Yet the <HI>Revelation</HI> &s;uffices for the explaining it&s;elf, even if we do not yet under&s;tand tho&s;e Prophecies; yea, it ca&s;ts much Light upon them. Frequently likewi&s;e, where there is a Re&s;emblance between them, there is a Difference al&s;o; <HI>the Revelation</HI> as it were taking a Stock from one of the old Prophets, and in&s;erting a new Graft into it. Thus <HI>Zechariah</HI> &s;peaks of two Olive-trees. And &s;o does St. <HI>John;</HI> but with a different Meaning. <HI>Daniel</HI> has a Bea&s;t with Ten Horns. So has St. <HI>John;</HI> but not with quite the &s;ame Signification. And here the Difference of Words, Emblems, Things, Times ought &s;tudiou&s;ly to be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Our LORD foretold many Things before his Pa&s;&s;ion; but not all Things: For it was not yet &s;ea&s;onable. Many Things likewi&s;e his Spirit foretold in the Writings of the Apo&s;tles, &s;o far as the Nece&s;|&s;ities of tho&s;e Times required, now be comprizes them all in one &s;hort Book; therein pre&s;uppo&s;ing all the other Prophecies, and at the &s;ame Time, explaining, containing, and perfecting them in one Thread. It is right therefore to compare them; but not to mea&s;ure the Fulne&s;s of the&s;e by the Scantine&s;s of tho&s;e preceding.</P>
<P><HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> when on Faith, foretold what would come to pa&s;s in a &s;hort Time; adding a brief De&s;cription of the la&s;t Things. Here he foretells the intermediate Things; &s;o that both put together, con&s;ti|tute one compleat Chain of Prophecy.

This Pa&s;tor, Bi&s;hop, or Over&s;eer, had the peculiar Care over that Flock: On him the Pro&s;perity of that Con|gregation in a great Mea&s;ure depended: And he was to an&s;wer for all tho&s;e Souls at the Judgment-Seat of <HI>Chri&s;t. And the &s;even can|dle&s;ticks are &s;even churches</HI>&mdash;How &s;ignificant an Emblem is this! For a Candle&s;tick, though of Gold, has no Light of it&s;elf: neither has any Church, or Child of Man. But they receive from <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> the Light of Truth, Holine&s;s, Comfort, that it may &s;hine to all around them.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this was &s;poken St. <HI>John</HI> wrote it down, even all that is contained in this Fir&s;t Chapter. Afterwards what was contained in the Second and Third Chapters, was dictated to him in like Manner.</P>
<P>Ch. ii. of the following Letters to the Angels of the &s;even Churches it may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak fir&s;t, in general, and then particularly.</P>
<P>In general we may ob&s;erve, when the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> were to receive the Law at Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> they were fir&s;t to be purified. And when the Kingdom of GOD was at Hand, <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t prepared Men for it by Repentance. In like Manner we are prepared by the&s;e Letters for the worthy Reception of this glorious <HI>Revelation.</HI> By following the Directions given herein, by expelling incorrigibly wicked Men, and putting away all Wickedne&s;s, tho&s;e Churches were prepared to receive this precious Depo&s;itum. And whoever in any Age would profitably read or hear it, mu&s;t ob&s;erve the &s;ame Admonitions.</P>
<P>The&s;e Letters are a Kind of &s;even-fold Preface to the Book. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> now appears in the Form of a Man (not yet under the Emblem of a Lamb) and &s;peaks mo&s;tly in proper, not in figurative Words. It is not all ch. iv. 1. that St. <HI>John</HI> enters upon that Grand Vi&s;ion which takes up the Re&s;idue of the Book.</P>
<P>There is in each of the&s;e Letters,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. A Command to write to the Angel of the Church;</ITEM>

<P>The Addre&s;s in each Letter is expre&s;&s;ed in plain Words, the Pro|mi&s;e, in figurative. In the Addre&s;s our LORD &s;peaks to the Angel of each Church which then was, and to the Members thereof di|rectly: Whereas in the Promi&s;e he &s;peaks of all that &s;hould over|come, in whatever Church or Age, and deals out to them one of the Precious Promi&s;es, (by way of Anticipation) from the la&s;t Chapters of the Book.</P>

This Holine&s;s is the Sum of all prai&s;e, which is given to the Almighty Creator, for all that he does and reveals concerning him&s;elf, till the new Song beings with it new Matter of Glory.</P>
<P>This Word properly &s;ignifies <HI>&s;eparated,</HI> both in <HI>Hebrew</HI> and other Languages. And when GOD is termed Holy, it denotes that Excel|lence, which is altogether peculiar to him&s;elf; and the Glory flow|ing from all his Attributes conjoined, &s;hining forth from all his Works, and darkening all Things be&s;ides it&s;elf, whereby he is, and eternally remains, in an incomprehen&s;ible Manner <HI>&s;eparate</HI> and at a Di&s;tance, not only from all that is impure, but likewi&s;e from all that is created.</P>
<P>GOD is <HI>&s;eparate</HI> from all Things. He is, and works from him&s;elf, out of him&s;elf, in him&s;elf, thro' him&s;elf, for him&s;elf. Therefore He is the Fir&s;t and the La&s;t, the only One and the Eternal, Living and Happy, Endle&s;s and Unchangeable, Almighty, Omni&s;cient, Wi&s;e and True, Ju&s;t and Faithful, Gracious and Merciful.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that Holy and Holine&s;s mean the &s;ame as GOD and Godhead; and as we &s;ay of a King, <HI>His Maje&s;ty,</HI> &s;o the Scripture &s;ays of GOD, <HI>His Holine&s;s. (Heb.</HI> xii. 10.) The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of GOD. When GOD is &s;poken of, he is often named, <HI>The Holy One.</HI> And as GOD &s;wears by his Name, &s;o he does al&s;o by his Holine&s;s, that is, by Him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This Holine&s;s is often &s;tiled Glory; often his Holine&s;s and Glory are celebrated together. (<HI>Lev.</HI> x. 3. <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> vi. 3.) for Holine&s;s is covered Glory, and Glory is uncovered Holine&s;s.

<P>That is al&s;o termed <HI>Holy,</HI> which is con&s;ecrated to Him, and for that End <HI>&s;eparated</HI> from other Things. And &s;o is that wherein we may be like GOD, or united to him.</P>
<P>In the Hymn re&s;embling this, recorded by <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> ch. vi. 3. is ad|ded, <HI>The whole earth is full of his glory.</HI> But this is deferred in <HI>the Revelation,</HI> till the Glory of the LORD (his Enemies being de&s;troyed) fills the Earth.</P>

Yet, 3. We &s;hould not pre&s;cribe to this Prophecy, as if it mu&s;t needs admit or exclude this or that hi&s;tory, according as we judge one or the other, to be of great or &s;mall Importance.

<P>The Seventh Angel did not begin to &s;ound, till after the going forth of the Second Wo: But the Trumpets were given to him and the other &s;ix together (as were afterward the Phials to the &s;even An|gels) And it is accordingly &s;aid of all the Seven together, that <HI>they prepared them&s;elves to &s;ound.</HI> The&s;e therefore were not Men, as &s;ome have thought, but Angels properly &s;o called.</P>

<P>Ch. x. From the fir&s;t Ver&s;e of this Chapter to ch. xi. 13. Prepa|ration is made for the important Trumpet of the &s;eventh Angel.

The Period to which both the&s;e refer begins during the &s;econd Wo, (as appears ch. xi. 14.) but being once begun, it extends in a continued Cour&s;e far into the Trumpet of the &s;eventh Angel.

Be armed both again&s;t Force and Fraud, even with the whole Armour of GOD.<HI>Out of the &s;ea</HI>&mdash;That is <HI>Europe.</HI> So the three Woes (the fir&s;t being in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the &s;econd about the <HI>Euphrates</HI>) move in a Line from Ea&s;t to We&s;t. This Bea&s;t is the <HI>Romi&s;h Papacy,</HI> as it came to a Point Six Hundred Years &s;ince, &s;tands now, and will for &s;ome Time lon|ger. To this, and no other Power on Earth agrees the whole Text, and every Part of it, in every Point: As me may &s;ee with the ut|mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">dence, from the Propo&s;itions following.</P>
<P><HI>Prop.</HI> 1. It is one and the &s;ame Bea&s;t, having &s;even Heads, and ten Horns, which is de&s;cribed in this and in the xviith Chapter. Of Con&s;equence his Heads are the &s;ame, and his Horns al&s;o.</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 2. This Bea&s;t is a &s;piritually-&s;ecular Power, oppo&s;ite to the Kingdom of Chri&s;t. A Power not merely Spiritual or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, nor merely Secular or Political; but a Mixture of both. He is a Se|cular Prince; for a Crown, yea and a Kingdom are a&s;cribed to him. And yet he is not merely Secular. For he is al&s;o a <HI>fal&s;e Prophet.</HI></P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 3. The Bea&s;t has a &s;trict Connexion with the City of <HI>Rome.</HI> This clearly appears from the xviith Chapter.</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 4. The Bea&s;t is now exi&s;ting. He is not pa&s;t: for <HI>Rome</HI> is now exi&s;ting: And it is not till after the De&s;truction of <HI>Rome,</HI> that the Bea&s;t is thrown into the Lake. He is not altoge|ther to come. For the &s;econd Wo is long &s;ince pa&s;t, after which the third came quickly. And pre&s;ently after it began, the Bea&s;t ro&s;e out of the Sea. Therefore, whatever he is, he is now exi&s;ting.</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 5. The Bea&s;t is the <HI>Romi&s;h Papacy.</HI> This manife&s;tly follows from the Third and Fourth Propo&s;itions; the Bea&s;t has a &s;trict Con|nexion with the City of <HI>Rome;</HI> and the Bea&s;t is now exi&s;ting. Therefore either there is &s;ome other Power more &s;trictly connected with that City, or the Pope is the Bea&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 6. The Papacy or Papal Kingdom began long ago.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable Particulars relating to this, are here &s;ubjoin|ed; taken &s;o high as abundantly to &s;hew the Ri&s;e of the Bea&s;t, and brought down as low as our own Time, in order to throw a Light on the following Part of the Prophecy.</P>

<P>We are not here con&s;idering their fal&s;e Doctrines, but their un|bounded Power.

<P>The&s;e, the mo&s;t eminent <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Writers own to be his genuine Sayings. And his Actions agree with his Words. Hitherto the Popes had been &s;ubject to the Emperors, tho' often unwillingly. But now the Pope began him&s;elf, under a Spiritual Pretext, to act the Em|peror of the whole Chri&s;tian World: the immediate Di&s;pute was about the Inve&s;ture of Bi&s;hops, the Right of which each claimed to him&s;elf. And now was the Time, for the Pope either to give up or e&s;tabli&s;h his Empire for ever. To decide which, <HI>Gregory</HI> excom|municated the Emperor <HI>Henry</HI> IV. "having fir&s;t, &s;ays <HI>Platina,</HI> de|prived him of all his Dignities." The Sentence ran in the&s;e Terms: "Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Peter,</HI> Prince of the Apo&s;tles, incline I be&s;eech thee, thine Ears, and hear me thy Servant&mdash;in the Name of the Omnipotent GOD, Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t, I ca&s;t down the Emperor <HI>Henry</HI> from all Imperial and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">egal Authority, and ab&s;olve all Chri&s;tians, that were his Subjects, from the Oath whereby they u&s;ed to &s;wear Allegiance to true Kings.

<P>The &s;ome Sentence he repeated at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ome</HI> in the&s;e Terms.

Confirm this therefore by your Authority, ye mo&s;t holy Princes of the Apo&s;tles, that all may now at length know, as ye have Power to bind and loo&s;e in Heaven, &s;o we have Power to give and take away on Earth, Empires, Kingdoms, Principalities, and what&s;oever Men can have."</P>
<P>When <HI>Henry</HI> &s;ubmitted, then <HI>Gregory</HI> began to reign without con|troul. In the &s;ame Year 1077, on <HI>September;,</HI> he fixt a new Aera of Time called <HI>the Indiction;</HI> u&s;ed at <HI>Rome</HI> to this Day.</P>
<P>Thus did the Pope claim to him&s;elf the whole Authority over all Chri&s;tian Princes. Thus did he take away or confer Kingdoms and Empires, as a King of Kings. Neither did his Succe&s;&s;ors fail to tread in his Steps. It is well known, the following Popes have not been wanting to exerci&s;e the &s;ame Power, both over Kings and Em|perors. And this the later Popes have been &s;o far from di&s;claiming, that three of them have &s;ainted this very <HI>Gregory,</HI> namely, <HI>Clement</HI> VIII. <HI>Paul</HI> V. and <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nedict</HI> XIII. Here is then the Bea&s;t, that is, the King: in Fact &s;uch, though not in Name; according to that remarkable Ob&s;ervation of Cardinal <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> "Antichri&s;t will govern the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, yet without the Name of <HI>Roman</HI> Empe|ror." His &s;piritual Title prevented his taking the Name, while he exerci&s;eth all the Power. Now <HI>Gregory</HI> was at the Head of this No|velty. So <HI>Aventine,</HI> him&s;elf, "<HI>Gregory</HI> VII. was the fir&s;t Founder of the Pontifical Empire."</P>
<P>Thus the Time of the A&s;cent of the Bea&s;t is clear. The Apo&s;tacy and My&s;tery of Iniquity gradually increa&s;ed, till he aro&s;e, who <HI>op|po&s;eth and exalteth him&s;elf above all.</HI> (2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> ii. 3.) Before the &s;eventh Trumpet the Adver&s;ary wrought more &s;ecretly. But &s;oon after the Beginning of this, the Bea&s;t openly oppo&s;es his Kingdom to the Kingdom of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 8. The Empire of <HI>Hildebrand</HI> properly began in the Year 1077. Then it was, that upon the Emperor's leaving <HI>Italy, Gregory</HI> exerci&s;ed his Power to the full. And on the 1&s;t of <HI>September,</HI> in this Year, he began his famous <HI>Epocha.</HI></P>
<P>This may be farther e&s;tabli&s;hed and explained by the following Ob&s;ervations.</P>

From this Time the Senate, and not tho Pope, enjoyed the Supreme Civil Power.

He e&s;caped and fled to the Emperor, who quickly &s;ent him back in great State. In the Year 800 the Emperor came to <HI>Rome,</HI> and &s;hortly after, the <HI>Roman</HI> People, who had hitherto cho&s;en their own Bi&s;hops, and looked upon them&s;elves and their Senate as having the &s;ame Rights with the ancient Senate and People of <HI>Rome,</HI> cho&s;e <HI>Charles</HI> for their Emperor, and &s;ubjected them&s;elves to him, in the &s;ame Manner as the ancient <HI>Romans</HI> did to their Emperors. The Pope crowned him and paid him Homage on his Knees, as was formerly done to the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors: And the Emperor took an Oath "to defend the Holy <HI>Roman</HI> Church in all its Emoluments." He was al&s;o created Con&s;ul, and &s;tyled him&s;elf thenceforward <HI>Agu&s;tus, Emperor of the Romans.</HI> Afterwards he gave the Govern|ment of the City and Dutchy of <HI>Rome</HI> to the Pope, yet &s;till &s;ubject to him&s;elf.</ITEM>

This Monarchy is like a River which runs from its Foun|tain in one Channel, but in its Cour&s;e &s;ometimes takes in other Ri|vers, &s;ometimes is it&s;elf parted into &s;everal Streams, yet is &s;till one continued River. The <HI>Roman</HI> Power was at fir&s;t undivided. But it was afterwards divided into various Channels, till the Grand Divi|&s;ion into the Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern Empires, which likewi&s;e under|went various Changes.

Now whatever Power the <HI>Romans</HI> had before <HI>Gregory</HI> VII. that <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Bea&s;t contains. Whatever Power the Papacy has had from <HI>Gregory</HI> VII. this the Apocalyptic Bea&s;t repre|&s;ents. But this very Bea&s;t, (and &s;o <HI>Rome</HI> with its la&s;t Authority) is com|prehended under that of <HI>Daniel. And upon his heads a name of bla&s;phemy</HI> &mdash;To a&s;cribe to a Man what belongs to GOD alone is bla&s;phemy. Such a Name the Bea&s;t has, not on his Horns, nor on one Head, but on all. The Bea&s;t him&s;elf bears that Name, and indeed through his whole Duration. This is the Name of <HI>Papa</HI> or <HI>Pope;</HI> not in the innocent Sen&s;e wherein it was formerly given to all Bi&s;hops, but in that high and peculiar Sen&s;e wherein it is now given to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome,</HI> by him&s;elf, and his Followers: A Name which comprizes the whole Pre-eminence of the highe&s;t and mo&s;t Holy Father upon Earth.

<P>This deadly Wound was given him on his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Head <HI>by the &s;word,</HI> (ver. 14.) that is, by the bloody Re&s;i&s;tance of the &s;ecular Potentates, particularly the <HI>German</HI> Emperors.

<P>Two deadly Symptoms attended this Wound, 1. Schi&s;ms and open Ruptures in the Church. For while the Emperors a&s;&s;erted their Right, there were from the Year 1080 to the Year 1176 only, five open Divi&s;ions, and at lea&s;t as many Antipopes, &s;ome of whom were indeed the rightful Popes. This was highly dangerous to the Papal Kingdoms. But a &s;till more dangerous Symptom was, 2. The ri&s;ing of the Nobility at <HI>Rome,</HI> who would not &s;uffer their Bi&s;hop to be a &s;ecular Prince, particularly over them&s;elves. Under <HI>Innocent</HI> II. they carried their Point, re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the ancient Common-wealth, took away from the Pope the Government of the City, and left him only his epi&s;copal Authority.
