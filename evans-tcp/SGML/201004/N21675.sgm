<P>DOUBTLESS the de&s;ign of this text now appears to the greater part of this a&s;&s;embly. It is ea&s;y work to oppo&s;e enemies, but to oppo&s;e friends&mdash;to op|po&s;e brethren and &s;i&s;ters, di&s;ciples of our glorious Lord, is one of the mo&s;t difficult employments in the world: but every bible truth is precious, and plead for it we mu&s;t, though oppo&s;ed by a Calvin, a Flavel, an Ed|wards, or by all the &s;aints on the earth. Let us then attend to the pa&s;&s;age in view, and con&s;ider what bap|ti&s;m is, and who are the &s;ubjects of it.</P>
<P>The enquiry may be, 1. What is bapti&s;m? It is a &s;a|crament wherein our immer&s;ion in water repre&s;ents our being buried with Chri&s;t to the world, and ri&s;ing to newne&s;s of life; and al&s;o the burial of our bodies, and their re&s;urrection at the la&s;t day. Chambers' dictiona|ry explains the word bapti&s;m, which the Engli&s;h read|er may peru&s;e at his lei&s;ure. When bapti&s;m was per|formed in the apo&s;tolic age, we read of their repairing to places where there was much water. Philip and the Eunuch fir&s;t came unto a certain water, and then we read, not that they went back and came to it again; but, that they went down <HI>into</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Greek word EIS &s;ometimes means <HI>to,</HI> but mo&s;t naturally <HI>into;</HI> baptized often means <HI>wa&s;hed,</HI> but mo&s;t naturally <HI>immer&s;ed;</HI> and the mo&s;t natural &s;en&s;e of a word, mu&s;t always be preferred to one le&s;s natural, o|ther things being equal.</NOTE> the water, both Philip and the Eunuch, and he <HI>baptized</HI> him. Hence believ|ers

What a lively emblem it is of our being buried with Chri&s;t, and ri&s;ing at the la&s;t day! This canons be &s;aid of &s;prinkling&mdash;and accordingly not &s;prinkling, but bapti&s;m was almo&s;t the univer&s;al prac|tice of the chri&s;tian church for many centuries, and has bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> continued in the Greek church, down to the pre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent moment. <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> is a Greek word and if the Greek <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation do'nt know the meaning of their own words we may well enquire who does?

The text is the an&s;wer&mdash;<HI>Then they that gladly received his word, were baptized&mdash;</HI> "and their infants too" faith the word of man; but what &s;aith the word of the Lord? Where is the chapter, or ver&s;e, or &s;entence, or member of a &s;en|tence, which commands &s;uch a practice, or affords an

Ancient I&s;rael was reproved no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> only for doing what was forbidden, but for doing what was not commanded. <HI>They did that which I commanded them not, &s;aith the Lord, neither came it into my mind.</HI> 'But though there be no expre&s;s command for the practice, you &s;ay, yet we have con&s;equential evidence in its &s;avor.' Let us then inquire for it. If there be &s;uch con&s;equen|tial evidence, it mu&s;t depend on the truth of three pro|po&s;itions. Infants are vi&s;ibly in the new covenant&mdash; bapti&s;m is in the room of circumci&s;ion&mdash;there were three families in the apo&s;tolic age, one of which at lea&s;t had an infant or &s;ome other per&s;on baptized on the ground of the faith of the head of the family. All the arguments which are e&s;teemed conclu&s;ive by more than thirty authors who have written on the &s;ubject in Europe and America, depend on the truth of the&s;e three propo&s;itions: all that is &s;aid re&s;pecting the covenants, the olive-tree, the kingdom of heaven, the di&s;ciple&s;hip of infants and their intere&s;t in the promi&s;e, &amp;c. re&s;ts on the truth of one or other of the&s;e three propo&s;itions<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">If infants are not vi&s;ibly in the new covenant, they are not vi&s;ible di&s;ciples, not vi&s;ible &s;ubjects of the kingdom of heaven, nor vi&s;ibly graft|ed into the olive, nor vi&s;ibly intere&s;ted in the promi&s;e, <HI>Acts</HI> ii. 39. nor vi|&s;ibly holy in the new covenant &s;en&s;e. This will doubtle&s;s be granted.</NOTE> &s;o that if the&s;e fail, all fails and the point mu&s;t be &s;ur|rendered. More might be &s;aid to manife&s;t this, but probably it will not be denied. All we have to do then is to enquire whether the&s;e three propo&s;itions are true.</P>
<P N="1">1. Are infants vi&s;ibly in the new covenant? No! for this plain rea&s;on&mdash;they cannot appear to be in it, and they are not vi&s;ibly &s;uch as they cannot appear to be. I will make a new covenant with the hou&s;e of I&s;|rael,
<PB N="6" REF="028518_0004_0FD932429ABE7B38">(&s;aith the Lord) not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt: for this is the covenant that I will make with the hou&s;e of I&s;|rael after tho&s;e days, faith the Lord, I will put my laws in their mind, and write them in their hearts: and&mdash; they &s;hall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, &s;aying know the Lord: for all &s;hall know me, i. e. all with whom I make this new covenant &s;hall know me, from the lea&s;t to the greate&s;t: for I will be merciful to their unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and their &s;ins and their iniquities will I remember no more. How plain|ly this &s;hews that none can be really in the new cove|nant but really gracious per&s;ons. All &s;hall know me, (&s;piritually) for I will be merciful to their unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s, and their &s;ins and iniquities will I remember no more. And as none can be really in the new covenant but really gracious per&s;ons, &s;o none can appear to be in the new covenant, but tho&s;e who appear to be gracious, and, as appearance and vi&s;ibility are of the &s;ame import, whatever appears is vi&s;ible, and whatever is vi&s;ible can appear. There cannot be a vi&s;ible object, which can|not appear; and no per&s;on can be vi&s;ibly in any con|dition, while he cannot appear to be in that condition. Therefore if the infants of believers, as &s;uch, are vi&s;ibly in the new covenant, then they appear to be really in it. If infants are really in the new covenant, they are real|ly born again; and con&s;equently if they are vi&s;ibly in the new covenant, they are vi&s;ibly born again; and if they are vi&s;ibly born again, then they can appear to be born again, certainly. There may be vi&s;ibility of that of which there is no exi&s;tence, but there cannot be vi&s;i|bility of that which there can be no appearance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The terms vi&s;ibility and appearance, with their variations, are here u&s;ed in a &s;en&s;e which Dr. Hemmenway's late ingenious Di&s;cour&s;e con|cerning the church, calls <HI>improper</HI> and <HI>le&s;s proper,</HI> and which doubtle&s;s is &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ith relation to <HI>his</HI> proper &s;en&s;e, or the natural force of the words; but not with relation to this &s;ubject, as well as many others, unle&s;s it is Improper to u&s;e &s;uch terms in writing as men commonly u&s;e, learned or unlearned. 'Propriety or congruity of language (&s;ays Dr. Edwards) de|pends wholly on u&s;e.' The natural force of the above terms, was doubt|le&s;s no more unknown to pre&s;ident Edwards, than to Dr. Hemmenway, and yet with an eye to the common u&s;e of them, the pre&s;ident &s;ays, 'vi|&s;ible and real are words which &s;tand related to one another, as the words real and &s;eeming, true and apparent.' Among the learned and unlearned it is certainly a common, intelligible, and con&s;equently on the whole, a very proper way of &s;peaking, to &s;ay that a per&s;on may <HI>appear</HI> to be what he is not&mdash;that a per&s;on may <HI>appear</HI> to be a &s;incere friend, and may <HI>appear</HI> to be a good man: That there may be &s;uch an <HI>appearance</HI> both of per|&s;ons and things as admits of doubtful reality.&mdash;But though in this Di&s;|cour&s;e concerning the church, the doctor &s;ays that all vi&s;ibility is certain|ty&mdash;that 'if we have not light enough to a&s;certain the reality of a &s;uppo&s;|ed object, there is not enough to make it vi&s;ible. Yet in his book on the nature and &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, on which the late performance is prof-&s;&s;edly con&s;tructed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;eamed to think that po&s;&s;ibility would an&s;wer for vi&s;ibility. That we may have light enough to render a &s;uppo&s;ed ob|ject vi&s;ible without a&s;certaining the reality or even the probability of it. For in page 34 he &s;ays "if we &s;uppo&s;e the character of believers is given to little ones them&s;elves, it will make no difficulty: for as it cannot be denied that young children may have the &s;eeds of grace and faith in them &s;o being members of the church, they are in the account and acceptation of the church, believers according to their capacity, and may be &s;o term|ed even as we term them rational creatures before the proper exerci&s;e of their rational fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ulties plainly appears." Surely the doctor mu&s;t mean that they are in &s;ome degree vi&s;ible believers in the account of the chur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, for how can infants be &s;uch in their account and acceptation as they do not appear to them to be in the lea&s;t degree. Here then is vi&s;ible grace and faith in tho&s;e who only <HI>may</HI> have grace and faith; here is a vi&s;ible object. without our having light enough to a&s;certain its reality, or even probability.&mdash;Accordingly (in page 51) he &s;ays expre&s;sly that believers' children are vi&s;ibly heirs of &s;alvation. If po&s;&s;ibility of faith is the vi&s;ibi|lity of it, then the po&s;&s;ibility of unbelief is the vi&s;ibility of that al&s;o. If infants are vi&s;ible believers, becau&s;e they <HI>may have</HI> the &s;eed of grace,&mdash; then they are vi&s;ible unbelievers becau&s;e they <HI>may have</HI> the contrary. So here is a vi&s;ible believer, and a vi&s;ible unbeliever in the &s;ame per&s;on at the &s;ame time&mdash;the po&s;&s;ibility of which the doctor in his late an&s;wer to Mr. Emmon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> (page 30) con&s;iders very ab&s;urd for any one to &s;uppo&s;e. That there is not one to an hundred of the infants of believers &s;anctified from the womb, will doubtle&s;s be granted; allowing then a fifth part of them to die in infancy, there mu&s;t be a probability of eighty to one that any particular infant of a believer is in a gracele&s;s &s;tate; but there is not one in five hundred of them born without rational faculties. Therefore when the doctor &s;ays that infants may be termed believers, even as we term them rational creatures;&mdash;he might as well &s;ay they may be termed be|lievers, while we have a probability of eighty to one that they are not believers, even as we term them rational creatures, while we have a pro|bability of five hundred to one that they are rational creatures. Accor|ding to the doctor's repre&s;entation here, infants are believers and heirs of &s;alvation, not certainly, nor probably; but very improbably and vi&s;ibly. But to mention all the oppo&s;ites of the&s;e books in profe&s;&s;ed union, would be uncomfortable, and perhaps u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e&s;s.

Does that which is born of the fle&s;h appear to be &s;pirit in the eye of chri&s;tians, judging ac|cording to the rules of the go&s;pel?&mdash;no; &s;aith the &s;crip|ture; "That which is born of the fle&s;h, is fle&s;h; and that which is born of the &s;pirit, is &s;pirit." That which is born of the fle&s;h, even of believers, is fle&s;h; for, "neither becau&s;e they are the &s;eed of Abraham, are they all children, (&s;ays Paul) but in I&s;aac &s;hall thy &s;eed be called&mdash;<HI>that is,</HI> they which are the children of the fle&s;h the&s;e are not the children of God. True, the child of a believer is in a &s;en&s;e holy to him, and &s;o is the unbe|lieving con&s;ort. The unbelieving wife is &s;anctified to the hu&s;band, el&s;e were your children unclean, but now are they holy. i. e. The believer has a lawful and &s;anctified injoyment of his wife and child. They are holy to him as all things are which he has occa&s;ion to enjoy: for to the pure, all things are pure; and nothing to be refu&s;ed, if it be re|received with thank&s;giving: for it is <HI>&s;anctified</HI> by the word of God and prayer. The go&s;pel has removed the ceremonial uncleanne&s;s of Ezra's time. But neither the unbelieving wife, nor child of a believer is holy in the

Real &s;aints are tho&s;e who are &s;o in the eye of God, vi&s;ible &s;aints are tho&s;e who are &s;o in the eye of man&mdash;that is, in the eye of man's mind, which is his judgment or e&s;teem; and nothing &s;hort of <HI>apparent pro|bability or probable exhibition</HI> can amount to vi&s;ibility in the eye of man's rea&s;on or judgment. God has given to man the eye of rea&s;on and the eye of a chri&s;tian, which is rea&s;on &s;anctified and enlightened by a princi|ple of love.&mdash;But it implies a contradiction to &s;ay that that is vi&s;ible to the eye of rea&s;on, which does not ap|pear probable to rea&s;on. And if there be a per&s;on who is in this &s;en&s;e a vi&s;ible &s;aint, he is in the eye of a ratio|nal judgment a real &s;aint. Without di&s;pute &s;ome in|fants are real &s;aints; but it is vi&s;ible &s;aint&s;hip which the church is concerned with, and of this it is &s;hewn no in|fant is capable.

And Chri&s;t as the other party in this covenant tran&s;action, vi&s;ibly receives the child, as belonging to him, and on the condition which the parent profe&s;&s;es and promi&s;es to perform, he promi|&s;es to ble&s;s the child, and be&s;tow &s;alvation upon it. Therefore &s;uch chil|dren are vi&s;ibly &s;aints, and numbered among the &s;aved: for the profe&s;|&s;ion and engagements of the parents are to be relied on by the church&mdash; and that they will fulfill their promi&s;es re&s;pecting their children.

But &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome great degree of faithful|ne&s;s to be the condition, for the fulfilment of which, the promi&s;e of the parent might be relied upon by the church; would not the promi&s;e of Chri&s;t annexed to this degree of faithfulne&s;s be compleatly fulfilled, if the children of &s;uch parents were converted at 20, 40, or 60 year. of age. Of &s;everal things the church are quite uncertain: they know not whether the parent will live; or if he does, whether he will be faithful to his child; or if he is, whether he will be faithful enough to &s;ecure the child's &s;alva|tion; or if he &s;hould <HI>arrive</HI> to &s;uch a degree of faithfulne&s;s, they are &s;till wholly in doubt of the time when the promi&s;e &s;hall be fulfilled, whether next month, the next year, or the next age. Therefore, allowing there be &s;uch a connexion as the doctor &s;uppo&s;es, what a poor rea&s;on it affords to the church to view the child as really holy, and among the number of the &s;aved.

After all, it is matter of abundant thankfulne&s;s, that the promi&s;es of the bible annexed to faithfulne&s;s in parents, as well as mini&s;ters, are great and precious, tho' perhaps indefinite.

<PB N="13" REF="028518_0007_0FD9324C5E31FEE8">into covenant. But the new te&s;tament &s;peaks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch matters of the new covenant. Infants being once in covenant, &s;ay &s;ome, when were they ever cut off? This que&s;tion mu&s;t be an&s;wered by another. Infants being once in the covenant of Sinai, when were they ever cut off? Infants were as really in the covenant of Sinai, as in that of Abraham, but no &s;cripture has expre&s;sly cancelled that article of the Sinai covenant which admitted them. But 'the Sinai covenant was aboli&s;hed' you may &s;ay,&mdash;&s;o it was, as far as it re&s;pected the temporal &s;eed, the tempo|ral land, and temporal rights, and &s;o was the covenant of Abraham, and neither of them was aboli&s;hed or di&s;|annulled by the law or go&s;pel, as far as they had refer|ence to Chri&s;t and &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings. The &s;pirituality of both the&s;e covenants, is everla&s;ting. The Abraha|mic covenant, was included in the covenant of Sinai; as the learned Grotius has ju&s;tly ob&s;erved. Every pro|mi&s;e, every command, every ble&s;&s;ing of the covenant of Abraham, is found in the covenant of Sinai. Cir|cumci&s;ion in particular, was con&s;idered by Chri&s;t as ap|pertaining to the law of Mo&s;es&mdash;'Ye on the &s;abbath-day circumci&s;e a man that the law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> might not be broken.' And the covenant of Sinai was no more con|fined to the native Hebrews than the covenant of A|braham. Therefore the latter being included in the former, both waxed old and vani&s;hed away together; while the &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings which they both promi&s;ed, were more clearly exhibited than ever by the new cove|nant. The atonement of Jewi&s;h prie&s;ts typified and promi&s;ed the atonement of Chri&s;t and &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings: and the covenant of Abraham typified and promi&s;ed the new covenant and its &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings.&mdash;Yet the atone|ment of Jewi&s;h prie&s;ts was one thing, and the atone|ment of Chri&s;t was another&mdash;and the covenant of Abra|ham was one thing, and the new covenant was another. The covenant of Abraham had a two-fold a&s;pect; to the natural &s;eed promi&s;ing temporal ble&s;&s;ings, and to the
<PB N="14" REF="028518_0008_0FD9324DD85779D0">&s;piritual feed promi&s;ing &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings. When the Lord &s;ays to Abraham, 'I will be a God to thee &amp; to thy feed,' &amp;c. the meaning is I will be a God to thee and to thy natural &s;eed in a temporal &s;en&s;e, and a God to thee and thy &s;piritual &s;eed in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e&mdash;giving cana|an to the former, and heaven to the latter. Of the &s;ame nature are the covenants of Levi and David. There|fore all the&s;e covenants are &s;o many different covenants of promi&s;e, to which no doubt the apo&s;tle refers, when he tells the Ephe&s;ians that they had been aliens from this commonwealth of I&s;rael, and &s;trangers from the covenants of promi&s;e. But the new covenant has no &s;uch double a&s;pect&mdash;and here again is a wide difference between the latter and the former.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hence it appears that an infant may belong to Chri&s;t's kingdom on the earth, and yet not belong to his vi&s;ible kingdom. Chri&s;t in reality, has but one go&s;|pel kingdom, into which none enter but they who are born again; and this real kingdom is partly in heaven, and partly on the earth&mdash;'of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named.' Chri&s;t's real church does not really con&s;i&s;t of two &s;orts of per&s;ons, the one his friends and the other his enemies. His real church is really one bread and one body, and &s;o his vi&s;ible church is vi&s;ibly one bread and one body:&mdash;con&s;equently no one can be properly of his vi&s;ible kingdom, who is not vi|&s;ibly of his real kingdom. But of this vi&s;ibility infants are incapable, as already &s;hewn, and therefore cannot properly belong to Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible kingdom:&mdash;yet &s;ome of them doubtle&s;s belong to his real kingdom.&mdash; For 'of &s;uch is the kingdom of heaven' &s;aith our Lord. q. d. There are &s;ome infants who belong to my real kingdom; they are born again, which &s;hows that all in|fants are capable of receiving my ble&s;&s;ing. Therefore &s;uf|fer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them

<P N="3">3. Hence learn the incon&s;i&s;tency occa&s;ioned by infant member&s;hip. If infants are members of the church, they &s;hould be treated as &s;uch. They mu&s;t receive the Lord's &s;upper, as once they really did, from the third to the twelfth century.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">But it is &s;uppo&s;ed this pa&s;&s;age, 'let a man examine him&s;elf,' &amp;c. plainly excludes infants from this &s;acrament. But doctor Hemmen way tells us, that when Chri&s;t declares "no one can be his di&s;ciple, unle&s;s he deny him&s;elf and take up the cro&s;s," he &s;peaks to <HI>adults,</HI> not to <HI>infants;</HI> and hence infers (page 37) that infants may be di&s;ciples without taking up the cro&s;s. So here! will make the &s;ame eva&s;ion. Paul &s;peaks to a|dults, not to infants, and, 'do this in remembrance of me,' was &s;poken to adults, not to infants. <HI>Infants</HI> may thee partake without &s;elf-examination.</NOTE> When they arrive to years of di&s;cre|tion they have a right to a &s;uffrage in the church, in &s;hort, to all the privileges of church members. When they offend, they mu&s;t &s;uffer the di&s;cipline and cen&s;ure of the church; all the&s;e things are nece&s;&s;ary to render our practice conformable to infant member&s;hip. But, as the &s;tate of mankind is and has been, who cannot fore&s;ee the invincible difficulties which this con&s;i&s;tency would introduce. Many excommunications mu&s;t take place yearly, or el&s;e the church would be very &s;oon cor|rupted; yea, the be&s;t of di&s;cipline would not prevent this corruption. Mere morali&s;ts are not chri&s;tians, and the children of the fle&s;h being more numerous, would naturally prevail and carry the &s;uffrage again&s;t the chil|dren of the &s;pirit. I&s;hmael and I&s;aac lived together in the &s;ame family, through all the ages of the Jewi&s;h di&s;|pen&s;ation, but not very peaceably. The child of the fle&s;h mocked and per&s;ecuted the child of the &s;pirit, 'till wrath came on him to the uttermo&s;t. But what &s;aith the &s;cripture 'ca&s;t out the bond-woman and her &s;on;" and keep them out too; if not, if we re-admit them, a quarrel in the family or the corruption of it, will be the certain con&s;equence. Therefore infant member&s;hip. In&s;tead of being a great privilege, as many would have us believe, is a great di&s;advantage to the church&mdash;con|&s;equently
<PB N="16" REF="028518_0009_0FD9324F5B3B3100">to the&s;e infants them&s;elves, when they come to years: and one great rea&s;on why this di&s;advantage don't now appear plainly, is becau&s;e they who practice infant member&s;hip, proceed in a con&s;tant cour&s;e of in|con&s;i&s;tency. Infants are received into the church, and as they grow in years, they grow out of it again. One part of their practice contradicts the other, and &s;o all goes on in peace and quietne&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4. Hence it appears that the Jewi&s;h church was not in all re&s;pects the &s;ame with the gospel church. There &s;eems to have been a &s;ort of per&s;ons in the Jewi&s;h church, which mu&s;t not be received into the go&s;pel church&mdash;Such are infants, who were in covenant and were an holy &s;eed, but they mu&s;t not be received into the go&s;pel church, as already has been &s;hewn. And there is a &s;ort of per|&s;ons admitted by the go&s;pel church, which were not ad|mitted by the Jewi&s;h church, &s;uch are eunuchs, who were never circumci&s;ed, nor allowed to enter into the congregation of the Lord. The olive tree (Rom. xi.) &s;o often oppo&s;ed to what is now advanced, is thus natu|rally explained by Mr. Gla&s;s&mdash;'&s;eeing I&s;rael after the fle&s;h became a people by virtue of the promi&s;e of Chri&s;t to their fathers, as their &s;eed, Chri&s;t that &s;eed, as he &s;tood in that promi&s;e, was the root from whence they grew; and &s;o they became a holy people, according to their natural and fle&s;hly connection with that root. This, the &s;ame root into which the Gentiles are grafted. The Jews could no more have place in the root, but by faith now the promi&s;ed &s;eed was come to ble&s;s the nation, through faith.' Therefore all, who now really &s;tand in the root, &s;tand there by real faith; and all who are vi|&s;ibly in it, are there by vi&s;ible faith; of which, as now proved, infants are incapable. We have further confir|mation of this inference from a pa&s;&s;age in the genuine epi&s;tle of St. Barnabas, written in the apo&s;tolic age.

<P>WE are now come to the &s;econd propo&s;ition. Bap|ti&s;m is in the room of circumci&s;ion. How does this appear? The text commonly made u&s;e of to prove it, is that in Col. ii. 11. "In whom al&s;o ye are circum|ci&s;ed with the circumci&s;ion made without hands, in put|ting off the body of the &s;ins of the fle&s;h, by the circum|ci&s;ion of Chri&s;t." The circumci&s;ion of Chri&s;t, &s;ome &s;ay, means here the water bapti&s;m of Chri&s;tians; but why &s;o? Is there no other way to explain it?&mdash;Yes, there is, and without tautology too. The circumci&s;ion of Chri&s;t rendered him a debtor to keep the whole law. By it he freely obligated him&s;elf to become the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s to very one who believeth. Therefore it may be properly &s;aid that we receive the &s;piritual circumci&s;ion, by the circumci&s;ion of Chri&s;t. Paul here fir&s;t tells us what the chri&s;tian circumci&s;ion is,
<PB N="19" REF="028518_0010_0FD93250CB3DA7B0">made without hands; then he de&s;cribes it more fully, "in putting off the body of the &s;ins of the fle&s;h'; and then he tells us by who&s;e means it is, "by the circum|ci&s;ion of Chri&s;t." Now we find no tautology in all this. The ver&s;e is plain enough, quite ea&s;y to under|&s;tand. It &s;peaks of circumcision, not of water-bapti&s;m; and we had better let it &s;tand as it is, and &s;peak for it|&s;elf. The Bible don't &s;o often &s;peak one thing and mean another, as our errors naturally lead us to ima|gine. But it is &s;aid that chri&s;tians are called 'the cir|cumci&s;ion'. Go then and offer &s;acrifice or &s;omething <HI>in the room of it,</HI> for chri&s;tians are called the prie&s;thood too. If it could be only proved that bapti&s;m &s;ucceeds circumci&s;ion <HI>in all re&s;pects</HI> the inference would be un|deniable that bapti&s;m &s;hould be applied to <HI>&s;ome</HI> infants. But how far is this from being the ca&s;e. Circumci&s;ion rendered them debtors to keep the whole ceremonial law; it was not performed till the eigth day: it was not applied to female children, nor to eunuch children, if their parents were ever &s;o pious. It was the token of a different covenant from that of bapti&s;m, as already has been &s;hewn. Circumci&s;ion was the &s;eal of Abra|ham's faith&mdash;a &s;ure te&s;timony from God that his faith was counted for righteou&s;ne&s;s; that he was a fit per&s;on to be a father of the faithful, circumci&s;ed or uncircum|ci&s;ed. But bapti&s;m is not thus the &s;eal of Abraham's faith, nor of any other man's faith. Now what &s;hall we think of circumci&s;ion and bapti&s;m&mdash;do they look alike? do they re&s;emble one another very much? Sup|po&s;e for a minute that bapti&s;m does &s;ucceed circumci|&s;ion in &s;ome re&s;pects, what warrant have you to baptize infants till the eighth day? What warrant have you to baptize female children? What warrant have you to baptize eunuch children? If bapti&s;m be in the room of circumci&s;ion, why did the apo&s;tles never make u&s;e of it as an argument for the abolition of circumci&s;ion?
