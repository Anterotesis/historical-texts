<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE CANDID READER.</HEAD>
<P>_YOU mu&s;t know, my friend, that I am a gentleman in the country, and by craft a <HI>SHAVER</HI> of very con&s;ide|rable &s;cope; though I have turned preacher of late and &s;eem to be pretty &s;ucce&s;sful at my preachment, as the &s;ole of this &s;ermon will te&s;tify. I have been a great man for the news as we Shavers commonly are, and among other fine papers, I u&s;ually took in the <HI>St. James's Chro|nicle,</HI> a paper that is filled in all the four corners, but if you a&s;k with what: on my word, I mu&s;t refer you to people of greater penetration than I am to find that out. Well I paid, and read to no purpo&s;e for a long while; but at la&s;t I chanced to &s;py An Extract of a Letter from <HI>Oxford,</HI> and I wot it plea&s;ed me mightily.</P>
<P>It told us how that <HI>Six young men were expelled the univer&s;ity for holding Methodi&s;tical tenets, and for praying, reading and ex|pounding the &s;criptures in a private hou&s;e.</HI> Well, thought I, that is well enough: but then I did not &s;o much approve of the principal crime of tho&s;e called Methodi&s;ts, being &s;aid to be reading and expounding the &s;criptures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> thought I, that is going too far. But not long after I happened to &s;ee another account from <HI>Oxford,</HI> wrote by <HI>Oxonien&s;is,</HI> and that account made me re&s;olve upon &s;omething. For he tells us, that one of the Six was formerly a <HI>Publican,</HI> another had been a <HI>Black&s;mith,</HI> a third had been a <HI>Barber,</HI> and a fourth had been a <HI>Teacher</HI> in a <HI>School.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="012104_0003_0F89C469DAE0C490">Well, You mu&s;t know my grandfather was a publican, my uncle a black&s;mith, and I my&s;elf am a &s;haver; which is by interpretation a barber; and my elde&s;t &s;on, a promi&s;ing lad, is de&s;tined for a &s;chool-ma&s;ter. Therefore &s;eeing the honours of our family ca&s;t down into the puddle by the arrogance of <HI>Oxonian</HI> prie&s;ts, I began to grow &s;urly upon it; but did not yet think of preaching. What brought me to that was finding from the learned <HI>Oxonien&s;is,</HI> that tho&s;e young men preached without orders. Then, thought I, I will even have a Trial at it my|&s;elf. Well, you mu&s;t know we have a good &s;ort of a fellow to our par&s;on; a gentleman who loves his bottle and his friend, if it was for a whole night together, and there is never a youth in all the pa|ri&s;h who will &s;ing a merrier catch than him&s;elf, nor tell a prettier &s;tory: with him I am pretty familiar, and I thought I would even borrow his Sunday's &s;tile, and his orthodox plan, knowing him to be a true churchman, and I would try what I could do at preaching. But I had certainly been di&s;appointed in an audience if an happy ima|gination had not befriended me; but no &s;ooner had I be&s;tirred my ima|gination than I was wa&s;ted from <HI>Clarely Common</HI> to the great hall at <HI>O&mdash;d,</HI> before the <HI>V&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> C&mdash;r,</HI> and the Heads of Hou&s;es, to whom, after I had mounted the ro&s;trum with the u&s;ual formality, I preached the following &s;ermon:</P>
<P>Concerning which I would have it ob&s;erved,</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> That I pretend not to ju&s;tify any part of the Methodi&s;ts conduct, be&s;ides praying to God, reading, expounding the &s;criptures, and &s;ing|ing hymns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> That I cen&s;ure none of the clergy, but &s;uch as are again&s;t pray|ing, reading, and expounding the &s;criptures, and &s;inging of hymns.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> That whoever this coat is found to fit, I would have the gentle|man put it on and wear it, as his own: a&s;&s;uring him&s;elf that it was made for him, and that, though a &s;haver, I am his taylor.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4.</HI> That, perhaps, in gratitude for my great pains, and the new hints given in this &s;ermon, which may ca&s;t a light upon eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, the <HI>V&mdash;e C&mdash;r,</HI> and Heads of Hou&s;es, may pre&s;ent me to &s;ome good benefice. And they may depend on it that I &s;hall <HI>&s;have</HI> the pari&s;honers as hand&s;ome as any on 'em.</P>
<P>Thus, reader, I have told you all about it, and have only to add, that after I had at leizure hours wrote my &s;ermon fairly out, I carried it to a book&s;ellor, expecting, that he would be as <HI>fond</HI> of it as I was, which I believe is a <HI>ca&s;e very common</HI> with us authors; but he drew up his &s;houlders, looked &s;our upon it, and &s;aid he feared it was too coar&s;e for this polite age. But I a&s;&s;ured him that the &s;tile was quite clerrical, being borrowed from the pari&s;h prie&s;t; and what he might hear in many pulpits if he would only travel for it; &s;o he agreed to take my word rather than be at the expence and trouble of &s;eeking for fur|ther proof, and it was &s;ent to the pre&s;s to furni&s;h you with half an hour's entertainment, and plea&s;e</P>

<HEAD>A SERMON, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>Having the honour of addre&s;&s;ing &s;o learned a body, with bands &s;o white, gowns &s;o black, and caps &s;o orthodox, I take the liberty of &s;triking a little from the common road of preaching, and as this is a &s;ingular occa&s;ion I &s;hall make free with a &s;ingular text.</P>
<P>You know, my beloved, it is the way of mo&s;t preachers to choo&s;e &s;ome pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture for their text, which hav|ing di&s;tinctly read twice over, you hear no more of the bible till the &s;ermon is fini&s;hed; but are entertained with &s;uch a lecture as you may find in a news-paper, price two-pence half-penny. But I have the honour of departing a little from this general rule, and &s;hall be the fir&s;t who takes his text from a news-paper, and illu&s;trates his doctrine by &s;cripture-hi&s;tory, and having broken the ice, as we u&s;ed to &s;ay, I expect to have many ingenious followers.

<PB N="6" REF="012104_0005_0F89C46B6FEED408">
<HEAD>EXTRACT of a LETTER from OXFORD.</HEAD>
<P>On <HI>Friday</HI> la&s;t &s;ix &s;tudents belonging to <HI>Edmund-Hall</HI> were expelled the univer&s;ity, after an hearing of &s;everal hours, before Mr. Vice-Chancellor, and &s;ome of the Heads of Hou|&s;es for holding Methodi&s;tical tenets, and taking upon them to pray, read, and expound the &s;criptures, and &s;ing hymns in a private hou&s;e. The &mdash; of the &mdash; defended their doctrines from the thirty-nine articles of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, and &s;poke in the highe&s;t terms of the piety, and ex|emplarine&s;s of their lives; but his motion was overuled, and &s;entence pronounced again&s;t them. Dr. &mdash;, one of the Heads of Hou&s;es pre&s;ent, ob&s;erved, that as the&s;e &s;ix gen|tlemen were expelled for having too much religion, it would be very proper to enquire into the conduct of &s;ome who had too little; and Mr. &mdash; was heard to tell their chief ac|cu&s;er that the univer&s;ity was much obliged to him for his good work.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>OUR text is indeed &s;omewhat too long, but then, my be|loved, we have the more matter to work upon: and you know this is a day in which invention is not very bri&s;k, e&s;pecially among the gentlemen clergy. But,</P>
<P>We proceed to pro&s;ecute our &s;ubject after the old ortho|dox plan. Namely,</P>
<P N="1">1. To go over our text by way of explication.</P>
<P N="2">2. Deduce a notable point of doctrine from it, <HI>viz.</HI> That this act of the V&mdash;e C&mdash;r, and the Heads of Hou&s;es, is defen&s;ible from the conduct of the clergy in all ages, and in all countries.</P>
<P N="3">3. Conclude with &s;pecial application.</P>
<P N="1">I. Explain our text. In doing which I mu&s;t divide it in|to very &s;mall parcels, even as the &s;kilfull &s;urgeon does the fle&s;h of a hanged malefactor, when he di&s;&s;ects an organ.&mdash; And in the</P>
<P>Fir&s;t place, <HI>Extract of a Letter from</HI> Oxford.</P>
<P>This <HI>Oxford</HI> my beloved, is a city in the We&s;t of <HI>England</HI> notable for a great univer&s;ity; <HI>i. e.</HI> a place of learning: and it would do you good to &s;ee the numbers of hopeful young gentlemen who come from all parts of <HI>England</HI> in pur&s;uit of learning, in&s;omuch that all the colleges are frequently crowded&punc; But you will &s;ay, What do they learn? To which I an&s;wer in the negative, as being much ea&s;ier than the af|firmative. For it appears from our text that there are &s;ome things which they do not learn.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="7" REF="012104_0006_0F89C46C8049EDC8">(1.) Praying:&mdash;I mean, they do not, in common, learn to pray to God. It &s;eems, this is no part of the approved exerci&s;es of the &s;tudents in that univer&s;ity: for, &s;ays our text, <HI>Six young gentlemen were expelled the univer&s;ity for praying.</HI> From whence we may draw this inference: namely, That if the Vice Chancellor, and the Heads of Hou&s;es, expelled the&s;e &s;ix offenders for praying to God; it is natural to &s;up|po&s;e, that they are not guilty of that crime them&s;elves: o|therwi&s;e, they would fall under that reproof, <HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 1.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) To read and expound the &s;cripture, is another thing which &s;eems to be there prohibited. Whether <HI>Roche&s;ter's Poems, Tri&s;tam Shandy,</HI> and &s;uch books are e&s;teemed ortho|dox, and therefore tolerated, I pretend not to &s;ay; but one thing is clear from our text, that reading and expounding the &s;criptures is again&s;t the <HI>Oxonian</HI> law: for <HI>Six young gentlemen were expelled the univer&s;ity for reading and ex|pounding the &s;criptures.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3.) Singing of hymns is another thing which they do not learn: this is al&s;o clear from the words. By &s;inging of hymns, I mean prai&s;ing of God for ble&s;&s;ings received according to <HI>Col.</HI> iii. 16. <HI>Let the word of Chri&s;t dwell in you richly in all wi&s;dom, teaching and admoni&s;hing one ano|ther in p&s;alms, and hymns, and &s;piritual &s;ongs, &s;inging with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</HI> But &s;inging of p&s;alms, and hymns, and &s;piritual &s;ongs, cannot be connived at in the univer&s;ity, by the Heads of Hou&s;es; for <HI>Six young men were expelled the univer&s;ity for &s;inging of hymns.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> This was an extract of a <HI>Letter</HI> from <HI>Oxford:</HI> which &s;hews, that there be &s;ome people there who <HI>can</HI> write, notwith&s;tanding all the reflections that have pa&s;t upon them; and that although reading is dangerous there, yet an <HI>Oxonian</HI> may write with impunity.</P>
<P N="2">II. La&s;t <HI>Friday:</HI>&mdash; the better day, the better deed. <HI>Friday,</HI> you know, is a fa&s;t-day; on which it was fitte&s;t to go about a work of this importance; when the judgment was not fettered with bodily gro&s;&s;ne&s;s, but purged by an empty belly.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;t Friday:</HI> It was not a thing that happened in the dark ages of <HI>Monli&s;h Ignorance,</HI> but what has happened in this <HI>enlightened age of</HI> CHRISTIANITY. It was not when the univer&s;ity was tied hand and foot by <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> prejudices, and the Heads of Hou&s;es were obliged to &s;ubmit to their betters;
<PB N="8" REF="012104_0007_0F89C46CE9734078">
but it was <HI>La&s;t Friday,</HI> the act and deed of <HI>Prote&s;tant Di|vines.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Six Students!</HI>&mdash; What a miracle was it, my be|loved, that, out of &s;o many hundreds of &s;tudents, as are at <HI>Oxford,</HI> only Six &s;hould be found guilty of praying reading and expounding the &s;criptures. This &s;hews the faithfulne&s;s of their vigilant tutors, in guarding them again&s;t &s;uch per|nicious practices. Now from this, ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. That there were but Six &s;tudents of all the univer&s;ity, who could be detected in tho&s;e evils of praying, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> much to the honour of that learned body.</P>
<P N="2">2. That tho&s;e Six being expelled;&mdash;now there are none left in all the colleges who take upon them to pray, read and expound the &s;criptures:&mdash;therefore, gentlemen may with &s;afety &s;end their &s;ons to that fountain of learning, without fearing that they will become religious;&mdash;there being none left <HI>now</HI> to en&s;nare them.</P>
<P N="4">IV. They all belonging to <HI>Edmund Hall.</HI>&mdash;It &s;eems they loved to be together: from whence it may be gathered that they loved one another. A fault which the Heathens accu&s;ed the Chri&s;tians of old with, but from which mankind in general are now pretty free. It appears as if this <HI>Edmund-Hall</HI> was the only place at <HI>Oxford</HI> in which praying people were to be &s;ound. But it is hoped that the governors of that Hall will be mulct for their carle&s;&s;ne&s;s in &s;uffering the &s;tudents to read the bible and to enquire after religion, &s;ee|ing it is contrary to the &s;en&s;e of this univer&s;ity.</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>Were expelled the univer&s;ity.</HI> Deprived of the rights and privileges of the king's loving &s;ubjects, or as the word &s;ignifies, they were drove out, forced away, and bani&s;hed from the univer&s;ity. This religions act was performed by the Vice Chancellor after an hearing of &s;everal hours. I re|member when bi&s;hop <HI>Hooper</HI> was &s;ent for by queen <HI>Mary,</HI> the pious bi&s;hop of <HI>London;</HI> and my Lord Chancellor being determined to have him burnt; but yet to make a &s;hew of ju&s;tice they would give him a hearing, withall re&s;olving not to &s;werve from their bloody de&s;ign. So in like manner, our venerable tutors were determined not to &s;uffer <HI>praying per&s;ons</HI> to breathe the univer&s;ity air; yet, being tied to form, they would give them an hearing.</P>
<P><HI>An hearing of &s;everal hours.</HI>&mdash;Ah! my beloved, ye may &s;ee how remarkably the &s;criptures are fulfilled in that
<PB N="9" REF="012104_0008_0F89C47021C1BD28">
learned body of divines; where it &s;ays, <HI>Hear ye indeed but under&s;tand not, &s;ee ye indeed but perceive not.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. We come to the crime for which they were expelled the univer&s;ity: and I wot it was an heinous crime indeed. This would appear without illu&s;trating it from the Charac|ter of the expellers; namely, Mr. Vice Chancellor, and the Head of Hou&s;es. But as I love to remove every hillock out of the way, for your better information, I &s;hall explain it. What was their crime then, my beloved, think you? Was it drinking? No, no, it was not drinking, <HI>for they were very temperate.</HI> Was it whoring then, the common practice of many &s;tudents? No, it was not whoring neither; for their lives are &s;aid to have been very exemplary. I wi&s;h, my be|loved, it had been no wor&s;e. But what was it then? Was it &s;wearing, and fighting, and abu&s;ing their fellow &s;tudents? No, for they &s;hunned the other &s;tudents, as a wi&s;e man will <HI>&s;hun an attorney:</HI> thus much may be gathered from our text, which intimates, <HI>that they met together among them&s;elves.</HI> But it was <HI>praying: that,</HI> my beloved, was one part of their crime, <HI>Six young men were expelled the Univer&s;ity for pray|ing.</HI> For Mr. V&mdash;e C&mdash;r and the Heads of Hou&s;es will &s;uf|fer no praying people to continue in the univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>Reading and expounding the &s;criptures was another part of their crime. But what in the name of the Pope, can &s;tu|dents have to do with the &s;criptures? What pity is it that the bible is not locked up in the Vatican. But letting that pa&s;s, we find that learning to expound the &s;criptures is no part of the employment of the &s;tudents, <HI>Six young men being expelled the univer&s;ity for reading and expounding the &s;crip|tures.</HI></P>
<P>What added to their guilt was, that they carried their religion to a <HI>private hou&s;e.</HI> But what can <HI>private</HI> people have to do with religion, ought not they to do, as their fore|fathers did; namely, give up their con&s;ciences and under|&s;tandings to the guidance of their venerable prie&s;t? Is it not enough that gentlemen in black know, &amp; under&s;tand religi|on, but every private per&s;on mu&s;t be dabbling in it contrary to the &s;en&s;e of this univer&s;ity? I wot, my beloved, that the clergy cannot thrive as they do, if every private hou&s;e mu&s;t become a wor&s;hipping temple; but it is tho't there is little rea&s;on to fear this, &s;eeing our text informs us that the doc|tors of the univer&s;ity are determined to prevent it, for <HI>Six
<PB N="10" REF="012104_0009_0F89C471CFFCF8C8">
young men were expelled the Univer&s;ity for being religious in a private hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. Another part of their crime was that they <HI>held Me|thodi&s;tical tenets.</HI> This &s;ame methodi&s;t, my beloved, is a cramp word, gathered out of old books, by men of learning, and applied to &s;uch who pray, read, and expound the &s;crip|ture, and &s;ing hymns in private hou&s;es. A people never to be tolerated by the clergy. You'll ob&s;erve, that this &s;ame hard word, which the nation has long rung with, fir&s;t of all was given to the &s;ons of E&s;culapius as a name of honour, and about thirty years ago, was by learned men rai&s;ed up as the witch of Endor (who &s;eems to have been a clergy woman too) rai&s;ed the gho&s;t of old Samuel.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e &s;ame &s;ons of E&s;culapius were phy&s;icians, &s;urgeons, and apothecaries in their day, but then they were quite im|methodical, like the greater part of the old women in black prunella &amp; white cambrick. For in&s;tance they had not the method of wearing large whigs, gold headed canes, and of wheeling about the &s;treets in their chariots. And with re|&s;pect to their phy&s;ic and &s;urgery, they were guided chiefly by the dictates of nature without the ab&s;tru&s;e methods of art. At la&s;t there aro&s;e a great man and his name was <HI>Galen,</HI> a mighty man for di&s;&s;ecting of apes; for it ought to be ob|&s;erved, that in his days in Pagan lands, there were very few criminals who de&s;erved death, and fewer &s;till who were gi|ven to the &s;urgeons. Well what &s;hould he do, think you; why, my beloved, being ble&s;t with better &s;tars at his nativi|ty, than his predece&s;&s;ors, he took their confu&s;ed &amp; immetho|dical practices &amp; reduced them into method <HI>i. e.</HI> form and order. Well, this great man being principal of the College of Phy&s;icians, he taught his pupils to ob&s;erve orderly rules, otherwi&s;e <HI>method,</HI> from whence his di&s;ciples were in honour called Methodi&s;ts. So much for learning, now for doctrine.</P>
<P>Then my beloved the ca&s;e &s;tands thus; among&s;t the cler|gy there always have been a great number who did not love praying, &s;inging of hymns, reading and expounding the &s;criptures, the like may be &s;aid of the &s;tudents. What they aimed at was a good living without much work, and as one in a certain place &s;ays, <HI>Tho&s;e men care not if the Devil take the flock provided they can but get the fleece.</HI> On the other hand, there have been &s;ome who loved to pray, to &s;ing hymns, to read and expound the &s;criptures, who if they were
<PB N="11" REF="012104_0010_0F89C472D6AE4258">
not permitted to do it in public hou&s;es or churches, would do it in private hou&s;es to the no &s;mall di&s;grace of the other gentlemen. Well, my beloved, the&s;e are they who have been called methodi&s;ts, fanatics and enthu&s;ia&s;ts. Now a word or two about their tenets, and then I di&s;mi&s;s this head, for really their tenets, being de&s;tructive of prie&s;tcraft, mu&s;t by no means be encouraged.</P>
<P N="1">1. Fir&s;t, and foremo&s;t, they think that a man ought to atte&s;t no articles of faith, but what he believes to be true.</P>
<P N="2">2. They think that a man ought not to profe&s;s to my Lord bi&s;hop that he believes all the thirty nine articles of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church to be the true faith of the go&s;pel when he &s;ecretly believes in his heart that they are fal&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. They think that a man &s;hould not profe&s;s to his lord&s;hip, that he is moved by the holy gho&s;t to de&s;ire the office of a deacon, when he con&s;iders it in his heart as de|lu&s;ion and enthu&s;ia&s;m for any man to pretend to be moved by the holy gho&s;t in the&s;e days.</P>
<P N="4">4. They think that after a man has &s;ub&s;cribed the thirty nine articles, and &s;olemnly &s;wore that he believes them, that he &s;hould not go and preach doctrines directly oppo&s;ite to the &s;aid articles.</P>
<P N="5">5. They think that no man ought to be permitted to enter the pulpit who&s;e life and conver&s;ation is <HI>di&s;&s;olute.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e with a great many tenets be&s;ides equally ridicu|lous to maintain, and therefore, though tolerated by the king and parliament, the Heads of Hou&s;es will never en|dure them in the univer&s;ity.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. <HI>The&mdash;of the&mdash;defended their doctrines by the thirty-nine articles of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church.</HI></P>
<P>I wot, I fear me much, that this doctor is him&s;elf tinc|tured with methodi&s;tical tenets; for no body now a-days be&s;ides methodi&s;ts, &amp;c. con&s;ider the thirty-nine articles of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church as any te&s;t of doctrine: as for the clergy it is well known that they are mo&s;tly <HI>di&s;&s;enters</HI> from the doctrine of the articles and prayerbook. Ah! beloved, if the truth was known, it would be found that this &s;ame&mdash; prays to God, and reads his bible, or how el&s;e &s;hould he take part with tho&s;e young men whom the Heads of Hou&s;es expelled the univer&s;ity <HI>for praying, reading &amp; expounding the &s;criptures.</HI> Be&s;ides he would not have &s;poken &s;o high|ly of their piety &amp; the exemplarine&s;s of their lives as the

text tells us he did, &s;eeing the &s;en&s;e of the univer&s;ity was, that their praying, reading, &amp;c. was vicious. I fear me, my beloved, that if the Heads of Hou&s;es do not keep a good <HI>look out</HI> after this &s;ame doctor, it will be difficult for them to keep the univer&s;ity clear from &s;uch as pray, and read, and expound the &s;criptures; but <HI>his motion was overruled.</HI> What is one methodi&s;t among a ho&s;t of divines?</P>
<P>Thus, my beloved, I have gone through the fir&s;t part of my plan, and &s;hall proceed to the &s;econd.</P>
<P N="2">II. Namely, to rai&s;e a notable point of doctrine from it; which is this, viz. That the conduct of the Heads of the Hou&s;es, in expelling the &s;ix young men from praying, reading, and expounding the &s;criptures, is defen&s;ible from the conduct of the clergy of all ages and countries, what&s;o|ever &s;narling per&s;ons may &s;ay.</P>
<P>To clear this I &s;hall produce four in&s;tances, all of which I &s;hall take out of that old antiquated book called the &s;cripture. A book which &s;ets forth the true &s;pirit of the univer&s;ity doctors to the very life. The</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Of which in&s;tances we have in the book of Daniel, chap. iii. wherein &s;ome tran&s;actions of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church at Babylon are recorded; concerning which I would make the following notes:</P>
<P N="1">I. That the religion, by law e&s;tabli&s;hed was the religi|on of the golden image which Nebuchadnezzar, at the re|que&s;t of the clergy, made and &s;et up in the plains of Dura. A place, my beloved, which, if we may give credit to tra|vellers, very much re&s;embles the plains of Oxford.</P>
<P N="2">II. The clergy, who you know have always been won|derfully fond of a <HI>golden god,</HI> would by no means &s;uffer an act of toleration to be pa&s;&s;ed in favour of methodi&s;ts and di&s;&s;enters; but on the contrary, got an act of parliament on their own &s;ide, enjoining the &s;tricte&s;t uniformity in reli|gion, and threatening death to all di&s;&s;enters: for it &s;eems this prince was too ea&s;y and like &s;ome of our former princes in England, was &s;o much afraid of the clergy, that he was obliged to conform, and &s;o e&s;pou&s;ed an act of uniformity, which they hoped would bring good gri&s;t to their mill, ver&s;. 6.</P>
<P N="3">III. This law e&s;tabli&s;hed, the clergy were impatient to have the &s;ubjects of this great king brought to the te&s;t: which they thought be&s;t to do by appointing a public fea&s;t;
<PB N="13" REF="012104_0012_0F89C47441BA8528">
on which it was required that every man, and mother's &s;on &s;hould fall down before, and wor&s;hip this golden god &s;et up by the king, as the tool of the par&s;ons.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That there were four degrees of learned men, whom, I &s;uppo&s;e dwelt in the univer&s;ity at Babylon: fir&s;t, there were <HI>magicians,</HI> who were with them, the &s;ame as doctors of divinity are with us in our univer&s;ities: &s;econdly, there were <HI>a&s;trologers,</HI> or men of learned &s;ciences, much the &s;ame with our ma&s;ters of arts: thirdly, there were <HI>&s;orcerers,</HI> who I &s;uppo&s;e, were either fellows of the college, or batchelors of arts, appointed to be tythe gatherers; and, fourthly, there were chaldeans or &s;tudents of their divinity, and other fine arts: and,</P>
<P N="5">V. That all tho&s;e gentry were very vigilant in di&s;cover|ing and informing again&s;t di&s;&s;enters, ver&s;e 8. <HI>Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near and accu&s;ed the Jews.</HI> That is to &s;ay, certain young &s;tudents, being &s;purred on to it by their tutors who care not to appear in &s;uch a dirty affair them&s;elves, and &s;o forth.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Strict as the law was, there were &s;ome who took upon them to pray to God, like tho&s;e &s;ix young gentlemen who were expelled the univer&s;ity for praying. But what were they think you? why truly, they were d&s;&s;enters and metho|di&s;ts, for they would not conform to the form of wor&s;hip by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, therefore were di&s;&s;enters; and they were me|thodi&s;ts, if praying to God denominates a man a methodi&s;t. But what followed, trow ye? why, as &s;oon as they were found out to be non-conformi&s;ts, the doctors of divinity ac|cu&s;ed them of rebellion; and had the king been as fond of burning di&s;&s;enters, as their reverences were, the&s;e men had in a trice been executed, without having another chance for their lives: But he was not quite &s;o fiery, but gave them another trial. If you'll read the chapter through you'll &s;ee the up&s;hot of it, and how the doctors of the univer&s;ity were confounded, and the di&s;&s;enters were readmitted to the king's favour, for God did work for them.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s on to the days of <HI>Darius:</HI> a prince who had a praying nobelman for his fir&s;t mini&s;ter of &s;tate, and, for ought I know to the contrary, he might be lord of the trea&s;ury, as well as the chancellor of the empire. His name was Daniel, and by birth a Jew. Well, my beloved, being &s;o very great, he was grievou&s;ly envied, by the
<PB N="14" REF="012104_0013_0F89C474F8220E60">
inferior placemen, though they kept it &s;ecret, and &s;poke him fair to his face; and he was very much abu&s;ed by tho&s;e who were out of place. If we may judge of ancient times from what appears in ages more modern, we may &s;uppo&s;e that the times took a turn &s;omething like the following.</P>
<P>One man cries out again&s;t his being a favourite, and too intimate with the queen or queen's mother, as their kin&s;men do upon &s;imilar occa&s;ion; another complains of his being a foreigner, and a captive, &s;o highly dignified, whil&s;t the natives were neglected: perhaps their news-papers might be &s;tuffed with clamours again&s;t the exotic favourite; and the incen&s;ed mob might be taught to cry out, liberty and Babylon for ever&mdash;but no Jew&mdash;no favourite&mdash;no captive. Well, my beloved, all the <HI>inns</HI> and <HI>outs</HI> might have fretted them&s;elves to death, without being able to do any thing again&s;t this prime mini&s;ter, this &s;ame Daniel, the king's favourite, if they had not applied to the principal clergy, the Heads of Hou&s;es. But I trow, the reverend doctors, the magicians, the ma&s;ters of the art of a&s;trology, &amp;c. &amp;c. no &s;ooner embarked in the popular cau&s;e but they were more than a match for the favourite, who had fallen by means of their reverences, if the Almighty had as little to do with him, as he has to do with the greate&s;t part of the clergy.</P>
<P>Well, my beloved, the Heads of Hou&s;es and the di&s;affected &s;tate&s;men met altogether, and con&s;ulted what was the be&s;t way to overturn the &s;tate of this praying favourite. But the conduct of Daniel was &s;o exemplary, that they knew they &s;hould be able to find nothing wrong in him, unle&s;s they could entrap him in matters of religion. Therefore having fir&s;t per&s;uaded the king, that <HI>the church was in dan|ger,</HI> they urged the nece&s;&s;ity of a law being made, pro|hibiting any man's praying unto God. Well, <HI>Darius</HI> the king, was not &s;uch a novice in politics but he knew the nece&s;&s;ity of having the clergy on his &s;ide, and therefore though he could not &s;ee into that part of their my&s;terious divinity, made the decree according to the plan concerted by that learned body.</P>
<P>But it is thought that he would have &s;trained a point with them, if he had known that they were aiming at the life of his faithful favourite.</P>
<P>But how &s;tiff the&s;e bibli&s;ts are? for this Daniel went on praying to God, reading and expounding the &s;criptures <HI>in
<PB N="15" REF="012104_0014_0F89C475B62EB270">
a private hou&s;e,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the king had under the direction of the clergy ordained otherwi&s;e; this was enough to have provoked the <HI>Heads of Hou&s;es to have ex|pelled him the Univer&s;ity</HI> had he belonged to it, but he not belonging to it, they were obliged to be &s;atisfied with put|ting him to death without expelling him.</P>
<P>Now le&s;t any &s;hould object to the clergy having the honour of devi&s;ing this &s;cheme, becau&s;e there is no notice taken of them in hi&s;tory; let it be ob&s;erved, that it was never known that many great men or noblemen were ever given to inter|fere in religious matters, and &s;tate&s;men in all ages have been wi&s;e enough to take up with the religion which the prie&s;ts have pre&s;cribed to them, therefore what you give of honour to any body in this affair, let it be given to the clergy. And I pa&s;s on to make a compari&s;on betwixt that affair and this before us.</P>
<P N="1">I. They could find no occa&s;ion of fault in Daniel; &s;o it was with the &s;ix young men who were expelled the Uni|ver&s;ity, for their lives were &s;aid to be pious and exemplary.</P>
<P N="2">II. They thought they might entrap him in &s;ome mat|ters concerning the law of his God. So likewi&s;e, the&s;e young men though they were no whore&s;ters, no gamblers, no drunkards, &amp;c. yet they could be trapped in matters relating to their God.</P>
<P N="3">III. This &s;ame Daniel notwith&s;tanding the penalty de|nounced in the edict again&s;t any who &s;hould take upon them to pray to God, perver&s;ely, rebelliou&s;ly, and ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in his u&s;ual apo&s;tolical, puritannical, nonconform|i&s;tical and methodi&s;tical manner of praying to God in a private hou&s;e. So no doubt but the&s;e &s;ix young men knew that it was again&s;t the will of the Heads of Hou&s;es, &amp;c. that any of the &s;tudents under their care &s;hould pray to God in a private hou&s;e; for &s;ays our text, <HI>Six young men were ex|pelled the Univer&s;ity, for praying, reading, and expounding the &s;criptures in a private hou&s;e;</HI> yet they per&s;i&s;ted in it.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, under this head. Daniel pre&s;ident of the princes, kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed and gave thanks before his God as aforetime. But how will you be able to find &s;uch puritanic conduct among our Briti&s;h noblemen: for I wot that a praying nobleman is pretty near as great a rarity as a white crow upon Malvern hills. The</P>
<P N="2">II. In&s;tance of clerical conduct which gives countenance
<PB N="16" REF="012104_0015_0F89C47689A50A38">
to the late act of the Heads of Hou&s;es I &s;hall bring from the clergy of that famous univer&s;ity at Jeru&s;alem, in the days of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. In the e&s;tabli&s;hed church of Judea there were articles of faith and a canon law, which all the clergy profe&s;t to believe, regard and defend. This confe&s;&s;ion of faith was fir&s;t compiled by Mo&s;es the founder of that church, and afterwards ratified and confirmed by Ezra and Nehemiah, their two principal reformers; even as the thirty nine articles of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church were ratified and confirmed by our Engli&s;h reformers. I know you'll be ready to think that the clergy deemed it an honour to tread in the &s;teps of tho&s;e pious reformers; but I trow, my beloved, ye are greatly mi&s;taken; for the <HI>Heads of Hou&s;es</HI> of the univer&s;ity at Jeru&s;alem, even did as many others have done &s;ince, make the commandment void to e&s;tabli&s;h their own traditions. Perhaps you will be ready to &s;tartle like the cows in July, when bit by the envious flies, when ye hear of a univer&s;ity at Jeru&s;alem: but I a&s;&s;ure you, it was there that the doctors (i. e. teachers) of the law dwelt, and their law was their divinity. Now, where do the neighbour|ing dogs delight to re&s;ort &s;o much as to a place were the carca&s;e is, or where &s;hall we &s;ee &s;uch &s;warms of reverend doctors as at the univer&s;ity. Tho&s;e phari&s;ees, tho&s;e law|yers, tho&s;e &s;cribes, and tho&s;e doctors were all gown&s;men, but whether they wore the very &s;ame uniforms with the gentlemen of Oxford univer&s;ity, my author does not &s;ay. Yet thus much may be gathered from the hi&s;tory, that if that wandering Jew who they &s;ay has lived ever &s;ince the times I am &s;peaking of, &s;hould chance in his travels to call at Oxford, he would think upon his longevity that from the manners of the men it was old Jeru&s;alem ri&s;en again from its ruins. But we will drop this, and come to the matter in hand, which is to give a ju&s;t account of tho&s;e clergy, that you may &s;ee that the heads of hou&s;es have not depart|ed a jot from the rules of their clerical ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>The Jeru&s;alem clergy finding that their living depended upon &s;ub&s;cribing the articles given by Mo&s;es, and the homilies compiled by the prophets; they could for the &s;ake of a venerable reputation, and a fatti&s;h living, or, as ye would &s;ay, <HI>for the good of the church,</HI> very readily &s;ub&s;cribe, and atte&s;t them upon oath, though many of them, called &s;ad|ducees, did not believe any thing about them. Now not
<PB N="17" REF="012104_0016_0F89C47828D04DA0">
to take notice of the vulgar opinion, namely, that there are a great many &s;adducees in our univer&s;ities; I cannot but ob&s;erve the weakne&s;s of tho&s;e who blame &s;uch of the clergy who &s;wear to articles they do not believe, &s;eeing that was the practice of the clergy of the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed church that was in the world.</P>
<P>About &s;omething more then 1700 years &s;ince, there aro&s;e &s;ome di&s;&s;enters who made a great &s;tir among the people, and brought great unea&s;ine&s;s upon the clergy. I do not mean that tho&s;e were di&s;&s;enters from the articles of faith which was of old given to the &s;aints; but they were di&s;&s;enters from the clergy, and did not &s;pare to detect their errors, both in principles and practice; a practice which our mo|dern methodi&s;ts are &s;aid to be guilty of, to the great con|cern of the Heads of Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e were laymen, not regularly educated at the uni|ver&s;ity, and who took upon them to preach without receiv|ing authority from the archbi&s;hop of Jeru&s;alem; I think his name was Caiaphas, and I wot he was primate of all Judea. Well, tho&s;e men were not only laymen, but the riff-raff of them, even fi&s;hermen: note, they were not attorneys or merchants clerks; nor were they chymi&s;ts, nor apothecaries, but fi&s;hermen. And yet they preached, and yet they ex|pounded the &s;criptures, to the great confu&s;ion of the holy trade of prie&s;tcraft. The e&s;tabli&s;hed church was now thought to be in danger. And how it could be thought &s;o was &s;omething &s;trange, &s;eeing tho&s;e praying and preaching di&s;&s;enters proved all their doctrine from the articles and homilies given by Mo&s;es and the prophets, the &s;ame as our modern methodi&s;ts prove their doctrines from the articles and homilies of the church of England; and the church of England has been thought in no &s;mall danger from the&s;e &s;ame methodi&s;ts, upon grounds equally &s;ub&s;tantial. Believe me my beloved, the reverend, the learned, the zealous doc|tor Sacheveral, was not the fir&s;t nor the la&s;t, who was grieved for fear of the church. But he is dead and gone, therefore I return to the clergy at Jeru&s;alem; and ye can|not but remember how active they were in procuring the de&s;truction of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and when he was ri&s;en from the dead and a&s;cended into glory, they abated nothing of their zeal for their e&s;tabli&s;hed church.</P>
<P>For no &s;ooner were they aware of the power of the apo&s;tles
<PB N="18" REF="012104_0017_0F89C478B9A4E988">
doctrine, (by apo&s;tles I mean tho&s;e who took upon them to pray, read, and expound the &s;criptures in private hou&s;es, as you may &s;ee in the &s;ub&s;equent part of the hi&s;tory) as the&s;e &s;ix young men who were expelled the univer&s;ity are &s;aid to have done. Seeing, I &s;ay, their extraordinary fervour in preaching, they cried out again&s;t them as per&s;ons drunk with new wine, by which we may under&s;tand <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI> Acts ii. 13 Well, my beloved, this is the very cry of the clergy again&s;t all &s;uch as preach Je&s;us and the re&s;urrection, and from their mouths the vulgar catch the &s;ound; &s;o that with many, a methodi&s;t, an enthu&s;ia&s;t, a di&s;&s;enter, and a fanatick, are thought to be &s;ynonimous terms. From hence we may learn that &s;lander may as well be thrown in a &s;ermon as in a farce, and will i&s;&s;ue with as good a grace from a pulpit as from a theatre. But no more of this, becau&s;e our time draws towards the other end.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable how zealous tho&s;e of the gentlemen of the gown, who aimed no higher than a good fat benefice, have always &s;hewed them&s;elves when the doctrine of Chri&s;t in its &s;implicity hath been preached; for why? truly be|cau&s;e it lays the ax to the root of the tree of prie&s;tcraft, and throws down the importance of the par&s;on into the dirt. If the clergy were all to ob&s;erve the rules given by Chri&s;t to his di&s;ciples in his &s;ermon upon the mount, where would be all their riches and grandeur, their coaches, their livery|men, and their plate? But ye know, that the&s;e rules are different from this craft, whereby we par&s;ons get our wealth, as heaven is different from hell. But as prie&s;tcraft is lucra|tive, it will be &s;ure to find &s;upporters, whil&s;t the hou&s;es have got one head left upon them.</P>
<P>In Acts v. we find that Peter and the re&s;t of his praying, reading, and &s;cripture-expounding brethren, were brought before the Vice Chancellor and the Heads of Hou&s;es for a hearing, and after a hearing of &s;everal hours they took coun|&s;el to &s;lay them, v. 33. But there was one Gamaliel, the head of a certain hou&s;e who &s;ided with them, and probably proved their doctrine from the articles of the Jewi&s;h church as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. I trow this &s;ame Gamaliel was tinctur|ed with the doctrine they preached, as&mdash;of&mdash;who defend|ed the faith of the &s;ix young men who were expelled the uni|ver&s;ity of&mdash;for praying, &amp;c. may be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ecretly to have
<PB N="19" REF="012104_0018_0F89C479869EEA70">
believed in the articles which he once &s;ub&s;cribed, though he dared not to avow his faith openly.</P>
<P>There is one thing in the account that is &s;omething re|markable, namely, the wi&s;e motion of doctor Gamaliel over|ruled the bloody de&s;igns of the prie&s;ts; but it was not &s;o at the other univer&s;ity, for altho' &mdash; of &mdash; defended and proved the methodi&s;tical doctrine from the articles of the church, and &s;poke highly of the piety and exemplarine&s;s of their lives, his motion was over-ruled and the &s;ix young men were expelled.</P>
<P>Another thing we may take notice of, namely, tho&s;e an|cient doctors had a law by which they could put people to death for praying, reading, &amp; expounding the &s;criptures; but our univer&s;ities have no &s;uch law, or it is no way doubt|ful but that the &s;ame zeal which will, under a prote&s;tant government, expel the &s;tudents of the univer&s;ity for praying &amp;c. would, for the &s;ame rea&s;ons, burn offenders at a &s;take, were they favoured with a popi&s;h king. So that if the Heads of Hou&s;es were le&s;s bloody in their de&s;igns than their ance&s;tors, it is not to imputed to want of good-will, but to the prote&s;tant re&s;traints which they are under.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s, my beloved, to point out all the in|&s;tances in which the Jewi&s;h, and the &mdash; clergy agree; I &s;hall therefore leave them to another occa&s;ion, and &s;hall pa&s;s on to another very famous church, in that part of the world and after that I &s;hall come nearer home, within our own ken. And,</P>
<P N="3">III. This famous church was the church of Diana, at Ephe&s;us; and I wot, in this church there was many a good living in the gift of the univer&s;ity, and I trow, that the Heads of Hou&s;es were very careful that none &s;hould enjoy one of them unle&s;s he was well known to be a true &s;on of the church, that is to &s;ay, a promoter of the &s;ale of the &s;hrines of Diana, and a wor&s;hipper of the image that fell down from Jupiter.</P>
<P>This Diana was in her day, a lady remarkable for hunt|ing of &s;tags, and ever &s;ince, her clergy have been as remar|kable for the hunting of (not &s;tags but) a good benefice. Now&punc; my beloved, this &s;ame huntre&s;s was the per&s;onage wor&s;hipped by mo&s;t people of A&s;ia, and &s;he had many, very many clergy, who adored her for the &s;ake of gain: <HI>for by this craft we have our wealth,</HI> &s;aid they.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="012104_0019_0F89C47A3596BC18">There was a famous univer&s;ity for the training up of young gentlemen in the holy craft of making &s;hrines for the godde&s;s, and a lucrative craft they found it my beloved, for they had it in their power to &s;ell a brazen &s;hrine for a golden prize; a thing which others be&s;ides them practice.</P>
<P>This univer&s;ity was at Ephe&s;us, a very populous city, where water was cheap, but fire very dear; and here were many colleges and halls for the training up of young men in the craft of <HI>getting wealth.</HI> Every hall had a Head, and over all the Heads of Hou&s;es was a Vice Chancellor, the rev. Dr. Demetrius by name. As for praying, reading, &amp; ex|pounding the &s;criptures they meddled not with them, but were to the highe&s;t degree, intent upon getting wealth.</P>
<P>Well, they carried on this craft for many years, till at la&s;t there came &s;ome itinerant preachers to town, who made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to pray to God, to read, and expound the &s;criptures, and &s;ing hymns in private hou&s;es, contrary to the &s;en&s;e of that univer&s;ity. This was no &s;mall mortification to the clergy who very well knew that if real religion, or praying, reading, and expounding the &s;criptures was tolerat|ed, that it would put an end to their lucrative prie&s;tcraft, and their reverences would fall into di&s;grace. But to prevent &s;uch a cata&s;trophe the reverend Dr. Demetrius, Vice Chan|cellor, a&s;&s;embled the Heads of Hou&s;es to con&s;ult what was be&s;t to be done; and it was re&s;olved <HI>nemine contradicente,</HI> to cry out, <HI>the church was in danger,</HI> that under pretence of &s;aving this church, they might &s;ave their own profits. Well, they cried out, that <HI>the church was in danger,</HI> that <HI>the church was in danger,</HI> till they had &s;ufficiently inflamed the rabble, then they laid hold on the itinerants, had them before the Heads of Hou&s;es, who gave them &s;uch treatment as praying people may expect to meet with from the clergy of the&mdash;. It happened however, as in a late ca&s;e, that there was one man of integrity and honour among&s;t them, much like the Head of &mdash; Hall, only with this difference, the one was a Notary-public, and the other is a gentleman in holy orders. Well, this attorney it &s;eems being recorder of the city, thought that the clergy carried their authority a little beyond the rules of moderation and decency, a thing by no means uncommon for &s;ome gentlemen of the cap and gown. This town-clerk took up the cau&s;e of his itinerants, and in a &s;pirited, &s;en&s;ible manner, defended their
<PB N="21" REF="012104_0020_0F89C47D93CFEE10">
conduct and tenets, not from the thirty-nine articles but from the articles of natural religion and morality, and &s;pake very highly of their piety and good behaviour. I cannot but remark that in this affair the town-clerk was more &s;ucce&s;sful than the gentlemen who pleaded the cau&s;e of the &s;ix methodi&s;ts at Oxford; the former over-ruled the purpo&s;es of Diana's clergy; but the univer&s;ity clergy over ruled the motion of the latter, according to our text: for though he defended their doctrine from the thirty-nine articles of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, and &s;poke very highly of their piety and the exemplarine&s;s of their lives, <HI>the&s;e &s;ix young men were expelled the univer&s;ity for praying, reading, and expounding the &s;criptures, and for &s;inging hymns in a private hou&s;e.</HI> For why? why truly, my beloved, becau&s;e praying, reading, and expounding the &s;criptures is not the craft by which we get our wealth. For proof of this pro|po&s;ition I refer you to &s;tubborn facts; namely, that you &s;hall &s;eldom &s;ee a divine who makes a point of praying, reading, and expounding the &s;criptures, and of &s;inging hymns in private or public hou&s;es, who keep their equipage, or po&s;&s;e&s;s your fat livings. I wot, my beloved, that one drone eats more honey than four laborious bees; for proof of this I re|fer you to the reverend Dr. Pliny, an author of approved merit and a great divine.</P>
<P>But I pa&s;s on to the fourth e&s;tabli&s;hed church the clergy of which, in all re&s;pects, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;pirit of univer&s;ity di|vines, or Heads of Hou&s;es; and I trow, it is a church of great preten&s;ions, the clergy of which are as infallible as the mo&s;t holy mother pope Joan that lady, who was Chri&s;t's vicar, and Peter's &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and carried the keys of heaven, hell, and purgatory in her pocket, when &s;he was in her prime, and her moon &s;hone at full. I gue&s;s by this time you know that I mean the good old, one catholic, roman, infal|lible, pontifical, univer&s;al, mother church, in the bo&s;om of which our fore-fathers of the &s;urcingle &s;lept &s;o &s;nug, wrapt about with abbey lands as with warm blankets. And if I may &s;peak the &s;entiments of my &s;able brethren of the univer&s;ity, we wi&s;h for the &s;ake of tho&s;e lands, that we were all &s;afe rolling in her bo&s;om once more. But I will not keep you in &s;u&s;pen&s;e about this.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Church the conduct of who&s;e clergy was &s;o near a kin to the conduct of the clergy of &mdash;. In the days of
<PB N="22" REF="012104_0021_0F89C47F387CD0C0">
Bet&s;ey, the ve&s;tal queen, the clergy &s;uffered great di&s;content. For why? becau&s;e praying, reading and &s;cripture expound|ing people were &s;uffered to live, and were even tolerated in the univer&s;ity, which was a kind of counterbalance to the emolument their reverences had enjoyed in the days of Mary of &s;carlet memory, for as &s;oon as this orthodox lady had a&s;cended the throne, matters took a very agreeable turn, and the right reverend bi&s;hops, Bonner and Gardiner began to work for the good of the church. Like true bred D&mdash; D&mdash;s they &s;earched every corner of the land for matters to work upon; and who &s;hould they pitch upon, know ye but tho&s;e mini&s;ters and others who prayed to God, read, and expounded the &s;criptures, and &s;ung hymns? For tho&s;e clergymen were much like unto others, they di&s;couraged praying to any be&s;ides &s;aints of their own cannonization; and as for the &s;criptures, they found it for their intere&s;t that the &s;en&s;e of them &s;hould be concealed. And no doubt other people of the &s;ame practices have rea&s;ons equally ponderous to a&s;&s;ign for their conduct.</P>
<P>Who was Cranmer, my beloved? Why truly, though he was primate of England, he took upon him to pray, read and expound the &s;criptures, and as one &s;uch, according to the laws of Trent council, he was expelled the convocation and burnt to death, as an enemy &s;o the clergy, Latimer, and Ridley, and Hooper, and Taylor, and Bradford, and Hunter, and Philpot, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. were all of them guilty of tho&s;e heinous offences of praying, of reading, of expound|ing the &s;criptures, and of &s;inging of hymns. The &s;ame crimes with which the Oxford methodi&s;ts were charged, and for which they were expelled the univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>Thus, beloved, I have with much plea&s;ure gone &s;o far thro' with my fir&s;t propo&s;ed plan, and from what I have advanc|ed we may rai&s;e the following remarks; 1. That the &s;pirit of our D &mdash; D &mdash;'s has been the &s;ame in all ages, a noble &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition to methodi&s;tical tenets. The magicians, the a&s;trologers, the &s;orcerers, and the chaldeans, the &s;cribes, the phari&s;ees, the lawyers, the &s;adducees, and the doctors, and the &s;hrine-makers, and the inqui&s;itors, and the roman bi&s;hops, and the vice chancellors, and the heads of hou&s;es are all of the &s;ame religion; namely to <HI>op|po&s;e praying, reading, and expounding of the &s;criptures.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="23" REF="012104_0022_0F89C48054C3EB00">2. That the &s;tate of religion in our land is likely to be &s;oon upon a very re&s;pectable &s;ooting, &s;eeing no more than &s;ix, out of the va&s;t number of &s;tudents at Oxford, took upon them to pray to God, to read, and to expound the &s;criptures; &s;o that it is hoped the many pari&s;hes in England, will be like|ly to have par&s;ons who will let their pari&s;hioners have their own way, and go quietly to hell without di&s;turbing of them. Whereas was not care taken to &s;uppre&s;s praying people in the univer&s;ity, we &s;hould have the nation &s;warming with them, much to the detriment of p&mdash;c&mdash;ft</P>
<P N="3">3. It is ob&s;erveable that we have found out more fully what four of tho&s;e &s;ix gentlemen were, ere they &s;et foot in the univer&s;ity; one was a publican, another a &s;mith, a third a barber, and a fourth a teacher, under W&mdash;, as it is written by the reverend Dr. Oxonien&s;is Gazetteer, No. 12199, April 8, 1768, and I wot, my beloved, though my kindred are profe&s;&s;ors of &s;uch arts they are to be held as dangerous &s;ciences; therefore mu&s;t not be tolerated by the clergy.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. And foremo&s;t the clergy has &s;uffered much di&s;con|tent from the black&s;mith, and whil&s;t the bitterne&s;s of the lo&s;s of the abbey lands belcheth from our &s;tomachs, we pru|nella gentlemen will never forgive the black&s;miths. Quere, For why? An&s;. Becau&s;e he was a black&s;mith's &s;on, lord Thomas Cromwell by name who &s;tripped the church, that is to &s;ay, the clergy, of tho&s;e warm, tho&s;e fat abbey lands. No more black&s;mith's I pray you now &mdash; we'll have none of them. Therefore Mr. V&mdash;e C&mdash;r did well in expelling the man becau&s;e he had been a black&s;mith.</P>
<P N="2">2. One other of them was a publican, <HI>i. e.</HI> a tax gatherer, and I &s;uppo&s;e, M. V&mdash; C&mdash;r thought that the difference betwixt <HI>tax gathering</HI> and <HI>tythe gathering,</HI> being &s;o very tri|fling that after a young man had &s;ufficiently learned at home to gather taxes, it was quite needle&s;s for him to come to the univer&s;ity to learn to <HI>gather tythes.</HI> I wot, my be|loved, that the old grudge betwixt the phari&s;ees and the publicans has not yet &s;ub&s;ided. For, as the learned <HI>Oxoni|en&s;is</HI> ob&s;erves, the V&mdash;C&mdash; expelled a man, the univer|&s;ity, for having been a publican.</P>
<P N="3">3. And in the next place another had been a <HI>barber,</HI> That is to &s;ay a <HI>&s;haver.</HI> Believe me it is dangerous to play with edge tools, and razors are keen things; but keene&s;s mu&s;t not be admitted at O &mdash; d. A &s;haver if tolerated,
<PB N="24" REF="012104_0023_0F89C480F5EA1020">
might be as bad as a black&s;mith; but no more of this, we'll have no more &s;havers, my beloved.</P>
<P N="4">4. A fourth was a teacher in a &s;chool, under W &mdash;y. But who, or what, this &s;ame W &mdash; y is, whether an hill, an old abbey, an holy college, or an oak-tree, the accurate <HI>Oxonien&s;is</HI> does not &s;ay. But this &s;choolma&s;ter who taught under it, be it what it will, was ju&s;tly expelled. For why? Becau&s;e he departed &s;o very far from the rule e&s;tabli&s;hed among &s;tudents. The common rule ob&s;erved by the hope|ful young gentlemen of the gown is, before they have &s;o much as learned the fir&s;t le&s;&s;on of them&s;elves, they conclude that they are able to teach others; witne&s;s &s;o many a dull par&s;on. But this man though he had been accu&s;tomed to teach others, meanly deba&s;ed him&s;elf, &s;o far as to receive in&s;tructions from others; but &s;uch a mean opinion of one's &s;elf being no way likely to add weight to the importance of the par&s;on, mu&s;t not be tolerated. I &s;hall not now &s;ay any more; intending ere long to write a commentary on the go&s;pel of Oxford, as written by the learned, the ju&s;t, the accurate, and the reverend doctor <HI>Oxonien&s;is.</HI></P>
