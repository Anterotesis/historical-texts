<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>Mr De&s;ign in writing this <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> is, to give as clear and faithful an Account as I am able, of the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> among the <HI>Natives</HI> at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk</HI>: particularly of Mr. <HI>SERGEANT's Mi&s;&s;ion</HI> to them; of the Mea&s;ures be took to recover tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> from their Barbarity, Ig|norance and Heatheni&s;m, and to inform them in the Doctrines of the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI>; and of the <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> which, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, attended his faithful Endeavours to per&s;uade them to embrace the true Religion.</P>
<P>In pro&s;ecuting this De&s;ign, I hope, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, to do Ju&s;tice to the Memory of that excellent Man, who, from generous and pious Principles, undertook, and with great Indu&s;try and Faithfulne&s;s pro|&s;ecuted that Self-denying Work; to let the generous and pious <HI>Donors</HI> to that good De&s;ign know, what the Succe&s;s of their liberal and charitable <HI>Contributions</HI> to it has been; and to excite others to follow their laudable and generous Example, by giving freely of their Substance to promote that good Work, the <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>Heathen</HI> to the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Faith. If the&s;e Ends are an&s;wer'd, I &s;hall not regret the Trouble and Pains I have been at.</P>
<P>It may, perhaps, be thought &s;trange, that this Performance has been &s;o long delay'd. To which I would &s;ay; It was almo&s;t a Year

<P>When it was fir&s;t propos'd to me to undertake this Bu&s;ine&s;s, I concluded that Mr. <HI>SERGEANT</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'d what was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for &s;uch a Work; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> after he entred upon his <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion,</HI> be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to me, de&s;iring that I would &s;end him an Account of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l Tran&s;|a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ions with tho&s;e Indians, before he went to them: giving this as a Rea&s;on, why he de&s;ir'd it, <HI>viz.</HI> That be de&s;ign'd to collect and pre|&s;erve <HI>Materials</HI> for, and, it Time to come, to give the World a Hi&s;tory of, the Progre&s;s of Religion among the <HI>Indians,</HI> if his <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> among them &s;hould prove con&s;idera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le; or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that Purpo&s;e, I therefore concluded, that he had not only kept a <HI>Journal</HI> of his own Doings among them, but that he had al&s;o care<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ully pre&s;erv'd Copies of all his <HI>Letters</HI> to Gentlemen with whom he maintain'd a Corre&s;pondence, and their <HI>Returns</HI> to him; and that little or nothing more would be needful, than to Tran&s;cribe, in their proper Places, what he had pre&s;erv'd. But I found my&s;elf, more or le&s;s, di&s;appointed upon all the&s;e Heads. His <HI>Journal</HI> was indeed &s;omething large &amp; particular for five or &s;ix Years, but after that Time it con&s;i&s;ted only of a brief Hints, two or three Pages in Octave, upon common Paper, con|taining the Space of a Year; and, for two or three Years, it was wholly warning. He was al&s;o &s;o full of Bu&s;ine&s;s, that he had not Time to pre&s;erve <HI>Copies</HI> of those <HI>Letters</HI> he wrote to Gentlemen with whom he corresponded, either in this <HI>Country,</HI> or in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> except a very few. Yea, when he wrote <HI>Hi&s;torical</HI> Account of the <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> among the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>STOCKBRIDGE.</HI>
<PB N="iii" REF="007023_0004_102AEA4708D00AE0">
under his Mini&s;try, in Compliance with the De&s;ire of the <HI>Committee of Directors</HI> for the <HI>Society</HI> for propagating Chri&s;tian Knowledge, in <HI>SCOTLAND,</HI> &s;ignified to him by their Pre&s;ident <HI>GEORGE DRUM|MOND,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and &s;ent it to them, he had no Lei&s;ure to pre&s;erve a Copy of it. Some few Letters likewi&s;e, written to him, were not to be found.</P>
<P>When I became acquainted with the&s;e Things, I was much di&s;couraged; and had not I recover'd the <HI>Originals</HI> which Mr. <HI>SER|GEANT</HI> wrote to the Rev. Dr. <HI>COLMAN,</HI> to whom he wrote more frequently, and more freely, than to any other Man, I &s;hould not have attempted any Thing of this Nature. And, when I entred upon the Bu&s;ine&s;s, I little thought of compo&s;ing any Thing that would be fit for publick Flex. My De&s;ign was (&s;eeing I had by me what <HI>Ma|terials</HI> I could come at) to pre&s;erve what might be mo&s;t likely to be of U&s;e hereafter, which, in all Probability, would &s;oon have been le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, by continuing in loo&s;e Papers.</P>
<P>And now it is propos'd to <HI>publi&s;h</HI> what I have written, I hope the foregoing Account will excu&s;e me; tho' the Performance be not to <HI>full</HI> and <HI>compleat,</HI> as it might have been, by the Help of tho&s;e Things which I could not obtain. Every Reader will be &s;en&s;ible, that Mr. <HI>SERGEANT,</HI> and the good Cau&s;e in which he was engaged, might have been placed in a more advantagious Light, bad tho&s;e Things which are wanting, been pre&s;erv'd. He will al&s;o, I tru&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en&s;ible that Eloquence and Neatne&s;s of Stile are not what I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">sured after, but a plain <HI>Narrative</HI> of Facts, in a Language, which I hope will prove intelligible to all, who take the Trouble of reading what is here pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>I cannot think any judicious Per&s;on, upon mature Con&s;ideration, will judge, that which has been brought to pa&s;s by Mr. <HI>SERGEANT's Mini&s;try,</HI> among the <HI>Indians,</HI> is &s;mall and incon&s;iderable. In the Year 1734. when he went fir&s;t to tho&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> their Number, great and &s;mall, was &s;hort of Fifty, and they in the Depths of Hea|theni&s;m and Barbarity. In the Year 1749, when he died, they were increased to 218; 182 <HI>Indians</HI> had been baptized by him, and a Church con&s;i&s;ting of 42 <HI>Indian</HI> Communicants commemorated

the Sufferings of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> at the <HI>Lord's-Table.</HI> Mr. <HI>WOODBRIDGE's</HI> school (&s;eperate from the boarding School) had belonging to it 55 Scholars, who were taught to Read and Write, and were in&s;tructed in the Principles of Religion. This indeed is not like a <HI>Nation bring born at once</HI>; but, by the U&s;e of ordinary Means, greater Things have &s;eldom been brought to pa&s;s in &s;o &s;hort a Time. And we, in this Part of the Country, have &s;een Nothing like it, re&s;pecting the poor <HI>Natives</HI> who live upon our Borders. And if Mr. <HI>SER|GEANT's</HI> Life had been &s;par'd to have pro&s;ecuted the Affair of the Boarding-School, according to his Intention, and with his wonted Wi&s;dom, Prudence &amp; Skill, is it not highly probable, that we &s;hould, by this Time, have &s;een a con&s;iderable Number of the <HI>Indian</HI> Youth educated there, in Labour, Indu&s;try and good Hu&s;bandry, as well as in Learning; who probably might have prov'd not only u&s;eful Members of Society, but al&s;o of the Church of Chri&s;t?</P>
<P>If what I have written upon this Subject may be a Cau&s;e of many <HI>Thanks&s;givings to GOD</HI> for his rich Grace and Mercy, exerci&s;ed to the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>STOCKBRIDGE,</HI> by Mr. <HI>SERGEANT's Mini&s;try</HI>; if it may be a Means of exciting pious and well di&s;pos'd Per&s;ons to charitable and generous Contributions to promote the &s;piritual Good of the poor <HI>Natives</HI> there, or in other Places; if it may be an Inducement to any young Gentlemen, qualified for &s;uch a Service, to follow the excellent Example Mr. <HI>SERGEANT</HI> has given; however mean the Performance is, the Effect will be good, and will an&s;wer the End of the unworthy Author,</P>

<HEAD>Hi&s;torical Memoirs, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Tribe commonly known by the Name of <HI>River-Indians</HI> is large, mo&s;t of them live within, the Limits of <HI>New-York</HI> Government, inter&s;pers'd among the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and never had Endeavours us'd with them, either to civilize or chri&s;tianize them; but &s;till continue in their native Ignorance and Barbarity. A &s;mall Number or them live in the N. W. Corner of <HI>Connecticut</HI> Government, and a few Families of them on <HI>Hou|&s;atunnuk</HI> River, or at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> which now goes by the Name of <HI>Sheffield</HI> in the County of <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> in the S. W. Corner of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Province, bordering on the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> W. and on <HI>Connecticut</HI> Colony S.</P>
<P>The&s;e few <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> are they to whom the Rev. Mr. JOHN SERGEANT received his Mi&s;&s;ion, and with whom En|deavours have been us'd for about eighteen Years pa&s;t, to form them to Chri&s;tianity. And 'tis the De&s;ign of this Treati&s;e, to give an Hi&s;torical Account of the Mea&s;ures which have been taken with them for this End; the Succe&s;s that has attended them; and what their pre&s;ent State is.</P>
<P>In Pro&s;ecuting this De&s;ign, I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to give an Account of a con&s;iderable Part of the <HI>Life, Death</HI> and <HI>Character,</HI> of that pious and excellent Man, the Rev. Mr. JOHN SERGEANT, who preach'd the Go&s;pel to them, and died in that Service.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="007023_0007_102AEA4CCDD31000">About the Year 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0. or perhaps &s;omething &s;ooner, the <HI>Ge|neral A&s;&s;embly</HI> of this <HI>Province</HI> granted two Town&s;hips on <HI>Hou|&s;atunnuk</HI> River, to &s;ome People who were de&s;irous of &s;ettling there. The Land was purcha&s;ed of the <HI>River-Indians,</HI> who had the native Right; but they re&s;erv'd for them&s;elves two &s;mall Tracts of Land: one lying at a Place they call <HI>Ska<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ok,</HI> and now falls into the fir&s;t Pari&s;h in <HI>Sheffield</HI>; the other about 8 or 10 Miles further up the River, which they call <HI>Wnahktukook,</HI> and is within the Bounds of <HI>Stockbridge.</HI> And at each of the&s;e Places dwell about four or five Families of <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> made Settlements there, they became ac|quainted with tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI>; and <HI>Kunkapot,</HI> the principal Per&s;on among them, was &s;oon taken Notice of by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and &s;poken of as a Man of Worth. It was by a meer Accident I became acquainted with his general Character. Mr. <HI>Ebenezer Miller,</HI> one of my Neighbours, who had his Account from <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> inform'd me, that he was &s;trictly temperate, a very ju&s;t and up|right Man in his Dealings, a Man of Prudence, and indu&s;trious in his Bu&s;ine&s;s; and inclin'd to embrace the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion: But that there were &s;ome Difficulties lying in his Mind, two of which I remember. One was, that if he became a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> his own People would di&s;card him. The other was, the ill Con|ver&s;ation of Chri&s;tians; it being as bad, as he tho't, if not wor&s;e than that of the <HI>Heathen.</HI> (An Objection too just, and it is not to be wonder'd at, that it &s;hould prove a &s;tumbling Block to an ob&s;erving <HI>Heathen.</HI>)</P>
<P>I was much affected with the Story of this <HI>Indian,</HI> and deter|min'd to endeavour that he, and the Re&s;t of the <HI>Indians</HI> there, might be in&s;tructed in the Doctrines of <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI>; for this I was prepar'd, by Dr. <HI>Colman</HI>'s giving me an Account, the <HI>May</HI> preceding, of the Money depo&s;ited in the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> Hand for &s;uch Purpo&s;es; and knowing that the honourable <HI>John Stod|dard,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of <HI>Northampton,</HI> was more than any Man, in the <HI>Pro|vince,</HI> acquainted with the State of the <HI>Indians</HI> in general, having often been employ'd by the <HI>Government</HI> in Affairs relating to them, I determin'd to di&s;cour&s;e with him upon it, and to take his Advice in the Ca&s;e. Accordingly, <HI>March</HI> 11th 1734, I waited upon him at his own Hou&s;e, and confer'd with him upon the Subject. He informed me, "That the <HI>River-Indians</HI> were the
<PB N="3" REF="007023_0008_102AEA4F61A73818">
large&s;t <HI>Tribe</HI> of any near the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Settlements; that he judg'd a <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionary</HI> among them would be much more likely to do Ser|vice, and to an&s;wer the End of his <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion,</HI> than tho&s;e <HI>Mi&s;&s;iona|ries,</HI> Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>Parker, Hin&s;del,</HI> and <HI>Secomb,</HI> who had been &s;ome Time before ordain'd, and &s;ent to the &s;everal <HI>Forts</HI> and <HI>Truck-Hou&s;e</HI>: in our <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> &amp; <HI>We&s;tern</HI> Borders. For the <HI>Tribes,</HI> tho&s;e Gentlemen were &s;ent to, were very much under the Influence of the <HI>French.</HI> And further, what Opportunity tho&s;e <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionaries</HI> had to in&s;truct them, was only at tho&s;e <HI>Forts,</HI> when they came in upon a trading De&s;ign; and that, as &s;oon as they had done their Bu&s;ine&s;s, they went off, and while they &s;tay'd, were not perhaps in the be&s;t Temper to receive In&s;truction: But as to the <HI>River-Indians,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> had no Influence upon them; a <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionary</HI> might live among them, and take all Opportunities to in&s;truct, not only the Men, but al&s;o their Families: Their Children might be taught to read, and write, and be led into a Knowledge of the Principles of <HI>Chri&s;tanity,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Event prov'd the&s;e Rea&s;onings to be very ju&s;t; for, not long after, tho&s;e Mi&s;&s;ionaries, Me&s;&s;i, <HI>Parker, Hin&s;del,</HI> and <HI>Secomb,</HI> were di&s;courag'd, and threw up their <HI>Mi&s;&s;ions,</HI> as not being able to an&s;wer the Ends of them; but a <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion</HI> to the <HI>River-Indians</HI> prov'd more &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Some Time after, I inform'd the Rev. Mr. <HI>Stephen Williams</HI> of <HI>Springfield</HI> of the&s;e Sugge&s;tions, and what I had heard. And upon our Motion the Rev. Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Hatfield</HI> wrote to the Honourable and Rev. <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>; who de&s;ir'd us that we would take a Journey to <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> and confer with the <HI>Indians</HI> there, re&s;pecting their receiving a <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionary</HI> to in&s;truct them.&mdash;About this Time His Excellency Governour <HI>Belcher</HI> was pleas'd to honour the two principal <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk</HI> with <HI>Commi&s;&s;ions.</HI> To <HI>Kunkapot</HI> he gave a <HI>Captain</HI>'s, and to <HI>Umpachenee</HI> a <HI>Lieutenant</HI>'s. Their <HI>Commi&s;&s;ions</HI> being &s;ent to <HI>Spring|field,</HI> we heard that they were coming for them, &amp; therefore con|cluded we would confer with them here, before we proceeded to <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk.</HI> Accordingly, on the 22d Day of <HI>May,</HI> we went to their Lodgings, and di&s;cours'd with them by their Interpreter <HI>Jeboikim Van Valkenburgh,</HI> who came with them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Captain</HI> &s;hew'd him&s;elf very de&s;irous of having a <HI>Mi&s;&s;io|nary</HI> &s;ent among them, that their Children might be taught to
<PB N="4" REF="007023_0009_102AEA51E3732648">
read, &amp;c. The <HI>Lieutenant</HI> did not &s;eem &s;o very de&s;irous of it; but yet expre&s;s'd his Willingne&s;s that it &s;hould be &s;o. But, at the &s;ame Time, they let us know, that they &s;pake only for <HI>them|&s;elves,</HI> and that it would be needful their <HI>Brethren</HI> &s;hould be con|&s;ulted in the Affair. We therefore inform'd them, that &s;ome Time in <HI>July</HI> they might expect to &s;ee us at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> where we would confer with them, and their Brethren, further upon tho&s;e Things. But when the Time came, I was &s;ick. The Rev. Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> of <HI>We&s;tfield</HI> therefore took my Place, and, on the 8th of <HI>July</HI> 1734, accompany'd Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> thither. The <HI>Captain</HI> and <HI>Lieutenant</HI> were very glad to &s;ee them, and call'd their Peo|ple together, of whom tho&s;e Gentlemen inquir'd, whether they were willing a <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> &s;hould be &s;ent to them to in&s;truct them in the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> to teach their Children to read, &amp;c. The <HI>Indians</HI> desir'd four Days to con&s;ider of the Thing propos'd; and at the End of tho&s;e Days they all gave in their Names, and &s;ig|nify'd their De&s;ires to tho&s;e Reverend Gentlemen, that a <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> mig't be &s;ent to them, for the Ends propos'd. Upon which the Rev. Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> deliver'd to them a &s;mall Belt of <HI>Wompum,</HI> as a Confirmation of what had pa&s;s'd between them, and as a Sort of <HI>Record</HI> thereof.</P>

<P>Before this Time, Mr. SERGEANT's Inclination to &s;erve the Souls of the <HI>Natives</HI> had reached our Ears; for he had freely &s;aid in private Conver&s;ation, that he had rather be employ'd as a <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionary</HI> to the <HI>Natives,</HI> if a Door &s;hould open for it, than ac|cept a Call any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pari&s;h might give him. Tho&s;e Gen|tlemen being inform'd of this, were not at a Lo&s;s where to go, but made their Application to him in <HI>September</HI> 1734. at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> where he was employ'd as one of the <HI>Tutors</HI> or <HI>Yale-College.</HI> Their Application to him, and his An&s;wer, I &s;hall give the Rea|der
<PB N="6" REF="007023_0011_102AEA558CD431E8">
in his own Words, as I find them in the Beginning of the <HI>Journal,</HI> which he kept of his <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion</HI> to the <HI>River-Indians</HI> at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk.</HI></P>
<Q><P>In <HI>September</HI> 1734. The Rev. Mr. <HI>Stephen Williams,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Nehemiah Bull,</HI> being appointed by the Gentlemen <HI>Com|mi&s;&s;ioners</HI> in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> to treat and agree with &s;ome Per&s;on to undertake a <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion</HI> to the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> came to me at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> with the Propo&s;als; bringing a very encoura|ing Account of the good Inclination of tho&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> and of their De&s;ire to be in&s;tructed in the Principles of the <HI>Christian Religion.</HI></P>
<P>I was then engag'd in Bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>Yale-College</HI>; but, upon the fair Probability there appear'd of Succe&s;s, I told the Gen|tlemen, that I was &s;o far from being unwilling to devote my|&s;elf to the Service of God in &s;o good a Cau&s;e, that I was rather de&s;irous, if none better qualify'd could be found, to improve what Abilities I had in &s;uch an Undertaking; tho' I was &s;en&s;ible, I mu&s;t not only lo&s;e a great many agreable Amu&s;ements of Life, e&s;pecially in leaving my Bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>College,</HI> which was the mo&s;t agreable to me that could be; but al&s;o expo&s;e my|&s;elf to many Fatigues and Hard&s;hips, and I know not to what Dangers, among a barbarous People. For indeed I &s;hould be a&s;ham'd to own my&s;elf a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> or even a <HI>Man,</HI> and yet utterly refu&s;e doing what lay in my Power, to cultivate Hu|manity among a People naturally ingenious enough, but for Want of In&s;truction, living &s;o much below the Dignity of hu|man Nature; and to promote the <HI>Salvation</HI> of <HI>Souls peri&s;hing in the Dark,</HI> when the <HI>Light of Life</HI> is &s;o near them. Be&s;ides, to &s;ee &s;o much Pains taken by tho&s;e of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, not only in other Parts, but al&s;o in <HI>America,</HI> and in our Borders, who&s;e Religion is &s;o corrupted, that it may &s;carcely be call'd Chri&s;tianity, &s;hould, methinks, excite us to Emulation, who, at lea&s;t, think we profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity in much greater Purity.</P>
<P>Upon the earne&s;t De&s;ire of the two forementioned Gentlemen, I readily con&s;ented to undertake the Mi&s;&s;ion, if I might be accepted upon the Terms I propos'd, <HI>viz.</HI> that with the Ap|probation of the Rev. <HI>Rector</HI> and <HI>Trustees</HI> of <HI>Yale-College,</HI> I would &s;pend about half of the Year with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and the Re&s;t of the Year live at <HI>College</HI>; (for I had a Mind to carry my
<PB N="7" REF="007023_0012_102AEA58FAF11C80">
<HI>Pupils</HI> through the Cour&s;e of their Studies, who now were en|tering upon their la&s;t Year) and afterward, if there &s;hould be any rea&s;onable Encouragement, I would devote my&s;elf intire|ly to the Service of in&s;tructing the <HI>Indians.</HI> This they agreed to, and therefore the Rev. Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> immediately wrote to the honourable <HI>Adam Winthrop,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> one of the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> to inform him how far they had proceeded.</P></Q>
<P>The Terms propos'd by Mr. SERGEANT were agreable to the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners,</HI> as appears from the following Letter from the ho|nourable <HI>Adam Winthrop,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> their <HI>Secretary.</HI></P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>By a Letter ju&s;t receiv'd from the Rev. Mr. <HI>Stephen Williams,</HI> I am inform'd he has treated with you about engaging in the <HI>Indian's</HI> Service at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk.</HI> And I am highly gratified with the encouraging Account he gives of your Ingenuity, Learning, and Piety, and al&s;o with your laudable Inclination to undertake the Service. The only Difficulty he mentions is, That the <HI>Rector, Tru&s;tes,</HI> and al&s;o your <HI>Pupils,</HI> were unwilling you &s;hould leave the <HI>College,</HI> till they had done reciting; but that, if the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> would be &s;atisfied with your re&s;iding at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk</HI> one Quarter of a Year now, and then leave the <HI>Indians</HI> till the Spring, you would return and tarry. And Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> de&s;ir'd that it might be &s;ignify'd as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, whether the Commi&s;&s;ioners would accept of this Projection.</P>
<P>Time would not allow of a full Meeting, but I have confer'd with His Excellency the <HI>Governor</HI> about it, and we do, in the Name of the Commi&s;ioners accept of the Propo&s;al. So that you may proceed and go to Mr. <HI>Williams</HI>'s, who informs me that he will accompany you to <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk.</HI></P>
<P>I heartily wi&s;h you, thro' the divine Ble&s;&s;ing, good Succe&s;s, and much Comfort, in the Employment. And, de&s;iring to hear from you in An&s;wer to this, I remain,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Accordingly Mr. SERGEANT proceeded to <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> and in his <HI>Journal</HI> gives the following brief Account of his Journey, and the Reception he met with there.</P>
<Q><PB N="8" REF="007023_0013_102AEA5AC1B2C0E0"><P><HI>October</HI> 8th. I &s;et out from <HI>New-Haven,</HI> and went to Mr. <HI>Bull</HI>'s, who it was propos'd &s;hould bear me Company to <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> and introduce me to the <HI>Indians,</HI> being &s;omething ac|quainted with them, as he had been there before in the Sum|mer with Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> to treat with them, with Re&s;pect to their receiving the <HI>Go&s;pel.</HI> From <HI>We&s;tfield,</HI> on Thur&s;day <HI>Octo|ber</HI> 11th, we &s;et out in the Afternoon, de&s;igning to lodge at a Hou&s;e about 15 Miles onwards upon the Road, which was the only Hou&s;e before we came to <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk.</HI> But Night com|ing on too &s;oon for us, we were forced to lodge in the Woods without Fire or Shelter. The next Day we got to <HI>Hou&s;atun|nuk,</HI> a little before Night, thro' a mo&s;t doleful Wilderne&s;s and the wor&s;t Road, perhaps, that ever was rid. We took Care to inform the <HI>Indians</HI> we were come, [they had expected us &s;ome Time] and de&s;ir'd them to meet us the next Day, at a Place we appointed, near the Middle between the Places where the <HI>Indian</HI> liv'd; for one half of them liv'd near Miles above, up the <HI>River,</HI> and the other about &s;o much below.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 13th. In the Afternoon I made a &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e to the <HI>Indians</HI> by an Interpreter, an <HI>Indian</HI> call'd <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> to which they (about 20 in Number<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Sergeant</HI> notes in his <HI>Journal</HI> &s;ome Time after this, that when he &s;peaks of his Hearers, he intends only <HI>adult</HI> Per&s;ons, and is &s;o to be under&s;tood here and el&s;ewhere.</NOTE>) gave very good Attention, e&s;pecially Capt. <HI>Kunkapot</HI> their <HI>Chief,</HI> and his <HI>Family.</HI></P>
<P>I adapted my Di&s;cour&s;e, as well as I could, to their Capa|cities and Manner of Thinking. The next Day <HI>Ebenezer</HI> told me, that one who had been a little cold in the De&s;ign, was mov'd with what I &s;aid, and &s;eem'd now con&s;iderably engag'd. The Interpreter could &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> very well, for he had liv'd with them, and had got con&s;iderable Knowledge in the Prin|ciples of Religion, and was very de&s;irous Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> would <HI>bap|tize</HI> him. Accordingly we met at the <HI>Lieutenant</HI>'s Hou&s;e on Thur&s;day, where Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> examin'd <HI>Ebenezer</HI> with Re&s;pect to his Knowledge and Re&s;olution to live a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Life, and he gave a pretty good Account of the Principles of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion, and &s;aid, he would rather burn in the Fire than for|&s;ake the Truth. Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> made a Prayer, which <HI>Ebenezer</HI> in|terpreted, and I deliver'd another &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e, after which
<PB N="9" REF="007023_0014_102AEA5C85498FB8">
<HI>Ebenezer</HI> was <HI>baptized</HI> by Mr. <HI>Bull,</HI> making the following Re|nunciation of <HI>Heatheni&s;m,</HI> Profe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> and Pro|mi&s;e of a <HI>good Life.</HI></P>
<P>Through the Goodne&s;s of God towards me, in bringing me into the Way of the Knowledge of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> I am convinc'd of the Truth of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> and that it is the only Way that leads to <HI>Salvation</HI> and <HI>Happine&s;s.</HI> I therefore freely, and hear|tily, for&s;ake <HI>Heatheni&s;h</HI> Darkne&s;s, and embrace the Light of the Go&s;pel, and the Way of <HI>Holine&s;s.</HI> And do now, in Pre&s;ence of Almighty God, the Searcher of Hearts, and Witne&s;&s;es, &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;olemnly take the <HI>Lord Jehovah,</HI> to be my God and P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion, <HI>Jesus Chri&s;t</HI> his Son to be my <HI>Lord Redeemer</HI>; and the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> to be my <HI>Sanctifier</HI> and <HI>Teacher.</HI> And do Co|venant and Promi&s;e, by the Help of divine Grace, that I will cleave to the Lord with Purpo&s;e of Heart, believing his revealed Truths, as far as I can gain the Knowledge of them, obeying his Commands, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">th the&s;e which mark out my Duty, and tho&s;e that forbid Sin, sincerely and uprightly to the End of my Life.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Ebenezer</HI> &s;hew'd us a little Boy, nam'd <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">,</HI> being in the Woods with his Father, at a con&s;iderable Di&s;tance, and hearing that I was coming, and would teach the Children to read, would &s;tay no longer with his Father, but was resolv'd to come Home, tho' his Father (to try him I &s;uppo&s;e) told him, if he left him no Body would take Care of him, to pro|vide him Victuals and Cloaths; but he would not be di&s;&s;uaded from coming Home to learn his Book. And what makes this the more remarkable in the <HI>Boy,</HI> is, that he is exceeding fond of his Father, as his Father is al&s;o of him.</P></Q>
<P>The <HI>Indians,</HI> as has been ob&s;erv'd, living in <HI>two</HI> Places about 8 or 10 Miles a&s;under, it was needful they should come together in one Place, that they, on the Sabbath might attend upon Mr. SERGEANT's Preaching, and have their Children taught on the Week Days. When therefore they were together at Lieutenant <HI>Umpachenee's</HI> Hou&s;e, they di&s;cours'd the Matter, and concluded, that, during the Winter Sea&s;on, they would dwell together about half Way between tho&s;e Places, where each Party then liv'd; the Place being well accommodated with Wood and Water, and al&s;o near &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Families, in one of which Mr. SERGEANT
<PB N="10" REF="007023_0015_102AEA5E1EFD8860">
might live, while he &s;erv'd them; but this could continue no longer than the Spring, when they mu&s;t return to their own Places to Plant, &amp;c.</P>
<Q><HI>Lord's-Day, October</HI> 20th. I made two Di&s;cour&s;es to the <HI>In|dians,</HI> (in Number the &s;ame as before) to which they gave great Attention, and &s;eem'd to be well pleas'd. They were inter|preted by Mr. <HI>Van Valkenburgh,</HI> a <HI>Dutch Man.</HI></Q>
<P>On Monday <HI>October</HI> 21&s;t. They chearfully &s;et about building a <HI>publick Hou&s;e</HI> at the Place agreed upon, to &s;erve them, both to meet in on the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> and to keep the <HI>School</HI> in; round which they built &s;mall Huts for their &s;everal Families to dwell in. The Chearfulne&s;s &amp; Engagedne&s;s they di&s;cover'd herein, was an Evi|dence of the ardent De&s;ires they had to hear the Word preach'd, and to have their Children taught to read. And, in a &s;hort Time, they all mov'd with their Families thither. While the&s;e Things were doing, Mr. SERGEANT went up to <HI>Wnabktukook,</HI> the Place where the <HI>Captain</HI> and &s;ome others lived, to teach their Children to read, and was greatly pleas'd with the Re&s;pect they &s;hew'd him, and with the Children, they being exceedingly engag'd to learn. He went al&s;o to <HI>Skatekook,</HI> the Place where the <HI>Lieutenant</HI> and four Families more liv'd, and taught their Children. The Number at each Place being about 9 or 10.</P>
<P>The Number of Mr. SERGEANT's Auditors now began to in|crea&s;e. <HI>Lord's-Day, November</HI> 3. he writes, <Q>My Auditory was greater than it had been; and now, be&s;ides Preaching, I pray'd by an Interpreter.</Q> And to move our Pity to the poor <HI>Heathen</HI> who are brought up in Ignorance, he proceeds thus; <Q>After Service they invited me to go, the next Day, up to <HI>Wnabktukook,</HI> to &s;ee a <HI>religious Ceremony,</HI> they had learn'd of their Fathers. Accordingly I went. <HI>Ebenezer</HI> bore me Com|pany, of whom I enquir'd, to &s;atisfy my Curio&s;ity, into the Notions, Cu&s;toms &amp; Manners of their Nation. Among other Things, he told me of &s;ome he had known that were <HI>Athei&s;ts,</HI> who &s;uppos'd all Things began, continu'd, and ceas'd, accord|ing to the &s;everal Laws of their <HI>Natures,</HI> without any Cau&s;e or Direction from a &s;uperiour Hand. Others believ'd the <HI>Sun</HI> to be <HI>God,</HI> or at lea&s;t the <HI>Body,</HI> or <HI>Re&s;idence,</HI> of the <HI>Deity</HI>; but that now they genernlly believ'd the Exi&s;tence of one &s;upreme invi&s;ible Being, the Maker of all Things. He told me al&s;o
<PB N="11" REF="007023_0016_102AEA60D57C59D8">
&s;undry childi&s;h and ridiculous Things, which they believ'd: As that the &s;even Stars were &s;o many <HI>Indians</HI> tran&s;lated to Hea|ven in a Dance; that the Stars in <HI>Charles's Wain,</HI> are &s;o many Men hunting a <HI>Bear</HI>; that they begin the Chace in the Spring, and hold it all Summer; by the Fall they have wounded it, and that the Blood turns the Leaves red: by the Winter they have kill'd it, and the Snow is made of its Fat; which, being melted by the Heat of the Summer, makes the Sap of Trees.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I leave the Reader to conjecture, whence the&s;e <HI>Americans</HI> happened to form their Notion &s;o &s;imilar to that of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> who call the&s;e Stars the <HI>Great Bear.</HI></NOTE></P>
<Q><P>There is a large Heap of Stones, I &s;uppo&s;e ten Cart Loads, in the Way to <HI>Wanbktukook,</HI> which the <HI>Indians</HI> have thrown together, as they have pa&s;s't by the Place; for it us'd to be their Cu&s;tom, every Time any one pa&s;s'd by, to throw a Stone to it: But what was the End of it they cannot tell: Only they &s;ay, their Fathers us'd to do &s;o, and they do it becau&s;e it was the Cu&s;tom of their Fathers. But <HI>Ebenezer</HI> &s;ays, he &s;uppo&s;es it was de&s;ign'd to be as an Expre&s;&s;ion of their Gratitude to the &s;upream Being, that he had pre&s;erv'd them to &s;ee the Place again. The&s;e, Things <HI>Ebenezer</HI> told me, by the Way, as we were riding to <HI>Wnabktukook,</HI> which are &s;uch childi&s;h Fables that I had not taken Notice of them, had it not been that they believ'd them, as childi&s;h as they are; which &s;hews us how ea&s;ily Men brought up in Ignorance are impos'd upon, and &s;hould, methinks, excite us the more to pity them.&mdash;When we were come to the <HI>Captains Hou&s;e,</HI> there were several of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <HI>Indians</HI> there, as well from below, as tho&s;e that belong'd there. After we had been there for &s;ome Time, two Men, appointed for the Service, took a Deer down that hung up in the Wig|wam,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A <HI>Wigwam</HI> is an <HI>Indian House,</HI> in building of which they take &s;mall flexible Poles and &s;tick them into the Ground, round &s;uch a Space as they intend for the Bigne&s;s of their Hou&s;e, whether greater or le&s;s; tho&s;e Poles they bend from each Side, and fa&s;ten them together, making an Arch over Head: Then they fa&s;ten &s;mall Sticks to them, cutting the Poles at right Angles, which &s;erve for Ribs.

Head and Neck to the Shoulders; the four Quarters were laid one upon another, and the Skin, doubled Length wi&s;e, was laid upon them, &s;o as to make it look as much like a whole Deer as might be. When this was done, an elderly Man, appointed for that Purpo&s;e, &s;tood up over it; and, with a pretty loud Voice, &s;pake to the following Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>O great God pity us, grant us Food to eat, afford us good and comfortable Sleep, pre&s;erve us from being devoured by the Fowls that &s;ty in the Air.

Then he that made the Offering gave the <HI>pro Tempore</HI> Prie&s;t (for they have no stated one) a String of <HI>Wompum</HI> which was to pay him for his Service; after which he halloo'd again. After the&s;e Ceremonies were ended, the two Men before men|tioned, cut the Deer in Pieces and boil'd it; and when it was made ready, a Piece was given to every one, of which they all eat, except he that offer'd it, (for he eats none of it) which is to &s;ignify it is a Gift, and therefore free, and he de&s;ires none of it back again. While they were eating, one of the Waiters gave the Skin with the Feet, and &s;ome of the Inwards, to an old Widow Woman, which is a Deed of Charity they always practice upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Upon Inquiry into the <HI>Original</HI> of this Piece of Religion, they gave me the following fabulous Account of the fir&s;t In|&s;titution of it. They had receiv'd it by Tradition from their Fathers, that there once liv'd a Man among them, who was &s;een to come down from Heaven with <HI>Snow-Shoes</HI> on, (which was the Original of <HI>Snow-Shoes,</HI>) that he liv'd in great Repu|tation among them: was esteem'd a <HI>Hero,</HI> and a <HI>Prophet</HI>: He clear'd their Country of Mon&s;ters that infe&s;ted theirRoads, and taught them that this was a religious Cu&s;tom in the Coun|try above, from whence he came; and of him they learnt this Piece of Religion. That he married a Wi&s;e. among them, and had two Children by her; and that when they offer'd a <HI>Deer,</HI> he us'd to be their Prie&s;t: but &s;ome Times he omitted pray|ing upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions, which the <HI>Indians</HI> found Fault with, and this coming to the Ears of his Wife, &s;he inform'd him; he confe&s;&s;ed it a faulty Neglect, and apologizing, as well as
<PB N="13" REF="007023_0018_102AEA64B33131B0">
he could, for him&s;elf, promis'd he would do it next Time. And accordingly, when the next Occa&s;ion offer'd, he began to pray with his two Children upon his Knees, and was in a wonderful Manner rais'd from the Ground, ri&s;ing gradually as he continued praying: but when he had got ju&s;t to the Top of the <HI>Wigwam,</HI> they call'd to him to leave one of his Children, at lea&s;t, behind him; and letting one down, he was carried up out of their Sight. This Child of his al&s;o prov'd an ex|traordinary Man; of whom they tell &s;everal very ridiculous Stories; which yet they believe with a firm Faith.</P></Q>
<P>The above Hi&s;torical Account I have not in&s;erted &s;o much for its being curious, as to excite Compa&s;&s;ion towards &s;uch ig|norant Creatures, and the charitable Endeavours of generous Minds to bring them out of &s;uch a benighted State.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 5th. Mr. SERGEANT began to keep School, in the School Hou&s;e which the <HI>Indians</HI> had built; and on the next Week his Scholars were in Number 22 or 23, as he writes; and on the following Week two new Scholars were added to their Number. The&s;e he in&s;tructed on the Week Days, and preach'd on the Sabbaths.</P>
<P>The following Pa&s;&s;ages, in Mr. SERGEANT's <HI>Journal,</HI> well de|&s;erve the Attention of tho&s;e who are concern'd for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t in <HI>America,</HI> and for the &s;piritual Good of the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<Q>Monday, <HI>November</HI> the 25th. I went to <HI>Albany,</HI> being de&s;ir'd by the Mini&s;ters of the Country, to inquire after the Di&s;|po&s;ition of the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> and the Re&s;t of the <HI>Indians</HI> in Friend|&s;hip with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> towards the Chri&s;tian Religion; carrying a Letter from the Rev. Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Hatfield,</HI> to the Hon. <HI>Philip Living&s;ton,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to de&s;ire of him Information in that Matter. Mr. <HI>Living&s;ton</HI> told me there was great Probability that the Prote&s;tant Religion might, if proper Means were us'd, be introduc'd among mo&s;t of tho&s;e Nations; and he look'd upon it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in Order to pre&s;erve the Trade with them, and keep them in Friend&s;hip with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> for the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Canada</HI> were very indu&s;trious to gain them over to their Intere&s;t; and that they have <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionaries</HI> among them, who came as near to their Government as they dare; that the <HI>Indians</HI> are drawn off, more or le&s;s, every Year to <HI>Canada.</HI> Much the &s;ame Account other Gentlemen gave me.
<PB N="14" REF="007023_0019_102AEA66AD39F508">
&mdash;Mr. <HI>Barclay,</HI> an ingenious and religious young Gentleman, has been about a Year and a half among the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> and is learning their Language, and de&s;igns to get <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Ordi|nation, to be a <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionary</HI> among them, if the <HI>Society for propa|gating the Go&s;pel</HI> in <HI>foreign Parts</HI> will &s;upport him. He has allow'd him a &s;mall Encouragement from the Government for two Years, <HI>thirty Pound</HI> per Annum. I &s;aw him little more than half a Year ago, at this Place, when he told me he had all the Encouragement that could be expected from the <HI>Indians</HI>; had wrought &s;ome con&s;iderable Reformation in their Morals; and that they lov'd him entirely. The <HI>Mohawks</HI> are generally Profe&s;&s;ors of <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI>; but, for Want of In&s;truction, have but little of it in Reality. And, methinks, it is great Pity &s;o ingenious and worthy a Gentleman as Mr. <HI>Barclay</HI> &s;hould want any Encouragement, in &s;o great and noble an Undertaking. He now reads to them every Lord's Day the Prayers in the Liturgy, which are tran&s;lated into their Language, with &s;ome Le&s;&s;ons out of the <HI>New-Testament,</HI> be&s;ides &s;ome Manu|&s;cript Di&s;cour&s;es, made by a former <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionary,</HI> which he has got. But he has no &s;tated Interpreter, and when he has Occa|&s;ion for one, is oblig'd to pay him out of his own Pocket. In a Word, he is alone in that noble De&s;ign.</Q>
<P>Mr. SERGEANT left the <HI>College,</HI> de&s;igning to return to it again, as has been ob&s;erv'd. The Rev. Mr. <HI>Stephen Williams,</HI> there|fore, and &s;ome others, being very de&s;irous that the <HI>Indians</HI> might be in&s;tructed, while Mr. SERGEANT was ab&s;ent, prevail'd with Mr. <HI>Timothy Woodbridge</HI> of <HI>Springfield,</HI> to go to them. And when Mr. SERGEANT return'd from his forementioned <HI>Journey,</HI> he writes thus. <Q>Upon my Return from <HI>Albany,</HI> (<HI>which was on Saturday November</HI> 30th) I found Mr. <HI>Timothy Woodbridge,</HI> a young Gentleman very well qualify'd for the Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ent up here, to take Care of the <HI>School,</HI> and to in&s;truct the <HI>Indians</HI> in a Catechetical Way, when I &s;hould return to my Bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>College.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Tho' Things had &s;ucceeded hitherto according to Mr. SER|GEANT's De&s;ires, yet the Week before he return'd to <HI>College,</HI> he met with &s;ome Things very di&s;couraging, of which he gives the following Account in his <HI>Journal.</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="15" REF="007023_0020_102AEA68988C5128"><P><HI>Lord's Day, December</HI> 8th. I had but very few Hearers the Rea&s;on of which was, that &s;ome of the Traders had been down from <HI>Hudjon's</HI> River, and brought a large Quantity of <HI>Rum,</HI> and fold to the <HI>Indians,</HI> with which they got drunk, and con|tinued &s;o for &s;everal Days, and had not got over it by the <HI>Sab|bath.</HI> This was the mo&s;t di&s;couraging Week I had. For the <HI>Dutch</HI> Traders, I was told, had been very indu&s;trious to di&s;|courage the <HI>Indians</HI> from being <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> thinking it would le&s;&s;en their Trade with them, or at lea&s;t they &s;hould not be under &s;o good Advantages to cheat and impo&s;e upon them. For they make va&s;t Profit by &s;elling them <HI>Rum,</HI> and making Bargains with them when they are drunk; and Drunkenne&s;s is a Vice the <HI>Indians</HI> are extremely addicted to. The&s;e Traders tell them, that the <HI>Religion</HI> we are about to teach them, is not a good one; that we de&s;ign in the End to &s;erve our&s;elves by them, to make Slaves of them and their Children, and the like. They al&s;o took Occa&s;ion, from the law there is in this <HI>Pro|vince,</HI> again&s;t private Per&s;ons &s;elling the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;trong Drink, to prejudice them again&s;t the <HI>Government</HI> and <HI>People</HI>; as tho' we were not their <HI>Friends.</HI> Upon the&s;e In&s;inuations, I under|&s;tood &s;ome of the <HI>Indians</HI> were very much di&s;gu&s;ted &amp; affront|ed; that the <HI>Lieutenant</HI> was out of Humour; that his Brother e&s;pecially was in a great Pa&s;&s;ion, who is a con&s;iderable Man among them.</P>
<P>Upon this Information I de&s;ir'd the <HI>Captain</HI> and <HI>Lieutenant</HI> to come to my Landlords on Lord's Day Evening, (de&s;igning the next Day to leave them) Accordingly they came, and I endeavour'd to remove tho&s;e Prejudices, and to per&s;uade them tho&s;e In&s;inuations were utterly groundle&s;s and fal&s;e; that the Traders doubtle&s;s were the Men that intended to make a Prey of them, and their Children; and labour'd to &s;atisfy them, that the foremention'd Law was de&s;ign'd in their Favour, to prevent their abu&s;ing them&s;elves, and expo&s;ing them&s;elves to the Abu&s;es of others; that the Government did not de&s;ign to prevent their having &s;trong Drink; for in other Places &s;ome tru&s;ty Per&s;ons have had Commi&s;&s;ions to &s;ell them Liquor, and other Things they wanted, at the &s;ame Rate they go at in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and Orders to allow them the &s;ame Price for their Goods as they would fetch at <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> With what I &s;aid they
<PB N="16" REF="007023_0021_102AEA6A640CCE38">
&s;eem'd well &s;atisfied; e&s;pecially <HI>Kunkapot</HI>; for he &s;aw thro' the De&s;ign of the Traders. And as he is a temperate Man him&s;elf, &s;o he is very much griev'd at the Intemperance of his People; and tho' he be calm and moderate in his Temper, yet he &s;hew'd con&s;derable Warmth and Pa&s;&s;ion at the wicked and ungenerous Treatment of the Traders.</P></Q>
<P>The Neighbourhood of the <HI>Dutch</HI> to the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> has often prov'd a Di&s;advantage and Snare to them, and it is to be fear'd will prove &s;o &s;till; for the <HI>Indians</HI> have often Occa&s;ion to go among them upon Bu&s;ine&s;s, and to vi&s;it their Brethren: Upon tho&s;e Occa&s;ions the <HI>Dutch</HI> do not fail of tempting them to Drunk|enne&s;s, it there is any Pro&s;pect of their finding their Account in it; and 'tis to be fear'd &s;ome of them tempt them to Exce&s;s, on Purpo&s;e to di&s;appoint the De&s;ign of <HI>Chri&s;tianizing</HI> them. And, without Doubt, the many Relap&s;es into Intemperance that have appear'd among the <HI>Indians,</HI> after their Profe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Christianity</HI> (of which have happen'd too many In&s;tances) have been owing to the wicked Practice of the <HI>Dutch.</HI> And as if other Temp|tations were not enough, they too often recommend Drunken|ne&s;s to them by their own Example.</P>
<P>The Time was now come, when Mr. SERGEANT was oblig'd to return to his Bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>College</HI>; and, as a proper Expedient to forward the De&s;ign he was now engaged in, he propos'd to take two <HI>Indian</HI> Children with him, intending thereby to lead them into &s;ome Acquaintance with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Language and Manners. And the efore, at the Clo&s;e of the Conference he had with the <HI>Captain</HI> and <HI>Lieutenant,</HI> mentioned above, he propos'd it to them. And in his <HI>Journal</HI> gives this Account of the Matter.</P>
<Q><P>Then I a&s;k'd them if they would let two of their Children go, and live with me at <HI>New-Haven</HI> the Re&s;t of the Winter; and they agreed that the <HI>Captain</HI>'s only Son <HI>Nungkawwat,</HI> and the <HI>Lieutenant's</HI> olde&s;t Son <HI>Etowaukaum,</HI> (who by the Way is Grand&s;on by his Mother to <HI>Etowaukaum,</HI> Chief of the <HI>River|Indians,</HI> who was in <HI>England</HI> in Queen <HI>Ann</HI>'s Reign) should be the Children. They were both young; <HI>Nungkawwat</HI> about nine Years old; <HI>Etowaukaum</HI> about eight: Yet they were not only willing to go with me, they knew not whither, but had a Mind to it. And the next Morning, Monday <HI>December</HI> the 9th, we &s;et out for <HI>New-Haven,</HI> leaving Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> in the
<PB N="17" REF="007023_0022_102AEA6CCE62B958">
School. The Boys went away with very good Courage, and held out a long and tedious Journey in a cold Sea&s;on, with wonderful Re&s;olution.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 14th. We got to <HI>New-Haven.</HI> I took the Boys into my own Chamber at <HI>College,</HI> and &s;ent them to the free School kept at <HI>New-Haven.</HI> They liv'd very contentedly, were much made off by every Body; for <HI>indeed</HI> they were a couple of very likely Boys, e&s;pecially the <HI>Lieutenant</HI>'s Son.</P></Q>
<P>The prudent Mea&s;ures Mr. SERGEANT took with the <HI>Indians,</HI> the little Time he &s;pent with them before his Return to <HI>College</HI>; the Succe&s;s had; the Hopes he conceiv'd of being further ser|viceable to them; together with the Oppo&s;ition he met with in pro&s;ecuting his good De&s;ign; the Reader may be&s;t learn from the following Letter which he wrote to the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners,</HI> &s;oon after he got to <HI>New-Haven,</HI> (how &s;oon I am not certain, for the Copy of it before me, has no Date) and directed it to the Honourable <HI>Adam Winthrop,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> their Secretary.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honourable Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>Your Honour's</HI> of <HI>November</HI> 13th I received at <HI>Westfield,</HI> in my Return from <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk.</HI> 'Tis no &s;mall Satisfaction to me, that <HI>your Honour,</HI> with the Re&s;t of the Honourable and Reverend <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners,</HI> are pleas'd to entertain a good Opinion of me. I have had the Approbation of my Con&s;cience in the Bu&s;ine&s;s I have undertaken, nor have I been at all di&s;contented. Thro' the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, the De&s;ign has hitherto &s;ucceeded full to my Expectation, excepting that I have not had quite &s;o many Auditors as I hop'd to have (there being generally about 30.) There has been about 25 Scholars in the School, be&s;ides &s;ome older ones, who took &s;ome Pains to learn the Letters; but I &s;uppo&s;e their Patience will hardly hold out to learn to read well. They have always treated me with Re&s;pect &amp; Kindne&s;s, in their Way. The Children in the School, I think, were fond of me, and they all &s;eem'd to put great Confidence in me, and what I believe you will think a &s;ufficient Evidence of it, is, I have brought a Way with me too little Boys, One is Capt. <HI>Kunkapot</HI>'s only Son, nam'd <HI>Nungkawwat,</HI> about nine Years old; the other is Lieut. <HI>Umpachenee</HI>'s elde&s;t Son <HI>Etowaukaum,</HI> about eight Years old.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="007023_0023_102AEA6F70DB1480">The Lads had a great Mind to come with me, and their Parents were very willing they &s;hould. They bore the Fatigues of the Journey well, and have been very contented &s;ince they have been here. My De&s;ign in bringing them is to teach them <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and to learn <HI>Indian</HI> of them, as well as I can, I de|&s;ign to keep them, untill I return to <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> in the Town School; for my Time is &s;o taken up with College Bu&s;ine&s;s, that I cannot teach them my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I could not have the Opinion of the Gentlemen <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI>: but I doubt not but what I have done will be grateful to them. However, I did not de&s;ign they &s;hould be burden&s;ome to the <HI>Society,</HI> and hope to find &s;o much Charity among&s;t Gentlemen in the&s;e Parts, as to bear the Charges of their Board and Schooling. They are two very likely Lads, and, if I do not judge ami&s;s, the <HI>Indian</HI> Children excell the generality of ours, in Pregnancy of Parts and good Humour, I am &s;ure I could not have found an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> School, any where, that would have pleas'd me &s;o much. Capt. <HI>Kunkapot</HI> is an excellent Man, and I do believe has the true Spirit of <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> in him. He knows a great Deal, and by the Character all his Acquaintance give of him, his Conduct is unexceptionable. I found them generally po&s;&s;e&s;t with the Belief of <HI>One Supreme Being,</HI> the Maker and Governor of all Things, and that they acknowledg'd the Difference between <HI>moral Good</HI> and <HI>Evil</HI>; that God regards the Actions of Mankind, in order to reward or puni&s;h them, in &s;ome future State of Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>I have endeavour'd to give them right Notions of the&s;e Matters, and to e&s;tabli&s;h them in the Belief of them. And from the&s;e Principles, together with &s;uch other Arguments as I thought mo&s;t convincing to them, to per&s;uade them of the Nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;upernatural <HI>Revelation,</HI> and to &s;atisfy them that this is contain'd in the <HI>Holy Scriptures.</HI> I de&s;ir'd them from Time to Time to let me know, if they had any Doubts with Re&s;pect to any Thing I had taught them, or they had other|wi&s;e heard, of the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion. But tho' they were in|qui&s;itive in &s;ome Points, yet they never &s;eem'd di&s;pos'd to contradict what I &s;aid.</P>
<P>I have (after I had in &s;everal Di&s;cour&s;es told them what I thought previously nece&s;&s;ary given them a brief Account of
<PB N="19" REF="007023_0024_102AEA70FB2FD718">
the Original of Things; the State of Mankind at the fir&s;t; the Fall and unhappy Con&s;equences of it; the mo&s;t remark|able Di&s;pen&s;ations of divine Providence recorded in the old Testament; God's chu&s;ing a peculiar People to him&s;elf; his mo&s;t remarkable Dealings with them till his final Rejection of them; a &s;hort Hi&s;tory of our Saviours Births Life, Actions, and Death; an Account of his Doctrines, and Precepts: In every Di&s;cour&s;e making &s;uch practical Reflections, as I tho't convenient for them. They were generally all pre&s;ent that liv'd thereabout , and gave very good Attention.</P>
<P>After they had fini&s;h'd the School-Hou&s;e (which was in the Beginning of <HI>November</HI>) they mov'd to that Place with their Families, where they now live. The Scholars in the School make very good Proficiency. I &s;uppo&s;e the Gen|tlemen <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> are before now inform'd of Mr. <HI>Woodbridge's</HI> Character, and the Rea&s;on of putting him into the School, &amp;c, The Children began to be fond of him before I came away. There is a fair Pro&s;pect of considerable Things being done among them. I found Nothing on the Part of the <HI>Indians</HI> but what was encouraging, except their Inclina|tion to &s;trong Drink. But from other People there are many Di&s;couragements. They are a loo&s;e vicious People they live among, and there are &s;ome &s;o prodigiou&s;sly wicked as to en|deavour all they can to di&s;courage them; e&s;pecially the <HI>Dutch</HI> Traders, who&s;e <HI>Gain is</HI> all their <HI>Godline&s;s</HI>; and this poor Peo|ple's Ignorance and Vice is their Gain: They trade with them very much in <HI>Rum,</HI> which is the De&s;truction of every Thing that's good among them. To di&s;courage them they tell them, that our Religion is not a good one, and that we de&s;ign only to make Slaves of them. They take Advantage from the Law of your <HI>Province,</HI> again&s;t &s;elling &s;trong Liquor to them, to prejudice them again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> The Traders them|&s;elves evade the Force of the Law, by leaving their Rum ju&s;t without the Borders of the <HI>Province,</HI> from whence the <HI>Indians</HI> fetch it them&s;elves. The Week before I came away they had a drunken Frolick, which la&s;ted three or four Days. <HI>Kunkapot</HI> always keeps clear of &s;uch Frolicks, and <HI>Umpachenee</HI> had &s;o much the Command of him&s;elf as to refrain at that Time.&mdash; God only knows what may and will be effected; but I am
<PB N="20" REF="007023_0025_102AEA728BCF73E8">
much afraid that the <HI>Dutch</HI> will di&s;courage many of them: for they have great Influence over the <HI>Indians.</HI> As for the old ones, who are much addicted to drinking, nothing but the extraordinary Power, that attended <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> in its fir&s;t Pro|pagation, will be &s;ufficient to reform them. The Young I have great Hopes of, if God is pleas'd to ble&s;s &s;uitable En|deavours with them.</P>
<P>I hop'd they (the <HI>Indians</HI>) would have had a general Meet|ing of the <HI>Tribe,</HI> while I was with them; but their Bu&s;ine&s;s (Hunting) made them defer it till &s;ince I came away; and I &s;uppo&s;e 'tis to be about this Time, What will be concluded in that Meeting will either add Life to our De&s;ign, or almost entirely qua&s;h it.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible I have drawn out this Letter to a very great Length, but if I am tedious, I will not be more &s;o by apolo|gizing for it, but only beg Leave to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf,</P>

<P>This Letter was very acceptable to the <HI>Indians</HI>; and the more &s;o, becau&s;e it came to them a little before a general Meeting of the <HI>River-Indians,</HI> at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> at which they were to con&s;i|der, whether it was be&s;t that the <HI>Indians</HI> there &s;hould go on to receive In&s;truction or not?</P>
<P>It is a Cu&s;tom among the <HI>Indians,</HI> not to proceed in any Affair of Importance, till they have the Con&s;ent of the <HI>&s;everal Clans,</HI> belonging to their Nation; and the <HI>Indians,</HI> at <HI>Hou&s;atun|nuk,</HI> having proceeded &s;o far, without the general Con&s;ent of their <HI>Brethren,</HI> were much concern'd le&s;t they &s;hould be frown'd upon at the approaching Meeting, and the more &s;o, becau&s;e they had heard, that the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s River highly re|&s;ented their receiving a <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> and <HI>School-Master,</HI> before they had gain'd the Approbation of the Re&s;t of their <HI>Tribe</HI>; yea, there was a Report, that a De&s;ign was on Foot to poi&s;on the <HI>Captain</HI> and <HI>Lieutenant,</HI> on that Account; as al&s;o, becau&s;e they had re|ceiv'd <HI>Commi&s;&s;ions</HI> from his Excellency Governor <HI>Belcher.</HI> Whe|ther there was any ju&s;t Ground for the&s;e Reports, or whether they were &s;et on Foot by the <HI>Dutch Traders</HI> to di&s;courage the <HI>Indians,</HI> at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> I am not able to &s;ay. But however that was, the <HI>Indians</HI> were &s;o affected with the&s;e flying Stories, that they &s;ent, de&s;iring &s;ome of the Mini&s;ters of the <HI>County</HI> would come to them, and be pre&s;ent at their <HI>general Meeting.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly, <HI>January</HI> 15th 1734-5, the Rev. Mr. <HI>Stephen Williams</HI> of <HI>Springfield,</HI> and I, accompany'd by <HI>John A&s;hley,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>We&s;tfield,</HI> went to <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk.</HI> The <HI>Indians,</HI> who were expected from <HI>Hud&s;on's River,</HI> came not till Saturday, which was the 19th of the Month.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="007023_0027_102AEA76F0000660">On the Sabbath Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> being de&s;ir'd by the <HI>Captain</HI> and <HI>Lieutenant,</HI> preach'd to the <HI>Indians</HI> by an Interpreter, in Number about 150, or 200, great and &s;mall. I was with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at <HI>Sheffield,</HI> who were then de&s;titute of a Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>To give the Particulars of our Proceedings with tho&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> (a Journal of which the Rev. Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> kept, and is now be|fore me,) would be too prolix. I cho&s;e therefore, for Brevity's Sake, to give the Reader a conci&s;e Account of them, from a Letter which Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> wrote to a Gentleman in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> which was printed in Mr. <HI>Appleton</HI>'s Preface to his <HI>Sermon</HI> preach'd at Mr. SERGEANT's Ordination, and is as follows. <Q>We had diver&s;e Conferences with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and read to them a Let|ter from the honourable JOHN STODDARD, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and endeavour'd to an&s;wer their Objections, &amp;c. and &s;o far &s;atisfy'd tho&s;e that came from other Places, that they thanked us for the Pains we had taken; and de&s;ir'd Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> might continue among them (at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk</HI>) and that Mr. SER|GEANT would return to them; and &s;aid they would give an Account to their &s;everal <HI>Towns,</HI> of what we had offer'd to them: And gave us Encouragement that they would as a Nation &s;ubmit to In&s;truction.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. SERGEANT's Account of what follow'd upon this general Meeting of the <HI>Indians,</HI> I will give in his own Words.</P>
<Q><P>It happen'd as &s;oon as this Meeting [Drinking and Frolick|ing always conclude &s;uch Meetings] was over, that &s;everal of our <HI>Indians</HI> were taken &s;ick; and two Men, &s;eiz'd with a violent Fever, died &s;uddenly. This, with the Apprehen&s;ion they had before of Mi&s;chief, de&s;ign'd by &s;ome of the other <HI>Indians</HI> that came from the neighbouring Government, put them into a great Fright; and made them &s;u&s;pect that tho&s;e Per&s;ons were poi&s;on'd. Tho', I believe, the Su&s;picion was groundle&s;s. For it is &s;o far from being &s;trange to me, that &s;ome are &s;ick after &s;uch a Frolick, that I rather wonder they don't half die. For their <HI>Dancing</HI> is a mo&s;t laborious Exer|ci&s;e. They dance round a hot Fire, till they are almo&s;t rea|dy to faint, and are wet with Sweat; and then run out, and, &s;triping theml&s;elves naked, expo&s;e their Bodies to the cold Air, and, it there be Snow upon the Ground, roll in it till they are cold, and then return to their Dancing again, and when
<PB N="23" REF="007023_0028_102AEA78DD1914D8">
they are hot, and tir'd, cool thems&s;elves in the &s;ame Manner, and, it may be, repeat this four or five Times in a Night: concluding the Frolick with exce&s;&s;ive Drinking. And when they are drunk, often fall a Sleep in the open Air, perhaps buried in Snow.</P>
<P>This general Meeting happen'd in a very cold Sea&s;on, and when there was a very deep Snow upon the Ground. And I could never learn, that there was any certain Symptom of Poi&s;on. However, the <HI>Indians</HI> were per&s;uaded they were poi|&s;on'd, and concluded to apply to &s;ome <HI>invi&s;ible Power</HI> for the Di&s;covery of the Murderers. I &s;hall give an Account of this Matter, as it was related by Mr. <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> in a Letter to Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> in the following Words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of <HI>February</HI> 1734, 5, in the Afternoon, Capt. <HI>Kunkapot</HI> inform'd me, that he was going down to the <HI>Lieu|tenant</HI>'s Wigwam, to find out who poi&s;on'd tho&s;e two Men that lately died there. I tho't of nothing further than that they were going to make a proper Search into the Matter; and therefore &s;aid nothing to di&s;&s;uade him. About Eight of the Clock in the Evening, <HI>Ebenezer</HI> came to me, and told me, they were going to <HI>Pawwaw</HI> (as we call it) that they might di&s;cover the Murderers that Way; for they expected that tho&s;e who did the Fact would appear to their <HI>Prie&s;ts.</HI> I immedi|ately rode down to them, found upwards of 40 <HI>Indians</HI> at the <HI>Lieutenant's Wigwam,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This <HI>Wigwam</HI> of the <HI>Lieutenant</HI>'s, if I mi&s;take not, is about 50 or 60 Feet in Length.</NOTE> which was &s;wept clean, good Fires made up, and the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;eated on each Side of the Fires, from End to End of the <HI>Wigwam,</HI> except a Space of about five or &s;ix Feet, which was left at one End of the <HI>Wig|wam,</HI> for the <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> or <HI>Pawwaws.</HI> Every <HI>Indian</HI> had two Sticks about a Foot and a half long, one of them &s;plit at the End, which they held under their Legs as they fat. When I went in they were all prepar'd for the Exerci&s;e; but had not begun. I a&s;ked them, if they were willing I &s;hould be pre&s;ent to fee their Devotion? And, before they gave me an An&s;wer, the olde&s;t <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> life up his Eyes towards Heaven, and &s;pake very earne&s;tly; after which they told me I might be there.
<PB N="24" REF="007023_0029_102AEA7AA881F6F0">
They began with rapping their Sticks, and &s;inging; their elde&s;t <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> &s;itting, and talking, and acting a different Part from the Re&s;t, <HI>This continu'd about an Hour.</HI> Then the <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> ro&s;e up, and threw off all his Cloaths, except the Flap that cover'd his Nakedne&s;s: And then, naked, pa&s;s'd from one End of the <HI>Wigwam</HI> to the other, with his Eyes fa&s;t &s;hut, &s;eeming to be in the utmo&s;t Agony; u&s;ed all the frightful Motions and di&s;torted Ge&s;tures imaginable. <HI>This continu'd about another Hour.</HI> Then the fir&s;t <HI>Priest,</HI> being beat out, retir'd, and a &s;econd ro&s;e, and acted the &s;ame Part; &s;o a third, and a fourth. <HI>This</HI> continu'd all Night, without any Inter|mi&s;&s;ion, except &s;ome &s;hort Intervals, in which they &s;moak'd a Pipe; and &s;ome Times, for a &s;hort Space, they all got up and danc'd.</P></Q>
<P><Q>After I had &s;een the&s;e Things, (which it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe) I took an Opportunity to inform them, how improper &s;uch a Method of Wor&s;hip was; how &s;inful &amp; di&s;plea&s;ing to the great God. Upon which they told me, they knew no Harm in it; they made their Application to the great God, and to no other. I informed them, that God was not to be wor&s;hip'd in &s;uch a Manner. And when I had in&s;tructed them as well as I could, they re&s;olv'd never to do &s;o any more: And tho&s;e of them who had been be&s;t taught were much troubled, that they had taken &s;o wrong a Step.</Q> Thus far Mr. <HI>Woodbridge.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. SERGEANT goes on and ob&s;erves, that the <HI>Indians</HI> us'd to to have an high Opinion of the&s;e <HI>Pawwaws,</HI> (who&s;e Character an&s;wers pretty well to the vulgar Notions of <HI>Wizards</HI> and <HI>Con|jurers</HI>) and tell Stories of the great Feats which they can do. However, they confe&s;s they have no Power over <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> And concludes with the&s;e Words. <Q>There may be &s;omething, for ought I know, in what they &s;ay: But I am apt to think, they are very much impos'd upon by &s;uch kind of Pretenders, as the Re&s;t of the ignorant Part of the World is.</Q></P>
<P>In the Beginning of <HI>February, Ebenezer</HI> vi&s;ited Mr. SERGEANT at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> by whom he wrote another Letter to the <HI>Indians.</HI> Some Pa&s;&s;ages of which are as follows.</P>

<P>I am very glad to hear that you are all well, and that all Things go well with you.

<P>I hope you will be a wi&s;e and knowing People, and that you will learn to know the <HI>true God,</HI> the Maker of all Things, and the Governor of them; and to know <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> the Son of God, and Saviour of Men.&mdash;It cannot be long before both you and I mu&s;t die, and give an Account of our&s;elves to the great God, who is high above all.&mdash;Oh! how &s;hall we blame our&s;elves for ever, if we neglect our pre&s;ent Opportu|tunity of preparing our&s;elves for Death! But on the contrary, how glad &s;hall we be, even to die, that we may go to <HI>God,</HI> and to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> who died for us, if we are careful now to plea&s;e God, and to prepare our&s;elves for Heaven! O that I could make you &s;en&s;ible of the Importance of the&s;e Things! I hope to &s;ee you again, and to in&s;truct you more fully in the&s;e Things: But in the mean Time, I pray you, for your Soul's Sake, to embrace the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion, and make u&s;e of the Advantages God gives you to learn the Truth, and to obey it.

</LETTER>
<P>About the Middle of <HI>February</HI> is the Time, when the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Housatunnuk</HI> leave their Habitation, and go, with their Fami|lies into the Woods, to make their Year's Stock of <HI>Sugar</HI>; and the Sea&s;on for this Bu&s;ine&s;s la&s;ts till the End of <HI>March,</HI> and &s;ome Times to the Middle of <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="007023_0031_102AEA7F566DC688">Therefore, when the <HI>Indians</HI> went into the Woods, and took their Children with them, Mr. <HI>Wood<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ridge</HI> their Shool-Ma&s;ter, made a Vi&s;it to his Friends at <HI>Springfield.</HI> By him the <HI>Indians</HI> wrote a Letter to &s;ome of the Mini&s;ters of the <HI>County</HI>; inform|ing them, that tho' their Bu&s;ine&s;s now call'd them, with their Families, abroad; yet, in a little Time, they &s;hould return again with their Families to their Habitations, and receive further In|&s;truction; and de&s;ir'd, that their Remove might not be interpre|ted, as tho' they were di&s;affected to the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion; and expre&s;s'd their Re&s;olution to proceed in it, and to u&s;e their further Endeavours to increa&s;e in <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Knowledge, when they &s;hould return from their Bu&s;ine&s;s of making Sugar.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The <HI>Indians</HI> make their <HI>Sugar</HI> of the Sap of <HI>Maple Trees.</HI> They extract the Sap by cutting the Tree on one Side, in &s;uch a Form as that the Sap will naturally gather into a &s;mall Channel at the Bottom of the Hole cut; where they fix into the Tree a &s;mall Chip, of 6 or 8 Inches long, which carries the Sap off from the Tree, into a Ve&s;&s;el &s;et to receive it. Thus they tap a Number of Trees; and, when the Ve&s;&s;els are full, they gather the Sap, and boil it to &s;uch a Degree of Con&s;i&s;tence, as to make <HI>Sugar.</HI> After it is boil'd, they take it off the Fire, and &s;tir it till it is cold, which is their Way of <HI>graining</HI> it. The <HI>Sugar</HI> is very good, of a very agreable Ta&s;te, and e&s;teem|ed the mo&s;t whole&s;ome of any. It might doubtle&s;s be made in great Plenty; and, I cannot but think, to the great Profit of the Undertakers. If &s;ome Man would build him a <HI>Sugar-Hou&s;e</HI> and provide a &s;et of <HI>Boilers,</HI> and other Uten&s;ils as they have in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> I am per&s;uaded he would find his Account in it, beyond what tho&s;e in the <HI>West-Indies</HI> can do. For the Gen|tleman, who hath a Plantation in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> is at great Expence in pre|paring his Ground; planting his <HI>Cane,</HI> and cultivating it for more than a Year, before it is fit for U&s;e: in cutting, triming, and toping it; for Mills to grind it; and not till all this be done is the Sap of the <HI>Cane</HI> ready for boiling. All this Charge might be &s;ub&s;tracted from the Gentleman's Account, who u&s;es <HI>Maple Trees</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Cane,</HI> except the Expence of taping the Trees, and gathering the Sap, which is as nothing compar'd with the other.</P>
<P>It is true indeed, that the Sap of <HI>Maple Trees</HI> is not &s;o rich as that of the Sugar <HI>Cane</HI>; but I &s;uppo&s;e the Di&s;proportion is not <HI>by far</HI> &s;o great as that of the Expence For, I have been inform'd that two Men, under the Di&s;advan|tage of boiling it in two Kettles, and in the open Air, have, in a good Sea|&s;on, made a Barrel in a Week. What then would a Number of Hands do, with a Sett of <HI>We&s;t-India Boilers, Coolers,</HI> and other Advantages of Di&s;patch, which they are furni&s;h'd with? Trees &s;it for this Bu&s;ine&s;s are very plenty, in the va&s;t uncultivated Wilderne&s;s between <HI>Connecticut</HI> and <HI>Hudton's</HI> Rivers, as al&s;o in all the Northern Borders of this Province And, could the one Half of them be used, I &s;uppo&s;e they would more than furni&s;h all the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies upon the <HI>Continent</HI> with <HI>Sugar</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mola&s;&s;es</HI> that is made of this Sap it exceeding good, and con&s;iderably re&s;embles <HI>Houry.</HI> Three, or, at mo&s;t, four Barrels of this Sap reduc'd to one, by boiling, will ferment, and makes a very plea&s;ant Drink, which is &s;ufficiently <HI>&s;pirituous</HI>; and, &s;uppo&s;e, by being di&s;till'd, would make excellent <HI>Rum</HI>; tho' the Experiment has not, that I know of, been yet made.</P>
<P>The Trees, after they have been us'd 3 or 4 Years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, mu&s;t then re&s;t as many Years; and after they are recruited &s;erve again, as well, or better than ever. The &s;econd and third Years they are better than the fir&s;t, be|cau&s;e then the Sap is richer than at fir&s;t, tho' not quite &s;o plenteous.</P>
<P>The Sea&s;on for this Bu&s;ine&s;s is from the Beginning of <HI>February</HI> to the End of <HI>March.</HI> A Time when People are as much at Lei&s;ure as ever.</P>
<P>Would it not therefore be prudent, for tho&s;e who have a &s;ufficient Number of the&s;e Trees, on their new Farms, to &s;pare them, and u&s;e them from Year to Year, to &s;upply them&s;elves with tho&s;e Commodities?</P></NOTE></P>

<P><HI>May</HI> the 8th, Mr. SERGEANT left <HI>New-Haven</HI> (tho&s;e Men accompanying him) and got to <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk</HI> on the 10th, at Night.</P>

<SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Though I am not &s;o happy as to have much per&s;onal Ac|quaintance with you, yet your known Character in general, and e&s;pecially your Relation to the Affair I have been engag'd in, has made me hope, I &s;hall have your Pardon for the Trouble I now give you.</P>
<P>Tis but lately I return'd from <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk</HI> and I doubt not, but you will rejoice to be inform'd of the happy Succe&s;s, God has been plea&s;s'd to ble&s;s the Endeavours with, that have been us'd to convert the <HI>Heathen</HI> there to the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Faith. The De&s;ign has hitherto &s;ucceeded beyond Expectation. They are, I think, now re&s;olv'd to be <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and are earne&s;tly de&s;irous to be taught. The Fondne&s;s they &s;hew for me is &s;urprizing; and con&s;idering how much a Stranger I am to them, their own barbarous Education, and how little I have
<PB N="29" REF="007023_0034_102AEA84F46EBAC0">
done to win them, there appears &s;omething more than humane in it. And I think they are now in a better Di&s;po&s;ition than I left them in la&s;t Fall.</P>
<P>I am very willing (if the Gentlemen <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> plea&s;e) to devote my Life to the Service of their Souls. And if God &s;hall give Succe&s;s in it, it will be the greate&s;t Satisfaction to me.&mdash;There is now, and I hope will be, Work enough for two; I hope therefore Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> will be maintain'd there with me.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, that <HI>one Hundred Pounds</HI> will but ju&s;t pay the nece&s;&s;ary Charges of living; for the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life are, and mu&s;t be, dear in this remote Part of the Country. But I make my&s;elf ea&s;y in the Matter, a&s;&s;uring my&s;elf, that (if there be any Money) the Gentlemen betru&s;ted with the Affair will do what is rea&s;onable. Money alone is no Temptation to me, at all, to devote my&s;elf to &s;uch a Lite; yet I think it but rea&s;onable to expect to be &s;upported, &s;o as to have no other Care, than the Bu&s;ine&s;s I &s;hall go upon.</P>
<P>Some of the <HI>Indians</HI> (I perceive) have a Mind to be <HI>baptiz'd. Kunkapot,</HI> e&s;pecially, who appears to me well qualify'd for it.

It will be upon all Accounts mo&s;t proper and convenient. And may you have a more abundant Entrance given you, among the <HI>Heathen,</HI> when you return to them.</P>
<P>I have taken Leave, this Morning, to in&s;ert in a Letrer to a Gentleman in <HI>London,</HI> a Copy of your's to me.

</LETTER>
<P><HI>July,</HI> the 1&s;t 1735. Mr. SERGEANT (having di&s;mi&s;s'd his Cla&s;s at <HI>College</HI>) left <HI>New-Haven,</HI> intending to &s;pend the Re&s;t of the Summer, and indeed of his Life, with the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Hou&s;atun|nuk,</HI> where he arrived on the 5th, and the next Sabbath preach'd to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> there being no Interpreter pre&s;ent. And he, with Mr. <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> went on to keep the School, as before; one above, the other below, changing Place every Week.</P>
<Q><HI>Lord's-Day, July</HI> 13th. Preach'd to the <HI>Indians,</HI> few in Number&mdash;No Man pre&s;ent except <HI>Kunkapot,</HI> who was very much affected, weeping almo&s;t all the Time. The Men were gone into <HI>New-York</HI> Government, to reap for the <HI>Dutch</HI> Peo|ple there.</Q>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> reaping for the <HI>Dutch</HI> does not turn to their Ad|vantage, (tho' it might, if they had Prudcnce to &s;ave their Wages) but proves a Snare to them. For (as Mr. SERGEANT ob&s;erves in his Journal) when the Harve&s;t is over, the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Hud&s;on's|River</HI> drink up all their Wages. But he had the Plea&s;ure to hear that <HI>Winampee,</HI> one of his Hearers, on this Occa&s;ion, over|came the Temptation, and told the <HI>Indians,</HI> at <HI>Hud&s;on's-River,</HI> plainly, that the de&s;ign'd to go to Heaven, and therefore mu&s;t leave off &s;uch Wickedne&s;s. But &s;ome of them, to his great Grief, did not come off &s;o well. Neither is it to be wondered at, that Men, who for a long Cour&s;e of Years, have addicted them&s;elves to Exce&s;s, &s;hould be overcome, when &s;uch Tempta|tions are laid before them by their Brethren, and urg'd on by others for the Sake of Gain.</P>
<P>The Pains &s;ome of the <HI>Hon&s;atunnuk Indians</HI> have taken to cure them&s;elves of this ill Habit, has been very great. And &s;ome In&s;tances there have been of Per&s;ons among them, who, when &s;trong Drink has been offer'd them, have refus'd to <HI>ta&s;te</HI> of it, giving this as a Rea&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> that if they <HI>once ta&s;te,</HI> they are in the utmo&s;t Danger of exceeding the Bounds of Temperance.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="007023_0037_102AEA8B666521D0"><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the 13th. Mr. SERGEANT receiv'd a Letter from the honourable <HI>Adam Winthrop,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> informing him, chat at a Meet|ing of the <HI>Comi&s;&s;ioners</HI> it was propos'd, and agreed to, that he &s;hould be <HI>ordain'd</HI> at <HI>Deerfield,</HI> when his Excellency Governor <HI>Belcher</HI> &s;hould come thither, upon a Treaty with the <HI>Indians</HI> of &s;everal <HI>Tribes,</HI> who were to meet him at that Place. The <HI>In|dians</HI> of <HI>Hon&s;atunnuk,</HI> being &s;ent for by the Governor, &s;et out for <HI>Deerfield,</HI> about the 18th of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> But Mr. SERGEANT was then in Doubt whether he &s;hould be able to go; as he was taken a few Days before with the intermitting Fever, <HI>the common Di&s;|temper of all new Comers to</HI> Hou&s;atunnuk. But on the 26th of the Month, he was &s;o far recover'd of his Illne&s;s, that he &s;et out for <HI>Deerfield,</HI> and was there <HI>ordained</HI> on the Sabbath following.</P>
<P>The Account I find of Mr. SERGEANT's <HI>Ordination,</HI> in his own Journal, is only this.</P>
<P><HI>Lord's-Day, Augu&s;t</HI> 31&s;t 1735. I was <HI>ordain'd</HI> at <HI>Deerfield.</HI> I &s;hall therefore give the Reader an Account of that Solemnity, as I find it in the Preface of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Appleton</HI>'s Sermon, preach'd on that Occa&s;ion, and in what is annex'd at the End of &s;aid Sermon.&mdash;</P>
<Q>&mdash;And as it was thought highly proper, according to Mr. SERGEANT's Propo&s;al, that he &s;hould be <HI>ordained,</HI> &s;o his Excel|lency the <HI>Governor,</HI> who is at the Head of the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners,</HI> was pleas'd &s;o to order the Matter, as to have a very favour|able Opportunity for it; for his Excellency, having propos'd a Treaty with &s;ome of the <HI>Indian Tribes,</HI> at <HI>Deerfield,</HI> gave Orders to the <HI>Indians,</HI> at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> to meet him there. Accordingly, the <HI>Governor,</HI> attended with a large <HI>Committee</HI> of His <HI>Majesty's Council,</HI> and <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> of <HI>Repre&s;entatives,</HI> and many other Gentlemen, was at <HI>Deerfield</HI> on <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 25th. And that Week being taken up in the Treaty with the <HI>Indians,</HI> in rati|fying the Peace and Friend&s;hip between us and them, and in giving and receiving the u&s;ual Pledges of it; and Mr. SER|GEANT not coming to Town, till Friday Evening, it was judg'd proper to have the <HI>Ordination</HI> on the <HI>Lord's-Day,</HI> which was accordingly carried on, in the Forenoon of &s;aid Day, by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Hatfield,</HI> and other Mini&s;ters then pre|&s;ent, at the De&s;ire, and in the Pre&s;ence of His <HI>Excellency</HI> and the <HI>honourable Gentlanen</HI> of the <HI>General Court,</HI> and tho&s;e that
<PB N="33" REF="007023_0038_102AEA8D2A282128">
attended him thither, together with the A&s;&s;embly of
<HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> u&s;ually meeting in that Place, and many of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who were grave Spectators of the Solemnity, and the <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk Indians,</HI> who &s;at by them&s;elves, and attended throughout the whole Service with great Seriou&s;ne&s;s; and were much pleas'd to &s;ee one they had &s;uch a Love for, &s;o &s;olemnly &s;eperated to the Service of their Souls.</Q>
<P>As an Introdudlion to the <HI>Ordination,</HI> the Rev. Mr. <HI>William Williams</HI> of <HI>Hatfield</HI> made a Speech to His Excellency the <HI>Go|vernor,</HI> in which he took Notice of God's inclining the Hearts or &s;ome generous Per&s;ons in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> by their charitable Donations, to &s;eek the Salvation of the benighted <HI>Heathen</HI>; and of it's being &s;ubmited to the Direction of an honourable <HI>Corpo|ration there</HI>; and that by them a Number of Honourable and Reverend <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> (of which His Excellency is at the Head) were here appointed for the &s;ame End; and of their having found a &s;uitable Per&s;on for the In&s;truction of the <HI>Indians,</HI> of which tho&s;e at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk</HI> were de&s;irous: And humbly a&s;k'd, if it were His <HI>Excellency</HI>'s Plea&s;ure, that the Pa&s;tors then con|ven'd &s;hould proceed to &s;et him a-part for that Work.</P>
<P>To which His <HI>Excellency</HI> manife&s;ted his Approbation.</P>
<P>Then he ob&s;erv'd to Mr. SERGEANT, that he now under&s;tood His <HI>Excellency,</HI> in the Name of the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners,</HI> de&s;ir'd him to take upon him the <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> and Service of a <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionary</HI> to the <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk-Indians</HI>; and a&s;k'd him, if he were willing to de|vote him&s;elf to that Work?</P>
<P>To which Mr. SERGEANT gave his Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ordination</HI> then was proceeded in. And after the <HI>Fellow&s;&s;ip of Elders</HI> was given, the Rev. Mr. <HI>Stephen Williams</HI> of <HI>Springfield,</HI> by an Interpreter, a&s;k'd the <HI>Indians,</HI> if they were willing to re|ceive Mr. SERGEANT, thus &s;olemnly &s;et a-part to the Work, as their <HI>Teacher?</HI></P>
<P>To which they manife&s;ted their Willingne&s;s by ri&s;ing up.</P>
<P>After the &s;hort Account Mr. SERGEANT gave of his Ordina|tion, as above, he in his Journal adds.</P>
<Q>The Affair of the <HI>Treaty</HI> being made publick. I need &s;ay nothing of it. Only I would take Notice, that His <HI>Excellen|cy's</HI> Treatment of our <HI>Indians</HI> was exceeding grateful to them, and they have conceiv'd the highe&s;t Opinion of the <HI>Governor.</HI></Q>
<P><PB N="34" REF="007023_0039_102AEA8F35500E58">Here Mr. SERGEANT takes Occa&s;ion (from a Quarrel that a|ro&s;e between an <HI>Indian</HI> &amp; his <HI>Wi&s;e,</HI> by which they were upon the very Point of parting, (tho' afterwards the Difference was accom|modated, and they liv'd very happily together) to give &s;ome Account of the ill Cu&s;tom among the <HI>Indians</HI> of parting after they are married.</P>
<Q><P>The parting of Man and Wi&s;e (&s;aith he) is a very common Thing among them. Indeed it us'd rarely to happen, that a married Couple live together till they are old. And as they u&s;e but little Ceremony in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Marriage, &s;o they make a le&s;s Thing of parting.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a Ca&s;e, 'tis their Law, that the Children and all the Hou&s;hold Stuff belong to the <HI>Woman</HI>; and indeed every Thing el&s;e but the <HI>Gun,</HI> for that is the Man's Livelihood.&mdash;The Man, according to their Cu&s;tom, has no Right to the Chil|dren, any more than any other Per&s;on whatever.</P></Q>
<P>Then he goes on,</P>
<Q><P>After the <HI>Treaty</HI> was over, I went to <HI>New-Haven,</HI> and afcer I had paid a Vi&s;it to my Friends, in <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> (his native Place) I return'd again to <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> and brought back the <HI>Captain's</HI> Son from <HI>New-Haven</HI> (for he had been there all Sum|mer) who hid, by this Time learnt to &s;peak and read <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> very well.&mdash;When I return'd, Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> was not here, for being taken &s;ick about the Time I was, when he had a little recover'd, he went down to <HI>Springfield,</HI> for the Confirma|tion of his Health; but was detain'd there by Sickne&s;s, till &s;ome Time in <HI>November.</HI> In the mean Time, I kept the School.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Lord's-Day, October</HI> 26th. I preach'd as u&s;ual. The <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hew'd great Satisfaction to &s;ee me, their Mini&s;ter, again. I pro|pos'd <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> to the <HI>Captain</HI> and his <HI>Family</HI>; who &s;hew'd him|&s;elf very de&s;irous of it. I went up to his Hou&s;e, in the Week|Time, to di&s;cour&s;e with him, and prepare him for it. He is a very mode&s;t, but intelligent Man, of great Integrity, and of a blamele&s;s Conver&s;ation; and, from the very fir&s;t of my reaching there, &s;eem'd to have a &s;erious and religious Turn of Mind.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="007023_0040_102AEA922A2B45D8">His <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> al&s;o is a very &s;ober good Sort of a Woman. He and his Wife gave great Attention to what I &s;aid.

The Re&s;t of the Children were not pre&s;ent, by Rea&s;on of the Badne&s;s, of the Weather. The Candidates &s;hew'd a &s;erious Sen&s;e of what they were about. It was done in the Pre&s;ence of a con&s;idera|ble Number, both of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and <HI>Heathen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 7th. I married <HI>Ebenezer</HI> &amp; <HI>Sarah,</HI> lawful Publi&s;h|ment having fir&s;t been made; for he, &s;aid he, being a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> cho&s;e to be married after the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manner, which he prefer'd to their own.</P>

<P>I di&s;cours'd very largely, and as particularly as I tho't pro|per, upon all the more important and fundamental Points of Belief and Practice, in the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion. To which they &s;eriou&s;ly attended, and were apparently much affected. This Conver&s;ation the <HI>Lieutenant</HI> has often &s;poken of &s;ince, as what afforded him more Knowledge, than he had ever gain'd by all his former In&s;truction: and from this Time he &s;eems to have had a new Heart given him.</P>
<P><HI>Lord's-Day, November</HI> 16th. I <HI>baptiz'd</HI> the <HI>Lieutenant</HI> by the Name of <HI>Aaron,</HI> his Wife <HI>Hannab,</HI> and the Re&s;t of his Family; as al&s;o the <HI>Lieutenant's Wife's Si&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Ebenezer's Wife</HI>; in all, eleven Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lieutenant</HI> is a <HI>clear-headed &s;mart Man,</HI> of a deep Reach, and plea&s;ant Humour; and is one of the be&s;t Speakers we hear; is free in Conver&s;ation, and talks excellently well.

However, when I told them, I was unwilling to be tedious to them, they an&s;wer'd, they were glad to hear, and &s;hould never be tir'd with hearing tho&s;e Things.

And per|haps had &s;ome Knowledge of the peculiar Doctrines of the Chri&s;tian Reiligion. He had certainly experienc'd &s;omething more than ordinary, whereby he had been chang'd from a very vicious, drunken Fellow, to a &s;ober Man.

extraordinary, and lerns at a prodigious Rate. So that we had now ten Souls added to our Number. The Number of Scholars is upwards of 40, be&s;ides &s;ome elderly Per&s;ons, who have made Attempts to learn to read.</P>
<P>The <HI>Keutikaw</HI> is a Dance which fini&s;hes the <HI>Mourning for the Dead,</HI> and is celebrated about twelve Months after the Decea&s;e, when the Gue&s;t invited make Pre&s;ents to the Rela|tions of the Decea&s;ed, to make up their Lo&s;s, and to end their Mourning. The Manner of doing it is this. The Pre&s;ents prepar'd are deliver'd to a Speaker, appointed for the Purpo&s;e; who, laying them upon the Shoulders of &s;ome elderly Per&s;on, makes a Speech, &s;hewing the De&s;ign of their pre&s;ent Meeting, and of the Pre&s;ents prepar'd. Then he takes them and di&s;tri|butes them to the <HI>Meurners</HI> adding &s;ome Words of Con&s;olation, and de&s;iring them to forget their Sorrow, and accept of tho&s;e Pre&s;ents to make up their Lo&s;s. After this, they eat toge|ther, and make Merry.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Indians</HI> kept to their Re&s;olution about <HI>Drinking,</HI> much beyond my Expectation; for they always us'd to get Drunk upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions; but we had now but very little Drink|ing The Behaviour of our <HI>Indians</HI> was much taken Notice of by the Strangers; there being a very ob&s;ervable Reforma|tion in their Manners. The <HI>Lieutenant</HI> &s;ignaliz'd him&s;elf, not only by ab&s;taining from Exce&s;s him&s;elf, not by exhorting others al&s;o to u&s;e with Moderation, what &s;trong Drink they were allow'd. <HI>Unnaqaunut</HI> was al&s;o here, and was very &s;erviceable in keeping good Order.</P></Q>
<P>By what I have here tran&s;crib'd, from Mr. SERGEANT's Jour|nal, the Reader will be &s;en&s;ible, that the <HI>Indians</HI> had a great Re|&s;pect for him, and were di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;k, and &s;ubmit to, his Ad|vice in every Thing, their own ancient Cu&s;toms not excepted; that Mr. SERGEANT was very iudu&s;trious and faithful in pro|moting their temporal and eternal Good; and that the Ble&s;&s;ing of God abundantly &s;ucceeded his Endeavours.</P>
<P>It was then but little more than a Year &s;ince tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> were in the Depth of <HI>Healthe&s;h</HI> Ignorance and Darkne&s;s, wholly unacquainted with the fir&s;t Principles of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> and <HI>without God in the World.</HI> But, in that &s;hort Space, many of them had gain'd &s;uch Degrees of Knowledge, in the Principles of Religion,
<PB N="39" REF="007023_0044_102AEA9A16416B10">
that they were become in Mr. SERGEANT's Opinion, (who was a good Judge) fit Subjects of <HI>Baptism.</HI> And they, with their Children, to the Number of 40, were <HI>baptized</HI> by him, in little more than two Months after his <HI>Ordination.</HI> The Number of their Inhabitants, and of their Scholars in the School, was al&s;o increas'd.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things greatly refre&s;h'd Mr. SERGEANT's Spirits, and were no &s;mall Encouragement to him, in his difficult Work. They were al&s;o Matter of Admiration to others, and the Occa|&s;ion of many Thank&s;givings to God, who&s;e Power and Grace were manife&s;t, in turning tho&s;e poor People <HI>from Darkne&s;s to Light, and from the Power of Satan to God.</HI></P>
<P>And as many rejoic'd to &s;ee Mr. SERGEANT chearfully devote him&s;elf to the Service of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> in this &s;elf-denying Work, and to hear of the glorious Succe&s;s he was favour'd with in it; &s;o they &s;aid many kind and endearing Things to him by their Let|ters. And the Reader will not, I tru&s;t, be di&s;pleas'd, if I tran&s;cribe &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages out of them.</P>

<P>The Rev. Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> not only approv'd of the Method, in which Mr. SERGEANT propos'd to &s;pend the Money offer'd him, but was &s;o well pleas'd with it, that he doubled the Sum; as appears by a Pa&s;&s;age in the Doctor's An&s;wer of <HI>February</HI> 6th 1735, 6.</P>

<P>By a Pa&s;&s;age in Mr. SERGEANT's Journal, it &s;eems as if even the <HI>River-Indians</HI> had not wholly e&s;cap'd being tamper'd with by the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Clergy.</P>
<Q><HI>January</HI> 26th.&mdash;The <HI>Lieutenant</HI> a&s;k'd me what I thought of the Celibacy of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Clergy, and of their &s;evere Me|thuds of doing Penance? I was a little &s;urpriz'd to hear him a&s;k &s;uch a Que&s;tion; for I did not &s;uppo&s;e our <HI>Indians</HI> knew any Thing of the Matter. However, I readily told him, that tho&s;e Things were vain Inventions of Men; and unprofitable Services; that I did not judge any Man; but I was &s;ure no Body was under Obligation to do them; that our Bu&s;ine&s;s was to mortify our Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions, and to regulate our Lives by the reveal'd Will of God, and not to go beyond <HI>that.</HI>&mdash;</Q>
<P>In <HI>Indians</HI> living in two Places, remote from each other, put them to the Trouble of removing from their proper Habi|tations in the Winter Sea&s;on; and laid them under Di&s;advan|tages, as to attending upon the publick Wor&s;hip, and theSchool, in the Summer. There was therefore, from the Beginning, a De&s;ign to accommodate them with Land, that they might all &s;ettle in one Place; and that there might be Accommodations al&s;o for others of the <HI>Tribe,</HI> who might be di&s;pos'd to come and &s;ettle with them. The honourable <HI>John Stoddard,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> in a Letter, wrote to be communicated to the <HI>Indians,</HI> at their general

Meeting at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> in <HI>January</HI> 1734.5. mention'd it as follows.</P>
<Q>&mdash;There is a Projection (&s;ays he) to get the mo&s;t of the great Meadow, above the Mountain of <HI>Hou&s;atunmuk</HI> for the <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;o that they may live together, and be able, with Con|venience, to attend the publick Wor&s;hip, and have a School at their Doors: Provided the <HI>Government</HI> can agree with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who have Lands there, and can &s;uit them with Lands el&s;ewhere. The&s;e Things are great Tokens of Kindne&s;s to|wards the <HI>Indians,</HI> and they &s;hould be very careful how they put a Slight upon them.</Q>
<P>At the Treaty at <HI>Doorfield,</HI> the &s;ame Thing was propos'd to them, by Governor <HI>Beleber.</HI><Q>&mdash;I have been inform'd, (&s;ays His Excellency) that you will live remote from one another, and that you are not accommodated with Lands &s;ufficient to &s;upport your Families. This Matter I &s;hall lay before the great <HI>Council of this Government,</HI> and recommend to them the giving you Lands for your more convenient and compact Settlement, and what may be enough for your living comfortably upon.</Q></P>
<P>Accordingly, the <HI>Governor</HI> laid this Matter before the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> at their Fall Se&s;&s;ion, and gives Mr. SERGEANT the following Account of it, in a Letter of <HI>January</HI> 20th 1735, 6. <Q>&mdash;I laid before them (the <HI>General Court</HI>) what I had pro|mi&s;ed to your little Flock, at the Interview with them at <HI>Deer|field</HI>; and Col. <HI>Stoddand,</HI> Major <HI>Pumroy,</HI> and Mr. Ju&s;tice <HI>In|ger&s;ole,</HI> are appointed, by the <HI>General Court,</HI> to weigh and con|&s;ider all Things and Circum&s;tances, &s;o as to accommodate my Children at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk</HI> with Land, in the be&s;t Manner.</Q></P>
<P>His Excellency adds, <Q>I agree with you that &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Families (if &s;ich can be found as you mention) be inter&s;pers'd and &s;ettled among the <HI>Indians</HI>; for to <HI>civilize,</HI> will be the readre&s;t Way to <HI>chri&s;tianize</HI> them.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk</HI> were inform'd of the Steps that were taken by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and of the <HI>Committee</HI> cho&s;en for the above-mention'd End; but had a great Jealou&s;ie upon their Minds, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had &s;ome ill De&s;ign upon them; and had &s;everal Con&s;ultations among them&s;elves, what An&s;wer they &s;hould make to them they came up.

Journal. <Q>It may, (&s;ays he) perhaps, be wonder'd that there &s;hould be any Difficult among the <HI>Indians</HI> in this Affair. But it is the Manner of the <HI>Nation</HI> to be &s;low in their Debates, cautions in their Determinations, and jealous of their Intere&s;t. And the Enemies of the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> (for we have a great many, not only among the <HI>Indians</HI> in other Places, but al&s;o among pretended <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI>; who&s;e <HI>Godline&s;s is their Gain</HI>) had been very indu&s;trious to throw <HI>&s;tumbling Blocks</HI> in their Way, and to prevent their accepting the Propo&s;al of &s;ettling together. For there have not been wanting tho&s;e, and there are &s;ome yet, that tell them, our De&s;ign, in this Affair, is only to get the greater Advantage of them, and bring them more into our Power, that we may in&s;alve them and their Children.</Q></P>
<P>But the&s;e Jealou&s;ies were, in &s;ome good Mea&s;ure, remov'd by the Pains Mr. SERGEANT took to &s;atisfy them of the kind and good Intention of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> towards them; and by the Faithfulne&s;s both of the <HI>Committe &amp; Government</HI> in that Affair.</P>

<P>It mu&s;t be here ob&s;erv'd, that the Lands at <HI>Wnabktukook</HI> (alias the Great Meadow) above the Mountain, were comprehended in the North Part of a Town&s;hip, which was &s;ome Time ago purcha&s;ed of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and by the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> granted to a Number of Proprietors; except a &s;mall Part, which Captain <HI>Kunkapot,</HI> and &s;ome other <HI>Indians</HI> there, re&s;erv'd for their own U&s;e; and now live upon. What the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> de&s;ign'd, was, to agree with tho&s;e Proprietors, who had Land above the Mountain, to give up their Right, and to take Land in other Places, as an Equivalent for it: and to grant to the <HI>Indians</HI> a Town&s;hip &s;ix Miles Square, comprizing the Great Meadow in it; that being the mo&s;t &s;uitable Spot for the <HI>Indians</HI> of any that could be had: for they make little or no U&s;e of any but inter|val Land.</P>
<P>The Bu&s;ine&s;s therefore of the <HI>Committee,</HI> in the next Place, was with tho&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> People, who held the Land above the Mountain; with whom, when they came to di&s;cour&s;e, they found little or no Difficulty; for they were content with the Propo&s;als made to them of equivalent Lands in other Places. But there were two or three <HI>Dutch Men,</HI> who were &s;ettled above the Mountain, and had Lands in the Great-Meadow, who were more difficult. To tho&s;e the Committee made &s;ome very fair Propo&s;als, which they took into Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The <HI>Committee</HI> therefore, upon meeting the <HI>Indians</HI> on the 18th, inform'd them, that they had con&s;er'd with the Proprietors of the Land above the Mountain, and that there was a Pro&s;pect of obtaining tho&s;e Lands for the <HI>Indians,</HI> according to their De&s;ire; e&s;pecially &s;eeing the <HI>Governor,</HI> and <HI>General Court,</HI> were &s;o very
<PB N="47" REF="007023_0052_102AEAAA19B3E138">
de&s;irous of promoting <HI>Religion</HI> among them; that it was not now in their Power to &s;ettle them together, but they mu&s;t make Report of what they had done to the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI>; who, if they approv'd of it, would &s;end another <HI>Committee</HI> to accompli&s;h the Affair. And then they de&s;ir'd to know, Whether the <HI>Indians</HI> had any Thing further to &s;ay to them?</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> return'd them their hearty Thanks for the Pains they had taken, and for the Trouble they had been at, in pro&s;e|cutting the Affair: and added, that they had nothing further to &s;ay, but only that they de&s;ir'd to be &s;ettled together by planting Time.</P>
<P>Upon the Report of this <HI>Committee,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e, it was, that the <HI>General Court</HI> granted to the <HI>Indians</HI> a Town&s;hip, &s;ix Miles &s;quare, above the Mountain; comprising in it <HI>Wnebktukook,</HI> or the Great-Meadow. And the &s;ame Gentlemen were appointed a <HI>Committee</HI> to lay out the Land, and to treat further with tho&s;e, who were Proprietors of Land, within the Limits of the Town&s;hip, to give them an Equivalent, to Proportion the Meadow Lands to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and to do all that was needful that the <HI>Indians</HI> might be put into the quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. By the Grant of the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly,</HI> Mr. SERGEANT, their <HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> their <HI>School-Ma&s;ter,</HI> were made Proprietors, each of a &s;ixtieth Part of the Town&s;hip; and four <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Families be|&s;ides were to be accommodated with &s;uch a Part as the <HI>Committee</HI> &s;hould &s;ee fit. It was upon Mr. SERGEANT's De&s;ire, that tho&s;e Families were admitted. The Ends he had in View were, not only that <HI>He,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> might have the Comfort of their Neighbourhood, and Society; but e&s;pecially to <HI>civilize</HI> and <HI>anglicize</HI> the <HI>Indians,</HI> and to be a Help to them in their &s;ecular Affairs. Families, well adapted to an&s;wer tho&s;e Ends, were to be cho&s;en, and by Col. <HI>Stoddord</HI>'s Approbation (who was a good Judge) they were to be admitted.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 20th. The&s;e Gentlemen, the honourable <HI>John Stoddard, Ebeneze Pumrcy,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Inger&s;ole,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;qrs</ABBR> went to <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> upon the Bu&s;ine&s;s a&s;&s;ign'd them by the <HI>Court.</HI> When they met the <HI>Indians,</HI> they found &s;ome Jealou&s;ies yet re|maining upon their Minds, which it was needful for them, in the fir&s;t Place, to remove. Of this Matter Mr. SERGEANT, in his Journal, gives the following Account.</P>
<Q><PB N="48" REF="007023_0053_102AEAAC9DC67790"><P>The <HI>Indians</HI> met the <HI>Committee</HI>; who di&s;cours'd with them, informing them of the Intention of the <HI>Government,</HI> and the De&s;ign of their coming up; reminding them of what was agreed upon in the Winter, telling them how far they had proceeded already: for they had, before they came up, agreed with all the Proprietors in tho&s;e Parts from whence they came; and had got 12 or 14 Rights to di&s;po&s;e of to them. After this Lieutenant <HI>U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"></HI> &s;pake to the following Purport. That he was very &s;en&s;ible of the unhappy Circum&s;tances of his former Life, and of the mi&s;erable State of his <HI>Nation</HI>; who, being brought up in the greate&s;t Ignorance and Vice, were Objects of Pity: And that he was al&s;o &s;en&s;ible of their great Obligations to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> for the Notice that had been taken of them; and very thankful for their Care of them, in providing for their In&s;truction in the Knowledge of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> and taking Care to have their Children taught to read, and for their being brought up in the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion: And &s;aid, that for his Part, he was &s;o fully &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e Things, that the Con&s;ideration of them had &s;ome Times almo&s;t drawn Tears from his Eyes: and that, as for him&s;elf, he thought his Eyes were now open'd, and was well &s;atisfied of the Truth of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion, &s;o far as he under&s;tood it; tho' po&s;&s;ibly he might be mi&s;taken; and was only &s;orry he'd had &s;o little Opportunity to be in&s;tructed; wi&s;h'd it had been his Happi|ne&s;s to have been brought up in the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion, as he hop'd it would be of his Children; for he wi&s;h'd the &s;ame Care that had been taken, might be continu'd: Yea, 'twas his De&s;ire, that their whole Tribe might be brought into the &s;ame Way they were in. However, there were two or three Things, which appear'd dark in his Eyes. He wonder'd they had been neglected &s;o long, and de&s;ir'd to know the true Spring of the great Favour, &s;o &s;uddenly &s;hown them. If it was from Love and good Will towards them, he, for his Part, accepted it with all Thankfulne&s;s: But, po&s;&s;ibly, there might be &s;ome &s;ecret Spring, and moving Cau&s;e, he was not acquaint|ed with, that might le&s;&s;en their Obligations to Gratitude. And what &s;till more &s;tumbled him was that Major <HI>Pumroy,</HI> when he was here la&s;t Winter, a&s;k'd them &s;everal Que&s;tions, about the Proprietors of &s;everal Tracts of Land, and &s;o in&s;i&s;ted upon
<PB N="49" REF="007023_0054_102AEAAEE7CE3B38">
it to know who they were, and how they came by their Titles, that he was ready to conceive, the Major &s;u&s;pected they had no Title at all to the Lands they challenged. If any Gentle|man que&s;tion'd them in this Point, they were not able, without much Trouble in &s;ending for Friends, and providing Witne&s;&s;es, to &s;atisfy him: Or, if any one &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon any Thing more than the Te&s;timony of living Witne&s;&s;es, he confe&s;s'd they could prove no Title at all. However, their Titles were good, according to their Law and Cu&s;tom in &s;uch Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>And another Thing, he could not but wonder at, was, that if the Chri&s;tian Religion was &s;o true and good, as he e&s;teem'd it to be, how there &s;hould be &s;o many Profe&s;&s;ors of it, that liv'd &s;uch vicious Lives, and &s;o contrary to what he was told, were the Rules of it.</P>
<P>This is the Sub&s;tance of what he &s;aid, which he &s;pake with the greate&s;t Earne&s;tne&s;s.</P>
<P>Col. <HI>Stoddard</HI> an&s;wer'd him; informing him, what was the Pretence of the fir&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Settlers of <HI>America,</HI> with Re&s;pect to the <HI>Propagation</HI> of the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> among the <HI>Natives</HI> of the Country; and what is contain'd in the <HI>Charter</HI> of this <HI>Govern|ment,</HI> re&s;pecting that Matter: And told him what had been done formerly to <HI>chri&s;tianize</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI>; particularly by the famous Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI>; and what Succe&s;s had attended tho&s;e En|deavours; and what is now doing in diver&s;e Parts of the <HI>Pro|vince</HI>: That the <HI>Government</HI> had always been ready to promote the <HI>Go&s;pel's Propagation</HI> among them: That many Attempts had been made, with but too little Succe&s;s: but as &s;oon as ever it was known, that the <HI>Indians at Hou&s;atunnuk</HI> had a favourable Opinion of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion, Care was taken to have them in&s;tructed. It was their Good, and that only, that was &s;ought after. And, whatever their Enemies might in&s;inuate to the contrary, this was the Spring of what was now doing for them.&mdash;As for the Difficulty which aro&s;e from what Major <HI>Pumroy</HI> had &s;aid, he an&s;wer'd for him&s;elf, that is was not beccu&s;e he, in the lea&s;t doubted of their Titles to their Lands, (which he look'd upon as good) that he enquir'd, who own'd this and that Tract, and how they came by their Titles, but that it was only to gratify his own Curio&s;ity to know their Laws and Cu&s;toms.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="007023_0055_102AEAB076AD0648">To the third Difficult the Colonel an&s;wer'd, that it was indeed a &s;hameful Thing; but &s;prung from the Corruption of Men's Hearts, and not from any Detect in the Rules of Living.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Lieutenant</HI> &s;pake again, and &s;aid; perhaps, be|cau&s;e the Land was in great Mea&s;ure given them, there might hereafter &s;ome Contention ari&s;e between their Children and ours; and that ours would look upon them&s;elves to have a Superiority over theirs, becau&s;e the Land was given them.</P>
<P>He de&s;ir'd therefore to know, how their Titles would be a&s;certain'd; and what Security they could have, that their Children would be free.</P>
<P>To this the Col. an&s;wer'd, that they would have their Titles in the &s;ame Manner that all the People in the <HI>Government</HI> had; that therefore they had no more Rea&s;on to fear, that Advan|tage would be taken again&s;t them, than any Body el&s;e: that the &s;ame Laws which protected others, in their Properties, would protect them: That there were Laws made peculiarly in Favour of the <HI>Indians,</HI> which they would have the Benefit of: that what will be, none can certainly tell, but, from what has been, we may rea&s;onably hope, that the &s;ame Favour will be continu'd. But after all, they would be entirely at their Liberty, as much as they were then, either to go away, or to tarry there, if they had a Mind to.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Lieutenant</HI> expre&s;s'd his Satisfaction in what had been &s;aid, and added that, for his own Part, he was &s;o abun|dantly &s;atisfy'd of the Truth and Excellency of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion, that he would chearfully die for it. And after they had di&s;cours'd a While upon Religion in general, they were di&s;mi&s;'d; very much to the Satisfaction of the <HI>Indians.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The <HI>Committee</HI> met with much Difficulty from the Men that were &s;ettled above the Mountain; but at Length &s;ound Means, whereby they were made pretty ea&s;y.&mdash;They therefore pro|ceded in their Bu&s;ine&s;s, laid out the Town&s;hip, which now goes by the Name of <HI>Stockbridge</HI>; and, if I mi&s;take not proportion'd the Meadow-Land, which they had got for the <HI>Indians.</HI> But, &s;ome yet remain'd in the Hands of the Proprietors, which after|wards the <HI>Indians</HI> were put into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of: tho' it co&s;t
<PB N="51" REF="007023_0056_102AEAB268D4B2A0">
the <HI>Committee,</HI> and Mr. SERGEANT too, a great deal of Trouble, before they could &s;atisfy and remove the Owners.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Kunkapot</HI> had formerly given to <HI>Jehoiakim Vanvalk|enbeurgh,</HI> a <HI>Dutch Man,</HI> his &s;pecial Friend, 40 Acres of Land in this Great-Meadow, and about 250 of Upland adjoining to it; which he now held. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a little after, being reduc'd, he was oblig'd to &s;ell. Some Gentlemen therefore bought him out, and gave the Land to the <HI>Indians,</HI> an Equivalent of the unap|propriated Lands being given them by the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly.</HI> So that the whole Meadow was in a little Time po&s;&s;e&s;t by the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>Monday</HI> the 26th of <HI>April,</HI> the <HI>Committee</HI> confer'd again with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and inform'd them what they had done, re|&s;pecting their Town&s;hip; &s;hew'd them a Plan of it; de&s;ir'd to know of them, if they would have any Thing alter'd. The <HI>Indians</HI> replied that they were very well &s;atisfied with what was done, and very thankful for it.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of <HI>May,</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> all &s;ettled in their new Town; were greatly pleas'd with it. Two new Families were added to their Number. <Q>They gave very much into <HI>Hu&s;bandry,</HI> (&s;ays Mr. SERGEANT) planted more this Year than ever they did before, by three Times at lea&s;t.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> lodges at Capt. <HI>Kunkapot</HI>'s, has a very numerous School, and a tedi|ous Ta&s;k of it; lives a very lone&s;ome Life; is indeed inde|fatigable in his Bu&s;ine&s;s; and no Body de&s;erves more of the Publick than he.</Q></P>
<P>When the <HI>Committe,</HI> upon their fir&s;t Vi&s;itation of the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> had fini&s;h'd their Bu&s;ine&s;s with them, the Time for geting Sugar was come.</P>
<P>Therefore (<HI>March</HI> the fir&s;t) they all went into the Woods, with their Familes, upon that Bu&s;ine&s;s; expecting to fellow it about &s;ix Weeks. They went in two Companies, about Half with the <HI>Captain</HI> above the Mountain, the Re&s;t with the <HI>Lieute|nant</HI> below. Mr. SERGEANT was loth they &s;hould be &s;o long without In&s;truction, and therefore concluded that he would go with one of the Companies, and Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> with the other, and live with them during that Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Indians</HI> had been out two Days, and prepar'd them|&s;elvs Hou&s;es, they &s;ent in two young Men, one to Conduct
<PB N="52" REF="007023_0057_102AEAB3FB4687B0">
Mr. SERGEANT to the <HI>Captain's</HI> Hou&s;e, and the other to con|duct Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> to the <HI>Lieutenant's.</HI></P>
<P>After they had been out about three Weeks, Mr. SERGEANT and Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> chang'd their Quarters; Mr. SERGEANT went to the <HI>Lieutenant's</HI> Company, and Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> to the <HI>Captain's,</HI> endeavouring that the <HI>Indians</HI> might have equal Ad|vantage from their In&s;tructions.</P>
<P>During the&s;e &s;ix Weeks, Mr. SERGEANT &s;pent his Time very agreably among the <HI>Indians,</HI> being employ'd, in the Day Time, in teaching the Children to read; and in the Evening he taught the <HI>Indians</HI> to &s;ing, in which they took great Delight. He pray'd with them Morning and Evening, in their own Lan|guage, and &s;aid Grace before, and after Meat, in the &s;ame. He al&s;o preach'd to them on the <HI>Sabbath</HI> by an Interpreter, and pray'd in their own Language; which he began to do on <HI>Fe|bruary</HI> 18th, and continu'd it ever after. For they being de&s;i|rous, that Prayers might be made in their own Language, Mr. SERGEANT (by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Interpreters) had compos'd Prayers for &s;uch Occa&s;ions, in the <HI>Indian</HI> Language. The Snow now was about a Foot and Half deep in tho&s;e Woods, and the Weather cold. A Deer-&s;kin with the Hair on, &s;pread upon &s;ome Spruce Boughs, and a Blanket &s;pread upon that, was his Bed; and three Blankets &s;pread over him was his Covering; where he &s;lept very well. And tho' their Diet was low, yet it was cleanly and well dre&s;s'd, by the <HI>Captain's</HI> and <HI>Lieutenant's</HI> Wives. Their Drink was Water. He had a good Appetite, eat heartily, and was in very good Health, all the Time he was in the Wilderne&s;s with them.</P>
<Q><P>I was (&s;ays Mr. SERGEANT) treated very well, while I was with them; and learn'd more of their Manners, and Lan|guage, than ever I had before.&mdash;They are altogether without Compliments, in their Treatment one of another. Children &s;hew no Sort of Deference to their Parents, either in Word or Carriage, more than to any Body el&s;e. They are very mode&s;t, and the Women and Children ba&s;hful. They are kind one to another, and make every Body welcome, in their Way, that comes to their Hou&s;es. When a Stranger comes into one of their Hou&s;es, he does it, as if it were his own, and, without any Compliments at all, &s;its down with
<PB N="53" REF="007023_0058_102AEAB6225AB550">
the Re&s;t; but &s;ays nothing. The Hou&s;e-Keeper immediately offers him &s;ome Victuals, which he receives as tho' he were at Home; eats freely, and then begins to talk; to tell his Bu|&s;ine&s;s, or to relate a Piece of News; but will enter, before he has eat, into no Di&s;cour&s;e. Some Times, when Friends meet, they &s;ay to one another. O! Brother or Cou&s;in; or u&s;e &s;ome &s;uch Word expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome Relation. But they have Terms expre&s;&s;ive of more particular, and quire different Relations from any we u&s;e. Their Children, born of the &s;ame Parents, &s;tand in three Relations to one another; the elde&s;t calling all the younger, whether Brothers or Si&s;ters, <HI>Nhee&s;umuk.</HI> The elder Si&s;ters are to the younger, whether Brothers, or Si&s;ters, <HI>Nme&s;uk.</HI> The younger Children call the elder Brothers, <HI>Netokbannut.</HI> And there are other like relative Terms, to which there are none in our Language Synonymous. And indeed their Language, &s;o far as I perceive as yet, is extremely different from all the European Languages that I have any Acquaintance with, and &s;eems, as far as I can judge, in the Genius, Phra&s;eology, and Pronunciation, of the Words (which abound with Gutturais) to be mo&s;t like the Language of the Ea&s;t: tho' I confe&s;s, I am as yet a very incompetent Judge.</P>
<P>Their Women have a Cu&s;tom (which is, for ought I know, peculiar to the aboriginal <HI>Americans,</HI> for they tell me it is com|mon to all <HI>North-America</HI> at lea&s;t) <HI>viz.</HI> Their Girls, at the fir&s;t flux of (their Men&s;es, &s;eperate them&s;elves from all Society, live alone in the Woods; &s;ome fourteen, &s;ome twenty, and &s;ome forty Days; mu&s;t do no Work at all, nor be &s;een by any Man for it is reckon'd <HI>ominous</HI> for a Man to &s;ee them in their Seperation. They cut off their Hair when they go out. And &s;ome of their Women go out afterwards, at the Return of their Terms, and &s;tay three or four Days.&mdash;What they mean by this Cu&s;tom, or whence they deriv'd it, I cannot tell.</P></Q>
<P>About the Time the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;ettled in their new Town, Mr. SERGEANT went to <HI>We&s;tfield,</HI> and was there detain'd by Sickne&s;s; &s;o that he was ab&s;ent from them two Sabbaths. He took Care to inform the <HI>Indians</HI> of his Sickne&s;s, who expre&s;s'd a great deal of Concern for him; enquir'd by all Opportunities after him, and &s;aid if he &s;hould die it would be a great Lo&s;s to them: But
<PB N="54" REF="007023_0059_102AEAB88D5C2698">
if it &s;hould be &s;o, they hop'd God would provide them another Mini&s;ter. At his Return, they &s;hew'd great Joy &amp; Satisfaction, that he was recover'd and re&s;tor'd to them Again.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 23d. He preach'd to them in their new Settlement, but liv'd not among them as their School-Ma&s;ter did, but kept &s;till at his Lodgings about five Miles below.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 12. A Me&s;&s;enger came from <HI>Hud&s;on'-River,</HI> to call the <HI>Indians</HI> thither, to con&s;ider of a <HI>Murder</HI> committed by one of their <HI>Tribe.</HI> The <HI>Captain</HI> and <HI>Lieutenant</HI> went upon that Occa|tion, and had Opportunity, while they were gone, to &s;ee and conver&s;e with many of the principal <HI>Indians</HI>; &s;pent almo&s;t all their Time in Di&s;cour&s;e with them upon the Subject of Religion; and told Mr. SERGEANT when they return'd, that all they talk'd with, had favourable Thoughts of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion; own'd that they them&s;elves were in a wrong Way, and &s;aid they believ'd they were &s;erving the <HI>Devil</HI>: And not one objected any Thing again&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> but &s;everal &s;aid they would come with their Families, and be in&s;tructed.</P>
<P>On the 27th of <HI>June</HI> Mr. SERGEANT baptiz'd a Child, which being mention'd in his Journal, he proceeds to &s;ay.</P>
<Q><P>And now the whole Number that I have baptiz'd is 52. The Number of <HI>Indians</HI> now re&s;iding here is upwards of 90; and it is highly probable, if God affords us the Ble&s;&s;ing he has done, we &s;hall have here, in a few Years, &s;ome Hundreds of Indians.</P>
<P>From the imperfect View of the Matter, one may have from this Journal, it will I believe appear, that the Hand of God has been remarkably in the Affair. But I am not able, in Writing, to communicate the &s;ame View of Things, that I have from ob&s;erving the whole from Step to Step. And con|&s;idering the gro&s;s Darkne&s;s the <HI>Indians</HI> were brought up in, with the great Oppo&s;ition the Go&s;pel has met with, not only from the <HI>Heathen,</HI> but from &s;ome al&s;o, who have the Name of Chri&s;tians, I am &s;urpriz'd at the Progre&s;s it has &s;o &s;uddenly made among them. A very remarkable Reformation appears, more, and more, in their Manners; their Hearts &s;eem really to be engag'd; and Vice, e&s;pecially Drunkenne&s;s (the Vice they are all addicted to) begins to be a great Di&s;grace among them. I am not able to conver&s;e much with them in their own
<PB N="55" REF="007023_0060_102AEABA77C28558">
own Language, tho' under&s;tand a great deal they &s;ay; and Religion is the Subject of frequent Conver&s;ation among them. Our <HI>Dutch</HI> Interpreter tells me he is &s;urpriz'd to hear &s;ome of them talk, &s;o &s;en&s;ibly as they do about Religion.</P></Q>
<P>When Mr. SERGEANT was at <HI>We&s;tfield,</HI> in the Beginning of <HI>May,</HI> he receiv'd a Letter from Dr. <HI>Colman,</HI> of <HI>April</HI> 21. giving him an Account of a generous Offer Mr. <HI>I&s;aac Hollis</HI> of <HI>London</HI> had made him, of dieting, cloathing, lodging, and in&s;tructing 20 <HI>Indian</HI> Boys at his own Co&s;t.</P>
<P>This is the Gentleman to whom the <HI>Doctor</HI> wrote, recom|mending the Mi&s;&s;ion at <HI>Hon&s;atunnuk</HI> to his Genero&s;ity; of which he inform'd Mr. SERGEANT in his Letter of <HI>June</HI> 18th 1735. in&s;erted, in Page 30 &amp; 31. And in An&s;wer to the Letter of the <HI>Doctor</HI>'s, he makes this generous Offer.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Colman,</HI> who was wi&s;e and prudent, thought it not be&s;t to draw upon Mr. <HI>Hollis,</HI> until he &s;hould be well inform'd, what the Charge of maintaining 20 Scholars would amount to, in one Year; for he was apprehen&s;ive that it would ri&s;e higher, than the Donor expected. And therefore wrote to Mr. <HI>Will|iams</HI> of <HI>Springfield,</HI> and to Mr. SERGEANT, for their Thoughts upon the Matter; and al&s;o con&s;ulted Governor <HI>Belcher</HI>; and, upon the be&s;t Computation they could make, concluded, that the Expence of one Child, in a Year, would ari&s;e to <HI>twenty five Pounds</HI> our Currency, and the whole to <HI>five Hundred Pounds</HI> per Annum. Of this Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> inform'd Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI>; and it prov'd as the Doctor expected. It exceeded what Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI> tho't of. He therefore reduc'd the Number of Scholars to 12; and propos'd to &s;upport that Number from Year to Year.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame Time, the honourable <HI>Samuel Holden,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>; of <HI>London,</HI> directed the Rev. Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> to be&s;tow <HI>one Hundred Pounds</HI> of his Money for the Benefit of the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> which Mr. SERGEANT, with Dr. <HI>Colman</HI>'s Approbation, thought be&s;t to expend for the Benefit of the <HI>Females</HI>; &s;eeing Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI>'s Donation was confin'd to the <HI>Males.</HI></P>
<P>Of the&s;e noble, and generous In&s;tances of Liberality, Mr. SERGEANT inform'd the <HI>Indians,</HI> who were much affected with them, and very thankful to their pious Benefactors. And, as a grateful Acknowledgment of the Benefits they had receiv'd from the honourable <HI>Corporation</HI> at Home, they wrote the following Letter.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>In a Letter of <HI>July</HI> 11th. His Excellency Governor <HI>Belcher</HI> &s;ays to Mr. SERGEANT <Q>&mdash;I de&s;ire you ta greet my Children at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> in the kinde&s;t Manner from me, and let them know, I &s;hall be heartily glad to &s;ee them at <HI>Bo&s;ten,</HI> with <HI>Cor&s;lar</HI> their chief Sachem,&mdash;1 hope to &s;ee you with your People, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Accordingly Mr. SERGEANT, and a Number of the <HI>Stockbridge Indians,</HI> with about as many Strangers from <HI>Hud&s;on-River,</HI> went to <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> And <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 5th they waited upon the <HI>Governor &amp; CounciL.</HI></P>
<Q><P>The <HI>Lieutenant</HI> (&s;ays Mr. SERGEANT,) made a Speech, in which he, in the Name of the Reft, expre&s;s'd great Thank|fulne&s;s for the Kindne&s;s the <HI>Goverment</HI> had be&s;tow'd upon them already, particularly in granting them a Town&s;hip, for the Conveniency of their living together. And in Return gave up their Challenge to two Miles of Land, one Mile on each Side the Road from <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk</HI> to <HI>We&s;tfield.</HI>&mdash;Pray'd for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Government</HI> in building a <HI>Meeting-Hou&s;e</HI> and <HI>School-Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>To which the Governor an&s;wer'd very kindly, that the <HI>Government</HI> was well pleas'd with the Inclination they had &s;hewn to receive the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> of our <HI>Lord Je&s;us chri&s;t</HI>; and &s;o long as that good Di&s;po&s;ition remain'd, would not repent the Care and Charge they had been at to accommodate them for their better In&s;truction in the Way of Life; hop'd they would go on and an&s;wer our Hopes &amp; Expectations from their good Beginning, and they &s;hould never want the Favour of the <HI>Government</HI>; that they accepted very kindly the Land they gave up their Challenge to; that he would make known to the <HI>General Court,</HI> their De&s;ire re&s;pecting a <HI>Meeting</HI> and <HI>School-Hou&s;e,</HI> at their next Se&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Then they made a Pre&s;ent of Skins; which the <HI>Governor</HI> was pleas'd to order to be &s;old, and the Money to be laid out
<PB N="58" REF="007023_0063_102AEAC0C3CC1778">
in Books for me: which, with other In&s;tances of His <HI>Excel|leney</HI>'s Genero&s;ity to me, I retain a mo&s;t grateful Sen&s;e of; and as it &s;prings from the Relation I &s;tand in to this People, it is a Proof of His <HI>Excellency</HI>'s great Piety, and Concern to promote the Knowledge, and Practice, of Religion &amp; Virtue, and &s;o I &s;hall ever e&s;teem my&s;elf &s;o much the more bound to be faithful in my Bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;</P></Q>
<P>From <HI>We&s;tfield</HI> to <HI>Sheffield</HI> Bounds is about 26 Miles, the Land therefore which the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> gave up their Challenge to is 52 &s;quare Miles, and &s;hould be e&s;teem'd no incon&s;iderable Return for the Favour be&s;tow'd.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 6th. Mr. SERGEANT and the <HI>Indians</HI> din'd with the <HI>Governor</HI> and <HI>Council,</HI> were curteou&s;ly treated, and receiv'd Pre|&s;ents ol Guns, Blankets, Shirts, &amp;c. Soon a&s;ter which they re|turn'd Home, well pleas'd with the Treatment they had met with. And tho' there were &s;ome Difficulties attending the Af|fairs of <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> particularly re&s;pecting their Lands, not yet got wholly out of the Proprietors Hands, yet, in the general, Things went well; the <HI>Indians</HI> increas'd in Knowledge and Number, new Families, and particular Per&s;orns, coming to them from Time to Time, to live there and be in&s;tructed. And the <HI>Indians</HI> in general behav'd well. But about the End of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> &s;ome of them went to a <HI>Kentikaw,</HI> or Dance, at <HI>Squampaumuk,</HI> (a Place about 25 Miles di&s;tant from <HI>Stockbridge</HI>; in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Country) where, being encompa&s;&s;ed with Temptations, &s;ome of them drank to Exce&s;s, which was Cau&s;e of great Grief to Mr. SERGEANT, and they them&s;elves were fill'd with Shame and Confu&s;ion of Face when they came Home.</P>
<P>Mr. SERGEANT, who had hitherto liv'd in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Families, below the Mountain, in <HI>January</HI> 1736, 7. mov'd up into the <HI>Indian</HI> Town, and liv'd with Mr <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> who had built an Hou&s;e, and brought Home a Wife, &amp;c. Mr. SERGEANT there|fore was no longer under a Nece&s;&s;icy of living at &s;uch a Di&s;tance from his People.&mdash;</P>
<P>When His Excellency Governor <HI>Belcher,</HI> according to his Promi&s;e of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the 5th to the <HI>Indians,</HI> recommended it to the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly,</HI> to build them a <HI>Meeting-Hou&s;e</HI> and <HI>School-Hou&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Court</HI> granted it: as appears from a Pa&s;&s;age in Colonel <HI>Staddard</HI>'s Letter to Mr. SERGEANT.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="007023_0064_102AEAC29ACFC500"><Q>The <HI>General Court</HI> (&s;ays the <HI>Colonel</HI>) have ordered; That a <HI>Meeting-Hou&s;e</HI> of thirty Feet broad, and forty long, together with a <HI>School-Hou&s;e,</HI> be built for the <HI>Indians,</HI> at the Charge of the <HI>Province.</HI> And <HI>You</HI> and Mr. <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> with <HI>My&s;elf,</HI> are appointed to &s;ee the&s;e Things effected.</Q></P>
<P>As Mr. SERGEANT had, by the Help of Interpreters, before this, tran&s;lated &s;ome Prayers into the <HI>Indian</HI> Language, for their daily u&s;e; &s;o now he had tran&s;lated Dr. <HI>Watt</HI>'s fir&s;t Catechi&s;m into the <HI>Indian</HI> Tongue, that the Children might under&s;tanding|ly read and learn it. Some Things, about this Time, appear'd with a di&s;couraging A&s;pect, and gave Mr. SERGEANT much Trouble; the Principal of which was, that one of their <HI>Dutch</HI> Neighbours, not only refus'd to give up his Right for an Equivalent, which made the <HI>Indians</HI> unea&s;y; but al&s;o kept a Store of <HI>Rum</HI> by him, of which he either gave or &s;old to the <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;o that &s;ome of them drank to Exce&s;s, and were very trouble&s;ome. But this was Matter of Grief to mo&s;t of them, e&s;pecially to the <HI>Captain</HI> and <HI>Lieutenant,</HI> who exerted them&s;elves to correct &s;uch Di&s;orders; and the <HI>Indians,</HI> in general, behav'd well. New Families were, from Time to Time, added to their Number. And there were frequent In&s;tances of Mr. SERGEANT's baptizing Per&s;ons, who, upon careful Examination, he found knowing in the Principles of Religion, and &s;eriou&s;ly re&s;olv'd to walk by the excellent Rules of it.</P>
<P>Tho' the <HI>Indians</HI> went out this Sea&s;on, as u&s;ual, to make Sugar, yet they return'd from their Work every Week, and attended the publick Wor&s;hip on the <HI>Sabbath.</HI> They al&s;o di&s;cover'd an Inclination to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cu&s;toms. For a couple, who were about marrying, enter'd their Intentions of it, or made them known to Mr. SERGEANT, who, upon the two &s;ollowing Sab|baths, publi&s;h'd the Bands of Matrimony between <HI>Naukuchewat,</HI> and <HI>Wauwoonemeen,</HI> and then married them by a Form tran&s;lated into the <HI>Indian</HI> Language.</P>
<P>On the 7th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> Mr. SERGEANT began to preach to the <HI>Indians</HI> in their <HI>own Language,</HI> and in Proce&s;s of Time became &s;o perfect in it, that the <HI>Indians</HI> were wont to &s;ay, <HI>Our Mini&s;ter &s;peaks our Language better than we do our &s;elves.</HI> And as it co&s;l him a great deal of Pains to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of it; &s;o it was no &s;mall Advantage to him, when he was able to u&s;e it
<PB N="60" REF="007023_0065_102AEAC47AF8A630">
freely, in Cover&s;ation with the <HI>Indians.</HI> For he was not only able, better to acquaint him&s;elf with the religious Sentiments of tho&s;e? who would make a Pro&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI>; but al&s;o to conver&s;e with Strangers upon religious Subjects, when they came to vi&s;it their Brethren at <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> or when he had Opportu|nity el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>Mr. SARGEANT, about this Time, baptiz'd &s;everal Per&s;ons. And that the Reader may know, what Pains he took to inform the Candidates in the Principles or Chri&s;tianity; and to &s;atisfy him&s;elf that they under&s;tood them, and that it was their &s;erious Purpo&s;e and Re&s;olution to live a religious Life; I &s;hall here tran&s;cribe, from his Journal, the conci&s;e Account he gives of his Treatment of them.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Lord-Day, Augu&s;t</HI> 14th. A large Auditory.&mdash;I preach'd in <HI>Indian. Yokun</HI> and his <HI>Wife</HI> propos'd them&s;elves to <HI>Bapti&s;m.</HI> Both Per&s;ons of good Behaviour, and apparently well di&s;pos'd to <HI>Chri&s;tianity.</HI> The Man had been a Drinker; but &s;eem'd now to be reform'd: the Woman always appear'd innocent, and virtuou&s;ly inclin'd. I took a great deal of Pains to in|&s;truct them in the Principles of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> and to impre&s;s upon their Minds a &s;trong Sen&s;e of Religion, and to compo&s;e them to Seriou&s;ne&s;s. And, having good Satisfaction of their Knowledge and good Inclimation, <HI>Lord's-Day, Augu&s;t</HI> 21. I baptiz'd <HI>Tokum,</HI> his Wi&s;e, and three Children.&mdash;This <HI>Week, Umpaumut's</HI> Son, <HI>Pmaupau&s;oo</HI> by Name, from the I&s;land in <HI>Hud&s;on's River,</HI> where his Father was a Chief, who had been here a little While, de&s;ir'd Bapti&s;m, as al&s;o <HI>Nom&s;boos,</HI> who about a Year before came from the <HI>Shouwoncos</HI> Country. I took Pains to in&s;truct them particularly, in the Principles of <HI>Chri&s;ti|anity.</HI> They were both young, I was therefore the more con|cern'd for them that they &s;hould be well in&s;tructed and have their Minds impre&s;t with a due Seriou&s;ne&s;s and Concern, in what they were about: I therefore cho&s;e to de&s;er their Bapti&s;m a little longer.</P>
<P><HI>Lord's-Day, August</HI> 28th, Auditory as u&s;ual.&mdash;This Week took a &s;econd, and third Opportunity, to in&s;truct the Candi|dates for Bapti&s;m, when another young Man al&s;o appear'd de|firous of Bapti&s;m; <HI>Ukhibnauwequn</HI> by Name,&mdash;This Week
<PB N="61" REF="007023_0066_102AEAC69CDE59B0">
I took a great deal of Pains to prepare the Candidates for Bapti&s;m. They appear'd very de&s;irous of it, and &s;eem'd to under&s;tand the Doctrines of Religion well.</P>
<P><HI>Lord's-Day, September</HI> 14th. I baptiz'd them.&mdash;</P></Q>
<P>Mr. SERGEANT had been inform'd, that the <HI>Indians</HI> living at <HI>Kaunaumeek,</HI> a Place about 18 Miles from <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> to the N. W. were de&s;irous that he &s;hould come and preach to them. He therefore &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger, informing them, that <HI>Lord's-Day, September</HI> 11th he would be with them. And in his Journal of that Day &s;ays.</P>
<Q><P>I preach'd at <HI>Kaunaumeek.</HI> I had about 30 Hearers. There were but few <HI>Indians</HI> that properly belong'd there but they gave Notice of my coming to all that liv'd near them; &s;o that a con&s;iderable Number were got together. Some of the Chief of our <HI>Indians</HI> bore me Company. I had prepar'd a Sermon in <HI>Indian</HI> for the Occa&s;ion. They heard me with great Attention, and &s;aid they under&s;tood me.</P>
<P>We were entertain'd very kindly: The chief Man there who&s;e Name was <HI>Aunauwauneekbbeek,</HI> appear'd to be a rational judicious Man. He can &s;peak a little Engli&s;h, and carries on &s;ome farming Bu&s;ine&s;s, and lives well. I a&s;k'd him before I came away; what he thought of what he had heard? He &s;aid he could not give any Judgment yet; for he had not &s;uf|ficiently inform'd him&s;elf. <HI>Christianity</HI> might be true; he could not pronounce again&s;t it, nor could he &s;ay it was right but added, that he &s;hould come to hear me &s;ometimes at <HI>Hou|&s;atunnuk,</HI> and inform him&s;elf further.</P>
<P>I was well pleas'd with his An&s;wer, and exhorted him to enquire further into the Matter; and not to forget to pray to God to in&s;truct him.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Indians</HI> that were with me took Pains to per&s;uade them to embrace the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, and endeavour'd to an&s;wer tho&s;e Objections they &s;uppos'd might ari&s;e in their Minds again&s;t it; particularly the <HI>Lieutenant</HI> talk'd a great deal, and very well, upon the Subject.</P>
<P>Another Man there, of &s;ome Character, and of good Be|haviour, who had been baptiz'd in his Infancy, by &s;ome Priest, was well inclined to Religion; and purpos'd to come and live with us.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="62" REF="007023_0067_102AEAC972FE2F18">A little more than a Month after this, <HI>viz. Lord's-Day, Oc|tober</HI> the 9th, the two principal <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Kaunaumeek</HI> were at <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> and heard Mr. SERGEANT preach. <Q>&mdash;took Oppor unity (&s;ays he) to di&s;cour&s;e with them both, and parti|cularly with the <HI>Chief,</HI> who now was free to own that he be|lieved the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion was true, and that he was deter|min'd to be a <HI>Christian.</HI> And added, that he had receiv'd &s;uch an Impre&s;&s;ion on his Mind, from what he had heard from me, and otherwi&s;e, of the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, that he could not &s;hake it off; that his Thoughts had been much fix'd upon the Matter; that, even in the Pur&s;uit of his common Bu&s;ine&s;s, the could not but entertain him&s;elf with Reflections of this Nature. The other appear'd to be fully determin'd to come and live with us.</Q></P>
<Q><HI>Lord's Day,</HI> 16th. Preach'd as u&s;ual. This Week I went upon a Vi&s;it to my Friends in <HI>New-Jer&s;ey.</HI> In the mean Time the <HI>Chief</HI> of the <HI>Kaunaumeek Indians</HI> came hither, in Expecta|tion to &s;ee me, and hear &s;ome further In&s;tructions in the Doc|trines of <HI>Christianity</HI>; and tarried about a Week: &s;eem'd much affected with what he heard of the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, and very de&s;irous of further In&s;truction; purpos'd to come again when he could hear of my Return.</Q>
<P>That I may here fini&s;h the Story of the&s;e two principal <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Kaunaumeek viz. Aunauwauneekbbeek</HI> and <HI>Wautaunkumeet.</HI> I &s;hall look forward to <HI>January</HI> 22. <HI>February</HI> 12, and <HI>April</HI> 16. 1738.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Lord's-Day, January</HI> 22d. I preach'd again at <HI>Kaunaumeek, Aunauwauneekbbeek</HI> the principal Man there appear'd to be mightily engag'd in Matters of Religion; was de&s;irous of <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI>; &s;ent his Daughter, an only Child, to learn to read; came him&s;elf and tarried all the Week. And I, having good Satisfaction of his Knowledge and Faith, baptiz'd him and his Daughter.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Lord's-Day, February</HI> 12. I preach'd as u&s;ual. Pre&s;ent <HI>Au|nauwauneekbbeek,</HI> and <HI>Wautaunkumeet,</HI> from <HI>Kaunaumeek.</HI> The la&s;t left his Son with me.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Lord's-Day, April</HI> 16th. I baptiz'd <HI>Wautaunkumeet,</HI> and two of his Children. He belong'd to <HI>Kaunaumeek,</HI> but is &s;ince

come to live with us; is a Man of about forty Years of Age, very good temper'd, and of con&s;iderable Knowledge: formerly addicted to Drinking, but now reform'd.</P></Q>
<P>The generous Propo&s;al of Mr. <HI>Hollis,</HI> to maintain 12 Boys, was not till now put in Execution. And what Mr SERGEANT &s;ays of it in his Journal is.</P>
<Q><HI>January</HI> 11th 1737, 8. I began to keep the 12 <HI>Indian</HI> Boys on Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI>'s Foundation. I took them into my own Hou&s;e, and under my In&s;truction.</Q>
<P>It was in the Spring of the Year 1736 when the Rev. Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> receiv'd from Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI> the Offer of maintaining 20 Scholars at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk.</HI> The <HI>Doctor</HI>'s Caution in the Affair, mention'd before, delay'd the coming of the Money till the Spring of the Year 1737. Some Time al&s;o was taken up in getting their Cloaths from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> making of them up, &amp;c. And even then there was no Hou&s;e in <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> but Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI>'s, which was &s;mall. Mr. SERGEANT therefore, who was building this Summer, and intending to take the Boys under his own In&s;truction, tho't be&s;t to put it off, till his own Hou&s;e could be prepar'd to receive them. And accordingly, having prepar'd it, hir'd a Hou&s;e Keeper; and, at the Time above mention'd, he tool them in.</P>
<P>It is probable, his Hou&s;e would have been ready for their Reception &s;ooner, if he had not been in Want of Money to forward the building of it.</P>
<P>His Salary was no more than <HI>One Hundred and fifty Pounds</HI> our Money, <HI>twenty-&s;even Shillings and &s;ix Pence</HI> of which was then equal to one Ounce of Silver. And, by Rea&s;on of a ge|neral Scarcity, all Provi&s;ions were very dear. Little or Nothing could therefore be &s;par'd from his Salary towards building.</P>
<P>By a Letter of <HI>April</HI> 25. 1737. he inform'd the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> of his being about to build; de&s;iring &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tance from them to defrey the Charge of it. In An&s;wer to which the honourable <HI>Adam Winthrop</HI> inform'd him, that he would &s;ay his Letter before the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> at their next Meeting, which would not be very &s;oon, for they lately met.

<P>Is it not manife&s;t, from the&s;e Things, that Mr. <HI>Barclay</HI> di&s;co|ver'd a noble, generous, and Chri&s;tian Spirit, in giving him&s;elf to the Service of God among the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> that he might be an In&s;trument in the Hand of God, of reforming &amp; chri&s;tianizing them?

<P>It is well known to us in this Part of the World, that the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> or <HI>Six-Nations,</HI> are a Terror to, and have in great Mea&s;ure the Command of, all the <HI>Natives</HI> of <HI>North-America.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> have therefore u&s;ed their utmo&s;t Endeavours all along to engage them in their Intere&s;t; and by their Mi&s;&s;ionaries, who are con&s;tantly among them, they have drawn off many of them to &s;ettle at <HI>Canada,</HI> and more or le&s;s, every Year, go over to them; from whom, in Time of War with the <HI>French,</HI> the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Provinces in <HI>North-America,</HI> e&s;pecially the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">achu&s;ett<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and <HI>New Hampshire,</HI> &s;uffer much.

<P>Their Circum&s;tances therefore loudly call for the compa&s;&s;ionate Help of tho&s;e who are able to promote the <HI>Propagation of the Go&s;pel</HI> among them.&mdash; And here I would beg leave to &s;ay, the honourable <HI>Society for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel in foreign Parts</HI> do, out of the Charity they are betru&s;ted with, maintain <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionaries</HI> at <HI>Bo&s;ton, New-Port, Stratford,</HI> and are frequently &s;ending them to other Places, where their Pari&s;hioners are well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> honourably to &s;upport them, which evidences it to be plain

Whether Mr. <HI>Barclay,</HI> who was &s;o heartily engag'd in that excellent and &s;elf denying Service of propagating the Go&s;pel among the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> &s;hould not have been encourag'd by a plentiful Support from the <HI>Society,</HI> and al&s;o by the Support of a School-Ma&s;ter and Interpreter for his A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, rather than a Mi&s;&s;ionary at <HI>Bo&s;ton, Newport,</HI> &amp;c? Who would it not grieve to think, that that good Gentleman has been oblig'd to leave that Service for want of Encouragement, when there was &s;uch a Pro&s;pect of his doing much Good among tho&s;e peri&s;hing Nations? What other Rea&s;on Mr. <HI>Barclay</HI> had for leaving them, I am not able to &s;ay; but if he had no other than the want of a &s;ufficient Support, and of an Interpreter, was not that Rea&s;on quite &s;ufficient?

E&s;pecially con&s;idering he liv'd in a Place where all the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life mu&s;t be purcha&s;ed at a very dear Rate; and where his tender Heart could not but be mov'd to relieve the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> who&s;e piteous Circum&s;tances daily pleaded for them, and were enough to move a Heart much harder than his.</P>
<P>It was with a very grateful Spirit, both to God and his Bene|factors, that Mr. SERGEANT receiv'd tho&s;e Donations. He e&s;teem'd every Kindne&s;s be&s;tow'd upon him on Account of his <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion,</HI> as a Favour from Heaven, a new Obligation upon him to be faithful in his Work, and a Talent for which he was <HI>accountable to the Lord of all</HI>; as in his Writings he frequently expre&s;s'd him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He al&s;o u&s;ed his be&s;t Endeavours to impre&s;s upon the Minds of the <HI>Indians</HI> a grateful Sen&s;e of the Kindne&s;s of their Benefac|tors; the Account of which &s;eem'd very much to affect them. And at the clo&s;e of this Year they were laid under a new Obli|gation, by a generous Gift of <HI>three Hundred Pounds</HI> from the honourable <HI>Society</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> Part of which was employ'd in purcha&s;ing Ploughs, Axes, Hoes, &amp;c. to help them in carrying on their Hu&s;bandry. How the Re&s;t of the Money was expend|ed, does not appear from any of the Papers before me; but I find, by a Letter from Secretary <HI>Winthrop</HI> to Mr. SERGEANT,
<PB N="73" REF="007023_0078_102AEADD590BE168">
that he judg'd it not be&s;t that the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hould have the whole Donation at once, but that it &s;hou'd be gradually dealt out to them as their Circum&s;tances requir'd; which I therefore &s;uppo&s;e was the Method taken, and that it was from Time to Time us'd to their be&s;t Advantage; and I am inclin'd to think, that it was principally, if not wholly, employ'd for their Encouragement in Hu&s;bandry and Building, from a Pa&s;&s;age in Governor <HI>Belcher</HI>'s Letter written to him on the Subject, <HI>December</HI> 5th 1738.<Q>&mdash;I have talk'd with Mr. Secretary <HI>Winthrop</HI> (&s;ays His <HI>Ex|cellency</HI>) of the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Money come from the honour|able <HI>Company</HI> at <HI>Home,</HI> that it may be mo&s;tly employ'd to promote Labour among your People, by giving them Hu&s;ban|dry Tools, as Axes, Carts, Ploughs, &amp;c. to a&s;&s;i&s;t in building <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hou&s;es: To <HI>civilize</HI> them will be a good Introduction to the <HI>Chri&s;tianizing</HI> of them. I &s;hall again talk with Secre|tary <HI>Winthrop,</HI> and others of the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners,</HI> that this Method may be put in Practice without Delay.</Q>&mdash;But after all it does not appear, that they ever receiv'd the whole; tho' it might be &s;o, and Mr. SERGEANT make no mention of it.</P>
<P>The former Part of <HI>June</HI> this Year, <HI>Ephraim Williams,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and Mr. <HI>Josiah Jones,</HI> brought their Families to <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> and &s;et|tled there; being two of the four <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Families, who, by Order of the <HI>General Court,</HI> were to &s;ettle there, for Mr. SER|GEANT's Comfort &amp; Benefit of the <HI>Indians.</HI> Lieutenant <HI>Brown,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Joseph Woodbridge,</HI> were the other, who came &s;ome Time after.</P>
<P>In the Year 1739, &s;everal of the <HI>River-Indians,</HI> who liv'd at a Di&s;tance from <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> di&s;cover'd an Inclination to hear Mr. SERGEANT preach.

<P>I tell you &s;omething further. When I get up in the Morning, I will plant my Corn; at Noon it will be ripe, &s;o that I &s;hall have enough to eat till Night. The next Morning I do the &s;ame again, and &s;o from Time to Time, as long as God &s;hall give me Life and Strength.</P></Q>
<P>This was deliver'd with <HI>one Half</HI> of the <HI>Belt</HI>; with the other, <HI>Brother, don't hide my good Thing from me.</HI></P>

And this <HI>Tribe</HI> were now de&s;ir'd to come into the Projection. They therefore pre|par'd three <HI>Belts</HI> of <HI>Wompum,</HI> with di&s;tinct Me&s;&s;ages to each. Two of the <HI>Belts</HI> were to be &s;ent to a Tribe of <HI>Ea&s;tern Indians,</HI> that live at a Place they call <HI>Wtan&s;hekaunb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ukko.</HI> The third to a Tribe &s;till further Ea&s;tward, at a Place they call <HI>Naunau|choowuk,</HI> (the &s;ame I &s;uppo&s;e which is generally in <HI>New-England,</HI> call'd <HI>Norridgewock.</HI>) It will perhaps be thought an excu&s;eable Digre&s;&s;ion to in&s;ert tho&s;e Speeches in this Journal.</P>
<P>With the fir&s;t Belt they &s;ay,</P>
<P>Brother, We have always liv'd in &s;trict Alliance with you by Leagues of Friend&s;hip, long ago enter'd into by our fore Fathers; and we have been wont from Time to Time to con&s;ult together what is be&s;t to be done, and to communicate our Determinations one to another: We therefore depend upon it you will be willing to bear us, becau&s;e we have been always Friends.</P>
<P>Second Belt,</P>
<P>Brother at <HI>Wtan&s;hekaunhtukko.</HI> By this we may know we are Brethren, becau&s;e we have one Father in Heaven, the Lord of all. Let us have a tender Regard to our Families. The white People, with whom we re&s;pectively live in Alliance, are about to enter into a War. We only de&s;troy our&s;elves by medling with their Wars. They are great and strong, and reach to the Clouds.</P>
<P>Let us &s;it and look on when they engage. Don't let any of your People a&s;&s;i&s;t in their Wars. And while they fight, let us &s;it and &s;moke together.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="007023_0083_102AEAE755995F88">Therefore three of your Brethren &s;end you this Me&s;&s;age, from the <HI>Highlands, Monhekun,</HI> and <HI>Scattekook.</HI></P>

<P>A very ju&s;t and rational Scheme this, and, had it &s;ucceeded, would have been much to the Advantage of the <HI>Indians,</HI> as well as to us. But there is little or no Pro&s;pect of &s;uch a Neutrality taking Place, &s;o long as the <HI>French</HI> have &s;uch as A&s;cendent over many of them.</P>
<P>Though the <HI>Indians</HI> had, for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, improved the interval Land at <HI>Stockbridge</HI>; yet it was not divided to them, that every one might know and improve his own Property, till this Year. In <HI>May</HI> Se&s;&s;ion of the <HI>General Court,</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> pre|fer'd a Petition to the <HI>Assembly,</HI> that it might be done; and they accordingly appointed Col. <HI>Stoddard,</HI> and <HI>Ephraim Williams,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to divide the Land to them; which they did to the Satisfaction of the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 16.

<P>It was with a humble and grateful Spirit that Mr. SERGEANT receiv'd the&s;e Donations. In his Letter to the <HI>Dotter,</HI> of <HI>July</HI> 17th he &s;ays.</P>

Tho&s;e al&s;o who kept Taverns in neighbouring Places, and had &s;old Drink to &s;uch <HI>Indians</HI> as were given to Exce&s;s, they reprov'd, and endeavour'd to di&s;&s;uade them from a Practice which prov'd &s;o hurtful to the <HI>Indians.</HI> But &s;ome evil-minded Per&s;ons, among the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> made a Handle of tho&s;e Things to di&s;gu&s;t the <HI>Indians</HI>; telling them, that this was an unrea&s;onable Incroachment upon their Liberty; that tho&s;e who abridg'd them of the Liberty of u&s;ing Drink, would by and by incroach upon their other Liber|ties; that they were us'd wor&s;e than <HI>Slaves</HI>; that they were treated as if they were <HI>Dogs,</HI> and the like. By the&s;e In&s;inuations the <HI>Indians</HI> (who are as fond of Liberty, as of &s;trong Drink) were much di&s;turb'd, and &s;ome of them went into great Degrees of Exce&s;s; and New-Year's Day being at Hand, which the <HI>Dutch</HI> frequently honour by being Drunk upon it, by who&s;e Example the <HI>Indians</HI> were ea&s;ily led into the Practice, Mr. SER|GEANT was greatly concern'd, le&s;t it &s;hould be a Day of great Di&s;order with them; to prevent which he took a very prudent Method; which I &s;hall give in his own Words.</P>
<P><Q><HI>December</HI> 30th 1739. Preach'd as u&s;ual, and propos'd to have an Exerci&s;e of publick Wor&s;hip on New-Year's Day, now at Hand: for I &s;uppo&s;ed the <HI>Indians</HI> de&s;ign'd to have a great Frolick on that Occa&s;ion, after the Manner of the <HI>Dutch</HI> in the neighbouring Government, who&s;e Example they are very apt to follow: And I thought to have a publick Exerci&s;e on that Day, the mo&s;t likely Method to prevent &s;uch Exce&s;s; which accordingly &s;ucceeded. For on that Day (<HI>January</HI> the 1&s;t) the <HI>Indians</HI> were univer&s;ally at Meeting, and there was no Drinking at all, tho' there was plenty of Rum in the Town. Which was a rare In&s;tance of Moderation at that Sea&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>Tho' there were &s;ome di&s;orderly Per&s;ons among the <HI>Indians,</HI> who were too free with &s;trong Drink, yet this was what the grea|ter Part of them lamented, and they &s;till, in the general, conti|nued to behave well.</P>
<P>Their Number at <HI>Stockbridge</HI> from Time to Time increas'd, by the Addition of new Families from Abroad; &s;o that from
<PB N="82" REF="007023_0087_102AEAEFB4F4EA50">
about 50, the Number when Mr. SERGEANT went among them, they were now increas'd to 120.</P>
<P>Mr SERGEANT in his Journal of <HI>March</HI> 27th 1740. &s;ays, <Q>The whole Number of Inhabitants is 120. Our Number is increas'd by the Addition of new Families, but reckoning by Births and Deaths the Number is &s;omewhat le&s;&s;en'd; which has one Year with another been the Ca&s;e ever &s;ince I have been acquainted with the&s;e <HI>Indians.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This perhaps is the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Indians</HI> in general, who live bordering upon, and among the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Their Numbers do not increa&s;e, but in &s;ome Places they are dimini&s;h'd &amp; come almo&s;t to Nothing. For which divers Rea&s;ons may be a&s;&s;ign'd, <HI>viz.</HI> Their Intemperance. They are &s;o often Drunk, both Men and Women, that it is doubtle&s;s ruinous to the Con&s;titutions both of Parents and Children.&mdash;Their great Irregularity in Diet, may be another Rea&s;on; for they frequently go without eating any Thing two or three Days, and when they come again where it is to be had, they eat an immoderate Quantity, &s;et no Bounds to their Appetite, but croud down whatever they can.&mdash;Again, When they are &s;ick, they take little or no Care of them&s;elves, or of one another; for &s;o long as the &s;ick Per&s;on can &s;tand and walk, he goes out of Doors upon all Occa&s;ions, be it Rain or Snow, or whatever the Weather is, and whatever Di&s;temper he is exercis'd with. And in the mean Time they make u&s;e of few, or no Means to help the Sick. It is a Wonder therefore that they be not all &s;ick, and that any recover when they are &s;o!</P>

<P>In the foremention'd Letter of <HI>March</HI> 14th 1741.

Work, as getting Wood, Planting, Howing, &amp;c The Men ge|nerally e&s;teem it a Shame for them to follow any <HI>other</HI> Bu&s;ine&s;s <HI>but that of Hunting.</HI> Hence the Women cannot, if they would, be acquainted with I Hou&s;ewifry, being oblig'd to carry on all the Bu&s;ine&s;s abroad. Mr. SERGEANT's De&s;ign therefore was better to regulate their Conduct in that Re&s;pect, by taking their Chil|dren, when young, and training up, both Sexes, in Bu&s;ine&s;s proper for them, that when they &s;hould be grown up, they might be both able and willing to provide for them&s;elves in a Way of Di|ligence and Indu&s;try, which would in great Mea&s;ure free them from many of tho&s;e Temptations, by which they are now in&s;nar'd; and enable them to make a much better Figure than they now do, or can do, while they continue entire Strangers to all the Arts of Indu&s;try and good Living, and indulge them&s;elves in Idlene&s;s.</P>
<P><Q>I have (&s;ays Mr. SERGEANT to the <HI>Doctor</HI>) entertain'd Thoughts (and they have made a &s;trong Impre&s;&s;ion on my Mind) of attempting to &s;et up a <HI>Charity-Hou&s;e,</HI> for the In&s;truction of our <HI>Indian</HI> Children, both Boys and Girls, in Bu&s;ine&s;s and In|du&s;try, as well as in Reading, and Writing, and the Matters of Religion. Whether the Motion be from God, Time will make more manife&s;t. I &s;hould be glad of your Opinion of the Thing. This I believe Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI> expected would be the End of his noble Beginning. The De&s;ign, I am certain, is good; whether it be fea&s;ible, you may be a better Judge than I. It is what I have tho't of for a long Time; but &s;uppos'd the Jealou&s;ies of the <HI>Indians</HI> would be a Bar in the Way; but hop'd that Difficulties of that Nature would vani&s;h with Time. I have kept the De&s;ign to my&s;elf, nor have I ever mention'd it to any of the <HI>Indians.</HI> It may perhaps now be Time to act upon it. I doubt not but I can procure a good Accommoda|tion of Land for &s;uch a Purpo&s;e. The Charge I know would be con&s;iderable; but after a While it is to be hop'd, with the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, they may be able to maintain them&s;elves, at lea&s;t in great Mea&s;ure. If I &s;hould attempt &s;uch a Thing, I pray God &s;pare your Life to a&s;&s;i&s;t in it, by your Advice, Prayers, and Influence with your Corre&s;pondents Abroad; and to introduce me into their Acquaintance.&mdash;</Q></P>

<Q><P>Your Favour of <HI>February</HI> 9th came to Hand a few Days ago, which has laid me under Obligations to <HI>You,</HI> and the honour|able <HI>Committee</HI> of <HI>Directors,</HI> for the kind and unde&s;erv'd good Opinion you are pleas'd to entertain of me, &amp; for your Prayers (which I highly value) offer'd on my Behalf, to the God of all Grace. I a&s;k your continu'd Prayers for me, that I may have Grace to be found faithful and &s;ucce&s;sful, in promoting the Kingdom of our glorious Lord, who has honour'd me with &s;o great and important a Tru&s;t, as that of Preaching the

everla&s;ting Go&s;pel, where his Name has not been known; and in which, thro' the Grace of God, I've Rea&s;on to hope my Labour has not been altogether in vain.</P>
<P>There appears to me a fair Pro&s;pect of a happy Mi&s;&s;ion to a Tribe or <HI>Indians</HI> in &s;trict Alliance with ours, known by the Name of the <HI>Showancos,</HI> living in the Province of <HI>Pen&s;ylvania,</HI> about 220 Miles di&s;tant from us; to whom our <HI>Indians</HI> have recommended the Chri&s;tian Religion; but as yet have receiv'd no direct and particular An&s;wer: Only they have heard, that what they &s;ent occa&s;ion'd much Talk among them; and that &s;ome propos'd the &s;ending of two or three of their Children here, to be in&s;tructed in Chri&s;tianity, in order to teach them.</P>
<P>It was of the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> I &s;pake to the Rev. Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> la&s;t Fall; letting him know, that I de&s;ign'd, by the Favour of divine Providence, to make them a Vi&s;it, and to endeavour to open the Way for the glorious Go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t among them; and de&s;ir'd his Intere&s;t and the Rev. Mr. <HI>Pem|berton</HI>'s with your honourable <HI>Society,</HI> for the Support of &s;uch Mi&s;&s;ion, if God &s;hould open the Door for it.</P>
<P>And now I thank God, and you, into who&s;e Heart he has put it, to contribute to this charitable De&s;ign; which I pray God in his infinite Mercy to &s;ucceed, to the Glory of his Name among the Gentiles, and to the Honour of his Son, <HI>who is made Head over all Things to the Church.</HI></P>
<P>Forty Pounds Sterling is indeed the lea&s;t a Gentleman em|ploy'd in &s;uch Service can expect. It is very nece&s;&s;ary Under|takings of this Nature &s;hould be well &s;upported, that the Mi&s;&s;ionary may have no other Concern, than to attend the Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Mi&s;&s;ion, in which he will find he has Work enough to do, and mu&s;t put on Re&s;olution not to be &s;haken by &s;mall Oppo&s;ition. I intend (God willing) before Winter to make my propos'd Vi&s;it to tho&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> after which I may be able to give you a more particular Account. But now proceed, according to your De&s;ire, to give a Hi&s;tory of the Advances Chri&s;tianity has made among us.</P></Q>
<P>The <HI>Hi&s;torical Account</HI> here &s;poken of, Mr. SERGEANT &s;ent to the honourable <HI>Society</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but had no Time to take a Copy of it, as he inform'd the Rev. Mr. <HI>Pemberton</HI> of <HI>New-York</HI> to whom he &s;ent it, to be tran&s;mitted to <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> Had a
<PB N="88" REF="007023_0093_102AEAFC79A15F48">
Copy of it been kept, it would have been a very great Help to me in compo&s;ing this Work; for Mr. <GAP DESC="blank"> from his own Papers, Memory, &amp;c. doubtle&s;s, was able to give a much better Account of Things than I can po&s;&s;ibly do, from the few Papers before me: and without Doubt he gave a very ju&s;t and correct Account of what pa&s;s'd from the Beginning of his Mi&s;&s;ion to that Time. After his Hi&s;tory he goes on to &s;ay,</P>
<Q><P>Thus, Sir, I have given an Account of the Progre&s;s Chri&s;|tianity has made here, with &s;ome general Account of our pre|&s;ent State of Affairs. I began to write pre&s;ently after I re|ceiv'd your Letter in <HI>July</HI> la&s;t, and de&s;ign'd to have prepar'd the An&s;wer to yours, and &s;ent it before Winter; but the afflic|ted Circum&s;tances of my Family prevented me then, and by one Interruption &amp; another, I have not been able to fini&s;h it till now. I have been &s;o particular, that, perhaps, I &s;hall be thought tedious. In this Point I hope your Candour will ex|cu&s;e me. I have omitted a great many Particulars.</P>
<P>You will ea&s;ily perceive, in the Peru&s;al of this Journal, that the <HI>Indians</HI> are a very difficult People to deal with; whoever undertakes to have much to do with them, had need to fortify him&s;elf with an ob&s;tinate Patience, Oppo&s;ition I always ex|pected, but met with it in In&s;tances where I dreamt not of it, and lea&s;t expected it. The Devil has always his Temptations and In&s;truments to promote his Cau&s;e. A Number we have, I hope, that are truly converted.</P>
<P>Our Affairs are now in a good and flouri&s;hing State, con&s;i|dering the Oppo&s;ition the Go&s;pel has met with, e&s;pecially from &s;ome profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians; I think, the Progre&s;s it has made has been extraordinary. May God own his Work and ble&s;s it.</P>
<P>I purpo&s;e, by the Favour of God, &s;ome Time next Month to make my Vi&s;it to the <HI>Showancos.</HI> What I meet with among them I will tran&s;mit you an Account of. Let me have the Ble&s;&s;ing of your Prayers, that, however unworthy, I may be made an In&s;trument of promoting the Kingdom and Glory of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord. And may God crown all your pious and charitable De&s;igns with happy Succe&s;s, and you finally with immortal Glory. And grant me the Honour of being reputed,</P></Q>

<P>'The Me&s;&s;age we carried was this,</P>
<P>Brother, who have &s;een &s;o many Mornings here at <HI>Mukhhau|waumuk,</HI> you live in Friend&s;hip with our Grandfather, our League reaches as far as the great <HI>I&s;land,</HI> and the River <HI>Auwuk&s;auntuguh.</HI> The Rea&s;on of my coming, is, becau&s;e I di&s;like our Way of living; our Father above does not approve of it, we weary out his Patience.</P>
<P>You always stand in the Pre&s;ence of our Father, and he would have his Children turn about to him. I am come to turn you to him. If you pity your Body &amp; Soul, you will receive the <HI>Chri&s;tian Reli|gion.</HI> It is always the Priviledge of an elder Brother to teach his younger Brother, if he knows any Thing that is Good. If his Bro|ther be lo&s;t, he will tell him, <HI>This is the Way to Life.</HI></P>
<P>The enlightening of the Eyes is in the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion.</HI> You will &s;ome Time come to know that we have been lo&s;t.

They were wont in the Conclu&s;ion of their Speeches to &s;ay, now I &s;ee the Sun at Noon you &s;hall always &s;ee clearly; you &s;hall &s;ee Nothing ami&s;s: But the&s;e Things which they &s;pake in Darkne&s;s were Nothing.

<P>This Me&s;&s;age your Brother at <HI>Mauhekun</HI> &s;ends you: He likes the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion.</HI></P>
<P>It mu&s;t be noted that the <HI>Showanoos</HI> call our <HI>Indians</HI> their elder Brother, and ours call them their younger Brother.</P>
<P>When we had deliver'd this <HI>Me&s;&s;age,</HI> they retir'd a lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le While, and then brought in their An&s;wer; which was to this Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It is true, we have one Father above, and we are always in his Pre&s;ence. The <HI>Indians</HI> have one Way of honouring and plea&s;ing him, and the <HI>White People</HI> have another; both are acceptable to Him. I am glad to hear from my Brother, and to cultivate Friend&s;hip with him. He &s;hall always find me here if he has any Me&s;&s;age to &s;end: But <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> need not be the Bond of Union between us. As for your Teacher I cannot under&s;tand him. If I could under&s;tand him, it might be well to hear him; but be &s;peaks in an unknown Tongue.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to &s;ee, by this An&s;wer, they had no Mind to receive Chri&s;tianity. However, I de&s;ir'd them to hear &s;ome|thing I had to &s;ay, and they agreed it &s;hould be then imme|diately. I went out about half an Hour to prepare my In|terpreter, by reading my Di&s;cour&s;e to him. When I came in again, I found many of them di&s;pers'd, and while I was &s;peak|ing their Chief went out. They gave no &s;erious Attention at all to what I &s;aid. When I had done, they pre&s;ently fell to talking, and reproaching Chri&s;tianity; and &s;hew'd an utter Aver&s;ion to it. I would have enter'd into a Debate with them, and endeavour'd to remove their Prejudices, and an&s;wer'd their Objections; but they would hear Nothing of the Matter. I found they had &s;trong and invincible Prejudices again&s;t Chri&s;|tianity, at lea&s;t the Prote&s;tant Religion; deriv'd, it &s;hou'd &s;eem, from the <HI>French,</HI> and confirm'd by their own Ob&s;ervation of the Behaviour of that vile Sort of Men the Traders, that go among them; for they &s;aid (which I believe is an unhappy and reproachful Truth) that they would lie, cheat, and debauch their Women, and even their Wives, if their Hu&s;bands were
<PB N="91" REF="007023_0096_102AEB01EEF5BA80">
not at Home. They were further prejudic'd again&s;t Chri&s;|tianity from the inho&s;pitable Treatment they had &s;ometimes met with from tho&s;e who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians. They &s;aid the <HI>Sinnicas</HI> (a Tribe of <HI>Indians</HI> much under the Influence of the <HI>French</HI>) gave them their Country where they now live; but charg'd them withal never to receive Chri&s;tianity from us.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> &s;pread their Influence far and wide, and indeed I believe (which I was not &s;o much aware of before this Jour|ney) that they have &s;catter'd their Poi&s;on among all the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>North America,</HI> and have been the Means of &s;tiring up that Jealou&s;y and Su&s;picion among our <HI>Indians</HI> which has made us &s;o much Difficulty in dealing with them: for they tell them that the De&s;ign of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> is to in&s;lave, and then to de&s;troy them, under the Pretence of making them Chri&s;tians. By the&s;e &s;trong Prejudices, I found them &s;o aver&s;e to the Reception of Chri&s;tianity, that I was di&s;courag'd in the Attempt, and &s;o left them, pitying their Ignorance, and praying God to open their Eyes.</P>
<P>When I returned to <HI>Delaware,</HI> I got the <HI>Indians</HI> inhabiting there, together, and preach'd to them in our Dialect, which they could under&s;tand without an Interpreter. They were about 30 in Number to hear me, who gave a very diligent Attention, and &s;eem'd to be mov'd, had no Objections to make, but were de|&s;irous of further In&s;truction. I preached to them twice. The whole Tribe is about 400 in Number; but is much di&s;pers'd, having no Accommodation of Land; but I have engag'd &s;ome Gentlemen to endeavour to provide for them in that Re&s;pect: which, if it can be effected, to their Satisfaction, there is a hope|ful Pro&s;pect of a &s;ucce&s;sful Mi&s;&s;ion among them. I have drawn out a Journal containing a particular Account of the Propaga|tion of Chri&s;tianity among us, which I have &s;ent to the Rev.

<P>As Mr. <HI>Drummond,</HI> in his foregoing Letter, de&s;ires, by Order of the <HI>Directors,</HI> that Mr. SERGEANT would favour them with a particular Corre&s;pondence, and that he would begin it by giving them an Hi&s;torical Account of the Progre&s;s Religion had made among the <HI>Indians,</HI> &amp;c. So Mr. SERGEANT comply'd with their De&s;ires, &s;ent an Hi&s;torical Account, and wrote the foregoing Letter. But I find no Return he ever had from Mr. <HI>Drummond,</HI> or any other Member of that <HI>Society,</HI> nor any further Corre&s;pon|dence with it; except a Letter Mr. SERGEANT wrote to the <HI>Pre&s;ident,</HI> for the Time, of that <HI>Society</HI> of <HI>May</HI> the 18th 1749. de&s;iring, if it fell within their Sphere, that they would a&s;&s;i&s;t in promoting the <HI>Boarding-School,</HI> then begun at <HI>Stockbridge.</HI> Whe|ther Mr. SERGEANT's Letter fail'd by the Way, or what el&s;e happen'd to prevent a friendly Corre&s;pondence, I am not able to &s;ay.</P>

Before this I find him acknowledging, in a Letter to the <HI>Doctor,</HI> the Receipt of Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> upon Prayer. And <HI>June</HI> 1&s;t 1742. Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> &s;ays to him.</P>

due, and &s;hould have been return'd before now, had I not waited for the Pacquet that I might, being affected with greater Gratitude, return my Thanks with double Zeal. The Books are lately come to Hand, a mo&s;t acceptable Pre&s;ent; nor have I had Time to peru&s;e them, more than ju&s;t to have a Ta&s;te of Dr. <HI>Watts's</HI> Spirit.</P>
<P>When I &s;peak of Dr. <HI>Watts's</HI> Spirit in his Writings, I mean &s;omething the mo&s;t excellent to be found in Humane Nature, and near akin to angelick Dignity, there is &s;omething &s;o ju&s;t and rational, and at the &s;ame Time &s;o mode&s;t, candid and generous in that Gentleman's Sentiments, that they &s;trongly impre&s;s the Mind, and engage the Attention and Affections. Would to God the &s;ame Spirit of Candour and &s;uperior Devo|tion &s;hew'd it&s;elf in all Writings, e&s;pecially of Divines, and reign'd in the Heart of every Chri&s;tian: How many needle&s;&s; Controver&s;ies would be ended by it? And how much &s;inful Divi&s;ion cea&s;e in the Chri&s;tian World? Alas! how much Need have we, at this Day, of the &s;ame Candour and Largene&s;s of Soul? Certainly, methinks, that Devotion mu&s;t be le&s;s accep|table to God, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in a Soul confin'd and narrow to|wards its Fellow-Men. May divine Grace enable me to be wi&s;er and better by tho&s;e Means Providence by you has put into my Hands, to make me &s;o; and may the Ble&s;&s;ings of God re&s;t on you for all your Kindne&s;s to me. I am a&s;ham'd to de&s;erve &s;o little of the generous and benevolent Notice you have taken of me: But I know 'tis your greate&s;t Satisfaction to do Good; nor will Heaven forget to reward the Benevolence of your Heart, how little &s;oever I have merited your kind Notice. Forgive me. Sir, if Gratitude con&s;trains me to write, what perhaps will be offen&s;ive to that Mode&s;ty, which almo&s;t makes you forget your good Deeds. I thank you particularly for your own Sermon, and am glad to find in it &s;o ju&s;t a Cen&s;ure of &s;ome Things, which unhappily darken the Glory of what has appear'd to bear &s;o many Marks of a divine Work in this Land. &mdash; I have the Satisfaction to inform you, that there &s;eems to appear a more than common Spirit of Seriou&s;ne&s;s and Reformation among our <HI>Indians,</HI> and a pretty general Di&s;po&s;ition among the <HI>Indians</HI> in the&s;e Parts round about us, to receive In&s;truction.&mdash;</P>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="94" REF="007023_0099_102AEBA98FE14308">Dr. <HI>Colman,</HI> being acquainted with Mr. SERGEANT's De&s;ign of &s;etting up a <HI>Boarding-School</HI> at <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> as before related, inform'd the Rev. Mr. <HI>I&s;aac Hollis</HI> of it, who was di&s;po&s;ed to encourage it; as appears from the <HI>Doctor</HI>'s Letter of <HI>September</HI> 27th 1742. to Mr. SERGEANT, in which are the following Pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P><Q>Ye&s;terday came to me another Letter from the Rev. Mr. <HI>Hollis,</HI> wherein he expre&s;&s;es his Wonder and very great Offence, that nothing more is done by us here in <HI>New-England,</HI> for the Propagation of Chri&s;tian Knowledge among the Heathen; which declares, he thinks, we have no Care for their Souls. You at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> (&s;ays he) might &s;ave it out of your fine <HI>Hollands, Silks,</HI> and <HI>Laces,</HI> and <HI>&s;uperfine Woollen Cloths</HI>; and have a School erected for <HI>Heathen</HI> Children in Imitation of what <HI>he</HI> has e&s;&s;ay'd already. As to our &s;uperfluous Expences, I mu&s;t an&s;wer and plead guilty; but as for the <HI>School,</HI> Difficulties attending it from the Indi&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>Indians</HI> to &s;end their Children, or tho&s;e to come if a School were open'd, I mu&s;t leave you to lay before him. The good Gentleman promi&s;es to lend a helping Hand to &s;uch a School, if it were &s;et up here.</Q></P>
<P>That charitable and generous Gentleman Mr. <HI>Hollis,</HI> had been at the Expence of about <HI>two Hundred and eight Pounds</HI> Sterling, in the Space of about four or five Years, for the Benefit of the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> which was then upwards of <HI>one Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> our Money; as appears from a Pa&s;&s;age in Dr. <HI>Colman</HI>'s Return in Compliance with Mr. SERGEANT's Reque&s;t. <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 20th 1743, the whole of which will by and by be inw&s;erted.</P>
<P>The Pa&s;&s;age is,</P>
<P><Q>&mdash;<HI>November</HI> 19. 1736. I receiv'd from Mr. <HI>Hollis,</HI> his Bill on Col. <HI>Wendell,</HI> to pay <HI>fifty-&s;ix Pounds</HI> Sterling for the Education of 12 <HI>Indian</HI> Boys at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> under the Care of the Rev. Mr. SERGEANT. And <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 15, 1738 I had a &s;econd Order from him for <HI>three Hundred &amp; forty-three Pounds</HI> our Money. And again <HI>May</HI> 17. 1740. a third Order for <HI>four Hundred and forty-&s;even Pounds nine Shillings.</HI>&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>But what have we done in Compari&s;on of him? Have any of our wealthy Profe&s;&s;ors put to their helping Hand to this lau|dable and glorious De&s;ign? While he has been at the Expence of maintaining 12 Boys, has any private Gentleman <HI>New-Eng|land</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="007023_0100_102AD2BEF8291728">
been at the Expence of maintaining one? If therefore Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI> had been inform'd how little we do, is it at all &s;trange that he &s;hould <HI>expre&s;s his Wonder, and very great Offence, that nothing more is done by us</HI> here <HI>in New-England</HI> for the <HI>Propagation of Chri&s;tian Knowledge among the Heathen.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI> al&s;o, in the forementioned Letter to Dr. <HI>Colman,</HI> de&s;ir'd an Account from Mr. SERGEANT how his Money had been expended, and to what Purpo&s;e? Mr. SERGEANT therefore wrote to him, and not only gave him a particular &amp; &s;atisfactory Account how his Money had been laid out, but al&s;o of what Advantage it had been: That &s;everal of his Scholars had made great Progre&s;s in Learning, &amp;c:&mdash; But Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> having tran&s;crib'd the Sub&s;tance of that Letter, in his Recommendation of Mr. SERGEANT's Propo&s;al of a more effectual Method for the Education of <HI>Indian</HI> Children, which will come in hereafter, I &s;hall not in&s;ert it here.</P>
<P>The Difficulties which Mr. SERGEANT apprehended would attend &s;etting up a <HI>Boarding School, viz.</HI> the unrea&s;onable Jealou|&s;ies of the <HI>Indians,</HI> vani&s;h'd more and more, and he now tho't them ripe for &s;uch a Propo&s;al; and therefore wrote to Dr. <HI>Col|man</HI> upon that Subject, <HI>January</HI> 24th 1742, 3.</P>
<P><Q>&mdash;I am much pleas'd with Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI>'s Projection for a <HI>School</HI>&mdash;wrote to you a Year or two ago about that Matter;&mdash; then thought that the <HI>Indians</HI> would not bear &s;uch a De&s;ign; but now their Temper, e&s;pecially of late, &s;eems to be much alter'd for the better, and a more than ordinary Spirit of Reli|gion &s;eems to prevail. Thanks be to divine Grace for it! I am now of Opinion there is little or nothing on the Part of the <HI>Indians</HI> here, and in their Neighbourhood, to di&s;courage &s;uch an Attempt. And if you think it worth while (as indeed I think it is) to undertake &s;o great a Thing, I pray you, either by your&s;elf or by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome Friend that has a turn of Mind for &s;uch Projections, to draw up a <HI>general Plan</HI> of a <HI>School</HI> for the Education of <HI>Indian</HI> Children; which &s;hall pro|vide not only for their In&s;truction in Learning, but al&s;o in La|bour; and &s;end it to me, and I will try the Temper of the <HI>Indians</HI> with it. You may make &s;ome gue&s;s of the different Temper prevailing now among the <HI>Indians,</HI> from what did a few Years ago by this, that two of our young Women, not

long &s;ince, of their own Accord, de&s;ir'd me to provide them Places among the Engli&s;h, that they might live with them, and &s;upport them&s;elves by their own Labour in order to learn the Engli&s;h Languague &amp; Manners; tho' a few Years ago they would not be hir'd to it. And, accordingly, I &s;ent two of them to <HI>Northampton</HI> where they liv'd contented as far as I know.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>And in another Letter of <HI>April</HI> 7th he adds upon the &s;ame Subject.</P>
<P><Q>&mdash;You will find in what I have written to Mr. <HI>Hollis,</HI> that I have propo&s;ed the Affair of the free <HI>Boarding School</HI> to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and that they are mightily taken with it. I wait with Impatience for an An&s;wer to what I wrote you la&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>What Mr. SERGEANT wrote to Mr. <HI>Hollis,</HI> he &s;ent un&s;ealed to Dr. <HI>Colman,</HI> to which the <HI>Doctor</HI> has Re&s;pect in the Beginning of his Letter of <HI>May</HI> the 18th 1743. to Mr. SERGEANT.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Stockbridge,</HI> <DATE><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1. 1743</DATE>.</DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I now &s;end you a general and rough Draught of that De&s;ign for the <HI>Education of Indian Children,</HI> which I have &s;ome Times formerly hinted to you, that I had formed in my Mind, with a <HI>De&s;ire,</HI> that you would <HI>communicate</HI> it to the World in as publick a Manner, as po&s;&s;ible, and with &s;uch <HI>Recommendations,</HI> as you may think proper.</P>
<P>What I propo&s;e therefore in general is, to take &s;uch a <HI>Method</HI> in the Education of our <HI>Indian Children,</HI> as &s;hall in the mo&s;t effectual Manner change their whole Habit of thinking and acting; and rai&s;e them, as far as po&s;&s;ible, into the Condition of a civil indu&s;trious and poli&s;h'd People; while at the &s;ame Time the Principles of Virtue and Piety &s;hall be carefully in|&s;tilled into their Minds in a Way, that will make the mo&s;t la&s;ting Impre&s;&s;ion; and withal to introduce the <HI>Engli&s;h Lan|guage</HI> among them, in&s;tead of their own imperfect and barba|rous <HI>Dialect.</HI></P>
<P>And to accompli&s;h this <HI>De&s;ign,</HI> I propo&s;e to procure an Ac|commodation of about 200 Acres of <HI>Land</HI> in this Place, (which may be had without any Co&s;t of the <HI>Indian Proprietors</HI>) and to erect an <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> on it, &s;uch as &s;hall be thought convenient for a Beginning; and in it to maintain a Number of <HI>Children and Youth</HI> (not under <HI>ten,</HI> nor above <HI>twenty</HI> Years of Age;) and to have them under the Direction, Care &amp; Tuition of <HI>two Masters,</HI> one to take the Over&s;ight of them in their Hours of <HI>Labour,</HI> and the other in their Hours of <HI>Study,</HI> and to have their Time &s;o <HI>divided between</HI> Study and Labour as to make one the Diver&s;ion of the other, that as little Time as po&s;&s;ible may be lo&s;t in Idlene&s;s. It will, I think, be nece&s;&s;ary, there &s;hould be two Ma&s;ters for this Purpo&s;e, becau&s;e it will be too tedious a Ta&s;k for one I propo&s;e that the Fruit of their Labour &s;hall go to their own <HI>Maintenance,</HI> and to carry on the general De&s;ign; except perhaps &s;ome particular <HI>Premiums</HI> out of the Profits of their Labour, if it can be afforded, to encourage <HI>Indu&s;try</HI> I
<PB N="98" REF="007023_0103_102AEB0B690FC7A0">
propo&s;e al&s;o to have a Stock of <HI>Cattle</HI> &amp;c. maintained on the Place for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e to take into the Number, upon certain Conditions, from among any of the <HI>Tribes</HI> of <HI>Indians</HI> found about; that by <HI>their</HI> Means, under the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, the Principles of Vertue and Chri&s;tian Knowledge may be &s;pread as far as po&s;&s;i|ble; which, perhaps in a Cour&s;e of Years may, by the Grace of God, <HI>open</HI> the Way for the Propagation Chri&s;tianity to the <HI>remote&s;t Tribes.</HI></P>
<P>To lay the Foundation, and to <HI>&s;upport</HI> &s;o great a De&s;ign as this, will, without Doubt, co&s;t a <HI>great Deal</HI> of Money; the Supply of which <HI>depends</HI> altogether upon the Smiles of <HI>divine Providence,</HI> and the <HI>Charity</HI> of good People, who may think proper to favour it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Need</HI> of &s;ome &s;uch De&s;ign as this, is very obvious to all that are in any Mea&s;ure acquainted with the Di&s;po&s;ition and State of the <HI>Indians in America.</HI> It is well known, that Vertue and Piety make but <HI>&s;low Progre&s;s</HI> among them in the Me|thods that have hitherto been u&s;ed to promote the&s;e Ends. Nor can I think of any Thing &s;o <HI>likely,</HI> as what is here pro|po&s;ed, in human Probability, to <HI>root out</HI> their vicious Habits, and to change their whole Way of Living. I hope therefore the apparent Goodne&s;s of this De&s;ign will recommend it to all charitably di&s;po&s;ed Per&s;ons, who would gladly <HI>honour God with their Sub&s;tance</HI>; and that it will approve it&s;elf to, and be pro|moted by, Per&s;ons of <HI>all Parties</HI>; &s;ince it is a De&s;ign <HI>generous</HI> in its Intention, and calculated for the common Good of a <HI>very mi&s;erable and degenerate Part of our Race,</HI> and has no <HI>Party-View</HI> in it at all. I per&s;uade my&s;elf therefore that all tho&s;e who are concerned for the <HI>Glory</HI> of our common MAKER, and <HI>the Father of the Spirits of all fle&s;h,</HI> and for the Honour of our common SAVIOUR, to whom <HI>the Heathen are given for his In|heritance, and the utmo&s;t Ends of the Earth for his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> or that are only in&s;pired with the generous Sentiments of <HI>Com|pa&s;&s;ion to the Mi&s;erable,</HI> will unite in promoting the De&s;ign here propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>If PROVIDENCE encourage and &s;ucceed this De&s;ign, and a Fund &s;ufficient to carry it on, can be procured, I purpo&s;e to enlarge <HI>the Foundation,</HI> &s;o as to take in <HI>Girls,</HI> as well as <HI>Boys,</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="007023_0104_102AEB0DA3CFF030">
to be educated in a Manner &s;uitable to the Condition of their <HI>Sex</HI>; for I think the Cultivation of <HI>both the Sexes</HI> has a natural Tendency to improve each other more ea&s;ily and &s;ucce&s;sfully.</P>
<P>I de&s;ign the <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> to be u&s;ed with them &s;hall be as &s;trict as tho&s;e will bear, who know <HI>nothing like Government</HI> among them&s;elves, and have an <HI>Aver&s;ion</HI> to every Thing that <HI>re&s;trains</HI> their Liberty.</P>
<P>I know it is apt to be <HI>&s;u&s;pected</HI> in &s;uch De&s;igns, pretended to be for the publick Good, that there is &s;ome <HI>Self-Intere&s;t at Bottom,</HI> which is the Spring of the Motion. If the World <HI>&s;u&s;pect</HI> any Thing of this Sort in the <HI>pre&s;ent Projection,</HI> as &s;ome no Doubt will; and the rather, perhaps, becau&s;e it has been <HI>amu&s;ed</HI> with Projections of this Kind, which have appeared to many meer <HI>per&s;onal and &s;elfi&s;h,</HI> or, at be&s;t only <HI>Party</HI> De&s;igns, I know not how to give any further <HI>Satisfaction</HI> for the pre&s;ent, than to <HI>declare &s;olemnly</HI> that I have <HI>no other Aim,</HI> than the <HI>Good of the Indians,</HI> and that I have no Expectation of any <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Benefit at all, more than the <HI>meer Satisfaction</HI> of being <HI>in&s;tru|mental,</HI> under GOD, of doing them &s;o great a <HI>Kindne&s;s,</HI> and rendering them a more <HI>happy Society</HI> by cultivating <HI>Humanity</HI> and Vertue among them.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Indians,</HI> in general, are a People <HI>difficult</HI> to be re|formed from their own <HI>fooli&s;h,</HI> barbarous, and wicked Cu&s;toms, the <HI>Un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s</HI> of Attempts upon them for this Purpo&s;e is a melancholly <HI>Proof,</HI> which though it may appear <HI>di&s;couraging in further</HI> Endeavours; yet, I think, to a generous Mind it &s;hould rather be improved as <HI>an Argument to form and execute new Projections</HI> for this Purpo&s;e. And indeed, perhaps, the <HI>Neglect of promoting Indu&s;try</HI> among them is the chief <HI>moral Rea&s;on</HI> of &s;o <HI>little</HI> being done to Purpo&s;e in forming their Man|ners. And therefore, I hope the Want of <HI>wi&s;h'd for Succe&s;s</HI> in other Attempts will be <HI>no Objection</HI> with any that de&s;ire to be <HI>Benefactors to Mankind</HI> again&s;t contributing their <HI>Part to this,</HI> which I think, has &s;o apparent a Tendency to promote <HI>Indu&s;try and Humanity</HI> among a barbarous People. But tho' I think the De&s;ign here propo&s;ed has the probable Appearance of proving <HI>&s;ucce&s;sful,</HI> yet I do not <HI>flatter</HI> my &s;elf with any Ro|mantick <HI>Expectations</HI> of accompli&s;hing <HI>all</HI> the Ends propo&s;ed at once; nor is it to be <HI>expected,</HI> in the ordinary Cour&s;e of
<PB N="100" REF="007023_0105_102AEB0FED871720">
Things but that a great Deal of <HI>Ce&s;t and Pains</HI> with Re&s;pect to many particular Per&s;ons will be <HI>lo&s;t.</HI> This is what happens of Cour&s;e in all De&s;igns of this Nature: And yet, it is to be hoped, <HI>&s;ome Good</HI> will be done: Nor will the Benefactors loo&s;e their Reward with God, though the De&s;ign &s;hould not be crowned with all the happy <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> might be wi&s;hed and hoped for. The meer <HI>Su&s;picion,</HI> that the De&s;ign in the <HI>Event</HI> will prove <HI>un&s;ucce&s;sful,</HI> ought <HI>not,</HI> I think, to <HI>di&s;courage</HI> the Attempt. How many are there, that <HI>fru&s;trate the very Grace of God it&s;elf</HI>? How many with Re&s;pect to whom <HI>Chri&s;t has died in vain</HI>? And yet (to &s;peak after the Manner of Men) <HI>this</HI> was no Hin|drance to his laying down <HI>his Life</HI> for Sinners. He indeed has obtain'd all the Recompence in the Salvation of Souls, which he had in his Eye, and <HI>GOD all the Glory of his bene|volent Purpo&s;es. He &s;ees the Fruit of the Travail of his Soul, and is &s;atisfied.</HI> Nor will any <HI>Benefactors</HI> here <HI>loo&s;e the Prai&s;e and Reward</HI> of their gracious Intention and Endeavours. (See <HI>I&s;a.</HI> xlix. 1-6.)</P>
<P>It may perhaps with &s;ome be an <HI>Objection</HI> again&s;t attempting any Thing of this Sort, that the <HI>Indians are a ba&s;e, ungrateful People,</HI> in&s;en&s;ible of Kindne&s;&s;es done them. To this I <HI>reply,</HI> that though it be true, that this is the ba&s;e, ungrateful Tem|per of <HI>Indians</HI> yet I think it is rather an <HI>Argument in Favour</HI> of a Projection calculated to promote <HI>Humanity</HI> among them, than otherwi&s;e: For the Objection &s;uppo&s;es them to be greatly <HI>deba&s;ed,</HI> and &s;hews the Need there is of <HI>cultivating a Soil &s;o barren,</HI> or rather a Soil &s;o <HI>over-run</HI> with hateful <HI>Weeds,</HI> and pricking Thorns. But whatever Weight <HI>this</HI> Objection might have with <HI>others,</HI> certainly it ought to have none <HI>with a Chri&s;|tian,</HI> who is commanded to <HI>imitate the Beneficence of his</HI> HEA|VENLY FATHER, who <HI>does Good to the Evil and Unthankful.</HI> Had this Con&s;ideration &s;way'd the Mind of our ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR, would he ever have &s;hed his <HI>Blood</HI> for tho&s;e, who pur&s;ued his Life to Death? Nor did GOD refu&s;e to <HI>di&s;tingui&s;h the I&s;raelites</HI> with his <HI>peculiar</HI> Favours from all the Families of the Earth, becau&s;e they were an ungrateful <HI>&s;tiff-necked</HI> and rebelli|ous Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I would <HI>not</HI> have it thought from <HI>what</HI> I have written above, that all that has been done here, to introduce Chri&s;tianity and
<PB N="101" REF="007023_0106_102AEB1178C8C228">
good Manners, has proved altogether <HI>in vain</HI>; for, through the Grace of GOD, &s;ome <HI>good Effects</HI> have attended <HI>our Labours</HI> here: And, the <HI>Indians &s;eem now well prepared</HI> for the Execu|tion of what I have here propo&s;ed; which their <HI>Jealou&s;y</HI> would have been an effectual <HI>Hindrance</HI> to a few Years ago.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be glad of the <HI>Thoughts</HI> of candid and ingenious <HI>Gen|tlemen</HI> communicated to me for the Improvement of the <HI>De&s;ign</HI> here propo&s;ed: And &s;hall be ready to an&s;wer any <HI>Queries</HI> that may be made in Relation to it.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, you have what I de&s;ire may be communicated to the <HI>publick</HI> from me. It will be well perhaps that you &s;hould preface this with &s;ome general <HI>Account</HI> of what Mr. <HI>Hollis has done,</HI> and what he <HI>expected from this Country</HI> in Pro&s;ecution of his De&s;ign; which was what &s;ugge&s;ted to me the De&s;ign pro|po&s;ed above.

<P>It having pleas'd my Rev. <HI>Brother</HI> thus <HI>openly</HI> to addre&s;s and oblige me, I do mo&s;t willingly publi&s;h his <HI>Letter</HI>: And if <HI>my Name and Hand</HI> can &s;erve in any Mea&s;ure to promote the <HI>happy Foundation</HI> which his Heart is &s;et on, (I humbly hope under &s;ome &s;pecial <HI>Influence</HI> from above) I give <HI>them</HI> with all my <HI>Heart</HI>; with Thank&s;giving to GOD who many Years ago was pleas'd to incline my Honour'd <HI>Friend</HI> and Rev. <HI>Brother</HI> Mr. <HI>I&s;aac Hollis</HI> (then of <HI>London</HI>) into tho&s;e <HI>Bounties</HI> to us, which are now i&s;&s;uing in <HI>this Propo&s;al</HI> of a <HI>Boarding-School</HI> for the <HI>more effectual In&s;truction and Education</HI> of the <HI>Indian Children</HI> in the <HI>Western Borders</HI> of our <HI>Province.</HI></P>
<P>It was about the Year 1731, 2. that Mr. <HI>I&s;aac Hollis,</HI> (Nephew to <HI>Thomas Hollis,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>; the great Benefactor to <HI>Harvard College,</HI> and &s;oon after his pious <HI>Uncle</HI>'s Decea&s;e) &s;ent me a <HI>Hundred Pounds</HI> Sterling, with his particular <HI>Directions</HI> how to di&s;tribute and lay it out; adding, that he had &s;een many of my <HI>Letters</HI> to his <HI>Uncle</HI> and his to <HI>me,</HI> which now <HI>led him</HI> into his <HI>Writing</HI> to me, and this his Gift to us.</P>
<P>In the Year 1734, when he had &s;een the printed Account of the <HI>Ordination</HI> of Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>Parker, Hin&s;del</HI> and <HI>Secombe,</HI> and their <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion</HI> to the <HI>Indian Tribes</HI> on the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> and <HI>Western</HI> Borders of <HI>New England</HI>; Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI> then earne&s;tly made me a mo&s;t generous <HI>Offer</HI> of <HI>twenty Pounds</HI> Sterling <HI>per Annum, for Ever,</HI> for the Support of a <HI>fourth Mi&s;&s;ionary</HI>; but in Faithfulne&s;s I advis'd again&s;t &s;uch a Di&s;po&s;ition of his Money; &amp; as earne&s;tly propo&s;ed to him the Application of it for the Support of a <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionary</HI> thro' the wide Spread of the <HI>de&s;titute Settlements</HI> I had heard of in the Province of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI>; but he did not approve of my Advice.</P>
<P>Within two Years after this, I heard of a very promi&s;ing <HI>Door</HI> opening for the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> among the <HI>Indian Tribe at Hou&s;a|tunnuk,</HI> and that a Per&s;on of Mr. SERGEANT's <HI>Character</HI> for Pie|ty and Learning, (then one of the <HI>Tutors</HI> in <HI>Yale College</HI> in <HI>Con|necticut</HI>) was willing to quit his <HI>Fellow&s;hip</HI> and the <HI>Pro&s;pect</HI> he reasonably might have of one of the <HI>be&s;t</HI> Settlements our <HI>Country</HI> could afford him, in any of our vacant <HI>Churches</HI>; and to de|vote
<PB N="103" REF="007023_0108_102AEB15B8CD0BD0">
vote him&s;elf to the Glory of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in the Service of the Souls of tho&s;e poor <HI>Heathen Families</HI>; Whereupon I immediately let Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI> know, that now I could freely and earne&s;tly advi&s;e him to fix his <HI>twenty Pounds Sterling</HI> per An. for the Support of this <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion:</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to this Motion, <HI>Novemb.</HI> 19. 1736. I receiv'd from Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI> his Bill on Col. <HI>Wendell</HI> to pay 56 l. Sterl. for the Education of <HI>twelve Indian Boys</HI> at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> under the Care of the Rev. Mr. SERGEANT; and <HI>Aug.</HI> 15. 1738. I had a <HI>&s;econd Order</HI> from him tor 343 l. our Money; and again <HI>May</HI> 17. 1740. a <HI>third</HI> Order for 447 l. 9 s.: (Errors execped.)</P>
<P>Upon this gracious <HI>Call,</HI> and bountiful <HI>Direction</HI> of <HI>Divine Providence,</HI> Mr. SERGEANT has been laying out him&s;elf gladly from Year to Year, in the Strength of GOD, in the Tru&s;t com|muted to him, with Caution, Care and Diligence, according to the Mea&s;ure of <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> given him from <HI>on High</HI>; whence every <HI>good and perfect Gift</HI> comes down, both the <HI>Heart</HI> and <HI>Oppor|tunity</HI> for the doing Good.</P>
<P>On the <HI>Sixth</HI> of <HI>May</HI> 1743. Mr. SERGEANT cover'd to me a <HI>Letter</HI> to be forwarded to the Rev. Mr. <HI>Hollis,</HI> giving him a particular <HI>Account,</HI> of the laying <Q>out his <HI>Moneys</HI> for the <HI>Maintenance of his Boys</HI>; and of the <HI>Methods he bad u&s;ed</HI> for the <HI>cultivating Humanity,</HI> and introducing the <HI>Engli&s;h Tongue and Manners among them,</HI> and for their <HI>Proficiency</HI> in Knowledge, Vertue and <HI>Piety</HI>; by which Means, through the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, &s;everal of them are affected with a <HI>Sen&s;e and Reli&s;h of Divine Things</HI>; and <HI>One</HI> of them in particular has made <HI>extraor|dinary Progre&s;s</HI> in his <HI>Learnings,</HI> and appears truly <HI>pious,</HI> and has been &s;ingularly <HI>&s;erviceable</HI> to him, <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;ting</HI> him in his <HI>Tran|&s;lations</HI> Expo&s;tions aod Applications of the Scripture; and al&s;o very <HI>helpful</HI> among the <HI>young Indians</HI> in a <HI>general religious Concern</HI> that has <HI>of late prevailed</HI> among them.</Q> Mr. SERGEANT adds, <Q>that <HI>this young Indian</HI> is already well <HI>qualified to keep School</HI> among his <HI>Countrymen</HI>; and within a few Years will probably be fit to be a <HI>Preacher of the Go&s;pel</HI> to them.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Two or three other</HI> of his Boys, Mr. SERGEANT &s;ays, are &s;erviceable in <HI>improving the Re&s;t</HI> of the <HI>Indians</HI> in Knowledge and Virtue; and he adds,&mdash; <Q>that it had been a <HI>continued Series of unwearied Kindne&s;s to the Indians, that had at length
<PB N="104" REF="007023_0109_102AEB181597B1D8">
intirely overcome their Jealou&s;ies and Su&s;picions</HI>; and gain'd an almo&s;t <HI>univer&s;al Di&s;po&s;ition</HI> in them to receive In&s;truction.</Q></P>
<P>He then inform'd Mr. <HI>Hollis,</HI> <Q>that he has had in his Mind, for &s;ome Years, to &s;et up a <HI>free Boarding-School</HI> for the Educa|tion of <HI>Indian</HI> Children, in which he propo&s;es that they be brought up to <HI>Labour</HI> as well as <HI>Learning</HI> and the Exerci&s;es of <HI>Devotion</HI>; with which Propo&s;al the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;eem to be mightily taken; being &s;en&s;ible of their <HI>Folly</HI> in their being formerly &s;o <HI>backward</HI> to improve the Advantages put into their Hand.</Q></P>
<P>Upon all, Mr. SERGEANT adds his <Q><HI>Prayer,</HI> that Almighty <HI>Power</HI> may effect the merciful Purpo&s;e of Sovereign <HI>Grace</HI> among them!&mdash;</Q> and then concludes with a free and noble <HI>Declaration</HI> to Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI> in the following Words,</P>

<P>I was &s;o charm'd with the <HI>Spirit</HI> and Contents of <HI>this Letter,</HI> that I took a <HI>Copy</HI> of it before I <HI>&s;eal'd</HI> it up, and <HI>forwarded</HI> it to Mr. <HI>Hollis:</HI> And not only &s;o, but <HI>old</HI> as I am, and unapt now to <HI>tran&s;cribe,</HI> yet I wrote &s;everal Copies, and &s;ent <HI>one</HI> to an Honourable <HI>Member</HI> of the <HI>Corporation at London,</HI> who have the Di&s;tribution of the <HI>Indian Fund</HI>; another to the worthy <HI>Secretary</HI> of their Honourable <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> here at <HI>Boston</HI>; and yet a <HI>third</HI> to a Rev. <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> if he &s;ees good to communicate it to the <HI>Secretary</HI> of the Honourable <HI>Society</HI> for propagating Chri&s;tian Knowledge at <HI>Edinburgh</HI>; and after all I publi&s;h'd it in the <HI>Weekly Chri&s;tian Hi&s;tory</HI> at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> No. 19. So that I have in a Manner <HI>prevented,</HI> and abundantly an&s;wered, Mr. SERGEANT's <HI>Reque&s;t</HI> to me in <HI>his pre&s;ent Letter</HI> before it

came; and gone beyond all he could <HI>imagine</HI> or expect from me, in Way of <HI>prefacing</HI> and <HI>recommending his picus De&s;ign and Propo&s;al.</HI> And I can truly add, that I &s;hall account my &s;elf honour'd by GOD in my <HI>advanced Age,</HI> If I may <HI>fini&s;h my Cour&s;e</HI> of Services to my <HI>Country,</HI> and the <HI>Churches</HI> of CHRIST here, by mini&s;tring now under my <HI>dear younger Brother,</HI> in this his &s;ervent <HI>devoting his Life and Powers</HI> to the <HI>Glory</HI> of GOD in the <HI>Salvation of the Heathen.</HI></P>
<P>I even <HI>dare</HI> therefore to recommend <HI>Him,</HI> and his propo&s;ed <HI>Boarding-School,</HI> not only to the pious and <HI>Charitable</HI> among our&s;elves, nor only to tho&s;e of the Denomination of <HI>New-England</HI> in our <HI>Nation</HI> and <HI>Provinces</HI>; but al&s;o (might it not be thought <HI>pre&s;umptuous</HI>) even to the mo&s;t Honourable <HI>Societies for propagating the Go&s;pel</HI> and of <HI>Chri&s;tian Knowledge</HI> in <HI>London</HI> &amp; <HI>Edin|burgh,</HI> for their generous <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;tances</HI> to a <HI>Projection truly Catholic,</HI> and without <HI>re&s;pect of Parties</HI>; which I hope the <HI>Divine Pro|vidence</HI> may be laying by the Hands of <HI>his Servants,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI> and Mr. SERGEANT, in this ob&s;cure <HI>Corner</HI> of our <HI>Province</HI> at <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> alias <HI>Hou&s;tunnuk,</HI> for <HI>a more effectual Entrance</HI> among the <HI>Indians</HI> than we have yet &s;een.</P>
<P>But there are <HI>two</HI> or <HI>three</HI> Things more, that I find my &s;elf <HI>obliged</HI> to hint at, before I conclude the pre&s;ent Writing.</P>
<P><HI>One</HI> is (as Mr. SERGEANT reque&s;ts of me in his Letter) to intimate to the <HI>Publick</HI> Mr. <HI>Hollis his Expectations from Us here in New-England.</HI> And indeed, in &s;everal of his <HI>Letters</HI> to me, he has wrote with &s;ome <HI>Di&s;couragement of Spirit</HI> on this Head; <Q>Why <HI>We,</HI> a People of &s;uch <HI>Name</HI> for Religion, do not <HI>exert</HI> our &s;elves more in Pro&s;ecution of like E&s;&s;ays for a more effectual go&s;pelizing the <HI>Heathen</HI> round about us?

<P>The foregoing Letter of Mr. SERGEANT containing his Pro|po&s;al, &amp;c. and Dr. <HI>Colman</HI>'s Return, &amp;c. were made Publick by the <HI>Doctory,</HI> according to Mr. SERGEANT's De&s;ire; with a De&s;ign to excite the pious generous and well di&s;po&s;ed in this <HI>Country,</HI> and in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> to charitable Contributions for the &s;etting up &amp; &s;upporting the propo&s;ed <HI>Boarding-School.</HI> And Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> di&s;tributed many of them, where he tho't they would be mo&s;t likely to an&s;wer the End propo&s;ed. And in a Letter to Mr. SERGEATN of <HI>September</HI> 17th he gives him the following Account.&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>&mdash;I cover to you your Letter in Print. I wi&s;h my Re|turn to it may be acceptable to you &amp; others; and I humbly be&s;eech God to incline many Hearts, Here and Abroad, to contribute to your mo&s;t pious and generous Propo&s;al. I have cover'd four of them to His Excellency our <HI>Governor,</HI> and &s;ug|ge&s;ted to him my Hopes that the <HI>General Court</HI> will &s;mile upon it, at their next Se&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>And in another Letter of the 22d of the &s;ame Month.</P>
<P><Q>&mdash;It was a great Plea&s;ure to me Ye&s;terday to &s;ee Mr. <HI>Jo&s;iah Jones.</HI> I have deliver'd to him <HI>twenty Pounds</HI> old Tenor, to deliver to you for your further A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Support in your Work. I have de&s;ir'd him to call at our Deacon <HI>Philips's</HI> for two Dozen Copies of your Letter to me, and my Return to it; pre&s;ented by Major <HI>Henchman,</HI> who &s;ends them to you for the Copy.&mdash;I have di&s;tributed already of them 70, and &s;hall receive 50 more to Day to di&s;tribute. I have already cover'd to Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> Dr. <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> Madam <HI>Holden,</HI> Mr. <HI>Newman,</HI> Mr. <HI>O&s;wald</HI> and <HI>Brackstone,</HI> Book&s;ellers, Dr. <HI>Avery</HI> Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI>; and to Mr. <HI>Willi&s;on</HI> of <HI>Dundee,</HI> and am going to put up for Mr. <HI>Palmer,</HI> Mr. <HI>Coram,</HI> Dr. <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> and others on the other

<P>By the Pains Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> took in recommending and di&s;tribut|ing Mr. SERGEANT's Propo&s;al, it is evident he was much en|gag'd in Favour of it; as Mr. SERGEANT al&s;o was; and, I think, not without Rea&s;on: for I look upon it as the be&s;t concerted Scheme that has ever been propos'd for the Benefit of the <HI>Indians.</HI> Nor do I &s;uppo&s;e it likely, that they will ever be bro't to be a knowing and thrifty People, unle&s;s, by &s;ome &s;uch Method of Indu&s;try, they are cur'd of their Idlene&s;s, and other Vices which proceed from it.</P>
<P>When Mr. SERGEANT under&s;tood, by Dr. <HI>Colman</HI>'s Letter, what Care and Pains he had been at to forward this noble De&s;ign, his generous Soul was too tenderly touch'd to be &s;ilent. In a Letter of <HI>October</HI> 24, he thus expre&s;&s;es his Gratitude to the <HI>Doctor.</HI></P>

Ye&s;terday I al&s;o gave the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;ome Account of the De&s;ign; with what was doing for them, chiefly by your Means.

<P>The Letter, which Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> wrote to Mr. SERGEANT, giving hinm Occa&s;ion to &s;ay, <HI>Madam</HI> Holden is <HI>exceeding kind, and &s;ets a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">le Example,</HI> is mi&s;&s;ing.

<P><Q>I purpo&s;e to a&s;k Mrs. <HI>Holden</HI>'s Leave to apply <HI>one Hundred,</HI> our Currency, of her Money, toward your <HI>Boarding-School.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And in another Letter of <HI>May</HI> 24th 1744, he &s;peaks of Ma|dam <HI>Holden</HI>'s Sub&s;cription of <HI>one Hundred Pounds.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e

therefore in the Letrer that is mi&s;&s;ing the <HI>Doctor</HI> inform'd him of her Donation, which occa&s;ion'd him to expre&s;s him&s;elf as above.</P>
<P>For want of that Letter, I am not able to &s;ay what Manner <HI>of Sub&s;cription the Doctor</HI> put forward, and which Mr. SERGEANT &s;o <HI>highly approv'd of,</HI> but only from this Expre&s;&s;ion of his; <HI>for &s;omething annually, and yet not &s;o confin'd hit that who will, may, give what they plea&s;e at once.</HI> And what Progre&s;s it made I know not, but &s;uppo&s;e it was not great. All the Light I have in the Ca&s;e is from a Letter of Dr. <HI>Colman</HI>'s to Mr. SERGEANT, dated <HI>May</HI> 24th 1744, in which he &s;ays.</P>
<P><Q>I have as yet no Sub&s;cription but Madam <HI>Holden's one Hun|dred Pounds.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Then he goes on to name four Gentlemen, who &s;ub&s;crib'd in this <HI>Country,</HI> and concludes by &s;aying,</P>
<P><Q>&mdash;I wi&s;h it may be &s;low and &s;ure; believing and not making Ha&s;te. God governs, and I tru&s;t will provide.</Q> The four Sub&s;criptions above mentioned Mr. SERGEANT never received. I find them not in his Account, and therefore conclude, that the War now coming on, and di&s;couraging any further Sub&s;cripti|ons, tho&s;e were not paid.</P>
<P>It mud be granted, that the People in <HI>Stockbridge</HI> di&s;cover'd a very noble and generous Spirit, in contributing &s;o largely to that pious De&s;ign. Had the People thro' the <HI>Country</HI> given one tenth Part &s;o much, in Proportion to their Numbers &amp; Abilities, that <HI>School,</HI> and another for <HI>Females,</HI> might have been &s;et up, and well &s;uoported: And had we in general, in this Land, &s;uch ju&s;t and affecting Views of the deplorable State of the <HI>Indians,</HI> as the People at <HI>Stockbridge</HI> have, who&s;e Eyes affect their Hearts, I doubt not but many Thou&s;ands would have cheerfully given to forward that noble and pious De&s;ign, the be&s;t I think that has ever been projected.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> &s;ent one of Mr. SERGEANT's printed Letters, and his own Recommendation of it, to a Gentleman in a neighbouring Town, who&s;e generous Mind was pleas'd with the Projection; he therefore wrote back, propo&s;ing a Method of Sub&s;cription to en|courage it, which the <HI>Doctor</HI> approv'd of, and therefore publi&s;h'd the Gentleman's Letter in the Weekly Journal of <HI>February</HI> 7th 1744.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend and dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>You did me the Favour &s;ome Weeks &s;ince, to &s;end me the Rev. Mr. SERGEANT's <HI>Scheme,</HI> with your Letter annexed to it, for promoting Chri&s;tian Knowledge among thr <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Hon|&s;atunnuck,</HI> by civilizing and bringing them to a good Opinion of Indu&s;try, Frugality, &amp;c. which I very much approve of; and the more, becau&s;e it appears to me, as if he had truly no private or per&s;onal Intere&s;t in View; but only the Honour of his great Ma&s;ter, and the be&s;t Welfare of the poor <HI>Heathen,</HI> whom the Father gave him for his Inheritance. And there|fore I heartily wi&s;h it Succe&s;s, and hope the Difficulties in rai&s;ing Money, to carry on &s;uch an Affair, may be &s;urmounted.</P>
<P>I have been expecting every Day, &s;ince you &s;ent it to me, to hear of a Sub&s;cription's going forward on that Account, but hear nothing of any &s;uch Thing at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I would therefore humbly propo&s;e, that a Sheet of Paper or two may be &s;titch'd up at the End of one or more of tho&s;e printed Letters; and a generous Sub&s;cription begun, by a few well-di&s;pos'd Gentlemen of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and handed about from one to another to try what may be done that Way: And there every Sub&s;criber may &s;ee at one View the hone&s;t De&s;ign, judge of it's Nece&s;&s;ity, and act accordingly.</P>
<P>I cannot help thinking the generous Bene&s;actions of the Rev. Mr. <HI>HoIlis,</HI> and his ju&s;t Objection of the Inactivity of a People of &s;uch a Name for Religion, as we in <HI>New-England,</HI> in &s;uch an Affair, will put many to the Blu&s;h, and perhaps &s;pur them on to bountiful Liberality in this Scheme. I am no Ways qualify'd for a Leader my &s;elf, but would willingly follow a few Gentlemen who would be more likely to give it a Repu|tation and Currency, with my Sub&s;cription of &mdash;<HI>pounds</HI> and would u&s;e my &s;mall Influence to promote it; but it mu&s;t be &s;ome how or other &s;et a going, whkrh, when once well done, may be ea&s;ily kept alive, and in Motion. I have a great deal of Faith that &s;omething of this Nature may be attended with Succe&s;s, if put into &s;uch Hands as &s;hall be &s;pirited for it, and will not <HI>be weary in well doing</HI>; but &s;tir up them&s;elves &amp; others with a well temper'd Zeal, mixt with Prudence, &s;o as not to give Offence to any who do not think exactly as they do; and by &s;uch a Behaviour, &s;ome who may not be well inclin'd at one
<PB N="112" REF="007023_0117_102AEB27BB6035E8">
Time, may be very well di&s;pos'd at another, to a hand&s;ome Sub&s;cription.</P>
<P>But, this Method notwith&s;tanding, I hope it will not be tho't ami&s;s to have a Brief from Authority (if Need be) procur'd and promoted in every Church, in this Province, to collect what well-di&s;pos'd People would be willing to give to encourage an Affair of &s;uch Importance; and if, before the Collection, the&s;e two Letters &s;hould be read, I am humbly of Opinion it would not be impertinent.</P>
<P><HI>If we really believe the admirable Charms you mention at the Clo&s;e of your Letter, have any Reality in them, as I am apt to think they have, viz.</HI> That a right literal Heart &amp; Hand, no Tongue can fully &s;peak it! nor enough celebrate it! Un&s;peakable is the Good done to the World by it! Un&s;peakable is that Glory redounding to the Name of Chri&s;t from it! and al&s;o the Good to our&s;elves in it and from it is Un&s;peakable, <HI>both thro' the Life which now is &amp; that which is to come!</HI> Only the <HI>Day of Chri&s;t</HI> can reveal the Glories and Joys awaiting it thro' a ble&s;&s;ed Eternity:</P>
<P>I &s;ay, if the&s;e wonderful Truths are duly tho't of, this pious Scheme of Mr. SERGEANT will not, cannot, fall to the Ground for want of Money to carry it on, and &s;upport it from Time to Time. I pray God to &s;trengthen our Faith in them.&mdash; I entreat an Intere&s;t in your Prayers, and do a&s;&s;ure you that I am with great E&s;teem and Re&s;pect,</P>

<P>It will perhaps be Matter of Surprize to the Reader, that when &s;uch an Opportunity pre&s;ented, and Sub&s;criptions were urg'd by &s;uch forcible Rea&s;ons by Dr. <HI>Colman,</HI> and the Author of the fore|going Letter; that no Sub&s;criptions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> obtain'd in the Country, &s;ave tho&s;e four abovementioned: For I find no Account of any more in the Papers before me.

<P>I am &s;en&s;ible &s;ome worthy Gentlemen, who were po&s;&s;e&s;t of a laudable Concern for the Good of the <HI>Indians</HI> apprehended, that there was too great a Coldne&s;s and Indifference in this Ca&s;e, con|&s;idering the Importance of the Affair, and the happy Pro&s;pect there was of its &s;ucceeding, if it had been duly encourag'd; and that they were a little impatient on the Account of tho&s;e Excu&s;es which were made by &s;ome, from whom Sub&s;criptions were ex|pected, <HI>viz.</HI> That we mu&s;t not be too ha&s;ty, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>A Gentleman al&s;o in a Letter to Mr. SERGEANT of <HI>July</HI> 9th &s;ays,</P>
<P><Q>I could have been very glad, that my poor Endeavours with Re&s;pect to your <HI>Scheme</HI> to propagate Chri&s;tianity among the <HI>Indians,</HI> had been attended with any Succe&s;s; but I cannot

learn that any Thing is done, or doing, about it; and it &s;eems to me to be as dead at pre&s;ent as if it had never been in Motion. I have met with &s;everal Checks for being too ha&s;ty in the Affair.&mdash;Our Backwardne&s;s to generous Actions for the Good of our fellow Creatures, notwith&s;tanding the excellent Rules of Charity pre&s;crib'd in Chri&s;tianity, and enforc'd by &s;o many powerful Rea&s;ons, is a mo&s;t convincing Argument, that the Spirit of pure and undefil'd Religion but little prevails, where the Form of it appears.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>I am ready to think that any one, who is well acquainted with this Affair, and is impartial in the Ca&s;e, will judge, that a gene|rous Sub&s;cription to promote &s;uch a noble De&s;ign, would have well became a People of our Profe&s;&s;ion: The Rev. and generous Mr. <HI>Hollis,</HI> when he was made acquainted with Mr. SERGEANT's Scheme, di&s;cover'd a very different Spirit from what appear'd among us. Before Mr. SERGEANT's Letter, and Dr. <HI>Colman</HI>'s Recommendation of it, were made publick in this Country, in <HI>April</HI> 7. 1743. Mr. SERGEANT in a Letter to Mr. <HI>Hollis,</HI> inform'd him of his De&s;ign of &s;eting up a <HI>Boarding-School.</HI> Mr. <HI>Hollis,</HI> in his An&s;wer of <HI>December</HI> 5th 1743, in a mo&s;t effectual Manner, &s;hews his Approbation of it, in the following Worlds.</P>
<Q><P>I am pleas'd with your Propo&s;al about &s;etting up a <HI>Boarding-School</HI> for <HI>Indian</HI> Children. I like it well. May it plea&s;e the Lord to incline the Hearts of many to contribute towards it. I de&s;ire you would take up for me 12 Boys afre&s;h, about the Age of 9, 10, 11, or 12 Years, and let them be totally main|tain'd at my Expence, with Food and Raiment, Education and the like. There may be &s;till a con&s;iderable Sum of Money in the Hands of Col. <HI>Wendell</HI>; plea&s;e to apply to him on my Ac|count for what you want, and I will furni&s;h more as there may be Occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>&mdash;<HI>N. B.</HI> I would have none but <HI>Boys</HI> educated for me; but it may be well if a Number of <HI>Girls</HI> could be educated on the Account of &s;ome others.&mdash;</P></Q>
<P>Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> in a Letter inform'd a certain Gentleman in his Neighbourhood of Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI>'s Genero&s;ity, who in his An&s;wer to the <HI>Dostor,</HI> expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus.</P>
<P><Q>This extraordinary additional Bounty of that Reverend Gen|tleman, I hope will quicken the Gentlemen here concern'd in
<PB N="115" REF="007023_0120_102AEB2E13AD0C60">
putting forward Sub&s;criptions. Is it not amazing to find one &s;ingle Gentleman (and that a Stranger too) &s;o ready and free to be at the Expence of &s;upporting 24 Boys, without any Jea|lou&s;y of his Charity's being mi&s;apply'd, and this <HI>whole Land</HI> &s;o backward to &s;upport an equal Number of <HI>Girls,</HI> when it is &s;o va&s;tly more our Duty than any Bodies el&s;e? May not a little Impatience here be a Virtue?</Q></P>
<P>To Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI>'s Letter, of <HI>December</HI> 5. 1743, Mr. SERGEANT wrote an An&s;wer <HI>July</HI> 2. In which, after his grateful Acknow|ment of Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI>'s Genero&s;ity, and his hearty Wi&s;hes that a full Reward might be given him, by that God who is <HI>well pleas'd with &s;uch Sacrifices,</HI> he informs him, that the projected Method of a <HI>Boarding-School</HI> was the be&s;t he could devi&s;e for the Good of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and then adds,&mdash;<Q>The <HI>War</HI> with <HI>France</HI> falls out unhappily for this De&s;ign. We are &s;ituated upon the Borders of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Province,</HI> open to the <HI>French</HI> Settlements, and in the Road where the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> us'd to make their Irruptions; but have been hitherto, thro' the Goodne&s;s of God, pre&s;erv'd.&mdash;However, for the pre&s;ent, I believe, it will not be tho't prudent to be at any Expence in the Affair of the <HI>Boarding-School.</HI> My Hou&s;e is garri&s;on'd; a Number of Sol|diers are &s;ent into the Town;&mdash;and Provi&s;ions are &s;carce: &s;o that I know not what can be done for your <HI>Boys</HI> ju&s;t now. We are, for the pre&s;ent, in &s;uch Confu&s;ion &amp; Uncertainty, by Rea|&s;on of the War, that it is difficult to &s;ay what is be&s;t to be done; a little longer Time will probably direct us what Steps are be&s;t to be taken. As &s;oon as may be, I &s;hall gladly pro&s;e|cute your pious De&s;ign.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>In a Letter al&s;o to Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> of <HI>June</HI> 29th, he &s;ays,</P>
<P><Q>As for our De&s;ign here, I believe, it will not be tho't prudent to put any Thing in Execution for the pre&s;ent, till we &s;ee a little how the Affair of the <HI>War</HI> will turn.</Q></P>
<P>Thus ceas'd this important Affair of the <HI>Boarding-School</HI> for the pre&s;ent, and nothing more was here done about it till the Year 1747. But, in the mean Time, &s;ome Things were acted in Fa|vour of it in <HI>England,</HI> by &s;ome generous and publick &s;pirited Per|&s;ons, to whom Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> had &s;ent Mr. SERGEANT's printed Letter, and his own Return or Recommendation of it; of which I &s;hall give &s;ome Account in its proper Place: Only ob&s;erving
<PB N="116" REF="007023_0121_102AEB2F9CE82D50">
here that it was a Grief to Mr. SERGEANT, that he could not now proceed in it; but he hop'd for a more favourable Oppor|tunity.&mdash; In a Letter to Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> of <HI>November</HI> 7th he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus,</P>
<P><Q>It will be a great Grief to me, if we &s;hould not be able to accompli&s;h the De&s;ign I have projected.&mdash; To God's Power and Grace I refer it.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>This Projection of a <HI>Boarding-School,</HI> and the Pains Mr. SER|GEANT was at to promote it, took up a con&s;iderable Part of his Time and Thoughts; for it lay very near his Heart: But, at the &s;ame Time, he pro&s;ecuted his Work among the <HI>Indians</HI> with In|du&s;try and Faithfulne&s;s; and a very hard Service he had of it. For, having a mix'd Auditory, he was obliged, on each Part of every Lord's Day, both to pray and preach in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Language, that all might profit by his Mini&s;try. He him&s;elf e&s;teem'd his Work to be double on this Account, and us'd it as one Argument, with the honourable <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners,</HI> to move them to make &s;ome Addition to his Salary, which was very &s;mall. His Words are;&mdash; <Q>My Labour, by being oblig'd to preach in <HI>Indian,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e, is double to what it would be, if my Hearers under&s;tood <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></Q>&mdash; And I apprehend it was more than double; for he wrote every Word he delivered to the <HI>Indians</HI> (as he further takes Notice in that Letter;) and that he might be very exact, he did, for a con&s;iderable Time, keep an Interpreter by him two Days in a Week, at his own Co&s;t, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the Tran&s;lation of his Sermons into the <HI>Indian</HI> Tongue. And be&s;ides, the <HI>Indians,</HI> being very ignorant, and not able to gain Knowledge by Reading, as tho&s;e who can read may do, he was oblig'd to &s;pend much of his Time in conver&s;ing privately with them, that thereby he might infu&s;e Knowledge into their Minds; which having been &s;o long, as an uncultivated Soil, wanted more abundant Labour. He was indeed a rare In&s;tance of Diligence, Indu&s;try, and Painfulne&s;s, in his Work; and the Pains he took for the Good of the poor <HI>Natives</HI> are not to be expre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>In the Clo&s;e of this Year, Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> again refre&s;h'd his Spirit, by &s;ending him a &s;mall Sum.&mdash; 'Plea&s;e Sir, (&s;ays the <HI>Doctor</HI> in a Letter of <HI>November</HI> 17th) to accept the <HI>ten Pounds</HI> inclos'd for you,' for which Mr. SERGEANT return'd his grateful Acknow|ledgments
<PB N="117" REF="007023_0122_102AEB325F8F9ED0">
in a Letter of <HI>December</HI> 11.&mdash; <Q>I have receiv'd your mo&s;t obliging Letter&mdash;and the <HI>ten Pounds</HI> inclos'd, which I accept with great Thankfulne&s;s. I return Prai&s;e to God in the fir&s;t Place, as the original Author of every good Thing; and in the next Place to you, who have been made, under him, the In&s;trument of many Kindne&s;&s;es to me. You have my &s;er|vent Prayers in Return, &s;pringing from an Heart deeply &s;en|&s;ible of the Kindne&s;s of God to me, by your Beneficence. May the Smiles and Joy of God to you be the Recompence of tho&s;e repeated Favours, with which you have &s;o often refre&s;h'd my Bowels.</Q></P>
<P>As Mr. SERGEANT was laborious and faithful in the Work to which he was call'd; &s;o there is good Rea&s;on to conclude, that he was &s;ucce&s;sful therein: not only from the Increa&s;e of Know|ledge, and a vi&s;ible Reformation among the <HI>Indians</HI>; but al&s;o from the Temper of Mind &s;ome of them di&s;cover'd at the Time of their Death, &s;ome In&s;tances of which I have given above, and &s;hall here add two or three more, by &s;ugge&s;ting a few Hints concerning &s;ome young Per&s;ons who died this Year, and the Beginning of the next. The very brief Account which Mr. SER|GEANT, in his Journal, gives of them is as follows&mdash; <Q><HI>May</HI> 22. died a young Per&s;on, not bapti&s;ed; but expre&s;&s;ing a &s;erious Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind. He was much in Prayer in his Sickne&s;s; deaf, and not able to &s;peak much; but, ju&s;t before he died, took his Father by the Hand, exhorted him to mind Religion, to get bapti&s;ed; &s;aid, he hoped for Happine&s;s, &s;pake <HI>the&s;e Things</HI> plain, and then died. <HI>January</HI> 19. 1745, 6. This Week died <HI>Katharine, Kunkapot</HI>'s elde&s;t Daughter, with good Hope of fu|ture Happine&s;s, and without any Fears of Death. <HI>Feb.</HI> 16. This Week died <HI>Kewaunnoabkub,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Naunaunekennuk,</HI> with a &s;trong Hope of eternal Life.</Q> What a de&s;ireable Sight was it to behold &s;uch young Per&s;ons, who, a little before, were Strangers to divine Things, leaving the World with &s;uch a com|fortable Hope of a glorious Immortality?</P>
<P>The honourable <HI>Corporation</HI> for <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs in <HI>London,</HI> to whom Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> had &s;ent Mr. SERGEANT's printed Letter, and his own Recommendation of it, received it; and their <HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI> in a Letter to the honourable <HI>Andrew Oliver,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>; <HI>Secretary</HI> to their honourable <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> inform'd him, that Mr. SER|GEANT'S
<PB N="118" REF="007023_0123_102AEB344FB63398">
Propo&s;al had gain'd the Approbation of the <HI>Society</HI> in <HI>London</HI>; that they were inclin'd to contribute to it; and that when there &s;hould be a Pro&s;pect of its taking Effect, they would con&s;ider the Matter, and encourage it as they conveniently could. This Letter Mr. <HI>Oliver</HI> communicated to Mr. SERGEANT, who wrote to the honourable <HI>Corporation,</HI> informing them, that the Affair of the <HI>Boarding-School</HI> had been delay'd by Rea&s;on of the <HI>War</HI>; that the Founding of it would co&s;t a con&s;iderable Sum, tho' he hop'd it might, afterwards, be carried on with but little Charge; that, upon a Computation made, it was tho't, that <HI>two Hundred Pounds</HI> Sterling would be needful; that he purpo&s;ed to proceed in that Affair, as far as pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances would admit; and concluded by humbly recommending it to the fa|vourable Notice and Encouragement of that honourable <HI>Corpo|ration.</HI> But I find not, among his Papers, any An&s;wer to this Letter, nor any Account of Money advanced by the <HI>Corporation</HI> for that Bu&s;ine&s;s; and therefore &s;uppo&s;e Nothing was done by them, while Mr. SERGEANT liv'd. Perhaps his Letter, in Time of War, might fail of reaching the <HI>Corporation.</HI></P>
<P>Another of tho&s;e <HI>Propo&s;als</HI> for a <HI>Boarding-School</HI> was &s;ent to Dr. <HI>Watts,</HI> the Effect of which Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> inform'd Mr. SER|GEANT of in a Letter of <HI>May</HI> 21.&mdash; <Q>I am now, dear Sir, (&s;ays the <HI>Doctor</HI>) to inform you, that la&s;t Night I received a Letter from Dr. <HI>Watts,</HI> dated <HI>March</HI> 26, wherein he &s;ays to me, I have your Letter from Mr. SERGEANT, and have made a &s;mall Collection among a few Friends for his De&s;ign, and pious Work in the Education of &s;ome of the neighbouring <HI>In|dians</HI>; and now I inclo&s;e a Bill of Exchange to you, for <HI>&s;eventy Pounds</HI> your Currency, from Mr. <HI>Henry Ca&s;well</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> Merchant.</Q> So he &s;alutes Mr. SERGEANT, and wi&s;hes him Suc|ce&s;s. I rejoice with you, Sir, in this fir&s;t Fruit. And in a Letter of <HI>June</HI> 10. the <HI>Doctor</HI> &s;ays,&mdash; <Q>I lately inform'd you of a Bill <HI>&s;eventy Pounds</HI> our Currency, from the excellent Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> of <HI>London,</HI>&mdash;The Money is in my Scriptore, wrote upon from him to you. I &s;hall be glad to forward a Letter of Thanks from you to him.</Q>&mdash;Accordingly, Mr. SERGEANT, in his next Letter to Dr. <HI>Colman,</HI> &s;ays;&mdash;<Q>I have inclos'd a Letter, &s;uch as it is, for Dr. <HI>Watts</HI>; be pleas'd to forward it to him with as much Safety as you can, and as &s;oon as may be.</Q> Of this
<PB N="119" REF="007023_0124_102AEB3643722808">
Letter to Dr. <HI>Watts,</HI> and of many others which Mr. SERGEANT wrote to one and another, I find no Copies, which lays me under no &s;mall Di&s;advantage in my Endeavours to give a good Account of the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Thomas Coram of London,</HI> a Gentleman who has di&s;cover'd a generous and noble Spirit in divers Projections for the Benefit of the <HI>Nation,</HI> and for the Good of Mankind, in &s;ome of which he happily &s;ucceeded, receiv'd from Dr. Colman Mr. SERGEANT's Propo&s;al for a Boarding-School. When he had read the Scheme, he was very much pleas'd with it; and in a Letter dated London, January 23, he gave the Doctor Thanks for the Book,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. SERGEANT's printed <HI>Letter</HI> and Dr. <HI>Colman's Recommendation</HI> make a &s;mall Book.</NOTE> and allured him that he had taken no &s;mall Pains to promote that good Work, and that he entertain'd Hopes, that the Prince of Wales would encourage that pious De&s;ign by becoming the fir&s;t Sub&s;criber.</P>
<P>Of this Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> inform'd Mr. SERGEANT in a Letter of May 7, which much reviv'd his Hopes re&s;pecting his <HI>Boarding-School</HI>; and in his An&s;wer of <HI>May</HI> 29, he &s;ays to the <HI>Doctor</HI>: <Q>Mr. <HI>Coram</HI> has &s;hewn an excellent and mo&s;t generous Spirit in the Matter, for which I thank God; and de&s;ire you, when you write to him again, to give him my mo&s;t hearty Thanks, for the Pains he has taken in this Affair; which I hope will add to the Weight and Glory of that Crown of Righteoufnefs which waits for him, when he has fini&s;hed the Work de&s;ign'd him by Providence. And if he &s;ucceeds in this, it may per|haps appear worthy to be the la&s;t Service of &s;o indu&s;trious a Labourer for the Good of others. If the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Wales</HI> leads in the Sub&s;cription, it looks probable that it may &s;ecure the Succe&s;s of that De&s;ign, I have &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ir'd to &s;ee accom|pli&s;h'd. I am waiting to put &s;omething in Execution among the pious and liberal in our <HI>own Country,</HI> when the Face of Things, in divine Providence, &s;hall appear encouraging.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Coram</HI> was &s;o charmed (to u&s;e his own Expre&s;&s;ion) with Mr. SERGEANT's Undertaking, that he exerted him&s;elf abun|dantly to promote it. He fir&s;t got a Book bound, and a proper Preamble writ in it for Benefactors to Sub&s;cribe to, for the Benefit of Mr. SERGEANT's <HI>School</HI>: Then he applied to &s;ome wealthy
<PB N="120" REF="007023_0125_102AEB37D4EFE0E8">
Per&s;ons, both in City and Country: And tho' he found many, who expre&s;&s;ed their Willingne&s;s to encourage &s;o good a De&s;ign, by their Contributions; yet he could find no Per&s;on who was willing his Name &s;hould &s;tand fir&s;t in the Sub&s;cription: but all cho&s;e to &s;ub&s;cribe after it was well begun by &s;ome proper Per&s;on.

<P>A certain Gentleman in <HI>London,</HI> and a Lady of his Acquain|tance, (which Lady Capt. <HI>Coram</HI> had before appl'd to, to be|come the fir&s;t Sub&s;criber) had informed the <HI>Captain,</HI> that, when the Sub&s;cription was well begun, they would contribute to that good De&s;ign. He therefore now wrote to the Gentleman, ac|quainted him with the Succe&s;s he had met with, &s;ent him a Copy of the above Petition to the <HI>Prince,</HI> and inform'd him, that he de&s;ign'd to wait upon the Lady for her Sub&s;cription. The Gen|tleman &s;ent back the, Petition to Mr. <HI>Coram,</HI> and wrote to him, letting him know, that his Conduct had been &s;uch, that neither the Lady, nor he would have any Thing more to &s;ay to him. This Treatment gave the good Gentleman &s;uch a Di&s;gu&s;t, that he proceeded no further. And, in a Letter of <HI>May</HI> 10, he &s;ays to Mr. SERGEANT,&mdash;<Q>I really believe I &s;hould have got ten Times as much as I have, if I had not been prevented by that unhand&s;ome U&s;age.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="007023_0129_102AEB3FDE9CA3B0">What a Pity is it, that a Sub&s;cription to encourage &s;uch a pious and noble De&s;ign, that had &s;o good a Lead, and &s;uch a fair Pro&s;pect of &s;ucceeding, &s;hould be put by becau&s;e of the ill U&s;age one or two Per&s;ons offered to the generous Promoter of it? Would not one have tho't, that &s;eeing that Gentleman &amp; Lady fail'd, there was the more Need of applying to others, who had given Encouragement, that they would &s;mile upon the Affair by their free Contributions?

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your mo&s;t obliging Letter of <HI>May</HI> 10. 1746, containing an Account of your generous Endeavours to promote the De&s;ign of my publick Propo&s;al for the <HI>Indians,</HI> I have juit now receiv'd together with the Invoice of the Particulars you have &s;ent to the Care of Mr. <HI>Wallis</HI> in <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> By Dr. <HI>Colman</HI>'s Favour, I was before, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, acquainted with your Zeal, your generous Concern &amp; Pains for us; which gave me great Satis|faction, &amp; mov'd both my Thank&s; givings to God &amp; Prayers for you. But your Letter, containing an Account of your La|bours in this Affair, gives me &s;uch an Opinion of your Good|ne&s;s as exceeds what I could readily have imagined. It is a great Plea&s;ure to me, that you &s;eem to be mov'd with &s;o ge|nerous a Spirit, and &s;o much above the narrow and niggardly Conceptions of Bigots; which Temper is as great an Abhor|rence to my Mind as it can be to yours. And I am &s;ure the Plea&s;ure you take, in &s;uch generous Labours for Mankind, mu&s;t be as much above the little Satisfaction of Bigots, in promoting their own party Schemes, as the Temper with which you are actuated is preferable to theirs. And your Reward with God will be in Proportion to the Excellency of that Charity that
<PB N="127" REF="007023_0132_102AEB466B423800">
moves you, in your generous Labours for us. Nothing, to be &s;ure, could have been better de&s;ign'd than to get tho&s;e great Per&s;ons you applied to, to honour the De&s;ign with their Sub|&s;criptions: And that it has been favour'd in our excellent <HI>Royal</HI> Family, is by me e&s;teem'd an additional Obligation of Duty to endeavour to promote a Spirit of Loyalty in the <HI>Indians,</HI> as far as my Influence now, or any Time hereafter, may reach.</P>
<P>It is now a little more than eleven Years &s;ince I was fir&s;t &s;et|tled in this Part of the Country, with a De&s;ign to pro&s;elite the <HI>Indians</HI> to the Chri&s;tian Faith. Having &s;pent Part of the fore|going Year with them, in two Vi&s;its I made them, I found &s;uch Encouragement as induced me to devote my&s;elf to this Service: And have now, with a great deal of Pains, gain'd &s;uch an Acquaintance with their barbarous Language as to conver&s;e with them in it; and with a little A&s;&s;i&s;tance, in my Study, from an Interpreter, to preach to them, and to read Prayers, which I have compo&s;ed for the publick Wor&s;hip, which they attend as constantly as People generally do in Engli&s;h A&s;&s;em|blies Their Language is extreamly hard to learn, and perhaps I shall never be a thoro' Ma&s;ter of it; there never having been any <HI>European</HI> that ever was, except one or two, and they learn'd it when they were Children. But the young People among them learn <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> well; mo&s;t of them in this Place under&s;tand a great deal of it, and &s;ome &s;peak it freely &amp; correctly. There are many that can read <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> well, and &s;ome are able to write. When I came into the&s;e Parts fir&s;t they were much di&s;per&s;ed, four or five Families in a Place, and often moving from Place to Place. They are now gathered together at this Place, and are much more fixed than they u&s;ed to be. In&s;tead of their Bark Hutts, they own &s;eventeen <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hou&s;es, fifteen of which they have built them&s;elves at their own Co&s;t, and &s;ome of them are comfortably furni&s;hed with Hou&s;hold Stuff, There were in this Place but eight or ten Families when I fir&s;t came, we now reckon near Fifty be&s;ides old People &amp; tran&s;ient young Per&s;ons. The Families indeed are but &s;mall, as is com|mon among the Natives. Near half that are born die in In|fancy or Childhood, which I attribute to their Manner of Liv|ing, and want of &s;uitable Medicines in Time of Sickne&s;s. The grown People abundantly die with Con&s;umptions, begun with
<PB N="128" REF="007023_0133_102AEB485DF55790">
violent Colds. The mo&s;t of the &s;ettled Families in our Neigh|bourhood are gathered to this Place, and the greater Part of them have received <HI>Bapti&s;m.</HI> Our Number increa&s;es from Time to Time by the Addition of new Families, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e who are kindly di&s;pos'd to Chri&s;tianity, It is probable we &s;hould have had more of them before now, if there had not come &s;ome <HI>Meravian</HI> Preachers among &s;ome of them near to us. I do not pretend to &s;o much Acquaintance with that Sort of People, as to pa&s;s any po&s;itive Judgment about them; the Converts they have made, are, I think, Enthu&s;ia&s;tick &amp; bigot|ted. They have rendred them&s;elves &s;o much &s;u&s;pected in the Governments of <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>Connecticut,</HI> that they would not tolerate them within their Bounds. They refu&s;ed to take the Oath of Allegiance to <HI>King George,</HI> or even the Quakers &s;olemn Declaration. What was the Meaning of this I cannot tell. They drew off a Number of <HI>Indians</HI> from the&s;e Parts, and &s;ome from this Place to <HI>Pen&s;ylvania.</HI> We have of <HI>Indians</HI> in regular &s;tanding in the Church? 35, 13 <HI>Males</HI> and 22 <HI>Females,</HI> be&s;ides five or &s;ix under a temporary Su&s;pen&s;ion from the Com|munion, &s;ome of which I hope may be recovered to Repen|tance. Out of our Communion have died eight or nine, mo&s;t of whom &s;eem to me to have left the World with a good Chri&s;tian Temper, and with a well grounded Hope, be&s;ides &s;ome other younger Per&s;ons, I could not but hope well of. The Succe&s;s I have had, thro' the divine Ble&s;&s;ing, has been tho't as great as has attended any late Attempt of this Kind, and yet I have nothing to boa&s;t of; but have Rea&s;on to be humbled, that my Labours have been &s;o much bla&s;ted: I am &s;ure nothing affects me with more Grief than to ob&s;erve the little Fruit of my Labours. Some of tho&s;e who have appear'd the mo&s;t promi&s;ing Converts, have, to my great Grief, and, &s;ome Times, even to my A&s;toni&s;hment, &s;trangely fallen away, which has almo&s;t wholly di&s;couraged my further Attempts. The Truth is, the <HI>Indians</HI> are, perhaps, as fickle and irre&s;olute in their Determinations, as any People in the World: And when they &s;eem to be wholly recovered from their Vice. ea&s;ily relap&s;e into their &s;ooli&s;h &amp; wicked national Habits. I &s;peak of the Tribe to which I Mini&s;ter, and &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame Tem|per generally prevails among all the <HI>American Indians.</HI> Their
<PB N="129" REF="007023_0134_102AEB4AB7C0CFD8">
great national and fundamental Vices are, <HI>Idlene&s;s</HI> and Drunk|enne&s;s, which are a great Ob&s;truction to the Propagation of Chri&s;tianity among them, with any due &amp; la&s;ting Effect Be|&s;ides, there is an almo&s;t univer&s;al Jealou&s;y &s;pread among the Tribes of <HI>Indians,</HI> and a Su&s;picion of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> This, I am fore, is in a great Mea&s;ure the Effect of <HI>French</HI> Policy and the Work of their Mi&s;&s;ionaries.</P>
<P>I cannot think of any Method more likely to conquer the&s;e Difficulties, and to lay the Foundation for the larger Spreading of the Go&s;pel, or attaching the <HI>Indians</HI> to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t, than what I have publickly proposed. It it piea&s;e God to give it Effect, it may, in Time, be a Means of a great Deal of Good: And yet, I dare not promi&s;e my &s;elf fuddenly any extraordinary Succe&s;s from it. I &s;ee no Way that will, in human Probability, correct &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully their national Habits, as this I have pro|po&s;ed. It is not ealy for tho&s;e, who are not acquainted with barbarous Nations to conceive, into what a Degree of Barbarity they are funk; nor how difficult it is to recover them. A great Deal has been done for our <HI>Indians.</HI> To their Honour, this Government has done much; but yet, &s;o jealous were they at the fir&s;t, that they could hardly be per&s;uaded to accept the Kindne&s;&s;es that were offer'd them, and &s;ome they actually re|iu&s;ed. We are now got over this Difficulty, which has been a vail Hindrance to our De&s;ign.</P>
<P>Our Situation here is the belt, to lay &s;uch a Foundation, of any to be found in <HI>New-England.</HI> By the Favour of the Go|vernment, we have a good Town&s;hip of Land, capable of maintaining three Times the Number of Inhabitants that we have; and, I believe, it might be, in Time, repleni&s;hed with that Number, by this Means. And if we could per&s;uade a Number of young People, from the &s;everal remote Tribes, to receive an Education here, they might be a Means of Propa|gating Chri&s;tian Knowledge and Vertue very far among their Tribes: And there is Ground to hope, we might obtain this, by the Influence of two <HI>Eagli&s;h</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionaries in the We&s;tern Parts. I mean Mr. <HI>Barclay,</HI> a worthy Gentleman, and my particular Friend, Mi&s;&s;ionary to the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> who received his Orders from the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> and is maintained by the <HI>Society for Propagating the Go&s;pel</HI>; &amp;c. but as he is <HI>Chaplain,</HI>
<PB N="130" REF="007023_0135_102AEB4CA8FA20A8">
at the &s;ame Time, in the King's Garri&s;on at <HI>Albany,</HI> and oblig'd to &s;pend halt his Time there, 40 Miles di&s;tant from them, and has no e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>School Ma&s;ter</HI> or <HI>Catechi&s;t,</HI> labours under great Di&s;advantages. The other Gentleman, I mear, is Mr. <HI>Brainard</HI> a zealous and well di&s;pos'd young Man, &s;ome Account of whom you have in a Pamphlet, which accompanies this. In a Word, Sir, I think the De&s;ign of a <HI>School,</HI> in the Manner I have pro|jected, is of very great Importance, not to &s;ay ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in order to the effectual Propagation of the Chri&s;tian Religion among them; and unle&s;s this People are, beyond all other, under a Cur&s;e from Heaven, this would probably do it: for, except their Complection, I &s;ee nothings in this People, but that they may be cultivated into as agreable a People as any other. They are naturally ingenious and good tempered as other People, and many of the little Children very pretty and agreable; and &s;eem to want Nothing but a right Cultiva|tion to form their Minds and Manners into every laudable. Quality and Action, human Nature is capable of. If I can be. the In&s;trument in the Hand of Providence, to lay &s;uch a Foun|dation as this, it would be a great Satisfaction to my Mind; and, I hope, Generations to come will have Occa&s;ion to re|member my Name with Gratitude.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure, the De&s;ign is good; and, it &s;eems to me, as it is nece&s;&s;ary as it is good; for indeed, without this Method of In&s;truction &amp; Cultivation of their Children, our Labour &s;eems to be, in great Mea&s;ure, vain. I cannot but hope it may be effected, notwith&s;tanding the Di&s;couragements it has hit herto met with. I believe there might have been &s;ome con&s;iderable Sub&s;criptions made in this Country, had not the War prevented. When it &s;hall plea&s;e God to put an End to this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Ca|lamity, I &s;hall u&s;e my utmo&s;t Endeavours with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of good and well-di&s;pos'd Gentlemen, to put the Matter forward.</P>

He al&s;o &s;ays to him, that he was glad the Con|gregation of <HI>Stockbridge</HI> had receiv'd the <HI>Bible</HI> he &s;ent; which &s;eems to intimate, that the fir&s;t Information he had of their re|ceiving of it, was by Mr. SERGEANT's Letter of <HI>July</HI> 22, 1748; whereas Mr. SERGEANT in his Letter of <HI>January</HI> 24, 1746, 7, inform'd the <HI>Doctor</HI> of the Receipt of it, and return'd himThanks for it. I have before taken Notice, that as &s;oon as Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI> was made acquainted with Mr. SERGEANT's De&s;ign of a <HI>Boardiug|School,</HI> he directly ordered twelve more Boys to be taken in upon that Foundation, and educated wholly at his Co&s;t. But, by Rea|&s;on of the War, which much affected them of <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> his Orders were not put in Execution, and the whole Affair of the <HI>Boarding-School</HI> was defer'd, till a more favourable Opportunity. Mr. <HI>Hollis,</HI> being inform'd of this, wrote this Year to Dr.<HI>Colman,</HI> in&s;i&s;ting upon it, that 12 Boys &s;hould, without any furtherDelay, be taken &amp; educated at his Charge: And tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages of Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI>'s Letter, which related to that Affair, Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> tran&s;|crib'd to Mr. SERGEANT.

<P>About the Middle of <HI>July,</HI> Mr. SERGEANT &s;et out on a Jour|ney to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> in order to forward this important Affair.

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Some Years are now pa&s;t, &s;ince a Propo&s;al for the more effectual Education of the <HI>Indian</HI> Children, and the further Spreading otChri&s;tian Knowledge &amp; Piety among their &s;everal Tribes, written in a Letter to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e Reverend and pious Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> was publi&s;hed, with his Recommendation of theDe&s;ign. Several Copies or the Propo&s;al were di&s;per&s;ed, not only in the&s;e Parts, but al&s;o in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> particularly by the Means of that worthy and excellent Gentleman, and, if I mi&s;take not, he tran&s;mitted &s;ome Copies to your <HI>honourable Society.</HI></P>
<P>The Execution of that De&s;ign has been much hindred and delay'd by the War we have been engag'd in with <HI>France.</HI> But, as there is now a Pro&s;pect of Peace, I hope that De&s;ign may, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, take Effect. A private Gentleman in <HI>England</HI> &s;ets a noble &amp; generous Example, which, if it be follow'd as it de&s;erves, wiil, it is to be hoped, &s;oon carry the De&s;ign &s;o for|ward as to an&s;wer &s;ome of the great and good Ends propos'd. That pious and charitable Gentleman propo&s;es at his own Co&s;t, to cloath, maintain and educate twelve Boys. The De&s;ign I think &s;o good &amp; &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, con&s;idering the gro&s;s Ignorance and Barbarity of our <HI>Indian</HI> Tribes, that I would not be wanting in any Thing in my Power to forward it. And &s;ince your <HI>honourable Society</HI> has &s;hown &s;o laudable a Zeal to propagate Chri&s;tian Knowledge and Piety, among the poor barbarous Aborigines of <HI>America,</HI> I tho't it proper, humbly, but yet ear|ne&s;tly, to recommend it to your charitable Notice. If it comes within the Limits of your Province, I cannot think your Charity can be better be&s;tow'd.</P>
<P>The projected <HI>School</HI> is de&s;ign'd much in the Manner of the Charily Schools in <HI>Ireland,</HI> which, we are told, have had won|derful good Effects: and why may not the &s;ame Methods of Education us'd here, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of the &s;ame gracious God, have the like good Effects? By &s;ufficient Experience, I have found, that more effectual Methods of Education, than what have yet been us'd, e&s;pecially in Re&s;pect of Manners and In|du&s;try in Bu&s;ine&s;s, are highly nece&s;&s;ary for this barbarous un|cultivated People.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="007023_0144_102AEB5E4B520A70">I would gladly have, in the projected School, all the more u&s;eful and important Parts of Learning that &s;erve in common Life, and that &s;ome, at lea&s;t, may be fitted there for an <HI>Acade|mical</HI> Education; and &s;o be qualified to in&s;truct others; that, in Time, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, the Kingdom of Chri&s;l may &s;pread more &s;ucce&s;sfully far and wide, by their Means, among the remoter Tribes. One would hope this might be done, and an&s;wer, at the &s;ame Time, both a religious and a political View. Certainly, if, from us, Learning and good Manners could be propagated among them, it would be a Means of engaging them more firmly in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t: but if, with Learning and good Manners, true Religion might take Place among them, then they would become the Subjects of theKing of Heaven, and be joined to theNumber of Chri&s;t's Redeemed, which mu&s;t needs be the Wi&s;h and earne&s;t De&s;ire of every &s;in|cere Chri&s;tian.</P>

any Thing to promote it. Seeing that Society de&s;ired a Corre|&s;pondence with Mr. SERGEANT, and that he would begin it, by giving them an Account what Progre&s;s Religion had made among the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Stockbridge</HI> which he did; and &s;eeing he now wrote to them as above, it is &s;omewhat &s;trange that he never receiv'd a Line from them.

<SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I receiv'd, la&s;t Week, the Favour of yours, dated <HI>July</HI> 22. 1748. and am glad to hear that your Congregation are at la&s;t in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Bible</HI>; pray God ble&s;s it to them, and, under the Direction of &s;o faithful and pious an Expo&s;itor, make it the Means of Grace &amp; of Salvation to them. I &s;till continue my ardent Wi&s;hes for the Succe&s;s of the truly Chri&s;tian &amp; apo&s;tolick De&s;ign you are engaged in; and I think the Method you are in, for the educating young <HI>Indians,</HI> in the Knowledge of the Truth, the mo&s;t effectual one that can be taken. Pray God give you Succe&s;s. But whether that follows or not, your En|deavours for it cannot fail of a Reward. I often think of your Pains and of your Merit, and I look upon my&s;elf as Nothing in Compari&s;on of you, who have devoted your&s;elf to a mo&s;t hazardous and laborious Life, in Order to introduce the Know|ledge of the Go&s;pel among the Heathen Nations. I mu&s;t not only con&s;ider you as a good Chri&s;tian, but al&s;o as a u&s;eful and good Subject, &s;ince every Convert you make mu&s;t be look'd upon as a new Subject brought over to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t. And truly, the infinite Pains that are taken by the <HI>French</HI> (who &s;eldom come behind us in civil Policy) to make <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> of the <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;hould teach us to u&s;e &s;ome Endeavours to make <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> of them.

</LETTER>
<P>Mr. SERGEANT receiv'd this Letter but a little While before his Death, and, if I mi&s;take not, I have been inform'd, that he had not Opportunity to return an An&s;wer to it. For the Satis|faction therefore of tho&s;e into who&s;e Hands this Hi&s;tory may fall, and who want to be inform'd in the Things after which Dr. <HI>Ay&s;cough</HI> enquires; and for the Satisfaction of the <HI>Doctor</HI> him|&s;elf, if it &s;hould ever reach him, I &s;hall briefly touch upon what has not been &s;ufficiently illu&s;trated in the foregoing Account.</P>
<P>As for <HI>the Scheme which Mr.</HI> SERGEANT <HI>was pur&s;uing</HI>;&mdash;&s;ome Account was given of it in his Letter of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1. 1743, to Dr. <HI>Colman,</HI> to which it may not be ami&s;s here to add; that his De|&s;ign was, that the <HI>Indian</HI> Boys, under the Care of a faithful Ma&s;ter, who &s;hould labour with and in&s;pect them, &s;hould &s;ubdue and cultivate the 200 Acres of Land upon which they live; that they &s;hould rai&s;e upon it all Sorts of Provi&s;ions; that they &s;hould keep upon the Farm a Stock of Cattle, Sheep, Hogs, &amp;c. that the Girls &s;hould be employ'd in Manufacturing the Wool, Flax, Milk, &amp;c. that &s;hould be rais'd upon it: They al&s;o, being under the Care of a faithful Mi&s;tre&s;s, who &s;hould in&s;truct them in all Sorts of Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;uitable to their Sex. By this Means, they
<PB N="142" REF="007023_0147_102AEB63DEFCB958">
might, after &s;ome Time, in great Mea&s;ure, if not wholly, &s;upport them&s;elves; be form'd to Indu&s;try; be acquainted with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Language and Manners; and be fit, at about 20 Years of Age, to &s;et up upon Farms of their own. By taking the <HI>In|dian</HI> Children when young, and bringing them up in the Way of Indu&s;try (as well as Learning) Mr. SERGEANT de&s;ign'd to cure them of Idlene&s;s, which they are much addicted to, and which is a Seed Plot of all Manner of Vice among the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>As to <HI>the Situation of the Place where Mr.</HI> SERGEANT <HI>&s;ettled</HI>;&mdash;I ob&s;erv'd before, that <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk</HI> is in the S. W. Corner of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Province, butting upon <HI>Connecticut Colony</HI> South, and upon <HI>New-York Government</HI> We&s;t. For tho' by Charter the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Province</HI> extends We&s;t to the South Sea, and mu&s;t therefore Butt upon the Gulf of <HI>California</HI> near the North Part of it, yet the <HI>Dutch</HI> being previou&s;ly &s;ettled upon <HI>Hud&s;on's River,</HI> cut this <HI>Province</HI> in two, and at pre&s;ent we inhabit no further We&s;t than to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Settlements. <HI>Stockbridge</HI> lies at the North End of what goes by the Name of <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> about 16 or 18 Miles North of <HI>Connecticut</HI> Line, upon a Stream which goes by the Name of <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk River,</HI> and empties it&s;elf into the Sea, between <HI>Milford</HI> and <HI>Stratford</HI> in <HI>Connecticut Colony.</HI> This <HI>River,</HI> tho' it be Navigable for 8 or 10 Miles from the Mouth of it, and extends it&s;elf cro&s;s the <HI>Colony</HI> of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and almo&s;t cro&s;s the <HI>Province</HI> of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> more than 120 Miles into Land, yet is not laid down in any of the Maps, which I have &s;een of this Country.</P>
<P>The Place of this <HI>River</HI> at <HI>Stockbridge</HI> is about 40 or 45 Miles We&s;t of <HI>Connecticut River,</HI> and about 25 or 30 Miles Ea&s;t of <HI>Hud&s;on's River.</HI> It's Cour&s;e at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk</HI> is from North to South, and after it enters <HI>Connecticut Colony</HI> it bears con&s;iderably to the Ea&s;t of South, till it falls into the Ocean at <HI>Stratford.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Northampton,</HI> upon <HI>Connecticut River,</HI> is in, or near, the &s;ame Parallel of Latitude with <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Neal</HI> in his Hi&s;tory of <HI>New-England</HI> has, in his Map, laid down <HI>Connecticut</HI> and <HI>Hud&s;on's Rivers,</HI> which in the Latitude of <HI>Northampton &amp; Stock|bridge</HI> are about 70 or 80 Miles a&s;under. Any one therefore, by looking into Mr. <HI>Neal</HI>'s Map, and drawing a We&s;t Line from <HI>Northampton,</HI> of 40, or 45 Miles extent, may ea&s;ily fix the Place of <HI>Stockbridge.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="007023_0148_102AEB65D5B13518">As for <HI>the Condition of the Place</HI>;&mdash;the foregoing Hi&s;tory, with what may be further &s;aid, will perhaps be tho't &s;ufficient.&mdash;And as for <HI>the Condition of the Country round it</HI>;&mdash;South, upon <HI>Hou&s;a|tunnuk River,</HI> it has lately been purcha&s;ed of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and is &s;ettled by Inhabitants of this <HI>Province.</HI> The Name of the Town is <HI>Sheffield</HI>; it is divided into two Pari&s;hes, in each of which there is a Mini&s;ter &s;ettled. Ea&s;t of <HI>Stockbridge</HI> there is a Wilderne&s;s of about 40 Miles extent, which reaches to the Engli&s;h Settlements upon <HI>Connecticut River</HI>; it is Mountainous, and loaded with im|men&s;e Quantities of Timber, of almo&s;t all Sorts.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In <HI>Stockbridge</HI> Bounds, and, in the adjacent Wilderne&s;s, is found Plenty of that famous Ea&s;t India Root, <HI>Gin Sang.</HI> In the Summer 1751, it was fir&s;t found.</NOTE> We&s;t is a Wood of about 20 Miles extent, reaching to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Settle|ments in <HI>New-York Government.</HI> And North lies that <HI>great and terrible Wilderne&s;s,</HI> of &s;everal Hundred Miles extent, which reaches to <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P><HI>What Progre&s;s Mr.</HI> SERGEANT <HI>made,</HI> may, I hope, in &s;ome good Mea&s;ure, be judged of, by the whole Account I have here given. And with Re&s;pect to <HI>the Number of Mr.</HI> SERGEANT's <HI>Congregation, and of what Sort of Per&s;ons it con&s;i&s;ts</HI>;&mdash;Mr. <HI>Wood|bridge,</HI> a little after Mr. SERGEANT's Death, wrote to me, that there were 53 <HI>Indian</HI> Families in the Town, that they own'd 20 Hou&s;es built after the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mode, and that the whole Number of Indians living at <HI>Stockbridge</HI> was then 218; of which 129 have been baptized. Of the&s;e 42 were Communicants, 18 Males and 24 Females. The whole Number of <HI>Indians</HI> bapti&s;ed by Mr. SERGEANT, both living and dead, was 182. The Number of Scholars belonging to Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI>'s School was 55, about 40 is the Number which attend the School at once. There are al&s;o about 12 or 13 Engli&s;h Families dwelling there.</P>
<P>As for <HI>the School lately &s;et up for the Indian Children,</HI> (by which Dr. <HI>Ay&s;cough</HI> intends the <HI>Boarding-School,</HI> and not that under the Care of Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI>) I have before given an Account of Mr. SERGEANT's taking 12 <HI>Indian</HI> Boys upon that Foundation, and at Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI>'s Co&s;t, and committing them to the Care of Capt. <HI>Kellogg</HI> of <HI>Newington,</HI> for a Year. Tho&s;e Boys made Progre&s;s in Reading and Writing beyond the Captain's Expectation, and in the general behav'd well. Some Time in the Winter Mr. SER|GEANT wrote to Capt. <HI>Kellogg,</HI> de&s;iring him to come up to <HI>Stock|bridge</HI>
<PB N="144" REF="007023_0149_102AEB682A3534D0">
with them in <HI>April,</HI> theCaptain <HI>did &s;o</HI>; and upon examin|ing the Boys Mr. SERGEANT was well pleas'd with the Progre&s;s they had made in their Learning. Mr. SERGEANT now urg'd Mr. Kellogg to take the Care of the Boys one Year at <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> to which he contented: And after in&s;tructing them a While in a private Hou&s;e, he went with them into the Boarding-School, which was now prepar'd for their Reception, tho' far &s;hort or being fini&s;hed. The Dimentions of this Boarding-School, which Mr. SERGEANT had erected, are, 38 Feet long, 36 wide: It has three Fire Rooms on one Floor, and two convenient Rooms be|&s;ides, with a large Cellar under it. Of the&s;e Things Capt.<HI>Kellogg</HI> gave me an Account, in a Letter, foon after Mr. SERGEANT's Death: And this, &s;o far as I under&s;tand it, was the State of that School when he died. His De&s;ign was, this Summer, if his Life had been &s;par'd, to have gone with Capt. <HI>Kellogg,</HI> (who in his Youth was twice taken Captive by the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Canada,</HI> and therefore had &s;ome Acquaintance with the <HI>Mobawk</HI> Language and Cu&s;toms) into the <HI>Mohawk</HI> Country, or to the <HI>Six</HI>-Nations as they are call'd, to invite them to &s;end their Children, to re|ceive an Education in the Boarding School; and to have opened the Doors of it to the Children of any of the Tribes of Indians, who would fend them there to be educated.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Thing that Dr. <HI>Ay&s;cough</HI> defir'd to be inform'd of is, <HI>Whether Mr.</HI> SERGEANT <HI>had any Salary or certain Appointment for his Labours or not</HI>? Before Mr. SERGEANT's Ordination he re|ceived from the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> at the Rate of &pound;. 100 a Year our Currency. At his Ordination they fix'd his Salary at &pound;. 150, when &pound;. 1 7s. 6d. of our Paper Currency was equal to an Ounce of Silver. They continued ic at &pound;. 150 for the Space of fix Years (as Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> informs me) during which Time our Paper Currency was near the &s;ame in Value, it having depreciated no more than from &pound;. 1 7s. 6d. to &pound;. 1. 9s. an Ounce: But continuing &s;till to fink in its Value, the Comm&s;&s;ioners allow'd him &pound;. 200, aad then &pound;. 250, and &s;o it continued till the la&s;t Year of his Life, when they gave him &pound;. 300; &pound;. 2 17s. 9d. of our Pa|per Currency then, not being more valuable than an Ounce of Silver.</P>
<P>If by tho&s;e Additions, the &s;inking of Money was made good (as I am &s;en&s;ible he tho't it was not; and his Salary was equal in
<PB N="145" REF="007023_0150_102AEB69B4AF1B38">
Value, to what it was at his fir&s;t Settlement, Silver being the Standard: Yet, it it be con&s;ider'd with Relation to the Nece&s;&s;|ries of Life, for which it was expended, his Salary was not half &s;o good the la&s;t Year as it was the fir&s;t: for Wheat, when he &s;ettled at <HI>Stockbridge</HI> was to be had for <HI>eight Sbillings</HI> a Bu&s;hel, and other Provi&s;ions in Proportion; but when his Salary was &pound;. 300, it was not to be had under <HI>forty,</HI> or <HI>forty-five Sbillings</HI> a Bu&s;hel, and other Provi&s;ions were proportionally dear. The Sum it&s;elf confidered, every one mu&s;t be &s;enfible that his Salary was &s;mall, for it was but equal to &pound;. 36 7s. 3d. our pre&s;ent Lawful Money, at 6s. 8d. the Ounce: and no more than &pound;27 6s. 2d. Sterling. And can it be tho't, that he could &s;upport him|&s;elf and Family with that Sum, e&s;pecially &s;eeing all the Nece&s;&s;a|ries of Life were then, and are &s;till, very dear in that remote Part of the Country. Had it not been for the Helps he receiv'd from Dr. <HI>Colman</HI>'s Hand, and from other generous and well di&s;pos'd Per&s;ons, he could not have &s;ub&s;i&s;ited at <HI>Stockbridge</HI> &s;o long a Time: And after all the Helps he had, he was, while he liv'd, involv'd in many Difficulties, by Rea&s;on of the Scantine&s;s of his Support; and when he died, he left his E&s;tate involv'd in a Debt of between 7 and &pound;. 800 <HI>New-England</HI> Currency, even tho' he had &s;old &s;ome of it before to an&s;wer his nece&s;&s;ary Expences. A Friend of his, who was well acquainted with his Circum&s;tances, in a Letter to me, written &s;ince his Death, u&s;es the following Expre&s;&s;ions.&mdash; <Q>I &s;hould have mentioned to you the pre&s;&s;ing Want Mr. SER|GEANT has often been in, for want of a &s;ufficient Support in his laborious Work. Had not a good Providence, in a&s;urpri&s;ing Manner, provided and &s;ent &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tance to him, it is not at all probable he would have left any Thing that could have been a Benefit to his Family. And had it not been for his &s;ingular Prudence, and tho&s;e Helps, he mu&s;t have &s;old mo&s;t of what the Government gave him<NOTE N="*">His Right of Land in <HI>Stockbridge.</HI></NOTE> long ago.</Q></P>
<P>Thus I have endeavour'd to an&s;wer the Rev. Dr. <HI>Ay&s;cough</HI>'s Enquiries, which had Mr. SERGEANT liv'd to have done, he doubtle&s;s would have perform'd in a much better Manner, and more to the Satisfaction of tho&s;e who want to be inform'd.</P>
<P>It would be a faulty Omi&s;&s;ion, &s;hould I neglect to &s;ay, that when his Excellency <HI>Governour Beicher</HI> came into his Government of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> Mr. SERGEANT wrote to him, congratulated him
<PB N="146" REF="007023_0151_102AEB6BA3552698">
on that Occa&s;ion, expre&s;t his Joy and Satisfaction that he was appointed Governour of his native Country, and returned him his mo&s;t hearty Thanks for the favourable Mention his Excellency had made of him in <HI>England,</HI> particularly to Dr. <HI>Ay&s;cough,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Coram.</HI> The <HI>Governour,</HI> yet retaining his former Kindne&s;s and Friend&s;hip tor Mr. SERGEANT, wrote, in a mo&s;t kind and obliging Manner, to him; a&s;&s;uring him of his Readine&s;s to &s;erve him, in what lay in his Power, and recommending to him the keeping up a careful &amp; dutiful Corre&s;pondence with Dr. <HI>Ay&s;cough</HI> and Mr. <HI>Coram,</HI> Gentlemen who were both willing and able to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, in his laudable and pious Undertaking.</P>
<P>The very great Regard Dr. <HI>Ay&s;cough</HI> had for, and his Gene|ro&s;ity to, Mr. SERGEANT, I know not how better expre&s;s, than in the <HI>Doctor</HI>'s own Words; as they are contain'd in a Pa&s;&s;age of a Letter which he wrote to his <HI>Excellency Governour Belcher,</HI> dated <HI>December</HI> 9. 1748. where &s;peaking of Mr. SERGEANT he &s;ays,&mdash; <Q>I mo&s;t highly honour, and regard, that worthy Mi|ni&s;ter of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and am proud to call him Bro|ther.

You may be a&s;&s;ured of my heartie&s;t Endeavours to promote the good De&s;ign he is engaged in.&mdash; I am in great Hopes of being able to procure &s;ome Pen&s;ion to be &s;ettled on him, that he may have &s;ome little Reward for his indefatigable Labours, even in this Life. In the mean Time, I &s;hould be glad to have the Sum of <HI>twenty Pounds</HI> ad|vanc'd <HI>to Him</HI>; but I am ignorant of the Means of doing it, I can only &s;ay, that if you or he will draw upon me for that Sum, I &s;hall think my&s;elf bound to honour your Bill at Sight.</Q> A Bill was accordingly drawn, and the <HI>Doctor</HI> &s;ent over <HI>twenty Pounds</HI> Sterling to <HI>Governour Beicher,</HI> who, in a Letter of <HI>May</HI> 16, 1749, (about two Months before Mr. SERGEANT's Death) inform'd him of the hand&s;ome Remittance the Rev. Dr. Ay&s;cough had made him; and tells him, that he would pay the Money to his Order: Which was accordingly done: Either ju&s;t before or a little after Mr. SERGEANT's Death.</P>
<P>I have here been the more exact, and have quoted Dr. <HI>Ay&s;cough</HI>'s own Words, that I might effectually remove a Mi&s;take that &s;ome have gone into, who have tho't and &s;aid that the <HI>twenty Pounds</HI>

<P>While Mr. SERGEANT was carefully and faithfully proceeding in his Mini&s;terial Labours, and with much Pains, Indu&s;try and Application, pro&s;ecuting that excellent, laudable and pious De&s;ign of the Boarding-School, (Burdens perhaps too heavy for his Con|&s;titution) purpo&s;ing al&s;o in a little Time to go into the <HI>Mohawk</HI> Country to invite their Children to it, he was taken ill of a Slow or Nervous Fever, attended with Canker, which in a few Weeks, put an End to his precious Life, (on <HI>July</HI> 27. 1749, in the 39th Year of his Age) and to all his generous, pious &amp; noble Tho'ts in Favour of the poor Natives, to &s;ome of whom he was, during his Mini&s;try, a great and rich Ble&s;&s;ing, an In&s;trument in the Hand of Chri&s;t of <HI>turning them from Darkne&s;s to Light and from the Power of Satan to God.</HI></P>
<P>To draw Mr. SERGEANT's Character, I am &s;en&s;ible, is a Work to which I am not equal: but &s;eeing it has not been attempted by any one heretofore, I &s;hall endeavour to give the ju&s;te&s;t Re|pre&s;entation of him I can, by tho&s;e Helps I am furni&s;hed with.</P>

<HEAD>The CHARACTER, &amp;c. Of the Reverend Mr. John Sergeant.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Reverend Mr. JOHN SERGEANT was born at <HI>Newark,</HI> in New-Jer&s;ey, in the Year 1710. His Father died when he was but a Child, after which his Mother was again married to Col. <HI>John Cooper,</HI> a Gentleman, who not only prov'd a tender Hu&s;band to her, but al&s;o a kind and generous Father to her Children; having none oF his own. Mr. SERGEANT, to his Childhood receiv'd a Wound by a Sythe in the Ball of his left Hand, near the Joint of his Wri&s;t, which &s;o affected the Sinews and Nerves, that his Hand, perished to that Degree, that it was much le&s;s than the other, and in great Mea&s;ure u&s;ele&s;s. This Accident was the Occa&s;ion of his leaving off the &s;ecular Bu&s;ine&s;s he was de&s;ign'd for, and of his betaking him&s;elf to Learning; in which, being a Per&s;on of a bright Genius, he made great Progre&s;s: Whereupon his Father in Law, Col. <HI>Cooper,</HI> re&s;olv'd to give him a liberal Education. He enter'd <HI>Yale-College, at New-Haven,</HI> in the <HI>Golany</HI> of <HI>Connecticut, September</HI> 1725, where the Comeline&s;s of his Per&s;on, the Sweetne&s;s of his Temper, the Docency of his Behaviour, the Agreablene&s;s of his Conver&s;ation, the Diligence with which he apply'd him&s;elf to and the Progre&s;s he made in, his Studies, gain'd him the E&s;teem, not only of his Companions, but al&s;o of the Governours of the College. He proceeded Bachelor of Arts, <HI>September</HI> 1729, and commenc'd Ma&s;ter 1732, before which he was elected Tutor of the College, in which he had his Education. In that Po&s;t he continu'd four Years, to the Satisfaction of those who repos'd in him that Tru&s;t, and to the Advantage of those whi were under his In&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="007023_0154_102AEB71F79FA3A8">By this Time, he was determin'd for the Work of the Mini&s;try; and tho' he was well pleas'd with the Bu&s;ine&s;s he was now in, and &s;tood as fair as any Man <HI>whatever,</HI> for a Call &amp; Settlement in any, even the be&s;t Pari&s;h, that might become vacant; yet he prefer'd a <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion</HI> to the <HI>Heathen:</HI> not from any Views he could have of Worldly Advantage from thence, but from a pious, ge|nerous and ardent De&s;ire of being an In&s;trument in the Hand of God of Good to the <HI>Indians,</HI> who were funk below the Dignity of human Nature, and even to the lowe&s;t Degrees of Ignorance and Barbarity.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething very uncommon, and which &s;eems to have been from above, in the Di&s;po&s;i&s;ion and Inclination there was in him to this &s;elf-denying Service: For before there was any Pro&s;pect of his being imploy'd among the <HI>Natives,</HI> his ten|der Mind was &s;o affected with tHe Thot's of their peri&s;hing State, that it had been his Practice, for a long Time, to make it Daily an Article in his &s;ecret Addre&s;&s;es to God, that he would &s;end him to the <HI>Heathen,</HI> and make him an In&s;trument in <HI>turning them from Darkne&s;s to Light</HI> &amp;c. <HI>God granted him that which he reque&s;ted</HI>; for which he return'd his grateful Acknowledgements to <HI>him who beneath Prayer.</HI> And of these Things he inform'd Mr. <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> his Fellow Labourer, at his fir&s;t going to <HI>Hou&s;alunnuk</HI>; but strictly injoin'd him to keep them &s;ecret, which he according did till &s;ince Mr. SERGEANT's Death.</P>
<P>He was Per&s;on to whom Nature prov'd lavi&s;h of her be&s;t Gifts; or, in Words more agreable to the Christian Scheme, God graciou&s;ly be&s;tow'd upon him excellent Endowments, both of Body and Mind. In Stature ha was &s;mall; yet, of a very exact and comely Proportion, except his Hand before mention; his Hair dark; his Eyes black and lively: <HI>He was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful Countenance, and goodly to look to.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1. Sam. xvi. xii.</NOTE> He was favout'd with a firm, healthy and good Con&s;titution, and there|fore pa&s;s's, with the greater Ea&s;e, thro' the many Difficulties and Hard&s;hips that attended him in the Cour&s;e of his <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion.</HI> He was of a mo&s;t &s;weet, kind and benevolent natural Temper; without the lea&s;t Con&s;titutional Turn towards Gloomne&s;s, Melancholy, of Jealou&s;y? His Conver&s;ation open, free, courteous, plea&s;ant and very attractive; &s;o that all, who had the Happine&s;s to enjoy it, were pleas'd and delighted by it. The Powers of
<PB N="150" REF="007023_0155_102AEB73AAADFEB0">
his Mind were bright and &s;trong; whence he was able to u&s;e clo&s;e Application, and with Ea&s;e made great Progre&s;e in Learning: Few of his Years exceeded him.</P>
<P>His natural Accompli&s;hments were poli&s;hed, enlarg'd, and im|proved by a liberal Education; and rendered him de&s;ireable and amiable to all, and very u&s;eful in his Day.</P>
<P>True and undi&s;&s;embled Piety gave Lu&s;tre and Beauty to all his other Endowments, both natural and acquir'd; and prepar'd him to be eminently &s;erviceable in the Station God affign'd him. In his tender Years he was of a very innocent Turn of Mind, and of a blamele&s;s Behaviour; free from tho&s;e Vanities &amp; Vices which young People too often indulge to, and careful to follow the Ways of Virtue: Which might have inclin'd one to think, that he was the Subject of the <HI>Grace of God</HI> from the Womb. But, in his riper Years, while he was at College, he was under tho&s;e In|fluences from above, which he apprehended wrought a <HI>&s;aving Change</HI> in him, and form'd him to the divine Life. And what better Evidence could he have, that he was not mi&s;taken, than what was con&s;equent upon this Change, viz. a Temper &amp; Con|ver&s;ation becoming the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, adorning the Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion he then made? Of this Change, wrought by the Spirit of God upon his Heart, he very mode&s;tly and privately &s;pake to &s;ome of his intimate Friends, from whom I have my Information: But I find not that he left one Word in all his Writings, re&s;pecting his religious Experience, Devotion, &amp;c. except one Pa&s;&s;age in a Letter he wrote to a Friend, by whom he &s;eems to have been compel'd to <HI>boa&s;t him&s;elf a little,</HI> as the <HI>Apo&s;tle of the Gentiles</HI> was before him. The Pa&s;&s;age is this&mdash; <Q>With Re&s;pect to my own Chri&s;tian Experience, I believe, I could give you that Account which would &s;atisfy you, in your own Way of thinking; tho' 'tis now &s;o long &s;ince I pa&s;s'd thro' that Scene of Conviction, Humiliation, and, what I &s;uppos'd was Conver&s;ion, that a great many Particulars are now e&s;caped from my Memory.</Q>&mdash;Some, perhaps, may blame Mr. SERGEANT, that he did not commit to Writing tho&s;e Things which pa&s;t over him at uch a Sea&s;on, that he might have review'd them for his own Comfort, and left them behind him for the Benefit of others. It was owing to his very great Mode&s;ty and Humility, and to his Care not to do any Thing, that might be thought to &s;avour of Oftentation in
<PB N="151" REF="007023_0156_102AEB75ADB13078">
Religion (which is a Thing very hurtful to its Intere&s;t) that he kept tho&s;e Things to him&s;elf. And whether he did not, by that Mode&s;ty, Humility &amp; Guard again&s;t Oftentation, give a clearer Evidence of the Truth of Religion in him&s;elf, and di&s;cover a greater Concern for the Honour and Intere&s;t of Religion in gene|ral, than he could have done, by Writing his own Life, publi&s;hing his own Experiences, and proclaiming his own Goodne&s;s, I leave others to determine? His Life al&s;o &s;o abounded in the Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and was &s;o conform'd to the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, that we have abundant Rea&s;on to conclude the <HI>Tree was goody,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>Fruit was &s;o.</HI></P>
<P>He was very con&s;tant and frequent in the Devotions of the Clo&s;et, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ring out his Soul to God in &s;ervent Addre&s;&s;es of Prayer, Prai&s;e, &amp;c; which he found to be not <HI>in vain</HI>: for, as he him&s;elf tho't, God graciou&s;ly granted him frequent An&s;wers of Prayer.</P>
<P>He was a devout Wor&s;hiper of God in his Family, fail'd not of Morning &amp; Evening Devotions; on which Occa&s;ions he read, with great Seriou&s;ne&s;s and Solemnity of Spirit, a Portion of the holy Scriptures, generally making u&s;eful Observations for the Benefit of his Family. He always read the New Te&s;tament out of the-original <HI>Greek,</HI> with which he was well acquainted. With great Solemnity and Reverence he approach'd the Throne of Grace, and offer'd his devout Addre&s;&s;es to God, in the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Mediator; thro' who&s;e Merits, and Mediation only, he hop'd for, and expected, the Acceptance of his Prayers, and of his Per&s;on. There were In&s;tances of his Voice failing, and of his being oblig'd to make a Pau&s;e in Family Prayer; the Occa&s;ion of which was, a lively Sen&s;e &amp; overbearing Apprehen|&s;ion of the glorious Perfections &amp; incomprehen&s;ible Excellencies of the divine Being, as he inform'd one who enquir'd into the Rea&s;on of tho&s;e Interruptions.</P>
<P>He lov'd the Hou&s;e of God and his publick Wor&s;hip, greatly rejoic'd at the Return of holy Sabbaths, enjoy'd much Com|munion with God in his Hou&s;e, but in no Part of divine Wor&s;hip &s;o much as in the <HI>Communion of the Supper</HI>: in which he had &s;uch evident Communications of divine Love, &s;uch A&s;&s;urance of the compleat Satisfaction of Chri&s;t, of the Sufficiency of his Atone|ment, and of the Prevalency of his Interce&s;&s;ion at the right Hand of God, as almo&s;t tran&s;ported him, The&s;e Emotions were what
<PB N="152" REF="007023_0157_102AEB77A8540538">
attended him in his younger Years, and were not very frequent: But as he advanc'd in Years, and in Grace, he prefer'd the Satis|faction which proceeds from the calm, rational Exerci&s;e of practi|cal Piety and Devotion, to tho&s;e Emotions of the Mind. The&s;e Things he never openly &s;pake of, nor would they ever have been known, had not his mo&s;t intimate Friends, to whom he privately &s;pake of them, made them known, after his Death. Thus he walked with God in devout Exerci&s;es of a publick, private, and &s;ecret Nature, and enjoy'd much Delight and Satisfaction in &s;o doing.</P>
<P>He was of a mo&s;t tender Con&s;cience; endeavour'd to keep at the greate&s;t Di&s;tance from every Thing that &s;avour'd of Impiety, that ca&s;t Contempt upon the Authority of God, or that brought Reproach upon Religion; and us'd his be&s;t Endeavours <HI>to keep a Con&s;cience void of Offence, towards God and towards Men.</HI></P>
<P>He had a very great Love to, and the highe&s;t Veneration for, the &s;acred <HI>Oracles of God</HI>; e&s;teem'd them infinitely preferable to the Trea&s;ures of the World, and incomparably more valuable than the be&s;t human Compo&s;ures: and the Study of them was his great Delight. He view'd, with A&s;toni&s;hment and Surprize, the glorious Methods of divine Love and Grace in the Salvation of Sinners by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> as di&s;cover'd in the BIBLE, that pure Source of Light. And while he formed his own Sentiments by the pure <HI>Oracles of God,</HI> and followed the Way of Truth, according to the be&s;t Judgment he could make, he was of a mo&s;t benevolent and charitable Spirit towards tho&s;e who differ'd from him. He lov'd Chri&s;tians of all Denominations, who gave Evidence of their Love to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> much lamented the Di&s;tance, Alienation, and Bitter|ne&s;s that appear among Chri&s;tians of different Sentiments in le&s;&s;er Matters, and long'd to &s;ee them united in Love and Peace.</P>
<P>His Catholick Temper recommended him to the E&s;teem of many; to <HI>Governour Belcher</HI>'s in particular; who, in a Con&s;ola|tory Letter, written to Mrs. <HI>Sergeant</HI> alter his Death, has this Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P><Q>Mr. SERGEANT being now made free among the Dead, it can be no Flattery to &s;ay, he was a Gentleman of uncommon Piety and Learning, and of great Genero&s;ity and true Com|pa&s;&s;ion to the Souls and Bodies of Men: and more e&s;pecially to that poor benighted People, God had committed to his Care;
<PB N="153" REF="007023_0158_102AEB79EF731070">
and who before were peri&s;hing for lack of Knowledge. God had, to a peculiar Manner, adapted and adorned Mr. SER|GEANT with many &s;uitable Graces for moving in &s;o difficult a Sphere in the Church of God here, and for advancing the Kingdom &amp;Intere&s;t of the Redeemer. His many &s;ocial Vir|tues, and particularly his <HI>Catbolick Way of Thinking</HI> for the better promoting of Chri&s;tianity, ju&s;tly and highly merited my E&s;teem, and I had great Plea&s;ure in his Acquaintance from fir&s;t to la&s;t</Q></P>
<P>He was full of benevolent, kind and generous Sentiments to|wards all Mankind, which di&s;pos'd him to <HI>do Good to all as he had Opportunity.</HI> He was a Friend to every Body, wi&s;h'd well to all, and lov'd to think the be&s;t of all Per&s;ons, and of all Par|ties of Men. His noble and generous Mind di&s;dain'd a low, mean, unworthy Action; and he always treated others, of all Conditions, wjtb great Propriety. Strict and exact Ju&s;tice he made his Rule, an his Dealings with all Per&s;ons: yet rather than Cau&s;e Contention, by in&s;i&s;ting upon his own Right, he choo&s;e to foregoe it. He was compa&s;&s;ionate and tender-hearted to the Afflicted; was liberal and bountiful to tne Poor: and <HI>devi&s;ed liberal Things,</HI> both for their temporal and eternal Good. He &s;uffer'd not an hard, envious or ill-natur'd Word to proceed out of his Mouth; nor did he treat any one, whether pre&s;ent or ab|&s;ent, with In&s;olence or Contempt. He was careful <HI>to &s;peak Evil of no Man</HI>: And when he was injuriou&s;ly treated,, and, as he feared,', maliciou&s;ly a&s;per&s;ed, by others, it did not rai&s;e in him Heat, and Re&s;entment, but rather Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e who us!d him ill. He often &s;aid, he could freely forgive, as he expected to be forgiven of God; could heartily, pray for tho&s;e who had been abu&s;ive &amp; injurious to him: aod he earne&s;tly re|commended to others the Duty of praying for Enemies, as an happy Expedient to promote a Spirit of Love, Kindng&s;s &amp; For|givene&s;s towards them.</P>
<P>He had a mo&s;t happy Command of his Pa&s;&s;ions, and main|tain'd a con&s;tant Calmane&s;s &amp; Sweetne&s;s of Temper: Was never melacholy; yet always fetious: Never fill'd with Mirth; yet always chearful bright and active: And &s;eem'd always have the quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of himfe&s;f.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="007023_0159_102AEB7BCAD8CF48">I know not to whom the Character of <HI>Nathaniel</HI> may, with more Ju&s;tice, be apply'd than to him. <HI>Behold an I&s;raelite indeed in whom is no Guile.</HI> He was very di&s;tant from a cra&s;ty, de&s;igning guileful Spirit; and admir'd by tho&s;e who were mod acquainted with him, on the Account of his fingular Integrity, Sincerity and Uprightne&s;s.</P>
<P>He carefully and indu&s;triou&s;ly improved his Time, and could not (as he was wont to &s;ay) look back upon an Hour lo&s;t, without Unea&s;ine&s;s and Guilt. It was his Manner to ri&s;e early, and, as &s;oon as the Devotions of the Morning were over, he apply'd him&s;elf to Study; in which, being favour'd with a firm Con&s;titution, he was able to bear great Inten&s;ene&s;s and Ap|plication. The Time he found needful for the relaxing of his Mind, &amp; for bodily Exerci&s;e,(both which were nece&s;&s;ary to him) he &s;pent in a Manner which might be&s;t conduce to his own Health; the Benefit of his Family; or the Service of tho&s;e who were under his Care: wi&s;ely and prudently endeavouring, that the Hours in which he refre&s;h'd his labouring Mind might be imploy'd to &s;ome good and laudable Purpo&s;e: <HI>gathering up the Fragments</HI> of his Time, that none of it might <HI>be lo&s;t.</HI> He was indeed an un|common In&s;tance of Labour and Indu&s;try; and by clo&s;e Appli|cation he brought to pa&s;s a great Deal in a little Time; as all would be ready to grant, could they be made &s;en&s;ible how much he did in the few Years he &s;pent with the <HI>Indians</HI>; which I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how, tho' it will be but in a faint and imperfect Manner, in the following Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. He &s;oon became &s;en&s;ible, that the Method he was at fir&s;t oblig'd to u&s;e of in&s;tructing the <HI>Indians</HI> by an Interpreter, would not an&s;wer his End; for it was not only a very &s;low, but al&s;o a very uncertain, Way of communicating to them Things of the greate&s;t Importance. He him&s;elf was not able to know what was delivered to them by the Interpreter, and had Rea&s;on to fear that the Truths, which he endeavour'd to communicate, were not well convey'd to their Minds: for the be&s;t Interpreters that could then be had, did not well under&s;tand the Principles of Religion, nor the Engli&s;h Terms in which Mr. SERGEANT deliver'd them. He therefore tho't it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that he &s;hould learn the <HI>Indian</HI> Language, that he might be more certain what was delivered to them, and make better Progre&s;s in teaching <HI>of them.</HI>
<PB N="155" REF="007023_0160_102AEB7E40B8DC38">
He therefore entered upon the new and difficult Study of their Tongue, and pro&s;ecuted it with utmo&s;t Application. He found it, upon Trial, extreamly difficult to learn, being entirely different from any Language he was acquainted with; and often expre&s;s'd his Fears, that he &s;hould never be able to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of it. He al&s;o tho't it a more difficult Ta&s;k than it would have been to gain the Knowledge of all the learned Languages taught in the Schools. However, in &s;omething le&s;s than three Years, he gain'd &s;o much Knowledge in it, as to be able to pray with the <HI>Indians</HI> in their own Tongue, and to preach to them in the &s;ame, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of an Interpreter; who aided him in the Tran&s;lation of his Sermons. And, in about two Years more, by con&s;tant U&s;e, he obtain'd an exact Pronunciation of their Tongue, tho' very hard to gain: &s;o that the <HI>Indians</HI> were wont to &s;ay, <HI>Our Mini&s;ter &s;peaks our Language better than we our&s;elves cam do.</HI> When Mr. SERGEANT had, by a va&s;t Deal of Labour, made him|&s;elf Ma&s;ter of this <HI>&s;trange Language,</HI> he found it to be a dry, bar|ren and imperfect Dialect, and by no Means &s;ufficient to convey to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Hearers the Knowledge of divine Things: for the <HI>Indians</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eing utter Strangers to Religion, their Language wanted Terms <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xpre&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of divers Things; he was oblig'd therefore to &s;upply that Defect by introducing Engli&s;h Words, &s;uch as Je&s;us, Chri&s;t &amp;c. which, in Time, by frequent U&s;e, the <HI>Indians</HI> well under&s;tood. By this Help he &s;o perfected their defective Language, as to rea|der it tolerably &s;ufficient for his Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. His Mini&s;terial Labours were extreamly hard, more than double to tho&s;e of other Mini&s;ters, in ordinary Ca&s;es. He was oblig'd to compo&s;e four Sermons every Week two for the <HI>English,</HI> and two for the <HI>Indians</HI>; his Congregation con&s;i&s;ting of both.
Tho&s;e he prepar'd for the <HI>Indians,</HI> he fir&s;t wrote at large in Eng|lish, and then tran&s;lated them into the Indian Tongue, as he al&s;o did a Portion of Scripture to be read to the <HI>Indians</HI> on the Sab|bath; and notwith&s;tanding he had &s;o many Sermons to make, they wot well &s;tudiedc excellent Di&s;our&s;es &s;hewing that he was a Workman that needed not to be a&s;hamed.</P>
<P>He had a mo&s;t laborious. Ta&s;k to perform every Lord's-Day. His Manner was to begin the publick Exerci&s;e in the Morning, with a &s;hort pathetic Prayer for a Ble&s;&s;ing on the Word, in both Languages, Then he read a Portion of Scripture, with explana|tory
<PB N="156" REF="007023_0161_102AEB8028670098">
Notes and Ob&s;ervations, on &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages as &s;eem'd mo&s;t to need them, in both. All his publick Prayers &amp; the Communion Service were in both Languages; and it was his &s;teady Practice to preach four Sermons every Lord's Day' two to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and two to the <HI>Indians</HI>; except in the &s;hort Days and cold Sea&s;on of the Winter he preach'd but three, one to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and two to the <HI>Indians.</HI> And be&s;ides all this, it was his con&s;tant Cu&s;tom, in the Summer Sea&s;on, to &s;pend about an Hour with the <HI>Indians,</HI> after divine Service was over in the Afternoon; in&s;tructing, ex|horting, warning and cautioning of them in a free, familiar and pathetic Manner, in their own Tongue. The Indian Language abounding in Gutturals renders the Pronunciation of it a mo&s;t laborious Exerci&s;e to the Lungs: that therefore, with his other &s;xerci&s;es, &s;o exhau&s;ted Mr. SERGEANT's Spirits and Strength, that he was &s;carcely able to &s;peak when they were over.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Tran&s;lation, which, with much Care and Exactne&s;s, Mr' SERGEANT made in His Cour&s;e of Reading the Scriptures to the <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;ingly con&s;ider'd, co&s;t him a va&s;t Deal of Labour; for, endeavouring to lead them into the Knowledge of the Way of Salvation by Chri&s;t, to which they were utter Strangers, He, in his Cour&s;e of reading the Scriptures to them, tran&s;lated tho&s;e Parts of the old Te&s;tament, which appear'd mo&s;t needful for that End, viz. The Account of the Creation, of the Fall of our fir&s;t Parents, of God's calling <HI>Abraham,</HI> of his Dealings with the <HI>Pa|triarchs</HI> and the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> of the Prophe&s;ies concerning the Coming of Chri&s;t, &amp;c. the four Evangeli&s;ts, the Acts of the Apo&s;tles and all the Epi&s;tles, he al&s;o tran&s;lated. A Performance which mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity co&s;t him much Time and Pains.</P>
<P N="4">4. In his publick Di&s;cour&s;es likewi&s;e to the Engli&s;h of his Auditory, he went thro' all the Epi&s;tles, with a labour'd and learned Paraphra&s;e, critical Notes, and u&s;eful Ob&s;ervations: not by the Help of Expo&s;itors, but by a careful Examination of the Original Greek, endeavouring from thence to gain the true Sen&s;e and Meaning of the, Authors df tho&s;e Epi&s;tles. Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> has given me &s;ome of his Sentiments upon Mr. SERGEANT's publick Performances in the following Words. <Q>I think it a great Pity (&s;ays he) that &s;uch learned and well-compo&s;ed Di&s;|cour&s;es &s;hould be of no further Influence and Benefit than they are like to prove, by being delivered to a few People from the

De&s;k. There are a Number of his Sermons very worthy of the Pre&s;s, a Collection of which would, perhaps, be as profi|table as any Di&s;cour&s;es of &s;uch a Nature that are extant: they being correct, and written in a decent, yet familiar Stile. There appears in them not only his un&s;haken Belief of the Truths of the Go&s;pel, but al&s;o his good Judgment &amp; Talent of convey|ing to others, the Importance and Beauty of Religion, They &s;hew him to be an accurate Rea&s;oner, by the Conclu&s;ions drawn from the Propo&s;itions of his Sermons, and the Force there is in them to convince every Hearer, of the Truth. His laboured and learned Paraphra&s;es, &amp; critical Notes on the Epi&s;tles, would (I think) &s;erve equal to, if not beyond any Thing that has ap|peard'd of that Kind, to lead us into the Knowledge of the De|&s;ign and Meaning of the Authors.&mdash;He wrote his Comments with a &s;ingle View to di&s;cover the true Spirit &amp; genuine Sen&s;e of tho&s; epi&s;tolary Writings.&mdash; There are two Rea&s;ons which incline me to wi&s;h they may be made publick; the fir&s;t is the Apprehen&s;ion I have of their being really &s;erviceable to Man|kind: the other is, that it might appear whether he was rightly or groundle&s;sly, &s;u&s;pected of holding Things contrary to found Doctrine.</Q> He al&s;o &s;ays concerning his Sermons in general.&mdash; <Q>His People were not entertain'd with unconnected &amp; undige&s;ted Matter, but with excellent Di&s;cour&s;es.</Q>&mdash; Such Productions, every one will grant, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be the Effect of much Labour and Study.</P>
<P>It is very true, Mr. SERGEANT was no <HI>Bigot,</HI> but of a mo&s;t <HI>generous &amp; catholick</HI> Temper. <HI>Bigottry</HI> was what he had a great Aver&s;ion to; and he was far from the rigged ard nirrow Spirit tho&s;e are of, who confine Salvation to them&s;elves, with tho&s;e who think ju&s;t as they do. It is a Que&s;tion with me, whether his natural Temper was capable of &s;uch Severity: to be &s;ure, as it was cultivated and improv'd by Grace, he was at a great Di&s;tance from it. He tho't him&s;elf very ill-treated and much abus'd by tho&s;e who repre&s;ented him as being un&s;ound in his Principles, and &s;o did tho&s;e who were be&s;t acquainted with him.</P>
<P>But to return.</P>
<P N="5">5. We mu&s;t add to all his foregoing Labours, the daily and con&s;tant Appiication he was oblig'd to u&s;e with the <HI>Indians</HI>; who, being very ignorant, very un&s;table in their Virtue, and very much
<PB N="158" REF="007023_0163_102AEB8427CFBA08">
expos'd to Temptations, wanted Guarding on every Side, which he fail'd not of doing.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Tru&s;t, which the Rev. Mr. <HI>I&s;aac Hollis</HI> repos'd in him, added &s;till more to Mr. SERGEANT's Labour and Care; for it fell upon him to find the twelve Boys, whom Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI> gene|rou&s;ly offer'd to &s;upport, and to per&s;uade them and their Parents to accept the generous Offer. The Care al&s;o of providing a Ma&s;ter to in&s;truct them, and of Victualling &amp; Cloathing of them, lay wholly upon him. In this Tru&s;t he prov'd a faithful Steward of Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI>'s Money; and as he had the whole Care of laying of it out, &s;o he gave him an Account how every Penny was ex|pended, refu&s;ing to take any Reward for his Labour &amp; Trouble; tho' it was offer'd and urg'd by Mr. <HI>Hollis.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. By the foregoing Hi&s;tory it al&s;o appears, that the Impor|tant Affair of the Boarding-School, which lay very near his Heart, imploy'd much of his Time and Tho'ts; and was no &s;mall Ad|dition to his Labour; e&s;pecially in &s;ome of the la&s;t Years of his Life.</P>
<P N="8">8. To all the&s;e we mu&s;t add, the unavoidable Cares and Con|cerns of private Life, which were much increas'd by the Scanti|ne&s;e of his Support; which yet he conducted with &s;ingular Wi&s;|dom, Prudence and Frugality.</P>
<P>View Mr. SERGEANT in this Light; con&s;ider him pro&s;ecuting &s;uch a Variety of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and performing all in the Manner above de&s;crib'd, and mu&s;t we not grant that he was a &s;urpri&s;ing in&s;tance of Labour, Indu&s;try and Faithfulne&s;s, in that great and good Work to which he was call'd?</P>
<P>Could I repre&s;ent Mr. SERGEANT in a true and ju&s;t Light, under the Self-denials, Hard&s;hips, Troubles &amp; Difficulties, which attended him in the Cour&s;e of his Mi&s;&s;ion, it would appear, not only that he pa&s;t thro' many and great Trials, but al&s;o that he bear them all with a Fortitude and Calmne&s;s of Mind, becoming the Chri&s;tian and the Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t; tho', at Times, Things appear'd with &s;uch a dark A&s;pect, that he was almo&s;t overborne wich Griefs and Di&s;couragements.</P>
<P>Every one mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that, to one of &s;o delicate a Make, it mu&s;t be difficult and &s;elf-denying, to leave the College, that Seat of Learning, and other Delights, to dwell in a Wilderne&s;s: To change the polite Society he had been us'd to, for the Con|version

of a Number of Savages, the lowe&s;t of human Kind: To forego the Delicacies of Life, for the bare Nece&s;&s;aries of it.&mdash;But the&s;e were but light Things to him, compared with many other Troubles he met with.</P>
<P>The ill Conduct of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Traders, who us'd many Arts and Devices to di&s;&s;uade the <HI>Indians</HI> from hearkening to him; the unrea&s;onable Jealou&s;ies of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who &s;u&s;pected &s;ome evil De&s;ign again&s;t them, in almo&s;t every Thing that was projected for their Good, gave him un&s;peakable Trouble and Grief: and a va&s;t Deal of Pains he was at, to prevent the Evils, which tho&s;e Things tended to. But that which gave him &s;till greater Trou|ble was, the frequent and unhappy Relap&s;es of &s;ome of the <HI>Indians,</HI> to their former Vices and ill Cu&s;toms, after he had conceived Hopes of their being truly reformed. Some, of whom his Hopes were rais'd, fell again into Drunkenne&s;s; yea, the Lieutenant him|&s;elf, who appear'd &s;o zealous again&s;t that Vice, and &s;eem'd to be firmly fix'd in the Ways of Religion, conducted him&s;elf in a very di&s;orderly Manner, for a Year or two together, being frequently intoxicated, and very trouble&s;ome: But he was afterwards re|cover'd from his Apo&s;tacy; confe&s;s'd his Wickedne&s;s; was re|&s;tor'd to Charity; and walked orderly, to the Day of his Death, which was <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 10. 1751. When Things looked with a fa|vourable A&s;pect, and the Indians appear'd to be &s;eriou&s;ly engag'd in the Ways of Piety and Vertue, it gave him the highe&s;t Plea|&s;ure and Satisfaction; but (to u&s;e his own Expre&s;&s;ion) <Q>Nothing &s;o affected him with Grief and Sorrow, his own Sins exceptcd, as the di&s;orderly and wicked Behaviour of tho&s;e to whom he mini&s;tred.</Q> His Concern on that Account is not to be expre&s;&s;ed: many Days he &s;pent in Fa&s;ting and Prayer, and <HI>Sleep departed from his Eyes,</HI> his tender Heart was almo&s;t broken, and he <HI>forgot to eat his Bread</HI>; and his Eyes <HI>poured out Tears unto God.</HI> But tho' he was &s;o tenderly affected, and concerned for them, yet this was what he did not much di&s;cover to the World; he was al&s;o very far from a repining di&s;contented Spirit in the Ca&s;e; was calm, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and re&s;ign'd to the Will of God: not forgeting that Expre&s;&s;ion of his Lord and Ma&s;ter.&mdash;<HI>Even &s;o Father, for &s;o it &s;eem'd good in thy Sight.</HI></P>
<P>As he, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, had the Trials of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in bearing the <HI>Camber, Burden</HI> &amp; <HI>Strife</HI> of his People, &s;o he was in a good Degree

po&s;&s;e&s;t of the &s;ame excellent Spirit that was upon him. The&s;e are but a Specimen of the Troubles he met with; many others, too many to be here &s;poken of, he pa&s;t thro', during his Mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider Mr. SERGEANT in a relative Capacity, he be|hav'd excellently well in every Relation he &s;u&s;tain'd. From a Principle of Con&s;cience he was very careful to <HI>render to all their Due, Fear to whom Fear, Honour to whom Honour</HI> &amp;c; and his benevolent and truly Chri&s;tian Temper di&s;pos'd him to <HI>do good to all as be bad Opportunity.</HI> He was an able, painful, faithful Mi|ni&s;ter among the People, to whom he &s;tood in the Relation of a Pa&s;tor. He was a mo&s;t tender, kind and obliging Hu&s;band to a Spou&s;e, who well under&s;tood how to receive &s;uch Treatment, and to make an&s;werable Returns: and while divine Providence continued them in that haypy and honourable Relation, they were a &s;hining Example of all that is lovely and beautiful in a married State. He was al&s;o a compa&s;&s;ionate, affectionate and loving Father to his dear Children: unwearied in his Endeavours to in&s;till into their tender Minds a proper Sen&s;e of their Obliga|tions to God; that they might religiou&s;ly remember their Cre|ator in the Days of their Youth. As became a <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> he <HI>rul'd well his own Hou&s;e, having his Children in Subjection with all Gra|vity:</HI> And like <HI>David,</HI> he <HI>walked within his Hou&s;e with a perfect Heart.</HI></P>
<P>The la&s;t Week in <HI>June</HI> 1749, he was taken with a Nervous Fever, attended with a Canker and an Inflamation in his Throat: brought upon him, as &s;ome thought, by exce&s;&s;ive Care, Fatigue and Application to Bu&s;ine&s;s; more than he was able to bear. He calmly, and without any apparent Concern, &s;pake or this as his la&s;r Sickne&s;s; and put &s;ome Things in Order, apprehending it to be &s;o. He was able however to keep about, and preach'd on the following Sabbath, which was the fir&s;t in <HI>July.</HI> In this his la&s;t Sermon to the <HI>Indians,</HI> he let them know, 'that for &s;ome Time pa&s;t he had been apprehen&s;ive that &s;ome heavy Judgment hung over them, becau&s;e of their Wickedne&s;s: That he fear'd that &s;ome of them grew wor&s;e &amp; wor&s;e notwith&s;tanding all that God had done for them, and notwith&s;tanding the Pains he him&s;elf had taken with them for their Good: And that there were many Ways in which God could, and often did, te&s;tify his Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t a &s;inful People: and added, it may be God will take me

from you, and then my Mouth will be &s;hut, and I &s;hall &s;peak to you no more.' After this his Illne&s;s increas'd upon him, and &s;oon confin'd him to his Hou&s;e and to his Bed. And tho' his Sick|ne&s;s was very hard upon him, and he endur'd much Pain and Di&s;tre&s;s for about twenty Days together, in all which Time he had but very little Sleep; yet his Head was free from any Di&s;order, and even from Pain: and he &s;pake of it to his Wife, with Thank|fulne&s;s, that God had an&s;wered his Prayers, even to his De&s;ire; in continuing to him the free Exerci&s;e of his rational Powers; in favouring him with clear Evidences of his good E&s;tate; in granting him Ability to &s;peak freely to tho&s;e who were about him; and in enabling him clearly to di&s;cern the great and inex|pre&s;&s;ible Satisfaction ari&s;ing from living devoted to God, and &s;in|cerely &s;triving to be faithful to the Death.</P>
<P>He carefully improv'd the Opportunities he had in coun&s;eling and charging tho&s;e who were about him; and earne&s;tly recom|menced to them the early Choice and diligent Pur&s;uit of the Ways of Wi&s;dom, as being full of Plea&s;ure and Peace, both in Life and Death, to tho&s;e who follow them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians,</HI> who from fir&s;t to la&s;t had a great Veneration and hearty Affection for him, as their Father and be&s;t Friend, were greatly concern'd for, and frequently vi&s;ited him in, his Sickne&s;s: upon whom he enforced the In&s;tructions, Coun&s;els, Warnings and Admonitions he had given them, in the &s;tronge&s;t Manner, charging them carefully to follow the Ways of Vertue and Reli|gion, as they would meet him at la&s;t in Peace. They were very de&s;irous that his precious Life might be &s;par'd, and of their own Accord all a&s;&s;embled at the Meeting-Hou&s;e, where they earne&s;tly pray'd that God would continue him to be &s;till a Ble&s;&s;ing to them. And when his Death put an End to their Hopes, they were very hearty Mourners: and Numbers di&s;cover'd their Affection for him by Tears, when ever they came to the Hou&s;e, for a long time after his Death.</P>
<P>He bear with great Patience the Di&s;tre&s;s that was upon him, thro' the whole of his Sickne&s;s, praying and endeavouring that <HI>Patience</HI> might <HI>have its perfect Work</HI> in him.</P>
<P>His Spou&s;e, who maintain'd Hopes of his Recovery, till the la&s;t Day of his Life, being then &s;en&s;ible that he drew near his End, enquir'd of him, Whether he had no earne&s;t De&s;ires to live?
<PB N="162" REF="007023_0167_102AEB8B98DAE658">
And whether he &s;aw any Gloom on the Horrors on the Grave? To which he reply'd to this Purpo&s;e. 'If it be the Will of God that I &s;hould live to do &s;ome &s;ingular Service for him in the World, I could wi&s;h to be continued to my Family; otherwi&s;e I am willing to die: Death is no Surprize to me. I ble&s;s God I may and can tru&s;t him in whom <HI>I have believed,</HI> and long ago plac'd my everla&s;ting Dependance upon. My Acquaintance with the ble&s;&s;ed World, to which I hope I am now ha&s;tening, thro' the Mercy of God in Chri&s;t, is not now to commence.' At the &s;ame Time, he was full of a humbling Sen&s;e of his own Unworthine&s;s: for when One that &s;tood by ob&s;erv'd to him, that his Work was well done, he reply'd, 'I can call my&s;elf a mo&s;t <HI>unprofitable Ser|vant,</HI> and &s;ay, <HI>God be merciful to me a Sinner.</HI>'</P>
<P>He took his Leave of his beloved Wife and dear Children in an endearing and de&s;ireable Manner; and after &s;aying a con&s;ide|rable Deal, by Way of Coun&s;el and Advice, he in a tender Man|ner de&s;ir'd his dear Spou&s;e, patiently and quietly to &s;ubmit to the parting Stroke; to go on with good Courage in the Way of Duty; and added, 'It will be but a little While before we &s;hall meet to part no more'</P>
<P>La&s;t of all, he devoutly recommended his departing Soul to Chri&s;t, the glorious Redeemer; and, after a few &s;aint Groans, re&s;ted from his <HI>Labours, and his Works do follow</HI> him.</P>
<P>This &s;olemn, awful and la&s;t Scene of Life, Mr; SERGEANT, to Appearance, pa&s;t thro', With as much Calmne&s;s, Sedatene&s;s and Compo&s;ure of Mind, as he ever enjoy'd in his Life; and with a &s;erene and plea&s;ant Countenance; which (as the la&s;t Act) Death <HI>changed and &s;ent him away.</HI> The weeping Spectators of the&s;e Things beheld them with Admiration, and acknowledged they had not before &s;een the like: And one of them ob&s;erv'd, that it was worth While to die, if it might be in &s;uch a Manner.</P>
<P>He left behind him a mo&s;t di&s;con&s;olate and &s;orrowful Widow, with three &s;mall Children, the elde&s;t about 8 or 9 Years old, and the younge&s;t upon the Brea&s;t, on whom the Countenance of his Father is drawn to the Life. God grant they may all inherit his Excellencies and Vertues.</P>

<HEAD>The Conclu&s;ion, in an Addre&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_I Shall now conclude by endeavouring to repre&s;ent, to the People in this Country, the very great Importance of Treating the <HI>Indians,</HI> who live among us, and upon our Borders, in a ju&s;t, kind and charitable Manner; and that we do, by all proper Means and Methods, endeavour to at|tach them to us, and to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t. This, I apprehend, is a Subject that has been too much neglected, and that greatly wants to be &s;et in a clear and ju&s;t Light. And I &s;incerely wi&s;h, that &s;ome Gentleman of greater Abilities and Addre&s;s than I can pretend to, would take it in Hand: Tho', if my weak Endeavours may be a Means of moving others to do Ju&s;tice to a Subject of &s;uch Weight, I &s;hall heartily rejoice in it.</P>
<P>That I may offer what I have to &s;ay, in the cleare&s;t and mo&s;t conci&s;e Manner I can, I &s;hall go into the following Method.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, that it is of va&s;t Importance to the <HI>Briti&s;h Provinces</HI> and <HI>Colonies</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> e&s;pecially to the <HI>Provinces</HI> of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, New-York,</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> that they be in good Terms with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and attach them to their Intere&s;t. And,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how, by what <HI>Means,</HI> this may be effected: or what are the mo&s;t likely Methods to bring it to pa&s;s.</P>
<P N="1">1. I am to &s;how, that it is of va&s;t Importance, that we be in good Terms with the <HI>Natives</HI>; and that we ingage them in our Intere&s;t, I freely grant, that the <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;imply con&s;ider'd, are not of &s;uch great Con&s;equence to us. We can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without them. But yet, their Trade is a con&s;iderable Article, worthy the Care of any politick People, and managed as it might, and ought to be, would yield us great Profit. But if we con&s;ider them with Relation to <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>War,</HI> as attach'd to us, or to our <HI>Enemies,</HI> they are of the la&s;t Importance to us: for they certainly have the Balance of Power in their Hand, and are able to turn it for or

again&s;t us, according as they &s;tand affected to us. <HI>Canada,</HI> in|con&s;iderable as it is, and from which, &s;eperate from the <HI>Indians,</HI> we have little or nothing to fear, in Time of War; <HI>Canada,</HI> I &s;ay, would be more than a Match for us, in Ca&s;e they join with them again&s;t us. He mu&s;t be a great Stranger to, and very ig|norant of, the Circum&s;tances both of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> who is not &s;en&s;ible of this. Our Circum&s;tances are &s;uch, that we can|not guard our&s;elves again&s;t the Incur&s;ions of &s;uch Enemies in Time of War: for our <HI>Frontiers</HI> are of va&s;t extent, and border upon the adjacent Wilderne&s;s; which, tho' almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible to us, yet is the very Element in which they delight to live. They are at Home in it. The People therefore who inhabit our Fron|tiers, while they follow their nece&s;&s;ary Bu&s;ine&s;s, are expos'd to be an ea&s;y Prey to them: and many of them have been &s;urpriz'd in their Fields and Hou&s;es. and in a mo&s;t barbarous Manner put to Death, A &s;mall Number of <HI>Indians,</HI> encouraged &amp; &s;upported by the <HI>French</HI> (which they are ready enough to do) can ea&s;ily keep us in a con&s;tant Alarm, put us to an immen&s;e Charge, de|&s;troy many, and impoveri&s;h more, in our expos'd Places, and not put them&s;elves at all out of their Way; yea, find their Account in it: for as they live by Hunting, &s;o where Game is mo&s;t plenty they are be&s;t off: And where can they find a better Supply, than among our Cattle, Sheep, and Corn-Fields? There they live at Ea&s;e, di&s;tre&s;s and impoveri&s;h us, and the adjacent Wilder|ne&s;s is their Refuge. By retiring into it, they are &s;oon out of our Reach; and long Experience has taught us, how ineffectual the Mea&s;ures we have taken, for our Safety and Defence, have prov'd.</P>
<P>Some, I am &s;en&s;ible, will &s;ay, let us not be at any Co&s;t and Pains to gain the Friend&s;hip of &s;uch a perfidious Crew, but let us de&s;troy them all. Quickly &s;aid indeed, but not &s;o &s;oon nor &s;o ea&s;ily effected. Tho&s;e Per&s;ons who are for de&s;troying them would doubtle&s;s &s;oon do it, where they fir&s;t bound and delivered up to them. But one Que&s;tion here is, how we &s;hall get them into our Power? And another is, Whether it would be &s;o human, generous and Chri&s;tian-like, to take away their Lives, were that in our Power, as it would be to cultivate Friend&s;hip with them, and to &s;eek their be&s;t Good? If we &s;hould be &s;o &s;anguine as to endeavour to de&s;troy them, it would doubtle&s;s prove a vain At|tempt;

and &s;erve only to drive them to the <HI>French</HI>; who would be very ready to receive and protect them. If we neglect them, and take no Mea&s;ures to ingage them in our Intere&s;t, or to culti|vate Friend&s;hip with them, this will probably render them indif|ferent to us, and di&s;po&s;e them to hearken to the enticing In&s;inu|ations of <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Emi&s;&s;aries: and our Situation mu&s;t be very unhappy, when they become engaged in the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>If it be objected, that the <HI>French</HI> have already gain'd a large Number of <HI>Indians</HI> to their Intere&s;t, and therefore if we u&s;e our be&s;t Endeavours to gain others, it will avail nothing; for tho&s;e who are devoted to the <HI>French,</HI> will neverthele&s;s di&s;tre&s;s us in Time of War. I reply,</P>
<P>It is very true, that the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Canada,</HI> thro' their Policy and Vigilance, have taken the Advantage of our Neglect, and gain'd a large Number of the <HI>Natives</HI> to their Intere&s;t, and are gaining more and more every Year; and &s;ome even from among our own <HI>Indians.</HI> They &s;pare neither Co&s;t nor Pains to accompli&s;h their De&s;igns of this Nature; being &s;en&s;ible enough, how advan|tageous it is to them, and how injurious to us: and if they con|tinue to be active, and we negligent, as in Times pa&s;t, is it not too probable that they will, in a little Time, attach to them&s;elves all the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>North-America?</HI> Does it not then concern us to u&s;e proper and vigorous Endeavours to prevent this apparent Mi&s;chief, by counter-working the <HI>French?</HI> who are, I &s;uppo&s;e, tampering with all the Tribes of <HI>North-America,</HI> to ingage them in their Intere&s;t. And &s;hould we &s;ucceed in our Endeavours (as it is highly probable we might, if proper Steps were taken) &s;o as to ingage the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and &s;ome other Tribes, in hearty Friend|ship with us; and e&s;pecially if we &s;hould be&s;tow &s;uch Favours upon them, as would induce them to &s;ettle upon our Frontiers; it would in all Probability prevent the Evil &s;poken of in the Ob|jection: for the <HI>Indians</HI> from <HI>Canada</HI> would not mole&s;t us, if a Number of the Natives, in hearty Friend&s;hip with us, were placed in our Borders. Of this we have had a very plain Proof the la&s;t War, in the Safety of <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> and the adjacent Places, from any Attempts of the Enemy from <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Stockbridge</HI> is in the very Road of, and more expos'd to, the <HI>Indians</HI> from <HI>Canada,</HI> than any other Place whatever; and yet we &s;ee that the Enemy turned off Ea&s;t to <HI>Connecticut-River,</HI> and
<PB N="167" REF="007023_0172_102AEB9590509708">
We&s;t to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Settlements, where they did much Mi&s;chief; while <HI>Stockbridge, Sheffield, New-Marlborough</HI> and <HI>Number One,</HI> tho' more expos'd, were not mole&s;ted. This &s;o far as we can di&s;cern, was owing to a &s;mall Number of <HI>Indians</HI> dwelling at <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> who are our hearty and fa&s;t Friends: which the Ene|my being &s;en&s;ible of, cared not to come within their Reach, lea&s;t they &s;hould be taken in their own Snare. And if we &s;hould en|courage the Settlement of other Indian Towns upon our Frontiers, where Hunting is mo&s;t handy to them, as <HI>Stockbridge</HI> has been encouraged: &s;hould we give them Town&s;hips of Land &s;uitable for their Improvement, build a Meeting-Hou&s;e &amp; School-Hou&s;e in each Town, and &s;upport Mini&s;ters and School Ma&s;ters in them; would not this convince them that we are their true Friends, and &s;eek their Good? Would it not induce them to &s;et|tle in our Borders? e&s;pecially tho&s;e of them who are de&s;irous, that they them&s;elves &amp; their Children &s;hould be in&s;tructed? Would they not be a Guard to us in Time of War? And if, after all, we &s;hould meet with &s;ome Trouble from the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Canada,</HI> might it not be effectually prevented, by playing our <HI>Indians</HI> upon them, as they do theirs upon us? And would not the Charge of all this be a Trifle, compar'd with that of defending our&s;elves in Time of War? But if we neglect them, and take no Mea&s;ures to cultivate Friend&s;hip with them, and e&s;pecially if we deal injuriou&s;ly by them, &s;hall we not put an Advantage into the Hands of the <HI>French</HI> (which they will not fail of improving) to engage them in their Intere&s;t, and to imploy them again&s;t us in Time of War? which would prove a very great Calamity to us, if not our utter Ruin. The&s;e Things con&s;ider'd, is it not of very great Importance, that we be at good Terms with the neigh|bouring <HI>Natives.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. I will, in the next Place, endeavour to &s;how what are the likely <HI>Methods</HI> to bring this to pa&s;s: Or what Mea&s;ures we mu&s;t take with the <HI>Indians,</HI> if we would ingage them in hearty Friend|&s;hip with us.</P>
<P>And here, in general, our Conduct towards them mu&s;t be &s;uch as &s;hall make them &s;en&s;ible, that we are indeed their hearty Friends; and &s;uch al&s;o as &s;hall convince them that it is their Intere&s;t and Advantage to be in Friend&s;hip with us. Nothing &s;hort of this, I apprehend, will attach them to us, &s;o as to an|&s;wer
<PB N="168" REF="007023_0173_102AEB97919E1DD8">
the Ends propo&s;ed, if we oft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> treat with them, renew the Friend&s;hip, and be&s;tow upon them large Pre&s;ents: Or, as they phra&s;e it, Smoke together, brighten the Chain, or put the Brands together, to kindle up the former Fire; and yet leave Room for them to &s;uppo&s;e that this proceeds not from true Friend&s;hip, but rather from Fear of them, or from Su&s;picion that they will join with our Enemies, &amp;c. This will never be &s;ufficient to engage them: the utmo&s;t we can rationally expect from it is. that they will not openly break with us, but keep up a Shew of Friend&s;hip, that they may have the Benefit of future Pre&s;ents at our Hands.</P>
<P>Again, if we &s;hould by any Means convince them that we are their true Friends, and yet not go into &s;uch Mea&s;ures with them as &s;hould turn to their <HI>Advantage,</HI> they would hardly be engag'd for us. As all other People are govern'd by <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> &s;o are they. And the principal Handle we can take hold of, to attach them to us by, is their <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> and that would not fail of doing of it. If a Tribe of <HI>Indians</HI> can &s;ell their Skins to us for <HI>twenty Shillings,</HI> and buy their Blankets for <HI>ten Shillings</HI>; they will never go to <HI>Canada</HI> where they mu&s;t &s;ell their Skins for <HI>ten Shillings,</HI> and give <HI>twenty Shillings</HI> for a Blanket. Convince them that it is much for their Intere&s;t and Advantage to be our Friends and Allies, and we need not fear but that they will be &s;o. Now, in Order to convince them that we are truly their Friends, and that it is their Intere&s;t to be ours; We mu&s;t,</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, treat them according to the Rules of Equity and Ju&s;tice. We mu&s;t not defraud and oppre&s;s them, but be hone&s;t and ju&s;t in our Dealings with them.</P>
<P>The Natives with whom we have to do, are Per&s;ons of &s;o much Sagacity that they can di&s;tingui&s;h between ju&s;t and injurious Treatment, as well as other Men. They are al&s;o as ready to re|&s;ent, and perhaps more forward to revenge Injuries, than any other People under Heaven. If therefore we treat them in an unju&s;t Manner, we may rationally expect that they will be &s;o far from being our Friends, that they will join with our Enemies, and &s;eek Opportunities of Revenge.</P>
<P>It is well known, that the <HI>Indians</HI> are generally addicted to Drunkenne&s;s, and that when they have ta&s;ted a little Liquor, they have a &s;trong Thir&s;t for more, and will part with any Thing they have, for a &s;ufficient Quantity to make them Drunk.&mdash;And is
<PB N="169" REF="007023_0174_102AEB99D9E10000">
it not as well known, that we have taken the Advantage of this their vicious Appetite, and for a &s;ew Quarts of Rum have pur|chas'd valuable &s;cffects of them? Have not private Per&s;ons thus made their Gains of them, notwith&s;tanding the good Laws that have been in Force to prevent it? And is not this the Manner of all private Traders, who go among their &s;everal Tribes for Gain?</P>
<P>In our publick Dealings with them at our Truck-Hou&s;es, where Rum has been freely &s;old them. Care has been taken that they &s;hould not be cheated, but that they &s;hould have the full Value of what they had to &s;ell: An Indian therefore, who was Owner of a Pack of Bever, Deer&s;kins, or any other valuable Goods, could buy a large Quantity of Rum, and might get Drunk perhaps ten Times or more, whereas if he had fallen into private Hands, he mu&s;t have contented him&s;elf with being Drunk but once or twice. Which of the&s;e proves mo&s;t injurious to the <HI>Indians</HI> in the End, I &s;hall not pretend to determine.</P>
<P>When they are thus intoxicated, they fall out among them|&s;elves, Fight, and &s;ometimes kill one another, and &s;ome have drunk them&s;elves dead on the Spot. An In&s;tance of each of the&s;e there has been, if I am rightly inform'd, at <HI>Fort Dummer,</HI> &s;ince that has been improv'd as a Truck-Hou&s;e. And whether the Guilt of that Blood does not lie upon us, I leave others to judge.</P>
<P>Now, if we treat the <HI>Natives</HI> in this Form, will they, can they, live with us? Will not the Law of Self-Pre&s;ervation oblige them to leave us, and to go where they may be better us'd? Some of the Five Nations plainly &s;peak it out and &s;ay, "We can|not live with the <HI>Engli&s;h &amp; Dutch</HI>; they bring us &s;o much Rum that it de&s;troys us; we mu&s;t go to the <HI>French,</HI> who will let us have but little &s;trong Drink." Thus we alienate the <HI>Indians</HI> from us, and as it were oblige them to go over to the <HI>French,</HI> who are often our Enemies, and fail not to imploy them againft us in Time of War. And if we proceed to deal thus injuriou&s;ly with them, what can we expert but that they will leave us, and be a &s;evere Scourge to us?</P>
<P>Tho' the <HI>Indians</HI> are &s;unk below the Dignity of human Nature, and their Lu&s;t after Drink expo&s;es them to be cheated out of what little they have; yet this gives us no Right to deal unju&s;tiy by them. They have a natural Right to Ju&s;tice, and may, with
<PB N="170" REF="007023_0175_102AEB9BEFA17370">
great Propriety challenge it at our Hand, &s;eeing we pro&s;e&s;s to be &s;ubject to the Law of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which teach us to do <HI>that which is altogether just.</HI> And we &s;hould be &s;o far from taking the Ad|vantage of their Ignorance, Vice and Poverty, to defraud them of what is their ju&s;t Right, that we &s;hould rather be mov'd to Pity, and compa&s;&s;ionate their deplorable State, and be <HI>Eyes to the Blind,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I am fully per&s;uaded, that if we were upright and ju&s;t in all our Tran&s;ations with them; if our Trade with them were put into the Hands of faithful Men, who would deal ju&s;tly by them; and if they were &s;upply'd with all Nece&s;&s;aries for them&s;elves and Families at a moderate Price, it would not be in the Power of all the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Canada</HI> (&s;ubtil as they are) to alienate them from us. The <HI>French</HI> are not upon equal Ground with us in this Affair. For their Nothern Climate is much more inho&s;pitable &amp; &s;evere than ours is: Their Country is not &s;o productive of tho&s;e Fruits, which the <HI>Indians</HI> very much live upon, as ours: Nor can they afford Goods which arc proper and nece&s;&s;ary for the <HI>Indians</HI> at &s;o cheap a Lay as we can: Therefore we can give them tho&s;e Advantages which <HI>Canada</HI> cannot. We can, with|out Damage to our&s;elves, make it their Intere&s;t to adhere to us: And when Experience has once taught them, that their Intere&s;t lies with us, they will want no other Inducement to ingage them to us: Yea, it will not only attach tho&s;e or them to us, who are not yet gone to <HI>Canada,</HI> but it will induce tho&s;e who are, to re|turn to their Brethren, for the &s;ake of the Profit they might reap by it; e&s;pecialliy if we give them all the Advantage we can, con&s;i&s;tent with our own.</P>
<P>As unju&s;t &amp; abu&s;ive Treatment of the <HI>Indians</HI> tends naturally to alienate them from us, and to turn them off to the <HI>French</HI>; &s;o a Series of ju&s;t and faithful Dealing with them would be like|ly to attach them to us, and to make them our fa&s;t Friends. This again appears from the Temper and Conduct of that Part of the <HI>Tribe</HI> of the <HI>River Indians</HI> who live at <HI>Stockbridge.</HI> For tho' they were, for a con&s;iderable Time, extreamly jealous, that we had &s;ome ill De&s;ign upon them, even in the Favours they received at our Hands; (a Jealou&s;y founded, I &s;uppo&s;e, upon the ill U&s;age the <HI>Natives</HI> have too often been the Subjects of) yet by the ju&s;t Treatment they, for a Cour&s;e of Years, have met with, from the
<PB N="171" REF="007023_0176_102AEB9DEFED5D08">
<HI>Government,</HI> from Mr. <HI>Sargeant,</HI> Mr. <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> and others, they are become our hearty Friends; willing to live or die with us, whether in Peace or War.</P>
<P>It is very true, that in order to obtain the End propos'd, our Trade with the <HI>Indians</HI> muft not be in private Hands. It mud not be in the Power of every private Per&s;on to treat them as he plea&s;es. We may upon good Grounds de&s;pair of their being treated with Equity and Ju&s;tice, if every one may gratify his avaricious Temper in dealing with them. Our Trade therefore mu&s;t be of a publick Nature, and muft be committed to the Care and Management of faithful Men: Not to &s;uch as will &s;eek the Service, and make Friends to procure the Po&s;t for them; (certain Indications of a Self-&s;eeker) but Men of Uprightne&s;s &amp; Integrity mu&s;t be &s;ought out, &s;uch and &s;uch only mu&s;t be be tru&s;ted with Bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;uch Importance: Good In&s;tructions mu&s;t be given them, which mu&s;t be carefully adher'd to.</P>
<P>If the Indian Trade at <HI>Canada</HI> were in private Hands; if every private Per&s;on there might deal with the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> we might then hope that tho&s;e who are gone from us would &s;oon re|turn: for, in that Ca&s;e, it is &s;uppo&s;able enough that they would not meet with much better U&s;age there, than they do here: tho' it is &s;carcely &s;uppo&s;able that they would meet with much wor&s;e. The <HI>French</HI> Trade with the <HI>Indians</HI> is wholly in the Hand of publick Officers, (if I am rightly informed) and a private Man, if he want a Dear-&s;kin, a Beaver-&s;kin, &amp;c. is not allow'd to pur|cha&s;e of an <HI>Indian,</HI> but muft go to the publick Stores. Upon the Suppo&s;ition that tho&s;e Officers are faithful, and deal ju&s;tly by the <HI>Indians,</HI> it is &s;urely a wife &amp; politick Method to ingage them in their Favour. And &s;o long as every private Per&s;on in the Engli&s;h Government is at Liberty to trade with them, when, and where, he plea&s;es, and to cheat them out of what they have, what can we expect but that they will repair to <HI>Canada</HI> where they may be better us'd? Is it not owing to the ill Treatment they have met with from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> that &s;o many of them are gone already? And if no proper Mea&s;ures are taken to prevent their being ill us'd, will not tho&s;e who are yet behind &s;oon fol|low their Brethren? Yea, if we &s;urni&s;h them with large Quan|tities of Rum, make them Drunk, and then defraud them of what they have, do we not reduce them to a Nece&s;&s;ity, either of living
<PB N="172" REF="007023_0177_102AEB9FDE0A1040">
low and mi&s;erable with us, or of going from us, that they may &s;are better? How low, how di&s;pirited, how mi&s;erable &amp; bruti&s;h the&s;e few are, who live within our Borders, is too manife&s;t. And whether we, by our ill treating of them, have not contributed to their Mi&s;ery, is worthy of our &s;erious Enquiry. Yea, would it not be proper for us to enquire, Whether we have not, by our Neglect &amp; Abu&s;e of them, provoked Heaven to let loo&s;e the Natives upon us, who have been one of the fore&s;t Scourges that we were ever cha&s;ti&s;ed with? What Multitudes have they, in a mo&s;t cruel Manner, murdered in our Borders? How many of our Neigh|bours have they led into Captivity? Some of whom have been redeem'd at a very great Expence, and others are become either Pagans or Papi&s;ts, and continue &s;till in a foreign Land. And who can count the Co&s;t we have been at, to defend our&s;elves again&s;t their Incur&s;ions?</P>
<P>If the Briti&s;h Government &s;hould be difpos'd, in Time to come, to &s;et up and maintain a publick, hone&s;t and ju&s;t Trade with the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> or any other Tribes, thereby to attach them to ui, to promote their true Intere&s;t, with other valuable Ends that might there by be an&s;wer'd: This Objection perhaps would ari&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> That &s;uch a Proceeding will be a very great Expence to the Publick, for our Trade cannot be &s;afe unle&s;s it be protected by a con&s;iderable Force. A Fort muft be built, and a Garri&s;on of 50, 60 or perhaps 100 Men, with their proper Officers, mu&s;t be maintain'd at each Place where the Trade is &s;et up: therefore the Advantage would not countervail the Co&s;t. To this I reply,</P>
<P>If &s;uch Garri&s;ons fhould be tho't nece&s;&s;ary in the Places where a Trade is &s;et up, to be a Guard to it; the Charge would nothing like equal that of an Indian War, which perhaps it might prevent.</P>
<P>But further, I apprehend that the Charge of fuch Garri&s;ons might be &s;par'd and that, in in&s;tead of being nece&s;&s;ary, they would prove very injurious to the De&s;ign; and that it would be a very wrong Step to be taken in that Affair.</P>
<P>All who are in any good Mea&s;ure acquainted with the <HI>Indians</HI> know, that they are extreamly jealous, lea&s;t any Incroachments &s;hould be made upon them: and it is not &s;trange it &s;hould be &s;o, con&s;idering what has pa&s;t over them. And if a Number of arm'd Men were placed among them, and Forts built for the Defence of our Trade, they would be Su&s;picious, that &s;omething ho&s;tile
<PB N="173" REF="007023_0178_102AEBA1CB9A7D50">
was intended, and we &s;hould not be able to remove the Su&s;picion. They would behold us with, a jealous Eye, and perhaps take Mea&s;ures to fru&s;trate the whole De&s;ign.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t effectual Way to induce them to tru&s;t us, is to tru&s;t them: and they will be ready enough to protect our Trade, if we de&s;ire it, and &s;how that we confide in them to do it. And when a little Experience has taught them, how advantageous &s;uch a Trade would be to them, they would be ready enough to do it, for their own Advantage. It therefore we &s;hould de&s;ire them to admit a Trader into one of their own Forts, or to build a Fort at our Charge in &s;ome convenient Place for &s;uch a Defign, and to take Care that our Trade be &s;afe; this would tend to convince them, both of our Friend&s;hip to, and of our Con|fidence in, them; and they would not only be pleas'd with it, but al&s;o ambitious to &s;how us that we may &s;afely tru&s;t them: And were I to be the Truck-Ma&s;ter, I &s;houid e&s;teem my &s;elf much later in their Protection, than in a Garri&s;on of 100 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men: For if &s;uch a Gari&s;on &s;hould be placed among them, they them&s;elves would &s;u&s;pect &s;ome ill De&s;ign carrying on again&s;t them, and the <HI>French</HI> would infallibly tell them, that tho' we pretended Peace and Friend&s;hip, yet our De&s;ign in the End is to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them of their <HI>Country.</HI></P>
<P>If indeed a Truck Ma&s;ter &s;hould prove an unfaithful Servant, and inrich him&s;elf by defrauding them, he might have Qcca&s;ion for Engli&s;h Soldiers to protect him and his Stores: but if they found him faithful, friendly and ju&s;t in his Dealings with them, they would be as careful of him as of their own Eyes, and ven|ture their own Lives for him. What would not the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Stockbridge</HI> have done for Mr. <HI>Sergeant</HI> in his Day, whom they had found to be their true and hearty Friend? And what would they not now do for Mr. <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> of whom they have had the like Experience? <HI>Indians</HI> will be as ready as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and perhaps much more &s;o, to &s;erve and protect, if there be Occa&s;ion, tho&s;e whom they have found to be their faithful and real Friends.</P>
<P>in a Word, I apprehend, that if we had in Times pa&s;t treated the Natives according to the Rules of Equity &amp; ju&s;tice, it would have been quite &s;ufficient to have ingaged them in our Intere&s;t, and to have kept them in Amity and Friendship with us. And that, even now, they might in a little Time be attach'd to
<PB N="174" REF="007023_0179_102AEBA3B1AB7FF8">
us, by &s;uch Treatment: But this, I confe&s;s, I de&s;pair of, if every private Per&s;on mu&s;t be left at his Liberty to treat them as he plea&s;es, and to defraud them of all they have: which I take to be the Ca&s;e in <HI>New-York</HI> Government, who lie next to the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and have their Trade; tho' in this <HI>Province</HI> we have good Laws in Force to re&s;train private Per&s;ons from &s;elling them &s;trong Drink.</P>
<P N="2">2. We &s;hould al&s;o exerci&s;e that Kindne&s;s and Genero&s;ity to|wards them, that &s;hall convince them that it is for their Intere&s;t to be in Friend&s;hip with us. We &s;hould not, in a Ca&s;e of &s;uch Importance, content our&s;elves with being bearly ju&s;t in our Treat|ment of them, but we &s;hould al&s;o be kind &amp; generous, as a proper Expedient to obtain the End propos'd. I am aware, I &s;hall here be quick interrupted with this Exclamation.</P>
<P>What! <HI>kind</HI> and <HI>generous</HI> to &s;uch an ungrateful evil Crew! to which I &s;hall only an&s;wer. We have good Authority for being <HI>kind to the Unthankful and to the Evil.</HI> And if that good Being who recommends it to us, had not given an Example of it, in his Dealings with us, how deplorable had our State been? This kind Temper and Behaviour is recommended to us in the Go&s;|pel, not only becau&s;e it is the Will of our heavenly Father that we &s;hould be kind, but al&s;o becau&s;e the Exerci&s;e of it an&s;wers excellent Ends; produces very good &amp; de&s;ireable Effects: &s;uch as Love, Friend&s;hip, Peace, &amp;c. And while we make a Profe&s;|&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, it is Pity the Practice of it, in &s;o material an Article, &s;hould be objected again&s;t. And is it not very proper that we &s;hould exerci&s;e Kindne&s;s and Genero&s;ity to the poor Na|tives, when there is a &s;trong Probability of its being of very hap|py Con&s;equence both to them and us?</P>
<P>A great deal of Kindne&s;s and Genero&s;ity has been exercis'd towards the River <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> by this <HI>Government,</HI> by the honourable <HI>Corporation</HI> at Home, by their honourable &amp; Rev. <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> by the Rev.

were a Means, in the Hand of Providence, of covering our mo&s;t We&s;tern Frontiers the la&s;t War. And were the like Kindne&s;s &s;hown by us to other Tribes, is there not Room to hope that the Effects might be alike happy? If Town&s;hips &s;uitable for <HI>Indians</HI> to &s;ettle in, were provided in our Frontiers, and it were propos'd to them that if they would come and &s;ettle in them, they &s;hould not only enjoy the Land as their own, but al&s;o have a Mini&s;ter &s;upported among them to in&s;truct them in the Chri&s;tian Religion; and al&s;o a School-Ma&s;ter to teach their Children to read &amp; write; would not this induce many of them, e&s;pecially of the better Sort, to come and &s;ettle in our Borders? And would they not cover our Frontiers in Ca&s;e of a War with <HI>Frace</HI>?</P>
<P>What has been done for the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Stockbridge</HI> has doubtle&s;s been much ob&s;erv'd, and approv'd of, by the <HI>Natives</HI> far &amp; near. That there is a School &s;et up at <HI>Canada,</HI> in Imitation of Mr. <HI>Ser|geant</HI>'s School at <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> and a large Number of Scholars in it, we have heard and receive for Truth. That the <HI>French,</HI> who e&s;teem Ignorance to be the Mother of Devotion, and do not de|&s;ire to teach the <HI>Indians</HI> any Thing more than to &s;ay their Beads, and to cro&s;s them&s;elves, have done this out of Choice, is not at all likely. They do not de&s;ire that their <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hould become a knowing People. But yet, being &s;en&s;ible that the Report of Mr. <HI>Sergeant</HI>'s School had &s;pread it&s;elf for &amp; wide, and that, their <HI>Indians</HI> were pleas'd with the Method the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had taken to furni&s;h the <HI>Natives</HI> with Knowledge they apprehended that un|le&s;s &s;ome Thing like it were done among them, there would be Danger of the <HI>Indians</HI> repairing to us for In&s;truction, and to pre|vent this, and to ingage them to them&s;elves, they &s;et up their School. This, I conjecture, is the Truth of the Ca&s;e. And if &s;o, it is manife&s;t that the <HI>Indians</HI> are inclin'd to &s;eek after Know|ledge: And therefore would be di&s;pos'd to hearken to &s;uch kind and generous Propo&s;als, if they were made to them. And who can tell but that this, that, or the other Tribe, would gladly &s;ettle &s;uch Towns, if they were invited to it in a proper Manner?</P>
<P N="3">3. Another Step, and, perhaps, the mo&s;t promi&s;ing one we can take, to ingage the <HI>Indians</HI> in Friend&s;hip with us is, to &s;end Mi&s;&s;io|naries among their re&s;pective Tribes, Mini&s;ters &amp; School-Ma&s;ters, to in&s;truct them in the Principles, and to per&s;uade them to the Practice of Chri&s;tianity. Tho' they have &s;o long liv'd near us,
<PB N="176" REF="007023_0181_102AEBA7A622B5E8">
and been conver&s;ant with us, yet they remain ignorant of the Way of Salvation, Strangers to the Go&s;pel, and are peri&s;hing for lack of Knowledge: A Ca&s;e that might well move our Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion towards them, and put us upon doing what we can for their Relief. And whether our former Neglect of Things of this Nature has not been provoking to Heaven, may be worthy of our &s;erious Enquiry.</P>
<P>The Intere&s;t the Rev. Mr. <HI>Barclay</HI> had in the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> while he was with them, the Reformation of Manners he wrought among them, their Willingne&s;s to receive In&s;truction, and their Engaged|ne&s;s to pro&s;ecute Learning, are a plain Indication that faithful Mi&s;&s;ionaries would be welcome to them. And the <HI>Five Nations</HI> being neare&s;t us, and their Friend&s;hip of very great Con&s;equence, it might be proper to begin with them: And what has been done among them by Mr. <HI>Barclay,</HI> and others, might be no &s;mall Help in the Ca&s;e. If we &s;hould &s;end Per&s;ons well qualified for the Bu&s;ine&s;s to re&s;ide among them, and &s;upport them well, there would be no Foundation for any Jealou&s;y that we have an ill De&s;ign upon them, and if at any Time &s;uch Jealou&s;ies &s;hould stri&s;e they would &s;oon &s;ub&s;ide, upon the <HI>Indians</HI> having a little Experience of our Kindne&s;s and Friend&s;hip to them. The pru|dent Conduct and &s;aithful Labours of &s;uch Mi&s;&s;ionaries might, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, &s;erve to remove their Barbarity, correct their Manners, reform their Lives, promote in them vertuous Sentiments, and by Degrees form them to true Religion. This we may hope would be the happy Event, with Re&s;pect to many of them, tho' not to all; and it, by much Labour and Expence, it might be brought to pa&s;s, &s;hould we not find our Account in it: for what would be the Charge of &s;upporting a few Mi&s;&s;iona|ries, compar'd with that of an Indian War? And is there not great Probability that &s;uch Mea&s;ures would in a few Years Time attach them to us in a hearty Friend&s;hip? And it the <HI>Five Na|tions</HI> who are a Terror to, and have in great Mea&s;ure the Com|mand of, other Tribes, were indeed our Friends, and made &s;o by &s;uch Obligations laid upon them, would it not be an effectual Means of re&s;raining other <HI>Indians</HI> from giving us Trouble in Ca&s;e of a War?</P>
<P>The general Objection here, I am &s;en&s;ible will be;&mdash;There is no Likelihood of &s;ucceeding, and therefore it is not worth while
<PB N="177" REF="007023_0182_102AD2BD72757718">
to make any Trial, it would only be to &s;pend Labour &amp; Money to no good Purpo&s;e. To which I reply,</P>
<P>How can we draw the Conclu&s;ion before we have made the Experiment? Have we ever made any proper Trial, and &s;ound our&s;elves di&s;appointed? And can it be look'd upon ju&s;t to draw &s;uch a Conclu&s;ion, in a Ca&s;e of &s;uch Importance, unle&s;s we had better Grounds for it?</P>
<P>It is true, Mr. <HI>Sergeant</HI> made a Vi&s;it to the <HI>Su&s;quabanza Indians,</HI> Mr. <HI>Brainard</HI> al&s;o, in his Day, did the &s;ame, without Succe&s;s: but we know that the Excu&s;e tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> made was, that they held their Lands of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and therefore could not comply with &s;uch a Motion, till their Con&s;ent was fir&s;t obtain'd. And be&s;ides, &s;hall we e&s;teem two or three Vi&s;its made by private Per&s;ons a &s;ufficient Trial in this Ca&s;e? Sufficient indeed it was to &s;how that tho&s;e good Gentlemen were po&s;&s;e&s;t of an excellent Spirit, and of a laudable Zeal for the Good of the poor Natives: but yet I apprehend not &s;ufficient to di&s;courage further Attempts. If tho&s;e Gentlemen, who went in a private Capacity, had &s;u&s;tain'd a publick Character, perhaps they had been more regarded. But however, when we have us'd our be&s;t Endeavours, and they indeed prove un&s;ucce&s;sful, we may be excu&s;able; but can we look upon our&s;elves &s;o, if we &s;it &s;till and u&s;e no Endeavours for the Help of tho&s;e poor benighted People?</P>
<P>It proper Attempts &s;hould be made for Chri&s;tianizing the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> there would, I am &s;en&s;ible, &s;ame notable Difficulties lie in the Way, but yet perhaps none but what might be &s;urmounted.</P>
<P>One Difficulty that would doubtle&s;s attend &s;uch a laudable Undertaking, would ari&s;e from tho&s;e who maintain a private Trade among them, from which they reap great Gain; e&s;pecially by the Article of Rum, too much of which they convey to them, and by the Influence of which the <HI>Indians</HI> are ea&s;ily defrauded.</P>
<P>The&s;e Traders would be very &s;en&s;ible, that if Chri&s;tianity &s;hould prevail among tho&s;e <HI>Nations,</HI> the <HI>Hope of their Gain</HI> would be <HI>gone</HI> and <HI>&s;eeing by this Cra&s;t they have their Wealth,</HI> they would u&s;e their utmo&s;t Endeavours to di&s;&s;uade the <HI>Indians</HI> from imbrac|ing the Ways of Religion. They in Fact did &s;o at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> where the Number of <HI>Indians</HI> was &s;mall, and their Trade not &s;o con&s;iderable (as the foregoing Hi&s;tory &s;hews.) How much more then will they do it, it Endeavours &s;hould be us'd to convert the
<PB N="178" REF="007023_0183_102AEBAB7AE7F8A8">
<HI>Mohawks,</HI> who&s;e Trade is va&s;tly more advantageous? But as the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Sergeant</HI>'s Help, &s;aw thro' the Artifice they us'd; and were made &s;en&s;ible of the &s;elfi&s;h Views of the Traders, &s;o doubtle&s;s the <HI>Five Nations</HI> may ea&s;ily be inform'd and the Ob&s;truction &s;oon remov'd.</P>
<P>Another Difficulty will ari&s;e from the fal&s;e In&s;inuations of <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Emi&s;&s;aries, who will not fail to tell them, that we are about to teach them a fal&s;e Religion, and if they hearken to us, they will all certainly be damn'd. But when tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> are properly inform'd of the Conduct of the <HI>French,</HI> and other Roman Catholicks, how they deny the U&s;e of the Bible to the common People among them&s;elves, and that they have no De&s;ign to ac|quaint the <HI>Indians</HI> with the Word of God: And on the other Hand, that our De&s;ign is not to impo&s;e upon them, but to open the Bible to them, to enable them to read it, and to judge for them&s;elves: will not this &s;atisfy them of our hone&s;t Intentions towards them, and of the Safety &amp; Propriety of their examining Things, that they may form a Judgment for them&s;elves?</P>
<P>A third, and perhaps much the greate&s;t Difficulty that would attend this good De&s;ign is, that tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> e&s;teem them&s;elves Chri&s;tians already, and value them&s;elves upon their being as good Chri&s;tians as their Neighbours. Mr. <HI>Sergeant,</HI> in his Journal of <HI>November</HI> 25 1734, &s;ays,&mdash; <Q>The <HI>Mohawks</HI> are generally Pro|fe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity, but for want of In&s;truction have but little of it in Reality.&mdash;</Q> They are &s;o ignorant of the Principles of Religion, that they know not the Difference between one who is baptiz'd and calls him&s;elf a Chri&s;tian, and one who lives agrea|bly to the Rules Chri&s;t has given us to walk by. They are not &s;en&s;ible of the Nece&s;&s;ity of being conform'd to tho&s;e Rules of Vertue and Holine&s;s which Chri&s;t has pre&s;crib'd. <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Emi&s;|&s;aries have baptiz'd &s;ome of them, others (as I have been inform'd) have been baptiz'd by <HI>Dutch</HI> Mini&s;ters; and they e&s;teem it a Privilege belonging to them to have their Children baptized, whenever they pre&s;ent them; without any Regard being had, either to the Qualifications of the Parent, or the religious Edu|cation of the Child. When the Rev. Mr; <HI>Spencer</HI> was among them a few Years ago, they were much di&s;pleas'd that he de|clin'd baptizing &s;ome Children, who&s;e Parents were notoriou&s;ly ignorant, vicious and wicked. Some <HI>Indians</HI> from <HI>Canada,</HI> who
<PB N="179" REF="007023_0184_102AEBAD9C15F8D0">
had an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woman to their Mother, came a few Years pa&s;t to <HI>We&s;tfield,</HI> to vi&s;it their <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Relations there, and while they &s;tay'd at that Place, they had a Child born, and were much of|fended with the Rev. Mr. <HI>Balantine,</HI> who declin'd baptizing of it, as they de&s;ir'd. Since the Rev. Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> has been at <HI>Stock|bridge,</HI> one of the <HI>Mohawks</HI> re&s;iding there had a Child born, and was highly affronted becau&s;e Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> did not baptize it upon his De&s;ire. From the&s;e In&s;tances it is evident, that they account their Children have Right to Bapti&s;m, whenever they de&s;ire it. And being baptized, they e&s;teem them good Chri&s;tians, whatever their Conver&s;ation may be: for they derive their No|tions of Chri&s;tianity, not from the Bible, (to which they are Stran|gers) but from the Example of the <HI>Dutch</HI> &amp; <HI>French,</HI> with whom they are conver&s;ant, and who profe&s;s them&s;elves to be Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>And &s;o far forth as being baptized, in the forementioned Man|ner, and calling them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, will make them &s;o, they are &s;o to be e&s;teem'd. Now the&s;e Things being &s;o, it may prove a difficult Thing to make them &s;en&s;ible, that Drunkenne&s;s and other vicious Practices are incon&s;i&s;tent with Chri&s;tianity; becau&s;e tho&s;e Chri&s;tians, who fall under their Ob&s;ervation, give them an Example of Vice, and go &s;uch Lengths therein.</P>
<P>But yet I apprehend this Difficulty might al&s;o be remov'd, by giving them a ju&s;t and true Account of the Nature &amp; Extent of the Chri&s;tian Religion; by informing them what the Will of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is; how he expects that we &s;hould be conform'd to his Likene&s;s, and to his Laws. The <HI>Indians</HI> are as capable of hearing Rea&s;ons and giving them their Weight, as other Men: and it is becau&s;e they know not what Chri&s;tianity is, that they e&s;teem them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, in their pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances. When they are made acquainted with the Terms of Salvation, propos'd in the Go&s;pel, and what they mu&s;t do that they may inherit eter|nal Life, when they are well in&s;tructed in the Doctrines of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> they will be &s;en&s;ible that the Religion which they now have, is little or nothing like that which is taught by the Go&s;pel. When Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> refus'd to baptize a <HI>Mohawk</HI> Child born at <HI>Stock|bridge,</HI> (which I have before mentioned) and they were very much di&s;pleas'd with him on that Account, he went to them, gave them the Rea&s;ons of his Conduct, and inform'd them as clearly as he was able of the Nature and End of Bapti&s;m: Tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> receiv'd
<PB N="180" REF="007023_0185_102AEBAF2CD5F378">
the Force of his Rea&s;ons, and appear'd to be &s;atisfy'd &amp; contented, when he had taken Pains to inform them. And I doubt not but proper In&s;truction and Information would remove the Diffi|culty I have been &s;peaking of.</P>
<P>Tho' Chri&s;tianizing tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> may prove a difficult Work, yet if our Endeavours might, by the divine Ble&s;&s;ing, be &s;ucceeded, would not the Advantage thence ari&s;ing to them, and us, more than compen&s;ate the Pains and Expence we &s;hould be at? And is there not &s;o much Ground to hope for Succe&s;s, as &s;hould in|duce us to make the Experiment?</P>
<P>I &s;hall now conclude, by briefly &s;ugge&s;ting a few Things, not yet mentioned, the &s;erious Con&s;ideration of which may excite us to u&s;e our be&s;t Endeavours for the Conver&s;ion of the neighbour|ing <HI>Indians</HI> to the Chri&s;tian Faith.</P>
<P N="1">1. And in the fir&s;t Place, &s;hould not the Con&s;ideration of the divine Bounty and Goodne&s;s, be&s;tow'd upon us, excite us to im|ploy Part of that unde&s;erv'd Goodne&s;s to promote the Knowledge of God, our bountiful Benefactor, among tho&s;e who are de&s;titute of it? Thro' the unde&s;erv'd Favour and Ble&s;&s;ing of God, we have been pro&s;perous in our &s;ecular Affairs, &s;ucceeded in our Hu&s;bandry, Trade, &amp;c. and are become a wealthy People: And, were we as willing as we are able, might we not &s;pare large Sums for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel among the Heathen? Ought we not then to &s;hew our Gratitude to the glorious Author of all our Comforts, by imploying a Part of his Bounty to promote the Redeemer's Kingdom? Is it not fit that we &s;hould thus <HI>honour the Lord with our Sub&s;tance?</HI> Does it not lie as a Reproach upon us, who make an high Profe&s;&s;ion, that we expend &s;o little to pro|mote the Knowledge of God among the <HI>Natives,</HI> and &s;o much to ill Purpo&s;es? Were what we imploy in unnece&s;&s;ary Expences, by which Pride and Luxury are indulged and nouri&s;hed, imploy'd in the laudable Method I am recommending; would it not be &s;ufficient, well to &s;upport a Multitude of Mi&s;&s;ionaries among the neighbouring Tribes? Would it not probably be a Means of turning many of them <HI>from the Power of Satan to God?</HI> And would it not be <HI>an Odour of a &s;weet Smell, a Sacrifice acceptable, well plea&s;ing to God?</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Phil. 4. 18.</NOTE> And &s;eeing God, by his Ble&s;&s;ings, has inabled us to contribute to &s;uch a good De&s;ign, &s;hould we not
<PB N="181" REF="007023_0186_102AEBB11969B4F0">
chearfully give of our Sub&s;tance, for the &s;piritual Benefit of the peri&s;hing Heathen?</P>
<P N="2">2. Should not the Light and Grace of the Go&s;pel, which we, thro' divine Goodne&s;s enjoy, be a &s;tronger Argument &s;till to excite us to endeavour the Conver&s;ion of the Heathen?</P>
<P>A few Generations back we were in a State of Heatheni&s;m, as they now are: <HI>Aliens from the common Wealth of I&s;rael&mdash;and with|out God in the World.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. 2, 12.</NOTE> But thro' divine Goodne&s;s, <HI>the Day &s;pring from on High has vi&s;ited us,</HI> and we enjoy the Light &amp; Privileges of the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation. Seeing then God has had Compa&s;&s;ion on us, and be&s;tow'd upon us tho&s;e riches Ble&s;&s;ings; ought we not to have Compa&s;&s;ion on the neighbouring Heathen, and u&s;e our be&s;t Endeavours that they a &s;o may be made Partakers of the Light and Ble&s;&s;ings of the Go&s;pel?</P>
<P N="3">3. Should we not be mov'd to &s;uch charitable Endeavours from the Con&s;ideration of the wretched and forlorn Circum&s;tances, in which the poor <HI>Natives</HI> appear before our Eyes. We often behold tho&s;e piteous Objects, appearing half naked and almo&s;t &s;tarv'd; which is the Effect of their vicious Way of Living. We &s;ee them al&s;o in the Depths of Ignorance &amp; Barbarity; wholly unacquaint|ed with the Way of Salvation, and quite unconcern'd for their eter|nal Good: And yet their Powers, both of Body &amp; Mind, are not inferiour to our own. Were they brought to Civility &amp; Indu&s;try, they might &s;tand upon equal Ground with us, re&s;pecting the Comforts of Life: and were they in&s;tructed in divine Things, made acquainted with the great &amp; important Truths of the Go&s;|pel, they might &s;tand as fair for the Kingdom of Heaven as we do. Should not our Eyes therefore affect our Hearts, when we behold them in &s;uch mi&s;erable Circum&s;tances? And &s;hould we not exert our&s;elves in all proper Ways for their Help. Did the Wounds of the poor Man <HI>half dead,</HI> who <HI>fell among Thieves,</HI> plead with &s;o much Eloquence for human Compa&s;&s;ion, as the unhappy State of the poor <HI>Natives</HI> does for Chri&s;tian Charity? And if the Com|pa&s;&s;ion of a <HI>Samaritan</HI> was mov'd by the former, how much more &s;hould the Bowels of a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> be mov'd by the latter?</P>
<P N="4">4. The noble Example of &s;ome generous &amp; pious Per&s;ons, at Home, may well excite us to liberal Contributions for the Benefit of the poor Heathen.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="007023_0187_102AEBB306C598C8">Not only publick Societies, but al&s;o private Per&s;ons, in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> have generou&s;ly and liberally contributed for the Benefit of the <HI>Natives</HI> in this di&s;tant Part of the World; as the foregoing Hi&s;tory &s;hows. Tho' they are at 3000 Miles Di&s;tance, and never beheld, as we do, tho&s;e mi&s;erable Objects; yet, from a truly pious and generous Spirit, they have &s;ent over their liberal Contributions, that the Heathen, by their Means, may be inform'd in the Way of Life. <HI>Verily, they &s;hall not loo&s;e their Reward.</HI> A noble Example they &s;et before us, mo&s;t worthy our Imitation: And how can we excu&s;e our&s;elves, if we neglect to copy after it? Some indeed may plead their Inability, but this is not the Ca&s;e of all. Are there not among us many wealthy Merchants &amp; Traders? Are there not al&s;o many Farmers, who abound in Wealth, upon the Lands which were, a few Years ago, the Property of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who now &s;tand in Need of their Charity? Should not &s;uch Per|&s;ons be mov'd, by the generous Examples of others, to help for|ward the noble De&s;ign of converting the Heathen?

<P>I &s;hall only add my hearty Wi&s;hes, that this <HI>American</HI> Continent, which, for Ages unknown, has been a Seat of Darkne&s;s, and <HI>full of the Habitations of Cruelty,</HI> may become a Scene of Light and Love; that the Heathen in it, who have been wont to thir&s;t after Blood, may <HI>hunger and thir&s;t after Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI>; That <HI>the Wilderne&s;s and &s;olitary Place may be glad for them, the De&s;ert rejoice and blo&s;&s;om as the Ro&s;e;&mdash;That the Glory of</HI> Lebanon <HI>may be given unto it, the Excellency of</HI> Carmel <HI>and</HI> Sharon; <HI>That they may &s;ee the Glory of the Lord, and the Excellency of our God.</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. 35. 1, 2.</NOTE></P>
