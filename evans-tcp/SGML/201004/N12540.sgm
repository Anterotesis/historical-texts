<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following &s;ermon was fir&s;t delivered to the people of my charge, at an evening lec|ture, upwards of nineteen years ago. Many earne&s;t &s;olicitations that it might be printed, have been with&s;tood; and it would have &s;till &s;lept in oblivion, had not the practice inveighed again&s;t been revived, and attended to, in a fran|tick manner, at a time when every thing in Pro|vidence is calling us to different exerci&s;es. The judgments of God are now &s;pread over our land, and the inhabitants ought to learn righteou&s;ne&s;s. The alarm of war&mdash;the clangor of arms&mdash;the garments rolled in blood&mdash;the &s;ufferings of our brethren in the Northern States, and of others in a &s;tate of captivity; together with the late dreadful conflagration in this town, are &s;o many loud calls to repentance, reformation of life, and prayer, that the wrath of God may be turned away from us: In&s;tead of which, we are &s;wal|lowed up in plea&s;ure and di&s;&s;ipation. It will hardly be credited, that the fire was &s;carce extingui&s;hed in <HI>Charle&s;town,</HI> before we had Balls, A&s;&s;emblies and Dances in every quarter: and even in &s;ome of tho&s;e hou&s;es which miracu|lou&s;ly e&s;caped the flames. And who can believe that our youth are now taught to act plays publickly on the &s;tage, while the theatre is crowded with &s;pectators? Is it thus we requite
<PB N="4" REF="015848_0003_0F9A2DB1500BA698">the Lord for our deliverance? The monumental ruins of this town, will ri&s;e up in judgment again&s;t the inhabitants, and condemn them for &s;uch impieties. The &s;ons and daughters of plea|&s;ure may &s;coff at &s;uch &s;erious hints, but God will not be mocked. I am no prophet, nor the &s;on of a prophet, and yet will venture to pre|dict, that other, and perhaps greater judgments will yet light upon us, unle&s;s we repent.</P>
<P>With regard to the following di&s;cour&s;e, I have only to &s;ay, that it is pre&s;ented to publick view, at the de&s;ire of many friends, and the call of Providence; and that I have thereby borne my te&s;timony again&s;t, what I look upon as a <HI>&s;inful diver&s;ion:</HI> and &s;hall now &s;ubmit it to the ble&s;&s;ing of God, and the candor of tho&s;e who may read it.</P>
<P>But I cannot conclude without expre&s;&s;ing the grateful &s;en&s;e I feel, of my obligations to the many Gentlemen, who, without my knowledge, or re|que&s;t, have &s;o liberally contributed towards de|fraying the expence of this publication; that little or nothing is left for me to do, &s;ave pre|paring the copy for the pre&s;s. They may be a&s;&s;ured that their benevolence and genero&s;ity will not be forgotten by</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE bare reading of my text hath, I doubt not, occa&s;ioned a &s;trange emotion of &s;pirits in many of my hearers; by &s;ome I may be pitied for my folly, by others, de&s;pi&s;ed and ridiculed. Be this as it may, it gives me little or no concern. If I had not been willing to endure the &s;coff of the world, I &s;hould never have made an open profe&s;&s;ion of the religion of Je&s;us; much le&s;s &s;hould I have become a preacher of his much-de&s;pi&s;ed go&s;pel. He, however, who ventures to at|tack vice, in a public manner, ought to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome degree of fortitude and re|&s;olution; for &s;in is a mon&s;ter of more than a thou&s;and heads; &s;hould he &s;lay &s;ome, there will be many yet remaining, and he may ex|pect to be attacked on every &s;ide; e&s;pecially if he &s;hould dare to level at &s;ome popular darling vice; one that hath been much ca|re&s;&s;ed, and that too by the more polite part
<PB N="6" REF="015848_0005_0F9A2DB37B157530">of the world: in this ca&s;e, there will be a mighty uproar among the people. The whole city, or country, will be filled with wrath, as <HI>Demetrius</HI> and his a&s;&s;ociates were, when they cried out, "Great is <HI>Diana</HI> of the <HI>Ephe&s;i|ans.</HI>" Or, as <HI>Micah,</HI> when &s;tripped of his idols, and exclaimed, <Q>Ye have taken away my gods, and what have I more?</Q></P>
<P>However, leaving the event to God, I am determined, in faithfulne&s;s to my tru&s;t, to maintain an open and vigorous war with all the vices and &s;inful diver&s;ions of the age. Were I to act otherwi&s;e, my own con&s;cience would condemn me, and the world might ju&s;tly reproach me, for my unfaithfulne&s;s. This therefore may ju&s;tify me, for entering on &s;uch a &s;ubject; which I &s;hall introduce by making &s;ome remarks on the context; in which <HI>Job</HI> &s;eems to be at a lo&s;s to ac|count for the di&s;pen&s;ations of divine Provi|dence, with regard to the pro&s;perity of the wicked. The friends of <HI>Job</HI> were far from comforting him, as they propo&s;ed, under his afflictions, and which they might have done by ob&s;erving to him, that one event often happeneth to the righteous and to the wicked; &s;o that no man can certainly judge of love or hatred, by all that is done under the &s;un; and that cha&s;ti&s;ements are &s;o far from being po&s;itive tokens of divine wrath, they &s;ome|times rather indicate love; for whom the Lord loveth he cha&s;teneth, and rebuketh every
<PB N="7" REF="015848_0006_0F9A2DB38FFF1BA8">&s;on whom he receiveth. Such hints as the&s;e might have afforded <HI>Job</HI> &s;ome con&s;olation, under his heavy trials. But his three friends took a contrary method, which wounded, in|&s;tead of comforting him. The doctrine which they laid down, and endeavoured to maintain was this, that wicked men <HI>only</HI> are &s;everely afflicted in this world. Hence, in|&s;tead of comforting <HI>Job,</HI> as an afflicted &s;aint, they cen&s;ure him as a vile &s;inner, and an hypocrite. <HI>Job</HI> labours to refute their argu|ments, and maintain his own innocence. He affirms that the wicked often flouri&s;h, be|come rich and great in the world; when the righteous, on the other hand, are greatly af|flicted, and &s;tripped of all their worldly po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions. He in&s;tances in his own ca&s;e, and then proceeds to point out the pro&s;perous cir|cum&s;tances of the wicked, together with their vain and impious practices.</P>
<P><HI>Mark me,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Job,</HI> con&s;ider my pre&s;ent do|lorous condition, <HI>and be a&s;toni&s;hed,</HI> at the deal|ings of God with me. Can you ju&s;tly charge me with any gro&s;s and impious practices, which according to your hypothe&s;is &s;hould bring down the judgments of God upon me? You cannot; therefore <HI>lay your hand upon your mouth.</HI> Try no more to vindicate your opi|nion, when you have a living in&s;tance, in oppo&s;ition to it, before your eyes. As for my own part, <HI>even when I remember</HI> my for|mer flouri&s;hing circum&s;tances, and con&s;ider
<PB N="8" REF="015848_0007_0F9A2DB48F63B280">how I am &s;tripped naked and bare, and vi|&s;ited with the mo&s;t painful and loath&s;ome di&s;orders, <HI>I am afraid</HI> of tho&s;e judgments of the Almighty, <HI>and trembling taketh hold on my fle&s;h;</HI> not being able to account for my being thus afflicted, while the wicked go on unpuni&s;hed. Tell me, if you can, <HI>where|fore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?</HI> How doth this coincide with your opinion, that God will &s;urely take vengeance on the wicked, in this life? The rever&s;e of this &s;eems to be the ca&s;e, for <HI>their hou&s;es are &s;afe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.</HI> They are not afflicted, or plagued like other men. They &s;wim in af|fluence and roll in plea&s;ure; there is no end to their wealth. And with their riches, their families increa&s;e, &s;o that they &s;hall not want heirs. <HI>Their &s;eed is e&s;tabli&s;hed in their &s;ight, and their offspring before their eyes.</HI> They live to &s;ee their childrens children, a numerous progeny, around them. So that <HI>they &s;end forth their little ones like a flock,</HI> for multitude; they going before them, like a &s;hepherd; not to the hou&s;e of God, to engage in &s;olemn devotion; rather to balls, a&s;&s;emblies and the play-hou&s;e, where <HI>they take the timbrel and harp,</HI> and &s;uch like in&s;truments of mu&s;ick, with which they play, <HI>and their children dance.</HI> Thus merrily they go on, regardle&s;s of a fu|ture &s;tate, or eternal judgment. <HI>They &s;pend their days in wealth,</HI> which they &s;quander up|on
<PB N="9" REF="015848_0008_0F9A2DB510B603E0">their lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures, in great abun|dance, although they can &s;pare little or no|thing for the poor, or any other pious pur|po&s;es. After they have thus run their race&mdash; <HI>in a moment they go down to the pit.</HI> Without any apprehen&s;ion of danger. The wicked have no bands in their death. Their prin|cipal concern in life is to gratify their corrupt inclinations; <HI>therefore they &s;ay unto God, de|part from us: for we de&s;ire not the knowledge of thy ways.</HI> The thoughts of God are di&s;|agreeable to them, and his ways, which are the ways of holine&s;s, they cannot endure. Like <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> they know not the Lord, nei|ther will they obey him. <HI>What is the Al|mighty,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>that we &s;hould &s;erve him? And what profit &s;hould we have, if we pray unto him?</HI> Thus fullne&s;s of riches, honour and plea&s;ure &s;well mens minds with pride, and beget in them mean, ab&s;urd and athei&s;tical notions of the Deity. They look upon him as a mere idol, as nothing in the world; and therefore conclude that they can derive no advantage from praying unto him.</P>
<P>This is the character of the wicked, as drawn by <HI>Job;</HI> a perfect and upright man, who feared God and e&s;chewed evil. In the mid&s;t of which de&s;cription, and as a part of it, &s;tands that very polite, and much e&s;teem|ed practice of <HI>dancing.</HI> A diver&s;ion, which in all ages hath had its admirers and votaries. To oppo&s;e it, will be to incur the cen&s;ure of
<PB N="10" REF="015848_0009_0F9A2DB5D01CAA10">all the gay gentry; and, with them however, to forfeit all preten&s;ions to polite breeding, and good manners. I am willing to ri&s;que greater con&s;equences than the&s;e, that I may maintain a con&s;cience void of offence, to|wards God and towards man. Bear with me then, while I bear my te&s;timony again&s;t a practice, which I look upon as &s;inful, and oppo&s;ed to the chri&s;tian character. And which <HI>Job,</HI> in our text, certainly &s;peaks of as con&s;tituting part of the character of the wicked. <HI>And their children dance.</HI> Ob&s;erve, it is <HI>their</HI> children, <HI>i. e.</HI> the children of &s;uch wicked parents as he was de&s;cribing. By <HI>children</HI> we do not always under&s;tand children as to <HI>age;</HI> &s;ometimes it intends tho&s;e who have de&s;cended from &s;uch or &s;uch parents, although they them&s;elves may have arrived at mens or womens e&s;tate. And if we take the word <HI>children</HI> in our text, in this &s;en&s;e, the meaning of <HI>Job</HI> appears evidently to be this, that the families, or po&s;terity of wicked parents, give into this practice. Would to God that none of the de&s;cendants of pious parents, ever imitated their bad example: and that it might never be &s;aid of any but wicked parents&mdash;<HI>And their children dance.</HI></P>
<P>In treating on this uncommon &s;ubject, I de&s;ign</P>

<ITEM>II. Prove, by various arguments, that

<ITEM>IV. Conclude with a brief improvement.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">I. I am to &s;tate the argument, by giving a &s;criptural definition of the word <HI>dance.</HI></P>
<P>Dancing, according to the &s;cripture ac|count, is &s;ometimes to be taken in a good &s;en&s;e; and then it is expre&s;&s;ive of the inward &s;piritual joy of the heart, which was common|ly manife&s;ted by a comely motion of the body:&mdash;attended with &s;ongs of prai&s;e to God, for &s;ome deliverance obtained, or mercy re|ceived. Thus was dancing attended to, or practi&s;ed by the good people of old, in a re|ligious way. When their &s;ongs were &s;piritual, and the mu&s;ick, as al&s;o the motion of their bodies, were &s;uited thereto. Agreeable to which are the words in P&s;al. cxlix. 3. <HI>Let them prai&s;e his name in the dance: let them &s;ing prai&s;es unto him with the timbrel and harp.</HI> It was thus <HI>David</HI> danced before the ark, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> vi. 16. And in this manner mo&s;t of the dances, which the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> had, were attended to; as you may &s;ee by con|&s;ulting the pa&s;&s;ages in Scripture, where they are recorded. As for in&s;tance, when the Lord had de&s;troyed <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his army in the Red &s;ea, the <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h</HI> women &s;ung and danced. See <HI>Exod.</HI> xv. 20, 21. <HI>And Miriam the prophete&s;s, the &s;i&s;ter of Aaron, took
<PB N="12" REF="015848_0011_0F9A2DB74E94D578">a timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her, with timbrels and dances. And Miriam an&s;wered them, &s;ing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriou&s;ly; the hor&s;e and his rider hath he thrown into the &s;ea.</HI>&mdash;Such a &s;ong as this becomes a rational mind, and is &s;uitable to the ta&s;te of the greate&s;t &s;aint in the world. But it would not be &s;o agreeable to our modern dancers; were it to be &s;ung in their a&s;&s;emblies, it would be to them as &s;moke to the eves, or vinegar to the teeth. Unto &s;uch mu&s;ick and dancing our Lord alludes, in the parable of the prodigal &s;on. Such kind of dancing was lawful and holy, and by no means to be condemned.</P>
<P>But there is another &s;ort of dancing &s;poken of in &s;cripture, which con&s;i&s;ts in a motion of the body, &s;eemly, or un&s;eemly, &s;tirred up by natural or carnal joy, to plea&s;e or &s;atisfy our|&s;elves or others: without any view to the glo|ry of God, or the benefit of &s;ouls. Thus that fine young lady, the daughter of <HI>Hero|dias,</HI> danced, on <HI>Herod</HI>'s birth day; it &s;hould &s;eem that &s;he opened the ball, and performed &s;o well as to fill the king with raptures of joy; whereupon, in a courtly dialect, he promi&s;ed the young lady what&s;oever &s;he &s;hould a&s;k, even to the half of his kingdom. She, being afore in&s;tructed by her mother, very mode&s;tly a&s;ked no greater a reward, than the head of <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t in a charger. Thus, as a reward for dancing, the harbin|ger
<PB N="13" REF="015848_0012_0F9A2DB81050C200">of Chri&s;t lo&s;t his life. Enough, one would think, to cau&s;e every &s;erious per&s;on to abhor the practice for ever. It is this profane kind of dancing that is intended in our text; the &s;ame with what is now in vogue; and which, if it were &s;et in a proper light, would not appear altogether &s;uch an innocent diver|&s;ion as is generally imagined. I proceed therefore,</P>
<P N="2">II. To prove that dancing, according to the common, modern mode, is ab&s;olutely &s;inful.</P>
<P>Some may be ready to think that this is a &s;trange undertaking, and that I &s;hall certainly fail in the attempt. It will be but fair, and therefore I have a right to expect, that you &s;hould &s;u&s;pend your judgment, until I have done; hear with candour, then weigh the arguments in the ballance of the &s;anctuary; and if they prove too light, or in&s;ufficient to prove the point, reject them.</P>
<P N="1">1. Then, I argue that dancing, according to the modern mode is &s;inful, becau&s;e it con|tributes nothing to the chief end of man, nay, is contrary to it. You know that the chief end of man is to glorify God. And this ought to be our principal aim in every thing we do. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> x. 31. <HI>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or what&s;oever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</HI> Now I would a&s;k our advocates for dancing, what tendency that practice has to glorify God? Can you &s;ay that you have any view
<PB N="14" REF="015848_0013_0F9A2DB8D012CEA0">to the glory of God in it? I am per&s;uaded you will not dare thus to give your con&s;cience the lie. And if it &s;hould be proved, as I pre&s;ume it will, that dancing contributes ra|ther to promote the intere&s;t of Satan than the glory of God, it follows that the practice is directly contrary to the chief end of man. Only give this one argument its proper &s;cope, and due weight, and dancing will &s;oon cea&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. A corroborating argument may be drawn from <HI>Rom.</HI> xiv. 23. <HI>What&s;oever is not of faith is &s;in:</HI> but dancing is not of faith, therefore it is &s;in. But perhaps &s;ome may query, "What has this text to do with our diver&s;ions, or any of our trivial concerns?" I &s;hall an&s;wer in the words of a learned Ex|po&s;itor. "This is a general rule, or axiom, which is not only applicable to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, but to any other, whether of a natural, civil, moral, or evangelic kind; whatever is not agreeable to the word and doctrine of faith ought not to be done; whatever is done without faith, or not in the exerci&s;e of it, is culpable, for without faith nothing can be plea&s;ing to God." Therefore, until it can be proved that dancing is of faith, you mu&s;t excu&s;e me if I in&s;i&s;t that it is a &s;inful practice.</P>
<P N="3">3. Whatever action in life we cannot pray for a ble&s;&s;ing upon, mu&s;t be unlawful and &s;inful; and &s;uch an one is dancing; there|fore it ought to be avoided. Will any &s;ay "we are not bound to &s;eek the ble&s;&s;ing of
<PB N="15" REF="015848_0014_0F9A2DB9922F78C8">God upon our ordinary concerns?" I will confront them with the words of <HI>Solomon. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he &s;hall direct thy paths. Prov.</HI> iii. 6. Such univer&s;al piety may not indeed &s;uit the ta&s;te of frolick|ers and dancers; but it well becomes the cha|racter of all the profe&s;&s;ed di&s;ciples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. But &s;hould any query, "Why may we not pray for a ble&s;&s;ing on our dances?" I an&s;wer, you may nor, becau&s;e God has never promi&s;ed to give a ble&s;&s;ing to &s;uch practices; therefore &s;uch a prayer would be &s;in. Nay, you cannot do it, becau&s;e it would be a profanation of the deity, and your con|&s;ciences will not admit of it.</P>
<P N="4">4. The injunction which is laid upon us to redeem the time, prohibits our mi&s;pending it in &s;uch practices. Time is a precious jewel, put into our hands to improve for eternity; and tho&s;e who trifle it away, are (in the &s;crip|ture account) very fools. <HI>Eph.</HI> v. 15, 16. <HI>See then that ye walk circum&s;pectly, not as fools, but as wi&s;e,&mdash;redeeming the time.</HI> Can it with truth be &s;aid, that the time which is &s;pent at balls, a&s;&s;emblies and dances is redeemed? No &s;uch thing. It is &s;quandered away&mdash;it is mur|dered&mdash;it is con&s;umed on our lu&s;ts; and how our dancers will be able to an&s;wer to God, for all the time they have thus &s;hamefully mi&s;improved, another day will determine.</P>
<P N="5">5. It occa&s;ions an extravagant wa&s;te of money; with which great good might be
<PB N="16" REF="015848_0015_0F9A2DBA500F05E0">done. After enough hath been thrown away upon a child, at the dancing &s;chool, to have educated two or three poor children, then truly mi&s;s mu&s;t be dre&s;&s;ed cap-a-pee to make a &s;hining figure at the ball; which expends enough to relieve a virtuous family in di&s;tre&s;s, or cloath half a dozen orphan children. If this is to be good &s;tewards of our money, I confe&s;s I am very much mi&s;taken. And <HI>&s;tewards</HI> we certainly are, and <HI>only</HI> &s;tewards of all we po&s;&s;e&s;s; and mu&s;t be accountable unto God for the &s;pending of our &s;ub&s;tance. I am apprehen&s;ive our dancers think but too little of this. Sirs, you would do well to con&s;ider, that in a little time the Lord will &s;ay, "Come, give an account of thy &s;teward|&s;hip, for thou maye&s;t be no longer &s;teward."</P>
<P N="6">6. The thoughts of having thus &s;quander|ed our precious time, mu&s;t occa&s;ion very un|ea&s;y reflections on a dying bed. Unle&s;s the con&s;cience &s;hould then be a&s;leep, which would avail but for a little while; for at death the illu&s;ion mu&s;t vani&s;h, and then it would be &s;till more terrible to awake in hell. However, tho&s;e diver&s;ions, which were &s;o plea&s;ing to the carnal mind, while in health and &s;trength, can afford no comfortable reflections in a dy|ing hour. The dancer will then be ready to &s;ay, "Wretch that I was, thus to &s;quander away my precious time, my health, &s;trength and e&s;tate upon my idle diver&s;ions! How much better might I have improved the ble&s;|&s;ings
<PB N="17" REF="015848_0016_0F9A2DBB0E7B3EB0">which Providence be&s;towed upon me? How much might I have done for God and my own &s;oul? But, alas, they were objects, too much neglected! How ought I to have redeemed my time, in preparing for death and eternity? But, fool that I was, I &s;pent my life in vain mirth, and &s;inful plea&s;ures. O, for tho&s;e precious moments which I have lo&s;t! But they are gone&mdash;they are lo&s;t for ever; and I am afraid my God, my heaven, my &s;oul are lo&s;t too! Pity, and pray for me, O my friends; and let my late repentance be a warning to you. O guard again&s;t tho&s;e &s;in|ful diver&s;ions on which my poor &s;oul hath been &s;hipwrecked." Such a &s;cene might af|fect one of our dancers, and for a little time make him &s;erious. But how &s;oon do &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions wear off? And then the libertine returns to his folly.</P>
<P N="7">7. It behoves us to live each day and hour, as we would wi&s;h to die; and not to engage in any thing that would alarm us, in ca&s;e death &s;hould overtake us in the act. The truth and utility of this a&s;&s;ertion none will deny. Let me then a&s;k, would you be will|ing to meet with death at a ball, or a dance? You would not. And how do you know, when you venture on the inchanted ground, that you &s;hall come away alive? And is this to hold your&s;elves in readine&s;s? Think, O my friends, how you would look&mdash;how you would feel, &s;hould this ever happen. Hor|ror
<PB N="18" REF="015848_0017_0F9A2E0792B30C60">would fa&s;ten on your countenance,&mdash; trembling &s;eize every joint and nerve, and the convul&s;ive pangs of con&s;cience would be more intolerable than the tortures of the bloody in|qui&s;ition. You would probably u&s;e the lan|guage of a fair lady, in a dialogue with death,
<Q><L>"I little thought you would have call'd &s;o &s;oon:</L>
<L>"And mu&s;t my morning &s;un go down at noon?</L></Q> O, dreadful! To be cut off, in the mid&s;t of my plea&s;ures&mdash;to be hurried from a ball to the bar&mdash;without any time to repent, or pre|pare for eternity! But perhaps you will &s;ay, "Would you have us always on our knees, waiting for death? I an&s;wer, no. You may boldly meet death when engaged about your &s;ecular concerns, or any of the duties of life. I remember to have read, I think, in the life of Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Hale,</HI> that at the time of &s;e&s;&s;ions, while one of the attornies was pleading, there came on a mo&s;t terrible thun|der &s;torm, which &s;ilenced the attorney; upon which the Judge &s;aid to him, Sir, why don't you go on? Go on, my Lord, &s;aid the at|torney, don't you &s;ee how black the heavens are, and the lightning rolling on the ground, while the thunder roars as though the la&s;t day were come?&mdash;And &s;uppo&s;e it is, &s;aid his Lord&s;hip, are you not in the way of your duty? I am here about my bu&s;ine&s;s, and I am as willing to go from hence to judgment,
<PB N="19" REF="015848_0018_0F9A2E085187A008">as I &s;hould if I were on my knees in my clo|&s;et. The way of duty is the way of &s;afety, and while thus engaged we have nothing to fear; but who could manife&s;t &s;uch fortitude at a dance?</P>
<P N="8">8. The conver&s;ation at dances is incon&s;i&s;t|ent with chri&s;tianity; I will appeal to the con|&s;cience of tho&s;e who frequent &s;uch places, whether or no flattery, lying, ribaldry and non&s;en&s;e doth not abound there? Little, I fear, is to be heard, that hath any tendency to reform the manners, or improve the mind; much le&s;s, to mini&s;ter grace to the hearers. There may be enough to corrupt the morals and viciate the ta&s;te of both &s;exes. Is it not from hence, at lea&s;t in part, that we have &s;o much ob&s;cene, vulgar and profane conver&s;a|tion among&s;t us? Our merry gentry, who delight &s;o much in frolicking and dancing, would do well to con&s;ider how they will an|&s;wer for all their filthine&s;s, fooli&s;h talking, je&s;ting and &s;uch like things; when they come to &s;tand at the bar of God.</P>
<P N="9">9. Again, Many dances are extremely im|mode&s;t, and incentive to uncleanne&s;s. This is acknowledged by Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> although an advocate for dancing. "As for country dancing, &s;aith he, it mu&s;t indeed be confe&s;|&s;ed, that the great familiarity between the two &s;exes on this occa&s;ion, may &s;ometimes produce very dangerous con&s;equences." But mode&s;ty bids me be &s;paring here, otherwi&s;e
<PB N="20" REF="015848_0019_0F9A2E090F423830">more might be &s;aid. My &s;oul, come not thou into their &s;ecrets, and unto their a&s;&s;em|blies, mine honour, be not thou united.</P>
<P N="10">10. Farther, The mu&s;ick which leads the dance, is often very ob&s;cene; the tunes be|ing adapted to the mo&s;t vulgar and filthy &s;ongs; which have a tendency to pollute the imagination, and to rai&s;e uncha&s;te thoughts in the mind. Thus the heart becomes a &s;ink of uncleanne&s;s&mdash;a cage of all manner of abo|minable and filthy lu&s;ts.</P>
<P N="11">11. Moreover, The practice we are &s;peak|ing of, cannot be endured in a mini&s;ter. And why &s;o? If there is no harm in it, and if it may be attended to with advantage, why mu&s;t mini&s;ters be prohibited the practice? The thing &s;peaks for it&s;elf: people are con&s;cious that it is an evil, and therefore, although they will indulge them&s;elves in it, they will not allow it in tho&s;e who have the care of their &s;ouls. As for my own part, I think indeed a dancing par&s;on, is an odd character; and a dancing chri&s;tian, is not much better. And our advocates for dancing would do well to con&s;ider, that the Almighty hath no more allowed them a di&s;pen&s;ation in this ca&s;e, than their mini&s;ters.</P>
<P N="12">12. Once more, This practice renders per|&s;ons the mo&s;t unlike to Chri&s;t, our great pattern and exempler. Did Je&s;us ever indulge him&s;elf in mirth? No. Frequently did he mourn over &s;uch impieties, but never did he countenance
<PB N="21" REF="015848_0020_0F9A2E09CF368030">them, in any way whatever. The doctrines, precepts and examples of Chri&s;t, all prohibit vain mirth&mdash;idle and &s;inful diver&s;ions. Tho&s;e who indulge them&s;elves in the&s;e, act diame|trically oppo&s;ite to the religion of Je&s;us; which enjoins temperance, mortification, &s;elf-denial and the like virtues.</P>
<P N="13">13. In fine, The greate&s;t, and be&s;t of men have ever bore a te&s;timony again&s;t the prac|tice of dancing. I &s;hall quote &s;ome pa&s;&s;a|ges from &s;everal authors, which I &s;hall do in their own words; hoping that their &s;entiments may make &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion upon your minds. We &s;hall begin with the ob&s;ervations of that truly great and good man, Mr. <HI>Caryl,</HI> upon our text and context.</P>
<P><HI>Their children dance,</HI> that is, &s;aith Mr. <HI>Caryl,</HI> they are in&s;tructed and taught the art of mu|&s;ick and dancing; or there is rejoicing among them; this is proper to the age and &s;tate of children. Chri&s;t him&s;elf &s;peaks as if this were the trade of children. <HI>Matt.</HI> xi. 16. <HI>Where|unto &s;hall I liken this generation? They are like children &s;itting in the market place.</HI> What do they there? Are they buying or &s;elling? Are they bargaining or trading? No, that is the bu&s;ine&s;s of men. What do the children there? They call to their fellows and &s;ay, <HI>We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not lamented.&mdash; They take the timbrel and the harp.</HI> They live in plea&s;ure; hence ob&s;erve, worldly men
<PB N="22" REF="015848_0021_0F9A2E0A8F360330">breed their children vainly. Here is a de|&s;cription of their education; they are &s;ent forth as a flock in a dance, playing upon the timbrel, &amp;c. Here is all the knowledge and literature they are brought up to; here is all their religion, all the catechi&s;m that they are taught. The Lord giveth this report of <HI>A|braham,</HI> who had a numerous family, <HI>I know him that he will command his children, and his hou&s;hold after him, and they &s;hall keep the way of the Lord.</HI> Gen. xviii. 19. Abraham did not teach his to dance. Here was education in the fear of the Lord.</P>
<P>Thus far are the words of Mr. <HI>Caryl.</HI> The pious Mr. <HI>Henry,</HI> upon the place, &s;aith,</P>
<P>They are merry and live a jovial life. They have their balls and mu&s;ick meetings, at which <HI>their children dance;</HI> and dancing is fitte&s;t for children, who know not how better to &s;pend their time, and who&s;e inno|cency guards them again&s;t the mi&s;chiefs which commonly attend it. Their children do not pray, or &s;ay their catechi&s;m, but dance and &s;ing, <HI>and rejoice at the &s;ound of the organ.</HI> Sen&s;ual plea&s;ures are all the delights of carnal people; and as men are them&s;elves &s;o they breed their children.</P>
<P>I &s;hall add the words of the learned and judicious Dr. <HI>Gill,</HI> in his expo&s;ition of the text.</P>
<P><HI>And their children dance,</HI> either in an inar|tificial way, &s;kip and fri&s;k, and play like calves and lambs, and &s;o are very diverting
<PB N="23" REF="015848_0022_0F9A2E0B50BE3D58">to their parents, as well as &s;hews them to be in good health; which adds to their parents happine&s;s and plea&s;ure: or in an artificial way, being taught to dance; and it &s;hould be ob|&s;erved, it is <HI>their</HI> children, the children of the wicked, and not of the godly, that are thus brought up; &s;o <HI>Abraham</HI> did not train up his children, nor <HI>Job</HI> his; no in&s;tance can be given of the children of good men being trained up in this manner, or of their children dancing in an irreligious way.</P>
<P>This is the te&s;timony of the great Dr. <HI>Gill.</HI> Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> &s;peaking of dancings, revellings and idle diver&s;ions, interrogates thus,</P>
<P>Do&s;t thou not know that thou ha&s;t higher delights to mind? And are the&s;e toys be|&s;eeming a noble &s;oul, that hath holy and hea|venly matters to delight in? Do&s;t thou not feel what a plague the very plea&s;ure is to thy affections? How it bewitcheth thee, and be|fooleth thee, and maketh thee out of love with holine&s;s, and unfit for any thing that is good? Again, Is it &s;port that thou neede&s;t? Do&s;t thou not more need Chri&s;t, and grace, and pardon, and preparation for death and judgment, and a&s;&s;urance of &s;alvation? Why then are not the&s;e thy bu&s;ine&s;s? Farther, Ha&s;t thou not a God to obey and &s;erve? And doth he not always &s;ee thee? And will he not judge thee? Alas! thou knowe&s;t not how &s;oon. Though thou be merry in thy youth, and thy heart cheer thee, and thou walk in the ways
<PB N="24" REF="015848_0023_0F9A2E0C0F11F8A0">of thy heart, and the &s;ight of thine eyes, yet know thou that for all the&s;e things God will bring thee into judgment.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this head with a pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Moreland</HI>'s hi&s;tory of the evangelical churches of the vallies of <HI>Piedmont.</HI> Here I would ob&s;erve, that the&s;e were the only pure churches in the world, for &s;everal centuries. When the world wandered after the bea&s;t, the&s;e people adhered &s;trictly to the religion of Je&s;us. They were remarkable for piety, and endured the mo&s;t cruel per&s;ecutions for the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t. In the tenth article of their di&s;cipline, which treats of balls and dances, they &s;ay,</P>
<P>A ball is the devil's proce&s;&s;ion, and who|&s;oever entereth there, entereth into his pro|ce&s;&s;ion. The devil is the leader, the middle, and the end of the dance. So many paces as a man maketh in a ball, &s;o many leaps he maketh towards hell. They &s;in in dancing &s;undry ways, fir&s;t, in walking, for all their paces are numbered; they &s;in in touching, in their ornaments, in hearing and &s;eeing, in &s;peaking, in &s;inging, in lies and vanities. A ball is nothing but mi&s;ery, &s;in and vanity.</P>
<P>They ob&s;erve that the dancing of a dam|&s;el, cau&s;ed <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t's head to be cut off; and that the dancing of the children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> cau&s;ed <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to break the two tables of the law. They al&s;o prove that the ten commandments are violated by balls. They
<PB N="25" REF="015848_0024_0F9A2E0CD0B3F0A0">cite a pa&s;&s;age from St. <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> wherein he &s;aith, "The mi&s;erable dancer, knoweth not, that &s;o many paces as he maketh at a ball, by &s;o many leaps he draweth nearer to hell."</P>
<P>Thus have I offered &s;ome rea&s;ons and ar|guments, which have determined me again&s;t dancing; which I have enforced by the te&s;ti|mony of &s;everal great and good men; whe|ther or no the whole hath &s;ufficient force to prove the unlawfulne&s;s and &s;infulne&s;s of the practice, mu&s;t be left to the candor of &s;eri|ous minds.</P>
<P>After all, it may be thought that my work is but half done, unle&s;s I can an&s;wer whatever may be brought in &s;upport of this favourite, and fallely called, polite diver&s;ion. And this brings me,</P>
<P N="3">III. To reply to the mo&s;t popular argu|ments u&s;ed in favour of dancing.</P>
<P N="1">1. One of the mo&s;t popular arguments (or rather excu&s;es) for this practice is, "I can &s;ee no harm in it, therefore it can be no crime in me." Poor creature.&mdash;You can <HI>&s;ee</HI> no harm in it.&mdash;This is of as much force, as if a blind man was to tell us that he could neither di&s;tingui&s;h colours, nor &s;ee the light. We may pity your unhappine&s;s, but cannot give you eyes. But you conclude, it cannot be a crime in you, becau&s;e you do not view it in that light. If we are not cognizable for &s;ins of ignorance, <HI>Saul</HI> was not chargeable with guilt, when he per&s;ecuted the church,
<PB N="26" REF="015848_0025_0F9A2E0D8F4CCF20">and yet, for this rea&s;on he accounted him&s;elf the chief of &s;inners. But it may be you are wilfully blind. You might be better in&s;truct|ed, if you would. Let me therefore advi&s;e you to pray to God for in&s;truction, in this matter, laying your&s;elf open to conviction; and I am per&s;uaded you will &s;oon &s;ee an evil in dancing, for which you mu&s;t be account|able to God.</P>
<P N="2">2. It may be &s;aid, "Dancing is a part of good breeding, without which we are not qualified for company, but &s;hall appear &s;in|gular and be laughed at."</P>
<P>Perhaps cu&s;tom may have induced the world to look upon dancing as a branch of good breeding, rather than any excellency in it&s;elf. However, to give this plea all its force, I will grant that &s;ome advantages might be derived from the dancing &s;chool, if pro|perly managed; and po&s;&s;ibly may as it is, &s;o far as it teaches a graceful mein, an ea&s;y car|riage and a genteel behaviour. But the&s;e ad|vantages will by no means compen&s;ate for the di&s;advantages which attend it. For fir&s;t, mi&s;s who is educated at the dancing &s;chool, &s;oon &s;wells with pride and &s;elf-importance, looks down, with an air of di&s;dain, on tho&s;e who are not as well accompli&s;hed, as her&s;elf, and but too much copies the de&s;cription in <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> iii. 16. <HI>The daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with &s;tretched forth necks, and wan|ton eyes, walking, and mincing as they go.</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="015848_0026_0F9A2E0E50E7A300">However, the young lady's fine acquirements, are not to be buried, in tho&s;e avocations which indu&s;try in&s;pires; therefore in the next place, immen&s;e &s;ums are expended to equip her for public view. And &s;o, ru&s;tling in her &s;ilks, powdered a-la mode and &s;tudded with brilliants, &s;he makes her appearance at the ball; where &s;he is introduced into fine com|pany&mdash;gets a ta&s;te for plea&s;ure and di&s;&s;ipa|tion, which often ends in the de&s;truction of &s;oul and body. <HI>The woman who liveth in plea&s;ure, is dead while &s;he liveth.</HI> 1 Tim. v. 6.</P>
<P>And now, &s;uppo&s;e you are not qualified for &s;uch company, what is the lo&s;s? <HI>The friend&s;hip of the world, is enmity with God.</HI> James iv. 4. And our greate&s;t danger lies in our becoming too familiar with it. But you &s;ay that you &s;hall be &s;ingular and laughed at. This indeed may be mortifying; but are you as careful not to be &s;ingular in religious &s;ocie|ty? Perhaps when there, you have nothing to &s;ay, yet this gives you no concern. As to your being laughed at, it need give you no pain; for if you will &s;hun vice and pur&s;ue piety, you &s;hall endure the laugh of the world, al|though you &s;hould behave ever &s;o well.</P>
<P N="3">3. To vindicate dancing, it is &s;aid that "it unbends the mind, and recreates the body." &mdash;This plea can &s;uit none but &s;uch as live a &s;tudious, &s;edentary life; and there are many exerci&s;es, le&s;s expo&s;ed to temptation, that will an&s;wer tho&s;e &s;alutary purpo&s;es, equally as well.
<PB N="28" REF="015848_0027_0F9A2E0F0FCCAD80">Walking, riding, or manual labour may be as profitable and efficacious. Be&s;ides, it doth not appear that dancing hath &s;uch a benefi|cent tendency, as alledged. Strange, that being deprived of natural re&s;t&mdash;expo&s;ed to night damps and inclement air, in a profu&s;e &s;weat, &s;hould be &s;o &s;alutary. The truth is, the rever&s;e is the ca&s;e; and many have danced them&s;elves into eternity.</P>
<P N="4">4. But perhaps we &s;hall meet with &s;ome champion in the cau&s;e of dancing, who comes forth, <HI>Goliah</HI> like, bidding defiance to the ar|mies of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and hath the effrontery to a&s;&s;ert, that "the lawfulne&s;s of dancing may be &s;up|ported by &s;cripture." Can it indeed? If &s;o, our bu&s;ine&s;s will be done for us, and we will promi&s;e to give up the point. Why, &s;ays this hero, "did not <HI>David</HI> dance?" Yes. We know, as well as he, that <HI>David</HI> danced; but then it was religiou&s;ly, before the ark. I have already &s;hewn in what &s;en&s;e we are to under&s;tand <HI>David</HI>'s dancing; and it is in&s;o|lent, as well as perverting of &s;cripture, to bring this pa&s;&s;age to &s;upport our irreligious, modern dances. But, &s;ays this champion, "<HI>Solomon</HI> tells us <HI>there is a time to dance.</HI>" True, and <HI>Solomon</HI> tells us al&s;o, <HI>there is a time to die.</HI> If our dancers thought more of this, they would find le&s;s time for that. But let it be proved, if it can, that <HI>Solomon</HI> intends dancing according to the common mode: and &s;uppo&s;e he &s;hould, all that can be drawn
<PB N="29" REF="015848_0028_0F9A2E0FD1679CB8">from hence is, that there is a time, in which numbers will be profane enough to dance.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another plea for dancing, often made u&s;e of is this, "We may &s;pend our time a great deal wor&s;e." I reply, it always indi|cates a bad cau&s;e when one vice is &s;ubpoenaed to vindicate another. Nothing therefore, need be &s;aid to &s;hew the weakne&s;s of this ex|cu&s;e, only, that we may &s;pend our time a great deal better, them&s;elves being judges.</P>
<P N="6">6. Some have endeavoured to plead for this practice, by quoting the example of pro|fe&s;&s;ors. "There are &s;uch and &s;uch, &s;ay they, who are profe&s;&s;ors of religion, and whom we believe to be good people, who will go to heaven, and yet they can dance as well as any body."&mdash;More is the pity, that they &s;hould lay a &s;tumbling block in the way of others. Often they are heartily de&s;pi&s;ed by the people of the world, for their &s;inful com|pliances. However, all profe&s;&s;ors are not chri&s;tians. Some who have <HI>Jacob</HI>'s voice, have <HI>E&s;au</HI>'s hands. And even the be&s;t are liable to err. Therefore follow none, unle&s;s they follow Chri&s;t. It will be no excu&s;e in the day of judgment, that you &s;aw profe&s;&s;ors go to balls and a&s;&s;emblies, and therefore you thought there could be no harm in &s;uch di|ver&s;ions.</P>
<P>Thus, having given a &s;criptural definition of the word dance; and proved that dancing, according to the modern mode, is &s;inful and
<PB N="30" REF="015848_0029_0F9A2E1090A3B460">attended with bad con&s;equences; al&s;o replied to the mo&s;t popular arguments, in favour of dancing; I now come, in the la&s;t place,</P>
<P N="4">IV. To make &s;ome improvement of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="1">1. From what hath been &s;aid, we may &s;ee the folly of tho&s;e parents who put their chil|dren to the dancing-&s;chool, and &s;pend &s;uch immen&s;e &s;ums of money, to bring them up in pride, gaity and all the vanities of life. Is this to bring up our children in the fear of the Lord, as <HI>Abraham</HI> did? Is it to train up a child in the way he &s;hould go, as <HI>Solomon</HI> directs? Would it not be much bet|ter, to devote our money to pious and chari|table u&s;es? Do &s;uch parents take as much care of their childrens &s;ouls? Do they in&s;truct them in the principles of the chri&s;tian religi|on, and warn them again&s;t &s;in and vanity? I fear they do not. Look to it parents; you have the charge of your childrens &s;ouls, as well as of their bodies; and a much weightier charge it is. Think, how dreadful it will be to have the blood of your dear childrens &s;ouls, crying again&s;t you, in the day of judg|ment. How awful would it be, to have a child thus to addre&s;s you, on that day. "Oh! cruel parent; you were the in&s;trument of my being, or I &s;hould not have exi&s;ted, to have been thus mi&s;erable. You cared in|deed for my body, but why did not you care for my &s;oul, and labour to make that happy?
<PB N="31" REF="015848_0030_0F9A2E114EE7A4B0">You might, and you ought to have re&s;trained me, when pur&s;uing vanity and folly. But in&s;tead of that, you placed me in the way of temptation; yea, you went with me your&s;elf, to the devil's &s;eminaries; where I was taught to practi&s;e &s;inful plea&s;ures. And now, alas! I am to reap the fruit of our doings, to all eternity." Is the thought &s;hocking? O! give no occa&s;ion for the dolorous complaint.</P>
<P N="2">2. What hath been &s;aid, reproves tho&s;e who are attached to, and engaged in the practice of frolicking, dancing, and &s;uch like &s;inful diver&s;ions. I &s;ay, <HI>&s;uch like</HI> diver&s;ions; for you would do well to con&s;ider, that the arguments again&s;t dancing, will generally hold good again&s;t gaming, hor&s;e racing and all &s;inful diver&s;ions. My dear friends, you are highly reprovable; but I rather chu&s;e to addre&s;s you in &s;oft language. Let the time pa&s;t &s;uffice you, to have gone on in &s;in and folly. For&s;ake the fooli&s;h and live, and walk in the way which leads to eternal life. You are &s;urely making work for repentance. God grant that it may be in time.</P>
<P>If after all that hath been &s;aid, you &s;till remain unconvinced, and can &s;ee no harm in the&s;e things,&mdash;&s;uffer me to advi&s;e you to pray earne&s;tly, that you may be enabled to &s;ee things in a proper light; and particularly, that you may have a di&s;covery of the wretch|edne&s;s of your own wicked and deceitful hearts.
