<P>GREAT-BRITAIN's unhappy di&s;putes with the Engli&s;h American colonies claim and en|gage a large &s;hare of the public attention. The que&s;tion &s;eems to be, whether immen&s;e numbers of Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, living in remote regions, who have hitherto participated of the ble&s;&s;ings of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution to which they are indi&s;putably intitled, &s;hould be taxed by any man or what is the &s;ame thing any body of men, with re&s;pect to whom they have no right of election, no power of controul? This que&s;tion hath been long agitated, within the walls of the Senate-hou&s;e and without doors; in a variety of &s;hapes, on a variety of grounds; with great acutene&s;s and no little acrimony on all hands. A conte&s;t &s;o important in its nature, &s;o deci&s;ive in its con&s;equences, mu&s;t naturally warm or even inflame the minds of tho&s;e who are intere&s;ted in its fate. Every &s;ubject of the Briti&s;h empire who thinks or who feels mu&s;t take a &s;ide. At &s;uch a cri&s;is it cannot be impertinent to lay before the public the &s;entiments of a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate foreigner on the &s;ubject. Of no party, he may be admitted as a fair umpire; and if qualified in other re&s;pects, if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of adequate abilities and information, his deci&s;ion mu&s;t have weight.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;iderations account for this little pub|lication of an extract from <HI>L'Hi&s;torie philo&s;ophique et politique des etabli&s;&s;ements et du commerce des Europ&eacute;ens duns les deux Indes.</HI> A valuable work attributed to the Abb&eacute; Reynel; to who&s;e authority a kind of &s;anction hath been given by its being quoted as to a certain point (if the news-papers are to be credited) by a noble Lord high in office.

It was once intended to have pointed out a few in&s;tances of this &s;ort which occur; but as the&s;e mu&s;t readily be detected by the attentive and intelligent reader, and as they do not affect the author's rea&s;oning or conclu&s;ions, this was on &s;econd thoughts looked on as a &s;uperfluous labour.

<HEAD>SENTIMENTS OF A FOREIGNER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>&mdash;THE fir&s;t Coloni&s;ts who peopled North-America, devoted them&s;elves, in the beginning, entirely to agriculture. They &s;oon perceived that their exports did by no means enable them to pur|cha&s;e what they &s;tood in need of, and they found them|&s;elves obliged to attempt &s;ome coar&s;e manufactures. This innovation was thought to cla&s;h with the intere&s;ts of the mother-country. It was complained of to Parliament, where it was di&s;cu&s;s'd with all the attention it de&s;erved. There wanted not members bold enough to defend the cau&s;e of the Coloni&s;ts. They urged, that as the labour of the fields could not give con&s;tant employment to the inhabitants throughout the year, it would be rank ty|ranny to force them to wa&s;te in inaction that portion of their time, which the &s;oil did not demand; that as what they earned by agriculture and hunting was not commen&s;urate to their wants, to prevent their &s;upply|ing the deficiency by a new &s;pecies of indu&s;try, was to bind wretchedne&s;s upon them; in fine, that the prohi|bition of manufactures had a direct tendency to rai&s;e the
<PB N="6" REF="014417_0005_0F9263EA0EA7B580">
price of goods in an infant &s;tate, to dimini&s;h if not to|tally ob&s;truct the &s;ale of them, and to di&s;courage new &s;ettlers.</P>
<P>The evidence of the&s;e principles was incontrovertible. It prevailed after very warm debates. The Americans were permited to manufacture their own cloathing, but under &s;uch re&s;trictions, as betrayed the reluctance of an avaricious &s;pirit thro' an exterior of equity. All com|munication in this re&s;pect among&s;t the provinces was &s;e|verely interdicted. They were forbid, under heavy pe|nalties, to &s;end from one to another any kind of wool, either raw or wrought. Some manufacturers of hats however broke thro' the&s;e barriers. To put a &s;top to this terrible di&s;order, as it was called, Parliament had recour&s;e to the expedient of regulations, at once little and cruel. No workman could exerci&s;e his trade till after an apprentice&s;hip of &s;even years; no ma&s;ter was allowed to have more than two apprentices at a time, or to em|ploy any &s;lave in his work-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The mines of iron, which one would think might ab|&s;olve men from all dependency, were &s;ubjected to re&s;tric|tions &s;till more &s;evere. It could only be exported to the mother-country in the rude form of pigs or bars, with|out furnaces to ca&s;t, machines to mould, or &s;ledges and anvils to forge it. The converting it into &s;teel was yet more peremptorily prohibited.</P>
<P>Their importations were hampered with a variety of &s;hackles. No foreign ve&s;&s;el, unle&s;s it be in evident dan|ger of &s;hip-wreck, or loaded with bullion, can enter any of the ports in North-America. Even Engli&s;h &s;hips are not admitted if they come directly from a harbour of the nation. The merchantmen of the Colonies trading to Europe, mu&s;t bring no commodities back with them, but what have been purcha&s;ed from the capital, except the Wines of Madeira and the Azores; and what &s;alt is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the fi&s;heries.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="014417_0006_0F9263EAAD5E1708">Formerly all their exports were to touch at England. Weighty con&s;iderations have &s;ince di&s;po&s;ed government to relax a little of this exce&s;&s;ive rigour. The Colonies are now permitted to carry directly to the Southward of Cape-Fini&s;tere, grain, flour, rice, pul&s;e, fruit, &s;alt-fi&s;h, planks and timber. All their other products go exclu|&s;ively to the mother-country. Even Ireland, which of|fer'd an advantageous out-let to the wheat, flax, and lumber of the Colonies, was &s;hut up by an act of Par|liament in 1766.</P>
<P>The &s;enate which repre&s;ents the nation, in&s;i&s;ts on the right of directing commerce through all the va&s;t extent of the Briti&s;h dominions. On this principle it a&s;&s;umes the power of regulating the connections between the capital and the Colonies, of maintaining a communication, a beneficial and reciprocal re-action, among&s;t the &s;catter|ed parts of an immen&s;e empire. In fact, &s;ome one pow|er ought to determine, in the la&s;t re&s;ort, on tho&s;e rela|tive circum&s;tances which may injure or promote the ge|neral good of the whole &s;y&s;tem. Parliament alone can claim this tran&s;cendant prerogative. But Parliament &s;hould exerci&s;e it to the mutual advantage of all the members of the &s;ocial confederacy. This maxim always inviolable, is peculiarly &s;o in a &s;tate, the movements of which have been all in&s;tituted and adju&s;ted, with a &s;pe|cial view to national liberty</P>
<P>But they departed from this great principle of impar|tiality, which alone can pre&s;erve an equality of inde|pendance among the members of a free government, when they obliged the Colonies to pour into the capital all their products, even tho&s;e which were not to be con|&s;umed in it; when they forced them to take from the capital all their merchandize, even tho&s;e which were brought into it from foreign nations. This imperious and &s;terile con&s;traint, loading the &s;ales and purcha&s;es of the Americans with u&s;ele&s;s charges, a mere dead lo&s;s,
<PB N="8" REF="014417_0007_0F9263EB8AE09390">
which hath naturally and nece&s;&s;arily checked their acti|vity, and of cour&s;e hurt their circum&s;tances; and it is purely to enrich &s;ome merchants or &s;ome brokers of the capital, that the rights and intere&s;ts of the Colonies are &s;acrificed. Yet they owed nothing more to England for the protection &s;he had afforded them, than a preference in the &s;ale and importation of &s;uch of their commodities as &s;he could con&s;ume; and in the purcha&s;e and expor|tation of &s;uch merchandi&s;es as &s;he manufactured. With|in this line the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the Colonies was grateful acknowledgement; beyond it every re&s;traint was down|right violence.</P>
<P>Accordingly, Contraband was the offspring of this ty|ranny. Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is the fir&s;t effect of iniquitous laws, wherever de&s;poti&s;m hath not trampled on codes, forms and tribunals; &s;ole rampart, legitimate and &s;acred of that independency which is the birth-right of man. In vain were the Colonies told a hundred and a hundred times that &s;muggling was contrary to the fundamental principle of their e&s;tabli&s;hment, to political wi&s;dom, to the expre&s;s intent of the laws. In vain was it proved in a variety of publications that the citizen who paid the duties was op|pre&s;&s;ed by the one who did not, and that the fraudulent trader robb'd the fair merchant, by di&s;appointing him of his lawful profits. In vain were precautions multiplied to prevent, and cha&s;ti&s;ements to puni&s;h, &s;uch tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions. The voice of intere&s;t, of rea&s;on, of equity, was an overmatch for the hundred mouths and the hundred paws of the revenue-hydra. Foreign commodities, &s;mug|gled into the northern parts of Engli&s;h-America, amount|ed to a full third of what paid the duties.</P>
<P>A freedom of trade undefined, or only re&s;trained within ju&s;t bounds, would put a &s;top to the&s;e illicit prac|tices which excite &s;uch an outcry. Then would the Co|lonies attain that mea&s;ure of affluence, which would en|able them, not only to &s;hake off the weight of four mil|lions
<PB N="9" REF="014417_0008_0F9263EC30A47FD8">
<HI>Sterling,</HI> which they owe the mother-country, but to take from her annually upwards of two millions worth of merchandizes, which their pre&s;ent con&s;umption de|mands. But in place of this plea&s;ing per&s;pective, which &s;hould naturally ari&s;e out of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, by what fatality is it that a claim unwarrantable in a free &s;tate, hath carried under the har&s;h form of taxation into the centre of the Colonies, a root of trouble and di&s;&s;en|&s;ion, perhaps a con&s;tagration by no means &s;o ea&s;ily ex|tingui&s;hed as lighted up?</P>
<P>England had ju&s;t concluded a war, which might be called a univer&s;al one, in the cour&s;e of which her fleets had hoi&s;ted the flag of victory in every &s;ea, while her con|que&s;ts had enlarged her dominions by an immen&s;e acqui|&s;ition of territory, in both the Indies. This &s;udden and unexpected growth gave her a brilliancy in the eyes of other nations, which made envy and admiration &s;peak, or a&s;toni&s;hed them into &s;ilence; yet within her&s;elf &s;he was compelled to mourn ince&s;&s;antly over her &s;plendid tri|umphs. Cru&s;h'd by the pre&s;&s;ure of a debt of one hundred and forty eight millions, the intere&s;t of which amounted to four millions nine hundred and &s;ixty three thou&s;and four hundred and forty four pounds, with a revenue of ten millions &s;he could &s;carcely provide for the current expences of the &s;tate; and this revenue, without a chance of increa&s;e, was in danger of &s;inking.</P>
<P>The Land-tax was rated higher than it had ever been in time of peace. New duties on Hou&s;es and Windows injured that kind of property; an augmentation of re|venue on the regi&s;try of deeds, bore heavy on real e&s;tates. The veins of luxury had been exhau&s;ted by additional taxes on wrought plate, cards, dice, wine and ardent &s;pirits. Nothing more could be expected from commerce, already loaded with duties in every port, to every port, on the merchandizes of the Ea&s;t, on the products of the We<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|on groceries, on merc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry-wares, in a word, on all &s;ub|jects
<PB N="10" REF="014417_0009_0F9263EE231C3478">
of ex&mdash;or importation, whether raw materials or manufactures. The curb of the Exci&s;e had happily check'd the abu&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, but at the ex|pence of the public revenue. A compen&s;ation had been look'd for from one of tho&s;e re&s;ources which are readily found, but not &s;afely &s;ought, in the articles of general con&s;umption and greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ity: The exci&s;e had laid hold of the ordinary drink of the people, of malt, cyder and porter. Every &s;pring had been forced. All the mu&s;cles of the political body &s;train'd at once to too violent a ten&s;ion, had &s;tarted from their places. The price both of materials and of workman&s;hip, had ri&s;en &s;o pro|digiou&s;ly, that rival and even vanqui&s;hed nations, who till then could not with&s;tand the competition of the Eng|li&s;h, were come the length of &s;upplanting them in all markets, even in their own ports. The whole of the profits which Great-Britain derived from her commerce with every part of the globe could not be e&s;timated at more than two millions and a half; and out of this balance was to be deducted the &s;um of one million five hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds, payable to foreigners yearly on fifty two millions which they had in the public funds.</P>
<P>The cri&s;is was difficult and dangerous. The People mu&s;t get leave to breathe. They could not be relieved by a le&s;&s;ening of the public expences. The&s;e were ine|vitable, whether occa&s;ion'd by the view of turning to ac|count, acqui&s;itions purcha&s;ed by &s;o much blood, &s;o much trea&s;ure, or of curbing the re&s;entments of the Hou&s;e of Bourbon irritated to the la&s;t degree by the di&s;grace of the late war, by the &s;acrifices of the late peace. In the want of every other means of in&s;uring pre&s;ent &s;ecurity, and future pro&s;perity, the idea &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf of calling in the Colonies to the &s;uccour of the capital, by obliging them to bear a part of it's burthens. A determination appa|rently founded on inconte&s;table rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>An e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim of all civil &s;ocieties, and of all

ages, binds on the different members which compo&s;e an empire, an obligation to contribute to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e expences of it in proportion to their re&s;pective abilities. The &s;ecurity of the American Provinces calls for &s;uch aids from them as may enable the mother-country to protect them on all occa&s;ions. It was to deliver them from tormenting di&s;|quietudes, that &s;he engaged in a war which hath mul|tiplied her debts; they &s;hould therefore a&s;&s;i&s;t her in bearing or in le&s;&s;ening this additional load. Safe from the enterprizes of a formidable neighbour, now happily for them removed to a di&s;tance, can they without inju&s;tice refu&s;e to the pre&s;&s;ing exigencies of their deliverer, that trea&s;ure which the care of their pre&s;ervation hath co&s;t him? The encouragements which this generous protector gave for a length of time to the rich productions of their &s;oil, the gratuitous advances which he &s;till lavi&s;hes to tho&s;e regions which are not yet cleared; &s;uch and &s;o many good and kind offices, are they not intitled to a return of cordial &s;ympathy and e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices&punc;</P>
<P>Such were the con&s;iderations which convinced the Briti&s;h government that they had a right to lay internal taxes on the Colonies. They &s;ei&s;ed the opportunity af|forded by the la&s;t war, to exhibit a claim &s;o dangerous to liberty. For who ever attends to it mu&s;t &s;ee, that war, whether pro&s;perous or the rever&s;e, furni&s;hes evermore the pretext for the various u&s;urpations of governments, as if the rulers of belligerant nations had it infinitely more at heart to en&s;lave their &s;ubjects than to vanqui&s;h their enemies. The American Provinces were accord|ingly ordered to provide the trooops &s;ent from the capi|tal for their defence with a part of their nece&s;&s;aries. The dread of interrupting that internal harmony which is &s;o e&s;&s;ential in the mid&s;t of &s;urrounding enemies, in|duced them to &s;econd the intentions of Parliament; but with the deep policy of taking no notice of an act, which they could neither reject without exciting civil di&s;|&s;ention,
<PB N="12" REF="014417_0011_0F9263F0B0954D38">
nor acknowledge without endangering rights too precious not to be tenderly cheri&s;hed. NEW-YORK alone, ventured to refu&s;e all compliance. Though the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion was venial, &s;he was puni&s;hed as for ob&s;ti|nate di&s;obedience, by a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of her privileges. This blow given to the liberty of one colony ought, one would think, to have excited the clamours of all the others. Whether through want of attention or fore|&s;ight, not one rais'd its voice. Their &s;ilence was con&s;i|dered as the re&s;ult of fear or of voluntary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The peace which &s;hould have lowered the impo&s;ts throughout produced, in 1764, the famous Stamp-act, which laying certain duties on &s;tampt paper prohibited at the &s;ame time the u&s;e of any other, in any kind of deed or public writing, whether judiciary or extra judi|ciary.</P>
<P>The whole of the Engli&s;h Colonies in the new world ro&s;e up again&s;t this novelty; and their di&s;content broke out in a very remarkable manner. A kind of con&s;pira|cy, perhaps the only kind which is &s;uited to a civilized and of cour&s;e moderate people, was entered into; a for|mal agreement among&s;t all the Coloni&s;ts to deprive them|&s;elves of all &s;orts of wares manufactured in Great-Bri|tain, till the offen&s;ive act &s;hould be repealed. This in|direct and pa&s;&s;ive mode of re&s;i&s;tance, which &s;hould &s;erve as a model to all nations who feel them&s;elves trampled on by the abu&s;e of power, had its effect. The Engli&s;h manufacturers who had &s;carce any other out-let for their goods, throughout the univer&s;e than the national colo|nies, fell into that di&s;pair into which the want of em|ployment mu&s;t naturally plunge them; and their cries, which government could neither &s;tifle nor elude, made an impre&s;&s;ion &s;alutary for the colonies. The Stamp-act was repealed after two years of a convul&s;ive agitation, which in the days of fanatici&s;m would have been a civil war.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="014417_0012_0F9263F1C8845FC8">But the triumph of the Colonies was of &s;hort durati|on. Parliament had not retreated without extreme re|pugnance. It was evident that they had not renounced their claims, when in 1767, by way of equivalent for what the Stamp-act was expected to have produced, they layed a tax on gla&s;s, lead, tea, painters colours, pa&s;te-board and paper, exported from England to America. Even tho&s;e patriots who &s;eemed to carry the &s;upremacy, of the capital over the colonies to the greate&s;t length, could not help condemning a tax, the operation of which mu&s;t ultimately recoil upon the whole nation, by turn|ing to manufactures tho&s;e hands which it was her inte|re&s;t to have kept confined to agriculture. The Colo|ni&s;ts were as little duped by this innovation as by the former one. In vain was it alledged that government had an indubitable right to lay on exportations what du|ties they thought proper, while they did not deprive the colonies of the liberty of manufacturing for them|&s;elves, &s;uch goods as were &s;ubject to this new tax. This &s;ubterfuge looked like a mockery in regard to a people, who, habituated to tillage alone and re&s;trained from all commerce but with the mother-country, could neither procure by their own labour nor a foreign trade, tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries which were &s;old to them at &s;o high a price. They &s;aw clearly that whether a duty was paid in the old or in the new world, words could not alter the nature of the thing, and that their liberty was equally attacked by an impo&s;t on wares which they could not do without, as by a tax on &s;tampt paper which they were compelled to make u&s;e of. This enlightened people plainly per|ceived that government wanted to deceive them, and they did not think it their duty to be impo&s;ed on, either by force or cunning. They rightly judged that the mo&s;t deci&s;ive mark of imbecillity and of meanne&s;s in a nation, mu&s;t be the connivance of &s;ubjects at the frauds and vio|lences employed by government to corrupt and en&s;lave them.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="014417_0013_0F9263F3AD47B490">The aver&s;ion which they expre&s;&s;ed for the&s;e new im|po&s;itions did not ari&s;e from their exce&s;&s;ive weight, &s;ee|ing they could not be e&s;timated at more than &s;ixteen-pence a head. This was not an object to &s;tartle an im|men&s;e population, who&s;e public expenditure hath ne|ver exceeded one hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds annually.</P>
<P>It was not the dread of finding them&s;elves in le&s;s ea&s;y circum&s;tances. The &s;ecurity they derived from the ce&s;|&s;ions extorted from France; the increa&s;e of their trade with the Indians, the exten&s;ion of their whale, cod, and &s;eal fi&s;heries, the right to cut wood in the bay of Cam|peachy, the acqui&s;ition of &s;undry Sugar-i&s;lands, the greater facility of carrying on an illicit intercour&s;e with the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements, to which they were become nearer neighbours; &s;o many inlets of wealth were an ample compen&s;ation for that trifle of revenue which go|vernment wi&s;h'd to draw from them.</P>
<P>It was not an apprehen&s;ion that the colonies would be drained of what little &s;pecie remained in circulation a|mong them. The pay of eight thou&s;and four hundred Regulars, which the capital maintains in North-Ameri|ca, mu&s;t bring in more ca&s;h than this tax could po&s;&s;ibly carry out.</P>
<P>It was not an indifference for the parent-&s;tate. The colonies, &s;o far from being ugrateful, had evidenced &s;uch zeal for her intere&s;ts during the la&s;t war, that Par|liament from a principle of equity, remitted them very con&s;iderable &s;ums, by way of re&s;titution or indemnifica|tion.</P>

On what grounds do they pretend to privileges greater than what the citizens of the parent-country enjoy? No, reply the Colonies, we a&s;k not a &s;uperiority, we only claim an equality with our brethren. In Great-Britain, the man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth a freehold of forty &s;hillings a year hath a voice in taxation; and he who owns in America, immen&s;e tracts, &s;hall not have the &s;ame pre|rogative? No, what is an exception to the law, a dero|gation from the general rule in the Capital, &s;hould not be a fundamental con&s;titution for the Colonies.

Yet five hundred men in the mid&s;t of &s;even millions of fellow-&s;ubjects, would probably be kept within the bounds of moderation, if not by a principle of equity, by the well-founded dread of the public indignation, which pur&s;ues the oppre&s;&s;ors of a people even beyond the tomb. But the lot of the Americans, taxed at the di&s;cretion of the &s;enate of the capital, would be hopele&s;s and forlorn in|deed. Too remote to be heard, they would be cru&s;hed by heavy impo&s;ts without the lea&s;t attention to their complaints.

<P>The provinces of Engli&s;h America have every thing to fear with re&s;pect to their independence. Their un|&s;u&s;pecting confidence may betray them, may deliver them up bound into the hands of the mother-country. They are inhabited by an infinity of plain and hone&s;t people. They do not even &s;u&s;pect that tho&s;e men who hold the reins of an empire, may be carried away by pa&s;&s;ions unju&s;t and tyrannical. Their old country they &s;uppo&s;e under the influence of no other than tho&s;e ma|ternal &s;entiments, which accord &s;o well with her true intere&s;ts, with that love and veneration they entertain for her. With the blindne&s;s of the&s;e upright citizens, who indulge &s;o plea&s;ing an illu&s;ion, coincides the &s;ilence of tho&s;e who think they &s;hould not di&s;turb their tran|quility, on account of &s;ome light and trival impo&s;ts. The&s;e indolent men do not di&s;cern that it was meant, at fir&s;t, to lull their vigilance to repo&s;e by the &s;mallne&s;s of the impo&s;ition; that England only &s;eeks an example of

<P>Let the genuine patriots then &s;traggle, with unremit|ting firmne&s;s, again&s;t prejudice, indolence, &s;eduction; and let them not di&s;pair of coming victorious out of a conflict in which their virtue hath engaged them. It may perhaps be attempted to lure their integrity, by the &s;pecious offer of admitting to Parliament the Deputies of America, to regulate, in conjuction with tho&s;e of the capital, the national &s;upplies.

The peo|ple of England&mdash;that people &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately fond of li|berty, as on &s;ome occa&s;ions to have protected it in regions remote from their climate and unknown to their intere&s;ts, &s;hall they abandon tho&s;e &s;entiments which their glory, their virtue, their in&s;tinct, their &s;afety, render it their eternal duty to adhere to?

Should factious &s;pirits however form &s;o deadly a con|&s;piracy, and in an hour of madne&s;s and intoxication, prevail on the mother-country to adopt it; what ought the re&s;olutions of the colonies to be, to &s;ave them&s;elves from falling into the mo&s;t dete&s;table dependence?</P>
<P>Previous to their throwing their eyes forward to this &s;ubver&s;ion of the political &s;y&s;tem, let them revolve in their thoughts all the benefits which they derive from their original country. England hath ever been to them an out-work of defence again&s;t the potent nations of Europe. She hath &s;erv'd them as a guide and a governor, to prevent or to heal tho&s;e civil di&s;&s;en&s;ions, which mutual jealou&s;y and emulation are too apt to excite among&s;t infant colonies growing up in each other's neighbour|hood. To the influence of her excellent con&s;titution are they indebted for that peace and pro&s;perity which they enjoy. While the colonies continue to live under a rule &s;o &s;alutary and &s;o gentle, they mu&s;t go on pro|gre&s;&s;ively in that boundle&s;s career, which the vigour of their indu&s;try will &s;tretch even to the remote&s;t de&s;arts.</P>
<P>Let their love of the parent-country however be at|tended

This re&s;tle&s;s and anxious &s;pirit becomes all free &s;tates; but it is indi&s;pen&s;|able in complicated con&s;titutions, where freedom is mingled with a certain degree of &s;ubordination, &s;uch as naturally re&s;ults from a connection between countries &s;eparated by an immen&s;e ocean.

<P>Should admini&s;tration, for ever compo&s;ed of ambitious men, even in the free&s;t &s;tates, attempt to augment the power of the crowm, or the opulence of the capital, at the expence of the colonies, they &s;hould oppo&s;e an in|vincible re&s;i&s;tance to &s;uch u&s;urpation.

Above all, in &s;tates where the principles of legi&s;lation are confounded with tho&s;e of religion, even as one extravagant tenet, is &s;ufficient to introduce a thou&s;and other to minds already deceived, &s;o the fir&s;t encroachment of government opens a door to every &s;ucceeding one.

<P>This enlightened people know very well that violent mea&s;ures and the la&s;t appeal can only be ju&s;tified, when every gentle means of conciliation hath been tried in vain.

<P>And in fact we &s;hould be cautious how we confound that re&s;i&s;tance which the Engli&s;h colonies ought to op|po&s;e to the mother-country, with the fury of a people driven by a la&s;ting and intolerable oppre&s;&s;ion to revolt again&s;t their &s;overeign.
