<P>THIS board having maturely con&s;idered the general tenor and cour&s;e of the military command exerci&s;ed by major general Arnold in this city and &s;tate, and divers tran&s;actions which have appeared to this board during his command, <HI>do re&s;olve unanimou&s;ly,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the &s;ame hath been in many re&s;pects oppre&s;&s;ive to the faithful &s;ubjects of the &s;tate, un|worthy of his rank and &s;tation, highly di&s;couraging to tho&s;e who have manife&s;ted their attachment to the liberties and intere&s;ts of America, and di&s;re&s;pectful to the &s;upreme executive authority of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Wherefore, <HI>re&s;olved unanimou&s;ly,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Second,</HI> That nothing but the mo&s;t urgent and pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity can ju&s;tify or induce this board to call forth any waggons or militia, or otherwi&s;e &s;ubject the good people of this &s;tate to the power and command of the &s;aid general Arnold within the &s;tate, &s;hould he re&s;ume it upon his return.</P>
<P><HI>Third, Ordered,</HI> That the attorney general do pro&s;ecute the &s;aid general Arnold, for &s;uch illegal and oppre&s;&s;ive conduct as is cognizable in the courts of law.</P>
<P>And, that this board may not be &s;uppo&s;ed capable of pa&s;&s;ing the above re&s;olves upon mere general grounds, and more e&s;pecially in the ca&s;e of one who has formerly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in public &s;er|vice, they think proper to declare, that the con&s;ideration la&s;t mentioned has hitherto re&s;trained them from taking proper notice of general Arnold, hoping that every unworthy tran&s;action would be the
<PB N="5" REF="017047_0004_0F9FBDB7801EFD98">la&s;t, or that a becoming &s;en&s;e of &s;uch improprieties would effect an alteration of conduct. But finding that tenderne&s;s has only led to in&s;ult and farther oppre&s;&s;ion, duty to the &s;tate, regard to the intere&s;t and happine&s;s of the good people thereof, who mu&s;t be affected by all abu&s;es of power, oblige us thus to take notice thereof; and farther declare, that the &s;aid re&s;olves are founded upon the fol|lowing articles, in which they have &s;ufficient ground to e&s;teem general Arnold culpable.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That while in the camp of general Wa&s;hington at Valley Forge, la&s;t &s;pring, he gave per|mi&s;&s;ion to a ve&s;&s;el belonging to per&s;ons then voluntarily re&s;iding in this city with the enemy, and of di&s;affected character, to come into a port of the united &s;tates, without the knowledge of the au|thority of the &s;tate, or of the commander in chief, though then pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><HI>Second,</HI> In having &s;hut up the &s;hops and &s;tores on his arrival in the city, &s;o as even to prevent officers of the army from purcha&s;ing, while he privately made con&s;iderable purcha&s;es for his own be|nefit, as is alledged and believed.</P>
<P><HI>Third,</HI> In impo&s;ing menial offices upon the &s;ons of freeman of this &s;tate, when called forth by the defire of congre&s;s to perform militia duty; and when remon&s;trated to hereupon, ju&s;tifying him&s;elf in writing, upon the ground of having power &s;o to do; for that, <Q>when a citizen a&s;&s;umed the character of a &s;oldier, the former was intirely lo&s;t in the latter; and that it was the duty of the militia to obey <HI>every</HI> order of his aids (not a breach of the laws and con&s;titution) as his (the general's) with|out judging of the propriety of them.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Fourth,</HI> For that, when a prize was brought into this port by the Convention brig, of this &s;tate, whereon a di&s;pute aro&s;e re&s;pecting the capture, which would otherwi&s;e in great probability have been amicably adju&s;ted between the claimants, general Arnold interpo&s;ed by an illegal and unworthy purcha&s;e of the &s;uit, at a low and inadequate price, as has been publicly charged by a reputable citizen; to which may in &s;ome degree be a&s;cribed the delay of ju&s;tice in the courts of appeal, and the di&s;pute in which the &s;tate may probably be involved with congre&s;s hereupon.</P>
<P><HI>Fifth,</HI> The appropriating the waggons of this &s;tate, when called forth upon a &s;pecial emergency la&s;t autumn, to the tran&s;portation of private property, and that of per&s;ons who voluntarily remained with the enemy la&s;t winter, and were deemed di&s;affected to the intere&s;t; and independence of America.</P>
<P><HI>Sixth,</HI> In that, congre&s;s by a re&s;olve of the twenty fir&s;t of Augu&s;t la&s;t, having given to the executive powers of every &s;tate, an exclu&s;ive power to recommend per&s;ons de&s;irous of going within the enemy's lines, to the office: there commanding, general Arnold, in order, as may rea&s;onably be inferred, to elude the &s;aid re&s;olve, wrote a letter, as appears by compari&s;on of hands and the 'declaration of the intended bearer, recommendatory for the above purpo&s;e, and cau&s;ed his aid de camp, major Clark&s;on, to &s;ign the &s;ame. But the &s;aid device not taking effect, through the vigilance of the officers at Elizabeth|town, general Arnold, without di&s;clo&s;ing any of the above circum&s;tances, applied to council for their permi&s;&s;ion, which was in&s;tantly refu&s;ed, the connection, character and &s;ituation of the party being well known and deemed utterly improper to be indulged with &s;uch permi&s;&s;ion, thereby violating the re&s;olve of congre&s;s, and u&s;urping the authority of this board.</P>
<P><HI>Seventh,</HI> This board having, upon the complaint of &s;everal inhabitants of Che&s;ter county, through the late waggon ma&s;ter general, <HI>reque&s;ted</HI> of the &s;aid general Arnold to &s;tate the &s;aid tran&s;action re&s;pecting the waggons, in order that they might &s;atisfy the complainants, or explain the &s;ame without farther trouble, received in return an indecent and di&s;re&s;pectful refu&s;al of any &s;atisfaction what&s;oever.</P>
<P><HI>Eighth,</HI> The di&s;couragement and neglect manife&s;ted by general Arnold, during his command, to civil, military and other characters, who have adhered to the cau&s;e of their country&mdash;with an entire different conduct towards tho&s;e of another character are too notorious to need proof or illu&s;tration. And if this command has been, as is generally believed, &s;upported at an expence of four or five thou&s;and pounds per annum to the united &s;tates, we freely declare we &s;hall very unwillingly pay any &s;hare of expences thus incurred.</P>

<P>I THIS day received an order, &s;igned by the &s;ecretary of the honorable council of this &s;tate, reque&s;ting I would give them information re&s;pecting a brigade of waggons under the conduct of Je&s;&s;e Jordan, a waggon ma&s;ter from Che&s;ter county, the council having been informed that I &s;ent them to Egghar|bour, to convey private property to this city. I &s;hall at all times be ready to give your excellency and the honorable council every information you think nece&s;&s;ary for the good of the public, or this &s;tate in particular, which relates to my office, or the bu&s;ine&s;s of the department, as I have no de&s;ire to conceal any part of my conduct as a public officer, having conducted the bu&s;ine&s;s under my direction with in|tegrity, and ju&s;tice to the public. The following are the &s;tate of the facts required, viz.</P>
<P>In the month of October la&s;t, at the time the enemy had landed &s;ome troops at Eggharbour, general Arnold de&s;ired I would furni&s;h him with a brigade of teams, which he wanted to &s;end to the Jer&s;ies, and that he would pay the hire of them, they being wanted to remove property which was in imminent danger of falling into the hands of the enemy. I informed him, he &s;hould have the waggon ma&s;ter of the fa&s;t brigade which could be &s;pared from public &s;ervice, &s;ent to him, when he would give &s;uch orders as he plea&s;ed. Accordingly, about the 22d of October mr. Jordan was &s;ent to the general, to receive his directions, having at that time &s;ent forward a large &s;upply for the army, &amp;c. When Jordan returned, he was de&s;ired to make out his account to general Arnold, to be paid. I do not know where the loading was &s;tored, nor who&s;e property it was, further than what is before mentioned. A greater number of continental teams coming in than I expected, enabled me to comply with general Arnold's reque&s;t, with|out any inconvenience to the &s;ervice. If there is any thing further, in which I can &s;atisfy your excellency and the council, I will wait on you at any time with plea&s;ure.</P>

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS board, which by its' duty and flation is hound to protect the rights and Intere&s;ts of the good people of this &s;tate, having received a complaint from mr. Andrew Boyd, in behalf and others, that the public waggons of the &s;tate, when called forth under the waggon law, have been employed in the tran&s;portation of private property, reque&s;ted of John Mitchell, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> d q. m. g. the rea&s;ons of &s;uch conduct. Mr. Mitchell, admitting the fact, alledged in ju&s;tification, that the waggons had been &s;o employed by the direction of general Arnold, then the military commanding officer of this &s;tate. This board having thereupon tran&s;mitted to general Arnold a copy of their proceedings, with mr. Mitchell's an&s;wer, and reque&s;ted general Arnold to give us a &s;tate of the tran&s;action, he this day returned for an&s;wer, <Q>that he was at all times ready to an&s;wer for his public conduct to congre&s;s or general Wa&s;hing|ton, to whom alone he was accountable.</Q></P>

<P>Major general Arnold admitted that he gave the protection while in the camp of his excellency gene|ral Wa&s;hington at Valley Forge, without the knowledge of the authority of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, or the commander in chief, though then pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>To prove the character and re&s;idence of the per&s;ons to whom the protection was given, the judge advocate produced Timothy Matlock, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> who, on his affirmation, &s;ays,</P>
<P>Q. Do you know the character of the per&s;on to whom general Arnold gave the permi&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>A. Generally, I do.</P>
<P>Q. What was his character at the time?</P>
<P>A. Captain Robert Shewell, junior, was, at the time of that pa&s;s being given, generally reputed not to be well affected to the united &s;tates of America, as I under&s;tand. Captain Robert Shewell, junior, informed me, that he was ordered to leave general Wa&s;hington's camp, in con&s;equence of the charac|ter that had been given of him; and upon his appearing on parade afterwards, he was ordered to leave general Wa&s;hington's camp on pain of impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>Q. Did captain Robert Shewell, junior, re&s;ide in Philadeiphia at that time?</P>
<P>A. He informed me he did voluntarily re&s;ide there at the time.</P>
<P>Q. court. Do you know whether general Arnold knew captain Robert Shewell, junior's, general cha|racter at the time he gave the permi&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>A. I do not.</P>
<P>Q. court. Do you know whether general Arnold knew of captain Shewell's being ordered to leave the camp of general Wa&s;hington, previous to his having given him the permit?</P>
<P>A. I had no opportunity of being acquainted with the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know the per&s;ons who were concerned in the ve&s;&s;el with captain Shewell at that time?</P>
<P>A. It was &s;uppo&s;ed mr. Shirtliff was concerned, and &s;everal others, who&s;e characters I know nothing of and cannot give; and it was &s;uppo&s;ed that general Arnold was concerned in the ve&s;&s;el or cargo.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know mr. Shirtliff's character?</P>
<P>A. So little as not to be able to give his character generally.</P>
<P>General Arnold's que&s;tion. What conver&s;ation introduced captain Shewell's mentioning to you, his being ordered from the camp of general Wa&s;hington? and did he tell you the rea&s;on of it?</P>
<P>A. I believe the conver&s;ation took its ri&s;e from mr. Shewell's mentioning to me, that he was likely to be treated ill, upon a charge of his having ill treated mr. Paul Fooks at the coffee hou&s;e in Philadelphia, while the enemy had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city. The rea&s;on he a&s;&s;igned to me, for his being ordered to leave general Wa&s;hington's camp, was, he &s;uppo&s;ed he had been repre&s;ented to general Wa&s;hington as being untriendly to America.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="017047_0008_0F9FBDBE8FF2D708">
General Arnold's que&s;tion. Have you under&s;tood, that upon &s;everal alarms captain Shewell turned out with the militia, and did duty with them?</P>
<P>A. I know nothing of that matter.</P>
<P>Q. Did you con&s;ider captain Robert Shewell, junior, at the time the protection was given, to be un|friendly to the united &s;tates of America?</P>

<P>The court met, according to adjournment.</P>
<P>Timothy Matlack, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> on his affirmation, &s;ays, That &s;ome time during the enemy's having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city of Philadelphia, information was given to the board of war, that property belonging to captain Robert Shewell, junior, was arrived in Virginia, part of a ve&s;&s;el and cargo in which the Wykoffs, one or more of that family, was concerned. Upon the repre&s;entation being made, an order was i&s;&s;ued for their being &s;eized, as belonging to captain Robert Shewell, junior, who was deemed unfriendly to the united &s;tates of America. They were &s;eized on that order, and were detained: the length of time the cannot a&s;certain; neither does he know of their being delivered up to this day. This information he re|ceived from mr. Shewell and from mr. l&s;aac Wykoff.</P>
<P>Q. court. Was this order i&s;&s;ued by the board of war before captain Robert Shewell, junior, obtained the permi&s;&s;ion of general Arnold?</P>
<P>A. Mo&s;t probably &s;everal months.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know whether general Arnold knew of the board of war having i&s;&s;ued the order re&s;pecting the &s;eizure of captain Shewell's property?</P>
<P>A. I know of no circum&s;tance that &s;hould afford me an opportunity to judge concerning that.</P>
<P>Q. court. Where did the board of war &s;it at the time?</P>
<P>A. I &s;uppo&s;e at Yorktown.</P>
<P>Q. court. Do you know where general Arnold was at that time?</P>
<P>A. I do not, further than it was a general knowledge that he was with the army at the northward.</P>
<P>In &s;upport of the &s;econd charge, the judge advocate produced his excellency general Wa&s;hington's in|&s;tructions to major general Arnold, dated June 18, 1778, a re&s;olution of the honorable the congre&s;s, dated June 5, 1778, and a copy of a proclamation i&s;&s;ued by major general Arnold, dated June 19, 1778; which being read, are as follow:</P>

<P>Que&s;tion by general Arnold to Timothy Matlack, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> Is the depo&s;ition of colonel Fitzgerald, in your hand writing?</P>
<P>A. Yes; it was dictated to me by colonel John Fitzgerald, and while in the rough by him altered and amended, and afterwards copied fair. The next day he called at my hou&s;e, and informed me he had &s;een you, in con&s;equence of your reque&s;t; that there was one or two alterations he wi&s;hed to make, in con&s;equence of the conver&s;ation with you, which alterations are interlined, and written preci&s;ely in the words he dictated, having I believe written them on a piece of paper, before me. Colonel Fitzge|rald was a perfect &s;tranger to me, having to the be&s;t of my knowledge never &s;een him before to know him.</P>
<P>The judge advocate produced major Franks, aid de camp to major general Arnold, who was &s;worn.</P>
<P>Q. On general Arnold's arrival in Philadelphia, do you know whether him&s;elf or any per&s;on on his account, made any con&s;iderable purcha&s;es of goods?</P>
<P>A. I do not.</P>
<P>Q. At or before general Arnold's arrival in Philadelphia, did you receive orders from general Arnold to purcha&s;e goods, or do you know of general Arnold's having given orders to any other per&s;on to make purcha&s;es of goods?</P>
<P>A. I did receive from general Arnold, that paper which colonel Fitzgerald has mentioned in his depo|&s;ition. There are circum&s;tances leading to it which I mu&s;t explain. I had, by being in the army, injured my private affairs very con&s;iderably, and meant to leave it, if a proper opportunity of entering into bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould happen. I had &s;everal conver&s;ations on the &s;ubject with general Arnold, who promi&s;ed me all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power; he was to participate in the profits of the bu&s;ine&s;s I was to enter into. At that time, previous to our going into Philadelphia, I had &s;everal particular conver&s;ations with him, and thought that the period, in which I might leave the army with honour, and enter into bu&s;ine&s;s, I received at that time, or about that time, I think &s;everal days before the enemy evacuated the city, the paper mentioned in colonel Fitgerald's depo&s;ition that was not &s;igned, as well as the other. Upon our coming into town we had variety of military bu&s;ine&s;s to do. I did not purcha&s;e any goods, neither did I leave the army. The paper was entirely neglected, neither did I think any thing concerning it, until I heard of colonel Fitgerald's depo&s;ition. General Arnold has told me &s;ince, which is &s;ince I came from Carolina &s;ometime in Augu&s;t la&s;t, on &s;peaking about the paper, that the rea&s;on for his not &s;upporting me in bu&s;ine&s;s was, &s;uppo&s;ing that I had left the army, it was incompatible with his excellency's in|&s;tructions and the re&s;olution of congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Q. court. Did general Arnold a&s;k you upon his coming into Phiadelphia, or at any time after, why you had not executed the contents of the paper?</P>
<P>A. He did not.</P>
<P>Q. court. What day did you arrive in Philadelphia?</P>
<P>A. The 18th day of June, in the evening, the day the enemy left Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Q. court. Are you certain that the order for purcha&s;ing the goods was given to you &s;everal days before you went into Philadelphia?</P>
<P>A. I cannot be particular as to the time; it might have been three, four, five, or twenty days; but it was &s;ome time before.</P>
<P>Q. Previous to the enemy evacuating the city of Philadelphia, did you under&s;tand from general Arnold that be was to have the command in the city, on the evacuation taking place?</P>
<P>A. I did; but it was a &s;hort time before, I believe a day or two. The general, on his return from head-quarters, mentioned it was hinted to him at general Wa&s;hington's, that he &s;hould, when the ene|my evacuated Philadelphia, have the command, and de&s;ired me not to mention it.</P>
<P>Q. Were the in&s;tructions to purcha&s;e goods given to you before the general mentioned this matter to you?</P>
<P>A. I believe they were, though I am not certain.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="017047_0011_0F9FBDC0830E2A60">
General Arnold's que&s;tion. Were not my minute and invoice books always open to your in&s;pec|tion?</P>

<P>A. No.</P>

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE militia &s;erjeant who attended at your quarters on Sunday, complains that major Franks, one of your aids, had given him orders to call his barber, which order was obeyed; that on the barber not appearing the order was repeated, and the &s;erjeant, though hurt both by the order it&s;elf, and the manner of it, again obeyed; he al&s;o informs me, that he has, this morning, made you ac|quainted with this complaint, and that you had been plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that every order given by you or your aids, is to be obeyed. This, I &s;uppo&s;e, mu&s;t intend every proper order.</P>
<P>The militia of the &s;everal &s;tates have, occa&s;ionally, rendered the great cau&s;e in which we are en|gaged &s;uch &s;ervices, as mu&s;t convince every man that it is of very great importance to treat tho&s;e who are nece&s;&s;arily called out, in &s;uch manner as to make the duty as agreeable to them as is con|&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ervice to which they are called: For it is upon their will, more than upon the force of any law, that we are to depend for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the time of need. The &s;everity of mili|tary di&s;cipline in &s;uch a ca&s;e as that above mentioned, where no important end is to be an&s;wered by it, mu&s;t make every freeman feel. At a time when you were one of the militia of the &s;tate of which you are a citizen, what would have been your feelings, had an aid of your commanding officer ordered you to call his barber? From your feelings in &s;uch a ca&s;e, it will be ea&s;y to judge of that of other men. Freemen will be hardly brought to &s;ubmit to &s;uch indignities; and if it is intended to have any of the re&s;pectable citizens of a &s;tate, in &s;ervice in the militia, military di&s;cipline in &s;uch in|&s;tances mu&s;t be relaxed; but if it is an object to render the militia in the &s;everal &s;tates contemptible and u&s;ele&s;s, the continuance of &s;uch treatment will probably effect it. Military duty of every kind is rather di&s;agreeable; and perhaps, to freemen, garri&s;on duty more di&s;agreeable than any other. The &s;erjeant above mentioned entered the &s;ervice to di&s;charge his duty, and as an example to other young men of the city, and not from nece&s;&s;ity, in any &s;en&s;e of the word.</P>
<P>It appears to me a duty which I owe to the public, to repre&s;ent this matter to you in a re&s;pectful manner, in expectation that, from attachment to the public intere&s;t, you will give &s;uch orders as will prevent any farther complaints of this kind, which is all the &s;atisfaction &s;ought after, either by the &s;erjeant, who is my &s;on, or,</P>

At the &s;ame time I beg leave to ob&s;erve, that whenever nece&s;&s;ity obliges the citizen to a&s;&s;ume the character of a &s;oldier, the former is intirely lo&s;t in the latter, and the re|&s;pect due to a citizen is by no means to be paid to the &s;oldier, any farther than his rank in|titles
<PB N="13" REF="017047_0012_0F9FBDC1621C4108">him to it. This is evident from the nece&s;&s;ity of military di&s;cipline, the ba&s;is of which is im|plicit obedience, and however the feelings of a citizen may be hurt, he has this con&s;olation, that it is a &s;acrifice he pays to the &s;afety of his country.</P>
<P>You are plea&s;ed to a&s;k, "What my feelings would have been on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion." They have been tried; I have &s;erved a whole campaign under the command of a gentleman, who was not known as a &s;oldier until after I had been &s;ome time a brigadier: My feelings were hurt not only as a citizen, but more &s;o as a &s;oldier; they were however &s;acrificed to the intere&s;t of my country. The event proved unfortunate to me; but I have the &s;atisfaction to think I rendered &s;ome &s;ervice to my country.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h to make the duty as agreeable to the militia as is con&s;i&s;tent with the good of the &s;ervice, for which purpo&s;e military di&s;cipline has been greatly relaxed; was it executed with &s;trictne&s;s, mo&s;t of the militia, from their inattention, would feel the effects of it.</P>
<P>I cannot think (as you &s;eem to imagine) any indignity is offered to the citizen, when he is called upon to do the duty of a &s;oldier in the &s;tation he is in, which was the ca&s;e of the &s;erjeant; who though he may be a more re&s;pectable character as a citizen, yet, as an orderly &s;erjeant, it is his duty to obey every order of my aids, not a breach of the laws or principles of the con&s;titution, as mine, without judging of the propriety of them; neither can I have any idea from the militia's being put on the &s;ame footing as the &s;tanding army, they will refu&s;e their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as &s;elf pre&s;ervation is the fir&s;t principle of human nature, theirs will ever induce them to turn out and defend their pro|perty.</P>
<P>The&s;e, Sir, are the &s;entiments of a &s;oldier, a citizen, and of, Sir,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your letter of the 6th in&s;tant; and it gives me real and great plea&s;ure to be in|formed of your patriotic behaviour in the ca&s;e you mention. Such conduct is the effect of genuine &s;pirit and true greatne&s;s of mind; but it is very different from the ca&s;e I &s;tated. You obeyed, becau&s;e the effential intere&s;t of your country was concerned, and a regard to your own &s;ame required it; but the &s;ame principles, which induced this conduct, would have induced you to &s;purn at commands dictated by pride and in&s;olence.</P>
<P>I cannot bring my&s;elf to believe, that the re&s;pect due to the citizen is entirely lo&s;t when he takes upon him&s;elf the character of a &s;oldier: I entertain a higher &s;en&s;e of the rights of citizens and freemen.</P>
<P>If, on the one hand, &s;oldiers are bound implicitly to obey military orders, &s;o, on the other hand, are officers accountable for the orders which they give; and their propriety or impropriety often de|pend entirely on time and circum&s;tance. Occa&s;ions may occur in which an officer may ju&s;tify com|mand which expo&s;e a citizen to certain death; but I know of none which would ju&s;tify a command to a citizen &s;erving in the militla to clean his officers &s;hoes. The nece&s;&s;ity of implicit obedience on the part of the citizen, when in military &s;ervice, is &s;o far from being ground, on which to ju&s;tify every command which may be given, that it is the &s;tronge&s;t po&s;&s;ible rea&s;on, why an officer &s;hould be very cautious and circum&s;pect in his orders; and it al&s;o lays the citizen under a nece&s;&s;ity of call|ing officers to a &s;trict account for the orders which they give. I will venture to &s;ay, that, in a free government, implicit obedience will not be &s;ubmitted to much longer than commanders u&s;e their au|thority with great prudence and di&s;cretion, and, if it be really nece&s;&s;ary, commanders, who de&s;troy it, by degrading and unnece&s;&s;ary orders, they will be accountable for the con&s;equences, You &s;ay it is the duty of an orderly &s;erjeant <Q>to obey every order of your aids (not a breach of the laws or prin|ciples of the con&s;titution) as yours, without judging of the propriety of them.</Q> This &s;entiment mu&s;t have dropt from your pen in a moment of ha&s;te; as it appears to me to be a &s;entiment impro|per to be entertained either by the citizen or &s;oldier: For even common &s;oldiers retain &s;ome right to judge of the propriety of the orders which they have obeyed; and to demand &s;atisfaction in ca&s;es where improper or unnece&s;&s;ary orders have been given: And freemen will judge for them&s;elves and &s;peak for them&s;elves with decency and firmne&s;s when the occa&s;ion requires it. The calling of major Franks's barber to dre&s;s his hair, was the office of a menial &s;ervant, not the duty of a &s;oldier; and I &s;till think it an indignity to a free citizen to be ordered to go on &s;uch an errand. Such commands cannot be mi&s;taken for and obeyed as the orders of a wi&s;e and prudent general.</P>
<P>My letter to you was written for the &s;ingle purpo&s;e of preventing orders being madvertently given, which would offend a militia who have &s;uffered greatly many ways; and I had a hope, that you would have thought it proper to have given &s;ome a&s;&s;urance that attention would have been paid to this, as
<PB N="14" REF="017047_0013_0F9FBDC293484B68">it appears to me, nece&s;&s;ary precaution; but I am not a little mortified to find the order, of which I complained, &s;o fully ju&s;tified and &s;upported by you. If it is your intention, as commanding officer, to countenance orders of this kind, it is my duty, as a father, to withdraw my &s;on from a &s;ervice in which commands are to be given him which to obey would le&s;&s;en him in the e&s;teem of the world; and I &s;hall con&s;ider it as a duty which I owe to my&s;elf to acquaint my fellow citizens of my rea&s;on for &s;o doing.</P>

<P>BY your letter of the 10th, I perceive that my &s;entiments are not clearly under&s;tood; but it is needle&s;s to di&s;cu&s;s a &s;ubject which will perhaps be determined more by the feelings than the rea&s;on of men. If the declaration, that you will withdraw your &s;on from the &s;ervice, and publi&s;h the rea&s;ons, is intended as a threat, you have mi&s;taken your object. I am not to be intimidated by a new&s;paper. To vindicate the rights of citizens, I became a &s;oldier, and bear the marks upon me. I hope your candour will acquit me of the incon&s;i&s;tency of invading what I have fought and bled to defend. As I am earne&s;tly de&s;irous of clo&s;ing this corre&s;pondence. I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to what occa&s;ioned it. "An improper order," as you conceive, <Q>given by major Franks, my aid de camp, to the orderly &s;erjeant, your &s;on.</Q> Without examining into the propriety or impropriety of the order, about which we may differ, I perfectly agree with you, that the delivering of it in a haughty, imperious or in&s;olent manner, is blameable; and if the &s;erjeant had &s;o repre&s;ented it to me at the time, he would have had ju&s;tice. The affair is now out of my hands, and lies between the &s;erjeant and the major. If the latter hath behaved ami&s;s, it is his duty to make reparation. I tru&s;t I never &s;hall countenance pride or in&s;olence to inferiors in him, or any other officer under my command. Let me add, that di&s;putes, as to the rights of citizens and &s;oldiers, in conjunctures like the pre&s;ent, may be fatal to both.</P>

<P>After the reading of the&s;e letters, the judge advocate produced Mr. William Matlack, who, having affirmed, &s;ays,</P>
<P>Q. Did you attend at general Arnold's quarters in Philadelphia as an orderly &s;erjeant from the militia?</P>
<P>A. I did.</P>
<P>Q. Did you receive an order from major Franks, aid de camp to major general Arnold, while you attended in that &s;tation, to fetch a barber?</P>
<P>A. I received my fir&s;t order from a &s;ervant girl, who came and a&s;ked me if I was an orderly &s;erjeant? I told her I was. She &s;aid major Franks' orders were, that I &s;hould fetch his barber; which order I obeyed, as &s;uppo&s;ing it to come from him. Soon after my return, major Franks came to where I was &s;tationed, and a&s;ked me if I had been for his barber? I told him I had, but he was not at home, and that I had left the orders that were nece&s;&s;ary for his coming up, as &s;oon as he &s;hould come home. Major Franks then &s;aid, he did not believe he would come, and then went away. Some con&s;iderable time after, he came again, and &s;aid he did not believe he would come, and he believed I had better go again; to which I made no reply, but walking back in the entry, after a few minutes, I a&s;ked a Negro man if it was cu&s;tomary to give &s;uch orders to the orderly &s;erjeants? He &s;aid it was. I then replied, that major Franks ought to con&s;ider, that the militia could not be expected to do &s;uch duty, or words to that purport. Major Franks then came out of a back room, and &s;aid, &s;erjeant, I thought I had ordered you to go for my barber. I told him I had received no &s;uch order. He then a&s;ked me why I did not go? I told him I waited his orders. He then told me to go, and I told him, with his orders I would go, and did go. Major Franks, on my return, a&s;ked me if I had been? I told him I had, and left the &s;ame orders as before. In the morning I made a complaint to the general, nearly in them words; and he informed me it was cu&s;tomary for &s;erjeants to do &s;uch duty; and gave to me under&s;tand, not in an abrupt manner, that if I did not like &s;uch duty. I &s;hould not have come there.
<PB N="15" REF="017047_0014_0F9FBDC2C49BD328">The general &s;aid, at the time, that if major Franks had in&s;ulted me at the time be gave me the order, it was wrong, and he did not approve of that.</P>
<P>General Arnold's que&s;tion. Was any menial office impo&s;ed upon you, or upon any orderly &s;erjeant, to your knowledge?</P>
<P>A. I conceived the office that was impo&s;ed on me as menial; and the orderly &s;erjeant who &s;tood at the &s;ame time with me, belonging to the continental troops, complained of major Franks giving him a &s;mall bundle of paper in his hand, bidding him follow him, which he did; and upon his coming to a hou&s;e a &s;mall di&s;tance off, bid him give him the bundle of papers and return; which the man com|plained of to me, when he returned, as an in&s;ult.</P>

<P>BEFORE Plunket Flee&s;on, e&s;quire, one of the ju&s;tices of the peace in and for the &s;ame city, comes Je&s;&s;e Jordan; who, being duly &s;worn, depo&s;eth and &s;aith, That he, the deponent, on the &s;ixteenth of October la&s;t, and for &s;ome time before and after, was one of the waggon ma&s;ters for Che&s;ter county, in this &s;tate; that upon that day he received orders from Andrew Boyd, waggon ma&s;ter general for Che&s;ter county, to proceed to Philadelphia with a brigade of waggons, twelve in number, and there take orders from the quarter ma&s;ter in Philadelphia, and proceed in pur&s;uance of such orders as he &s;hould further direct, on the public &s;ervice; that the brigade was called out to perform their tour of duty, under the waggon law of this &s;tate; that he accordingly proceeded with the brigade to Philadelphia, drawing forage and rations on the way, on the written order of Andrew Boyd for that purpo&s;e; that in Philadelphia, this deponent applied to colonel John Mitchell, deputy quarter ma&s;ter general, for orders; that colonel John Mitchell ordered him to proceed to Mr. Ree&s;|burgh's office in Market-&s;treet, for orders to get a loading; that mr. Ree&s;burgh's orders were to go down to one Coleman's to get a load of flour and bread, and proceed towards camp; that deponent proceeded to Coleman's, and bad him prepare the loading, and deponent returned to his brigade and got it in readine&s;s to receive the loading; that &s;oon after one mr. Ru&s;k or Lu&s;k told the brigade they mu&s;t go to Eggharbour, and deponent came down Che&s;nut-&s;treet, and &s;topt the waggons before co|lonel Mitchell's door, and deponent enquired of him where they mu&s;t go, whether towards camp or to Eggharbour. Colonel Mitchell told them they might go to Eggharbour, and to go to general Arnold and receive orders from him; that he went accordingly to general Arnold, and &s;oon after received the orders from his aid de camp in writing, &s;igned David S. Franks, aid de camp; that in obedi|ence to tho&s;e orders, he proceeded with the brigade of waggons empty to the forks of Eggharbour; that until they arrived within about twenty or twenty five miles of the forks, the deponent was con|fident they were employed in the public &s;ervice of the continent, and expected they were to take in a loading of public &s;tores, and the fir&s;t cau&s;e of his doubting it was, that they were denied provi&s;i|ons by the commi&s;&s;ary of i&s;&s;ues there, who took copies of general Arnold's and mr. Boyd's orders, and &s;aid he was &s;ure it was private property they were going for; that if deponent had known they were going for private property, he would not willingly have gone, for that he was offered &pound; 4, a day, and to be found, or &pound; 6 : 5, and find him&s;elf, before he left home, to go to Indian river, but cho&s;e rather to go his tour of duty in the public employ; that he proceeded with the brigade to the forks of Eggharbour, drawing provi&s;ions and forage as before, after copies had been taken of the two or|ders before mentioned; that they loaded there with &s;ugar, tea, coffee, &s;ix &s;wivel guns, ca&s;ks of nails, broad cloths, linens, che&s;ts, &s;ail cloth, and &s;ome other articles, and brought them up to Philadel|phia; that they cro&s;&s;ed the river loaded, and delivered part of their loading on this &s;ide the ferry, and the remainder at Stephen Collins's in Second-&s;treet, by order of captain Moore, at the forks, to whom he was referred by the written orders of general Arnold, and who accompanied them up; that de|ponent gave no receipt for goods, nor took any on their delivery, captain Moore &s;uperintending the

Boyd that ju&s;tice Young, the waggon ma&s;ter general wanted to &s;ee him about this affair, and de&s;iring him to come to Philadelphia; but that when he left home he &s;et off for the head of Elk, not intending or thinking to come to Philadelphia, and after he was at the head of Elk, determined to come here for the &s;ake of getting his money; that colonel Mitchell told him the executive council wanted to &s;ee him; that he had no other rea&s;on to think the public were to pay him, but that he was ordered out in his tour of duty by mr. Boyd.</P>

<P>The judge advocate produced colonel John Mitchell's minute book, to &s;hew that the original entry, the 22d of October, 1778, of Je&s;&s;e Jordan's waggons, was altered, and the entry of their return from Egghar|bour, the 30th of October, 1778, was totally obliterated, and called on Timothy Matlack, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> to give evi|dence re&s;pecting the&s;e matters.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="017047_0019_0F9FBDC8BA4776D0">
Q. To mr. Matlack, Do you know any thing re&s;pecting the erazures and obliteration made in colonel Mit|chell's minute-book?</P>
<P>A. Having had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s with mr. Mitchell, which remained unfini&s;hed, he called to me when I pa&s;&s;ed by his door, while this matter was altercation, informed me, that the bu&s;ine&s;s that was depending between us, was now &s;ettled in &s;uch a manner, that he could pay the money, and that his clerk would pay it; and re|que&s;ted me to &s;tep into a back room, as he wanted to &s;ay &s;omething to me upon the &s;ubject of the certificate of the entry of the waggons, &s;aid to be employed by general Arnold, for tran&s;porting private goods; he endea|voured to induce me to believe, that the council of Penn&s;ylvania had, without a foundation, &s;u&s;pected that he had detained &s;ome certificates they had reque&s;ted of him re&s;pecting the&s;e waggons: he declared, that there was no entry of the di&s;charge of Je&s;&s;e Jordan contained in his books, nor no other entry, but the entry that he had furni&s;hed them with. The only entry that he had furni&s;hed to the council was in the&s;e words: "1778, Oct. 22, Je&s;&s;e Jordan w.m. 12 teams, Che&s;ter county, went to Egg-harbour, by the direction of general Arnold." This declaration &s;urpri&s;ed me, as I knew it otherwi&s;e, by &s;uch kind of evidence as I could not doubt. The evi|dence that I mean to allude to, is a conver&s;ation with Je&s;&s;e Jordan, who could have no knowledge of any u&s;e that could be made of it at that time, who declared, that he &s;aw and read in mr. Mitchell's memorandum-book, an entry of his di&s;charge from the public &s;ervice, which was after he returned from Egghabour; and as Jordan was a man of reputation, I could not doubt the fact. I told mr. Mitchell, that I had &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;u|&s;pect, that the copy he &s;ent to the council was not a genuine one. He declared it was. The acquaintance I had with the fact, induced &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e at the declaration, and I he&s;itated &s;ome time before I made him any re|ply. I told him, I &s;hould take it as a favour, if he would &s;hew me the book, in order that it might remove the &s;u&s;picions that were in my mind with re&s;pect to the fact. He expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome difficulty, on account of his not being able to lay his hand on the book at that time, and &s;ome rea&s;ons of that kind, which appeared to me to be trifling; and I &s;o told him. He ordered his clerk upon that to bring that book, and looked over the book in &s;uch a manner, as if he &s;ound &s;ome difficulty in recurring to the entry. I mentioned, it was made the twenty-&s;econd of October, and he would find it, if he turned to that date. He opened the book at the date, and read the entry. We were &s;itting clo&s;e together at the time, face to face, when he read the entry. I knew it con|tained the words of the certificate he had given; and he then laid the book upon the further end of the table, a|bout four feet from us. Upon his laying down the book, I ob&s;erved the alteration, and a&s;ked him to hand me the book, that I might look at it. With &s;ome he&s;itation, he handed it. Upon looking at it, I told him, the al|teration had been made preci&s;ely in the manner I was informed it was made. He then declared that the altera|tion was nothing material, and it was made by his order. As the book lay open, the obliteration &s;truck my eye; and &s;uch a one as I had never &s;een in a book before, according to my recollection: It &s;truck me, that that obli|teration was on the thirtieth of October, the la&s;t entry made that day, the day the waggons arrived from Egg-habour, which had cro&s;&s;ed after &s;un&s;et. After con&s;idering the matter &s;ome time, I determined to mention what I had &s;een to the council of Penn&s;ylvania, and mentioned it accordingly. Mr. Mitchell was &s;ent for, and reque&s;ted to bring the book of entries. He appeared and produced the book, and after he was examined, and much having been &s;aid on the &s;ubject, he acknowledged, that the entry on the twenty-&s;econd of October had been altered by his direction; that the note on the margin originally &s;tood, Gone to Egg-harbour, by order. The word <HI>gone</HI> being altered to the word <HI>went,</HI> and the word <HI>order,</HI> to the word <HI>direction,</HI> abbreviated. Whe|ther he acknowledged, that the words, <HI>of general Arnold,</HI> were added or not, I cannot a&s;certain. And he ac|knowledged, that the obliteration of the thirtieth of October, in his book, was ordered to be made by him, and intended to conceal and de&s;troy an entry of the di&s;charge of Je&s;&s;e Jordan, and his brigade, from public &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Q Did mr. Mitchell acknowledge, that the words, <HI>of general Arnold,</HI> &s;tood in the entry, previous to the al|teration being made?</P>
<P>A. I cannot recollect. At that day there appeared to be &s;ome difference in the ink, and I thought the words, <HI>of general Arnold,</HI> appeared to be added.</P>
<P>Q. court. Did mr. Mitchell &s;ay, or intimate, that the alteration of the entry of the twenty-&s;econd of Octo|ber, or the obliteration of the thirtieth of October, was made by the knowledge or advice of general Arnold.</P>
<P>A. I know of no circum&s;tance that &s;hould induce a &s;u&s;picion, that he had made the alteration either with the advice or knowledge of general Arnold.</P>
<P>Q. court. Did you enquire of mr. Mitchell what his motives were for making the alterations and obliteration!</P>
<P>A. Much was &s;aid upon the &s;ubject, and he put it off in this manner, that he wi&s;hed not to have it known that &s;uch an entry had been made, as he thought the entry was an improper one.</P>
<P>Q. Did he a&s;&s;ign any rea&s;on why he thought the entry an improper one?</P>
<P>A. I do not recollect that he ever a&s;&s;igned any clear, explicit rea&s;on on that &s;ubject. It appeared to me, that he was fearful, that if the waggons &s;hould be con&s;idered as being in public &s;ervice, he &s;hould be blamed for the manner they were employed.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="017047_0020_0F9FBDC996CEC690">
Q. by general Arnold. What were the rea&s;ons mr. Mitchell a&s;&s;igned to council for his making the alterati|ons and obliteration in the book?</P>
<P>A. After the acknowledgment of the alterations and obliteration, I believe there were not many que&s;tions put to him on that head; to tho&s;e that were, he an&s;wered eva&s;ively. The an&s;wers, preci&s;ely, I cannot recol|lect.</P>
<P>Q. by ditto. Did mr. Mitchell inform the pre&s;ident and council, that the rea&s;on of the alterations being made, was, that the fir&s;t entry was an improper one, and made by one of his clerks without his knowledge?</P>
<P>A. I am uncertain, whether he gave that as a rea&s;on to the council, but I am certain he gave that to me as a rea&s;on, and added, that it was a memorandum-book that lay in his office, and the entries were made in it by his clerk, without his knowledge, bu&s;ine&s;s being done in his office, as in other offices, by his clerks.</P>
<P>Q. court. Who were to pay for the&s;e waggons, and at what price?</P>
<P>A. The pay-rolls were made out at the common pay allowed for waggons in the public &s;ervice, and the pay|rolls were &s;ent to general Arnold, by order of mr. Mitchell, as I under&s;tood.</P>
<P>Q. by general Arnold. Did the pre&s;ident and council &s;end for mr. Jordan, with re&s;pect to the pay of the waggons?</P>
<P>A. Not that I know of or recollect. I believe the fact was, they de&s;ired mr. John Mitchell to &s;end for him to give evidence before the committee of congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Q. by do. Did Je&s;&s;e Jordan complain to the pre&s;ident and council that he was refu&s;ed payment, previous to their de&s;iring colonel Mitchell to &s;end for him, to give evidence before the committee of congre&s;s?</P>
<P>A. The general complaint re&s;pecting the employment of the waggons was made to council by An|drew Boyd waggon ma&s;ter of Che&s;ter county, through James Young waggon ma&s;ter of the &s;tate. The council expected that Je&s;&s;e Jordan would be in the city in con&s;equence of their reque&s;t to John Mitchell to &s;end for him, and did not &s;end for him that I know of or recollect. When Mr. Jordan came to the city, information was given to the council of his being in the city, and a reference being had to the depo&s;ition of Jordan, it will appear the manner of his coming to the city. After the de|po&s;ition was taken, application was made by him to council, to know how he was to receive his money? and he complained of the ill treatment he had received by a threat from mr. Mitchell of being confined. The council conceiving them&s;elves bound to take care that the waggoners had their money, advanced to Je&s;&s;e Jordan a &s;um to pay tho&s;e who were in the greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ity, conceiving that general Arnold was bound to pay, and that a price would be received of him equal to the price of private hire, and the money &s;o advanced &s;tands charged accordingly.</P>
<P>Q. by general Arnold. Did Je&s;&s;e Jordan at any time complain to the pre&s;ident and council that I had refu&s;ed him payment of his account which he had pre&s;ented to me for the hire of his waggons?</P>
<P>A. No otherwi&s;e that I knew of, but by his depo&s;ition which is before the court, and his applica|tion, which I have mentioned already, how he &s;hould get it?</P>
<P>Q. by do. Was not the complaint re&s;pecting the waggons in&s;tituted by the de&s;ire of the pre&s;ident and council, or &s;ome one of them.</P>
<P>A. It was not, to the be&s;t of my knowledge.</P>
<P>Q. by do. Do you know nearly the amount which Je&s;&s;e Jordan charged at fir&s;t for the hire of his brigade of waggons?</P>
<P>A. No otherwi&s;e than what appears by the original pay rolls, which were lodged in my office by Andrew Boyd, and which I now deliver to the court.</P>

<P>Q. by ditto. Did not the pre&s;ident and council advi&s;e mr. Jordan to charge eighty pounds for the hire of each waggon, and to &s;end the account to the attorney-general to pro&s;ecute?</P>
<P>A. To an&s;wer the que&s;tion generally, I &s;ay, not that I know; but, in particular, I believe they advi&s;ed him to commence an action for the recovery of the pay, which was allowed for waggons in private &s;ervice, and I my&s;elf told him, that ten pounds a day was the price paid in New-Jer&s;ey for that kind of &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Q. by ditto. Did the pre&s;ident and council write an official letter to mr. Je&s;&s;e Jordan, with the&s;e words: <HI>We make no doubt but you will be allowed eighty pounds for the hire of each waggon;</HI> and ordering, or advi&s;ing him to &s;end the account to the attorney-general to pro&s;ecute?</P>
<P>A. As I had no expectation of being que&s;tioned concerning a matter of that nature, and having none of the papers pre&s;ent, it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould give a preci&s;e an&s;wer with re&s;pect to the words of a letter written &s;o

<P>Major general Arnold acknowledged, that captain Moore, to whom Je&s;&s;e Jordan was ordered to apply for orders at Eggharbour, is the &s;ame captain Moore, who is named in the protection, as commanding the &s;chooner Charming Nancy.</P>
<P>The judge advocate having produced his evidence with re&s;pect to the &s;everal charges exhibited again&s;t ge|neral Arnold, the general was de&s;ired to proceed in his defence; who called on Timothy Matlack. <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> and a&s;ked the three following que&s;tions:</P>
<P>Q. Did not captain Shewell take the oath of allegiance to the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, agreeable to law, by the fir&s;t day of June, 1778?</P>
<P>A. I do not know.</P>

<P>Col. THOMAS PROCTOR, maketh oath, That in January la&s;t, col. North received a let|ter from Mr. Robert Shewell, in which he reque&s;ted col. North and col. Proctor would procure him a pa&s;s to go to Virginia to &s;ettle with Stacey Hepburn; that in March, after mr. Shewell had returned from Virginia, where he had gone by permi&s;&s;ion of general Scott, he informed deponent of his intentions of coming with his family from the city to live, and that he had taken a hou&s;e in Maryland to live in; that the rea&s;on of mr. Shewell's not leaving the city &s;ooner, was, becau&s;e of the indi&s;po&s;ition of mrs. Shewell; that in May he received a letter from mr.

Proctor did not apply for. On the 3d of June, mr. Shewell came to head-quarters, and in|formed deponent, he had come for a protection for his ve&s;&s;el, that he had loaded her with a cargo &s;uitable the army, and procured a captain to &s;erve him, and afterwards procured a pa&s;s from general Arnold, as he under&s;tood; that he doth not know of any application being made to general Wa&s;hington for a pa&s;s; that the major general of the day, and not the commander in chief, is the proper officer to make application to for pa&s;&s;ports.</P>

<P>DAVID BEVERIDGE, of the city of Philadelphia, merchant, doth &s;olemnly affirm in the above cau&s;e, that mr.

Shirtliff had divulged the &s;cheme of the voyage to &s;everal per&s;ons, and &s;poken too publicly of it) told him he could not be concerned in the matter, and ab&s;olutely declined it, having ju&s;t before this got out of jail, where he had been kept for &s;ome time, by order of general Howe; that deponent, when he engaged to be part owner of
<PB N="24" REF="017047_0023_0F9FBDCD5ED3B558">&s;aid &s;chooner, called on governor M^c Kinley, who was lately from Wilmington, then a pri&s;oner in Phila|delphia, and a&s;ked him, what he thought of &s;ending into Wilmington a cargo of &s;alt, and that the gover|nor &s;aid, it would be very acceptable, but in his &s;ituation, being a pri&s;oner, on parole, he did not choo&s;e to &s;ay any thing on the &s;ubject; that deponent a&s;ked the governor, if he could not give them &s;omething like a pa&s;&s;port, certifying the intention of the voyage, in ca&s;e of accident, which the governor, for the afore|&s;aid rea&s;on, declined; that affirmant advi&s;ed the &s;aid company to load her &s;o deep with &s;alt, as to prevent her taking in goods on freight, the refu&s;al of which might cau&s;e a &s;u&s;picion of their intention, in ca&s;e of her not being fully loaded; that the company accordingly purcha&s;ed a large quantity of &s;alt, and put it on board; that affirmant under&s;tood &s;alt was of &s;o little value at New-York, that no body would carry it there for nothing; that at the time of the enemy's leaving &s;aid city, very high prices were given for car|rying of goods upon freight, and great numbers of ve&s;&s;els, or the owners thereof, were very de&s;irous of having their ve&s;&s;els employed in that way; that he is perfectly &s;atisfied, it would have been much to the advantage of the &s;aid company, if they had intended going to New-York, to have thrown the &s;aid &s;alt o|yerboard, and carried goods upon freight, as he has no doubt at all, but the money they might have receiv|ed for freight, would have been of much greater value than the &s;alt when arrived at New-York, and he thinks of equal value with the &s;aid ve&s;&s;el; that Robert Shewell and William Shirtliff, of the &s;tate of Penn|&s;ylvania, were the per&s;ons who con&s;ulted him on the abovementioned &s;cheme; that they appeared to be owners of the &s;aid &s;chooner, as they acted upon all occa&s;ions as &s;uch, both as to planning the voyage, load|ing her with their goods, and fitting her out; that at the time of purcha&s;ing the &s;aid &s;alt, it &s;old for about three &s;hllings and nine-pence per bu&s;hel, but at New-York it was of no value, and &s;tore-room would not be given for it, and much had been given away there as he under&s;tood, and that no ve&s;&s;els at all carried &s;alt to New-York when the fleet went; that he has no rea&s;on at all to &s;uppo&s;e it was their intention to go in|to any port in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy; that he went on board the &s;aid ve&s;&s;el and viewed her, but &s;aw no guns on board her.</P>

<P>Q. to major Franks. Were you pre&s;ent at ju&s;tice Pa&s;chall's when major Clark&s;on made oath to the contents of the paper you have heard read?</P>
<P>A. I was; and that is the paper which major Clark&s;on &s;igned, it having been written by him.</P>
<P>Q. by general Arnold to major Franks. What do you know about &s;he &s;hutting up the &s;hops and &s;tores in Philadelpia?</P>
<P>A. The day after I came into town, which was the day general Arnold came, general Jo&s;eph Reed, who is now pre&s;ident of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, and my&s;elf met. He told me that they were &s;elling goods in town, and advi&s;ed me to &s;end a crier round to prohibit the &s;ale of goods. I at fir&s;t agreed to it, but afterwards thought it was doing more than I had a right to. I met him again, and told him that I would put it off until general Arnold came. When general Arnold came to town, general Reed came to his quarters, and upon con&s;ulting with him, wrote a proclamation, which I think was the &s;ame that was publi&s;hed, with &s;ome alterations.</P>
<P>Q. court. Were the alterations made in it, material?</P>
<P>A. I believe not.</P>
<P>Q. Are you po&s;itive that general Reed drew up the proclamation?</P>
<P>A. I &s;aw general Reed at the table drawing it up; general Arnold and mr. Boudinott were in the room at the time.</P>
<P>Q. by general Arnold. Do you know of my having given licences to purcha&s;e goods, though applica|tions were made by my intimate friends for them?</P>
<P>A. I do not know of your intimate friends having a&s;ked for licences to purcha&s;e goods; but I know that many applications were refu&s;ed, and I know of no licences being granted to any per&s;on to pur|cha&s;e goods.</P>
<P>Q. by do. Do you know at what time the &s;hops and &s;tores were opened, and every body permitted to purcha&s;e?</P>

<P><PB N="27" REF="017047_0026_0F9FBDD03B8FECC0">
Q. by general Arnold. Do you know of any articles being laid by, except &s;ome trifling articles for my own u&s;e, the u&s;e of my family, for general Wa&s;hington, and for one or two other officers?</P>
<P>A. No; except two pipes of wine, which were afterwards drank in the family!</P>
<P>Q. by general Arnold. Do you know whether the two pipes of wine were purcha&s;ed or laid by previ|ous to the &s;hops being opened?</P>
<P>A. I don't recollect that they were purcha&s;ed before the &s;hops were opened.</P>
<P>Q. court. Do you know whether any of the articles that were laid by, were taken from the &s;hops previous to the legal opening of them?</P>
<P>A. I do not.</P>
<P>Q. by general Arnold. Were not all the articles of clothing of con&s;equence that were &s;upplied me, which are mentioned to have been for general Wa&s;hington and &s;everal other officers, as well as my&s;elf, &s;upplied by the clothier general or his agent?</P>
<P>A. I believe they were.</P>

<P>Q. by the court. Do you know whether general Arnold purcha&s;ed any part of the Charming Nancy or her cargo?</P>
<P>A. I do not of my own knowledge; but I have heard general Arnold &s;ay he did, and I have al&s;o heard Mr. Seagrove &s;ay he did.</P>
<P>Q. court. Was it previous or &s;ub&s;equent to general Arnold's granting the pa&s;s?</P>

<P>The court met according to adjournment.</P>
<P>Major general Arnold adverted to the fir&s;t charge, and proceeded to produce evidence re&s;pecting it.</P>
<P>Q. by general Arnold to Timothy Matlack, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> Do you know whether the owners of the Charm|ing Nancy voluntarily remained with the enemy?</P>
<P>A. Mr. Shewell did as I under&s;tand. I under&s;tood it from him.</P>
<P>Q. by do. Did Mr. Shewel a&s;&s;ign his rea&s;on for remaining with the ememy?</P>
<P>A. If he a&s;&s;igned any rea&s;ons I do not recollect what they were?</P>
<P>Lieutenant colonel Hamilton being &s;worn,</P>
<P>Q. by general Arnold. Do you know Mr. Seagrove's general political character?</P>
<P>A. I have heard it frequently di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and very different opinions entertained of it. Many were of opinion that he was warmly attached to the American cau&s;e, and others that he was not. He had a com|mercial connection of a very delicate nature with a mr. M^c Evers, reputedly a di&s;affected per&s;on, which was &s;uppo&s;ed by tho&s;e acquainted with him to have re&s;trained his political conduct, and made him le&s;s active in favour of America than he otherwi&s;e would have been; others con&s;idered him as a man of addre&s;s, who wi&s;hed to &s;tand fair with both parties, though in reality more friendly to the oppo&s;ite party than to us. I have heard &s;everal liberal men &s;peak of his &s;ituation with a degree of compa&s;&s;ion, as producing an oppo&s;ition be|tween his principles and his private connections. My own opinion of him was favourable, from a general idea of his integrity, and from a particular circum&s;tance which happened as our troops were evacuating New York. I was among the la&s;t of our army that left the city; the enemy was then on our right flank, between us and the main body of our army. At about three miles from town, on our march out, mr. Sea|grove was at a hou&s;e, the name of which I forget, in company with &s;everal ladies and gentlemen, he left them, and came up to me with &s;trong appearances of anxiety in his looks, informed me that the ene|my had landed at Harlaam, and were pu&s;hing acro&s;s the i&s;land, advi&s;ed us to keep as much to the left as po&s;&s;ible, to avoid being intercepted; the information he gave us, I believe, was not true, as to the place where he &s;aid the enemy had landed, they having in fact landed in a different place, but he could not have framed it for any bad purpo&s;e, becau&s;e the advice he gave us mu&s;t have been good and proper in any event, as it was known that the enemy had not landed any troops in the north river on our left, by inclining to which cour&s;e we &s;tood the be&s;t chance of avoiding that body which had landed on our right. The favourable impre&s;&s;ions I before had of mr. Seagrove were confirmed by this incident, not &s;o much from the nature of the tran&s;action, as from an appearance of &s;incerity and concern &s;trongly pictur|ed
<PB N="28" REF="017047_0027_0F9FBDD108179438">in his countenance; which had the more weight as he remained in the city, and might have run &s;ome ri&s;que from what he did. At an early period of the war he entered into an independent company, but the company afterwards came to nothing.</P>
<P>Q. by do. Has not the political conduct of Mr. Seagrove &s;ince confirmed the favourable impre&s;&s;ions you had before of him?</P>
<P>A. It has, &s;o far as it has come to my knowledge.</P>
<P>Q. by ditto to major Franks. Do you know Mr. Seagrove's general political character?</P>
<P>A. I knew nothing of his political general character of my own knowledge, previous to your giving the protection for the Charming Nancy; but I have under&s;tood that he was con&s;idered as a whig. Since that period I have been in actual &s;ervice with him.</P>
<P>Q. by do. Do you know the political general character of the per&s;ons who were owners of the Charm|ing Nancy, previous to my giving the protection for her?</P>
<P>A. I never knew either mr. Shirtliff or mr. Con&s;table before I went to Philadelphia, or &s;aw them in my life before, that I remember. I knew mr. Shewell before the protection was granted, and always &s;uppo&s;ed him to be well affected to America. He was in one of the militia companies in Philadelphia, &s;ome time before the enemy got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>Q. court. Did he tell you his rea&s;ons for &s;taying in Philadelphia?</P>
<P>A. He did.</P>
<P>Q. court. What were they?</P>
<P>A. The impracticability of removing at the time; his wife having been brought to bed and dangerou&s;ly ill. He told me frequently that his intentions were to remove out of town.</P>
<P>Q. by general Arnold. Did captain Shewell inform you that he had taken the oath of allegiance to the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, previous to my granting him the pa&s;s?</P>
<P>A. I think he did, and &s;aid previous to the time directed by the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania; and I under|&s;tood from him that he had taken it out of town, and had a certificate of it.</P>
<P>Q. by the court. Did he inform you at what place and before whom he took the oath of allegiance?</P>
<P>A. He did not that I remember.</P>
<P>Q. by general Arnold. Did you under&s;tand, at the time captain Shewell applied to me for the protec|tion, that he produced to me a certificate of his having taken the oath of allegiance to the &s;tate of Penn|&s;ylvania, agreeable to law?</P>
<P>A. I don't know what pa&s;&s;ed at the time, but I under&s;tood from him at that time, that he had a cer|tificate of that nature.</P>
<P>Q. court. Did you under&s;tand how long mr. Shewell had been out of Philadelphia before he obtained the protection from general Arnold?</P>
<P>A. He was time enough out to take the oath of allegiance to the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, as I under|&s;tood from him, which was ordered to be taken, I think, by the fir&s;t of June. I know that mr. Shewell gave his vote at an election in Philadelphia, which he would not have been permitted to give, had he not produced a certificate of his having taken the oath of allegiance by the fir&s;t of June.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fifth charge, major Franks produced in behalf of the general &s;ays, That he went to colonel Mitchell's by de&s;ire of general Arnold, to know whether he could &s;pare him &s;ome waggons to tran&s;port &s;ome goods that were in danger of falling into the enemy's hands at Eggharbour. He was told, either by colonel Mitchell or his clerk, that waggons could not be &s;pared at that time, but that &s;oon it might happen, as they expected a number of waggons in town; he brought that an&s;wer to general Arnold, and &s;ome days after general Arnold told him to go to the quarter ma&s;ter's, to enquire and &s;ee if po&s;&s;ible the waggon ma&s;ter who was to conduct a brigade of waggons for him, and to order them to go to Egg|harbour, or the forks, and there to take a captain Moore's directions, re&s;pecting what he was to do. When he got to the office he wrote a letter ordering the waggon ma&s;ter &s;o to do, and &s;igned it officially; after which the waggon ma&s;ter went.</P>
<P>Q. by general Arnold. Were not frequent applications made for the waggons before I procured them?</P>
<P>A. I went once my&s;elf, as I have &s;aid before, and I believe major Clark&s;on went once or twice, and I believe you went your&s;elf. It appeared to me &s;everal applications had been made for them.</P>
<P>Q. by do. Did you not view the reque&s;t made for the waggons of a private nature, and not officially?</P>
<P>A. I under&s;tood you were to pay for the waggons for the tran&s;portation of the goods, and that it was a matter of favour in colonel Mitchell to let you have them.</P>
<P>Q. de. How happened it that you &s;igned the order to Je&s;&s;e Jordan officially?</P>
<P>A. I had no particular directions from you &s;o to do; that from cu&s;tom I always &s;igned aid de camp at
<PB N="29" REF="017047_0028_0F9FBDD1D1B74358">the end of my name; I my&s;elf might have probably thought at that time, that it might have been the means of his executing the order with more alacrity, as di&s;patch was nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Q. by gen. Arnold. Do you know of my &s;ending to colonel Mitchell for the account of the hire of the waggons, previous to any charge or publication made again&s;t me?</P>
<P>A. I do; I went once or twice my&s;elf, and I believe you &s;ent major Clark&s;on.</P>
<P>Q. by do. When I went to camp in February 1779, was not money left with major Clark&s;on for the purpo&s;e of paying for the waggons, and orders given to him accordingly?</P>
<P>A. I think, before we &s;et out to go to camp, the waggon ma&s;ter brought an account again&s;t you for the hire of the waggons. You told the man to get it certified by colonel Mitchell, to come in the after|noon with the certificate, and you would pay him. Whether he came in the afternoon or not, I cannot &s;ay; but we &s;et out for camp, and you informed me that you had left money with major Clark&s;on to di&s;|charge that account. Clark&s;on told you when you returned, that he had not paid the money, as the man had not called, or that he could not find him.</P>
<P>Q. court. How long was the account pre&s;ented for the hire of the waggons, before you &s;et out for camp?</P>
<P>A. I believe two or three days.</P>
<P>Q. by court. Was that the fir&s;t time the account had been pre&s;ented to general Arnold?</P>
<P>A. I think it was, as there had been frequent applications made for the account, and it could not be procured.</P>
<P>Q. by ditto. Did you at any time, through the cour&s;e of the tran&s;action, under&s;tand that general Ar|nold officially employed the&s;e waggons?</P>
<P>A. I under&s;tood that general Arnold was to pay for the waggons; that he got them as a favour, and that they were not to tran&s;port public &s;tores, but private property for him&s;elf and friends, and that he did not order them officially.</P>
<P>Q. by ditto. When you went to colonel Mitchell for the waggons, did you inform him that they were wanted to tran&s;port private property?</P>
<P>A. I did. I told him that the goods were in imminent danger, and told him, that the lo&s;s of &s;o many goods would be a lo&s;s to the continent, as we wanted goods.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the la&s;t charge again&s;t the general, Mr. John Hall was produced, who was &s;worn.</P>
<P>Q. Did you make the alterations in colonel Mitchell's minute book, of the twenty-&s;econd of Octo|ber, and the obliteration in the &s;ame book, of the thirtieth of October, re&s;pecting Je&s;&s;e Jordan's wag|gon?</P>
<P>A. I did.</P>
<P>Q. Did you make the original entry your&s;elf with or without orders?</P>
<P>A. I made it my&s;elf without orders.</P>
<P>Q. Did you make the entry in the margin re&s;pecting the waggon?</P>
<P>A. I did.</P>
<P>Q. With or without orders?</P>
<P>A. Without any orders.</P>
<P>Q. What was the original entry?</P>
<P>A. As far as I can recollect, it was, Gone to Eggharbour, by order; or went, I am not certain which.</P>
<P>Q. Were the words, <HI>of general Arnold</HI> mentioned in the fir&s;t entry in the margin?</P>
<P>A. They were not.</P>
<P>Q. When was the addition of the words, <HI>of general Arnold</HI> made, and what was the rea&s;on of it?</P>
<P>A. It was made in the cour&s;e of one day, or two days, and it was made to a&s;&s;i&s;t my memory.</P>
<P>Q. Did you make the alteration with or without orders?</P>
<P>A. I made it without orders.</P>
<P>Q. What was the rea&s;on of your making the alteration?</P>
<P>A. The fir&s;t rea&s;on was, I thought it was not good Engli&s;h, and when I came to reflect on it, I made the alteration, thinking I worded the entry improper.</P>
<P>Q. What was the rea&s;on of your changing the word order to direction?</P>
<P>A. I can give no rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P>Q. To whom did general Arnold make application for waggons to go to Eggharbour?</P>
<P>A. Major Franks or major Clark&s;on came to colonel Mitchell's office, where I was, and made the ap|plication to me, in colonel Mitchell's ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Q. In what manner was the application made?</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="017047_0029_0F9FBDD2B7F5BEA0">
A. The application was, that he, general Arnold, wanted a brigade of waggons, and to &s;end the waggon ma&s;ter to him for directions: It was not made in writing.</P>
<P>Q. Did either major Franks or major Clark&s;on mention for what purpo&s;e the waggons were wanted?</P>
<P>A. Not that I remember.</P>
<P>Q. court. Did colonel Mitchell &s;peak to you re&s;pecting the waggons, previous to the application?</P>
<P>A. He did not.</P>
<P>Q. court. Did he conver&s;e with you on the &s;ubject afterwards?</P>
<P>A. Not until &s;ome time a January.</P>
<P>Q. court. What pa&s;&s;ed between you then?</P>
<P>A. When Jordan came to town, &s;ometime in January, and had his pay roll made out, colonel Mit|chell told him, he mu&s;t go to general Arnold, and get his pay. I then turned to the book, and &s;aw he had been from the twenty &s;econd to the thirtieth of October. Colonel Mitchell told me, that it &s;hould not be there at all, and had no bu&s;ine&s;s in the book, as general Arnold was to pay the hire of the waggons, and he was angry with me on account of it, upon which I took up my pen and obliterated the entry of the thirtieth of October, determining in my own mind, that col. Mitchell &s;hould never give me a frown for it again, and that it &s;hould not appear in the book.</P>
<P>Q. court. Did you under&s;tand why the hire of the waggons &s;hould become a private charge to general Arnold?</P>
<P>A. I then under&s;tood by colonel Mitchell's mentioning what I have &s;aid to me, that they had been &s;ent to tran&s;port property that was not the public's.</P>
<P>Q. Had you at any time any conver&s;ation with Je&s;&s;e Jordan, or any of the waggoners employed in that affair, on the &s;ubject?</P>
<P>A. Not until after Jordan returned from Eggharbour: When he returned, I went and made a mark of his return, and told him to make his pay roll out: He &s;aid, he had not time to do it then, but would when he came to town again.</P>
<P>Q. court. What conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed between you and Jordan when he returned again?</P>
<P>A. Col. Mitchell was in the office when he produced his pay roll; he handed the pay roll to colo|nel Mitchell, who looked at it. Colonel Mitchell turned to me, and a&s;ked, whether Jordan had receiv|ed any orders for forage? I an&s;wered, No; and he a&s;ked Jordan him&s;elf whether he had received any forage? he &s;aid, he had got an order for forage, and on being a&s;ked by colonel Mitchell from whom, he &s;aid, from colonel Hilzeimer at the &s;tables. The colonel &s;ent up to mr. Hilzeimer, to know what number of days he had got. I don't recollect the number of days that he got an order for from mr. Hil|zeimer, but colonel Mitchell mentioned, that he mu&s;t make out his pay roll at the price, as if he had got no forage, and was angry at his having got forage, and that general Arnold was to pay him, and de&s;ired him to go and repay mr. Hilzeimer the amount of what forage he had received from him. Jordan, as far as I recollect, made out another pay roll.</P>
<P>Q. court. Had you ever any conver&s;ation with general Arnold, about the waggons?</P>
<P>A. No.</P>
<P>Q. Did general Arnold know of any of the&s;e entries being made, or the alteration of them, previous to your doing it?</P>
<P>A. Not to my knowledge.</P>
<P>Q. court. Did general Arnold ever &s;ee the book, to your knowledge?</P>
<P>A. Not to my knowledge; it was a book that lay on the de&s;k in common, to make memorandums.</P>
<P>Q. court. Did Je&s;&s;e Jordan, or any of the waggoners employed at that time, tell you whether they con&s;idered them&s;elves in public or private employ?</P>
<P>A. I don't recollect that he or any of them did.</P>
<P>Q. court. Was the original entry in the margin the u&s;ual mode of entry?</P>
<P>A. I do not recollect.</P>
<P>Q. by general Arnold. Did I not make &s;everal applications for the waggons before they were &s;ent?</P>
<P>A. I do not recollect that you did.</P>
<P>Q. When was the obliteration made?</P>
<P>A. About the latter end of January.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know of the council of Penn&s;ylvania making application for a tran&s;cript of the entries?</P>
<P>A. I did hear colonel Mitchel &s;ay &s;omething about it, but not previous to the obliteration being made.</P>
<P>Q. Did colonel Mitchell or any other per&s;on direct you to make the alterations or obliterations?</P>

<P>The general, with re&s;pect to the &s;econd charge, produced a depo&s;ition of Elias Boudinot, which being read, in as follows:</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="deposition">
<P>Mr. Boudinot's &s;tate of facts, relative to general Arnold's &s;hutting up the &s;hops in Philadelphia, in 1778, as far as he can recollect, given at general Arnold's reque&s;t.</P>
<P>IT will be nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e, that the tran&s;actions referred to happened eighteen months ago; &s;ince which I have been afflicted with a &s;evere indi&s;po&s;ition for ten months: therefore cannot but &s;peak with great di&s;&s;idence as to particular circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Being at Philadelphia when general Arnold took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city, I called on him &s;everal times, and found him in a &s;tate of health, which I thought rendered him unequal to the fatigue of his then &s;tation. He was much crowded with bu&s;ine&s;s, and I ventured to warn him of the ill con&s;equences of &s;o much attention to it, and advi&s;ed to &s;everal regulations I thought nece&s;&s;ary. He &s;hewed me certain re&s;olutions of congre&s;s relative to the goods, that &s;hould be found in the city, until the arrival of joint committees of congre&s;s and the executive council, and the public officers who were to purcha&s;e for the army, or &s;omething to this effect.</P>
<P>I advi&s;ed the general to the i&s;&s;uing of public orders, to prevent the &s;elling of goods until the arrival of the committees afore&s;aid, and al&s;o to nominate a number of the citizens of e&s;tabli&s;hed character, to &s;uperintend and regulate the little affairs of the citizens in the mean while, &s;o as to prevent his being perplexed with the civil as well as military department; and I mentioned &s;everal gentlemen, who&s;e political characters I thought he might depend on. While we were talking, mr. Jo&s;eph Reed, (now his excellency the pre&s;ident of the &s;tate) then al&s;o a member of congre&s;s, came in and told the general he had been making a few memorandums of &s;ome little matters which he (mr. Reed) thought
<PB N="32" REF="017047_0031_0F9FBDD5CBFB8140">nece&s;&s;ary for his attention, and which otherwi&s;e might e&s;cape the general's notice. Mr. Reed then read them from a paper he produced, and I immediately told him they were very &s;imilar to what I had ju&s;t been recommending to the general, and repeated to him what I had been &s;aying. He re|plied, that he had the &s;ub&s;tance of it down, except one or two points, which one of us immediately added to the paper he had. The general then begged, that we would draw up what we thought nece&s;&s;ary, and he would have it printed. Mr. Reed then &s;at down and drew up a draught of what he thought proper, and I believe I corrected it, but am not certain. I cannot with certainty a&s;cer|tain the particulars of this draught, but and clear in my own mind, that it contained the amount of what we both advi&s;ed the general to, and particularly to the prevention of the &s;ale of goods, until the orders of congre&s;s were complied with. And my rea&s;on for this is, that I well remember to have advi&s;ed &s;everal friends to be careful not to &s;ell the next day, as &s;uch a public prohibition had gone to the pre&s;s.</P>

<P>With re&s;pect to the la&s;t charge, the general produced colonel Mitchel, d. q. m. g. who being &s;worn, &s;ays, About the middle of October la&s;t, general Arnold &s;ent for me; on my waiting on him, he informed me he wanted ten or twelve waggons to go to Eggharbour to bring &s;ome goods, which were in danger of fall|ing into the enemy's hands, and that he would pay the expence. I informed him, I had none at that time could be &s;pared from public &s;ervice; but when there was, I would &s;end the waggon ma&s;ter to him. He a&s;ked me, if there was not waggons &s;ent to Eggharbour with forage and provi&s;ions, and if they could not bring a load back for him. I an&s;wered, yes, there were &s;everal &s;ent, but I believed they were now re|turning, that if I had occa&s;ion to &s;end any more with either provi&s;ion or forage, and there was no public &s;torm to bring up, they might load for him, and it would &s;ave the public half the expence, as he mu&s;t pay the hire back; this he &s;eemed plea&s;ed with, but not having occa&s;ion to &s;end any of the articles above-mentioned, the general &s;ent to me &s;everal times to know, if I could let him have the waggons; my an|&s;wer was, he &s;hould have the fir&s;t could be &s;pared without injury to the public &s;ervice. On the 22d of October, Je&s;&s;e Jordan, a waggon ma&s;ter from Cha&s;ter county, came to town with twelve towns; a me|morandum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> which was part in the memorandum book. A con&s;iderable quantity of &s;tores being for|warded to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> river, and &s;ome continental terms coming in, which were not expected, and the gene|ral being de&s;irous to have the waggons &s;ent, to &s;ave the property at Eggharbour from falling into the hands of the enemy, I de&s;ired mr. Jordan to go to general Arnold, who wanted him to go to Egghar|bour, and that he would pay him, and give him his directions. Mr. Jordan accordingly want from me, and, I believe, called on the general. From that time I heard nothing farther on the &s;ubject, till mr. Jordan had returned, when he was told to call on general Arnold for his pay; in an&s;wer to which he &s;aid he would not &s;tay at that time to make out a pay roll, but would return and get his pay, or words to that effect. And after he was gone home &s;ome time, I a&s;ked one of the clerks if he heard whether Jordan was paid by general Arnold. I think he &s;aid he did not know. I afterwards &s;aw the general, who told me the waggon ma&s;ter had not called on him for his pay, and de&s;ired when I &s;aw him I would let him know, or words to that purpo&s;e. I de&s;ired my clerk to be careful that mr. Jordan's hire was not paid in my office, and to pay no rolls without my approbation. From this time, about the beginning of November, I heard nothing of the matter that I can recollect, till the &s;ecretary of the executive council wrotes me for what information I could give them re&s;pecting the waggons &s;ent by general Arnold to Eggharbour, to which reque&s;t I gave the following an&s;wer, dated the 19th January.</P>

<P>I THIS day received an order &s;igned by the &s;ecretary of the honourable council of this &s;tate, reque&s;ting I would give them information re&s;pecting a brigade of waggons under the conduct of Je&s;&s;e Jordan, waggon ma&s;ter from Che&s;ter county; the council having been informed that I &s;ent them to Eggharbour to convey private property to this city. I &s;hall at all times be ready to give your excellency and the honourable council every information you think nece&s;&s;ary for the good of the public, or this &s;tate in particular, which relates to my office, or the bu&s;ine&s;s of the department; as I have no de&s;ire to conceal any part of my conduct as a public officer, having conducted the bu&s;ine&s;s under my direction with integrity and ju&s;tice to the public. The following are the &s;tate of the facts required, viz. In the month of October la&s;t, at
<PB N="33" REF="017047_0032_0F9FBDD702FF0378">the time the enemy had landed &s;ome troops at Eggharbour, general Arnold de&s;ired I would furni&s;h him with a brigade of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> which he wanted to &s;end to the Jer&s;eys, and that he would pay the hire of them, they being wanted to remove property, which was in imminent danger of falling into the enemy's hands. I informed him he &s;hould have the waggon ma&s;ter of the fir&s;t brigade, which could be &s;pared from the public &s;ervice, &s;ent to him, when he would give him &s;uch orders as he plea&s;ed. Accordingly, about the 22d of October mr. Jordan was &s;ent to the general to receive his directions, having at that time &s;ent forward a large &s;upply for the army, &amp;c. When Jordan returned, he was de&s;ired to make out his account to general Arnold, to be paid. I do not know where the loading was &s;tored, nor who&s;e property it was, further than what is before mentioned. A greater number of continental teams corning in than I expect|ed, enabled me to comply with general Arnold's reque&s;t without any inconvenience to the &s;ervice. If there is any thing further in which I can &s;atisfy your excellency and the council, I will wait on you at any time with plea&s;ure.</P>

<P>Which I afterwards learned they &s;ent a copy of to general Arnold. His excellency the pre&s;ident and coun|cil reque&s;ted general Greene to direct that mr. Jordan, a waggon ma&s;ter in his &s;ervice might be &s;ent for; on which I &s;ent two expre&s;&s;es to enquire if he was in the quarter ma&s;ter's department, and if &s;o, to &s;end him up to wait on the pre&s;ident and council; but they returned with information that he was not in the &s;ervice. This I informed his excellency of, who, if I can recollect, and to the be&s;t of my memory and recollection, &s;aid the council had laid the matter before congre&s;s, and therefore it was not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end again for him. I offered to &s;end any orders of his, by expre&s;s or otherwi&s;e, as he thought proper. The next I heard of this affair was on the 30th of January, when mr. Jordan came to town, and called at my office. I told him to go to general Arnold for his pay, that I had nothing to do with it, and a&s;ked him why he did not call for it long before that time. He an&s;wered he had been &s;ick, and could not come to town, and I think &s;aid he was &s;ick when he returned from Eggharbour. I told him he mu&s;t wait on the pre&s;ident and council before he left town; that they had &s;ent for him, and it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould call on them. I al&s;o a&s;ked him if he had made any complaints to colonel Boyd, and for what rea&s;on he did make &s;uch complaints. He &s;aid, he had made none, nor had he &s;een colonel Boyd &s;ince his return from Eggharbour; but he believed &s;ome of the waggoners had made &s;ome complaints which he had never &s;een. On this he went from me, as I believe, to general Arnold, and returned with a note from him to me, as follows, viz.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This an&s;wer was &s;ent directly to the general. Whether mr. Jordan went to him then or not, I do not recollect; but on producing his pay roll, I found he had charged as if he received forage, which &s;urprized me much, not having been informed or known he had drawn any forage for more than one day; on which I &s;ent to the forage ma&s;ter to know the truth of it, who returned me an account that he had drawn forage. I then de&s;ired he would make out his pay roll as if he had not forage, and to pay the amount of the forage to Owen Biddle, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> agent for the com. gen. of forage. Mr. Jordan had made
<PB N="34" REF="017047_0033_0F9FBDD82E1341F0">an account out for two days more than he was entitled to. I told him of it, and the mode e&s;tabli&s;hed for payment of teams, and that it was agreeable to the waggon law, and the opinion of the late waggon ma&s;|ter general, James Young, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> He &s;eemed not contented with this deduction of two days at fir&s;t, but on my a&s;&s;uring him it was the u&s;ual and cu&s;tomary time, and offering to &s;hew him &s;everal pay rolls &s;ettled agreeable to the law, and what I then &s;aid, and that I in&s;i&s;ted on the matter being &s;ettled before he left town, as I wi&s;hed to be clear of any further trouble with it, and de&s;iring him not to neglect to call on the pre&s;ident of this &s;tate, and informing him where he lived, he a&s;ked for paper, pen, and ink, and liberty to make out his pay roll in the office, all which were granted him, he &s;eemed to me perfectly &s;atisfied, con|tented, and in good humour. I a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in bringing out the amount, and I believe the clerk ca&s;t it up for him. He left me in this di&s;po&s;ition, and went to general Arnold to receive his money, but &s;oon return|ed and &s;aid, the general was out. I told him to call on him again, and let me know if he refu&s;ed to pay him. From that time I never &s;aw mr. Jordan, but once at &s;ome di&s;tance. General Arnold called on me on the Monday, Tue&s;day, or Wedne&s;day following, I cannot recollect which, and a&s;ked me if I heard anything of mr. Jordan; that he wanted to pay him; that he was going out of town; that he would leave the money with major Clark&s;on, and reque&s;ted I would &s;end mr. Jordan to him to receive his mo|ney; but if he would not come, begged I would &s;end for major Clark&s;on, who would bring the money. I have omitted to mention in the proper place, that on mr. Jordan's return, he was told to call on general Arnold for his pay; in an&s;wer to which he &s;aid, he would not &s;tay at that time to make out his pay roll, but would return and get his pay, or words to that purpo&s;e. On looking at a memorandum book in the office, kept to a&s;&s;i&s;t my memory and my clerks only, I &s;aw the words, "Gone to Eggharbour, by order of general Arnold," oppo&s;ite to the word Je&s;&s;e Jordan, w. m. 12 teams, Che&s;ter county, as here put down. I told the clerk, general Arnold did not give me orders to &s;end him, and therefore it &s;hould be, "Went to Egghar|bour by directions of general Arnold," which he immediately altered; and on ob&s;erving on the other &s;ide, 30th, Je&s;&s;e Jordan returned from Eggharbour, I told the clerk, as I did not think I had any concern with the waggons after they had been &s;ent to general Arnold, that tho&s;e words were unnece&s;&s;ary, and de&s;ired he would &s;trike it out, which he did immediately. This happened the week after Jordan was at my office la&s;t. On general Arnold's return, he &s;ent to let me know, he wanted a certificate of what pa&s;&s;ed re&s;pect|ing the waggons and the payment. As I wi&s;hed to avoid any further concern in this matter, I did not go to wait on him, till he &s;ent &s;everal times. When I waited on him, He was in his chamber; he told me what he &s;ent for me was, to give him a certificate of what I knew re&s;pecting the waggons he &s;ent to Egg|harbour, and what I knew re&s;pecting his de&s;ire to pay them, as the council had charged him with refu&s;ing to pay them. I an&s;wered, I was very de&s;irous to have no further concern in the affair; that I had in|formed the pre&s;ident and council what I knew of it, a copy of which I believed he had, and that I had al&s;o given a committee of congre&s;s what information I could; that I would freely go before any authority that had right to enquire into it, and give my te&s;timony, but I could not give any certificate, or have my name in the public papers, which might &s;ubject me to di&s;agreeable an&s;wers, as the papers were full of vindictive and abu&s;e on many re&s;pectable characters. He &s;aid, it was very cruel and hard to be refu&s;ed a true &s;tate of the matter, and &s;hewed me a paper he had wrote, I believe read it, I al&s;o read it, when he a&s;k|ed me, if it was the true &s;tate of the matter. I an&s;wered, it might be near it, but if I &s;igned any I would write it my&s;elf; that the words were not expre&s;&s;ed as I would do, if I gave any, but &s;till reque&s;ted he would not in&s;i&s;t on it, and wi&s;hed he would excu&s;e me; and al&s;o &s;aid, I would relate the matter, if he would not publi&s;h it; but his an&s;wer was, that would not do, as he wanted the facts to publi&s;h. I endeavoured to excu&s;e my&s;elf, but he earne&s;tly reque&s;ted, as a gentleman, I would give him a &s;tate of the matter, and reque&s;ted I would take the paper home, and &s;end him a certificate. I told him, I would con&s;ider of it, and let him know. On full con&s;ideration, I was &s;till de&s;irous of avoiding any thing that was to be pub|li&s;hed with my name; but on his &s;ending to me &s;everal times for a certificate, I wrote one, which, on con&s;ulting a friend, who&s;e opinion I e&s;teemed, he thought an improper one, on which I was deter|mined to give a copy of my letter to his excellency, of the 19th January, which is before recited; but from the words, on Saturday, the 30th January, as recited in the former part of this narrative, was added as what pa&s;&s;ed re&s;pecting the payments. This I &s;ent to the general, who returned it the next morn|ing, de&s;iring I would &s;end him a certificate. I told the gentleman who brought it, I could give no other than that. He &s;aid he believed it would not do. I an&s;wered I would do no more. After|wards the paper he gave me, was &s;ent for, (as I kept no copy, do not recollect the contents) which I returned. The general afterwards called on me, and reque&s;ted I would give him a certificate. I a&s;&s;ured him I could give no other, and wi&s;hed he would excu&s;e me. He &s;eemed di&s;plea&s;ed at my
<PB N="35" REF="017047_0034_0F9FBDD8850A15B8">an&s;wer, and &s;aid another gentleman's influence, naming him, was greater than his. I a&s;&s;ured him I was not influenced by any one, and only wanted to avoid any publication, but that he might have the let|ter I wrote him. He took it, and left me, as I thought di&s;plea&s;ed. And thus this matter ended, having had no conver&s;ation with the general on the &s;ubject &s;ince.</P>
<P>On the 18th of February, I received a letter from colonel Pettit, a. q. m. gen. enclo&s;ing a letter from the &s;ecretary of council, de&s;iring a certificate of the entry of the waggons &s;ent to Eggharbour, of the fer|ries they cro&s;&s;ed, and of their return; to which gave the following an&s;wer:</P>

From that time I conceived mr. Jordan's waggons to be totally di&s;charged from being under my directions. I therefore neither gave him orders to go to any ferry, or any kind of in&s;tructions, but what is mentioned above. I do not know at what ferry he pa&s;&s;ed, either going or returning.

</LETTER>
<P>On the 23d of February, colonel Pettit called on me to a&s;k me for the memorandum book, to &s;hew to the council. I told, he &s;hould have any book I had, with plea&s;ure, from this time to the 25th, when I was directed to appear before council, by their order of the 24th.</P>
<P>Q. by general Arnold. After the waggons had been employed, and previous to any charge made a|gain&s;t me for the &s;ame, did I not &s;everal times &s;end to you for the account, or to direct the waggon ma&s;ter to call on me, that I might pay him?</P>
<P>A. You did.</P>
<P>Q. by ditto. Did mr. Jordan ever inform you that I had refu&s;ed payment?</P>
<P>A. Jordan did not tell me that you had refu&s;ed to pay him, but had refu&s;ed to pay the pay roll, as it was made out, and I under&s;tood from you, that you wanted to know what you had to pay him.</P>
<P>Q. by ditto. Do you know whether Je&s;&s;e Jordan &s;aw me, after his pay roll was properly made out?</P>
<P>A. I do not; but he told me he called, and you were not at home.</P>
<P>Q. by ditto. Do you know the rea&s;on why he did not &s;ee me after his pay roll was made out, to get his money?</P>
<P>A. I do not know, having no conver&s;ation with him after the an&s;wer before given.</P>
<P>Q. by ditto. When you gave Je&s;&s;e Jordan orders to call on me for in&s;tructions, did you think he un|der&s;tood that he was di&s;charged from the public &s;ervice?</P>
<P>A. I am not certain that he under&s;tood it &s;o, but that was my meaning, as I was bu&s;y at the time, and did not explain my&s;elf more particularly. I had u&s;ually given written in&s;tructions, but did not give Jor|dan any, and for this rea&s;on I thought he under&s;tood he was di&s;charged from the public &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Q. Were the&s;e waggons drawn from the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania for the public &s;ervice?</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="017047_0035_0F9FBDD943C16918">
A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Was not a great demand made on the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania by you, about that time, or a &s;hort time previous to it, for waggons for the public &s;ervice?</P>
<P>A. Yes, for a con&s;iderable number, but the number I do not recollect, in con&s;equence of applications made from different departments to me for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Q. Were the&s;e waggons part of the number that were demanded?</P>
<P>A. I believe they were.</P>
<P>Q. Did general Arnold know of there having been a great demand made on the &s;tate for waggons, when he applied to you for a number of them?</P>
<P>A. I believe he did.</P>
<P>Q. Did you con&s;ider general Arnold's application to you for waggons as a reque&s;t, or an official order?</P>
<P>A. General Arnold being commanding officer in the &s;tate, he made that reque&s;t to me, and I conceiv|ed it as my duty to oblige him as my &s;uperior officer in every thing in my power, which I would not have done to any others officer in the united &s;tates, who was then pre&s;ent. General Arnold having made that reque&s;t to me, and telling me the rea&s;on, that it was to remove property that was likely to fall into the hands of the enemy, I complied with it, thinking it was my duty to do &s;o, he paying all the expence.</P>
<P>Q. Were not general Arnold's orders during his command in Philadelphia generally couched in terms of reque&s;t or de&s;ire?</P>
<P>A. They were generally polite, and &s;uch as one gentleman would write to another.</P>
<P>Q. Did you conceive that you would have been accountable officially to general Arnold for your con|duct, had you refu&s;ed a compliance with his reque&s;t for the waggons?</P>
<P>A. I did not con&s;ider that matter at the time the reque&s;t was made.</P>
<P>Q. Did you conceive your&s;elf at liberty either to comply with the reque&s;t or refu&s;e it?</P>
<P>A. From the request being frequently repeated, I conceived that I would not refu&s;e it without incurring his di&s;plea&s;ure, as commanding officer.</P>
<P>Q. Had you thought the reque&s;t official, would you not have complied with it without a repetition?</P>
<P>A. Had it been communicated to me in writing, I &s;hould have complied with it immediately.</P>
<P>Q. court. Did you think the refu&s;al of the reque&s;t would or could have been treated as a di&s;obedience of orders?</P>
<P>A. I did not think of it in that point of view at all. General Arnold having reque&s;ted of me waggons to bring off property them in danger of falling into the hands of the enemy, I conceived it my duty to let him have them, as &s;oon as it could be done without injury to the public &s;ervice, be paying the whole expence.</P>
<P>Q. Did you put the&s;e waggons into general Arnold's hands in the u&s;ual cour&s;e of your official bu&s;ine&s;s?</P>
<P>A. General Arnold having reque&s;ted of me waggons to bring off property then in danger of falling into the hands of the enemy, I conceived it my duty to let him have them, as &s;oon as it could be done, without injury to the public &s;ervice, he paying the whole expence.</P>
<P>Q. Did not the waggon ma&s;ter of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, in his letters, tell you, the waggons could not go out of the &s;tate, and remon&s;trate again&s;t the great call?</P>
<P>A. There was a hundred and fifty waggons called for from the quarter ma&s;ter of the &s;tate of Jer&s;ey; the time I do not recollect, but believe it to be &s;ome weeks before Jordan's waggons were &s;ent to Egg|harbour. Upon that reque&s;t being made to furni&s;h them the waggon ma&s;ter general of the &s;tate of Penn|&s;ylvania remon&s;trated again&s;t the great call for waggons, and gave as a rea&s;on that no waggons were to be &s;ent to the &s;tate of Jer&s;ey, to carry &s;tores from thence to the army, in con&s;equence of which, none were &s;ent to my knowledge.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know whether general Arnold knew of this remon&s;trance?</P>
<P>A. I believe he did, but cannot be certain of it.</P>
<P>Q. What rea&s;ons had you to &s;uppo&s;e the general knew of the remon&s;trance?</P>
<P>A. No other than that the general was u&s;ually acquainted with every tran&s;action I was, in the de|partment, of that nature, and this matter was much talked of, not in his pre&s;ence that I recollect; and I believe &s;ome of the delegates of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania had a meeting with the waggon ma&s;ter general on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Q. by general Arnold. Don't you recollect when I applied for the waggons, that I reque&s;ted the favour of you, if they could not be &s;pared from the public &s;ervice, to let your people hire me private waggons?</P>
<P>A. At one time when you &s;poke to me upon the &s;ubject, you mentioned the words than you have now mentioned, and I told you it was impo&s;&s;ible it could be done, or I would do it with plea&s;ure. You then &s;aid, as &s;oon as they could be &s;pared from public &s;ervice, you would be glad to have them.</P>

Q. When you &s;ent the waggon ma&s;ter Jordan to general Arnold, did you inform general Arnold that he was in public &s;ervice with the waggons?</P>
<P>A. I &s;ent no notice to general Arnold at all; only told the waggon ma&s;ter to call on him for his in&s;truc|tions, and that he would &s;end him to the Jer&s;eys and pay him.</P>
<P>Q. Had Jordan refu&s;ed a compliance with your orders to go to general Arnold, would you have e&s;|teemed him accountable to you for his refu&s;al?</P>
<P>A. I would not.</P>
<P>Q. court. Did you on reading general Arnold's note of the 30th of January, conceive that it was ge|neral Arnold's intention that the public &s;hould pay any part of the hire of Jordan's waggons?</P>
<P>A. I conceived from general Arnold's note, that he thought he only ought to pay for the time the waggoners were &s;ent to him until the day they returned; but my opinion was, that he &s;hould pay from the time the waggons were called out into public &s;ervice until they returned home. But I did not conceive that general Arnold meant by that, that the public &s;hould pay any part, but that it was a mi&s;take in the man|ner of calculating the pay.</P>
<P>Q. If you conceived that general Arnold did not expect that the public &s;hould pay for any part of the hire of Jordan's teams, what was the rea&s;on of your mentioning in your's of the 30th of January, 1779, that if he ordered you &s;hould pay any part of the time due Jordan for the hire of his teams, you would obey be order?</P>
<P>A. Becau&s;e, as commander in chief, I &s;hould have con&s;idered his written order for that purpo&s;e, as a sufficient voucher to produce to the public.</P>
<P>Q. court. Did general Arnold know any thing of the entries made in your memorandum book, or of the alterations or obliteration made afterwards?</P>
<P>A. Not to my knowledge.</P>
<P>Q. court. Were the&s;e alterations or obliterations mode in the book previous to an inquiry being made into the general's conduct, or &s;ub&s;equent?</P>
<P>A. The alterations was made immediately after the entry; the obliteration within a few days after the 30th of January, but the particular day I cannot recollect.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know the political general characters of mr. James Seagrove, or captain Robert Shewell, junior?</P>
<P>A. I know very little of either of them, but I have heard and thought before we got into Philadelphia that they were di&s;affected per&s;ons. Captain Robert Shewell, junior, was always thought to be a di&s;|affected per&s;on. Mr. Seagrove, at New York, paid particular re&s;pect to general Wa&s;hington, and I con|&s;idered him at that time as a good whig, but his coming into Philadelphia, while the enemy were there in|duced me to alter my opinion of him.</P>

<P>The court met agreeable to adjournment.</P>
<P>Q. to colonel Mitchell. What time was Jordan's brigade of waggons to continue in the public &s;ervice, whom they were ordered out?</P>
<P>A. I think the law of the &s;tate, to the be&s;t of my remembrance, &s;ays thirty days.</P>
<P>Q. Did Jordan's brigade of waggons or any part of them continue in the public &s;ervice, after their re|turn from Eggharbour?</P>
<P>Not one of them, to my knowledge. I was afterwards told, &s;ome of them came out in another bri|gade, but I did not know them as &s;uch.</P>
<P>Q. Was the time they were employed by general Arnold con&s;idered by you, or the waggon ma&s;ter of the &s;tate, as part of their tour of duty?</P>
<P>A. It was not con&s;idered by me, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have detained them until it was over; but as they were &s;ent to general Arnold, I did not con&s;ider I had any charge of them, not con&s;idering them to be in public &s;ervice. I do not know how the waggon ma&s;ter con&s;idered the time they were employed, hav|ing had no conver&s;ation with him upon the &s;ubject, to the be&s;t of my recollection.</P>
<P>Q. In what manner were waggons u&s;ually di&s;charged from the public &s;ervice, after they had com|pleted their tour of duty?</P>
<P>A. By paying them for the time they &s;erved, and letting them go home. No written di&s;charge being given.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="017047_0037_0F9FBDDAF68D60B8">
Q. How long had mr. Jordan been in town with the waggons under his care, before he was ordered by you to go to general Arnold for in&s;tructions?</P>
<P>A. To the be&s;t of my recollection, he was ordered to go to general Arnold for in&s;tructions the morning I knew of his arrival, but the hour of the day I do not recollect.</P>
<P>Q. Did you not order Jordan to proceed with his waggons to one of the public &s;tores, on his arrival in town, to take a load of &s;tores for camp?</P>
<P>A. To the be&s;t of my recollection or knowledge, I did not.</P>
<P>Q. by general Arnold. When I applied for the waggons, did not you tell me, that there were fre|quently public waggons lying idle in town, when provi&s;ions did not arrive to load them, as expected, in which ca&s;e, they could be &s;pared and it would be a &s;aving to the public, as they were obliged to pay for the hire of the waggons when called out, whether they were employed or not?</P>
<P>A. I do not recollect my telling you &s;o, but the circum&s;tances have happened. At that time there were no more waggons called for from the &s;tate, but what could be employed; but a number of conti|nental teams coming in, which I did not expect, enabled me to let you have the waggons at that time.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the la&s;t charge, dr. Gardiner was produced by the judge advocate, and &s;worn, upon his being de&s;ired to give the court what information he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of concerning it: he &s;aid as follows;</P>
<P>That upon the return of Jordan's brigade of waggons from Eggharbour to Philadelphia, he then being in the city, upon public bu&s;ine&s;s, was called upon by &s;ome per&s;ons belonging to the brigade, to vi&s;it a &s;ick wag|goner; be went with them to the continental yard, where the waggons were &s;tanding, and finding the man very ill, in the fir&s;t &s;tage of a nervous fever, he propo&s;ed giving him &s;ome medicines, and at the &s;ame time advi&s;ed them to &s;end him home, as he, the deponent, &s;uppo&s;ed his di&s;order would be tedious. Some diffi|culties ari&s;ing with re&s;pect to the method of &s;ending him, they at length agreed to try, if the whole brigade could obtain a temporary di&s;charge, upon their promi&s;ing to return again in a &s;hort time, and perform the remainder of their tour. They told him, they did apply, and were accordingly di&s;charged or permitted to return, upon the afore&s;aid condition. Sometime afterwards, a complaint was made by col. Young, waggon ma&s;ter general of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, to &s;ome members of the general a&s;&s;embly, then &s;itting, with re|&s;pect to &s;ome abu&s;es of the waggons, called out under the law for public &s;ervice, being employed in private &s;ervice, and particularly with re&s;pect to the mi&s;application of Jordan's brigade, in removing private proper|ty from Eggharbour, and at the &s;ame time drawing forage and rations from the public magazines. The mem|bers &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to have taken up the matter, but being about to ri&s;e in a &s;hort time, and thinking that the matter might be taken up in another channel, &s;ome of the members advi&s;ed colonel Young to lay the ca&s;e before the executive authority of the &s;tate, which he, the deponent, afterwards heard he did. He then heard but little more of the matter, 'till, he thinks, in the latter end of January, or the beginning of Febru|ary, when Jordan called at his hou&s;e in Philadelphia, and told him, that he had con&s;iderable delays in receiv|ing pay for the &s;ervice of his brigade la&s;t fall, and reque&s;ting his advice as a friend, what &s;teps would be mo&s;t advi&s;eable for him to take, to have the matter &s;ettled. He, the deponent, a&s;ked him for his papers; he &s;hew|ed him two pay rolls, or one altered pay roll; one charged to the united &s;tates, and the other charged to ge|neral Arnold. The latter, or the alteration, Jordan told him he made in con&s;equence of colonel Mitchell's directions. He likewi&s;e &s;hewed him, (the deponent) his orders from general Arnold, &s;igned by a mr. Franks as one of his aides. He a&s;ked Jordan what rea&s;on general Arnold gave for not di&s;charging the debt. He an&s;wered, that general Arnold was not willing to pay for more than &s;ix or &s;even days &s;ervice, which was the time he was performing his journey from Philadelphia to Eggharbour and back again. He advi&s;ed Jordan to apply to the executive authority of the &s;tate, and accordingly went with him to mr. Bryan's, who was then vice pre&s;ident of the &s;tate. He likewi&s;e accompanied the vice pre&s;ident, and mr. Clingan, one of the dele|gates of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, and Jordan, to the pre&s;ident's.</P>
<P>Q. Had you any other information that Jordan's brigade of waggons was di&s;charged from the public &s;ervice, or permitted to return, upon their promi&s;ing to return again in a &s;hort time and perform their tour of duty, but what you had from the waggoners?</P>
<P>A. None.</P>
<P>Q. court. Do you know to whom they applied for permi&s;&s;ion to return home?</P>
<P>A. I do not; but I was pre&s;ent when they made the agreement to apply, and they agreed to apply to colonel Mitchell.</P>
<P>Q. court. Do you know whether Jordan's brigade returned to complete their tour of duty?</P>
<P>A. Not as Jordan's brigade. One of the waggoners being &s;ick, and Jordan's quitting the &s;ervice at that time, &s;everal of the waggoners came out under another waggon ma&s;ter; but I cannot &s;ay whether they came out to complete their former tour of duty or not.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="017047_0038_0F9FBDDB79AA8AF0">
Q. by general Arnold. Did Je&s;&s;e Jordan inform you that I had refu&s;ed him payment for the hire of his waggons?</P>
<P>A. Je&s;&s;e Jordan informed me that he went to colonel Mitchell to get his pay, having his pay roll drawn in its u&s;ual form; that colonel Mitchell informed him that the pay roll was wrong, that the united &s;tates were charged, but you ought only to be charged; that agreeable to colonel Mitchell's orders he altered the pay roll or drew a new one, I cannot tell which, in which he charged you in&s;tead of the united &s;tates; that after the pay roll was made out in that manner, colonel Mitchell gave him a note to you, and de&s;ired him to call on you, which he &s;aid he delivered to you, and when be called, you refu&s;ed paying him for the number of days charged in the pay roll, which were twelve or thirteen, and made &s;ome difficulties as to paying him for &s;ix or &s;even days; that he then returned to colonel Mitchell with a note or me&s;&s;age from you, with re&s;pect to the number of days he was in &s;ervice; that when he came to colonel Mitchell he again &s;ent him back to you; not finding you at home, he returned to colonel Mitchell's, and after telling him of it, Jordan &s;aid he would give over any attempts to get the money in that manner; that he was employed by Mr. Boyd, and would apply to him about it; upon which colonel Mitchell told him he mu&s;t not attempt to go away without &s;ettling it, or he would put him in the guard hou&s;e; he further told me, he put his papers quiet|ly in his pocket and &s;lipped off, being fearful that he &s;hould be put in the guard hou&s;e, and he told me he did not make any other attempt to get payment at that time.</P>
<P>Q. by general Arnold. Did you not under&s;tand that there was &s;ome intimation given by &s;ome of the council to colonel Boyd, colonel Young, or Jordan, or &s;ome other per&s;on, to make a complaint re&s;pect|ing the waggons; or was the complaint made without the knowledge or de&s;ire of the council or &s;ome member of it?</P>
<P>A. No member of the council, to my knowledge, influenced any per&s;on to make the complaint.</P>
<P>Q. by do. Do you know whether Je&s;&s;e Jordan called on the pre&s;ident and council voluntarily, or was &s;ent for when he was paid a &s;um of money for the hire of his waggons?</P>
<P>A. I believe he came voluntarily.</P>
<P>Q. by do. Do you know whether the pre&s;ident or any member of the council advi&s;ed or wrote a letter to Jordan de&s;iring him to make out his account, and charge eighty pounds for each waggon, and to apply to the attorney general to commence an action for the money?</P>
<P>A. I do not.</P>
<P>The judge advocate, in addition to the other evidence before the court, de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to produce a certificate of the &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, to &s;hew how the com|plaint by the executive council of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania again&s;t major general Arnold, for employing Je&s;&s;e Jordan's brigade of waggons, originated, which was granted. The certificate was produced, and authenticated by dr. Gardner. On being read, it is as follows:</P>

<P>THIS is to certify, that &s;ome time in the fall of the year 1778, during the &s;itting of the hou&s;e of a&s;|&s;embly, and near the clo&s;e thereof, James Young, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> waggon ma&s;ter general of the &s;tate, applied to me as &s;peaker of the hou&s;e, informing, that he had proof of a brigade of waggons, called out under the law of the &s;tate, being employed for private purpo&s;es; at the &s;ame time reque&s;ting that a &s;upplement might be made to the law, to prevent like abu&s;es in future.

After he was examined, the judge advocate moved that the matters he mentioned be not in&s;ert|ed in the proceedings of the court, as not applying to the charge again&s;t the general.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. pre&s;ident, and gentlemen of this honourable court,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I APPEAR before you, to an&s;wer charges brought again&s;t me by the late &s;upreme executive coun|cil of the commonwealth of Penn&s;ylvania. It is di&s;agreeable to be accu&s;ed; but when an accu&s;ation is made, I feel it a great &s;ource of con&s;olation, to have an opportunity of being tried by gentlemen, who&s;e delicate and refined &s;en&s;ations of honour, will lead them to entertain &s;imilar &s;entiments concerning tho&s;e who accu&s;e unju&s;tly, and tho&s;e who are ju&s;tly accu&s;ed. In the former ca&s;e, your feelings revolt a|gain&s;t the conduct of the pro&s;ecutors; in the latter, again&s;t tho&s;e who are de&s;erved objects of a pro&s;ecution. Whether tho&s;e feelings will be directed again&s;t me, or again&s;t tho&s;e, who&s;e charges have brought me be|fore you, will be known by your ju&s;t and impartial determination of this cau&s;e.</P>
<P>When the pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ary war again&s;t Great Britain commenced, I was in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, and enjoyed a fair pro&s;pect of improving them. I was happy in dome&s;tic connections, and ble&s;&s;ed with a ri&s;|ing family, who claimed my care and attention. The liberties of my country were in danger. The voice of my country called upon all her faithful &s;ons to join in her defence. With cheerfulne&s;s I obeyed the call. I &s;acrificed dome&s;tic ca&s;e and happine&s;s to the &s;ervice of my country, and in her &s;ervice have I &s;acrificed a great part of a hand&s;ome fortune. I was one of the fir&s;t that appeared in the field; and from that time, to the pre&s;ent hour, have not abandoned her &s;ervice.</P>
<P>When one is charged with practices, which his &s;oul abhors, and which con&s;cious innocence tells him, he has never committed, an hone&s;t indignation will draw from him expre&s;&s;ions in his own favour, which on other occa&s;ions, might be a&s;cribed to an o&s;tentatious turn of mind. The part which I have acted in the American cau&s;e, has been acknowledged by our friends, and by our enemies, to have been far from an indifferent one. My time, my fortune, and my per&s;on have been devoted to my country, in this war; and, if the &s;entiments of tho&s;e who are &s;upreme in the united &s;tates, in civil and military affairs, are al|lowed to have any weight, my time, my fortune, and my per&s;on have not been devoted in vain. You will indulge me, gentlemen, while I lay before you &s;ome honourable te&s;timonies, which congre&s;s, and the commander in chief of the armies of the united &s;tates, have been plea&s;ed to give of my conduct. The place where I now &s;tand ju&s;tifies me in producing them.</P>

<P>"IF the event mentioned by general Schuyler &s;hould not have happened, we cannot doubt, but gene|ral Burgoyne has come up the lake, determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to carry his point, I mean, to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of our po&s;ts in that quarter, and to pu&s;h his arms further. Suppo&s;ing this not to have happened, as our continental levies are &s;o deficient in their number, our &s;ecurity and &s;afety will require, that aids from the militia &s;hould be called forth, in ca&s;es of emergency. If it has, there is now as ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for their turning out to check general Burgoyne's progre&s;s, or the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable con&s;equences may be appre|hended. Upon this occa&s;ion, I would take the liberty to &s;ugge&s;t to congre&s;s, the propriety of &s;ending an active, &s;pirited officer to conduct and lead them on. If general Arnold has &s;ettled his affairs, and can be &s;pared from Philadelphia, I would recommend him for this bu&s;ine&s;s, and that he &s;hould immediately &s;et out for the northern department. He is active, judicious and brave, and an officer in whom the militia will repo&s;e great confidence. Be&s;ides this, he is well acquainted with that country, and with the routs and mo&s;t important pa&s;&s;es and defiles in it. I do not think he can render more &s;ignal &s;er|vices, or be more u&s;efully employed at this time, than in this way. I am per&s;uaded his pre&s;ence and activity will animate the militia greatly, and &s;pur them on to a becoming conduct. I could wi&s;h him to be engaged in a more agreeable &s;ervice, to be with better troops; but circum&s;tances call for his exertions in this way, and I have no doubt of his adding much to the honour he has already acquired."</P>

The pre&s;&s;es of Philadelphia have groaned under libels again&s;t me, charges have been publi&s;hed, and officially tran&s;mit|ted to the different &s;tates, (and to many parts of Europe, as I am informed) before they were regularly ex|hibited, and long before I could have an opportunity of refuting them; and indeed every method that men ingeniou&s;ly wicked could invent, has been practi&s;ed to bla&s;t and de&s;troy my character. Such a vile pro|&s;titution of power, and &s;uch in&s;tances of glaring tyranny and inju&s;tice, I believe are unprecedented in the
<PB N="42" REF="017047_0041_0F9FBDE1056082B8">annals of any free people. I have long and impatiently wi&s;hed for an opportunity of vindicating my re|putation, and have frequently applied for it; but the &s;ituation of affairs at the beginning and during the continuance of the campaign, nece&s;&s;arily, and again&s;t the general's inclination, prevented it, until now. But now it is happily arrived, and I have the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes of being able to avail my&s;elf of it, by &s;atisfying you, and, through your &s;entence, by &s;atisfying the world, that my conduct and character have been mo&s;t unwarrantably traduced, and that the charges brought again&s;t me are, <HI>fal&s;e, malicious,</HI> and <HI>&s;candalous.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t charge is, Granting a protection, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In an&s;wer, The permi&s;&s;ion was given on the fourth day of June 1778, when, though I had no formal in&s;tructions from the general to take the command in Philadelphia, I had intimations given me that I &s;hould be found upon for that appointment. The gentleman who applied for the protection in behalf of him&s;elf and company, was not them re&s;iding in the city with the enemy; he had taken the oath of allegiance to the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, required by its laws, as appeared by a certificate which he produced to me. What his political character, and tho&s;e of the others, in who&s;e behalf he applied to me, were, I pretend not to a&s;certain; nor do I mean to become their advocate, any further than the ju&s;tice due to an injured character requires. I think it has been clearly proved by the te&s;timony of &s;everal gentlemen (not parties in this matter) that the general character of tho&s;e gentlemen was unexceptionable, &s;ome of them had taken an active part in favour of the&s;e &s;tates; and the tenor of their conduct &s;ince, will I pre&s;ume ju&s;tify a fa|vourable opinion of them. It is enough for me to &s;hew that their intentions with regard to this ve&s;&s;el and cargo &s;eemed to be upright, and that the de&s;ign of &s;aving them for the u&s;e of the citizens of the united &s;tates, appeared to be laudable, in&s;tead of being reprehen&s;ible. This appears evident from the depo&s;itions of mr. Collins, mr. Beveridge, and colonel Proctor.</P>
<P>Why the protection is viewed as an indignity to the authority of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, I own I cannot di&s;cover. This pre&s;ident and council of that &s;tate were then in Lanca&s;ter; the pa&s;s to the ve&s;&s;el was to "&s;ail into any of the ports of the united &s;tates of America." To &s;ail into the port of Philadelphia was not the object, the ve&s;&s;el was there already. If there was an encroachment upon the authority of any &s;tate, it mu&s;t have been &s;ome other than the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania. The ve&s;&s;el &s;ailed into one of the ports of New Jer&s;ey; the government of that &s;tate, though far from being in&s;en&s;ible to its ho|nour, has never complained of the indignity offered to it by my protection; a jury of that &s;tate acquitted the ve&s;&s;el by their verdict; and the judge of admiralty of that &s;tates confirmed the verdict by his decree, which is in evidence before this honourable court.</P>
<P>It is part of this charge that the permi&s;&s;ion was granted without the knowledge of the commander in chief, though then pre&s;ent. I think it peculiarly unfortunate that the armies of the united &s;tates have a gentleman at their hand, who knows &s;o little about his own honour, or regards it &s;o little, as to &s;ay the pre&s;ident and council of Penn&s;ylvania under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;tepping forth in its defence, perhaps it may be of u&s;e to hint,</P>
<P><HI>Non tali auxili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> aget, n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">c defen&s;eribus i&s;tis.</HI></P>
<P>The general is inve&s;ted with power, and he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;pirit to check and to puni&s;h every in&s;tance of di&s;|re&s;pect &s;hown to his authority; but he will not pro&s;titute his power by exerting it upon a trifling occa&s;ion; far le&s;s will be pervert it when no occa&s;ion is given at all.</P>
<P>His excellency knew, and you, gentlemen, well know, it has been cu&s;tomary for general officers of the army to grant pa&s;&s;es, protections for per&s;ons and property, to the inhabitants of the united &s;tates, who appeared friendly to the &s;ame. The utility of the mea&s;ure, which was evident in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, with|out any precedent, I conceive to be a &s;ufficient ju&s;tification. The protection was de&s;igned only to pre|vent the &s;oldiery from plundering the ve&s;&s;el and cargo, coming from the enemy, that proper authority might take cognizance of the matter. I mu&s;t beg leave to mention a re&s;olution of congre&s;s in point. I do not recollect the date. It was, however, previous to the pa&s;s. That honourable body therein promi&s;e, to all per&s;ons in the enemy's &s;ervice, for their encouragement and reward, all ve&s;&s;els and car|goes that they &s;hall &s;eize upon, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy, and bring into any of the united &s;tates. If &s;uch reward is given to our enemies, can it be e&s;teemed criminal to protect the property of the citizens of the&s;e united &s;tates, when coming from the enemy. Certainly not. At the time the protection was given, I had no doubt of the right or propriety of giving it. I am now confirmed in my opinion, and that the re&s;olution of congre&s;s I have mentioned, warrants the mea&s;ure. But, it &s;trictly con&s;idering the mat|ter, it &s;hall be thought that I exceeded my power, by granting the protection, I hope his excellency gene|neral Wa&s;hington, and this honourable court, will do me the ju&s;tice to believe, that it was not out of any
<PB N="43" REF="017047_0042_0F9FBDE19092EB80">di&s;re&s;pect to his authority, but an error in judgment, as I was convinced at the time I had a right to grant the pa&s;s; and had I refu&s;ed I &s;hould have thought my&s;elf culpable.</P>
<P>The &s;econd-charge con&s;i&s;ts in having &s;hut up the &s;hops and &s;tores on my arrival in the city, &s;o as even to prevent officers of the army from purcha&s;ing, while I privately made con&s;iderable purcha&s;es for my own u&s;e, <HI>as is alledged and believed.</HI></P>
<P>The re&s;olution of congre&s;s, <Q>directs me to take early and proper care to prevent the removal, transfer, or &s;ale of any goods, wares, or merchandize, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the inhabitants of the city, until the property of the &s;ame &s;hall be a&s;certained by a joint committee, con&s;i&s;ting of per&s;ons appointed by con|gre&s;s, and of per&s;ons appointed by the &s;upreme executive council of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania.</Q> My in&s;tructions from the general mention, <Q>that I will find the objects of my command &s;pecified in the re|&s;olution of congre&s;s, and that the means of executing the powers ve&s;ted in me were left to my own judgment.</Q> How could I better prevent the removal, transfer, or &s;ale of any goods, wares and mer|chandize, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the inhabitants of the city, "than by &s;hutting up the &s;hops and &s;tores?"</P>
<P>If "the officers of the army were prevented from purcha&s;ing," it was becau&s;e the &s;ale of any goods was directed by congre&s;s to be prevented, in which the &s;ale of goods to officers was nece&s;&s;arily included; and it was in order (as is &s;tated in the proclamation prohibiting the removal, &s;ale, or transfer of goods) <Q>that the quarter ma&s;ter, commi&s;&s;ary and clothier generals, might contract for &s;uch goods, as were wanted for the <HI>u&s;e of the army.</HI></Q></P>
<P>What I have already mentioned, renders it &s;urpri&s;ing that the &s;hutting up the &s;hops and &s;tores &s;hould be made a charge again&s;t me by <HI>any</HI> man, or body of men: what I am going to mention, renders it peculi|arly &s;urpri&s;ing that this charge &s;hould he made again&s;t me by the gentleman, who is now pre&s;ident of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania. It is in evidence before this honourable court, that this very gentleman propo&s;ed to one of my aids, that he, even before my arrival in town, <Q>&s;hould publi&s;h an order to prevent the &s;elling any goods or merchandize; that this very gentleman was urgent to have this done; that this very gentleman, after my arrival in town, drew up a proclamation for that purpo&s;e, which was pre|&s;ented to me.</Q> The &s;ame gentleman now exhibits the &s;ame mea&s;ure as an article of accu&s;ation again&s;t me.</P>
<P>The la&s;t part of this charge is of a &s;erious nature in&s;tead: it is that, while I prohibited others from pur|cha&s;ing, I privately made con&s;iderable purcha&s;es for my own benefit, "as is <HI>alledged and believed:</HI>" if this part of the charge is true, I &s;tand confe&s;&s;ed, in the pre&s;ence of this honourable court, his vile&s;t of men; I &s;tand &s;tigmatized with indelible di&s;grace, the di&s;grace of having abu&s;ed an appointment of high tru&s;t and importance, to accompli&s;h the meane&s;t and mo&s;t unworthy purpo&s;es: the blood I have &s;pent in defence of my country, will be in&s;ufficient to obliterate the &s;tain.</P>
<P>But if this part of the charge is void of truth; if it has not even the &s;emblance of truth, what &s;hall I &s;ay of my accu&s;ers? what epithets will characterize their conduct, the &s;entence of this honourable court will &s;oon determine.</P>
<P>It is "ALLEDGED and BELIEVED," that I privately made con&s;iderable purcha&s;es for my own benefit. I am not conver&s;ant in the &s;tudy of juri&s;prudence; but I have always under&s;tood, that <HI>public</HI> charges ought to have &s;ome other foundation to re&s;t upon, than mere un&s;upported <Q><HI>allegation</HI> and <HI>belief.</HI></Q> Who "<HI>alledge</HI> and <HI>believe</HI>" this accu&s;ations? None, I tru&s;t, but the pre&s;ident and council of Penn&s;ylvania; becau&s;e, I tru&s;t, none el&s;e would alledge and believe any thing tending to ruin a character, without &s;ufficient evidence. Where is the evidence of this accu&s;ation? I call upon any ac|cu&s;ers to produce it: I call upon them to produce it, under the pain of being held forth to the world, and to po&s;terity, upon the proceedings of this court, as public defamers and murderers of reputation.</P>
<P>They have indeed produced the evidence of a certain colonel Fitzgerald, to prove that he &s;aw an anoni|mous paper in the hands of major Franks, one of my adds. I &s;hall take no notice of the paper he alludes to, as it cannot be deemed a proof, or admitted as evidence; but the manner of his procuring a &s;ight of the paper, I cannot help taking notice of: lodging in the &s;ame hou&s;e with major Franks, in his ab&s;ence, colonel Fitzgerald's <HI>curio&s;ity prompted him to examine major Franks's papers,</HI> when he &s;tumbled upon a &s;ecret too big for him to keep. Was not this a gro&s;s violation of the confidence &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between gen|tlemen? but what &s;hall I &s;ay of the u&s;e this gentleman made of his &s;ecret? I will not &s;ay it was a di&s;grace to the character of a &s;oldier and gentleman. I will leave it to the gentleman's own feeling, which (if he in not callous) will &s;ay more to him than I can po&s;&s;ibly do on the &s;ubject. In the nature of things, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to prove, by po&s;itive and direct evidence, the <HI>negative</HI> &s;ide of a charge: but I have done all that in the nature of things is po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="017047_0043_0F9FBDE2404D35A0">
On the honour of a gentleman and &s;oldier, I declare to gentlemen and &s;oldiers, that the charge is fal&s;e.</P>
<P>My aids de camp were acquainted with my tran&s;actions, and had acce&s;s to my papers: <Q>My invoice, my minute and account books, were always open to their in&s;pection.</Q> Could I have made con&s;ider|able purcha&s;es, without their knowledge? <Q>and yet they did not know of my making any purcha&s;es of goods of any kind, directly or indirectly; and they had every rea&s;on to think, that no &s;uch purcha&s;es were made, either by me or my agents, except a few trifling articles to furni&s;h my table, and for my family's u&s;e; mo&s;t of which were &s;upplied me by the quarter ma&s;ter, commi&s;&s;ary and clothier generals.</Q></P>
<P>If I made con&s;iderable purcha&s;es, con&s;iderable &s;ales mu&s;t have been made to me by &s;ome per&s;on in Phila|delphia. Why are not the&s;e per&s;ons produced? Have my pro&s;ecutors &s;o little power and influence in that city, as to be unable to furni&s;h evidence of the truth?</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the third charge of the &s;upreme executive council of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations on it, becau&s;e it is evidently calculated, by a fal&s;e colouring of a trifling and innocent tran&s;action, to &s;ubject me to the prejudice of the freemen of the&s;e &s;tates, and parti|cularly of the militia of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>I am charged <Q>with impo&s;ing menial offices upon the &s;ons of freemen of this &s;tate, when called forth by de&s;ire of congre&s;s to perform militia duty; and when remon&s;trated to thereupon, ju&s;tifying my&s;elf in writing, upon the ground of having power &s;o to do.</Q> The letters which are in evidence before this honourable court, which pa&s;&s;ed between mr. &s;ecretary Matlack and my&s;elf, will explain the &s;ole tran&s;action, upon which this general accu&s;ation is founded.</P>
<P>By what &s;trained con&s;truction the &s;entiments which I have expre&s;&s;ed, "that when a citizen a&s;&s;umes the character of a &s;oldier, the former was entirely lo&s;t in the latter," &s;hould be extended to a ju&s;tification of my&s;elf, on the mere <HI>principal</HI> of <HI>power,</HI> is &s;omewhat extraordinary. My opinion in this matter is confirmed, not only by the &s;entiments of many of the mo&s;t enlightened patrons of liberty in this and other countries, but &s;anctified by the militia law of &s;everal free &s;tates, both in Europe and America, particularly Switzerland and the &s;tate of New-York, where (if I am not mi&s;taken) the militia of the latter, when called forth into continental &s;ervice, are &s;ubjected to the &s;ame rules of di&s;cipline, with the troops of the united &s;tates; the character and conduct of that militia prove the policy of this principle. My ambition is to de&s;erve the good opinion of the militia of the&s;e &s;tates, not only becau&s;e I re&s;pect their character and their exertions, but becau&s;e their confidence in me may (as I flatter my&s;elf it has hitherto been) prove beneficial to the general cau&s;e of America: but having no local politics to bias my voice or my conduct, I leave it to others to wriggle them&s;elves into a temporary popularity, by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the reputation of innocent per&s;ons, and endeavouring to render odious a principle, the maintenance of which is e&s;&s;ential to the good di&s;cipline of the militia, and con&s;equently to the &s;afety of the&s;e &s;tates. I flatter my&s;elf the time is not far off, when, by the glorious e&s;tabli&s;hment of our independence, I &s;hall again return into the ma&s;s of citizens: 'tis a period I look forward to with anxiety; I &s;hall then cheerfully &s;ubmit as a citizen, to be governed by the &s;ame principle of &s;ubordination, which has been tortured into a wanton exertion of arbitrary power.</P>
<P>This in&s;inuation comes, in my opinion, with an ill grace from the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, in who&s;e more immediate defence I &s;acrificed my feelings as a &s;oldier, when I conceived them incompatible with the duties of a citizen, and the welfare of that &s;tate.</P>
<P>By a re&s;olution of congre&s;s, I found my&s;elf &s;uper&s;eded (in con&s;equence of a new mode of appointment of general officers) by &s;everal who were my juniors in &s;ervice; tho&s;e who know the feelings of an officer, (who&s;e utmo&s;t ambition is the good opinion of his country) mu&s;t judge what my &s;en&s;ations were at this apparent mark of neglect. I repaired to the city of Philadelphia in the month of May, 1777, in order either to attain a re&s;toration of my rank, or a permi&s;&s;ion to re&s;ign my commi&s;&s;ion; during this interval, the van of general Howe's army advanced, by a rapid march, to Somer&s;et court hou&s;e, with a view (as was then generally &s;uppo&s;ed) to penetrate to the city of Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding I had been &s;uper&s;eded, and my feelings as an officer wounded, yet, on finding the &s;tate was in imminent danger from the de&s;igns of the enemy. I &s;acrificed tho&s;e feelings, and with alacrity put my&s;elf at the head of the militia, who were collected to oppo&s;e the enemy, determined to exert my|&s;elf for the benefit of the public, although I conceived my&s;elf injured by their repre&s;entatives. How far the good countenance of the militia under my command operated, in deterring general Howe from marching to the city of Philadelphia, I will not pretend to &s;ay; certain it is, he altered his route.</P>
<P>What returns I have met with from the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, I leave to them&s;elves to judge, in the
<PB N="45" REF="017047_0044_0F9FBDE3174323A0">cool hour of reflection, which (notwith&s;tanding the phrenzy of party, and the pains &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly taken to &s;upport a clamour again&s;t me) mu&s;t &s;ooner or later ari&s;e.</P>
<P>I will conclude this &s;ubject, by reading a letter from mr. Matlack, received &s;ub&s;equent to the letters which have been already read, which I con&s;ider as an in&s;ult and indignity. The letter will &s;peak for it|&s;elf; the &s;pirit and tendency of it are very obvious.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding all the influence of the ruling powers of Penn&s;ylvania, which mu&s;t be well known by &s;everal of this honourable court; the unexampled method adopted by the council to prejudice the minds of the citizens again&s;t me, previous to a trial, and the daily calumnies invented and indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated to prevent the popular heat from &s;ub&s;iding; the impartiality and good &s;en&s;e of a body of freemen of the city of Philadelphia, were impregnable to all the arts made u&s;e of to poi&s;on the fountain of ju&s;tice. And here I cannot but congratulate my countrymen upon the glorious effects of the exertions we have made, to e&s;tabli&s;h the liberties of our&s;elves, and po&s;terity, upon the firm ba&s;is of equal laws. Had it not been for the grand bulwark again&s;t the tyranny of rulers, the trial by peers, it is ea&s;y to for&s;ee, from the &s;pirit of tho&s;e who have been my accu&s;ers, what mu&s;t have been my fate.

<P>It is difficult to account for the extraordinary mode pur&s;ued by the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, to damn my reputation, and for the a&s;perity with which I was per&s;ecuted, on any other principle, than one, by which &s;tates, as well as individuals, are too often tempted to commit the mo&s;t flagrant acts of inju&s;tice, <HI>I mean intere&s;t.</HI> The &s;loop Active, which was the object of the &s;uit, which I was accu&s;ed of unlawfully maintaining, was taken by part of the crew of the ve&s;&s;el, who were Americans, who ro&s;e upon the re&s;t, and after having confined the captain and others, were bringing her into port. In this &s;ituation &s;he was boarded by a ve&s;&s;el belonging to the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, and brought in, and afterwards libelled as a prize taken by them&s;elves. The original captors, who were (&s;ome of them) born in Connecticut, my native country, with who&s;e connections I was acquainted, applied to me for my a&s;&s;i&s;tance in obtain|ing them <HI>ju&s;tice.</HI> I a&s;&s;i&s;ted them both with my advice, my time, and my pur&s;e; and though three fourths of the ve&s;&s;el and cargo were, by the lower court of admiralty for the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, adjudged to the &s;tate captors, this &s;entence was, by an unanimous opinion of a court of appeals, rever&s;ed and adjudged to tho&s;e whom I patronized, as appears by their decree, which I beg leave to read, with their report to congre&s;s, and the re&s;olutions of congre&s;s thereupon.</P>

<HEAD><HI>In</HI> CONGRESS, <HI>March,</HI> 6 1779.</HEAD>
<P>THE committee to whom was referred the report of the committee on appeals of January 19th, 1779, having, in pur&s;uance of the in&s;tructions to them given, examined into the cau&s;es of the refu&s;al of the judge of the court of admiralty for the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, to carry into execution the decree of the court or committee of appeals, report,</P>
<P>That on a libel in the court of admiralty for the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, in the ca&s;e of the &s;loop Active, the jury found a verdict in the following words, <HI>viz.</HI> "one fourth of the net proceeds of the &s;loop Active and her cargo to the fir&s;t claimants, three fourths of the net proceeds of the &s;aid &s;loop and her cargo to the libellant and the &s;econd claimant, as per agreement between them;" which verdict was confirmed by the judge of the court, and &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed thereon. From this &s;entence or judgment and verdict, an appeal was lodged with the &s;ecretary of congre&s;s and referred to the committee appointed by congre&s;s, "to bear and determine finally upon all appeals brought to congre&s;s," from the courts of admiralty of the &s;everal &s;tates:</P>
<P>That the &s;aid committee, after &s;olemn argument and full hearing of the parties by their advocates, and taking time to con&s;ider thereof, proceeded to the publication of their definitive &s;entence or decree, there|by rever&s;ing the &s;entence of the court of admiralty, making a new decree, and ordering proce&s;s to i&s;&s;ue out of the court of admiralty for the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, to carry this their decree into execution:</P>
<P>That the judge of the court of admiralty refu&s;ed to carry into execution the decree of the &s;aid com|mittee on appeals, and has a&s;&s;igned as the rea&s;on of his refu&s;al, that an act of the legi&s;lature of the &s;aid &s;tate, had declared that the finding of a jury &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h the facts in all trials of the courts of admiralty, without re-examination or appeal, and that an appeal is permitted only from the decree of the judge:</P>
<P>That having examined the &s;aid act, which is intitled "an act for e&s;tabli&s;hing a court of admiralty," pa&s;&s;ed at a &s;e&s;&s;ion which commenced the 4th of Augu&s;t, 1778, the committee find the following words, <HI>viz.</HI> "the finding of a jury &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h the facts, without re-examination or appeal," and in the &s;e|venth &s;ection of the &s;ame act the following words, <HI>viz.</HI> "in all ca&s;es of captures an appeal from the de|cree of the judge of admiralty of this &s;tate, &s;hall be allowed to the continental congre&s;s or &s;uch per&s;on or per&s;ons as they may from time to time appoint for hearing and trying appeals."</P>
<P>That although congre&s;s, by their re&s;olution of November 25th, 1775, recommended it to the &s;everal legi&s;latures to erect courts for the purpo&s;es of determining concerning captures, and to provide that all trials in &s;uch ca&s;es be had by a jury, yet it is provided that in all ca&s;es an appeal &s;hall be allowed to con|gre&s;s or to &s;uch per&s;on or per&s;ons as they &s;hall appoint for the trial of appeals:" whereupon</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> That congre&s;s, or &s;uch per&s;on or per&s;ons as they appoint to hear and determine appeals from from the courts of admiralty, have nece&s;&s;arily the power to examine as well into deci&s;ions on facts as de|ci&s;ions on the law, and to decree finally thereon, and that no finding of a jury in any court of admiralty or court for determining the legality of captures on the high &s;eas, can or ought to de&s;troy the right of appeals and the re-examination of the facts re&s;erved to congre&s;s:</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="017047_0047_0F9FBDE54B2823E0">
That no act of any one &s;tate can or ought to de&s;troy the right of appeals to congre&s;s in the &s;en&s;e above declared:</P>
<P>That congre&s;s is by the&s;e united &s;tates ve&s;ted with the &s;upreme &s;overeign power of war and peace:</P>
<P>That the power of executing the law of nations is e&s;&s;ential to the &s;overeign &s;upreme power of war and peace:</P>
<P>That the legality of all captures on the high &s;eas mu&s;t be determined by the law of nations:</P>
<P>That the authority ultimately and finally to decide on all matters and que&s;tions touching the law of nations, does re&s;ide, and is ve&s;ted in the &s;upreme &s;overeign power of war and peace:</P>
<P>That a controul by appeal is nece&s;&s;ary, in order to compel a ju&s;t and uniform execution of the law of nations:</P>
<P>That the &s;aid controul mu&s;t extend as well over the deci&s;ions of juries as judges in courts for deter|mining the legality of captures on the &s;ea; otherwi&s;e the juries would be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the ultimate &s;upreme power of executing the law of nations in all ca&s;es of captures, and might at any time exerci&s;e the &s;ame in &s;uch manner as to prevent a po&s;&s;ibility of being controuled; a con&s;truction which involves many in|conveniencies and ab&s;urdities, de&s;troys an e&s;&s;ential part of the power of war and peace entru&s;ted to con|gre&s;s, and would di&s;able the congre&s;s of the united &s;tates from giving &s;atisfaction to foreign nations com|plaining of a violation of neutralities, of treaties or other breaches of the law of nations, and would enable a jury in any one &s;tate to involve the united &s;tates in ho&s;tilities; a con&s;truction which for the&s;e and many other rea&s;ons is inadmi&s;&s;ible:</P>
<P>That this power of controuling by appeal the &s;everal admiralty juri&s;dictions of the &s;tates has hitherto been exerci&s;ed by congre&s;s, by the medium of a committee of their own members.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> That the committee before whom was determined the appeal from the court of admiralty for the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, in the ca&s;e of the &s;loop Active, was duly con&s;tituted and authori&s;ed to deter|mine the &s;ame:</P>

<P>This, gentlemen, is my cardinal guilt; hence proceeds the vengeance of an intere&s;ted government a|gain&s;t me; hence the pain and anxiety I have &s;uffered, in &s;eeing the fair fabric of reputation, which I have been with &s;o much danger and toil rai&s;ing &s;ince the pre&s;ent war, undermined by tho&s;e, who&s;e po&s;terity (as well as them&s;elves) will feel the ble&s;&s;ed effects of my efforts, in conjunction with you and others, in re&s;cuing them from a tyranny of the mo&s;t cruel and deba&s;ing nature.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fifth charge, of appropriating the waggons of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, when called forth upon a &s;pecial emergency, la&s;t autumn, to the tran&s;portation of private property, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The evidence relative to that tran&s;action, before the court, will, I doubt not, ju&s;tify my conduct in their opinion. It has been clearly proved by the te&s;timony of colonel Mitchell and major Franks, that the waggons were &s;upplied by the deputy quarter ma&s;ter general upon a private reque&s;t, and not con&s;ider|ed as in the public &s;ervice, when employed. Suppo&s;e application had been made to me, for waggons, during my command in the city of Philadelphia, for removing property belonging to private per&s;ons, which was in danger of falling into the hands of the enemy, and I found the &s;ame could be done without injury to the public, &s;hould I be ju&s;tified in refu&s;ing the public a&s;&s;i&s;tance? Certainly not. Does then the criminality con&s;i&s;t in removing the property, becau&s;e I was intere&s;ted in it? Had the &s;upplies for the continental army been ob&s;tructed by this tran&s;action, or had I endeavoured to make it a public charge, my conduct would certainly have been blame worthy; but as it evidently appears, that neither the one or the other was the ca&s;e, I flatter my&s;elf, that my conduct, in&s;tead of being condemned by this honourable court, will be approved, and that an honourable acquittal will follow from the facts I have proved.</P>
<P>What &s;hall I &s;ay of the conduct of the pre&s;ident and council of Penn&s;ylvania, re&s;pecting the waggons?
<PB N="50" REF="017047_0049_0F9FBDE9771BECE8">They fir&s;t charge me with employing public waggons to remove private property, in&s;inuating, that the waggon ma&s;ter was refu&s;ed payment for the hire of his waggons, and that I intended to defraud the pub|lic. It would have been but candid, had they informed the public, that Je&s;&s;e Jordan the waggon ma&s;ter had not been refu&s;ed payment for the hire of his waggons, but that by their influence and advice, he had been prevented calling on me for his pay, that they might have &s;ome pretence for in&s;tituting an action and this charge again&s;t me.</P>
<P>In the next in&s;tance, they wrote, or cau&s;ed to be wrote, a letter to Je&s;&s;e Jordan, directing him to make out the account of the hire of his waggons, a&s;&s;uring him, that if he charged eighty pounds for the hire of each waggon, (more than double the fir&s;t account which he had pre&s;ented to me) they did not doubt of his recovering the whole &s;um, and directed him to &s;end his account to the attorney general, who had orders to commence an action again&s;t me for the &s;ame, which he accordingly did; and there is now an action a|gain&s;t me, depending in one of the courts of Penn&s;ylvania, for upwards of eleven hundred pounds, for the hire of tho&s;e waggons.</P>
<P>Is it not very extraordinary, that I &s;hould be accu&s;ed and tried before this honourable court, for em|ploying public waggons, and at the &s;ame time, and by the &s;ame per&s;ons, be pro&s;ecuted in a civil court of Penn&s;ylvania, for employing the &s;ame waggons as private property.</P>
<P>As to the &s;ixth charge, purporting, that by my recommendatory letter to general Maxwell, to grant a pa&s;s to mi&s;s Levy to go to New-York, I had violated the re&s;olve of congre&s;s, and u&s;urped the authority of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania. To attempt a &s;erious refutation, would be as ridiculous as the charge it&s;elf. Let the letter wrote on this occa&s;ion &s;peak for it&s;elf. I kept no copy of it, but well remember the pur|port, which was nearly as follows:</P>

<P>THE bearer, mi&s;s Levy, is a young woman of a good character, who has an aged parent that is blind, depending on her for &s;upport; &s;he has money due to her from people in New-York, and wi&s;hes for a permi&s;&s;ion to go there for the purpo&s;e of collecting it, for the relief and &s;upport of her mother, who will be greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed without it.

</LETTER>
<P>As to the &s;eventh charge, of an indecent and di&s;re&s;pectful behaviour to the council of Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>True it is, I refu&s;ed to obey an arbitrary mandate, (to render to them an account of my conduct) cal|culated to criminate my&s;elf. They complain, that by my refu&s;al their <HI>dignity is wounded.</HI> Had I obey|ed, &s;oldiers and citizens might ju&s;tly have &s;aid, that I had betrayed their <HI>rights,</HI> and <HI>wounded their dignity. The very demand was an in&s;ult to common &s;en&s;e.</HI> I beg leave to ob&s;erve, that no one has a greater re&s;pect than my&s;elf for the civil authority, and no one is more convinced of the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upporting it. But when public bodies of men &s;hew them&s;elves actuated by the pa&s;&s;ions of anger, or envy, and apply their effects to &s;ap the character of an individual, and to render his &s;ituation mi&s;erable, they mu&s;t not think it extraordinary, if they are not treated with all the deference which they may think their due.</P>
<P>It is the dignity with which an office is executed, much more than the name, that can ever &s;ecure re&s;pect and obedience from a free people, and true dignity con&s;i&s;ts in exerci&s;ing power with wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice and moderation. Had I experienced this, and had any unguarded expre&s;&s;ions e&s;caped my pen in my letters to the pre&s;ident and council of Penn&s;ylvania, I would cheerfully, in a cooler hour of reflec|tion, have made an acknowledgment; but they have thought proper to take vengeance for them&s;elves: I &s;hall therefore leave it to the impartial public of America to judge betwixt us.</P>
<P>The anathema of the &s;upreme executive council, clo&s;es with ob&s;erving, "That the di&s;couragement and neglect manife&s;ted by general Arnold to civil, military and other characters, who have adhered to the cau&s;e of their country, with an entire different conduct to tho&s;e of another character, are too notorious to need proof or illu&s;tration," <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I am not &s;en&s;ible, mr. Pre&s;ident, of having neglected any gentlemen, either in the civil or military line, who have adhered to the cau&s;e of their country, and who have put it into my power to take notice of them; with re&s;pect to gentlemen in the civil line and army, I can appeal to the candour of congre&s;s and to the army, as &s;carcely a day pa&s;&s;ed but many of both were entertained by me; they are the be&s;t judges of my company and conduct.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to attention to tho&s;e of an oppo&s;ite character, I have paid none but &s;uch, as in my &s;itua|tion,
<PB N="51" REF="017047_0050_0F9FBDEAABF737F0">was ju&s;tifiable on the principles of common humanity and politene&s;s. The pre&s;ident and council of Penn&s;ylvania will pardon me, if I cannot dive&s;t my&s;elf of humanity, merely out of complai&s;ance to them.</P>
<P>It is enough for me, mr. pre&s;ident, to contend with men in the field; I have not yet learned to carry on a warfare again&s;t <HI>women,</HI> or to con&s;ider every man as di&s;affected to our glorious cau&s;e, who, from an oppo&s;ition in &s;entiment to tho&s;e in power in the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, may, by the <HI>clamour of party, be &s;tiled a tory:</HI> it is well known, that this odious appellation has, in that &s;tate, been applied by &s;ome, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, to &s;everal of illu&s;trious character, both in the civil and military line.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion I think I may be allowed to &s;ay, without vanity, that my conduct, from the earlie&s;t period of the war to the pre&s;ent time, has been &s;teady and uniform. I have ever obeyed the calls of my country, and &s;tepped forth in her denfence, in every hour of danger, when many were de&s;erting her cau&s;e, which appeared de&s;perate: I have often bled in it; the marks that I bear, are &s;ufficient evidence of my conduct. The impartial public will judge of my &s;ervices, and whether the returns that I have met with are not tinctured with the ba&s;e&s;t ingratitude. Con&s;cious of my own innocence, and the unworthy methods taken to injure me, I can with boldne&s;s &s;ay to my per&s;ecutors in general, and to the <HI>chief</HI> of them in particular, that in the hour of <HI>danger,</HI> when the affairs of America were a <HI>gloomy a&s;pect,</HI> when our il|lu&s;trious general was retreating through New Jer&s;ey, with a handful of men, I did not propo&s;e to my a&s;&s;ociates, ba&s;ely to quit the general, and &s;acrifice the cau&s;e of my country to my per&s;onal &s;afety, by go|ing over to the enemy, and making my peace. I can &s;ay I never ba&s;ked in the &s;un&s;hine of my general's favour, and courted him to his face, when I was at the &s;ame time treating him with the greate&s;t di&s;re|&s;pect, and villifying his character when ab&s;ent. This is more than a ruling member of the council of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania can &s;ay. <HI>"as is alledged and believed."</HI></P>
<P>Before I conclude, I beg leave to read before this honourable court a report of a committee of enquiry of congre&s;s, on the charges publi&s;hed again&s;t me by the council of Penn&s;ylvania, with &s;everal letters I did my&s;elf the honour to write to congre&s;s, and a letter from their committee in an&s;wer: I do not pre&s;ume to offer the&s;e as evidence, but as they &s;hew the anxiety I had to have my conduct inve&s;tigated, and the reluctance of my accu&s;ers to bring matters to an i&s;&s;ue, I think it incumbent on me as an officer, to lay them before you.</P>

<P>The fir&s;t, &s;econd, third and fifth charges, are offences, triable only in a court martial; that the fourth charge is an offence only of a civil nature, and triable only in a court of common law; that the &s;ixth, &s;eventh, and eighth charges are offences, not triable by a court martial, or common law court, or &s;ubject to any other puni&s;hment than the di&s;plea&s;ure of congre&s;s and the con&s;equences of it; that the committee are furni&s;hed with evidence, by the &s;upreme executive council on the fifth and &s;eventh charges, to which they beg leave to refer; that the committee of the &s;aid executive council, though repeatedly applied to, declined to give any evidence on the re&s;t of the charges, after fruitle&s;s application for three weeks, during which time &s;everal letters pa&s;&s;ed between the &s;aid executive council and committee, in which letters, the &s;upreme executive council even threaten the committee, and charge them with partiality.</P>

<P>AFTER the conference between your honourable committee and this board on Wedne&s;day la&s;t, the
<PB N="52" REF="017047_0051_0F9FBDEB8B91CAC0">propriety of our farther appearing to congre&s;s on that part of the &s;ubject, which related to the employ of our public waggons, was con&s;idered; and it now becomes my duty to acquaint you, that this council preferring the public good to all other con&s;iderations, and more e&s;pecially to tho&s;e in which a &s;en&s;e of indignity offered us, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to mingle, have concluded to give you all the information that is now in our power. In addition therefore to the papers enclo&s;ed, I would mention, that if mr. Mitchell's &s;tate of that bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould appear to be defective, one Je&s;&s;e Jordan, late a waggon ma&s;ter in the quarter ma&s;ter's department, can give te&s;timony in the matter. We had &s;ent to the quarter ma&s;ter to order him up, before mr. Mitchell's &s;tate was given us, but we find he has quitted the &s;ervice, and we &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;tate of the matter to afford &s;ufficient ground of complaint, have taken no mea&s;ures &s;ince to bring him up for examination.</P>
<P>But while we thus act upon motives &s;uperior to the gratification of our own feelings, we think we &s;hould be wanting in public duty and &s;pirit, if we concealed; and while we are deliberating upon the mea&s;ures to which we are competent, for the vindication of our own honour, we mu&s;t freely, 'though re&s;pectfully, declare, that, if in the execution of public duty and the re&s;olves of congre&s;s, your officers may fru&s;trate our good intentions, and affront us without feeling any marks of your di&s;plea&s;ure, it will greatly di&s;courage our pro&s;ecuting any enquiries into public abu&s;es, and executing your re&s;olves farther than the &s;pecial exigencies and conveniencies of our &s;tate &s;hould require: for we cannot but feel great re|luctance to commit the authority and honour of the &s;tate, and our own per&s;onal feelings, in di&s;putes with per&s;ons who, in many ca&s;es, may, by that means, be elevated into unde&s;erved con&s;equence.</P>

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DID my&s;elf the honour of writing to you on the 12th ult. to which a&s;k leave to refer. I am grate|fully &s;en&s;ible of the attention, which congre&s;s paid to my reque&s;t, in appointing a committee of their ho|nourable body to enquire into the charges publi&s;hed again&s;t me by the pre&s;ident and council of Penn&s;ylva|nia; and having been informed, that the committee have fini&s;hed their enquiry, and delivered in their re|port. I pray you, &s;ir, to recommend to congre&s;s, to examine, and decide thereon as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. I am &s;en&s;ible of the multiplicity of bu&s;ine&s;s before congre&s;s, yet I flatter my&s;elf, that they will con&s;ider the cruel &s;ituation in which I am placed by the per&s;ecution of my enemies, and relieve me by a &s;peedy deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>As an individual, I tru&s;t I &s;hall ever have &s;pirit to be the guardian of my own honour; but as the &s;er|vant of congre&s;s, when attacked by a public body, I con&s;ider my&s;elf bound to make my appeal to that honourable body, in who&s;e &s;ervice I have the honour to be; and whil&s;t my conduct and the charges again&s;t me are under their con&s;ideration, I think it my duty to wait the i&s;&s;ue, without noticing the many abu&s;ive mi&s;repre&s;entations and calumnies, which are daily circulated by a &s;et of wretches, beneath the notice of a gentleman and man of honour; yet permit me to &s;ay, that the&s;e calumniators, employed and &s;upported by per&s;ons in power and reputable &s;tations, whil&s;t my cau&s;e remains undetermined before congre&s;s, con|&s;ider them&s;elves &s;ecure, and indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread their in&s;inuations and fal&s;e a&s;&s;ertions through the&s;e united &s;tates, to poi&s;on the minds of my virtuous countrymen and fellow citizens, and to prejudice them again&s;t a man who&s;e life has ever been devoted to their &s;ervice, and who looks on their good opinion and e&s;teem, as the greate&s;t reward and honour he can receive. Thus circum&s;tanced, I cannot be charged with undue impatience for &s;oliciting an immediate deci&s;ion on the charges brought again&s;t me; and I flatter my&s;elf, that every member of that honourable body mu&s;t have &s;ome idea of what I have &s;uffered on this occa&s;ion, and that they will relieve me from a &s;ituation, the cruelty of which is beyond my power to expre&s;s.</P>

<P>I FIND by a re&s;olution of congre&s;s of the 3d in&s;tant, that they have directed his excellency general Wa&s;hington to call a court martial on the 1&s;t, 2d, 3d and 5th charges contained in the re&s;olves of the

<P>I cannot but te&s;tify my &s;urprize, that a court martial &s;hould be ordered to try me for offences, &s;ome of which the committee of congre&s;s in their report, &s;ay, <Q>there appears no evidence tending to prove the &s;ame, that the &s;aid charges are fully explained, and the appearances they carry of criminality fully obviated by clear unque&s;tionable evidence.</Q> If congre&s;s have been induced to take this mea&s;ure for the public good, and to avoid a breach with this &s;tate, however hard my ca&s;e may be, and however I am injured as an individual, I will &s;uffer with plea&s;ure, until a court martial can have an opportunity of doing me ju&s;tice by acquitting me of the&s;e charges a &s;econd time.</P>
<P>As congre&s;s have not decided on the 6th, 7th and 8th charges, 'though their committee have acquitted me, I mu&s;t now beg the favour of their deci&s;ion on tho&s;e charges: I a&s;k it as a piece of ju&s;tice due to a faithful and hone&s;t &s;ervant, and make no doubt of their immediately complying with my reque&s;t.</P>

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DID my&s;elf the honour of writing to you on the 8th and 12th of February, and again on the 14th in&s;tant, re&s;pecting the mo&s;t cruel and unju&s;t attempt made by the pre&s;ident and council of this &s;tate, to injure my character, to which letters I beg leave to refer. In con&s;equence of the two former, congre&s;s were plea&s;ed to appoint a committee to inve&s;tigate the charges again&s;t me, to the end, that I might be, on their report, either acquitted or tried; and though the committee, after three weeks fruitle&s;s applica|tion to the pre&s;ident and council of this &s;tate, were not able to obtain any evidence in &s;upport of the two fir&s;t charges, and in their report to congre&s;s, &s;ay, "That there is no evidence tending to prove the &s;ame; that the &s;aid charges are fully explained, and the appearances they carry of criminality, fully obviated, by clear, unque&s;tionable evidence."</P>
<P>Yet, I find, by a re&s;olution of congre&s;s, of the 3d in&s;tant, they have ordered a court martial to try me for tho&s;e charges, of which their committee have fully exculpated me, and have refu&s;ed to decide on the report of the committee on the three la&s;t charges, which are not cognizable either in a civil law court, or court martial, and of which I &s;till &s;uffer under the imputation, although this committee have fully acquitted me. I mu&s;t once more beg congre&s;s will do me the ju&s;tice to decide on tho&s;e charges. I a&s;k for no favour, but ju&s;tice, and my right; and I flatter my&s;elf, when congre&s;s con&s;ider my pa&s;t &s;ervices and &s;uffering in the cau&s;e of my country, they will no longer withhold the ju&s;tice from me I am entitled to, however di&s;agreeable it may be to my cruel and implacable enemies, who, without cau&s;e, have a|vowed their intentions to ruin me, and who, if ju&s;tice is not denied me, will be held up to the public in their true clours.</P>
<P>Upon application to the &s;ecretary of congre&s;s, for copies of all the papers relative to the charges again&s;t me, I have been informed, that I cannot have the report of the committee of congre&s;s, or the letters which pa&s;&s;ed between them and the &s;upreme executive council, without an order of congre&s;s, which I now reque&s;t, as tho&s;e papers are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to lay before the court martial, that the affair may appear in a proper point of light. A court martial can never, I pre&s;ume, &s;uppo&s;e congre&s;s would have ordered me tried for charges, of which their committee had acquitted me. If therefore the report of the committee, or any other papers, tending to elucidate the affair, is withheld from the court martial, it will, doubtle&s;s, operate on their minds to my di&s;advantage, and a fair trial can by no means be obtained. As the committee of congre&s;s have acted as a court of enquiry, I have an undoubted right (agreeable to the cu&s;toms of all &s;uch courts) to the whole proceedings, and every paper relative to the matter. This, I pre&s;ume, congre&s;s will not deny me. I therefore reque&s;t, that they will be plea&s;ed to order copies of tho&s;e letters, report, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> delivered me as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, as the court martial is ordered to &s;it for my trial on the fir&s;t of May.</P>

<P>AS congre&s;s cannot po&s;&s;ibly comply with your reque&s;t, the committee can make no report, that will be of any &s;ervice to you. You cannot have a copy of the report you refer to, nor of the letters which pa&s;&s;ed between the committees, becau&s;e, on the late conference and accommodation between congre&s;s and the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, tho&s;e proceedings are to cea&s;e, and not to be brought again into view or di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. The whole of the evidence, which relates to the charges on which you are to be tried, is tran&s;mitted to general Wa&s;hington, with the charges, and there is nothing kept back, which you could avail your&s;elf of in your defence. As to the re&s;olutions of the report acquitting you of particular charges, they were founded, you know, on <HI>ex parte</HI> hearing. The committee were obliged to fini&s;h the report, and as the executive council, from &s;ome difference between their committee and the committee of congre&s;s, would not produce the evidence in &s;upport of tho&s;e charges, the committee took up the evidence offered on your part, and pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;olutions of acquittal; but the executive council and congre&s;s having &s;ettled the mi&s;under&s;tandings between the committees, and congre&s;s not having decided on the report, and the &s;aid executive council having offered to produce the evidence before a court martial, the re&s;olutions of the committee can have no operation whatever: when we therefore come to report on your late applica|tion, we mu&s;t report, that your application cannot be complied with.</P>

<P>This report was never acted upon by congre&s;s, the council of Penn&s;ylvania having had &s;ufficient influ|ence and addre&s;s to qua&s;h any proceedings upon it: my reputation thus became for &s;ome time longer a &s;a|crifice to what I charitably &s;uppo&s;e was deemed by congre&s;s a nece&s;&s;ary <HI>&s;tate policy,</HI> to which individuals, however inconvenient, mu&s;t &s;ometimes, without repining, &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>I have now gone through all the charges exhibited again&s;t me; and have given to each &s;uch an an&s;wer as I thought it de&s;erved. Are they all, or are any of them &s;upported by truth and evidence? or rather, does not each of them appear to this honourable court to be totally de&s;titute of every &s;emblance of a foundation in fact? and yet ba&s;ele&s;s as they them&s;elves are, they were intended to &s;upport a fabric; with the weight of which, attempts were made to cru&s;h my reputation and fortunes: I allude to the prelimi|nary re&s;olution of the council, containing &s;evere but general &s;trictures upon my character and conduct; &s;trictures of &s;uch a &s;erious and important nature, that they them&s;elves were &s;en&s;ible the public would not think them ju&s;tified in making them, unle&s;s upon the mo&s;t unque&s;tionable grounds. Let them now be mea&s;ured by their own &s;tandard. Had they unque&s;tionable grounds to go upon? Why then, in op|po&s;ition to every principle of candour and ju&s;tice, in oppo&s;ition to their own ideas of candour and ju&s;tice, did they make and publi&s;h re&s;olutions, containing cen&s;ures of &s;uch a high import again&s;t me?</P>
<P>An artful appearance of tenderne&s;s, and regard for my &s;ervices, by which the council are plea&s;ed to &s;ay, I <HI>formerly</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed my&s;elf, is held forth in the introduction to their charges. Did they mean by this to pour bal&s;am, or to pour poi&s;on into my wounds? I leave it to this court, and to the world to judge, whether they intended it to balance the demerits, they then urged again&s;t me, by my former good conduct, as far as it would go; or whether they de&s;igned it as a &s;ting to their charges, by per&s;uading the public, that my demerits were &s;o enormous, that even the greate&s;t and mo&s;t unaffected tenderne&s;s for my character, would not excu&s;e them in continuing &s;ilent any longer.</P>
<P>If, in the cour&s;e of my defence, I have taken up the time of the court longer than they expected, they
<PB N="55" REF="017047_0054_0F9FBDED873B6508">will, I tru&s;t, impute it to the nature of the accu&s;ations again&s;t me; many of which, though not imme|diately before you as charges, were alledged as facts, and were of &s;uch a complexion as to render it nece&s;|&s;ary to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations upon them; becau&s;e they were evidently calculated to rai&s;e a prejudice again&s;t me, not only among the people at large, but in the minds of tho&s;e who were to be judges.</P>
<P>I have looked forward with plea&s;ing anxiety to the pre&s;ent day, when, by the judgment of my fellow &s;oldiers, I &s;hall (I doubt not) &s;tand honourably acquitted of all the charges brought again&s;t me, and again &s;hare with them the glory and danger of this ju&s;t war.</P>

<P>The court met agreeable to adjournment, and having con&s;idered the &s;everal charges exhibited again&s;t general Arnold, the evidence produced on the trial, and his defence, are of opinion, with re&s;pect to the fir&s;t charge, that he gave permi&s;&s;ion for a ve&s;&s;el to leave a port in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy, to enter into a port in the united &s;tates, which permi&s;&s;ion, circum&s;tanced as he was, they are clearly of opinion he had no right to give, being a breach of article 5th, &s;ection 18th of the rules and articles of war. Re&s;pecting the &s;econd charge, that although it has been fully proved, that the &s;hops and &s;tores were &s;hut by general Arnold's orders on his arrival in Philadelphia, they are of opinion, that he was ju&s;tifiable in the order by the re&s;o|lution of congre&s;s of the 5th of June, 1778, and his excellency the commander in chief's in&s;tructions of the 18th of June, 1778: and with re&s;pect to the latter part of the &s;ame charge, the making con&s;iderable purcha&s;es while the &s;hops and &s;tores were &s;hut, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> clearly of opinion, that it is entirely un&s;upport|ed, and they do fully acquit general Arnold of it. They do acquit general Arnold of the third charge, Re&s;pecting the fourth charge, it appears to the court, that General Arnold made application to the deputy quarter ma&s;ter general, to &s;upply him with waggons to receive property then in imminent danger from the enemy; that waggons were &s;upplied him by the deputy quarter ma&s;ter general on this application, which had been drawn from the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania for the public &s;ervice; and it al&s;o appears, that ge|neral Arnold intended this application as a private reque&s;t, and that he had no de&s;ign of employing the waggons otherwi&s;e than at his private expence, nor of defrauding the public, nor injuring or imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">ing the public &s;ervice; but con&s;idering the delicacy attending the high &s;tation in which the general acted, and that reque&s;ts from him might operate as commands, they are of opinion, the reque&s;t was imprudent and improper, and that, therefore, it ought not to have been made. The court, in con&s;equence of their determinations re&s;pecting the fir&s;t and la&s;t charges exhibited again&s;t major general Arnold, do &s;entence him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> a reprimand from his excellency the commander in chief.</P>
