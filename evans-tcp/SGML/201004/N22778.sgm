<P>HISTORY no where informs us of any event &s;o extraordinary as the late revolution in France. If viewed on all &s;ides, with its attend|ing circum&s;tances, by an attentive and unprejudiced eye, it mu&s;t &s;urely excite the greate&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment; and tho&s;e who have been u&s;ed to unite in their minds the providence of God with human occurrences, (whether they approve of this great change of things or not,) cannot help inquiring, <HI>Is this from men, or is it from God?</HI> Is it one of tho&s;e commotions produced by the conflicting pa&s;&s;ions of men, that ri&s;e and &s;ink, and are &s;oon forgotten; or is it one of tho&s;e events which mark the great aeras of time, and from which originate new orders of things?&mdash;If the latter, it is undoubtedly the theme of prophecy.</P>
<P>Appearances indicate that this will be a fatal &s;troke to the Papal u&s;urpations, and to the reign of de&s;poti&s;m. Tho&s;e prophecies, there|fore, which direct our hopes to that intere&s;ting period, when all Antichri&s;tian tyrannies are to peri&s;h, de&s;erve, at this time, peculiar attention. But where &s;hall we find a clue to guide us in our inquiries? The author of the following thoughts con&s;ulted commentators the mo&s;t generally approved, on the Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation of John. He found much to edify and excite curio&s;ity, but was &s;till in the mid&s;t of a wilderne&s;s. At length he was determined to commit him&s;elf to his own inve&s;tigations, and explore the&s;e regions of won|ders, without placing implicit confidence in any guide. Circum|&s;tances led him to conjecture, that the bea&s;t which John &s;aw coming up out of the earth, was <HI>Lewis the Fourteenth,</HI> or the French tyranny perfected by him, and &s;upported by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and that it was this bea&s;t which &s;lew the witne&s;&s;es. This is the clue which he has followed, and he thinks it is that by which the mazes of the&s;e wonder|ful vi&s;ions, at lea&s;t as far as they have been accompli&s;hed, may be traced with preci&s;ion, and &s;ome things which are yet to come be con|jectured with great advantage. But without this to guide us, all &s;eems confu&s;ion.</P>

A &s;erious application to the &s;tudy of the prophecies, and an at|tentive ob&s;ervation of the &s;igns of the times, have produced in my mind the &s;tronge&s;t per&s;ua&s;ion, that the utter downfal of the Papacy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of de&s;poti&s;m, the re&s;toration of the Jews, and the renovation of all things, are near at hand; and that every year will a&s;toni&s;h us with new wonders. <HI>"As the days of Noe were, &s;o &s;hall al&s;o the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days that were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, and marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came and took them all way, &s;o &s;hall al&s;o the coming of the Son of Man be</HI>

<P>THE kingdom which God was to &s;et up under the Melliah, accord|ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> prophets was to be a kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s, peace and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>Only us a child is born&mdash;the government &s;hall be upon his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">&mdash;Of the increa&s;e of his government and peace there &s;hall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.&mdash;The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and the lamb &s;hall feed together.

<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. ix. 6, 7.</NOTE>, who have long been the prey of de&s;troyers, and of one another. If we contemplate the principles of the kingdom of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they promi&s;e fair to produce the enjoyment of all that which the prophets predicted. But where is the effect? The annals of the Chri&s;tian world, as well as tho&s;e of the Pagan, di&s;cover to us little more than the hi&s;tory of ambition, &s;uper&s;tition, and blood&s;hed. The career of this kingdom began in piety towards God, and in love and peace to all mankind. But &s;y&s;tems of error, &s;uper&s;tition, and oppre&s;|&s;ion, &s;oon interrupted its progre&s;s, and perverted its principles. Chri&s;t|ianity has been converted into a &s;y&s;tem of commerce, and tho&s;e called the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, have been a corporation of traders in the &s;ouls and liberties of mankind.</P>
<P>Were I to attempt to define the character of <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> I &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>It is all that which oppo&s;es it&s;elf to the kingdom of Chri&s;t, whether it flow from the eccle&s;ia&s;tical or civil powers.</HI> The civil con&s;titutions of nations, as well as the eccle&s;ia&s;tical, &s;o far as they accord with, or have a tendency to promote, that pride and that ambition which lead to op|pre&s;&s;ion, per&s;ecution, and war, are Antichri&s;tian. Whatever in reli|gion is de&s;tructive of union among Chri&s;tians, which leads to domina|tion over con&s;cience, to hinder free enquiry after truth, or any way oppre&s;&s;es and per&s;ecutes men for matters cognizable only by God, is Antichri&s;tian. Whenever there is intolerance: wherever we find conditions of communion among Chri&s;tians impote&s;t, which Chri&s;t hath not clearly enjoined; wherever creeds and modes of wor&s;hip are en|forced by human power, and men are made to forfeit any of their civil rights, or are &s;tigmatized on the&s;e accounts, there is that &s;pirit which is not of God. Wherever one Chri&s;tian, or &s;ect of Chri&s;tians, a&s;&s;umes the &s;eat of authority and judgment in the church of Chri&s;t, whether they call for fire to de&s;troy tho&s;e who di&s;&s;ent from them, or only exclude them from their communion and affection, there is a portion of that &s;pirit of Antichri&s;t which has &s;o long oppo&s;ed it&s;elf to the benign prin|ciples of the kingdom of the Prince of Peace, has been the cau&s;e of &s;o many evils to humanity, and the occa&s;ion of making the incon&s;iderate e&s;teem the amiable religion of Je&s;us, as a &s;ource of mi&s;chief in&s;tead of benevolence? Alas, how much of this &s;pirit remains among&s;t us all! How few have learned, that
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. vii. 19.</NOTE> <HI>in Je&s;us Chri&s;t circumci&s;ion is nothing, and uncircumci&s;ion is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</HI></P>
<P>But we are a&s;&s;ured from the &s;criptures, that all the&s;e u&s;urpations and Antichri&s;tian principles &s;hall have an end; and that the go&s;pel will pro|duce the various happy effects which are predicted. The religion of Chri&s;tians &s;hall then no longer con&s;i&s;t in
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiv. 17.</NOTE> <HI>meat and drink, but in
<PB N="6" REF="030090_0005_0FE47415AA769330">righteou&s;ne&s;s, peace, and joy:</HI> the practice of <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> the cultivation of <HI>harmony,</HI> and the diffu&s;ion of <HI>happine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>The que&s;tion is, When may we hope to &s;ee the&s;e predictions accom|pli&s;hed? Long have a pious few had their eyes fixed on the promi&s;es of God with ardent expectation, and been crying, <HI>How long, O Lord, ere thou wilt avenge the blood of thy &s;aints, and create Jeru&s;alem a quiet dwelling place, and Zion the joy of all the earth? Come, Lord Je&s;us, come quickly!&mdash;Behold I come at an hour when ye think not! ble&s;&s;ed is he that watcheth.</HI></P>
<P>Some &s;uppo&s;e, that all our inquiries about the time of the accompli&s;h|ment of the predictions relative to the downfal of Antichri&s;t, which is to prepare the way for the peaceful kingdom of the Redeemer, are in vain. If &s;o, wherefore is it &s;aid, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy?</HI> Rev. i. 3. <HI>Here is wi&s;|dom, let him that hath under&s;tanding count the number of the bea&s;t,</HI> xiii. 18.</P>
<P>Though the meaning of the prophecies is nece&s;&s;arily wrapt up in modes of expre&s;&s;ion not ea&s;y to be under&s;tood, as they would otherwi&s;e operate again&s;t their own accompli&s;hment; yet they may not be ab&s;o|lutely in&s;erutable; and e&s;pecially when their accompli&s;hment approaches nearer, and increa&s;ing light is ca&s;t upon them by the ari&s;ing of circum|&s;tances connected with them. This &s;eems to be intimated by the angel, Dan. xii. 4, 9, 10. <HI>But thou, O Daniel, &s;hut up the words, and &s;eal the book, even to the time of the end: many &s;hall run to and fro, and knowledge &s;hall be increa&s;ed.&mdash;The words are clo&s;ed up and &s;ealed till the time of the end. None of the wicked &s;hall under&s;tand, but the wi&s;e &s;hall under&s;tand.</HI> The meaning of the&s;e words, according to the learned Dr. Lowth, is, "The nearer the time approaches for the final accompli&s;hment of the prophecy, the more light &s;hall men have for the under&s;tanding it; for the gradual completion of this and other pro|phecies &s;hall direct ob&s;erving readers to form a judgment concerning tho&s;e particulars which are yet to be fulfilled. From hence we may ob&s;erve the rea&s;on of the ob&s;curity of &s;everal prophecies in &s;cripture; and it may be ob&s;erved, that generally tho&s;e prophecies are mo&s;t ob|&s;cure, the time of who&s;e completion is furthe&s;t off. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, in interpreting the prophecies relating to the <HI>latter times</HI> of the world, the judgment of the <HI>latter</HI> writers is to be preferred before that of the <HI>ancients;</HI> becau&s;e the moderns, living nearer the times when the events were to be fulfilled, had &s;urer marks to guide them in their expo&s;itions." Lowth's Expo&s;. Dan. xii. 4. Ver. 9, he paraphra&s;es thus: "Be content with what has been made known to thee, (Daniel): for the fuller explication of this prophecy is deferred till the time of its accompli&s;hment draws near." The opinion then of this learned com|mentater was, that God would &s;o di&s;po&s;e things, that ob&s;erving men &s;hould, from the &s;ign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the times, be led to under&s;tand the true mean|ing of the&s;e prophecies, relating to the latter times of the world, which had not been before under&s;tood, &s;o as hence to fore&s;ee the approaching downfal of Antichri&s;t, and tho&s;e other great events connected with it; and by which means the divine word will be much accredited, men be cured of their infidelity, and God hereby be honoured.</P>
<P>My mind has of late been much affected with the appearances of things in the Chri&s;tian world, and with the occurrences which have, within the&s;e few years, bur&s;t upon us. Occurrences which are unpa|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in the hi&s;tory of nations.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="030090_0006_0FE4741743969C10">
In America a revolution has taken place, which is &s;ingular in its con&s;equences, and e&s;pecially as they concern the &s;tate of religion. We have long been told, that if the Chri&s;tian religion were left unprotected by e&s;tabli&s;hments, and un&s;upported by emoluments, it would &s;oon he borne down, and all its &s;olemnities for&s;aken and de&s;pi&s;ed. The experi|ment has here been made, and fact demon&s;trates the fallacy of &s;uch con|clu&s;ions. The people are ca&s;ed of a heavy burden, and pure and unde|filed religion flouri&s;hes more than ever. Hirelings have withdrawn, but piety and virtue, charity and union increa&s;e. But a few years after this grand event, one of the fir&s;t nations in Enrope, long en&s;laved, and blinded by &s;uper&s;tition, at once broke its chains, and tore away the ban|dages with which Popi&s;h prie&s;ts had bound the eyes of the multitude. Civil liberty had long been forgotten, and, for more than a hundred years, no liberty of con&s;cience was permitted to the in&s;ulted people: And, as a nation, they had for ages been made, by their tyrants, the &s;courge of all their neighbours. This people have, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the whole civilized world, aro&s;e up as in one day, and, in oppo&s;ition to the com|bined power of their king, their prie&s;ts and nobles, have dared to &s;ay, <HI>We will be free&mdash;We will have ju&s;t and equal laws&mdash;No man &s;hall puni&s;h, and no man &s;hall be puni&s;hed, but as the law commands&mdash;The poor as well as the rich &s;hall be protected&mdash;Con&s;cience is the property of God, and every man &s;hall wor&s;hip his Maker as he plea&s;es&mdash;We will never make war, but in &s;elf-defence, and will embrace all men as our bre|thren.</HI> And this was not the re&s;olution of a few, it was the &s;olemn covenant of twenty-&s;ix millions or people. What a phaenomenon in the hi&s;tory of man! What an epoch in the hi&s;tory of the church! But German de&s;pots and their creatures, who&s;e exi&s;tence depends on the ignorance and &s;ervility of mankind, fearing the influence of &s;uch an ex|ample, have been exerting all their power to cru&s;h this ri&s;ing &s;pirit of liberty, and to &s;upport the falling Papacy. By who&s;e hand was it that they and their remnant were driven back with lo&s;s and &s;hame? His, who maketh the <HI>wrath of man to prai&s;e him.</HI>&mdash;Alas! the calamities which oppo&s;ition to the mo&s;t benevolent &s;entiments has occa&s;ioned! The pa&s;&s;ions of men have been enraged, and in the paroxy&s;m of re|&s;entment, fear, and de&s;pair, the be&s;t of cau&s;es, the cau&s;e of liberty, has been &s;tained by the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes which afflict a great majority of their own nation; and all the genuine friends of liberty and ju&s;tice throughout the world. None can contemplate them but with the keene&s;t angui&s;h, except tho&s;e who are watching for occa&s;ions to &s;lander all who re&s;i&s;t oppre&s;&s;ors. The circum&s;tances of this wonderful revolution, mark it as an event of va&s;t importance, and as probably big with con&s;equences beyond all conjecture.</P>
<P>The prophecies re&s;pecting the downfal of the Antichri&s;tian u&s;urpa|tions, mu&s;t have their accompli&s;hment in &s;ome era; it may be the pre&s;|ent. It is therefore &s;urely worth our while to inquire how far the pre|dictions of God's word will agree with the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of known events.</P>
<P>Thus it has appeared to me; and the more I examine and think upon the &s;ubject, the more I am convinced, that the la&s;t days &s;poken of by God's &s;ervants the prophets, are fa&s;t approaching; <HI>when Babylon the Great &s;hall come in remembrance, and God will avenge the blood of his &s;aints, and the kingdoms of this world &s;hall become the kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Chri&s;t;</HI> by not only profe&s;&s;ing the religion of Je|&s;us,
<PB N="8" REF="030090_0007_0FE47421E89CED48">but by acting under its influence, and copying after <HI>his</HI> example, who was meek and lowly in heart, and who came "not to de&s;troy men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lives, but to &s;ave them." And this kingdom &s;hall not be a kingdom of anarchy, but a &s;tate of things, in which the governors and the govern|ed, and all the different ranks in &s;ociety, will unite to promote the gen|eral good. It is not impo&s;&s;ible that the pre&s;ent &s;haking of nations &s;hould bring about this de&s;irable event. Some however object, that the pro|gre&s;s of the French revolution has been marked with too much outrage and blood; and that the per&s;ons engaged in it are of a character too bad to admit it to be from God,&mdash;a work which he approves, and which he intends as the introduction to tho&s;e happy days of which the pro|phets have &s;poken.</P>
<P>It would not be a very difficult ta&s;k to prove, that tho&s;e German princes, and dome&s;tic foes to liberty, who have oppo&s;ed the emancipa|tion of France from the yoke of royal and prie&s;tly tyrants, have been the occa&s;ion of almo&s;t all the horrors which have been committed; and as their hands will much of the blood be required, which has been, or may hereafter be &s;hed, in this mighty and intere&s;ting &s;truggle, between men rou&s;ed up by the &s;everity of their &s;ufferings, to claim the rights they had long been robbed of, and tho&s;e continental tyrants who, for ages, have been the &s;courges of the human race. But granting that the leaders in the French revolution have been as attrociou&s;ly wicked as re|pre&s;ented, this does not, in the &s;lighte&s;t degree, affect our hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P>Though many of the in&s;truments which Providence employs may be unworthy characters, and though the extraneous evil connected with the revolution in France may afflict our hearts, and provoke not only our cen&s;ure, but our indignation, &s;till the great principles of it may de|mand our homage, and the end to be hoped for, the triumphs of truth and ju&s;tice over &s;uper&s;tition, per&s;ecution, and oppre&s;&s;ion, may excite our joy. Cyrus waded through the blood of kings and armies to plun|der the earth, and &s;ubject nations to his will; (he &s;pared not children. I&s;a. xiii. 18.); but we have been taught to venerate his memory, as the righteous man of the ea&s;t. And why? Not becau&s;e all his exploits, us his, were righteous, but becau&s;e we have &s;een the i&s;&s;ue, and been inform|ed, that he was made an in&s;trument in the hand of God, to execute his righteous judgments; that it was <HI>He</HI> who gave nations before him, and made him rate over kings, that Babylon might fit in the du&s;t, and cap|tive I&s;rael go free. What was <HI>Henry the Eighth,</HI> who began our re|formation? A mon&s;ter! Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> were his motives? The gratification of his fulls. What were the means which he employed?&mdash;How blind is man! We only know, that in God dwell the attributes of wi&s;dom, ju&s;|tice, and goodne&s;s, but we are incumble of tracing the &s;phere of their operations. He &s;aw fit to make u&s;e of the Jewi&s;h rulers, and to direct the wor&s;t of human pa&s;&s;ions, for the purpo&s;e of effecting our redemp|tion, by the death of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Are e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tems of &s;uper&s;ti|tion and tyranny to be overthrown by a few &s;mooth words of benevo|lence and wi&s;dom? Happy if they could! Are the dragon and the bea&s;ts which have &s;o depopulated the earth for ages, to peri&s;h without convul&s;ion? Read&mdash;

We know who hath &s;aid, <HI>Love your enemies, and do good to them that hate you.</HI> This is our rule.</P>
<P>Sir I&s;aac Newton had a very &s;agacious conjecture, which he told to Dr. Clark, from which Mr. Whi&s;ton &s;ays be received it, viz. "That the overbearing tyranny and power of the Anchri&s;tian party, which hath &s;o long corrupted Chri&s;tianity, and en&s;laved the Chri&s;tian world, mu&s;t be put a &s;top to and broken to pieces by the <HI>prevalence of infide|lity,</HI> for &s;ome time, before primitive Chri&s;tianity could be re&s;tored; which &s;eems to be the very means now working in Europe for the &s;ame good and great end of Providence." "Po&s;&s;ibly," &s;ays the relater, "he might think that our Saviour's words (Luke, xviii. 8.) imply it. <HI>When the Son of Man cometh, &s;hall he find &s;aith on the earth?</HI> O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|po&s;&s;ibly he might think no other way &s;o likely to do it in human af|fair.

<P>This was a very &s;agacious conjecture indeed; and it is not unlikely that it may &s;oon be realized. There are rea&s;ons for fearing, that are long infidelity will as generally prevail as the name of Chri&s;tianity has done. It is in vain to flatter. It is too evident, that though the Chri&s;|tianity of individuals, among all ranks and &s;ects, has been genuine, yet that of nations has been only in name. <HI>By their fruits &s;hall ye know them.</HI> The generality of governments have been oppre&s;&s;ive; a great majority of the mini&s;ters of religion have not only been men of the world, who have &s;ought after nothing but gain, but they have been cruel lords o|ver God's heritage, per&s;ecuting in&s;tead of feeding the flock; teaching men to hate, oppre&s;s, and murder one another, for opinions; in&s;tead of in|culcating tho&s;e le&s;&s;ons of love taught by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Among the rich and great even the forms of religion are &s;carcely to be found. The &s;peil of the poor is in their hou&s;es, and becau&s;e they are full they forget God, and are waxed wanton. If we de&s;cend, pride, covetou&s;ne&s;s, deceit, oppre&s;&s;ion, riot; impurity, irreligion, r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">piety, perjury, and ba&s;ene&s;s, pre&s;ent them&s;elves, without &s;ecret &s;earch, at every &s;tep. And yet the&s;e are all Chri&s;tians! But be who was taught the religion of Chri&s;t, not by man, but by the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, has &s;aid, <HI>Faith without works is dead.</HI> Alas! they have walked in a vain &s;hew. But it is probable that this di&s;gui&s;e, before the con&s;ummation of all things, will be &s;tripped off, and the nations be made to appear in their true character, and thus may be fulfilled, in a &s;en&s;e that has not been &s;u&s;|pected, that prediction of the prophet I&s;aiah (chap. xxv. 7.) <HI>He will de&s;troy the face of the covering</HI> (the ma&s;k) <HI>ca&s;t over all people, and the vail that is &s;pread over all nations.

<HEAD>FIRST INQUIRY.</HEAD>
<P>IN endeavouring to make good this hypothe&s;is, that <HI>the &s;igns of the times</HI> indicate the &s;peedy downfal of all that &s;piritual and civil tyranny, which for &s;o many ages has prevailed, in oppo&s;ition to the principles of the kingdom of Chri&s;t, the Prince of Peace, there are three inquiries which claim our attention.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t re&s;pects the <HI>dragon</HI> and the <HI>bea&s;ts,</HI> which John &s;aw in his vi&s;ions. Rev. xi. 7. xii. and xiii.</P>
<P>The &s;econd re&s;pects <HI>the witne&s;&s;es,</HI> Rev. xi.&mdash;and the third inquiry is, Whether all numbers of <HI>Daniel</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> which refer to the latter days, will agree with the pre&s;ent times? Let us, with that reverence and devout candour which become us when we apply to the word of God for in&s;truction, attend to the&s;e &s;everal inquiries.</P>
<P>The grand &s;cene of the prophetic vi&s;ions of John opens in the fourth chapter of the Revelation, and is continued to the end of the book. The whole may be con&s;idered as a number of &s;cenic pictures. Chapter the eleventh is a miniature picture of the hi&s;tory of the church (the we&s;tern church e&s;pecially) from the earlie&s;t times to the downfal of all Antichri&s;tian u&s;urpations. The following vi&s;ions are of the &s;ame pic|ture variegated, for our in&s;truction, on a larger &s;cale.</P>
<P>As there are &s;ome, into who&s;e hands tho&s;e pages may fall, who have not been u&s;ed to attend to &s;ubjects like the&s;e which we are going to di&s;cu&s;s, it may be proper briefly to con&s;ider the origin of that &s;ort of language, and of tho&s;e hieroglyphic, or more properly &s;ymbolical, re|pre&s;entations, which we meet with in the prophets.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t mode of writing appears to have been by pictures of things, and it mu&s;t have been a long time before mankind arrived at any degree of perfection in the &s;cience of letters, as we now have it. To expre&s;s ideas by a combination of letters, &s;yllables, words, and &s;entences, is a more wonderful invention than mo&s;t people imagine. The mo&s;t natu|ral way of communicating our conceptions by marks and figures, is by tracing out the images of things; and this is actually verified in the ca&s;e of the Mexicans, who&s;e only method of writing their laws and hi&s;tory, when the Spaniards fir&s;t vi&s;ited them, was by this picture writing. The hieroglyphics and &s;ymbols of the Egyptians and Hebrews, were an improvement on this rude and inconvenient e&s;&s;ay towards writing. It would be improper to enter far into this &s;ubject here; I &s;hall therefore &s;ay no more than ju&s;t what may be thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew that the figurative &s;tyle, and the &s;ymbolical repre&s;entations, which we meet with in the &s;criptures, are not &s;o out of the way as &s;ome may be apt to imagine; nor the workman&s;hip, as Dr. Warburten
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Warburton's Divine Legation, book iv. &s;ect. 4. pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE> expre&s;&s;es it, of the prophet's h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ted and wild imagination, as our modern libertines would per&s;uade us, but the &s;ober, e&s;tabli&s;hed language of their times.</P>
<P>In the &s;ymbols and hieroglyphics of the ancients, a <HI>lion</HI> &s;tood for <HI>&s;trength and courage;</HI> a <HI>bullock</HI> was a repre&s;entation of <HI>agriculture;</HI> a <HI>hor&s;e</HI> of <HI>liberty; a &s;pkinx</HI> of <HI>&s;ubtilty;</HI> a <HI>pelican</HI> of <HI>paternal affec|tion;</HI> a <HI>river-hor&s;e</HI> of <HI>impudence; horns</HI> of <HI>&s;trength</HI> and <HI>pre-eminence.</HI> Among the Phenicians a <HI>horn</HI> was the en&s;ign of <HI>royalty;</HI> and hence
<PB N="11" REF="030090_0010_0FE47426AB5A1948">they came to be u&s;ed by the prophets, to denote <HI>&s;overeignty</HI> and <HI>domi|nation, &s;tates</HI> and <HI>kingdoms.</HI> The <HI>&s;un, moon,</HI> and <HI>&s;tars</HI> al&s;o, were the &s;ymbols of <HI>&s;tates</HI> and <HI>kingdoms, kings, queens,</HI> and <HI>nobility;</HI> their <HI>eclip&s;e</HI> &s;tood for the <HI>temporary</HI> difa&s;ters which afflicted them, and their extinction, for their <HI>entire</HI> overthrow. If this be con&s;idered, we need not wonder at what we meet with in the holy &s;criptures, and e&s;pecially in the prophecies. The prophets &s;peak in the language of the times in which they lived, and repre&s;ent things under &s;ymbols then well under&s;tood; and though this mode of repre&s;enting things is not &s;o u&s;ual among us, yet we have &s;omething of it too. Modern heraldry is a &s;ort of hieroglyphics, and we here meet productions as fictitions and mon&s;trous as a lion with the wings of an eagle, or as a bea&s;t with &s;even heads and ten horns.</P>
<P>In the prophetic writings, fierce and &s;avage bea&s;ts are the hieroglyphic emblems of tyrannic monarchies and &s;tates, and the peculiarities of the&s;e monarchies and &s;tates are repre&s;ented by &s;uitable creatures, and by &s;uch appendages, as are proper to identify them, and de&s;cribe their characters. Thus in Dan. vii. 4. the kingdom of Babylon is repre|pre&s;ented under the image of a <HI>lion with eagle's wings,</HI> to type out, not only its power, but the rapidity of its conque&s;ts, and the height of &s;plendour to which it was rai&s;ed. The kingdom of the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Per|fians,</HI> (ver. 5.) is repre&s;ented by a <HI>bear</HI> with <HI>three ribs in its mouth,</HI> to which it was &s;aid, <HI>Ari&s;e, devour much fle&s;h.</HI> This was to &s;hew the cruelty of the&s;e people, and their greedine&s;s after blood and plunder. Their character was that of the all-devouring bear, which has no pity. The ribs in the mouth of it repre&s;ent tho&s;e nations which they e&s;pecially made a prey of.&mdash;The kingdom of the Macedonians, or Grecians, is characterized (ver. 6.) by a <HI>leopard,</HI> with <HI>four heads,</HI> and <HI>four wings of a fowl.</HI> The leopard is remarkable for its &s;wiftne&s;s; hence, and e&s;pecially with the wings on its back, it was a fit emblem of the con|que&s;ts of the Macedonians under the command of Alexander, who con|quered part of <HI>Europe</HI> and all <HI>A&s;ia</HI> in &s;ix years. As the lion had <HI>two</HI> wings, to repre&s;ent the rapidity of the Babylonian conque&s;ts, &s;o this leopard has <HI>four,</HI> to &s;ignify the &s;wifter progre&s;s of the Macedonians. The <HI>four heads</HI> al&s;o are &s;ignificant. They are intended to repre&s;ent the &s;ame circum&s;tance as the four horns of the he-goat in the eighth chapter. Fifteen years after the death of Alexander, his brother, and two &s;ons being murdered, his kingdom was broken, or divided, by Ca&s;&s;ander, Ly&s;imachus, Ptolemy and Seleucus, into four le&s;&s;er king|doms, which they &s;eized for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s in this place, to take notice, that whereas, in this vi&s;ion in the <HI>&s;eventh</HI> chapter, the <HI>Medo Per&s;ian</HI> empire is repre|&s;ented under the emblem of a <HI>bear,</HI> and that of the <HI>Macedonians</HI> under that of a <HI>leopard;</HI> in that of chapter the eighth, the former is typed out by a ram (ver. 3.) with two horns, one higher thau the other, and the higher came up la&s;t; and the latter by a he-goat, &amp;c. The&s;e were mo&s;t apt repre&s;entations of the&s;e two empires. For a ram was the royal en&s;ign of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as the eagle was that of the Remans, and as the lion is of England; and the figures of rams' heads with horns, the one higher than the other, are &s;till to be &s;een among the remains of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ins of <HI>Per&s;ephlis,</HI> as <HI>Sir John Chardin</HI> takes notice in his travels. That which came up la&s;t was highe&s;t, to denote that the Per&s;ian kingdom, though it was of a later date, &s;hould overtop the Medes, and make a greater figure in the world than the other; as it did from the time of Cyras, under whom the two kingdoms were united in one. A he-go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="12" REF="030090_0011_0FE4742F6CCA8D80">was al&s;o very properly made the type of the <HI>Macedoman</HI> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> empire, for this was the emblem, or, as we now-a-days expre&s;s it, the arms of <HI>Macedon;</HI> and they were called <HI>the goats people,</HI> for <HI>Carquas,</HI> their fir&s;t king, going with a multitude of Greeks, to &s;eek a new habi|tation, was, as it is &s;aid, commanded by the oracle, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ake the go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for his guide; and afterwards, &s;eeing a flock of goats flying from a violent &s;torm, he followed them to <HI>Edeffa,</HI> and there fixed the &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his empire, made the goals his en&s;ign, and called the city Aegeae, or the goats' town. But to return.</P>
<P>The fourth kingdom is repre&s;ented (ver. 7) by a <HI>fourth bea&s;t, dreadful and terrible, and &s;trong exceedingly; and is had great iron teeth, it devoured and brake in pieces, and &s;tamped the re&s;idue with the feet of it. And it was divers from all the bea&s;ts that were before it, and it had ten horns.</HI> This dreadful repre&s;entation made a great impre&s;&s;ion on Daniel's mind, and he therefore inquires particular<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> what this might mean. Ver. 19. <HI>Then I would know the truth of the fourth bea&s;t, which was divers from all the others, exceeding dread|ful.</HI> The angel informed him (ver. 23.) <HI>that the fourth bea&s;t &s;hall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which &s;hall be divers from all king|doms, and &s;hall devour the whole earth, and &s;hall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</HI></P>
<P>That which appeared in the imagination of Nebuchadnezzar as the legs and feet of a great image, who&s;e brightne&s;s was excellent, (Dan. ii. 31&mdash;45.) and the form terrible, is here repre&s;ented to Daniel as a fierce and ravenous bea&s;t. This is the Roman empire, which &s;ucceeded the Macedonian. "This bea&s;t," &s;ays Bi&s;hop Newton, "was &s;o great and horrible, that it was not ea&s;y to find an adequate name for it; and the Roman empire was dreadful and terrible, and &s;trong exceedingly, beyond any of the former kingdoms. It was divers from all kingdoms, not only in its republican from of government, but likewi&s;e in &s;trength and power, and greatne&s;s, length of duration, and extent of dominion. <HI>It devoured and brake in pieces, and &s;tamped the re&s;idue with the feet of it</HI> It reduced Macedon into a Roman province about 168 years; the kingdom of Pergamus about 183 years; Syria about 65 years, and Egypt about 30 years, before Chri&s;t. And be&s;ides the remains of the Macedonian empire, it &s;ubdued many other provinces and king|doms; &s;o that it might, by a very u&s;ual figure, be &s;aid to devour the whole earth, and to tread it down and break it in pieces, and became in a manner, what the Roman writers delighted to call it, <HI>terrarum orbis imperium,</HI> "the empire of the whole world." Ver. 7. <HI>And it had ten horns.</HI> And according to the interpretation of the angel, (ver. 24.) <HI>the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings,</HI> or kingdoms, <HI>that &s;hall ari&s;e. Four kings,</HI> a little before, (ver. 17.) &s;ignify <HI>four kingdoms;</HI> and &s;o here ten kings are ten kingdoms, according to the u&s;ual phra&s;e|ology of &s;cripture.

(ver. 12.) This is no other than the <HI>Popedom,</HI> or Anti|chri&s;t, who hath, rai&s;ed him&s;elf to great power by &s;eizing three prin|cipalities, or kingdoms, which Sir I&s;aac Newton reckons up to be the exarchate of Ravenna, the kingdom of the Lombards, and the &s;enate and dukedom of Rome. And it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ence that the Pope wears a triple crown.</P>
<P>What is here repre&s;ented under the emblem of a <HI>horn</HI> of the <HI>fourth</HI> bea&s;t, is the &s;ame tyranny which is &s;hewn to John (Rev. xiii. 1&mdash;10.) as a bea&s;t. In this all our be&s;t commentators are agreed. Nor let it &s;eem &s;trange that what is here prefigured by the horn of the fourth bea&s;t, the Roman dominion, &s;hould be repre&s;ented in another vi&s;ion, as a bea&s;t with &s;even heads and ten horns. For nothing is more u&s;ual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to de&s;cribe the &s;ame per&s;on or thing under different images, upon dif|ferent occa&s;ions; and be&s;ides, in this vi&s;ion, the &s;piritual tyranny of the Roman empire is not meant to be de&s;cribed at large. Here notice is only given of it in the general repre&s;entation of the Roman domi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; when the time of the appearance of this tyranny draws near, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a more enlarged de&s;cription is given. And what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s here repre&s;ented <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> one image, is there repre&s;ented under two, a dragon and a bea&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> having &s;even heads and ten horns. The &s;lighte&s;t attention is &s;ufficient to convince us that the horn here, and the fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t in Rev. xiii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>The &s;aints are &s;aid to be given into the hand of the horn for a time, times, and dividing of times, and it is given to the bea&s;t to continue forty and two months, and in Rev. xi. 3. it is &s;aid to be 1260 days. The &s;ame period of time is meant; for a time is a year, times two years, and the dividing of times, half a year, that is, three years and a half (or forty-two months of thirty-days) which are the &s;ame as the 1260 days; for the ordinary Jewi&s;h year con&s;i&s;ted of 360 days, which multiplied by three and a half, amount to that number. And in the pro|phetic &s;tyle, a day is reckoned for a year. Compare Numb. xiv. 34. Ezek. iv. 6, Dan. iv. 16. xii. 7. Rev. xi. 2, 3. xii. 14. xiii. 5. This continuance &s;ignifies, that he is to practi&s;e and pro&s;per thus long, for the Greek word refers to the time of his prevailing, not of his exi&s;ting. He will exi&s;t a little longer, for he will be &s;ome time a &s;laying after he is attacked.</P>
<P>Thus, as preparatory to the con&s;ideration of the following &s;ubjects, I have endeavoured, in as brief a way as po&s;&s;ible, to &s;hew the origin of hieroglyphic or &s;ymbolical repre&s;entations, and the aptne&s;s and pro|priety of &s;uch as we have in the writings of the prophets. We will now enter upon our inquiries.</P>
<P>Let us fir&s;t con&s;ider the vi&s;ions in the twelfth and thirteenth chapters, and e&s;pecially the vi&s;ion of the &s;econd bea&s;t, chap. xiii. 11&mdash;18. for if the&s;e be under&s;tood, we &s;hall have a key to unlock, not only the my&s;teries of the eleventh chapter, but of many others which follow. Chap. xii. 3. <HI>And there appeared another wonder in heaven, and behold a great red dragon, having &s;even heads and ten horns, and &s;even crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the &s;tars of heaven, and did ca&s;t them to the earth,</HI> &amp;c. Mo&s;t of the authors whom I have con&s;ulted, though they allow this chapter to contain a repre&s;entation of the per&s;ecutions of Pagan Rome, yet have &s;trangely &s;piritualized this dragon, &s;o that whil&s;t we are cautioned of our danger from invi&s;ible &s;pirits, the true object is forgotten, and we beat the air.</P>
<P>There can be no doubt, but the devil is a principal agent in all ty|rannies, eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil; but what is here repre&s;ented by the mo&s;t terrific imagery, appears to be no other than that cruel civil tyran|ny of the Romans, which ca&s;t down all the powers, and &s;wept away all the remains of liberty, in Europe, the then &s;uppo&s;ed third part of the world; and which, while the imperial head remained in full power, per|&s;ecured with unrelenting cruelty the church of Chri&s;t in its infancy; and under all the de&s;poti&s;ms which have ari&s;en from it, has, more or le&s;s, continued to oppo&s;e the kingdom of Chri&s;t. If we compare what is &s;aid of the <HI>dragon</HI> in this book with P&s;al. lxxiv. 13, 14. I&s;a. xxvii. 1. li. 9. P&s;al. lxxxvii. 4. lxxxix 10. Ezek. xxix. 2&mdash;5. and xxxii. 2. it much confirms our hypothe&s;is. The tyranny of Egypt, which oppre&s;|&s;ed and per&s;ecuted the people of I&s;rael, was the type of this; but as this is &s;o much more cruel, additional tropes are therefore crowded together, to impre&s;s us with its enormity; and it is not only the <HI>dragon</HI> and the <HI>&s;erpent,</HI> but the <HI>devil</HI> and <HI>&s;atan.</HI> While the <HI>fir&s;t bea&s;t</HI> in the next chapter is the repre&s;entation of <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> or <HI>&s;piritual</HI> tyranny, as exerci&s;ed by the Antichri&s;tian clergy, this dragon repre&s;ents the civil tyranny exerci&s;ed by the Roman Emperors, and by their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, &s;o far as they have been, or are tyrannic, in the &s;everal kingdoms which

Nor was this Papal bea&s;t backward in exerting the power which he had acquired from the liberality of the im|perial dragon, but quickly enjoined all &s;orts of abominations, and en|forced acquie&s;cence, on pain of death, with all his profane and bla&s;phe|mous preten&s;ions. Thus encouraged, he went on his impious career, enjoining not only the wor&s;hip of &s;aints and angels, but of images and relies, teaching that he was God's vicegerent and Chri&s;t's vicar on earth; and that, as &s;uch, he had power to grant indulgences, and to pardon &s;ins, and thus, by the&s;e, and a great many other abominable dogmas, he bl&s;a&s;phemed and &s;candalized the perfections, prerogatives, and laws of God; and di&s;honoured the memory of them that dwell in heaven, as if they approved of &s;uch wicked idolatry and prie&s;tly craft&mdash;And not only was this eccle&s;ia&s;tical power exerci&s;ed at Rome, but over di&s;tant and numerous nations, and great has been the &s;laughter which he has made among tho&s;e, who, in re&s;pect to the divine authority, and the rights of con&s;cience, have rejected his abominable errors, and re&s;i&s;ted his arro|gant preten&s;ions.

The &s;tory which lies before me, related by Mr. <HI>Bion,</HI> chaplain on board the Supurbe Galley in 1703, and who was converted from Pope|ry, by means of the &s;cene of &s;uffering and patience, which was exhibit|ed on board that ve&s;&s;el, when eighteen Prote&s;tants were ba&s;tinadoed for refu&s;ing to bow the knee, in honour of the my&s;teries of the ma&s;s, is too excrutiating to tell. As al&s;o the &s;ufferings of poor <HI>M. Marolles,</HI> a gentleman of virtue, &s;en&s;ibility, and eminent piety, condemned to &s;uffer in the gallies, among the vile&s;t of felons, and this for no crime but what &s;tate policy made &s;uch. This little &s;tory leaves a deeper &s;tain of ba&s;e|ne&s;s upon the character of <HI>Lewis</HI> and his court, than, perhaps, all their other enormities. It was adding that &s;ort of wanton cruelty to &s;late oppre&s;&s;ion, which is peculiarly abhorent in the e&s;timation of a generous mind. And let us remember, this &s;ame &s;y&s;tem of de&s;poti&s;m and per&s;e|cution remained till overthrown in 1789. None of the&s;e cruel laws again&s;t the Prote&s;tants were repealed, nor a particle of arbitrary power &s;urrendered. Thus, in that country from whence the light of reforma|tion fir&s;t i&s;&s;ued, and where there were more faithful witne&s;&s;es again&s;t the Papal apo&s;tacy than in any other nation of the world; and from who&s;e number and influence, and the laws in their favour, the old per&s;e|cuting power was greatly reduced; there, the uncontrouled reign of of Antichri&s;t was re&s;tored.</P>

Though this is the word gene|rally u&s;ed to denote proper miracles, yet it is as often u&s;ed in other &s;en|&s;es.

<P>It appears to me that this figurative repre&s;entation of the exploits of this b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t, de&s;igns nothing more than tho&s;e violent means and &s;educing arts which this tyrant (or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tyrants) was to u&s;e, as &s;o many arguments to bring men into his mea&s;ures, and to frighten them into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his impo&s;itions. His great wonders were his alarming e|dicts; and the &s;ire which he made to come down from heaven on the earth, in the &s;ight of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, &s;ignifies, in the hieroglyphic and highly figur|ative language of prophecy, the thunder of excommunication which he &s;ent forth again&s;t tho&s;e who refu&s;ed to acknowledge his authority in re|ligion, and the war and de&s;truction which he carried on again&s;t all tho&s;e who &s;tood our again&s;t Papery; pretending (as all tyrants ever have done) to have authority from Heaven for all the&s;e abominations. Every iota of this agrees with the practices and preten&s;ions of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P><HI>And he commanded that they &s;hould make an image to the bea&s;t, which had the wound by a &s;word and did live,</HI> i. e.

The eccle&s;i|a&s;tical tyranny now e&s;tabli&s;hed was peculiar; it was at once independ|ent, and yet in &s;upport of the tyranny of the Papal bea&s;t. In all the other kingdoms where Popery prevails, the &s;piritual power is exerci&s;ed by the Pope; hereties, as they are called, are accu&s;ed, tried, and con|demned in his courts, by virtue of laws i&s;&s;uing from him, and by his mini&s;ters. The kings are only his executioners.

Thus, by virtue of powers derived from the king, and not from the Pope, the Prote&s;tants were accu&s;ed, pur&s;ued<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tried, condemned, and executed. This was a tyranny perfect in us kind, and unknown in other countries; the &s;imilitude of the bea&s;t which had the wound by a &s;word and did live&mdash;the <HI>bea&s;t,</HI> of <HI>Rome.

<P>Thus far, I think, the likene&s;s is perfect; and allowing <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. or the French tyranny, brought to perfection by him, and &s;upported by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, to be the object of the vi&s;ion, it appears ea&s;y to be un|der&s;tood; but on every other hypothe&s;is which I have &s;een, it is encu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|bered with inexplicable difficulties.

<P>Although &s;o much &s;tre&s;s is not, perhaps, to be laid upon the foll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ing way of calculating this number of the &s;econd bea&s;t, yet it is worth taking notice of; and po&s;&s;ibly the Holy Spirit might point out that, by a remarkable providence, a twofold way of counting this number &s;hould be afforded, that thus the identity of the per&s;on and tyranny might by more clearly a&s;certained.

<P>Thus, though other tyrannies may have &s;ome of the features of this bea&s;t, yet that of the <HI>Capets</HI> only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them all; and, if I am not deceived, there is every proof which can be expected, proof which a|mounts much neater to a demon&s;tration than is u&s;ual on &s;uch &s;ubj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, that the French monarchy was the &s;econd bea&s;t which came up out of the earth.

<P>What follows is &s;till more highly figurative. Ver. 5, 6. <HI>And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and de|voureth their enemies.

The&s;e have power to &s;hut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters, to turn th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n to blood, and to &s;mite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.</HI> What is here affirmed, has never been literally fulfilled, nor is it likely that it ever will. There is &s;ome &s;imilarity between the&s;e plague<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and tho&s;e to be inflicted under the fir&s;t four vials. Rev. xvi. <HI>There,</HI> on the pouring out of the fir&s;t vial, <HI>there fell a grievous &s;ore up|on the men who had the mark of the bea&s;t, and upon them who wor&s;hip|ped his image; here,</HI> the witne&s;&s;es <HI>&s;mit the earth with all plagues.&mdash; There,</HI> on the pouring out of the <HI>&s;econd</HI> and <HI>third</HI> vials, the &s;ea and the rivers became blood; <HI>here,</HI> the witne&s;&s;es turn the waters into blood, and re&s;train the rain of heaven. <HI>There,</HI> on pouring out the fourth vial upon the &s;un, men were &s;corched with great heat; <HI>here,</HI> fire proceeds out of the mouths of the witne&s;&s;es to devour their enemies.

<P>Before I offer my interpretation of this number, there is one con|&s;ideration which claims our attention. On a careful examination, we &s;hall find, in all the predictions of the prophets, that although they give us a&s;&s;urance of the facts, yet the time of their accompli&s;hment is left in a &s;tate of uncertainty. And even where dates are fixed, as in the predic|tions re&s;pecting the return of the Jews from Babylon, after 70 years cap|tivity, and the appearance of the Me&s;&s;iah after 70 weeks, or 490 years; yet the commencement of the&s;e periods, or the mode of calculation, is involved in ob&s;curity, till light is thrown upon them by the event. It never was intended that men &s;hould know with certainty when any fu|ture event is to take place, and this for an obvious rea&s;on. The pro|phecies, we &s;hould remember, were de&s;igned not to gratify our <HI>curio&s;ity,</HI> but to confirm our <HI>faith</HI> in the truth of the divine word, by their accom|pli&s;hment. And hence the nece&s;&s;ity that the&s;e <HI>three days and a half</HI> &s;hould have a different meaning from the common prophetic days, that thus the time might not &s;o ea&s;ily be a&s;certained, till the accompli&s;hment &s;hould lead men to their true intention.

<P>Originally, the Jews mea&s;ured their months by the &s;un, and then every month con&s;i&s;ted of thirty days.

But before we enter upon the con&s;ideration of the vials, permit me to adduce &s;ome authorities, which, e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider the time when they were written, more than a hundred years ago, tend very much to &s;trengthen the argument in favour of my hypothe&s;is re&s;pecting the wit|ne&s;&s;es, their &s;laying and re&s;urrection. The fir&s;t I &s;hall mention is <HI>Peter Jurieu,</HI> a French Prote&s;tant mini&s;ter, who&s;e works were publi&s;hed in Engli&s;h in 1687. He &s;ays, "The tenth part of the city which here fell, will, at &s;ome future time, appear to be the kingdom of France, where a revolution will take place about the year 1785, and a &s;eparation from the Papacy follow, when the names of Monks and Nuns, of Carmelites, Augu&s;tines, Dominicans, &amp;c. &s;hall peri&s;h for ever, and all tho&s;e vain titles, and armorial bearings, which &s;erve for ornament and pride, &s;hall vani&s;h; and brotherly love make all men equal. Not that there &s;hall be no di&s;tinctions; for it is not a kingdom of anarchy, but government &s;hall then be without pride and in&s;olence, without tyranny and violence, and &s;ubjects &s;hall obey their governors with an humble &s;pirit." The time required, according to this author, after the quickening of the wit|ne&s;&s;es (<HI>i. e.</HI> from the time of the revolution) to de&s;troy Autichri&s;t, will be twenty-five years; and that it will take about &s;eventy years more for the aboli&s;hing of &s;ects and parties among Chri&s;tians, and for the conver|&s;ion of the Jews and Heathens. "And all this" he &s;ays, "cannot be broughtabout without confu&s;ion and tumult. The Popi&s;h empire cannot fall, but it mu&s;t cau&s;e blood and a mighty noi&s;e." Thus far <HI>Juricu.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. Goodwin, who wrote a hundred and fifty years &s;ince, in his <HI>Ex|po&s;ition upon the Revelation,</HI> Part I. chap. 7. has a great deal which is as a&s;toni&s;hing as it is appo&s;ite to the pre&s;ent argument.

<P>Sect. 5th. he &s;ays, on Rev. xi.

<P>The &s;ingular agreement of pre&s;ent events with what the&s;e authors fore|told from the prophecies, &s;o many years ago, is a circum&s;tance which merits the &s;erious attention of all wi&s;e and con&s;iderate men; for it cer|tainly adds great weight to the conjecture, that what has taken place in France, is the beginning of the final downfal of the Papal u&s;urpations and tyrannies. And if it &s;hould be &s;o, woe be to them who attempt to uphold what God has willed to fail!

<P>As to the gathering of the harve&s;t and vintage in the fourteenth chap|ter, the time &s;eems not yet come for their elucidation.

Dr <HI>Gill</HI> and diners have &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Preteilant nations will again return to Popery, and per&s;ecute with great violence. But Dr <HI>Goodwin's</HI> idea is more probable.

It &s;trikes me, that although the <HI>vial</HI> which is to be poured out upon the <HI>earth,</HI> will commence fir&s;t, and that on the <HI>&s;ea</HI> follow, yet their failing &s;treams will mingle; and although the fall torrent of the latter <HI>vials</HI> may not commence, yet &s;ome &s;mall portion of them may be da&s;hed upon the rivers, the &s;un, or the throne of the bea&s;t, while the fir&s;t are pouring out; and although the plagues of the latter vials will com|mence la&s;t, as in the vi&s;ion, yet the &s;treams of the former may &s;till be cunning. The angel's &s;aying of this woe, that it cometh <HI>quickly,</HI> and the encum&s;tance of the &s;even angels with their vials all appearing, and being &s;ent out at the &s;ame time, &s;uppo&s;es that they will all be employed together, to execute their mi&s;&s;ions on the leveral objects of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure.

<P>Were I to detail half the opinions of authors on the following objects of the Divine vengeance, adding to them my own conjectures, this pam|phlet would &s;well into a folio; but as I apprehend that the events which are here repre&s;ented have not yet taken place, or at mo&s;t, are but now commencing, my reflections &s;hall be &s;hort.</P>
<P>Ver. 2. <HI>And the fir&s;t went and poured out his vial upon the earth, and there fell a noi&s;ome and grievous fore upon the men which had the mark of the bea&s;t, and upon them which wor&s;hipped his image.</HI> The pouring out of this vial upon the earth may po&s;&s;ibly refer to &s;ome particu|lar country on the main, where the judgments of God are to commence; or, perhaps, we may be taught by this emblem, that the downfal of the Antichri&s;tian kingdom &s;hall begin with terrible wars on land, in which God's wrath &s;hall be manife&s;ted again&s;t tho&s;e armies of land forces which have for &s;o many ages been the ba&s;is of tyrannic power, and who, at the nod of de&s;pots, have &s;laughtered their fellow-creatures, without either thinking or caring about the ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice of the cau&s;e; who have been the ba&s;e in&s;truments, without a motive, of de&s;olating nations, and of carrying unnumbered woes from one end of the earth to the other. But the time of judging the cau&s;e of the dead is come, and both they who have the <HI>mark</HI> of the bea&s;t, i. e. who are the &s;ubjects and &s;laves of the Papacy, and they who <HI>wor&s;hip,</HI> or only &s;erve and endeavour to &s;upport the image of the bea&s;t, (which, according to what appears from chap. xiii. is the tyranny of the Antichri&s;tian party in France, all &s;uch as &s;erve this image of the bea&s;t, though not Papi&s;ts and flaves to Rome) &s;hall experience &s;uch ena&s;ti&s;ements and di&s;appointments in their attempts to &s;upport what God has determined to overthrow, and &s;uch violent and &s;ucce&s;sful attacks on their power, that they &s;hall be deeply wounded,

<P>Ver. 4. <HI>And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of water, and they became blood,</HI> &amp;c.

The calamities which are to at|tend this vial, are to be peculiarly grievous. This may be concluded from the following circum&s;tance: <HI>I heard the angel of the waters &s;ay, Thou art righteous, O Lord!&mdash;Thou ha&s;t given them blood to drink, for they are worthy.</HI> The former judgments pa&s;s in &s;ilent &s;olemnity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> though the objects of them were le&s;s con&s;picuous in guilt, but no &s;ooner is this vial poured out than it excites acclamations of prai&s;e.

The blazing &s;tar, or comet, which fell upon the third part of the rivers and fountains of water, chap. viii. 10. appears to have head its fulfilment in the wars which laid wa&s;te the countries <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|dering on the Danube, the Rhine, and the Po, and e&s;pecially the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> latter, when Attila, with his Hun, made his terrible irruption, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the year 45^2: it will therefore be worth our while to ob&s;erve the prog|re&s;s of things in the&s;e countries.</P>

<P>To times yet to come are &s;uch prophecies as the&s;e to be referred. I&s;a. xiv. 24.

"Come, my people, enter into thy chambers, hide thy&s;elf, as it were, for a little moment, until the indig|nation be overpa&s;t. For behold the Lord cometh out of his place, to puni&s;h the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity. The earth al&s;o &s;hall di&s;clo&s;e her blood, and &s;hall no more cover her &s;lain. In that day (chap. xxvii. 1.) the Lord, with his &s;ore, and great, and &s;trong &s;word, &s;hall puni&s;h leviathen, the piercing &s;erpent, even leviathen that crook|ed &s;erpent, and he &s;hall &s;lay the dragon that is in the &s;ea."

In Zech. xiii. 7-9. there &s;eems to be a prediction of the &s;ame times.

Part of ver&s;e 7. at lea&s;t the &s;en&s;e of it, is applied (Matth. xxvi. 31.) to the &s;cattering of Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples at his death. <HI>I will &s;mite the Shepherd, and the &s;heep of the flock &s;hall be &s;cattered abroad.</HI> But this appears to have been only an accommodation of this pa&s;&s;age, or of the &s;en&s;e of this and of other pa&s;&s;ages, a u&s;ual practice with the New-Te&s;tament writers. (See Matth. ii. 15-17. xiii. 35. John xv. 25.) Or our Lord might &s;peak thus in conformity to a com|mon-place maxim. "Smite the &s;hepherd, cut off the leader, and his followers will di&s;per&s;e." The thread of the prophecy &s;eems to require a different interpretation than what has been u&s;ually given to this pa&s;|&s;age. Unity of de&s;ign &s;hould always be attended to in the &s;tudy of the prophetic writings, as well as of other compo&s;itions; nor &s;hould we &s;uppo&s;e &s;o violent a break in the di&s;cour&s;e of a prophet, as &s;ome &s;up|po&s;e here, unle&s;s we &s;hould be involved in an evident contradiction without it.</P>
<P>In chap. xi. is predicted the rejection of the Me&s;&s;iah by the Jews, and their puni&s;hment and di&s;per&s;ion on this account. In chap. xii. we have their return and conver&s;ion. In the beginning of the xiiith the pardoning grace which &s;hall be extended to them. Then follows the de&s;truction of idolatry, and the contempt under which the Antichri&s;tian-clergy, who have the mark of the bea&s;t in their hands, (Rev. xiv. 9.) and who have worn garments to deceive the &s;imple, &s;hall fall, and the &s;hifts to which they &s;hall be reduced to e&s;cape the vengeance of man|kind.</P>

The bea&s;t and the fal&s;e prophet are taken
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>* Rev. xix. 20.&mdash;But perhaps &s;ome inqui&s;itive mind may &s;ay, The bea&s;t of Rome &s;piritual tyranny, and the fal&s;e prophet, the bea&s;t of France, his reat &s;upporter, are taken, and exemplary ju&s;tice is in|flicted on them for their abominations, but the dragon, civil tyran|ny, is not taken with them. No; he aro&s;e fir&s;t, and he will continue longe&s;t. But his career is &s;hort. Chap. xx. And I &s;aw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomle&s;s pit. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old &s;erpent, which is the devil and Sa|tan, and bound him a thou&s;and years. And ca&s;t him into the bot|tomle&s;s pit, and &s;hut him up, and &s;et a &s;eal upon him, that he &s;hould deceive the nations no more till the thou&s;and years &s;hould be fulfilled: and after that he mu&s;t be loo&s;ed a little &s;ea&s;on. Now commences the fir&s;t re&s;urrection, as predicted by Ezekiel (chap. xxxvii.) Now the Jews, and others with them, will find that mercy which will be as life from the dead (Rom. xi. 15.) And as Elias lived in John the Bapti&s;t, &s;o &s;hall the former confe&s;&s;ors and martyrs live in the Chri&s;tians of this generation. And they &s;hall &s;it upon thrones of judgment, and act &s;o much under the influence of go&s;pel principles, and e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch &s;y&s;|tems of ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s, that tyranny, which has bound &s;o many, &s;hall it&s;elf be bound, and be ca&s;t into the bottomle&s;s pit. Now liberty and peace, righteou&s;ne&s;s and joy, will reign undi&s;turbed, for what is here termed a thou&s;and years; after which the dragon is to be loo&s;ed for a little &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The events here predicted are evidently the &s;ame with tho&s;e fore|told in Ezek. xxxvii. xxxviii. and xxxix. and in Zech. xiv. What length of time then are we to under&s;tand by the&s;e thou&s;and years? I &s;uppo&s;e that all which is here &s;aid is figurative, and that the years are not what we generally under&s;tand by this term. I am inclined to judge thus for two rea&s;ons. Not only from a compari&s;on of the differ|ent prophecies concerning the return of the Jews, the after per&s;ecu|tions of Gog and Magog, &amp;c. which do not &s;eem to allow of &s;o long a term as a thou&s;and years between the &s;hutting up of the dragon and his loo&s;ing, but al&s;o from the general prophetic u&s;e of &s;uch terms. Days, weeks, &amp;c. In the prophecies are generally u&s;ed in a my&s;tical &s;en&s;e, and for the obvious rea&s;on which has been mentioned. I &s;up|po&s;e therefore, that by this thou&s;and years, a thou&s;and weeks or months are intended. Time only can a&s;certain this; but I think the other prophecies re&s;train this period to a thou&s;and weeks, or a little more than nineteen years. The proper and u&s;ual meaning of the Greek word is a year, but prophetically it may, perhaps, &s;tand for any change or revolution of time. John was a Jew, let us therefore examine the Hebrew word for a year, and hear what Buxtorf &s;ays, Shanah Annus, ab&s;teratione dictus, quod &s;ole, ad punctum, unde di|grediceperat, redeunte, iteretur, &amp; in &s;e&s;ua per ve&s;tigia &s;emper vol|vatur &amp; redeat, Now &s;eeing that the word year in Hebrew means a repetition, or revolving round and returning by the &s;ame &s;teps, this is as applicable to a week as a year.</P>
<P>Thus it appears probable from the prophecies, that after the bloody dragon, civil tyranny, who&s;e horrid character no objects in vi&s;ible na|ture are &s;ufficiently vile to repre&s;ent; after this crafty &s;erpent, which is the devil and &s;atan, has been confined for about nineteen years, he will again get out of his pri&s;on, and make a de&s;perate effort again&s;t the kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s, peace, and joy; but He who, by his provi|dential judgments, ca&s;t the bea&s;t and the fal&s;e prophet into the lake of fire, will manife&s;t him&s;elf in &s;till more con&s;picuous judgments, and ca&s;t this dragon into the &s;ame place of torment, and thus put an ever|la&s;ting end to all tyranny, eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil.&mdash;Now a pro&s;pect opens, which tran&s;ports the heart, and figures are u&s;ed proportioned to the &s;ublimity and felicity of the &s;cenes which follow.

The next object in the vi&s;ion is an <HI>he-goat,</HI> (ver. 5.) which came from the we&s;t, with a notable horn between his eyes. This, the angel Tays, (ver. 21.) is the king of Grecia, the Grecian empire, and the great horn between his eyes, the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> king, or kingdom, under Alexander, his brother, and two &s;ons. This horn was broken, (ver. 8.) and after it came up four others; the four empires which &s;prung up out of the conque&s;ts of Alexander. <HI>And out of one of them came a little horn,</HI> (ver. 9.) <HI>which waxed exceed|ing great, toward the &s;outh, and toward the ea&s;t, and toward the plea&s;ant land, and by him the place of the daily &s;acrifice was taken away, and the place of his &s;anctuary was ca&s;t down,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>It &s;eems natural to reckon the&s;e 2300 days (or years) either from the fir&s;t part of the vi&s;ion, the pu&s;hing of the ram, or the latter end, the violences of the little horn, or from the time when Daniel &s;aw the vi&s;ion

What a pu&s;h was this for conque&s;t! And, (though he had been pu&s;hing for three or four years before, yet) nothing el&s;e forbidding it, what period could be more proper for the angel to begin his reckoning from? He pa&s;&s;ed the Helle&s;pont B. C. 480: four years before this he pu&s;hed at Egypt and reduced it; the next year he pre|pared for this inva&s;ion; the following he entered into a league with the Carthaginians again&s;t the Greeks, and in the year 481 B. C. marches as far as Sardis, on his way towards Greece, where he winters, and in the &s;pring pa&s;&s;es the Helle&s;pont.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e we &s;ix the year 481 B. C. for the commencement of Dani|el's 2300 years, (allowing our chronology to be correct), this carries us to the year of Chri&s;t 1819, when the &s;anctuary and ho&s;t are no longer to be trodden under foot. <HI>i. e.</HI> the land of Pale&s;tine is no longer to be in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemies of the Jews, but they are to be re|&s;tored, and the church freed from Antichri&s;tian abominations.</P>
<P>But it may be objected, that as the Jewi&s;h year con&s;i&s;ted but of 360 days, <HI>five days</HI> and a <HI>quarter</HI> &s;hort of our &s;olar year, this will make a difference of <HI>thirty-one</HI> years &s;hort. To which I an&s;wer, A &s;ingle Jewi&s;h year con&s;i&s;ted but of 360 days, and when we con&s;ider three or four years only, this mode of reckoning may be admitted, but, as we have leap years to regulate our mea&s;urement of time, &s;o had the Jews. When it was nece&s;&s;ary, they intercalated their month Ador; &s;ometimes even a whole month, and this they were obliged to do to make their fea&s;ts of the <HI>Pa&s;&s;over, Pentico&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Tabernacles,</HI> happen at their pro|per &s;ea&s;ons. The Targum of Chron. xii. 32. &s;ays of the children of I&s;&s;achar, that "they were &s;kilful in the knowledge of times, and wi&s;e to &s;ix the beginning of the years; dextrous at &s;etting the new moons and fixing their fea&s;ts at their &s;ea&s;ons." Hence it follows, that though the Jewi&s;h ordinary year is to be attended to when but a few years are under con&s;ideration, yet, in a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of time, they are not to be noticed, for by intercalations they amount to the &s;ame with &s;olar years.</P>

<P>But how can we reconcile tho&s;e three different numbers of Daniel with the &s;even (two in Daniel and live in the Apocalyp&s;e) which agree?</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, let it be allowed, that the convul&s;ions which are to bring about the predicted <HI>final</HI> overthrow of Antichri&s;t began with the revolution in France in 1789, and then reckon thus.</P>
<P>Daniel's <HI>time, times, and half a time,</HI> (1260 years) begin and end with the five numbers in the Apocalyp&s;e, and as they are 1260 years, and &s;uppo&s;ed to end at the French revolution, they mu&s;t begin A. D. 529, and end in 1789. Daniel's 2300 years begin 481 years before Chri&s;t, and end in 1819, when &s;ome other great event, or events, will take place. The <HI>bea&s;t</HI> and the <HI>fal&s;e prophet,</HI> (Rev. xix. 20.) <HI>i. e.</HI> the Papacy and the French tyranny, having previou&s;ly been brought to an end, then, perhaps, the <HI>dragon,</HI> civil de&s;poti&s;m, will be bound, (Rev. xx. 2.) and the Jews, the dry bones in the valley of vi&s;ion, (Ezek. xxxvii.) be rai&s;ed to political life, and re&s;tored to their own land. &mdash;Daniel's 1260 years begin with his <HI>time, times, and half a time,</HI> and with the former five numbers of John in the Apocalyp&s;e, <HI>i. e.</HI> at the commencement of the reign of the bea&s;t, A. D. 529, and end with the former number, (2300, in 1810, and which they mu&s;t, for they are to accompli&s;h the &s;ame event, as may be &s;een by comparing Dan. viii. 12. with chap. xii. 11. This agreement de&s;erves particular attention. His 1335 years (the end of which, according to him, will eminently he a ble&s;&s;ed time) begin in the &s;ame year of Chri&s;t 529, and terminate in 1864, when perhaps the Jews are to be converted by that remarkable

<P>But, perhaps it may be a&s;ked, What arguments are there which fa|vour the conjecture of the 529th year of Chri&s;t being that from which the power of the bea&s;t is to be dated? I own I have put this year down by accident, as the mea&s;urement back from 1789. To demon&s;trate, that in this year be came to &s;uch a &s;tate of maturity (for this my&s;tery of iniquity was forming in the apo&s;tle's days
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Tue&s;&s;. ii. 7,</NOTE>, and continued to grow for ages) as to con&s;titute him a bea&s;t, is not e&s;&s;ential to the making good our hypothe&s;is. But though no man, from the hi&s;tory of pa&s;t times, can de|termine the exact year from which God dates the kingdom of Antichri&s;t, yet there are good rea&s;ons from which a probable conjecture may be formed, that it was as early as the <HI>&s;ixth</HI> century.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle Paul, &s;peaking of that which hindered the progre&s;s of this <HI>wicked one,</HI> &s;ays, (2 The&s;&s;. ii. 6&mdash;11.) <HI>the my&s;tery of iniquity doth already work; only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way; and then &s;hall that wicked one be revealed,</HI> &amp;c. Our mo&s;t approved commentators &s;uppo&s;e, that by <HI>he who letteth,</HI> the impe|rial power is intended, and that we mu&s;t not expect to find this <HI>wicked one</HI> arrived at maturity till the fall of the we&s;tern empire. This took place A. D. 476. Soon after this, therefore, we may expect the ec|ele&s;ia&s;tical tyranny to be matured.</P>
<P>Some of our mo&s;t able critics, as Bi&s;hop Newton and Mr. Lowman, are of opinion, that by the wound which the fir&s;t bea&s;t received, chap. xiii. 3. we are to under&s;tand the blow which was given to the maje&s;ty and power of Rome, by &s;ubjecting it to the exarchate of Ravenna; and that by its being healed, is intended its re&s;toration to its former dignity, by this exarchate being given to the Pope, by which he became a tem|poral prince. Now, this wounding took place A. D. 568, and continu|ed 206 years. If this be well con&s;idered, it tends much to &s;trengthen our argument; for though, when the Pope was made a temporal prince, at the time of this healing, the world wondered more than ever after the bea&s;t, (Rev. xiii. 3.) yet the Papal bea&s;t exi&s;ted before, and this only gave him increa&s;ing eclat. But farther to confirm our hypothe&s;is, con|&s;ider
<PB N="50" REF="030090_0049_0FE4756A5220BF40">the &s;tate of &s;ociety, and particularly the &s;tate of what was called the church, in this &s;ixth century. Now, magi&s;trates were tyrants, and prie&s;ts were wicked, &s;uper&s;titious and intolerant, beyond any former age. Now, numberle&s;s laws and regulations were obtruded upon the church by human authority, which at once violated the authority of Chri&s;t, defaced Chri&s;tianity, and robbed Chri&s;tians of their deare&s;t liberties. And in this very year 529, which we are looking for, the <HI>Ju&s;tinian code</HI> was fir&s;t publi&s;hed, by which tho&s;e powers, privileges, and immunities were &s;ecured to the clergy; that union perfected be|tween things civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and tho&s;e laws impo&s;ed on the church which have proved &s;o injurious to Chri&s;tianity, and &s;o calamitous to mankind.

Let every one, then, break off his fins by righteou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;let the church return to its original <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">um|ble demeznour, its primitive purity, and its fir&s;t love&mdash;let every go|vernment reform its abu&s;es, and, by the practice of ju&s;tice and mercy, break every heavy yoke, and by the&s;e means make the wilderne&s;s and the &s;olitary place glad. Thus might they expect a ble&s;&s;ing. But if men be &s;till incorrigible in &s;in, if &s;y&s;tems of oppre&s;&s;ion, per&s;ecution, and war, be &s;till perti&s;ted in, if the nations league them&s;elves with Papal Antichri&s;t, for the purpo&s;e of &s;upporting him in his corruptions, robberies, u&s;urpations, and tyrannies, in vain will they tru&s;t in the wi&s;dom of their coun&s;ellors, the multitude of their riches, or in the power of their numerous fleets and armies. He that fitteth in the heavens will have them in deri&s;ion. When they take coun&s;el, he will bring it to nought; when they a&s;&s;ociate them&s;elves, he will break them to pieces:&mdash;the Judge &s;tandeth before the door. And without repentance and reformation, his judgments will &s;peedily come.</P>
<P>It is the duty of every member of the community to contribute what in him lies to the peace and happine&s;s of his country. Who are the be&s;t friends both of our king and con&s;titution; and who perform the be&s;t &s;ervices to their fellow-citizens?&mdash;they who exert all their pow|er to perpetuate imperfections and abu&s;es, and who flatter where they ought to condemn; or tho&s;e who plead for timely reform, that we may ward off the evils in&s;eparable from revolutions, and who li&s;t up their voice again&s;t the crying crimes of the nation, that men may re|pent, and thus the di&s;plea&s;ure of God be averted, and his ble&s;&s;ing con|tinued to future generations? Who promote mo&s;t the general interest and happine&s;s?&mdash;they who labour to blind mankind and pervert their judgments; or tho&s;e who invite them to di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate examination, that they may beware of precipitating them&s;elves into de&s;tructive mea&s;ures:&mdash;they who, either by riot and intemperance, or by mi&s;re, pre&s;entation and calumny, inflame the pa&s;&s;ions of men, that they may engage them to forward their own intere&s;ted views; or tho&s;e who ex|hort them to &s;erious thoughtfulne&s;s, and a peaceable pur&s;uit of tho&s;e mea&s;ures which may prolong the quiet and pro&s;perity of our country? He that &s;peaketh truth &s;heweth forth righteou&s;ne&s;s; but a fal&s;e witne&s;s deceit.</P>
<P>I may have failed in the execution; but my aim has been to &s;erve my King and Country, and to promote our common happine&s;s, by inve&s;tigating a mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;ubject. In doing it, I believe that I have performed, though a &s;mall, yet an acceptable &s;ervice to God.&mdash; May it be a u&s;eful one to my countrymen! With a heart agitated and overflowing with anxious concern, I pray that the war which threat|ens us, may be averted; and that the angry clouds which are gather|ing around may &s;weep by this long favoured country, and &s;pend their &s;tores of vengeance only on the heads of inveterate oppre&s;&s;ors.</P>

<HEAD>AVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE many excellent things which have been written by the friends of liberty, of our con&s;titution, and of humanity, again&s;t the pre&s;ent war, and on the nece&s;&s;ity of reformation, and a change of mea&s;ures, may make it &s;eem almo&s;t needle&s;s to &s;ay more than has been &s;aid; for intere&s;ted men would not believe though one &s;hould ri&s;e from the dead. But although little that is new can be expected to be advanced on a &s;ubject which is &s;oplain to the di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate and di&s;intere&s;ted, yet, as the argument in the following pages is placed, if not in a new point of light, yet, in &s;uch an one as has not been con&s;idered in any degree propertioned to its va&s;t importance, I am therefore induced to &s;ubmit it to the public attention.</P>
<P>It may be thought that the Author has not entered &s;o fully into the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of &s;ome particulars as he &s;hould have done, nor be&s;towed the pains upon them which their importance required. As to tho&s;e in the former part of the book, as they have been &s;o ably treated on by num|erous voluminous writers, and as he had but little to produce that was new, he did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to enter farther into the con&s;idera|tion of them than appeared needful for preparing the way for the vin|dication of what he advances re&s;pecting tho&s;e &s;ubjects which &s;ome may be di&s;po&s;ed to reject becau&s;e novel. And as to the execution of the whole, he mu&s;t beg leave to plead the con&s;tant toils of his profe&s;&s;ion, which leave him but now and then an hour for &s;uch inve&s;tigations.&mdash; Nothing but a conviction of duty could have induced the Author to pre&s;ent this to the Public; he has no &s;elfi&s;h or party views to &s;erve; and he hopes for all the indulgence which candour, with ju&s;ticce, can be&s;low, and no more.</P>
<P>The love of peace, anxious apprchen&s;ions for trembling liberty, con|cern for the fate which threatens our country, benevolence towards mankind, and a motive which a Chri&s;tian and a Prote&s;lant ought not to be a&s;hamed to avow, urge me again to addre&s;s my fellow-&s;ubjects at this dangerous and awfulcri&s;is.&mdash;May the evils which the Signs of the Times portend, and of which I have &s;uch &s;trong apprehen&s;ions, never fall upon my country!&mdash;May tho&s;e mea&s;ure, which alone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ave us be &s;peedily adopted!&mdash;But, &s;hould it be otherwi&s;e, may the hearts of the true friends of our con&s;titution and liberties never have to accu&s;e them that they &s;ore&s;aw the approating evil, but wanted virtue to exert their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lents, great or &s;mall, on the cau&s;e of peace and order, ju&s;tice and liberty!&mdash;May the ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">one &s;ervants of God, who wor&s;hip not the mommen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Bible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> com|po&s;ition

<P>Religion is a reality; uncorrupted Chri&s;tianity is the greate&s;t bene|fit that ever God be&s;toned upon mankind; but the deformities occa&s;ion|ed by the corruptions of prie&s;ts, and the perver&s;ions of &s;tate&s;men, have brought it into long di&s;grace, and prevented the intended good. The all-wi&s;e God, for rea&s;ons in&s;orutable to us, has permitted it to be &s;o. This is one of the many my&s;teries of his providence; but his word will be accompli&s;hed; the kingdom of Antichri&s;t will peri&s;h, and un|corrupted Chri&s;tianity will revive from the moment of its ruin. We are &s;ure of the event; but by what particular means this is to be ac|compli&s;hed, and when, is not &s;o clearly a&s;certained. The&s;e are left for events to elucidate. Our duty is to watch the Signs of the Times, and be ready whenever the &s;ea&s;on of reckoning may come. That its approach is to be knowable is put beyond a doubt, for otherwi&s;e the delincation of the &s;igns, and the command to inquire and watch, as well as the promi&s;e that the wi&s;e &s;hall under&s;tand, would all be nuga|tory.</P>
<P>There is a prevailing prejudice that de&s;erves &s;ome attention, and of which it may be as proper to take notice in this place as any where. It is very u&s;ual to hear people &s;ay of the prophecies, and particularly of tho&s;e in the book of Revelation, "They are &s;o ob&s;cure, and the opinions of the learned re&s;pecting them are &s;o various, that it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible to come at any certainty: and I therefore never trouble my&s;elf about them." It is true that there are a great diver&s;ity of opinions, and many &s;trange and wild interpretations and conjectures have been &s;tarted. But to what de&s;cription of prophecies does this chiefly apply? Not to tho&s;e which have long been accompli&s;hed, but to &s;uch as remain unfulfilled; for though there may not be an exact con|formity of &s;entiment as to every particular re&s;pecting the&s;e former, yet there is a pretty generalagreement among our writers in their in|terpretation of them. What wild and incoherent notions had the fathers, as they are called, the writers of the early centuries, about Antichri&s;t, the man of &s;in, and the bea&s;t with &s;even heads and ten horns, in Rev. xiii. And why? Becau&s;e the&s;e prophecies were not &s;ufficiently realized. But what Prote&s;tant commentators differ about the&s;e predictions now? Scarcely any. To &s;ay nothing concerning the propheties in the Old Te&s;tament, which re&s;erred to the humiliation of the Me&s;&s;iah, and which were never under&s;tood till after their fulfil|ment, ob&s;erve the progre&s;s of the elucidation of the book of Revelation. The prophetic parts, to the end of the ninth chapter, are tolerably well under&s;tood, and though there may not be an exact, yet there is a pretty general agreement in the interpretations of our mo&s;t approved writers, at there is al&s;o about tho&s;e other parts that have, for &s;ome time, been accompli&s;hed. For in&s;lance, &s;carcely any lady now doubts but that the fifth and &s;ixth trumpets refer to the deprodations of the Saracens and Turks; and almo&s;t all allow that the corruptions and per&s;ecu|fions of the Papal church, and its &s;upporters, are repre&s;ented by the treading under foot the holy city for forty and two months, and by the witne&s;&s;es prophe&s;ying in &s;achcloth 1200 days, or years, chap. xi. The rea&s;on of this general a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reement is, becau&s;e me &s;ee the fulfilment. But, in the interpretation of &s;ome other parts of this book, authors are very various, and for this covious rea&s;on, becau&s;e unaccompli&s;hed.
<PB N="57" REF="030090_0056_0FE4758B62214248">But this is not always to be the ca&s;e. When therefore they are ful|filled, and the corre&s;pondence of events with the predictions &s;ugge&s;ts the true interpretation, it would be the height of folly to reject &s;uch interpretations on account of their novelty, or becau&s;e former com|mentators entertained different opinions. I do not pretend to have any clear and &s;pecific ideas of what remains unfulfilled, but I appre|hend that the events &s;ignified in the tent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and in the eleventh chapters of Revelation, &s;o far as extends to the nations being angry, and the coming of the wrath of God, are now accompli&s;hed, or accompli&s;hing. I think this is as demon&s;trable as a thing of the kind can po&s;&s;ibly be &mdash;as demon&s;trable as that the &s;eventy weeks of Daniel referred to the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah, or, as that the fifty-third of I&s;aiah was a pre|diction of his &s;ufferings and exaltation.</P>
<P>Some, it is probable, way think that the Author has expre&s;&s;ed too much confidence re&s;pecting the &s;uppo&s;ed approaching calamities, and too much of what &s;ome will call enthu&s;ia&s;m, for the occa&s;ion; he can only &s;ay, that whatever diffidence he may entertain as to &s;ome &s;ingle and detached hypothe&s;es, both in this part and in the former, yet he has no doubt remaining as to the great facts, and expected events: and under the impre&s;&s;ion of this confidence, it would be criminal apa|thy to treat them as common occurrences, and to feel as though but lit|tle were at &s;take.&mdash;When Je&s;us beheld the capital of his guilty, devot|ed country, he wept over it.&mdash;Whether I write as a wild enchu&s;ia&s;t, or as one in his &s;ober &s;en&s;es, who has &s;ome rea&s;on for what he advances, a &s;hort time will determine; and, if the reader will &s;uppre&s;s his cen|&s;ures, and engage him&s;elf diligently to watch the Signs of the Times but for a few years only, I am willing to refer to &s;uture events for the proof that what is now bur&s;ting upon us tends to no common i&s;&s;ue.&mdash; Yes, it is more than probable, that many will think the Author a mi&s;|taken enthu&s;ia&s;t; but were this the univer&s;al opinion, (which is far from being the ca&s;e), he is not de&s;titute of &s;upport again&s;t immoderat&eacute; mortification.</P>
<P>If I am deceived by &s;eeming corre&s;pondencies, or led away by the illu&s;ions of fancy, to adopt &s;entiments which way have a tendency to create unnece&s;&s;ary unca&s;ine&s;s, I &s;hall e&s;teem my&s;elf under obligations to the man who will endeavour candidly to convince me of my delu|&s;ions: and if &s;uch an one can produce any well-grounded arguments to overturn what is advanced in the following pages, or in the former part of The Signs of the Times, I hope I am neither &s;o pertinacious, nor &s;o enthu&s;ia&s;tic, as to be incapable of conviction. But while no better arguments are advanced than, "Others have been deceived&mdash; opinions are various&mdash;when an author wi&s;hes to &s;upport an hypot he|fis of this kind, it is no difficult ta&s;k, in any age, to find events &s;uited to his purpo&s;e&mdash;the&s;e prophecies might be applied to any other country or events as well as to tho&s;e brought forward," &amp;c. I mu&s;t beg leave &s;till to maintain my confidence.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tians believe that the predictions of the prophets are &s;ometime to be fulfilled. Whenever that time comes, and a certain number of the predicted events have taken place, it is likely that things will be placed in &s;uch a point of light as to convey conviction, to the pious and attentive ob&s;erver, of the true intent of the Spirit of God; and it is to be expected, that this will be in proportion to the advancement of the great &s;cheme to its perfect completion. Whether &s;uch a number
<PB N="58" REF="030090_0057_0FE4758CFA028A48">of the&s;e events have taken place, and whether things are now placed in &s;uch a point of light, I hope the reader will candidly and &s;eriou&s;ly inquire. The Author thinks it is &s;o; and though he does not pretend to determine, from unfulfilled prophecies, either the exact time, or man|ner, of the accompli&s;hment of any particular event, yet he thinks that, from what has taken place, a pretty po&s;itive conclu&s;ion may be drawn re&s;pecting the main events, and that they are very near; namely, the downfal of the Papacy, and of all religious corruptions and u&s;urpa|tions; the overthrow of all tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion; the general re|formation and renovation of mankind, and of the overflowing cula|mities which are to effect, or prepare the way for all this.</P>
<P>Such is the temper of the times, that &s;ome filly or party &s;pirited peo|ple will, po&s;&s;ibly, be ready to &s;u&s;pect the Author of want of loyalty to the king, of veneration for the con&s;titution, and of love for his coun|try; for to &s;imilar &s;u&s;picion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was a wi&s;er and better man expo&s;ed, (Jeremiah xxxviii. <HI>4.</HI>) and all for a conduct which avouched the very contrary, and for which, in&s;tead of per&s;ecution and a dungeon, he de&s;erved the thanks of his country. Should it be thus, the Author will be content to con&s;ole him&s;elf with that con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s which he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es of the fal&s;ehood of &s;uch &s;urmi&s;es, of the rectitude of his inten|tions, and the hope of His approbation who is the Judge of all, and to whom, and not to the will of men, we ought to live.</P>
<P>The Author does not profe&s;s to &s;et him&s;elf up for the apologi&s;t of the French people; and far be it from him to attempt to ju&s;tify their ra&s;h and wicked deeds: he has not even &s;uppo&s;ed that every other peo|ple, in like &s;ituations, and with like provocations, would have acted the &s;ame part which they have; for that would be no alleviation of their guilt. The utmo&s;t that he has contended for, or &s;ugge&s;ted is, that the overthrow of monarchy and Ropery in that country is the accompli&s;hment of God's word, and in judgment for oppre&s;&s;ion and corruption; that their great leading principles are good, and that they have a right to legi&s;late for them&s;elves, and choo&s;e what &s;ort of government they plea&s;e, uncontrouled by any other power on earth.</P>
<P>Whether the French be right or wrong, in this or that, is no part of the que&s;tion which it has been thought nece&s;&s;ary to enter very deeply into;&mdash;yet the truth &s;eems to be, that there is a &s;trange mixture of the greate&s;t good and the greate&s;t evil: much to be applauded and much to be lamented. But the argument again&s;t the pre&s;ent war is drawn from a higher &s;ource than either the princi|ples or practices of the French reformers; and the Author thinks that, whether the French be right or wrong, whether they triumph or peri&s;h, yet mo&s;t of the nations who have made war upon them have involved them&s;elves in great blame by the ra&s;hne&s;s of their proceedings, and that they hazard great danger, by attempting to &s;upport that, which not only in&s;pired wi&s;dom, but general rea&s;on, has doomed to fall.&mdash;But more than this; though the war, on the part of the combined powers, were ever &s;o ju&s;t, though as ju&s;t as that of I&s;rael again&s;t the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">roud king of A&s;&s;yria, or of any of the ancient empires again&s;t their cruel and ambitious invaders, it would not at all affect the que&s;tion. As in their ca&s;es it was for the accumulated guilt of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages, and for the general depravity of their character, and not for the plame of that particular quarrel in which they fell, that God made the&s;e invaders his in&s;truments for their cha&s;ti&s;ement and over|throw,
<PB N="59" REF="030090_0058_0FE4758E92095EE0">and which de&s;tination In&s;piration had foretold&mdash;&s;o, for the accumulated guilt, and general depravity, of modern nations, cha&s;ti&s;e|ment is to be expected, and In&s;piration has put it beyond a doubt that it will one day come, when the bea&s;t with ten horns will be &s;lain, and his body de&s;troyed, and given to the burning flame, (Dan. vii. 11.). From comparing the &s;igns of the times with the declarations and in|dications of prophecy, there is great rea&s;on to apprehend that the time is at hand. Whatever, then, our provocations might be, the dan|ger is much the &s;ame, and there is no hope of e&s;cape or alleviation, but by in&s;tant Repentance and Reformation.&mdash;Never, therefore, was that exhortation more in time, Repent, for the kingdom of Heaven is as hand.</P>

<P>BEFORE we enter upon our inquiries, permit me to put a plain que&s;tion: not whether thou art intere&s;ted in the continuance and triumph of corruption in this country, or in the &s;upport of de&s;poti&s;m and Popery in France? que&s;tions proper enough in them&s;elves, for intere&s;t has a mighty influence in corrupti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the heart and perverting the judgment; but, art thou a Chri&s;tian? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he reader believe that the prophets in old time &s;poke and wrote under the in&s;piration of God, and that the things which they foretold will have their accompli&s;hment? If not, he may be a&s;&s;ured that the following pages will not be to his ta&s;te.&mdash;In a Chri&s;tian country, when que&s;tions of the la&s;t importance are in agita|tion, and the fate of nations is at &s;lake, there is a peculiar propriety in referring to tho&s;e &s;acred records which we all believe to be from God, to &s;ee whether they contain any information which may a&s;&s;i&s;t us in forming a right judgment, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s prevent our pur&s;uing a criminal and ruinous conduct. He cannot be a Chri&s;tian who de&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es this appeal, and e&s;pecially as it is allowed, almo&s;t by general con&s;ent, that we have here deleinated the circum&s;tances and fate of nations, to the end of time.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle Paul (Rom. xv. 4.) declares, re&s;pecting the writings of the prophets, that "What&s;oever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the &s;criptures, might have hope;" and in the beginning of that prou&s;ound and difficult, but important and in&s;tructive, book of Revelation, it is written, (chap. i. 3.) "Ble&s;&s;ed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep tho&s;e things which are written therein: the time is at hand." Is it not therefore a &s;trange piece of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ly, not to &s;ay profanene&s;s, in Chri&s;tians, to maintain, that the&s;e prophe|cies are of a kind which it is as vain as it is unprofitable to inquire in|to? This is to arraign the wi&s;dom of God, and de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e methods of in&s;truction which the In&s;pirer of prophecy has cho&s;en. Far be this from us! Let us better under&s;tand that &s;aying of the apo&s;tle to Timothy; "All &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s; that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furni&s;hed unto all good works." Many things in this book may be hard to be under&s;tood, and e&s;pecially before their fulfilment, or the taking place of &s;ome events &s;o immediately connected with them as to afford the inquirer a clue in his inve&s;tigations; but it does not thence follow, that we are not to &s;earch into the mind and meanig of the Spirit of God, but rather that we ought to redouble our diligence in inquiry, and abound the more in prayer to God, for the teachings of that Spirit who gave the word, and gave it in this form, not that it might never be under&s;tood, but that, whil&s;t the purpo&s;es and operations of God, in providence, &s;hould be hid from the carele&s;s eyes of a wicked world, they might, at the proper &s;ea&s;on, be

What the angel &s;aid to Daniel (chap. xii. 3. 10.) is in point as to the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, and a ground of encouragement to in|vigorate our re&s;earches. Shut up the words and &s;eal the book, even to the time of the end. Many (that is, about the time of the end) &s;hall run to and fro.

In the fifth chapter we have an account of a book &s;ealed with &s;even &s;eals, which Je&s;us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Lamb of God, was alone found worthy to open. This book is the repre&s;entation of the providence of God, which is committed to the execution of the exalied Redeemer of the world. The opening of the &s;eals indicates to us the different peri|ods of hi&s;tory, from the fir&s;t preaching of the go&s;pel to the com&s;umma|tion of all things. In the <HI>&s;ixth chapter</HI> we have an account of the opening of &s;ix of the &s;even &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">als. The&s;e bring us to the overthrow of the heathen Roman empire, by the emperor Con&s;tantine, who, about the year 311, embracing Chri&s;tianity, effected a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing revolution in the hi&s;tory of idolatry, and procured for the Chri&s;tian church a re|&s;pite from the per&s;ecutions which had long harra&s;&s;ed it, and which &s;eemed to threaten its utter extirpation. Now (A.D. 323.) were the four winds of heaven holden (chap. vii.), that they &s;hould not blow on the earth, nor on the &s;ea, nor on any tree, till 144,000 of the &s;ervants of God were &s;ealed in their foreheads, with the &s;eal of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing God. The former commotions and per&s;ecutions gave place to peace and quietne&s;s, till Chri&s;tianity &s;hould acquire &s;trength and permanency by the addition of numerous converts. But tares &s;prung up among the wheat. The &s;eeds of Antichri&s;tian error, pride, and domination, had long been &s;own, and now the &s;un&s;hine of court-favour produced a plen|tiful crop. Chri&s;tianity, or &s;omething called by that name, was brought to court; &s;he was carre&s;led, loaded with riches and honours; was de|hauched by her alliance with the world, and quickly became the mother of barlots. The true religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t was adulterated with the maxims of &s;tate&s;men, and the reveries of enthu&s;ia&s;ls. The per&s;ecuted became the per&s;ecutors, and univer&s;al corruption, reviling, and oppre&s;|&s;ion &s;ucceeded. Hence the judgments which follow:</P>
<P>Chap. viii. "And when he had opened the &s;eventh &s;eal, there was &s;ilence in heaven about the &s;pace of half an hour." Was this mence, as &s;ome interpet it, the &s;hort quiet which the church enjoyed on the late change of circum&s;tances; or, (for this quiet had been repre&s;ented be|fore chap. viii. 1.) was it not rather the amazement of heaven, on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing of the &s;eventh &s;eal, at the corruption which followed, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the judgments of God, which were about to &s;ucceed? There may al&s;o be
<PB N="62" REF="030090_0061_0FE475988A003610">an allu&s;ion, as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, to a ceremony among the Jews, who, while the &s;acrifices were offering, and while the prie&s;t went into the temple to burn incen&s;e, remained &s;ilent without, praying to them&s;elves. "And I &s;aw the &s;even angels which &s;tood before God; and to them were given &s;even trumpets." The&s;e &s;even trumpets are to be the &s;ig|nal for the u&s;hering in &s;o many di&s;tinct judgments on apo&s;tate Chri&s;|tians: "And I &s;aw another angel come and flood at the altar, having a golden cen&s;er; and there was given unto him much incen&s;e, that he &s;hould offer it with the prayers of the &s;aints upon the golden altar, which was before the throne. And the &s;moke of the incen&s;e, which came with the prayers of the &s;aints, a&s;cended up before God, out of the angel's hand." The corruption of the Chri&s;tian church which had ta|ken place, and the evils which quickly followed in its train, became a &s;ubject of &s;erious concern to tho&s;e who &s;till adhered to the truth; and the vindication of di&s;honoured Chri&s;tianity, as well as of oppre&s;&s;ed inno|cence, was the &s;ubject of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> prayers. God heard them. "And the angel took the cen&s;er and filled it with fire of the altar, and ca&s;t it into the earth; and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightenings, and an earthquake." All the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions are &s;ignificant of wars and commotions of nations, and are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tions of what is to be expected under the following trumpets, or po&s;&s;ibly they were intended to re|pre&s;ent tho&s;e commotions which &s;hould agitate the Roman empire, be|tween the dead of Con&s;tantine and the &s;ounding of the fir&s;t trumpet, which &s;hould bring the inva&s;ion of the Goths; that is, between the years 337 and 376. In this interval the family of Con&s;tantine, his three &s;ons, who divided the empire among them, and all his relations, peri&s;hed, chiefly by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination and inte&s;tine wars, within the &s;pace of twenty-&s;even years. And &s;o fierce and bloody was the war between Con&s;tantius, who reigned in A&s;ia and the ea&s;t, and Magnentius, who had procured the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of Con&s;tans, and had a&s;&s;umed the purple in Italy, that, as Victor ob&s;erves, it almo&s;t ruined the whole &s;trength of the Roman empire. But this was only the prelude to much greater calamities.</P>
<P>Ver. 7. "The fir&s;t angel &s;ounded, and there followed hail, and fire, mingled with blood, and they were ca&s;t upon the earth; and the third part of trees were burnt up, and all green gra&s;s was burnt up." This fir&s;t trumpet brings a terrible &s;torm from the north, the region of hail; and the nature of the &s;torm &s;hews the nature of the judgment, it was hail and fire mingled with blood, which denotes wars, and appears to have been a prediction of the terrible inundarions of the Goths, who, about the year 376, broke in upon, and laid wa&s;te a great part of Eu|rope, that third part of the then known world, to which the prophecy refers; for when the prophecy &s;peaks of the judgment falling on a third part, the we&s;tern empire, or Europe, is to be under&s;tood. Great were the calamities which were endured, for &s;everal years, from the&s;e inva|ders. A check was at length given to their depredations: for attempt|ing the conque&s;t of Normandy, A. D. 402, they were defeated, their immen&s;e trea&s;ures were taken; the captives were delivered, and, as the di&s;per&s;ed wandered about for &s;afety, innumerable numbers were &s;laugh|tered. But another enemy quickly appeared.</P>
<P>Ver. 8. "The &s;econd angel &s;ounded, and, as it were, a great moun|tain burning with fire was call into the &s;ea; and the third part of the &s;ea became blood." &amp;c. This appears to be a prediction of the irruption of the Vandal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, who, about the year 406, made a terrible inva&s;ion into
<PB N="63" REF="030090_0062_0FE4759A204D2A40">the we&s;tern and maritime parts of Europe, and here down all before them; &s;o that France, Spain, Portugal, and Italy, were made a prey of, and Rome it&s;elf was made to pay for its liberty. Here they &s;ettled them&s;elves for a while, till, toward the period of the third trumpet, they went into Africa, and there founded the kingdom of the Van|dals.</P>
<P>Ver. 10. "And the third angel &s;ounded, and there fell a great &s;tar from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of water; and the name of the &s;tar is called wormwood; and the third part of the waters became worm|wood, and many men died of the waters, becau&s;e they were made bit|ter." This blazing &s;tar, or comet, is Attila, who, with his Huns, A.D. 452, made a terrible inva&s;ion into the we&s;tern parts, laying wa&s;te the countries about the Danube and Rhine, the greate&s;t rivers in Europe, and e&s;pecially Lombardy, which is watered by the Po. His mi&s;&s;ion &s;eems to have been particularly again&s;t this latter country. Right well did he call him&s;elf, <HI>The &s;courge of God, and the terror of man.</HI> For fourteen years he &s;hook both the ea&s;t and we&s;t with the mo&s;t cruel fear, laying wa&s;te the provinces, by plundering, fire, and &s;word. After having wa&s;ted Thrace, Macedon, and Greece, he turned his arms again&s;t the we&s;tern empire: he entered Gaul with 700,000 men, &s;et mo&s;t of the cities on fire; but, going beyond the bounds of this trumpet, he met with a &s;ucce&s;sful re&s;i&s;tance, on which he turned his force again&s;t Lom|bardy, took and de&s;lroyed Aquilea, with &s;everal other cities, &s;laying the inhabitants, and laying the buildings in a&s;hes. From the Alps to the Appenine, all was &s;light, depopulation, &s;laughter, bondage, burn|ing, and de&s;peration. He was preparing to march to Rome, but was diverted from his purpo&s;e by a &s;olemn emba&s;&s;y from the emperor, and the promi&s;e of an annual tribute; and &s;o concluding a truce, he retired out of Italy, and pa&s;&s;ed into his own dominions beyond the Danube.</P>
<P>Whoever ca&s;ts an eye upon a map of this country, which he thus ravaged and depopulated, and which comprehended almo&s;t all the north of Italy, viz. Piedmont, Milan, mo&s;t of the territory of Venice, Man|tua, Parma, Modena, and &s;everal other provinces, he will in&s;tantly perceive the aptitude of the de&s;cription of this judgment: it was to fall upon <HI>the third part of the rivers and fountains of water,</HI> and the waters were to become wormwood, &amp;c. Be&s;ide its lakes, no country in Europe is &s;ointer&s;ected with rivers. There are not many &s;hort of a hundred, reckoning the numerous branches, with their &s;everal con&s;id|erable &s;treams, which fall into the Po. Perhaps, at &s;ome future time, not far di&s;tant, the comparing of what may take place in the overthrow of Antichri&s;t, with this judgment which fell on tho&s;e countries e&s;pecial|ly which are watered by the Rhine and the Po, may help us to under|&s;tand that other judgment, repre&s;ented in Rev. xvi. 4.7. by the pouring out of the third vial upon the rivers and fountains of water.</P>
<P>Ver. 12. "And the fourth angel founded, and the third part of the &s;un was &s;mitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the &s;tars; &s;o as that the third part of them was darkened, and the day &s;hone not for a third part of it, and the night likewi&s;e." This trumpet al&s;o relates to Europe, and perfects that for which the other trumpets prepared the way, the extinction of the we&s;tern empire. We may here recollect what Sir I. Newton, in his ob&s;ervations upon the prophecies, &s;ays, re&s;pecting this &s;ort of figurative language. "In &s;acred prophecy, which regards not &s;ingle per&s;ons, the &s;un is put for
<PB N="64" REF="030090_0063_0FE475A3503E7A50">the whole race of kings, in the kingdom or kingdoms of the world politic, &s;hining with regal power and glory; the moon, for the body of the common people, con&s;idered as the king's wife; the &s;tars, for &s;ubordinate princes and great men. Darkne&s;s is put for ob&s;curity of condition, and for error, blindne&s;s, and ignorance; darkening, &s;miting, or &s;etting of the &s;un, moon, or &s;tars, for the cea&s;ing of a kingdom, or for the de&s;olation thereof, proportional to the darkne&s;s; darkening of the &s;un, turning the moon into blood, and falling of the &s;tars, for the &s;ame."</P>
<P>There appear no events to which this extingui&s;hing of the third part of the &s;un, moon, and &s;tars, can be &s;o properly applied as to what took place towards the end of the fifth century, when the we&s;tern emperor, and his &s;ubordinate governors, were utterly extingui&s;hed, and en entire end was put to the very remainders of the Roman Cae&s;ars. This was effected by the fourth inundation of the barbarous nations, when the Heruli, under Odoacer, their leader, invaded Italy, about the year 475 A. C. and, having conquered Augu&s;tulus, gave the mortal blow to the we&s;tern empire, and reduced all Italy under the dominion of the barbarian, who a&s;&s;umed the title of King of Italy. About &s;ixteen years after this, Theodoric, king of the O&s;trogoths, at the reque&s;t of Zeno, emperor of the ea&s;t, made war upon the&s;e invaders in the new &s;et|tlement, conquered Odoacer in &s;everal battles, and obtained, as the fruits of his victories, a kingdom for the O&s;trogoths in Italy, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, under various turns of &s;ortune, from the year 493 to 552. The &s;eat of government was now removed from Rome to Ravenna. This ex|tinction of the imperial government, and humiliation of Rome, appears to be that to which the apo&s;tle Paul alludes, 2 The&s;&s;. ii. 6, 7. 8. Thus he, or <HI>that</HI> which hindered the man of &s;in from perfecting his &s;chemes of ambition, was taken away, and free &s;cope was given to the Popes to realize that &s;piritual monarchy, after which they had &s;o long panted, but could not &s;o ea&s;ily effect while the Cae&s;ars continued, and the civil government remained &s;o near them.</P>
<P>Thus have we &s;een the di&s;&s;olution of the Roman empire in Europe effected by the irruptions of the barbarous nations, not at once, but by degrees. From its ruins &s;prung up the ten kingdoms, which had been &s;hewn to Nebuchadnezzar as the ten toes of a great image, (Dan. ii. 42.) and to Daniel and John as &s;o many horns of mon&s;trous and lavage brea&s;ts. Dan. vii. 7. Rev. xii. 3. xiii. 1.</P>
<P>What was the effect which all the&s;e great and con&s;tant calamities that we have been reviewing, produced on the minds of the &s;ufferers? Did they put a &s;top to corruption, and reduce mankind to repentance? In&s;tead of this, immorality, &s;uper&s;tition, prie&s;tcraft, and cruel oppre&s;|&s;ions, civil and religions, &s;eemed to increa&s;e in proportion to the cor|rections of Providence, and even to out&s;trip the calamities which precipitated the down<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fal of the Roman empire. In&s;tead of turning to God by repentance; and &s;eeking to him for protection, they multiplied their gods; and the only exhortations of the clergy were, "The holy martyrs, our defenders, are pre&s;ent; they would be entreated, and they &s;eek that they may be &s;ought. Seek, therefore, unto the&s;e helpers of your prayers, find out the&s;e proteciors of your guiltine&s;s. Let St. Peter be now your helper in all things, tha afterward he may be able to forgive you your &s;ius. Chant to the cro&s;s, wherein is the wood of
<PB N="65" REF="030090_0064_0FE475A5A6CEF3A8">the Lord's cro&s;s, and the hair of John the Bapti&s;t: we fetch always the comfort of our Saviour through the interce&s;&s;ion of his fore-runner." Thus idolatry was grafted on the Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion; and the&s;e Anti|chri&s;tian apo&s;tates thought, by the&s;e devotions, and by making converts by &s;ire and &s;word to the holy Catholic church, to atone for their &s;ins, and bribe the Divinity to interpo&s;e in their favour. But while they are chanting to &s;aints and relies for peace, and &s;hedding the blood of the &s;aints as the price of &s;afety, behold an angel flying through the mid&s;t of heaven, (ver. 13.) &s;aying, with a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabitants of the earth, by rea&s;on of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels which are yet to found!" The three la&s;t trumpets are called <HI>woe trumpets,</HI> and this becau&s;e the plagues which were to come, either on account of their much greater &s;everity or longer duration, would be much more terrible than the four former.</P>
<P>Chap. ix. 1. "And the fifth angel &s;ounded, and I &s;aw a &s;tar fall from heaven unto the earth, and to him was given the the key of the bottomle&s;s pit." Our commentators are generally agreed, that the judgment intended by this trumpet is very obvious, and cannot be ea&s;ily mi&s;taken. This falling &s;tar, or comet, is the grand impo&s;tor Mahomet, who, in the un&s;earchable operations of Providence, was the in&s;trument of preparing a race of men, or mon&s;ters rather, for the &s;courging of apo&s;tate Chri&s;tians. Mahomet commenced his career about the year of Chri&s;t 608. Then he began to propagate his impo&s;ture, and take to him&s;elf the title of <HI>The Apo&s;tle of God.</HI> He did not pretend to deliver a new religion, but to revive that which had been given to Adam. In the year 622 he began to teach his di&s;ciples, that God had ordered him to propagate and enforce his religion by fire and &s;word. Accordingly, in 623, they began to put in practice this pretended mi&s;&s;ion. Ver. 2. "And he opened the bottomle&s;s pit, and there aro&s;e a &s;moke out of the pit, as the &s;moke of a great furnace; and the &s;un and the air were darkened by rea&s;on of the &s;moke of the pit." This &s;moke is his erro|neous doctrine. Ver. 3. "And there came out of the pit locu&s;ts upon the earth, and to them was given power as the &s;corpions of the earth have power." It does not comport with my limits, nor is it nece&s;&s;ary to my de&s;ign, to enter into the minutiae of this part of John's vi&s;ion; I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that by the&s;e locu&s;ts we are to under&s;tand the Saracens, the di&s;ciples of Mahomet, who, for &s;o many years, were the &s;courge of the Greek and Latin churches, A&s;ia and Europe. Here is no mention made of the <HI>third part,</HI> as in the other trumpets, but their commi&s;&s;ion was again&s;t all the men who had not the &s;eal of God in their foreheads, that is, who were not the &s;ervants of God, but had apo&s;tati&s;ed from the truth to &s;uper&s;tition, idolatry, and per&s;ecution, which was the ca&s;e with the pretended Chri&s;tians both of A&s;ia and Eu|rope, both of tho&s;e who acknowledged the &s;upreme authority of the Bi&s;hop of Rome, and of tho&s;e who did not. But the&s;e locu&s;ts were not to kill the&s;e men, but only to torment them. This does not &s;ig|nify, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, that they were not to inflict death on any, for this they did on innumerable multitudes; but it means that, though they were to be the authors of numberle&s;s, torments to both the Greek and Latin churches, yet they were not to de&s;troy them in their corpor|ate capacity. This was to be effected by the future woes.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="030090_0065_0FE475A73A0CBF90">
As to the time during which the&s;e Saracen locu&s;ts were to torment them who had not the &s;eal of God in their foreheads, it is &s;aid, in the <HI>fifth ver&s;e,</HI> to be <HI>five months,</HI> prophetic months undoubtedly, or 150 years. Again, it is &s;aid, ver. 10. that "they had tails like &s;corpions, and there were &s;tings in their tails; and their power was to hurt men five months;" the &s;ame period of time with that mentioned before, 150 years. There is &s;ome difficulty in reconciling this time, which the prophecy allots, with the hi&s;tory of facts. Some &s;uppo&s;e, that an allu&s;ion only is here made to tho&s;e hot &s;ummer months in which locu&s;ts are wont to prevail and do mi&s;chief, without intending to markout any certain time. Some, again, &s;uppo&s;e, that as a prophet|ic month contains 30 years, the period of 150 years was intended, and that this refers only to that period in which the Saracens made their chief conque&s;ts, and occa&s;ioned the greate&s;t calamities. Others ima|gine, that both the&s;e five months are to be reckoned; and then the pe|riod of their tormenting men is fixed to 300 years. But others have thought, that here has been, through the mi&s;take of copyi&s;ts, &s;ome altera|tion of the original text. See <HI>Whi&s;ton's E&s;&s;ay on the Revelations,</HI> p. 196. By this hypothe&s;is, John is &s;uppo&s;ed to have written I E or <HI>decapente</HI> and not E or <HI>pente</HI> that is <HI>fiteen</HI> months in&s;tead of <HI>five,</HI> this being a period which &s;eems to agree much better with the hi&s;tory of the Saracens" for from the beginning of the Saracen empire, or of the im|po&s;ture of Mahomet, in 608, to the fir&s;t grand downfal of it, by the ri&s;e of the Turki&s;h empire, at the inauguration of <HI>Tangrolipix,</HI> (after the taking of the capital city of Bagdad), A.D. 1057 or 1058, are a|bout 450 years. As it is not e&s;&s;ential to my de&s;ign, I &s;hall not labour to &s;olve the difficulties which here pre&s;ent them&s;elves, it being enough for our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, if this fifth trumpet be allowed to refer to the depredations of this cruel people. I &s;hall therefore only beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t to the curious, and to tho&s;e who may have more ability and lei&s;ure for the inve&s;tigation, whether the fir&s;t <HI>five months</HI> may not refer to the &s;evere&s;t period of their conque&s;ts and cruelties in A&s;ia, where they had their beginning, and the latter <HI>five months</HI> to the time of their chief and mo&s;t tormenting depredations in Europe. Tho&s;e who wi&s;h to &s;ee a more laboured explanation of the&s;e trumpets, may con&s;ult Brightman, Mede, Lowman, Newton, Whi&s;ton, and others. The lat|ter of whom, except Mede, has the mo&s;t originality; and though he may have &s;ome peculiarities, and &s;tart &s;ome hypothe&s;es which may be thought to be un&s;upported by good argument, yet, altogether, he &s;eems to have had the mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent ideas, and I acknowledge my obligations to him.</P>
<P>Ver. 12. "One woe is pa&s;t, and behold there come two woes here|after. And the &s;ixth angel &s;ounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar, which is before God, &s;aying to the &s;ixth angel which had the trumpet, Loo&s;e the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates. And the four angels were loo&s;ed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month and a year, for to &s;lay the third part of men." It is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible not to believe that this woe re&s;ers to the Turks, who overthrew and entirely extingui&s;hed all that part of the Roman empire which they a&s;&s;aulted, by the taking and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">king of Con&s;tantinople, A.D. 1453, and by the entire conque&s;t and pa&s;&s;ion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;tern empire to this day.

And by the&s;e were the third part of men killed." (ver. 17, 18.) This is, as Mr. Whi&s;ton ob&s;erves, a mo&s;t proper, or allegorical de&s;cription of the way and appearance of ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">les, &s;ince the woeful u&s;e of guns and gun-powder, which were invented un|der this trumpet.

By means of his artillery, Amurath the Second broke into the Peloponne&s;us, and took &s;everal &s;trong places; and in particular at their mo&s;t fatal action, the taking of Con&s;tantinople, in 1453, &s;uch enormous guns were employed as had never been &s;een before. One is de&s;cribed to have been of &s;uch a mon&s;trous &s;ize, that it was drawn by &s;eventy yoke of oxen, and two thou&s;and men.

They under&s;tand them to be four &s;ultanies or kingdoms, which the Turks had at or near the river Euphrates, for &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ions togeth|er, who&s;e capital cities were <HI>Bagdad</HI> beyond that river, and <HI>Iconium, Aleppo,</HI> and <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> on this &s;ide of it. For a great while they were re&s;trained to the&s;e parts, and could not extend their dominion as they wi&s;hed. Several circum&s;tances operated to effect this re&s;traint, particu|larly the expeditions of the cru&s;aders, in the 12th and 13th centuries, and the power of the khans of Per&s;ia, who, till the beginning of the fourteenth century exerci&s;ed &s;ome contro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l over them. But it is evi|dent, that the &s;everal re&s;traints of Providence which had bound them, began to be taken off towards the end of the thirteenth, and the begin|ning of the fourteenth centuries. All our writers on the ancient Turki&s;h hi&s;tory, complain of the barrenne&s;s of their materials, and the inaccuracy of dates; but let us trace this matter as well as we can. Fir&s;t ob&s;erve the ri&s;e of the Ottoman family it&s;elf. The fir&s;t per&s;on we read of, of this remarkable race, which has been &s;uch a &s;courge to Chri&s;tendom, is Solyman Shah, who attempted, about A.D. 1214, &s;ay &s;ome, later, according to others, to retire out of Per&s;ia, to &s;eek for him|&s;elf and followers a &s;ettlement under the Seljukidae, who then reigned in A&s;ia Minor. In attempting to pa&s;s the Euphrates he was drowned. This &s;o di&s;couraged his &s;ons, that two of them returned back into Per&s;ia; but Ortogrul, the third, with his three &s;on, Candoz, Sarubani, and O|thman, or Ottoman, &s;till remained in the neighbourhood of the Eu|phrates for &s;ome time, till Aladin, the &s;ultan of I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oniuin, received him, and gave him, and the four hundred families which emigrated with him, a country to inhabit. Ortogrul died about the year 1289, and his &s;on Ottoman continued the &s;ubject and &s;oldier of Aladin. By his valour and &s;ucce&s;s he rai&s;ed him&s;elf to great eminence, and the race of the Seljukidae terminating in Aladin, he fixed upon Ottoman to be his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or. Oppre&s;&s;ed with age and infirmities, he is &s;aid, in his lifetime, to have devolved on Ottoman the cares and prerogatives of royalty.
<PB N="68" REF="030090_0067_0FE475B40E6E1398">Mr. Gibbon fixes this in A.D. 1299; but it is generally determined to have been in 1300. From comparing what is &s;aia of the length of his reign and the beginning of the reign of his &s;on Urchan, and other circum|&s;tances, there is rea&s;on to conclude that he began his reign in the year of the Hegira (the Turki&s;h epoch) 699 or 700, probably the latter. Now, as the Hegira began July 15. 622, A. D. and the Arabian years being lunar, and the Turks reckoning them by thirties, nineteen of which con&s;i&s;t of 354 days, and eleven of 355, their year 700 would commence on September 16, 1300. Thus the fourth month of the Turki&s;h year would be, according to the Chri&s;tian era, 1301. Hi&s;|torians &s;eldom take any notice of this difference in the commencement of the Turki&s;h years, and tho&s;e of ours; but if an event is &s;aid to have taken place in the 700th year of the Hegira, this year commenceing in 1300 of our era, it is therefore &s;et down as in that year. It is probable that Ottoman was inaugurated in the year of the Hegira 700; but hi&s;to|ry does not &s;ay on what day or month of that year; it might be towards the latter end of it. M. Whi&s;ton endeavours very ingeniou&s;ly to prove from certain circum&s;tances, that he began his reign May 19. 1301. It would certainly afford &s;ome &s;atisfaction, if we could prove to a day or a month from whence to date the beginning of the Ottoman empire. But I que&s;tion whether this would be enough to prove the exact time of the loo&s;ing the&s;e four angels, or me&s;&s;engers of de&s;truction. In Ottoman, it is evident that all the&s;e &s;ultanies were united; but perhaps their loo&s;ing is to be reckoned from &s;ome great and &s;ucce&s;sful expedition under|taken &s;ome time after he had mounted the throne. I think it is clear that it was &s;oon after the commencement of his reign; and if we are not able to prove the exact day or year, it does not invalidate the con|clu&s;ion which we mean to draw.</P>
<P>According to Chalcocondylas, quoted by Mr. Whi&s;ton, &s;oon after Ottoman was &s;eated on the Turki&s;h throne, the Turks made an irrup|tion into Europe, even as far as the Danube, and a &s;econd &s;oon after. This &s;econd is a&s;cribed to 1302. But let us hear Mr. Gibbon, (<HI>Hi&s;t, of the Ri&s;e and Fall of the Rom. Emp.</HI> vol. xi. p. 443.). who cannot be &s;u&s;pected of wi&s;hing to &s;erve the cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity. He laments, with all other writers on the&s;e &s;ubjects, the ob&s;curity of the Turki&s;h annals. He dates the fir&s;t breach which Ottoman made upon the Greek empire, July 27. 1299, bvt &s;ays it was after the Seljukian dyna&s;ty was no more. As authors are pretty well agreed as to the uncertainty of the Turki&s;h dates, and as it is pretty clear that Aladin did not die till 1302, perhaps this date is not quite correct. However this may be, he &s;ays' "The Seljukian dyna&s;ty was no more; and the di&s;tance and de|cline of the Mogul khaus &s;oon enfranchi&s;ed him (Ottoman) from the controul of a &s;uperior. He was &s;ituate on the verge of the Greek em|pire; the Koran &s;anctified his <HI>gazi,</HI> or holy war. again&s;t the infidels; and their political errors unlocked the pa&s;&s;es of mount Olympus, and invited him to de&s;cend into the plains of Bithynia. Till the reign of Paleologus, the&s;e pa&s;&s;es had been vigilantly guarded by the militia of the country, who were repaid by their own &s;afety, and by an exemp|tion from taxes. The emperor aboli&s;hed their privilege, and a&s;&s;umed their office; but though the tribute was rigorou&s;ly collected, the cu&s;to|dy of the pa&s;&s;es was neglected, and the hardy mountaineers degenerated into a trembling crowd of pea&s;ants, without &s;pirit or di&s;cipline. It was on the 27th of July, in 1299 of the Chri&s;tian era, that Othman fir&s;t in|vaded the territory of Nicomedia; and the &s;ingular accuracy of the date &s;eems to di&s;clo&s;e &s;ome fore&s;ight of the rapid and de&s;tructive growth
<PB N="69" REF="030090_0068_0FE475B662E77878">of the mon&s;ter." In p. 431. he informs us, that till now "all the emir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, who had occupied the cities or the mountains, confe&s;&s;ed the &s;upre|macy of the khan of Per&s;ia, who oftentimes interpo&s;ed his authority, and &s;ometimes his arms, to check their depredations, and to pre&s;erve the peace and balance of his Turki&s;h frontier. The death of Cazan remo|ved this &s;alutary controul; and the decline of the Moguls gave a free &s;cope to the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the Ottoman empire," This event he dates May 31, 1304. This looks very much like the loo&s;ing of which the prophecy &s;peaks. Between this and the year 1312 he dates the conque&s;t of the maritime country from the Propontis to the Mean|der, and the i&s;le of Rhodes, &s;o long threatened, and &s;o often pillaged; and that now (p. 437.) "the captivity or ruin of the &s;even churches of A&s;ia was con&s;ummated, and the barbarous lords of Ionia and Lydia &s;till trample on the monuments of cla&s;&s;ic and Chri&s;tian antiquity." And but a few years after this, &s;o humbled were the proud Chri&s;tians of Con&s;tantinople, the trembling capital of the emperors in the ea&s;t, that crowds of naked Chri&s;tians, of both &s;exes, and of every age, of prie&s;ts and menks, of matrons and virgins, were expo&s;ed to &s;ale in their public markets; and all they could do was to deplore the fate of their brethren, who were led away to the wor&s;t evils of temporal and &s;piritual bondage. In 1357 or 1358 they entered the European &s;eas with a very numer|ous fleet of &s;hips, and never cea&s;ed their conque&s;ts, nor received any effectual check, till the latter end of the la&s;t century. In 1453 they took and &s;acked Con&s;tantinople, entirely conqueredr the ea&s;tera empire, and made that imperial city the capital of their va&s;t dominions.</P>
<P>But for how long a period was their triumph to continue? Ver. 15. "And the four angels were loo&s;ed which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to &s;lay the third part of men." According to Mr. Brightman, Dr. Lloyd, Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, Dr. Cre&s;&s;ner, Mr. Whi&s;ton, and others, 890 yeaas, and &s;ome odd days, are here &s;ignified.

<P>It admits of a doubt whether the Jewi&s;h year of 360 days &s;hould be counted, or the Julian year as above; but as it does not affect the hy|pothe&s;is I mean to e&s;tabli&s;h, I &s;hall not detain the reader to examine it. Mr. Whi&s;ton argues, that it is probable that Ottoman began his reign May 19. 1301, and reckoning from thence to September 1. O. S. 1697, when prince Eugene overthrew the Turks at Zenta, we have exactly the time required. And it de&s;erves to be remarked, that ever &s;ince that overthrow they have never been able to make any effectual head again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, &s;o called, but in&s;tead of being a plague to the Chri&s;tian nations, in the prophetic &s;en&s;e of the term, the&s;e nations have been a plague to them, and their power has been con&s;tantly le&s;&s;en|ing: for though they have made war &s;everal times, it has been almo&s;t

<P>What &s;ome able writers have &s;aid on this &s;ubject de&s;erves attention, as it &s;erves very much to &s;trengthen the argument, which goes to prove, that the hour, and day, and month, and year, for which this woe was prepared, terminated about the end of the la&s;t century. The fir&s;t whom I &s;hall mention, is Mr. Brightman, who wrote in the beginning of the la&s;t century. He &s;ays (in his <HI>Expo&s;ition of the book of Revelation,</HI> p. 324. edition of 1644.) "A year. here put &s;imply, is under&s;tood to be a vulgar and u&s;ual Julian year, that con&s;i&s;ts of 365 days and &s;ome hours, all which time being numbered from the year 1300, &s;hall expire at la&s;t about the year 1696, which is the la&s;t term of the Turki&s;h name, as other &s;criptures do al&s;o prove with marvellous con&s;ent." Dr. Cro&s;ner and Dr. Lloyd, bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, foretold very nearly the peace of Carlowitz from this pa&s;&s;age. See what Bi&s;hop Burnet, in his <HI>Hi&s;tory of his Own Times,</HI> &s;ays of the latter, (vol. iv, p. 297, of 12mo. edit.) "Dr. Lloyd, the pre&s;ent learned bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, who has now for above twenty years been &s;tudying the Revelation with amazing diligence and exactne&s;s, had long before this year &s;aid, the peace between the Turks and the Papal Chri&s;tians was certainly to be made in the year 1698, which he made out thus: The four angels, mentioned in the fourteenth chapter of Revelation, that were bound in the river Euphra|tes, which he expounds to be the captains of the Turki&s;h forces, that till then were &s;ubject to the &s;ultan of Babylon, were to be loo&s;ed or freed from that yoke, and to &s;et up for them&s;elves; and the&s;e were pre|pared to &s;lay the third part of men, for an hour, a day, a month, and a year. He reckons the year in St John is the Julian year of 365 days; that is, in the prophetic &s;tyle, each day a year; a month is thirty of the&s;e days, and a day makes one, which added to the former number makes 396. Now he proves from hi&s;tory, that Ottoman came and began his conque&s;ts at <HI>Prou&s;&s;e,</HI> in the year 1302, to which the for|mer number, in which they were to &s;lay the third part of men, being-added, it mu&s;t end in the year 1698; and though the hi&s;torians do not mark the hours, or twelfth part of the day or year, which is a month, that is, the beginning of the de&s;truction the Turks were to make, yet he is confident if that is ever known, that the prophecy will be found, even in that, to be punctually accompli&s;hed. After this he thinks their time of hurting the Papal Chri&s;tians is at an end. They may indeed
<PB N="71" REF="030090_0070_0FE475B995B42318">&s;till do mi&s;chief to the Mu&s;covites, or per&s;ecute their own Chri&s;tian &s;ubjects, but they can do no hurt to the Papilins."</P>
<P>Dr. J. Mather, who wrote in 1710, &s;ays, in his <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e concern|ing Faith and Fervency in Prayer,</HI> p. 97. "We are a&s;&s;ured that when the <HI>&s;ixth trumpet,</HI> called al&s;o the <HI>&s;econd woe,</HI> has done its work, the &s;eventh trumpet, called the third woe, will come quickly, Rev. xi. 14. Now there is rea&s;on to hope that the <HI>&s;econd woe, is pa&s;t,</HI> h. e. that the Turk &s;hall be no more &s;uch a plague to the apo&s;tate Chri&s;tian world, as for ages pa&s;t he has been. At the time when the &s;econd woe pa&s;&s;eth away there is to be a <HI>great earthquake:</HI> In that earthquake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> one of the ten kingdoms, over which Antichri&s;t has reigned, will fall.

May we hear of a mighty Revolution there, we &s;hall then know that king|dom of Chri&s;t is at hand."</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider the facts which give us rea&s;on to think that the four angels, or mini&s;ters of de&s;truction, which were bound in the river Euphrates, were loo&s;ed, when the four &s;ultanies above enumerated were united under Ottoman, and freed, not only from the re&s;traints laid on them by the cru&s;aders, but from the controul of the khans of Per&s;ia; when I recollect that all this took place about the latter end of the thirteenth century and the beginning of the fourteenth, and that be|tween the years 1299 and 1304, the Seljukian race being extinct, and the controul of the k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ans of Per&s;ia being no more, Ottoman founded the pre&s;ent Turki&s;h empire, broke in upon the territories of the ea&s;tern Cae|&s;ars, and laid wa&s;te the apo&s;tate Chri&s;tian churches; when, moreover, I con&s;ider that &s;ince the peace of Charlowitz in 1669, though there have &s;ince been wars between the Turks and the Papal powers, yet, that the latter have generally been the aggre&s;&s;ors, and that the Turks have almo&s;t ways come off lo&s;ers, &s;o that their power is &s;o much broken that their empire totters to its very ba&s;e, I conclude that the hour, and day, and month, and year, in which they were to prevail, terminated about the end of the la&s;t century, probably on Sept. 1. O. S. 1697, when they experienced that &s;atal overthrow at Zenta in Hungary, from the the armyunder Prince Eugene.</P>

<P>BUT does the violence of the &s;econd woe terminate as we have en|deavoured to prove; and is it becau&s;e the men, again&s;t whom it was directed, are brought to repentance? No. Ver. 20. "And the re&s;t of men (the members of the Papal church) which were not killed by the&s;e plagues, yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they &s;hould not wor&s;hip devils, and idols of gold, and &s;ilver, and bra&s;s, and &s;tone, and of wood, which neither can &s;ee, nor hear, nor with, neither repent|ed

They have not repented.</P>
<P>Mu&s;t we then give up all hope of better days? Will nothing bring the church to a purer &s;tate, and the nations to repentance for their cor|ruptions and murders? Alas! the man of &s;in will never repent; Anti|chri&s;tian prie&s;ts and tyrants will never cea&s;e their corruptions and op|pre&s;&s;ions, robberies and murders, till they, and their abominable &s;y&s;tems, are utterly de&s;troyed by the avenging judgements of God.&mdash;But we are not to de&s;pair.&mdash;Here, in the <HI>tenth chapter,</HI> an angel de&s;cends from heaven to brighten the gloomy &s;cene, and to cheer our drooping hopes, by announcing that the <HI>&s;eventh trumpet</HI> &s;hall &s;oon be &s;ounded, and the my&s;tery of God be fini&s;hed, as he hath declared to his &s;ervants the prophets.</P>
<P>The gleam of con&s;olation which breaks upon us in this chapter is very &s;ea&s;onable and reviving; the great and la&s;ting troubles predicted in the former chapters, and which occupy a &s;pace of 1400 years, are enough to try the faith and patience of the be&s;t. To hear of nothing but of hail and fire, of burning mountains and &s;eas of blood, of darkening of the &s;un, moon and &s;tars, of horrid mon&s;ters which vomit fire, and de&s;troy innumerable myriads of men: to hear of nohing but woe after w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, without intermi&s;&s;ion or pro&s;pect of end, terrifies the bolde&s;t &s;pirits, and oppre&s;&s;es the &s;tronge&s;t faith. The woes of the two la&s;t trumpets had now afflicted the nations for near a thou&s;and years; and the enormities of Antichri&s;t had prevailed for a longer period. To revive the &s;pirits, and to animate the hopes of God's &s;ervants, an angel appears at the end of the &s;ixth trumpet, or the &s;econd woe, to a&s;&s;ure them that the time of corruption, per&s;ecution, and calamity, &s;hall not continue much longer, but that the &s;eventh and la&s;t trumpet &s;hall &s;oon be &s;ounded, and that woe come upon Antichri&s;tian oppre&s;&s;ors which &s;hall fini&s;h the my&s;tery of God, and introduce among men his glorious kingdom of righteou&s;|ne&s;s, peace, and happine&s;s. Seeing then that there are the mo&s;t cogent rea&s;ons for concluding, that the woe of the &s;ixth trumpet terminated a|bout the year 1697, near a hundred years ago, and that many good and eminent men have been daily expecting, &s;ince that time, the judgments of the &s;eventh trumpet, which are to bring the triumphs of Popery, idolatry, oppre&s;&s;ion, and wickedne&s;s, to an end, and introduce the king|dom of Chri&s;t, it becomes us to attend to the <HI>Signs of the times,</HI> and &s;ee whether the fig-tree is not &s;hooting forth and annoucing the approach of &s;ummer.

<P>Chap. x. 1. "And I &s;aw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the &s;un, and his feet as pillars of fire; and he had in his hand a little book open." This little open book appears to be a codicil to that book of which we read in chap. v. coutaining &s;ome addi|tional explanatory matter.

"And he &s;et his right foot upon the &s;ea, and his left foot on the earth, and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth, and when he had cried, &s;even thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write; and I heard a voice from heaven &s;aying unto me, Seal up tho&s;e things which the &s;even thunders uttered, and write them not. And the angel which I faw &s;tand upon the &s;ea, and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to heaven, and &s;ware by Him that liveth for ever and ever&mdash;that there &s;hould be time no longer;" Dr. Doddridge has well expre&s;&s;ed it, "the times of the judgments, to be &s;ignified by the pouring out of the &s;even vials, &s;hould not be much longer delayed." And thus al&s;o do Brightman and others explain it, as meaning that delay &s;hould be no lon|ger, but that the &s;eventh trumpet &s;hould now &s;peedily &s;ound, and the judgments of God bring Babylon the Great to a rapid end. And then (ver. 7.) the my&s;tery of God &s;hall be fini&s;hed, as he hath declared to his &s;ervants the prophets. Then the providence of God, in permitting the kingdom of his Son to be &s;o long and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully oppo&s;ed; in per|mitting his church to be &s;o grievou&s;ly harra&s;&s;ed by its enemies, and in &s;uffering oppo&s;ers &s;o long to triumph, which has been e&s;teemed among the chiefe&s;t my&s;teries of the Divine conduct, &s;hall be illu&s;trated, and all nations &s;hall &s;ee, in the deci&s;ive woe upon Babylon, tho&s;e di&s;plays of wi&s;dom and righteou&s;ne&s;s which &s;hall vindicate the Divine govern|ment from all the a&s;per&s;ions of infidelity.</P>
<P>Of this great event almo&s;t all the prophets have &s;poken, and all agree that the calamities will be the mo&s;t tremendous that the nations have ever experienced; but the i&s;&s;ue, as it concerns the liberty and happine&s;s of mankind in general, as well as the felicity of the church of Chri&s;t in particular, the mo&s;t glorious. A glory this very different from that which worldly wi&s;dom and carnal pride, for &s;o many centu|ries, have been aiming at. All the governments of the world will be framed on principles of impartial and general ju&s;tice. Pure and unde|filed religion will revive. "Glory to God in the highe&s;t, and on the earth peace, good-will toward men," will again be &s;ung; and both the &s;cattered Jews and the fulne&s;s of the Gentiles will be brought in to &s;well the chorus, and to grace the triumphs of the Son of God. Long have the eyes of believers been looking to the promi&s;es. and ob&s;erving the <HI>&s;igns of the times,</HI> expecting the arrival of the&s;e promi&s;ed days. But hitherto the time has been <HI>delayed.</HI></P>
<P>Here, after the &s;ixth trumpet, or the &s;econd woe, is pa&s;t, and the re&s;t of the men, who were not killed, repented not, and after the &s;even thunder had uttered their voices, the angel &s;wears by Him who liveth for ever and ever, that <HI>delay</HI> &s;hall be no longer, but the &s;eventh angel &s;hall &s;ound.</P>
<P>In the next chapter, which contains explanatory vi&s;ions, we are in|formed that the &s;eventh angel does not &s;ound his trumpet, to bring the deci&s;ive woe, till after the witne&s;&s;es are ri&s;en from the dead, in &s;ome one of the Antichri&s;tian kingdoms, nor till that kingdom, or tenth part of the Antichri&s;tian city, is &s;o &s;haken by an earthquake that it falls. Here it is nece&s;&s;ary to recollect what has been advanced in the fir&s;t part of <HI>The Signs of the Times.</HI> It is there endeavoured to be proved,
<PB N="74" REF="030090_0073_0FE475C577201B38">that by the <HI>&s;econd bea&s;t,</HI> which came up out of the earth, (Rev. xiii. 11 &mdash;19.) the French tyranny, as perfected by Lewis XIV, and &s;upport|ed by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, was intended; that it was he who, by the repeal of the edict of Nants, and the overthrow of all the remains of civil liberty in France, &s;lew the witne&s;&s;es for <HI>religious truth</HI> and <HI>civil liberty;</HI> that it was he who cau&s;ed an image, to be made to the fir&s;t bea&s;t (the Papacy) by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a &s;piritual tyranny &s;imilar to that at Rome, and which, contrary to the &s;late of things in any other country where the Pope's &s;upremacy in &s;pirituals has been acknowledged, was at once in|dependent of the Pope's authority, and yet in &s;upport of his preten&s;ions and corruptions. I have al&s;o endeavoured to prove, that it was here the witne&s;&s;es lay politically dead for three lunar days and a half, or 105 years; that the revolution in France in 1789 was the re&s;urrec|tion of the witne&s;&s;es to civil life, and the commotions which have fol|lowed, the prophetic earthquake here predicted; and that the fall of the tenth part of the city is accompli&s;hed in the overthrow of the mon|archy or tyranny of France. Immediately after this the &s;eventh angel &s;ounds, and u&s;hers in the <HI>third woe,</HI> which is to be the means of ha&s;ten|ing the kingdom of God. The nations are angry, (compare chap. xi. 18. with xix. 19.) and gather them&s;elves together to oppo&s;e the de&s;igns of God: his wrath falls upon them, and they are de&s;troyed. This <HI>eleventh</HI> chapter we mu&s;t remember, is a miniature picture of the hi&s;tory of the Chri&s;tian church, from its fir&s;t beginnings to the end of time, and belongs to the little book which treats of the affairs of the church e&s;pe|cially. When the vi&s;ions of the book with &s;even &s;eals are re&s;umed, (which book refers to the more mixed and general concerns of the king|doms), as in the <HI>fifteenth</HI> and following chapters, the&s;e events of the &s;eventh trumpet, or third woe, are exhibited on a larger &s;cale, and re|lated with a more circum&s;tantial detail.</P>
<P>Now let us compare tenth chapter with the eleventh. In the tenth chapter we are informed that it was not till after the &s;even thunders had uttered their voices that the angel lifted up his hand to heaven, and &s;ware by him that liveth for ever, that <HI>delay</HI> &s;hould be no longer, but that the my&s;tery of God &s;hould be fini&s;hed by the &s;ounding of the &s;eventh angel. The&s;e &s;even thunders, I think, evidently occupy the &s;pace between the ending of the &s;ixth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">mpet and the commence|ment of the &s;eventh. But, what are the&s;e thunders? John was forbid|den to write what they uttered; and hence mo&s;t commentators have pa&s;t over this part of the prophecy without even conjecturing what might be intended, &s;uppo&s;ing that it would be pre&s;umptuous to do &s;o. But this has not been the ca&s;e with all. Some have conjectured that though what they uttered was not to be written at that time, yet they are explained in the after vi&s;ions. Brightman &s;uppo&s;ed them to be explain|ed in the fourteenth chapter: Whi&s;ton imagines that they belong to the la&s;t vial, chap. xvi. But all this &s;eems very unnatural. There are others who &s;uppo&s;e, that though it was not proper to write down what they uttered at that time, yet that, after their accompli&s;hment, they will be under&s;tood, and &s;uppo&s;e them to be &s;even warnings which are to precede either the &s;eventh trumpet or the la&s;t vial. It appears to me that as John was forbidden to write down what the&s;e thunders uttered in vi&s;ion, it would be as pre&s;umptuous as it would be u&s;ele&s;s, to inquire what it was till the vi&s;ion is realized, and the intent of the&s;e thunders is a&s;certained. For as it is likely that it was forbidden to be written, le&s;t the prophecy &s;hould be made too plain before the time that God
<PB N="75" REF="030090_0074_0FE475C70F1F1800">would have it under&s;tood, &s;o to attempt an explanation till events have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> archetypes of the thunders quite clear, would be running be|fore God. But it does not hence follow that this is always to be the ca&s;e; for when the things &s;ignified are accompli&s;hed, they may info<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, in language as plain as events can &s;peak, of what we were not to know before. But, to &s;ay nothing of what the&s;e munders might utter, we may ob&s;erve, that as we are not forbidden to inquire what the gen|eral meaning of the&s;e thunders them&s;elves might be, and as it is proba|ble that they were intended to be &s;ome time under&s;tood, to the end that they might &s;erve as a guide to direct the inquirer into the &s;igns of the times, and as otherwi&s;e the mention of them would be u&s;ele&s;s, it is therefore very proper to examine, with mode&s;ty, whether this part of &s;acred writ may not a&s;&s;i&s;t us in forming a judgment of the times in which we live, that thus we may be excited to redoubled watchfulne&s;s, and be ready.</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t inquiry &s;hould be, what is the meaning of thunder in the my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and figurative language of prophecy? As in the natural world the things of creation are compri&s;ed in the heavens and the earth, and the heavens are con&s;idered as the nobler parts of the creation, &s;o in the world politic, in prophetic language, the heavens mean thrones and go|vernments: the &s;un, moon, and &s;tars, emperors, kings, princes, and great men, as well as empires, kingdoms, and &s;lates; the earth &s;igni|fies the great ma&s;s of the common people; clouds mean multitudes; wind, ha&s;t, &s;torm, and thunder, as well as earthquakes, &s;ignify wars and commotions among multitudes and nations. Thus in I&s;a. xxviii. 2. when God, by his prophet, threatens to puni&s;h by war, the language is, "The Lord hath'a mighty and &s;trong one, which, as a tempell of hail, and a de&s;troying &s;torm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, &s;hall ca&s;t down to the earth." And again, chap. xxix. 6. "Thou &s;halt be vi&s;ited of the Lord of ho&s;ts with thunder, and with earthquake, and a great noi&s;e, with &s;torm and tempe&s;t, and a flame of devouring fire." The next ver&s;e explains what this thunder and &s;torm is: "And the multitude of all the nations that fight again&s;t Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">el &s;hall be as a dream." Sir I. Newton, <HI>On the Language of Prophecy,</HI> p. 13. &s;ays, "Tem|pe&s;tuous winds, or the motion of clouds, are put for wars; thunder, or the voice of a cloud, for the voice of a multitude; a &s;torm of thunder, lightning, &amp; hail, and overflowing rain, for a tempe&s;t of war de&s;cending from the heavens and clouds politic." Dr. Warburton, in his Divine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e|gation, book iv. &s;ect. 4. &s;ays, "The old A&s;iatic &s;tyle, &s;o highly figura|tive, &s;eems, by what we find of its remains in the prophetic language of the &s;acred writings, to have been evidently fa&s;hioned to the mode of ancient hierogliphies both <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uriologic</HI> and <HI>tropical.</HI>&mdash;Of the &s;econd kind, which an&s;wers to the trop <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al hieroglyphic, is the calling empires, kings, and nobles, by the names of the heavenly luminaries, the &s;un, moon, and &s;tars; their temporary di&s;a&s;ters, or en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re overthrow, by eclip&s;es and extinctions; the de&s;truction of the nobility, by &s;tars falling from the firmament; ho&s;tile inva&s;ions, by thunder and tempe&s;tuous winds; and leaders of armies, conquerors, and founders of empires, by lions, bears, leopards, goats, or high trees. In a word, the prophetic &s;tyle &s;eems to be a &s;peaking hieroglyphic."</P>
<P>If we examine all the pa&s;&s;ages in the &s;acred writings where thunder is mentioned in the prophetic &s;tyle, we &s;hall find that it generally, if not always, &s;ignifies war. It is probable than that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="76" REF="030090_0075_0FE475CFD390C618">and &s;eventh trumpet, which &s;hould afflict this we&s;tern part of the world, or tho&s;e nations which had given their power to the Papal bea&s;t, or which in any form had a&s;&s;umed Antichri&s;tian power in religion, and which wars &s;hould prepare the way for the great &s;cene which was to fol|low.</P>
<P>But here it will be proper to a&s;k, (for frequent ob&s;ervation has con|vinced me that &s;uch que&s;tions are not altogether needle&s;s,) Does the reader believe that a prophecy can be fulfilled by the events which take place in his own day, and which pa&s;s under his own ob&s;ervation, as well as by tho&s;e of five hundred years back, or five hundred years to come? Does he think the wars and great events of nations which have or may take place in this age, and in the&s;e countries of Europe, as worthy to be the &s;ubject of prophecy as what was foretold by Daniel, (chap. xi.), re&s;pecting the inva&s;ion of Greece by Xerxes; or of the conque&s;ts of Alexander, and the fate of his empire; or of Egypt, and which was formed between Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt, and Antiochus Theus, king of Syria, by the marriage of Berenice, the daughter of the former, with the latter, and the con&s;equences that followed that connection? I hope he does.</P>
<P>As the &s;even thunders appear evidently to occupy the &s;pace be|tween the &s;ixth and &s;eventh trumpet, and as thunder in the prophetic writings is allowed to be the &s;peaking hieroglyphic of war, and as it is likewi&s;e probable that the &s;ixth trumpet, or &s;econd woe, ended about the year 1697, it is worth while to inquire, whether the&s;e thunders have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed their voices; that is, whether there have been &s;even periods of war in Europe &s;ince that time. On examination, the hi&s;tory of this century will inform us that, taking all the nations together which do or have made up the body of the Papal bea&s;t; and among whom the re|mains of religious corruption, u&s;urpation, &amp;c. continue, (and which almo&s;t all allow to be the object of the&s;e vi&s;ions), there have been ju&s;t &s;even of the&s;e thunders, or periods of war, neither more nor le&s;s. And it is worthy of remark, that this is the ca&s;e whether we take into the ac|count tho&s;e &s;tates and kingdoms only which &s;prung out of the ruins of the old Roman empire, or all tho&s;e that compo&s;e the Latin church, or even the whole of Europe. We &s;hall con&s;ider tho&s;e wars in which all Europe have been engaged, &s;o far only as the nations which are or have been &s;ubject to the Papacy, have been concerned in them.</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t period of war commenced in 1700, and continued with|out intermi&s;&s;ion till 1721 inclu&s;ive; for when other powers terminated their de&s;tructions, and hu&s;hed the roar of war in &s;ome parts of Europe, by the peace of Utrecht, in 1713, and by that of Ra&s;tadt, in 1714, then, as though alarmed le&s;t mankind &s;hould be too happy, the madman Charles the Twelfth of Sweden rou&s;ed him&s;elf from his bed of affected &s;ickne&s;s at Dometica, and pro&s;ecuted his war again&s;t Ru&s;&s;ia, Den|mark, Pru&s;&s;ia, Poland, Hanover, and Saxony, with renewed vigour. In the&s;e wars the following powers were engaged: Sweden, Ru&s;&s;ia, Denmark, Poland, England, Holland, the Emperor, Spain, France, the Venetians, the Turks, &amp;c. This was the fir&s;t thunder,</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;econd, though very violent while it la&s;ted was of &s;horter du|ration than the former, continuing only through the three campaigns of 1733, 1734, and 1735. In this war there were engaged the Emperor, France, Spain, Sardinia, &amp;c.* The interval of peace was &s;hort; for.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="77" REF="030090_0076_0FE475D2208DC550">
3. In 1737 the third thunder began to roll; nor did it cea&s;e to lay the faire&s;t parts of Europe in ruins all 1748. In the wars which filled up this period of de&s;truction the following powers were engaged: the Emperor, Ru&s;&s;ians, and Turks, led the way; England and Spain quickly followed; France, Pru&s;&s;ia and Holland, al&s;o united to increa&s;e the calamity.</P>
<P N="4">4. In 1755 commenced another period of war, which &s;oon &s;et all Europe in a flame. Great-Britain, France, Pru&s;&s;ia, Saxony, Au&s;tria, Sweden, Spain and Portugal, experienced its effects. This period of waria&s;ted till 1763, and was the fourth thunder.</P>
<P N="5">5. The fifth, though extremely violent where it raged, did not ex|tend it&s;elf &s;o wide. The parties engaged were the Ru&s;&s;ians, Poles, and Turks. The French and Cor&s;icans al&s;o increa&s;ed the roar. Poland was never &s;o de&s;olated. This commenced in 1768, and continued five years.</P>
<P N="6">6. Peace, as u&s;ual, was but of &s;hort continuance. The di&s;pute of Great Britain with her American colonies, which broke out into an o|pen rupture in 1775, was the occa&s;ion of a &s;ixth general tempe&s;t break|ing upon the chief maritime powers of Europe, and which continued from 1778 to 1782, five years. The powers engaged were Great Britain, France; Spain and Holland.</P>
<P N="7">7. The &s;eventh and la&s;t period of war was from 1788 to 1791, in|clu&s;ive. The parties engaged were the Ru&s;&s;ians and Au&s;trians again&s;t the Turks; the Swedes again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians and Danes; the Belgians al&s;o, who revolted again&s;t the Emperor, increa&s;ed the tempe&s;t. Den|mark &s;oon became neuter; and as far as the Emperor and Swedes were concerned, peace was re&s;tored in 1790, but the Ru&s;&s;ians and Turks continued their &s;laughter till 1791. This was the &s;eventh thunder.</P>
<P>This la&s;t period of war &s;eems, under providence, to have been among the principal cau&s;es of the &s;ucce&s;s of the revolutioni&s;ts in France; for tho&s;e who may be thought to have been the mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the French court were otherwi&s;e employed. This circum&s;tance has not been unnoticed by the writers of the day. It has been ob&s;erved, that it happened unfortunately with re&s;pect to the ari&s;tocratical party in France, that Europe had &s;eldom been, through a long cour&s;e of years, in a &s;tate le&s;s capable of affording the &s;uccours which were now demanded by the princes, nobles, and clergy of that country, or in which the minds of the people, or the di&s;po&s;itions of the &s;overeigns, were le&s;s calculated for undertaking any enterpri&s;e, than at pre&s;ent. The mad ambition of the Emperor Jo&s;eph, under the influence of the overwhelming power and vall de&s;igns of Ru&s;&s;ia, to which he became &s;o mi&s;erable a dupe, be|&s;ides the ruin and &s;pirit of revolt which it &s;pread through his own do|minions, had, in no &s;mall degree, deranged the general policy of Eu|rope. And it is worthy to be ob&s;erved, that ju&s;t when this prince was on the eve of making peace with the Turks, and which being accom|pli&s;hed, he might then have been able to turn his attention to the &s;itua|tion of his brother-in-law the king of France, he died, (Feb. 20. 1790.) His &s;ucce&s;&s;or, Leopold, immediately &s;et him&s;elf to accompli&s;h what death prevented Jo&s;eph from executing; but no &s;ooner was peace con|cluded with the Ottoman court, and his revolting &s;ubjects in Brabant brought to obedience, than he died al&s;o, (March 1, 1791). All the&s;e happily extingui&s;hed ju&s;t as it was breaking out, and the expence of
<PB N="78" REF="030090_0077_0FE475D3B3B30028">events counteracted every inclination which the court of Vienna might have to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of the French revolution, and gave time for its gaining &s;uch a firm e&s;tabli&s;hment, that before Francis, the pre&s;ent emperor, could be prepared for the meditated attack, the people of France were become too much enlightened into the enormities of the old &s;y&s;tem, too much informed of their rights and &s;trength, and too untted, to be ea&s;ily frightened into a retreat.</P>
<P>The courts of London and Madrid were occupied in a &s;quabble a|bout an object &s;carcely bearing or de&s;erving a name. The king of Sardinia, from the &s;tate of his finances, of his army, of his fortre&s;&s;es, was not in a condition to hazard any attempt in favour of the old de&s;|poti&s;m, till too late. We may add the immen&s;e debts, contracted in the wars of the pre&s;ent century, (originating, from the impolitic and ruin|ous practice of funding, which mu&s;t in the end, and perhaps very &s;oon, terminate in events the mo&s;t calamitous to tho&s;e who have had re&s;ort to &s;uch unwi&s;e mea&s;ures): the&s;e debts, I &s;ay, and the con&s;equent derange|ment of the finances of all the powers in Europe, proved highly favour|able to the cau&s;e of the French reformers; and however great the fears of &s;ome might he, re&s;pecting the influence of this example, or however much inclined to li&s;ten to the &s;upplications of humbled de&s;poti&s;m, or to &s;upport the cau&s;e of the mortified nobility and clergy, who&s;e cries for vengeance filled every court and every country, yet they were &s;o &s;hackled by circum&s;tances as not to be able to yield them immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Thus have the wars of this century been preparing the way for the accompli&s;hment of God's de&s;igns in the overthrow of the tenth part of the Antichri&s;tian city, and the de&s;truction of the power of tho&s;e privi|leged orders of men, who had been its chief &s;upporters, which appears to be the &s;laying of the &s;even thou&s;and names of men, predicted Rev. xi. 13. and which events were to be the prelude to the &s;eventh trum|pet, which is to bring tho&s;e judgments that are to perfect the overthrow of Papal corruption and tyranny.</P>
<P>Seeing that God, by his &s;ervants the prophets, has conde&s;cended in various known and allowed ca&s;es, (as may be &s;een by comparing the writings of the prophets with hi&s;tory) to reveal his purpo&s;es concerning the fate of nations, and that for the confirmation of his word, and the edification of mankind, it certainly becomes us to examine whether there be any takens or &s;igns by which we may know the pre&s;ent times, le&s;t the judgments of God come upon us when we are not aware, and find us, in&s;tead of waiting for him, as his faithful &s;ervants, in arms again&s;t his providence, and in league for the &s;upport of his enemies, and the enemies of his children.</P>
<P>There never were greater or more important events, &s;ince the world began, than tho&s;e to which we are witne&s;&s;es; events apparently big with the mo&s;t awful con&s;equences. Though what we have advanced re&s;pecting the termination of the power of the Turks in or about the year 1697, and the accompli&s;hment of the &s;even thunders, by the &s;even periods of war which have been &s;ince that time, may not, by it&s;elf, prove that the time is arrived for the founding of the &s;eventh trumpet, and for the commencement of that woe which is to bring Antichri&s;tian idolatry, corruption, and oppre&s;&s;ion to an end, yet, in conjuction with other prophecies and events, it is po&s;&s;ible that it may form a &s;trong probability&mdash;a probability as near to a demon&s;tration as can be expect|contained
<PB N="79" REF="030090_0078_0FE475D54CE360A0">in chapter the eleventh, we are informed, that after the two witne&s;&s;es, or two de&s;criptions of witne&s;&s;es, had lain politically dead in one of the &s;treets of the Antichri&s;tian city, the my&s;tical Babylon, for three prophetic days and a half, the &s;pirit of life from God entered into them, and they &s;tood upon their feet, and great fear fell upon them who &s;aw them. This is a Jewi&s;h manner of de&s;cribing the great poli|tical changes of nations from bondage to liberty, as may be &s;een by comparing this place with I&s;a. xxv. 6&mdash;12. xxvi. 12, 19, 21. Ezek. xxxvii. 1&mdash;14. What the prophets, in the pa&s;&s;ages referred to, have de&s;cribed as the re&s;urrection of the Jews from the dead, is allowed, on all hands, to be their ri&s;ing to civil and political exi&s;tence, when they &s;hall be re&s;tored from their di&s;per&s;ions and bondage to their own land and to liberty; and the &s;pirit which is promi&s;ed, Ezek. xxxvii. 14. to be put in them that they may live, is not that which is promi&s;ed Jer. xxxi. 33. and Ezek. xi. 19. but the &s;pirit of political and civil life, pre|paratory to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat greater ble&s;&s;ing of the renovating Spirit of God. Upon the ri&s;ing of the&s;e witne&s;&s;es from their &s;tate of death, they heard a great voice from heaven, (ver. 12.) that is, from the Supreme Power, &s;ay|ing unto them, "Come up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">her," a&s;&s;ume the privileges and rights of freemen. "And the &s;ame hour there was a great earthquake;" ver. 18.) or in plain language, without prophetic figure, a great national convul&s;ion, from the &s;truggles which the &s;upporters of corruption and tyranny made again&s;t the vindicators of the civil and religious rights of mankind. "And the tenth part of the city fell." This for ages pa&s;t has been &s;uppo&s;ed to refer to France, the tenth part of the Antichri&s;|tian city, and events &s;eem to verify the conjecture. This doubtle&s;s appears to point out one of the ten Papal &s;tates or monarchies which had been the great &s;upporter of the per&s;ecution and oppre&s;&s;ions of the whore of Babylon, and which was to fall &s;ome little time before the founding of the &s;eventh trumpet for the great and de&s;olating woe; and no one of them has been, all through, &s;o con&s;picuous in her cau&s;e as France.</P>
<P>"And in the earthquake"&mdash;not at the moment of the falling of the tenth part of the city, but in the earthquake which terminated in that event, "were &s;lain of men &s;even thou&s;and;" or, of the names of men, as it &s;hould be read. This has al&s;o, for near two centuries back, been &s;uppo&s;ed to be a prediction of the abolition of titles in France, and of the peri&s;hing of tho&s;e privileged orders of men who have been the prin|cipal &s;upporters of de&s;poti&s;m, and the chief actors in the per&s;ecutions which have raged again&s;t God's &s;ervants, as may be &s;een more at large|in the Fir&s;t Part of <HI>The Signs of the Times.</HI></P>
<P>Immediately after the fall of this tenth part of the city, the third woe commences, Ver. 14. "The &s;econd woe is pa&s;t, and behold the third woe cometh quickly. And the &s;eventh angel founded, and there were great voices in heaven, &s;aying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chri&s;t; and he &s;hall reign for ever and ever." That is, tho&s;e judgments now commence, which are &s;peedi|ly to effect this happy change; but Babylon the Great is to fall fir&s;t, and this is to be accompli&s;hed by terrible things in righteou&s;ne&s;s. The|nations are to be angry, (ver. 18.) and oppo&s;e the de&s;igns of God; the con&s;equence of which will be, he will gather them together, (chap. xvi. 16. xix. 17&mdash;21.) and pour upon them his wrath, and thus de&s;troy tho&s;e (whether &s;ecular or eccle&s;ia&s;tical) who de&s;troy the earth.</P>
<P>Let us now return to the &s;even thunders, and &s;ee whether our inter|pretation of them agree with what is here predicted re&s;pecting the tenth
<PB N="80" REF="030090_0079_0FE475DE6B7BC660">part of the Antichri&s;tian city, and the events which have taken place. The la&s;t thunder, or period of war, as we have &s;een, began in 1788. ju&s;t before the earthquake in France commenced, and continued till 1791, or, if we exclude Ru&s;&s;ia and Turkey, 1790. It entered far into the period of the earthquake, and was a means, under Providence, of forwarding the con&s;equences of that convul&s;ion. In this part of the earthquake the names of men were Ilain, that is, the titles and di&s;tinctions not only of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, but of the &s;ecular nobility, were aboli&s;hed. The titles of the&s;e latter were aboli&s;hed June 9. 1790. Their cries for vengeance excited the &s;ympathy and pity of the &s;urrounding courts, but they were at pre&s;ent in no condition to help them.</P>
<P>The thunder cea&s;ed.&mdash;Aug. 25, 1791, &s;everal potentates and princes entered into a treaty at Pilaitz, and agreed to prepare for the inva&s;ion of France, and to unite their forces to re&s;tore the ancient de&s;|poti&s;m, and with it the invaded rights of the nobility and prie&s;thood. &mdash;The affairs of France advance fa&s;t towards a cri&s;is.&mdash;The angel &s;wears by Him who liveth for ever and ever, that delay &s;hall be no longer. &mdash;Aug. 10, 1792, the monarchy falls.&mdash;The &s;eventh angel founds.&mdash; The nations are angry, and God's wrath is come.</P>
<P>Thus there hitherto appears to have been the mo&s;t exact conformity between the repre&s;entations to John, and the events which we have been con&s;idering, e&s;pecially as to the ri&s;ing and &s;inking of the Turki&s;h power, and the periods of war which have afflicted the Latin church, to the&s;e we&s;tern parts of the world, &s;ince the term nation of the violence or the &s;econd woe, and preparatory to the third; as well as to the revolu|tion in France, and the commotions of nations which have followed the fall of the Papacy and monarchy in that country. A corre&s;pondence this which is calculated to excite the mo&s;t &s;erious alarm on account of our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and of what we have to expect. But it is happy to reflect that this is not all; it is calculated al&s;o to cheer the hopes of all tho&s;e who are waiting for the fulfilment of the promi&s;es of God, for the morning cometh as well as the night, and <HI>at evening time it &s;hall be light,</HI> (Zech. xiv. 7.) But would we e&s;cape the evil, and partici|pate only in the good? The likelie&s;t means to in&s;ure this, is, without delay, to withdraw from this unhappy and <HI>inau&s;picoius</HI> war, and apply our&s;elves to a univer&s;al reformation.</P>
<P>THERE are al&s;o other &s;igns of the times which very pointedly in|dicate what we have to expect, but which we &s;hall only briefly touch upon. From comparing what Ezekiel &s;ays, (chap. xxvi. xxvii. and xxviii.) concerning the fall of Tyrus, and the con&s;equent calami|ties, from the failure of commerce, with what is &s;aid re&s;pecting the fall of Babylon the Great, Rev. xviii. &s;erious conclu&s;ions might be deduc|ed. As there might al&s;o, not only from that general indifference which prevails as to every thing which concerns religion, but from compar|ing Rev. xvi. 2, 13. with exi&s;ting events. The union of Prote&s;tants and Papi&s;ts, (though it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed that they do not in general mean this,) for the &s;upport of that which heretofore they thought it their fir&s;t duty to oppo&s;e, and for the overthrow of which they pray i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> all their churches, is a &s;ingular phaenomenon.&mdash;Yes, charity obliges us
<PB N="81" REF="030090_0080_0FE475E0071C1950">to hope that the majority of Prote&s;tants would revolt at the idea of leaguing them&s;elves with Papal tyrants, for the direct purpo&s;e of &s;up|porting Popery. I believe that this is not the idea of the people in this country, and I hope that none of our treaties will ever bind us to fight through thick and thin for the perpetual &s;afety of all the &s;tates of Italy. For as the day (if God's word be true) will certainly come, and, it is likely, very &s;oon, when God's wrath will be poured out upon that &s;eat of &s;piritual tyranny, this would involve us in an awful &s;itua|tion indeed, to the mo&s;t di&s;tant hazard of which no wi&s;e Prote&s;tants would expo&s;e their king and country. They who would do this, let them abu&s;e the French infidels as much as they will, are deeper in in|fidelity than they. No; the people of this country, in general, think nothing about Popery, or of the policy of &s;upporting it. This is not e&s;teemed even a &s;econdary end of the war by them. But it is too evident, that the violent advocates for religious hierarchies, tithes, &amp;c. among Prote&s;tants, although they might approve of &s;ome reformation in the Gallican church, and would not have found them&s;elves inclined to oppo&s;e any alteration which might have brought it to a nearer confor|mity to their own &s;everal &s;y&s;tems, yet when the French reformers aboli&s;hed tithes, and re&s;tored to the people their ancient and natural right of choo&s;ing their own pa&s;tors, and e&s;pecially when they aboli&s;hed all religious e&s;tabli&s;hments in that exten&s;ive country, and placed the different &s;ects upon an equal footing, and made all the mini&s;ters of reli|gion dependent upon their &s;everal flocks for &s;upport, who might re|ward them in proportion to their own ability, or according to the opin|ion entertained of their de&s;erts; this reduction of things to the original &s;tate in which Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles left them, was beyond bearance, and they had rather that all the ab&s;urdities and oppre&s;&s;ions of the old Papal e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;hould be re&s;tored, than &s;uch a dangerous example be &s;et up in the heart of Europe. This appears evidently to be the &s;entiment of tho&s;e who wail and howl &s;o dreadfully about the contempt into which their "dear brethren in Chri&s;t" (the Popi&s;h clergy, who can no longer &s;hew their mitred fronts in Parliaments) have fallen, and for the overthrow of the holy altars of the idolatrous whore of Babylon. But let us pa&s;s on.</P>
<P>When I read or hear the ravings of Mr. B&mdash;ke, and of &s;uch like orators, who are li&s;tened to with admiration and wonder, while they &s;o feelingly de&s;cribe the merits of the Papal prie&s;thood, the &s;anctity of all religious e&s;tabli&s;hments, and the enormous impiety of touching this ark of God;&mdash;when I hear right reverend prelates of a Prote&s;tant church, drawing the mo&s;t invidious compari&s;ons between the prie&s;ts of the bloody whore of Babylon and the di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ters of this country, (than whom, with the whole body of Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters, there are none who are more &s;incere in their loyalty to the king, in their attachment to the con&s;titution, or more uniform in their obedience to the laws&mdash;but ene|mies to corruption, and friends to civil and religious liberty);&mdash;when I hear them, before the mo&s;t augu&s;t a&s;&s;emblies, breathing out nothing but brotherly love to the former, and nothing but wrath and bitterne&s;s a|gain&s;t the latter, and all becau&s;e the&s;e differ from them in opinion a|bout tithes and religious e&s;tabli&s;hments;&mdash;while I hear them exerting all their eloquence, not only to implore our protection and pity for the exiled prie&s;ts of France as fellow-creatures, (for that would be prai&s;e|worthy, for, <HI>if thine enemy hunger, feed him</HI>) but as our <HI>brethren, members of Chri&s;t, and heirs of the promi&s;es;</HI> "more near and dear
<PB N="82" REF="030090_0081_0FE475E19A947D38">to us by far than &s;ome who, affecting to be called our Prote&s;tant breth|ren, have no other title to be called Prote&s;tant than a Jew or a Pagan, who, not being a Chri&s;tian, is for that rea&s;on only, not a Papi&s;t;"&mdash;while I hear them &s;oftening our renunciation of the Autichri&s;tian church of Rome, into an e&s;trangement, and her idolatry and bla&s;phemous dogmas into "what we deem their errors and corruptions;"&mdash;whil&s;t I hear them wail over the fallen altars and violated riches of Papal idola|try and &s;uper&s;tition, without one &s;entence which may lead us to adore God, in the contemplation of tho&s;e righteous and awful judgment, by which he fulfils his word, and avenges the cau&s;e of the innocent;&mdash;I perceive in this unity of &s;entiment between &s;uch exalted Prote&s;tants and the church of Rome a <HI>&s;ign of the times</HI> which indicates no good to the friends of civil and religious liberty.&mdash;But I will leave &s;uch men to the mercy of God, and the public to their own reflections.&mdash;Rejoic|ing that the law protects the innocent, I hope that &s;uch men will never be permitted to realize their zeal in any thing beyond invective and wailing; and then, let them inveigh, let them wall.&mdash;Je&s;us I know, and Paul I know; but, who are the&s;e?&mdash;Not the genuine friends eith|er of Prote&s;tanti&s;m, their country, the king, or the con&s;titution, which they make their theme.</P>
<P>The next <HI>&s;igns of the times</HI> which I &s;hall notice re&s;pects the Ottoman empire. In Dan. xi. 40&mdash;45. we have a prophecy of the calamities which the people of the fourth monarchy, or rather of the Papal church, &s;hould &s;uffer from the king of the South, or the <HI>Saraceas;</HI> and from the king of the North, the <HI>Tarks,</HI> who came originally from the north quarter. After enumerating the conque&s;ts of this la&s;t enemy, the pro|phet &s;ays, ver. 44. "But tidings out of the ea&s;t, and out of the north, &s;hall trouble him; therefore &s;hall be go forth with great fury to de&s;troy, and utterly to make away many;" ver. 45. "yet he &s;hall come to his end, and none &s;hall help him." "And at that time" (xii. 1.) "&s;hall Michael &s;tand up, the great Prince, which &s;tandeth for the children of thy people." (the Jews,) "and there &s;hall be a time of trouble, &s;uch as there never was &s;ince there was a nation, even to that &s;ame time; and at that time, thy people" (the Jews) "&s;hall be delivered, every one that &s;hall be written in the book." Then follows a de&s;cription of their political ri&s;ing, after the manner of the ea&s;tern &s;lyle.</P>
<P>Enemies from the ea&s;t, from towards Per&s;ia or Arabia, and from the north, are to be the means of bringing the Turki&s;h mon&s;ter to an end, and this is to be preparatory to the return of the Jews to their own country, which the Turks now po&s;&s;e&s;s, and at which time &s;uch troubles will afflict the nations as have never been known.&mdash;One enemy is to come from the ea&s;t, and another from the north; and it is de&s;erving the attention of tho&s;e who would ob&s;erve the progre&s;s of things towards the accompli&s;hment of God's purpo&s;es, that at the pre&s;ent time the Ot|toman empire is at once threatened from both the&s;e quarters. The new &s;ect of the Nchabis in Arabia, are &s;aid to become more formidable. The&s;e are Mahomedan infidels, and their doctrine has nothing le&s;s in view than the de&s;truction of the whole &s;y&s;tem of Mahometani&s;m, as a &s;y&s;tem of &s;uper&s;tition, oppre&s;&s;ion and blood&s;hed. The founder of the &s;ect was the Shick Mahomed Jon Abduhl Vehab. This doctrine has been brooding, it is &s;aid, near &s;ixty years, and its advocates now &s;up|port their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ion by force of arms. They have adherents both &s;ecret and revealed among the Arabians in general. They are reported to po&s;&s;e&s;s the greater part of the country from Medina to Ba&s;&s;ora, on the
<PB N="83" REF="030090_0082_0FE475E32E833A00">Euphrates, and beyond it, and 40,000 men have been found in&s;ufficient to overpower them. The Porte is pur&s;uing mea&s;ures for their reduc|tion, and we mu&s;t wait the i&s;&s;ue before we can form any certain opinion; but it is probable that Mahometani&s;m, as well as Popery, will owe its fall to the prevalence of infidelity.&mdash;The &s;econd great enemy which is to contribute to the de&s;truction of the Turki&s;h empire, is to come from the north, and this &s;eems at pre&s;ent the mo&s;t formidable. Ever &s;ince the time that we have &s;uppo&s;ed the rage of the &s;econd woe to have ter|minated, (the latter end of the la&s;t century) the power of the Ru&s;&s;ians has been getting a bead of that of the Ottomans, and at this moment Con&s;tantinople trembles at the frown of the a&s;piring Catharine.</P>
<P>But here a difficulty pre&s;ents it&s;elf. As the Turks came originally from the neighbourhood of Mount Cauca&s;us, where the family of Gog was &s;ettled, and as they have long been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of mo&s;t of tho&s;e countries mentioned by the prophet Ezekiel, (chap. xxxviii. 2&mdash;6.) as the invaders of Pale&s;tine, after the Jews' re&s;toration, it has therefore been thought that the Turks are the people to whom the prophecy refers. But, if the Turki&s;h empire is to be overthrown to make way for the re&s;toration of the &s;eed of Abraham, how is this to be reconciled with the prediction of the prophet, and the generally-received opinion? Were I to enter into a laboured con&s;ideration of this &s;ubject, it would carry me far beyond the bounds I have pre&s;cribed my&s;elf. I &s;hall there|fore but ju&s;t touch upon it, and refer the reader for farther information to Well's <HI>Geography of the Old Te&s;t.</HI> vol. 1. chap. 3. &s;ect. 2.</P>
<P>Re&s;pecting Gog and his a&s;&s;ociates, mentioned by Ezekiel, it appears that Gog, or Magog, the &s;on of Japhet, &s;ettled him&s;elf about Mount Cauca&s;us, and is e&s;teemed the farther of the Scythians, who dwelt on the ea&s;t and north-ea&s;t of the Euxine or Black Sea; Gomer and his &s;on Togarmah peopled the northern track of the le&s;&s;er A&s;ia; Me&s;hech &s;ettled to the ea&s;tward of Gomer, in part of Cappadocia and Armenia, to the &s;outh and &s;outh-ea&s;t of the Black &s;ea; Tubal &s;ettled &s;till farther to the ea&s;tward, towards the Ca&s;pain Sea. The&s;e two latter were the near neighbours of Gog. From a colony of Tubal &s;prung the Ru&s;&s;ians; and the Mu&s;covites owe their origin to a colony of Me&s;hech. Dr. Wells, (vol. 1. p. 158.) treating on the origin of the Mu&s;covites and Ru&s;&s;ians, &s;ays, "That the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> or <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> in Europe were a colony originally of Me&s;hech or Mo&s;och, called by the Greeks Mo&s;chi, is very probable, not only on account of likene&s;s of names, but al&s;o of the re&s;pective &s;ituations of the A&s;iatic and European Mo&s;chi one to the other. Add to his another con&s;ideration, that whereas in our and &s;ome other tran&s;lations the Hebrew text, Ezek. xxxviii. 2. is rendered thus: <HI>The chief prince,</HI> or (as it is in the margin of our Bibles) <HI>the prince of the chief of Me&s;hech and Tubal;</HI> in other tran&s;lations, and particularly in the Septuagint, it is thus rendered; <HI>The prince of Ro&s;h Mo&s;hech, and Tubal.</HI> The thing is, the Hebrew word <HI>Ro&s;h,</HI> by &s;ome is taken to be an appellative, by others a proper name. The learned Bochart has ob&s;erved from the Nubian geographer, that the river in Armenia, called by the Greeks <HI>Araxes,</HI> is by the Arabians called <HI>Ro&s;h.</HI> And hence he not only probably infers, from other in&s;tances of the people that lived in the country about that river were al&s;o denom|inated Ro&s;h, but al&s;o proyes from J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ephus Bengorion, that there were a people in tho&s;e parts named Rho&s;&s;i. Now the Mo&s;chi and Ro&s;&s;i be|ing thus neighbours in A&s;ia, their colonies kept together in Europe, tho&s;e of the Mo&s;chi &s;eating them&s;elves in the province of Mu&s;covy,
<PB N="84" REF="030090_0083_0FE475EC9715DDC8">properly &s;o called, that is, the parts about the city of Mo&s;cow: tho&s;e of the Ro&s;h &s;eating them&s;elves in the parts adjoining on the &s;outh. For the learned Bochart has ob&s;erved from Tzetzes, that the people called Tauri, and from whom the Taurica Cher&s;one&s;us took its name, were, in the days of Tzetzes, better known by the name of Ros than of Tauri. Upon the whole, therefore, it may be very probably believed, that the Mu&s;covites and Ru&s;&s;ians in Europe were colonies of Me&s;hech, or el&s;e of Me&s;hech and Tubal jointly." Treating on the &s;ituation of Gog, as north of Tubal, &amp;c. he &s;ays, "This &s;ituation is confirmed by the &s;crip|ture it&s;elf, Ezek. xxxviii. 2. <HI>Set thy face again&s;t Gog. in, or of, the land of Magog, the prince of Ro&s;h, Me&s;hech, and Tubal, &amp;c.</HI> For hence we learn, that the <HI>land of Magog</HI> mu&s;t be near to that of Ro&s;h, Me&s;hech, and Tubal; and it could be &s;o only on the north. The learned Mr. Mede has ob&s;erved, that the rame Gog &s;ignifies the very &s;ame with Magog, the letter <HI>mem</HI> being but an heeman|tick letter, i. e. not a radical, but an additional letter to the radix or primitive word. And he conceives that it plea&s;ed the Spirit of God to di&s;tingui&s;h thus between the land and the people of the land, by calling the people Gog, and the land the Land of Magog."</P>
<P>Thus the Ru&s;&s;ians and Mu&s;covites them&s;elves appear to be included in the enumeration of Ezekiel, and we may ob&s;erve that they have al|ready extended their conque&s;ts into the neighbourhood of the Black and Ca&s;pian Seas, and of tho&s;e parts originally &s;ettled by Gog and their an|ce&s;tor Tubal. The probability is, that they will extend their conque&s;ts &s;till farther, and be di&s;tingui&s;hed in&s;truments in the overthrow of the Turki&s;h Empire. And having effected this, it is likely that, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their newly acquired &s;ubjects or allies from the Ca&s;pian to the Propontus, with the Per&s;ians, &amp;c. (the people enumerated by Eze|kiel), they will be the invading multitude marked out by the Spirit of Prophecy.</P>
<P>There is another <HI>&s;ign of the times</HI> al&s;o, which ought not to be entirely omitted. More than two thon&s;and five hundred years ago, the ten tribes of I&s;rael were carried captive into A&s;&s;yria. About a hundred and fifteen years after this Judah, and Benjamin al&s;o were carried away to Babylon. The&s;e returned, and &s;ome few of the other tribes with them; but as a nation, I&s;rael was never re&s;tored. According to E&s;|dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, (book 2. chap. xiii. 41&mdash;50), they took coun&s;el among them&s;elves, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> migrated into a di&s;tant country, where never man dwelt; that the name of this country was Ar&s;ateth, at the di&s;tance of a year and a half's journey, where they are to dwell till the latter time, when God will bring them back with great wonders. The prophets abound with promi&s;es, not only re&s;pecting the re&s;toration of Judah, (the Jews), but of I&s;rael al&s;o. From the&s;e tribes not having been heard of for &s;o many ages, and the improbability of &s;uch a people e&s;caping the notice of all travellers, the generality have been induced to conclude that they no where exi&s;t, as a di&s;tinct people, but have long ago been melted down among other nations, except tho&s;e that united them&s;elves with Judah and Benjamin, at their return from Babylon. That they &s;hould &s;till exi&s;t, is certainly a very extraordinary circum&s;tance; and &s;hould Pro|vidence bring them forward by and by, to act a con&s;picuous part in the great &s;cene which is now opening, it will doubtle&s;s excite great a&s;ton|i&s;hment: but both the event and the &s;urpri&s;e were fore&s;een and predict|ed by the prophets. They fore&s;aw that the re-union of Ephraim with Judah would not take place till after the great di&s;per&s;ion, and their
<PB N="85" REF="030090_0084_0FE475EF49646758">re&s;urrection from the long political death which they were to &s;uffer for their &s;ins. Then are Ephraim and Judah to be one people again, (Ezek. xxxvii. 16.&mdash;22.) And Judah &s;hall &s;ay, "Who hath brought up the&s;e? Behold I was le&s;t alone, the&s;e, where have they been?" (I&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. xlix. 21.)</P>
<P>Independent of the prophecies, there is rea&s;on to conclude that this people do &s;till exi&s;t di&s;tinct from other nations. The grounds for this conclu&s;ion may be &s;een in the A&s;iatic Re&s;earches, vol. 2. That the reader may judge for him&s;elf, I &s;hall take the liberty of quoting the extract which we find in the <HI>Monthly Review enlarged,</HI> vol. 10. p. 502. The account is whim&s;ical enough; but con&s;idering the number of ages &s;ince the carrying away I&s;rael captive, their corrupt &s;late at that time, their mi&s;erable condition &s;ince, their ignorance of printing, &amp;c. it affords as much proof as can be expected, at the fir&s;t dawn of their exi&s;tence. When we are better acquainted with them, their MSS. cu&s;toms, &amp;c. we may expect more light.</P>

<HEAD>On the de&s;cent of the Afghans from the Jews.</HEAD>
<P>"The Afghans call them&s;elves the po&s;terity of Melic Talut, or king Saul.&mdash;The de&s;cent of the A&s;ghans, according to their own tradition, is thus whim&s;ically traced:</P>
<P>"In a war which raged between the children of I&s;rael and the Amal|ekites, the latter being victorious, plundered the Jews, and obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ark of the covenant. Con&s;idering this the god of the Jews, they threw it into &s;ire, which did not effect it; they afterwards er|deavoured to cleave it with axes, but without &s;ucce&s;s: every individual who treated it with indignity, was puni&s;hed for his temerity. They then placed it in their temple, but all their idols bowed to it. At length they fa&s;tened it upon a cow, which they turned loo&s;e in the wilder|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>"When the prophet Samuel aro&s;e, the children of I&s;rael &s;aid to him, "We have been totally &s;ubdued by the Amalekites, and have no king. Rai&s;e to us a king, that we may be enabled to contend for the glory of God." Samuel &s;aid, "In ca&s;e you are led out to battle, are you deter|mined to &s;ight?" They an&s;wered, "What has befallen us that we &s;hould not fight again&s;t infidels? That nation has bani&s;hed us from our country and children." At this time the angel Gabriel de&s;cended, and delivering a wand, &s;aid, "It is the command of God, that the per&s;on who&s;e &s;tature &s;hall corre&s;pond with this wand, &s;hall be king of I&s;rael."</P>
<P>'Melic Talut was at that time a man of inferior condition, and per|formed the humble employment of feeding the goats and cows of others. One day a cow under his charge was accidentally lo&s;t. Being di&s;ap|pointed in his &s;earches, he was greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and applied to Sama|el, &s;aying, "I have lo&s;t a cow, and do not po&s;&s;e&s;s the means of &s;atisfy|ing the owner. Pray for me, that I may be executed from this diffi|culty." Samuel perceiving that he was a man of lofty &s;tature, a&s;ked his name. He an&s;wered, Talut. Samuel then &s;aid: "Mea&s;ure Ta|lut with the wand which the angel Gabriel brought." His &s;tature was equal to it. Samuel then &s;aid "God has rai&s;ed Talut to be your king." The children of I&s;real an&s;wered, "We are greater than our king. We are men of dignity, and he is of inferior condition. How &s;hall he be our king?" Samuel informed them, they &s;hould know that

<P>'After Talut obtained the kingdom, he &s;eized part of the territories of Jalut, or Goliath, who a&s;&s;embled a large army, but was killed by David. Talut afterwards died a martyr in a war again&s;t the infidels; and God con&s;tituted David king of the Jews.</P>
<P>'Melic Talut had two &s;ons, one called Berkia, and the other Irmia, who &s;erved David and were beloved by him. He &s;ent them to &s;ight again&s;t the infidels; and by God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance they were victorious.</P>
<P>'The &s;on of Berkia was called Afghan, and the &s;on of Irmia was named U&s;bec. The&s;e youths di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in the reign of David, and were employed by Solomon. Afghan was di&s;tingui&s;hed by his corporeal &s;trength, which &s;truck terror into demons and genii. U&s;bec was eminent for his leraning.</P>
<P>'Afghan u&s;ed frequently to make excur&s;ions to the mountains; where his progency, after his death, e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves, lived in a &s;tate of independence, built forts, and exterminated the infidels.'</P>
<P>"To this account we &s;hall &s;ubjoin a remark of the late Henry Van|&s;ittart, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> He ob&s;erves, that 'A very particular account of the Af|ghans has been written by the late Ha Fiz Rahmat Khan, a chief of: e Rohillas, from which the curious reader may derive much informa|tion. They are Mu&s;&s;almen, partly of the Sunni, and partly of the Shiah per&s;ua&s;ion. They are great boa&s;ters of the antiquity of their ori|gin, and reputation of their tribe; but other Mu&s;&s;almen entirely reject their claim, and con&s;ider them of modern and even ba&s;e extraction. However their character may be collected from hi&s;tory. They have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their courage, both &s;ingly and unitedly, principals and auxiliaries. They have conquered for their own princes and for foreigners, and have always been con&s;idered the main &s;trength of the army in which they have &s;erved. As they have been applauded for virtues, they have al&s;o been reproached for vices, having &s;ometimes been guilty of treachery, and even acted the ba&s;e part of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins."</P>

<P>A &s;pecimen of their language (the Pu&s;hto) is added; and the fol|lowing note is in&s;erted by the Pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>'This account of the Afghans may lead to a very intere&s;ting di&s;co|very.&mdash;We learn from E&s;dras, that the ten tribes, after a wandering journey, came to a country called Ar&s;areth, where we may &s;uppo&s;e they &s;ettled. Now the Afghans are &s;aid by the be&s;t Per&s;ian hi&s;torians to be de&s;cended from the Jews; they have traditions among them&s;elves of &s;uch a de&s;cent; and it is even a&s;&s;erted, that their families are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the names of Jewi&s;h tribes, although, &s;ince their conver&s;ion to the I&s;lam, they &s;tudiou&s;ly conceal their origin. The Pu&s;hto language, of which I have &s;een a dictionary, has a manife&s;t re&s;emblance to the Chaldaic; and a con&s;iderable di&s;trict under their dominion is called Hazarch, or Hazaret, which might ea&s;ily have been changed into the word u&s;ed by E&s;dias. I &s;trongly recommend an inquiry into the li|terature and hi&s;tory of the Afghans.</P>
<P>That after the &s;pace of more than 2500 years the ten tribes of I&s;rael &s;hould be fir&s;t re&s;tored to notice ju&s;t at this period, when &s;o many &s;igns indicate the approach of their re&s;toration, may be de&s;igned as a hint to us to be ready for what is coming. Let the tri&s;ling think what they may, I am &s;ure that the diligent &s;tudent in the writings of the prophet will be far from e&s;teeming this &s;ingular circum&s;tance unworthy of atten

<P>Among other &s;igns of the &s;peedy gathering and re&s;toration of I&s;rael, this is not the lea&s;t, that we are threatened with troubles &s;uch as have not been &s;ince there was a nation.

<HEAD>CONCLUSION: <HI>BEING AN ADDRESS TO THE</HI> PEOPLE OF GREAT BRITAIN.</HEAD>
<P>THUS, my countrymen, we have con&s;idered &s;ome of tho&s;e Signs of the Times, which, at this &s;ea&s;on of general agitation, &s;olicit our atten|tion with &s;ingular urgency: Signs which intimate nothing le&s;s than the general &s;haking and renovation of things. It becomes us therefore to attend to them with peculiar &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, that we may know the mea|&s;ures which we ought to pur&s;ue, and avoid precipitating our&s;elves into the dreadful con&s;equences of oppo&s;ing the providence of God, who in his word has forewarned us of his purpo&s;es, and by his di&s;pen&s;ations is in|dicating their &s;peedy accompli&s;hment;&mdash;it becomes us to ob&s;erve them with devout attention, that we may hereby be excited to turn to God by a &s;incere and general repentance, and thus be bid until tho indigna|tion be overpa&s;&s;: "For behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to puni&s;h the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; the earth al&s;o &s;hall di&s;clo&s;e her blood, and no longer cover her &s;lain." Now there|fore con&s;ider your ways.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="030090_0087_0FE475FB0C59AAB8">
I acknowledge that my apprehen&s;ions re&s;pecting our pro&s;pects are not &s;o much from the opinion I may entertain of the wi&s;dom or folly, the ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice, the piety or impiety, of the pre&s;ent war, in a de|tached view, as from the impre&s;&s;ion which the general appearance of things, compared with the writings of the prophets, produce on my mind; for, did I believe the pre&s;ent war (according to the general rule of e&s;timating things to be beyond all doubt, both politic and ju&s;t, even this would not much le&s;&s;en my apprehen&s;ion of danger. When we look back on ancient hi&s;tory, and trace the progre&s;s and fall of tho&s;e empires and &s;tates which In&s;piration has noticed, we &s;hall find that the long threatened judgments which fell upon them were not for the blame of tho&s;e particular wars in which they peri&s;hed, but for the accumulat|ed guilt of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages, and for the general corruption of their man|ners. Tho&s;e wars might be perfectly ju&s;t, becau&s;e defen&s;ive. If we examine the predictions of the prophets which refer to the cha&s;ti&s;ement of the nations and the de&s;truction of Babylon the Great, in the latter days, we &s;hall find that tho&s;e dreadful j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ments which are then to be inflicted, are to be for the &s;ins of centuries&mdash;for blood which has never been avenged. The &s;overeigns and rulers of that day may, perhaps, be among the mo&s;t mild and ju&s;t that have ever exerci&s;ed power; but we mu&s;t be &s;trangers to the hi&s;tory of nations, if we do not know that this will be no certain &s;ecurity. To in&s;tance only the ca&s;e of I&s;rael: Ho&s;hea was the be&s;t prince that ever reigned over that people:&mdash;the only one that had any mixture of good; yet, in his days their ruin came. If the great body of the nation be corrupt; if we approve the deeds of our fathers, and our iniquity be full; it is not the piety, or virtue, or ju&s;tice, of our princes and rulers that can &s;ecure us.</P>
<P>But though this is the ca&s;e, yet our obligations and our intere&s;t, as they re&s;pect both the policy and the morality of the war, remain the &s;ame. And if it be found that we are acting contrary to the principles both of policy and the eternal obligations of morality, we are certainly precipitating our fate, and aggravating our ruin. It becomes us then, with great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, to con&s;ider our ways: for it is not what the French are that a&s;certains the &s;afety or danger of our &s;ituation: they may be all that they are repre&s;ented to be, and yet our ca&s;e be never the better: the wor&s;e they are, the more &s;it are they, in &s;ome re&s;pects, to be the in&s;truments of God's threatened judgments.</P>
<P>The wi&s;dom or folly, the policy, or impolicy, of the pre&s;ent war, certainly de&s;erves the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration of all who de&s;ire the pro&s;perity of their country; but as &s;o many have writen &s;o ably on the&s;e &s;ubjects, it &s;eems the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary for me to detain the reader for the inve&s;tigation of them. But there are two or three things which, though they may not &s;o generally &s;trike the attention, at lea&s;t not &s;o as to produce any con&s;iderable apprehen&s;ion of danger, yet, if it be clear that they are connected with this war, there is &s;o much moral turpitude in them, that, to tho&s;e who believe in the all-&s;uperintending providence of the Creator, and the Divine in&s;piration of the Scriptures, they mu&s;t appear of a magnitude &s;ufficient to excite the extreme&s;t &s;olicitude, and the mo&s;t &s;incere concern.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for any ob&s;erving man who is at all conver&s;ant with what pa&s;&s;es about him, not to notice the unu&s;ual animo&s;ity which has manife&s;ted it&s;elf in this conte&s;t, both again&s;t the French and again&s;t all tho&s;e who differ from the fa&s;hionable opinion. So high has it rage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

The French are a nation of infidels&mdash;the enemies of all religion; and therefore de&s;erve to be ex|tirpated from the earth."&mdash;Admirable imitators of Him who came not to de&s;troy mens lives, but to &s;ave them!&mdash;A war of religion!

Is it a forgery, or is it deriv|ed from Him "who maketh his &s;un to ri&s;e on the evil and on the good, and who &s;endeth rain on the ju&s;t and on the unju&s;t; and de&s;ireth not the death of a &s;inner?"&mdash;But it is po&s;&s;ible that the accu&s;ation a|gain&s;t our enemies may not be exactly ju&s;t. Much as we execrate wick|edne&s;s, yet let us be impartial. Perhaps it &s;hould rather be, "They are infidels&mdash;the partizans of no &s;ect." Nobody &s;u&s;pects them to have much piety, yet, bad as they are, the freedom of every de&s;cription of wor|&s;hip is protected by all the force of the nation; but as it is likely the ma|jority of the repre&s;entatives of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he people have no religion them&s;elves, they have e&s;tabli&s;hed none, but have left religion to take care of it&s;elf, and work its own way by the native power of truth, ju&s;t as it was for|ced to do for the fir&s;t three hundred years after Chri&s;t, without either emoluments or penal &s;tatutes in its favour; but with this difference, that no man &s;hall per&s;ecute it, nor any one &s;ect per&s;ecute another, but if Chri&s;tianity be from God, that it &s;hall have free liberty to make its con|que&s;ts. Be our opinion what it may of the utility or mi&s;chief of reli|gious e&s;tabli&s;hments among Prote&s;tants, yet, is not this preferable to the &s;uper&s;titions and horrors of Popery? And if God in his providence &s;ees fit, by the&s;e methods, to overthrow the abominations of Rome, and thus to clear the way for undefiled religion, &s;hall we be angry with his di&s;pen&s;ations, or di&s;pute his wi&s;dom? We are not di&s;po&s;ed to palliate crimes, but let us di&s;tingui&s;hed between the crimes of men and the ju&s;|tice of Him who makes the madne&s;s of nations the in&s;trument of effect|ing both his avenging and benevolent purpo&s;es. We are impo&s;ed up|on by names, and &s;ounds, and mi&s;repre&s;entations, and then, in&s;pired with zeal without knowledge, &s;et our&s;elves up for the avengers of the cau&s;e of heaven. But let us be di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate;&mdash;let us examine our|&s;elves as under the eye of God. If nece&s;&s;ity oblige us to maintain war, yet let us beware of harbouring in our bo&s;oms the murderous and unchri&s;tian pa&s;&s;ions of rancour and ma levolence. If we a attacked, we have a right to defend our&s;elves; and benevolence is to be exerci&s;ed even towards enemies; and if they hunger, what are we to do? We know what the malignant &s;pirit of party and worldly policy will &s;ay&mdash;"Starve them."&mdash;But Chri&s;t &s;ays, "feed them." If we mu&s;t maintain war, and ju&s;tice &s;anctify it, yet let it be on tho&s;e prin|ciples of benevolence and magnanimity worthy of a great and enlight|ened nation, and then there might be &s;ome plau&s;ible ground to hope for the favour of providence. But malevolence would &s;tamp the ju&s;te&s;t war with guilt. And if this malevolence &s;hould be &s;uffered to take &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of as as to in&s;pire our devotions the guilt would be increa&s;ed.</P>

They feel their wrongs, they perceive their rights, and are determined to redre&s;s the one, and vindicate the other. They bring to ju&s;tice their oppre&s;&s;ors; they di&s;arm them of their power, &s;trip them of their di&s;gui&s;e, overturn their old oppre&s;&s;ive &s;y&s;tems, and form &s;uch new ones as they think mo&s;t likely to in&s;ure &s;ecurity and happine&s;s. In ef|fecting all this mighty work, folly is mixed with wi&s;dom, and outrage miggles with ju&s;tice.

The&s;e plot a|gain&s;t the nation; they a&s;&s;emble in neighbouring &s;tates; are encourag|ed; prepare for war, and invoke foreign aid.</P>
<P>On Augu&s;t 15, 1790, the neighbouring princes and potentales held a meeting at Pilnitz; a concert of crowned heads is formed, and it is agreed to invite the other &s;overeigns of Europe to join the league, and make the cau&s;e of the king, and of the other privileged orders of France, a common one. It is determined in the meanwhile to increa&s;e their armies, and prepare for the inva&s;ion of France, the fir&s;t favorable opportunity, that by the overthrow of the new con&s;titution, and the re|e&s;tabli&s;hment of the old de&s;poti&s;m, and the former &s;tate of things in the church, innovation may be &s;mitten in the root, and in other countries, be prevented. Thus did foreign courts a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves dictatorial power over an independent people, and formed a concert, not only for the purpo&s;e of overturning the liberties of France, but as if the world were made for princes, nobles, and prie&s;ts only, to intimidate all other nations from daring, in future, to attempt to meliorate their condition. &mdash;They have &s;ent forth the mo&s;t de&s;potic and bloody manife&s;tos that ever di&s;graced Europe. That of the Duke of Brun&s;wick is expre&s;&s;ed in a &s;tyle of &s;uch undi&s;gui&s;ed barbarity, that even Attila, who boa&s;ted of him&s;elf as the <HI>&s;courge of God, and the terror of men,</HI> would have blu&s;hed to have been the author of it.&mdash;They have invaded France; and the French in return have invaded them. Enormous crimes have been committed on both &s;ides; but we have not yet &s;een the end.</P>
<P>"But the concerns of the French are &s;o interwoven with the concerns and intere&s;ts of other nations; that the&s;e have felt them&s;elves injured, and their language has been &s;uch as to alarm and provoke their neigh|bours; and we al&s;o have been offended." This may be true. But have we acted according to tho&s;e excellent principles laid down by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Matt. xvii. and Luke xvii. for the putting an end to &s;trife, and for the prevention of blood&s;hed? Have we remon&s;trated and done all that negociation could do to prevent the horrors of war; or, has the flaming &s;word of de&s;truction preceded the olive branch of peace, and vengeance gone before remon&s;trance? Have we acted from &s;ober judgment and urgent nece&s;&s;ity, or from the dictates of ambition, and the workings of pa&s;&s;ion? Our innocence or guilt, re&s;pecting the blood which is &s;hed, and the &s;orrow which is occa&s;ioned, will depend much on the an&s;wer which facts give to the&s;e inquiries.

If it be on account of &s;ome of their fooli&s;h or unju&s;t decrees, yet, if we have not endeavoured by negociation to prevent the &s;pilling of human blood, and the accumulation of taxes, it is unju&s;t; and if, in|&s;tead of this, we have &s;purned at conce&s;&s;ion, as though re&s;olved on war at any rate, the inju&s;tice is increa&s;ed. If al&s;o it be a war to revenge the execution of the king, or for their humbling the nobility, or de&s;|poiling the prie&s;thood, it is unju&s;t; for who appointed us the univer&s;al judges and arbiters of nations?</P>
<P>"But it was nece&s;&s;ary to the prevention of a revolution, and of anarchy in this country." So &s;ay a certain de&s;cription of men. But this is not proved, not does it appear that it can be. Perhaps it would be more conformable to their true &s;entiments to &s;ay, "We thought it nece&s;&s;ary for the prevention of reformation."</P>
<P>Let us then examine with di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s the principles of the war in which we are engaged, that if it be unju&s;t, we may repent, and do what we legally can to wa&s;h our hands from the &s;tain of innocent blood. Men under de&s;potic government may, perhaps, be &s;ilent and innocent; but Engli&s;hmen are allowed to &s;peak. Under a free govern|ment, &s;ilence is guilt. The nation called for the war; if, after ma|ture thought, they find them&s;elves deceived, or apprehend not only its impolicy, but its inju&s;tice, they are bound to &s;ignify it, or innocent blood (that of our own people, at lea&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ing the blood of Fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h|men to be of no value in the eyes of the Father of all) will cry again&s;t us.</P>
<P>Let us farther examine whether we are acting worthy of our character as Prote&s;tants and Chri&s;tians, who are enlightened into the true prin|ciples of the religion of Chri&s;t. It is po&s;&s;ible that our motives and aims may be di&s;&s;imilar to tho&s;e who are engaged in the &s;ame quarrel; but who are they? The dragon and the bea&s;t. Mo&s;t of them have long been the &s;courges of the earth, the cur&s;es of humanity, and their e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d is to peri&s;h for ever. It is po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e that we may mean well; but what are the intentions of the a&s;&s;ociates by who&s;e &s;ide we are fight|ing? To keep Popery from falling, to maintain the power and influ|ence of the clergy, and all that error and &s;uper&s;titio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> by which they fa&s;ten on the minds of mankind, and circuitou&s;ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their own de&s;potic power. But be the motives and aims of &s;om<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> what they may, every man's duty is to judge him&s;elf, as in the &s;ight of God, that he be not judged; and as it is po&s;&s;ible that that which is highly criminal may meet with the approbation of the majority of a nation, and thus great national guilt be incurred, it becomes us to examine our&s;elves on this important point.</P>
<P>Our religion teaches us, and our fathers, the reformers, were zeal|ous in impre&s;&s;ing its dictates, that Rome is the whore of Babylon, the mother of harlots, and no true church of Chri&s;t; that Popery is &s;uper|&s;tition and idolatry; a religion at once at war again&s;t the kingdom of Chri&s;t and the happine&s;s of mankind; a religion tyrannical, bla&s;phemous and diabolical, in principle, and bloody in practice. Our religion teaches us, that this &s;ame &s;y&s;tem of corruption and oppre&s;&s;ion, which impregnates all the governments which receives it, and all the religious e&s;tabli&s;hments which grow out of it, with its own en&s;laving and corrupt principles, &s;hall be brought to an end, worthy of its enormities; it has determined and delineated the &s;igns for the accompli&s;hment, and charged us to watch their appearance and to have no alliance with them other

If the &s;igns of the times indicate the approach of the threaten|ed judgments, our part is to &s;tand at a di&s;tance and contemplate the progre&s;s of the awful ruin, and not ru&s;h into the conflict, to &s;lop the uplifted arm of God's vengeance; then might be fulfilled in our favour that &s;aying, (P&s;al. xci. 7, 8.) "A thou&s;and &s;hall fall at thy &s;ide, and ten thou&s;and at thy right hand, but it &s;hall not come nigh thee; only with thine eyes &s;halt thou behold and &s;ee the reward of the wicked." But, if we join i&s;&s;ue with the declared &s;upporters of the whore of Ba|bylon, and unite with them to arre&s;t the vengeance of Heaven, what fate have we to expect, but to &s;hare in their ruin? a ruin as dreadful as it will be exten&s;ive!</P>
<P>Thus, my countrymen, I have endeavoured to &s;et before you, in the be&s;t manner I am able, the &s;igns of the times, and what they por|tend. I have endeavoured to rou&s;e your attention to the con&s;ideration of your ways, and your true intere&s;t, that you may take &s;uch mea&s;ures as may be the mo&s;t likely to &s;ecure us from the de&s;olations of that &s;torm which already &s;hakes the greater part of Europe&mdash;a &s;torm, if our con|ceptions are ju&s;t, which will &s;peedily lay in ruins all the nations which &s;hall be found oppo&s;ing the de&s;igns of God in the overthrow of that An|tichri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, &s;ecular and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, which has &s;o long cor|rupted and de&s;troyed the earth.</P>
<P><HI>As it was in the days of Noe, before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came and took them all away, &s;o &s;hall al&s;o the coming of the Son of Man,</HI> in the execution of the divine judgments on the wicked nations, <HI>be.</HI> Say not in your hearts then, "He delayeth his coming;" for he has fore|warned us that he will come as a thief in the night, at a time when not expected.</P>
<P>Let us therefore watch and repent. Reformations in governments, if attainable at any tolerable price, are very de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rable; but we deceive our&s;elves, if we imagine that this will be &s;ufficient to en&s;ure the general peace and happine&s;s of &s;ociety. Unle&s;s the great ma&s;s of mankind are reformed and chri&s;tianized, every thing el&s;e will be in&s;ufficient. Whil&s;t pride, ambition and corruption predominate; whil&s;t meanne&s;s and &s;ervelity on the one hand, and refratiorine&s;s and contempt of au|thority on the other, prevail; whil&s;t the moral &s;en&s;e of the generality of mankind is corrupt; or, as our Lord expre&s;&s;es it, whil&s;t <HI>the light which is in them is darkne&s;s,</HI> and irreligion and vice triumph, it is in vain to expect any great good. I own I am extremely de&s;irous of &s;eeing a peace able reformation take place in the repre&s;entation, and in the adminu&s;tration of the affairs of this country, as that which might contribute much to the bettering mankind, and which alone promi&s;es any hope of e&s;caping the calamities of a revolution, or of alleviating the other di&s;tre&s;&s;es which threaten us. But, if this &s;hould be accompli&s;h|ed, and nothing but this, I confe&s;s my expectations are not very &s;an|guine as to the great and permanent good which would follow. As a corrupt government diffu&s;es its corruptions through the whole ma&s;s of &s;ociety, to, &s;hould a few wi&s;e and virtuous men effect a pure govern|ment, yet, if the body of the nation remained uninformed, they would &s;oon corrupt the be&s;t in&s;titutions, and the admini&s;tration of the be&s;t government that the human intellect could devi&s;e, and nothing could &s;till &s;ave us from the di&s;plea&s;ure of God. Let both the&s;e reformations,
<PB N="93" REF="030090_0092_0FE47609471B4278">therefore, go hand in hand, and let them &s;peedily be commenced; For nothing &s;hort of in&s;tant reformation, and an in&s;tant change of mea&s;ures, can afford us any &s;olid hope of &s;alvation. Did God &s;ay, re&s;pecting the profligate Jews, when the whole body politic was di&s;ea&s;ed from the head to the foot, "Shall not my &s;oul be avenged on &s;uch a nation as this?" What have the nations under the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, to expect, if, like them, they become univer&s;ally di&s;ea&s;ed? Let us therefore examine our&s;elves and repent.</P>
<P>What, in a general view, is our moral character as a nation? Has our virtue, our moderation, our ju&s;tice, our love of civil and religious liberty, and our attachment to the principles of Prote&s;tani&s;m, kept pace with our advancement in the &s;cale of nations? We are called by the name of Chri&s;t, and profe&s;s to be a religious people; but, do we ex|emplify in our practice what we profe&s;s? Do we do ju&s;tly, love mer|cy, and walk humbly with God; or, does infidelity and profanene&s;s, bribery and corruption, lewdne&s;s and debauchery, pride and di&s;&s;pa|tion, pervade all ranks of men, and threaten an univer&s;al di&s;&s;olution? Are the rights of con&s;cience revered; or, is our fondne&s;s for the wine of the whore of Babylon returning, and are we to judge of the temper of the nation, from the flames which bigotry kindled at Birmingham in ninety-one? We are a nation of profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians. The pa&s;tors which we approve, whether of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church or otherwi&s;e, are they the meek and humble imitators of Him who&s;e &s;ervants they are called? Do the generality of them &s;eek, not filthy lucre, but the &s;alva|tion of the &s;ouls of men? Are they faithful, to reprove and warn; or, do they preach to us &s;mooth things, and &s;ay, Peace, peace, when there is no peace? Are they diligent in the di&s;charge of their duties&mdash;labour|ing to in&s;truct the ignorant, to reclaim the vicious, to comfort the af|flicted, and to unite men in the bonds of charity; or, are they proud and worldly; diligent only after gain; idle &s;hepherds, who care not for the &s;tock, and who &s;ow among mankind the &s;eeds of contention? Do they recommend and enforce the religion which they profe&s;s by the holine&s;s and purity, benevolence and piety of their lives; or, are they lovers of plea&s;ure, eating and drinking with the drunken, <HI>who&s;e end is de&s;truction, who&s;e god is their belly, and who&s;e glory is in their &s;hame; who mind earthly things?</HI> (Phil. iii. 19.) Are the great body of the people content to have it thus, and moved only by what affects their worldly intere&s;t? Should this, on examina|tion, be found to be the ca&s;e, it &s;urely calls for deep humiliation, and &s;ugge&s;ts that, without a repentance and reformation, as general as &s;in|cere, &s;ome heavy calamity mu&s;t bur&s;t upon us.</P>
<P>I am well aware that there are many who will turn my &s;entiments into ridicule, and that more &s;till will make light of them; for it is in all our hearts to &s;ay, "All things continue as they were from the be|ginning of the creation; the evil will not come in our days. Does the angel &s;wear by him that liveth for ever and ever, that delay &s;hall be no longer?" "Prepare to meet your God." Ye corrupters of the holy and benevolent religion of Je&s;us, and ye oppre&s;&s;ors of mankind; ye proud bia&s;phemers, and ye per&s;ecutors of the &s;ervants of God, prepare for the day of reckoning; for behold, "The whirlwind of the Lord goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind; it &s;hall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked. The fierce anger of the Lord &s;hall not return until he have done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart. In the latter day ye &s;hall con&s;ider it." (Jer. xxv. 23,
<PB N="94" REF="030090_0093_0FE4760AE8963A70">24.) Ye who wor&s;hip the mammon of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;acrifice nations for gain; who have carried de&s;olation to the utmo&s;t bounds of the earth, and, having en&s;laved mankind with filthy lucre, are inge|nious to invent apologies for your enormous crimes; <HI>Prepare to meet your God.</HI> "Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your mi|&s;eries which &s;hall come upon you.&mdash;Behold, the hire of your labourers; which is of you kept back, crieth again&s;t you." "O Tyrus, the mart of nations! thou ha&s;t &s;aid, I am of perfect beanty; I am God; I &s;it in the feat of God, in the mid&s;t of the &s;eas. Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters. In the time (if thou repente&s;t not) when thon &s;halt be broken by the &s;eas in the depth of the waters, thy merchandize, and all thy company, in the mid&s;t of thee, &s;hall fall."</P>
<P>Ye dozing watchmen of our I&s;rael, who talk to the people of the follies of enthu&s;ia&s;m, till their faith in the Divine predictions, which was intended to have been a guard to their hearts again&s;t the &s;urfeiting cares of the world, and to keep them vigilant, has lo&s;t all its power, and they are lulled into a &s;ecurity from which nothing can rou&s;e them &s;hort of the voice of that trumpet which will rend the heavens and the earth. Sleep on, and take your re&s;t&mdash;But at midnight ye &s;hall hear a great cry made&mdash;"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him." Ye hireling &s;hepherds, e&s;pecially, who have converted the re|ligion of Chri&s;t into a &s;y&s;tem of worldly traffic; who live in plea&s;ure, and, having fed your&s;elves with the fat, and clothed you with the wool, abu&s;e, in&s;tead of feeding, the &s;lock; prepare to meet your God; for the time of his judgments &s;hall be no longer delayed, but they who have beaten their fellow-&s;ervants, and ate and drank with the drunken, he will cut them a&s;under, and appoint them their portion with the hy|pocrites.</P>
<P>Let men of all de&s;criptions and characters (revolving in their minds the <HI>&s;igns of the times</HI>) hear the awful declaration of the angel, and take warning. The &s;ins of the great whore who &s;itteth on many waters, and of the wrath of her fornications, are come into remembrance. Come out of her, therefore, ye Prote&s;tants, and all that fear God, that ye be not partakers of her &s;ins, and receive not of her plagues.</P>
