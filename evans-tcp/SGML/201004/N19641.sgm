<BIBL><HI>DEUTERONOMY, IV. 7, 8, 9.</HI></BIBL>
<Q>For what nation is there &s;o great, who hath <HI>GOD</HI> &s;o nigh unto them, as the <HI>LORD</HI> cur <HI>GOD</HI> is in all things that we call upon him for? And what na|tion is there &s;o great, that hath &s;tatutes and judg|ments &s;o righteous, as all this law which I &s;et be|fore you this day? Only take heed to thy&s;elf, and keep thy &s;oul diligently, le&s;t thou forget the things which thine eyes have &s;een, and le&s;t they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life; but teach them thy &s;ons, and thy &s;ons' &s;ons.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MY Chri&s;tian Brethren, we are now a&s;&s;embled into the Divine Pre&s;ence, on one of tho&s;e anniver&s;ary days, in which every grateful heart mu&s;t feel highly intere&s;ted, and in which every &s;oul is mo&s;t devoutly called to expre&s;s a &s;en&s;e of his dependence on Divine Providence, and thankful ac|knowledgments to the FATHER of the univer&s;e. The duty which we are now &s;olemni&s;ing, is mo&s;t highly becoming a Chri&s;tian people, and is of that kind which con&s;titutes the &s;ublime&s;t part of wor&s;hip, which intelligences can ren|der to their CREATOR. In our u&s;ual addre&s;&s;es of the throne of grace we are looking for benefits; and the end of petition centres on &s;elf. In adoration, which is the mo&s;t <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted</HI> as well as mo&s;t <HI>delightful</HI> of human duties, the mind is drawn forth from it&s;elf, by the view of Supreme Excellence; and the DEITY <HI>alone</HI> ab&s;orbs every attention.</P>
<P>Had man never &s;inned, there had been no bleeding vic|tim, nor need of an Interce&s;&s;or. And in the future &s;tate, when perfect holine&s;s &s;hall be re&s;tored, <HI>prayer</HI> &s;hall cea&s;e, <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>hope</HI> will cea&s;e; but <HI>adoration, prai&s;e, charity</HI> and <HI>love</HI> &s;hall exi&s;t forever.</P>
<P>When the duty of prai&s;ing GOD is rightly performed, there ever accompanies it a <HI>lively di&s;pe&s;ition</HI> of mind. The heart is &s;oothed and elevated, a divine plea&s;ure <HI>expands</HI> the &s;oul, and, being <HI>irradiated</HI> by the &s;plendor of the <HI>Su|preme Good,</HI> is <HI>ab&s;orbed</HI> in GOD, and rai&s;ed above <HI>all</HI> world|ly cares, allurements and amu&s;ements, to a <HI>peace and joy which the world cannot give or take away.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="025638_0005_0FCEAD331634D080">
The human mind, its principles, habits, modes of think|ing and conduct will ever be greatly affected by the objects of its mo&s;t frequent contemplation. This originates the different manners of the prince and the pea&s;ant But <HI>where</HI> is an object &s;o calculated to enlarge and aggrandize the &s;oul, and all its powers, and to lift it above all low and &s;or|did motives, as the Divine Being when adored by us, in that amiable view in which the whole biblical volume pre|&s;ents HIM. But while the mind is elevated with joy rai&s;|ed by the act of prai&s;e above worldly concerns, and greatly enlarged by contemplating upon a Being &s;o filled with per|fection, it is al&s;o humbled as to the du&s;t by the unavoida|ble view of its own in&s;ignificance. <HI>The heavens are not clean in his &s;ight, and the angels He chargeth with folly; what then is man!</HI></P>
<P>Such being the advantages of that religious &s;ervice, which we are this day to offer to the Great Benefactor of the world, let us enter upon it with <HI>all</HI> tho&s;e <HI>devout</HI> and <HI>enlarged</HI> principles, which the <HI>high objects</HI> of gratitude now demand.</P>
<P>To in&s;pire us with the&s;e elevated &s;entiments, few porti|ons of the &s;acred &s;criptures are better adapted than the text which I have read to you. In this you &s;ee the <HI>holy prophet,</HI> in whom the legi&s;lator and the father of his peo|ple are mo&s;t admirably united, and beautifully illu&s;trated, leading the cho&s;en tribes to realize, that the favor of GOD and the &s;miles of heaven, are not only the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;|ings, but the highe&s;t aggrandi&s;ement of any nation. At the clo&s;e of a life filled with the mo&s;t unremitting labors, di&s;intere&s;ted exertions, and uncea&s;ing vigilance and prayer for their pro&s;perity, he had now been recounting the in|&s;tances of Divine goodne&s;s, which they had experienced, that by impre&s;&s;ing their minds with the beneficence of GOD, he might per&s;uade them to feel the greatne&s;s of their obli|gations, and "<HI>not &s;uffer them to depart from their hearts all the days of their lives, but</HI> to <HI>teach them</HI> to <HI>their &s;ons, and their &s;ons' &s;ons.</HI>"</P>
<P>"<HI>For what nation is there &s;o great, who hath</HI> GOD <HI>&s;o nigh unto them, as the</HI> LORD <HI>our</HI> GOD <HI>is, in all things that we call upon him for!</HI>"&mdash;We are peculiarly happy in having an in|&s;pired prophet to a&s;&s;ure us, <HI>in the name of</HI> GOD, of what the hi&s;tory of ages and the experience of the world have united to convince us, that no people is &s;o truly great, as that which hath the LORD their GOD <HI>nigh unto them.</HI> In this re&s;pect the nation of I&s;rael appeared highly illu&s;trious. Their GOD, in whom they tru&s;ted, going before them in a pillar of cloud by day and of &s;ire by night, and <HI>being a very pre&s;ent help in time of trouble.</HI> To all their greatne&s;s were they rai&s;ed by the hand of GOD. Divine Sovereignty, who&s;e <HI>power</HI> is ever connected with <HI>benevelence,</HI> beheld a
<PB N="7" REF="025638_0006_0FCEAD34C8E5B9A8">people whom HE <HI>loved,</HI> clanking the chains of &s;lavery under Egypt's lords; HE <HI>beheld the oppre&s;&s;or and the oppre&s;&s;ed;</HI> HE <HI>&s;aw the tears of the oppre&s;&s;ed, and there was none to comfort them; and on the &s;ide of the oppre&s;&s;or there was power, but they had no comforter:</HI> HE &s;aw this, with that <HI>frown</HI> of indigna|tion which commands empires to their original <HI>nothingne&s;s,</HI> and rai&s;ed the Son of Amram to emancipate I&s;rael from &s;lavery, and to lead them to a land of liberty, to the confu|&s;ion of their enemies, and the de&s;truction of their tyrants. The father of that people was cho&s;en by Heaven, on account of his faith and piety, to be one, in whom not only his children, but all the families of the earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed: ble&s;&s;ed with a Prince to ari&s;e and &s;way the &s;ceptre of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and to erect, on the ruins of all unju&s;t do|minions, a kingdom of the mo&s;t perfect government, of the wi&s;e&s;t laws, and filled with the mo&s;t virtuous and happy &s;ubjects, enjoying peace, liberty and bli&s;s. To what <HI>high pro&s;perity</HI> was that nation afterwards rai&s;ed, <HI>entirely</HI> by the <HI>&s;overeign</HI> favor of HEAVEN! In an age of great darkne&s;s. when the governments of the world were &s;y&s;tems of oppre&s;|&s;ion, and their &s;ubjects educated to believe that they were born to be &s;laves to the will of tyrants, this people were illuminated in the knowledge of the principles of the <HI>noble&s;t</HI> truths; <HI>truths</HI> to which the &s;uperior improvements of mo|dern times bear the mo&s;t honorable te&s;timony, and acknow|ledge that they are incapable of greater perfection, and that truly there was the finger of GOD. While other nati|ons were ruled by oppre&s;&s;ors, <HI>neither fearing</HI> GOD <HI>nor re|garding man, they</HI> were ble&s;&s;ed with one, who&s;e ruling prin|ciple was the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted love to his people, as was mo&s;t amply evinced in that mo&s;t benevolent prayer of his, that they might be &s;aved, to which he added, "<HI>if not, blot me, I pray Thee, out of the book which</HI> THOU <HI>ha&s;t written.</HI>" In him we behold a prophet, a legi&s;lator, and the father of his people, united to which we might add one who could &s;ay. "I fear my GOD and HIM alone." By him de&s;ignated and rai&s;ed up for that people, they were ble&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of religious and civil polity, blended with each o|ther&mdash;a &s;y&s;tem &s;o calculated to an&s;wer many grand and no|ble de&s;igns in Divine providence; a &s;y&s;tem &s;o calculated to produce patrioti&s;m, mutual love and the clo&s;e&s;t political union, as witne&s;s their laws for triennial a&s;&s;emblies, tho&s;e for the prevention of perpetual &s;lavery, tho&s;e for the relief of every &s;pecies of di&s;tre&s;s, that, to this day, Mo&s;es is ve|nerable as a legi&s;lator; but in former days, their laws, their government, and their enlightened policy were the admiration and envy of the world.</P>
<P>Thus were they aggrandi&s;ed by the goodne&s;s of the Di|vine Sovereign. <HI>By this alone;</HI> for in the hi&s;tory of &s;ix thou&s;and years, not a &s;ingle in&s;tance, de&s;erving a parrallel,
<PB N="8" REF="025638_0007_0FCEAD35FAEB8AB8">is to be found, in which a nation has ari&s;en from ob&s;curity, &s;lavery, wretchedne&s;s, or the ignorance attending de&s;potick governments, to be ble&s;&s;ed with a &s;y&s;tem of religious and civil polity, inducing liberty and happine&s;s, <HI>unle&s;s favored by a Divine revelation,</HI> or <HI>the immediate hand of</HI> HEAVEN. As I&s;rael ro&s;e to liberty and glory by the &s;overeign goodne&s;s of GOD, as their &s;afety and pro&s;perity depended entirely on having <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>their</HI> GOD <HI>near unto them in all that they called upon</HI> HIM for, how &s;oon did they &s;ink into infamy and contempt, when, becau&s;e of their high and long repeated ingratitude, they were rejected of their Divine Protector.</P>
<P>To apply the&s;e remarks to our own nation&mdash;To what glo|ry have <HI>we</HI> ri&s;en <HI>by the &s;miles of</HI> HEAVEN? To what el&s;e can we impute that lu&s;tre, independence and glory, which have rendered us the admiration of a&s;toni&s;hed Europe? Many have been the times, in which we have been reduced to &s;ay, <HI>We can only &s;tand &s;till and &s;ee the &s;alvation of our</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>Few of us but may recollect tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons of national di&s;|tre&s;s, in which our tribes mournfully repaired to the hou&s;e of the LORD, <HI>feelingly</HI> impre&s;&s;ed with the belief, that if we were <HI>ever</HI> &s;aved, it mu&s;t be by the ROCK that is higher than man. Then we fully believed the infinitely intere&s;ting truths, which we are now contemplating: then we needed no prophet to inculcate them, as the immediate me&s;&s;age of GOD. We were ready to receive them. And when the GREAT SOVEREIGN, who di&s;po&s;eth of empires according to His will, looked down from the throne of his Glory on our di&s;tre&s;s, we gladly rea&s;&s;umed "the harp that had been hanging on the willows," and unitedly acknowledged, <HI>Had not the</HI> LORD <HI>been on our &s;ide, when our enemies ro&s;e up again&s;t us, the waters had overwhelmed us, the &s;tream had gone over our &s;ouls.</HI> How important is it that the&s;e &s;entiments be indelibly impre&s;&s;ed upon our minds, and that we ac|knowledge, with an ea&s;tern prince, "Thou Mo&s;t High, rul|e&s;t in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth." Never was there a people more truly origina|ted and protected by Divine Providence than this; and ne|ver was the hand of GOD more evidently and &s;ignally lift|ed up on behalf of any people, in a &s;ea&s;on of the mo&s;t trying emergency, than we our&s;elves have &s;een. How &s;ignal the ble&s;&s;ing of a temporal &s;avior, de&s;ignated by Divine Provi|dence, in the day of our di&s;tre&s;s, mo&s;t inimitably qualified with abilities and patrioti&s;m for the arduous work of giv|ing empire to the nation; a character &s;o renowned among the nations for great and different talents, &s;o happily blen|ded and concentrating in the &s;ame mind, that the &s;ons of I&s;rael had not more real cau&s;e to believe that their deliver|er, from the hou&s;e of bondage, was &s;ent to them by the 'I AM,' who appeared on the mount, than we have, to be a&s;&s;ur|ed that ours was purpo&s;ely rai&s;ed by HEAVEN, for the day
<PB N="9" REF="025638_0008_0FCEAD384EE42240">when his country called for his important &s;ervices. If we con&s;ider that &s;y&s;tem of government under which we live, and that happine&s;s which it has diffu&s;ed thro all ranks; if we recollect that this land is become known thro' the world, a land of liberty, political, civil and religious, where all tho&s;e vain di&s;tinctions, on which numbers have thought them&s;elves entitled to almo&s;t every homage, and &s;ecured from the ju&s;t con&s;equences of their crimes and guilt, are here not to be found; a land where ob&s;curity of birth or fortune does not prevent the honors due to real merit; a land where the Jew and the Greek have equal reception, and where liberal &s;entiments, on the rights of human na|ture, have &s;o far prevailed, that there have been the mo&s;t noble exertions, that the prophecy of Noah, concerning a very unhappy branch of his family, which for ages has been mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hingly verified, might come to a conclu&s;ion, and hereafter the de&s;endants of Shem and Ham and Japhet might &s;tand on a level, and acknowledge each other as brethren. <HI>What nation is there &s;o great, who hath</HI> GOD <HI>&s;o nigh unto them, as the</HI> LORD <HI>our</HI> GOD <HI>is, in all things that we call upon Him for? and what nation is there &s;o great, that hath &s;tatutes and judgments &s;o righteous</HI> as has been given to this favored land? But upon a day like this, it becomes us more particularly to enumerate the in&s;tances of that real great|ne&s;s, to which this nation has been rai&s;ed by the &s;miles of HEAVEN. If any degree of it con&s;i&s;ts in the too cu&s;tomary, but now exploded, method of mea&s;uring the greatne&s;s of a kingdom by the extent of territory, we might boa&s;t of greater glory than &s;ome of the mo&s;t famous and potent na|tions, which have figured in the page of hi&s;tory. But Ju|dea, Greece and other &s;tates have become renowned, not by exten&s;ive territory, but by their noble and liberal policy, their wi&s;e laws, their general liberty, their high patriot|i&s;m, and the great encouragement to every thing which might conduce to heighten, aggrandize and ble&s;s the &s;ub|jects of government. Let us then endeavour to find that real greatne&s;s to which we have been rai&s;ed, in tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances in which we have ju&s;tly become the admiration of the world. And here we might ob&s;erve, that it is a na|tion in which, from the earlie&s;t &s;ettlement of it, there have exi&s;ted the mo&s;t noble and valuable in&s;titutions, &s;acred and civil, which have been tran&s;mitted from the fathers to the children, and have been pre&s;erved hitherto to de&s;cend to ri&s;ing generations. However true it may be, that the fir&s;t inhabitants of this country, may have imbibed and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many prejudices peculiar to tho&s;e days, and to which &s;carce any people have been known to ri&s;e wholly &s;uperior, &s;till we mu&s;t venerate them for their pious regard to po&s;|terity, and for their noble in&s;titutions, &s;acred and civil, the benefit of which we now enjoy, and by which we have ari&s;|en
<PB N="10" REF="025638_0009_0FCEAD39BB0D4388">to a mo&s;t eminent di&s;tinction, and enviable glory to the &s;urrounding world.</P>
<P>We may next ob&s;erve, that it is a nation in which the government is truly repre&s;entative. This can be &s;aid of no one &s;o truly, as of that in which we live. In the &s;y&s;tem of the Jewi&s;h legi&s;lator, the high civil and &s;acred offices, tho' for Divine rea&s;ons, were limited to a tribe or a fami|ly. There is an European nation, to which we were once mo&s;t nearly allied, that boa&s;ts of a repre&s;entative govern|ment, but where the fir&s;t legi&s;lative offices are compleatly hereditary, and in the others but a very incon&s;iderable proportion of the people are repre&s;ented. If we &s;urvey the European &s;tates, called republican, they are far from being &s;trictly repre&s;entative. Privileged orders are found in every civilized country of Europe, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing powers incompatible with a ju&s;t repre&s;entation. This favored people only, to whom <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>our</HI> GOD <HI>has been nigh in all that they have called upon Him for,</HI> has been cho&s;en by HEA|VEN, to realize the fullne&s;s of a ble&s;&s;ing re&s;ulting from this circum&s;tance of civil government. Here any one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of property &s;ufficient to make him feel him&s;elf intere&s;ted in the pro&s;perity of the nation, and &s;mall indeed is the ex|ception, has a voice in the election to the fir&s;t offices of &s;tate. This is a circum&s;tance that con&s;titutes no little part of that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> greatne&s;s to which we have been rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>We may next ob&s;erve, that this people have had the &s;in|gular felicity of living under a government, in which there has been a very high enjoyment of all the rights of nature. Nature gives no one a right to oppre&s;s his fellow creatures, nor to hold in &s;ervitude his body or mind, his faith or ac|tions. Accordingly no one is here permitted to a&s;&s;ume ar|bitrary di&s;tinctions, and unju&s;t &s;uperiority; none po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es ci|vil or religious powers, but what are voluntarily conferred; and the Savior's command, to call no man Rabbi or Father, &s;eems to have been received, and in a great mea&s;ure ac|compli&s;hed. Tho&s;e high founding titles, many of which &s;hould be appropriate to JEHOVAH alone, under which villainy was &s;heltered from ju&s;tice, made &s;acred and vene|rated by deluded ignorance, and by which, for too many ages, the <HI>greate&s;t &s;courges</HI> of the human race have, in the <HI>name of</HI> GOD, carried on the mo&s;t ambitious and tyrannick de&s;igns, both in political and religious matters, and by which they have made nations, kept by their policy in the mo&s;t con&s;ummate ignorance, tamely to &s;ubmit to the mo&s;t cruel impo&s;itions, &s;anctified by the name of a BEING whom they ju&s;tly adored, are in this nation not to be found. This people by means of the valuable in&s;titutions tran&s;mitted to us from the rathers, for promoting u&s;eful knowledge, have become too enlightened for the impo&s;itions of any, who &s;hould come to us like the prophet of Mecca, with the &s;word in
<PB N="11" REF="025638_0010_0FCEAD3B488BF918">one hand and the Koran in his other. The rights of nature have at length found an a&s;&s;ylum in this favored land. Here we make the laws by which we choo&s;e to be bound, and profe&s;s and peaceably practi&s;e that mode of religion, by which we are inclined to wor&s;hip the GOD of our fathers.</P>
<P>We may next ob&s;erve, that we live under a government, in which every kind of u&s;eful indu&s;try is mo&s;t liberally en|couraged. Separate from the incitement ari&s;ing from &s;e|veral legi&s;lative acts, there have numerous &s;ocieties origi|nated from the patrioti&s;m and publick &s;pirit of influential per&s;ons, which have excited general emulation for excel|lence and perfection, in the various arts of u&s;eful indu&s;try. Indu&s;try has ever been found &s;ucce&s;sful in rai&s;ing &s;tates and empires, even of the mo&s;t unpromi&s;ing beginning, to ranks of the fir&s;t eminence. An indu&s;trious people will ever be a flouri&s;hing and happy people. Under de&s;potick govern|ments there is but little encouragement for the u&s;eful arts; in republics they have ever found the highe&s;t patrouage, and the greate&s;t perfection. In a nation as this, where in|du&s;try <HI>finds</HI> the mo&s;t flattering wi&s;hes of individuals emu|lous of improvement &s;o fully gratified; where our labors are not only rewarded by the honors of the great, but where they are &s;ecured in the profits ari&s;ing from them, without the danger of their being &s;ubjected to the never cea&s;ing demands of tyranny, what a pro&s;pect of ri&s;ing greatne&s;s pre&s;ents it&s;elf to every view. Whoever labors in this country enjoys the good of his labor; and is &s;ecured in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, while his children ari&s;e and are benefited by the indu&s;try of a parent. And this, you will ea&s;ily per|ceive is a much greater ble&s;&s;ing, than if it were po&s;&s;ible that every want of the individual were &s;upplied by the publick. Nece&s;&s;ity brings action, and action is the life and beauty of the world. If the Almighty were to &s;upply us with the gratification of every de&s;ire without our labor and exertion, what would the world be, but a &s;cene of idle|ne&s;s and in inactivity. More than half the beauty of creati|on would be lo&s;t. It is an happy law of nature therefore, that ble&s;sings are offered to our acqui&s;ition, not to our in|ert reception. And the nece&s;&s;ity of this labor originates all tho&s;e arts and improvements, which adorn &s;ociety, and call forth that beautiful variety of talents, which would otherwi&s;e lie concealed from human views. It is kind in Providence, that we &s;hould be obliged to labour, and it is the happy privilege of this nation, that indu&s;try receives every encouragement. It is a greater act of charity in the publick, both to the morals and enjoyment of individuals, to enable them to acquire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, than if it gave to their inactive wi&s;hes. And the &s;ame ob&s;ervation may ap|ply to acts of private charity; for an individual to enable another to acquire wealth for him&s;elf, rather than to give

In addition to tho&s;e wi&s;e laws, and &s;tatutary in&s;titutions for promoting indu&s;try in gener|al, we may con&s;ider the provi&s;ions that are made, and the funds that exi&s;t, for the general diffu&s;ion of &s;cience. The&s;e originated, in &s;everal of the &s;tates, with the fathers of this country, to who&s;e provident wi&s;dom for the welfare of their de&s;cendants we are indeed greatly indebted. Their literary in&s;titutions we have pre&s;erved; the happy effect of them has been, a great degree of intelligence through all ranks, mo&s;t highly favorable to the exi&s;tence of that li|berty which is found in republicks. While our higher &s;eats of literature prepare the ri&s;ing generation for the more important departments of community, the &s;ubordi|nate &s;chools of learning diffu&s;e &s;uch a portion of know|ledge, as &s;erves the purpo&s;e of enabling the people to &s;tudy, and value their privileges; and <HI>both united</HI> form one of the <HI>greate&s;t bulwarks</HI> of rational, civil, political, &s;ocial and religious liberty. And we ought not to be unmindful, that the&s;e in&s;titutions for the general diffu&s;ion of know|ledge among the lower ranks of the people, is a very &s;in|gular ble&s;&s;ing, in which we are privileged above all the na|tions of the world. While the&s;e continue to exi&s;t, de&s;pot|i&s;m and tyranny can never find &s;upport. The&s;e therefore, con&s;titute <HI>no little part</HI> of that greatne&s;s, to which we have been rai&s;ed by the &s;miles of HEAVEN.</P>
<P>We may next ob&s;erve, that we live in a nation, in which we are taught to &s;eek for our highe&s;t glory in the pro&s;peri|ty of all nations. The period has at length arrived, in which &s;uperior improvements in all liberal &s;cience has ve|rified what has been formerly taught <HI>only in the Chri&s;tian religion,</HI> that the true&s;t happine&s;s of the individual, or of the part, lieth in the pro&s;perity of the whole. Enlighten|ed policy and true Chri&s;tianity concentrate in the &s;ame ob|ject, and inculcate the de&s;ired felicity of the world: Per|haps, for this enlightened policy, we are originally indebt|ed to <HI>chri&s;tianity,</HI> though infidelity and dei&s;m are not wi|ling to acknowledge it. But that the fact exi&s;ts, witne&s;s the di&s;intere&s;ted exertions for general liberty, and &s;ocie|ties that are formed to patroni&s;e the abolition of general &s;lavery. How different this from the &s;pirit and di&s;po&s;ition of former ages and nations? Patrioti&s;m indeed has been anciently carried to a &s;urpri&s;ing height: but how illiberal the principle! A kind of love, which ju&s;tified the mo&s;t en|venomed hatred to foreign nations, a love as far removed from the enlarged principles of true benevolence, as the af|fection of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s towards tho&s;e who are its friends, from the philanthropy of a chri&s;tian, <HI>who loves his enemies, and prays for them that cur&s;e him.</HI> How great were the preju|dices of the Jew and the Greek? and among Chri&s;tian nati|ons,
<PB N="13" REF="025638_0012_0FCEAD3E6611F8C0">how common to find one people &s;eeking for national aggrandi&s;ement, on the reproach or ruin of another? The chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem has taught its di&s;ciples to view the world as a large brotherhood, and to exerci&s;e a benevolence as <HI>exten&s;ive as the creation of</HI> GOD. Late improvements in knowledge, whether acquired by &s;tudy, experience, or com|merce, have in a great mea&s;ure removed tho&s;e prejudices, which formerly exi&s;ted: and have taught us that chri&s;tian benevolence and enlightened policy are clo&s;ely united.</P>
<P>We may next ob&s;erve, that we live under a government in which there is exi&s;ting a great degree of equality among the people. In de&s;potick governments this would be very unfavorable to their <HI>exi&s;tence.</HI> Laws are therefore made, which will ever produce great inequalities among the peo|ple, in all nations which are not republican. By rea&s;on of the&s;e inequalities, it is very evident, that the enormous powers of a part of the community over the other, who are in many in&s;tances the mo&s;t meritorious, have been &s;o long &s;upported. In governments where the&s;e inequalities are maintained by law, it is not uncommon to find in the &s;ame family, one a nobleman, and another but a few de|grees above beggary; and all this for no other rea&s;on, but that the former happened to be the elde&s;t &s;on, and con&s;e|quently the heir of all the family honor, and wealth, and titles, and dignities. This law for the maintenance of in|equalities, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in monarchial governments, is a remnant of the ancient fendal &s;y&s;tem, but mo&s;t unju&s;t, and highly di&s;graceful to an enlightened age. A law &s;omewhat &s;imilar exi&s;ted in this &s;tate, which admitted the elde&s;t male to an equality with any two of his brethren, and that fre|quently to the manife&s;t injury of the family. But we are happy to find that law exi&s;ts no more. Inequalities, and extreme ignorance in the lower ranks, con&s;titute no little part of the policy of all de&s;potick governments, in which they originated, and which <HI>they only</HI> are intere&s;ted to &s;up|port, as the <HI>grand &s;ecret</HI> of monarchial exi&s;tence. In repub|lics, different principles are nece&s;&s;ary, and all that equali|ty that nature has made, except what may ari&s;e by &s;uperi|or indu&s;try, or the &s;pontaneous be&s;towments of a grateful people may render a propriety to exi&s;t, ought to be &s;up|ported.</P>
<P>We may next ob&s;erve, that we live in a land where the people are contented and happy. This is evident in the ge|neral emulation to excel in all tho&s;e u&s;eful arts by which their country may be benefitted, in their peaceable and quiet attention to their own and family intere&s;ts, by their veneration of the laws of the land, the few complaints of oppre&s;&s;ion and the &s;carcity of any event that has the ap|pearance of in&s;urrection. In the cla&s;s of the unhappy, we find but few, except tho&s;e reduced to mi&s;ery and wretched|ne&s;s,
<PB N="14" REF="025638_0013_0FCEAD40252FE5C0">by utter privation of all &s;ober principles, and a cour&s;e of licentious conduct. And no form of government can ble&s;s unprincipled minds. As to the &s;ober and worthy part of community, they eat the bread of indu&s;try, they la|bour, enjoy the benefit of their labor, and are happy. <HI>Few</HI> are there who know the wants of extreme poverty; <HI>few</HI> &s;o &s;traitened in their circum&s;tances, but can allow them&s;elves the proper &s;ea&s;ons of rejoicing with their friends, and cultivating the &s;ocial virtues; <HI>few</HI> but can obey the calls of humanity, and contribute for the relief of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. The poor of our land, and &s;uch the Savior &s;ays ye &s;hall al|ways have with you, will unite with us to venerate tho&s;e laws, by which provi&s;ion is made to prevent their extreme &s;ufferings, and the cla&s;s of tho&s;e who are in needy circum|&s;tances, will <HI>love</HI> a country, in which private charity is not a <HI>&s;tranger,</HI> and in which the poor of our land are fed with bread.</P>
<P N="2">2. The text inculcates a duty in con&s;equence of being thus highly favored by the &s;miles of HEAVEN. <HI>Take heed to thy&s;elf, and keep thy &s;oul diligently, le&s;t thou forget the things which thine eyes have &s;een, and le&s;t they depart from thy heart, all the days of thy life; but teach them thy &s;ons, and thy &s;ons' &s;ons.</HI> Our duty is fir&s;t, to be &s;en&s;ible that becau&s;e the LORD <HI>our</HI> GOD <HI>has been nigh unto us,</HI> we have been rai&s;ed to all that greatne&s;s, which our eyes have &s;een; and we are grateful|ly to remember from whom we have received all our privi|leges and ble&s;&s;ings. What the &s;ame prophet &s;pake to I&s;|rael, may be applied to us, <HI>Not becau&s;e ye are more righteous than any other people, but becau&s;e the</HI> LORD <HI>had a delight in your fathers,</HI> that this land has been given unto you, and that ye have had the LORD <HI>your</HI> GOD <HI>&s;o nigh unto you, in all that ye have called upon</HI> HIM <HI>for.</HI> Whence is it, that we have de|rived all this greatne&s;s, that we enjoy the greate&s;t liberty, and live under the mo&s;t righteous government, that we have the be&s;t laws in the world, and are free from every &s;pecies of oppre&s;&s;ion? Is it becau&s;e we have more wi&s;dom and power, and our princes, men who &s;ear GOD, been more highly illuminated, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of greater benevolence to the publick? The enquiry &s;till meets us, whence is all this? Surely "becau&s;e the LORD our GOD has been nigh unto us in all that we have called upon him for." What ingrati|tude, if our minds are not deeply impre&s;&s;ed with a realizing &s;en&s;e of the greatne&s;s of our obligations? But, my chri&s;tian auditors, there is one debt that we owe to GOD, compared to which all others are greatly le&s;&s;ened. This is the debt of gratitude for the gift of His SON, to ble&s;s the world with the light of the go&s;pel, by which we have received the mo&s;t pure and &s;ublime religion, and which, by giving more en|lightened &s;entiments of GOD, of human nature, and of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting truths, hath not only elevated the hopes of
<PB N="15" REF="025638_0014_0FCE9E5A13E95210">individuals, but hath greatly meliorated the governments of the chri&s;tian nations, diffu&s;ed a grater mildne&s;s and leni|ty in the complexion of the laws, the admini&s;tration of ju&s;|tice, and the manners of the people at large. The refine|ments of ancient Greece and Rome, though the boa&s;t of the enemies of our religion, were barbari&s;m compared to the civilization to which &s;ome chri&s;tian nations have attained. Witne&s;s the publick fea&s;ts in honor of the gods in the for|mer, and the <HI>unrobed</HI> combats and cruel &s;ports of the gladi|ators, putting each other to death merely for the entertain|ment of the people called <HI>refined,</HI> in the latter. When we recollect the great amelioration exi&s;ting in nations favored with the light of the go&s;pel, and the ju&s;t ideas it has given of GOD and man, of the world, its origin, de&s;ign and end, of the fall and recovery of the human race, of the great de|&s;igns of love re&s;erved for the virtuous, of a future king|dom to be realized in this world, before the con&s;ummation of all things, in which there is to be exhibited a perfect go|vernment, the mo&s;t righteous and benevolent laws, and a numerous people all happy in their obedience, we mu&s;t ac|knowledge this a ble&s;&s;ing that might with propriety draw from us the language of an apo&s;tle, who was enraptured with its greatne&s;s, <HI>"The length and breadth, and depth and height, and to know the love of Chri&s;t, which pa&s;&s;eth knowledge!" Here is love indeed. "Oh the depth both of the wi&s;dom and know|ledge of</HI> GOD!"</P>
<P>But while we gratefully acknowledge our obligations to the LORD <HI>our</HI> GOD, for that greatne&s;s to which we have been rai&s;ed, it is our duty to tran&s;mit the&s;e &s;entiments of gratitude and &s;en&s;e of obligation to po&s;terity. <HI>Teach them to thy &s;ons and thy &s;ons' &s;ons.</HI> While the untutored &s;avage "under the &s;hade of his plantain" teaches his children, who are hanging upon his lips for in&s;truction, the wondrous deeds of the fathers, &s;urely chri&s;tians ought with more pro|priety, to impre&s;s upon the minds of their de&s;cendants, tho&s;e more intere&s;ting truths which they have received, and the a&s;toni&s;hing events which have taken place in former days, becau&s;e <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>our</HI> GOD was nigh unto the fathers <HI>in all that</HI> they <HI>called upon him for.</HI> Thus &s;pake the prophet of GOD to I&s;rael. <HI>"And the&s;e words which I command thee this day, &s;hall be in thy heart. And thou &s;halt teach them dili|gently to thy children, and &s;halt talk of them when thou &s;itte&s;t in thy hou&s;e, and when thou walke&s;t by the way, and when thou lie&s;t down, and when thou rife&s;t up.</HI> Thus would the ri&s;ing gene|ration value the privileges which we &s;hall have tran&s;mitted them, and realizing the greatne&s;s of their obligations, will unite piety with their virtue and indu&s;try, in rearing to perfection the great temple of liberty, which was founded in the days of their fathers.</P>
<P>We may next ob&s;erve, that it is our duty to exert our&s;elves
<PB N="16" REF="025638_0015_0FCEAD42D50D8E90">for the continuance of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings which we have received. The time has been, when we thought the work fini&s;hed, and our happine&s;s as a nation perfected. We were carele&s;s, we were luxurious and idle. We were in debt to our friends, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted us in the day of trouble and the hour of blood, with their trea&s;ures; and to our breth|ren who had fought for us, who had bled, and many of whom had died, in their country's cau&s;e; we were at that time without any energetick &s;y&s;tem of national go|vernment, and the political affairs of this country had a very dark a&s;pect indeed: Yet for a time, the people were utterly regardle&s;s of the con&s;equences of their inactivity; indu&s;try had greatly failed, vice and indolence made rapid incur&s;ions, and we were inattentive to the fir&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary &s;tep for remedying greater evils, than we had ever before experienced. Nece&s;&s;ity and want at la&s;t reduced us to at|tention, and the provident wi&s;dom of the &s;ober and prudent part of the nation animated the people to indu&s;try, led them to &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of greater energy in the &s;eat of government, and we became united in e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem, which promi&s;es the continuance of tho&s;e high privi|leges, which we now po&s;&s;e&s;s. Still much is depending on our continued exertions. Look for a moment among nations, &s;ocieties and individuals, and we find this invaria|ble truth, that none flouri&s;h without diligence; that ble&s;|&s;ings acquired are not continued without indu&s;try, and that they, who&s;e circum&s;tances require unremitting exertion, are the happie&s;t people. It is not only true that diligence is nece&s;&s;ary for the continuance of our privileges, but it is a happy circum&s;tance, that thus it &s;hould be, for active en|joyments are the only real ones. Whatever ble&s;&s;ings are the fruit of con&s;tant indu&s;try, are the true&s;t riches. None are permitted to &s;it down idly at the fea&s;t of life, and long be happy</P>
<P>We may in many re&s;pects be &s;aid to contribute, accord|ing to our abilities, for the &s;ecurity of the ble&s;&s;ings we en|joy, and no one is to be excu&s;ed from ca&s;ting in his mite, to the great trea&s;ury of the national welfare.</P>
<P>Every hone&s;t and indu&s;trious man, who faithfully employs the talents committed to him by the Great Ma&s;ter of the world, and attends to that calling in life which is a&s;&s;igned him by Divine Providence, contributes a valuable portion to the publick good, &s;erves his GOD and his country, and will at la&s;t receive the reward of <HI>a faithful &s;ervant.</HI> All are not formed to act in the higher departments of life, neither could all be u&s;eful there. Infinitely various are the de|mands of the publick good, and the great variety of &s;tati|ons and employments in a civilized community are happi|ly adapted to call forth that amazing variety of talents, which GOD hath, in &s;uch wi&s;dom, di&s;tributed to his ration|al
<PB N="17" REF="025638_0016_0FCEAD45A3783B10">creatures, for all that beautiful &s;ubordination, which con&s;titutes no little part of the glory of this and the upper worlds. Here is then a large field, in which not only mul|titudes, but every talent is called forth for action. While the Great LORD and Ma&s;ter is walking forth, and behold|ing the inactive, his language is, "<HI>Why &s;tand ye here idle all the day.</HI>" The indu&s;trious man, while pur&s;uing that em|ployment to which he has been called, is not only benefit|ing him&s;elf and his family, but &s;ociety and the publick: but the idle or inactive, while injuring him&s;elf, his morals and his family, is robbing &s;ociety of its ju&s;t demands. He is placed as a man among men, endued with abilities to do good to his fellow creatures, and &s;ociety ju&s;tly re|quires him to be active and u&s;eful. What account can &s;uch render to their GOD or country? What &s;elf condemnation, in that awful cri&s;is of human exi&s;tence, when called by that VOICE, which none can refu&s;e to hear, and &s;ummoned to render an account for the improvement of that rea&s;on, and tho&s;e talents, with which they were inve&s;ted, in the day that they were &s;ent forth into &s;ociety, with this command to be active and u&s;eful? To benefit the Almighty we can|not; for if thou art righteous, what do&s;t thou give him? But we may do good, and merit from our fellow creatures; and the Savior has informed us, that in the great day of retribution, he will accept our &s;incere and well meant &s;er|vices to others, as if to Him. <HI>Ina&s;much as ye have done it to one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</HI></P>
<P>We may again ob&s;erve, that all wi&s;e in&s;titutions for the improvement of the human mind, for the education of the ri&s;ing youth, for the encouragement of the various arts, and the incitement of indu&s;try in general, are contributions to the publick good.</P>
<P>Every parent and head of a family may render impor|tant &s;ervices to his country. In an ancient country, &s;uch were taught to con&s;ider their children as rather belonging to their country, than to them&s;elves. In <HI>families</HI> it is that tho&s;e pious maxims, virtuous principles, and u&s;eful precepts are taught and inculcated, by which the ri&s;ing youth may fill their future &s;tations in life with dignity and every pro|priety. Here by the fo&s;tering care of a parent they are trained up for tho&s;e employments, by which they may &s;erve their country, and pre&s;erve and extend tho&s;e privileges, which have been tran&s;mitted to them by their ance&s;tors, as the mo&s;t valuable of earthly legacies. How important then is the charge committed to every head of a family? How <HI>va&s;t</HI> is the benefit which <HI>&s;uch</HI> may render their country, by forming their young and tender minds to u&s;efulne&s;s and vir|tue, and hereby rendering them ble&s;&s;ings to the world? But farther, <HI>here it is,</HI> that tho&s;e religious principles are la&s;t|ingly impre&s;&s;ed, by which infidelity and vice may receive
<PB N="18" REF="025638_0017_0FCEAD467B135638">an early check, and the ri&s;ing youth may learn by the ex|amples of their fathers whom they venerate, to revere the go&s;pel of the Savior, and by which they may finally take an active part with their ance&s;tors in the &s;ublime and bea|tific employments and entertainments of the world of glo|ry. <HI>Train up a child in the way he &s;hould go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</HI> And never was there a pious and virtuous maxim more invariably accompli&s;hed and realized.</P>
<P>We may farther ob&s;erve, that all endeavours to promote the pro&s;perity of others is a contribution to the publick good. <HI>If one member be honored, the whole rejoice with it.</HI> It ought to be in &s;ociety as in a family or a friendly circle, in which the whole body feel the pro&s;perity of the individual as their own. And it is as really a fact, that every happi|ne&s;s of an individual is, in its mea&s;ure, the felicity of the whole, as in the natural body that the whole &s;ympathize with the member. The virtuous man con&s;iders him&s;elf as a part of the community, and when he beholds the pro&s;peri|ty of others, or of his country, he lifts his eye to heaven, and thanks his GOD. The Divine Being has &s;o connected us with each other, that none can live or act without inter|e&s;ting community. The &s;in of the fir&s;t parent has tran&s;|mitted mi&s;ery through ages, and that not by the po&s;itive will of GOD only, but by the &s;ame law of connexion, which we now &s;ee exi&s;ting between the head of a family or com|munity and its members. On the contrary the virtue and u&s;efulne&s;s of individuals will be diffu&s;ed through the whole, and be tran&s;mitted to ri&s;ing generations.</P>
<P>We may next ob&s;erve, that the &s;upport of religion is a contribution to the publick good. By religion we do not intend to include any particular mode or form; for as the Savior &s;aid, <HI>The time cometh, yea is already come, that neither in this mountain, nor yet in Jeru&s;alem, &s;hall men wor&s;hip the Father: GOD is a &s;pirit; and they that wor&s;hip him, mu&s;t wor|&s;hip in &s;pirit and truth.</HI> Different modes will ever be mo&s;t edifying to men of different prejudices and educations. It &s;eems as if the Savior had de&s;ignedly omitted any particu|lar directions in this re&s;pect. Great were the prejudices he had to encounter in his di&s;ciples. But in&s;tead of u&s;ing force, he once ob&s;erved, <HI>Many things have I to &s;ay unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.</HI> But as to religion it&s;elf, the wi&s;dom and experience of ages have &s;ufficiently proved its near connection with the civil good. The ruler who fears GOD, mu&s;t have the confidence of his &s;ubjects; and the &s;ame religion, which teaches the &s;ubjects to revere their Creator, commands them to be good &s;ubjects of civil go|vernment, and to look upon the <HI>powers that be, to be ordain|ed of</HI> GOD; to be good members of &s;ociety, good neighbors, friends, parents, &s;ons, ma&s;ters, &s;ervants, and that <HI>every man,
<PB N="19" REF="025638_0018_0FCEAD4800677C30">wherein he is called, &s;hould therein abide with</HI> GOD. Religion alone, by giving &s;olemnity to an oath, is the very bond of civil &s;ociety. What would a &s;ociety be, in which the members had no fear of GOD before their eyes? How would the culprit laugh at the executioner, and all the &s;o|lemn pomp and in&s;truments of death, were it not for that fear of an unknown futurity, a Divine Legi&s;lator and Judge, which has not only more influence upon the human mind, than is frequently &s;uppo&s;ed, but is of <HI>more weight,</HI> in deterring from the greate&s;t of human crimes, than <HI>all the &s;olemn &s;anctions</HI> that were ever affixed to the laws of man. Hence the mo&s;t celebrated legi&s;lators have found it nece&s;|&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;y&s;tems of religion. But if tho&s;e religions, though filled with error, were nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;tability of empire, how much more the religion which came down from GOD, which exhibits the noble&s;t virtues, all exemplified by its Divine Author, and in which we are called to practi&s;e <HI>what&s;oever things are true, and hone&s;t, and ju&s;t, and lovely, and commendable, and ever to &s;tudy tho&s;e things that make for peace</HI> and love. How important is religion then, and that it be countenanced by all ranks, while the fathers &s;et the exam|ple, by leading their children to the temple of JEHO|VAH, to be early taught to adore the Great Benefactor of the world? The religion of the go&s;pel formerly gave us this land; the &s;ame religion &s;till pre&s;erves it for their chil|dren; and our elders and princes are &s;till venerable for their piety, while on the weekly &s;olemnities they are leading forward the tribes of I&s;rael to the mount of wor&s;hip, the &s;olemn a&s;&s;emblies, the temple of GOD. May this &s;pirit be cheri&s;hed by the ri&s;ing age. and may the temple and the prie&s;t, the altar and the victim, which have exi&s;ted for ages among unenlightened nations, never reproach a people, who may ju&s;tly glory in &s;uperior light and growing advan|tages. Let us never forget the religion of our fathers, the religion of Je&s;us, the bread of life, and the waters of life.</P>
<P>The whole plan of duty, and of our national pro&s;perity, greatne&s;s and happine&s;s in connection with it, are given us by JEHOVAN him&s;elf, and addre&s;&s;ed, by his prophet, to a ri&s;ing, flouri&s;hing commonwealth, like ours, in the &s;ame book from whence I have cho&s;en my text; and they are &s;ummed up in piety and obedience, in religion and virtue. The &s;uper&s;tructure of national happine&s;s and glory is &s;ure to ri&s;e upon &s;uch a foundation, and no other foundation can be laid, on which it can ari&s;e and find a permanent &s;tability. To &s;upport it in the way of impiety, unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, pro|fligacy, political arts, cunning and wickedne&s;s, is ab&s;urd and &s;elf-&s;ubver&s;ive. It is an incon&s;i&s;tency in nature, repug|nant to the wi&s;e, holy, great and good plan of providence, and therefore the Almighty will frown with indignation
<PB N="20" REF="025638_0019_0FCEAD498016FEB8">upon it. In this divine plan, the duties of piety are of the highe&s;t order, and take place of all others. <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>a|lone mu&s;t be exalted</HI> by us, as the object of our &s;upreme wor|&s;hip, and of our be&s;t affections. We mu&s;t cultivate the love &amp; fear of the LORD our GOD, who has been nigh unto our fa|thers, and unto us their children, with the highe&s;t venera|tion of his being and perfections, providences, word and works. The athei&s;t is unfit for human &s;ociety, and to be a member of civil community; for he di&s;believes the being, omni&s;cience and power of GOD, to whom the appeal is made as THE WITNESS OF TRUTH, AND THE AVENGER OF PERJURY. Neither is the dei&s;t greatly &s;uperior, who de|nies a revelation atte&s;ted by miracles, which none can di&s;|prove, and one of which extorted from the lips of a centu|rion, pre&s;iding at the execution of Je&s;us, this confe&s;&s;ion&mdash; "Surely this was a righteous man."&mdash;MIRACLES ALONE PROVE A REVELATION.</P>
<P>We may farther ob&s;erve, that another important duty which we owe to GOD, our country and our&s;elves, is fer|vent prayer for the peace and pro&s;perity of our Jeru&s;alem. <HI>Pray for the peace of Jeru&s;alem: they &s;hall pro&s;per that love thee. Peace be within thy walls, and pro&s;perity within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions &s;ake, I will now &s;ay, peace be within thee.</HI> By this we &s;hew a realizing &s;en&s;e of our obliga|tions and dependence on that GOD from whom we have re|ceived our ble&s;&s;ings; and in this way we may hope to &s;e|cure the great love which HE hath exhibited to a highly favored land.</P>
<P>My chri&s;tian brethren, let a view of the divine goodne&s;s excite us to rejoice in exi&s;tence; but particularly that we had our exi&s;tence in a land of light and liberty, political and religious. Exi&s;tence it&s;elf is a ble&s;&s;ing; but how much greater, to be a&s;&s;ured that there is a divine government, and that goodne&s;s and benevolence pre&s;ide over the uni|ver&s;e? If this be &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing, how much greater to be your&s;elves a part of that highly favoured people, who have had the LORD their GOD near unto them in all that they call upon HIM for? But if this be a ble&s;&s;ing that adds to the happine&s;s of our exi&s;tence, how much more is it heightened by the con&s;ideration, that our exi&s;tence will ne|ver cea&s;e, and that the wi&s;e and virtuous, who improve their privileges, their rea&s;on talents, and opportunities for do|ing good to their fellow creatures, and their country, &s;hall not only forever live, but be forever advancing in beatific knowledge and happine&s;s, in the contemplation of divine objects, and a va&s;t and infinite plan of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and a&s;toni&s;hing wi&s;dom and benevolence, till the whole &s;oul be wrapped up in GOD; and the radiant glory of the SUPREME GOOD &s;hall &s;o entirely <HI>ab&s;orb</HI> the univer&s;e of virtuous &s;emis, that there will be but <HI>one</HI> great object, <HI>one</HI> will, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> de&s;ire,
<PB N="21" REF="025638_0020_0FCEAD4B24381C28">and <HI>one</HI> end of <HI>every</HI> mind through the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"></HI> With this view <HI>what a ble&s;&s;ing indeed is our exi&s;tence!</HI></P>
<P>Let this view of the Divine Goodne&s;s lead us to imitate what we &s;o much love and admire in GOD. His omnipo|tence, his univer&s;al pre&s;ence, and tho&s;e great and a&s;toni&s;h|ing events which have &s;urpri&s;ed the world, and been ac|knowledged the effect of Power Divine, can only be admir|ed and prai&s;ed; but we may be Godlike in goodne&s;s; and <HI>this</HI> is that attribute in GOD, which, among all his perfecti|ons, <HI>crowns</HI> the whole with &s;uperior glory. If we are ca|pable, this is a &s;ufficient indication that thus GOD willeth.</P>
<P>Let a view of the Divine Goodne&s;s to our&s;elves, and our country, lead us to adore and prai&s;e the LORD our GOD, <HI>who has been &s;o nigh to us in all that we have called upon Him for.</HI> There is &s;carce any power or faculty in human nature, but what may find a re&s;emblance, though in a lower degree, in the animal world. But do we differ from them only in de|gree? No, there is one faculty in which we differ in kind, and are e&s;&s;entially &s;uperior. This is our capability of knowing and re&s;embling the Creator, and adoring his be|nevolence. This is the &s;uperior glory of man. At the clo&s;e of the fifth day's work of creation, GOD beheld his works, and pronounced them good; but lo! there was none found capable of knowing and adoring their Creator. Then JE|HOVAH &s;pake, <HI>LET US make man.</HI>&mdash;Man alone he beheld among all his works capable of knowing his goodne&s;s, and on behalf of all creation, animate and inanimate, as their common prie&s;t, capable of rendering thank&s;giving and prai&s;e; and <HI>He &s;aid, Let them have dominion.</HI></P>
<P>But while the Divine Goodne&s;s to our favored land leads us to adore Him as on this day, let it al&s;o &s;erve to &s;hew us the nature of national vice and di&s;obedience to that GOD <HI>who has been &s;o nigh unto us.</HI> What are our &s;ins, but a vio|lation of tho&s;e laws, by which alone as a people, or as in|dividuals, we can ari&s;e to real greatne&s;s? The law is good as well as holy. Never did an individual, much le&s;s a peo|ple, attain to true and permanent pro&s;perity by vice and want of allegiance to the government of the Supreme Le|gi&s;lator. Thus a prophet, in the name of GOD, addre&s;&s;ed a once cho&s;en people; <HI>Oh! that thou had&s;t hearkened to my commandments; then had thy peace been like a river, and thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> as the waves of the &s;ea.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My brethren,</HI> We are this day called to rejoice in the Divine goodne&s;s: to rejoice in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of HEAVEN on our country, on the labors of our hands, and for the nume|rous comforts of family, of &s;ocial and private life. As a te&s;timony of our rejoicing, we are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> day bringing our <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"></HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"></HI> before the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, for a grate|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters"> acknowledgment of His bountiful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> Let the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> of this day be a rational, manly, grateful and re|ligious
<PB N="22" REF="025638_0021_0FCEAD4C98FF9110">joy&mdash;a joy that elevates and improves the mind, while it gladdens the heart.</P>
<P>What a &s;uitable &s;ea&s;on is this to make the hearts of our fellow-creatures around us, particularly of the indu&s;trious and virtuous poor, to rejoice with us, and that as far as lieth in our power, there be no &s;orrowing foul; but that <HI>&s;ighing and tears he wiped away,</HI> by our exerci&s;e of that chri&s;|tian charity and benevolence, which our holy religion re|quires. Thus your prayers and your alms, your thank&s;|giving and your good works, your joy and your labors of love would <HI>a&s;cend up for a memorial before</HI> GOD. This would be the rejoicing of benevolence, a Godlike affection! a joy that would make us better, as it makes us happier. Thus <HI>would our light break forth as the morning, our righteou&s;|ne&s;s go before us, and the glory of the</HI> LORD <HI>would he our re|ward.</HI></P>
<P>But in the mid&s;t of our rejoicing this day, as is natural to every grateful mind, remember our brethren or friends who as a nation or &s;ociety may be filled with fore di&s;tre&s;s, are contending for the privileges we enjoy, or are expo&s;ed in property, liberty and life to the mo&s;t imminent dangers. Such is the &s;ituation of an allied European people, who, in the days of our di&s;tre&s;s, generou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted us, and openly be|friended the cau&s;e of this country again&s;t our enemies. They are now emerging from darkne&s;s far greater than ours, to behold the light of general liberty. The true re|ligion, accompanied with the knowledge of it, which hath for ages been concealed from the commonality, and which, when known, has ever been found favorable to univer&s;al li|berty, is now beginning to break forth, its principles to he diffu&s;ed, particularly tho&s;e which re&s;pect the rights of hu|man nature, and bids fair to emblazon &s;peedily the whole European nations. But they are only ari&s;ing as yet. Great and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing will probably be their conflict with the wrath of united tyrants, who look forward with terror and di&s;may to the approaching fall of de&s;poti&s;m, before tho&s;e liberties and privileges that we enjoy will be e&s;tabli&s;hed in that nation. Through what &s;eas of blood have they been already obliged to wade in pur&s;uit of this high object! but the price is not e&s;teemed too great for a ble&s;&s;ing dearer than life. While we &s;ympathize with them in their di&s;|tre&s;s, we ought particularly to lament, that it &s;hould be, or be thought, nece&s;&s;ary to exile or &s;acrifice any, who were once highly valued by them, at the &s;hrine of liberty; any who have been holden in the highe&s;t e&s;timation in this country, and who&s;e names are yet dear to almo&s;t every American. This however ought not to prevent our benevolent wi&s;hes for the pro&s;perity of that cau&s;e, which, as it is the <HI>cau&s;e of human nature,</HI> a cau&s;e which the more it is inve&s;tigated by every nation, the more it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be befriended; a cau&s;e which
<PB N="23" REF="025638_0022_0FCEAD4EB3B57CE0">as it involves in its con&s;equences the liberty and happine&s;s, not of a nation, or an age, but <HI>of ages and nations to come,</HI> we have every rea&s;on to believe that GOD will e&s;pou&s;e it as <HI>His cau&s;e</HI> and crown it with &s;ucce&s;s. The &s;un of liberty a|ro&s;e in the we&s;t, and its light is rapidly diffu&s;ing to the ea&s;t; and &s;aith the holy prophet, "wrapp'd into future times," <HI>They &s;hall fear the name of the LORD from the we&s;t, and his glory</HI> &s;hall extend to <HI>the ri&s;ing of the &s;un.</HI></P>
<P>But there are brethren and friends &s;till nearer to us; al|lied not by treaty, but by nature; bone of our bone, and fle&s;h of our fle&s;h, whom we &s;hould remember this day, in the mid&s;t of grateful rejoicing under the &s;miles of HEAVEN. They lived with us, but they have gone from us, to take their future re&s;idence in the di&s;tant parts of this land, where they are now expo&s;ed to the depredations of a mer|cile&s;s enemy. While we are rejoicing, they are perhaps this moment trembling under momentary uncertainty and perpetual danger. How in&s;ecure their lives and property! how often are their hou&s;es <HI>wrapp'd in flames,</HI> their wives and children taken by brutal violence, without regard or pity to age or &s;ex, and led to long captivity, or put to a cruel death? The father leaves his family in the morning in peace, goes forth to his labors in the field, returns in the evening to gladden a dependent family; but alas, the &s;ad rever&s;e of fortune! Let imagination paint the &s;cene which has been often realized.</P>
<P>That grateful joy in the bounties which we receive, and which we are this day enjoying, in the plea&s;ant &s;ociety of our families and friends, without any enemy to mole&s;t or make us afraid, &s;hould remind us of our brethren who once &s;at with us. This is but natural to a grateful and a gene|rous heart. Thus, while we are &s;itting around the table, and partaking of the gifts of Providence, how common is it, to remember &s;ome ab&s;ent friend or relation, who filled a now vacant &s;eat on the former anniver&s;ary day? With the &s;ame propriety we ought this day to remember our breth|ren in di&s;tre&s;s, and to rai&s;e a &s;ympathizing heart and eye to the throne of grace, that the <HI>Father of love</HI> would protect them, and &s;oon enable them to &s;it under the <HI>peaceful vine.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, let us this day remember our fellow creatures here and el&s;ewhere, who may be in affliction. Let our hearts be filled with benevolence equal to our joy. <HI>Let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> break every yoke a&s;under,</HI> and do our endeavours for the peace, liberty and happine&s;s of all our fellow creatures. Then <HI>while the</HI> ALMIGHTY <HI>looketh down with a frown</HI> on the remaining iniquity of an highly favored land, HE <HI>may turn an eye</HI> to our deeds of charity and benevolence, with a countenance beaming with de&s;igns of infinite love.</P>
