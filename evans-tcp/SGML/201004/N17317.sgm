<HEAD>A SUPPLEMENT TO THE ESSAY ON MONIES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not pretended that the foreign coins are accurately rated in the Pamphlet on Monies. Preci&s;ion in this ca&s;e is of but little con&s;equence in a publication, by a private per&s;on, which holds out intimation rather than in&s;truction; and it remains with government to a&s;certain preci&s;ely the valuation of foreign coins.</P>
<P>What would be the tendency of rating foreign coins at more or le&s;s, in cents, than their exact current value abroad? I wi&s;h you to pau&s;e on this que&s;tion,&mdash;weigh the probable con&s;equences. To me it &s;eems that <HI>more</HI> of cents would induce an importation of coin in lieu of goods.&mdash;Goods, which, if imported, would be u&s;ed luxuriou&s;ly: but they would pay cu&s;toms to the public, which the coins would not. The money imported would, however, invigorate commerce and enterprize. In proportion, as money abounds in the country it will dimini&s;h in its importation from foreign parts: and goods, imported, will increa&s;e in the like proportion, in return for our exports. What will the politician think of the con&s;equences of a great influx of luxuries in this ca&s;e? Tho&s;e luxuries are not to be prohibited; but an increa&s;e of impo&s;t, on them, and a proper drawback on a re-exportation may be a whole&s;ome mea&s;ure. The le&s;s frugal Planter &s;ays&mdash;"I am for <HI>under|rating</HI> foreign coins, as an encouragement to the bringing in more goods." This gay countryman &s;peaks not from motives of national good: he would have an abundant
<PB N="2" REF="022368_0004_0FB859434E5407A0">influx of goods that he may buy them cheap, however ruinous to the merchant, and that then, beyond the &s;upply of nece&s;&s;aries and comforts, he may riot in luxuries. There are tho&s;e, of other cla&s;&s;es of people, who would <HI>over-rate</HI> the foreign coins from the like motive, a little of &s;elf-gratification,&mdash;all are but men. The merchant, al&s;o for him&s;elf, wi&s;hes to &s;ee foreign coins valued, in cents, preci&s;ely <HI>according to their current value abroad;</HI>&mdash;becau&s;e, when there is no overbearing influence applied for bia&s;&s;ing the rates of money the one way or the other, it will a&s;&s;i&s;t commerce to &s;eek, with it&s;elf, its own level, as doth water, until they &s;ettle, in uni&s;on, into an equal and unabating &s;tream of employment and wealth to the nation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;omewhere well &s;aid, that&mdash;<HI>"The riches of a nation depend on the number of its inhabitants WELL EMPLOYED."</HI> "Riches" may here be under&s;tood to imply the means of national health, vigour, and happine&s;s.&mdash;What are nations,&mdash;what is man, without <HI>employment!</HI> Employ|ment, by the will of God, drowns evil thoughts&mdash;gives health and peace of mind&mdash;the comforts of life, and orderly manners and affections.</NOTE> It is not meant but that the great repre&s;entative may and ought, and therefore will interfere when nece&s;&s;ary for curbing enormities which oppo&s;e fair trade, or the intere&s;ts of the nation or of commerce in general: but, a free government will be cautious not to di&s;turb the natural current of monies and trade, le&s;t they be driven to countries unu&s;ed to check their better inclination.</P>
<P>The Writer of the E&s;&s;ay on Monies &s;ubmitted the name, "Dollar," again&s;t his own judgment. It was not an e&s;&s;ential, and the Congre&s;s in 1785 had adopted it. He conceived, that denomination was not &s;o proper as &s;ome definite or original term would be. There are dollars of various countries and values: and it threatens to be an inconveniency, that within the United States there &s;hould be monies of Spain, worth 108 cents, of a 50 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> dollar, and
<PB N="3" REF="022368_0005_0FB85944D3B2A210">at the &s;ame time monies of the country, of the <HI>&s;ame denomination,</HI> worth but 100 cents, (at mo&s;t 105 cents) from whence may ari&s;e &s;ome uncertainty in dealings and in conver&s;ations, when "dollars," indefinitely, are expre&s;&s;ed. A ha&s;ty bargain is made for 100 "dollars." What, before a jury, are the&s;e dollars? Before judges of the &s;uperior courts, they are declared to be dollars of the United States: before judges in by-places, there may, in practice, be &s;ome little latitude taken for declaring them to be the one or the other:&mdash;Inclination, &s;ometimes, has a powerful influence over judgment. If we &s;ay, "Fleece dollar"&mdash;or "Con|gre&s;s"&mdash;or "Federal dollar," in either ca&s;e it is a com|pound and prolix term. If called a "Fleece"&mdash;&s;o of an "Eagle," the term is indefinite. "Dollar," however, is familiar to the people: Are the variety of dollars and their re&s;pective values al&s;o familiar to them?&mdash;A contract is made to pay 1000 dollars: the hand writing of the defendant is well proven; but there is no proof of the place where the contract was made, or for what dollars: in fact, it was made at the Havana, and pieces of eight rials, of Spani&s;h money, were meant; yet judgment is rendered, in our courts, for dollars of the United States, of the value of 100 cents, whereas the plaintiff ought to have been paid dollars of 108 cents: &s;o that he lo&s;es 80 dollars of his ju&s;t due.</P>
<P>In valuing Spani&s;h pieces of eight, it may be noted that nearly all, now in circulation, are of CHARLES III, and that the&s;e dollars are inferior to dollars of the former Kings of Spain, both in weight and finene&s;s:&mdash;the old, more perfect dollars of Spain, are for ever gone. The medium weight of 13 Mexican pieces of eight of CH. III, was 416&frac13; grains. Har|ri&s;on's London prices current, for May 1784, make all the pieces of eight &s;ell at 5 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 2&frac12; <ABBR>d.</ABBR> an ounce; except the new dollars of Spain, which were at 5 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 1&frac12; <ABBR>d.</ABBR> &s;o that the pieces of eight of CH. III, are worth but 53 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> 15/100, or 106 cents, 3 mills, of a 50 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> dollar; when the old dollars are worth 54 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> nearly, or 108 cents. The proportions of fine &s;ilver and of alloy in the pieces of eight of CH. III, may be di&s;covered by calcu|lation
<PB N="4" REF="022368_0006_0FB8594653EB6D20">on the value of them <HI>at market.</HI> They there &s;ell lower than other Spani&s;h pieces of eight as 61&frac12; to 62&frac12; in the ounce. It may be pre&s;umed, the acute dealers, in bullion, procured that new money to be nicely a&s;&s;ayed at the mints, for a&s;cer|taining its purity, before the price was &s;et at market.

<P>Portugal money of account is in rees and mill rees:&mdash;1000 rees are a mill ree. They are &s;eparated by dotting off three figures from the right or unit &s;ide: &s;o that 2000 and 4000 are 2.000 M. R. and 4.000 M. R. The coins of that nation have their value expre&s;&s;ed on them in figures; and there are coins impre&s;&s;ed with 20000, meaning &s;o many rees or 20 mill rees. Fifty-four pence &s;terling are of the value of 800 rees. Likewi&s;e the Spaniards impre&s;s on their pieces of eight the figure 8, meaning thereby eight rials; from whence the name "piece of eight."&mdash;Will American coins be marked in figures with their value in cents?</P>
<P>Although Congre&s;s divided monies of account into dollars, dimes, cents, and mills, which is a very excellent divi&s;ion, and the principle will be retained, yet it probably will happen in practice, that accounts will be kept in dollars and cents, with the fractions of cents called mills; Do. 368 C. M. 98.9. that is 368 dollars, 98 cents, 9 mills; or Do. 368. C. M. 98.9. in one column: or, it may be, according to the Portugal method, 368.989, which are &s;o many dollars and mills; for, 1000 mills are one dollar, as 1000 rees are one mill ree. There is, I believe, no money of account &s;o manageable,
<PB N="5" REF="022368_0007_0FB85948D7D8BC80">by the accountant, as tho&s;e of the United States of America, and Portugal:&mdash;To me the method of dollars and mills appears the be&s;t: 234 Do. 906 M., or 234,,906.&mdash;If I am to &s;ettle accounts with people who u&s;e all the different methods, it is quite as ea&s;y to me as if we all were in one and the &s;ame method: my 234.906 are by dots at once &s;hifted into 234 Do. 9 Di. 06 M.&mdash;234 Do. 90 C. 6 M., or into 23 E. 4 Do. 90 C. 6 M.; yet tho&s;e people cannot quite &s;o ea&s;ily throw theirs into my denominations. But until the denominations of monies of account and coins are confirmed or altered, it may be well to keep our accounts in cents alone, as there is the lea&s;t probability of a change in this name.</P>
<P>It may be con&s;idered, whether the declaring that "French and Briti&s;h coins &s;hall pa&s;s current in payment of all debts and contracts for money," will not be improper; as they are generally &s;o worn as to fall greatly &s;hort of their weights and value. French crowns, of the commercial &s;tandard, ought to weigh 464&frac12; grains, to be worth 5 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> &s;terling, or 120 cents: yet, what are in circulation, average only about 447 grains, equal to 4 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 9&frac34; <ABBR>d.</ABBR> or 115<ABBR>C.</ABBR> 5<ABBR>M.</ABBR>&mdash;Engli&s;h crowns are &s;carcely an object&mdash;there are none in circulation&mdash;Engli&s;h &s;hillings are as tra&s;h&mdash;20 of them, taken at random, averaged but 8&frac12; <ABBR>d.</ABBR> &s;terling. or 17 cents. The laws of tho&s;e countries make it penal to &s;end their national ca&s;h abroad. Among&s;t the <HI>commercial</HI> nations, perhaps, the motive for this pro|hibition,&mdash;exclu&s;ive of the con&s;ideration of heavy charges to their nation, on expen&s;ive coinages often repeated, is not with the de&s;ire of locking it up from circulating in other countries; becau&s;e, the more free and exten&s;ive it circulates the better are its purpo&s;es an&s;wered. A &s;y&s;tem of commerce, which carries out <HI>money,</HI> will bring <HI>bullion</HI> home.&mdash;Countries the riche&s;t in commodities, neverthele&s;s, require bullion in many branches of their commerce: and as the monies of all other nations are, to them, but bullion, whil&s;t they have an influx of it &s;ufficient for their purpo&s;e, the quantity of
<PB N="6" REF="022368_0008_0FB8594C5BA7A2B8">their national money needs not be &s;o great as otherwi&s;e would be requi&s;ite; and then expen&s;ive coinages are le&s;&s;ened. Britain &s;eems to have greatly declined in coining <HI>&s;ilver,</HI> from this principle,&mdash;nor do I know that &s;he has coined any &s;ilver for many years pa&s;t, of any con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Gold may be preferred to &s;ilver, for our national money, at lea&s;t for awhile, as the coinage of it is con&s;iderably cheaper than of &s;ilver. Spani&s;h &s;ilver coins, together with the gold of Spain and Portugal, may be tendered in payments: at the &s;ame time, a moderate &s;um of national &s;ilver ought to be always in circulation, together with our gold coin to a larger amount, as bullion gold &s;hall happen to come into the mint. It would, re&s;pecting the public, be improper to give currency to foreign coins by a perpetual or long continued law: more|over our citizens would be &s;ubject, by &s;uch laws, to great impo&s;ition from a depraved coinage, which could be pro|duced at the will of the foreign &s;overeign,&mdash;and it might injure our commerce and the commonwealth in general. If the foreign nations &s;hould be di&s;plea&s;ed with &s;uch a public act as might &s;eem to give encouragement to the drawing away their monies from them, which at great expence were coined for their own u&s;e within their own dominions, and not for the purpo&s;es of &s;trangers,&mdash;commerce, in de&s;pite of oppo&s;ition, will counteract the views of &s;uch complaints, and perhaps defeat all the means that government could rea&s;onably apply for an&s;wering the expectation of the com|plainants: for if in &s;uch ca&s;e the foreign coins are left to their own bias, to follow in the train of commerce, they will become, or continue current by common con&s;ent; and there will pre&s;ently be a &s;ufficiency of national money for the purpo&s;es of formal tenders in controverted ca&s;es: under which circum&s;tances, the municipal laws which gave cur|rency and force to tho&s;e coins, may be repealed, or not, as &s;hall then appear advi&s;eable. If nothing forbids, &s;ilver car|ried to the mint to be exchanged for national coin, may be paid for in gold, free of all expence, lo&s;s, or delay. The co&s;t on the coinage of the gold will be about 3 per cent. to
<PB N="7" REF="022368_0009_0FB8594DDB1A27F8">the States: Tho&s;e who carry bullion gold to the mint, will, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, al&s;o receive its value in national gold or &s;ilver coin, clear of expence or lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t money of the Banks, whether it be in paper or bullion, and Spani&s;h coins are current as is the national money, by con&s;ent through the influence of commerce, although they be not money known to the municipal law, and therefore not a &s;ubject of tender, all the purpo&s;es of a foreign commerce are an&s;wered by them, and al&s;o mo&s;t of the inland demands; &s;o that formal tenders, which mu&s;t be in national money; being very few, a le&s;s quantity of the national coin &s;uffices. Spani&s;h money is not liable to the objections made above, re&s;pecting the Engli&s;h and French crowns:&mdash;it is but little wore. The portion of it which pa&s;&s;es through our hands, is &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed over Europe or &s;unk in India:&mdash;the ab&s;ence whereof is yearly renewed, from the mines of new Spain, with a coin that is fre&s;h and perfect: &s;o that, if the States &s;hould think it proper, until trade is more favourable to us, and we can afford to coin more largely, the act may be, that until &s;uch a time (the year 1800) Spani&s;h milled and coined monies, and Portugal gold, &s;hall pa&s;s current in payments within the United States of America.</P>
<P>If the devices on the American coins, &s;hall generally be of &s;ubjects of great national concern, the Printing Pre&s;s is a candidate for a place among them&mdash;Vehicle of Science&mdash;Prop of Liberty!</P>
<P>However mi&s;taken may be the principles of this Piece, it perhaps will promote one good&mdash;Thought, with inve&s;ti|gation, on a &s;ubject particularly intere&s;ting at this time.</P>
