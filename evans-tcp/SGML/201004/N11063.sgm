<HEAD>ADDRESS TO THE INHABITANTS OF NORTH-AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P>AS it has been thought requi&s;ite, by a continental a&s;&s;ocia|tion, to put a &s;top to the importation of manufactures into America, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to fall &s;peedily on &s;ome effectual method to furni&s;h, at lea&s;t, the coar&s;e&s;t articles of our cloathing.</P>
<P>OUR country produces <HI>wool, cotton, hemp</HI> and <HI>flax,</HI> mate|rials amply &s;ufficient to an&s;wer every demand of nece&s;&s;ity and convenience. The quantity may be increa&s;ed by attention and diligence, and wrought up with a degree of &s;kill ea&s;ily attainable.</P>
<P>WE &s;ee already many families, &s;cattered throughout the&s;e provinces, almo&s;t entirely cloathed in their own home-&s;pun manufactures; why therefore &s;hould any of us de&s;pair of ac|compli&s;hing that which is actually practi&s;ed, before our eyes, by &s;o many?</P>
<P>BY beginning with coar&s;e manufactures we &s;hall begin at the right end, we &s;hall, every &s;ucceeding year, improve upon the pa&s;t, and, after a fair exertion of the means in our power, we &s;hall look back, with wonder and a&s;toni&s;hment, at our pre&s;ent apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="014022_0004_0F92ADF35B87FD28">
WE mu&s;t now exert our&s;elves in manufactures, or, from an unconquerable indolence, be driven to the ba&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t humiliating conce&s;&s;ions, conce&s;&s;ions that others may di&s;po&s;e of our lives, liberties, and properties, at their plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>WHEN every thing valuable to men is thus at &s;take, the author claims the privilege of a citizen, and entreats the at|tention of the public, to a &s;ubject of &s;o great con&s;equence to this country as that which is now &s;ubmitted to their con&s;ide|ration. It is no le&s;s than a certain, cheap and ea&s;y method of &s;upplying, internally, the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and con&s;iderable parts of or cloathing.</P>
<P>A GREAT increa&s;e of the quantity of wool may gradually be effected, by a general pur&s;uit of the means recommended by the congre&s;s; but, as it will require much time before a &s;uffi|cient quantity, for every purpo&s;e, can be obtained, it is appre|hended the inconvenience may be, in a great mea&s;ure, obvi|ated, by blending it, for mo&s;t u&s;es, with another material, which may be ea&s;ily procured in the utmo&s;t plenty.</P>
<P>COTTON may be rai&s;ed, in many parts of the&s;e colonies, with &s;ucce&s;s; and, being u&s;eful in all, the cultivation of it ought to be encouraged in tho&s;e places where the climate and &s;oil are favourable, with a view of not only an&s;wering their own exigencies, but al&s;o in quantity &s;ufficient to &s;upply their neighbours, who have not the &s;ame advantages.</P>
<P>THOSE who have attempted the manufacture of linen in this country, have generally made it of <HI>flax,</HI> and have been greatly di&s;couraged, from frequent di&s;appointments in their expectations of a crop: <HI>Flax</HI> &s;own, even on our be&s;t and fre&s;he&s;t lands, is often &s;carce worth the &s;aving. The &s;can|tine&s;s of the crop is, doubtle&s;s, &s;ometimes owing to bad hu&s;bandry; but, where there are &s;o many in&s;tances of its fail|ing,
<PB N="5" REF="014022_0005_0F92ADF494245388">under the utmo&s;t attention and diligence, it is fairly pre|&s;umable, that the want of &s;ucce&s;s is, generally, owing to &s;ome other cau&s;e than mi&s;management.</P>
<P>IN Zealand, along the &s;hores of the Baltick, particularly about Riga, in Scotland and Ireland, and in &s;ome parts of Flanders, where the greate&s;t quantities of <HI>flax</HI> are rai&s;ed, we are informed, that, even in the&s;e northern countries, it thrives only upon deep, moi&s;t, &s;tiff, clayey, or loamy &s;oils; and that the province of Zealand, which con&s;i&s;ts, almo&s;t entirely, of wet, heavy, low, clayey land, is remarkable for producing the be&s;t <HI>flax</HI> of any part of Europe; whil&s;t the gravelly, lighter &s;oils produce <HI>flax,</HI> fine, indeed, in quality, but in very &s;mall and uncertain quantities. And in tho&s;e countries they have double, perhaps treble, the moi&s;t drizzling weather that we have in the&s;e colonies, though not &s;uch heavy &s;howers, or the &s;un &s;o parching as with us.</P>
<P>SUCH of our lands, only, as are fre&s;h, rich, deep, and &s;trong, and have a low, moi&s;t &s;ituation, can give rea&s;onable hopes for a tolerable crop of <HI>flax;</HI> and even on the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">|vourable &s;pots, we know from experience, that the &s;ea&s;on mu&s;t continue moi&s;t and warm; for, if it proves dry, which oftene&s;t happens, the <HI>flax</HI> is &s;eldom worth the pulling, either for its &s;eed or bark.</P>
<P>WEEDS, which are de&s;tructive to all crops, are more e&s;pe|cially &s;o to <HI>flax,</HI> which &s;uffers greatly from them, in its good|ne&s;s as well as quantity; nor is it ab&s;urd to conceive, that weeds and dry weather &s;hould prove the bane of this crop, when we reflect that, from its fir&s;t &s;hoot it continues a con&s;i|derable time very weak and low, its leaf &s;mall and narrow, affording &s;carce any &s;hade, leaving the ground expo&s;ed to the powerful action of a &s;corching &s;un, which exhales and dries up
<PB N="6" REF="014022_0006_0F92ADF8DB31F5B8">the moi&s;ture &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of the <HI>flax,</HI> and pu&s;hes into vegetation the &s;eeds of much hardier plants.</P>
<P>FROM experience, then, we have rea&s;on to de&s;pair of rai&s;ing flax in &s;ufficient quantities to an&s;wer all our demands. Our climate is not moi&s;t and dropping enough, and our &s;oil, in ge|neral, is too &s;andy and dry, to rely on <HI>flax</HI> entirely, or indeed principally.</P>
<P>A TOTAL neglect of <HI>flax</HI> is not intended to be recom|mended; where it &s;ucceeds tolerably, let the rai&s;ing of it be continued, but the author hopes to be able to &s;how, that, where the cultivation of <HI>flax</HI> cannot be carried on to advan|tage, HEMP may be &s;ub&s;tituted in its room, and will effectually an&s;wer, e&s;pecially in coar&s;e manufactures, every purpo&s;e to which <HI>flax</HI> hath been applied. Indeed nothing but a total ignorance of the very great ea&s;e, advantage, and certainty, with which HEMP may be rai&s;ed, and of its mo&s;t valuable pro|perties, could &s;o long have prevented it from becoming gene|rally cultivated for dome&s;tic purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>BENEFICENT nature, which has made this plant &s;o u&s;eful, hath al&s;o mo&s;t indulgently fuited it to almo&s;t every <HI>climate,</HI> as well as to every &s;ort of <HI>&s;oil;</HI> for we find it rai&s;ed in &s;o many countries of Europe, as well as in America, lying under &s;uch different latitudes, that it, mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly, may be cultivated, with great advantage, from the &s;hores of Florida to the banks of St. Laurence.</P>
<P>UNDOUBTEDLY one climate, or &s;oil, may &s;uit this plant better than another; <HI>this</HI> colony may produce better HEMP for <HI>linen,</HI> whil&s;t <HI>that</HI> produces better for the rope-walk: For though, on &s;trong, fat, cold grounds, the HEMP may be &s;tronger and fitter for &s;ome purpo&s;es, yet we may be a&s;&s;ured, that &s;uch HEMP as grows on a light, dry, well cultivated &s;oil, even if it doth not grow &s;o high, or &s;trong, will be fitter to an&s;wer our dome&s;tic
<PB N="7" REF="014022_0007_0F92ADF9D98E86B8">wants. We may therefore rea&s;onably imagine, that, in tem|perate climates, our own for in&s;tance, e&s;pecially in the lower parts of the&s;e provinces, and of the &s;outhern colonies, where the lands in general are light and warm, they are properly adapted to rai&s;e this plant to the greate&s;t perfection.</P>
<P>A MOST peculiar advantage attending the culture of this plant is, that it may be repeatedly &s;own on the &s;ame piece of ground, experience having &s;hown that any dry land, &s;o that it is properly prepared with <HI>manure,</HI> will produce much heavier crops than the riche&s;t fre&s;h lands, and that the &s;ame piece of ground, a&s;&s;i&s;ted with a moderate quantity of <HI>manure,</HI> will ad|mit of being &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;own, probably to the end of time, without any diminution of crops.</P>
<P>HOW ea&s;y therefore is it in every man's power to prepare, even on the meane&s;t land, a portion of ground &s;ufficient to rai&s;e what is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply, at lea&s;t, his family wants? It will not require a fourth, perhaps not a tenth of the ground nece&s;&s;ary to produce an equal quantity of <HI>flax.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE heard of three hundred and a half of clean broken <HI>flax</HI> rai&s;ed from one acre, but we commonly put up with near a third le&s;s, and e&s;timate that as no bad crop.</P>
<P>FRESH lands, &s;own with HEMP, will produce from four to eight hundred of clean broken HEMP; old ground, duly pre|pared, will yield, according to the &s;ea&s;ons, from half a ton, to twelve or fourteen hundred on the acre. I know a piece of upland, which has been &s;own with HEMP, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, for at lea&s;t ten years pa&s;t, produce, in a favourable &s;ea&s;on, at the rate of twenty-four hundred per acre; &s;o powerful are the effects of a proper cultivation!</P>
<P>HEMP al&s;o produces a mo&s;t certain crop, it being by no means &s;ubject to tho&s;e accidents to which <HI>flax</HI> is expo&s;ed, from the uncertainty of &s;ea&s;ons; rain, it is true, is nece&s;&s;ary at the
<PB N="8" REF="014022_0008_0F92ADFBECCB8780">time of &s;owing, and it will indeed be &s;omething extraordinary if there doth not happen, during the cour&s;e of ten weeks, (for &s;o long the &s;ea&s;on for &s;owing HEMP continues) a &s;hower &s;uffi|cient for this purpo&s;e; for its vegetation is &s;o quick, that, in a very few days after it is &s;own, its leaves entirely cover and &s;hade the ground, protect it from the &s;corching &s;un, enable it to retain the moi&s;ture, and prevent the &s;eeds of the common weeds from &s;prouting. From this time the dews alone will prove &s;ufficient to bring it to perfect maturity, and, indeed, heavier crops are produced on ground highly manured, in dry &s;ea&s;ons, than in over wet years.</P>
<P>THE more we con&s;ider the nature and properties of HEMP, and reflect how happily it is adapted to our climate and &s;oil, the more rea&s;on there is to wi&s;h that the inhabitants of the&s;e colonies would avail them&s;elves of its advantages.</P>
<P>IF we had not this invaluable plant to rely on, we ought <HI>now</HI> to bend our attention to manufactures; but, with it, after a trial, we &s;hall mo&s;t certainly find it our intere&s;t to continue making our coar&s;e linens, notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t perfect harmony &s;hould be again re&s;tored between Great-Britain and America; for, as the greate&s;t part of the coar&s;e <HI>linens</HI> that hath been con&s;umed in the&s;e colonies the&s;e many years pa&s;t, hath been imported from foreign countries, and there pur|cha&s;ed for our u&s;e, and paid for in &s;pecie by the Briti&s;h mer|chant, a pro&s;ecution of this manufacture would not interfere with the intere&s;t of our mother country.</P>
<P>THE ba&s;is of the mo&s;t u&s;eful manufactures is, with us, full as certain as in any other part of the world, and the gro&s;s materials are excellent, and procured in plenty with very little labour. Provi&s;ions are good, plenty, and cheap; either ad|vantage would be &s;ufficient encouragement, in any other country, to begin manufacturing.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="014022_0009_0F92ADFC567EB290">
THE manufacturers, who in Great-Britain are now ar|rived to &s;uch a pitch of &s;kill and dexterity, were once as ignorant in the arts of manufacturing as we are at pre&s;ent. They had rivals and difficulties far greater than ours to en|counter, but their indu&s;try and per&s;everance have &s;urmounted every ob&s;tacle; why then ought we to de&s;pair of attaining a &s;ufficient degree of facility in working up the&s;e coar&s;er materials, where &s;o little art and &s;kill will be wanted? We cannot pretend to rival Great Britain in &s;uch manufactures as require much time, a&s;&s;iduity, and attention to bring to perfection; nor is this a di&s;advantage to us: Satisfied in our pre&s;ent <HI>infant</HI> &s;tate, with manufacturing tho&s;e articles that are mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for pre&s;erving our exi&s;tence, we can <HI>yet</HI> employ our hands to better advantage in rai&s;ing and ex|porting a variety of produce, &s;ufficient to pay for the&s;e &s;uper|fluities which we want in return from the mother country, which will turn to the mutual advantage of both.</P>
<P>THE goodne&s;s, and con&s;equently the real value of the coar&s;e&s;t manufactures, depends principally on the quantity of the finer part of the material of which it is compo&s;ed, rather than the workman&s;hip; in this we &s;hall have a &s;ingu|lar advantage, for we can afford a much greater proportion of the fine part of the material, in our coar&s;e linens, than can be afforded in Europe, where the clo&s;e working the ma|terials con&s;titutes a great part of the profit.</P>
<P>NOTHING is wanted but the countenance, example, and encouragement of people of influence; and docility, atten|tion, and indu&s;try in the poor.</P>
<P>INSTEAD of the number of negroes among&s;t us being, as imagined by &s;ome, an impediment to manufactures, they might ea&s;ily be made very u&s;eful, in forwarding the work; they mu&s;t do as directed, and even &s;lavery it&s;elf, we find, in
<PB N="10" REF="014022_0010_0F92AE00CA7E5720">numberle&s;s in&s;tances, has not extingui&s;hed their &s;pirit to excel.</P>
<P>HUMANITY and the intere&s;t of the ma&s;ter bid us treat the female negroes with lenity and indulgence, at lea&s;t during their pregnancy, and whil&s;t they are &s;uckling their chil|dren, in the latter univer&s;ally, and often in the former &s;tate, they are too feeble to labour con&s;tantly in the field: Had they not better, for them&s;elves and ma&s;ters, at &s;uch times be employed in &s;pinning?</P>
<P>WE have generally a good deal of weather in winter when little or nothing can be done in the field; our evenings are long, and labouring people in Europe imploy the hours before bed time in working on &s;ome manufacture; we have many white, as well as negro children, who have &s;trength and ad|dre&s;s enough to &s;pin, wind yarn, pick wool, cotton, &amp;c. though now, becau&s;e not able to labour in the field, kept en|tirely idle. If the young and the weak, and, in the winter evenings and bad weather, when they cannot labour out, all the working hands were employed in dre&s;&s;ing, &s;pinning, and weaving HEMP into coar&s;e linen, what family need purcha&s;e imported o&s;nabrigs?</P>
<P>BY a proper di&s;tribution of our time, and employing the almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s and burthen&s;ome parts of our families, e&s;pe|cially where there are a number of negroes, the bu&s;ine&s;s of the plantation or farm may go on as profitably as at pre&s;ent, and the nece&s;&s;ary coar&s;e cloathing be fabricated at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>MANUFACTURES cannot be carried to perfection in an in&s;tant, nor was planting or farming, yet this country has made great advances lately in the latter, nor has any country, with half the advantages of this, failed in the former.</P>
<P>ARTS, manufactures, and commerce, only, can &s;upport mul|titudes of people, in a narrow compa&s;s, and numbers will not
<PB N="11" REF="014022_0011_0F92AE02E2E11F78">be wanting where the&s;e are cultivated with vigour and pro|priety; nor are proofs wanting of the amazing effects of in|du&s;try when &s;upported and encouraged by liberty; for wherever there is employment and protection for people, there will population thrive.</P>
<P>WE are certainly now in a &s;ituation to make a beginning; when we can &s;upply our&s;elves with coar&s;e &s;ub&s;tantial cloathing, our hands will become more numerous, both from our natural increa&s;e, and emigrations from Europe, and we &s;hall advance towards perfection by degrees; but what is mo&s;t wanted &s;hould be fir&s;t fully accompli&s;hed; by &s;uch means, and &s;uch only, can we become populous or truly rich.</P>
<P>IT is a certain fact, though not attended to, that the landed intere&s;t will be mo&s;t benefited by &s;uch improvements; the value of land depending &s;olely on population, and ri&s;ing or falling as the people are numerous or otherwi&s;e; the landed gentlemen ought, therefore, as well for their own intere&s;t as that of the public, to be a&s;&s;iduous in forwarding manufactures, and con&s;equently population.</P>
<P>PREMIUMS, or per&s;onal encouragement, to &s;uch as may de&s;erve well, together with bounties judiciou&s;ly propo&s;ed, might be of &s;ingular u&s;e in promoting improvements, and the manufacture of linen in particular; their good effects have been wonderfully felt in Scotland, and in Ireland, by the dint of which the linen manufacture, in both kingdoms, has been brought to the greate&s;t perfection, and has proved of the ut|mo&s;t advantage to both.</P>
<P>THE true intere&s;t of a &s;tate is not always to in&s;i&s;t upon too uncommon perfection in its fabrics; that manufacture, for which there is the greate&s;t demand, ought always to be pro|moted in preference to any other, and, as we want larger
<PB N="12" REF="014022_0012_0F92AE031D8DB068">quantities of coar&s;e than of fine linens, the encouragement &s;hould be directed to that end.</P>
<P>A MANUFACTURE, thus di&s;per&s;ed and encouraged, will in|&s;inuate it&s;elf into every family, and, from its natural con|nexion with agriculture, it &s;eems peculiarly adapted to the country, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily concur with it in increa&s;ing po|pulation, and prove a &s;ource of many advantages to the&s;e colonies.</P>
<P>CONSCIOUS that, in the following e&s;&s;ay, little is advanced but what has re&s;ulted from experiments, the author can there|fore, with the greater confidence, &s;ubmit it to the impartial public; from the importance alone of the &s;ubject he pre&s;umes to engage their attention, for, deficient as he is in point of abilities, and little accu&s;tomed to writing, he claims no merit but that of wi&s;hing to do his duty; far from flattering him&s;elf that he has exhau&s;ted a &s;ubject &s;o intere&s;ting, and &s;o exten&s;ive, he will think him&s;elf happy if his weak efforts &s;hall contribute to excite men of greater abilities to take under their con&s;idera|tion a &s;ubject, from the cultivation of which &s;uch great and important advantages will, mo&s;t probably, be derived to the community.</P>

<HEAD><HI>An</HI> ESSAY <HI>on</HI> HEMP.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> A De&s;cription of the Plant.</HEAD>
<P>HEMP is commonly di&s;tingui&s;hed into two &s;orts, one that grows wild, the other produced by cultivation; this latter is male and female in different plants, the male, bearing the flower, is commonly called <HI>fimble hemp,</HI> and the other, bearing the &s;eed, <HI>karle hemp.</HI></P>
<P>THE root of HEMP, produced by cultivation, is from three to eight inches long, according to the quality of the land, and the quantity of &s;eed &s;own thereon. It is of a whiti&s;h colour, undivided and running to a point, having fibres only on two lines, exactly oppo&s;ite to each other, when not &s;trait|ened for want of room. The &s;talk is round, from the root for &s;ome little way up, it then a&s;&s;umes a fluted quadrangular form, is hollow, covered with a greeni&s;h bark, compo&s;ed of filaments; this bark, as it appears upon the &s;talk, forms a knotty, rough, or prickly covering to it. The&s;e knots and prickles are mere excre&s;cences of gum, which &s;erve to glue the fibres of the bark together, and to cover, &s;trengthen, and protect them, till they arrive at full maturity; at proper di&s;tances, this bark is &s;ecured, from place to place, by &s;ix &s;mall fa&s;tenings, which keep it clo&s;e to the &s;tem, like &s;o many little nails ranged on the circumference of the &s;ame circle.</P>
<P>ITS length and thickne&s;s are various, owing to many diffe|rent cau&s;es. A grain of <HI>hemp-&s;eed,</HI> &s;own by it&s;elf in a &s;oil that agrees with it, commonly produces a &s;talk large and firm, with many branches, and looks like a little tree. If it is of
<PB N="14" REF="014022_0014_0F92AE091E48CAD8">that &s;ex which produces the &s;eed, it will yield a great number of grains, and tho&s;e very good; but its bark, being too hard and coar&s;e, is only fit for the rope-walk: on the contrary, the due quantity of &s;eed, &s;own in a field that is properly prepared for the purpo&s;e, produces &s;talks that are &s;treight, &s;lender, without branches, and the bark of &s;uch, being &s;mooth, fine, and &s;oft, is valuable for many other u&s;es. The leaves grow two and two oppo&s;ite to one another, they are divided into many &s;egments, being oblong, &s;harp pointed, jagged, full of veins, of a deep green, rough to the touch, and of a &s;trong &s;mell, that affects the head.</P>
<P>THE flowers, that grow on the male &s;talk, i&s;&s;ue from the <HI>aloe</HI> of the leaves, are of a purple colour without, and whiti&s;h on the in&s;ide; the&s;e flowers are not followed by any &s;eed; and, on the contrary, the &s;eed, on the &s;talks that produce it, is never preceded by any flower.</P>
<P>WHATEVER the order of nature may be in the vegetation of this plant, both the male and female &s;talks are produced indi&s;|criminately from the grains of &s;eed that grow on the &s;ame &s;talk: and the difference cannot be known till they come to blo&s;&s;om.</P>
<P>THE &s;eed grows, in a great number of bunches, at the end of the &s;talk and branches; this, when come to maturity, forces the membranous cap&s;ulae, or outer hu&s;ks, which contain it, to open, and di&s;cover a round &s;mooth grain, &s;omewhat flattened, containing, under a thin &s;hell, of a &s;hining light grey colour, a white tender kernel; this kernel is enclo&s;ed in a green film, or thin covering, and con&s;i&s;ts of two lobes that terminate in the germ, from which proceeds both the root and bud of the future plant. Its &s;ub&s;tance is &s;weet to the ta&s;te, of a &s;trong &s;mell when fre&s;h; of a fat, &s;pongious, gummy or oily matter; being very porous, or open, it mo&s;t readily re|ceives the impre&s;&s;ion of heat and humidity, which tran&s;mit to

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the land proper for <HI>HEMP;</HI> and the methods of preparing the ground.</HEAD>
<P>IT is an opinion generally received, that HEMP can only be rai&s;ed on &s;uch lands as are <HI>naturally</HI> the be&s;t and riche&s;t; this being a crop that requires a great deal of &s;u&s;tenance, there is no doubt but that it certainly may be rai&s;ed on &s;uch lands to mo&s;t advantage, yet experience hath demon&s;trated, that HEMP is one of tho&s;e plants which may be cultivated in many different &s;ituations, and in almo&s;t every different &s;oil, no plant yielding, in our climate, a crop more certain or more advan|tageous.</P>
<P>RICH, dry bottom lands are tho&s;e where HEMP has hitherto been principally rai&s;ed among&s;t us; but rich &s;wamp well drained, high lands, either loamy or light, &s;o that they are rich and made mellow, will all, in their natural &s;tate, bring this plant to great perfection.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is mo&s;t probable that this plant may be cultivated, to great advantage, on &s;uch dry mar&s;hes as are, either, from their natural &s;ituation, or by means of drains and banks, out of danger from inundations. This is but conjecture; however, as there are in every creek and bay con&s;iderable quantities of mar&s;h, it certainly would be worth the trouble for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors to give it a fair trial, by having it properly broke up and thoroughly rotted; &s;hould the hemp fail, it could be laid down in gra&s;s to great advantage.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="014022_0016_0F92AE0AB8C831A0">
THOUGH mo&s;t &s;ituations are &s;uitable for HEMP, yet, as it requires a va&s;t quantity of nouri&s;hment, and in a few crops exhau&s;ts the riche&s;t &s;oil, the land intended for it ought not only to be the be&s;t that can be procured, but, to in&s;ure a good crop, a quantity of <HI>manure,</HI> proportioned to the quality of the ground, ought to be added; for experience &s;hews us, that lands highly manured amply repay every extraordinary trouble and expence of this kind, by producing double the quantity that is u&s;ually rai&s;ed on the riche&s;t lands in their natural &s;tate.</P>
<P>IT may therefore be mo&s;t advi&s;able, for tho&s;e who propo&s;e to cultivate this plant, to &s;et apart a piece of level land, not too low, far le&s;s a wet &s;ituation, but convenient and be&s;t adapted to be improved. This piece of ground ought, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of manure and other compo&s;itions, to be as highly prepared as po&s;&s;ible; when this is once accompli&s;hed, a very little dre&s;&s;ing will be requi&s;ite to keep it in proper tilth, and it will then admit of being &s;own without any diminution of <HI>crops.</HI></P>
<P>A DEEP light mould, which gives freedom for the fibres to pa&s;s every way, is ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite for HEMP, but at the &s;ame time warmth is &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, that it will grow better in a poorer &s;oil, that is warm and mellow, than in a very rich one that is cold and wet. For which rea&s;on, &s;and becomes a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential ingredient in HEMP grounds, and therefore, rich, light, dry &s;oils ought to be preferred.</P>
<P>THOSE lands which are of a deep, black, or du&s;ky loams, as they con&s;i&s;t of a proportion of &s;and, with a large quantity of pure mould, will be ea&s;ie&s;t, and be&s;t cultivated.</P>
<P>STIFF or clayey lands, though they may not be &s;o ea&s;ily cultivated in the beginning as the poor &s;andy lands, yet, after they are once prepared by labour and proper <HI>manure,</HI> will be ea&s;ily kept in order, as they will require le&s;s <HI>manure,</HI> and la&s;t much longer than the very poor &s;andy &s;oils, which, from their
<PB N="17" REF="014022_0017_0F92AE0B56BB65A0">texture, are but ill calculated to retain the manure; therefore, when this &s;ort of &s;andy land is intended for HEMP, that this wa&s;te of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts of the manure may be pre|vented as much as po&s;&s;ible, it will be proper that its nature be changed by means of &s;uch bodies or compo&s;itions as will tend be&s;t to effect this purpo&s;e, for which clay is peculiarly u&s;eful, and particularly &s;o when half burnt, or mixed with lime, which conveys fertility, and corrects the bad qualities of the clay, by rendering it more friable, or its parts more ea&s;ily di&s;|united, and therefore the more readily mixed with the &s;and.</P>
<P>THE &s;ea ow&s;e, that is the &s;ettling of the tides on the &s;hores between high and low water mark, is an excellent manure for loo&s;e &s;andy &s;oils; the cleanings of ponds and ditches, as they con&s;i&s;t of the putrid animal and vegetable bodies, mixed with the rich earth depo&s;ited there by rains, &amp;c. becomes likewi&s;e here of con&s;iderable benefit: The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the mud in rivers, and creeks or bays, where, by the &s;tagnation of the water, the rich particles of the &s;oils carried down by the floods, have time to &s;ub&s;ide. But of all correctors or alteratives for &s;andy &s;oils, none is preferable to <HI>marl,</HI> where it can be had. In &s;hort, all bodies or compo&s;itions, which tend to give con|&s;i&s;tence or &s;tability to the &s;oil, are proper in this ca&s;e; for, by intermixing tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tance with the &s;and, its nature becomes changed from a &s;andy to a loamy &s;oil, in which &s;tate it is better calculated to retain the manure, which it may be afterwards nece&s;&s;ary to give it, as the nutritive particles thereof will nei|ther be &s;o readily wa&s;hed thorough, nor exhaled by the influ|ence of the &s;un.</P>
<P>WHEN lands which incline to be clayey or &s;tiff are intended for HEMP, they ought to be well broke up, and then thrown up in ridges, as high and narrow as po&s;&s;ible, which may be mo&s;t readily done with a good plough, by throwing one furrow to the
<PB N="18" REF="014022_0018_0F92AE0C2F1E3D98">back of another, and this work ought to be done in the fall, before the fro&s;t &s;ets in; the benefit that will ari&s;e from this operation is too con&s;iderable to be neglected; in this &s;ituation the glebe is be&s;t expo&s;ed to the action of the following &s;ea&s;on, the rains, the &s;nows, and fro&s;ts of winter penetrate to the center, thereby opening and di&s;&s;olving its parts, by which much of your future labour will be abridged, for, when this method has been executed properly, and in time, the ground will be mellow and in good order.</P>
<P>THOSE, who may not be furni&s;hed with ploughs fit for this purpo&s;e, ought to have the ground well dug over with the &s;pade, or the hoes, and either thrown up into ridges, as before directed, or into high narrow hills, &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the fir&s;t hoeing for tobacco.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the &s;evere &s;ea&s;on is over, in February or March, the ground may be levelled, which is &s;oone&s;t and be&s;t done by running an iron toothed harrow once or twice over it; &s;oon after this it ought to be ploughed over, though, immediately be|fore it is ploughed, the <HI>manure</HI> you intend to put upon it &s;hould be carried out and &s;pread. This point of time is to be pre|ferred, as the nutritive particles, with which the <HI>manure</HI> abounds, will have full opportunity to be &s;ufficiently di&s;&s;olved and blended with the &s;taple, before they can &s;u&s;tain any di&s;&s;i|pation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>manure,</HI> or compo&s;t, when laid on at this time, &s;hould be well rotted or mellow; it will then be in &s;uch a &s;tate as to mix freely with the &s;oil; if the dung is new, it will be far better to plough it down in the fall.
<P>Stable dung, rotten wood, &s;aw-du&s;t, tanners bark, a&s;hes, the dung of &s;heep, hogs, pigeons and poultry, are excellent <HI>manures</HI> for &s;tiff land; as cow dung, rotten wood, the bottoms of wood pits and rotten tanners bark are &s;uitable for lighter &s;oils. Dung, which has been blended with other ingredients, and mixed toge|ther where it could lie &s;ecured from the weather until it becomes mellow and rotted, is far preferable to that which is fre&s;h.</P></NOTE> From this time, it may lie till the &s;ea&s;on for &s;owing arrives, when it is nece&s;&s;ary to plough it again, not only that
<PB N="19" REF="014022_0019_0F92AE0E82A97CF0">&s;uch weeds as may have &s;prung up may be ploughed down, but that the dung may be more equally blended with the earth. If this ploughing &s;hould not bring your ground into proper tilth, for it is requi&s;ite that as few clods be left as po&s;&s;ible, and that your field be light and loo&s;e as may be, it will be proper to run the plough through it once more, though, before it re|ceives this ploughing, it is advi&s;able to have the lumps, or clods fir&s;t broken in pieces, either with a wooden mallet with a long handle, or with the eye of the hoes.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the proper &s;ea&s;on for &s;owing <HI>HEMP.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ea&s;on for &s;owing this &s;eed rarely begins &s;ooner, in our part of the country, than the beginning of May, the weather &s;eldom being &s;ettled till then, and continues till about the middle, or even the la&s;t of June. However the time of &s;owing ought to vary, according to the difference of weather which is often times very con&s;iderable in the &s;ame province, and even under the &s;ame latitude, the &s;pring proving later as we leave the ocean, and approach towards the mountains.</P>
<P>IT may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that as the HEMP which is fir&s;t &s;own, provided it does not meet with any accident, mo&s;t commonly, yields the heavie&s;t crop, tho&s;e lands which are high or dry &s;hould be &s;own as &s;oon as the &s;ea&s;on will permit, provided they are in order; tho&s;e which are low or moi&s;t, as they often cannot be got in order &s;o &s;oon as the uplands, may lie a little later. It is however by no means eligible to &s;ow this &s;eed, till you can rea&s;onably expect that no danger is to be ap|prehended from the fro&s;t; nor is it, by any means, proper to &s;ow when the ground is very <HI>dry,</HI> or that there is an appearance
<PB N="20" REF="014022_0020_0F92AE0F37189570">of a continuance of dry weather, in either of the&s;e ca&s;es, it will be far more prudent to delay the &s;owing for a little, until the &s;ea&s;on is more advanced, or proves more mild and favourable; for HEMP &s;own, e&s;pecially on upland, when the ground is dry, or the weather cold, &s;eldom proves good unle&s;s rain happens to fall immediately. In &s;hort, as the &s;ucce&s;s of your crop, in a great mea&s;ure, depends upon the &s;tate of the weather at the time of &s;owing the &s;eed, attention ought to be given to &s;eize the mo&s;t favourable &s;ea&s;on, and, as it has been ob&s;erved that early &s;own HEMP generally thrives be&s;t, provided that the &s;ea|&s;on does not prove too untoward, it is therefore prudent to have the ground made ready by the time that the weather is expected to &s;et in mild and &s;ettled; the fir&s;t opportunity ought then to be taken to &s;ow the &s;eed, either immediately before a rain, or as &s;oon after as the ground will admit; &s;ow|ing before the &s;hower ought to be preferred, only becau&s;e the &s;eed will be covered much better and more equally when the ground is dry, than when it is wet: immediately before &s;ow|ing, the ground mu&s;t be laid level with the harrow, and the be&s;t and quicke&s;t method of covering the &s;eed is, either with a &s;hort toothed &s;ingle harrow, or a bunch of bru&s;h, which ought to be dragged once or twice over the land, and, directly after, a wooden roller of about fifteen or eighteen inches diameter ought to be run over it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A wooden roller, of fifteen or &s;ixteen inches diameter, by means of a box fixed on the frame, may be encrea&s;ed to any weight, by loading the box with &s;tones.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the <HI>SEED,</HI> with the quantities proper to be &s;own.</HEAD>
<P>THE u&s;ual quantity of HEMP, where the hemp is intended for the rope-walk, &s;eldom exceeds one bu&s;hel on the acre, which is rather too little, for, where the land is in tole|rable tilth, not le&s;s than one bu&s;hel and a half of good &s;eed ought to be put on each acre; but, when HEMP is intended for dome&s;tic purpo&s;es, there ought not to be le&s;s than two bu&s;hels of &s;eed on each acre, and when the land is perfectly good and mellow, two bu&s;hels and an half, or even three bu&s;hels, will be found a far better proportion. Upon the whole, an allowance mu&s;t be made for the difference of &s;oils equally well laboured; a good &s;oil will afford nutriment for a large quantity of &s;eed, and bring the plants to the utmo&s;t per|fection, whil&s;t a like portion of &s;eed would dwindle on a poorer &s;oil. Upon land which is highly cultivated, and in the be&s;t order, even the above quantity of three bu&s;hels may be ex|ceeded, without any detriment, or diminution to the crop, and often with great benefit.</P>
<P>IN recommending the above quantity of &s;eed, it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be good, clean, and fre&s;h, for none but &s;eed of the la&s;t crop ought to be u&s;ed, provided &s;uch is to be had; when this can|not be obtained, &s;eed of two years, though not &s;o good, may
<PB N="22" REF="014022_0022_0F92AE10CD43B8B0">be tried, and if it has been well cured, and carefully pre|&s;erved, may chance to &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>IT is an ea&s;y matter, for tho&s;e acquainted with this plant, to di&s;tingui&s;h good &s;eed from bad; when the &s;eed &s;eems light, with a number of white and greeni&s;h coloured grains among&s;t it, which, when cracked, are found either entirely empty, or to contain but a &s;mall &s;hrivelled kernel, it is not to be depend|ed upon: on the contrary, that &s;eed which is heavy, of a bright grey colour, and when cracked appearing full of a white tender kernel, is a&s;&s;uredly good, provided that the male or flower plants were not drawn out till the proper time, this al&s;o may be known from a careful examination of the kernel, for if the &s;eeds have been duly impregnated by the <HI>farina,</HI> or du&s;t from the flower, the germ, or future plant, will appear to an accurate ob&s;erver, particularly with the aid of a magnifying gla&s;s, lying with its bud between, and a little tendril, which pierces the ground to form the root, running along the two lobes of the kernel; however, the be&s;t and rea|die&s;t method to know the quality of the &s;eed, is to &s;ow a &s;mall quantity on a border of light good earth, and from the num|ber that &s;prings up, the goodne&s;s of the &s;eed may be very nearly a&s;certained.</P>
<P>THE u&s;ual method of &s;owing this &s;eed is by broad-ca&s;t, but, in whatever way it is done, all imaginable care mu&s;t be ob|&s;erved to di&s;tribute the &s;eed as equally over the ground as po&s;|&s;ible: and as all kinds of birds, but more particularly pigeons and turtle doves, are remarkably fond of this &s;eed, and will, if they are permitted to frequent the ground, de&s;troy great quantities of it, even during &s;ome few days after it is &s;prung up; it is nece&s;&s;ary to keep them off until it has gathered &s;trength,

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the time of pulling, and the different methods of watering and rotting <HI>HEMP.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN about &s;ix or eight weeks after &s;owing, according as the &s;ea&s;on has been more or le&s;s favourable, the plant which bears the flower begins to blo&s;&s;om; &s;ometimes this happens when the plant is not much above two feet high; the HEMP, when this is the ca&s;e, &s;eldom grows much higher, but conti|nues weak; this may be owing to different cau&s;es, but it mo&s;t commonly proceeds either from the weakne&s;s of the ground, or from the HEMP having been &s;own in dry cold weather. At other times it ri&s;es to the height of four, and oftener five feet before it blo&s;&s;oms, and grows greatly after. The plant which bears the flower u&s;ually ri&s;es above that which produces the grain, and, by the time that it gets in blo&s;&s;om, is generally &s;everal inches above it.</P>
<P>THIS &s;uperiority, in the order of nature, may be well ac|counted for, when we con&s;ider, that the powder which i&s;&s;ues from the flower of the male, &s;erves to convey fertility to the grain on the female &s;talks that produce the &s;eed. When the HEMP gets in full bloom, the flowers are loaded with the <HI>farina</HI> or du&s;t in &s;uch abundance, that, upon the fir&s;t impre&s;|&s;ion of the morning breeze, it appears like a fog, or a cloud of &s;moke floating over the HEMP field.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="014022_0024_0F92AE12478FB6F8">
AS &s;oon as this phaenomenon begins to di&s;appear, and the blo&s;&s;om to drop, the HEMP is at full maturity, and we may im|mediately begin to pull it.</P>
<P>THIS is be&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t done when the ground happens to be tolerably dry. When you begin to gather the HEMP, it will be expedient that each per&s;on employed clear before him as many feet of ground as the HEMP is high, in order that, after pulling it up by the roots, and beating off the earth that &s;ticks to them, by &s;triking the roots again&s;t his foot, he may conveniently &s;pread it on the ground from whence he has pulled it, where it mu&s;t lie until it is quite dry; it is then to be tied up in bundles, and put under &s;ome cover, or carefully &s;tacked in the ground, in which ca&s;e it mu&s;t be well thatched with &s;traw, to prevent any wet from getting to it. Under this &s;helter it remains till about the middle of November, when it is &s;pread out to rot; it is laid out in rows, taking care that it is &s;pread &s;o thin as that it may get equally wet, and dry nearly alike; it will be prudent to &s;pread it out in &s;ome inclo&s;ure, for example on winter grain, that it may not be mole&s;ted by the hogs or other animals; from this time it generally lies till towards the beginning of February, and &s;ometimes a month later, before it is fit to be taken up, this however depends on the weather; &s;hould the winter prove moi&s;t and open, and the HEMP happened to meet with &s;ome &s;howers whil&s;t it lay out to dry when it was pulled, in that ca&s;e it may get rotted by the la&s;t of December or middle of January. The proper time for taking it up may ea&s;ily be known by cracking a few of the &s;talks, or breaking a handful in the brake, and, if the bark is found to &s;eparate readily from the &s;tems, the HEMP ought im|mediately to be taken up, which mu&s;t however be done in clear weather, that the HEMP, when lifted, may be as dry as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="014022_0025_0F92AE144BD0DB48">
WHEN it is intended that the HEMP &s;hould immediately be put through the brake, it is commonly &s;et up in the field in &s;mall parcels, the root end down, gathering them together and binding them at the top, in which po&s;ition it is not apt to get injured, till the weather turns warm; but when it is not con|venient to brake it directly, it &s;hould be put under cover, &s;o as to be entirely &s;afe from the weather.</P>
<P>THIS is the method generally u&s;ed in this country, in place of watering, and is called <HI>winter rotting.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN HEMP is intended to be watered, it is tied with the &s;hort HEMP rather towards the upper end, in &s;mall bundles as it is pulled, &s;etting up about &s;ix bundles in a parcel, root end down, &s;preading them wide at the bottoms, but pre&s;&s;ing them clo&s;e at the tops; in three or four days, if the weather is good, it will be dry enough to put into the water, where it lies &s;eldom le&s;s than nine days, but oftentimes before the ope|ration is effected, ten or twelve days; warm weather forwards the watering, and cold retards it; however, as the &s;ooner that the watering is effected there is the le&s;s danger of the HEMP being hurt, it is better to put the HEMP into the water as &s;oon as may be after it is pulled, and whil&s;t it is yet green; in this &s;tate it &s;eldom or ever requires to be longer in the water than five days, but it ought to be ob&s;erved, that this is in Augu&s;t, our month for pulling, when the weather is generally at the warme&s;t.</P>
<P>BEFORE placing the HEMP in the water, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to take care that the bundles have not been made too large, and that the HEMP is tolerably even at the roots, and, when the HEMP happens to be very tall, it will be proper to bind it with a &s;ingle &s;talk or two near to the roots, as well as near the top; care however mu&s;t had not to bind it too clo&s;e, an error, <HI>here,</HI> being of more con&s;equence than may be imagined, the

<P>THESE precautions being u&s;ed, there is little danger of wa&s;te from the bundles breaking or tangling, and, that the HEMP may be prevented from getting quite to the bottom, and not only be placed, but pre&s;erved in &s;ome order in the water, it will be proper to lay two or three &s;traight poles, or &s;aplings, parallel in the water, &s;o as the two out&s;ide pieces may be about three or four feet a&s;under, and, for greater &s;ecurity, they ought to be joined with a &s;mall cro&s;s piece near to each end: acro&s;s this frame the HEMP mu&s;t be laid, interlocking the tops, and placing the butts out, after this manner it is to be piled on (&s;inking it under the water) till it is within a few inches of the &s;urface, it &s;hould then be covered over with &s;traw, or green boughs, to keep the &s;un from getting to the HEMP, and over this &s;hould be laid &s;ome logs of wood, or a few fence rails, to keep it under the water.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider that the effect produced by watering, being a di&s;&s;olution of a certain quantity of that gum, or gluti|nous &s;ub&s;tance which &s;erves to join the fibres of the HEMP to|gether, and attach them to the &s;tem, we are apt to imagine that a fine clear &s;tream would be fitter to accompli&s;h this end, becau&s;e, at the &s;ame time that it di&s;&s;olved, it would al&s;o purge and wa&s;h it from that gum and filth, thereby leaving the HEMP in a purer &s;tate, but experience, again&s;t which there is no rea&s;oning, convinces us, that the propere&s;t places for wa|tering HEMP, are deep ditches, or pits of &s;tagnated water, &s;uch as mill-ponds, or deep pools, where the water is &s;eldom or never changed. The more &s;till and putrid the ea&s;ier it fer|ments, and penetrates the HEMP more quickly, as well as more effectually, and, though that which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">

<P>SUCH per&s;ons as have not natural watering places convenient to them, may, with great ea&s;e and very &s;mall expence, have a pit dug for the purpo&s;e, about eight or nine feet in breadth, &s;o deep as to have full five feet water, and in length, accord|ing to the quantity of HEMP intended to be watered, and it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that this pit may be filled with HEMP two or three times in one &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>THIS pit, if po&s;&s;ible, ought to be in &s;uch a place, that no floods, or &s;treams of muddy foul water can flow into it, but at the &s;ame time &s;o &s;ituated, that a &s;mall quantity of &s;oft water, free from any mineral, may, when clear, be let into the pit, upon any occa&s;ion, and it will be very proper that this little &s;tream of water &s;hould, during the time the HEMP is in the pit, be permitted to run through it; if the water but trickles or ju&s;t runs it will be &s;ufficient; it is only wanted to effect a little change in the water in the pit, near the &s;urface, which, el&s;e, from the exce&s;&s;ive power of the &s;un at this &s;ea&s;on, would be much warmer at the top, and con&s;equently the HEMP there would be &s;ooner watered than at the bottom. Where no fre&s;h water can with convenience be admitted, the pit may be &s;haded by means of a few more green boughs, which may be

<P>AS &s;uch places may be made with little trouble, &s;o no water has yet been di&s;covered more proper for this purpo&s;e, and it will be found that the HEMP, watered in them the &s;e|cond year, will be preferable in colour and quality, to that of the fir&s;t, which proves, that the older and longer the water has remained in the&s;e pools, without being entirely changed, the fitter it is to an&s;wer our expectations. It is certain, the longer the water &s;ettles or &s;tands the &s;ofter it proves, and the more kindly it ferments with the &s;aponacious juices of plants; and to fit the&s;e pools the better and &s;ooner for the purpo&s;e, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to have them dug two or three months before they are u&s;ed, and to throw therein, to rot, any &s;ucculent weeds or plants, which may be taken out immediately when the HEMP is ready to be laid in, by which means the water will be &s;tirred up from the bottom, and mixed with that at top.&mdash;As undoubtedly the future qualities of the HEMP depend greatly upon the manner in which this proce&s;s is performed, it therefore becomes of con&s;equence to attend to the different methods; next to the HEMP which has been watered in the pits, expe|rience gives the preference to that which can be &s;afely rotted by the dew in the fall, its &s;trength and colour being little in|ferior to that which is watered in the pits, and &s;uperior in both to that which is winter rotted, which neverthele&s;s ought to be preferred before watering in a &s;tream, therefore &s;uch as do not chu&s;e to be at the trouble of providing pits ought to prefer the method of dew rotting. The principal danger at|tending this method, is from the too great heat of the &s;un, which is apt to injure the HEMP, if &s;pread out too early in the fall, and therefore is be&s;t guarded again&s;t, by not laying it out
<PB N="29" REF="014022_0029_0F92AE17585819F8">till towards the fir&s;t of October, which will yet leave time to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ot the HEMP before the &s;nows &s;et in.</P>
<P>IN whatever manner this operation is effected, we know, that the HEMP is watered &s;ufficiently, when the bark parts freely from the &s;tem, therefore, if the HEMP has been put into the water quite green, as directed above, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to draw out every day, beginning at the fourth at furthe&s;t, a few &s;talks, which are to be well dried, if then the bark is found to &s;eparate freely from the &s;tems, the HEMP is &s;ufficiently watered, and ought immediately to be taken out; permitting the HEMP to lie a day longer than nece&s;&s;ary, at this &s;ea&s;on of the year, when the weather is commonly very warm, would be greatly prejudicial to it, as the fibres of the bark, from being too much macerated, would occa&s;ion not only great wa&s;te in handling, whil&s;t wet, but, from not having &s;trength &s;ufficient to &s;u&s;tain the effort of the brake, part of the bark would re|main with the &s;tems. However, until experience teaches ex|actne&s;s in this, it is the be&s;t way to lean to the &s;afer &s;ide, and draw the HEMP rather too early than too late; if a bandle of the HEMP is tried daily, as directed above, no great error can be committed: when the HEMP is taken out of the watering place, though it is by no means proper to water it in clear &s;treams, it would be well, however, for tho&s;e who are conve|nient to &s;uch, to wa&s;h the HEMP carefully therein. As the bundles are taken out of the water, they may be laid on each other upon the bank with their tops &s;loping downward, in which po&s;ition the water will more readily drain off, by which means the bundles will be more &s;afely and ea&s;ily moved to the place where the HEMP is to be &s;pread to dry, which is gene|rally in &s;ome old field or piece of &s;hort gra&s;s land.&mdash;If it is perceived that the HEMP has been taken out too &s;oon, it is only permitting it to lie a few days longer where it is &s;pread,

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Directions for rai&s;ing and pre&s;erving the <HI>SEED.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN it is intended to let &s;eed plants remain in the HEMP ground, for the purpo&s;e of providing &s;eed, which is the method, though a very bad one, commonly u&s;ed, the blo&s;&s;om HEMP ought not to be pulled until the du&s;t has entirely fallen from the flowers, when they will begin to wither, and turn of a browni&s;h yellow, and the &s;talks white at the root; it may then be pulled without any injury to the &s;eed, and, if this is done with proper caution, it will give new &s;trength to tho&s;e &s;eed plants remaining in the ground, for, only the be&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t of this kind being left, the HEMP ground is delivered, not only from a great number of plants that exhau&s;ted its &s;trength, and injured and choaked one an|other, but the rai&s;ing and loo&s;ening the ground, about tho&s;e that remain, will prove equal to a hoeing.</P>
<P>THOUGH this is the method, as has been ob&s;erved, gene|rally u&s;ed for rai&s;ing &s;eed, yet it is by no means to be ap|proved of; &s;eparating the &s;eed plants from what you pull up occa&s;ions a great deal of trouble, and takes above double the time to gather and &s;ecure the HEMP from off the &s;ame ground; for, as the &s;talks of the&s;e plants left in the field, e&s;pecially when it has been &s;own of a proper thickne&s;s, being for the
<PB N="31" REF="014022_0031_0F92AE191245C7B8">mo&s;t part &s;mall and without any branches, yield but very little &s;eed, and even that none of the be&s;t, it will require a va&s;t number of them to produce but a very moderate quantity of &s;eed; be&s;ides the bark of this latter HEMP gets har&s;h from &s;tanding &s;o long, and is not &s;o fit for linen as it is for cordage.</P>
<P>A FAR better method is to rai&s;e the &s;eed <HI>apart by it&s;elf,</HI> either on a portion of the ground allotted for the HEMP, or, what would be yet more proper, on any other good &s;pot that is convenient for this purpo&s;e, which mu&s;t be reduced into proper tilth, either by the hoe, or plough, in the &s;ame manner as di|rected for the other. This ought to be done &s;o as to have the ground ready to receive the &s;eed as &s;oon as the fro&s;ts are over, for, provided that the weather is mild and will permit, the earlier what you intend to rai&s;e &s;eed from is put into the ground the better, not only becau&s;e the forward plants bring their &s;eeds better to maturity, and produce a greater quantity, but, in ca&s;e of accidents, there will be time to &s;ow the ground again.</P>
<P>THE &s;ea&s;on for &s;owing being come, the ground &s;hould be laid off, either with the plough or hoe, into flat hills, about four feet a&s;under, in each of the&s;e hills from ten to fifteen grains of the HEMP &s;eed may be depo&s;ited, and, as &s;oon as they are &s;prung to &s;uch a height as to be pa&s;t danger from the fro&s;t, or other accidents, the hills ought to be thinned, pulling up the &s;uperfluous &s;talks, leaving about eight or nine plants in each hill.</P>
<P>THE remaining plants ought to be kept clear of weeds, and the ground loo&s;ened, either by the plough or the hoe, until the HEMP grows to &s;uch a &s;ize that it becomes inconvenient to work among&s;t it. About the middle or towards the la&s;t of Augu&s;t, when the male or flower plants have entirely lo&s;t their du&s;t, and begin to drop their blo&s;&s;oms and wither, they &s;hould then
<PB N="32" REF="014022_0032_0F92AE19AAF53528">be carefully pulled up, &s;o as not to injure the female plants, which mu&s;t remain in the ground, commonly for five or &s;ix weeks longer until the &s;eed is ripe.</P>
<P>AS the &s;eed of this plant does not ripen equally, or all to|gether, attention mu&s;t be given to &s;ecure it in the proper time; &s;hould the &s;eeds get too ripe, and a wind happen when in this &s;tate, it might occa&s;ion the lo&s;s of the very be&s;t of the grain. As that &s;eed which ripens fir&s;t is the be&s;t, &s;o the danger of lo&s;ing it is the greate&s;t, &s;ome, therefore, &s;pread a &s;heet clo&s;e by the &s;ide of the plants, and bending their tops carefully over, beat out the ripe &s;eed into the &s;heet, by gently &s;haking or beating the bunches, by performing this once or twice, permitting &s;ome days to intervene, the very be&s;t of the &s;eed is all &s;aved, and the plants may &s;afely be permitted to re|main &s;ome time longer in the ground, by which means more of the &s;eed arrives to maturity.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon, then, as the &s;eeds begin to bur&s;t the cap&s;ules, or outer hu&s;ks, and appear well formed, and ready to drop out of them&s;elves, &s;ome of the &s;eed bunches &s;hould be examined, and if it is found, upon opening the green hu&s;ks, which have not yet bur&s;ted of them&s;elves, that the &s;hell, which covers the kernel, is firm and plump, of a grey colour, and tolerably well filled, then is the time for &s;aving the &s;eed; this is mo&s;t &s;afely and quickly done by cutting down the &s;talks with a &s;harp reap hook, near the ground, and, before the hu&s;ks can have any time to dry, or &s;hrink from the &s;eeds, they ought to be carried near to the barn, or the place where you intend to clean out the &s;eed, where they mu&s;t be &s;et up in &s;mall parcels, with their root ends down, and &s;preading wide at the bottom, and the heads bearing the &s;eeds compre&s;&s;ed clo&s;ely together at the top; it will be eligible to cover the&s;e &s;hocks, or parcels, with &s;traw, or afford them &s;ome other protection from the
<PB N="33" REF="014022_0033_0F92AE1A6064A5F8">weather and the birds. It is done, both expeditiou&s;ly and ef|fectually, by tying &s;mall bundles of rye &s;traw &s;ecurely together at the top, and &s;preading its butts over the heads of the HEMP, when it forms a roof &s;haped like a &s;ugar loaf, which, being tied about with a &s;ingle &s;talk or two at the butts of the &s;traw, &s;afely &s;ecures the &s;eed from injury; in this po&s;ition it may remain till the &s;eed is cured, and it is convenient to thre&s;h it out; or it may remain until the middle of November, when it is time to &s;pread out the HEMP to winter rot, this being by far the lea&s;t trouble&s;ome way of treating this latter HEMP, which is too coar&s;e and har&s;h for linen, but exceedingly fit for many purpo&s;es in hu&s;bandry; the &s;eed may be thre&s;hed out in the barn floor, or on a &s;trong cloth &s;pread on the ground, or it may be got off by means of an in&s;trument called a ripple; this is made in the form of a rake, only the teeth are placed clo&s;er together, through the&s;e teeth the tops of the HEMP are combed until all the &s;eed is pulled off, and, after being cleaned, and as much of the light &s;eed as po&s;&s;ible &s;epa|rated from it, that which is good may be put away in ca&s;ks, or any other place, until it is wanted, where it will be mo&s;t &s;ecure from the vermin.</P>
<P>AN acre of ground, managed in this manner, will produce from twenty to twenty-five or thirty bu&s;hels of &s;eed.</P>
<P>THIS &s;eed, be&s;ides being nece&s;&s;ary for the propagation of the plant, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es other u&s;eful qualities; it yields an oil in large quantities, which is fit either for the lamp or coar&s;e painting; a bu&s;hel of good &s;eed will yield about &s;ix or &s;even quarts, it is therefore profitable to rai&s;e it for its oil; this &s;eed is al&s;o a proper food for fowls or birds, and, made into a pa&s;te, fattens, in a very little time, hogs or other animals which are fed on it.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="014022_0034_0F92AE1C61C82D98">
WHEN only a few bu&s;hels of &s;eed are wanted, this may be as well procured from a few hills, made as directed above, or on any convenient bye &s;pot, &s;uch as &s;pare borders in a garden, where old tobacco or fodder hou&s;es have &s;tood, or even about the doors of tobacco hou&s;es, or indeed upon any &s;pots where wood, dung, or litter of any &s;ort has lain to rot; upon &s;uch places oftentimes five, &s;ix, or &s;even quarts of &s;eed is produced from one hill.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of the breaking and preparing of <HI>HEMP</HI> for the Hackle.</HEAD>
<P>THE HEMP being &s;afely watered, we now proceed to treat of the methods for &s;eparating and clearing the &s;tems from the bark; this is mo&s;t expeditiou&s;ly, and mo&s;t ef|fectually performed by means of a &s;imple in&s;trument, called a brake, which is con&s;tructed in the &s;ame manner as a <HI>flax</HI> brake, only larger, being not only longer, but the fingers or &s;words &s;hould be &s;tronger, and placed con&s;iderably wider at the hinder end.</P>
<P>ONE need &s;ee HEMP or <HI>flax</HI> broken but once, to be imme|diately ma&s;ter of the whole operation. The man or woman (for though this is a laborious work, it is neverthele&s;s often performed by women) takes in his left hand, near to the middle, and &s;o as that the root end may go fir&s;t under the brake, as much of the HEMP as can be conveniently gra&s;ped and with the other hand the upper jaw of the brake is rai&s;ed, the HEMP is in&s;tantly thrown between the two jaws of the in&s;trument, fir&s;t towards the end where the brake is wide&s;t, when the jaw which was lifted up is immediately let fall, and thus, by alternately rai&s;ing and letting fall the upper jaw, with all the agility and force that can be given it, and, at the
<PB N="35" REF="014022_0035_0F92AE1C9AB94B18">intervals of rai&s;ing, &s;hifting the HEMP into every different po|&s;ition, moving it as it gets more broke towards the fore end of the brake, where the fingers are clo&s;e&s;t, the &s;tems are in a little time broke into &s;mall pieces, which are made to quit the bark, by &s;haking it, or &s;triking it again&s;t the brake: when the root end is &s;ufficiently broken, the other part is put under, and treated in like manner; care mu&s;t be taken to gra&s;p the HEMP firmly in the hand, that it may be kept as even at the butts as po&s;&s;ible. When this operation is carefully performed, there will be very little wa&s;te, and the fibres will retain, as far as po&s;&s;ible, their natural length.</P>
<P>THIS fir&s;t performance, as it clears the HEMP from a great part of the du&s;t and gum, prepares it better for the next ope|ration, than the method of peeling, which is by no means to be u&s;ed for this &s;ort of HEMP: &s;uch as have not the opportu|nity of u&s;ing the brake, may perform this operation as effec|tually, by holding the HEMP on a block, or a large &s;mooth &s;tone, and beating it with a maul, until the &s;tems, being thereby broken and ground into &s;mall pieces, become ea&s;ily &s;eparated from the bark.</P>
<P>INDEED the HEMP, from which the &s;eed was rai&s;ed, may properly enough be peeled, and will afford fit employment for young Negroes, or &s;uch who are &s;o old as to be pa&s;t other labour, and this is ea&s;ily effected by breaking the &s;talks at the root end, when the bark may be readily &s;tripped entirely off the &s;tems to the top.</P>
<P>IN whatever way this work is done, it will be very much facilitated by having the HEMP made as dry as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>IN tho&s;e parts of England, where this plant is much culti|vated, they make u&s;e of ovens for this purpo&s;e, by means of which the HEMP is &s;afely and effectually dried through all its parts.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="014022_0036_0F92AE1DC3109B60">
THE oven is heated over night to &s;uch a degree, that a per&s;on can ju&s;t &s;tand in it without unea&s;ine&s;s, it is then cleaned and filled with the HEMP, and, being clo&s;ed up, the HEMP next morning will be fit to work off, and is taken out of the oven, as it is wanted, and carried to the brake, quite dry and cri&s;p, by which means this operation is not only more expeditiou&s;ly performed, but, as the HEMP, when thoroughly dried, requires le&s;s violence to clear it from the &s;tems than when it is damp and tough, there will be little or no wa&s;te, as very few of the fibres or ribbons of the HEMP will be broken in pa&s;&s;ing through the brake: from the&s;e rea&s;ons it appears, that this method of drying the HEMP is attended with con&s;iderable ad|vantages, but when we reflect, that they have a great deal more damp weather in England, than with us, ovens for this purpo&s;e are certainly more nece&s;&s;ary there than here, where we generally perform this work during the cool clear dry weather of the &s;pring, when the HEMP commonly requires no other preparation than opening the bundles, and expo&s;ing it to the &s;un for an hour or two, before it is put through the brake; however, &s;hould the weather prove damp when this operation requires to be performed, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to &s;ome other method to dry the HEMP: this is &s;ometimes done by &s;ticking four &s;mall pieces of forked wood in the ground, two on each &s;ide, with a &s;mall pole laid from the one fork to the other, on the&s;e two &s;ide poles are laid a few thin laths reaching acro&s;s, upon which the HEMP is &s;pread over a fire, that blazes but little. This method will do in calm weather, but it is better and &s;afer done by digging a hole about eight feet into the face of a hill or bank, and about five feet broad.</P>
<P>THE earth out of this hole being thrown upon each &s;ide forms with the hill three walls, from the &s;ide walls a few &s;mall
<PB N="37" REF="014022_0037_0F92AE1FE71AF0C8">pieces of wood, about the &s;ize of tobacco &s;ticks, are laid acro&s;s, upon the&s;e the HEMP intended for the brake is laid to dry, and turned from time to time over a &s;mall fire: in this place the heat, being confined by the &s;ide walls, and the bank be|hind, acts more upon the HEMP, which is more regularly and effectually dried than it can be the other way.</P>
<P>WHEN the HEMP is broken, and cleared from the &s;tems, if it is for the rope walk, it is tied up with a few &s;trands of the HEMP, about eight or nine inches from the root end, into hands or &s;tricks, of four or five pounds each, and is then ready to pack up into bales or bundles: but a laborious operation remains to prepare that for the hackle which is intended for cloth, this is beating, or pounding, which is performed va|rious ways: in tho&s;e parts of the country, where HEMP is much cultivated, mills are erected for this purpo&s;e, and, though they will admit of great improvement, yet they prepare the HEMP much better, and far quicker than can be done by the mallet. Where the&s;e mills are not to be had, the hammers of the fulling mill will effect the &s;ame end; they are a little more tedious in preparing the HEMP, but they do it full as well as it is done in the mills built for the purpo&s;e; &s;ometimes it is prepared under a bark mill, but, where none of the&s;e a&s;|&s;i&s;tances are convenient, it is laid in a &s;tone or wooden mortar, or on a block of wood, and either pounded with a heavy pe&s;tle, or large mallet; precaution mu&s;t be taken, that the HEMP be not injured during this operation, by continuing to pound it after it becomes too warm, for when it gets hot, which it &s;oon will do, from the &s;evere action of the mallet, it ought to be laid a&s;ide until it gets cool, when it may be again taken in hand; the HEMP is to be firmly twi&s;ted up, and the ends doubled in to prevent it from tangling, and ought to be placed and turned in every different po&s;ition, &s;o as to receive
<PB N="38" REF="014022_0038_0F92AE209E8BEA70">the impre&s;&s;ion of the mallet on all its parts. The intention of this work is to divide and &s;eparate the fibres of the HEMP, and, by di&s;engaging it from the remaining gum and dirt, render it more &s;oft and pliant, and fit it the better for the hackle.</P>
<P>THIS operation, be&s;ides being a &s;evere one, is often prejudi|cial to the health of the work people, the gum, which in pounding flies off from the HEMP, fills the air with di&s;agree|able du&s;t, which, being drawn in with the breath, frequently brings on di&s;orders, occa&s;ioned by ob&s;tructions in the lungs, to &s;uch as are obliged to follow this labour for a livelihood: It is full as di&s;agreeable for tho&s;e who attend the mills.</P>
<P>THE hackling is nearly as noxious when much of the re|maining du&s;t, in pa&s;&s;ing the HEMP &s;o quickly through the hackle, is rubbed off.</P>
<P>THE hackles u&s;ed for this bu&s;ine&s;s are of different degrees of finene&s;s, agreeable to the quality of the manufacture intended.</P>
<P>THE whole of this operation, though it requires u&s;e and practice to dre&s;s HEMP to the be&s;t advantage, may neverthe|le&s;s be performed by any careful per&s;on. There is another method which is made u&s;e of, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, to improve the quality of <HI>flax,</HI> as well as HEMP; a large pot, with as much weak lye in it as to cover the bottom, is placed over a &s;mall fire, ju&s;t &s;ufficient to keep the lye boiling; a few nar|row &s;plits of wood are placed acro&s;s each other, until they are &s;o far above the lye as to prevent the HEMP, which is to be placed upon them, from touching it; upon the&s;e &s;ticks the &s;treaks, or parcels of HEMP, are placed in layers, leaving a little &s;pace between each parcel; the layers are to cro&s;s each other, &s;o that the &s;team may thereby pa&s;s freely through to the top or upper parcels; when the pot is nearly full it is covered almo&s;t clo&s;e, and, after that mo&s;t of the lye has evaporated,

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> A new method of preparing <HI>HEMP</HI> by a &s;econd watering, to|gether with &s;ome ob&s;ervations on its qualities.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus endeavoured to communicate &s;uch me|thods as appear be&s;t adapted to our climate, as well as tho&s;e mo&s;t commonly made u&s;e of among&s;t us at this time, for cultivating and preparing HEMP for dome&s;tic purpo&s;es. Yet, after all the fatigue, labour and pains in the preparation, it is found to produce but a very coar&s;e, ill coloured thread, and &s;o har&s;h, that, before it can be made fit to be wove into cloth, it is nece&s;&s;ary to boil it in &s;everal lyes, and the cloth, made of this yarn, is &s;till &s;o hard to be bleached, that it re|quires a tedious operation, which is both laborious and ex|pen&s;ive, before it can be brought to any tolerable colour, &s;o that it has hitherto been deemed only fit to make the coar&s;e&s;t kinds of cloth.</P>
<P>WITH a view of encouraging a general cultivation of this mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary plant, we &s;hall endeavour to communicate a method, which not only abridges the mo&s;t laborious, and di&s;|pen&s;es with the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable operations now u&s;ed in pre|paring HEMP, but, from numbers of experiments which have been made, will evince that HEMP has many valuable quali|ties which we have hitherto but very little attended to, and that it may be applied, with ea&s;e and great propriety, to an&s;wer many elegant and con&s;iderable purpo&s;es in life, for which it has been hitherto deemed utterly unfit.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="014022_0040_0F92AE2210295FF8">
THE bark of the HEMP, as it appears in its original &s;tate upon the &s;tem, &s;eems &s;urrounded, or entirely covered with a dirty glutinous oil, or gum, which not only &s;erves to attach the bark to the &s;tem, but al&s;o to join, or glue the fibres of the bark lengthways together: experience &s;hews that this gluti|nous &s;ub&s;tance has different degrees of re&s;i&s;tance; the common watering &s;erves to di&s;&s;olve &s;o much of this gum as to fit the HEMP for the brake, but &s;till, after this operation, the bark remains in broad &s;trings or ribbons, and it is nece&s;&s;ary, before a further &s;eparation of the fibres can be effected, to have re|cour&s;e to &s;ome other proce&s;s to clear them from the remaining gum; the mill, or the mallet, has been hitherto generally u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e, by means of which operation, part of the gum being beat off, the bark becomes more divided, yet &s;till the-fibres remain coar&s;e and har&s;h. Experience, however, has demon&s;trated, that a &s;econd watering, when performed with care, not only accompli&s;hes the work of the mill, but goes a great way further. The HEMP, by means of this &s;econd wa|tering, being wa&s;hed and di&s;engaged from the remaining gum and dirt, becomes white and flexible, and its fibres ea&s;ily di|vi&s;ible to a great degree of finene&s;s, by means of the &s;ucceed|ing operation of the hackle.</P>
<P>THIS method of preparing HEMP appears to have been practi&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s in many parts of France, and is &s;trongly recommended in a treati&s;e publi&s;hed by <HI>M. Marchandier,</HI> ma|gi&s;trate of Bourges, the capital of Berry, a province long cele|brated for its hempen cloth.</P>
<Q><P>AFTER having long con&s;idered, &s;ays this writer, the various means that might be found to relieve tho&s;e who work upon HEMP, and ob&s;erved tho&s;e admirable qualities, of which, hitherto, no improvement has been made, we found that the common watering of HEMP was nothing but
<PB N="41" REF="014022_0041_0F92AE23051BA1E8">the di&s;&s;olution of a tenacious gum, natural to the plant, the parts whereof are joined together merely by means of it, and that, in order to this fir&s;t preparation, it was &s;ufficient to leave the HEMP in the water, in proportion to the quan|tity and tenacity of this gum, that after having prepared it only for being peeled, or braked, it &s;eemed very proper to give it a &s;econd watering, to &s;often the bark, that &s;till re|mains hard, ela&s;tic, and incapable of being brought to a proper degree of finene&s;s. Accordingly, by the different experiments we made, in the pre&s;ence, and under the di|rection of <HI>Mon&s;. Dodart,</HI> intendant of Berry, we have found means, ea&s;ily, and without expence, to give it tho&s;e qualities which are natural to it, and the u&s;es whereof were not hitherto known.</P>
<P>THE water that has already had power to &s;eparate the bark from the &s;tem, &s;erves al&s;o to divide, without trouble or hazard, the fibres from one another, by a total di&s;&s;olu|tion of the gum that remains in them?</P></Q>
<P>IT is needle&s;s to enumerate the many different methods and experiments which have been tried, it will be &s;ufficient to lay down the nece&s;&s;ary directions in as few words as will render them intelligible to the meane&s;t capacity, for no operation can well be more &s;imple, plain and ea&s;y.</P>
<P>THE HEMP, being previou&s;ly broke, and tolerably well cleared from the &s;tems, mu&s;t be divided into &s;maller parcels, each of the handfuls from the brake may be divided into two, or, if very large, into three parcels, the&s;e are to be doubled in the middle, twi&s;ting them very &s;lightly, and &s;ecuring the ends by doubling them in, or by wrapping the longe&s;t fibres of the ends two or three times round, &s;o that the parcels may not only be kept from mixing with each other, but al&s;o that the HEMP of every individual parcel may be kept &s;traight, and
<PB N="42" REF="014022_0042_0F92AE25313E9CF8">in due regularity. The parcels thus prepared mu&s;t be placed in regular layers in the tub or ve&s;&s;el, which you have pre|pared for the purpo&s;e, which is to be filled with water, the propere&s;t for the purpo&s;e is pond or rain water, or the &s;ofte&s;t that can be procured; in this the HEMP may continue for twelve, eighteen, or even twenty-four hours; by this time, if the weather is warm, the gum remaining on the HEMP, though not di&s;&s;olved, will be thoroughly moi&s;tened. The HEMP is then to be taken out, and, that the gum may be the better loo&s;ened, and more readily wa&s;hed off, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to wa&s;h the HEMP well in clear water, as it is taken out; this may be mo&s;t conveniently done in an old tub, the &s;taves of which are cut off within about ten or twelve inches of the bottom; this tub &s;hould be placed in a run of water, or below a &s;pring, &s;o that the water may continually pa&s;s through it; the HEMP is then to be trampled on by the per&s;on's feet, who is employed in this work, and as there will be a con&s;tant &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of clear water, the dirt and gum will be wa&s;hed away as fa&s;t as it is &s;queezed out of the HEMP; when the water appears to pa&s;s clear from the HEMP, it &s;hould then be taken up, and, after the water is gently wrung, or rather &s;queezed out, it is then to be laid on a block, and beat with a beetle, the in&s;tru|ment u&s;ed to beat cloaths with, when wa&s;hed: The edge, which is commonly two inches thick, is better for this purpo&s;e than the flat &s;ide; in this manner it mu&s;t be beat, moi&s;tening and &s;hifting the po&s;ition of the HEMP, until you judge that it is di&s;engaged from the remainder of the gum, and that its fibres begin to divide, and &s;eparate; it &s;hould then be thrown into the water, untwi&s;ted, and by &s;ingle parcels wa&s;hed very clean, when the good effects of this &s;econd watering will appear; the HEMP being purged and di&s;engaged from the gum and dirt, by the foregoing operation, its fibres will appear
<PB N="43" REF="014022_0043_0F92AE25A31CC500">fine, and as completely divided, as if they had already pa&s;&s;ed through the hackle. When the HEMP is very well rin&s;ed, it is to be carefully wrung, and, after &s;haking it out, hung acro&s;s a rope to dry; &s;hould the weather prove windy, it will be be&s;t to &s;pread it on the gra&s;s, as the wind is &s;aid to impair the &s;trength both of HEMP and <HI>flax.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the mode which we have adopted for performing this operation during warm weather, which is undoubtedly the fitte&s;t time for this bu&s;ine&s;s, heat being ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;i&s;t in clearing the HEMP from its gum and filth, for which rea&s;on, it will not only be more tedious to effect this in cold &s;evere weather, but it is rather di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to the per&s;ons em|ployed to &s;tand or work in cold water, however, when we can|not find time conveniently in &s;ummer, to perform this work, another method may be adopted during the cold weather, which, though it occa&s;ions a little more trouble than the other, enables us, neverthele&s;s, to perform this proce&s;s full as quickly.</P>
<P>A POT of weak lye is to be prepared towards the evening, and, after having previou&s;ly &s;oaked the HEMP in warm water, for two or three hours, it is to be wrung out and placed in the tub, as before directed, the lie, after having &s;ettled, is to be poured as warm as po&s;&s;ible over the HEMP, which &s;hould be kept under the lye, by means of a cover nearly adapted to the &s;ize of the mouth of the ve&s;&s;el, which will al&s;o keep the &s;teams from evaporating, and enable the HEMP to retain a warmth until morning, when it mu&s;t be taken out of the lye, and trampled upon and beat as before directed, u&s;ing a little warm water, occa&s;ionally, to temper the &s;everity of the cold during the trampling and beating, which are the mo&s;t tedious parts of the proce&s;s, as only the rin&s;ing will require to be done in cold water.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="014022_0044_0F92AE266F39C478">
WHEN the HEMP is dry, four or five of the parcels may, as they are taken off the rope, be twi&s;ted up firmly together, doubling in the ends, to prevent it from getting loo&s;e in pounding; for as the HEMP, in drying, is apt to get matted together, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, before it can be hackled, that the fibres &s;hould be &s;eparated again; this may be effected altogether by the mallet, though this purpo&s;e is an&s;wered full better by means of another in&s;trument called a clove.</P>
<P>THE HEMP, after being beaten until it begins to get &s;oft, is then &s;hook loo&s;e, and one or two of the parcels being gra&s;ped in the right hand, near to the middle, giving the HEMP a turn round the hand to keep the fibres more firmly in their place, the woman, who works this in&s;trument, &s;its on the bench or block, in which it is fixed, and having hold with her left hand, of the handle of the lower piece or jaw, which only moves, &s;he cau&s;es it to open by rai&s;ing her hand; with the other, the HEMP is thrown between the two jaws, and then, by lowering the left hand, the moving jaw is rai&s;ed, the HEMP being thereby in&s;erted or forced into the groove of the upper piece, is immediately drawn forcibly through, while the jaw is held fa&s;t. The HEMP, in its pa&s;&s;age, being &s;everely rubbed again&s;t the edges of the in&s;trument, is both &s;oftened and &s;eparated; this work, being bri&s;kly repeated, in a very &s;hort time it &s;oftens, di&s;engages, and &s;eparates the fibres of the HEMP more quickly, and prepares it better for the hackle, than the mallet alone.&mdash;When the one end is done, that which was wrapped round the hand is treated in like manner.</P>
<P>FROM this proce&s;s, than which nothing can be ea&s;ier, and which differs in no e&s;&s;ential point from the directions given by <HI>Mon&s;. Marcandier,</HI> mo&s;t of the difficulties formerly attending the preparation of HEMP are removed, and, what is of more
<PB N="45" REF="014022_0045_0F92AE27382FE558">con&s;equence, its qualities appear very much improved. "This work (&s;ays <HI>Mon&s;. Marcandier</HI>) formerly &s;o hard, on account of the &s;trength it required, and &s;o dangerous, on ac|count of the fatal du&s;t the workman drew in with his breath, will be, henceforth, only a bu&s;ine&s;s moderately &s;evere. There will be no occa&s;ion to look for machines to &s;ave the labour of men, and prevent the dangers attending the work. The bu&s;ine&s;s of hemp-dre&s;&s;ing, henceforward, would be confined to an ea&s;y beating of the HEMP, and the common operations of the hackle: it is &s;o much the more ea&s;y that the materials are &s;ofter, and no longer exhale unwhol&s;ome du&s;t: and more|over there is &s;carce any wa&s;te in this operation. If you want it to pa&s;s through the fine&s;t hackle, the HEMP thus wa&s;hed will afford dre&s;&s;ed &s;tuff capable of producing the be&s;t thread, comparable to what is yielded by the fine&s;t flax, and you will have little more than a third of very good hards.</P>
<P>"Now the&s;e hards, which were formerly an object of di&s;|couragement, and &s;old commonly for about five farthing, the pound, by this new operation, becomes a matter of very great advantage. By carding them like wool, they produce a fine white, marrowy &s;ub&s;tance, the true u&s;e whereof was never di&s;|covered till now. They may be &s;pun alone into very beautiful thread. They may be al&s;o mixed with cotton and &s;ilk, with wool, and even with hair; and the thread, that re&s;ults from the&s;e different mixtures, affords, by its va&s;t variety, materials for new e&s;&s;ays, very intere&s;ting to the arts, and of va&s;t utility to &s;everal &s;orts of manufactures.</P>
<P>"IN HEMP, duly prepared, be&s;ides &s;ilk, hair, wool, and cotton, we find a new material, which, till now, had never any exi&s;tence in commerce, nor in manufactures, but may be made extremely u&s;eful in both. By mixing it with wool, for in&s;tance, half and half, we work it into caps and cloths, which are no
<PB N="46" REF="014022_0046_0F92AE280C47B128">ways different from tho&s;e that are made of wool alone, even in their greate&s;t perfection. By mixing the hards of it with cotton, we make cloth and &s;tuffs, and even coverlids, which, with regard to whitene&s;s, &s;oftne&s;s, finene&s;s, and other qualities, may be preferred to tho&s;e, which, at fir&s;t, we only propo&s;e to imitate. Nor is it to be doubted, but it may be al&s;o employ|ed in manufactures of hats, becau&s;e it will be an ea&s;y matter to make felts of it, if we mix it with wool proper for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>"IN a word, by the different combinations made with the hards of HEMP, they a&s;&s;ume the nature and properties of the materials with which they are mixed, and the price of &s;uch materials will be le&s;&s;ened in proportion as they are now dear, uncommon and rare.</P>
<P>"We have already given, in &s;everal cities of the kingdom, &s;uch &s;amples of the&s;e mixtures as have been demanded of us, that the fir&s;t &s;ight of them has excited the &s;urpri&s;e, and merited the approbation of the be&s;t judges."</P>
<P>FROM the above quotations we may form &s;ome opinion of the idea which Mon&s;. <HI>Marcandier</HI> entertains of the properties of HEMP, and the advantages which it may be of to manufac|tures, when prepared agreeable to this new method; but, not|with&s;tanding &s;o many new qualities are attributed to HEMP, when prepared by a &s;econd watering, this method is attended with more wa&s;te of the HEMP than when it is prepared in the mill, when it will doubtle&s;s yield more dre&s;&s;ed &s;tuff, though not &s;o fine in quality, and if the labour is not &s;o &s;evere or un|healthy, it mu&s;t be allowed to be more tedious and trouble|&s;ome; however, &s;hould this mode of preparation fail in produ|cing all the advantages we are made to hope from it, yet there are many very important ones to be urged in its favour, and when we con&s;ider that the yarn, which is &s;pun of the &s;tuff
<PB N="47" REF="014022_0047_0F92AE28CA762D48">hackled from that prepared in the mill, lo&s;es greatly of its weight in boiling (a proce&s;s which all linen thread mu&s;t un|dergo to prepare it for weaving) the difference will not be &s;o con&s;iderable, when the &s;econd watering is performed with care.</P>
<P>A MOST con&s;iderable advantage re&s;ults from the coar&s;e tow, or hards, of the fir&s;t hackling, which, by means of the &s;econd watering, becomes an object of great utility, being thereby excellently prepared to make the be&s;t &s;orts of coar&s;e linens, fit for cloathing our labourers and negroes, and preferable in &s;trength and quality to imported o&s;nabrigs, being greatly &s;u|perior to the coar&s;e tow of the HEMP prepared in the mill, which is only capable of making a very coar&s;e, har&s;h, unprofi|table cloth, and indeed, even the coar&s;e cloth made from the hackled HEMP, which has been prepared in the mill, will not do equal &s;ervice to the cloth made from the coar&s;e watered tow; a large portion of the gum remaining with the HEMP, is twi&s;ted up in &s;pinning, therefore the cloth continues har&s;h and &s;tiff, whereby it cuts it&s;elf before it is fairly worn; this rea&s;oning may be further confirmed from knowing that coar&s;e cloth, made even of flax tow, will wear longer than linen made from yarn, &s;pun very coar&s;e from dre&s;&s;ed flax; therefore, as we find that very coar&s;e linens, made either from dre&s;&s;ed HEMP or <HI>flax,</HI> are, from their &s;tiffne&s;s, but ill calculated for &s;ome &s;orts of &s;ervice, we may rea&s;onably expect that the linens made from HEMP duly prepared by a &s;econd watering, as they are &s;oft, flexible, and pliant, and &s;trong withal, will be found more durable, and therefore on every account to be preferred.</P>
<P>WHEN the HEMP is intended for more elegant purpo&s;es, it &s;till becomes more nece&s;&s;ary to prepare it by a &s;econd watering, as, by that means, it becomes more &s;uitable for &s;uch u&s;es, than it po&s;&s;ibly can be by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> its colour al&s;o being thereby
<PB N="48" REF="014022_0048_0F92AE2974DB1508">greatly improved, both the thread and cloth made from it are mo&s;t readily bleached, and its dre&s;&s;ed &s;tuff mo&s;t amply adapted to &s;upply us with linens &s;imilar or preferable to the dowlas and garlix of France, and the Low Countries, as well as the white and brown linen fabrics of Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>ITS thread al&s;o, being &s;o readily whitened, is not only proper for checks, &s;triped linens, bed ticking, &amp;c. but it be|comes a material, by this preparation, mo&s;t excellently calcu|lated to an&s;wer as the warp for all fabrics of wool and cotton, fine as well as coar&s;e, and the tow produced from the &s;econd, or finer hacklings, yielding a fine &s;oft &s;ub&s;tance, in &s;ome degree &s;imilar to wool and cotton, it &s;eems rea&s;onable to ima|gine that, upon being blended and carded with the&s;e materials, the thread, re&s;ulting from the&s;e different mixtures, may prove productive of a variety of new and profitable manufactures, &s;imilar, and not inferior, to many of the various bleached and dyed &s;tuffs of Manche&s;ter, as the HEMP, after being thus pre|pared, will as readily receive, and retain the tints of any dye, as the wool or cotton with which it is blended.</P>
<P>AFTER the particular account that has been given of the nature and properties of HEMP, and at the &s;ame time reflect|ing with how much ea&s;e and certainty it may be cultivated, it is greatly to be wi&s;hed, that the inhabitants of the&s;e colonies would avail them&s;elves of &s;uch advantages; the &s;ucce&s;s which mu&s;t attend the undertaking will have a better effect than all that can be wrote in its favour, as it would be an argument to the meane&s;t capacity, and give irre&s;i&s;table encouragement to this mo&s;t u&s;eful branch of dome&s;tic manufacture; the ideas here &s;ugge&s;ted will readily receive a better form from prac|tice, and be carried further <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> knowledge and expe|rience. By applying our&s;elves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> of this plant, we &s;hall mo&s;t readily attain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> of perfection
<PB N="49" REF="014022_0049_0F92AE2A317456E0">in tho&s;e arts, the knowledge of which will be found as ea&s;y and nece&s;&s;ary as the wants they &s;upply are real and exten&s;ive; we &s;hall not only find re&s;ources, within our&s;elves, to furni&s;h tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries, for which we have hitherto been mo&s;t &s;hame|fully dependent upon others, but, at the &s;ame time, an ea&s;y and profitable employment for our &s;pare time and idle hands. After a &s;hort practice, the coar&s;e&s;t of our goods will be manu|factured in the family, and the whole of the bu&s;ine&s;s, if it is pro&s;ecuted with oeconomy, may be performed without en|croaching on our wonted avocations.</P>
<P>UPON calculating how much can be done at &s;uch times, and by &s;uch means, this a&s;&s;ertion will not be found exagge|rated, and &s;urely, if we can &s;upply our nece&s;&s;ities, nearly, with the &s;uperfluities of our labour, we &s;hall not only procure &s;uch goods upon much ea&s;ier terms than when we buy them of the traders, that purcha&s;e them from the manufacturer, who has no other re&s;ource for a livelihood, but, when we con&s;ider the va&s;t &s;ums &s;uch goods amount to, yearly, we may then form &s;ome e&s;timate of the advantages which mu&s;t re&s;ult to the public, as well as to individuals, from pro&s;ecuting &s;uch &s;chemes of indu&s;try and frugality.</P>
<P>AS a further illu&s;tration of what is here advanced, a few calculations are &s;ubjoined, and though they may not prove &s;o exact as could be wi&s;hed, yet precaution has been ob&s;erved, not to exaggerate, but rather to keep within bounds.</P>

<CELL><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A woman accu&s;tomed to &s;uch employment can &s;pin, in one day, from eight to ten or twelve cuts of tow yarn, and from ten to fifteen cuts from dre&s;&s;ed &s;tuff, each cut contains 120 threads, three yards in cir umference. The tow yarn, therefore, will make from two to three yards of linen of the breadth of o&s;na|brigs, and, when we con&s;ider the &s;mall quantity of linen allowed our people in general, it is not ab&s;urd to expect that the negro women and children, if once taught &s;hould be able to &s;pin their own cloathing, in the evenings after work, and at &s;uch times as they cannot be otherwi&s;e more profitably employed; this, and a great deal more, is done in &s;ome other parts of the world. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> parts of Germany, where the taxes and rents are heavy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> are obliged to &s;pin cotton and linen yarn, after the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> day is fini&s;hed, to enable them to di&s;charge their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> many of them are as dextrous at the wheel as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> before, if gentlemen of fortune, who have numbers of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, would provide a &s;uitable building, proportioned to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> where they might collect their young negroes of both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> together, with as many of their other people as can be con|veniently &s;pared, they might be in&s;tructed in &s;pinning, &amp;c. by one per&s;on; and, as there are great numbers of women lately arrived in the&s;e colonies from the north of Ireland, who in general are re|markable good &s;pinners, there can be no difficulty in obtaining a per&s;on qualified to undertake this office, who may be hired for twenty, or at the mo&s;t twenty-four dollars a year, and, as fuel be|comes &s;carce in many parts, if the building was properly con|&s;tructed, even different apartments could be warmed by means of a ca&s;t iron &s;tove, with an iron funnel or pipe, and, as this kind of &s;tove, which differs from what is called the Dutch &s;tove, admits of a circulation in the air of the apartments, there is no danger of its proving either unhealthy or di&s;agreeable, and in a few years would &s;ave nearly the expence of the building in fire-wood.</NOTE>To &s;pinning 350 lb. of &s;tuff, from 10<ABBR>d.</ABBR> to 14<ABBR>d.</ABBR></CELL>
