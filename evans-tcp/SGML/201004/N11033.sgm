<L>CAN you, my Lord, who &s;erve de&s;potic ends,</L>
<L>Can you be "ju&s;t to virtue and her friends?"</L>
<L>To wanton murderers when did &s;he afford</L>
<L>Protection yet, or alter a record?</L>
<L>Say, does your callous &s;oul receive no &s;hock,</L>
<L>When, con&s;cious, in the hall, you view the clock?</L>
<L>Or can you fill profidious Scroges's place,</L>
<L>Without a pre&s;&s;age of your own di&s;grace?</L>
<L>Yes&mdash;Yes, to England's &s;hame you're out of reach,</L>
<L>And laugh at him who threatens to impeach.</L>
<L>If Burke &s;hould ri&s;e, the farce no further goes;</L>
<L>To one ju&s;t aye, North brings ten impious no's.</L>
<L>In youth, before di&s;&s;embling was your trade,</L>
<L>To James libations on your knees you made:</L>
<L>Not loyalty, but fear has &s;heath'd your &s;ting;</L>
<L>No Murray can be faithful to his King.</L>

From the black North in fami&s;h'd clans you &s;warm,</L>
<L>And thawing, feel how Albion's &s;un can warm;</L>
<L>Your clime you change, your &s;entiments retain;</L>
<L>In Scotchmen trea&s;on is an innate &s;tain;</L>
<L>Like itch and &s;curvy in their blood it reigns;</L>
<L>He who would cure it mu&s;t exhau&s;t their veins.</L>
<L>Once again&s;t rebels, 'twas your place to plead,</L>
<L>Your mouth condemn'd, your &s;oul approv'd the deed.</L>
<L>Whil&s;t round your heart &s;ad di&s;appointment hung,</L>
<L>Di&s;&s;imulation oil'd your treach'rous tongue.</L>
<L>A Murray then (your brother too) was found</L>
<L>In arms, in &s;ecret tru&s;t, in duty bound,</L>
<L>And principle (like yours) to aid a claim,</L>
<L>Which you affected with a blu&s;h to name;</L>
<L>A blu&s;h ill-acted;&mdash;to thy gho&s;tly pale,</L>

<L>No&mdash;we my lord di&s;dains to &s;erve ends;</L>

<L>When injur's children are a&s;&s;ail'd like foes;</L>
<L>When famine's call'd to aid the coward plan,</L>
<L>And North compleats what Bute and you began.</L>
<L>Peri&s;h your names! your Thane in fear is fled,</L>
<L>With ev'ry cur&s;e but Scotland's on his head:</L>
<L>In &s;hade, but not (alas!) in death en&s;hrin'd,</L>
<L>Whil&s;t you, his faithful proxy &s;peaks his mind;</L>
<L>And (to weak George from &s;oothing flatt'ry dear)</L>
<L>Pour your Laird's poi&s;on in the royal ear.</L>
<L>Why do your treach'rous actions &s;hun the light?</L>
<L>Why do back-&s;tairs feel Mansfield's &s;teps at night?</L>
<L>To George your councils and your&s;elf convey,</L>
<L>Fraught with infection, in the face of day.</L>

<L>Nor tru&s;t their merits to &s;ubaltern clans.</L>
<L>Tho' Bure ab&s;conds, yet aid your joint de&s;ign,</L>
<L>Your&s;elf, my Lord; and help to &s;pring the mine.</L>

<L>The wor&s;t of traitors&mdash;you have &s;en&s;e to &s;ee</L>

<L>He &s;till lies hid; perhaps at Clapham lurks,</L>
<L>Whil&s;t you and Ap&s;ley carry on the works.</L>
<L>To grant a nation's claim each hou&s;e is loth,</L>
<L>But you have repre&s;entatives in both.</L>
<L>Strangely ab&s;urd!&mdash;yet this we know and &s;ee;</L>
<L>This truth &s;ubdu'd your mode&s;t member Leigh.</L>
<L>The man had &s;en&s;e, and felt his own di&s;grace,</L>
<L>How well an A&s;ton wou'd &s;upply his place!</L>
<L>So repre&s;ented, with &s;uch leaders too,</L>

This war again&s;t our&s;elves will &s;oon be won,</L>
<L>Odious America be &s;oon undone.</L>
<L>Remon&s;trances are vain, Bute won't relax,</L>
<L>But &s;ternly bids North lay another tax.</L>
<L>The tax of death, by bayonet and ball;</L>
<L>But famine is the harde&s;t tax of all.</L>
<L>From Scotland, could that thought derive its &s;ource?</L>
<L>Where is &s;harp famine felt with greater force?</L>
<L>In all the horrors there the fiend's array'd;</L>
<L>There her &s;hrunk hand for ever chills the blade.</L>
<L>There with lank &s;ides, the meagre cattle moan;</L>
<L>Their keeper a&s;ks for bread and gets a &s;tone.</L>
<L>From this di&s;tre&s;s your&s;elf and Bute &s;oon fled,</L>
<L>Yet pour it's plagues upon a nation's head.</L>
<L>By vile&s;t means, my Lord, you &s;eek vile ends;</L>
<L>Thus are you "ju&s;t to virtue and her friends."</L>
<L>In all your &s;trokes a ma&s;ter's hand appears:</L>
<L>Stand forth, claim all your prai&s;e, and bani&s;h fears.</L>
<L>If con&s;cience dictates every ill you do,</L>
<L>Frankly expo&s;e the knave you hide, to view.</L>
<L>Plebeians &s;corn&mdash;to gain your King'-applau&s;e,</L>

<L>De&s;pi&s;e what faithful hi&s;tory &s;hall &s;ay;</L>
<L>Full in your Zenith now, enjoy your day;</L>
<L>Tho' in times annals your foul name &s;hou'd ru&s;t,</L>
<L>Whil&s;t Fame to Hoit's erects a la&s;ting bu&s;t.</L>
<L>He had no Smythe; no bias he had &s;hown,</L>
<L>But dragg'd a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins from behind the throne.</L>
<L>Guardian of England's laws he gave 'em &s;way,</L>
<L>And held them forth for &s;overeign's to obey.</L>
<L>Again&s;t the people's rights he took no part,</L>
<L>But judg'd, and coun&s;ell'd with an hone&s;t heart.</L>
<L>Prerogative (unpen&s;ion'd and unbrib'd)</L>
<L>He kept within the bounds that law pre&s;crib'd,</L>

By freedom's &s;ide he firmly took his &s;tand,</L>
<L>Yet held the balance with an equal hand.</L>
<L>Of that fair plant he cheri&s;h'd ev'ry &s;hoot,</L>
<L>And, with a parent's fondne&s;s nurs'd the root.</L>
<L>His name, whil&s;t law endures, &s;hall live in prai&s;e;</L>
<L>A&s;by and White, no Mansfield can era&s;e.</L>

<L>Indulge your King's caprice in all you do.</L>
<L>If citizens their humble plaints expre&s;s,</L>
<L>You bid him &s;purn the May'r, and his addre&s;s.</L>
<L>With plea&s;antry your &s;ov'reign's heat a&s;&s;wage,</L>
<L>And arm him for the horned cattle's rage.</L>
<L>In&s;truct him how to &s;peak, to &s;neer and frown,</L>
<L>To try if tricks will bear a city down:</L>
<L>To be a&s;toni&s;h'd that one voice &s;hou'd &s;ue</L>
<L>To turn a tyrant from his bloody-view.</L>
<L>Death is the word&mdash;let loo&s;e the dogs of prey;</L>

<L>In art &s;upreme, in perfidy not weak,</L>
<L>Show ba&s;hful Lordlings what it is to &s;peak.</L>
<L>Let not &s;uch fools as Suffolk, when they ri&s;e,</L>
<L>Without a word of Engli&s;h, &s;natch the prize.</L>
<L>Shall Peers, who&s;e infamy is &s;carce half-blown,</L>
<L>Vaunt Mansfield's &s;chemes, as if they were his own;</L>
<L>In language, which no grammar e'er equipp'd,</L>
<L>Language, for which a &s;chool-boy wou'd be whip'd?</L>
<L>No.&mdash;Be your&s;elf, my Lord, and unconfin'd,</L>
<L>A&s;&s;ert your right of ruining mankind.</L>
<L>Break forth in all your Ciceronian blaze,</L>

<L>And, with a tenderne&s;s his Prince will blame,</L>
<L>Shrink from rank murder and eternal &s;hame;</L>
<L>When con&s;cience and remor&s;e from court is flown,</L>
<L>Nor dare &s;olicit a de&s;potic throne;</L>
<L>All mu&s;t be &s;laves till &s;pirit &s;hall return,</L>
<L>To fire tho&s;e bo&s;oms where it us'd to burn;</L>
<L>'Till we con&s;ider names far le&s;s than things,</L>
<L>Nor care from what &s;ound &s;tem we take our Kings,</L>
<L>Till &s;cepter'd pride is taught to ble&s;s the hand</L>
<L>That calls her to protect a gen'rous land;</L>
<L>Is taught that Briti&s;h monarchs owe their &s;tate,</L>
<L>To tho&s;e who can depo&s;e them or create;</L>
<L>Provok'd, in&s;ult'd, &s;purn'd, can &s;pare, or try;</L>
<L>Or throw with &s;corn their royal creature by.</L>
<L>Bute! Mansfield! the&s;e are doctrines which appear,</L>
<L>Horrid and har&s;h to your di&s;temper'd ear;</L>
<L>But there will come a time when you &s;hall rue</L>
<L>That e'er you coun&s;el'd with a heart untrue:</L>
<L>When from tho&s;e coun&s;els deadly fueds &s;hall ri&s;e</L>
<L>To force a tear unfeign'd from George's eyes.</L>
<L>Truth ev'n on Kings in that &s;ad hour attends:</L>
<L>Charles found, at la&s;t, his people were his friends;</L>
<L>To notions, fal&s;e as friends, he bid adieu;</L>
<L>The&s;e had deceiv'd; the block &s;poke plain but true.</L>
<L>Ne'er may a Brun&s;wick ta&s;te &s;uch bitter fruit,</L>
<L>But leave the axe to Mansfield, North, and Bute.</L>
<L>The&s;e lines in&s;pired by Churchill's laurel'd &s;hade,</L>
<L>I write, unknown, unpatronized, unpaid:</L>
<L>Proud of my hone&s;t mu&s;e, by chance has cropp'd</L>
<L>One &s;low'r from that fair wreath which Churchill dropp'd.</L>
<L><PB N="148" REF="013983_0012_0F92599747677260">
Let John&s;on toil for hire, with fal&s;ehoods plea&s;e;</L>
<L>(North's fiat feeds, and dubbs him with degrees.)</L>
<L>His be the &s;hame, the gen'rous tran&s;port mine,</L>
<L>To goad a villain's heart at ev'ry line.</L>
<L>Di&s;daining pidlers, who for flowrets roam,</L>
<L>Like Brutus rough, I'll plant the dagger home.</L>
<L>Tyrants and traitors Ca&s;ca ne'er forgives:</L>
<L>Tremble fuch mon&s;ters whil&s;t that Ca&s;ca lives.</L>
<L>The bla&s;t he blows their guilty &s;ouls &s;hall &s;hock,</L>
<L>And drive them to perdition and the block.</L>
