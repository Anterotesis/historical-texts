<P>THIS fatal, Soul-de&s;troying, GOD-di&s;honouring di&s;ea&s;e, fir&s;t made its appearance in the garden of Eden. It was introduced by that infernal foe to GOD and man, called the devil, the means by which the fir&s;t man came by his death, and that mon&s;ter &s;in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> God and the de&s;truction of man. Satan &s;ucceeding &s;o well by means of this di&s;ea&s;e in the garden of Eden, has, from time to time, attempted to &s;pread the di&s;|order in various parts of our earth, by &s;ending his emi&s;&s;aries with the infection, bound up in a bundle of articles called by them Go&s;pel Truths: but the truth is, they are Antinomian here&s;ies, poi&s;onous in their nature, and pernicious to the &s;ouls of men. The enemy having lately &s;ent from the ea&s;t a bundle of his wares to this city, I thought it my duty to alarm my fellow-citizens of the danger they are in&mdash;the plague having actually broken out,&mdash;&s;ome are already dead, and others in im|minent danger. In order, therefore, to pre&s;erve the &s;ound from the infection, I &s;hall &s;hew &s;ome cau&s;es of the di&s;order, with the means of preventing it from becoming fatal; &s;econdly, the &s;ymptoms attending the di&s;order, and la&s;tly, pre&s;cribe the remedy for &s;uch in
<PB N="2" REF="045169_0002_101FC1A7C36147B8">whom the di&s;order is not rooted&mdash;I &s;ay in whom the di&s;order is not rooted; for in all others, it is probable, means will prove ineffectual, as the Scriptures &s;ay, God &s;hall &s;end them &s;trong delu&s;ion, that they &s;hould be|lieve a lie, &amp;c. 2 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> ii. 11.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the Cau&s;es. This di&s;order is generally pro|duced by an unwhole&s;ome &s;tagnated, putrid air, pro|ceeding from the mouth of the deceivers, foretold by that mo&s;t eminent phy&s;ician of infinite value, JEHO|VAH JESUS, (who told his di&s;ciples there &s;hould ari&s;e fal&s;e prophets, who, if it were po&s;&s;ible, would deceive even the elect.) Hence it prevails in a furnace, &s;ituate in Second between Walnut and Che&s;nut-&s;treets, Phila|delphia, al&s;o in the north ea&s;tern parts of the&s;e &s;tates.</P>
<P N="2">2d Cau&s;e. The perver&s;ion of the word of God by men, or rather preachers, of corrupt minds, who&s;e god is their belly, who&s;e glory is their &s;hame, and who&s;e damnnation &s;lumbereth not.</P>

<P>Self-confident per&s;ons are much in danger of being infected, and tho&s;e of an effeminate weakly habit, in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e; but e&s;pecially tho&s;e good &s;ort of peo|ple who pretend to more charity than is commanded in the Scriptures, are in imminent danger.</P>
<P>Advice to the &s;ound&mdash;Come not within &s;cent of the &s;moke of the furnace. Keep no company with infected per&s;ons except duty calls. Endeavor to keep your minds clean and clear of Antinomian notions; for cleanline&s;s is greatly conducive to health, and to prevent di&s;orders. Exerci&s;e al&s;o is an excellent antidote; therefore, be much in prayer, and reading your Bible, walking in the good old way of JEHOVAH'S commandments daily and hourly.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS. The Murriniti&s;h plague is generally preceded by a remarkable weakne&s;s in the under&s;tand|ing, re&s;pecting the plain, &s;imple truths of the Scrip|tures;
<PB N="3" REF="045169_0003_101FC1AAAFB8B490">as appeared evidently in the ca&s;e of Eve, when, for SURELY, &s;he takes LEST.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Dimne&s;s of &s;ight precedes this fatal di&s;order. The infected cannot &s;ee, throughout the &s;acred volume, one text (among the many hundreds) that &s;peaks again&s;t their beloved &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P N="3">3d. The head of the infected &s;wells amazingly; yea to an enormous &s;ize, &s;o that with truth it may be &s;aid, (according to their conceit of their knowledge) that a boy of three days old has a bigger head than either that of Gog or Magog, which &s;tands in Guildhall, London, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4th. The tongue al&s;o of the infected appears as if it was tipt with &s;ilver; and, being &s;mooth as oil, runs at an amazing rate, but pre&s;ently grows prodigious thick, and &s;peaks great &s;welling words of vanity, crying,&mdash; Peace, Peace, where there is no peace; rejoicing that they are &s;ufficiently wi&s;e to prove, that the primeval cau&s;e of &s;in will at la&s;t be found to lay at the thre&s;hold of Heaven; and con&s;equently, that the whole race of fallen men mu&s;t be redeemed upon the principles of un&s;ullied goodne&s;s. This is a fatal &s;ymptom, and is a certain &s;ign, that the per&s;on is given up to &s;trong delu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="5">5th. A delirium comes on, which ends in mad|ne&s;s, and operates in the following manner&mdash;The in|fected, like another mad dog, runs howling about, trying to bite every one he comes acro&s;s, foaming at the mouth amazingly; they don't act like the prophets dumb dogs, that cannot bark. No&mdash;quite the rever&s;e: they yelp and howl in a tremendous manner, di&s;turbing whole neighbourhoods, and grieving the favorites of Heaven&mdash;As &s;aith the Lord, With lies ye have made the heart of the righteous &s;ad, whom I have not made &s;ad, and &s;trengthened the hands of the wicked, that he &s;hould not return from his wicked way by promi&s;ing him life, <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> xiii. 22. Frequent vomitings &s;uc|ceed their madne&s;s. I am not phy&s;ician enough to &s;ay it is the bile; but it is certainly bitterne&s;s that they throw up in abundance: yet they have &s;o far lo&s;t their
<PB N="4" REF="045169_0004_101FC1B0AC78DB70">ta&s;te, as to conceit that this gall of theirs is &s;weet go&s;|pel truth. They roll the diabolic preparation as a &s;weet mor&s;el under their tongue. Woe unto their &s;ouls, for they have &s;inned; they call evil good, and good evil; bitter &s;weet, and &s;weet bitter. Horrid madne&s;s! At length they become go&s;pel proof, as ap|pears: for if in pity to their &s;ouls, the &s;ervant of Ema|nuel, "knowing the terror of the Lord, per&s;uade" them of the nece&s;&s;ity of a new or &s;econd birth, (like poor mad things indeed) they cry Chri&s;t was born again. Or if we preach and teach the nece&s;&s;ity of re|pentance and faith, they madly an&s;wer, Chri&s;t repented, Chri&s;t believed, &amp;c. "O fooli&s;h people, and unwi&s;e! thus to wre&s;t the Scriptures to their own de&s;truction;" but the Scriptures mu&s;t be fulfilled. For &s;aith the com|pa&s;&s;ionate Saviour, Thou ha&s;t hid the&s;e things from the wi&s;e and prudent, and revealed them unto babes; even &s;o, Father, for &s;o it &s;eemed good in thy &s;ight. No wonder that modern orators and rhetoricians are puz|zled at plain go&s;pel truths, when of old they were to the learned Jews a &s;tumbling block, and to the wi&s;e Greeks fooli&s;hne&s;s. But as the elect cannot be de|ceived, &s;eeing the foundation &s;tandeth &s;ure, we will rejoice, though the world be moved out of its place.</P>
<P>The Murriniti&s;h plague may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Winche&s;trian: ina&s;much as the Murrinites falla|ciou&s;ly profe&s;s Calvini&s;m, and the Winche&s;trians Arme|niani&s;m: again, the Murrinites profe&s;s enmity to the devil, the Winche&s;trians great friend&s;hip&mdash;though it is a query, whether he (the devil) u&s;ed them one bit the better for that.</P>
<P>Winche&s;trian plagues may be converted into Murri|niti&s;h, by the party coming too nigh the &s;moke of the furnace, when well heated. The duration of the Mur|riniti&s;h plague is extremely uncertain. I have heard of one of the infected being extremely ill for &s;everal years, and in his mad fit bit &s;everal, and grievou&s;ly infected them; but toward the clo&s;e of his life, 'tis &s;aid he was
<PB N="5" REF="045169_0005_101FC1B244A88910">perfectly cured. Some, it is to be feared, remain confirmed maniacs, 'till &s;uch time as the flames of the tremendous volcano feelingly convince them, and bring them to their &s;en&s;es to their eternal &s;orrow. The mo&s;t favourable &s;ymptom is a mild &s;weat, coming on in a few days, occa&s;ioned by fears ari&s;ing in the mind, le&s;t the whole &s;y&s;tem &s;hould be fallacious, and they fall with their bottomle&s;s &s;uper&s;tructure into that place, where <HI>hope</HI> never comes; this, I &s;ay, is a &s;ymptom that the di&s;order is not rooted. In &s;uch ca&s;e there is ground to hope, and it is rational to u&s;e proper means for their recovery; but if they foam at the mouth, and endea|vour to bite, and infect others, or if they rave exceed|ingly, when the water of that &s;tream, that makes glad the city of God, is offered to them&mdash;I &s;ay, if they maliciou&s;ly try to &s;pill the water, and endeavour to bite the per&s;on offering it to them, 'tis a fatal &s;ymptom that death is approaching. In &s;uch ca&s;es there is no phy|&s;ician in this country can do them good, though there are &s;everal very eminent, as Mr. Bapti&s;t, Mr. Pre&s;by|terian, Mr. Epi&s;copalian, Mr. Independent, Mr. White|fieldian, &amp;c. &amp;c. The&s;e are very &s;kilful men, and have all &s;tudied, and practi&s;ed with great &s;ucce&s;s under the phy&s;ician of infinite value. But I &s;ay, though they may be able to pre&s;cribe the antidote, yet it will not avail, unle&s;s applied by the &s;kilful hand of the famous, divinely glorious, ineffable phy&s;ician, JESUS CHRIST; and con&s;equently can do them no good. But, as in &s;ome ca&s;es, good may be done, I proceed.</P>
<P>Regimen. In the management of this di&s;order we ought to endeavour to counteract the putrid tendency of the humours, by geatly promoting per&s;piration, that is, if po&s;&s;ible, to bring on a warm &s;weat, produced from the con&s;ideration afore-mentioned.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. It has been ob&s;erved, that the Murriniti&s;h plague is generally occa&s;ioned by unwhole&s;ome air, and of cour&s;e it mu&s;t be greatly aggrevated by it; care mu&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="045169_0006_101FC1B6D36681C8">therefore be taken, that no Murriniti&s;h bellows be al|lowed in the mad per&s;on's chamber; al&s;o I advi&s;e, that no infected per&s;on be left alone with the di&s;ea&s;ed, le&s;t in his mad fits he &s;hut to the door, and blow the Mur|riniti&s;h bellows, and the putrid air &s;tagnate, which will greatly increa&s;e the malady; but rather let there be a frequent admi&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h and whole&s;ome air conveyed by the means of a &s;ervant of the <HI>&s;anctuary, blowing through the genuine &s;ilver trumpet of uncorrupted truth.</HI> The pa|tient's head ought to be frequently &s;prinkled with the a&s;hes of Sodom and Gomorrah, if they can be obtained, and his mind with ideas of everla&s;ting fire; al&s;o pictures of the damned ought to be placed round the room, and every &s;trong &s;cented herb that can be got from Sinai's mount, laid in different parts of the hou&s;e, and &s;melled to by tho&s;e that go near the patient. A &s;mall quantity of Jeremiah's wormwood and gall ought frequently to be injected into his mind: this is a great a&s;tringent, and &s;hould be mixed in all his food as well as drink. The patient mu&s;t have his head kept moderately cool, and as free as po&s;&s;ible from Antinomian notions. His food mu&s;t be light, &s;uch as the milk of the word, and not &s;trong meat, for he will not be able to bear it: he may eat roa&s;ted apples, provided they be taken from the apple tree of the go&s;pel; and as to his drink, I would recommend the juice of this excellent fruit above all others.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, Medicine. A vomit is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in the beginning of the di&s;order; however, I would not recommend a do&s;e of Tartar emetic, but rather take three &s;cruples of right rea&s;on, one grain of con&s;ideration, and a quarter of an ounce of common &s;en&s;e, make them into a bolus, and force him to &s;wallow it, if po&s;|&s;ible, (though depend upon it, it will go much again&s;t him; and I dare venture to &s;ay, if it can be got down, it will pre&s;ently make him ca&s;t the bile, or rather the diabolic bitterne&s;s from his &s;tomach. As to bli&s;tering, I would by no means recommend it; for if the patient
<PB N="7" REF="045169_0007_101FC1B85A684100">comes to his &s;en&s;es, he will be &s;ufficiently &s;ore, e&s;pe|cially when he reflects on the great di&s;honour he has done to religion. But the only &s;overeign remedy is in the chief phy&s;ician's hands, and &s;olely at his di&s;po&s;al; the lea&s;t grain of which, yea, if divided into ten thou|&s;and parts, and one of tho&s;e parts divided into ten thou&s;and more, ad infinitum,&mdash;I &s;ay, if the &s;malle&s;t of the&s;e parts be received into the patient's heart, it will not fail of making a perfect cure. This medi|cine is given gratis to all who a&s;k for it, by the propri|etor, at the &s;ign of the Fountain opened for &s;in and for uncleanne&s;s. But as it is likely the patient will be deterred from making application, by rea&s;on of a vain conceit, that he already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a &s;ufficient quantity, which the di&s;ea&s;e naturally inclines him to)&mdash;It will therefore evidence a generous mind in tho&s;e, who are &s;till pre&s;erved from the pernicious infection, to make application to the good phy&s;ician on his behalf; and who knows but he may &s;end by their hand, and make them in&s;trumental in delivering their peri&s;hing fellow|mortal from that which is infinitely wor&s;e than the plagues of Egypt,&mdash;the Murriniti&s;h &s;y&s;tem of &s;atanical divinity.</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;ome may a&s;k, why &s;o &s;atirical? I an&s;wer, becau&s;e Solomon hath &s;aid, An&s;wer a fool according to his folly; and as it is evident the&s;e unhappy people have done with both &s;cripture and rea&s;on, as appears by their treating, with the greate&s;t contempt, the mo&s;t &s;olid, convincing arguments made u&s;e of by very able mini&s;ters of the New Te&s;tament,&mdash;I therefore thought it be&s;t for me to follow Elijah's example; and, in this mode, bear te&s;timony again&s;t this pernicious <HI>error</HI> of the day. I expect to be cen&s;ured by the Univer&s;al Antinomians, as they are a people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a more than ordinary degree of charity, and &s;ometimes take an odd way to &s;hew their love; but I defy them to u&s;e me wor&s;e than their &s;y&s;tem doth my ma&s;ter <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> For, brethren, be not deceived; God is not mocked: what
<PB N="8" REF="045169_0008_101FC1BB35A9B390">a man &s;ows, that &s;hall he al&s;o reap. There is a day&mdash;a dreadful day&mdash;coming, that &s;hall burn as an oven, and all the proud <HI>(boa&s;ters)</HI> and all they that wickedly depart from the truth, &s;hall be as &s;tubble, yea as fuel, on which that eternal fire will mo&s;t &s;urely kindle, and which will <HI>never, never, never</HI> be extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>It is, then, the infinitely ble&s;&s;ed, the greatly injured, the awfully belied maje&s;ty of Heaven, will prove to the overla&s;ting &s;hame of every enemy of truth, that his throne is e&s;tabli&s;hed in ju&s;tice and judgment&mdash;Then the be&s;otted <HI>Antinomian</HI> will be feelingly convinced, that his damnation lies at his own door, and that the <HI>Lord</HI> tempteth no man to &s;in, much le&s;s forceth angels nor man, by an irrevocable decree, to do that which his holy foul hateth. <HI>James</HI> i. xiii, xiv. Let no man &s;ay, when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lu&s;t, and enticed. Horrid thought! to think or &s;ay, that God is the author of &s;in!</P>
<P>Oh! my &s;oul come not near their dwelling! Lord; what is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">; half <HI>bea&s;t,</HI> half <HI>devil;</HI> but he might with propriety have &s;aid, that the <HI>natural</HI> man is <HI>whole devil,</HI> and &s;poke within the bounds of charity too. But I forbear.&mdash;<HI>God is judge</HI> him&s;elf, and will take <HI>vengeance</HI> on his enemies, and cut off tho&s;e in due time, that trouble his church. <HI>But the ran&s;omed of the Lord &s;hall he &s;aved with an everla&s;ting &s;alvation, to the prai&s;o of his glorious grace, world without end.</HI> Amen.</P>
