<HEAD>A <HI>NARRATIVE,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<P>_LIEUTENANT Governor <HI>Colden</HI> re|pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty and Privy Council, that it would be greatly to the Advantage of the Inhabitants of the Di&s;trict of Land to the We&s;t|ward of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, which had been granted by the Government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> to be under the Juri&s;diction of the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> and that <HI>Connecticut</HI> River was a good and certain Boundary line to divide the re&s;pective Provinces; and furthermore, that <HI>Hud&s;on's</HI> River was naviga|ble a great Way into the Country; and that the Situation of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Grants was &s;uch as would naturally con&s;titute that River the Centre of Trade and Commerce, for the Inhabitants of tho&s;e Grants; by the Navigation of which they could ea&s;ily &s;end Exports to the City of <HI>New-York,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="013102_0003_0F8EBBDE797C0C98">and receive and return &s;uch Articles as they need|ed: And that it would therefore be much more convenient and happy for them to be under the Juri&s;diction of <HI>New-York,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>WITH Re&s;pect to the Southwe&s;t Part of the Di&s;|trict of Land afore&s;aid it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that <HI>Hud&s;on's</HI> River mu&s;t <Q>con&s;titute the Centre of Trade,</Q> &amp;c. to the Inhabitants thereof. But Three Qurters or more of that Di&s;trict of di&s;puted Lands, from the Contiguou&s;ne&s;s thereof to Lake Champlain, and remote Situation from <HI>Hud&s;on's</HI> River, equally con&s;titute Lake Champlain, Mon|treal, &amp;c. the Centre of Trade for its Inhabitants.&mdash;Furthermore, it is no Way incompatable, pro|vided the Inhabitants of the Southwe&s;t Quarter of the Di&s;trict afore&s;aid &s;hould Trade at <HI>New-York,</HI> although they may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be under the Juri&s;diction of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire.</HI> The following Exhibitions, will undoubtedly convince the impar|tial Reader that the &s;aid Inhabitants would be under va&s;tly greater Advantage, to trade at <HI>New-York,</HI> or any where el&s;e, on Provi&s;o they &s;hould be re-annexed to the Government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire;</HI> for then they would peaceably enjoy the Right of &s;oil of Lands they po&s;&s;e&s;s, which, under the Juri&s;|diction of <HI>New-York</HI> they cannot. A Number of Families that have &s;pent their Sub&s;tance in pur|cha&s;ing Lands of the Government of <HI>New-Hamp|&s;hire,</HI> and in removing from a great Di&s;tance to the Premi&s;es, and in making Improvements thereon; provided they &s;hould be di&s;inherited, would make a very indifferent Figure trading at <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="013102_0004_0F8EBBDF4511CE48">
HIS Maje&s;ty, ever graciou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed to pro|mote the Intere&s;t and Good of his Subjects, and viewing the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the juri&s;dictional Line between the re&s;pective Governments, as not interfering with the private Property of his Sub|jects, and in this View of the Ca&s;e, perceiving a manife&s;t Convenience, at lea&s;t for a Part of that Di&s;trict, to be annexed to the Province of <HI>New-York;</HI> and the Government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> not being notified of Tryal (which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be owing to the Neglect of their Agent) by which Means his Maje&s;ty and Council could have no In|formation but from the Repre&s;entations from <HI>New-York;</HI> came to a Determination of the juri&s;dicti|onal Line <HI>Exparte;</HI> which is probably the Cau&s;e why it extended &s;o far Ea&s;t as the we&s;t Banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River. This Event proved exceeding unfortunate to the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Settlers: From which they may compute the Date of their Oppre&s;|&s;ion from the Government of <HI>New-York;</HI> this put it in the Power of that crafty, de&s;inging, &amp; monopo|lizing Government, to exerci&s;e that U&s;urpation towards the Inhabitants afore&s;aid, exhibited in the following Sheets.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had <HI>New-York</HI> obtained the Juri&s;dic|tion, than Governor <HI>Colden</HI> began to Patent, to cer|tain celebrated Attornies and principal Gentleman in the Province, the very Lands on which the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Settlers dwelt; and it is a more inex|cu&s;able and complicated Wickedne&s;s in Governor <HI>Colden;</HI> ina&s;much as but a little before he per&s;waded his graciou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed Maje&s;ty into an Opinion
<PB N="6" REF="013102_0005_0F8EBBE019535278">that it would be for the Advantage and Happine&s;s of the Settlers aforesaid to be under the Juri&s;dicti|on of <HI>New-York.</HI> A complaint of the Conduct of the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> relative to their lay|ing Patent upon Patent, as afore&s;aid, being laid be|fore his Maje&s;ty, who with the Advice of his Privy Council was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to prohibit the Go|vernment of <HI>New-York</HI> from Patenting any of the &s;aid Di&s;trict of Land patented by the Governor of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> as afore&s;aid, on Pain of his Maje&s;|ty's highe&s;t Di&s;plea&s;ure. Notwith&s;tanding, the &s;ame Lieutenant Governor <HI>Colden,</HI> Governor <HI>Dun|more,</HI> and Governor <HI>Tryon,</HI> have, each and every of them, in their re&s;pective Turns in the Admini&s;tra|tion, pre&s;umed to violate the &s;aid Royal Command, by Patenting to certain of their own Favourites and Gentlemen of Influence, &s;undry valuable Tracts of Land contained in, and belonging to the prohi|bited Premi&s;es; the mo&s;t of which Land being at the Time of patenting in actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Oc|cupancy by People claiming the &s;ame Lands by Virtue of prior Patents from the Government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>NEXTLY, in the Cour&s;e of this Narrative it is nece&s;&s;ary to take a retro&s;pective View to July Term, in the Year 1769, at which the Claimants under <HI>New-York,</HI> being Non-re&s;idents, brought Actions of Ejectment in the Supreme Court again&s;t &s;undry of the Claimants under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> who were in actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the conte&s;ted Pre|mi&s;es: but part if not all of the Judges and At|tornies being intere&s;ted in the &s;aid &s;ub&s;equent Pa|tents
<PB N="7" REF="013102_0006_0F8EBBE4505B58F0">from the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> and &s;ome of the principal Attornies, Patentees of the iden|tical Patents then on Tryal. And the Plaintiffs ap|pearing in great Fa&s;hion and State, which, toge|ther with their Fraternity of Land-monopolizers, made a briliant Appearance. But the Defendants appearing in but ordinary Fa&s;hion, having been greatly fatigued by hard Labour, wrought on the di&s;puted Premi&s;es, made a very di&s;proportionable Figure at Court; and, in fine, Intere&s;t, Connection, and Grandeur, ea&s;ily turned the Ca&s;e again&s;t the forlorn Defendants: The whole Di&s;trict of Inha|bitants were greatly alarm'd at the Event that had begun to take Place, were in great Con&s;ternation, each Individual reading his own intolerable Di&s;|truction from that which had already began.</P>
<P>STILL there was more Actions of Ejectment commenced again&s;t &s;undry of the Inhabitants, and the Sheriff of Albany County, by &s;pecial Order from the Governor, was rai&s;ing the Militia of the County to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the Defendants afore&s;aid, of their Tenements. This was a mo&s;t melancholy Scene&mdash;Women lamenting over their Children, and they crying; and Men pierced to the Heart with the mo&s;t pungent Grief and Affection for them, and bitter Indignation at the approaching Tyranny of <HI>New-York.</HI> And what renders the Reflection of the Conflict more doleful, is the Con|&s;ideration of the extreme Fatigue, Hunger, and infinite Hard&s;hips the Inhabitants had undergone in the Settlement and Cultivation of a Wilderne&s;s Country: It &s;till adds a twinge to the Smart to
<PB N="8" REF="013102_0007_0F8EBBE5EF97B740">take a retro&s;pect on the Interim; and view the At|tornies and wealthy Gentlemen in the Province (and mo&s;t of them in the City) of <HI>New-York</HI> "which fared &s;umptuou&s;ly every Day" peru&s;ing the old ob&s;olete and abdicated Charter from King Charles to the Duke of York, and in&s;pecting into the <HI>Ca|bots</HI> and <HI>Hud&s;on's</HI> exploring this Continent; and withal, in&s;pecting clo&s;ely, whether in ancient Time &s;ome Dutchman had not Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome part of the abdicated Premi&s;es; and by &s;uch round-about and &s;alacious Pretences of deducing a Title, plan|ing the Ruin of the Inhabitants afore&s;aid.&mdash;But to return to the Sheriff and the Po&s;&s;e of <HI>Albany</HI> County, who were in motion to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the In|habitants, Defendants afore&s;aid, and deliver their Tenements to the Claimants under <HI>New-York.</HI> The Inhabitants being thus drove to the Extremity of either quiting their Country and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, or make forceable Oppo&s;ition to the Sheriff and Po&s;&s;e. In this State of De&s;peracy they put on Fortitude, and cho&s;e the latter Expedient, and managed with that Oeconomy that they defeated the Sheriff in di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them, without Blood&s;hed: Though it &s;hould be confe&s;&s;ed that this Event was but partly owing to the Fortitude of the Inhabitants; the greate&s;t Rea&s;on was this, the People of the Go|vernment in general (but particularly tho&s;e that compo&s;e the Po&s;&s;e of the &s;aid County of <HI>Albany</HI>) were fully per&s;waded and con&s;cious, that the Cau&s;e of the Inhabitants was ju&s;t; and that the <HI>New-York</HI> Patentees was Oppre&s;&s;ive and unju&s;t: And there|fore they would not hazard their lives to defend
<PB N="9" REF="013102_0008_0F8EBACD48F096E8">them in &s;uch an U&s;urpation of the Rights of their fellow Men.</P>
<P>THERE had before this time been &s;everal le&s;&s;er Combinations of the People of tho&s;e Grants to defend their Per&s;ons and Properties from the En|croachments of <HI>New-York,</HI> which by them are call|ed by the opprobrious Names of Riots, Mobs, Re|bellion, Felony, &amp;c&mdash;After the ineffectual Mu&s;|ter of the Po&s;&s;e, the Land-Monopolizers in the Colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> adopted different Mea&s;ures to accompli&s;h their De&s;igns; perceiving they could not rai&s;e a Militia, that would Fight for the Title of their Sub&s;equent Patents, and they being a cringing, fawnig, deceitful Fraternity; not enured to the Horrors of War, or any thing Heroic, dur&s;t not Fight for their own Claims: Their accu&s;tom|ed Way, to carry Paints, being to deceive, cheat and over reach the Commonality of their Species, under a Pretence of Law, Ju&s;tice, good Govern|ment, and a great pretended Zeal of Loyalty, &amp;c. They were therefore obliged to follow their old beaten Road of Politics, and by their Influence, cau&s;ed to be indicted as Rioters, every of the mo&s;t bold, &s;pirited and leading Men, who were active in defending either their Country or them&s;elves, again&s;t their mo&s;t egregious and intreiguing Wiles; hopeing to make &s;uch an Example of them there|by as to frighten the Re&s;t into their de&s;potic Mea|&s;ures.&mdash;The Inhabitants in general viewing this to be their Policy, guarded again&s;t it, and were active in defending them&s;elves, their Friends and Neigh|bours &s;o indicted, being fully per&s;waded that the
<PB N="10" REF="013102_0009_0F8EBBE85EF811F0">Fraternity of <HI>New-York</HI> Patentees were the Fomen|ters and Planers of tho&s;e Indictments; and that they eventually, by &s;uch Stratagems, de&s;igned to avail them&s;elves of the Fee-&s;imple of the Lands which they, the afore&s;aid Inhabitants po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. And as for the <HI>New-York</HI> Patentees, and &s;uch part of the Authority and People as they could Influ|ence, they were active, endeavouring by all and every Method to apprehend the Rioters (&s;o called) and puni&s;h them as Criminals: The Struggles that en&s;ued between the Parties relative to taking and defending Rioters, terminated in Wrath, Strife, and Ill-Will: The Con&s;equences ari&s;ing therefrom, (which are too prolix to be in&s;erted) are very ingeniou&s;ly &s;ummed up in the&s;e Words, "Where Envying and Strife is, there is Confu|&s;ion and every Evil Work." Tho' it is common (and almo&s;t without Exception) for both Parties to be more or le&s;s blameable in &s;o long and &s;pirited a Controver&s;y; yet in the In&s;tances before us, it is beyond Di&s;pute certain, that the Yorkers act offen&s;ively, and the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Settlers de|fen&s;ively, which will more fully appear.</P>
<P>BUT to &s;horten this Narration, and yet make it intelligible, and exhibit to View, that tho&s;e Gentlemen intere&s;ted in the Lands contained in the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Grants, by &s;ub&s;equent Pa|tents from the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> have extended their Influence into the General A&s;&s;em|bly of the Government, and &s;way that whole Le|gi&s;lative Body; the following Votes and Pro|ceedings of that A&s;&s;embly are here tran&s;cribed;

<P>"THE candid Reader will doubtle&s;s ob&s;erve, that in the Re&s;olves of the A&s;&s;embly afore|&s;aid, there is not a &s;ingle Word mentioned in Re|gard to the Title of the Land conte&s;ted for, but that they level all their Spleen, and point all their Malice at notorious Rioters, as they call them, and make a pretended Shew and Figure, as though they were great Sticklers for good Order and Government; although at the &s;ame Time every Per&s;on of common Sen&s;e, who has had any Ac|quaintance and Knowledge of the Controver&s;y, ab&s;olutely knows, that our goodly Land, with the Labour thereon, is the only &s;ubject Matter, and grand Object of the whole Controver&s;y; and give the <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> but that, and the Matter would be accompli&s;hed to their eternal Satisfaction; and it is pre&s;umed the Words Riotous, Di&s;orderly, Licentious, &amp;c. would not be printed again on account of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Grantees and pre|&s;ent Occupants, for the whole Cour&s;e of the &s;uc|ceeding Century.</P>

<P>"NOTWITHSTANDING this Prohibition, and one or two more of the &s;ame general Import, and from the &s;ame Authority, the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> have lapped their Patents on the <HI>New-Hamp|&s;hire</HI> Charters, and in Con&s;equence thereof demand at Common Law, the Lands on which the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Grantees and Occupants dwell; and from hence has ari&s;en the numerous Troubles and Di&s;turbances, between the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> and its di&s;contented Subjects, the Settlers under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire.</HI> This has al&s;o been the Source of all Licentiou&s;ne&s;s and Confu&s;ion, Riot|ou&s;ne&s;s, &amp;c. complained of by that Government, again&s;t the Settlers afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>"AND whereas the true State of our Grants hath been already laid before the worthy Lords of the Board of Trade and Plantation, and they hav|ing con&s;idered, and wi&s;ely deliberated upon its &s;everal Circum&s;tances, did on the Third Day of December, A.

<P>"We therefore humbly report to the &s;aid General Committee of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Grants, as our Opinion, 1. That as we ever have, &s;o for the future we will remain loyal and dutiful Subjects,

<P N="2">"2, THAT as we purcha&s;ed our Lands of One of his Maje&s;ty's Governors, and on the good Faith of the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> we are determin|ed to maintain tho&s;e Grants, again&s;t all Oppo|&s;ition, until his Maje&s;ty's Royal Plea&s;ure &s;hall be known on the Premi&s;es.</P>

We therefore re&s;olve, That as a Country, we will &s;tand by, and defend our Friends and Neighbours, &s;o indicted, at the Expence of our Lives and Fortunes. And we would recommend it to the General A&s;&s;embly of the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> to wait the Determination of his Maje&s;ty, relative to the Title of tho&s;e Lands, and de&s;i&s;t from taking us as Rioters, to prevent the unhap|py Con&s;equences that may re&s;ult from &s;uch an At|tempt.</P>
<P>"AND Fourthly, and la&s;tly, Re&s;olved, That for the future, every nece&s;&s;ary Preparation be made, and that our Inhabitants hold them&s;elves in Rea|dine&s;s, at a Minute's Warning, to aid and defend &s;uch Friends of our's, who, for their Merit to the great and general Cau&s;e, are fal&s;ely denominated Rioters; but that we will not act any Thing, more or le&s;s, but on the Defen&s;ive, and always encour|age due Execution of Law, in civil Ca&s;es, and al&s;o in criminal Pro&s;ecutions, that are &s;o indeed; and that we will a&s;&s;i&s;t, to the utmo&s;t of our Power, the Officers appointed for that Purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>HIS Excellency Governor <HI>Tryon</HI> in Conformity to the Addre&s;&s;es of the General A&s;&s;embly of the Colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> having on the 9th Day of March 1774, with the Advice of his Council, i&s;|&s;ued his Proclamation, offering therein large Sums of Money, for the Purpo&s;e of apprehending and

<P>AND whereas, his Excellency the Governor, by the &s;ame Proclamation, hath &s;trictly enjoined and commanded all Magi&s;trates, Ju&s;tices of the Peace, Sheriffs, and other civil Officers of the Counties of <HI>Albany</HI> and <HI>Charlotte,</HI> to be active and vigilant in apprehending, and impri&s;oning the Per&s;ons above named; and we the afore&s;aid Per&s;ons, who have hereunto &s;ub&s;cribed, being con&s;cious that our Cau&s;e is good and equitable, in the Sight of GOD, and all unprejudiced and hone&s;t Men, are determined at all Events, to maintain, and defend the &s;ame, 'till his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure &s;hall be known, concerning the Validity of the <HI>New-Hamp|&s;hire</HI> Grants.&mdash;And we now proclaim to the Public, not only for Our&s;elves, but for the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Grantees, and Occupants in general; that the Spring and moving Cau&s;e of our Oppo|&s;ition to the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> was Self-Pre&s;ervation, viz. Fir&s;tly, the Pre&s;ervation and maintaining of our Property: And Secondly, &s;ince that Government is &s;o incen&s;ed again&s;t us, there|fore it &s;tands us in Hand to defend our Lives; for it appears, by a late Set of Laws pa&s;&s;ed by the Legi&s;lature thereof, that the Lives, and Pro|perty of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Settlers are manife&s;tly &s;truck at; but, that the Public may rightly un|der&s;tand the E&s;&s;ence of the Controver&s;y, we now proclaim to tho&s;e Law-Givers, and to the World,

It is well known by all wi&s;e and &s;en|&s;ible Per&s;ons in the neighbouring Governments, (that have animadverted on the Controver&s;y) that their pretended Zeal for good Order and Govern|ment, is fallacious, and that they aim at the Lands and Labours of the Grantees and Settlers afore|&s;aid: and that they &s;ubvert the good and whole&s;ome Laws of the Realm, to corroborate with, and bring about their vile and mercenary Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>AND, ina&s;much as the Malignity of their Di&s;|po&s;ition towards us, hath flamed to an immea|&s;urable and murtherous Degree, they have in their new-fangled Laws, calculated for the meri|dian of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Grants, pa&s;&s;ed the 9th of March, 1774; &s;o calculated them, as to cor|re&s;pond with the depravedne&s;s of their Minds and Morals; in them Laws, they have exhibited their
<PB N="39" REF="013102_0038_0F8EBC055FB8E538">genuine Pictures. The Emblems of their in&s;a|tiable, avaricious, overbearing, inhuman, barba|rous, and blood-guiltine&s;s of Di&s;po&s;ition and In|tention is therein portraited in that tran&s;parent Image of them&s;elves, which cannot fail to be a Blot, and an infamous Reproach to them, to Po&s;terity.&mdash;We cannot &s;uppo&s;e that every of his Maje&s;ty's Council, or that all the Members of the General A&s;&s;embly were active in pa&s;&s;ing &s;o bloody and uncon&s;titutional a Set of Laws; un|doubtedly, &s;ome of them di&s;approved thereof; and it is altogether po&s;&s;ible, that many that were active in making the Law, were impo&s;ed upon by fal&s;e Repre&s;entations, and acted under mi&s;taken Views of doing Honour to Government; but be this as it will, it appears that there was a Majority. And it has been too much the Ca&s;e with that Go|vernment, for a Number of de&s;igning Schemers, and Land-Jockeys, to rule the &s;ame. Let us take a View of their former narrow and circum&s;crib|ed Boundaries, and how, by Legerdemain, Bri|bery and Deceptions of one Sort or other, they have extended their Domain far and wide; they have wrangled with, and encroached on all their neighbouring Governments, and have u&s;ed all Manner of Deceit and Fraud to accompli&s;h their De&s;igns: Their Tenants groan under their U&s;u|ry and Oppre&s;&s;ion; and they have gained, as well as merited the Di&s;approbation and Abhorrence of their Neighbours, and the innocent Blood they have already &s;hed, calls for Heaven's Vengeance on their guilty Heads; and if they &s;hould come forth in arms again&s;t us, thou&s;ands of their injur|ed

<P>THIS Piece is not &s;uppo&s;ed to contain a full An|&s;wer to the new con&s;tructed Set of Laws afore&s;aid; for &s;uch a large TWO-YEAR OLD, hath never be|fore been &s;een in America, it being of an enor|mous and mon&s;trous Birth; nor is it &s;uppo&s;ed to give the Legi&s;lators their full Characters: But &s;o much, and a little more may &s;uffice for the pre&s;ent. To quote the Laws, and make Remarks thereon, would be Matter &s;ufficient for a Volume: Howe|ver, we will yet make &s;ome few &s;hort Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, NEGATIVELY, it is not a Law for the Pro|vince of <HI>New-York</HI> in general, but,</P>
<P N="2">2d, POSITIVELY, it is a Law but for Part of the Counties of <HI>Charlotte,</HI> and <HI>Albany;</HI> viz. Such Parts thereof, as are covered with the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> CHARTERS, and it is well known tho&s;e Grants com|po&s;e but a minor Part of the Inhabitants of the &s;aid Province; and we have no Repre&s;entative in that A&s;|&s;embly: The fir&s;t Knowledge we had of &s;aid Laws, was the Completion of them; which informed us, that if we a&s;&s;embled, Three or more of us together, to oppo&s;e (that which they call legal) Authority, we &s;hall be adjudged Felons, and &s;uffer the Pains of Death; and that &s;ame Fraternity of Plotters knew, as well as we, and the generality of the People in the adjacent Colonies, that they have for a Num|ber
<PB N="41" REF="013102_0040_0F8EBC0852A233E0">of Years la&s;t pa&s;t, endeavoured to exerci&s;e &s;uch a Cour&s;e of what they call Law, that had they not been oppo&s;ed by the People of the&s;e Grants (called the MOB) in the executing the &s;ame, they would before this Time, have been in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Territory, for which the Laws afore&s;aid are calculated. Therefore the Ca&s;e &s;tands thus: If we oppo&s;e civil Officers, in taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our Farms, we are, by the&s;e Laws, denominated Fe|lons; or if we defend our Neighbours, who have been indicted Rioters, only for defending our Pro|perty; we are likewi&s;e adjudged Felons. In fine, every Oppo&s;ition to their monarchial Government is deemed Felony, and at the End of every &s;uch Sen|tence there is the Word DEATH!

<P>"IT may be the Reader, not having &s;een the Law referred to in this Piece, and not being thoroughly acquainted with the long and &s;pirited Conflict that hath &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the Claimants under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> and <HI>New-York,</HI> nor of the Progre&s;&s;ive, Arbitrary and Monopolizing di&s;po&s;i|tion of the Court Party of the latter of tho&s;e Pro|vinces; may be apt to imagine that the Spirit of this Writing is too &s;evere, ina&s;much as it De&s;tines whoever pre&s;umes to take us as Felons or Rioters, to immediate Death; but let the Wi&s;e con&s;ider the State of the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. PROVIDED we on our Part be taken, we have by them Laws the Sentence of Death already pro|nounced again&s;t us, on Provi&s;o more than Three of us a&s;&s;emble together to maintain and defend our Property, till his Maje&s;ty determines the Contro|ver&s;y. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. MAY it be con&s;idered, that the Legi&s;lative Authority of the Province of <HI>New-York</HI> had no con&s;titutional Right or Power to make &s;uch Laws, and con&s;equently that they are Null and Void, from the Nature and Energy of the Engli&s;h Con|&s;titution; therefore as they merit no Place among the Laws of the Realm of Great-Britain, but are the arbitrary League and Combination of our bit|ter and mercile&s;s Enemies, who, to obtain our Pro|perty, have inhumanly, barbarou&s;ly, and malici|ou&s;ly,
<PB N="47" REF="013102_0046_0F8EBC0D1C46A1D8">under the &s;pecious and hypocritical Pre|tence of legal Authority, and Veneration for Order and Government, have laid a Snare for our Lives. Can the Public cen&s;ure us for exerting Our&s;elves nervou&s;ly to pre&s;erve our Lives in &s;o critical a Situa|tion? For by the Laws of the Province, into which we are unfortunately fallen, we cannot be protected in either Property or Life, except we give up the Former to &s;ecure the Latter; &s;o we are re&s;olved to maintain both, or to hazard or loo&s;e both.</P>
<P>FROM hence follows a nece&s;&s;ary Inference, That ina&s;much as our Property, nay our Lives, cannot be protected (but manife&s;tly &s;truck at) by the highe&s;t Authority in the Province to which we at pre&s;ent belong; therefore in the Interim, while his Maje&s;ty is determining the Controver&s;y, and till he &s;hall interpo&s;e his Royal Authory, and &s;ubject the Authority above&s;aid to their Duty, or re-annex the Di&s;trict of di&s;puted Lands to the Province of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> or &s;ome Way in his great Wi&s;dom and Fatherly Clemency, put the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Settlers under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> on an equal Footing with our Brother Subjects in his Realm; we are under Nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;i&s;ting, even unto Blood, every Per|&s;on who may attempt to take us as Felons or Riot|ers as afore&s;aid; for in this Ca&s;e it is not re&s;i&s;ting Law, but only oppo&s;ing Force by Force; therefore ina&s;much as by the Oppre&s;&s;ions afore&s;aid, the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Settlers are reduced to the di&s;agreeable State of Anarchy and Confu&s;ion; in which State we hope for Wi&s;dom, Patience and Fortitude, till

<P>"The Alteration of Juri&s;diction in 1764 could not effect private Property: Surely his Maje&s;ty by this Alteration, did not purpo&s;e to take away the per&s;onal Property of a large Number of his loyal Subjects, and transfer it to other Subjects; the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution will by no Means admit of this, for the transferring or alienation of Property is a &s;acred Prerogative of the true Owner.&mdash;Kings and Governors cannot intermeddle therewith.

<P>"FURTHERMORE, in the Time of Sir Henry Moor's Admini&s;tration, his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to lay the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> under ab&s;oluto Prohibition not to grant or patent any of the Lands antecedently granted under the Great Seal of the Province of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and Further|more
<PB N="62" REF="013102_0061_0F8EBC1FF0367FB0">forbid the Government to di&s;turb or mole&s;t the Settlers. This rightly under&s;tood, amounts to a Supercedies over the Authority of Common Law, and ab&s;olutely controuls the Cognizance thereof. As to the particular Matters in the Pro|hibition &s;et forth, or Matters lying before his Ma|je&s;ty by Petition, the Import of the Prohibition mu&s;t needs be thus, Namely, that his Maje&s;ty, by it in|forms the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> that he has taken the Controver&s;y to him made known by Pe|tition, under his Royal Con&s;ideration, and that, after due Information and Evidence of the State of the Ca&s;e, determines to &s;ettle the Controver&s;y; con&s;equently forbids the Government taking Cog|nizance thereof; and Common Sen&s;e teaches us that under &s;uch Prohibition, if a Judgment at Common Law be &s;uppo&s;ed to be valid, it would invalidate the Authority of the Crown, and &s;ubvert and overthrow the Authority of the Kingdom, as it would render the Prohibitions of the Crown per|fectly impertinent. Therefore Common Law, in the Ca&s;e before us, is not cloathed with Cogni|zance of this Ca&s;e, much le&s;s with Authority to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s us; con&s;equently every Party of Men that have with Officers or otherwi&s;e, come into the&s;e Parts to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s us, came in open Defiance and direct Oppo&s;ition to his Maje&s;ty's Orders and Authority: And tho' they &s;tile us Rioters, for oppo&s;ing them, and &s;eek to catch and puni&s;h us as &s;uch, yet in Reality, them&s;elves are the Rioters, the tumultuous, di&s;orderly, &s;timulating Faction, or, in fine, the Land-robbers; and every violent Act they have done to compa&s;s their De&s;igns, tho' ever

Can any Man, in the Exerci&s;e of Rea&s;on make him&s;elf believe that a Number of Attornies and other Gentlemen, with all their Tackle of Orna|ments, and Compliments, and French Fine&s;&s;e, to|gether with their boa&s;ted Legality of Law, that the&s;e Gentlemen have ju&s;t Right to the Lands Labours and Fortunes of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Set|tlers?

Such di&s;ingenuous and di&s;honourable Proceedings, I view with great Concern, con&s;idering them as daring In&s;ults to Government, a Violation of public Faith, and the Conditions granted to you on Petition. To prevent therefore the fatal Con&s;equence that mu&s;t follow &s;o manife&s;t a Breach of public Confidence, I am to require your A&s;&s;i&s;tance, in putting forth|with tho&s;e Families who have been thus di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed, into Re-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Lands and Tene|ments,

<SALUTE>"<HI>May it plea&s;e your Excellency,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE his Maje&s;ty's leige and loyal Subjects, In|habitants of <HI>Bennington,</HI> and the adjacent Country, have received your Excellency's Letter, of the 11th of Augu&s;t In&s;tant, by which we are in|form'd of your Excellency's high Di&s;plea&s;ure to|wards us, by Rea&s;on of a Body of our People's di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;everal Settlers on <HI>Otter-Creek,</HI> and its Neighbourhood, of their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, during the very Time our Me&s;&s;engers attended on your Excellency at <HI>New-York,</HI> and were waiting the Determination of Government, on our Petition, that we might remain unmole&s;ted in our Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, till the King's Plea&s;ure could be obtained. Your Excellency further informs us, that you Look on our late Proceedings with great Concern, viewing them as daring In&s;ults to Government, a Violation
<PB N="71" REF="013102_0070_0F8EBC26756AB2A8">of public Faith, and the Conditions granted to our Petition. We would with proper Submi&s;&s;ion, give your Excellency and Council, a &s;hort Narra|tive of Facts, with a few Reflections and Rea&s;ons thereon. And,</P>
<P>"FIRST, we would ob&s;erve, That our Me&s;&s;en|gers your Excellency &s;tiles Commi&s;&s;ioners, was not authorized to e&s;tabli&s;h, and compleat Articles of public Faith for their Con&s;tituents. The Bu&s;i|ne&s;s a&s;&s;ign'd them, was to deliver the written Peti|tion, and inform your Excellency and Council of the Facts of the Controver&s;y &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, and fur|ther negociate and forward the Matter of our Peti|tion, and return to us the Determination of Go|vernment, re&s;erving to Our&s;elves the Power of a&s;&s;enting to, or di&s;&s;enting therefrom, tho' true it is, when the Articles of amicable Settlement, or Order of Government was read at a public Meeting held at <HI>Bennington,</HI> on the 15th Day of July Ultimo, the &s;aid Order and Propo&s;als were univer&s;ally complied with by tho&s;e pre&s;ent: From which Time we rea&s;onably Compute the Date of public Faith, and &s;acred Bond of Friend&s;hip, but in the Interim, the Conditions of Faith was forming, and before a Ratification thereof, Mr. <HI>Kockburn,</HI> a noted Surveyor, unknown (as we &s;uppo&s;e) to your Excellency, and Council, who, by the Con|trivance, Aid and Employ of certain monopoli|zing Adver&s;aries of our's, took a Tour to the northerly Parts of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Grants, to &s;urvey, and make Locations on our Land. Such Locating we view as a manife&s;t Plan, and Intenti|on
<PB N="72" REF="013102_0071_0F8EBC274E8BFBD8">of invading our Property&mdash;the &s;ame as in|trenching round the City, portraits a Siege thereof.</P>
<P>OUR People having Notice of Mr. <HI>Kockburn</HI>'s Intru&s;ion on our Borders, rallied a &s;mall Party, and pur&s;ued, and overtook him and his Party, and in their Pur&s;uit, pa&s;&s;ed the Towns of <HI>Panton</HI> and <HI>New-Haven,</HI> near the Mouth of <HI>Otter Creek;</HI> di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Col. <HI>Reed</HI> of a Saw-Mill in &s;aid <HI>Panton,</HI> which by Force, and without Colour, or even Pretence of Recour&s;e to Law, he had taken from the original Owners and Builders, more than three Years before, and did at that &s;ame Time extend his Force, Terrors and Threats into the Town of <HI>New-Haven;</HI> who, by the vicious and haughty Aid of Mr. <HI>Benzell,</HI> the fam'd Engineer, with a Number of A&s;&s;i&s;tants, under their Command, &s;o terrified the Inhabitants (which were about twelve in Number) that they left their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and Farms to the Conquerers, and e&s;caped with the Skin of their Teeth, although they had expended large Sums of Money in cutting Roads to, and &s;ettling in that new Country, as well as fatigued and laboured hard in cultivating their Farms: Col. <HI>Reed</HI> at the &s;ame Time, and with the &s;ame Force, did take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one Hundred and Thirty Saw-Logs, and fourteen Thou&s;and Feet of Pine Boards, which Boards were made in the &s;ame Mill, &amp; all lying thereby, all which he converted to his own U&s;e. Not long after, the original Proprietors of the &s;aid Mill, did re-enter, and take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof, but was a &s;econd Time attacked by Col. <HI>Reed</HI>'s Stewart, with a Number of armed Men, under his

In&s;tructions, and by their &s;uperior Force and Threats, obliged to quit the Premi&s;es again&mdash;all which Tenements, &s;aid <HI>Reed</HI> occupied and enjoyed until di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, as your Excellency's Letter complains of.</P>
<P>BUT to return to <HI>Kockburn</HI> again. Cur Party having taken him as afore&s;aid, brought him to the Town of <HI>Ca&s;tleton,</HI> near <HI>South Bay,</HI> where being fir&s;t informed of your Excellency's Clemency as well as that of the honourable Council, in grant|ing the Prayer of our Petition; and in Conformity to the Articles of Settlement agreed on, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him on honourable Terms.</P>
<P>THIS is a &s;hort Narrative of Facts, for the Proof of which, &s;ufficient Affidavits can be educed,</P>
<P>WE are apprehen&s;ive your Excellency has been hitherto unacquainted with the&s;e Facts, and have therefore exhibited them in this Letter; although it appears &s;trange to us, according as your Ex|cellency's own Letter &s;tates the Matter, that we &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected or taxed with violation of pub|lic Faith, and that our di&s;ingenuous and di&s;ho|nourable Violation thereof, hath nullified and made void the late amicable Settlement; for at the &s;ame Time your Excellency charges us with breach of Faith, and Settlement, the very Preli|minaries of this Faith was not known on our Part, and con&s;equently could not have been complied with, the very Stipulation and Faith &s;poken of, did not then exi&s;t, for it mu&s;t be the Meeting of
<PB N="74" REF="013102_0073_0F8EBC296F6DA5B8">the Minds of the contracting Parties, which con&s;titutes &s;uch Faith and Agreement, and of Cour&s;e cannot be broken before its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Kockburn</HI>'s locating our Lands in the mean Time the Preliminaries of Public Faith were form|ing, was at lea&s;t as much a Breach of that Faith, as what we are charged with. Nay, according to our Conception of the Matter, more &s;o; as he made the fir&s;t Movement towards the Inva&s;ion of our Property.</P>
<P>SOON after, our Me&s;&s;engers returned from New-York, and read the Minutes of Council, and your Excellency's Letter of Compliance there|with, to a large Auditory convened at Benning|ton for that purpo&s;e, compo&s;ed of the Inhabitants of that Place, the adjacent Country, and &s;undry re&s;pectable Gentlemen from the neighbouring Pro|vinces; your Excellency's gracious, wi&s;e, and benevolent Propo&s;als for &s;ettling Unity and Con|cord, in our Part of the Province, were by tho&s;e pre&s;ent, unanimou&s;ly applauded, and conceded to; and all po&s;&s;ible public Te&s;timonies of Honour and Re&s;pect, paid to your Excellency and Council, by &s;undry Di&s;charges of Cannon and &s;mall Arms; your Excellency's Health, long Life, and Pro&s;|perity, as well as that of the honourable Council's, was the Toa&s;t; your Name commanded Reve|rence and E&s;teem, and your Excellency's Per&s;on in particular, became precious in our Eyes.</P>
<P>AND, we do humbly a&s;&s;ure your Excellency we have no Di&s;po&s;ition of Alienation of Affec|tions,
<PB N="75" REF="013102_0074_0F8EBC2A2ADCE680">towards you, or knowingly break any Ar|ticle of Publick Faith.</P>
<P>THERE are two Propo&s;itions, which are the Ob|jects of our Attention.</P>
<P>"FIRSTLY; The Protection and maintaining our Property.</P>
<P>AND, SECONDLY; to u&s;e the greate&s;t Care and Prudence, not to break the Articles of Publick Faith, or in&s;ult Governmental Authority.</P>
<P>THESE two Propo&s;itions, we mean &s;trictly and religiou&s;ly to adhere to. And for the more ex|plicit Knowledge of the Preliminaries and Condi|tions of Publick Faith and Tru&s;t, we would in|form your Excellency and Council, that our Ac|ceptation of tho&s;e Conditions on the Part of <HI>New-York,</HI> is, that they make no further &s;ettlements or Locations on our Lands, granted under the Great Seal of the Province of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> until his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure be obtained, as to the validity of the Grants; although this was not &s;o fully expre&s;&s;ed, yet we &s;uppo&s;e it was implied in the Ab&s;tract of the Minutes of Council; if it was not, we pray, your Excellency and Council would undeceive us in that Particular, for if we are deceived in this, then, on this Hypothe&s;is, your Excellency and Council's lenient and friend|ly Di&s;po&s;ition towards Us, will not for the fu|ture, (by us) be viewed as &s;uch; for &s;uch Locations and Settlements on our Lands, would be incom|patible with Friend&s;hip, and a manife&s;t Infringe|ment
<PB N="76" REF="013102_0075_0F8EBC2B04EE0238">on our Property, which has all along been the Bone of Contention.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t part of your Excellency's Letter to Us, contains a Requirement of our immediate A&s;|&s;i&s;tance in repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Col. <HI>Reed</HI>'s Tenants of &s;aid Tenements. As to this Particular, had your Ex|cellency have known by what Means Col. <HI>Reed</HI> obtained Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them Lands and Tene|ments, undoubtedly your Excellency would not have required our A&s;&s;i&s;tance in repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing him; or have viewed with Concern, our di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing him, as a daring In&s;ult to Government: For the Ca&s;e right|ly under&s;tood, it appears, that his Conduct was a daring In&s;ult to Government, and continued Vi|olation for more than three Years, of the Laws, Re&s;trictions, Regulations, and OEconomy, both of God, and Man; a notorious Breach of the Tenth Command of the Decalogue, which &s;ays, <HI>"Thou &s;halt not covet, &amp;c."</HI> He coveting, did take the Saw-Mill-Logs, Boards, and al&s;o, the Lands, Labours, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, Farms, Tene|ments, &amp;c. &amp;c. from the rightful Owners, Pro|prietors, and fir&s;t Occupants thereof, without a proce&s;s at Law, as afore&s;aid, to their Exclu&s;ion from the Premi&s;es more than three Years, all which Time He has been enriching Him&s;elf, by the improvement of their E&s;tates; and, &s;hould we repo&s;&s;e&s;s him of the Premi&s;es again, We &s;hould become Co-Partners with Him, in his Wicked|ne&s;s. Such an Act we could not reconcile to our own Con&s;ciences; it being a parently immoral, and mo&s;t flagrantly Cruel and Unju&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="013102_0076_0F8EBC2BB5154F48">
WHEN your Excellency and Council views the&s;e Facts, and Arguments, we humbly conceive we &s;hall not be required to repo&s;&s;e&s;s Colonel Reed of the Premi&s;es: Nor do we expect your Excellen|cy and Council will adjudge us to be Violators of the late Articles of Public Faith: All which with due Submi&s;&s;ion, we refer to your Excellency and Council.</P>
<P>AND, we do now, with due Reverence, a&s;k the Favour of a few Lines, which may certify to us, the Determination of Government, relative to the Particulars litigated in this Paper, and remain your ever faithful and mo&s;t obedient humble Ser|vants.</P>

<HEAD>ARGUMENTS, Demon&s;trating that the Property of the Di&s;trict of LAND afore&s;aid, was conveyed from the CROWN, to the NEW-HAMPSHIRE GRANTEES, by Virtue of their re&s;pective CHARTERS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<P>AS the Claimants under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> rely on their Charters from that Govern|ment as the predicate and ground of their Title to the Property of the Land in Conte&s;t; &s;o, on the other Hand, the Claimants under <HI>New-York,</HI> pre|dicate and ground their Title to the &s;ame Land on the Validity of their Patents from <HI>New-York:</HI> This brings the Point in I&s;&s;ue between the re&s;pec|tive Claimants to this &s;ingle Que&s;tion, namely, <HI>Which of the &s;aid Governments conveyed the Fee of the Land in Conte&s;t?</HI> For it is &s;elf-evident both could not. And upon exploring the Controver&s;y, and animadverting on the Merits of the different Claims, be it which it will that may be allowed to &s;tand the Te&s;t, and adjudged Valid, it will of Nece&s;&s;ity invalidate the other. In the Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this Sub|ject, and &s;earching into the Merit of the re&s;pective Claims, it is nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;pect into the Validity of the Grant from King CHARLES to the Duke of York, from which Foundation only, the Govern|ment
<PB N="80" REF="013102_0078_0F8EBC2FA48FF088">of <HI>New-York</HI> deduce their Right of patent|ing the Lands in conte&s;t; yet the Matter of Fact is, that neither the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> as &s;uch, or any Individual therein, has ever had any Conveyance of any Land from the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> nor doth any Landlord or Per&s;on whatever, in the Government hold the Fee or Property of their Land, by Virtue of any Conveyance from the Duke of <HI>York;</HI> but they hold the Fee of their Lands on a very different Footing, viz. by Conveyance from the Crown; yet, if it be conceded to, that King CHARLES gave to his Brother James Duke of York, the Fee of the Lands We&s;t of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, to the Head of <HI>Delaware Bay;</HI> and allowing the Fee to be &s;till ve&s;ted in him, his Heirs or A&s;|&s;igns, upon this Hypothe&s;is no Per&s;on in the Pro|vince of <HI>New-York</HI> hath the Fee or Property of the Land they po&s;&s;e&s;s, the Fee remaining the Property of the Duke of York, his Heirs or A&s;&s;igns. And further, upon the &s;ame Principle, tho&s;e identical Pa|tents under the Seal of <HI>New-York,</HI> which were laid on the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Grants, are in their own Nature, e|qually null and void, with all other Conveyances of Land in the &s;aid Province which have been given by the Crown, the Fee thereof being ve&s;ted in the Duke of York, &amp;c. So that the Grantees under <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> are both, upon this Stat|ing of the Ca&s;e, equally de&s;titute of the Fee of the Land conte&s;ted for: But, upon this Stating, the Grantees under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> have the Argu|ment of Settlement, and Ocoupation, and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on, on their Side; which is abundantly &s;ufficient to give the Priority, and Preference of Title to them, &s;o that neither the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> or
<PB N="81" REF="013102_0079_0F8EBC30A4686B58">their Patentees, gain any Thing by building their Title on the &s;aid Grant to the Duke of York&mdash;for if there be any Thing in it, it defeats their own Title as well as that of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> proving too much for their Purpo&s;e, or nothing at all: But, if the Lands contained in the Duke of York's Grant re|verted back to the Crown, then the Duke of York's Patent became extinct, null, and ab&s;olutely void, and is as though it never had been; whether the &s;aid Rever&s;ion happened in Con&s;equence of the &s;aid Duke's abdicating the Throne&mdash;turning Papi&s;t, or by any formal Surrendery, or by any Means what|ever, provided the Fee became reve&s;ted in the Crown, then the &s;aid Charter became extinct, as afore&s;aid: &s;o that whether the Fee of the Land in Di&s;pute &s;till remains in the &s;aid Duke of York, his Heirs or A&s;&s;igns, or reverted, or was &s;urrendered to the Crown, none of all this will in the lea&s;t ju&s;tify the Government of New-York or its Paten|tees, in founding their Preten&s;ions of Title to the Lands afore&s;aid, by Virtue of the afore&s;aid Grant from King Charles to the Duke of York. For, take the Argument one Way, and it overturns both the Title of <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> al&s;o, leaving the latter in Occupation and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the di&s;puted Premi&s;es, and that only, being intirely de&s;titute of the Fee; and the <HI>New-York</HI> Claimants de&s;titute of the lea&s;t Colour of Title what&s;oever. But, take the Argument the other Way, viz. Pro|vided the Fee of the Lands afore&s;aid reverted and been reve&s;ted in the Crown, then the &s;aid Lands at the Time of fir&s;t granting were crown Lands the &s;ame as though the Duke of <HI>York</HI> had never exi&s;ted: But the Truth of the matter undoubtedly
<PB N="82" REF="013102_0080_0F8EBC310D688690">is this, the under Proprietors all except William Penn, who had the &s;everal Countries parcelled out to them by the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> which was contain|ed in his Grant; &s;urrendered their Charters to the Crown, whereby <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> be|came royal Governments: This then being the State of the Ca&s;e, the Lands in Di&s;pute became Crown Lands, and the Governor of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> as well as <HI>New-York</HI> Crown Officers, or King's Agents, and it is of no Con&s;equence to the King which of his Governors, grants his Land, if &s;o be they be granted to, and &s;ettled by loyal and indu&s;|trious Subjects, thereby adding to the Revenue of the Crown and enlarging and &s;trengthening the Kingdom: This being pre&s;uppo&s;ed, and admit for &s;uppo&s;ition only, that the Governor <HI>New-Hamp|&s;hire</HI> exceeded his proper Limits in crown Lands, mu&s;t the Grantees who have &s;ettled tho&s;e Lands, paid one of the crown Officers for granting the &s;ame, and expended their ALL, in &s;ettling and cul|tivating his Maje&s;ty's Wilderne&s;s Land, and who are truly loyal Subjects, be turn'd off the &s;aid Land by Thou&s;ands, and reduced to &s;tarving Poverty, together with their numerous Families, becau&s;e one of the crown Officers either ignorantly or de&s;ignedly impo&s;ed upon the People by grant|ing Crown Lands over his Bounds? This would be extreme wrong, the more &s;o as it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that the Subjects are capable Judges of the Juri&s;diction of Governments and con&s;equently there &s;hould be the greate&s;t care taken to guard the Subject from injury in all Ca&s;es of this Na|ture, the Truth of which will more fully appear by the following Con&s;iderations, viz. That not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="83" REF="013102_0081_0F8EBC31B34E1820">the &s;uppo&s;ed Error in granting the &s;aid Lands, yet the great End of the Crown in granting of it is compleatly an&s;wered, and pro|vided the Subjects i. e. the Settlers are quieted in the Fee and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;aid Lands, they will not be injured, &s;o that upon this Hypothe&s;is, neither King nor Subject would &s;u&s;tain Damage: Indeed no Per&s;on in the Realm could have ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Complaint. True, the re&s;pective Gover|nors of <HI>New-York</HI> may in&s;inuate, that upon this &s;tate of the Ca&s;e, the Governor of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> has cheated them out of their Fees for granting the &s;aid Land&mdash;though it is evident, if Crown Officers are faithful to the King and Subjects, they could take no more Money for granting Crown Lands, than a rea&s;onable Compen&s;ation for their Trouble, and the other Governor's being &s;uppo&s;ed to grant the Lands, &s;aves the &s;aid Governor of <HI>New-York</HI> the trouble; &s;o that the Argument is brought to this &s;ingle Point only at la&s;t, that upon Suppo&s;ition the Governor of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> exceeded his proper Limits in granting tho&s;e Lands, yet neither King nor Subjects are injured, (provided the Claimants un|der <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> hold the Fee of the &s;aid Land as above) except the Governors of New-York, and if they be &s;uppo&s;ed to be hone&s;t Men, the Trouble of granting the Land would be equal to their Fees had they granted it; &s;o that they have not been injured a Whit more in this Ca&s;e, than they may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have injured the Subjects by taking exorbitant Fees for granting the &s;ame Lands; which to them is no Injury at all, but a providential Check to the Excerci&s;e of their Avarice. So that the re&s;pective Governors of <HI>New-York,</HI> in an equitable Sen&s;e, are no Loo&s;ers in
<PB N="84" REF="013102_0082_0F8EBAC9ABEE4AC8">this Affair; or at mo&s;t the Privileges would be &s;o very incon&s;iderable as to make it meer trifling to mention it, e&s;pecially when &s;et in Competition with the &s;hocking and univer&s;al De&s;truction that would over&s;pread a large Country of his Maje&s;ty's good Subjects, provided they be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Lands afore&s;aid.

<P>IT is not conceeded to on the Part of the Claimants under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> that the Governor did in Fact exceed his proper Limits in granting tho&s;e Lands, the contrary will abundatly appear from the following Con&s;iderations, viz. Before and at the Time the &s;aid Governor of <HI>New-Hamp|&s;hire</HI> granted tho&s;e Lands they were reputed to be within his Juri&s;diction, this was the Opinion of both Learned and Unlearned, the Wi&s;e as well as Simple, thus it was univer&s;ally planed in all an|cient and modern Maps down to the Year 1764, when, by royal Determination, the Juri&s;diction of <HI>New-York,</HI> was extended over this di&s;puted Di&s;trict of Land: But the general Opinion before this royal Adjudication was that the Province of <HI>New-York</HI> extended its Juri&s;diction but Twenty Miles to the Ea&s;tward from <HI>Hud&s;on's</HI> River, &s;o general was this Opinion that the be&s;t Maps of the two re&s;pective Provinces, and the Hi&s;tory of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> adopted it as &s;ettled; it is of very great weight in the Que&s;tion to &s;hew how unive&s;al this Maxim was, and that the unprejudiced and accurate Geographer Mr. <HI>Mitchel,</HI> in his Map compo&s;ed &s;o
<PB N="85" REF="013102_0083_0F8EBC3369E6E9D8">late as the Year 1755, which with great Propriety and Certainty a&s;certains the &s;ame Limits, this Map has the more Authority as it was according to the Certificate of Mr. Pownal, Secretary to the Board of Trade, and was undertaken with the Approbation and at the Reque&s;t of the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for Trade and Plantation, and is chiefly compo&s;ed from Draughts, Charts, and actual Serveys of dif|ferent Parts of His Maje&s;ty's Colonies and Plan|tations in America, great Part of which have been &s;ince taken by their Lord&s;hips Orders and tran&s;|mitted to the Office of the Governors of &s;aid Colo|nies: This Twenty Mile Line was &s;o far from being deemed unfavourable to <HI>New-York,</HI> that we find the Commi&s;&s;ioners from that Province &s;o late as the Year 1767, made an Offer to tho&s;e of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay to let a Line at Twenty Miles di&s;tance Ea&s;t of <HI>Hud&s;on's</HI> River be the Divi&s;ion between their re&s;pective Provinces, which the latter Commi&s;&s;ioners would not then agree to it, being Thought by them too much in Favour of <HI>New-York,</HI> &s;o little it &s;eems did <HI>New-York</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion|ers conceive their Claim as far as <HI>Connecticut</HI> River could be &s;upported.</P>
<P>THOUGH it is true in the Year 1771 the Pro|vince of <HI>New-York</HI> by a publick Act of their Gene|ral A&s;&s;embly, did annex all that Part of the Pro|vince of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, to the We&s;tward from <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, to their County of <HI>Albany;</HI> and it is likewi&s;e true that in the Year 1773 the Governor's of the re&s;pective Provinces met at <HI>Hart&s;ord</HI> in <HI>Connecticut</HI> and came to a mutual A|greement to &s;ettle that Line at Twenty Miles di&s;|tance
<PB N="86" REF="013102_0084_0F8EBC378A0EA178">Ea&s;tward from <HI>Hud&s;on's</HI> River, which was the Hypothe&s;is of that Settlement, which hath &s;ince been ratified by His Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>THE Report of the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for Plantation Affairs in 1753, States the following Facts, from which is nece&s;&s;arily inferred that <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> extended its Juri&s;diction to the We&s;tward of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River.&mdash;"There are, &s;ays their Lord|&s;hips, about 60,000 Acres of Land &s;ituate on the We&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, which was purcha&s;ed by private Per&s;ons from <HI>Connecticut,</HI> to whom the Land had been laid out, by the Government of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI> as an equivalent for two or three Town&s;hips which the Latter purcha&s;ed from the Former, this Tract of Land by the determina|tion of the Boundary Line between the Provinces of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> and the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI> in 1739 is become a Part of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire."</HI>&mdash;Thus we have their Lord&s;hips Sentiments that the Juri&s;diction of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> extended over Part of the very Lands in Conte&s;t, We&s;tward of <HI>Connec|ticut</HI> River, as long ago as the Year 1739, at which Time <HI>New-York</HI> never dreamed of extending their Claim to <HI>Connecticut</HI> River.&mdash;There is another glaring and indi&s;putable evidence of the former We&s;tern extent of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> viz. Relative to Fort Dummer which was Built by the Bay Pro|vince in 1724, and garri&s;oned at their Expence a great Number of Years; but upon its being ex|cluded from their Juri&s;diction by the Settlement of the juri&s;dictional Line, between them and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> in 1739, the <HI>Bay</HI> Province repre|&s;ented to the Government at Home, that the &s;aid
<PB N="87" REF="013102_0085_0F8EBC3863469BF0">Di&s;trict of Land and Fort <HI>Dummer,</HI> having been determined to be the Property of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> they were no longer obliged to Garri&s;on and main|tain it, and praying, That as it was nece&s;&s;ary to the Defence of the Country, that <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> might be directed to &s;upport it. In Con&s;equence of which, an Order pa&s;&s;ed the King and Council in 1744, that the Governor and Commander in Chief of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> &s;hould forthwith move the A&s;|&s;embly, in His Maje&s;ty's Name, to make a proper Provi&s;ion for that Service; and at the &s;ame Time informing them that in Ca&s;e they refu&s;ed to com|ply with &s;o rea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary a Propo&s;al, his Maje&s;ty would find him&s;elf under a Nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;toring that Fort, with a proper Di&s;trict of Land contiguous thereto, to the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;ett's-Bay,</HI> who cannot with Ju&s;tice be required to maintain a Fort no longer within their Bounda|ry. In con&s;equence of this, <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> did maintain this Fort, and paid a Demand of Arrears for its Maintainance, to the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay.</HI> In the mean Time <HI>New-York</HI> was never a Compe|titor for the Burthen, willing as &s;he is to enjoy the Advantage of granting and engro&s;&s;ing the &s;aid Lands.</P>
<P>THIS being the Ca&s;e, the Government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> by the Royal Decree, was obliged to main|tain Fort <HI>Dummer,</HI> and it being on the We&s;t Side of <HI>Connecticnt</HI> River, and on this very identical Di&s;|trict of Land now in Di&s;pute, can that Government be ju&s;tly charged with granting Lands in the Pro|vince of <HI>New-York,</HI> when but a little before his Maje&s;ty in Council had adjudged the &s;ame Lands to
<PB N="88" REF="013102_0086_0F8EBAC9689A12D0">be in the &s;aid Government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> and ordered them to defend it, as by maintaining Fort Dummer, &amp;c. Surely at that Time <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> did extend its Juri&s;diction We&s;tward of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River; otherwi&s;e the King had ordered the Govern|ment of New-York to have maintained Fort Dummer. Nothing can be more flagrantly evident, than, that the Government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> had a Right to Grant Crown Lands where the Crown compell|ed them to Defend. From Hence it appears, that the Government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> had a legal Right to grant the Lands now in Di&s;pute, and that, that Government and his Maje&s;ty's good Subjects, the Grantees of, and Settlers on the &s;aid Lands, acted upon hone&s;t and honourable Principles, in granting purcha&s;ing, and &s;ettling the &s;ame, and on the o|ther Hand, it appears, that the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> in re-granting the &s;ame Land, acted quite the rever&s;e; and the more unpardonably &s;o, as they granted great Part of it, in open Defiance to His Maje&s;ty's Authority manife&s;ted unto them by his expre&s;s Prohibition, dated the 24th Day of July 1767.</P>
<P>FROM what has been already elucidated it ap|pears, that the Line of Juri&s;diction between the re&s;pective Provinces was not exactly a&s;certained till the 20th of July 1764; but neverthele&s;s that the Admini&s;tration of Great-Britain had adjudged in 1739 and confirmed in 1755, that the Govern|ment of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> extended We&s;tward of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, and that this was the general Sen&s;e of the Nation (till a&s;certained as afore&s;aid) is real Matter of Fact.&mdash;True no Determination of
<PB N="89" REF="013102_0087_0F8EBC38780362D0">His Maje&s;ty or Reports of the Lords of Trade had before particularized how far the Government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> &s;hould extend We&s;t of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River: but &s;uch Determinations of their's mightily &s;trengthened the common Opinion, nay, fully con|firmed it, that that Government extended We&s;t|ward to a twenty Miles Di&s;tance, Ea&s;t from <HI>Hud|&s;on</HI>'s River; inter&s;ecting a parrallel Line with the Colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;ett's Bay,</HI> between them and &s;aid Province of <HI>New-York.</HI> This was the Opinion both of King and Subjects at the Time the Government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> granted tho&s;e Lands; and Americans could not conceive of any intermediate Boundary in one Place more than another, between <HI>Connecticut</HI> River and the twenty-mile Limit afore&s;aid; nor had they any Apprehen&s;ion that the Government of <HI>New Hamp&s;hire</HI> would extend to the We&s;tward of that Limit. This parrallel Line took univer|&s;al and deep Impre&s;&s;ion on the Minds of Geo|graphers, and was the Under&s;tanding of the Briti&s;h Empire, and was thus portrayed in all former Maps.&mdash;The Certainty of this general Opinion may be further illu&s;trated from the Con&s;ideration that none of the Briti&s;h Subjects applied to the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> for Grants of tho&s;e Lands, till after the Alteration of Juri&s;diction in 1764, except it be, as is pretended by the <HI>New-York</HI> Scriblers, that their Government extended Patents from within the &s;aid twenty mile Line a|cro&s;s the &s;ame, and on &s;ome Part of the Premi&s;es in Di&s;pute, many Years before the Government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> granted tho&s;e Lands&mdash;which will
<PB N="90" REF="013102_0088_0F8EBC399740D1E0">be hereafter con&s;idered: But, would further add, it is Matter of Di&s;pute whether the Admini&s;trati|on at Home would recognize tho&s;e Patents grant|ed by the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> on the Pre|mi&s;es afore&s;aid; though antecedent to tho&s;e grant|ed by <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> ina&s;much as the Royal Ad|judication in 1764, could not antecedently impower the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> to grant them Lands, which by Royal Adjudication of the Line of Ju|ri&s;diction between <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay,</HI> fell within the Government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> in 1739, as afore&s;aid. However, for Argument only, we will &s;uppo&s;e the Governments of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> and <HI>New-York</HI> had each of them equal Authority to grant tho&s;e Lands&mdash;then on this Stating the Ca&s;e, prior granting would of Con&s;e|quence be Priority of Title. The fir&s;t Convey|ance, upon this Hypothe&s;is, being good and valid both in Law and Equity, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily defeat any &s;ub&s;equent Grant from the Crown or its Re|pre&s;entatives, being as authentic, to all Intents and Purpo&s;es, as any Conveyance of the Fee of Land from the Crown can po&s;&s;ibly be.&mdash;Thus it appears upon this mo&s;t favourable Conce&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e on the Part of <HI>New-York,</HI> that the Argument pre|ponderates in Favour of the Claimants under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> as their Grants are prior to tho&s;e of <HI>New-York,</HI> (except in the In&s;tances of the old Pa|tents, yet to be con&s;idered.)</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, it appears by the expre&s;s Words of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Grants, that the Grantees were not only intitled to the Fee of the Lands
<PB N="91" REF="013102_0089_0F8EBC39FB7B7290">therein di&s;cribed, but al&s;o to all the Enfranchi&s;e|ments, and each and every of the Privileges and Immunities that by Law his Maje&s;ty's Subjects in the Province of <HI>New Hamp&s;hire</HI> enjoy; &s;o that at the &s;ame Time that the Grantees were ve&s;ted with the Fee of the Land, they were enfranchi&s;ed with, and entitled to, all the Privileges and Immunities contained in their Charters; as the holding of Fairs, choo&s;ing Town Officers, and making and mending their own Roads, &amp;c. It is therefore humbly conceived, that provided it &s;hould be the future Plea&s;ure of his Maje&s;ty, to continue the &s;aid Lands in the Juri&s;diction of <HI>New-York,</HI> (which by the Settlers afore&s;aid is hoped will not be the Ca&s;e) that the Claimants and Settlers under the &s;aid Grants, will neverthele&s;s have his Maje&s;ty's gra|cious Approbation to enjoy without Let or Mole&s;|tation, the Privileges of Incorporation therein con|tained; the Grantees having ever con&s;idered tho&s;e Privileges as in&s;eperably connected with the Grant of the Fee-Simple.</P>

<P>FROM the Facts and Rea&s;ons that have been advanced in the foregoing Sections, it mani|fe&s;tly appears, that the Title of the Claimants un|der <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> to the Lands in Que&s;tion is indefea&s;ible; yet &s;till there are &s;undry Con&s;iderati|ons that may &s;erve more abundantly to confirm and e&s;tabli&s;h this Title beyond He&s;itation. As,</P>
<P>FIRSTLY, The far greate&s;t Part of the Extent
<PB N="92" REF="013102_0090_0F8EBC3ADB1DD178">of Juri&s;diction of the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> and great Part of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> depended entire|ly on his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure, being wholly in the Arbitration of the Crown, to be either curtailed or extended. The real Grant on which the original Circumference of the Government of <HI>New-Hamp|&s;hire</HI> was founded, extended but Sixty Miles from the Sea into the Country, to the We&s;tward, ter|minating about Twenty Miles Ea&s;t of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River. This Government was afterwards enlarged by his Maje&s;ty's Commi&s;&s;ion to <HI>Benning Wentworth,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Governor of that Province, directing it to extend to the We&s;tward until it &s;hould meet with his Maje&s;ty's other Governments. Which Clau&s;e of We&s;tern Extention, in the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ion, as well as the Royal Adjudication of the boundary Line between this Government and the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts-Bay</HI> in 1739, and Report of the Lords of Trade in 1755, and many Arguments mentioned in this and the foregoing Sections, all, on the Part of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> amount to &s;ufficient Evidence, that their Government extended &s;o far We&s;t as to inter&s;ect the parrallel Line of the Colony of <HI>Con|necticut</HI> and Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay,</HI> as argued above. And with re&s;pect to the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> it's original Northen Circumference terminated South of the City of Albany, and af|terwards, as Plantations were extended Northerly, either on Patents procured immediately from the Crown, or Government, or meer Settlements on Extra-provincial Lands, Commi&s;&s;ions from the King, to the re&s;pective Governors were enlarged, as in the Example following, viz. A. M. <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR>
<PB N="93" REF="013102_0091_0F8EBC3B75DCE508">Captain General, Governor and Commander in Chief in and over the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> (then follows the Enlargement,) and the Territories de|pending thereon in America.&mdash;The&s;e Territories are that Exten&s;ion of Juri&s;diction beyond their fir&s;t circum&s;cribed Limits, terminating South of <HI>Alba|ny,</HI> called the Province. This territorial Exten|&s;ion of Juri&s;diction is altogether in the Arbitration of the Crown to curtail or extend as before repre|&s;ented. This being the Ca&s;e, the re&s;pective Go|vernors can no other Way be Judges of the Extent of their Juri&s;diction, but by Directions given them in their Commi&s;&s;ions, together with his Maje&s;ty's expre&s;s Proclamations, and public Determinations relative thereto, as in the In&s;tance of the Royal Adjudication in 1764; a Publication of which, by his Maje&s;ty's Order, gave his Subjects to under|&s;tand, that it was his Plea&s;ure that the Territorial Juri&s;diction of <HI>New-York,</HI> &s;hould extend to the We&s;t Banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, which includes the di&s;puted Premi&s;es within that Government; before this it was impo&s;&s;ible for the Subjects to know it; if they could have under&s;tood it without his Maje&s;ty's Proclamation certifying the &s;ame, &s;uch Proclamation would have been needle&s;s and impertinent. The Truth of the Matter is, his Maje&s;ty in 1739, determined <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Go|vernment &s;hould cover the pre&s;ent di&s;puted Pre|mi&s;es; he altered his Determination in 1764, where|by <HI>New-York</HI> extended it's Territories over the &s;ame Land. And the King has an undoubted Right to alter and regulate the Juri&s;diction of Royal Governments as may &s;eem to Him mete;
<PB N="94" REF="013102_0092_0F8EBC3CAA2C2480">and for the <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> to pretend to amu&s;e Peo|ple of common Sen&s;e, pretending that it is the an|cient and indi&s;putable Right of the Colony of <HI>New-York</HI> to extend to the We&s;t Banks of <HI>Con|necticut</HI> River, as it's ea&s;tern Boundary, is the very Height of Folly: It was in the Nature of Things ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf &s;hould have known that to have been the Ca&s;e the Mo|ment before he determined it, and equally incon|&s;i&s;tent that the Subjects &s;hould know it before his Maje&s;ty proclaimed it.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, it appears by the Repre&s;entati|on which was laid before his Maje&s;ty by Lieute|nant Governor <HI>Colden,</HI> as an Inducement to prefix the We&s;t Banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, the ea&s;tern Boundary of the Province of <HI>New-York</HI>&mdash;That they were Arguments of Conveniency, holding up to View that it would be greatly to the Advantage of the Inhabitants on the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Grants, to be under the Juri&s;diction of <HI>New-York;</HI> which Arguments are incompatible with the Idea of an|tecedent Right of Juri&s;diction. Likewi&s;e, from hence we may &s;ee the Incon&s;i&s;tency of that Go|vernment or it's Patentees, in founding their Right in Fee to All or any Part of the Lands in Conte&s;t, by Virtue of the &s;aid Royal Adjudication of the Boundary Line on the We&s;t Banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River; ina&s;much as it cannot operate to their Ad|vantage antecedent to the Date of that Adjudica|tion, and afterward cannot be con&s;idered any Thing more than a mere Line of Juri&s;diction between the re&s;pective Governments.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="013102_0093_0F8EBC3D28A5EA10">
IT &s;hould be furthermore con&s;idered, that nei|ther Governments were ve&s;ted with the Fee of tho&s;e Lands; their Ca&s;e in this Re&s;pect, is quite the Rever&s;e to that of Proprietary Governments, who have a Right to appropriate the Soil. In Royal Governments, it is true, the Governors have a delegated Authority from his Maje&s;ty to grant Crown Lands; and in &s;uch Governments it is a Prerogative of the Crown to alter the Limits of Juri&s;diction; His Maje&s;ty hath a Right to re-an|nex the di&s;puted Premi&s;es to his Province of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> (in which it formerly was, and on the Faith of which the Claimants under that Govern|ment purcha&s;ed and &s;ettled the &s;ame Lands) or in|corporate it into a new Government, or continue it under the pre&s;ent Juri&s;diction, as his Royal Wi&s;|dom may di&s;cern to be be&s;t for the governed: But, upon &s;uch Alterations of Juri&s;diction, private Property is never changed or &s;ubverted. For, if the Property of the Subject be in the Arbitration of the Crown, and liable to the &s;ame Vici&s;&s;itudes and Changes with Juri&s;diction, this would de&s;troy the very Nature of Property, and would render a King ab&s;olute, and de&s;potic, which is perfectly in|con&s;i&s;tent with the Con&s;titution of the Kingdom.&mdash;Therefore, to convey or alienate Property, is the &s;acred Prerogative of the rightful OWNER.&mdash;Kings and Governors (in the Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>) cannot intermeddle therewith. There is indeed as much Difference between the Change of Juri&s;diction, and transfering of the Property of the Subject, as there is between Light and Darkne&s;s; although &s;ince the &s;aid Royal Adjudication in
<PB N="96" REF="013102_0094_0F8EBC3E028AB220">1764, the <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> have endeavoured to blend them together to an&s;wer &s;ini&s;ter and lucrative Pur|po&s;es.&mdash;They were &s;en&s;ible, undoubtedly, that &s;uch the afore&s;aid Arguments were conclu&s;ive a|gain&s;t their monopolizing the Fee-&s;imple of &s;aid Lands; and as it is very common for People, who are upon a De&s;ign of engro&s;&s;ing the Property of their Neighbour, to &s;et up &s;ome &s;pecious Pretence of Right to vindicate them&s;elves from the Impu|tation of Di&s;honor and Reproach; &s;o in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, the <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> endeavour to draw the Cur|tain of the Duke of York over their Knavery, and under the feigned Character of Heirs to that apo&s;|tate Duke, claim the Lands afore&s;aid, and fancy them&s;elves the Owners of Towns, (Fields) and Hou&s;es that they builded not.</P>

<P>ALTHOUGH the Arguments contained in the foregoing Sections are full and conclu&s;ive, rela|tive to the Nullity and Nothingne&s;s of the Duke of York's Grant, at lea&s;t, &s;uch Part thereof as con|cerns the pre&s;ent Di&s;pute; and that neither the Go|vernment of <HI>New-York</HI> or its Patentees gain any Manner of Title to the Land in Conte&s;t, by predi|cating it on the Validity of that Grant, yet the General A&s;&s;embly of the &s;aid Province in their State of the Rights, &amp;c. venture the Stre&s;s of their whole Cau&s;e thereon, and deduce all their Ar|guments of Title to tho&s;e di&s;puted Premi&s;es there|from: It is therefore partly out of Compliment to &s;o learned a Body of Doctors, as well as more fully to invalidate, and apparently demon&s;trate, to every capable Judge, the utter In&s;ufficiency and Defect of Title to tho&s;e Lands, by Convey|ance

<P>It appears from the Sequel of the Repre&s;enta|tions, Narratives and Arguments contained in the <HI>New-York</HI> Pamphlet, that the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> do not pretend to any Conveyance of the Fee of the Lands in Conte&s;t from the Duke of <HI>York.</HI> But their Grand Hypothe&s;is is, that the Juri&s;diction of their Government from the fir&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hment, was predicated on, and bound|ed by the de&s;criptive Limits of the &s;aid Grant; and con&s;equently, that the di&s;puted Premi&s;es was never in the Government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire;</HI> and, that that Government never was ve&s;ted with Authority to grant tho&s;e Lands, and al&s;o con&s;e|quently, that the Grants by them made, are in their own Nature void. This is the Sum of the
<PB N="101" REF="013102_0099_0F8EBB3B161CACD0"><HI>New-York</HI> Arguments relative to their Title to tho&s;e Lands. Here,</P>
<P>FIRST, it is nece&s;&s;ary the de&s;criptive Limits of the above rehear&s;ed Charter be brought under Con|&s;ideration; which includes the Countries of <HI>St. Croix,</HI> adjoining <HI>New Scotland, Pemaquid,</HI> the River <HI>Kenebeque,</HI> and the I&s;lands known by the Names of <HI>Martin's Vineyard, Nantucket,</HI> &amp;c. All the&s;e Coun|tries lying far Ea&s;t of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, and within the actual Juri&s;diction of the Provinces of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> &amp;c. and at pre|&s;ent, not contended for on the Part of <HI>New-York.</HI> Their General A&s;&s;embly, in the <Q>State of the Right.</Q> &amp;c. had done well to have informed the Publick; whether their "ancient and indi&s;put|able Right" of Juri&s;diction extended to every Part of the di&s;criptive Limits of the Grants afore&s;aid, and if not, to which Part it was circum&s;cribed; and when done, and by what Authority; whether their Governors Commi&s;&s;ions, at any Time, par|ticularized and determined to what Part of the Li|mits of the &s;aid Duke's Grant their Juri&s;diction &s;hould extend, more than another, or to the whole; or, whether any Royal Edict or Proclamation, had ever thus given them &s;uch predicated Limits of Ju|ri&s;diction: this is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for them to do, in Support of their Title to the Lands in Que&s;|tion. And furthermore, it is requi&s;ite for them to demon&s;trate that tho&s;e Lands were actually con|tained in &s;uch their former Limits of Juri&s;diction: but, if the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> from Royal Determination, cannot extend Juri&s;diction to any
<PB N="102" REF="013102_0100_0F8EBB3BC0EC2520">one Part of the de&s;criptive Limits of the Grant afore|&s;aid, more than to another; then, on this Hypothe&s;is, their Juri&s;diction includes the whole Limits con|tained in the Grant, or none at all; that it in|cludes the Whole, will not be pretended, and that any Part, as predicated on them Limits, cannot be made to appear: But on the contrary, it appears His Maje&s;ty and Council had no Reference to any Part of the Limits of this Grant, in determining the Boundaries of the Juri&s;diction of <HI>New-York</HI> in 1764, as may appear from the Royal Order it&s;elf, an Extract of which is as follows: <Q>His Maje&s;|ty with the Advice of his Privy Council, doth Order and Declare, That the We&s;t Banks of the River <HI>Connecticut,</HI> from where it enters the Pro|vince of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay,</HI> as far North, as the Forty-fifth Degree of Northern Latitude, to be the Boundary between the &s;aid two Provin|ces</Q>&mdash;that Parrallel of Latitude is al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed it's North Boundary, &amp;c. The Source of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River is &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;omething to the Northward of Latitude Forty-Five, and comes much from the North-Ea&s;t, a con&s;iderable Di&s;|tance after it pa&s;&s;es that Latitude; but it is notori|ous, that the Source of <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s River is far South of it; &s;o that by comparing the de&s;criptive Limits of the Duke of York's Grant, with tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ed in the Royal Order, they will be found to be ma|terially different. The Limit of that Part of the Duke's Grant, which re&s;pects the pre&s;ent Argu|ments, is in the Words following: <Q>Together al&s;o with the &s;aid River called <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s River, and all the Lands from the We&s;t Side of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River
<PB N="103" REF="013102_0101_0F8EBB3C8C808020">to the Ea&s;t Side of <HI>Delaware Bay;</HI></Q> which Limit in any po&s;&s;ible Con&s;truction of it, can include but Part of the di&s;puted Premi&s;es, (which &s;aid Premi&s;es extend and are bounded on the Forty-fifth Degree of North Latitude,) as will more fully appear in a further Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of that Line. But,</P>
<P>FIRST, it is manife&s;t that the King and Privy Council, in determining the Extent of the Juri&s;|diction of the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> did not proceed upon the Idea of that Government's having any antecedent Right of Juri&s;diction to tho&s;e Lands. Had that been the Ca&s;e, the Royal Order had been predicated on the Boun|dary Lines of the Duke's Grant afore&s;aid, and could not have comprehended any more Land than <Q>from the We&s;t Side of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River to the Ea&s;t Side of <HI>Delaware</HI> Bay;</Q> and the&s;e Bounds are &s;o loo&s;e, vague, and indeterminate, that it is altogether impo&s;&s;ible to found a Line of Juri&s;dic|tion thereon, as will more abundantly appear by the following Ob&s;ervations on the di&s;criptive Li|mits thereof, which may be &s;een at Large in the fore Part of this Section. Therefore, &s;uch Part only, as is nece&s;&s;ary for the Con&s;ideration of the indeterminate Bounds, before &s;poken of, is here quoted; which, after de&s;cribing the Situation of <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> and that it abuts upon the Main Land <Q>between the two Rivers there called or known by the &s;everal Names of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s River,</Q> begins the Di&s;cription under Con&s;ider|ation, <Q>together with the &s;aid River called <HI>Hud|&s;on</HI>'s River.</Q> Ob&s;erve, that as the De&s;cription
<PB N="104" REF="013102_0102_0F8EBB3D507C3AE8">of this River is not immediately connected with any foregoing or following Di&s;criptions in &s;aid Grant; nothing more can po&s;&s;ibly be included in it, but a Di&s;cription of the River only, exclu&s;ive of one Foot of Land on either Side. The &s;econd Di&s;cription <Q>and all the Land from the We&s;t Side of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River to the Ea&s;t Side of <HI>Delaware</HI> Bay.</Q> The be&s;t Mathematician on Earth can|not a&s;certain the&s;e Limits, except upon arbitrary Principles, as there can be no prefixed Place on <HI>Connecticut</HI> River where to erect the fir&s;t Bounds; and as to any particular Place on the <Q>Ea&s;t Side of <HI>Delaware</HI> Bay,</Q> where to erect a Second, is altogether undetermined in this Di&s;cription: But, ina&s;much as it includes all the Land from the We&s;t Side of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, &amp;c. there is a little better Foundation to e&s;tabli&s;h the fir&s;t Bounds than the Second. It &s;eems in order to include All as afore|&s;aid, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to extend either to the Head of the River, or to the mo&s;t Northerly Ex|tention of the whole Stream, to make the fir&s;t Bounds; and provided this imaginary Bounds &s;hould extend North of the Forty-fifth Degree of Northern Latitude, it would &s;o far exceed the Set|tlement of the Line in 1764. Be this as it will, the mo&s;t Northerly Part of the River, which would mo&s;t likely be the Head, would be the mo&s;t fa|vourable on the Part of New-York, for to e&s;tabli&s;h a fir&s;t Bounds, and from thence to extend a &s;trait Line to &s;ome Place on the Ea&s;t Side of <HI>Delaware</HI> Bay; this is &s;omething of a natural Con&s;truction, on the indeterminate de&s;criptive Limits afore&s;aid, without exploring <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, which in this
<PB N="105" REF="013102_0103_0F8EBB3E0B426688">Ca&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary. And, Fir&s;t, in tracing &s;aid River to its Source, it is found towards it's Extremity, to come much out of the North-Ea&s;t. This being the Ca&s;e, a &s;trait Line from it's Head to <HI>Delaware</HI> Bay, would cro&s;s &s;aid River and include a large Tract of Land on the Ea&s;t Side, and perhaps cro&s;s the River &s;undry Times; the Con&s;equences may be drawn thus, that where the Line may be &s;up|po&s;ed to cro&s;s the la&s;t Time, ought to be the fir&s;t real North Boundary, of the <Q>ancient and indi&s;|putable</Q> Limit of Juri&s;diction of <HI>New-York.</HI> For, if the Bounds at the Head of the River be|fore &s;poken of, be &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed, it would include con&s;iderable Land on the Ea&s;t Side of the River, within the old Boundary of New-York, which is contrary to any Idea to be gained from the di&s;crip|tive Limit afore&s;aid, viz. <Q>and all the Land from the We&s;t Side of Connecticut River, &amp;c.</Q> Still it may be queried whether there may not be another propo&s;ed fir&s;t Boundary better purporting with the Di&s;cription of <Q>And all the Land from the We&s;t Side of Connecticut River to the Ea&s;t Side of <HI>Delaware</HI> Bay,</Q> between the Head of the River, and the Place where the imaginary Line was &s;uppo&s;ed to pa&s;s? To this it may be an&s;wered, that a Place between the&s;e two, &s;o far up the River as in tracing a &s;trait Line from thence, to <HI>Delaware</HI> Bay, would not cro&s;s the River, may better agree with the above Di&s;cription: Still, from none of the&s;e imagined Lines, from the different imagined Bounds, or from any other projected, po&s;&s;ible, fir&s;t Bounds, can &s;uch a &s;trait Line be a&s;certained, till the Place for the South-We&s;tern Boundary on the
<PB N="106" REF="013102_0104_0F8EBB3EAF0D9010">"Ea&s;t Side of <HI>Delaware</HI> Bay" be e&s;tabli&s;hed? And the Vaguene&s;s of the di&s;criptive Limit is &s;o great, that it cannot be determined whether that Bounds &s;hall be at the Northern Extremity of the Ea&s;t Side of <HI>Delaware</HI> Bay, or at the Southern, where it communicates with the main Ocean, or at any other intermediate Place between the&s;e two: &s;o, that from the uncertainty of the &s;econd Bounds, it is impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;tabli&s;h the fir&s;t, &s;o as exactly to include "all the Land from the We&s;t Side of the &s;aid River to the Ea&s;t Side of &s;aid Bay," and no more. And,</P>
<P>THUS it is demon&s;trated from the Vaguene&s;s, Uncertainty and Ob&s;oletene&s;s of the di&s;criptive Li|mits of the Grant to the Duke of York, before quoted at large; that it is in the Nature of Things ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain it. From hence follows a Second nece&s;&s;ary inference, viz. That it is equally impo&s;&s;ible and contradictory, that governmental Juri&s;diction &s;hould be predicated thereon; for an ideal uncertain Juri&s;diction, in its own Nature incapable to be determined, is in reali|ty none at all. And from hence follows a Third Inference which determines the Sequel of the Argu|ment, on the Subject of Property, concerning the Lands in Que&s;tion, to be in Favour of the Claim|ants under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire:</HI> For, it is in the la&s;t Place, equally contradictory and impo&s;&s;ible, as in the Ca&s;e of the Ab&s;urdity of a&s;certaining the Limits of the pretended "ancient" Juri&s;diction of <HI>New-York,</HI> predicating it on vague and undeterminate Boundaries, that, that Government &s;hould predi|cate
<PB N="107" REF="013102_0105_0F8EBB406BDB66D8">their Right to the Fee of Lands, by them thus una&s;certainable; for as Uncertainty, and natural Impo&s;&s;ibility of a Juri&s;diction's being rendered determinate makes it in Reality to be none at all; &s;o the Idea of Property, predicated thereon is e|qually impertinent.&mdash;True it is, by the royal De|termination in 1764, the Ea&s;t Line of <HI>New-York</HI> extended to the We&s;t Banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River. Which may be Foundation for Conjecture, that, that Limit might have Reference to a Di&s;cription in the Duke's Grant afore&s;aid, "and all the Lands from the We&s;t Side of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River," &amp;c. Yet when the Repre&s;entation made by Lieut. Governor Colden, to his Maje&s;ty in Council, as mentioned in this Pamphlet, under the Head of the Narra|tive, &amp;c. comes to be con&s;idered it will reflect Light on this Point. The Arguments made U&s;e of in the &s;aid Repre&s;entation were tho&s;e of Conveniency and Advantage to the Settlers on tho&s;e Lands to be in the Government of New-York: And, that the We&s;t Banks of Connecticut River was a good and certain Boundary," &amp;c. The&s;e were un|doubtedly the preponderating Motives of deter|mining the We&s;t Banks of Connecticut River to be the Ea&s;t Boundary of New-York, and &s;uch Ar|guments are utterly incon&s;i&s;tant with the Notion of an "Ancient indi&s;putable Right" of Juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;till another Con&s;ideration which may be of Moment in the Ob&s;ervation of this, &s;o Trumpt-up, "ANCIENT RIGHT OF JURISDICTION" of the Province of New-York, to the Lands in Conte&s;t: If it be admitted a Line &s;hould be drawn from the mo&s;t northerly Part of Connecticut River
<PB N="108" REF="013102_0106_0F8EBB40EFF67140">to the mo&s;t northern Extremity of Delaware-Bay; &s;till, it is by no means probable &s;uch Line would include more than one half (if &s;o much) of the Lands in Di&s;pute &s;o far as may be judged from the Latitude and Longitude of the re&s;pective Objects: For con&s;idering the Cour&s;e of Connecticut River, which is nearly from North to South, except to|wards its Extremity; and the Sea coa&s;t, from the River's Mouth, together with Delaware Bay, forming al&s;o an indened Line, to the South of We&s;t; the Land included in the&s;e Limits, by a Line drawn from Connecticut River to Delaware Bay as afore&s;aid, would (excepting the &s;mall Pro|montory formed by the Mouth of the Bay and the Ocean) lye in the Figure of an obtu&s;e angled Triangle; and the Cour&s;e of the &s;aid Line from the River to the Bay, according to occular Survey, would be from the Northea&s;t a Southwe&s;terly Di|rection: Which very badly comports with the pre&s;ent North and We&s;terly Exerci&s;e of Juri&s;dicti|on of the Government of New-York, at Crown|point, Detroit, &amp;c.&mdash;It may here well be ob&s;erved, the Settlers under New-Hamp&s;hire &s;eem to be in a critical Situation; every arbitrary Mea&s;ure under the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration of the Government of New-York, is excerci&s;ed again&s;t them; and pro|vided they flee to the Ea&s;tward to procure Inherit|ances, there they are fore-clo&s;ed, the di&s;criptive Limits of the &s;aid ancient Juri&s;diction covers them (to wit) the Countries of St. Croix, Pemaquid, Kenebeque, Nantucket, Martin's Vineyard, &amp;c.&mdash;Yet there is another large unknown Country to the We&s;t and Northwe&s;t, which has been but part|ly
<PB N="109" REF="013102_0107_0F8EBB41C892D6E8">explored; and provided, the&s;e People, in&s;tead of fleeing to the Ea&s;tward, &s;hould turn their Cour&s;e, to tho&s;e Countries; there, it is indi&s;putable but that, New-York would encircle them with ano|ther odd Di&s;cription of Domain contained in their Governor's Commi&s;&s;ions, i. e. <Q>A. B. Captain General Governor and Commander in Chief in and over the Province of New-York,</Q> next fol|lows the Di&s;cription hinted <Q>and the Territories depending thereon, in America.</Q></P>
<P>FROM the foregoing Di&s;criptions of the Govern|ment of New-York, it appears they lay Claim to &s;o exten&s;ive a Domain three different Ways, or have three different Modes or Modifications in comprehending and engro&s;&s;ing their progre&s;&s;ive Limits. As,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;tly. THE Province of New-York, which falls &s;hort of, and terminates con&s;iderably South of the City of Albany.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. "THE Territories depending thereon in America." The&s;e Territories comprehending &s;uch Plantations, on extra-provincial Land, as are and have been carried on adjoining to the Province till its Territories, are at pre&s;ent extended to Detroit and the Neighbourhood thereof, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The Limits of the Duke of York's Grant, and ina&s;much as the Grantees and Settlers on the Lands in Di&s;pute, hold their Title under New-Hamp&s;hire, and that Government had for &s;everal Years exerci&s;ed their Juri&s;diction over tho&s;e Lands,
<PB N="110" REF="013102_0108_0F8EBB4275649058">even till 1764.&mdash;Therefore, in this Ca&s;e the Go|vernment of New-York could not extend their Territorial Sort of Juri&s;diction over the Premi&s;es; for &s;uch Sort of Juri&s;diction might be challenged on the Part of New-Hamp&s;hire (if it &s;hould be ad|mited at that Time, &s;aid Premi&s;es was extra-pro|vincial Lands) and that with far the mo&s;t Propriety. Ina&s;much as that Government had granted the Land and began Settlements thereon. Add to this the following Clau&s;e in Governor Wentworth's Commi&s;&s;ion, which they viewed to be of great Weight in this Ca&s;e, which, after di&s;cribing the former Limits of New-Hamp&s;hire, <Q>and from thence extending We&s;t till it meets with his Maje&s;ty's other Governments.</Q> Add to this al&s;o, the Rea&s;ons held forth in the Chain of Arguments, contained in the three fir&s;t Sections; all which were too potent for the New-York territorial Sort of Dominion to fru&s;trate. At that Juncture, Therefore, the Lawyers, Land-jobbers, Politicians, &amp;c. planed out the afore&s;aid third Modes of Ju|ri&s;diction predicating it on the di&s;criptive Limits of the Grant to the Duke of York. And on this new modled Plan breathed an air of <Q>ANCIENT AND INDISPUTABLE RIGHT of</Q> Juri&s;diction, and con|&s;equently to the Fee of the Lands in Conte&s;t.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Intimation that ever &s;aluted the Ears of the Publick, a&s;&s;erting it to be the ancient Right of the Colony of New-York, to extend to Con|necticut River as its ea&s;tern Boundary, was di&s;|coverd from a Proclamation, given under the Hand of William Tryon, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Governor of the
<PB N="111" REF="013102_0109_0F8EBB4693DC1370">Province of New-York, &amp;c. and dated the 11th Day of December, 1771. His Proclamation be|gins after the following Manner. <Q>Whereas it is the ancient and inconte&s;tible Right of this Co|lony to extend to Connecticut River, as its Ea&s;tern Boundary.</Q></P>
<P>THIS was drawing a po&s;itive Conclu&s;ion from fictitious, and till that Time, unheard of Premi&s;es: and rather influenced People, in the &s;everal Go|vernments, to purcha&s;e and &s;ettle under New-Hamp&s;hire, than di&s;wade them therefrom, for common Fame, and common Sen&s;e were a Barrier again&s;t the Belief of this New-York Doctrine, which from the Time of the royal Adjudication in 1764, was by the Proclamation afore&s;aid, anti|dated to "Ancient." That this Doctrine till then, was inconte&s;ted, is thought to be true; for it had but peept to public Con&s;ideration, and has ever &s;ince been conte&s;ted.</P>
<P>SHOULD this, their new Hypothe&s;is be admitted; yet, as hath been before ob&s;erved, the&s;e Limits could include but Part of &s;aid Lands, according to the be&s;t Judgment that can be formed without an actual, and accurate Survey of the di&s;criptive Li|mits of &s;aid Grant; which if the New-Yorkers can do and fairly Demon&s;trate, to any able Mathe|maticians, and competant and impartial Judges, that they have rightly a&s;certaned tho&s;e Limits, it is engaged on the Part of the Claimants under New-Hamp&s;hire that they &s;hall yield up, to the Land-jobbers of New-York, their Lands and Labours:
<PB N="112" REF="013102_0110_0F8EBB4799F5F730">an Object which undoubtedly would be grateful and plea&s;ing to them; and which they have many Years been in Pur&s;uit of, and have hitherto had the Mortification to be baffled. It is verily Incum|bant on the Government of New-York, in order to found Tittle to tho&s;e Land on this new Scheme,</P>
<P>FIRSTLY, to a&s;certain the Limits of their ima|ginary Bounds: This, the Claimants under New-Hamp&s;hire, will expect compleated, or hear no more of tho&s;e "ANCIENT AND INCONTESTIBLE" Boundaries of New-York.</P>

IT is to be further ob&s;erved, that however our Authors may Critici&s;e upon the gramatical or legal Con&s;truction of &s;elected Words or Phra&s;es; yet, a little Attention to the following real Facts, will clearly point out the Incon&s;i&s;tency of &s;uch Sophi&s;ms.</P>
<P>FIRSTLY, <HI>Connecticut</HI> Charter, granted by King CHARLES the Second, the 23d Day of April 1662, was bounded and extended in Length, by and with the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> fir&s;t Charter, granted by King CHARLES the Fir&s;t, the 4th Day of March 1629, which inconte&s;tibly extended agreeable with the afore&s;aid di&s;criptive Limits of the Deed of Sale from the Council of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> to Sir <HI>Henry Ro&s;well,</HI> Sir <HI>John Young,</HI> &amp;c. and extended through the Main Land in Longitude to the South Sea on the We&s;t Part.</P>

<P><PB N="117" REF="013102_0115_0F8EBB4AAC6B5A68">
IN the next Place 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider the Charter of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> which our Authors inform &s;hould not extend We&s;t of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, in the Words following: <Q>This being a Crown Grant on the Suit and Petition of the Grantees, is to be taken mo&s;t beneficially for the King. The di&s;criptive Words, and the Intention of the Grant, will in legal Con&s;truction be &s;atisfied by giving the Colony the &s;ame Length as the <HI>Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts Bay;</HI> and it is plain, both from the Re|cital and the &s;aving Clau&s;e in the <HI>Plymouth</HI> Pa|tent, on which the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett</HI>'s Title was found|ed, that the Latter cou'd not in any Sen&s;e, ex|tend to the We&s;tward of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River.</Q> As this their A&s;&s;ertion is founded on the Hypothe&s;is of <HI>Connecticut</HI> Charter's being predicated on that of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's,</HI> and therefore the Arguments before exhibited on that Head, are equally Con|clu&s;ive for the e&s;tabli&s;hing the We&s;tern Extent of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> nothing more is nece&s;&s;ary for that Pur|po&s;e, but a Recital of the di&s;criptive Words of their Charter, granted &s;ub&s;equent to their Purcha&s;e from the Council of <HI>Plymouth</HI> by King CHARLES the Second, the 23d Day of April, 1662, <Q>Bounded on the Ea&s;t by <HI>Narragan&s;et</HI> River, commonly called <HI>Narragan&s;et</HI> Bay, where the &s;aid River falleth into the Sea; and on the North by the Line of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Plantation; and on the South by the Sea, and in Longitude as the Line of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Colony, running from Ea&s;t to We&s;t: That is to &s;ay, from the &s;aid <HI>Narragan&s;et</HI> Bay on the Ea&s;t, to the South Sea on the We&s;t Part.</Q> Thus it appears not
<PB N="118" REF="013102_0116_0F8EBB4B6C3D3DB8">only by the Demon&s;trations afore&s;aid, but from the expre&s;s Words of the di&s;criptive Limits of the Charter it&s;elf, which cannot admit of a double Meaning, (curious as our Authors be in the Art of playing with Words, they have not attempted to obviate their literal Meaning,) that it is the un|que&s;tionable Right of the Colony of <HI>Connecticut</HI> to extend it's We&s;tern Boundary to the South Sea on the "We&s;t Part;" and in this that Colony agree, who are now challenging their Right in Fee to tho&s;e Limits, and actually making Plantation, as at <HI>Su&s;quebannah,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>BY this Time, undoubtedly Queries will ari&s;e in the Mind of the Reader, What will become of the Grant to the Duke of York, if the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;ett's and Connecticut Colonies extend "to the South Sea on the We&s;t Part?" The following In|telligence from our Authors will introduce an An&s;wer to this Query; who, after di&s;cribing &s;aid Grant further inform, in Page 3d of the State, &amp;c. That <Q>a Fleet and Land Forces were &s;ent to re|move the Dutch, and put the Duke in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</Q> Accordingly, on the 27th Day of Augu&s;t 1664, the Dutch Governor <HI>Stuyve&s;ant,</HI> &s;urrendered by Ca|pitulation, all the Countries the Dutch then po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, to King CHARLES the Second; when among other Terms it was &s;tipulated, <Q>that all the People &s;hall remain free Denizens, and &s;hall enjoy their Lands, Hou&s;es, and Goods, where<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">er they are within this Country, and di&s;po&s;e of them as they plea&s;e.</Q> Thus, by Conque&s;t, the King be|came reve&s;ted with his Right to the Lands conquer|ed:
<PB N="119" REF="013102_0117_0F8EBB4E28C44398">for, as the King had antecedently di&s;po&s;ed of all the E&s;tate the Crown was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in the&s;e Countries, to the Colonies of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay;</HI> therefore, his Right now could not extend any further than the actual Conque&s;t, which, in legal Con&s;truction, mu&s;t be &s;atisfied with, and can extend no further than the actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons de&s;cribed in the forementioned Capitulation. A further Information is in Page 4th, <Q>To re|move any Doubt of the Validity of the Dukes Title, either from the Want of Sei&s;in in the Crown when it originated, or on Account of the intermediate Conque&s;t by the Dutch, it was con|firmed to his Royal Highne&s;s by further Let|ters Patent, dated the 29th Day of June, 1674.</Q> That there was Want of Sei&s;in in the Crown at the Time of fir&s;t Granting, is inconte&s;tible; for, as above &s;aid, the King by antecedent Grants had di|ve&s;ted the Crown of it's Right, and by this Con|que&s;t became reve&s;ted: So that from this, Occa&s;ion will be taken to &s;ay, that in Fact the Province of <HI>New-York</HI> was originally &s;ounded on Conque&s;t, and the Limits of it, as before mentioned, circum&s;crib|ed by the Dutch Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions pointed out in the Terms of Capitulation. However <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="5 letters">ourable this Conclu&s;ion may be thought, on the Part of <HI>New-York,</HI> yet, as the Crown had prior to either of the Duke's Grants, di&s;po&s;ed of its Right to the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> and <HI>Connecticut</HI> Colonies&mdash;if it was not thus founded on Conque&s;t, it hath no Foundation at all; and it's having any Place for Exi&s;tence, is but an "Intru&s;ion on the Rights" of tho&s;e other Colonies. Furthermore, it is My&s;terious and Con|tradictory,
<PB N="120" REF="013102_0118_0F8EBB4FC98C6988">admitting that that Government was thus founded, to &s;uppo&s;e the Duke could be Lord Proprietor; ina&s;much as by the Conditions of Capitulation, the Fee then acquired to the Crown, pa&s;&s;ed to the Dutch Inhabitants, who then became Engli&s;h Subjects.</P>
<P>THE Reader is in the next Place invited to a more particular Con&s;ideration of the afore&s;aid di&s;|puted Premi&s;es, which are bounded South on the North Line of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay,</HI> and We&s;t by a Line about twenty Miles Ea&s;t of <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s River, extending North ten Degrees, Ea&s;t till it comes al|mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to <HI>Ticondaroga;</HI> thence We&s;t till it &s;trikes on <HI>Lake Champlain,</HI> thence on the Ea&s;t Banks of &s;aid Lake to the Forty fifth Degree of Northern Latitude, and on the North by the &s;aid Latitude, and Ea&s;t on the We&s;t Banks of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River. On this Tract of Country 'tis not pretended there ever was any ancient Dutch Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, nor any un|der Title from <HI>New-York,</HI> except on the We&s;t Part of the Town&s;hip of <HI>Pownal,</HI> &s;ituate at the South-We&s;t Corner of this Tract; and &s;ome Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the Town&s;hip of <HI>New-Haven,</HI> on <HI>Otter Creek,</HI> which Colonel <HI>Reed</HI> gained and maintained by Force, a|bout three Years, and which by Force he was o|bliged to &s;urrender to the fir&s;t Settlers, who were Claimants under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH this Tract of Land was contained in the original Grant to the Council of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> yet, as they never made any Conveyance of it, therefore it reverted to the Crown on the Surrender of that
<PB N="121" REF="013102_0119_0F8EBB50B84E69D8">Grant, the 7th Day of June, 1635. From which it may be objected, on the Part of <HI>New-York,</HI> that the above Conci&s;ene&s;s in the Circum&s;cription of the Boundaries of their Colony is too great; for, that the Grant to the Duke mu&s;t hold good where the Crown, at the Time of granting, was ve&s;ted with a Right to the Lands granted. In An&s;wer, it has been argued in the preceeding Section, that it is very uncertain whether the Limits of the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Grant included this Tract of Land, or if any, how great a Part; and that the Limits of &s;aid Grant cou'd not be a&s;certained&mdash;and that govern|mental Juri&s;diction, and Property cou'd not be predicated on &s;uch ob&s;olete and uncertain Bounds. It was al&s;o demon&s;trated in the fir&s;t Section, and will be further ob&s;erved in this, that the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Grant reverted to the Crown, and that the Landholders in the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> hold under the Crown&mdash;and that, if it did not revert to the Crown, the Fee is &s;till in the Duke, his Heirs or A&s;&s;igns, and no Landholders in the Government are ve&s;ted with the Fee of the Lands they po&s;|&s;e&s;s, &amp;c<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Argument and Couclu&s;ion is founded on the <HI>New-York</HI> Hypothe&s;is, exclu&s;ive of the herein mention'd Article in the Dutch Capitulation.</NOTE>. It would be too tedious as well as needle&s;s to recite the Arguments that have been offered in the three fir&s;t Sections, which is humbly conceived are abundantly &s;u&s;&s;icient to An&s;wer the afore&s;aid Objection, and fairly demon&s;trate Priority of Title to be in Favour of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire;</HI> to which the curteous Reader is referred for a Con|&s;ideration.</P>

<P>IT may be further offered in Objection, on the Part of <HI>New-York,</HI> That allowing the foregoing Ar|guments relative to the Territories, and that <HI>Ren|&s;elaerwyck</HI> was, before the AEra of the afore&s;aid De|termination, in Fact annex'd to the Government by the territorial Clau&s;e in the Governor's Com|mi&s;&s;ions; yet, neverthele&s;s the Duke's Grant mu&s;t be valid to the Northward of that Manor, to all the Lands it originally covered. This cannot o|perate in Favour of <HI>New-York,</HI> for, in Addition to what has been before argued to this Purpo&s;e, the Reader is de&s;ired to ob&s;erve, that King <HI>James.</HI> the Second, who was this &s;ame Duke of York, abdi|cated the Throne in 1688, and his E&s;tate reverted to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and this Grant became ve&s;ted in the Crown, the &s;ame as though the Duke or his Grant had never had an Exi&s;tance.&mdash;Nor have any of their Governor's Commi&s;&s;ions, from <HI>Henry Slaughter,</HI> the fir&s;t Governor appointed by King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> down to this pre|&s;ent AEra, ever been predicated on, or had the lea&s;t Reference to the Limits of that Grant.</P>

<P>THE Government of <HI>New-York</HI> make the great|e&s;t Outcry again&s;t her Si&s;ter Colonies, taxing them with Intru&s;ion, Violence and Encroachment; and, at the &s;ame Time, are flagrantly more guilty of

<P>OUR Authors, in Order to maintain their Claim to the Lands in Conte&s;t, and if po&s;&s;ible, to include it within One of the de&s;criptive Limits of the Grant to the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> tell us many &s;trange Things about the Colonies of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts:</HI> That <HI>Connecticut.</HI> "in legal Con&s;truction" &s;hould not have extended to the We&s;tward of <HI>Connecticut</HI> Ri|ver, and that their Settlements We&s;t of that River were an Intru&s;ion on the Right of the Colony of <HI>New-York;</HI> yet, neverthele&s;s for Peace &s;ake, and rather than conte&s;t with "a powerful Neighbour," they &s;ettled with that Colony at twenty Miles di&s;|tance from <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s River.</P>
<P>THEY further inform, that <Q>the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Claim &s;tands by no Means in &s;o re&s;pectable a Light as that of <HI>Connecticut,</HI></Q> and in legal Con|&s;truction, &s;hould extend <Q>no further We&s;tward than 'till it meets the Colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and not to <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, and much le&s;s to the We&s;tward of it.</Q> Our Authors being Men of great Learning and Sagacity; &s;oon extended their antient Right of Juri&s;diction over &s;uch Part of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Colony as lay to the We&s;tward from <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, and this their Scheme in &s;top|ping the We&s;tern Exten&s;ion of that Colony where it meets <HI>Connecticut,</HI> may be reckoned as one a|mong the greate&s;t of their political Atchievements. "And it is worthy a Remark," that had the <HI>Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Colony extended We&s;t to the South Sea,
<PB N="129" REF="013102_0127_0F8EBB5786B4DBA0">it could not have met <HI>Connecticut,</HI> but mu&s;t have extended parallel with it, in the &s;ame Direc|tion.</P>
<P>To give this plea&s;ing Scheme &s;ome Kind of Co|lour, they argue the Nullity of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> fir&s;t Charter, and introduce the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Grant as the olde&s;t Title, Page 5th, <Q>The <HI>Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Charter was vacated, and the Title of that Colony now &s;olely depends on their Char|ter of 1691.</Q></P>
<P>YET they allow, that that Colony obtained the Right of Soil from the Council of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and that the Charter of King <HI>Charles</HI> dated the 4th Day of March 1628-9, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the Charter &s;poken of as vacated, which was done as has been before largely treated of, in 1684.</NOTE> ve&s;ted them with Powers of Government, (it's needle&s;s to animad|vert on the&s;e &s;trange Accounts) however, after they have charmed their Imaginations with the fruitle&s;s Idea of extending their antient Right to all that Part of the Bay Province We&s;t of <HI>Connec|ticut</HI> River, they complain bitterly of the En|croachments of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> Page 8th. <Q>Un|der Circum&s;tances &s;o favourable to the Rights of this Colony, we have great Rea&s;on to com|plain of the unwarrantable Encroachments un|der the Authority of the Government of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> by which a valuable Tract extending from <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, within Twen|ty Miles of <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s River, has been wre&s;ted from us.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="013102_0128_0F8EBB5831F87330">
<Q>THEIR Conduct &s;eems the more inexcu&s;able, as they mu&s;t have known that &s;uch Encroach|ments were not only di&s;re&s;pectful to his Maje&s;|ty's Authority, and big with great Mi&s;chiefs and Di&s;orders, but were highly injurious to pri|vate Property, great Part of the&s;e Lands having antiently been granted to his Maje&s;ty's Subjects under the great Seal of this Colony.</Q></P>
<P>THEN they proceed to recite their old Grants, which they tell us <Q>cover the Country the whole Breadth of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett</HI>'s Claim:</Q> The Ma|nor of <HI>Ren&s;elaerwyck,</HI> granted in 1685, and extend|ing 24 Miles each Side, from <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s River; and <HI>We&s;tonhook,</HI> in 1705, which extends about 30 Miles from <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s River; and <HI>Hoo&s;ick,</HI> in 1685, which extends about 30 Miles from the River. It &s;eems to have been a political, and univer&s;al Principle with the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> to begin their Patents within the Twenty Mile Line, and extend them Ea&s;tward of it, that by this Means they might have Opportunity to encroach on, and jockey their neighbouring Colonies, more or le&s;s, out of their Lands, as &s;ub&s;equent Policy, Intrigue and Power, would render practicable.</P>
<P>THAT Government, thus extended their Patent into <HI>Connecticut,</HI> One in particular, into the Town|&s;hip of <HI>Sali&s;bury;</HI> and it has ever been their Prac|tice to wrangle till they find by Experience, that neither by Sophi&s;try, Law, or Ho&s;tility, they can maintain their exorbitant Claims, and then capitu|late on as good Terms as they can; and conclude
<PB N="131" REF="013102_0129_0F8EBB58EA985BA0">with branding their Competitors with Di&s;hone&s;ty, Encroachment and many hard Names, and don't &s;cruple to impeach their Governmental Authority, (as in the Ca&s;e ju&s;t recited of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay) with being Di&s;re&s;pectful to his Maje&s;ty's Authority, and guilty of great Mi&s;chiefs and Di&s;|orders; although the Authority of their own Go|vernment, by their unju&s;t, avaricious Encroach|ments on the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> even to <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, laid the Foundation of tho&s;e Di&s;orders, and they might have added Blood-&s;hed; yet their A&s;&s;embly have the Impudence to Palm it all upon the Au|thority of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</P>
<P>THE Claimants under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> are &s;o happy as to be almo&s;t exempted from any <HI>New-York</HI> Claims, by Patents from that Government prior to their's; the afore&s;aid <HI>Hoo&s;ick</HI> and <HI>Wallum&s;cock</HI> Patents being the only ones of this Nature, the former includes about one Qaurter of the Town|&s;hip of <HI>Pownal,</HI> on which Part were about four Settlers, when it was granted by <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire.</HI> This Town&s;hip is bounded Southerly by the North Line of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> and extends We&s;t as far as the <HI>Connecticut</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Colonies; the latter, i. e. <HI>Wallum&s;cock</HI> Patent, was granted un|der the common Seal of the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> the 15th Day of June, 1739. This Patent is &s;aid to interfere with the Town&s;hip of <HI>Bennington,</HI> and it is Matter of Di&s;pute, whether in it's fir&s;t Locati|on, it included more than about 30 or 40 Acres within that Town, tho' it &s;eems the Patent by it's di&s;criptive Limits, extends further into the Town,
<PB N="132" REF="013102_0130_0F8EBB5FB2FE88F0">and the Patentees produce a Map corre&s;ponding with tho&s;e Limits: However, an Indian, aged Fif|ty-Nine, who was Pilot to the Party that located this Grant, informs of a certain Monument they then erected, where they broke a Bottle, &amp;c. for their Ea&s;tern Bounds. "And it is worthy a Remark," that this Indian happens to be exactly of the &s;ame Age with <HI>Ebenezer Cole,</HI> one of our Author's prin|cipal Deponants. This Monument is well known by the <HI>Bennington</HI> People, and is on the We&s;tern Edge of the Town; and there has never been a Di&s;covery of any Lines of the Survey of that Lo|cation to the Ea&s;tward of this Monument. The many Circum&s;tances of this Nature, amount to al|mo&s;t a Certainty, that the Patentees never made any actual Location further interfering with <HI>Ben|nington,</HI> than as afore&s;aid; notwith&s;tanding, as they have planned their patent, it includes about one Eighth Part of the Town; which Lands are exceeding good in Nature, and are &s;ettled wholly under the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Title, by indu&s;trious Farmers, who form a Wilderne&s;s State, have culti|vated and brought the mo&s;t of it under good im|provements, with many valuable Hou&s;es, Barns and Orchards; &s;ome of them annually mowing at lea&s;t 80 Tons of Hay, and rai&s;e other Produce of the Country in Proportion. Not the lea&s;t Im|provements or Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were ever made in that Town, except by the&s;e Inhabitants; neither had they the lea&s;t Knowledge of a Pretence of any <HI>New-York</HI> Patents extending there till &s;everal Years af|ter they had &s;ettled the Land. As has been be|fore ob&s;erved, there was about four Settlers on that
<PB N="133" REF="013102_0131_0F8EBB6155CA1060">Part of <HI>Hoo&s;ick</HI> Patent, included in the Town&s;hip of <HI>Pownal,</HI> when it was granted; and if the Au|thor has a right Information, there has not been any more Settlements made under the <HI>New-York</HI> Title &s;ince, though there hath &s;undry Families &s;et|tled on the Premi&s;es, included as afore&s;aid, under the <HI>New-Ham&s;hire</HI> Title.</P>
<P>As the State and Circum&s;tances of &s;uch Part of the Town&s;hips afore&s;aid, as are included in the old Patents, are materially different, in many Re&s;pects, from the Circum&s;tances of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Grants in general; it will therefore be nece&s;&s;ary that this Matter have a particular Con&s;ideration; and that none of the afore&s;aid Arguments be con&s;idered in this Ca&s;e but what are truly applicable: and in this Review of the Ca&s;e, it will be admitted, that the old <HI>Wallum&s;cock</HI> Patent includes &s;uch Part of <HI>Bennington,</HI> as the Plan the Patentees exhibit doth contain.</P>
<P>IT is taken for granted that the Royal Determin|ation of the boundary Line in 1764 cou'd not ex|tend the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> antecedent to the Date of that Order, which was a Manife&s;tation of Royal Power, and which was the &s;ole Cau&s;e of that Extention; therefore, at the Time the Govern|ment of <HI>New-York</HI> granted the forementioned old Patents, they could have no greater Authority for &s;o doing than what they were then in Fact po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of: It remains therefore to be con&s;idered, whether the Patents from the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> are va|lid or not, &s;o far as they interfere with the Town|&s;hips
<PB N="134" REF="013102_0132_0F8EBB646A9A24A8">of <HI>Bennington</HI> and <HI>Pownal.</HI> And Fir&s;tly, it has been proved that the Province of <HI>New-York</HI> as di&s;cribed in their Governor's Commi&s;&s;ions, doth not extend &s;o far North as the City of <HI>Albany;</HI> there|fore, the Northern Tracts of Country which the&s;e Patents of <HI>Hoo&s;ick</HI> and <HI>Wallum&s;cock</HI> cover, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as belonging to their &s;econd Sort of Domain, (to wit) the Territories. It has al&s;o been &s;hewn, that the&s;e Territories are not circum&s;cribed to any particular Limits, but that they were origi|nally meant to include &s;ome ancient Grants that were Independent of the Province and adjoining Settlements, on Extra-provincial Lands: probably that Government may have Authority to grant Land to the We&s;t and North-We&s;t, where it is in|di&s;putably unappropriated, and where the Claim of none other Government could interfere: But it will be in&s;i&s;ted upon, on the Part of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Settlers, which are included in the afore|&s;aid old Patents, that the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> had no Right to extend any of their Patents to the Ea&s;tward of a Line equivalent to that which con|&s;titutes the Bounds between <HI>New-York</HI> and the Co|lonies of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts:</HI> This Li|mit was ever thought by the People in general of the Colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> as well as tho&s;e of the ad|jacent Colonies, to be the Ea&s;tern Boundary of <HI>New-York,</HI> until the Aera of the late Determination, which extended it to the River <HI>Connecticut:</HI> and la|bouring Men that &s;upport the World of Mankind, are obliged to form their Judgments of the Juri&s;|diction of Government's by the common received Opinions of Mankind they are conver&s;ant with;
<PB N="135" REF="013102_0133_0F8EBAD2AB05A430">and even admitting they make an erroneous Judg|ment, yet, in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, as the Lands were of but little Value, exclu&s;ive of their Toil and Culti|vation; and as the Farmers in Reality uphold the State, it is therefore not only incumbent on the Laws, but on the Policy of the State to defend them in Ca&s;es of this Nature&mdash;it mu&s;t be admitted that where the Limits of Governments are clearly a&s;certained and notoriou&s;ly known, that a Farmer tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing in this Manner on another's Property, mu&s;t bear the Lo&s;s: But, provided a Country of People be generally under a Deception as to Mat|ters of Juri&s;diction, and purcha&s;e Land and make great Improvements, and all on a mi&s;taken Foot|ing, Men in &s;uch Circum&s;tances &s;hould be con&s;i|dered in the mo&s;t favourable Light. For, as not only Individuals, but the Country about them were in the &s;ame Manner deceived, and therefore, at the Time of purcha&s;ing and Settlement, they were ut|terly de&s;titute of the Means of Knowledge; yet, however, it is not conceded to, that tho&s;e Farmers on who&s;e Account the pre&s;ent Arguments are ex|hibited, are under a Deception about this Matter; for of all Sorts of governmental Juri&s;diction, the <HI>New-York</HI> Territorial was the weake&s;t, loo&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t vague; it was rather occa&s;ional and political, than po&s;itive, and in it's own Nature almo&s;t or quite incapable of being extended fa&s;ter than Settlements were actually carried on, or at mo&s;t the Lands ex|po&s;ed to this territorial Juri&s;diction, &s;hould not be patented fa&s;ter than his Maje&s;ty's Subjects are di&s;|po&s;ed forthwith to &s;ettle. The Nece&s;&s;ity of grant|ing &s;o fa&s;t may be pleaded on Account of Order&mdash;the
<PB N="136" REF="013102_0134_0F8EBB68D2BB8840">Policy of Government may demand it; other|wi&s;e an occa&s;ional Juri&s;diction would be altogether unable to abilitate the Government to make Con|veyance of the Right in Fee; although it is indi&s;|putable that &s;uch a Juri&s;diction in Matters of meer Government, is to all Intents and Purpo&s;es, equal to po&s;itive Juri&s;diction; but with Re&s;pect to hav|ing a Power to convey the Fee of Lands, is Matter of Doubt: But thus much with Propriety may be inferred, that a Title &s;o weak and impotent &s;hould not claim Superiority over the lea&s;t Conception of Title whatever; a meer Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is of it&s;elf abun|dantly &s;ufficient to maintain the Right in the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or, and on a judicious Tryal at common Law, (cou'd &s;uch an One be had) would be judged Pa|ramount to it.</P>
<P>There is another Con&s;ideration that mu&s;t totally extingui&s;h and obliterate all po&s;&s;ible remaining Idea of Right, that the Patentees of <HI>Wallum&s;cock</HI> may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have to the &s;aid Tract of Land includ|ed in the Limits of the Town&s;hip of <HI>Bennington.</HI> Only advert to the Date of that Patent, which is on the 15th Day of June, 1739, and compare it with the Time of the Commencement of the Set|tlement of <HI>Bennington,</HI> which was in the Spring of the Year 1760, and there will be found to be 21 Years, from the Date of this Patent, to the begin|ning of the Settlement under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire;</HI>&mdash;in all this Time there was not the lea&s;t Settlement or Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion made in the Premi&s;es; although the ex|pre&s;s Condition of the Patent was, that it &s;hould be &s;ettled in three Years from the Time of granting.
<PB N="137" REF="013102_0135_0F8EBB6982919BA8">Po&s;&s;ibly in all that Time the Patentees might have got &s;ome Dutch Tenants on &s;ome We&s;tern Part of the Patent, which, with the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> may be denominated a Fulfilment of the Condition of Settlement; many large Tracts hav|ing been patented, &s;ome &s;ince, and others longer ago than that <HI>Wallum&s;cock,</HI> which are yet mo&s;tly a howling Wilderne&s;s. This Practice of the Go|vernment of <HI>New-York,</HI> in extending their Patents to the Ea&s;tward of a Twenty Mile Line from <HI>Hud|&s;on</HI>'s River, hath ever been con&s;idered as a di&s;inge|nious and de&s;igning Policy in that Government; thereby to lay a Foundation for intruding on the Rights of their neighbouring Colonies; and has been attended with many di&s;agreeable Con&s;equen|ces, as has been before ob&s;erved. And as that Government have given up their exorbitant Claims where they interfered with the Right of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts,</HI> it would undoubtedly be their wi&s;e&s;t Way to do the &s;ame with Re&s;pect to &s;uch Claims as in|terfere with the Right granted under the great Seal of the Province of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire;</HI> and in&s;tead of treating the People that have &s;ettled tho&s;e Lands under that Title, as Rioters and Felons; to exerci&s;e that Ju&s;tice and Humanity towards them, which becometh Governors, to the governed.</P>
<P>IT remains &s;till, that there be a &s;ummary View exhibited, relative to the Rule of Right which &s;hould take Place with Re&s;pect to the Settlers un|der each Government, that are &s;ettled on &s;uch Part of the forementioned Patents as are included in the Town&s;hips of <HI>Bennington</HI> and <HI>Pownal.</HI> And al|though
<PB N="138" REF="013102_0136_0F8EBB6A2AAC2220">Superiority of Title is in Favour of tho&s;e under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire;</HI> neverthele&s;s, as the Line of Juri&s;diction, in tho&s;e Times of granting and Settle|ment, was not expre&s;ly a&s;certained or known.&mdash;Under the&s;e Circum&s;tances, it would not only be bad State-policy, but great Inhumanity and Inju&s;|tice to the Subject; for either the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> or <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them, let them have &s;ettled under the Title of either; for Titles liable to &s;o much Di&s;pute and Uncertainty as both mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to be (though One may have much the Preference of the Other) are not &s;ufficient to ou&s;t the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, ina&s;much as both challenge a legal Right; therefore, either Title, &s;ealed and confirmed with the Sweat and Toil of the Farmer is abundantly paramount to the Other.</P>
<P>OUR Authors, in their Appendix, Page 19th, mi&s;-repre&s;ent the Plea of the <HI>Bennington</HI> People, in &s;aying, <Q>To rea&s;on on their own Principles, if Equity confirmed the Claims of Others under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> on Account of Priority of in|terfering Grants, it would have afforded a fatal Plea again&s;t the People of <HI>Bennington;</HI> becau&s;e they ought then them&s;elves to have yielded up all the Lands which are covered by more anti|ent Patents.</Q> The People of <HI>Bennington,</HI> or ra|ther the Claimants under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> have e|ver in&s;i&s;ted, that at the Time the Government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> granted tho&s;e Lands, they had good Right &s;o to do; but that <HI>New-York</HI> had not. This Matter is illu&s;trated and proved by many Argu|ments, and real Facts, in this Treati&s;e, particularly
<PB N="139" REF="013102_0137_0F8EBB6AF1647090">in the 2d and 3d Sections, to which the Reader is referred.

<HEAD><HI>The Depo&s;ition of</HI> James Hender&s;on <HI>and</HI> David Bri|dea, <HI>is as follows:</HI></HEAD>
<P>THAT, on or about the 19th Day of June, 1773. we arrived from <HI>Scotland</HI> at <HI>New-York</HI>&mdash;&s;oon after
<PB N="153" REF="013102_0151_0F8EBB74D99846D0">our Arrival, we met with Col. <HI>Reid,</HI> in <HI>New-York,</HI> who invited us to &s;ettle under him in the County of <HI>Charlette,</HI> on Lands which he &s;aid he owned in that County. We being Strangers to the Coun|try, and not knowing there was any Di&s;pute or Controver&s;y about Land in America, thought be&s;t to accept of his Offer; and accordingly agreed to go with him, on the following Terms, viz. That we &s;hould have a Lea&s;e of our Land forever, with the fir&s;t &s;even Years free from Rent, and after that, Six Pence per Acre yearly, and to deliver to him at his Mill or Mills, the Tenth Part of our Grain yearly, and not to cut any Timber, &s;ave what the clearing our Lands required. On the afore&s;aid Agreement we &s;et out from <HI>New-York,</HI> with &s;aid <HI>Reid,</HI> and when we arrived at Fort <HI>Miller,</HI> we hear'd tho&s;e Lands that we agreed for, were in Di&s;|pute; on which we went to &s;aid <HI>Reid,</HI> and ac|quainted him, that if his Lands were in Di&s;pute, we rather cho&s;e to turn back, than to go any fur|ther; but he affirmed to us, that his Land was not in Di&s;pute, and that he would put us in peaceable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and protect us there. On this Encour|agement we went forward as far as Fort <HI>George,</HI> where we heard the News of the Di&s;pute again con|firmed to us; on which &s;ome of our Company would have turned back, but Col. <HI>Reid</HI> refu&s;ed to let them go, a&s;&s;uring us that the Lands was not in any Conte&s;t, and that he would compel us to go forward. After this we went to <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> where we under&s;tood that the Land to which we were going, was granted to the Settlers that were on it by the Governor of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and that they
<PB N="154" REF="013102_0152_0F8EBB7571603688">would not give up their Title, it being antecedent to <HI>New-York</HI> Patents. After hearing that we &s;hould have Trouble, we ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to go any further, telling Col. <HI>Reid</HI> that we did not come to <HI>America</HI> to fight for any Man's Title, nor to take away any Man's Property, and de&s;ired we might go back to <HI>New-York;</HI> but he refu&s;ed, al|ledging that we &s;hould fulfil our Agreement, and, that there was a Parcel of <HI>Yankies,</HI> or <HI>New-England</HI> Men, &s;ettled all over America, without any Right or Title to their Lands, and he would put us in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and defend us there. After this, he brought us to the Mouth of <HI>Otter Creek,</HI> and then he ordered every Man to load his Gun; but I, viz. <HI>James Hender&s;on,</HI> refu&s;ed to load mine. Next Morning, at the Falls of &s;aid <HI>Creek,</HI> he a&s;k'd me where my Firelock was? I replied, it was in the Battoe. Ay! Damn you! &s;aid he, you dare not load your Firelock&mdash;you will make a bad Soldier. After this we went to <HI>New-Haven,</HI> a Town above the Falls, where we found large Improvements made, and the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI>'s actually in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on with their Families, which Families &s;aid <HI>Reid</HI> turned out, and put us, with the Re&s;t of our Com|pany, in their Place&mdash;then he &s;aid, there was no further Danger, and went back and left us to keep Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Hou&s;es and Improvements. Soon after this, came a large Number of armed Men which &s;tiled them&s;elves the <HI>Green-Mountain-Boys,</HI> and they demanded of us if we were <HI>Reid</HI>'s Settlers? We replied that we were. Then they informed us that their Bu&s;ine&s;s was to di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;s us, alledging that tho&s;e Lands were antecedent|ly
<PB N="155" REF="013102_0153_0F8EBB764CE32220">granted to them by the Government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and that they would keep Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them 'till his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure was further known, Then they ordered our Goods and Effects to be ta|ken out of the Hou&s;es, that none of them &s;hould be hurt, which was done; and then they demoli&s;h|ed and burned the Hou&s;es, which were made with large Logs, but nothing of our Hou&s;hold Goods were burned. Next Day they pulled down a Gri&s;t Mill of &s;aid <HI>Reid</HI>'s, and there was a &s;mall Stack of Hay burned; which they &s;aid accidentally took Fire; and that if they could find out that any of their Men put Fire to it, they &s;hould pay for the Hay; for, they &s;aid, they did not approve that any of the Effects of the Earth &s;hould be de|&s;troyed. Their Hor&s;es likewi&s;e de&s;troyed &s;ome of the Wheat and Corn, but they did not otherways abu&s;e our Per&s;ons, Effects or Families; neither did they exclaim again&s;t governmental Authority, but con|&s;tantly affirmed that they would maintain their Pro|perty, and defend it from the Incur&s;ion of Col. <HI>Ried,</HI> or any other Claims from <HI>New-York,</HI> until his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure &s;hould be further known.

<HEAD>SECTION VIII.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Authors in the Twenty Seventh and fi|ni&s;hing Page of their Narrative, di&s;cover great Invention and Subtilty, who after giving an Ac|count of the unfortunate Circum&s;tances of the Town of <HI>Hin&s;dale</HI> which has, &s;ay they, <Q>been taken up by a Royal Mandamus.</Q> This Town|&s;hip had fir&s;t been granted by the Government of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay,</HI> and upon the Settlement of the Boundary-Line between the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> in 1739, it fell within the latter, and by them granted, and fully ratified to the In|habitants and Proprietors, who in Addition to their Title, had al&s;o the Indian Right. This Town&s;hip, by the Determination of the Boundary Line between <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> fell within the Juri&s;diction of the former, and was by them granted to Col. <HI>Howard,</HI> after it had been &s;ettled about Seventy Years. The A&s;&s;embly of <HI>New-York</HI> in Order to &s;creen their Government from the Imputation of the Blame ju&s;tly due to &s;o reprehen&s;ible a Conduct, endeavour to palm it on the Government at Home, &s;ee Page Sixth, with Re&s;pect to <Q><HI>Hin&s;dale,</HI> a Town&s;hip in the South Ea&s;t Corner of <HI>Cumberland</HI> County: Even this is not to be a&s;cribed to our Government, it pro|ceeded from a much greater, and the highe&s;t Authority: A Mandamus was produced from the Crown, on the Report of the Board of Trade, and by the Advice of the Privy Coun|cil, which ve&s;ted the Grantee with a Right of Election, an Act deci&s;ive in it&s;elf, and &s;uper|ceding
<PB N="158" REF="013102_0156_0F8EBB7B18A9CC08">the Agency of the Governor and Coun|cil here, and the u&s;ual Forms.</Q> A very Ex|traordinary Repre&s;entation! The Nature of a Roy|al Mandamus is diametrically oppo&s;ite to this Interpretation: The Right of Election in the Grantees, is re&s;tricted entirely to Crown Lands which are unapropriated; in &s;uch Lands, the Gran|tee has a Right of Election, and common Sen&s;e may teach, that neither a Mandamus or any o|ther Crown Grant can &s;ubvert the Property which the Subject holds under the Crown by Prior Grants; and, though there be ever &s;o many Al|terations in the Juri&s;diction, &s;undry of which have perplexed the Town of <HI>Hin&s;dale,</HI> yet this &s;hould have no Effect on the Property of the Subjects.&mdash;The&s;e Grantees are likewi&s;e withheld from inter|fereing on the Right of the Indian Subjects.&mdash;Yet, it &s;eems Col. <HI>Howard</HI> had the Vanity to lo|cate his Mandamus on the old Plantation of <HI>Hin&s;dale,</HI> which was fir&s;tly appropriated by a Pur|cha&s;e from the <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;econdly, by a Grant from the Government of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay,</HI> and thirdly, by the Government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and fourthly, by an uninterupted Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Occupancy about Seventy Years.</P>
<P>THE Subterfuge the Gentlemen make U&s;e of, to rid their Government from Di&s;honour, in making this la&s;t Grant of <HI>Hin&s;dale,</HI> is very extra|ordinary; it &s;eems not well calculated <Q>to be tran&s;mitted for the Information of the Govern|ment at <HI>Home!</HI></Q> who are undoubtedly compe|tent Judges of their own Mandamus's, and no
<PB N="159" REF="013102_0157_0F8EBB7BEE0F6D78">Doubt will ea&s;ily di&s;cern their La&s;t Error to be wor&s;e than the Fir&s;t. Such prepo&s;terous grant|ing of Lands, is Criminally injurious to the Sub|ject, as it never fails to embarra&s;s the different Claimants with many concomitant Difficulties. Yet, &s;till to ca&s;t the Blame due to their Govern|ment, on the King's Mandamus, is more dar|ingly injurious to the highe&s;t Authority in the Nation.</P>
<P>LASTLY, the manner of Redre&s;s pre&s;cribed for the Sufferers, viz. the old Proprietors of <HI>Hin&s;dale,</HI> is the mo&s;t &s;hocking Piece of Contrivance, Page 27, <Q><HI>Hin&s;dale,</HI> a &s;mall Town&s;hip which has late|ly been taken up by Virtue of a Royal Mandamus, is alone unfortunate&mdash;but even here the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors may be relieved, by a &s;uit|able Compen&s;ation, equal to the Value of their Improvements in Crown Lands, free from the Ex|pence of Fees.</Q> The&s;e Gentlemen in their great Clemency have al&s;o conceded that the <HI>New-Hamp|&s;hire</HI> Settlers in general may be thus con&s;idered, <Q>On the &s;ame Terms, may be a&s;&s;igned to each of tho&s;e who are &s;eated on the Soil, actually ap|propriated to others by the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> and the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of which can|not for that Rea&s;on be confirmed; &s;uch a Pro|portion of Crown Lands, as the Governor and Council &s;hall judge to be adequate to their re|&s;pective Improvements.</Q></P>
<P>THEN they proceed to de&s;cribe the Tract, <Q>A Fertile and exten&s;ive Country, in the north|ern
<PB N="160" REF="013102_0158_0F8EBB7C2BCB70E8">Part of the County of <HI>Charlotte,</HI> and be|tween <HI>Connecticut</HI> River and Lake <HI>Cham|plain,</HI> &s;till remains unpatented by either Go|vernment; and might be planted and culti|vated by the&s;e People:</Q>&mdash;What a &s;urpri&s;ing Conde&s;cention this! the Po&s;terity of the Original Proprietors of <HI>Hin&s;dale,</HI> e&s;pecially, to be allowed the Privilege to pull up Sakes, quit their Farms and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, Hou&s;es, Orchards, &amp;c. and join Company with the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Settlers in ge|neral, and trudge off to the North-Ea&s;t Part of the Wilderne&s;s of <HI>Charlotte,</HI> and there commence another Settlement, leaving their plea&s;ant Habi|tations, Fields, Tenements, and Country, in Ex|change for a howling Wilderne&s;s; a pretty Ex|change!&mdash;and this to gratify a number of <HI>New-York</HI> Cormorants. But, let's &s;top a little and con&s;ider&mdash;whether it would not be more Righ|teous to change the Scene, and &s;o the <HI>New-York</HI> Patentees remove their Patents, that interfere with the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Grants, and lay them in the Wilderne&s;s of <HI>Charlotte,</HI> as neither Government have appropriated it.</P>
<P>A &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to be offered in favour of the latter of the&s;e Projects, is, that the Settlers under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> are in Deed, and in Truth the right and lawful Owners and Proprietors of the Lands they po&s;&s;e&s;s, as, 'tis apprehended, has been fully demon&s;trated in the preceding Sec|tions. Although the&s;e Gentlemen have, in the Cour&s;e of their Narration, flung out very extra|ordinary Hints of rewarding his Maje&s;ty's Sol|diery,
<PB N="161" REF="013102_0159_0F8EBB7FD8E9C6F0">by the Di&s;tribution of tho&s;e Lands, yet, they may here again be reminded, (which may fur|ther &s;erve as the above Rea&s;on) that his Maje&s;ty's Proclamation directed the Soldiery to make their Pitches on unappropriated and vacant Lands; this therefore, they mu&s;t do, at the Hazard of lo&s;|ing their Grants, or repitching. For tho&s;e Lands which being antecedently granted by the Crown, by the Agency of the Governor and Council of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> mu&s;t forever exclude the Soldie|ry from pitching thereon; and put it entirely out of the Power of the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> or the Crown, to grant them to a Second Per&s;on. And when it is con&s;idered, that the <HI>New-York</HI> Land-Jobbers have, long &s;ince purcha&s;ed great Part of the Soldiery Rights, and that for a mere Trifle, and laid them out of them&s;elves, at their own Ri&s;que; their Arguments on that Subject, cannot contribute greatly to the Removal of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Settlers, to the exterior Part of <HI>Charlotte.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Authors have given a tedious Hi&s;tory of the Suits at Law, which have been commenced, by the <HI>New-York</HI> Patentees, again&s;t the Claim|ants, and Occupants under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and have exhibited many &s;pecious Appearances of Fair|ne&s;s, Equity, and Impartiality in their Tryals. However, the Reader mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that in eve|ry of tho&s;e, &s;o boa&s;ted of, candid Tryals, the Defendants, by the Re&s;ult, were to be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s|ed of their Farms. They then continue to tell of the entire Satisfaction of the Vanqui&s;hed, (toge|ther
<PB N="162" REF="013102_0160_0F8EBB80C1513050">with &s;uch or the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Claimants at attended the Courts) relative to the Validity of the <HI>New-York</HI> Title.&mdash;Soon after this, they give a &s;urpri&s;ing Account of Riots and Outrages, com|mitted by the&s;e Settlers, and mention <HI>Allen</HI> by Name, (who they &s;ay, but a little before was &s;o fully per&s;uaded of the Validity of the <HI>New-York</HI> Ti|tle) as one of their Leaders. This Narrative is in it|&s;elf incredible, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that Men who were convinced, they had had an impartial Try|al at Law, and of the In&s;ufficiency of their own Title, and the Authenticity of that of their Op|ponents, would rally to arm, in Defiance of legal Authority, and in Defence of their own invalid Ti|tle; e&s;pecially, after they had publickly declar|ed their own Sentiments concerning that Mat|ter.</P>
<P>THIS A&s;&s;embly &s;eem profu&s;ely lavi&s;h in the Prai&s;e of their own Government, concerning the Genero&s;ity, Forbearance and Humanity, &amp;c. they have exerci&s;ed towards the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Settlers; and that nothing of that Sort may here pa&s;s un|noticed, but that every Act, by them done, worthy of &s;uch Appellations, may be duly acknowledged; it will be freely confe&s;&s;ed that Governor <HI>Tryon,</HI> and the Majority of his Maje&s;ty's Council, conduc|ted with Honour and Humanity toward them; while his Excellency was in the Admini&s;tration, except in pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome very extraordinary Laws on the 9th of March, 1774, which may be &s;een in the fore Part of this Treati&s;e, under the Head of the Narrative: But tho&s;e Settlers mu&s;t have that
<PB N="163" REF="013102_0161_0F8EBB81EF954A28">Charity for his Excellency, as to conclude he, would not have put his Sanction to tho&s;e Laws, had he not known the &s;aid Settlers called the <HI>Green Mountain-Boys</HI> to be very expert with Fire-Arms and likewi&s;e very good Wood&s;ers; and con&s;e|quently, that the <HI>New-York</HI> Land-jobbers cou'd not put the&s;e Laws in Execution. To view this Matter in any other Light, they would be obliged to di&s;tru&s;t the Fidelity of their worthy Friend Gover|nor <HI>Tryon.</HI> But to return to the Subject of Gene|ro&s;ity. The A&s;&s;embly of <HI>New-York</HI> are unwi&s;e to make &s;o great a Bu&s;tle about this Matter, ina&s;much as they have &s;poiled the Joke them&s;elves, by their &s;o infamous a Propo&s;al of Accommodation, which as has been before ob&s;erved, is, that the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Settlers remove to the Wilderne&s;s of <HI>Charlotte,</HI> in Order to gratify a certain Fraternity with the Country they have with much Toil and Expence &s;ubdued: We have a very beautiful Repre|&s;entation of this <HI>New-York</HI> Beneficence by a wi&s;e Author, <Q>the tender Mercies of the Wicked are Cruelty.</Q>&mdash;Now follows another Quotation from our Authors, which is no le&s;s than a barefaced In&s;ult on tho&s;e Inhabitants, and one of the bolde&s;t of Mi&s;repre&s;entations. <Q>If the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Claimants imagined that they were aggrieved by the Deci&s;ions of our Judges, the Means of Re|dre&s;s were in their own Power; and they ought to have &s;ued their Writs of Error, and in the legal and ordinary Mode, to have referred their Cau&s;e to the final Sentence of his Maje&s;ty: But to expect a Remedy incompatible with the Ad|mini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, and the Rights of the

<P>COULD they once get this e&s;tabli&s;hed, that there &s;hould be no Acce&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, or Trial, but in this "ordinary Mode," it would no doubt, be to their entire Satisfaction; Tryals in that Go|vernment would then ea&s;ily become deci&s;ive; for in no Ca&s;e, wherein the Demand of the Plain|tiff is below the Sum of Five Hundred Pounds, a Writ of Error in Favour of the Defendant can i&s;&s;ue. And the <HI>New-York</HI> Attornies who com|piled the <HI>New-York</HI> Statings, and are al&s;o Paten|tees under that Government, well knew that eve|ry Action brought again&s;t the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Claimants has been de&s;ignedly laid below that Sum. Yet they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that extreme Boldne&s;s to aver in expre&s;s Terms, that, <Q>if the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Claimants imagined, that they were aggrieved, by the Deci&s;ions of <HI>their</HI> Judges, their Means of Redre&s;s were in their own Power.</Q> <HI>i. e.</HI> by Way of a Writ of Er|ror.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing exhibited in this <HI>New-York</HI> Pamphlet which more &s;en&s;ibly de&s;erves Re&s;entment than their Preten&s;ions of Indulgencies, Favours, &amp;c. conferred on the&s;e Claimants by that Govern|ment&mdash;<Q>To the Honor of the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> it may ju&s;tly be a&s;&s;erted, that the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Claimants have received every Mark of Favour and Indulgence which the Cir|cum&s;tances permitted.</Q> Such Hypocri&s;y de|ba&s;es
<PB N="165" REF="013102_0163_0F8EBB82ED033950">Human Nature, is the Pe&s;t of Society, par|takes of Fal&s;hood and Treachery; and what ren|ders it peculiarly vile, is, that it u&s;urps the Seat of Virtue, and de&s;troys Faith in Communities, and is the Source of cruel Jealou&s;y. Had the Go|vernment of <HI>New-York</HI> been truly friendly to tho&s;e Settlers, it had been return'd again; and mutual Good Will &s;upplied the Place of Hatred an Strife. But, alas! &s;o long as the Fee of the Country of the <HI>New Hamp&s;hire</HI> Grants is the Object in View, by the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> how it is po&s;&s;ible for Peace and good Order to take Place, can't well be conceived.

And that they can take and execute &s;ome of the leading Men among the&s;e Inhabitants; and &s;o frighten and impo&s;e on the Re&s;t; and finally, by this Means, avail them&s;elves of their E&s;tates and Property. This is all they can de&s;ire in continu|ing this Country under their Juri&s;diction. That they have in Reality a View to this, will further appear, by &s;ome memorable Sentences recorded in the 25th Page of their Appendix. "We may," &s;ay they, <Q>readily conceive, that <HI>Breakenridge,</HI> and his Party, have abundant Rea&s;on to wi&s;h
<PB N="166" REF="013102_0164_0F8EBB83B5CE8170">for an Alteration of Juri&s;diction. The public Crimes, and private Wrongs which they have perpetrated, mu&s;t make them look forward to the Hour of Tranquility, with the mo&s;t anxious Apprehen&s;ions. The injured may then demand Satisfaction for all their Sufferings.&mdash;An A|tonement mu&s;t then be made to the Country, for the Violation of it's Laws.</Q> Here the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Settlers may read their intended Doom, in Con&s;equence of the Ability of the Government of <HI>New-York.</HI> And one Rea&s;on why this Govern|ment have not already de&s;troyed the Inhabitants of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Grants, with Fire and Sword, is their Want of Ability; and this Inability, in great Part, con&s;i&s;ts in this, that the common Peo|ple in the Government, are univer&s;ally of Opinion that the Inhabitants have a good Right to tho&s;e Lands, and &s;hould not be mole&s;ted in the peaceable Enjoyment of them; and con&s;equently will not a&s;|&s;i&s;t their Civil Officers, in taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Tenements, or them as Rioters. That they are no further turbulent than what is nece&s;&s;ary to de|fend their Per&s;ons and Properties, from the Cruelty and Monopoly of their Rulers. This is the Ground of all the Lenity, Forbearance and Indul|gence of that Government towards tho&s;e Inhabi|tants; and it is hoped, if the&s;e exce&s;&s;ive Favours &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed over without their Thanks, they may yet be excu&s;ed for the Neglect.</P>

<P>AS THE De&s;ign of this Section was, in a conci&s;e Manner, to point out &s;ome of the mo&s;t notorious Extravagancies of the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> the Subject can't with Propriety be pa&s;&s;ed over, without taking a &s;hort Review of the forementioned Laws of that Colony, which are the mo&s;t apparent Portrai|ture of their horrid Malevolence and Caprice.

Laws and Society-Compacts were originally de&s;igned to protect the Subjects in their Property. Loyalty and Subordination to

<P><HI>WHEREAS his Honor,</HI> CADWALLADER COLDEN, <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Lieutenant-Governor, and Commander in Chief of his Maje&s;ty's Province of</HI> New-York, <HI>bath lately i&s;|&s;ued a Proclamation, of a very extraordinary Nature, &s;et|ting forth, that King</HI> CHARLES <HI>the Second, on the</HI> 12th <HI>Day of March,</HI> 1663-4, <HI>and the</HI> 29th <HI>June,</HI> 1674, <HI>did, by his &s;everal Letters Patent, of tho&s;e Dates, grant in Fee to his Brother, the Duke of York, among other Things, all the Land from the We&s;t Side of</HI> Connecti|cut <HI>River to the Ea&s;t Side of Delaware Bay; and therein al&s;o &s;et forth, and de&s;cribes the Bounds of</HI> New-Hamp&s;hire; <HI>in which Di&s;cription there is a very material Mi&s;take; be&s;ides, there is omitted the Fact, on which the Di&s;cription of</HI> New-Hamp&s;hire <HI>depended, viz. His Maje&s;ty's Determination of the North and We&s;tern Boundaries of the Province of the</HI> Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts-Bay, <HI>in</HI> 1739. <HI>And nothing can be more evi|dent, than that</HI> New-Hamp&s;hire <HI>may legally extend her We&s;tern Boundary as far as the</HI> Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts <HI>Claim reaches, and &s;he claims no more; but</HI> New-York <HI>pretend to claim even to the Banks of</HI> Connecticut <HI>Ri|ver, although &s;he never laid out and &s;ettled one Town in that Part of his Maje&s;ty's Lands, &s;ince &s;he exi&s;ted as a Government.</HI></P>
<P><HI>When</HI> New-York <HI>Government extends her Ea&s;tern Boundary, to the Banks of</HI> Connecticut <HI>River, be|tween</HI> New-York <HI>and the Colony of</HI> Connecticut; <HI>and

<P><HI>At pre&s;ent, the Boundaries of</HI> New-York, <HI>to the Northward, are unknown, and as &s;oon as it &s;hall be his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure to determine them,</HI> New-Hamp|&s;hire <HI>will pay ready and chearful Obedience thereunto, not doubting but that all Grants made by</HI> New-Hamp|&s;hire, <HI>that are fulfilled by the Grantees, will be confirm|ed to them, if it &s;hould be his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure to alter the Juri&s;diction.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For political Rea&s;ons, the Claim to Juri&s;diction by</HI> New-York, <HI>might have been deferred, as well as the &s;trict Injunction on the Civil Power, to exerci&s;e Juri&s;|diction in their re&s;pective Functions, as far as the Ea&s;|tern Banks of</HI> Connecticut <HI>River.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The &s;aid Proclamation carrying an Air of Govern|ment in it, may po&s;&s;ibly affect and retard the Settlement of his Maje&s;ty's Lands, granted by this Government: For preventing an Injury to the Crown, of this Kind, and
<PB N="172" REF="013102_0170_0F8EBB8AA7DB23E8">to remove all Doubts that may ari&s;e to Per&s;ons holding the King's Grants, they may be a&s;&s;ured, that the Patent to the Duke of York is ob&s;olete, and cannot convey any certain Boundary to</HI> New-York, <HI>that can be claimed as a Boundary, as plainly appears by the &s;everal Boundary Lines of the</HI> Jer&s;ies <HI>on the We&s;t, and the Colony of</HI> Con|necticut <HI>on the Ea&s;t, which are &s;et forth in the Procla|mation, as Part only of the Land included in the &s;aid Patent to the Duke of</HI> York.</P>
<P><HI>To the End therefore, that the Grantees now &s;ettled and &s;ettling on tho&s;e Lands, under his late and pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's Charters, may not be intimidated, or any Way hindered or ob&s;tructed in the Improvement of the Lands &s;o granted, as well as to a&s;certain the Right, and maintain the Juri&s;diction of His Maje&s;ty's Government of</HI> New-Hamp&s;hire, <HI>as far We&s;tward as to include the Grants made:</HI></P>

<P>THE A&s;&s;embly of <HI>New-York</HI> have been very particular in their Hi&s;tory of the Tumults and Ri|ots made by tho&s;e Settlers, in Oppo&s;ition to that Government, (many of which Facts mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed to be true) though they have carefully o|mitted their manyfold Provocations, yet, with all their Particularity have given but a very imper|fect Idea of tho&s;e Tran&s;actions. I &s;hall here, there|fore, waving particulars, give a general Review of the Oeconomy of tho&s;e Settlers in their Oppo&s;i|tions to that Government. For defending their Properties, they were indicted Rioters, the next Thing was to defend Rioters; then they had two Objects as the Subjects of their Protection, viz. their Per&s;ons, as well as Property: They were at Fir&s;t greatly intimidated at the empty Appear|ance of Law, that their Opponents were &s;o con|ver&s;ant with, &s;ometimes de&s;pairing of maintaining their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; yet upon Extremity, rather than quit their Sub&s;tance to the in&s;atiable Ravi&s;hers, would rally and fru&s;trate their De&s;igns: Thus, when the Sheriff of the County of <HI>Albany</HI> with his Po&s;&s;e came to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome of them, they mo&s;t generally, boldly took up Arms, and appointed Leaders. Matters having come to this, not long
<PB N="182" REF="013102_0180_0F8EBB9800A17BD8">after, the Inhabitants a&s;&s;embled and appointed Committees of Safety in the &s;everal Towns through|out their Settlement; this general Committee have the conducting of the Public Affairs of the Coun|try for its Security, 'till his Maje&s;ty &s;ettles the Controver&s;y. They have erected &s;everal Compa|nies, which by the Votes of the Soldiers are fur|ni&s;hed with Officers, the&s;e Companies form a Re|giment which are known by the &s;ignificant Cha|racter of GREEN-MOUNTAIN BOYS, who are ge|nerally in the Prime of Life, well ver&s;ed in the U&s;e of Fire-Arms, and of robu&s;t Con&s;titutions; probably no American Regiment in an interior Defence could excel them, or that would willing|ly contribute more to the Support of the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> for it is ob&s;ervable, that &s;uch Subjects that will not fight for their Property, will never fight for their King: And, the general In|&s;tructions from the Committee, ever have been, not to act in any thing again&s;t the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> but on the Defen&s;ive.</P>
<P>IT is in the Nature of Things impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s a right Judgment on the Conduct of the <HI>New-Hamp|&s;hire</HI> Settlers, without taking into View the Treat|ment of the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> towards them. All Ca&s;es mu&s;t be determined upon the peculiar Cir|cum&s;tances attending; no Act can &s;carcely be con|ceived of which, under certain attending Circum|&s;tances might not be lawful.

<PB N="183" REF="013102_0181_0F8EBAD0903D8FF0">tho&s;e Lands; and that they are Intruders, and by Force and Violence have maintained &s;uch En|croachments, then, they are truly guilty, in man|ner as the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>New-York</HI> have alledged: But on the Contrary, if tho&s;e Settlers have a legal and inconte&s;tible Right to tho&s;e Lands, that they pro&s;ecute Settlement on the good Faith of that Title, and the &s;undry Approbations of both their Title and Settlement from the Briti&s;h Admini&s;|tration, then, they are not guilty in Manner as tho&s;e Gentlemen have declared; and the impar|tial Public, in&s;tead of viewing them as U&s;urpers, Rioters and Felons, will ju&s;tify them in their Con|duct, and e&s;teem them as good Members of Soci|ety, leige Subjects to the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and good Soldiers for defending their Per&s;ons and Properties.</P>
<P>THUS, is humbly &s;ubmitted the State of the Con|trover&s;y, which has for many Years &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the Government of <HI>New-York</HI> and the Settlers under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire;</HI> by impartial Ju&s;|tice mu&s;t every Act &s;tand or fall; if tho&s;e Settlers are in the wrong, they are criminally &s;o, but if not, then the Allegations of their Opponents will be adjudged as futile and cruel.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION, TO THE APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS the <HI>French</HI> Government of <HI>Canada</HI> have made &s;undry Grants of &s;ome of the mo&s;t valu|able Part of tho&s;e Lands in Di&s;pute, between the Govern|ment of <HI>New-York</HI> and the Claimants under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> on the Ea&s;terly Side of Lake <HI>Champlain,</HI> and even to the Southward of <HI>Crown-Point.</HI> And whereas the General A&s;&s;embly of the Colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> in their State of the Rights of that Colony, &s;o far as concerns the <HI>French</HI> Grants afore&s;aid, have very in|geniou&s;ly confuted the <HI>French</HI> Claim to tho&s;e Lands; &s;hall therefore &s;ubjoin it as an Appendix to this Treati&s;e, in a&s;much as the &s;ame Arguments equally Support the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Claim again&s;t that of the French, as they do that of <HI>New-York.</HI>&mdash;There were &s;everal Rea|&s;ons which induced the Author to make U&s;e of this Ap|pendix.</P>

<P><PB N="186" REF="013102_0183_0F8EBB996D1CD400">
Becau&s;e be is credibly informed that the Gentlemen Land-&s;chemers of New-York have altered their Plan of Operation, and have at an incon&s;iderable Price, pur|cha&s;ed the greate&s;t Part of the <HI>French</HI> Claim to corobor|ate their own &s;ub&s;equent Patents, and by that Means to avail them&s;elves of an antecedent Claim to that of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire;</HI> and that their pre&s;ent Scheme is to be &s;ilent at the Court at <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> with Re&s;pect to their Claim under <HI>New-York,</HI> and carry on the Di&s;pute in the Name of the <HI>French</HI> Barons, hopeing by this Stra|tagem to procure to them&s;elves the Fee of tho&s;e Lands which the <HI>French</HI> Grants cover; and fru&s;trate and Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the Claimants and Settlers under <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> which are &s;eated on the Lands the <HI>French</HI> Grants include, to the Number of about Three Hundred Families, and on which there is not a &s;ingle Settler under either the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>New-York</HI> Claim. And ina&s;much, as the Chain of Arguments predicated on undeniable Facts, and exhibited in the following Appendix, of which this is an Introduction, are abundantly &s;ufficient to invalidate the <HI>French</HI> Claim, the Author therefore takes a peculiar Plea&s;ure in turning the Artillery of the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>New-York</HI> again&s;t them&s;elves, in full Confidence that, that A&s;&s;embly cannot, by Rea&s;on and Argument, gain&s;ay what they have thus exhibited with the Help of any <HI>French</HI> Cunning what&s;oever. And provided the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>New-York</HI> had publi&s;hed the following Appendix, with a friendly De&s;ign towards the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Settlers; that A&s;&s;embly would have merited their grateful Acknowledgements; but though their De&s;ign at that Time was to defeat the <HI>French</HI> Claim to e&s;tabli&s;h their <HI>New-York</HI> Patents, neverthele&s;s it &s;eems a good Pro|vidence hath made U&s;e of the learned Abilities and evil
<PB N="187" REF="013102_0184_0F8EBB9A390A0530">Inten&s;ions of the Gentlemen of that A&s;&s;embly, which tho&s;e Settlers dreaded as their greate&s;t temporary Evil to be conducive to their greate&s;t temporary Good.</P>
<P>Altho' the Arguments contained in the Appendix, to be hereafter in&s;erted, are full and compleat again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> Claim, they are neverehele&s;s &s;omewhat incum|bered with meer imaginary Notions, relative to the pro|digious and antient Northern Extention of the Colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> even to the River <HI>St. Lawrence.</HI> They indeed a&s;certain and vindicate the Right of the Crown of England to tho&s;e Lands, and then on ficticious Princi|ples a&s;&s;ume the Right of that Colony to be co-exten&s;ive with that of the Crown. Now the Reader will with a lit|tle Attention, di&s;cern that Arguments relative to the <HI>French</HI> claim, do not at all depend on the aforemention|ed Extention of the Right of the colony of <HI>New-York,</HI> or of any of his Maje&s;ty's colonies: Meerly the Right of the crown to that Extention of Territory is abundantly &s;uffi|cient to nullify and make void the <HI>French</HI> claim. Un|doubtedly tho&s;e Lands granted by the <HI>French</HI> Govern|ment of <HI>Canada,</HI> adjoining to Lake <HI>Champlain</HI> were crown Lands when u&s;urped and granted by the <HI>French,</HI> and continued &s;o to be till it was granted by his Maje&s;|ty's <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire.</HI> But of this enough has been already animadverted. The Di&s;pute between <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> is committed to the Publick con&s;ideration. What remains in this Intro|duction to the Appendix is only to point out to the Rea|der that &s;uch Part of the Arguments, or rather Repre|&s;entations, therein contained as a&s;&s;ume a colony Right to tho&s;e Lands, are foreign to the Point in I&s;&s;ue, in the Di&s;pute of the French claim; the &s;ame may be &s;aid, pro|vided
<PB N="188" REF="013102_0185_0F8EBB9AEBD71178">the Government of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> a&s;&s;ume a par|ticular colony Right of their's to the &s;ame Premi&s;es. Such Arguments may truly affect the colonies of <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> but by no Means affect the I&s;&s;ue in Di&s;pute relative to the French claim, ina&s;much as the Right of the Crown of England to tho&s;e Lands Precludes the French claim intirely. Therefore &s;uch colony Arguments as may be found inter&s;per&s;ed in the following Appendix are only Digre&s;&s;ions from the Point in I&s;&s;ue, but cannot any Way affect the Arguments which centre in that &s;in|gle Point. Tho&s;e Digre&s;&s;ions are al&s;o virtually an|&s;wered in the foregoing Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>

<P>THE Whole intermediate Coa&s;t between <HI>Mar|tha</HI>'s <HI>Vineyard</HI> and the fir&s;t Settlements in <HI>Virginia,</HI> remained entirely unknown 'till <HI>Hud&s;on's</HI> Di&s;covery in 1609, when it began to be minutely explored, and the Bays, Rivers, I&s;lands, and Creeks, di&s;tingui&s;hed by Name.</P>
<P><HI>Hud&s;on's</HI> River was again vi&s;ited in 1610, and the following Years, by <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, with a Grant under the States General for an exclu&s;ive Trade; and the Coloy which they denominated <HI>Nieuw Nederlant,</HI> advanced with &s;uch Rapidity, that in 1612 they had a Town and Fort in <HI>New-Am&s;ter|dam,</HI> now <HI>New-York;</HI> and in 1615, another Town and Fort at <HI>Aurania,</HI> now <HI>Albany</HI> 160 Miles up <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s River.</P>
<P>IN 1623, they erected Fort <HI>Good Hope,</HI> on <HI>Con|necticut</HI> River, and upwards of Thirty-five Miles from its Mouth.

<P>So long ago as 1696, a Grant pa&s;&s;ed the Great Seal of this Province to <HI>Godfrey Dellius,</HI> for a Tract of Country extending from the North Bounds of <HI>Saraghtoga,</HI> (which lies on <HI>Hud&s;on's</HI> River thirty four Miles North of the City of <HI>Albany</HI>) to the Rock <HI>Ro&s;ian,</HI> a Station indi&s;putable, and which is well known to lie on <HI>Lake Champlain</HI> upwards of twenty Miles to the North of <HI>Crown-Point;</HI> and extending twelve Miles Ea&s;t from <HI>Hud&s;on's</HI> River, and the &s;ame Di&s;tance Ea&s;t from the Wood-Creek, and the Waters to the Northward.

<P>FORMERLY, and before the Year 1731, we had a Trading-Hou&s;e at Crown-Point, where our Traders occa&s;ionally re&s;ided; for it was not 'till that Year that the Canadians, in profound Peace, invaded this frontier Part of the Province, and e|rected Fort <HI>St. Frederick</HI> at Crown-Point, which has been the Occa&s;ion of an almo&s;t uninterrupted Series of Contention and Blood&s;hed.

<P>A COMPLAINT was accordingly tran&s;mitted to Sir <HI>Robert Walpole,</HI> but it made &s;o little Impre&s;&s;ion on that Mini&s;ter, that our Government was left without the lea&s;t Direction from their Superiors; and conceiving an attempt to oppo&s;e or di&s;lodge the <HI>French</HI> (which probably mu&s;t have drawn upon
<PB N="196" REF="013102_0193_0F8EBBA58155DBA0">them the whole Power of Canada) to be too ha|zardous an Undertaking, without the Authority or A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Crown, this important Pa&s;s was left in the Hands of our Enemies.</P>
<P>BUT tho' we were at that Time unable to do our&s;elves Ju&s;tice, it was not only the Opinion of this, but of all the neighbouring Colonies, that the Erection of the Fort at Crown-Point was a dan|gerous Encroachment; and that the common In|tere&s;t demanded that proper Mea&s;ures &s;hou'd be a|dopted to &s;ecure the Colonies again&s;t the Mi&s;chiefs to which it expo&s;ed them.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY in 1755, and before the Declara|tion of War, this Colony, in Conjunction with the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay</HI> and Connecticut, formed a Plan for erecting one or more Forts on his Maje&s;ty's Lands at or nigh Crown-Point, and the Troops were rai&s;ed accordingly,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Journal of the General A&s;&s;embly of <HI>New-York,</HI> 2 Vol. Page 440.</NOTE> but War being &s;oon pro|claimed, our Operations became more exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, on the Principle that it was unque&s;ti|onably a Part of the Briti&s;h Dominions within this Colony, the Government both at home and here, have ever con&s;idered the Occupancy of Crown Point by the <HI>French,</HI> as a per&s;idious and dangerous Encroachment, which in Effect was one of the principal Cau&s;es of both of the la&s;t Wars. The&s;e Remarks ju&s;tify an Inference of the utmo&s;t Mo|ment in the pre&s;ent Controver&s;y, <HI>to wit,</HI> That as it was an ancient Right of this Colony, coeval with
<PB N="197" REF="013102_0194_0F8EBBA80486DFE0">it's fir&s;t Plantation by <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subjects, to extend even further Northward than the Latitude of 45 Degrees, to which it is now re&s;tricted, his Maje&s;|ty's Proclamation, in&s;tead of enlarging our Li|mits, (as has been under&s;tood by &s;ome, who have not con&s;idered the Subject, and pretended by o|thers who&s;e Intere&s;t it is to mi&s;repre&s;ent) does in Fact con&s;iderably abridge it, operating as a Con|firmation of our original Title up to the Line it e&s;tabli&s;hes; and as an Extinction of Juri&s;diction beyond it (<HI>to wit</HI>) over the Lands between that Latitude and the Head of Connecticut River, or more properly the River <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> our old Boundary.</P>
<P>IT is true that &s;ince the Year 1731, the <HI>French</HI> by maintaining Forts and &s;trong Garri&s;ons at Crown-Point, Tieonderoga, &amp;c. have deprived us of the Enjoyment of the Country to the North|ward of <HI>Albany;</HI> nor was it po&s;&s;ible to extend our Plantations, perpetually expo&s;ed to the Ravages of a mo&s;t cruel Enemy, 'till on the Approach of Sir <HI>Jeffery Amher&s;t,</HI> with the Engli&s;h Army in 1759, the <HI>French</HI> abandoned both their Forts and their Settlements.&mdash;The&s;e la&s;t were very few in Number, and all of them in the Neighbourhood of Crown Point and Tieonderoga; which having been in|tended by the <HI>French</HI> as Places of Arms, to annoy and di&s;tre&s;s this Colony the more effectually, no Cultivation had taken place but for the meer Con|veniency of their Garri&s;ons. Sir <HI>Jeffery Amher&s;t</HI> apprehen&s;ive of the bad Con&s;equences of Cana|dian Settlements on the Banks of Lake Champlain,

<P>THE Capitulation granted by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gene|ral to the Inhabitants of Canada, on the Conque&s;t in 1760, &s;tipulates, <Q><HI>That the</HI> French, <HI>in the whole Extent of the colony of</HI> Canada, <HI>&s;hall pre&s;erve the entire Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Property of their Goods, noble and ignoble, moveable and immoveable; and &s;hall have Liberty to keep, let, and &s;ell them, as well to</HI> French <HI>as to the</HI> Engli&s;h.</Q></P>
<P>BY the fir&s;t Article of the definitive Treaty of Peace between <HI>Great-Britain, France,</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> in 1763, <Q><HI>His mo&s;t Chri&s;tion Maje&s;ty cedes and guaran|ties to</HI> Great-Britain, Canada <HI>and all its Dependen|cies.</HI></Q> His Britannick Maje&s;ty, on his Side, agrees, <Q><HI>That the</HI> French <HI>Inhabitants of</HI> Canada <HI>may retire with all Safety and Freedom, where<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters"> they &s;hall think proper, and may &s;ell their E&s;tates, pro|vided it be to the Subjects of his Baitannick Maje&s;ty, &amp;c.

<P>NOTHING &s;eems more obvious than that the Se|curity given to the Canadians, both by the Capi|tulation and the Treaty, was confined to the Li|mits of the Colony of Canada; nor any Thing more ab&s;urd, than to &s;uppo&s;e it &s;hould extend to a Part of the Country which the <HI>French</HI> had per|fidiou&s;ly u&s;urped, and which they had only within the Compa&s;s of a few Years granted to the Cana|dians, to further their Encroachments.</P>

THE Government of <HI>New-York</HI> therefore, inde|pendent of his Maje&s;ty's late E&s;tabli&s;hment of our Boundary with <HI>Quebec,</HI> could not but con&s;ider all the Country on both Sides of Lake Champlain, as un|que&s;tionably within it's ju&s;t and ancient Limits and Juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>THAT the Canadian Grants can never be ju&s;ti|fied by a meer Encroachment, nor derive Stability or Confirmation either from the Capitulation or the Treaty, was not only the Opinion here, but al&s;o of his Maje&s;ty and his Mini&s;ters.</P>

<P>THERE were &s;everal Rea&s;ons which induced them to fix, and the Government to grant, in this Part of the Country.</P>
<P>IT had been the Scene of War, and they were well acquainted with it.

Under the&s;e Circum&s;tances they were chiefly gratified by Grants of the Lands fir&s;t mentioned, and the Country adjoining to the Southward and Ea&s;tward, after being put to great Trouble and Expence in the Di&s;covery and actual Survey of their re&s;pective Allotments. Many Grants have al&s;o been made to the Inhabitants of the Colony in the &s;ame Di&s;trict, which, as far as they concern this Controver&s;y, are laid down in the annexed Map.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Map No. 1</NOTE></P>

<P>THEY all originated at, and &s;ince the Time of the <HI>French</HI> Encroachments at <HI>Crown-Point</HI> in 1731, and &s;everal of them are &s;o late as the Years 1757, and 1758: A Period when we were actually at War with <HI>France,</HI> concerning the&s;e very Lands!</P>
<P>THE Number and Extent of the&s;e Grants, and how de&s;tructive it mu&s;t prove to the Rights of the King's Military Subjects, as well as to others, to give them the lea&s;t Countenance, will be &s;een by a View of the annexed Map and the Notes which accompany it.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Map No. 1.</NOTE></P>

<P>We have anticipated the three fir&s;t of the&s;e A&s;|&s;ertions. 1&s;t. <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> nor any of the Lands Southward of the River <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> were ever a Part of <HI>Canada,</HI> but rightfully belonged to the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as within his Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> and as the Country of the Five Nati|ons his Subjects; nor were they ever in the <HI>peace|able</HI> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>French.</HI> They were invaded in Time of profound Peace, with an armed Power. they were held by the &s;ame unju&s;tifiable Means. They were the Source of perpetual Contention and Blood&s;hed between the Provinces of <HI>Canada</HI> and <HI>New-York.</HI> They were a chief Occa&s;ion of two bloody Wars between the Nations. Can this be called <HI>a Title or a peaceable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion?</HI> 2d. We have &s;hown that neither the Articles of Capitulation, nor the Treaty, can &s;erve the Purpo&s;e of the Claim|ants. The Capitulation can only apply to what the <HI>French</HI> had a Right to, and not to what they had unju&s;tifiably &s;eized; and as to the Clau&s;e of
<PB N="205" REF="013102_0202_0F8EC521976F11B8">the Treaty, it only gives leave to the <HI>French</HI> Sub|jects to &s;ell their E&s;tates in <HI>Canada,</HI> but does not confirm or concern <HI>di&s;putable,</HI> and much le&s;s <HI>tortious and fraudulent Grants,</HI> founded in Breach of Faith; nor can it create a Right which had no prior Ex|i&s;tence. Be&s;ides, this is a Point which the Crown has already &s;olemnly determined, and it is pre&s;um|ed there can be little danger of the Change of a Re&s;olution grounded on the cleare&s;t Dictates of Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice. 3d. As to the third Particu|lar, actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and Improvements by the Canadian Claimants and their Grantors, it is deni|ed that any &s;uch (worthy of Con&s;ideration) have ever been made.</P>
<P><HI>Crown-Point</HI> was a Place of Arms, and &s;o was <HI>Tieonderoga.</HI> The&s;e important Pa&s;&s;es the <HI>French</HI> forfeited to facilitate their Ho&s;tilities again&s;t <HI>New-York,</HI> and not for the Sake of Cultivation; accord|ingly on the Conque&s;t of the Country, few <HI>French</HI> Improvements were found, and tho&s;e within a nar|row Compa&s;s about the Forts, and for the Conve|niency of their Garri&s;ons. With the&s;e incon&s;ider|able Exceptions, the Country was a de&s;olate Wil|derne&s;s all along on both Sides of the Lake. 4th. As to the Payment of the Quint or fifth of the original Purcha&s;e Money of their re&s;pective Seig|niories, and their having been put into full Sei&s;en in the King's Name; the Canadian Claimants have pointed out no In&s;tances. We may however, venture to affirm that this A&s;&s;ertion, if it relates to the Lands on the South Part of <HI>Lake-Champlain,</HI> cannot be &s;upported; nor, with re&s;pect to the re&s;t,
<PB N="206" REF="013102_0203_0F8EC521E2C86B40">is it to be pre&s;umed that a Governor or any Crown Officer of <HI>Quebec,</HI> would interfere with the Lands or Affairs of the Colony of <HI>New-York.</HI> If &s;uch Acts have been performed, in any &s;ingle In&s;tance, we &s;uppo&s;e it concerned Lands near the North End of the Lake, and was only calculated to give &s;ome Colour and Countenance to a Claim &s;o ground|le&s;s: Be it as it may, this Government (which on|ly could rightfully interpo&s;e) has had no Agency in any &s;uch Acts, and they mu&s;t therefore be con&s;i|dered as of no Validity. 5th.

No <HI>French</HI> Claimant has been evicted, nor has a &s;ingle Suit of any kind been pro&s;ecuted again&s;t them. Indeed there could be no Room for it, for as we before ob&s;erved, &s;ince they abandoned their Forts and Settlements, in 1759, there has been no Attempt to re-e&s;tabli&s;h them. Some tran&s;ient People from that Colony, have been employed on the Lakes in the Lumber Trade, (ei|ther with Leave of the <HI>New-York</HI> Proprietors, or as mere Tre&s;pa&s;&s;ers) but we have no Proof of a &s;in|gle Improvement or Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, <HI>&s;ince the War,</HI> under a Canadian Grant.</P>
<P>BESIDES all the&s;e Objections, it is worth a Re|mark, that the Petitioners a&s;k what is improper in it&s;elf, and, as we humbly conceive, out of the Pow|er of the Crown to Grant.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. THEY aim at enjoying their Seigniories ac|cording to their original Tenures, which depend on the Laws and Cu&s;toms of <HI>France.</HI> It is difficult
<PB N="207" REF="013102_0204_0F8EC525F6C18078">to comprehend how the&s;e Tenures can prevail in this Colony, where &s;uch Laws and U&s;ages are un|known, and where all E&s;tates are held under the Crown upon Quit-Rents, in free and Common Socage as the Manor of <HI>Ea&s;t-Greenwich,</HI> in the County of <HI>Kent,</HI> is held in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>IF the Tenure aimed at by the Petitioners, was free from this Objection, it would be a great Sa|crifice of the Rights of the Crown, which derives a very valuable Revenue from the Quit-Rent of 2<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6<ABBR>d.</ABBR> Sterling, upon every Hundred Acres of Land granted in this Colony.</P>
<P>BUT, 2dly. It is pre&s;umed that no <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> Act, or Order of the Crown, can have any legal Influ|ence on the Grants in Que&s;tion. They mu&s;t &s;tand or fall by the Rules of Law.</P>
<P>IF the Limits of the <HI>French</HI> Colony of <HI>Canada,</HI> originally extended as far Southward as is now in|&s;i&s;ted, and if the Articles of the Capitulation and Treaty, operate as a Confirmation of the Canadian Grants, then the&s;e Claimants have a good Title at Law: This Que&s;tion, in a Cour&s;e of Litigation, will come judically before the King in Privy Coun|cil, on an Appeal from the Judgments of the Courts of our Province, if either Party &s;hould be di&s;&s;ati&s;|fied. The Petitioners need not be apprehen&s;ive of Partiality, becau&s;e as a Deci&s;ion here (upon the Point of Title) is not final, no Inju&s;tice can be done but what the Crown will eventually redre&s;s. To take up and determine the Matter extra judically, and without hearing the <HI>New-York</HI> Grantees, would
<PB N="208" REF="013102_0205_0F8EC526DB729898">not only be premature but inconclu&s;ive, for we &s;uppo&s;e <HI>a mere exparte Order of the Crown</HI> cannot de|termine the Title. The Royal Interpo&s;ition wou'd be very con&s;i&s;tent if the Lands had remained un|patented; but here the Crown in every View hath parted with it's Right.&mdash;If the Canadian Principle is ju&s;t, to them, by the Capitulation and Treaty;&mdash;If it is in&s;upportable, then to the <HI>New-York</HI> Grantees under the Great Seal of this Province.</P>
<P>But admitting that the Order of the Crown would be deci&s;ive,&mdash;that this is an extraordinary Ca&s;e, which ought not to move or depend upon the nice Principles of Law,&mdash;and that the Rules of Equity and Policy ought alone to be con&s;ulted. This I&s;&s;ue, we conceive, mu&s;t be equally favour|able to the Military Grantees, under <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. WITH re&s;pect to the Merits of the different Claimants, the <HI>French</HI> Subjects received their Grants from their Prince, for their Services in an unju&s;t Encroachment upon the Briti&s;h Crown; and in Violation of our original Rights, and of the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht.</HI> The Military, who hold under <HI>New-York,</HI> received their Titles by virtue of his Maje&s;ty's Proclamation, and as a Recompence for their Valour, in defence of his ju&s;t and ancient Dominions. To reward the Aggre&s;&s;ors at the Ex|pence of the King's faithful Subjects, &s;eems incon|&s;i&s;tent with every Idea of Ju&s;tice. But it is con|ceived the Honour of the Crown is engaged to &s;upport the Millitary Grants under <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P>FOR, 2dly. It would be&s;peak a Language very
<PB N="209" REF="013102_0206_0F8EC528574CA150">different from the Proclamation, and prove, in&s;tead of a Reward, a &s;evere Puni&s;hment to People who have de&s;erved &s;o much, if his Maje&s;ty, after a Set|tlement of the Limits between the two Colonies,&mdash;after &s;o fully &s;ignifying that it was his Royal Inten|tion to give no Confirmation to the&s;e Canadian Claims,&mdash;after all the Trouble and Expence they have been put to in obtaining their Surveys, and maintaining their Grants, and &s;ettling and culti|vating their Lands,&mdash;&s;hould now by any Order, que&s;tion or impeach their Validity; and which mu&s;t involve them in the utmo&s;t Perplexity and Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. To confirm Claims, derived under the Authority of <HI>France,</HI> to the Southward of the River <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> would hold up to the World a &s;trange Picture of the Ju&s;tice and Equity of the Briti&s;h Court. After engaging in two bloody Wars, and particularly the la&s;t in Re&s;entment of &s;uch flagrant Encroachments, &s;hould it now be admitted that <HI>Canada</HI> extended as it's Advocates al|ledge, what would be the Inference? Mu&s;t it not nece&s;&s;arily follow, that the Occupancy of the Lakes, <HI>Crown Point, Tieonderoga,</HI> &amp;c. was no Inva&s;ion or Act of Ho&s;tility, but the Exertion of a rightful Sovereignty? And con&s;equently, that we were the Aggre&s;&s;ors in tho&s;e Wars, and not the <HI>French;</HI> for nothing le&s;s could be implied in the Confirmations &s;ollicited.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. <HI>Lake Champlain</HI> and <HI>Lake George,</HI> open a mo&s;t important Communication, and may be ju&s;tly called a Key to the Northern Briti&s;h Colonies
<PB N="210" REF="013102_0207_0F8EC528C3AEE2E8">However humbled in the Cour&s;e of a War, which has crowned <HI>Great-Britain</HI> with unexampled Suc|ce&s;s, it is natural to think the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Canada</HI> will long look with an affectionate Eye towards their former Prince. The Canadian Barons in particu|lar, lo&s;e a flattering Weight and Di&s;tinction; while under the Dominion of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> they are &s;unk into mere Commons. Their Language, their Laws, and their Manners, but above all, their Re|ligion, mu&s;t for an Age to come, forbid a cordial Attachment to our Government. They may not be without Hopes that the Fortune of War, be|tween two powerful and rival Nations, may one Day give <HI>France</HI> &s;uch an A&s;cendency as to reduce us to the Nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;toring <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P>FROM this View, it mu&s;t be very impolitic to &s;uffer the <HI>French,</HI> altho' now our Fellow Subjects, to &s;ettle on tho&s;e Lakes, &s;ince it will give them the fulle&s;t Opportunity of a&s;&s;i&s;ting their Countrymen in invading and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing this and the neighbour|ing Colonies, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a Footing, on the fir&s;t Rupture, in the Heart of our Country. On the other Hand, if the fertile Lands &s;urrounding the Lakes, were peopled with the King's natural born Subjects, this Danger, which ought not need|le&s;sly to be de&s;pi&s;ed, would be avoided; it's ill Con&s;equences be prevented, and the Canadians them&s;elves, even if they &s;hould be inclined to re|volt, would be over awed into Subjection.</P>
<P>BUT this is not all.&mdash;If ever <HI>Canada</HI> &s;hould be the Subject of a Ce&s;&s;ion to <HI>France,</HI> what were her ancient Bounds mu&s;t become a nece&s;&s;ary Que&s;tion? Her original Grants to the Canadians, &s;upported
<PB N="211" REF="013102_0208_0F8EC529953A8260">by the Confirmation of the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> wold be con&s;idered as irre&s;i&s;tible Evidence of anci|ent Right; and thus not only <HI>Lake Champlain</HI> but <HI>Lake George,</HI> which are both inter&s;per&s;ed with the&s;e Grants, would fall again into the Hands of <HI>France.</HI> The Po&s;&s;ibility of an Altercation of this Nature, will be wholly removed by con&s;idering the Claims of the Canadians to the Lands on tho&s;e Lakes, as unworthy of Attention.</P>
<P>UPON the Whole, viewing this Subject in every Light, upon the Principles of original Right,&mdash;Treaty and Ce&s;&s;ion,&mdash;Law and Ju&s;tice,&mdash;Equity and Policy, it is conceived that the Military and other Grants under the Seal of this Province, ought not to be impeached; and that the Canadian Claims, extravagant in them&s;elves, and de&s;titute of all Foundation, ought to be rejected.</P>
