<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that in propor|tion to the benefits which an in&s;titution is cal|culated to produce, in that proportion is the exten&s;ion of its duration and its operative in|fluence upon &s;ociety. This remark, which does equal honor to the &s;agacity of the human head and the benevolence of the human heart, is abundantly verified by the experience of ages. In exploring the hi&s;toric page, we find that tho&s;e in&s;titutions, which have been productive of benefit to mankind, have like the pyramids of Egypt braved the ravages of time and weather|ed the convul&s;ions of Empires; while tho&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments, however &s;trongly &s;upported by the &s;ceptre of power or upheld by the hand of &s;uper&s;tition, which have rioted upon the indu&s;try and lived upon the blood of our &s;pecies, have quickly mouldered into du&s;t. The Divine Re|ligion of Je&s;us has nearly &s;een the flight of eighteen centuries, and will la&s;t as long as time it&s;elf; while the four great Monarchies and the mighty empire of Rome which levelled man with the brute and violated all the rights of nature, have long &s;ince felt the tran&s;itory &s;tate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">. The progre&s;&s;ive ameliora+tion
<PB N="6" REF="028427_0005_0FDA79CE5ED3E438">
of the world has often been the theme of philo&s;ophic &s;peculation and the &s;ubject of pro|phetic vi&s;ion; and in truth whether we view man in his pa&s;&s;age from the &s;olitary to the &s;ocial &s;tate, or con&s;ider him in the various modifica|tions of &s;ociety, we will find &s;ufficient rea&s;on to concur in the opinion and to ta&s;te of the di|vine fountain of rapture, which &s;prings from the union of the intellect and the heart in fa|vor of human happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The progre&s;&s;ive improvement of human af|fairs opens a pro&s;pect &s;o grand and &s;o intere&s;t|ing, promi&s;es &s;uch permanence and &s;uch practi|cability, as naturally to induce an enquiry into the mo&s;t efficient mode of maturing it to perfec|tion. As the univer&s;al exten&s;ion of the princi|ple of benevolence pre&s;ents it&s;elf as the only me|thod of accompli&s;hing this great event; and as our fraternity re&s;ts its principal merits upon, and has been uniformly and highly and honorably di&s;tingui&s;hed for, the exerci&s;e of this &s;ublime virtue, you will excu&s;e me if I pre&s;ume to offer a few thoughts upon it; and when de&s;cribing the nature and effects of benevolence, I feel confi|dent of experiencing the benefit of yours, if I &s;hould fail in tho&s;e flights of fancy&mdash;that eleva|tion of &s;tyle and that profundity of remark, which become a man &s;peaking on a &s;ubject that unites in its prai&s;e&mdash;all the modes of imagina|tion, all the faculties of the under&s;tanding, and all the virtues of the heart.</P>
<P>In &s;centific di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, it is con&s;idered &s;atis|factory
<PB N="7" REF="028427_0006_0FDA7992B10D0990">
evidence of the fal&s;ity of a doctrine to demon&s;trate that it leads to an ab&s;urdity; in like manner, in que&s;tions of morals it is an in|&s;uperable objection to a &s;y&s;tem, to prove that it produces mi&s;chief and depravity. The preva|lence of evil has never proceeded from a defect, but from a perver&s;ion of good original princi|ples. The father of the Univer&s;e has endowed us all with competent capacity to cultivate virtue and enjoy felicity: And if we wander into the devious paths of vice and ta&s;te of the bitter cup of mi&s;ery, the fault is to be a&s;cribed to our&s;elves. To e&s;tabli&s;h or refute a propo&s;ition in morals, we may then not only rea&s;on with propriety from the phenomena of the mind, but we may enter into a wider field of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and trace the con&s;equences of a particular doctrine upon all the relations of &s;ociety and the modes of hu|man action.</P>
<P>In contemplating the &s;ubject propo&s;ed, we at the fir&s;t glance behold mankind divided, not on|ly in &s;peculation but in action, into two great parties. The one &s;ide e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence and the other declar|ing that intere&s;t and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s govern the uni|ver&s;e. A well regulated &s;elf-love might un|que&s;tionably an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of creation, and it is certainly not fair promi&s;cuou&s;ly to cla&s;s the advocates of this opinion with tho&s;e who e&s;pou&s;e the &s;y&s;tem of mi&s;anthropy, e&s;pecially as the general complexion of our conduct receives its color and its glow from &s;elf-love: There is &s;omething however extremely plea&s;ing to a no|ble
<PB N="8" REF="028427_0007_0FDA7997E8CBC578">
mind, independent of its benign influence to view man as capable of di&s;intere&s;ted bene|volence: It elevates him in the &s;cale of being and breaks down the partition that &s;eperates him from the order of &s;pirits; It places him on a lofty eminence, from which he can look down without any other &s;igh than the &s;igh of pity, upon the peri&s;hable goods of mortality.</P>
<P>He who &s;uppo&s;es that all our actions are bot|tomed upon intere&s;t or vanity will naturally conduct him&s;elf according to his opinion. If charity proceeds from o&s;tentation, patrioti&s;m from ambition and friend&s;hip from intere&s;t in others&mdash;why &s;hould they not emanate from the &s;ame &s;ources in him&s;elf. He will thus pa&s;s through the world a &s;tranger to all the endear|ing charities of life&mdash;dead to the noble&s;t feel|ings of the &s;oul and deaf to the enchanting voice of virtuous plea&s;ure. The delights of love will be viewed by him as an article of com|merce or an union of convenience&mdash;the ties of friend&s;hip will be rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to views of profit and vanity&mdash;the good of coun|try will be &s;acrificed to the calls of ambition&mdash; philanthrophy will give way to the mo&s;t dete&s;t|able &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s&mdash;the world will receive its hue from his jaundiced eye of &s;u&s;picion&mdash;and like an unfortunate traveller ca&s;t upon a de&s;ert coa&s;t, he will live i&s;olated from the delights of &s;ociety&mdash;u&s;ele&s;s to mankind, u&s;ele&s;s to him|&s;elf. If this doctrine has &s;uch a pernicious practical influence upon individuals, the evil en|crea&s;es with tenfold fury when extended to na|tions.

From what &s;ource but from this, did the di&s;po&s;ition of the Jews to exterminate all the other nations of the earth proceed? The an|tient Romans made u&s;e of the &s;ame word <HI>Ho&s;tis</HI> to &s;ignify both &s;tranger and enemy; and from one extremity of the world to the other their chariot wheels of Empire rolled over the necks of mankind drenched with the blood of millions. The modern &s;y&s;tem of warfare has not &s;o much &s;oftened its a&s;perities and mitigated its ferocities, as the enlightened ideas of humanity &s;o generally diffu&s;ed among nations. We are no longer con&s;i|dered as &s;avage bea&s;ts de&s;tined to tear and de|vour each other, but as children of the &s;ame common father, connected by the ties of the &s;ame common nature: The captured are now pre&s;erved from ma&s;&s;acre and the conquered from extirpation; but alas! humanity is reluct|antly compelled to look upon the pre&s;ent con|vul&s;ions of the world, and to &s;ee with tear-&s;uf|fu&s;ed eyes a departure from her principles&mdash;to recognize with bleeding heart, the &s;pectacle of civilized nations endeavouring with more than diabolical fury to &s;tarve and to exterminate each other.</P>
<P>There is a faculty of the &s;oul which has received various denominations among phi|lo&s;ophers and which &s;eems to be the offspring of the heart and the under&s;tanding united: It has been termed the moral &s;en&s;e, the moral ta&s;te and the moral in&s;tinct, and it con|&s;i&s;ts in an in&s;tantaneous admiration or di&s;gu&s;t of moral beauty or deformity. From this principle
<PB REF="028427_0009_0FDA799FDCEFF968">
of our nature which we recognize in almo&s;t every action of our lives may be deduced various important inferences in favor of di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence and in honor of mankind. The moment we hear of any vicious or cruel action we feel a &s;en&s;e of indignation; and the very in|&s;tant we are informed of a great or noble deed we feel the glow of admiration and &s;atisfaction: When we read of the per&s;ecutions of &s;uper&s;ti|tion, of the ravages of war and of the de&s;olating career of tyranny, what are our feelings but the mingled emotions of indignation and regret? And are we not in&s;tantaneou&s;ly enraptured at the pious endeavors of the religious&mdash;the hono|rable exploits of the patriotic, and the magna|nimous views of the benevolent?</P>
<P>The operation of this principle in a great multitude, in defiance of the pomp of power and the parade of victory, has been admirably de&s;cribed by a celebrated Poet.</P>
<Q><L>EVEN when proud Cae&s;ar 'mid&s;t triumphal cars,</L>
<L>The &s;poils of nations and the pomp of wars,</L>
<L>Ignobly vain and impotently great,</L>
<L>Shew'd Rome her Cato's figure drawn in &s;tate,</L>
<L>As her dead father's reverend image pa&s;t,</L>
<L>The pomp was darken'd and the day o'er ca&s;t,</L>
<L>The triumph ceas'd, tears gu&s;h'd from every eye,</L>
<L>The world's great victor pa&s;s'd unheeded by;</L>
<L>Her la&s;t good man dejected Rome ador'd</L>
<L>And honor'd Cae&s;ar's le&s;s than Cato's &s;word.</L></Q>
<P>The deduction is plain: There mu&s;t exi&s;t in the &s;oul a regard for the welfare of mankind in|dependent of intere&s;ted views. To conceive a
<PB N="11" REF="028427_0010_0FDA79A56467AFD8">
&s;elfi&s;h &s;cheme, we mu&s;t con&s;ider&mdash;we mu&s;t inve&s;|tigate&mdash;we mu&s;t combine ideas&mdash;but the moral &s;en&s;e like a fla&s;h of lightning bur&s;ts in upon us: We either in&s;tantly glow with anger or lo&s;e our&s;elves in admiration: It is an emanation from the divinity&mdash;the Promethean fire brought down from Heaven&mdash;the working of the image of God within us.</P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved in an&s;wer to this, that our indignation ari&s;es from an application of the ca&s;e of the injured to our&s;elves and our admiration from a mercenary view of obtaining favors from the &s;ubject of our panegyrics. I appeal to eve|ry man, who has attended to the train of his thoughts or the proce&s;s of his feelings, whether any per&s;onal reference exi&s;ts, whether the &s;en|timent excited is not intirely ab&s;tracted from &s;elf; but are there not many immoral actions which injure none but the guilty agent him&s;elf? are not many committed in &s;uch a mode and at &s;uch a di&s;tance that by all the rules of pro|bability they can never be extended to us&mdash;and what benefit can we receive from venerating the illu&s;trious &s;hades of the martyrs of liberty or heirs of genius? Has not the cold hand of death placed us beyond their power?</P>
<P>Pure unadulterated nature can alone &s;atis|factory clear up this important que&s;tion&mdash;and to this we mu&s;t re&s;ort as a clue to guide us through a labyrinth of doubts and uncertain|ties. If the fanciful idea of placing a window in every man's bo&s;om could be realized, we
<PB N="12" REF="028427_0011_0FDA79A80F61A710">
could then &s;ee the &s;ecret workings and mo|tives which con&s;pire to produce our actions&mdash; and we could then unque&s;tionably tell whether benevolence exi&s;ts unalloyed by &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s or whether man is really the creature of low and vicious &s;entiments, which bow him down to the earth and render him little &s;uperior to the bea&s;ts of the field: But as this is far beyond our reach, we mu&s;t accommodate our re&s;earches to a dif|ferent mode of enquiry. Let us not then re|&s;ort to the man, hackneyed in the ways of the world, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions have been perverted by the &s;truggles of ambition and the conflicts of intere&s;t&mdash;but let us vi&s;it nature in her un&s;o|phi&s;ticated forms, where the refinements of &s;o|ciety have not corrupted the benevolent bias of the mind and effaced from the heart the impre&s;|&s;ions of Heaven.</P>
<P>It is in the &s;ea&s;on of infancy that we mu&s;t look for genuine nature; then the character fir&s;t opens, and &s;hews it&s;elf; then the power of intere&s;t is feeble and the artifices of ambition obvious. The inhabitant of the woods, who has never mingled in the corruptions of &s;ociety, ex|hibits amid&s;t the awful ferocities of his di&s;po&s;i|tion &s;ome of the genuine characters of man, but in contemplating him we mu&s;t carefully di&s;tingui&s;h between the vices which grow out of the different &s;tages of &s;ociety and the inhe|rent propen&s;ities of the heart. Misfortune al|&s;o &s;erves to reduce us to the level of nature, and to render us acquainted with our&s;elves; it has been well remarked by an acute ob&s;erver that
<PB N="13" REF="028427_0012_0FDA79ACEB3ECD00">
the mo&s;t unfeeling man he ever met with, was one who&s;e whole life was a &s;eries of fortunate events. To the reclu&s;e and the &s;olitary we may al&s;o with propriety look for the le&s;&s;ons of nature; here the colli&s;ion of intercour&s;e has not worn off the feelings and de&s;troyed the emotions of the heart. In the&s;e various conditions and &s;ta|tions, we &s;ee the principle of benevolence &s;trongly operative; we find the mind thus una|dulterated by a commerce with the world, re|plete with the kinde&s;t wi&s;hes and mo&s;t friendly &s;entiments. The fir&s;t emotions of the infant heart beat in uni&s;on with friend&s;hip and bene|volence. The ho&s;pitable &s;avage, to relieve his forlorn gue&s;t, will part with his la&s;t mor&s;el and hazard the horrors of famine. The child of affliction will often forget his own misfortunes in &s;ympathi&s;ing with the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others; and the reclu&s;e, on his fir&s;t appearance in the bu&s;tle of the world, fraught with the mo&s;t bene|volent &s;entiments, will alas, too &s;oon experience that his opinions are too pure for the corrup|tions of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>If the principle of benevolence is &s;o pure &s;o hallowed, how excellent mu&s;t be its practice! The power of di&s;pen&s;ing good approaches the attributes of the deity, and the plea&s;ures re&s;ulting from the relief of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed are &s;o extatic and delightful as to form the mo&s;t &s;triking foreta&s;te of the joys of Heaven.&mdash; The &s;un it&s;elf, with all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">s cheering rays and vivifying influence, is not &s;o glorious a &s;ight as the &s;pectacle of a good man di&s;tributing his
<PB N="14" REF="028427_0013_0FDA79B21B5540E0">
bounty&mdash;and to him we mu&s;t look up as the truly great, for in the calm eye of rea&s;on he &s;tands pre-eminently towering above the vic|torious general or the throned monarch. The &s;tate of office, the pomp of power, the &s;plendor of wealth or a long train of illu&s;trious ance&s;tors may not attend him, but what are the&s;e com|pared to the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;ibility or the &s;miles of Heaven?</P>
<Q><L>IS aught &s;o fair</L>
<L>In all the dewy land&s;capes of the &s;pring</L>
<L>In the bright eye of He&s;per or the morn</L>
<L>In nature's faire&s;t forms, is aught &s;o fair</L>
<L>As virtuous friend&s;hip? as the candid blu&s;h</L>
<L>Of him who &s;trives with fortune to be ju&s;t,</L>
<L>The graceful tear that &s;treams from others woes,</L>
<L>Or the <HI>mild lu&s;tre of benevolence,</HI></L>
<L>Where peace with ever blooming olive crowns</L>
<L>The gate: Where honor's liberal hands effu&s;e</L>
<L>Unenvy'd trea&s;ures and the &s;nowy wings</L>
<L>Of innocence and love protect the &s;cene.</L></Q>
<P>Benevolence &s;eems to inve&s;t a man with ma|gic charms; wherever he goes kind wi&s;hes at|tend him: it forms a good criterion of the whole frame and temper of his &s;oul with which all the other virtues ri&s;e and will almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be connected. "Tell me, &s;ays a feeling writer, of a compa&s;&s;ionate man, you repre&s;ent to me a man of a thou&s;and other good qualities, on whom I can depend, whom I may &s;afely tru&s;t with my wife, my children, my fortune and re|putation!"</P>
<P>The draughts of life, according to the allegory of the Poets, proceed from the ve&s;&s;els of good
<PB N="15" REF="028427_0014_0FDA79B7E6B88578">
and evil that &s;tand on each &s;ide of Jupiter and whenever they are found pure and unmixed, they flow from the ve&s;&s;el on the left hand. Ad|mirable de&s;cription of the mi&s;eries of life! Un|alloyed felicity we never experience, but afflic|tion in all the forms of terror in all the channels of bitterne&s;s, attacks us: It approaches us in the &s;hape of di&s;ea&s;e and poverty, pre&s;ents it&s;elf in the dre&s;s of oppre&s;&s;ion and calumny, a&s;&s;ails us in the lo&s;s of friends and reputation, and me|naces us in all the incalculable forms with which imagination can array the victims of her influ|ence. The pri&s;on, the hou&s;e of madne&s;s, the retreat of poverty, the horrid gibbet, and the blood &s;treaming &s;caffold, bear dreadful te&s;timony to her mighty power. To re&s;train her baneful influence and to draw the draughts of life from the ve&s;&s;el of good on the right hand of Jupiter, are the objects of the benevolent man. In this grand expedition of humanity, the immortal Howard e&s;tabli&s;hed beyond doubt the being and beauty of benevolence; he ro&s;e &s;ublimely from the couch of affluence and ea&s;e&mdash;encountered the in&s;olence of fools and the ridicule of mi&s;anthro|phi&s;ts&mdash;the dungeon's groans and the tyrant's frowns&mdash;braved the horrors of di&s;ea&s;e, the &s;torms of heaven and the tempe&s;ts of the ocean; and wherever he went, chains fell from the hands of &s;lavery and the tears of the pri&s;on were changed into &s;miles&mdash;the ble&s;&s;ings of all good men fol|lowed his foot&s;teps and even de&s;pots, di&s;armed by the &s;ublimity of his virtues, deigned to li&s;ten from their thrones to the tale of &s;orrow and to &s;tretch forth the lenient hand of relief.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="028427_0015_0FDA79811FD55678">In the application of the benevolent princi|ple to the conduct of nations, &s;o many plea&s;ing ideas ru&s;h upon the mind as to hazard the con|ception of vi&s;ionary and chimerical &s;peculations. To pave the way for the introduction of this &s;ublime virtue in the admini&s;tration of the af|fairs of a nation, the will of the community not the will of an individual ought to be the controling power: The &s;entiments of the peo|ple are always right, whereas tho&s;e of an indi|vidual, e&s;pecially in an elevated &s;tation, are too much under the government of &s;ini&s;ter impre&s;|&s;ions.

<P>By this mighty congre&s;s of nations, a free commerce will be univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed; trade will be left open to the channels which nature points out; Duties and premiums and prohibi|tions will be no more; Commerce will &s;eek the regions of indu&s;try and &s;kill, and the wants of mankind will be &s;upplied upon the ba&s;is of their virtues.</P>
<P>An univer&s;ity, for the illumination of the world, will al&s;o be founded; to which as the &s;tore-hou&s;e of knowledge the learned of all na|tions will re&s;ort as formerly they did to antient Egypt.

It will not then be debated whether hills &s;hall be pro&s;trated, but whether the Alps and the Andes &s;hall be levelled? Nor whether &s;terile fields &s;hall be fertili&s;ed, but whe|ther the de&s;erts of Africa &s;hall feel the power of cultivation? Nor whether rivers &s;hall be join|ed, but whether the Ca&s;pian &s;hall &s;ee the Medi|terranean, and the waves of the Pacific lave the Atlantic Shores?</P>
