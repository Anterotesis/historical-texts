<HEAD>THE CANDID RETROSPECT.</HEAD>
<P>THE political creed of America (for I make no e&s;ti|mate of two parties, who taken together are a <HI>Mi|nority</HI> of the continent) may be compri&s;ed in the twelve following articles.</P>
<P N="1">I. Every nation has authority to frame &s;uch a govern|ment for it&s;elf, as will, without injury to others, be mo&s;t conducive to its own felicity.</P>
<P N="2">II. The national &s;overeignty under every form of go|vernment whether in the hands of one, or of many per|&s;ons, or however modelled, is ab&s;olute; for no State can exi&s;t, if any of its members may by force or fraud attempt its &s;ubver&s;ion with impunity: And therefore, every na|tion puni&s;hes trea&s;on, or an attempt tending to overturn the con&s;titution, as the highe&s;t crime of which a &s;ubject can be guilty.</P>
<P N="3">III. No man can be innocent, even <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ro Con&s;cienti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> in an endeavour to change the government of his country, if the meditated revolution will light up a civil war, and the mi&s;eries in pro&s;pect are likely to exceed tho&s;e, which the community have been accu&s;tomed to endure.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The e&s;tabli&s;hments made in America by Engli&s;h emigrants and their a&s;&s;ociates, <HI>might</HI> in the early day of the colonies, if the parent country had been &s;o determined, have been prevented or broken up.</P>
<P N="5">V. The Lords and Commons of England, being con|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ant of the grants and charters of their Kings and Queens, for the encouragement of the colonies, and of the tran&s;actions under them; and afterwards co-operating
<PB N="4" REF="016729_0003_0F9DF04A2E194118">for regulating the plantations, rendering them &s;ecure a|gain&s;t foreign inva&s;ions and u&s;eful to Great-Britain, they cannot therefore be con&s;idered as <HI>merely Royal,</HI> but Parli|amentary, or national e&s;tabli&s;hments.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The grants and charters to the colonies, and the po&s;terior &s;ettlements, regulations and u&s;ages by the per|mi&s;&s;ion, and with the knowledge or privity, and without the interdiction of Parliament, are inconte&s;tible proofs of a great national covenant between the Mother Country and the colonies, for her favours (which undeniably have been many and great) by in&s;piring the Coloni&s;ts with confidence, and expo&s;ing them to hazardous and ex|pen&s;ive undertakings, created rights; and gratitude never obliges to returns and &s;urrenders, incompatible with tho&s;e rights which are e&s;&s;ential to the felicity of the receiver of the benefits.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Before the year 1764, the King, Lords and Com|mons, were univer&s;ally acknowledged to be the &s;upreme law-givers of the whole empire; of which the colonies were members.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The national c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">enant bound the parent country to protect and promote the colonies, according to the good faith implied in the grants and charters, and other royal and national acts in their favour, as far as was con&s;itient with the general weal of all the di&s;per&s;ions of the nation; and it obliged the plantations to &s;ubmit to her authority, in all ca&s;es not repugnant to their grants, charters and e&s;tabli&s;hments; and to &s;uch acts aad contributions, as were nece&s;&s;ary for the <HI>common</HI> defence and felicity of the empire.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Neither of the contracting parties may di&s;&s;olve this compact, as lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> as their joint aim in the union, to wit, <HI>their mutual</HI> pro&s;perity, can be attained by it.</P>
<P N="10">X. As no provi&s;ion was made for con&s;tituting an impar|tial Judge between them, to bridle or correct the partiality or infidelity of either party, therefore their controver&s;ies
<PB N="5" REF="016729_0004_0F9DF04CA5AB0930">are to be decided by negotiation and treaty, or on appeal by battle to the Lord of Ho&s;ts; for neither is obliged to &s;urrender its e&s;&s;ential rights at the <HI>will</HI> of the other, and each is ju&s;tifiable in exerting its own &s;elf-pre&s;erving powers.</P>
<P N="11">XI. When one of them wants either will or ability to fulfil its engagements, the other, if not in&s;trumental to this di&s;affection or impotence, will be di&s;charged from the original obligation. But,</P>
<P N="12">XII. Since among&s;t imperfect beings offences are inevi|table, the contractors are by the laws of a judge who can|not be deceived, reciprocally bound, upon exceptions ta|ken, to pur&s;ue every mea&s;ure of a re-conciliatory nature, con&s;i&s;tent with the end of the union; and to &s;uch mutual conde&s;cen&s;ions, as tend to the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the ge|neral felicity, peace and harmony: And this is the more eminently their duty, &s;ince the empire con&s;i&s;ts of <HI>other</HI> branches, which have offended neither of the parties at &s;trife, and will neverthele&s;s be ruined if the controver&s;y ends in a &s;eparation,</P>
<P>In the application of the&s;e principles to the pre&s;ent quar|rel, perhaps neither Great-Britain nor America will ap|pear to be without blame.</P>
<P>What a new and awful idea of the con&s;titution did the Parent Country hold up to her Colonies, at the pa&s;&s;ing of the &s;tamp act! Her language was this:</P>
<P>"You Americans are ab&s;olutely ours. We may di&s;|po&s;e of your per&s;ons, your commerce, your lands and ac|qui&s;itions as we plea&s;e. You have no rights. The grants of our Kings to your ance&s;tors do not bind this nation. The privileges and &s;ecurities of Engli&s;hmen cannot be yours unle&s;s you return to the old realm. Our ancient indulgences were <HI>temporary</HI> permi&s;&s;ions, from which you can deduce no title to <HI>permanent</HI> enjoyments. Your plea that our Commons are not of your electing, and that we and they are intere&s;ted in the increa&s;e of your burdens,
<PB N="6" REF="016729_0005_0F9DF04D898CFA10">can come with propriety only from the mouth of a Briti&s;h inhabitant &mdash;All America is &s;ubject to our taxations; nor will we hear your complaints, until you fir&s;t own our authority to deal with you as we plea&s;e, and acknowledge that &s;uch benefits as you reque&s;t, are to be expected not as of right, but of grace."</P>
<P>Had England &s;uch principles at the fir&s;t emigrations, &s;he was bound to declare them to the adventurers, before they gave them&s;elves to the winds and the &s;eas, to gain her a &s;hare of the wealth and commerce of the new world, by which her i&s;land has been converted into a <HI>Nation of Princes.</HI></P>
<P>But thus &s;he never did &s;peak till this memorable aera; and therefore the Colonies were in con&s;ternation at the haughty tone, uttering this novel explanation of the nature of the union. They remon&s;trated&mdash;they re&s;i&s;ted &mdash;and the in&s;tant Great-Britain took off the new burden, America re|garded her <HI>deeds</HI> more than her words, &s;ubmitting without cavalling, to that rational &s;overeignty &s;he had formerly ex|erci&s;ed, to the common advantage of the empire.</P>
<P>The grand de&s;ideratum of the moment in which the &s;tamp-act was repealed (1766) was &s;ome plan for obtain|ing in future the rea&s;onable contributions of the Colonies for the <HI>common defence,</HI> con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;upremacy of Parliament and the freedom of America, either in the old or in &s;ome new and unexceptionable mode. If a&s;&s;emblies were <HI>no longer</HI> to be tru&s;ted, for grants on &s;eperate requi&s;i|tions from the Crown (though the Colonies had in this way the credit of having overacted their parts) an Ameri|can Parliament might have been con&s;tituted to <HI>in&s;ure</HI> and <HI>quicken</HI> the &s;upplies; or permanent funds might have been &s;et a part in every plantation for their quotas to the nati|onal charge, ri&s;ing and falling with the commerce of a co|lony, perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>their</HI> &s;afety and the <HI>national &s;upremacy,</HI> and requi&s;ite for the union and direction of their
<PB N="7" REF="016729_0006_0F9DF04DF0947A48">force: But to the a&s;toni&s;hment of common &s;en&s;e, Great-Britain, blind to futurity, and anxious only for pre&s;ent peace, contented her&s;elf with an empty declaration of her authority to bind the colonies <HI>in all ca&s;es what&s;oever;</HI> and as if this would have prevented America from indulging jealou&s;ies, or have induced her to &s;lide into &s;ecurity and confidence, &s;he ab&s;urdly enrolled it among her laws. Ea&s;y them&s;elves, the mini&s;ters of the day, devi&s;ed nothing to counteract the poi&s;on admini&s;tered by their predece&s;&s;ors, and &s;eemed to be regardle&s;s of the durable intere&s;ts of the Monarch they &s;erved, and the nation who re&s;igned to their coun&s;els. But to proceed, we remark,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the pre&s;ent animo&s;ities are imputable to the pride and avarice of Great-Britain, in a&s;&s;uming an au|thority, incon&s;i&s;tent with the compact by which the em|pire had been long pro&s;perou&s;ly united. The colonies had the merit of returning to their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, as &s;oon as they were di&s;burdened of the &s;tamp-duties, the irritating a&s;&s;er|tion of a right to de&s;potic &s;overeignty over them notwith|&s;tanding. They remained quiet till Mr. Town&s;hend re|vived the old claim in a new form, by impo&s;ing duties upon paper, paint, &amp;c. for rai&s;ing a revenue, &s;ubver&s;ive of the Colony Legi&s;latures and the ancient cu&s;toms of he empire.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Colonies were ju&s;tifiable in cen&s;uring the new law devi&s;ed to execute the tea duty act; for that aim|ing to enforce the claim of ab&s;olute &s;overeignty obliged to &s;ome conduct or declaration again&s;t an unconditional &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion&mdash;<HI>Perhaps</HI> it ju&s;tified the open violation to which they re&s;orted.&mdash;Repre&s;entations and petitions having been tried without effect, what could be expected from the mere influence of di&s;&s;ua&s;ions again&s;t the purcha&s;e of the dutied article? Had not the patriot di&s;&s;uader to apprehend pro|&s;ecution and ruin, unle&s;s when impri&s;oned, his country|men would ri&s;e up again&s;t the government for his redemp|tion?
<PB N="8" REF="016729_0007_0F9DF04EB3837448">And which mea&s;ure was lea&s;t exceptionable, the de|&s;truction of the commodity, or the rupture of gaols, for a deliverance of the pri&s;oners in the confederacy, and the &s;udden overturning of the Colony Government for defeat|ing the <HI>regular</HI> cour&s;e of the law?</P>
<P>That the re&s;entment of Great-Britain, on the de&s;truc|tion and expul&s;ion of the tea cargoes, manife&s;ted in the co|ercive mea&s;ures of 1774, by altering the charter of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, extingui&s;hing the commerce of Bo&s;ton, collecting an army there, rendering the &s;oldiery di&s;puni&s;h|able for the &s;hedding of blood, modelling the province of Quebec favourable to the de&s;igns of compul&s;ion and vio|lence, was utterly unju&s;tifiable, and an infraction of the league, which obliged Great-Britain to protect the colo|nies; and the&s;e &s;everities were the more inexcu&s;able, &s;ince to that moment her &s;overeignty in <HI>all ca&s;es</HI> (the matter of taxation excepted) had not been denied by the Colonies; but was by all their courts, and in all their proceedings, confe&s;&s;ed or implied, adjudged, <HI>and</HI> &s;upported.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the provinces were not blameable in forming a Congre&s;s, to unite their coun&s;els and ward off danger, as they did in September 1774.</P>
<P N="5">5. That it was the duty of the American A&s;&s;emblies, and of the Congre&s;s acting for the whole continent, <HI>at that</HI> time to tender a plan to the Mother Country, for re&s;toring peace, con&s;i&s;tent with the compact, by which the Parlia|ment of Great-Britain was to enjoy a &s;upremacy for the common felicity of the empire; and con&s;equently, that the declaration they then made, of the right of the colonies to an <HI>exclu&s;ive legi&s;lation,</HI> not only in ca&s;es of taxation but of <HI>internal polity,</HI> &s;ubject only to the negative of their &s;o|vereign, was a departure in terms from the original league; &s;ince it left no authority to the Parliament of Great-Britain over the Plantations, except for the regulation of the <HI>ex|ternal</HI> commerce of the empire; and gave vigour to the
<PB N="9" REF="016729_0008_0F9DF04F7A323D38">jealou&s;y <HI>before</HI> excited, by the mi&s;repre&s;entations of their enemies, of a de&s;ign to maintain an inau&s;picious union and confederacy with the <HI>Monarchs,</HI> and not with the <HI>Le|gi&s;lature and People</HI> of Great-Britain; and that the intima|tion of the &s;ame Congre&s;s, of the willingne&s;s of the colo|nies, to acquie&s;ce in their condition, <HI>prior to</HI> 1763, gave Great-Britain no &s;ufficient ground to expect their &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion, to the ancient acknowledged claims of her Parlia|ment; &s;ince the repeal of the offen&s;ive &s;tatutes, <HI>without a retraction</HI> of the denial of her legi&s;lative authority, would, by a violent implication, e&s;tabli&s;h the <HI>Congre&s;s's declara|tion,</HI> and amount to a con&s;ent, that America was thence|forth to be the Ally of Great-Britain, and not what the Congre&s;s, at <HI>that very time,</HI> averred her to be, a Member of the Empire. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Extract from that part of the Proceedings of the Continental Congre&s;s, a&s;&s;embled at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, 5th of September, 1774, which was called "The American Bill of Rights."
<P><Q>The inhabitants of the Engli&s;h Colonies in North-America, by the immutable law<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of nature, the principles of the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution, and the &s;everal char|ters or comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s, have the following Rights.</Q></P>
<P>After affirming in the three fir&s;t re&s;olves, That the Americans are entitled to Life, Liberty and Property; that their ance&s;tors had at the time of their emigra|tion, all the rights, liberties and immunities of free and natural born &s;ubjects within the realm; that they were not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> by the emigration, and that their de|&s;cendants have a right to enjoy &s;uch of them, as con&s;i&s;t with their local circum&s;tan|ces, it is</P>
<P><Q>Re&s;olved 4thly, That the foundation of Engli&s;h liberty and of all free govern|ment, is a right in the people to participate in their Legi&s;lative Councils; and as the Engli&s;h Colonies are not repre&s;ented, and from their local and other cir|cum&s;tances, cannot properly be repre&s;ented in the Briti&s;h Parliament, they are entitled to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ree and exclu&s;ive power of legi&s;lation, in their &s;everal Provincial legi&s;latures; where their right of repre&s;entation can alone be pre&s;erved, in all ca&s;es of taxation and INTERNAL POLITY, &s;ubject only to the negative of their Sovereign, in &s;uch manner as has been heretofore u&s;ed and accu&s;tomed. But from the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, and a regard to the mutual intere&s;ts of both coun|tries, we cheerfully CONSENT to the operation of &s;uch acts of the Briti&s;h Parlia|ment, as are 'bona fide' re&s;trained to the regulation of our external commerce, for the purpo&s;es of &s;ecuring the commercial advantages of the whole Empire to the Mother Country, and the commercial benefits of its re&s;pective members; ex|cluding every idea of taxation internal or external, for rai&s;ing a revenue on the &s;ubjects in America without their con&s;ent.</Q></P>
<P>Can it be doubted that the party who introduced this re&s;olve, had any other de|&s;ign than the &s;everance of the Empire? Precluded as Great-Britain was to be in fu|ture, from all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of legi&s;lation, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ting the internal polity of every colony, how then could &s;he check practices injurious to the common weal? &s;he mu&s;t rely, &s;aid the independant, upon the vigilance and fidelity of her Sovereigns: What? let can|dour an&s;wer it, had the people of Great-Britain nothing to fear from their Kings? from Kings at the head of Colonies, that have already (even without the aid of the Crown) braved all the re&s;t of the Empire? nay what &s;ecurity would tho&s;e Monarchs have had for the continuance of their power.</P>
<P>But the Congre&s;s con&s;ented (a term properly u&s;ed after the whole authority of Parliament had been denied) to be &s;ubject to the laws of trade; and with this the hone&s;t and &s;imple hearted Americans were contented, for few of them were aware of the craft which tacked to every &s;uch law, a condition to render it nugatory and void, unle&s;s while it continued the advantages of the commerce to Great-Britain, I &s;hould &s;ay, of the external commerce of the whole Empire, it &s;ecured at the &s;ame time, the commercial benefits of its re&s;pective members. An in&s;idious addition, which brought &s;ome Delegates within doors, and thou&s;ands without, to approve in terms, a &s;entiment which in their hearts they abhorred. Is it in the under&s;tanding of man, to frame an act of trade, that will be proof again&s;t the cavils, to which &s;uch an article gave an handle? And would not the a&s;&s;ent to it as a fundamental of the union, have &s;et every colony upon the high ground of a contracting potentate; au|thori&s;ed to re&s;i&s;t by violence, what &s;he might not be able to prevent by di&s;&s;ua&s;ion? It was only to &s;hew that an act of Parliament was not &s;o beneficial to the Empire, or any part of it, as it might have been, to be void, and as ea&s;y to fore&s;ee that this principle admitted, it was impo&s;&s;ible to pen a law, that would be valid in all or any of the Provinces. In &s;hort, if Great-Britain had run into one extreme for a&s;&s;erting her right to bind the Colonies in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, was it not equally extrava|gant to hold that &s;he could bind us in none? I &s;hall not di&s;parage America, by a&s;&s;ert|ing that there were no per&s;ons here who di&s;cerned and dete&s;ted at the day of the&s;e tran&s;actions, the de&s;ign and tendency of this article of the declaration of rights; t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere were, and with grief we mu&s;t add, that there were members of that very Con|gre&s;s, who, then overreached, have &s;ince died of vexation; as well as others, who to avoid the like imputation, &s;acrifice integrity to pride, and boa&s;t of being from the beginning in that plot, which has co&s;t their coumtrymen an ocean of blood. Thou&s;ands mu&s;t be able to point to the men, once as loud in denying, as they are at pre&s;ent in owning, the intention of &s;evering that Empire from the year 1774. They have my con&s;ent for the fame they a&s;pire after, and that what they wi&s;hed to be be|lieved, may never be que&s;tioned till that happy day, when them&s;elves &s;hall find &s;afety, in producing the proofs they now are de&s;irous to conceal.</P>
<P>Is it asked, what &s;hould have been &s;ub&s;tituted for the re&s;olve we condenm? I an|&s;wer, one &s;afe to America and not injurious to the re&s;t of the Empire. Had the De|legates of that day the general felicity in their eye, might we not have looked for &s;omething like the following declaration as mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afety and &s;en|timents of tho&s;e, with who&s;e lives and fortunes they were intru&s;ted?</P>
<P>The foundation of Engli&s;h liberty and of all free government, is a right in the people to participate in their Legi&s;lative Council. The Coloni&s;ts are not, and from local and other circum&s;tances cannot, be repre&s;ented as the inhabitants of the ancient realm are, in the Briti&s;h Parliament. If only the objects of the bounty and care, and not contributory to the burdens of the parent nation, they could not complain of their not participating in her councils. But the ca&s;e was altered after the Provi|dence of God had enabled them to &s;u&s;tain, and we called them to bear, a part of the general charge for the common defence of the Briti&s;h &s;tock, now di&s;per&s;ed in all quarters of the world. America has no unnatural de&s;ire to &s;hrink from the load, but declares her&s;elf willing to &s;ubmit to an equitable ratio. She expects it from the wi&s;|dom and ju&s;tice of the Parent State to &s;et limits to her power, that Great-Britain will ab&s;tain from all mea&s;ures directly and indirectly tending to levy taxes, and from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ements and innovations for humbling the Colonies into a ba&s;e devotion to her arbitrary plea&s;ure. She has drawn aids from them by her commercial regulations. Let a council be convoked to deliberate upon a &s;ettlement, to a&s;certain what con|tributions the Provinces &s;hall afford in future, for the protection &s;he ought not to refu&s;e.</P>
<P>Such language as this could only have offended tho&s;e, who meant to &s;ubject us to de&s;poti&s;m: And it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to the honour of Great-Britain, that &s;he threw out the fir&s;t hint for an accommodation of differences by compact, in the re&s;olve of the 20th of February, 1775. It is at the &s;ame time the misfortune of the Colonies, that their leaders preferred a defiance of her power to the tenders of her love. Look at the &s;ullen an&s;wer to the conciliatory declaration, entered in the Congre&s;s minutes of the 31&s;t of July, 1775, an an&s;wer too, unfairly &s;u&s;pended from the pre|ceding April, that the multitude might in the interval, be the better prepared to approve its in&s;idious contents. What incredible pains were taken to practi&s;e upon the Provincial Congre&s;&s;es, and inculcate the ludicrous idea uttered in Parliament, that liberty was &s;et up at auction, to be &s;old to the Provinces bidding highe&s;t? And how grateful the poi&s;on of that parricide, to an inflamed populace, gulled into a de&s;tructive war, by the hope of paying nothing towards the charge for &s;upporting and defending the liberties they enjoyed! Mi&s;erable Americans! &s;ay now who are your foes!</P></NOTE></P>

<P>How few not in Congre&s;s were at that time, or have &s;ince been informed of what all &s;hould have known, and upon which the collective body ought to have been con|&s;ulted, viz.</P>
<P>That Lord Drummond left England in September, 1775, three months before the pa&s;&s;ing of the prohibitory act, and after touching at Halit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Bo&s;ton, arrived at New-York, and with Mr. Elliot, made a journey to the Congre&s;s at Philadelphia, in January 1776.</P>
<P>That it was then confidentially &s;ignified to certain of the Delegates attending there, that the Mini&s;ter of the Court of Great-Britain was de&s;irous of a treaty for a pacification of differences, upon the following equitable propo&s;itions.</P>
<P N="1">1. To a&s;&s;ertain the proportion each Colony was able to contribute towards the common defence.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the &s;upply &s;hould be rai&s;ed by acts of A&s;&s;embly, in duties upon imports or exports, mo&s;t likely to keep pace with the growth or decline of the Colony.</P>
<P N="3">3. That other duties for regulating trade, &s;hould be paid into the Colony trea|&s;ury, and be &s;ubject to the di&s;po&s;al of the A&s;&s;embly, and.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, Great-Britain to renounce the claim of taxation, and depend for aids in all exigencies, upon the free gift of the Colonies.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o intimated that the&s;e points agreed, the repeal of the &s;tatutes offen&s;ive to America would follow; and &s;uch a limitation propo&s;ed for the quartering of troops, and the partition of them through the provinces, as to induce one of the then Delegates, to declare that he &s;hould con&s;ider them as ho&s;tages for the good behaviour of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>It was at the &s;ame interview candidly hinted, that the mother country would arm at all points in the &s;pring, and precede her operations by overtures for a treaty; and as a means to prevent even the arrival of the intended armaments, Lord Drummond urged, that Congre&s;s &s;hould declare them&s;elves on the&s;e propo&s;als, by &s;pecial me&s;&s;engers of their own to go home immediately.</P>
<P>How this pacifick me&s;&s;age was received, the people of any Colony may know, if they have &s;pirit and power left under their pre&s;ent tyrants, to call the Delegates of that day to an examination upon oath. It is a&s;&s;erted that a motion was made in Congre&s;s, to commit their Me&s;&s;engers to clo&s;e cu&s;tody; and certainly true, that they were not di&s;mi&s;&s;ed till their paroles were exacted; and that much pains were taken to hide the&s;e momentous tran&s;actions from the publick eye. If the enquiry (which it imports every province to make into the conduct and fidelity of her agents) is not slovenly conducted, it will come out, that two of the Delegates &s;ought a con|veyance from New-York to England upon this bu&s;ine&s;s in February 1776, and that the de&s;ign was relinqui&s;hed, as &s;oon as the news of an event in Virginia gave the party for the intended independency, advantages for &s;ubduing the common reluc|tance of a great majority of the Continent, to advance to that dangerous precipice, from which they have launched &s;o many of their credulous countrymen into the ocean of eternity; while &s;cores of thou&s;ands remain behind them, in all the com|plicated wretchedne&s;s of want and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Such, America, was the patrioti&s;m of your leaders! Do you wonder that they who cheated you into ruin, have ever &s;ince practised the arts of delu&s;ion, to &s;creen them&s;elves from a detection, that mu&s;t expo&s;e them to your vengeance?</P></NOTE></P>

<P>I have the honour to inclo&s;e you for the peru&s;al and con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s, &s;undry papers, the whole of which, except No. 2 and 7, I received ye&s;terday even|ing by a flag, and to which I beg leave to refer Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Report of the Committee (Mr. Franklin, Mr. John Admas, and Mr. E. Rutledge) appointed on wait on Lord Howe.</P>
<P>In obedience to the orders of Congre&s;s, we have had a meeting with Lord Howe. It was on Wedne&s;day la&s;t upon State<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">-I&s;land, oppo&s;ite to Amboy, where his Lord|&s;hip received and entertained us with the utmo&s;t politene&s;s.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip opened the conver&s;ation, by acquainting us that though he could not treat with us as a Committee of Congre&s;s, yet as his powers enabled him to confer and con&s;ult with any private gentlemen of influence in the Colonies, on the means of re&s;toring peace between the two countries, he was glad of this opportu|nity of con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erring with us on that &s;ubject, if we thought our&s;elves at liberty to enter into a conference with him in that character. We ob&s;erved to his Lord&s;hip, that as our bu&s;ine&s;s was to hear, he might con&s;ider us in what light he plea&s;ed, and communicate to us any propo&s;itions he might be authorized to make for the purpo&s;e mentioned; but that we could con&s;ider our&s;elves in no other character, than that in which we were placed by the order of Congre&s;s. His Lord&s;hip then entered into a di&s;cour&s;e of con&s;iderable length, which contained no explicit propo|&s;ition of peace, except one, viz. that the Colonies &s;hould return to their allegiance and obedience to the Government of Great-Britain.&mdash;The re&s;t con&s;i&s;ted principally of a&s;&s;urances, that there was an exceeding good di&s;po&s;ition in the King and Mini&s;ters to make that government ea&s;y to us; with intimations, that in ca&s;e of our &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion, they would cau&s;e the offen&s;ive acts of Parliament to be revived, and the in|&s;tructions to Governours to be re-con&s;idered; that &s;o, if any ju&s;t cau&s;es of com|plaint were found in the acts, or any errors in Government were perceived to have crept into the in&s;tructions, they might be amended or withdrawn.</P>
<P>We gave it as our opinion to his Lord&s;hip, that a return to the domination of Great-Britain was not to be expected; we mentioned the repeated humble petitions of the Colonies to the King and Parliament, which had been treated with contempt, and an&s;wered only by additional injuries; the unexam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed patience we had &s;hewn under their tyrannical government and that it was not until the la&s;t act of Parlia|ment, which denounced war again&s;t us, and put us out of the King's protection, that we declared our independence. That this declaration had been called for by the people of the Colonies in general&mdash;that every Colony had approved of it when made, and all now con&s;idered them&s;elves as independent States, and were &s;ettling or had &s;ettled their governments accordingly; &s;o that it was not in the power of Congre&s;s to agree for them, that they &s;hould return to their former dependent &s;tate. That there was no doubt of their inclination to peace, and their willingne&s;s to enter into a treaty with Britain, that might be advantageous to both countries&mdash;that though his Lord&s;hip has at pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent no power to treat with them as Independent States, he might it there was the &s;ame good di&s;po&s;ition in Britain, much &s;ooner obtain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> powers from thence for that purpo&s;e, than powers could be obtained by Congre&s;s from the several Colonies to con&s;ent to a &s;ubm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The intelligent American wants no aid to convict this report of the want of truth and good faith. Some of them were &s;o far from the calling for Independence, as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> all authority to declare it, to this hour. And when uttered it &s;hocked, and from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> divided the Continent, and drove its advocates to violences and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> demon&s;trate the general di&s;content<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE> His Lord&s;hip then &s;aying, that he was &s;orry to find that no accommodation was like to take place, put an end to the conference.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it did not appear to your Committee, that his Lord&s;hip's com|mi&s;&s;ion contained any other authority of importance, than what is expre&s;&s;ed in the act of Parliament, viz. that of granting pardons, with &s;uch exceptions as the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall think proper to make, and of declaring America, or any part of it, to be in the King's peace upon &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: For as to the power of enquiring into the &s;tate of America, which his Lord&s;hip mentioned to us, and of conferring and con&s;ulting with any per&s;ons the Commi&s;&s;ioners might think proper, and repre&s;ent|ing the re&s;ult of &s;uch conver&s;ations to the Mini&s;try, who (provided the Colonies would &s;ubject them&s;elves) might after all, or might not at their plea&s;ure, make any alterations in the former in&s;tructions to Governours, or propo&s;e in Parliament any amendment of the acts complained of; we apprehend any expectation from the effect of &s;uch a power, would have been too uncertain and precarious to be relied on by America, had &s;he &s;till continued in her &s;tate of dependence.</P>

<HEAD>Copy of Lord Howe's letter to Lord George Germaine, dated Eagle off New-York, 20th September 1776, communicated to the Hou&s;e of Lords, and taken from the Parliamentary Regi&s;ter for 1778.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FINDING in a conver&s;ation with Mr. Sullivan, a Major General in the rebel army, taken pri&s;oner in the action of the 27th of Augu&s;t, that the leaders of the di&s;affected Americans, profe&s;&s;ed to under&s;tand the powers delegated by the King's commi&s;&s;ion, were re&s;tricted to grating pardons and declaring the Colonies at peace, without authority to enter into any di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of grievances, I thought proper to inform that gentleman, that the object of his Maje&s;ty's paternal de&s;ire was to make his American &s;ubjects happy, as well as to relieve them from the calamities of war&mdash;That the Commi&s;&s;ioners were willing to con&s;ult and confer with any per&s;ons of in|fluence, upon the means of attaining the&s;e ends; and that reconciliation, union and redre&s;s of grievances, might be the happy con&s;equence. Mr. Suilivan hereupon propo&s;ed, and with General Howe's approbation, I con&s;ented, that he &s;hould go to Philadelphia, and undeceive tho&s;e who appeared to entertain that confined opinion of the King's mo&s;t gracious intentions.</P>
<P>On the 9th in&s;tant he returned, and acquainted me, that he had made known the &s;entiments I had expre&s;&s;ed to him; and that according to the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">r of a re&s;olution of Congre&s;s, three Deputies might &s;oon be expected in this province, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> more particularly into the grounds of the information he had communicated.</P>
<P>I have the honour to &s;end inclo&s;ed to your Lord&s;hip a copy of that re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Although the object of this deputation apparently was to interrogate rather than to confer, General Howe concurred in opinion with me, that I &s;hould not, on that account, decline any propo&s;ition for a meeting.&mdash;We thought it material to contro|vert the real or affected ideas before mentioned, which had probably been circulated with a view of per&s;uade the ignorant, that the offer of peace and pardon held <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in our Declaration of the 14th of July, was merely an artifice to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them, and that their liberties and properties were only to be &s;ecured by a per&s;everance in their re&s;olution, to throw off all dependence upon the King and Parliament of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>In the evening of the &s;ame day I received information that Doctor Franklin, Mr. John Adams, and Mr. Rutledge, would meet me, at any appointed place, on the morning on the 11th. General Howe's pre&s;ence being that day nece&s;&s;ary with the army, he could not accompany me to the meeting which I appointed &s;hould be on State<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">-I&s;land, oppo&s;ite to the town of Amboy.</P>
<P>I acquainted them, that King's de&s;ire to re&s;tore publick tranquility, had in|duced him to con&s;titute Commi&s;&s;ioners open the &s;pot, to remove the re&s;trictions upon trade and intercour&s;e, to di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the Royal cleamency to tho&s;e who had been hurried away from their allegiance, to receive repre&s;entations of grievances, and to di&s;cu&s;s the means whereby that mutual confidence and ju&s;t re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lution which ought to ful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ful between the Coloni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and the Parent State, might be re&s;tored and pre&s;erved I al&s;o gave them to under&s;tand, that his Maje&s;ty was graciou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed to a revi&s;ion of &s;uch of his royal in&s;tructions as might have laid too much re&s;traint upon their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|gimation, and to concur in a revi&s;al of any of the plantation laws, by which the Co|lonies might be aggrieved&mdash;That the Commi&s;&s;ioners are earne&s;t, on their part, to prevent the further effu&s;ion of blood, and to proceed upon all &s;uch mea&s;ures as might expedite the accompli&s;hment of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of their commi&s;&s;ion&mdash;That they were willing to confer with any of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, and to treat with Delegates of the Colonies, legally cho&s;en, upon all matters relating to grievance and regula|tions; but that, for very obvious rea&s;ons, we could not enter into any treaty wi&s;h their Congre&s;s; and much le&s;s proceed in any conference of negociation upon the inadmi&s;&s;ible ground of Independency&mdash;I preten&s;ion which the Commi&s;&s;ioners had not, nor was it po&s;&s;ible they ever &s;hould have, authority to acknowledge.</P>
<P>The three gentlemen were very explicit in their opinions, that the a&s;&s;ociated Co|lonies would not accede to any peace or alliance, but as free and independent States; and they endeavoured to prove, that Great-Britain would derive more exten&s;ive and more durable advantages from &s;uch an alliance, than from the connection it was the object of the Commi&s;&s;ion to re&s;tore.&mdash;Their comments not meri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing a &s;erious atten|tion, the conver&s;ation ended, and the gentleman returned to Amboy.</P>
