<P>BEFORE I proceed, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give you the clue which led to this bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Simon Wingate one of the deacons of the Church in Biddeford, a rigid Trinitarian, and a man of a vio|lent temper, had for many years been endeavoring to for up a church quarrel with Mr. Hill, on account of his catholic ideas, which he in conver&s;ation held up to view, when religion was the topic, influenced the Rev. Mr. Web&s;ter pa&s;tor of &s;aid church, to in|vite him and Mr. Hill to meet at his hou&s;e, and at the &s;ame time to invite a number of the church to be pre&s;ent. (Mr. Hill had, for a number of years, carefully avoided any conver&s;ation with Deacon Wingate re&s;pecting religion, on account of his ri|gid principles, and violent temper.)</P>
<P>Accordingly they met at the Pa&s;tor's on Friday, the 14th. day of September, 1792, and four other members of &s;aid Church. After a little conver&s;a|tion, Deacon Wingate propo&s;ed to Mr. Hill the following Que&s;tion:&mdash;</P>
<P>"Of whom was Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Son?"</P>
<P>To which Mr. Hill an&s;wered, "I am not fully &s;a|tisfied in my own mind."&mdash;"Whom do you think he was the &s;on of?" An&s;wer: "I am inclined to think that he was the &s;on of Jo&s;eph." After a con|&s;iderable conver&s;ation re&s;pecting various texts of Scripture which &s;peak of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Deacon Wingate finding tho&s;e pre&s;ent wi&s;hed to drop the matter expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf after this manner, "If you are all &s;atisfied, I &s;hall endeavour to make my&s;elf contented"&mdash;and each one returned to his re&s;pective home. The next &s;abbath, Deacon Wingate did not attend meeting, and it was currently reported that he exclaimed bitterly again&s;t the Pa&s;tor and Church, calling them as much heretics as Mr. Hill, and that he was con&s;cience-&s;mitten, and could not, or would not wor&s;hip with them, &amp;c.</P>

Mr. Hill, under&s;tanding that James Emery, ano|ther Deacon of &s;aid Church, was a good deal affect|ed with the clamour Deacon Wingate had made re&s;pecting this conference, his tenets, &amp;c. wrote Deacon Emery a letter on the &s;ubject, expre&s;&s;ing his concern for the difficulties and animo&s;ities that agi|tated the Church; that as rational creatures we ought to <HI>rea&s;on</HI> on religious &s;ubjects, as we did on other matters; that <HI>rea&s;on</HI> was a di&s;tingui&s;hing ta|lent which God had given men above the brutes, and adduced a number of texts of Scripture to &s;hew the propriety of such an inve&s;tigation of religious &s;ub|jects; that the Apo&s;tles always exerci&s;ed this noble talent in introducing the Go&s;pel into the world; that we ought to u&s;e candour towards one another who made different con&s;tructions of the &s;ame text or that the Prote&s;tants doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation becau&s;e it was <HI>unrea&s;onable,</HI> not|with&s;tanding the Scriptures plainly &s;aid "this is my body&mdash;this is my blood"; that it was as unrea&s;onable to believe that <HI>three</HI> were but <HI>one,</HI> and that <HI>one</HI> was <HI>three,</HI> as to believe that bread was fle&s;h, or that wine was blood; that one great object of Chri&s;t's mi&s;&s;ion into the world was to enforce the doctrine of the re|&s;urrection to an immortal life, and to give an exam|ple as a full proof of the doctrine; that it Je&s;us Chri&s;t was in the order of beings &s;uperior to man, <HI>his</HI> re&s;urrection would not prove <HI>man's</HI> re&s;urrection any more than <HI>man's</HI> re&s;urrection would prove the re&s;urrection of a <HI>brute;</HI> and that concerning the divine conception (&s;o called) he argued that Mary was e&s;|pou&s;ed, that is, <HI>married</HI> to Jo&s;eph; that Jo&s;eph wascal|led her hu&s;band, and Mary wascalled by the angel his wife; that if the had not been his wife; he could not po&s;&s;ibly have meditated the putting her away; that being conceived by the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;ignified that
<PB N="4" REF="025603_0004_0FCDEF626E4F3598">
the child which &s;he had conceived, would be highly favored of God, would have much of the Divine influence, would be the Me&s;&s;iah, the &s;ame which the prophets had foretold was to come, would &s;ave the people from their &s;ins, would bring life and immor|tality to light; that Jo&s;eph, in order to prove the event of his wonderful dream, declined to have any conver&s;ation with her as his wife from the time of the dream, till &s;he was delivered: that Luke and other di&s;ciples and Apo&s;tles &s;uppo&s;ed him to be the &s;on of Jo&s;eph as well as the &s;cribes and phari&s;ees, who were the teachers of the people in that day, and doubtle&s;s were men of information; that he did not &s;ee why we in this day might not &s;uppo&s;e &s;o too; that his being called the Son of God did not prove any <HI>trinity,</HI> any more than Adam's being called the &s;on of God;&mdash;for all good men were called the &s;ons of God; that if we quit rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, we, by enthu&s;ia&s;m, bigotry and &s;uper&s;tition, might make <HI>nothing</HI> mean <HI>any, thing.</HI></P>
<P>Deacon Emery received this letter kindly; &s;aw Mr. Hill a few days after, and with more than com|mon cordiality took him by the hand, thanked him for the letter he had &s;ent him, &s;aying it had given him a good deal of &s;atisfaction; that his creed was not &s;o bad as he had heard, &amp;c. Deacon Wingate borrowed this letter and &s;hewed it to the Rev. Mr. Lanca&s;ter, of Scarborough, who, filled with enthu|&s;ia&s;tic zeal, pa&s;&s;ed his &s;olemn &s;entence of condemna|tion upon it, calling it here&s;y, bla&s;phemy, damnable doctrine, &amp;c. This awful &s;entence being commu|nicated by Deacon Wingate to Deacon Emery; he was much agitated, and by deacon Wingate's influ|ence, was induced with one other member of &s;aid church, to apply to the Pa&s;tor, reque&s;ting a church meeting, which was appointed to be held at the pa&s;|tor's,
<PB N="5" REF="025603_0005_0FCDEF63EE350290">
January 17, 1793&mdash;At which meeting Deacon Wingate appeared, and entered his complaint again&s;t Mr. Hill, charging him with giving it as his opin|ion, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Me&s;&s;iah was not begotten by the miraculous power of the Holy Gho&s;t, and that he was the real &s;on of Jo&s;eph and Mary. Mr. Hill then de&s;ired the meeting might be adjourned, that he might have time to prepare him&s;elf for his defence, and that the meeting at the adjournment might be held at the meeting-hou&s;e, and public no|tice given. Accordingly the meeting was adjourn|ed to the fir&s;t Thur&s;day in May, then next follow|ing, to meet at the meeting-hou&s;e at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t Wedne&s;day in May the A&s;&s;ociation met at Mr. Web&s;ter's pari&s;h, and after lecture, the Church &s;topped, and agreed to a&s;k coun&s;el in this matter, of the A&s;&s;ociation. Accordingly the Church were all invited to meet the A&s;&s;ociation that after|noon at Mr. Web&s;ter's, which they did, and after a good deal of conver&s;ation, in which Mr. Hill freely and fully gave his opinion re&s;pecting the &s;ubject mat|ter of di&s;pute, and his rea&s;ons for forming &s;uch an opinion, fixing the whole on his Bible. The Church retired for &s;ome time, that the A&s;&s;ociation might con&s;ult among them&s;elves. After &s;ome time the Church were again invited in, and the A&s;&s;ocia|tion delivered the re&s;ult of their con&s;ultation, de|claring that the tenet Mr. Hill embraced, was in their judgment erroneous, and that it ought to be te&s;tified and guarded again&s;t. The Church as well as Mr. Hill, were not &s;atisfied with this re&s;ult, be|cau&s;e they had left the matter as loo&s;e as they found it, and the Church as much in the dark as ever. It mu&s;t be remembered, that during all this time, Dea|con Wingate withdrew him&s;elf from the &s;ocial wor|&s;hip
<PB N="6" REF="025603_0006_0FCDEF656CA74E10">
and communion of the Church; that Mr. Hill had had two conferences with him before &s;everal witne&s;&s;es, and expo&s;tulated with him on the unrea|&s;onablene&s;s of his conduct; that ob&s;erving different creeds could not hurt their re&s;pective believers; that we are in a land of light and knowledge; that ac|tions &s;poke louder than words; that Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles condemned mal conduct only; and that what we call <HI>creeds</HI> were not introduced into the Church till a long time after the Chri&s;tian Era.</P>
<P>After Mr. Hill found that expo&s;tulations had no effect, he exhibited to the Pa&s;tor a complaint again&s;t Deacon Wingate, charging him with ab&s;enting him&s;elf from the &s;ocial wor&s;hip and communion of the Church for &s;ix months then la&s;t pa&s;t; for his unchri&s;tian conduct towards tho&s;e who did not con|&s;true the &s;acred Scriptures agreeable to his notion.&mdash;For being a railer, a tatler, and a bu&s;ybody in other men's matters, contrary to the precepts and exam|ples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; for combining with others to defraud one David Hutchins in the &s;ale of &s;ome iron|ore mines; for unchri&s;tian conduct towards him in calling him to a conference before witne&s;&s;es, in&s;i&s;t|ing on his an&s;wering &s;ome que&s;tions concerning Je|&s;us Chri&s;t the Me&s;&s;ias, and then making his an&s;wers the foundation of an accu&s;ation before the Church; and for per&s;ecuting him for a private pique under the cloak of religion. Mr. Hill always &s;uppo&s;ed that Deacon Wingate carried on this matter out of revenge, becau&s;e he enli&s;ted his apprentice during the late war, contrary to his will, though his per&s;on+nal intere&s;t did not &s;uffer by it, for the apprentice gave him one hundred dollars of his bounty.&mdash;On this account the Deacon often quarreled with Mr. Hill, and finding he could not get any advantage by quarreling in that way, he commenced the combat

<PB N="7" REF="025603_0007_0FCDEF670EB29A90">
under the cloak of religion. Be&s;ides, Deacon Win|gate was jealous that Mr. Hill a&s;&s;i&s;ted Mr. Hutch|ins in his law-&s;uit again&s;t him concerning the iron|ore mines; for Mr. Hill, as a Ju&s;tice of the Peace, took a number of depo&s;itions to be u&s;ed in that ac|tion on both &s;ides, and when Deacon Wingate came to him for his advice, re&s;pecting the matter, he can|didly gave him his opinion, and the rea&s;ons why he formed &s;uch an opinion, which offended the Deacon, though the judgment of the court of reference prov|ed to be the &s;ame. But to return,</P>
<P>The Church being met at the meeting-hou&s;e ac|cording to adjournment, and the Rev. Doctor Hem|menway being pre&s;ent, the Church reque&s;ted him to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the bu&s;ine&s;s before them as a conciliator. The Doctor read a paper, which he &s;aid was agreeable to the minds of the A&s;&s;ociation, giving it as their opinion, that Mr. Hill's tenet was fal&s;e, un&s;ound, &amp;c. and that the Church ought to bear their te&s;ti|mony again&s;t it; that they ought to deal tenderly with a brother who was in an error not voluntarily; that they ought to advi&s;e him to &s;tudy the Scriptures more carefully, and to be careful in not advancing &s;uch doctrines, they being again&s;t the common te|nets of the Churches in general, and this Church in particular.</P>
<P>Mr. Hill then de&s;ired liberty to an&s;wer for him|&s;elf, and give the rea&s;ons publicly, why he formed &s;uch an opinion, a con&s;iderable number of per&s;ons being collected to hear the debates, &amp;c. Mr. Hill then ro&s;e and delivered the following Addre&s;s:</P>
<P>Friends, Brethren &amp; Fellow-Citizens,</P>
<P>I think my&s;elf happy that I am permitted this day to an&s;wer for my&s;elf before this a&s;&s;embly, touch|ing the things whereof I am accu&s;ed, becau&s;e I
<PB N="8" REF="025603_0008_0FCDEF6AF1FEC078">
know that this is an age of free inquiry; and I de|&s;ire to thank my God, that by the con&s;titution of this Commonwealth, "No &s;ubject &s;hall be hurt, mole&s;ted, or re&s;trained, in his per&s;on, liberty, or e&s;|tate, for wer&s;hipping God in the manner and &s;ea|&s;on mo&s;t agreeable to the dictates of his own con&s;ci|ence; or for his religious profe&s;&s;ion or &s;entiments; provided he doth not di&s;turb the public peace, or ob|&s;truct others in their religious wor&s;hip": therefore I be&s;eech you to hear me patiently.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not pretend to deny the accu&s;ation, which is, 'for giving it as my opinion, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Me&s;&s;iah was not begotten by the miraculous power of the Holy Gho&s;t; and that he was the real &s;on of Jo&s;eph and Mary:" but &s;hall endeavor to give you the rea&s;ons why I have formed &s;uch an opinion. In doing this I shall quote no authors but the holy men of God, who wrote as they were moved by the Ho|ly Gho&s;t; neither &s;hall I give their writings any private interpretation, but &s;hall con&s;true every text rationally, according to the gift of God that is in me. But before I proceed, I &s;hall offer for your candid con&s;ideration three propo&s;itions, in which think you will agree with me.</P>
<P>1. That the Scriptures are true.</P>
<P>2d., That Scripture is the be&s;t interpreter of Scripture.</P>
<P>3d. That God has made us rational creatures and thereby di&s;tingui&s;hed us from the brutal crea|tion; therefore he requires us to act and think of him, his ways, his word, and his works, according to tho&s;e rational powers and faculties,-which if we neglect, we, like the &s;lothful &s;ervant mu&s;t be &s;aid to have hid this di&s;tingui&s;hed talent in the earth, and em|phatically to call God Almighty a hard ma&s;ter. Were either of you to endeavor to per&s;uade a Mehometan
<PB N="9" REF="025603_0009_0FCDEF6CDEFE24A0">
to embrace the Chri&s;tian religion, would you not bid him u&s;e <HI>rea&s;on?</HI> and argue the <HI>rea&s;onablene&s;s</HI> of the &s;y&s;tem as a proof of its validity? "Come now, let us <HI>rea&s;on</HI> together, faith the Lord, though your &s;ins be as scarlet, they &s;hall be white as &s;now; though they be red like crim&s;on, they &s;hall be as wool." I&s;ai. i. 18.&mdash;Which is as if he had &s;aid, tho' your &s;ins be ever &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, though they be of the deepe&s;t dye, yet if you will but <HI>rea&s;on</HI> with me on my ways, my word and my works, you will &s;oon be convinced that I am your Almighty father, who gives you every good and perfect gift, and then you will be a&s;hamed of your ba&s;e conduct and ingrati|tude towards me, and return and repent of all your tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and put away the evil of your doings from before my face, and I-do-then a&s;&s;ure you that I will pardon all your iniquities; and your &s;ins &s;hall be remembered no more. Seeing God thus conde&s;|cends to <HI>rea&s;on</HI> with us, &s;urely then it is our indi&s;|pen&s;able duty to <HI>rea&s;on</HI> with one another. The same prophet &s;ays, xlili-28. "Put me in remem|brance, let us <HI>plead</HI> together": also the prophet Mi|cah &s;ays, vi. 23. "Hear ye, O mountains, the Lord's <HI>controver&s;y,</HI> and ye &s;trong foundations of the earth, for the Lord hath a <HI>controver&s;y,</HI> with his people, he will <HI>plead</HI> with I&s;rael."&punc; "O my people, what have I done unto thee, and wherein have I wearied thee? te&s;tify again&s;t me:" Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf &s;ays, John v. 39. "Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which te&s;tify of me." What can po&s;&s;ibly be meant by &s;earching, if we are not to u&s;e our rational powers and facul|ties in judging or forming an opinion upon what we find? And how can we judge, or form an opin|ion but by exerci&s;ing tho&s;e powers and faculties which God has given us to di&s;tingui&s;h us from the
<PB N="10" REF="025603_0010_0FCDEEE9A6A3C110">
brutes? All the parables which are &s;o plentifully and beautifully inter&s;per&s;ed in the four Evangeli&s;ts, have a tendency to &s;hew the <HI>rea&s;onablene&s;s</HI> of the Go&s;pel. The apo&s;tle Paul in all his epi&s;tles exerci|&s;ed the&s;e powers and faculties; and the Bereans are &s;aid Acts xvii. II. "to be more noble than tho&s;e of The&s;&s;alonica, in that they received the word with all readine&s;s of mind, and &s;earched the Scriptures daily whether the&s;e things were &s;o": and in his defence before Felix, Acts x. iv. 25. he <HI>rea&s;oned</HI> &s;o &s;trongly of righteou&s;ne&s;s, temperance, and judgment to come, as to make Felix <HI>tremble.</HI> So al&s;o on a like occa|&s;ion, when he was permitted to an&s;wer for him&s;elf before king Agrippa, Acts xxvi I. his arguments were &s;o forcible that Agrippa publicly Confe&s;&s;ed that he was almo&s;t per&s;uaded to be a Chri&s;tian. The whole &s;y&s;tem of the Chri&s;tian religion was introdu|ced into the world by the <HI>rea&s;onablene&s;s</HI> of its pre|cepts, and by that gained a&s;cendency over all other religions. If then we are to exerci&s;e our rea&s;on on &s;ubjects of this nature, a &s;ubject of the greate&s;t im|portance to every one both here and hereafter, I claim your attention and candor to the rea&s;ons which I &s;hall now offer in ju&s;tification of the opinion where|of I am now accu&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place I &s;hall endeavor to &s;hew, upon the principles before e&s;tabli&s;hed, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Me&s;&s;iah is not, nor can be <HI>the eternal Father of all things,</HI> who is Omni&s;cient and omnipre&s;ent, God over all ble&s;&s;ed forever. And for the &s;upport of which I &s;hall appeal to the "law and the te&s;timo|ny: for if any man &s;peak not according to this word, it is becau&s;e there is no light in him." The Scriptures teach us that there is but <HI>one</HI> God, who is him&s;elf the maker and governor of all things; that this <HI>one</HI> God is the &s;ole object of wor&s;hip; and
<PB N="11" REF="025603_0011_0FCDEF6F508F26A8">
that <HI>he</HI> &s;ent Je&s;us Chri&s;t into the world to in&s;truct man|kind, empowered him to work miracles, rai&s;ed him from the dead, and gave him all the power that he everwas or is now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. The Scriptures con|tain the mo&s;t clear and expre&s;s declarations to this purpo&s;e. "Thou &s;halt have no other God before <HI>me.</HI>" Again, "hear O I&s;rael, the Lord our God is <HI>one</HI> Lord." Again, "to us there is but <HI>one</HI> God, the <HI>Father,</HI> of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by whom are all things, and we by him." Again, <HI>one</HI> Lord, <HI>one</HI> faith, <HI>one</HI> bap|ti&s;m, ONE GOD and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. For there is <HI>one</HI> God and one Mediator between God and men, the <HI>man</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us." It is no where in Scripture &s;aid that there are three per&s;ons in this one God, nor is the doctrine of a Trinity expre&s;sly laid down in any other direct propo&s;ition whatever. Chri&s;t him&s;elf indeed &s;ays "I and my father are one;" but he &s;uffi|ciently explains him&s;elf by praying that his di&s;ciples might be <HI>one</HI> with him in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e in which he was <HI>one</HI> with the Father, John xvii. 21, 22. "that they all may be one, as thou Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they al&s;o may be one in us; and the glory which thou gave&s;t me, I have given them, that they all may be one, even as we are one." The apo&s;tle John, 1&s;t. Epi&s;t. v. 7. &s;ays, that "there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Gho&s;t, and the&s;e three are one." By the Father I under&s;tand the creator of all things; by the Word, the power by which he &s;pake; and by the Holy Gho&s;t the divine influence which mani|fe&s;ts the being of a God, and his providence to man|kind; and are no more three di&s;tinct per&s;ons than the &s;pi|rit, water and blood, which con&s;titute every human being, make each man three men.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="025603_0012_0FCDEF70B9AE1918">
This one God is &s;aid to have created all things, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. God &s;aid let there be light, and there was light. By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the ho&s;ts of them by the breath of his mouth. He &s;pake, and it was done, he commanded and it &s;tood fa&s;t. Thus faith the Lord thy-Redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the Lord that maketh all things, that &s;tretcheth out the hea|vens alone, that &s;preadeth abroad the earth by my|&s;elf" This fame one God is called the <HI>Father,</HI> that is; the <HI>author</HI> of all things, as well with re&s;pect to Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, as all other brings. "That they may know thee the <HI>only true God,</HI> and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom <HI>thou</HI> haft &s;ent. Go to my brethren (&s;ays Chri&s;t) and &s;ay unto them, I a&s;cend unto <HI>my</HI> father and to <HI>your</HI> fa|ther, to <HI>my</HI> God and to <HI>your</HI> God." He al&s;o ex|pre&s;sly &s;ays that he is inferior to his Father, and that all his power was given him by the Father, and that he could do nothing without the Father, John xiv. 28, "My Father is greater than I. The &s;on can do nothing of him&s;elf. The words that I &s;peak un|to you, I &s;peak not of my&s;elf, but the Father that dwelleth in me, <HI>be</HI> doth the works, He received from God the Father honor and glory." Again, "the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t which <HI>God</HI> gave un|to him."</P>
<P>"It is &s;aid by &s;ome that Chri&s;t did not mean that he was inferior to the Father with re&s;pect to his di|vine nature, but only with re&s;pect to his human na|ture: but if &s;uch liberties be taken in explaining a per&s;on's meaning, language has no u&s;e whatever. Upon the &s;ame principle, it might be &s;aid that he never died, or that he never ro&s;e from the dead, &s;e|cretly meaning his divine nature only, 2nd there is
<PB N="13" REF="025603_0013_0FCDEF72E7F51C58">
no kind of impo&s;ition but what might be authori&s;ed by &s;uch an abu&s;e of language as this."</P>
<P>Some things are &s;aid to be with held from him: "Of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no not the angles; neither the &s;on, but the Father. To &s;it on my right hand and on my left is cot mine to give." So his dominion is &s;aid to be <HI>derived</HI> from the Fa|ther, and is <HI>&s;ubordinate</HI> to that of the Father; "and when all things &s;hall be &s;ubdued unto him, then &s;hall the &s;on al&s;o him&s;elf be &s;ubject unto him who put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</P>
<P>Seeing then Je&s;us Chri&s;t is not the eternal Father, who is he? To the law and to the te&s;timony. In the infancy of days, God told the &s;erpent, that the <HI>&s;eed</HI> of the woman &s;hould brui&s;e his head; is it then po&s;&s;ible that the <HI>&s;eed</HI> of the woman cad be older than the <HI>woman</HI> her&s;elf; and al&s;o co-equal and co eter|nal with God the creator of the woman? Al&s;o God told Abraham, that in his &s;eed all nations of the earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed; and this &s;eed (faith the apo&s;tle) is Chri&s;t. Hear al&s;o what Mo&s;es &s;aid to his people, Deut. xviii. 15. "the Lord thy God will rai&s;e up unto thee a <HI>prophet</HI> from the mid&s;t of thee of thy <HI>brethren,</HI> like unto <HI>me,</HI> unto him ye &s;hall hearken." The apo&s;tle Peter, Acts iii. 20. &amp;c. &s;peaks of Je&s;us Chri&s;t as being this &s;ame per&s;on who Mo&s;es foretold was to come, and &s;ays, that all the prophets, as ma|ny as have &s;poken have likewi&s;e foretold of the&s;e days. Luke in his genealogy has the&s;e words, iii. 23. "and Je&s;us him&s;elf began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was &s;uppo&s;ed) the &s;on of Jo|&s;eph." The words <HI>as was &s;uppo&s;ed</HI> are in a paren|the&s;is, which may be left out in readings, and the phra&s;e would then &s;tand thus "being the &s;on of Jo|&s;eph." This agrees with Mat. xv. 55. "Is not this the carpenter's &s;on? is not his mother called Mary,
<PB N="14" REF="025603_0014_0FCDEF759120B848">
and his brethren James and Jo&s;es, and Simon and Judas: and his &s;i&s;ters, are they not all with us? whence then hath this man all the&s;e things? and they were offended in him. But Je&s;us &s;aid unto them, a prophet is not without honor, &s;ave in his own coun|try and in his own hou&s;e." The Jews always con|ceived that the Me&s;&s;iah, would come from &s;ome di&s;|tingui&s;hed family, with great pomp, and it gave them great offence to &s;ee &s;o many of the people run|ning after this carpenters's &s;on, and calling him the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;ias, which led him to ob&s;erve as he did, intimating that tho&s;e whom they called low peo|ple, might have as great abilities, and be as highly favored of God, as tho&s;e of more elevated &s;tations, and &s;eemed in an oblique manner to reque&s;t their at|tention to Samuel, who &s;prang from no di&s;tingui&s;h|ed line according to their own genealogy, and to David, who was a man after God's own heart, not|with&s;tanding his father's being a hu&s;bandman, and he brought up tending &s;heep. Al&s;o this agrees with what Philip &s;aid to Nathaniel, John i. 45. "We have found him of whom Mo&s;es in the law and the pro|phets did write, Je&s;us of Nazareth the &s;on of Jo|&s;eph." He often called him&s;elf the &s;on of <HI>man;</HI> &s;o the woman of Samaria faith, "come &s;ee a man which told me all things that ever I did; is not this the Chri&s;t?" Je&s;us Chri&s;t al&s;o faith to the &s;ame woman, "ye wor&s;hip ye know not what, we know what we wor&s;hip: for &s;alvation is of the Jews." With this agreeth the apo&s;tles, Acts ii. 22. 'Je&s;us of Nazareth, a <HI>man</HI> approved of by God, by miracles, and won|ders, and &s;igns, which God did by him in the mid&s;t of you." Heb. ii. 17. "Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren.' Heb. ii. 10
<PB N="15" REF="025603_0015_0FCDEF76CF9AF6F0">
became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in bringing many &s;ons unto glory, to make the captain of their &s;alvation perfect through &s;uffering." 1. Cor. xv. 21. "for &s;ince by <HI>man</HI> came death, by <HI>man</HI> came al&s;o the re&s;urrection of the dead; for as in Adam all die, even &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive." So the apo&s;tle &s;ays, &s;peaking of Da|vid, "that God had &s;worn to him, that of the fruit of his loins according to the <HI>fle&s;h,</HI> he would rai&s;e up Chri&s;t to &s;it on his throne." Paul &s;peaks to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, Rom. i. 3. "concerning his &s;on, Je|&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord, which was made of the &s;eed of David, according to the <HI>fle&s;h,</HI> and declared to be the &s;on of God with power, according to the &s;pirit of holine&s;s, by the re&s;urrection from the dead." Hence I think it appears pretty clear that the di&s;ciples and apo&s;tles did not conceive of him in any other &s;en&s;e than as a man divinely favored of God.</P>
<P>I a&s;k your attention once more. It appears that the third day after he was crucified, two of his di&s;ciples went to Emmaus, and as they were talking and rea&s;oning about what had happened, Je&s;us drew near and walked with them, and a&s;ked them what they were talking about: they a&s;ked him if he was a &s;tranger in Jeru&s;alem, and did not know the things that had happened? and as they did not know him, they went on to tell him "concerning Je&s;us of Nazareth, who was a <HI>prophet,</HI> mighty in deed and word before God and all the people"; Luke xxiv. 19. and how he had been condemned and cru|cified, and that that it was then three days &s;ince this had happened, and that they had tru&s;ted that this Je|&s;us would have redeemed I&s;rael. Be&s;ides, they had heard &s;trange &s;tories about his being ri&s;en again. He then a&s;ked them if Chri&s;t ought not to have &s;uffered, "and beginning at Mo&s;es and all the prophets, he
<PB N="16" REF="025603_0016_0FCDEF7830656F50">
expounded unto them in all the Scriptures, the things concerning him&s;elf." Now if this doctrine of his being more than a man had been true, or of &s;o much importance as &s;ome would have it, why did he not teach it plainly to his di&s;ciples and apo&s;tles? but in&s;tead of this he told them that repentance and re|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins &s;hould be preached in his name, a|mong all nations: therefore let God be true and e|very man a liar; that is, every man who contradicts him. But there are &s;ome texts &s;aid to be my&s;terious, and &s;eemingly to contradict what has been before &s;aid: on the&s;e I &s;hall now ob&s;erve in their order.</P>
<P>John i. 1. &amp;c. "In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God, the &s;ame was in the beginning with God, all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made." The evangeli&s;t appears to me to be here recapitulating the great work of creation, and the word manife&s;ts the power and en|ergy by which he commanded all things into being: thus, "God &s;aid let there be light, and there was light. By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the ho&s;ts of them by the breath of his mouth. He &s;pake and it was done, he commanded and it &s;tood fa&s;t." Eph. iii. 9. "And to make all men &s;ee what is the fellow&s;hip of the my&s;tery which from the beginning of the world hath been bid in God, who created all things by Je&s;us Chri&s;t." Col. i. 1. "For by him were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in the earth, vi&s;ible and invi&s;i|ble, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or prin|cipalities, or powers; all things were created by him and for him. Here it may be ob&s;erved, that heaven and earth were not created by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but all things <HI>in</HI> heaven and <HI>in</HI> the earth; that is, all things re&s;|pecting the new world, or the Go&s;pel kingdom.
<PB N="17" REF="025603_0017_0FCDEF79A9FC7190">
Heb. i. 1, 2. "God, who at &s;undry times, and in di|vers manners, &s;pake in time pa&s;t unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in the&s;e la&s;t days &s;poken unto us by his &s;on, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom al&s;o he made the worlds." Here the a|po&s;tle u&s;es the plural number, worlds: this inti|mates that the&s;e <HI>all things</HI> re&s;pecting the Go&s;pel, of which he was appointed heir, would &s;pread far and wide into various regions and countries. The&s;e are the only texts, which &s;eem to favor the notion of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t's being the creator of the world, and the&s;e I think, will bear a different interpretation, &s;o as not to cla&s;h with other plain po&s;itive texts, which &s;peak of God as the author of all things. It appears to me that the apo&s;tles are here &s;peaking of the ex|cellency of the Go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, and of Je&s;us Chri&s;t as the creator, author, promulgator and fin|i&s;her of this di&s;pen&s;ation. Hence he is called the head of the body, the church, "who is the beginning, the fir&s;t-born from the dead, that in all things (re&s;|pecting the church) he might have the pre-eminence; for it plea&s;ed the Father, that in him, &s;hould all full|ne&s;s dwell." Al&s;o he is &s;aid to be made <HI>&s;o much bet|ter</HI> than the angels, as he hath by inheritance <HI>obtain|ed</HI> a more excellent name than they. John viii. 58. Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ays, "before Abraham was, I am." This text appears to me to be fully explained by St. Jhon, i. 30. "this is he of whom I &s;aid, after me cometh a <HI>man</HI> who is prefered before me; for he was before me." To <HI>prefer,</HI> &s;ignifies to regard, e&s;teem or value more than another, to exalt or rai&s;e to dignity. Thus Je&s;us Chri&s;t was preferred before Abraham, or any of his progenitors, for he was ex|alted or rai&s;ed by God far above any of Adam's race, and in this &s;en&s;e was <HI>before</HI> them. Phil. ii. 6. Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to
<PB N="18" REF="025603_0018_0FCDEF7CF17E1310">
be equal with God." Which I con&s;true thus, that be|ing a pattern of piety, and doing &s;uch things as none but God could do, does not rob God of any of his attributes. I Tim. iii. 16. "for without controver|&s;y, great is the my&s;tery of godline&s;s, God manife&s;t in the fle&s;h, ju&s;tified in the &s;pirit, &s;een of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory." That is, as if he had &s;aid, there is no di&s;pute but that the Go&s;pel now deliver|ed was in ancient days a my&s;tery, which is now made known by this Je&s;us, a fle&s;hly being, which was vindicated by the &s;pirit of every man, who duly con&s;idered its beneficent effects upon the world of mankind, as it tended to promote good will and bro|therly love among men, which the angels &s;aw would tend to the glory of God; and this Go&s;pel was pro|mulgated among the Gentiles, believed on in the world, and finally this &s;ame fle&s;hly being was recei|ved up into glory. But he is &s;aid to be "the alpha and omega, the beginning and the ending, the fir&s;t and the la&s;t." Very true, alpha is the fir&s;t letter in the Greek alphabet, omega is the la&s;t; the go&s;pel was promulgated to mankind in the Greek language, hence be is called the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and the <HI>la&s;t, beginning</HI> and the <HI>ending</HI> of the Go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation. But my bre|thren, &s;aying and doing are very different things; to &s;ay well is good, but to do well is better. A cer|tain man had two &s;ons, one of their names was Jew, the other's name was Gentile: At harve&s;t time the old gentleman called on his &s;ons to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his hu&s;bandry and to work in his vineyard. Jew told him plainly he would not, but after reflecting a little on the matter, he went. Gentile, like a good boy, &s;aid I will go &s;ir, but he went not. Which of the two think ye, did the will of his father? Methinks I hear &s;ome of you whi&s;per, he that went. It is idle

for any man to make a profe&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;|tian religion and not to live agreeable to the precepts thereof. How diametrically oppo&s;ite is it to the precepts and examples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the great au|thor of the Go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, to make it a bu&s;ine&s;s to go about from hou&s;e to hou&s;e tattling, making him&s;elf bu&s;y with every man's matters, railing at, &s;landering and per&s;ecuting his neighbour, reviling and backbiting those again&s;t whom he happens to have a di&s;ta&s;te, and anathematizing tho&s;e who do not form an opinion in religious matters a|greeable to his notion: this is diametrically oppo&s;ite to the precepts of that Go&s;pel which he profe&s;&s;es, which &s;ays, Mat. vii I. "judge not that ye be not judged, for with what judgment ye judge, ye &s;hall be judged, and with what mea&s;ure ye mete, it &s;hall be mea&s;ured to you again," and in&s;i&s;ts on taking a mote out of his brother's eye, without ever con&s;ider|ing that there is a beam in his own, or taking the lea&s;t thought of looking after it when he is told of it; or that he has no right to judge "another man's &s;er|vant" but emphatically &s;ays, "come not near me for I am holier than thou"; "the&s;e (&s;ays the prophet I|&s;aiah) lxv 5. are a &s;moke in my no&s;e, a fire that burn|eth all the day." A good tree, my brethren, cannot bring forth corrupt fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit, but every tree is known by its fruit; do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thi&s;tles? The&s;e are the very characters whom Je|&s;us Chri&s;t repre&s;ents as &s;hutting up heaven again&s;t men; they will not go in them&s;elves, and tho&s;e who would go in they hinder; who devour window's hou|&s;es and for a pre&s;ence make long prayers; who com|pa&s;s &s;ea and land to make one pro&s;elyte, and when he is made, make him two-fold more the child of hell than he was before. How oppo&s;ite is this to

the character of a Chri&s;tian, who always endeavors to deal ju&s;tly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with his God; who performs all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamele&s;s: full of pity and compa&s;&s;ion to all men, and loves the brethren that all men may know that he is Chri&s;t's di&s;ciple indeed and in truth, fulfilling the very la&s;t point; "&s;on (as the apo&s;tle James &s;ays, ii.10.) who&s;oever &s;hall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point, is guilty of all." To keep the whole law, that is, the code of moral laws, and yet break one of tho&s;e laws, is a contradiction in terms: for if the whole were kept, no one could be broken.</P>
<P>A young man came to Je&s;us Chri&s;t in his day, and a&s;ked him what he &s;hould do to inherit eternal life: he an&s;wered keep the commandments, and told him which they were, that is, thou &s;haft do no murder, nor commit adultery, nor &s;teal, nor bear fal&s;e witne&s;s, but honor thy father and mother, and love thy neighbor as thy&s;elf. All the&s;e (&s;ays the young man) I have kept from my youth up, what lack I yet? If thou wilt be perfect, go and &s;ell all that thou ha&s;t, and give to the poor: that is, as if he had &s;aid, thou ha&s;t abundance of this world's goods, therefore thou oughte&s;t to be more charitable to the poor and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, this is one thing needful. And the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "though I &s;peak with the tongues of men, or of angels, and have not charity, I am be|come as &s;ounding bra&s;s or a tinkling cymbal: and though I have the gift of prophecy, and under&s;tand all my&s;teries and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, &s;o that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I be&s;tow all goods to the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. Charity &s;uffereth long and is kind, charity envieth not, charity vaunteth not it&s;elf, is not puffed up, doth not behave it&s;elf un&s;eemly, &s;eeketh not her own, is not ea&s;ily PROVOKED, thinketh no evil, rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Charity never faileth; but whether there be prophecies, they &s;hall fail; whether there be tongues, they &s;hall cea&s;e; whether there be know|ledge, it &s;hall vani&s;h away. When I was a child, I &s;pake as a child, I under&s;tood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childi&s;h things. And now abideth faith, hope, charity, the&s;e three; but the greate&s;t of the&s;e is charity." This is the one point, which if any man neglect to keep, he is verily guilty of offending again&s;t the mo&s;t important command contained in the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>

I &s;hall now give you by way of conclu&s;ion a &s;hort &s;chedule of the introduction of creeds into the Chri&s;|tian church; for in the days of Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, there was no creed required of Chri&s;tians except "believe in God, believe al&s;o in me," that is, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, "Believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t and thou &s;hall be &s;aved;" but they were cautioned not to believe every &s;pirit, but to <HI>try</HI> the &s;pirits, whe|ther they were of God; becau&s;e many fal&s;e prophets had gone out into the world; and they were told how they &s;hould know the true &s;pirit from the fal&s;e ones; that is, "every &s;pirit that confe&s;seth that Je|&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the <HI>fle&s;h,</HI> is of God." Con|&s;tantine, Emperor of Rome, about three hundred years after Chri&s;t, having &s;ome remor&s;e of con&s;ci|ence for &s;ome enormities he had committed, applied to the prie&s;ts of the church of Ceres (then a heathen Church) for a pardon: They knowing his crimes, refu&s;ed to grant his reque&s;t. He took umbrage at their refu&s;al, and immediately applied to the Chri&s;|tian Bi&s;hops, who embraced the favorable opportu|nity, and told him, they would grant his reque&s;t &mdash; provided he would confe&s;s his faults, and take the Chri&s;tian religion under his protection. He accept|ed their propo&s;ition, made a confe&s;&s;ion, received his pardon, and then i&s;&s;ued a decree in favour of the Chri&s;tian religion, declaring it to be the religion of his empire. Soon after, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h a uni|formity in religious matters, he called a council of the clergy to a&s;&s;emble at Nice, in which he attended him&s;elf, and after long altercations they brought forth what is now called the Athana&s;ian creed; tho' a number of the clergy then di&s;&s;ented, and &s;ome o|thers who complied, and &s;ub&s;cribed the creed for the &s;ake of conformity, went home, explained away the rigor of it, and taught their people a very differ|ent

the comfort, peace and edification of the Church, and corrupt the doctrine of faith which is the Bond of Chri&s;tian communion, and the church think it their duty to give their te&s;timony again&s;t it: but as brother Hill profe&s;&s;es his &s;erious and hearty belief of the Chri&s;tian religion as contained in the &s;acred Scriptures, and his readine&s;s to receive any farther light which may be offered to him from the word of God, charity di&s;po&s;es to hope and pre&s;ume that he is not confirmed and ob&s;tinate in his mi&s;takes, but that upon better con&s;ideration he will &s;ee rea&s;on to purge out that un&s;avory leaven, which gives offence to &s;o many &s;erious Chri&s;tians: and it is our de&s;ire, in conformity to the Rules of the Go&s;pel, to re&s;tore an offending brother in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s, and heal his wound with a tender hand: we do now ear|ne&s;tly exhort him humbly and prayerfully to &s;earch the Scriptures, to &s;earch his own heart, and keep his mind open to conviction, to guard again&s;t preju|dices, and not think it any di&s;honor to give up any mi&s;takes which he may have unwarily entertained, and it is our hearty de&s;ire and prayer that he and we may be guided and kept in the way of truth, and that our contending for the faith delivered to the Saints may be conducted with charity and patience; that we may beware of the devices of Satan and &s;tu|dy the things which make peace and whereby one may edify another."</P>
