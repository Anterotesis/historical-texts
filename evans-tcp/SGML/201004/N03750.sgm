<P>_IN this Book we have a very me|morable and in&s;tructive Hi&s;tory. The Prophet <HI>Jonah,</HI> who&s;e Name the Book bears, was call'd of GOD to go to <HI>Nineveh,</HI> the Ca|pital of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian Monarchy,</HI> and cry again&s;t it&mdash;: He cri|minally attempted to fly from the Pre&s;ence of the Lord, by going to <HI>Joppa,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Tar&s;hi&s;h;</HI> but that GOD whom the Winds and Sea obey, rai&s;ed &s;uch a Storm as made the Heathen Mariners conclude there was &s;omething

very extraordinary, and accordingly they pro|po&s;e to ca&s;t Lots, that they might know for who&s;e Cau&s;e this Evil was upon them. <HI>Jonah</HI> is taken, and ca&s;t into the Sea; upon which it cea&s;ed from raging: And thus, by the wonder|ful Providence of GOD, he became a Type of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who having appea&s;ed the Wrath of GOD by his Obedience unto Death, lay buried in the Earth three Days, Matth. 12.40. <HI>For as Jonas was three Days and three Nights in the Whale's Belly : So &s;hall the Son of Man be three Days and three Nights in the Heart of the Earth. Jonah</HI> having cried to GOD, as <HI>out of the Belly of Hell,</HI> was delivered from his dreadful Confinement. Chap. 2. v. 10. <HI>The Lord &s;pake unto the Fi&s;h, and it vomited Jonah upon the dry Land.</HI> Thus the brute Creation, even the mighty Whales, obey the Word of GOD's Power, while Men tran&s;gre&s;s his Law. <HI>Jonah,</HI> being thus delivered from the Depth of Di&s;tre&s;s, obeys the &s;econd Call of GOD to him, <HI>Ch.</HI> 3. <HI>v.</HI> 1.

at lea&s;t three Days to go thro' all the principal Streets and Lanes of the City, to proclaim his Me&s;&s;age, that all might have Notice of it" However, no Greatne&s;s or worldly Glory will be any Security again&s;t GOD's de&s;troying Judg|ments, if &s;uch Places go on ob&s;tinately in their Sins. O let not LONDON! let not <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> pre|&s;ume to <HI>deal unju&s;tly in the Land of Uprightne&s;s,</HI> le&s;t the holy GOD &s;ay of them as of his anci|ent People, <HI>You have I known of all the Families of the Earth : Therefore I will puni&s;h you for all your Iniquities,</HI> Amos 3.2. But to return, <HI>Jonah,</HI> in Obedience to the divine Command, cries again&s;t this great City, <HI>Yet forty Days, and</HI> Nineveh <HI>&s;hall be overthrown, v.</HI> 4. In the five following Ver|&s;es, we have the Faith and Repentance of the <HI>Ninevites</HI> de&s;cribed, which our Lord takes par|ticular Notice of, Matth. 12.41. <HI>The Men of Nineveh &s;hall ri&s;e in Judgment with this Generation, and &s;hall condemn it, becau&s;e they repented at the preaching of Jonas, and behold, a greater than Jonas is here.</HI> Let us then attend to the&s;e Words <HI>with Reverence and godly Fear, le&s;t they al&s;o ri&s;e up in Judgment again&s;t us in the terrible Day of the Lord.</HI> And here I would more particularly ob&s;erve, 1. <HI>The People of Nineveh believed GOD,</HI> v. 5 <HI>Jonah,</HI> we may &s;uppo&s;e, declared to them the true and living GOD, who made Heaven and Earth, and publi&s;h'd his Me&s;&s;age in his Name&punc; and GOD wrought &s;uch a Faith in them as excited a Fear of his Judgments, and made them deeply con|cern'd to put away their provoking Sins, that they might e&s;cape the threatned De&s;truction. And this Impre&s;&s;ion of Fear and Concern was general; for we find, 2dly, <HI>That they proclaim'd a Fa&s;t, and put on Sackcloth from the greate&s;t of them even to the lea&s;t of them.</HI> Yea, there was a royal
<PB N="4" REF="004597_0008_100DA8D012585D88">
Proclamation for this <HI>by the Decree of the King and his Nobles,</HI> v. 7. And this great Monarch hum|bled him&s;elf before the <HI>Mo&s;t High,</HI> who cuts off the &s;pirit of Princes, and is terrible to the Kings of the Earth. The King of <HI>Nineveh</HI> aro&s;e from his Throne, and laid his Robe from him, and cover'd him with Sackcloth, and &s;at in A&s;hes, v. 6. Thus did he practically confe&s;s, that he had behav'd unworthy his royal Dignity, and de&s;erv'd to have it taken from him. And the Proclamation requir'd the &s;tricte&s;t Ab&s;tinence, <HI>Let neither Man nor Bea&s;t ta&s;te any Thing</HI> Not as if the Bea&s;ts were capable of moral Good or Evil; but as the&s;e had been abus'd by them, they would have their Moans and Cries under the Want of Food, further to excite penitential Sorrow in them&s;elves&punc; And all are commanded to <HI>cry mightily to God,</HI> v. 8. Yea, all are ex|horted to <HI>turn every one from his evil Way,</HI> and from the <HI>Violence</HI> that is in their Hands. The <HI>Ninevites</HI> were &s;en&s;ible, that to outward Signs and Means of Humiliation, they mu&s;t add Repentance and Reformation. 3. <HI>We have their Encouragement to attend this Duty,</HI> in a Time of impending Judgment, <HI>v.</HI> 9. <HI>Who can tell if God will turn and repent</HI> &mdash;. We may &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Jonah</HI> declar'd to them the Grace and Mer|cy of the GOD of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and &s;hew'd them the Way of Salvation thro' the then promi&s;ed <HI>Me&s;&s;iah;</HI> that tho' their Bodies &s;hould be de&s;troy'd, their Souls might be &s;av'd in the Day of the Lord. And they might well infer &s;ome Ground of Hope as to their temporal Deliverance from this, that the Judgment was not pre&s;ently executed; but the Space of forty Days was given them for Repentance. However, as it doth not appear they had any particular Promi&s;e re&s;pecting this
<PB N="5" REF="004597_0009_100DA8D2CCA69620">
Matter, &s;o their Faith and Hope are here ex|pre&s;s'd as attended with Doubt and Fear <HI>Who can tell?</HI> A like Expre&s;&s;ion we have, even re&s;pect|ing GOD's covenant People <HI>Who knows if he will return and repent</HI> &mdash;? Joel 2.14 4. <HI>We have an Account of Nineveh's Repentance, and GOD's gracious Deliverance,</HI> v 10. <HI>GOD &s;aw their Works, i. e</HI> with Approbation and gracious Acceptance. Their Works "whereby they te&s;tified the Sin|cerity of their Faith and Repentance." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dutch Annotations.</NOTE> Our Saviour &s;ays, <HI>they repented at the preaching of Jonas,</HI> Luke 11.32. We may conclude therefore that his Preaching was accompanied with the power|ful Influences of the Spirit of GOD convincing them of their many hainous Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, a|wakening them with Fears of GOD's Judgments, and prevailing upon them to turn from their Sins to the Lord. Had it not been for this wonderful Work of Grace upon them, they had been like to the Sinners of the old World, who went on &s;ecurely, tho' <HI>Noah</HI> was a <HI>Preacher of Righteou&s;ne&s;s to them, 'till the Flood came, and took them all away.</HI> Here were &s;ome, I hope, and that not a few, who had &s;aving Repentance gi|ven them; and others were &s;o terrified and a|wakened, that they engaged at lea&s;t in an out|ward and publick Reformation. And may we not &s;uppo&s;e that in this wonderful Work GOD gave his ancient People a Specimen and Ear|ne&s;t of the Call of the Gentiles? Now, upon this their Repentance it is &s;aid, <HI>GOD repented of the Evil, and he did it not.</HI> Which Words mu&s;t be under&s;tood in &s;uch a Sen&s;e as is con&s;i&s;tent with the divine Perfections. It is not &s;poken
<PB N="6" REF="004597_0010_100DA8D45A026E98">
of GOD, as if he could in a proper Sen&s;e be griev'd for what he had done in threatning the <HI>Ninevites;</HI> no, this was right, and he had a graci|ous De&s;ign in it: Nor, as if he had alter'd his Coun&s;els concerning them&punc; He is of one Mind, and who can turn him? Nor, as if he acted contrary to Truth and Faithfulne&s;s; no, the Threatning was conditional. And accordingly when they repented GOD turned from his fierce Anger, and gave them Deliverance; which is agreable to that Rule of his Government which we have declar'd, Jer. 18.7.8. <HI>At what In&s;tant I &s;hall &s;peak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to de&s;troy it: If that Nation again&s;t whom I have pronounced, turn from their Evil, I will repent of the Evil that I thought to do unto them.</HI></P>
<P>From the Words thus explained to you, I would ob&s;erve the following Doctrines,</P>
<P>[1.] If we would &s;eek the Lord in a right manner, we mu&s;t believe Him; the Threatnings and Promi&s;es of His Word. [2.] It is the Duty of a People to cry to GOD in Prayer with Fa&s;ting, when He threatens to bring de|&s;troying Judgments upon them; and their Ru|lers &s;hould be ready to lead in the right Di&s;|charge of this Duty. [3.] Our &s;eeking to GOD by Prayer with Fa&s;ting mu&s;t be atten|ded with true Repentance, and &s;incere Endea|vours after Reformation. [4.] When a Peo|ple do thus attend their Duty, GOD will re|pent of the Evil, and not bring De&s;truction upon them.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<PB N="7" REF="004597_0011_100DA8D6D5E56090">
<HEAD>I. <HI>If we would &s;eek the Lord in a right Manner under his threatned Judgments, we must believe Him; the Threatnings and Promi&s;es of his Word.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The People of <HI>Nineveh</HI> believed GOD, and proclaimed a Fa&s;t&mdash;. We are not told what particular Credentials <HI>Jonah</HI> produc'd to prove that he was a true Prophet &s;ent from GOD. His Preaching might be more full and particular than is here recorded; and GOD &s;et it home, &s;o that they were made &s;en&s;ible they had to do with the true and faithful One, who&s;e Name is <HI>Jehovah;</HI> and accordingly they &s;et them&s;elves to entreat his Favour with great Seriou&s;ne&s;s. And thus we mu&s;t believe, that the Lord is that pow|erful, holy, faithful, and merciful GOD, which he declareth him&s;elf to be in his Word. We mu&s;t reali&s;e it, that his Word is &s;ure and mo&s;t worthy of Credit, whether he threatens Evil to the Impenitent, or promi&s;eth Mercy to &s;uch as confe&s;s and for&s;ake their Sins; or we &s;hall never be concern'd to &s;eek his Face in a right Man|ner. <HI>Without Faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God,</HI> in our Approaches to him: For he that cometh to GOD, <HI>mu&s;t believe that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently &s;eek him.</HI> Heb. 11.6. Agreably, in a Time of Danger, that pious King <HI>Jeho&s;haphet,</HI> &s;aid to GOD's ancient People, <HI>Hear me, O Judah, and ye the Inhabitants of Jeru&s;a|lem, Believe in the Lord your God, &s;o &s;hall you be e&s;tabli&s;hed; believe his Prophets, &s;o &s;hall ye pro&s;per.</HI> 2 Chron. 20.20. Certainly then, we who are born under the clear Light of the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen|&s;ation, mu&s;t believe the Lord our GOD &s;peaking to us in his Word, if we would attend the Duties of this Day, &s;o as to obtain Mercy for our&s;elves, and this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed People. We mu&s;t believe
<PB N="8" REF="004597_0012_100DA8DA5C465F70">
that if we go on ob&s;tinately in our Sins, and de&s;pi&s;e the Warnings GOD has given us in his Word and by his Providences, we &s;hall after our hardne&s;s and impenitent Heart trea&s;ure up unto our &s;elves Wrath again&s;t the Day of Wrath; But if we for&s;ake the Way of Sin, and return unto the Lord, He will have Mercy and abun|dantly Pardon. We mu&s;t believe our Lord Je&s;us when he &s;ays to us, <HI>Except ye repent, ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e peri&s;h.</HI> And we mu&s;t al&s;o receive it as <HI>a faithful &s;aying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chri&s;t Je&s;us came into the World to &s;ave Sinners,</HI> and will ca&s;t out none that come to Him in the Exerci&s;e of Faith and Repentance. <HI>O</HI> that there was &s;uch a Faith in us! Then we &s;hould fly to GOD's Name, as to our &s;trong Tower this Day, and find Him our Defence and Refuge in the Day of Trouble. <HI>By Faith Noah being warn|ned of God of Things not &s;een as yet, moved with fear, prepared an Ark to the &s;aving of his Hou&s;e; by the which he condemned the World, and became Heir of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is by Faith,</HI> Heb. 11.7.</P>

<HEAD>II. <HI>IT is the Duty of a People to cry to GOD in Prayer with Fa&s;ting, when He threatens to bring de&s;troying Judgments upon them; and their Rulers &s;hould be ready to lead in the right Di&s;charge of this Duty.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Thus did the Men of <HI>Nineveh,</HI> nor did their King refu&s;e to humble him&s;elf and lie in the Du&s;t before that Almighty GOD who threat|ned to de&s;troy them. The Order given was, <Q>Let Man and Bea&s;t be covered with Sackcloth, and cry mightily to GOD</Q> This then is a moral Duty incumbent on all as GOD &s;hall call.
<PB N="9" REF="004597_0013_100DA8DBE6A88F88">
GOD's ancient People practi&s;ed it. Thus when the Children of <HI>Moab</HI> and <HI>Ammon</HI> came again&s;t <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI> to Battel, he feared, <HI>and &s;et him&s;elf to &s;eek the Lord, and proclaimed a Fa&s;t,</HI> 2 Chron. 20.1,&mdash;3. And we have an Account in Scripture of more private Fa&s;ting, <HI>Mark</HI> 2.18, 20. Where we are informed that the Di&s;ciples of <HI>John,</HI> and of the Phari&s;ees u&s;ed to Fa&s;t. And our Lord declares that after his departure, <HI>His Di&s;ciples &s;hould al&s;o Fa&s;t.</HI> And we have particular Direction about religious Fa&s;ting, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.5. Here then, I would be a little more particular in de&s;cribing the Duty of Fa&s;ting and Prayer, in which we are this Day engaged.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IN religious Fa&s;ting we mu&s;t cha&s;ten our Bodies, by ab&s;taining from Meat and Drink, and other Plea&s;ures which gratify the outward Man.</HI></P>
<P>Thus mu&s;t we acknowledge that we have a|bu&s;ed GOD's good Creatures, and are unwor|thy of the lea&s;t Drop and Crumb even of the Ble&s;&s;ings of his common Providence. And in this Way we ought to afflict and keep under our Bodies, that our animal Appetites may be bro't into Subjection, and that our Souls may be the more deeply humbled before GOD. Indeed the Nece&s;&s;ity of Per&s;ons, re&s;pecting the Weakne&s;s of &s;ome Con&s;titutions, is here to be regarded. However, When Per&s;ons want only indulge their Appetites, and find their own Plea&s;ures when GOD calls to weeping and mourning, is &s;inful and &s;hameful&punc; And GOD declares in his Word, that this is a provoking Evil, I&s;ai. 22.12, &mdash; 14. <HI>In that Day did the Lord God of ho&s;ts call to weeping and to mourning, and to girding with Sackcloth: And behold Joy and Gladne&s;s, &s;laying Oxen, and killing Sheep, eating Fle&s;h, and drinking Wine; let us eat
<PB N="10" REF="004597_0014_100DA8DE468AF128">
and drink, for to morrow we &s;hall die. And it was revealed in mine Ears by the Lord of ho&s;ts, Surely this iniquity &s;hall not be purged from you till ye die, &s;aith the Lord God of ho&s;ts.</HI> And &s;urely the Men of <HI>Nineveh</HI> will ri&s;e up in Judgment again&s;t &s;uch, and condemn them; for we find they were very &s;trict in attending the&s;e outward Signs and Means of Humiliation. But then, it mu&s;t be granted that this bodily Ab&s;tinence will Profit little, unle&s;s our Hearts are broken for Sin, and broken off from the Plea&s;ures of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. IN religious Fa&s;ting we mu&s;t <HI>afflict our Souls; have the Heart inwardly pierced, and the Spirits bro|ken upon the Account of our Sins.</HI></P>
<P>That GOD who is a Spirit, and forms the Spi|rit of Man within Him, looks on the Heart, and requireth us to Wor&s;hip Him in Spirit and Truth. <HI>The Sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit: a broken and contrite Heart, O God thou wilt not de|&s;pi&s;e,</HI> P&s;al. 51.17. The Call of GOD to his Peo|ple on a Day of &s;olemn Fa&s;ting, was that, <HI>Rent your Heart,</HI> Joel 2.13. There mu&s;t then be a deep and thorow Conviction of Sin, and Contri|tion upon the Account of it. We mu&s;t <HI>look to Je&s;us</HI> whom our Sins have pierced, and <HI>mourn as one mourneth for his only Son, and be in bitterne&s;s, as one that is in bitterne&s;s for his Fir&s;t-born,</HI> Zech. 12.10. There mu&s;t be Hatred of Sin, and Indig|nation at it, as the accur&s;ed Thing which &s;tirs up GOD's holy Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t us. There mu&s;t be inward Grief, becau&s;e GOD has been di&s;honour'd and his Law broken by our Sins: <HI>That godly Sorrow which worketh Repentance,</HI> 2 Cor. 7.10.

</LIST></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>What is implied in this Work of Repen|tance and Reformation?</HI></P>
<P N="1">A. 1. It implieth, <HI>An holy and prevailing Re|&s;olution to turn from tho&s;e Sins which we confe&s;s on the Day of Fa&s;ting.</HI> When we appear before GOD to confe&s;s our Sins and ask Pardon for them; if we attend this Duty in Sincerity, we are con|vinc'd that it is an evil and bitter thing that we have for&s;aken GOD by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing his Law; and we &s;hall accordingly re&s;olve to put away this accur&s;ed thing which &s;eparates be|tween GOD and us, and engage to return to GOD and our Duty. Thus did GOD's People on a &s;olemn Fa&s;t. <HI>They entred into an Oath to walk in God's Law,</HI> and <HI>&s;olemnly promis'd,</HI> that they would <HI>reform the Evils</HI> which had crept in among them; in taking &s;trange Wives, in pro|faning the Sabbath, in their cruel exacting up|on their poor Brethren, <HI>&amp;c. Neh.</HI> 9.38. 10.29,&mdash;31. And it is certainly &s;ea&s;onable and ne|ce&s;&s;ary for Per&s;ons on &s;uch a Day to re&s;olve, relying on GOD for Grace, to put away &s;uch and &s;uch Sins as have more ea&s;ily be&s;et them, to take more Care to keep them&s;elves from their own Iniquity, and to reform whatever hath been contrary to GOD's Law.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="004597_0018_100DA8E763B13118">Which leads me to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">2, It intends, <HI>That this Re&s;olution be put in Practice in &s;incere Endeavours to put away tho&s;e Sins and reform tho&s;e Evils, which have been confe&s;s'd and bewail'd before God.</HI> This GOD requires of us. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord God, Repent and turn your &s;elves from all your Idols, and turn away your Faces from all your Abominations,</HI> Ezek. 14.6. And after this manner did the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> te&s;tify their Repentance, when they cried to the Lord under the Oppre&s;&s;ion of their Enemies. <HI>And they put away the &s;trange gods from among them, and &s;erved the Lord: and his &s;oul was grieved for the mi&s;ery of I&s;rael,</HI> Judg. 10.16. Agreeably, When we have fa&s;ted and prayed, we mu&s;t bring forth <HI>Fruits meet for Repentance,</HI> by engaging in a thorow Reformation of all Sins of Omi&s;&s;ion or Commi&s;&s;i|on. If we have omitted religious Duties, Se|cret or Family Prayer, Self-Examination, the Ordinances of GOD's Hou&s;e; we mu&s;t now con&s;cienciou&s;ly attend upon them. If we have neglected the Duties of tho&s;e Relations which we &s;u&s;tain towards Men, in publick or private Life; we mu&s;t now with Care and Diligence di&s;charge them. If we have committed Sins contrary to the Laws of Sobriety, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Godline&s;s; we mu&s;t labour by the Spirit to mortify them In a Word, We &s;hould clean&s;e our &s;elves from all Filthine&s;s of the Fle&s;h and Spi|rit, perfecting Holine&s;s in the Fear of GOD. And in order to the&s;e Things, we ought earne&s;tly &s;eek to GOD to put his Laws into our Minds, and write them in our Hearts; for it is He alone that can work in us to will and to do, in beginning and carrying on this nece&s;&s;ary Work of Reformation.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="15" REF="004597_0019_100DA8E9B8572820">3. <HI>That We return to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; to be|lieve in, love and obey Him.</HI> The Prophet <HI>Ho&s;eae</HI> complains, <HI>They return but not to the mo&s;t High,</HI> 7.16. Whereas, when a Reformation is &s;incere and general, we &s;hall have a Regard to the Lord our GOD in it, as to our chief Good and high|e&s;t End. We &s;hall not be principally concern'd to &s;erve a turn, and E&s;cape this or the other threatned Judgment. As they, <HI>When he &s;lew them, then they &s;ought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. And they remembred that God was their Rock, and the high God their Redeemer. Never|thele&s;s, they did flatter him with their Mouth, and they lied unto him with their Tongues,</HI> P&s;al. 7 8 34,&mdash;36. But &s;hall make it our great Bu&s;ine&s;s to obtain Peace with GOD thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t the only Mediator, who has made Peace thro' the Blood of his Cro&s;s. And then &s;hall we endea|vour to be &s;tedfa&s;t in his Covenant. The Language of our Hearts mu&s;t be as Ho&s;. 6 1. <HI>Come and let us return unto the Lord: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath &s;mitten, and he will bind us up 14.3. As&s;hur &s;hall not &s;ave us, we will not ride upon Hor&s;es, neither will we &s;ay any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the Fatherle&s;s findeth mercy.</HI> We mu&s;t return to GOD as to our Lord and Lawgiver, to obey and &s;erve him; as to the Object of our De&s;ire and Choice, to take our full Content|ment in Him: Thus it is &s;aid of GOD's People &mdash; <HI>All Judah rejoiced at the Oath: for they had &s;worn with all their Heart, and &s;ought him with their whole de&s;ire, and he was found of them,</HI> 2 Chr. 15.15. As to particular Per&s;ons, It is nece&s;&s;ary that they thus give up them&s;elves to the Lord, and then keep the Covenant of their GOD. And as to a People, con&s;idering them collectively,
<PB N="16" REF="004597_0020_100DA8EBDD930B80">
this mu&s;t be their prevailing De&s;ire and Practice: If they are generally fal&s;e &amp; hypocritical, they will give GOD rea&s;on to complain of them, as of his ancient People, <HI>O Ephraim, what &s;hall I do unto thee: O Judah, what &s;hall I do unto thee: for your goodne&s;s is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.</HI> Ho&s;. 6.4.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Why &s;hould our Days of Fa&s;ting be thus attended with &s;incere Endeavours after Reforma|tion?</HI></P>
<P N="1">A. 1. <HI>GOD demands this of us.</HI> When that In|quiry was made, Wherewith &s;hall I come be|fore the Lord, and bow my &s;elf before the high GOD? Shall I come before him with Burnt-offer|ings?&mdash;Will the Lord be plea&s;ed with thou|&s;ands of Rams or with Ten Thou&s;ands of Ri|vers of Oyl? The An&s;wer is, <HI>He hath &s;hewed thee, O Man, what is good, and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do ju&s;tly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</HI> Micah 6.8 And therefore, when GOD's People fa&s;ted in a formal cu&s;tomary manner, without engaging in the nece&s;&s;ary Work of Reformation, GOD &s;aid to them, <HI>Did ye at all Fa&s;t unto me, even to me?</HI> And then it follows, <HI>Execute true Judgment, and &s;hew Mercy and Compa&s;&s;ions every Man to his Brother. And oppre&s;s not the Widow, nor the Father|le&s;s, the Stranger, nor the Poor, and let none of you imagine Evil again&s;t his Brother in your Heart,</HI> Zech. 7.8, 10.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>GOD makes precious Promi&s;es to encourage and excite us to this Duty.</HI> Thus when GOD had ex|horted his People to put away the Evil of their Doings, he adds for their Encouragement, <HI>Come now and let us rea&s;on together, &s;aith the Lord: though
<PB N="17" REF="004597_0021_100DA8EE68BEE498">
your Sins be as Scarlet, they &s;hall be white as Snow, though they be red like Crim&s;on, they &s;hall be as Wool If ye be willing and obedient, ye &s;hall eat the good of the Land.</HI> And in the 55th Chapter we have that Exhortation enforc'd with a Pro|mi&s;e of full and free Pardon, V. 6, 7. <HI>Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near. Let the Wicked for&s;ake his Way, and the unrighteous Man his Thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</HI> Ver. 6, 7. Surely then, we mu&s;t be ba&s;ely ungrate|ful, if we are not drawn with the&s;e Cords of a a Man, and Bands of Love. While we refu&s;e to attend this great Duty, we practically de&s;pi&s;e the Riches of GOD's <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> whereby He <HI>leads Sinners to Repentance.</HI> And this is another Rea|&s;on why we &s;hould engage in the Work of Re|pentance and Reformation.</P>
<P N="3">3. If we refu&s;e to repent and reform, <HI>we &s;hall be condemned out of our own Mouths, and fall under the threatned Judgments of GOD.</HI> One con&s;iderable Part of the Duty of a Day of religious Fa&s;ting is to make an humble and penitent Confe&s;&s;ion of our Sins whereby we have provoked a holy GOD to come out in Judgment again&s;t us, and to cry to Him for Grace that we may turn from them. Thus 'tis &s;aid of GOD's People on the Day of &s;olemn Fa&s;ting recorded Neh. 9. <HI>The Seed of I&s;rael &s;tood and confe&s;&s;ed their Sins, and the Iniquities of their Fathers:</HI> 2d v. But if there be no Care to put away the Sins which we have confe&s;s'd, we &s;hall give our Lord and Judge rea&s;on to &s;ay to us as to the wicked Servant, <HI>Out of thine own Mouth will I judge thee.</HI> Now this will be dreadful indeed, and mu&s;t aggravate
<PB N="18" REF="004597_0022_100DA8EFF5600C18">
our Condemnation, to be thus Self-condemned; and &s;o to fall under the righteous Judgment of GOD. We have the Proof of this written for our Warning in the doleful Account which the Scripture gives of the Sin and Puni&s;hment of GOD's ancient Covenant People. Tho' they had their Days of <HI>Fa&s;ting,</HI> particularly on the <HI>&s;eventh Month,</HI> when the High Prie&s;t was to make an Atonement for him&s;elf and the People, and enter into the holy Place within the Vail, <HI>Lev.</HI> 16. Notwith&s;tanding this, GOD &s;aid to his People, If ye will not be reformed, but will walk contrary to me, then will I al&s;o walk contrary to you, and will puni&s;h you &s;even Times for your Sins. And GOD fulfilled his Word. <HI>They mocked the Me&s;&s;engers of God, and de&s;pi&s;ed his Words, and mi&s;u&s;ed his Prophets, until the Wrath of the Lord aro&s;e again&s;t his People, till there was no Remedy,</HI> 2 Chron 36 16. <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> and the <HI>Temple</HI> were de&s;troyed by Fire, and GOD's People led into Captivity to <HI>Babylon.</HI> And after their merciful Re&s;toration, when they had filled up the mea|&s;ure of their Sins by di&s;obeying and crucifying the <HI>Lord of Glory,</HI> and then by rejecting the Offers of the Go&s;pel made to them by His <HI>Apo&s;tles;</HI> the Wrath of GOD came upon them to the ut|termo&s;t by the <HI>Romans,</HI> and they are made an Execration and a Cur&s;e unto this Day.</P>

and Favour to the Penitent. <HI>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen &amp; repent, and do the fir&s;t Works; or el&s;e I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy Candle&s;tick out of his Place, except thou repent.</HI> Rev. 2.5. Thus GOD &s;aid to the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah, Take thee a Roll of a Book, and write therein all the Words that I have &s;poken unto Thee again&s;t I&s;rael, and again&s;t all the Nations, from the Day I &s;pake unto thee, from the Days of Jo&s;iah, even unto this Day. It may be the Hou&s;e of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpo&s;e to do unto them; that they may return every Man from his evil Way, that I may forgive their Iniquity and their Sin,</HI> Jer. 36 2, 3. GOD knew perfectly well what they would do; but then he here lets his People know how ready he was to forgive the Penitent and receive them into Favour: It's true, Such as repent may be afflicted in this Life; but then it is with the tender Compa&s;&s;ion of a Father, not with the deadly wound of an Enemy. The fir&s;t and pure&s;t Times of Chri&s;tianity were Times of Per&s;ecution; however, while the holy <HI>Mar|tyrs</HI> overcame by the Blood of the <HI>Lamb,</HI> not loving their Lives unto the Death; the Church was pre&s;erv'd, yea increa&s;ed and multiplied. And as to a People, con&s;idering them collectively, I &s;uppo&s;e no one In&s;tance can be produc'd in which GOD pour'd out his Fury to de&s;troy them, while a Spirit of Repentance and Refor|mation prevail'd. And even in Times of aboun|ding Iniquity, when the Glory of GOD was de|parting from his People, and de&s;troying Judg|ments breaking in like a Flood; GOD was plea|&s;ed to make a remarkable Di&s;tinction between the Penitent, and &s;uch as were hardned in Sin. <HI>And the Lord &s;aid unto him, Go through the mid&s;t of the City, through the mid&s;t of Jeru&s;alem, and &s;et a
<PB N="20" REF="004597_0024_100DA8F4BA100F38">
Mark upon the Foreheads of the Men that &s;igh and that cry for all the Abominations that be done in the mid&s;t thereof. And to the others he &s;aid in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the City and &s;mite: let not your Eye &s;pare, neither have ye Pity,</HI> Ezek 9.4, 5.</P>
<P>But the Time would fail me, &s;hould I attempt to &s;peak particularly to this <HI>Head;</HI> and I have in part prevented my &s;elf by what has been al|ready &s;aid. I &s;hall therefore only give a few Hints further to confirm &amp; illu&s;trate the Truth before us. The faithful and true GOD <HI>decla|reth this in His Word. When I &s;ay unto the Wicked, Thou &s;halt &s;urely die: If he turn from his &s;in, and do that which is lawful and right; If the Wicked re&s;tore the Pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the Statutes of Life, without committing Iniquity; he &s;hall &s;urely live, he &s;hall not die,</HI> Ezek 33.14, 15. When <HI>Ephraim</HI> bemoan'd him&s;elf and repented, GOD manife&s;ted his fatherly Compa&s;&s;ions to him. <HI>I have &s;urely heard Ephraim bemoaning him&s;elf thus, Thou ha&s;t cha&s;ti&s;ed me, and I was cha&s;ti&s;ed, as a Bullock unaccu&s;tomed to the Yoke: Turn thou me, and I &s;hall be turned; for thou art the Lord my God. Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was in&s;tructed, I &s;mote upon my thigh: I was a&s;hamed, yea, even confounded, becau&s;e I did bear the reproach of my Youth. Is Ephraim my dear Son? Is he a plea&s;ant Child? For &s;ince I &s;pake again&s;t him, I do earne&s;tly remember him &s;till: Therefore my Bow|els are troubled for him; I will &s;urely have mercy upon him, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> Jer. 31.18,&mdash;20. Again, When a People do thus turn from their evil Way to the Lord, <HI>They are prepar'd to receive and improve GOD's merciful Deliverance after a &s;uitable manner.</HI> While a degenerate People are impe|nitent
<PB N="21" REF="004597_0025_100DA8F6CDAC0FA0">
they will be ready to de&s;pi&s;e the Riches of GOD's Goodne&s;s and Forbearance, and to wax Wanton under &s;paring Mercy. <HI>Je&s;hurun waxed fat and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatne&s;s; then he for&s;ook God which made him, and light|ly e&s;teemed the Rock of his Salvation,</HI> Deut. 32.15. But when Sin is embitter'd by the god|ly Sorrow which worketh Repentance we &s;hall ob&s;erve that Caution after GOD has &s;poken Peace, P&s;al. 84.8.&mdash;<HI>Let them not turn again to Folly.</HI> Such a People will be jealous over them|&s;elves and for the Lord of ho&s;ts, and be con|cern'd to improve all His gracious Appearances for them to the Honour of his great Name. Accordingly, GOD &s;ays of his People, How &s;hall I put thee among the Children, and give thee a plea&s;ant Land? And then returns this An&s;wer, <HI>Thou &s;halt call me, My Father, and &s;halt not turn away from me,</HI> Jer. 3.19. Again, This Truth is evident <HI>from the happy Experience of the Penitent.</HI> We have a remarkable In&s;tance before us. Now, did GOD &s;pare repenting <HI>Nineveh,</HI> and will he not &s;pare his repenting Covenant-People? Yes &s;urely, &mdash; <HI>If their uncircumci&s;ed Hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the puni&s;h|ment of their Iniquity: Then will I remember my Covenant with Jacob, and al&s;o my Covenant with I&s;aac, and al&s;o my Covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the Land.</HI> And GOD was pleas'd to fulfill his Promi&s;e to his People, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 7. and in other In&s;tances upon Record in Scripture. In a Word, The Lord JESUS our great High Prie&s;t, has offered a Sacrifice of in|finite Value to make Atonement for the Con|gregation of his People, whether Jews or Gen|tiles; and He lives in Heaven to interceed

<P N="2">USE 2. <HI>Abounding Iniquity will be the De|&s;truction of a People, except they repent.</HI> If they per&s;i&s;t and go on in the Ways of Sin, refu&s;ing to return to GOD, Iniquity will be their Ruin. <HI>Sin is the Reproach of any People,</HI> Prov. 14.34. It hath both a natural and moral tendency to lay them low, and expo&s;e them to Shame. Sin in the <HI>Body-politick,</HI> is like &s;ome foul and deadly Di&s;ea&s;e in the <HI>natural Body</HI> which turns the Beauty of it into Corruption, and weakens all it's Powers. <HI>Why &s;hould ye be &s;tricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole Head is &s;ick, and the whole Heart is faint. From the Sole of the Foot, even unto the Crown of the Head, there is no Soundne&s;s in it; but Wounds and Brui&s;es, and putrifying Sores: they have not been clo&s;ed, neither bound up, neither molified with Ointment,</HI> I&s;a. 1.5, 6. And then, this deadly Evil provokes the holy GOD to pour Contempt upon a People, and lay their Honour in the Du&s;t. Thus GOD threat|ned His People, <HI>Thou &s;halt become an A&s;toni&s;hment, a Proverb, and a By-word, among all Nations whi|ther the Lord &s;hall lead thee.</HI> Deut. 28.37. And in the 44th and 45th <HI>v. He &s;hall lend to thee, and thou &s;halt not lend to him; he &s;hall be the Head, and thou &s;halt be the Tail. Moreover all the&s;e Cur&s;es &s;hall come upon thee, and overtake thee till thou be de&s;troy|ed Becau&s;e thou hearkned&s;t not unto the Voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his Commandments and his Statutes which he commanded thee.</HI> And the threat|ning

was fulfilled upon them. GOD &s;aid to his People, O <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> Thou ha&s;t fallen by thine Iniquity. And the weeping Prophet laments their Sin and Ruin, <HI>Jeru&s;alem hath grievou&s;ly &s;inned: all that honoured her, de&s;pi&s;e her, becau&s;e they have &s;een her nakedne&s;s: yea, &s;he &s;igheth, and turneth backward. Her filthine&s;s is in her skirts, &s;he remembreth not her la&s;t end, therefore &s;he came down wonderfully: &s;he had no Comforter.</HI> Yea, After this remarkable Deliverance granted to <HI>Nineveh,</HI> it's &s;uppos'd about <HI>Ninety</HI> Years, when they returned to their former Sins, the Pro|phet <HI>Nahum</HI> foretells their Ruin, <HI>Chap.</HI> 1.</P>

<P>GOD &s;peaks to us this Day as to his People of old, <HI>Thine own wickedne&s;s &s;hall correct thee, and thy Back&s;lidings &s;hall reprove thee: know therefore and &s;ee, that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou ha&s;t for&s;aken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, &s;aith the Lord God of ho&s;ts,</HI> Jer. 2.19. And as 44.4. <HI>O do not this abominable thing that I hate.</HI> Mo&s;t certainly they are guilty of great Folly, who make a Mock at Sin. This is to ca&s;t Fire-Brands, Arrows and Death; and &s;ay, Am I not &s;port? The wi&s;e Man ob&s;erves, that <HI>One Sinner de&s;troyeth much Good,</HI> Eccl. 9.18. Thus <HI>Achan took of the accur&s;ed Thing; and the Anger of the Lord was kindled again&s;t the Children of I&s;rael,</HI> Jo&s;h. 7.1. Let us then fly from Sin as the mo&s;t pernicious Evil, and &s;ee the Nece&s;&s;ity of our turning to the Lord by &s;incere Repentance.

<P N="4">4. Let us all be Exhorted <HI>to turn, every One from his evil Way; and to engage heartily in the nece&s;&s;ary Work of Reformation.</HI></P>
<P>This, This is our great Duty and Intere&s;t this Day, as we would hope to be made In|&s;truments in GOD's Hand of &s;aving our &s;elves and this People. Let us then &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider that we have to do with that GOD who is able to &s;ave and to de&s;troy. And &s;ettle that Word in our Hearts as a certain Truth, <HI>When he gi|veth Quietne&s;s, who then can make Trouble? and when he hideth his Face, who then can behold him? whether it be done again&s;t a Nation, or again&s;t a Man only.</HI> Job 34.29. And accordingly, let us turn from all Sin to the Lord, and in this Way hope and wait for his Salvation. O let us take heed, le&s;t there be in any of us <HI>an evil Heart of Unbelief in departing from the living God.</HI> To Day, let us hear his Voice, and not harden our Hearts. May each one of us &s;ay with <HI>Job, Now mine Eye &s;eeth thee: Wherefore I abhor my &s;elf, and repent in Du&s;t and A&s;hes.</HI> And as it has plea&s;ed the Father to commit all Judgment to the Son; let us look to Him, and encourage our &s;elves in Him whom GOD hath exalted to be <HI>a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance to I&s;rael, and Forgivene&s;s of Sins.</HI> May our a&s;cended JESUS, who has receiv'd of the Father the Promi&s;e of the Holy Gho&s;t, pour out this great Ble&s;&s;ing upon the whole Land, and fulfill that Word, <HI>Then will I &s;prinkle clean Water upon you, and ye &s;hall be clean: from all your filthine&s;s and from all your Idols will</HI> I <HI>clean&s;e you. A new Heart al&s;o will</HI> I <HI>give you, and a new Spirit will</HI> I <HI>put within you, and</HI> I <HI>will take away the &s;tony Heart out of your Fle&s;h, and</HI> I <HI>will give you an Heart of Fle&s;h.

put my Spirit within you, and cau&s;e you to walk in my Statutes, and ye &s;hall keep my Judgments, and do them. And ye &s;hall dwell in the Land that</HI> I <HI>gave to your Fathers, and ye &s;hall be my People, and</HI> I <HI>will be your God.</HI> Ezek. 36.25 &mdash; 28. Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, His Spirit has been, we hope, moving on the Hearts of many to convince and awaken them. O let us not re&s;i&s;t and quench the Spirit! le&s;t the Threatning denounc'd again&s;t the Sin|ners of the old World, &s;hould be fulfill'd on us, <HI>My Spirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with Man, for that he al&s;o is Fle&s;h.</HI> Gen 6.3. Let us cheri&s;h his Motions, and pray the more earne&s;tly that he may be given in an exten&s;ive manner as a Spirit of &s;aving Conver&s;ion and thorow Refor|mation. And &s;urely, If we duely con&s;ider the State of this &s;inful, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed People, we &s;hall be con&s;train'd to &s;ay with the Prophet. <HI>It is Time to &s;eek the Lord, till he come and rain Righteou&s;ne&s;s upon you.</HI> Ho&s;. 10.12. And then with our fer|vent Prayers, let us unite our be&s;t Endeavours with regard to our&s;elves, our Families, and this People; that all Iniquity may be put far from us, and that we may become zealous of good Works. In this Way we might hope GOD would &s;ay of us as of the Remnant of <HI>Judah; Then will</HI> I <HI>build you, and not pull you down, and</HI> I <HI>will plant you, and not pluck you up: for</HI> I <HI>repent me of the evil that</HI> I <HI>have done unto you.</HI> Or as I&s;a. 65.8.&mdash;<HI>De&s;troy it not, for a Ble&s;&s;ing is in it.</HI></P>

<P><HI>My Fathers!</HI> Suffer the Word of Exhortation: Let GOD &s;ee your Works, that you turn from every evil Way; that GOD may al&s;o repent of the Evil, and not bring it upon us. For how dreadful mu&s;t it be if the Example of the Nobles and Men of <HI>Nineveh</HI> &s;hould ri&s;e up in Judgment again&s;t any of you: They repented at the Prea|ching "of <HI>one Prophet</HI> &s;ent to them by GOD, you have <HI>Mo&s;es and the Prophets</HI>"; Yea in the&s;e la&s;t Days GOD has &s;poken to us by <HI>his Son</HI> that Prince of the Prophets, who is GOD manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h. You have the &s;acred Writings of the <HI>New-Te&s;tament,</HI> in which GOD reveals his Wrath again&s;t all Ungodline&s;s and Unrighte|ou&s;ne&s;s of Men; and al&s;o his Grace and Mercy to the Penitent by a Redeemer: And as the Judge of all the Earth hath advanced you to rule over his People; &s;o he declareth to you in his Word, That <HI>they who rule over Men mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling is the Fear of GOD;</HI> and requireth you to lead in the Work of Reformation by your Ex|ample, and by the right U&s;e of that Power with which He hath betru&s;ted you.</P>
