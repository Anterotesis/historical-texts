NUMEROUS as the de&s;criptions are of primeval man, the reflective eye is not yet weary. We &s;till feel an intere&s;t in that Arcadian &s;tate which &s;o well imitated the world we are looking for. And we &s;hall continue to feel it &s;o long as Nature is plea&s;ing and the heart retains a feature of innocence. Like the gods,

Their pa&s;&s;ions were as the gales of their own Eden&mdash;enough to give a &s;pring to <HI>good</HI> actions&mdash;to keep the waters of life in motion without inducing &s;torm and whirlwind.
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The pa&s;&s;ions of every kind, under proper re&s;traints, are the gentle breezes which keep life from &s;tagnation; but, let loo&s;e, they are the &s;torms and whirlwinds which tear up all before them.

Bollan.</NOTE> When families and con&s;equently human wants were afterward multiplied, it was this &s;ame Liberty who, joined with Ju&s;tice, led the patriarchs to &s;ome aged oak. There in the copious &s;hade mi&s;under&s;tandings were explained and charity and peace ki&s;&s;ed each other. Such was the morning of man.</P>
<P>BUT mi&s;under&s;tandings are quarrels in embrio. Satisfaction of one want originated another. Depravity grew enraptured with &s;trife. The wind was up. Pa&s;&s;ion raged. Brother's blood then &s;moak'd from the ground and cried for vengeance. Nimrod commenced his prelude to tyranny, and Fame was clamorous with the deeds of death. Liberty heared and trembled&mdash;con&s;idered her&s;elf an outca&s;t and has on many times &s;ince travelled up and down the world, forlorn, for|&s;aken, maje&s;ty in rags. Nor will She, perhaps, until the millenium comes, if America does not now retain her, ever command that complete and permanent homage which is &s;uit|able to her nature. The old republics may have been the mo&s;t perfect &s;eats of her re&s;idence while they la&s;ted, and are often mu&s;tered up from the tomb of empire to witne&s;s the adoration which they paid her. But even there &s;he received &s;o frequent violence that the continuance of her reign was for the mo&s;t part precarious; and when even at the &s;ummit of her glory, &s;he was only elevated that her fall might be more a&s;toni&s;hing.

O cheri&s;h the divine inhabitant! O let her not return to the courts above with a &s;tory that &s;hall fire the heavens again&s;t us&mdash;that <HI>She</HI> had ble&s;&s;ings for us; but that <HI>we</HI> were not pre|pared to receive them&mdash;that She could find among us no la&s;ting habitation; but that, like the dove after the deluge, She was &s;carce favoured with the top of &s;ome friendly mountain for a melancholy moment.</P>
<P>LIBERTY, my friends! is a palladium to the place of her dwelling, a rock and a &s;ure defence. Wherever She is, every man has &s;omething to protect. He knows what are his riches, and that while he liveth him&s;elf &s;hall gather them. He views with con&s;cious joy his circum&s;tance. His &s;ocial affections &s;hoot out and flouri&s;h. Even his prejudices are a &s;ource of &s;atisfaction, and among them local attachment, a fault which leans to the &s;ide of patrioti&s;m.

<P>SUPPORTED by and tenacious of the&s;e fruits of Liberty, &s;ome little free &s;tates, which the geographer in his map had <HI>otherways</HI> never noticed, have long &s;tood uninjured by change and &s;ome of them inacce&s;&s;ible by the greate&s;t efforts of Power. There is now in a di&s;tant quarter of the globe a living illu&s;tration of this remark. Situate upon a venerable pile of
<PB N="9" REF="017132_0008_0FA031D3FA1E0570">rocks in Italy &s;tands the Commonwealth of St. Matino. It was founded by a holy man who&s;e name it bears, and who fled to this romantick fairy-land to enjoy religion and free air, unpur&s;ued by power and the re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit of the world. His example was followed by the pious, the humane and the lovers of freedom. And the&s;e, a favorite few, who were before &s;cattered up and down thro' other parts of Italy; who had lived all their days under arbitrary rule and whom Nature had &s;ecretly taught that there was &s;omewhere a happier in&s;titution for man&mdash;the&s;e hurried away to the &s;nowy top of St. Marino: And having there fir&s;t ta&s;ted tho&s;e rights which come down from GOD, made it their <HI>life's labor</HI> to &s;upport and hand them down in purity. There every man finds his pro&s;perity in &s;ubmitting to tho&s;e laws which diffu&s;e equality. There every man feels him&s;elf happily liable to be called to the &s;enate or the field: every man divides his day between alternate labor and the u&s;e of arms&mdash;on tip-toe, ready to &s;tart for the prize, the mark of univer&s;al emulation&mdash;the Common-Weal; officious to promote that intere&s;t which is at once the publick's and his own. So &s;tands a con&s;titution informed with the very e&s;&s;ence of Liberty. It has &s;o &s;tood, while other neighbouring &s;tates have been blackened and defaced with frequent revolution. And we prophe&s;y that 'till the approach of &s;ome unfore&s;een vice&mdash;'till &s;ome degeneracy unknown to the &s;ires creep upon the &s;ons, St. Marino mu&s;t &s;tand admired: as, in its pre&s;ent circum&s;tance, no prince or potentate, after
<PB N="10" REF="017132_0009_0FA031D4DF8B64C8">&s;itting down and counting the co&s;t, will ever attempt the im|penetrable union of &s;o much prudence and virtue.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many of the facts here mentioned of St. Marino may be &s;een in Addi&s;on's more complete account of that republick.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE name of Venice now occurs to memory as another modern example of genuine greatne&s;s. The a&s;cendency gained by that &s;ingle city over the whole Ottoman power&mdash;the uni|ver&s;al panic that &s;truck and pervaded all orders of the Turks when routed at the Dardanelles, and the <HI>rea&s;onable fear</HI> of approaching di&s;&s;olution that reached even to the throne and bla&s;ted the heart and withered the nerves of a de&s;pot: The&s;e, amazing at fir&s;t, neverthele&s;s appear, when their &s;prings are laid open, the natural i&s;&s;ues of a conte&s;t between free agents and &s;laves.
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This alludes only to a particular aera in the Venetian hi&s;tory.</NOTE></P>
<P>A more ancient and perhaps &s;till more brilliant proof of the proportionate powers of different degrees of Liberty may be gathered from the annals of the city of Tyre. The Lybian madman

<P>I had cheri&s;hed &s;ome aver&s;ion to names grown trite by repe|tition, and had, on that account, evaded the ancient republicks. But I find the ob&s;ervation ju&s;t that "half our learning is their epitaph." I conceive that the "mo&s;s-grown" columns and broken arches of tho&s;e once renowned empires are full with in&s;truc|tion as were the groves of Lyc&egrave;um or the &s;chool of Plato. Let Greece then be the &s;ubject of a moment's reflection. When Liberty fled from the gloom of Egypt, &s;he &s;ought out and &s;ettled at infant Greece&mdash;there di&s;&s;eminated the &s;eeds of greatne&s;s; there laid the ground-work of Republican glory. Simplicity of manners, piety to the gods, genero&s;ity and cou|rage were her earlie&s;t character. "Human nature &s;hot wild and free."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From Dr. Blair's di&s;&s;ertation upon the works of O&s;&s;ian.</NOTE> Penetrated with a &s;pirit of indu&s;try, her &s;ons &s;carcely knew of relaxation: even their &s;ports were heroic. Hence that elevated, independent &s;oul, that contempt of danger, that laudable bya&s;s to their country and its manners. Upon the banks of Eurota flouri&s;hed her principal &s;tate. Frugality of living and an avarice of time were of the riches of Lacedae|mon. Her maxims were drawn from Nature, and one was "that nothing which bore the name of Greek was born for &s;lavery." From this idea flowed an a&s;&s;i&s;tance to her &s;i&s;ter &s;tates.
<PB N="13" REF="017132_0012_0FA031D70F4C65A8">From a like idea in her &s;i&s;ter &s;tates that friend&s;hip was returned in grateful mea&s;ure. This, had it continued, would have formed the link of empire, the charm that would have united and made Greece invulnerable. While it la&s;ted, the joint efforts of her &s;tates rendered her a name and a prai&s;e through the whole earth. And here, was it not for the &s;ake of a le&s;&s;on to my country, I would not only drop my elogium of Greece, but draw an impervious veil over her remaining hi&s;tory.

But attention to the hi&s;tory of Greece will di&s;cover in the cau&s;es of her fall a le&s;&s;on &s;ufficiently appo&s;ite to our purpo&s;e. The anonimous tran&s;lator of Tourreil writes as follows&mdash; "When Per&s;ia, &s;o often vanqui&s;hed by <HI>the Grecians,</HI> de&s;paired of &s;ubduing them, her la&s;t &s;hift was to divide 'em; to which their pro&s;perity opened her a means.

<PB N="14" REF="017132_0013_0FA031D7A91CEAE8">the con&s;equence! The fury of civil-war blows her accur&s;ed clarion. The banners <HI>late</HI> of conquering Freedom now adorn the triumphs of Oppre&s;&s;ion. Tho&s;e &s;tates which lately &s;tood in mighty concert, invincible, now breath mutual jealou&s;y and fall piece meal a prey to the common enemy. Attic wi&s;dom, Theban hardihood, Spartan valor, would not combine to &s;ave her. That very army, which Greece had bred and nouri&s;hed to reduce the Oriental pride, is turned vulture upon her own vitals&mdash;a damnable parricide, the &s;anction of a Tyrant. Behold the great and god|like Greece, with all her battlements and towers about her&mdash; borne headlong from her giddy height&mdash;the &s;hame, the pity of the world.</P>
<P>HAVING attempted &s;ome general &s;ketches of Liberty from the dawn of &s;ocial life, to the fall of national glory; I would be &s;omewhat more particular upon tho&s;e qualities to which her triumphs are chiefly indebted.</P>
<P>IN the vile oeconomy of depraved man there appears an inclination to be&s;tow upon one part power and affluence, and to impo&s;e upon the other debility and woe. When that inclination is gratified, the majority being &s;laves, the remains of freedom are &s;hared among the great; like the triumphal bridge at the Archipelago, &s;o &s;trangely dignified that, by a decree of &s;enate, none of the vulgar were &s;uffered to enjoy it.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Earl of Abingdon.</NOTE> &mdash;and the governed find their happine&s;s in their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion&mdash; there is the e&s;&s;ence of all-powerful Liberty. Not to wire-draw a &s;entiment already graven upon the hearts of this audience, it is &s;uch a Liberty, as that every man who has once ta&s;ted it, becomes a temporary &s;oldier as &s;oon as it is invaded and re&s;ents any violence offered it, as an attack upon his life&mdash;Hence it is that in free &s;tates <HI>as &s;uch</HI> there is no &s;uch thing as a perpetual &s;tanding army. For the whole body of the people, ever ready, flock to the general &s;tandard upon emergency, and &s;o preclude the u&s;e of that infernal engine. I &s;ay <HI>infernal</HI> engine, for the tongue "<HI>labors,</HI> and is at a lo&s;s to expre&s;s," the hideous and frightful con&s;equences that flow wherever the powers of hell have procured its introduction. Turkey and Algiers are the delight of its vengeance. Denmark, once over-&s;warmed with the brave inhabitants of the North, has &s;uffered depopulation poverty and the heavie&s;t bondage, from the quartering troops among&s;t their pea&s;ants in time of peace: <HI>if it can be called peace,</HI> when robbery, conflagration and murder are let loo&s;e upon the &s;ons of men. Indeed, it is &s;aid that no nation ever kept up an army in time of peace that did not loo&s;e its liberties. I believe it. Athens, Corinth, Syracu&s;e and Greece in general were all overturned by that tremendous power: and the &s;ame power has been long operating with other cau&s;es to humble the cre&s;t of Britain. Let us hear a pa&s;&s;age from Davenant! "If (&s;ays he, &s;peaking of &s;tanding armies) if they who believed this
<PB N="16" REF="017132_0015_0FA031D957808A60">eagle in the air frighted all motions towards Liberty; if they who heretofore tho't armies in time of peace and our freedom incon&s;i&s;tent; if the &s;ame men &s;hould throw off a whig principle &s;o fundamental, and thus come to clothe them&s;elves with the dete&s;ted garments of the tories, and if all that has been here di&s;cour&s;ed on &s;hould happen, then will the con&s;titution of this Country be utterly &s;ubverted."

<P>THAT &s;tanding mercenary troops mu&s;t &s;ooner or later entail &s;ervitude and mi&s;ery upon their employers is an eternal truth that appears from the nature of things. On the one hand behold an in&s;pired yeomanry, all &s;inew and &s;oul, having &s;tep'd out and defended their ancient altars, their wives and children,

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"That the yeomanry are the bulwark of a free people"&mdash;was, if memory &s;erves, in a celebrated extempore &s;peech of the honorable Samuel Adams, made in the year 1773. The &s;teadine&s;s of that great Republican to his political creed, evinces that &s;entiments grounded upon ju&s;t data will not ea&s;ily bend to a partical intere&s;t, or accom|modate to the changes of popular opinion.</NOTE> Such were the troops who, led on by the patriot Warren, gave the fir&s;t home-blow to our oppre&s;&s;ors. Such were the troops who, fired by Gates in the northern woods, almo&s;t decided the fate of Nations. Such were the troops who, under the great and amiable Lincoln, &s;u&s;tained a &s;iege in cir|cum&s;tances that rank him and them with the captains and &s;oldiers of antiquity. Such, we tru&s;t, are the troops, who, inferior number, though headed indeed by the gallant and judicious Morgan, lately vanqui&s;hed a cho&s;en veteran band long dedicated to Mars and di&s;ciplined in blood. And &s;uch, we doubt not, are the troops who beat the Briti&s;h Legions from the Jer&s;ies and have ever &s;ince pre&s;erved their country, under the conduct of that &s;uperior man who combines in quality the un&s;haken con&s;tancy of Cato, the triumphant delay of Fabius, and, <HI>upon proper occa&s;ions,</HI> the enterprizing &s;pirit of Hannibal.</P>

<P>WHITHER has our gratitude borne us? Let us behold a contra&s;t&mdash;the army of an ab&s;olute prince&mdash;a profe&s;&s;ion di&s;tinct from the citizen and in a different intere&s;t&mdash;a haughty phalanx, who&s;e object of warfare is pay, and who, the battle over, and if perchance they conquer, return to &s;laughter the &s;ons of peace. This is a hard &s;aying. But does not all hi&s;tory pre&s;s forward to a&s;&s;ert it's ju&s;tice? Do not the praetorian bands of tottering Rome now crowd upon the affrighted memory? Do not the embodied guards from Peter&s;burgh and Con&s;tantinople &s;talk horrid, the tools of revolution and murder?

I mean upon that unnatural night which we now commemorate; when the fire of Brutus was on many a heart&mdash;when the &s;train of Gracchus was on many a tongue. "Wretch that I am, whither &s;hall I retreat? Whither &s;hall I turn me? To the Capitol? The Capitol &s;wims in my brother's blood. To my family?

<PB N="20" REF="017132_0019_0FA030D2E67C0918">Even now in the hollow wind I hear the voice of the departed. <HI>O ye, who li&s;ten to wi&s;dom and a&s;pire to immortality, as ye have avenged our blood, thrice ble&s;&s;ed!

<P>Such are the &s;ugge&s;tions of fancy: And having given them their due &s;cope; having de&s;cribed the memorable 5th of March as a &s;ea&s;on of di&s;a&s;ter; it would be an impiety not to con&s;ider it in its other relation. For the ri&s;ing honors of the&s;e States are di&s;tant i&s;&s;ues, as it were, from the intricate

Strike that night out of Time, and we quench the fir&s;t ardor of a re&s;entment which has been ever &s;ince increa&s;ing and now accelerates the fall of Tyranny. The provocations of that night mu&s;t be numbered among the ma&s;ter-&s;prings which gave the fir&s;t motion to a va&s;t machinery, a noble and comprehen&s;ive &s;y&s;tem of national Independence. "The Independence of America, &s;ays the writer under the &s;igna|ture of Common Sen&s;e, &s;hould have been con&s;idered as dating it's Aera from the fir&s;t mu&s;quet that was fired again&s;t her." Be it &s;o! But Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts may certainly date many of it's ble&s;&s;ings from the Bo&s;ton Ma&s;&s;acre&mdash;a dark hour in it&s;elf, but from which a marvellous light has ari&s;en. From that night Revolu|tion became inevitable and the occa&s;ion commenced of the pre&s;ent mo&s;t beautiful form of Government. We often read of the original Contract, and of mankind, in the early ages,
<PB N="21" REF="017132_0020_0FA030D36D4F8490">pa&s;&s;ing from a &s;tate of Nature to immediate Civililization. But <HI>what eye</HI> could penetrate through gothic night and barbarous fable to that remote period. Such an eye, perhaps, was pre&s;ent, when the Deity conceived the Univer&s;e and fixed his compa&s;s upon the great deep.
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Not</HI> that we can believe, <HI>with &s;ome theoretical writers,</HI> that individuals met together in a large plain, entered into an <HI>original Contract,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;</P>

<P>And this is what we mean by the original Contract of Society; which, though perhaps <HI>in no in&s;tance</HI> it has been <HI>formally expre&s;&s;ed,</HI> at the fir&s;t in&s;titution of a State, yet, &amp;c.&mdash; 1&s;t Black&s;tone's Com. p. 47 vid. the whole pa&s;&s;age.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>AND yet the people of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts have reduced to practice the wonderful theory. A numerous people have convened in a &s;tate of Nature, and, like <HI>our ideas</HI> of the patriarchs, have deputed a few fathers of the land to draw up for them a glorious covenant. It has been drawn. The people have &s;igned it with rapture, and have thereby bartered among them&s;elves an ea&s;y degree of obedience for the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible civil happine&s;s. To render that covenant eternal, patrioti&s;m and political virtue mu&s;t forever blaze&mdash;mu&s;t blaze at the <HI>pre&s;ent day</HI> with &s;uperlative lu&s;tre; being watch'd, from <HI>different motives,</HI> by the eyes of all mankind. Nor mu&s;t that patrioti&s;m be contracted to a &s;ingle Commonwealth. A combination of the States is requi&s;ite to &s;upport them individually. "Unite or die" is our indi&s;pen&s;able motto. Every &s;tep from it is a &s;tep nearer
<PB N="22" REF="017132_0021_0FA030D4B792DA38">to the region of Death. This idea was never more occa&s;ional than at the pre&s;ent cri&s;is&mdash;a cri&s;is pregnant with Fate and ready to bur&s;t with calamity. I aliude to that languor which, like a low hung cloud, over&s;hadows a great part of the thirteen States. That the young, enterprizing America, who &s;tep'd out in the cau&s;e of humankind and, no other arm daring, lop'd the branches of wide de&s;potic Empire&mdash;that the &s;ame America &s;hould now &s;uffer a few in&s;olent bands to ravage her borders with impunity&mdash;that her <HI>now tardy</HI> hand &s;hould &s;u&s;pend the fini&s;hing &s;troke of re&s;entment, and leave to her <HI>generous allies</HI> a labor which her own vigor ought to effect&mdash;this mu&s;t di&s;turb tho&s;e, illu&s;trious, who fell in her infant exertions&mdash;this mu&s;t &s;tab the peace of the dead, however it may affect the hearts of the living. Oh could I bear a part among the means of awakening virtue&mdash;Oh could I call &s;trength to the&s;e feeble lungs and borrow that note which &s;hook the throne of Julius! Vain wi&s;h! If the &s;ilent &s;ugge&s;tions of truth&mdash;if the &s;ecret whi&s;pers of rea&s;on are not &s;ufficient&mdash;the efforts of human eloquence might be <HI>futile,</HI> her loude&s;t bolt might roll <HI>unheeded!</HI></P>
<P>THIS is not intended to in&s;pire gloom; but only to per&s;uade to tho&s;e exertions which are nece&s;&s;ary to life and independence. Let ju&s;tice then be done to our country&mdash;Let ju&s;tice be done to our great leader; and, the only means under heaven of our &s;alvation, let his army be repleni&s;hed.
