<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Kingdom of Chri&s;t is a &s;ubject of great importance: for, accord|ing to the views we have of that king|dom will our conclu&s;ions be, re&s;pecting various branches of religious conduct. If tho&s;e views be imaginary, the&s;e con|clu&s;ions mu&s;t be fal&s;e. By the former, the glory of Me&s;&s;iah's regal character will be ob&s;cured: by the latter, his wor&s;hip will be corrupted: whereas the true doctrine concerning this holy empire, may not only be the mean of pre&s;erving from tho&s;e evils, but of pre|&s;enting us with <HI>data</HI> for the deci&s;ion of many di&s;putes among the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity. A competent acquaint|ance, therefore, with its nature and laws, its emoluments and honors, is clo&s;ely connected with our duty and our happine&s;s: which acquaintance mu&s;t be derived from divine Revelation.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="023213_0003_0FBEDC4624963218">
Important, however, as the &s;ubject manife&s;tly is, it has been but &s;eldom pro|fe&s;&s;edly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. This con&s;ideration was a leading motive to the pre&s;ent at|tempt. To illu&s;trate the nature of our Lord's Kingdom, and to infer the con|clu&s;ions flowing from it, con&s;titute the de&s;ign of this E&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>The author has expre&s;&s;ed his thoughts with great freedom; yet without in|tending the lea&s;t offence to any party of Chri&s;tians, or to any per&s;on, from who&s;e notions and practices he con&s;cientiou&s;ly differs. In the cour&s;e of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion he animadverts, indeed, on &s;ome particu|lars, with a degree of &s;everity: but then they appear to him in the light of <HI>political artifices,</HI> which either impeach the dominion of Chri&s;t in his own king|dom; or degrade and corrupt that wor&s;hip which he requires. Now, in ca&s;es of this kind, the writer is of opini|on, that allegiance to the King Me&s;&s;iah,
<PB N="v" REF="023213_0004_0FBEDC4818055E48">and true benevolence to man, demand the language of marked oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Such is the nature of our Lord's em|pire, that few of his loyal &s;ubjects can &s;eriou&s;ly reflect upon it, without feel|ing them&s;elves both delighted and re|proved. <HI>Delighted;</HI> becau&s;e it is for the honor of their Mediator, to be the Sovereign of a &s;piritual monarchy. A character of this kind apparently &s;uits the dignity of his Per&s;on, the de&s;ign of his mediation, and the riches of his grace.&mdash;<HI>Reproved;</HI> becau&s;e they daily find a want of that &s;pirituality in their affections, and of that heavenly mind|edne&s;s, which become the profe&s;&s;ed &s;ubjects of &s;uch a kingdom. When meditating on the characteri&s;tics of this holy empire, they &s;tand convicted be|fore its divine Sovereign of much car|nality and worldly mindedne&s;s, over which they &s;incerely mourn: while
<PB N="vi" REF="023213_0005_0FBEDC49987CEBC0">merely nominal &s;ubjects of the King Me&s;&s;iah, or &s;uperficial profe&s;&s;ors of the gracious go&s;pel, are but little concern|ed about the &s;tate of their hearts, in re|ference to heaven; or with regard to the &s;pirituality of their wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>This being the ca&s;e with multitudes, the author would not be much &s;urpri|&s;ed, were various particulars in the fol|lowing pages to prove di&s;gu&s;ting to the ta&s;te of numbers profe&s;&s;ing godline&s;s. But facts are &s;tubborn things; and the &s;ayings of Je&s;us Chri&s;t mu&s;t not be ex|plained away, that con&s;cience may re&s;t in a fal&s;e peace, or that the public ta&s;te may be gratified<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LUTHER &s;ays, Potius quam aliquid Regno Chri&s;ti et Gloriae ejus decedat, ruat non &s;olum pax &s;ed coelum et terra. <HI>Loci Commun.</HI> Cla&s;&s; iv. p 35.</NOTE> For, when thinking of our Sublime Sovereign, THY KING|DOM COME, is the language of every up|right heart, let carnal profe&s;&s;ors and the profligate world &s;ay what they plea&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P>IT having been revealed by ancient Prophets, that the Lord Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould be a King, and have univer&s;al empire, the cho&s;en tribes in every age expected his appearance under the regal character. While, however, the ge|neral idea of that expectation was fully warranted by the Spirit of prophecy, the bulk of Abraham's natural po&s;terity were under a gro&s;s mi&s;take, re&s;pecting the true de&s;ign of their Me&s;&s;iah's ap|pearance, and the real nature of his kingdom: which mi&s;take had the mo&s;t pernicious influence upon their temper and conduct, when the gracious pro|mi&s;e of his coming was fulfilled.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e which they affixed to pro|phecies re&s;pecting the great Redeemer, was manife&s;tly &s;uch as flattered their pride and fo&s;tered their carnality. This gave it a decided advantage, in their
<PB N="8" REF="023213_0007_0FBEDC53F4891CA8">e&s;timation, over that for which our Lord and his Apo&s;tles contended; and led them to overlook whatever in the ancient Oracles oppo&s;ed their &s;ecular views. Ignorant of their &s;piritual wants, and flu&s;hed with a fal&s;e per&s;ua|&s;ion of intere&s;t in Jehovah's peculiar fa|vor, on the ground of carnal de&s;cent from Abraham, and of the Covenant made at Horeb; the doctrine, example, and claims of Chri&s;t, were extremely of|fen&s;ive. Not appearing as a temporal prince, di&s;covering no di&s;po&s;ition to free them from the Roman yoke, and frequently addre&s;&s;ing their con&s;ciences with keen reproof, on account of their pride and hypocri&s;y, &s;uper&s;tition and covetou&s;ne&s;s; they rejected with de|termined oppo&s;ition all the evidences of his divine mi&s;&s;ion, treated him as an im|po&s;tor, and procured his crucifixion.&mdash;After he was ri&s;en from the dead, and a&s;cended to heaven, multitudes of them indeed believed, and profe&s;&s;ed the Chri&s;tian faith: but a great majority of the nation continued in hardened im|penitence, and per&s;ecuted the Apo&s;tles with unrelenting malevolence. Thus they proceeded till, divine forbearance being exhau&s;ted, <HI>wrath came upon them to the uttermo&s;t,</HI> in the total &s;ubver&s;ion of their civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="023213_0008_0FBEDC54DCE93AD8">
This mi&s;take of the Jews, re&s;pecting the kingdom of their Me&s;&s;iah, lying at the foundation of all the oppo&s;ition with which they treated him, and of their own ruin; it behoves us to guard with diligence again&s;t every thing which tends to &s;ecularize the dominion of Chri&s;t: le&s;t, by corrupting the Go&s;|pel Oeconomy, we di&s;honor the Lord Redeemer, and be finally puni&s;hed as the enemies of his government. Our danger of contracting guilt, and of in|curring divine &s;entiment in this way, is far from &s;mall. For we are &s;o con|ver&s;ant with &s;en&s;ible objects, and &s;o de|lighted with exterior &s;how, that we are naturally inclined to wi&s;h for &s;omething in the religion of Je&s;us, to gratify our carnality. Under the influence of that ma&s;ter prejudice, <HI>the expectation of a temporal kingdom,</HI> Jewi&s;h depravity re|jected Chri&s;t; and our corruption, if we be not watchful, may &s;o mi&s;repre|&s;ent his empire, and oppo&s;e his royal prerogatives, as implicitly to &s;ay, <HI>We will not have him to rule over us.</HI></P>
<P>Among the numerous admirable &s;ay|ings of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and of his Apo&s;tles, that &s;tand recorded in the New Te&s;ta|ment, and are adapted to in&s;truction in this important &s;ubject; there is one
<PB N="10" REF="023213_0009_0FBEDC5654B81B90">which de&s;erves peculiar notice. The &s;aying to which I advert, is part of that <HI>good confe&s;&s;ion</HI> which our Lord witne&s;&s;ed before Pontius Pilate; <HI>My kingdom is not of this world.</HI> A conci&s;e, but com|prehen&s;ive declaration, and worthy of him that made it!&mdash;This capital &s;aying may be con&s;idered as the grand maxim on which he formed his conduct when among men; and it is pregnant with needful in&s;truction to all his di&s;ciples, re&s;pecting the New Oeconomy and the Chri&s;tian Church Relative to matters of that kind, there is not, perhaps, a more intere&s;ting pa&s;&s;age in all the New Te&s;tament; nor one which is better adapted to rebuke the pride and carna|lity of millions who bear the Chri&s;tian character. To approve of Chri&s;t as a &s;piritual monarch, agreeably to the meaning and tendency of this emphati|cal text, requires a degree of heavenly mindedne&s;s which comparatively few po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>My kingdom is not of this world,</HI> &s;ays Me&s;&s;iah the Prince, when &s;tanding be|fore the Roman governor, and que&s;|tioned about his claim of dignity. He boldly avows him&s;elf a King; yet, while advancing his title to the honors,
<PB N="11" REF="023213_0010_0FBEDC5877196478">of royalty, he tacitly informs Pilate that the civil rights of Ce&s;ar had no|thing to fear from him; and that his own di&s;ciples had no advantages to ex|pect, of a &s;ecular kind, as the re&s;ult of embarking in his cau&s;e.&mdash;Our Lord, a little while before, had im|plicitly conveyed the general idea of this declaration, by receiving from a &s;urrounding multitude the acclamati|ons due to his royal character, when <HI>riding upon an a&s;s:</HI> for while he accept|ed the honours of royalty, the poverty and meanne&s;s of his appearance plainly implied, that his kingdom was not of a temporal kind. Zechariah had fore|told that the children of Zion &s;hould loudly rejoice in this humble manifes|tation of the King Me&s;&s;iah, and that their joy &s;hould kindle into rapture. An incontrovertible evidence that he predicted the public inauguration of a Sovereign, who&s;e <HI>kingdom is not of this world.</HI> For the loyal and affectionate &s;ubjects of a political monarch never thought it matter of exultation, that he appeared among them, when pro|claimed king, with all the marks of meanne&s;s and of poverty. Yet &s;o it was in re&s;pect of the King Me&s;&s;iah.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="023213_0011_0FBEDC5C6E0DFA60">
It is generally allowed, if I mi&s;take not, that the kingdom of Chri&s;t is no other than the Go&s;pel Church<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Regnum Dei in evangeli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;ays WITSIUS, vix alia &s;ignificatione venit qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ut notet &s;latum exi|mium et vere iberum Eccle&s;ioe Te&s;tamenti Novi &s;ub Rege Me&s;&s;ia Exercitat, in Orat.

Relative to this kingdom, and its divine Sovereign, Je|hovah &s;ays; <HI>I have &s;et my King upon my holy hill of Zion.</HI> This prophetic Oracle was fulfilled when our Lord, <HI>leading captivity captive,</HI> a&s;cended on high and &s;at down on the right of the eternal Fa|ther. Then was he mo&s;t &s;olemnly in|augurated and proclaimed King of the New Te&s;tament Church, amid&s;t ador|ing myraids of attendant angels, and <HI>&s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect.</HI> In pur|&s;uance of which mo&s;t grand inve&s;titure with his regal office, he di&s;tributed royal donatives, at the fea&s;t of Penteco&s;t, among his devoted &s;ubjects&mdash; &s;uch do|natives, as perfectly &s;uited the maje&s;ty of his Per&s;on, and the nature of his kingdom. Yes, that wonderful a&s;&s;em|blage of &s;piritual gifts and heavenly graces, which he be&s;towed upon his di&s;ciples at the Jewi&s;h fe&s;tival, was a
<PB N="13" REF="023213_0012_0FBEDC5E76194228">glorious fir&s;t-fruit of his a&s;cen&s;ion, and of his being <HI>a prie&s;t upon his throne.</HI> The Go&s;pel Church, which is the &s;ub|ject of his laws, the &s;eat of his govern|ment, and the object of his care, being &s;urrounded with powerful oppo&s;ers; he is repre&s;ented as ruling <HI>in the mid&s;t of his enemies.</HI> Nor &s;hall his mediatorial kingdom and admini&s;tration cea&s;e, till all tho&s;e enemies become his foot&s;tool.</P>
<P>The empire of Chri&s;t, indeed, extends to every creature: for <HI>all authority in heaven and on earth</HI> is in his hands, and he <HI>is head over all things to the Church.</HI> But the kingdom of which we treat, &s;tands di&s;tingui&s;hed from that of gene|ral Providence, as well as from every political &s;tate. It mu&s;t be con&s;idered, therefore, as con&s;i&s;ting of tho&s;e per&s;ons whom he bought with his blood, whom he calls by his grace, and over whom he reigns as a &s;piritual monarch. The&s;e con&s;titute what is frequently called, the Catholic Church, wherever the favor|ed individuals may re&s;ide. Of &s;uch al|&s;o, or of tho&s;e who make a credible pro|fe&s;&s;ion of being &s;uch, all tho&s;e particu|lar churches con&s;i&s;t, which con&s;titute our Lord's vi&s;ible kingdom&mdash;that king|dom of which we &s;peak. Into the
<PB N="14" REF="023213_0013_0FBEDC5F5E8D9438">principal characteri&s;tics of this holy empire, and into the genuine con&s;e|quences of tho&s;e criteria, we &s;hall now enquire.</P>
<P><HI>The Go&s;pel Church is a kingdom not of this world, in regard to its origin.</HI> From the time of Nimrod to the pre&s;ent age, &s;ecular empires have generally origi|nated in the vile pa&s;&s;ions of their fir&s;t founders: for, in almo&s;t every in&s;tance, avarice and pride, ambition and a lu&s;t of dominion, have been con&s;picuous.&mdash;Not &s;o, in the kingdom of Chri&s;t. The remote foundation of his dominion was laid in the coun&s;els of Heaven before time commenced, by all comprehend|ing wi&s;dom and infinite goodne&s;s, for the glory of God and the benefit of man: and the immediate ba&s;is on which it &s;tands, is his own vicarious obedience to divine law; both as to its precepts, and as to its penalty. Ju&s;tice and good|ne&s;s, therefore, are the foundation of his throne. Mercy and truth attend the whole of his admini&s;tration.</P>
<P><HI>The kingdom of Chri&s;t is not of this world, re&s;pecting the &s;ubjects of his righte|ous government.</HI> The generality of peo|ple in all countries, were <HI>born</HI> &s;ubjects
<PB N="15" REF="023213_0014_0FBEDC62857CA1F0">of tho&s;e governments under which they lived. No &s;ooner, for in&s;tance, were we capable of reflecting upon our ci|vil connections, than we found our|&s;elves freeborn &s;ubjects of the Briti&s;h crown: and thus it commonly is in the &s;overeignties of &s;ecular princes. Their dominion being confined to the exteri|or of human conduct, and not reaching the heart; natural birth and local cir|cum&s;tances con&s;titue &s;ubjects of the &s;tate, put them under the protection of law, and inve&s;t them with civil rights. Such &s;ubjects are perfectly well &s;uited to the kingdoms of this world, and to the character of their &s;overeigns. For, con&s;idered as men, kings and &s;ubjects are on a level: and, as di&s;tingui&s;hed by po|litical characters, their obligations are mutual; allegiance on the one part, and protection on the other.&mdash;Be&s;ides, temporal kingdoms re&s;pect the pre&s;ent world. The mutual duties of &s;ove|reigns and of &s;ubjects, as &s;uch, regard the happine&s;s of civil &s;ociety, and of that only. As an inve&s;titure with poli|tical &s;overeignty does not con&s;titute a lord of con&s;cience, it gives no claim to authority in &s;piritual things, but is en|tirely confined to the concerns of this world. It is, indeed, the indi&s;pen&s;able
<PB N="16" REF="023213_0015_0FBEDC63D3CBB020">duty of &s;ecular princes, and of their people, to love and adore God: yet that obligation does not ari&s;e from any political relation &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among them, but from their being rea&s;onable crea|tures. It is al&s;o their happine&s;s to be the &s;ubjects of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: but that felicity does not re&s;ult from any thing &s;hort of divine mercy exerci&s;ed upon them, as depraved and guilty crea|tures.</P>
<P>The kingdom and claims of Chri&s;t be|ing very different from tho&s;e of Cea&s;ar, the qualifications and obedience of his real &s;ubjects mu&s;t be &s;o too. For per|&s;ons may be good &s;ubjects of a temporal &s;overeign, and enjoy the rights of &s;uch a character, while they are &s;o far from bearing true allegiance to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as to be quite inimical to his dominion, and entire &s;trangers to the privileges of his kingdom. The empire of Chri&s;t <HI>is not of this world:</HI> it is not a temporal, but a &s;piritual kingdom. Our Lord, there|fore, is a &s;piritual &s;overeign; who&s;e dominion extends to the mind, con&s;ci|ence, and heart, no le&s;s than to the ex|ternal behaviour. Con&s;equently, all the &s;ubjects of his government mu&s;t have &s;piritual di&s;po&s;itions, and yield &s;piritual
<PB N="17" REF="023213_0016_0FBEDC6590477330">obedience&mdash;obedience, proceeding from an enlightened under&s;tanding, an awakened con&s;cience, and a renewed heart. For, as is the &s;overeign, &s;uch are the &s;ubjects, and &s;uch the allegiance required. A &s;piritual Sovereign, and &s;ubjects yielding an obedience merely external, are manife&s;tly incon|&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P>As all mankind are born in a &s;tate of a po&s;ta&s;y from God: as the natural turn of the heart, or <HI>the carnal mind, is not &s;ubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be;</HI> we mu&s;t be born again&mdash;<HI>born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, but of God,</HI> before we are permitted to con&s;ider our&s;elves, or to be con&s;idered by others, as the &s;ub|jects of Him who&s;e kingdom is of a &s;piritual kind. Remarkable are the words of our Lord, when &s;peaking of his loyal &s;ubjects: <HI>They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</HI> No: they are de&s;cribed by the Apo&s;tles, as being <HI>of the truth; of faith;</HI> and <HI>of God</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xviii. 17.

<P>That none but real Chri&s;tians &s;ub|jects of our Lord's kingdom, is yet further apparent from the de&s;criptive characters of tho&s;e that were members of the apo&s;tolic churches.

<P>Very different, then, is the kingdom of Chri&s;t from the ancient <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h Theocracy.</HI> For, of that Theocracy, all Abraham's natural de&s;cendents were true &s;ubjects, and properly qualified members of the Jewi&s;h church; &s;uch only excepted, as had not been circum|ci&s;ed according to the order of God, or were guilty of &s;ome capital crime.

<P>The &s;tate of things, however, under the New Oeconomy, is extremely dif|ferent.

<P>It is of great importance to the right interpretation of many pa&s;&s;ages in the Old Te&s;tament, that this particular be well under&s;tood and kept in view, Je|hovah is very frequently repre&s;ented as the LORD and GOD of all the ancient I&s;raelites; even where it is manife&s;t that multitudes of them were con&s;ider|ed as de&s;titute of internal piety, and many of them as enormou&s;ly wicked. How, then, could he be called <HI>their</HI> Lord, and <HI>their</HI> God, in di&s;tinction from his relation to Gentiles, (who&s;e crea|tor, benefactor, and &s;overeign he was) except on the ground of the Sinai Cove|nant?
<PB N="27" REF="023213_0026_0FBEDC7FD52CDA48">He was THEIR <HI>Lord,</HI> as being the &s;overeign whom, by a federal tran&s;acti|on, they were bound to obey, in oppo|&s;ition to every political monarch, who &s;hould at any time pre&s;ume to govern them by laws of his own.

But that National relation between Jehovah and I&s;rael being long &s;ince di&s;&s;olved, and the Jew having no prerogative above the Gentile; the nature of the Go&s;pel Oeconomy, and the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom, abo&s;olutely forbids our &s;up|po&s;ing, that either Jews or Gentiles are warranted to call the Great Supreme THEIR <HI>Lord,</HI> or THEIR <HI>God,</HI> if they do not yield willing obedience to him, and perform &s;piritual wor&s;hip. It is, there|fore, either for want of under&s;tanding, or of con&s;idering, the nature, a&s;pect, and influence of the Sinai Con&s;titution, that many per&s;ons dream of the New Covenant, in great numbers of places, where Mo&s;es and the Prophets had no thought about it; but had the Conven|tion at Horeb directly in view.

<P>The children of I&s;rael, being di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the Gentile world, by a &s;y&s;tem of ceremonial precepts, and their divine Sovereign re&s;iding among them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere denominated <HI>a holy nation:</HI> for that external &s;anctity which they po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;eems to have ari&s;en, partly from their <HI>National Covenant,</HI> and partly from their having <HI>the Divine Pre&s;ence,</HI> among them.

<P>But did an external holine&s;s now exi&s;t, we &s;hould be obliged to con&s;ider it as very different from that of the ancient I&s;raelites: for it appears, by what has been &s;aid, that the grounds of their exterior &s;anctity make no part of the Chri&s;tian Oeconomy. Be&s;ides, their holine&s;s extended to the whole nation: but in what Utopia &s;hall we find all the inhabitants po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this relative purity?

Whereas, that external holine&s;s for which &s;o many plead, is not generally con&s;idered by them as extending beyond the time of infancy. &mdash;But why &s;hould any contend for the relative holine&s;s of infants, who deny a &s;anctity of that kind, to places of wor&s;hip, clerical habits, and various other things? for it is plain that the Jewi&s;h external purity, whether of per&s;ons, of places, or of things, ori|ginated in the &s;ame National Cove|nant, and in the &s;ame relation of God to I&s;rael: and, con&s;equently, mu&s;t have the &s;ame duration in one ca&s;e, as in another. We may therefore ju&s;tly conclude, that the federal and relative holine&s;s of which &s;o many &s;peak, nei|ther agrees with the laws of Judai&s;m, nor with the nature of Chri&s;tianity. But if &s;o, it cannot belong to the kingdom of Chri&s;t.</P>

The tenor of the New Te&s;tament, however, agreeably to our Lord's maxim, leads us to con&s;ider particular churches as Congregational; and as con&s;i&s;ting of tho&s;e who make a credi|ble profe&s;&s;ion of repentance and faith. Such congregations, wherever they be, con&s;titute the vi&s;ible kingdom of Chri&s;t.&mdash;That the apo&s;tolic churches were Congregational, is clear from the &s;acred Records; and that there was no National church for the fir&s;t three hundred years, is equally evident. Becau&s;e there could not be any &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hment, till the civil govern|ment of &s;ome nation or other profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tianity; which was not the ca&s;e before CONSTANTINE a&s;cended the Im|perial throne.

Nor are National churches likely to fail, while the policy of &s;overeign princes, and the pride of a&s;piring prelates can &s;upport them. But, being e&s;tabli&s;hed by human laws, and each of them ac|knowledging a vi&s;ible head, either civil or eccle&s;ia&s;tical, either prince or pon|tiff; they are &s;ecular kingdoms, and unworthy the name of Chri&s;tian churches.</P>
<P>Once more: As none but regenerate per&s;ons belong to the kingdom of Chri&s;t, no one is a better &s;ubject of his dominion, or a more honorable mem|ber of his church, on account of <HI>wealth</HI> or <HI>power,</HI> of <HI>parts</HI> or <HI>learning.</HI> The&s;e things, though u&s;eful in their places, of much reputation to a &s;ecular empire, and of great con&s;equence to it; nei|ther pertain to the true glory of a Chri&s;tian church, nor to the &s;terling worth of a Chri&s;tian character. For what concern have worldly wealth and civil power, informing a &s;piritual cha|racter, or in adorning a &s;piritual king|dom? The greate&s;t affluence and the highe&s;t authority that mortals can en|joy, add nothing to any one's moral worth. No one is a better man, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="45" REF="023213_0044_0FBEDCAED57DC520">he is rich and powerful; nor the wor&s;e, becau&s;e he is poor and in a low &s;tation. The&s;e things are all exterior to moral character. For the mo&s;t li|centious are often exalted and wealthy, while the mo&s;t upright and amiable are lo&s;t in ob&s;curity and oppre&s;&s;ed with want Be&s;ides, when wealth, or pow|er, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a true &s;ubject of our Lord's kingdom, the honor attending his character does not ari&s;e from his riches, or his authority; but from the holine&s;s of his life, or his likene&s;s to Je|&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>As our Briti&s;h Sovereign is the foun|tain of honor to all his &s;ubjects, even &s;o is the King Me&s;&s;iah to all that are under his dominion. The only way however to be great and honorable in his kingdom, is to be humble, diligent, and u&s;eful, in promoting the happi|ne&s;s of our fellow Chri&s;tians and fellow creatures. For among the fundamental laws of Me&s;&s;iah's empire, the following is one, and it relates to comparative honor: <HI>Who&s;oever will be great among you, let him be your mini&s;ter; and who|&s;oever will be chief among you, let him be your &s;ervant. Even as the Son of man came not to be mini&s;tered unto, but to mi|ni&s;ter,

Mark x. 42&mdash;45.</NOTE> This being the law of honor, and the rule of promotion, in the king|dom of Chri&s;t, we may &s;afely conclude, that the meane&s;t dome&s;tic may be a dig|nified character in a go&s;pel church, and <HI>adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour:</HI> while his wealthy and powerful ma&s;ter, profe&s;&s;ing the &s;ame faith, may di&s;grace the name of a Chri&s;tian, and bring re|proach on the congregation to which he belongs. If the former be diligent and faithful in his menial &s;tation: if he be <HI>&s;ound in the faith,</HI> zealous for God, and heavenly minded; he is an honor|able &s;ubject of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and high in the e&s;timation of Heaven. If, on the contrary, the latter be formal in his re|ligious profe&s;&s;ion; if he be unju&s;t or haughty, voluptuous or covetous; he does not belong to the kingdom of Chri&s;t, but is manife&s;tly a &s;ubject of Satan.</P>
<P>Nor do the mo&s;t &s;hining mental ac|compli&s;hments, or literary acqui&s;itions, enter into the true glory of this king|dom. Genius and learning, like wealth and power, are frequently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by
<PB N="47" REF="023213_0046_0FBEDCB60BCB9F70">the wor&s;t of moral characters. They cannot, therefore, make any part of that excellence by which the &s;ubjects of Je&s;us Chri&s;t are di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e &s;ecular princes. It is not by the gifts of common Providence, among which parts and learning make a con|&s;picuous figure; but by the graces of the Holy Spirit, that any per&s;on, as a Chri&s;tian, is worthy of regard.&mdash;Yes, it is faith in Chri&s;t, and obedience to him; love to God, and benevolence to man; humility, patience, and re&s;ig|nation; &s;pirituality, and heavenly mind|edne&s;s, which adorn the &s;ubjects of our Lord's kingdom&mdash;which di&s;tingui&s;h them from the children of this world.

The di&s;tinction they make between one another is entirely &s;uper|ficial, and often di&s;graced by a profli|gate heart&mdash;belongs only to this world, and has no connection with heaven.

But the honor of Chri&s;t and the tranquility of con&s;cience are &s;eldom promoted, in a public mini&s;try, by the re&s;earches of learning, or the refinements of genius: for they are too &s;acred, and too &s;piritual, to ac|knowledge their obligations to &s;uch things.</P>

<P>Neither the force of <HI>&s;ecular power,</HI> nor the arts of <HI>carnal policy,</HI> ought there|fore to be u&s;ed in promoting the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t: &s;uch things being quite ab|horrent from his intention, and from the nature of his kingdom. The great de&s;ign of our Lord in founding a Spiri|tual empire was, to di&s;play the perfec|tions of God in the holine&s;s and happi|ne&s;s of his cho&s;en people. The king|dom of Chri&s;t, as before ob&s;erved, is a dominion of truth and of rectitude, of love and of peace. Now the intere&s;ts of &s;uch a monarchy, and the end pro|po&s;ed by it, cannot be promoted by any other than &s;piritual means, and tho&s;e of divine appointment. It is only &s;o far as the minds of men are enlightened by heavenly truth, their con&s;ciences impre&s;&s;ed with God's authority, and their hearts engaged on &s;piritual things, that the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t is advanced.

It is only by the fruits of an adoring af|fection for God, of &s;incere love to the brethren, and of cordial good will to all mankind, that our Lord is honored, or his end an&s;wered, by the &s;ubjects of his dominion.

Truth &s;eeks no &s;ubterfuge, and rectitude fears no exa|mination: but the operations of policy are &s;ubtle, and its fir&s;t de&s;igns are latent.

Here we perceive another di&s;parity between the Jewi&s;h and the Chri&s;tian church.

The church and the &s;tate being coex|tended, and including the &s;ame per&s;ons, an exclu&s;ion from the former was an expul&s;ion from the latter; whether it was by a &s;entence of capital puni&s;h|ment, or in &s;ome other way. But this, like many other things, was peculiar to that Di&s;pen&s;ation. It was founded in the-National form of their church-&s;tate, and in their Theocracy. Thence it was that bla&s;phemy and idolatry were puni&s;hed with death, as being high-trea&s;on again&s;t their divine Sovereign. That Oeconomy being aboli&s;hed, the church of God has taken a new form. <HI>The prie&s;thood being changed, there is of
<PB N="75" REF="023213_0074_0FBEDCFF0ECABE40">nece&s;&s;ity a change al&s;o of the law,</HI> relating to the con&s;titution, members, and go|vernment of the church.

<P>Our divine Sovereign has al&s;o pro|vided for the edification of his loyal &s;ubjects, by ordinances and rites of wor&s;hip, no le&s;s than for the govern|ment of his kingdom. As King of the Chri&s;tian church, it con&s;titutes a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed part of his royal prerogative, to pre&s;cribe the whole of that &s;piritual &s;ervice which is to be performed. Of this prerogative Jehovah was always jealous: nor, under the former Oeco|nomy, did he ever more in&s;tantly, or more &s;everely puni&s;h, than when his
<PB N="76" REF="023213_0075_0FBEDD008E486EE0">orders about the affairs of religion were di&s;regarded; even though, as in the ca&s;e of Uzzah, the motive appeared laudable.&mdash;What is religion, in its va|rious branches, but that obedience which is due to God? And what is obe|dience, but &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his authority? Now, as authority exerts it&s;elf in com|mands, there cannot be obedience, there cannot be holy wor&s;hip, where there is no divine command, either explicit or implicit. <HI>Who hath required this at your hands?

<P>Strange, that any Prote&s;tant church &s;hould avowedly claim a <Q>power to decree rites or ceremonies</Q> in the &s;olemn &s;ervice of our divine Lord! As if he were not the legi&s;lator in his own kingdom! Or as if, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of authority, he had not wi&s;|dom enough to provide for his own honor; or were defective in goodne&s;s, re&s;pecting his faithful &s;ubjects! But whatever the compilers and the &s;ub|&s;cribers of a National Creed may
<PB N="77" REF="023213_0076_0FBEDD06D371A170">think, to perform rites which Chri&s;t did not appoint, and to alter tho&s;e which he enjoined, are vile impeach|ments of his royal character, and mu&s;t expo&s;e to his re&s;entment.

<P><HI>The kingdom of Chri&s;t is not like the em|pires of this world, in regard to external &s;plendor.</HI> The grandeur of a temporal kingdom chiefly con&s;i&s;ts, in the number and affluence of its nobility, the titles and pompous appearance of its various magi&s;trates, the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of its trade and commerce, the wealth of its
<PB N="78" REF="023213_0077_0FBEDD0816DF1E28">yeomanry, and the elegance of its pub|lic buildings. Magnificent palaces and royal robes are quite in character for &s;ecular princes.

The&s;e and &s;imilar things give an air of dignity, and of importance, to political &s;overeignties: but they are all foreign to the kingdom of Chri&s;t, the glory of which is entirely &s;piritual&mdash;The Chri&s;tian Church is dignified and adorned, by being the depo&s;itary of di|vine truth in its unadulterated &s;tate, and by practi&s;ing divine appointments in their primitive purity; by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the beauties of holine&s;s, and by enjoy|ing the pre&s;ence of God.

<P>It mu&s;t therefore be very ab&s;urd to think of doing honor to Chri&s;tianity, by erecting <HI>pompous places</HI> of wor&s;hip, by <HI>con&s;ecrating</HI> tho&s;e places, and by adorn|ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mith <HI>&s;howy ve&s;tments,</HI> in the per|formance of public wor&s;hip.

Wa&s;ting plagues and awful deaths were often inflicted by eternal ju&s;tice, on tho&s;e who dared to oppo&s;e, or to oppre&s;s, the people of God. An angel was commi&s;&s;ioned to de&s;troy the Egyptian fir&s;t-born; Pha|raoh, with his mighty ho&s;t, were drowned in the Red &s;ea; and the Ca|naaniti&s;h nations were put to the &s;word,

Becau&s;e, though every true &s;ubject of the King Me&s;&s;iah be in a &s;tate very dif|ferent from that of a merely nominal Chri&s;tian, and though he is thankful for that difference; yet he is not, he can|not be &s;atisfied, either with what he knows, or with what he enjoys; with what he is, or with what he does. Not with what he <HI>knows:</HI> for he knows but <HI>in part,</HI> and he feels the deficiency. His acquaintance with the Greate&s;t and Be&s;t of beings&mdash;with the character and perfections, with the works and ways of God, is extremely &s;mall. His know|ledge of the adorable Je&s;us&mdash;of his Per|&s;on and offices, of his grace and work, of his kingdom and glory, is ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> con|tracted. Nay, the knowledge he has of him&s;elf, and of his final de&s;tination in the heavenly world, is exceedingly
<PB N="122" REF="023213_0121_0FBEDA990B4A0B90">&s;canty: for <HI>the heart is deceitful above all things;</HI> and <HI>it does not yet appear what we &s;hall be.</HI> He cannot therefore be contented with &s;uch a pittance of &s;piritual knowledge.</P>
<P>Not with what he <HI>enjoys:</HI> for his enjoyment of &s;piritual plea&s;ure is, at the highe&s;t, comparatively low. Be|&s;ides, it is frequently interrupted by the in&s;urrections of indwelling &s;in, and by the incur&s;ions of outward temptation. Though he &s;ometimes exults in the light of God's countenance, partaking of joy that is <HI>un&s;peakable and full of glory;</HI> yet he frequently mourns the want of that exalted plea&s;ure, and <HI>groans being burdened.</HI></P>
<P>Not with what he <HI>is:</HI> for he feels much depravity, and laments over it, as affecting his mind with darkne&s;s; his con&s;cience with guilt, or with &s;tupidi|ty; and his pa&s;&s;ions with carnality. So far from perfectly bearing the image of Chri&s;t, that his language frequently is; <HI>O wretched man that I am! who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this death!</HI></P>
<P>Not with what he <HI>does:</HI> for though he &s;incerely de&s;ires to perform the will of God&punc; as revealed in divine precepts,
<PB N="123" REF="023213_0122_0FBEDA9A61664718">and illu&s;trated by the example of Chri&s;t; yet he perceives that his obe|dience is very imperfect. Does he, for in&s;tance, addre&s;s him&s;elf to God in prayer? in that devout exerci&s;e his whole &s;oul &s;hould be engaged. Reve|rence of the divine Maje&s;ty, and an aba&s;ing &s;en&s;e of his own guilt; &s;aith in the great atonement, and confidence in paternal mercy; the ardour of petition, and the comfort of expectation, &s;hould be all united. But frequently, alas! his thoughts wander, and his pious af|fections are dull, if not dormant. His prayer &s;eems little be&s;ides a conflict with his own corruption. He ri&s;es from his knees with &s;orrow and with &s;ighs. A&s;hamed of the manner in which he has treated the omni&s;cient Object of his wor&s;hip, he cannot for bear exclaim|ing; <HI>God be merciful to me a &s;inner!</HI> and this, perhaps, is the only petition over which he does not mourn, as de&s;titute of holy animation.&mdash;Or if he enjoy li|berty in his conver&s;e with the Father of all mercies, how often does he find &s;e|cret pride, and &s;elf-gratulation, ari&s;e in his heart? as if the Mo&s;t Holy would regard his confe&s;&s;ions, petitions, and thank&s;givings for the &s;ake of their own excellence! Aware of the latent poi&s;on,
<PB N="124" REF="023213_0123_0FBEDA9D637FA968">he is almo&s;t confounded. For well he knows, that Chri&s;tianity is the religion of &s;inners&mdash;of depraved, of guilty, of unworthy creatures: and that nothing is more incon&s;i&s;tent with evangelical truth, or more dete&s;table in the &s;ight of our Maker, than &s;elf-applau&s;e re&s;pect|ing acceptance with God. Knowing him&s;elf to be a polluted worm that de|&s;erves to peri&s;h, he trembles to think of ever &s;uppo&s;ing that the maje&s;ty of the Mo&s;t High, and the purity of the Mo&s;t Holy, will accept his imperfect &s;ervi|ces for their own &s;ake. In the mo&s;t em|phatical manner he, therefore, with Job exclaims; <HI>Behold, I am vile!&mdash;I abhor my&s;elf!</HI> So various and &s;o great are the defects in our devotional &s;er|vices, that we might well de&s;pair, were it not for a High-prie&s;t who bears the iniquity of our <HI>holy things.</HI> For we <HI>find a law, that when we would do good, evil is pre&s;ent with us.</HI></P>
<P>To &s;uch imperfections and &s;uch com|plaints, is a real &s;ubject of our Lord's dominion liable in the pre&s;ent life. But, looking forward to the &s;eparate &s;tate, when he &s;hall <HI>be with Chri&s;t, which is far better,</HI> and to the re&s;urrection of the righteous; with joy he adopts the
<PB N="125" REF="023213_0124_0FBEDA9E1AAE3B10">language of David and &s;ays, <HI>I &s;hall be &s;atisfied, when I awake with thy likene&s;s.</HI> Yes, when that ultimate and everla&s;ting Oeconomy commences, his mind be|ing all irradiated with divine truth, he &s;hall be &s;atisfied with what he <HI>knows:</HI> perfectly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Chief Good, he &s;hall be &s;atisfied with what he <HI>enjoys;</HI> con&s;cious of complete rectitude, he &s;hall be &s;atisfied with what he <HI>is:</HI> and knowing his obedience to be con&s;um|mate, he &s;hall be &s;atisfied with what he <HI>does.</HI>&mdash;Delightful, ravi&s;hing thought! To have all our immortal powers ex|panded and filled, with knowledge of the Supreme truth, and with love to the Supreme Beauty; with reverence of the Supreme Lord, and with delight in the Supreme Good, mu&s;t con&s;titute com|plete happine&s;s. Yet &s;uch is the grand re&s;ult of our Lord's dominion in the hearts of men! To this, therefore, we mu&s;t look, upon this our affections mu&s;t be placed, if we would behave as the &s;ubjects of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and fini&s;h our cour&s;e with honor. For as this life is the &s;eed-time of an eternal harve&s;t; as no one <HI>gathers grapes of thorns, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> figs of thi&s;tles;</HI> and as <HI>whatever a man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ows, that &s;hall he al&s;o rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">;</HI> &s;o we have no

<P>It is one of the noble&s;t and mo&s;t de|lightful employments of the human mind, to contemplate the gradual reve|lation of Jehovah's will, and the grow|ing di&s;play of his eternal favor, from the fall of our fir&s;t parents, to the con|&s;ummation of the divine Oeconomy. It is both plea&s;ing and improving to re|flect on the Patriarchal Di&s;pen&s;ation in|troducing the Mo&s;aic Sy&s;tem; on the Sinai Confederation making way for the New Covenant; on the Jewi&s;h Theocracy leading to the Kingdom of Chri&s;t; on the government of that kingdom as a preparation for cele&s;tial man&s;ions; on the performance of holy wor&s;hip, by the &s;ubjects of Chri&s;t here, as the mean of communion with <HI>&s;aints in light;</HI> and on the pre&s;ent &s;tate of wor&s;hip and of ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in the hea|venly &s;anctuary, as preparing for the ultimate glory.</P>
<P>In reference to the communion of believers with <HI>the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made

But whil&s;t they are in the <HI>&s;anctuary,</HI> in <HI>the temple of God,</HI> in the holy wor&s;hip of Chri&s;t, and of God in him, and we are not only employed in the &s;ame work in &s;acred ordinances &s;uited unto our &s;tate and condition, but in the per|formance of our duties do by faith <HI>enter in within the veil,</HI> and approach unto the &s;ame throne of grace in the mo&s;t holy place; there is a &s;piritual communion between them and us.
