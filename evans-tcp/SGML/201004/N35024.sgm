<HEAD>NATIONAL CREDIT AND CHARACTER. 1790.</HEAD>
<P>THIS country will more and more experience the good effects of the &s;teadine&s;s, wi&s;dom, and energy of her general government. The ability of America is now con&s;olidated in an approved and adequate &s;y&s;tem, which will give con&s;equence abroad and a&s;&s;ure harmony and protection at home; whereas a number of little &s;overeignties were rather threaten|ing perpetual di&s;cord, with in&s;ecurity, and every effect oppo&s;ed to the good &s;ought by men in forming governments, for the protection of their per&s;ons, and of the wages of their labour and care, again&s;t bad people at home and enemies abroad.</P>
<P>UNDER this efficacious, mild, and free govern|ment, over an exten&s;ive and fine country, we have now before us a report of the price of her freedom, and of the means for &s;atisfying her creditors; which is nervous, clear, and promi&s;ing, as it al&s;o is ho|norable to the abilities and integrity of the Secretary of her Trea&s;ury. It offers nought to inthral its hone&s;t purpo&s;e of performing what this people na|tionally promi&s;ed they would perform, and for which they have a con&s;ideration; though indeed in national engagements a con&s;ideration, or value re|ceived, is not nece&s;&s;ary to give validity to them. What, between man and man, would be <HI>nudum
<PB N="2" REF="045834_0002_10206615D84E9860" MS="y">pactum,</HI> is not con&s;idered as &s;uch re&s;pecting a govern|ment or &s;tate. A national promi&s;e requires the mo&s;t ready and complete performance, in all ca&s;es, and will not admit of circumlocution or modification, however &s;mooth the pre&s;ence. Governments &s;u&s;|pected to be capable of committing a breach of faith in trimming their engagements, whatever be the plau&s;ible advantages propo&s;ed, will be in low credit; and, when tru&s;ted, mu&s;t pay a premium, in a high intere&s;t, for e&s;timated ri&s;ques.</P>
<P>A FULL unequivocal <HI>performance</HI> of engagements, in every iota, &s;tamping a character of inflexible integrity in the &s;overeign authority of a nation, will communicate to &s;uch nation the highe&s;t credit and re&s;pect with the attendants national health and abi|lity: whereas, nations deficient therein, will want, will be weak, will be deranged will be nece&s;&s;itous; and mu&s;t pay at dear and ruinous rates. It is <HI>opinion,</HI> alone, of this invincible integrity in a &s;overeign power, that commands the loans and the confidence of individuals and nations upon the cheape&s;t and be&s;t terms: but to obtain or pre&s;erve this <HI>opinion</HI> every &s;tep, every word, every thought of &s;overeigns, re|&s;pecting their engagements, mu&s;t be unequivocal, and with a&s;&s;urance that "though they promi&s;e to their lo&s;s, they will make then promi&s;e good."</P>

Governments are &s;o far omnipotent.&mdash;Hi&s;tory abounds with in&s;tances of <HI>ignorance</HI> in &s;upremacy. To the account of <HI>ignorance,</HI> is chargeable the general depravity of Europe, for mo&s;t if not all of the cen|turies of the chri&s;tian era, which have preceded the pre&s;ent; and it was the <HI>ignorance</HI> of <HI>&s;overeigns</HI> and of <HI>legi&s;lators.</HI> It led them to believe that their &s;afety, their grandeur, and their happine&s;s depended on their brutalizing the people, who were under their &s;ubjection. They did brutalize, they &s;waggered in diabolical wantonne&s;s, and they dogmati&s;ed: but apprehen&s;ion of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination or of deprivation was con|tinually grating their minds. The people were wretched&mdash;the &s;overeign more wretched&mdash;all were <HI>ignorant;</HI> and it was an arcanum of tho&s;e who could read, to prevent others from learning to read: the body of the people were to be kept in ignorance, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the ignorance of their feudal &s;ove|reigns&mdash;but clerks read, and clerks read for their own pur|po&s;es.&mdash;It was the art of printing which became the great in&s;trument in diffu&s;ing <HI>knowledge,</HI> as it aro&s;e in the minds of a few people of wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, and was by them communicated to the world through that noble in&s;trument. The pre&s;s has nearly annihilated tyranny, in diffu&s;ing <HI>knowledge</HI> to the world, and warning wi&s;dom of her danger from the wicked. It is to be lamented, however, that this noble friend of mankind &s;hould ever have been perverted to become the in&s;trument of incendiaries&mdash;or of malicious &s;landerers. Whil&s;t it is free to communicate intelligence of a public nature, common &s;en&s;e&mdash;humanity&mdash;the &s;weets of &s;ocial happine&s;s&mdash;and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of its own dignity and office, will forbid its degenerating into a vehicle of chit|chat abu&s;e and &s;candal of individuals in private life, or of malignancy towards the government of the country. Free|dom of communication concerning public affairs, will be expected from it,&mdash;it will be &s;ought for by the people, whil&s;t it &s;peaks to the <HI>under&s;tanding:</HI> but attempts to impo&s;e ribaldry on them, would di&s;gu&s;t their good &s;en&s;e, as being foreign to any good purpo&s;e, and affrontive to their under&s;tandings.</NOTE> &mdash;where will it end! Even in the cour&s;e of enacting laws on other common occa&s;ions, a weakne&s;s appearing in them cheapens a legi&s;lature, in the judgment of the world, and le&s;&s;ens energy in the government; for it le&s;&s;ens <HI>opinion</HI> of the abilities of her public men; which mars confidence in the government tinged with ignorance or affected with caprice: this a&s;&s;ur|edly is a &s;ink to public credit.</P>

INDIVIDUALS perform their contracts from hone&s;t principle, or to &s;upport character for future advan|tages, or to avoid compul&s;ion, with co&s;t and &s;hame, in the courts of ju&s;tice: governments are quickened in the performance of theirs to promote their credit and character; without which their con&s;equence and power are contemptible.
