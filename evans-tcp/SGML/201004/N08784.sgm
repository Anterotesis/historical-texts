<SPEAKER>SIR GEO.)</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL Mr. Flint, tho' I acknowledge that the late <HI>revenue acts, re&s;trictions, regulations,</HI> and new con&s;tructed <HI>admiralty courts,</HI> are ab&s;urd in them&s;elves, as well as hurtful to both the mother country and the&s;e colonies; and that they are now &s;een to be &s;o by almo&s;t all the &s;en&s;ible part of the nation; yet, there is one thing that has always &s;urprized us very much in England, and that is, we have been told that ye are as much divided among your&s;elves in &s;entiments about the&s;e affairs as we are in England; nay it has been repre&s;ented to us by <HI>top hands,</HI> that the better &s;ort of people in the colonies acquie&s;ce in tho&s;e mea&s;ures, and that it is only a &s;mall <HI>Faction</HI> that oppo&s;e them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. FLINT.)</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, &s;ir, that it has been &s;o repre&s;ented, but in the cour&s;e of your travels through this country, I doubt not but you will find it quite otherwi&s;e; you'll find that the late mea&s;ures are di&s;|liked by all orders of people thro' the continent, a few individuals excepted, that have rewards in view for profe&s;&s;ing different &s;entiments; I &s;ay <HI>profe&s;&s;ing,</HI> for there is no man that can entertain real &s;entiments in favor of either the ju&s;tice or policy of the late mea&s;ures; but I won't enter upon the &s;ubject now; let us take a walk upon 'change.</P>

<P>With all my heart; this is your goal that was burnt down the other night, I &s;uppo&s;e, and that your &s;tate hou&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. FLINT.)</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, this, &s;ir, is what we call our town hou&s;e: Here our <HI>politicians, lawyers, merchants,</HI> and <HI>idle people</HI> walk an hour before dinner to &s;ettle the nation, while they are creating an appetite. Do you ob&s;erve you group of people upon tho&s;e &s;teps at the north &s;ide of the 'change? tho&s;e are the people that have <HI>a&s;&s;umed</HI> to them&s;elves the name of <HI>preroga|tive men,</HI> while in fact every man has in view &s;ome reward for putting on that character; for you mu&s;t know that the real di&s;intere&s;ted <HI>prerogative men,</HI> are tho&s;e who have been repre&s;ented home as Sons of Liberty and licentiou&s;ne&s;s.

<P>That Sir,&mdash;(under <HI>Verres</HI>) is their chief leader; he is now a provincial &s;tate officer, with a <HI>pen&s;ion;</HI> was once an un&s;ucce&s;sful <HI>&s;muggler</HI> and merchant in this town; he is the idol of that group, and &s;ome few more in the country, but has lo&s;t the confidence and e&s;teem of the people, which was once his glory; he has two pa&s;&s;ions that prevail with great &s;trength; <HI>ambition</HI> and <HI>avarice,</HI> all others being to|tally ab&s;orbed; the&s;e are in great force indeed, and frequently interfere with each other, yet his mo&s;t intimate friends cannot determine which mo&s;t predo|minates, they are alternately uppermo&s;t, and having none of the common pa&s;&s;ions of life to di&s;turb him, he remains a man of a&s;&s;iduity and application; in whatever he undertakes, he is thoro'ly accompli&s;hed in every art both to make a friend, or take off an ene|my, as he may have occa&s;ion, and is the ma&s;ter-piece of human nature for <HI>di&s;&s;imulation</HI> and <HI>di&s;gui&s;e.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. FLINT.)</SPEAKER>
<P>That, Sir, was once a partner to <HI>his gravity</HI> in trade, and having &s;aved &s;omething pretty, he is now retired to a neighbouring village, and is a man that does not want &s;en&s;e &s;o much as <HI>Philanthropy;</HI> he has made many un&s;ucce&s;sful pu&s;hes both for the &s;enate and bench, he is, however, not di&s;couraged, having &s;ecured the friend&s;hip and intere&s;t of <HI>Verres</HI> and the <HI>Tall-Man,</HI> by becoming high in <HI>prerogative,</HI> prophe&s;ying direful di&s;a&s;ters that will happen to this town and country for mentioning the word <HI>Rights;</HI> he is at pre&s;ent only a brevet county bench man, and a kind of <HI>oracle</HI> with the young gentlemen of the village that are &s;eeking preferment in &mdash; Philan|throp's path.</P>

<P>That, Sir, is a gentleman from C&mdash;; he held a place for &s;ome years in the R&mdash;e of about &pound;. 200 a year, but it was generally thought that he made of it as many thou&s;ands, and is now retired into the country upon about &s;ix or eight thou|&s;and pounds; he lives genteelly; and having done with an office, he is a very high <HI>prerogative man,</HI> Sir, and maintains that all acts of p&mdash;t whatever, are binding upon the colonies, and that they are rebels that &s;peak otherwi&s;e: His taking this character, and the court he pays the C&mdash;rs, he thinks may prevent an enquiry into his pa&s;t conduct.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEO.)</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! and he has my pity too, but mixed with a large &s;hare of contempt, if that is his character!&mdash;And pray who is that <HI>lop&s;ided crooked</HI> figure, that looks &s;o like <HI>Churchill's prophecy of famine.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. FLINT.)</SPEAKER>
<P>That, Sir, is brother to the <HI>Tall-Man,</HI> he is of the quorum, and upon the county bench, is as &s;our in temper, as he looks in per&s;on, and is waiting with great impatience to &s;ucceed his brother in lucrative places, which, he is encouraged to hope for from <HI>Verres,</HI> and the Tall-Man, when the latter takes the helm.</P>

<P>That, Sir, is a native of a neighbour|ing town; he &s;erved his time to a wealthy merchant, who&s;e daughter he married, by whom he got an hand|&s;ome fortune for this country, which by an indolent life, and not much oeconomy, he is tho't to have &s;ome|what impaired; he is at pre&s;ent in the Senate, but by his pa&s;t conduct has little rea&s;on to expect a continu|ance there, under the pre&s;ent con&s;titution, which he is continually wi&s;hing may be de&s;troyed, that he may have a chance for a <HI>mandamus.</HI> He has al&s;o a great inclination to a &s;eat upon the county-bench.

<SPEAKER>Sir GEO.)</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray who is that <HI>creature</HI> with a blue &s;urtout, a bu&s;h wig, and the hat dropping to the left &s;houlder, that looks &s;o like one of our <HI>northern &s;aw-gelders?</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. FLINT.)</SPEAKER>
<P>That, Sir, is a <HI>Bretton,</HI> that made the be&s;t of his way out of Scotland very &s;oon after a certain affair that took place in 1745.

Upon this acqui&s;ition, he took to an indolent idle life, read romances, plays, news-papers and pam|phlets; and in his own <HI>in&s;en&s;ate</HI> imagination became a man of letters, wrote a &s;atyrical piece upon his neigh|bour <HI>Sir Charles Froth,</HI> and is now (through poverty) become the pimp and &s;py to that very man, fetches and carries news, throws anonymous letters into peo|ples yards, conveys&mdash;&s;editious papers to the officers of the army and navy <HI>(as from the people)</HI> or any other &s;uch kind of bu&s;ine&s;s, as <HI>Charles</HI> may have oc|ca&s;ion to tran&s;act; for which, it is &s;aid, he is encoura|ged to hope for a Waiter's birth at Marblehead, Cape-Ann, or &s;ome of tho&s;e kind of places; and on that account he is a very high <HI>prerogative man</HI> Sir, has re|futed many of Mr. Locke's be&s;t arguments in favor of civil liberty, and is him&s;elf truly obedient to all acts of parliament, except &s;uch as oblige a man to <HI>pay his debts.</HI>&mdash;The&s;e Sir, are the &s;ort of people that a&s;|&s;ume the name of <HI>prerogative men.</HI></P>
