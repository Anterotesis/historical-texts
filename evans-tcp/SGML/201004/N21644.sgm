<HEAD>CAUTIONARY HINTS.</HEAD>
<P>BY the treaty of peace, and the ce&s;&s;ions of the &s;everal &s;tates in the union, the United States po&s;&s;e&s;s an extent of territory out of the juri&s;diction of any &s;tate, and hitherto un&s;ettled, equal to, or per|haps more than, the territory of all the &s;tates in the union together. The con&s;titution of the United States provides, that Congre&s;s &s;hall have power to di&s;po&s;e of, and make all needful rules and regulations re|&s;pecting that territory: and it appears from a late re|port of a committee in Congre&s;s, that it is in con|templation, as &s;oon as a peace is concluded with the Indians, to make &s;ale of tho&s;e lands, or a part of them, for the purpo&s;e of di&s;charging the national debt.</P>
<P>There can be no doubt, that the ce&s;&s;ions of the &s;everal &s;tates were made with a view to this great ob|ject, nor that the le&s;&s;ening and final di&s;charge of the national debt is of the fir&s;t importance to our politi|cal happine&s;s. It may, however, be well worthy of con&s;ideration, whether it ought to be effected, alto|gether in this mode, at once, or by degrees, &s;ince it is po&s;&s;ible, that a precipitate endeavour to remove the burthen from our &s;houlders, may entail a heavier grievance upon the nation.</P>
<P>It appears from &s;ome late documents, that the re|venue of the United States is at pre&s;ent &s;o con&s;ider|able, as to leave a &s;urplus of 600,000 dollar for the la&s;t year, even after defraying the burthens of the
<PB N="4" REF="028459_0003_0FD90C2D0447FE38">
Indian war, the building of frigates, and other arm|ed ve&s;&s;els, &amp;c. and the expence attending the late call of the militia to &s;uppre&s;s the in&s;urrection in Penn|&s;ylvania; the e&s;timates for the Indian war, frigates and fortifications, amounted the la&s;t year to the &s;um of 4,917,227 dollars.&mdash;The expence of the call of militia I have &s;een no e&s;timate of, but I pre&s;ume it can fall very little, if at all, &s;hort of a million of dol|lars.&mdash;From the fair pro&s;pect which we are given to hope, there is now before us, of peace, both at home and abroad. there is rea&s;on to hope, that if we &s;hall not be wholly liberated from the&s;e burthens, they will be greatly dimini&s;hed in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent and en&s;uing years. I am not enough ac|quainted with official details and e&s;timates to fix the &s;um, which will be annually &s;aved to the United States, if this hope prove not abortive; but &s;uppo|&s;ing 1,500,000 dollars &s;ufficient to defray the expence of a peace e&s;tabli&s;hment, (and I &s;hould hope it was more than doubly &s;ufficient,) there would remain a &s;ur|plus of 4,417,227 dollars, which added to the 600,000 dollars &s;urplus, now &s;aid to exi&s;t, would con&s;titute a fund of 5,000,000 of dollars for the redemption of the national debt, amounting to about 80,000,000 of dollars, which would redeem the debt in <HI>&s;ixteen years,</HI> were the whole funded at 6 per cent. But as one third of the original debt carries no intere&s;t, and the intere&s;t thereon, which has been funded, car|ries an intere&s;t of 3 per cent. only, five millions of dollars in &s;pecie would at the pre&s;ent price of 3 per cents. and deferred 6 per cents. in the market, pur|cha&s;es 8,333,333 dollars, con&s;equently, if one half the national debt, or 40,000,000 con&s;i&s;t in the&s;e kinds of &s;tock, that proportion would be redeemed in le&s;s than five years, from this fund, if applied to the purcha&s;e of this de&s;cription of the debt, before the time arrives when the deferred 6 per cents. bear an intere&s;t. At the end of five years we may very rea|&s;onably conclude, that the revenue, without a &s;ingle additional duty or tax, would, from the bare increa&s;e of commerce, and of exci&s;ed &s;pirits made in the Uni|ted

States, produce at the lea&s;t one million of dollars more, in aid of the &s;inking fund. But without this additional aid, the mo&s;t common arithmetician may &s;ee, that the remaining 40,000,000 would be re|deemed in <HI>eight</HI> years time, making in all <HI>thirteen</HI> years for the complete redemption of the whole debt. But upon the ground I have taken, it would be re|deemed in much le&s;s time, as will appear,

<P>Thus it will appear that in <HI>le&s;s</HI> than <HI>eleven</HI> years by the proper application of the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> funds of the United States if they be really as productive as they have been &s;tated to be, we may, unle&s;s plunged into new expences by new wars, which heaven forbid! pay off the pre|&s;ent debt of the United States, without the &s;malle&s;t ad|ditional burthen to the people; and without recour&s;e to the &s;ale of the territory belonging to the United States; which may be regarded as a precious mine of national wealth, which it would be highly imprudent to alien|ate,
<PB N="6" REF="028459_0005_0FD90C3303115EB0">
or even to open, whil&s;t the ordinary revenue of the States is commen&s;urate to the demands again&s;t them. Let it not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that, like a mi&s;er, I would recommend this trea&s;ure to be perpetually lock|ed up; it is the improvident wa&s;te, and not the ne|ce&s;&s;ary u&s;e of it, that I propo&s;e to guard again&s;t. For the We&s;tern Territory is to be con&s;idered, not only as a fund of actual <HI>wealth,</HI> to the United States, but of <HI>population,</HI> and <HI>&s;trength</HI> to the Union. Yet an impro|vident u&s;e of it, may produce the very rever&s;e of the&s;e advantages, by &s;ub&s;tituting <HI>poverty</HI> for <HI>wealth;</HI> a <HI>de|populated</HI> country for one <HI>populous;</HI> and <HI>weakne&s;s</HI> for <HI>&s;trength.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The We&s;tern Territory is to be regarded as a national &s;tock of wealth; it may be compared to bul|lion, or coin depo&s;ited in the vaults of a bank, which, although it produces no <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> profit, <HI>&s;ecures the credit of the in&s;titution, and is ready to an&s;wer any emergency:</HI> with this advantage in favour of the <HI>lands,</HI> that their value mu&s;t encrea&s;e with population, whereas the money in bank not circulated, gains no intere&s;t. And with this di&s;advantage al&s;o, re&s;pecting the <HI>lands,</HI> that <HI>when &s;old, both principal and intere&s;t are gone forever;</HI> whereas the bullion may again return to the bank; but the price of the lands can never be ve&s;ted in any other &s;ub|ject with equal advantage. If then Congre&s;s, in&s;tead of applying the <HI>annual revenue</HI> of the United States to the redemption of the national debt, &s;hould &s;ell the lands at <HI>a low value,</HI> would not this be a mo&s;t improvident &s;acrifice of a <HI>principal</HI> which could <HI>never be renewed,</HI> by any application of the <HI>annual revenue,</HI> which of it|&s;elf is &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the requi&s;ite purpo&s;e? For we are well appri&s;ed, that the &s;ale of lands at pre&s;ent when the market hath been glutted from the land of|fices of the &s;everal &s;tates, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be for a very incon&s;iderable price, compared with their actual value, and that price which in the cour&s;e of a very few years they will unque&s;tionably command; prudence then would dictate that they be not offered for &s;ale at the moment they are at the lowe&s;t ebb of depreciation. Let us &s;uppo&s;e the whole &s;old at once; to the full amount
<PB N="7" REF="028459_0006_0FD90C36E3AE6E10">
of the debt, at the price given by tho&s;e who purcha&s;ed &s;everal millions of the late Congre&s;s, which I think was a dollar per acre.&mdash;80,000,000, of acres! more than all Virginia, Kentucky, and the de&s;art between them! probably more than Great Britain contains! more than one third of France, the nur&s;e of 26,000,000 of people! and for what &s;hall this immen&s;e terrritory be given? For a debt which the <HI>pre&s;ent revenues</HI> of the United States can di&s;charge in le&s;s than <HI>eleven years;</HI> and for ten times the amount of which the <HI>&s;ame</HI> territory could not be repurcha&s;ed at the end of that period. What a horrid wa&s;te of national wealth doth this &s;tate|ment pre&s;ent to our view!</P>
<P>Again, if the lands be &s;old, <HI>as heretofore,</HI> in very large tracts, <HI>only,</HI> it will either depreciate, or retard the &s;ale of the remainder, or produce &s;till wor&s;e ef|fects. For if it be &s;old in large tracts to <HI>&s;peculators, who mean to &s;ell again,</HI> they mu&s;t have an <HI>abatement</HI> in the price, that they may be able to make <HI>their pro|fit</HI> upon the &s;peculation.&mdash;Hence a double &s;ource of depreciation; for by this means the quantity at mar|ket will be &s;o much encrea&s;ed, that the di&s;po&s;al of the remainder in the hands of government, mu&s;t de|pend upon the completion of the &s;peculator's &s;chemes, by which he may be encouraged, and enabled to make a new &s;peculation. The purcha&s;ers from the late Congre&s;s are &s;aid to have completed their &s;ales, and are probably ready for a <HI>new &s;peculation</HI> Tho&s;e who purcha&s;ed from them, paid a very con&s;iderable ad|vance, perhaps <HI>double</HI> or <HI>treble</HI> the <HI>real value,</HI> of the fir&s;t purcha&s;e. <HI>Hence</HI> another evil. The indu&s;trious farmer who wi&s;hes to &s;ettle, and to cultivate the lands, <HI>cannot obtain them at prime co&s;t;</HI> being unable to accompli&s;h the purcha&s;e of a larger tract than he means to occupy: <HI>poor men</HI> are therefore wholly <HI>ex|cluded from the market,</HI> which is only open to the <HI>rich who buy to &s;ell again</HI>&mdash;or for <HI>other</HI> purpo&s;es that will be hereafter mentioned. If it be &s;aid that <HI>poor men</HI> may unite them&s;elves in companies, and thus make large purcha&s;es, which they may divide among them|&s;elves, the an&s;wer is, that the <HI>rich</HI> can always out-bid
<PB N="8" REF="028459_0007_0FD90C39660663E8">
them, and will find it their intere&s;t to do &s;o; and this will mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly produce the effect.</P>
<P N="2">2. A precipitate &s;ale of the we&s;tern lands will tend to depopulate the <HI>pre&s;ent &s;tates</HI> in the union, and con|&s;equently <HI>weaken,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>&s;trengthening</HI> the na|tion.</P>
<P>For when we recollect what has already happen|ed by the &s;ettlement of Kentucky, and the territory both &s;outh, and north-we&s;t of the Ohio, under all the di&s;advantages, that have attended &s;uch &s;ettle|ments, we mu&s;t immediately &s;ee, that &s;uch a mea&s;ure would operate as a <HI>drain</HI> from the Atlantic &s;tates, where there is yet a very large portion of lands, uncultivated, which would in all probability be im|proved, if there were not other lands, <HI>reputed</HI> of &s;u|perior quality, to be had <HI>cheaper,</HI> which &s;erve as a temptation to the hu&s;bandman to quit his pre&s;ent e&s;ta|bli&s;hment: this will have the further effect of <HI>depre|ciating the value of lands in tho&s;e &s;tates;</HI> a circum|&s;tance which the <HI>land holders</HI> therein, may con&s;ider as not unworthy of their attention. Nor can it be denied, that in&s;tead of <HI>promoting</HI> and <HI>encrea&s;ing population,</HI> it would only promote a &s;till more <HI>di&s;per&s;ed location,</HI> than already prevails among us: a circum&s;tance not very de&s;irable in a country, where there is more than four times the quantity of land nece&s;&s;ary for the pre|&s;ent number of inhabitants. The improvements of agriculture, and the increa&s;e of population do not al|ways go hand in hand, with the extent of location. On the contrary, in a country not over&s;tocked with inhabitants, the improvements of agriculture increa&s;e with population, and then in their turn contribute not a little to the advancement of commerce, the ac|qui&s;ition of the comforts of life, and the increa&s;e of population,
<Q>"Nam &s;ine Cerere et Baccho fugit Venus."</Q></P>
<P>It is one thing therefore to encourage population and agriculture, and another to &s;ettle an uninhabited country, at the expence of another, not yet &s;ufficient|ly
<PB N="9" REF="028459_0008_0FD90C3F484AE108">
populous. For experience proves, as I have al|ready &s;aid, that population, agriculture, and com|merce mini&s;ter to each other. If this be true, the &s;ale of the we&s;tern lands, may be attended with very &s;erious and pernicious con&s;equences, to the pre&s;ent &s;tates in the union, <HI>in their pre&s;ent &s;tate of population,</HI> without any chance of retribution: for it is obvious, that the application of that labour to the &s;ettlement of a <HI>remote</HI> territory, which might have been advan|tageou&s;ly employed in one more contigious to com|merce, mu&s;t weaken the latter, without producing equal returns from the former; the productions of the tran&s;montani territory, whenever they have a a &s;uperfluity, will find a vent thro' the mouth of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi or the St. Lawrence, and their &s;upplies will be derived from foreign countries thro' the &s;ame chan|nels, to the prejudice of the commerce of the pre&s;ent &s;tates in the union. The remon&s;trances of Kentucky may &s;hew that this is the hope and expectation, of the whole people we&s;t of the Allegheny. The que&s;tion then is, whether the Atlantic &s;tates would do wi&s;ely to pur&s;ue a mea&s;ure, not only tending to depreciate their own lands, but de&s;tructive to their population, and ruinous to their commerce. Were the&s;e di&s;ad|vantages balanced again&s;t the payment of the nation|al debt, from the pre&s;ent funds of the United States, I am inclined to believe they would greatly prepon|derate. For, the national debt, as we have &s;een, may in a few years be di&s;charged, without any addi|tional burthens on the people: and no good citizen will complain of the pre&s;ent, if they be continued for <HI>that purpo&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>What I have &s;aid re&s;pecting the diminution of the commerce of the Atlantic &s;tates, will equally &s;hew the diminution of revenue, ari&s;ing from commerce, in the &s;ame proportion; and this too without any retri|bution, nor &s;hall we gain much from the exci&s;e, in ex|change for the revenue ari&s;ing from commerce, if we may judge from the product of the exci&s;e in tho&s;e parts of the &s;tates which are thinly inhabited: and &s;hould
<PB N="10" REF="028459_0009_0FD90C402884AE40">
Congre&s;s have recour&s;e to <HI>direct</HI> taxes, as the propor|tion of them depends altogether upon the cen&s;us, the inhabitants of the We&s;tern Territory would pay no <HI>more</HI> than if they had remained in their former &s;ettle|ments in the Atlantic &s;tates; but from the difficulties of collection they may pay <HI>le&s;s:</HI> a circum&s;tance not much in favor of the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>If, from what I have &s;aid, it appears that the &s;ale of the we&s;tern lands is not a mea&s;ure of <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> for the redemption of the public debt; if it appear that &s;uch a mea&s;ure at <HI>this time,</HI> would be attended with an immen&s;e wa&s;te of the <HI>national &s;tock of wealth:</HI> if it would tend to depopulate and weaken the Atlan|tic &s;tates: to le&s;&s;en the value of lands therein; to re|tard the improvement of agriculture; to divert com|merce from her pre&s;ent advantageous channels; and to le&s;&s;en the revenue ari&s;ing therefrom; there is yet another point of view in which the &s;ubject may be placed, that may render the expediency of <HI>enticing</HI> the inhabitants of the Atlantic &s;tates, (which fir&s;t <HI>wholly</HI> compo&s;ed, and now <HI>principally</HI> compo&s;e the union) to migrate from thence, and <HI>found new &s;tates, in a different part of the continent,</HI> &s;till more que&s;tion|able. For, if the &s;pirit of migration, already too high in mo&s;t of the &s;tates, be encouraged by the flat|tering pro&s;pect of purcha&s;ing valuable lands at an un|der-rate, it is obvious that as <HI>their</HI> numbers increa&s;e in the <HI>newly formed &s;tates,</HI> the numbers in the <HI>pre&s;ent &s;tates</HI> will <HI>dimini&s;h;</HI> hence, as repre&s;entation and po|pulation are in&s;eparably connected by the con&s;titution of the United States, the repre&s;entation of the <HI>pre|&s;ent &s;tates</HI> in Congre&s;s will <HI>decline,</HI> in proportion as that of the <HI>new &s;tates encrea&s;es.</HI> The con&s;equence is obvious.&mdash;Let tho&s;e who are acquainted with the ra|pid population of Kentucky, her almo&s;t in&s;tantaneous change from a de&s;art di&s;trict of Virginia to be a mem|ber of the federal union, with a repre&s;entation equal to the &s;tate of Georgia, te&s;tify that this is not a ground|le&s;s conclu&s;ion. But I &s;hall be told that European emigrants will &s;ettle this country, without draining
<PB N="11" REF="028459_0010_0FD90C41AD678900">
the pre&s;ent &s;tates of their inhabitants. If this be true, it calls for an additional caution: a rapid popula|tion by people equally &s;trangers to the language, go|vernment, laws, and policy of this country, and to the habits of the people, and of each other, cheri&s;h|ing perhaps inveterate prejudices on every &s;ubject, and bound together by no common tie but that of go|vernment, would probably realize in this we&s;tern he|mi&s;phere the confu&s;ions which &s;imilar cau&s;es are &s;aid to have produced at Babel. Could an union of go|vernment with &s;uch a variegated people be de&s;irable, or capable of being maintained? I think not. If America is to be the a&s;ylum of the fugitives from Europe, there is land in abundance <HI>in the &s;everal &s;tates,</HI> for their accommodation; and by being di&s;tri|buted among the people of the&s;e &s;tates in &s;mall num|bers, they may acquire an earlier acquaintance with the principles of our government, laws, manners, and language than could po&s;&s;ibly be affected in a di&s;|tinct &s;ettlement. One or two generations would ren|der us one people, or if &s;ome ve&s;tiges of difference &s;hould &s;till remain, they would have nothing formida|ble in their a&s;pect.</P>
<P>There remains another light in which this mea&s;ure may be viewed, that in this enlightened age, when a belief in giants, hobgoblins, chimaeras, and other mon|&s;ters of a di&s;tempered brain is completely exploded, I am almo&s;t afraid to mention, le&s;t I &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed to have paid a vi&s;it lately to the cave of <HI>Monte&s;inos,</HI> and to have returned from thence as completely di&s;|ordered in my intellects, as the famous knight of <HI>La Mancha</HI> him&s;elf: But prote&s;ting mo&s;t &s;olemnly that I have not vi&s;ited any &s;uch place, nor, willingly,
<Q><L>"Ate of that in&s;ane root,</L>
<L>"That takes the rea&s;on pri&s;oner."</L></Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;hortly ob&s;erve, that the foundations of the modern ari&s;tocratic families in the various parts of Eu|rope, were laid in the <HI>immen&s;e grants</HI> of <HI>lands,</HI> for|merly
<PB N="12" REF="028459_0011_0FD90C46174D8BB0">
made by princes to their favorites and adherents; which being parcelled out among a dependant tenant|ry, have in proce&s;s of time become baronies, duke|doms, and principalities. If the territory of the Uni|ted States be granted, in like manner, to a few rich, and ambitious men, di&s;po&s;ed to aggrandize them&s;elves and their po&s;terity, the &s;eeds of an ari&s;tocracy will be &s;own, which it will require nothing but time, to bring to a mo&s;t vigorous maturity. If, for example, a fortunate &s;peculator in the funds of the United States &s;hould choo&s;e to realize his wealth, in the pur|cha&s;e of half a million, or a million of acres of land, (and there are tho&s;e, I am told, who can ea&s;ily accom|pli&s;h &s;uch a purcha&s;e,) this property, tran&s;mitted un|impaired for a century or two to his po&s;terity, would probably exhibit in the de&s;cendant of a <HI>&s;cript-monger,</HI> or a <HI>change-alley-broker,</HI> the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of an e&s;tate, equal to that of a Briti&s;h peer, or a German prince; with as numerous a train of <HI>tenants</HI> and <HI>dependants,</HI> at once the <HI>&s;ymbols</HI> and <HI>tools</HI> of his political influence and con&s;equence. I claim no merit for this fancy-piece, if it be called one; I confe&s;s that I am indebt|ed to <HI>three</HI> per&s;ons in the &s;tate of New-York both for the features, and the coloring. There, I am told, that <HI>three</HI> men, &s;olely from con&s;iderations of <HI>dependen|cy,</HI> can influence <HI>as many thou&s;ands.</HI>&mdash;I may be told in triumph, that New-York po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es one of the mo&s;t de|mocratic con&s;titutions of any &s;tate in the Union! Long may it pre&s;erve it, in &s;pite of that latent <HI>poi&s;on</HI> which threatens to convul&s;e, if not de&s;troy it! The only <HI>antidote</HI> will be found in the divi&s;ion and &s;ubdi|vi&s;ion of tho&s;e manors, or <HI>landgravates,</HI> which now confer upon their owners an influence, &s;o incompati|ble with a true republican government; and this can probably be effected in no other mode, than &s;uch as has already been adopted in &s;everal of the &s;tates, viz. the <HI>abolition</HI> of <HI>e&s;tates tail;</HI> of the <HI>preference</HI> to the <HI>male &s;tock;</HI> and of the <HI>right</HI> of <HI>primogeniture:</HI> and <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hing,</HI> in <HI>lieu thereof,</HI> an <HI>equal partition</HI> of <HI>e&s;tates</HI> among <HI>all the children,</HI> or neare&s;t relations of per&s;ons

inte&s;tate.&mdash;And if Congre&s;s have power to e&s;tabli&s;h their regulations in the we&s;tern territory of the Uni|ted States, (of which I &s;ee not much rea&s;on to doubt,) they ought to con&s;titute a part of the <HI>fundamental laws</HI> of that country, whenever it &s;hall be &s;ettled. Without &s;ome &s;uch precaution, I could prophecy;&mdash; but, like Ca&s;&s;andra, I &s;hould be di&s;regarded.</P>
<P>Quitting then this unplea&s;ant anticipation, I &s;hall add a few words more on the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elling the we&s;tern lands, if Congre&s;s proceed to adopt the report of their committee for continuing the pre&s;ent duties un|til the year 1800, or 1802. In this ca&s;e it will be evi|dent from the &s;tatement in the fir&s;t part of this e&s;&s;ay, that <HI>one half</HI> of the national debt may be paid <HI>before</HI> the end of the latter period: con&s;equently the rea&s;ons again&s;t &s;elling the lands at <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> are greatly &s;trength|ened thereby: and at the end of that period, there can be &s;till le&s;s <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> to throw away the lands to re|deem a debt which the <HI>exi&s;ting funds</HI> would redeem in le&s;s than &s;ix years. In <HI>twenty years time, perhaps,</HI> the encrea&s;ing population of the United States may have &s;o far &s;ettled the lands within the limits of the &s;everal States, as to make it expedient to open the land office of the United States, under certain re&s;trictions and limitations. For, I repeat, that there is a wide di&s;tinction between <HI>population</HI> and <HI>location.</HI> In Con|necticut, and perhaps in the other ea&s;tern &s;tates, this di&s;tinction appears to have been well under&s;tood, and wi&s;ely attended to: lands were not &s;uffered to be pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly taken up, in every quarter of the country, according to the caprice of the land-monger. They were laid off into &s;mall town&s;hips, and a &s;econd town|&s;hip was never di&s;po&s;ed of, until the former was &s;ettled. Hence <HI>location</HI> and <HI>population</HI> went hand in hand there: very different was the conduct of Virginia in her grants of lands. The con&s;equence is obvious&mdash; Connecticut is a well peopled &s;tate, where property is divided into &s;mall portions, yet is amply &s;ufficient for the &s;upport of its inhabitants: its agriculture is highly improved, and the conveniencies of life are plentifully di&s;tributed throughout the &s;tate, in nearly equal por|tions.

Virginia on the contrary, appears to be an im|men&s;e de&s;art, in which the traveller here and there meets with &s;ome ve&s;tiges of population, which he loo&s;es &s;ight of again for miles together. Had the &s;ame plan been pur&s;ued there that was in Connecticut, the popu|lation of the &s;tate would probably, for many years to come, have been limited by the Allegheny mountains; nor would &s;he have re&s;igned forty or fifty thou&s;and of her inhabitants to a newly erected &s;tate, becau&s;e her territory was too exten&s;ive, even to &s;upport a &s;afe communication between its &s;everal parts.&mdash;Congre&s;s, it is hoped, whenever they &s;ell the lands, will embrace the example of Connecticut: the We&s;tern Territory will in that ca&s;e become a real &s;ource of wealth and &s;trength to the United States. The following regula|tions will contribute to this end, if duly attended to.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let the lands be divided, as in Connecticut, into &s;mall town&s;hips, not exceeding five thou&s;and, or at the utmo&s;t limits, ten thou&s;and acres. Let them be &s;ub|divided into lots not exceeding two hundred acres.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let it be required that each lot &s;hall be &s;ettled, and improved within a limited time, or become forfeit|ed to the United States.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let the town&s;hips be numbered according to their proximity to the United States now &s;ettled: let not a &s;econd town&s;hip be &s;old, until the former is di&s;|po&s;ed of, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let not more than one hundred town&s;hips, or one million of acres be &s;old in any one year.</P>
<P N="5">5. Let the lands in the &s;everal town&s;hips be &s;ur|veyed, and the lots cla&s;&s;ed according to their value. Let their valuation be publi&s;hed for &s;ix months at lea&s;t before the &s;ale: let them be &s;old &s;eparately in lots, at public auction, to the highe&s;t bidder, but not under the valuation.</P>
<P N="6">6. Let no grant be made until the terms of &s;ale, and of &s;ettlement and improvement have been com|plied with.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="028459_0014_0FD90C516A6DA608">If in addition to the&s;e regulations, the fundamen|tal laws of the <HI>new &s;tates</HI> &s;hall &s;ubject lands to the pay|ment of debts; aboli&s;h intails, the right of priomgeni|ture, and the preference to males; and e&s;tabli&s;h de|&s;cents in parcenary; the evils to be apprehended from the &s;ale of the We&s;tern Territory may be avoided; otherwi&s;e they will be realized.</P>
