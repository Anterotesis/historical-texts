<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> Remarks on the unfriendly a&s;per&s;ions ca&s;t upon the Bapti&s;ts, for refu&s;ing communion with other denomina|tions&mdash;The go&s;pel doctrine of a church, and qualification of the members&mdash;With &s;trictures on Bapti&s;m.</HEAD>
<P>THE Bapti&s;t churches in general, have long been blamed for holding and practi&s;ing what is commonly called <HI>clo&s;e communion,</HI> as if wholly in|con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>chri&s;tian charity,</HI> or that <HI>mutual for|bearance</HI> which the go&s;pel requires: and by &s;ome it is con&s;idered as incompatible with the exi&s;tence of grace; and for which we have been loaded with many reproachful names.</P>
<P>WE are charged of making the want of a <HI>little water only,</HI> a <HI>bar to communion;</HI> and that we are &s;o &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly fond of the <HI>watery</HI> element, that we place the whole of our religion in what they call a mere <HI>circum&s;tance</HI> of the <HI>ordinance of bapti&s;m:</HI> and &s;ome even a&s;&s;ert, that we hold that none can be <HI>&s;aved</HI> without being <HI>immer&s;ed.</HI> And that thereby we put <HI>bapti&s;m</HI> in the place of <HI>redeeming blood.</HI></P>
<P>BUT why &s;uch unfriendly charges? Surely they greatly impeach our doctrinal <HI>principles,</HI> and are perfectly incon&s;i&s;tent with our avowed <HI>&s;entiments</HI> and con&s;tant <HI>practice.</HI></P>
<P>FOR it is too notorious to admit a plea of igno|rance, in any of our opponents, that we con&s;ider no
<PB N="6" REF="021665_0006_0FB4FD9D04ECB630">one as a proper &s;ubject of bapti&s;m, who does not profe&s;s <HI>repentance</HI> towards God, and <HI>faith</HI> in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who does not, in other words, appear to be in a &s;tate of <HI>&s;alvation.</HI></P>
<P>NAY, &s;o far from making bapti&s;m a <HI>&s;aving</HI> ordi|nance, we do not, we cannot, con&s;ider any one as a proper &s;ubject of it, who looks upon it in that light.</P>
<P>BUT however, we de&s;ire to pay a proper defer|ence to that, as well as any other of Chri&s;t's in&s;ti|tutions; and not to treat it as though it was left to our choice, either to practi&s;e or omit it: although we do not con&s;ider it as <HI>e&s;&s;ential to &s;alvation,</HI> yet it is <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to the vi&s;ibility of a go&s;pel church; and to con&s;equently to communion at the Lord's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">able; for that is a church ordinance, and ought never to be admini&s;tered but to members that are in &s;pecial covenant.</P>
<P>I AM per&s;uaded that the Bapti&s;ts are not the only people who believe bapti&s;m to be a <HI>pre-requi&s;ite</HI> to the Lord's &s;upper.</P>
<P>WAS a <HI>Turk</HI> to be brought from <HI>Mecca</HI> to <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> and here &s;hould be convinced o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Mahomet's impo&s;ture,</HI> and become a true <HI>convert</HI> to chri&s;tianity, immediately after &s;hould attend at a Paedo-Bapti&s;t church, it being one of their &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons to cele|brate the &s;acred &s;upper; the &s;olemnity attracts his mind, he &s;ees the beauty of the ordinance, and de|&s;ires to partake in it. Will they permit him? I am per&s;uaded they will not. But what are their rea&s;ons? Is it becau&s;e they do not look upon him as a <HI>Chri&s;tian?</HI> No, for they really do. But do they not believe God has <HI>received</HI> him? Yes, they do. But do they not believe Chri&s;t <HI>communes</HI> with
<PB N="7" REF="021665_0007_0FB4FD9E794C22F8">him <HI>&s;piritually?</HI> They do. How can they then <HI>&s;hut him off?</HI> Doubtle&s;s, becau&s;e they view him to be no baptized, and not a member of any church. Their conduct in refu&s;ing him, would be con&s;i&s;tent with the tendere&s;t feelings of chri&s;tianity. There|fore we do not commune merely as <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> but as &s;uch in a <HI>regular, vi&s;ible, &s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to illu&s;trate the point further, &s;uppo&s;e a mi|ni&s;ter of Chri&s;t was providentially in one of our new towns where were a number of inhabitants, re&s;pec|table on other accounts, but had never been <HI>bap|tized in their infancy,</HI> nor had any church been ga|thered in the place&mdash;he is invited to preach&mdash;his labours are &s;o far &s;ucceeded, that in a few days con|&s;iderable numbers are hopefully brought to the <HI>knowledge of the truth</HI>&mdash;the next Lord's day they de&s;ire him to <HI>break bread</HI> to them. What will he do? Why, it <HI>free communion</HI> is to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, here is a good opportunity for it to operate in its full latitude; for if it be lawful and right to break bread to one that is unbaptized, it may be to a whole &s;ociety. But however, if he be a <HI>Paedobapti&s;t mini&s;ter,</HI> I pre&s;ume he will not be guilty of &s;uch an <HI>irregularity:</HI> nor would a <HI>con&s;i&s;tent Bapti&s;t.</HI> And I feel &s;afe to conclude, that our <HI>Paedobapti&s;t brethren</HI> would not blame us for refu&s;ing communion with &s;uch a &s;ociety, who did not &s;ubmit to bapti&s;m in &s;ome <HI>mode or other,</HI> however amiable their chri&s;tian characters might appear in other re&s;pects.</P>
<P>IF they would acquit us from <HI>blame</HI> in the fore|going in&s;tance, why &s;hould they <HI>fault us</HI> for refu&s;ing communion with tho&s;e that we verily belive have
<PB N="8" REF="021665_0008_0FB4FDA8C76E7F10">never been <HI>baptized</HI> according to Chri&s;t's in&s;tituti|on: for, agreeable to an ancient writer, "They who are not rightly baptized, are, doubtle&s;s, not baptized at all<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bapti&s;mum quumt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> dubio non habent. Turtil. de bap|ti&s;mo, cap. xi. page <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">30.</NOTE>." Wherefore we conclude, that communion does not belong to chri&s;tians merely as &s;uch, but to them as baptized members of &s;ome go&s;pel church.</P>
<P>NEITHER yet &s;hould we be quite &s;afe to open our doors for communion, to all who are in a church &s;tate, and profe&s;s to be baptized.</P>
<P>Therefore, it will be nece&s;&s;ary in the next place, to attend to the <HI>&s;cripture</HI> account of the
<HI>Faith and Order of a Go&s;pel Church.</HI></P>
<P>A GOSPEL church mu&s;t be built upon a go&s;pel plan. Therefore, if we look into the &s;criptures, we &s;hall ea&s;ily perceive, that the church is a &s;ociety of &s;aints, and faithful men and women in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, that are joined together in holy fellow&s;hip, that are incorporated into a vi&s;ible church-&s;tate, and by agreement meet together to carry on the wor&s;hip of God, to glorify him, and edify one another.</P>
<P>THE church does not appear to be national, pro|vincial, or parochial; but truly congregational. It is not built of dead materials, but of <HI>lively &s;tones</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 5.</NOTE>; each of them fitted before they are laid in the build|ing, "&s;o that there is neither hammer nor axe heard in all the hou&s;e while it is in building<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Kings, vi. 7.</NOTE>." how wonderful! how &s;uperb! and yet how exact the model, &s;o that there needed no alteration to bring them altogether with that <HI>exactne&s;s,</HI> that <HI>bone</HI> comes to its <HI>bone.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="021665_0009_0FB4FDAAE380A368">
THE church is called by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> "The pillar and ground of the truth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 3.15.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE go&s;pel rule gives none a right in the church of Chri&s;t, but true believers: <HI>and all that enter not in by</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>the door, are thieves and robbers</HI></P>
<P>THE church is Chri&s;t's m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cal body, which he hath <HI>loved</HI> and <HI>gave</HI> him&s;elf <HI>for,</HI> "that he might &s;anctify and clean&s;e it, with the <HI>wa&s;hing of water by the word</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. 5.25.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IF we wi&s;h to under&s;tand the apo&s;tolic form of a go&s;pel church, we mu&s;t expect to find it in the acts of the apo&s;tles, or &s;ome of their writings. The fir&s;t go&s;pel church that was gathered after the <HI>a&s;cen&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> was that at Jeru&s;alem, which is de|&s;cribed in the following order, "Then they that gladly received his WORD were baptized; and the &s;ame day there were added unto them about three thou&s;and &s;ouls: and they continued <HI>&s;ted&s;a&s;tly</HI> in the <HI>apo&s;tles doctrine and fellow&s;hip</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 3.41, 42.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Ananias</HI> with <HI>Sapphira</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s wife, came and lied to the Holy Gho&s;t, and pretended they were <HI>friends</HI> to Chri&s;t, when they were not, and were both fallen <HI>dead;</HI> great fear tell upon the attending multitude.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 11&mdash;14<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> <HI>"And of the re&s;t dur&s;t no man join him|&s;elf unto them."</HI> (That is, <HI>&s;uch</HI> as they were, ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, hypocritical profe&s;&s;ors.)&mdash; "But <HI>believers</HI> were the <HI>more added unto the Lord</HI> multitudes both of men and women." So early did fal&s;e pretenders try to get a place in the church of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS church at Jeru&s;alem being gathered under the <HI>in&s;piration</HI> of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> may
<PB N="10" REF="021665_0010_0FB4FDAC181F5E88">be con&s;idered as a <HI>model</HI> for all &s;ucceeding ones; every circum&s;tance related concerning it, di&s;covers it to be a body of true believers in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>THE next church gathered by the Apo&s;tles was that at <HI>Samaria,</HI> which exactly agrees with that at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> &mdash;"When they <HI>believed</HI> Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of GOD, and the name of JESUS CHRIST, they were <HI>baptized,</HI> both <HI>men and women."</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 8.12.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE church of <HI>Corinth</HI> al&s;o appears to be in the &s;ame <HI>method;</HI> "Many of the Corinthians <HI>bearing, believed,</HI> and were <HI>baptized."</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts 18.8.</NOTE> The church at <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> was addre&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> as "Saints and faithful in Chri&s;t Je&s;us;" and as tho&s;e who had been <HI>rai&s;ed</HI> from the <HI>dead,</HI> and <HI>quickened by &s;ove|reign grace,</HI> turned from the cour&s;e of this world, delivered from the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> that <HI>worketh</HI> in the <HI>children of di&s;obedience.</HI> The Corinthians "fir&s;t gave their own &s;elves unto the Lord, and unto one another by the <HI>Will</HI> of God."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 8.5.</NOTE> And none can, in a go&s;pel &s;en&s;e, give them&s;elves up in church covenant, till they previou&s;ly give them&s;elves up to the Lord.</P>
<P>I think that no one that is indebted to the New Te&s;tament for his knowledge re&s;pecting a <HI>go&s;pel church,</HI> will try to gain&s;ay the foregoing de&s;cription.</P>
<P>Therefore I would ob&s;erve, that if the foregoing de&s;cription be a &s;criptural repre&s;entation of a go&s;pel church; then con&s;equently, that church that does not agree thereto, is not &s;trictly upon a go&s;pel <HI>plan,</HI> unle&s;s it can be proved, that there are two modes of go&s;pel churches.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="021665_0011_0FB4FDAD838AA1A8">
THAT there may be churches formed, that in many particulars may re&s;emble a go&s;pel church, I wi&s;h not to deny;&mdash;and that in tho&s;e churches there may be many real Chri&s;tians, is a matter I have no de&s;ire to &s;cruple: &s;o I have rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that there are many Chri&s;tians, not un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed to any church.</P>
<P>AGAIN, The Chri&s;tian church is built on Chri&s;t's <HI>authority,</HI> and is &s;upported and defended by the <HI>&s;ame: He</HI> is the <HI>chief corner &s;tone,</HI> on which their &s;piritual building is erected&mdash;"di&s;allowed, indeed, of men&mdash;but cho&s;en of GOD, and precious.&mdash;Therefore, that church that is built on worldly <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hments,</HI> and depends on <HI>civil aid</HI> for its &s;up|port, and defence, is not &s;trictly conformed to the go&s;pel <HI>plan.</HI></P>

<P>IT will doubtle&s;s be granted, that there are many churches in the land&punc; that are not formed according to the foregoing <HI>method,</HI> as may be made evident,
<PB N="12" REF="021665_0012_0FB4FDB085E39D38">and will appear in the following particulars, i. e.

THIS is the <HI>rock</HI> implied in <HI>Peter</HI>'s confe&s;&s;ion. But let us ob&s;erve in the next place the manner of the building to be erected on this rock. A pro|fe&s;&s;ion of faith, in <HI>adults,</HI> in order to their admi&s;&s;ion to &s;pecial communion, is a point generally acknow|ledged: but if this be the only idea that is to be taken, that they &s;tand in the alley and give their tacit con&s;ent to the <HI>articles</HI> and <HI>covenant</HI> read; con|&s;enting to &s;ubject them&s;elves to the rules of any particular church: if this be all that is plead for as nece&s;&s;ary to the building of the church of Chri&s;t, I &s;hall take leave to demur. For mo&s;t per&s;ons that have been educated in the theory of the Chri&s;tian religion, could &s;ub&s;cribe to this <HI>implicit faith:</HI> but tho&s;e members that are fit materials for this &s;piritual building, make a confe&s;&s;ion in &s;ub|&s;tance as Peter did; and this &s;prings fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Chri&s;t revealed in them; <HI>"fle&s;h and blood hath not revealed it unto thee."</HI> Without &s;uch a revelation as this, no per&s;on can be a fit member for a go&s;pel church; neither can they get upon this <HI>rock</HI> without it: for until this is made to their &s;ouls, they do not know God nor Chri&s;t; for it is expre&s;&s;ly declared by Chri&s;t, Mat. xi. 27. <HI>No man knoweth the Son but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father but the Son, and he to whom&s;oever the Son will reveal him.</HI> And if they do not know Chri&s;t, they are not his <HI>&s;heep:</HI> for he &s;ays.

<P>FOR the pre&s;ent let us view the matter in a dif|ferent light: if the <HI>divine rule</HI> will admit of <HI>one</HI> un|regenerate per&s;ons' being received as a <HI>proper mem|ber</HI> of a go&s;pel church, it will of <HI>two;</HI> and it of two, it will of <HI>ten;</HI> and &s;o con&s;equently there may be a whole church and not a true believer in it: but would any one dare to call &s;uch a &s;ociety of people, a church of Chri&s;t? Would it not rather re&s;emble a <HI>&s;ynagogue of &s;atan?</HI> But perhaps it will be objected, that it is not likely &s;uch an in&s;tance ever will take place; &s;urely there is nothing but <HI>divine interpo&s;ition</HI> to <HI>hinder</HI> it, if this method is al|lowed to be <HI>ruleable.</HI></P>
<P>BUT it may be further objected, that a <HI>perfect</HI> church is not to be expected in this imperfect &s;tate. To which I an&s;wer, the <HI>divine rule</HI> requires that <HI>they</HI> be <HI>perfect:</HI> Mat. v. 48. 2 Cor. xiii. 11. Heb. xiii. 21. The que&s;tion is not, whether, after all, we &s;hall not have &s;ome <HI>hypocrites,</HI> or <HI>unregenerate</HI> per&s;ons in the church; but whether we may know|ingly receive &s;uch, or otherways receive them that give no <HI>evidence</HI> to the contrary.</P>
<P>NOW it will be readily granted that the divine rule requires every Chri&s;tian to be <HI>perfect.</HI> But what if &s;ome &s;hould &s;ay. We don't expect Chri&s;tians to be perfect, and &s;o &s;hould take liberty to <HI>indulge</HI> them&s;elves in <HI>&s;in,</HI> could the divine <HI>rule</HI> be plead in
<PB N="18" REF="021665_0018_0FB4FDC72F8F4B00">their favor? Would it not rather &s;tare them in the face? Equally &s;o does the <HI>go&s;pel rule</HI> every <HI>carnal</HI> and <HI>hypocritical profe&s;&s;or.</HI></P>
<P>BUT it may be further objected, that it is the duty of every per&s;on to attend to all the external duties of religion, as means God has appointed for their conver&s;ion. To which I an&s;wer, it is the duty of every rational creature, <HI>immediately to love God,</HI> and that <HI>perfectly</HI> as Gabriel does; for without a <HI>principle of real love</HI> to God, the &s;inner cannot per|form any chri&s;tian duty; for &s;hort of this, his du|ties are like a dead corp&s;e without a &s;pirit: <HI>For the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart:</HI> 1 Tim. i. 5.</P>
<P>IF the go&s;pel directs the &s;inner to a progre&s;&s;ive u&s;e of <HI>means</HI> or <HI>ordinances,</HI> in order to his <HI>conver&s;ion,</HI> then it does not require him immediately to <HI>believe,</HI> or to exerci&s;e evangelical <HI>repentance:</HI> means always precede the <HI>end</HI> for which they were de&s;igned. But to &s;peak plain, every <HI>duty</HI> that the <HI>law</HI> or <HI>go&s;pel</HI> re|quires of any creature, it requires it to be done from a <HI>principle</HI> of &s;upreme <HI>love</HI> to GOD; and without that, all his preten&s;ions to duty are but hypocri&s;y. Prayer, reading of God's word, attending to the word preached, and &s;pecial ordinances (in an order|ly way) are duties held up before every per&s;on: but they are required to attend them with penitent hearts. If the &s;inner attempts to pray with a heart of impenitency and unbelief, he does but deceive him&s;elf and mock God: for his motives can't &s;pring from a higher <HI>&s;ource</HI> than that which <HI>rules his heart,</HI> which is <HI>&s;elflove.</HI> If he attends divine &s;ervice, and
<PB N="19" REF="021665_0019_0FB4FDC8A05C9390">imagines he has been wor&s;hipping God, he does but <HI>deceive him&s;elf:</HI> for they that <HI>wor&s;hip God, wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth;</HI> whil&s;t this in&s;cription might be ju&s;tly written upon his mo&s;t refined acts of <HI>devotion,</HI> To the UNKNOWN GOD. Should he be &s;prinkled from the bapti&s;mal layer, or <HI>immer&s;ed</HI> in Jurdon's &s;welling flood, it would avail him no|thing without a new <HI>heart.</HI> Sould he come to the &s;acred table of our Lord, and receive the outward elements, yet &s;till he does not commune with <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> for <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is <HI>light,</HI> and <HI>he</HI> is <HI>darkne&s;s,</HI> and they have no communion together.</P>
<P>THAT the proclamation of the go&s;pel is to be made in the ears of &s;inners, will be readily granted: and where ever it comes, it makes a demand for the &s;inner immediately to &s;urrender his <HI>heart.</HI> His re|fu&s;al is criminal, and lays him under <HI>condemnation:</HI> John iii. 18. But that the go&s;pel invites impeni|tents, while &s;uch, to partake of its &s;pecial ordinan|ces, I choo&s;e rather to deny; for <HI>unto the wicked God &s;aith, What ha&s;t thou to do to declare my &s;tatutes, or that thou &s;houlde&s;t take my covenant in thy mouth:</HI> P&s;al. l. 16.

Should the que&s;tion be a&s;ked me, Whether it is the duty of a &s;inner to pray, I &s;hould readily an&s;wer, yes; and add, that he mu&s;t pray <HI>in faith; for what&s;oever is not of faith is &s;in:</HI> Rom. xiv. 23. <HI>And without faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God:</HI> Heb. xi. 6.

<P>THE bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t was &s;poken of by Chri&s;t and his Harbinger, as that which had not then taken place.</P>
<P>I think any one would take &s;ingular freedom to &s;ay, that there was then no Chri&s;tians that had ex|perienced the ble&s;&s;ings of grace in an ordinary conver&s;ion; if it be not &s;o, this con&s;equence mu&s;t follow&mdash;That tho&s;e whom Chri&s;t had cho&s;en, &s;ome of whom he had <HI>&s;ent</HI> forth to teach and do miracles, were ignorant of the &s;pirituality of religion, and were &s;till in their <HI>&s;ins.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, further, if the <HI>bapti&s;m</HI> of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> be the one intended, it would exclude water bap|ti&s;m in every mode:&mdash;For we can as ea&s;ily conceive of <HI>two</HI> Lords, as of <HI>two</HI> bapti&s;ms referred to one in&s;titution.</P>
<P>THE doctrine of bapti&s;ms mentioned by the Apo&s;tle, Heb. vi. 2, has no reference to the go&s;pel in&s;titution of bapti&s;m; but is the &s;ame <HI>Greek word</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="021665_0024_0FB4FDDCC8D67768">that is trat &s;lated <HI>Wa&s;hings</HI> in another chapter of the &s;ame epi&s;tle&mdash;Heb. ix. 10. There is a negation fixed to the&s;e bapti&s;ms, and they were to be left, becau&s;e they were <HI>law ceremonies,</HI> and not <HI>go&s;pel in|&s;titutions.</HI></P>
<P>BUT here will a que&s;tion ari&s;e, What are we to under&s;tand by the <HI>bapti&s;m</HI> of the Holy Gho&s;t and fire? &s;poken of by John, Matt. iii. 11, and by Chri&s;t, Acts i. 5. John's words are&mdash;"I indeed baptize you with <HI>water</HI> unto repentance; but <HI>He</HI> that cometh after me is mightier than I, who&s;e &s;hoes I am not worthy to bear; <HI>he</HI> &s;hall <HI>baptize</HI> you with the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t and fire.</HI>" Chri&s;t's words are&mdash;"And being a&s;&s;embled he commanded that they &s;hould not depart from Jeru&s;alem, but wait for the promi&s;e of the Father; which, &s;aith he, ye have heard from me, for John truly baptized with water, but ye &s;hall be baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t, not many days hence." Doubtle&s;s the&s;e, at this time, had as great a mea&s;ure of the Spirit, as Chri&s;tians in general have, and yet were not <HI>baptized</HI> with the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the explanation of the foregoing, we meet with in the beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ning of the next chapter, &s;oon after Chri&s;t's a&s;cen&s;ion, "They were all with one accord in one place, and &s;uddenly there came a &s;ound from Heaven, as of a mighty ru&s;hing wind, and it filled all the hou&s;e where they were &s;itting: and there appeared unto then: <HI>cloven longues like as of fire,</HI> and it &s;at upon each of them, and they were all filled with the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and began to <HI>&s;peak with other tongues,</HI> as the Spirit gave them utterance: Acts ii, 1, 2, 3.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="021665_0025_0FB4FDE2252385C8">
HERE is the Holy Gho&s;t and fire that was men|tioned.&mdash;For Je&s;us was now glorified, and the Holy Gho&s;t according to his promi&s;e given. I think it is far evident, that the bapti&s;m of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t and fire,</HI> did not re&s;pect the <HI>ordinary</HI> influences of God's &s;pirit, either in the conver&s;ion of &s;inners, or in its comforting influences on his people: But mu&s;t re|&s;pect the <HI>extraordinary</HI> and <HI>miraculous gifts</HI> be&s;towed on the <HI>apo&s;tles</HI> and <HI>others,</HI> for the confirmation of the go&s;pel; &s;uch as the gifts of <HI>tongues, healing, prophecying,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>BUT as the&s;e ob&s;ervations may differ from the general opinion of others, therefore I mu&s;t be a little particular. Will any per&s;on dare to &s;ay, that tho&s;e <HI>believers</HI> at <HI>Samaria,</HI> whom <HI>Philip</HI> baptized, were not true converts? If they were not, then <HI>Philip</HI> baptized a number of <HI>unqualified &s;ubjects,</HI> that were &s;trangers to the love of God. If they were <HI>true converts,</HI> I think my ob&s;ervation mu&s;t &s;tand; for it is further ob&s;erved of them, that "when the apo&s;tles that were at Jeru&s;alem, had heard that <HI>Sa|maria</HI> had <HI>received the word of God,</HI> they &s;ent <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> unto them, who grayed for them, that they might <HI>receive</HI> the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> (for as yet <HI>he</HI> was fallen upon <HI>none</HI> of then; only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Je&s;us.) Then laid they their hands on them, and they <HI>received the Holy Gho&s;t:</HI>" Acts viii. 14, 15, 16. The &s;ame idea is further illu&s;trated by St. Paul, who, when "he came to <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> found certain <HI>di&s;ciples,</HI>" and "he &s;aid unto them, Have ye <HI>received the Holy Gho&s;t &s;ince ye believed?</HI>" Their an&s;wer was, "We have not
<PB N="26" REF="021665_0026_0FB4FDE3A9557B60">heard whether there be any Holy Gho&s;t:" Acts xix. 1, 2&mdash;6. The apo&s;tle it &s;eems pre&s;umed, that if they were di&s;ciples, they were baptized; therefore did not enquire, whether they were baptized, but unto <HI>what</HI> they were <HI>baptized.</HI> "And when Paul had <HI>laid his hands</HI> upon them, the Holy Gho&s;t came on them, and they &s;pake with <HI>tongues and prophe&s;ied.</HI>"</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH they had never <HI>heard</HI> of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> in the&s;e miraculous operations, yet they were <HI>di&s;ciples</HI> and <HI>believers.</HI></P>
<P>THEREFORE I think I have a right to this con|clu&s;ion, that the bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t <HI>cea&s;ed</HI> when the&s;e miraculous gifts <HI>cea&s;ed;</HI> and that the <HI>one bapti&s;m</HI> referred to, is <HI>Water-bapti&s;m:</HI> yea, even this <HI>bapti&s;m</HI> of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> never &s;uperceded or de&s;troyed the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Water-bapti&s;m,</HI> as an in|&s;titution of Chri&s;t. See it exemplified, Acts x. 44&mdash;48.</P>
<P>BUT let none conclude I mean to deny that Chri&s;tians have any <HI>influences</HI> of the Holy Gho&s;t in this day; I do not: neither do I believe they were without them when Chri&s;t was upon earth, or even before he came. And yet the&s;e extraordinary in|fluences were not given, for <HI>Je&s;us was not yet glorified.</HI> Therefore the in&s;titution of bapti&s;m &s;tands un&s;ha|ken upon the firm <HI>ba&s;is</HI> of a <HI>divine command,</HI> which will continue it until the end of time, not with&s;tand|ing <HI>many</HI> ancient and modern <HI>corrupters;</HI> Socinians, Quakers. Univer&s;ali&s;ts, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE Bapti&s;ts not only believe that this one bap|ti&s;m is an in&s;titution of Chri&s;t, but that it is ever to be admini&s;tered in one <HI>mode,</HI> and to one kind of

"But our fixed and avowed per&s;ua&s;ion will not permit us to allow, that <HI>infant &s;prinkling,</HI> though performed with the greate&s;t &s;olemnity, is worthy of the name. Con|&s;equently, though they con&s;i&s;tently with their own principles, may receive <HI>us</HI> to communion a|mong <HI>them,</HI> yet we cannot admit them to fellow&s;hip with us at the Lord's table, without contradicting our profe&s;&s;ed &s;entiments. For it appears to us, on the mo&s;t deliberate enquiry, that immer&s;ion is not a <HI>mere circum&s;tance,</HI> or <HI>a mode</HI> of bapti&s;m, but e&s;&s;enti|al to the ordinance: &s;o that in our judgment, he who is not immer&s;ed is not baptized. This is one of our rea&s;ons for refu&s;ing communion to our Pae|dobapti&s;t brethren, whom in many re&s;pects, we highly e&s;teem, and towards whom we think it our duty to cultivate the mo&s;t cordial affection."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Booth's Apol. p. <HI>14.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>WE really believe one <HI>mode</HI> of bapti&s;m to be of <HI>divine</HI> appointment; all others but <HI>human invention.</HI></P>
<P>BUT is this ordinance of our Lord left in &s;uch <HI>ob|&s;curity,</HI> that an hone&s;t mind mu&s;t be always at a lo&s;s how to practice it? To plead this, is to <HI>impeach</HI> Chri&s;t, that he has not been as <HI>faithful</HI> in his <HI>own hou&s;e</HI> as a <HI>&s;on,</HI> as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was as a <HI>&s;ervant:</HI> Heb. iii. 5, 6.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="021665_0028_0FB4FDEA00668A00">
BUT from whence does it appear that bapti&s;m is a duty? Not from any <HI>moral precept,</HI> but from a <HI>po&s;itive in&s;titution.</HI> "All po&s;itive in&s;titutions depend entirely upon the <HI>will</HI> and declaration of the per&s;on who in&s;titutes them, with re&s;pect to the end and de&s;ign of them; and al&s;o the due manner of per|forming them."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letters to Bi&s;hop Hoadley.</NOTE> But are not <HI>po&s;itive in&s;titutions</HI> as plain as <HI>moral precepts?</HI> If &s;o, why do we <HI>blame</HI> the &s;inner for not complying with one, and <HI>excu&s;e</HI> the Chri&s;tian for neglecting the other?</P>
<P>BUT it is &s;aid, they do not neglect it, but only practice it in a different way! But is this different way <HI>divine</HI> in&s;titution, or &s;omething &s;ub&s;tituted in its room? If the former, we may pre&s;ume that it is made plain in the word, as it is not de&s;igned for men of &s;cience only, but for <HI>unlearned men</HI> and <HI>wo|men,</HI> and for babes in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>THE in&s;tance recorded in &s;cripture concerning Saul who was &s;ent to de&s;troy Amaleck, with the prophets reply to him at his return, may &s;erve as a <HI>&s;pecimen</HI> to di&s;cover the <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>effects</HI> of di&s;obe|dience. The command was <HI>po&s;itive,</HI> and was in part obeyed; but "the be&s;t of the &s;heep and oxen were &s;aved alive." But Saul was very confident he had performed the will of the Lord, and thus ad|dre&s;&s;ed Samuel: "Ble&s;&s;ed be thou of the Lord; I have performed the commandment of the Lord:" 1 Sam. xv. 12. And doubtle&s;s <HI>Saul</HI> would have carried his point, had not an in&s;pired prophet with|&s;tood him. It is likely <HI>Saul</HI> had &s;ome &s;pecious
<PB N="29" REF="021665_0029_0FB4FDEC0FABA478">pretences for his conduct: he might flatter him&s;elf that the&s;e &s;heep and oxen might be a large &s;aving of the <HI>property</HI> of I&s;rael; and that to &s;ave them to <HI>do &s;acrifice</HI> to the Lord, was a laudable de&s;ign; he did not pretend he had the lea&s;t regard to <HI>&s;elf</HI> in the whole affair, but was now prudently taking care that <HI>Jeho|vah</HI>'s altar might be loaded with the riche&s;t &s;acrifices. But the prophet &s;oon gave him to under&s;tand, that <HI>obedience</HI> to divine appointments, &s;uch as depend entirely on an <HI>expre&s;s</HI> command, is better in the &s;ight of God than hecatombs of bleeding bea&s;ts, or clouds of &s;moaking incen&s;e: <HI>For rebellion is as the &s;in of witchcraft, and &s;tubbornne&s;s is as iniquity and idolatry:</HI> 1 Sam. xv. 23.</P>
<P>WHEN the children of I&s;rael were returned from their captivity, they gathered them&s;elves to Ezra the &s;cribe, to be in&s;tructed in their duty out of the law&mdash;"And they found written in the law which the Lord had commanded by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> that the chil|dren of I&s;rael &s;hould dwell in <HI>booths</HI> in the fea&s;t of the &s;eventh month: Neh. viii. 14." This was a <HI>po&s;itive in&s;titution,</HI> and ju&s;tly claimed the <HI>obedience</HI> of all I&s;rael. But notwith&s;tanding this, it was not kept in the in&s;tituted way, from the days of <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> until the days of Nehemiah. Was the in&s;titution to blame for their neglect, or mu&s;t the blame fall on them? On them &s;urely. But might not &s;ome plau&s;ible objections be made again&s;t reformation? What if &s;ome had a&s;ked the que&s;tion&mdash;"If this be &s;o, why did none of the <HI>learned fathers</HI> find it out? Were not <HI>Samuel, David, Solomon, Jeho&s;haphat, A&s;a. Jo&s;iah</HI> and <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> all good men? and they did
<PB N="30" REF="021665_0030_0FB4FDF334EA6AD0">not keep this fea&s;t in booths." What if others had &s;aid, "we do not under&s;tand the word <HI>booths</HI> in &s;uch a point of light&mdash;a <HI>booth</HI> means a &s;ort of tent, the de&s;ign of which is to &s;creen us from the &s;corch|ing beams of the &s;un, and defend us from the inju|ries of the weather; and as our hoo&s;es an&s;wer the&s;e purpo&s;es, we e&s;teem it lawful for us to eat this fea&s;t in them."</P>
<P>BUT what would all the&s;e objections, and many more that might be made, avail in the mind of a man who was de&s;irous for reformation, and had his eyes open to read in the law of the Lord? "It was found <HI>written</HI> in the law of the Lord;" therefore it was a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for every one to engage in reformation, who&s;e heart was brought to love the law of his God.</P>
<P>WE profe&s;s to take the word of GOD, for a per|fect rule of faith and practice; if &s;o, we are not to follow the opinions of the be&s;t of men, though ever &s;o learned and great, any further than they follow Chri&s;t, or walk according to his in&s;titutions; "to the law and the te&s;timony," this is our only guide in matters of religion. And from hence we find, that bapti&s;m is a <HI>po&s;itive in&s;titution</HI> of Chri&s;t, left in his church for the benefit of <HI>his</HI> people; concerning which we can know nothing but from the revealed will of the Great Lawgiver. Had the bapti&s;m of <HI>unbelievers</HI> been intended, it would have been <HI>declar|ed;</HI> if it was either <HI>expre&s;&s;ed</HI> or <HI>implied,</HI> the <HI>apo&s;tles</HI> mu&s;t have under&s;tood it, and their <HI>practice</HI> would have di&s;covered it; of which nothing certain has ever yet been made to appear.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="021665_0031_0FB4FDF3FB87DA58">
IF &s;prinkling had been the <HI>divinely appointed mode,</HI> it would be rational to expect to find it exemplified in &s;cripture; and that in&s;tead of their going <HI>to the water,</HI> that they brought the <HI>water to them.</HI> "It behoves us therefore, well to con&s;ider the rule which our Lord has given relating to this ordinance."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Booth's Apol. p. <HI>24.</HI></NOTE> "Becau&s;e we can have <HI>no other</HI> direction in the&s;e &s;ort of duties, unle&s;s we have recour&s;e to mere in|vention, which makes them our own <HI>in&s;titutions,</HI> and not the in&s;titutions of him who fir&s;t appointed them."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">B.

<P>THEREFORE we find, after the mo&s;t deliberate enquiry that there is &s;uch a <HI>real</HI> difference in our &s;entiments and practice, that what the <HI>Paedobapti&s;ts</HI> believe and practice for bapti&s;m, is &s;o <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> dif|ferent from Chri&s;t's appointment, that in our opi|nion it <HI>cannot</HI> be bapti&s;m.</P>

<P>SHOULD all that has been ob&s;erved in the preceding pages be a&s;&s;ented to, yet this que&s;tion may be put: Cannot the Bapti&s;t churches <HI>commune</HI> with the <HI>Paedobapti&s;ts,</HI> where they obtain &s;atisfacti|on that they are <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and are <HI>&s;incere?</HI> The brother propo&s;ing to commune informs the church to whom he applies, that he has rea&s;on to <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> he was baptized in his infancy, and has never &s;een it to be his <HI>duty,</HI> to be baptized &s;ince.&mdash;Did he but &s;ee it to be duty, he would cordially comply with it; but as he does not, de&s;ires to partake with them as he is.</P>
<P>WHAT can the church do? Mu&s;t the man be debarred from doing his duty in one in&s;tance, be|cau&s;e he cannot &s;ee it in another? Or will they drag him into the <HI>water,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>light</HI> of his own con&s;cience? Surely not the latter. Some rea&s;ons mu&s;t be given or the man ought to be received. But what is the ground of his application? Why, he is a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> and is <HI>&s;incere,</HI> and he is <HI>baptized</HI> to him&s;elf, or he con&s;iders him&s;elf &s;o.</P>
<P>THAT he is a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> the church is <HI>fully &s;atisfi|ed;</HI> and that he may be <HI>&s;incere,</HI> they do not pretend to deny; but <HI>&s;incerity</HI> is not the <HI>term</HI> of communi|on: out being <HI>conformed</HI> to the apo&s;tle's <HI>doctrine</HI> and <HI>coutinuing &s;tedfa&s;tly therein:</HI> Acts ii. 42.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="021665_0033_0FB4FDFBA8C915F8">
IF &s;incerity be the <HI>term of communion,</HI> why might not Paul have been admitted when he was a mem|ber in good &s;tanding in the <HI>Jewi&s;h church?</HI> But it may be objected that he per&s;ecuted the &s;aints of JESUS: it is true; but who can challenge his &s;incerity from his own declaration? <HI>I verily thought with my&s;elf that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Je&s;us of Nazareth:</HI> Acts xxvi 9.

<P>BUT it may be profitable here to have recour&s;e to the &s;cripture doctrine in this matter, and it that ap|proves of &s;uch a line of conduct, we ought to drop the di&s;pute; it not, to contend earne&s;tly for this article of the Chri&s;tian faith.</P>

<P>LET us next con&s;ider the order of <HI>words</HI> in the great commi&s;&s;ion: when a ri&s;en Saviour tells his di&s;ciples, "ALL POWER is given to me in hea|ven and in earth, go ye therefore and teach all nati|ons, BAPTIZING them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t; teaching them to OBSERVE ALL THINGS WHATSO|EVER I HAVE COMMANDED YOU:" Mat. xxviii. 18, 19, 20. The fir&s;t article of the com|mi&s;&s;ion is, to teach, then&mdash;what? To <HI>baptize,</HI> or to <HI>admini&s;ter the Lord's &s;upper?</HI> let every con&s;cience judge.</P>
<P>LET us next con&s;ider the <HI>apo&s;tolic practice.</HI> It is very evident the apo&s;tles under&s;tood our Lord in the &s;en&s;e for which we plead, and practiced accord|ingly.
<PB N="36" REF="021665_0036_0FB4FE0382153400">For when a number were "pricked to the heart, and erred, Men and brethren what &s;hall we DO?

The willing converts followed his direction; "Then they that gladly received his word were <HI>baptized.</HI>"</P>
<P>THE next &s;tep was, to <HI>join them&s;elves to the church,</HI> and afterwards they broke bread. This is apo&s;tolic <HI>order,</HI> and cannot be denied, without contradicting the <HI>oracles</HI> of truth.</P>

<P>Another argument made u&s;e of in favor of <HI>free communion</HI> is, that if they are GOD'S children, <HI>he</HI> communes with them; and if &s;o, it would be &s;u|per&s;tition for any to refu&s;e to come to the &s;acred

<P>ANOTHER argument made u&s;e of by them who plead for <HI>open communion</HI> is, that we can join in prayer, either in our families or in public, with Paedobapti&s;ts, or can hear them preach occa&s;ionally, and yet after all, cannot come to the Lord's table with them.

I PRESUME it will be a given point, that circum|ci&s;ion was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for every male, in order to partake at the pa&s;chal &s;upper; this was not the effect of any bigoted notion in the I&s;rael|lies, but by a po&s;&s;itive command of Jehovah: Exod. xii. 48.

<P>OUR Lord, though he warned his hearers again&s;t the pride and hypocri&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, the unbelief and covet|ou&s;ne&s;s of the Phari&s;ees and Scribes, yet exhorted the people to regard the truths they delivered:
<PB N="41" REF="021665_0041_0FB4FE175333EC90">Mat. xxiii. 1, 2, 3. Yet would any a&s;&s;ert that our LORD would have admitted the&s;e Eccle&s;ia&s;tics to communion in &s;pecial ordinances?&mdash;When the beloved di&s;ciple &s;aid, "Ma&s;ter, we &s;aw one ca&s;ting out devils in thy name, and we forbad him, becau&s;e he followed not with us:" Je&s;us an&s;wered, "For|bid him not; for he that is not again&s;t us, is for us:" Luke ix. 49, 50.

<P>ANOTHER argument made u&s;e of in favor of open communion, is the con&s;equences that will follow upon clo&s;e communion, i. e. that if Chri&s;ti|ans cannot commune together in this world, how can they expect to enjoy fellow&s;hip together in Heaven.</P>
<P>THIS is &s;omething very frightful indeed! that there mu&s;t be too heavens for &s;eparate &s;pirits!</P>
<P>BUT this may be an&s;wered by attending to a few things. Who would dare to anathematize all tho&s;e who deny the u&s;e of both ordinances?

<P><PB N="42" REF="021665_0042_0FB4FE18C00101D0">
BUT the&s;e objections mu&s;t appear of no weight to the candid. For where is there a church of any denomination that there is not &s;uch difference of opinion in &s;ome things among them, as at &s;ome times to produce trials, and at others, &s;harp con|tencions? And yet may we not &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>one</HI> heaven will hold them all after death?

<P>THE la&s;t thing that I &s;hall con&s;ider which is brought as a plea for open communion is, that the &s;cripture account of bapti&s;m is left in &s;uch darkne&s;s and ambiguity, both as to the &s;ubjects and mode, that nothing certain can be determined. Therefore it calls for our charity towards them who differ from us. It may be remembered, that when the talents were committed to the &s;ervants to occupy, the two that improved made no complaints; the other had got a <HI>hard</HI> ma&s;ter, an <HI>au&s;tere</HI> man; a great many difficulties &s;tood in the way of duty. That the bapti&s;m of infants is not made plain, we &s;hall not deny: but, that believers were baptized, is as plain as words can make it; and &s;hines through the new-te&s;tament as if written with a <HI>&s;un-beam.</HI> If &s;prinkling be the mode intended in the new-te&s;tament, we mu&s;t concede to the propo&s;ition, that it is not made plain.
