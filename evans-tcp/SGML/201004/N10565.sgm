<HEAD>THE ARIANS and SOCINIANS MONITOR.</HEAD>
<P>INURED to &s;elf-deceptions from my youth up, I laughed at the fanta&s;tical whims of enthu&s;ia&s;tic whigs, the dreams of Anabapti&s;ts, and cunning inventions of mer|cenary Prie&s;ts; or cranumian phanta&s;ms of weak and un&s;table men; for by &s;uch names I was plea&s;ed to call the glorious doctrines of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel. The doctrine of the trinity in unity I contemned, purely becau&s;e I could not fully comprehend it.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on, &s;aith I, is the touch&s;tone of every truth; the even balance in which revelation mu&s;t be weighed. The oracle of GOD mu&s;t be hu&s;hed in &s;ilence, till rea&s;on, adorable rea&s;on is free to &s;peak her mind: Even then it is at the peril of revelation to utter, one word that is be|yond the reach of our Godlike rea&s;on. Every thing that is divinely my&s;terious I am wont to treat with deri&s;ion and contempt. My&s;teries in religion! &s;aith I, mere non&s;en&s;e! There is no|thing my&s;terious in it, nothing my&s;terious re|quired to be believed. Rea&s;on alone, that noble
<PB N="4" REF="013390_0003_0F9094810E99F9E0">principle, mu&s;t give the &s;anction to every truth divine. If illu&s;trious rea&s;on will not conde&s;cend to &s;ign a certificate for truth, let her wander as a vagabond upon the face of the earth; no rea|&s;onable chri&s;tian, &s;ure will venture to receive her.</P>
<P>Let fanatics and enthu&s;ia&s;ts receive and re|ly on what they call holy my&s;teries, for my own part I am determined that my rea&s;on &s;hall act &s;upreme with me, both in matters of faith and practice.</P>
<P>Thus elevated with a high opinion of my rational faculties, and pregnated with the &s;tronge&s;t re&s;olutions never to admit of any other rule but the dictates of my own rea&s;on, one evening lately I walked abroad into the fields to meditate on the happy e&s;tate of man|kind, as being capable of meriting, at the hands of the omnipotent, a right to every divine donation, every eternal ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>The road which I took led me into a plea|&s;ant avenue, on the one hand decorated with an uniform row of well grown oaks, extend|ing their &s;preading arms almo&s;t to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the verdant path, and cla&s;ped with the &s;upple branches of yielding elms, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">n an even row decorated the hedge on the left, a gra&s;&s;y turf, barely &s;heered by the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">mble teeth of the bleating &s;heep, &s;pread the fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">or of the evenue ten yards in breadth; every &s;ully|ing excrement was carefully &s;wept up by the yielding broom of the indu&s;trious &s;hepherd,
<PB N="5" REF="013390_0004_0F909484F48DF2F0">who watchfully followed the fleecy innocents.</P>
<P>Thus alone, &s;ecluded from the noi&s;e of mankind I began to improve what I beheld in this plea&s;ant but lone&s;ome avenue.</P>
<P>How beautifully, thought I, do the&s;e &s;tately oaks, with their &s;treight and &s;olid, their &s;mooth and ma&s;&s;y trunks, extended arms, and cloathed branches, repre&s;ent the man, the happy man, that is fixed in rational ideas and guided only by the dictates of his rea&s;on. See how the penetrating roots dig deep into the bo&s;om, and with their forked talons cla&s;p the entrails of their mother earth; the grizly &s;tem &s;miles at the angry rage of &s;tormy gu&s;ts which wreak their vengeance again&s;t it. It &s;tands unmoved. It mocks the fury of the mo&s;t violent &s;torm. Ju&s;t &s;o is the man who makes rea&s;on his only rule. Nothing moves him. He &s;miles at the gu&s;ts of enthu&s;ia&s;tic zeal. He laughs at the dreams of fanatics, and mocks at the my&s;teries of <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin.</HI> His mind lays deep hold of directing rea&s;on, and he &s;tands in his paradi&s;aical rectitude.</P>
<P>The&s;e dwarfi&s;h &s;hrubs (continued I) are the lively types of pedantick bigots, who are blindly carried away with enthu&s;ia&s;tic fancies to believe in irrational my&s;teries, called by them the doctrines of grace, but which really are the &s;ubtil inventions of de&s;igning men; as the &s;hrub is diminutive when compared with the &s;tately oak, &s;o are tho&s;e men when compared with the&s;e who are the happy di&s;ciples of rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="013390_0005_0F909488066D2828">
As I thus continued plea&s;ing my&s;elf with this improvement of my evening &s;olitude, and ble&s;&s;ing GOD that I was not as other men, even as the&s;e fanatics and irrational chri&s;tians are, but believed and acted according to the dictates of my own rea&s;on, I came near to the end of the avenue, and the path be|came extremely dark and narrow. The op|po&s;ite trees did &s;o interweave their branches with each other, that no gleam of light could penetrate through the &s;hade.</P>
<P>It would now have appeared wi&s;dom to have turned my face towards home; but by &s;ome un&s;een power I was &s;eized with a perfect &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of thought, and heedle&s;ly, walked forward, till at la&s;t I found I had got out of the avenue, and a du&s;ky light appearing, di&s;|covered to me a variety of frightful objects. The place into which I was now got bore the grizly a&s;pect of a fore&s;t devoured by fire: No blooming flower nor verdant leaf was to be &s;een in all its va&s;t extent. Only de&s;olation and de&s;truction. All, all was deva&s;tation.</P>
<P>I attended occa&s;ionally to the fearful noi&s;e, that as I thought were, and afterwards proved to be, &s;ubterraneous. Sometimes I heard, like the noi&s;e of many waters, the tempe&s;tuous roaring of foaming billows, in fury da&s;hing them&s;elves again&s;t the &s;cornful rocks. Anon, I heard the clinking of chains, the clangor of weapons, and the hideous yellings of per&s;ons in exqui&s;ite torments. Great was the &s;urprize
<PB N="7" REF="013390_0006_0F909489C70F4BF8">was now in; my hair &s;tood erect, and the blood in my veins became cold as the northern ice, my fle&s;h &s;huddered on my bones, an un|u&s;ual tremor invaded my once courageous heart, and ga&s;tly fear &s;at trembling on my a&s;toni&s;hed countenance. My nerves became lax, and in my apprehen&s;ion, the joints of my limbs were unhinged, and dewy &s;weat i&s;&s;ued forth from every pore of my &s;kin. I had nei|ther courage to &s;tand the &s;hock, nor &s;trength to fly from the awful appearances of immi|nent danger. I would gladly have found the avenue through which I entered this &s;olitary wa&s;te; but to no purpo&s;e did I look for it, now it was hid from my &s;ight.</P>
<P>In vain I wi&s;hed that my rambling fancy had been better guarded, and not expo&s;ed me to the&s;e nocturnal dangers. Long e'er now the radient &s;un having quenched his fiery beams in the we&s;tern depths, and left the earth enveloped in darkne&s;s, which glooming &s;at on every beclouded object. Nor did the Heavens above my head bear a more plea&s;ant a&s;pect; every luminous body having hid its re|fulgent face in the bo&s;om of a &s;able extended cloud. All the&s;e circum&s;tances concurring to di&s;play the horrors of the place, made me conclude that I was certainly got into the gloomy regions of inexorable Pluto; but whether I was dead or alive I knew not. In the mean while I wi&s;hed, I earne&s;tly wi&s;hed my&s;elf at home, and re&s;olved that if
<PB N="8" REF="013390_0007_0F90948D1EB5C548">ever I reached my peaceful habitation, I would henceforth correct my wandrings, and regu|late them by the judicious rules of &s;afety.</P>
<P>As I was turning over the&s;e re&s;olves, I heard a terrible &s;ubterraneous noi&s;e, infinitely mote horrible than that fabulou&s;ly, a&s;cribed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">o Vulcan's &s;miths, in the convul&s;ive bowels of the mounts Aetna and Ve&s;uvius.&mdash;Anon, the earth opened her jaws clo&s;e by the place on which I trembling &s;tood, and belched forth an hedious quantity of curling &s;moak and &s;tricked fire intermingled with &s;qualid &s;pectres, the firey &s;moke lifted up its grizly &s;ummit, like the towering head of a cloud-piercing pyramid. When the &s;pectres had reached the middle path of the aerial regions they &s;unk downward, and plunged into the belch|ing throat that had ju&s;t now di&s;gorged them. Still it continued with hideous roarings to vomit up brim&s;tone, &s;moke and coals of fire, mingled with the howling gho&s;ts of the accur&s;t to the&s;e aby&s;mal flames, Notwith&s;tanding this fearful phaenomena was enough to have &s;pread di&s;traction o'er all my rea&s;onable facul|ties, I found my&s;elf, to my own amazement, in the perfect u&s;e of my mind, frightened although I was.</P>
<P>Movele&s;s I &s;tood on the dangerous brink of the i&s;&s;uing pit, nor had power to turn me to the right hand or left. One &s;tep forward would have plunged me into the&s;e devouring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> which proceeded from the unquencha|ble
<PB N="9" REF="013390_0008_0F90948D5AFA95F0">burnings beneath. Here I &s;tood trembling with fear of the dire event. The eruption begining to abate; I heard, as I thought, hu|man voices more di&s;tinctly, all was howling and &s;orrowful complaint. Dreadful was the yell that filled my ears. All which I looked on as the mo&s;t perfect indications of inexpre&s;|&s;ible torments. Weepings and wailings which I heard, I concluded were the &s;ure diagno&s;tics of con&s;ummate pain.</P>
<P>The eruption being now over, I thought I heard a voice which was familiar to me, and which expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t intolerable angui&s;h. Being by this time &s;omewhat inured to this prodigy, I at la&s;t ventured to look down to make what di&s;coveries I could. O horrible! here was a di&s;covery that qua&s;hed rea&s;on it&s;elf. Amazement chills my blood even now when I relate it.</P>
<P>I looked down into this frightful cave: But what did I &s;ee? No gilded beauties, but the &s;tupendous arches of dread perdition. O! &s;hall the direful idea ever be era&s;ed from my mind? A rolling flood of flaming liquid did play in the&s;e &s;able, the&s;e frightful vaults. Every revolving billows turned up to the in|flammatory &s;urface an innumerable company of floating &s;pectres, and at the &s;ame time with its &s;inking front immerged a number equal to that it turned up. Dreadful was the howl, in|expre&s;&s;ible were their direful yellings! I &s;aw likewi&s;e &s;tanding on this burning lake a num|berle&s;s
<PB N="10" REF="013390_0009_0F90948DE2EED348">company of &s;qualid infernals, armed with flaming in&s;truments of death, with which they exerci&s;ed the mo&s;t unaccountable cruelty on the unhappy worldings, who had involved them&s;elves into un&s;peakable torment, inex|tricable ruin.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of all, I behold one per&s;on who &s;tood for &s;ome time on the &s;ulphurous billows, &s;urrounded by an enraged company, who with red hot irons kept pu&s;hing again&s;t him. He &s;tood agha&s;t, and fearfully &s;tared at me. He looked as if he would fain have &s;poken, but I perceived that his torments pre|vented him. He waved his hand to his tor|mentors, as I took it, begging for re&s;pite.</P>
<P>Deep de&s;pair and wild di&s;traction lowered on his condemned countenance. He raved! he foamed! he wre&s;tled! and then &s;unk down in &s;ilent de&s;pair; &s;ullen and pen&s;ive, whil&s;t the direful floods of omnipotent vengeance rolled upon him.</P>
<P>In this place I perceived no intermi&s;&s;ion of the ince&s;&s;ant floods that rolled along in one continued circle, ever running, but never at an end. The&s;e di&s;coveries, I tru&s;t, will make me ever fearful of landing in this place of torment.</P>
<P>At la&s;t he lift him&s;elf up from the flaming bed, waved his hand, and called me by my name; and fixing my eye intently upon him, I knew him to be the learned Doctor&mdash; with whom I had lived as a pupil, who died &s;ome few years ago.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="013390_0010_0F90948E8D71C1D8">
Amazed to &s;ee my venerable tutor in &s;uch a deplorable condition, I cried out, "O hor|rible! what do I &s;ee! my learned, my pious tutor in hell! Am I not a&s;leep, deceived by my deluding fancy? It cannot be he! A man, who&s;e doctrine and conver&s;ation was &s;o go|verned by the dictates of rea&s;on, cannot be in hell. No, it can never be! Thou tormented gho&s;t, I adjure thee by the greate&s;t of names to undeceive me! Art thou he! Am I in a dream or not? Is that!&mdash;but I cannot doubt it.&mdash;Tell me, is that the receptacle of the damned?"</P>
<P>To which the gho&s;t replied. "Deceived mortal, I &s;ee you are &s;urprized to find a per|&s;on in hell, who in life you e&s;teemed as highly as an apo&s;tle. You &s;ee I am not, as you vainly fancied, in the heavenly man&s;ions of eternal felicity; but, after all my preten&s;ions to &s;anctity, am &s;wallowed up unhappily, I am plunged into the unfathomable aby&s;s of divine indignation, from whence, alas! there is no redemption. No, it cea&s;eth now! It cea&s;eth for ever. Ten thou&s;and worlds, if <HI>I</HI> had them now, for one twelve-months re&s;pite. But oh! there is no re&s;pite; no intermi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e intolerable pains. Oh! piercing, pierc|ing pain! more violent far than fire, than burning coals of juniper. Here the keen ar|rows of incen&s;ed ju&s;tice, the irre&s;i&s;table wrath of a holy God do pierce me through with un&s;peakable &s;orrows. Oh! that <HI>I</HI> had never
<PB N="12" REF="013390_0011_0F90948F560033C0">been born! O that <HI>I</HI> had never been a de|ceiver! O that <HI>I</HI> had been a hu&s;bandman, a ploughman, or any thing but a preacher. Alas! a preacher, a fal&s;e preacher, endureth a double hell! Oh! unhappy, wretched preacher, that is rewarded in this fiery gulph!</P>
<P>Ye deluded &s;pirits, who by my fallacious deceit have been blinded, and are hither got before me, forbear, O forbear to throw your flaming darts again&s;t me. Why, O why do you thus torment me? Have not I torment enough already? Sure <HI>I</HI> have affliction enough in &s;u&s;taining the &s;hocks of omnipotent ven|geance, without your malicious piercing arrows being pointed at me. Woful day! accur&s;ed hour! that ever <HI>I</HI> denied the Lord, the om|nipotent Saviour.</P>
<P>Bear with me thou deceived mortal, for my pains force words from me, words that are unknown on earth. Oh for a few moments re&s;pite whil&s;t <HI>I</HI> &s;peak to a friendly mortal, and make known to him the horrors of this place! Ye my tormentors, allow me time only, &s;o much time, as to recite the journal of one twenty-four hours of my unhappy being; grant me this &s;mall favour, it may be the la&s;t <HI>I</HI> &s;hall reque&s;t of you through the revolving ages of a never ending eternity. An hour's intermi&s;&s;ion, O my tormentors! it cannot in any wi&s;e prejudice you, whereas to me it may be of great advantage.</P>
<P>Hold! do hold, your hands, whil&s;t <HI>I</HI> declare
<PB N="13" REF="013390_0012_0F909490159880E0">unto others what hath befallen a Socinian apo&s;tle.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee Mr.&mdash;, <HI>I</HI> cannot, by the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing entreaties, obtain &s;o long a re&s;pite from my torment as to communicate to you what hath befallen me; but in the mid&s;t of un&s;peakable &s;orrow am obliged to conver&s;e with you, for my tormentors are in|exorable.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> lived as you know to advanced years a|mong&s;t you, and your general opinion was, that <HI>I</HI> was gathered to my people in a good old age. Oh, the fatal mi&s;take! an old age indeed, but alas! a bad old age it has proved. When the harbinger of my death began to vi&s;it me, my anxious pupils mini&s;tered un|wearied attendance. My fellow-teachers duly payed their mo&s;t tender regard, by praying for and conver&s;ing with me. Both they and <HI>I,</HI> were apprehen&s;ive that my &s;ickne&s;s was un|to death, my di&s;&s;olution near approaching.</P>
<P>All proper means were u&s;ed for my relief, but all in vain. No lengthening out of our days beyond the limits of God's decree; no, for he hath numbered our days, and our months are with him; he hath &s;et bounds to our habitation that we cannot pa&s;s over it. Phy&s;ic affording no relief, my pupils were di&s;|con&s;olate; they thought <HI>I</HI> was the mo&s;t a|po&s;tolic teacher in the world, and if death &s;hould cruelly bereave them of me, they knew not how to repair their lo&s;s, nor who was
<PB N="14" REF="013390_0013_0F909490DE1A63F0">worthy to &s;upply my place, when as they thought, I &s;hould be employed in the more immediate pre&s;ence of the infinite JE|HOVAH.</P>
<P>My friends mi&s;erably comforted me with my &s;uppo&s;ed good works. O &s;ir! &s;ay they, how comfortably may you die, when you con&s;ider the great deliverances you have wrought for the church. You have relieved her rea&s;onable members from the irrational doctrines of <HI>Calvini&s;m,</HI> overturned original &s;in, and the doctrine of imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s by your valuable books, which no man but your|&s;elf could have wrote. Therein you &s;hewed mo&s;t excellently, how that man is capable to atone for his own &s;ins, and to work out his own &s;alvation from &s;in and wrath.</P>
<P>As they &s;aid, &s;o <HI>I</HI> fooli&s;hly believed, that the&s;e antichri&s;tian here&s;ies were merito|rious in the &s;ight of God. <HI>I</HI> depended greatly on the opinions of men, and thought that my humility, &s;elf-denial, and charity, would be a prevalent plea before the throne of the Almighty.&mdash;<HI>I</HI> thought on my death-bed that <HI>I</HI> felt a great deal of joy and comfort on look|ing back and viewing a well &s;pent life, as mine at that time appeared to be. <HI>I</HI> tru&s;ted in my own holine&s;s, and the mercy of God; but alas! <HI>I</HI> have &s;ince learned that <HI>I</HI> had none of the former, and that the latter doth not flow in the channel <HI>I</HI> &s;ought for it in.</P>
<P>In my latter hours <HI>I</HI> enjoyed compo&s;ure of
<PB N="15" REF="013390_0014_0F9094918FB220A0">mind, from an expectation that my pure na|ture would &s;oon be tran&s;lated to the ethereal climate, where nothing but holine&s;s can dwell. Not in the lea&s;t mi&s;tru&s;ting a fal&s;e treacherous heart, that has undone me, but vainly fancied <HI>I</HI> &s;tood in paradi&s;aical rectitude. O the deceit! O the fallacy of my hope, which lulled me a&s;leep in delu&s;ive fancies. My &s;oul conceived &s;uch elevated notions of the divine reward, which <HI>I</HI> thought <HI>I</HI> had merited by my labours, that &s;he longed for the di&s;&s;olving moment of &s;eparation, tru&s;ting in the clemency of the go&s;pel lawgiver, who <HI>I</HI> thought would bend his law and ju&s;tice to &s;uit the circum&s;tances of his rea&s;onable creatures. O dreadful! how &s;hall <HI>I</HI> relate it? the hour! the appointed hour, the de&s;tined moment of &s;eparation drew nigh.&mdash;My &s;olicitous &s;oul intreated the pale, the gha&s;tly me&s;&s;enger, to cut &s;hort his work, and make a &s;peedy di&s;&s;olution of the mortal union. Reluctant nature &s;truggled again&s;t the fermenting poi&s;on of the cankered arrow of nature's de&s;troyer.</P>
<P>Convul&s;ive pangs invaded the nervous fa|bric, and half per&s;uaded the weary heart to forbear to throb. Anon, nature, which ju&s;t before &s;eemed to be vanqui&s;hed by the preva|lency of the fever, recruits its &s;trength and mu&s;tereth all its powers to re&s;i&s;t, as long as might be, the unfru&s;trable rage of rapacious death. But alas! the time the unhappy moment arrives! Vanqui&s;hed nature doth at la&s;t &s;ubmit,

My deceived gho&s;t came &s;miling forth, in full expectation of the righteous reward. But &s;oon alas! too &s;oon was &s;he convinced of her fatal mi&s;take. No &s;ooner arrived &s;he at the pale portal of the lifele&s;s lips, but &s;he beheld&mdash;Oh! how &s;hall <HI>I</HI> name it!&mdash;She beheld&mdash;O horrible! &s;he beheld a company of devils in the cham|ber waiting to carry her hence.&mdash;Precipitately back &s;he turned to &s;eek for &s;anctuary in the de&s;erted body&mdash;but now alas! the gates of mortality were &s;hut, the body refu&s;ed to re|ceive its former tenant. She looked to the right hand and to the left for a way to e&s;cape, but no avenue was open for retreat. She looked up to heaven, but could not &s;tand the &s;hock. Oh dreadful! &s;he beheld the Omni|potent loo&s;ing his engines, and beginning to play his direful vengeance upon her. To avoid this horrible calamity &s;he looked down|ward and beheld tempe&s;tuous de&s;truction from beneath moved to meet her at her coming.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of all her hurry and un&s;peak|able confu&s;ion&mdash;the &s;ly, &s;educing fiends, who had attended me incognito, and admini&s;tred fal&s;e in&s;tructions and comfort to me during life, with inconceivable fury, like &s;o many fe|rocious panthers, leaped upon and &s;eized me with their &s;corching talons; who&s;e tormenting touch diffu&s;eth hell through the whole being of the unhappy pri&s;oner.</P>

No longer do they act in di&s;gui&s;e: having made &s;ure work of my de&s;truction, they threw off every ma&s;k, and appeared devils indeed! Now a tremendous &s;cene was unfolded! The mercile&s;s furies forcibly dragged me to ap|pear before the dreadful, the flaming throne</P>
<P>Infinite amazement, horrible a&s;toni&s;hment &s;eized me, when I beheld the &s;ame Saviour whom I had denied on earth, now filling the maje&s;tic, the judgment &s;eat, filled with all the fulne&s;s of uncreated deity, the whole fulne&s;s of the God head dwelling bodily in him. Infinite numbers of glorious &s;pirits were placed around the refulgent throne, ca&s;ting their crowns at the feet of him who &s;at on the throne, and &s;inging holy, holy, holy Lord GOD Almighty, &amp;c. every one cloathed with the righteou&s;ne&s;s of GOD which is by faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The terrible Judge addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me, and &s;aid, <HI>Friend, how came&s;t thou hither not having on a wedding garment.</HI> Alas! now my boa&s;ted rea&s;on failed, and horrible guilt &s;urrounded me; dread con|fu&s;ion environed me on every hand. Self-con|victed and &s;elf condemned I could not an&s;wer a word. All my artful eva&s;ions of truth, my contempt of the per&s;on and righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, perverting the &s;acred &s;criptures to e&s;tabli&s;h my accur&s;ed here&s;ies, and the de&s;|pite I had done to the grace, doctrines, and &s;ervants of GOD, all appeared as dreadful wit|ne&s;&s;es
<PB N="18" REF="013390_0017_0F90949608E1F0E8">and advocates again&s;t me. I lived in hopes of being judged by a mild judge, ac|cording to a yielding law, but alas! I found an inflexible law and an inexorable judge. No allowance was made for mine infirmities, no abatement would the law admit of. No! not in the lea&s;t, either eternal and perfect obedience, or perfect and eternal &s;uffer|ings.</P>
<P>The imperial Judge, who filled the maje&s;|tic &s;eat, with &s;tern vengeance frowning on his irreconcileable countenance, and dire di&s;|plea&s;ure lowering on his tremendous brow, pronounced on me the dread, the irrevocable &s;entence, the unchangeable doom of <HI>a wolf in a &s;heep's cloathing;</HI> &s;aying, Thou flock-de&s;troying ravager, thou grace-de&s;pi&s;ing, and God-denying &s;inner, where is now the God thou tru&s;ted in? If rea&s;on is thy God why doth &s;he not deliver from under my vengeful hand? Go learn accur&s;ed &s;pirit, go learn whether the torments of hell are infinite and of never-end|ing duration or not! Feel, wretched being! feel! endure all the ponderous weight of my falling vengeance. Hence, apo&s;tate! to the de&s;tined place of thy eternal abode! Here devils, receive your charge&mdash; away with the mi&s;creant to utter dark|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>This &s;aid, the &s;pouts of omnipotent ven|geance were opened, and the i&s;&s;uing indigna|tion of an angry GOD falling and breaking
<PB N="19" REF="013390_0018_0F90949A5BE12178">upon my head, (accur&s;ed, devoted to de&s;truc|tion) as a &s;tream of flaming brim&s;tone, did pierce me through with infinite &s;orrows.</P>
<P>The obedient infernals no &s;ooner received, but obeyed the charge, &s;eized, and fettered me, with chains of all others the mo&s;t dread|ful, chains made of my own doctrines, from the pulpit and pre&s;s, interdicted by the great law-giving GOD. O! amazing! that all my heretical opinions &s;hould be &s;o interlaced, as to become a chain &s;tronger than iron, and, har|der than &s;teel; but &s;o it is, and I &s;hall never, never, be able to break it.</P>
<P>Being fettered and chained, the loath&s;ome &s;pirits, who had attended me during life, and at death dragged me before the awful tribunal to receive the condemning &s;entence, did now &s;houlder and bear me away, through the dreary pa&s;&s;age, to this dark abode. In the lone&s;ome avenue that leadeth from the gates of heaven to the bottomle&s;s gulph of perdi|tion, I was frequently met by detached par|ties of patrolling goblins, who &s;eemed to re|joice to &s;ee their companions bringing home to their gloomy abode <HI>the learned the holy Doctor</HI> as in deri&s;ion they called me. At la&s;t, unhap|py moment! We arrived at the iron gates which opened of their own accord to receive their frightened prey.</P>
<P>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, was I &s;eized by the devouring jaws, and &s;wal|lowed into the craving womb, of aby&s;mal
<PB N="20" REF="013390_0019_0F90949B953682F0">hell, where the worm dieth not, and where the fire is not quenched.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was I within the&s;e frightful man&s;ions, but <HI>Arius</HI> and <HI>Socinus</HI> were appri&s;ed of my coming, by fre&s;h bolts of divine indig|nation being thundred again&s;t their apo&s;tate heads.</P>
<P>The moment I entered, I was environed by a numerous body of gha&s;tly &s;pectres, who, by my preaching and writing, had been hardened again&s;t the truth, and heedle&s;ly drowned in everla&s;ting de&s;pair, they railed again&s;t my fal|lacy, and cur&s;ed my indefatigable diligence in de&s;troying of them, and in fury un&s;peakable, plunged me into the bo&s;om of a flaming bil|low; &s;till they continued their helli&s;h reproach and dragged my intoxicated gho&s;t through the reeking liquid. And the more fiercely the wrath of the Almighty doth beat upon them|&s;elves, the more intent are they in renewing my torments. Always, ince&s;&s;antly, doth the breath of JEHOVAH, as a &s;tream of brim&s;tone, with ardour inten&s;e, continue to burn within me? Myriads of &s;kilful fiends &s;eem to employ all their wi&s;dom, contriving how to aggravate my pain.</P>
<P>This alas! is the unalterable &s;tate of your revered apo&s;tle, whom you &s;uppo&s;ed was ranged in heaven near the choir of the ancient evangeli&s;ts. Believe me, Mr.&mdash;, hell is not a fiction, as mi&s;taking mortals may dream. The wrath of God is &s;omething more than
<PB N="21" REF="013390_0020_0F90949C04908888">a bare &s;eparation from his joyful pre&s;ence The pains of hell are not, as you believe, the dream of fanatics and enthu&s;ia&s;ts, but real real, inexpre&s;&s;ible pain! in&s;upportable angui&s;h! increa&s;ing daily as more &s;ouls arrive."</P>
<P>As he had thus &s;poke, a flaming billow rol|led upon, and overwhelmed him, and it was a con&s;iderable time before I &s;aw him again. O! thought I, if it is thus with the tutor, how will it be in the end with the pupils? If the leader hath fallen into the ditch, certainly the followers mu&s;t, if they walk in his ways and are governed by his directions. If I am not in a dream, or trance, for my own part, if ever I reach home again, I will examine my BIBLE better, that I may know for my&s;elf truth from error; for it is a fearful thing thus to fall into the avenging hands of a denied GOD. I cannot, no! I cannot endure devouring flames, nor dwell with unquenchable burn|ings. But I hope it is only a dream. O if it may prove only a dream, I &s;hould be exceed|ing glad. But I was awake when I came from home, awake when I entered this horrible place. No, no, it cannot be a dream, it mu&s;t be even as I &s;ee it. Oh amazing! my tutor, &s;o highly e&s;teemed in life, in this condition; it is &s;urely he, I know his voice. Yes, yes, it is he.</P>
<P>As I was thus rea&s;oning concerning what I heard and &s;aw, my tutor was brought up to the &s;urface; and after he recovered him&s;elf a little, he &s;tood erect, and &s;aid,</P>

"Unhappy &s;oul, to whom, whil&s;t I lived, my mouth was an oracle, and gained your credence and attention &s;ooner than the voice of GOD in the &s;criptures of truth, as you hold my memory venerable, hearken to what I &s;ay unto you. You &s;eem greatly to que&s;tion the truth of the vi&s;ion which you now behold, but you may know of a truth that it is even too true, too real indeed! and that it cannot be otherwi&s;e, you will plainly &s;ee before you depart from hence. Wretched pupil, you, and your Socinian brethren, may know that it is not love to all, or any of you, that prompts me thus to expo&s;e to the world what hath befal|len me. No! there is no love, no tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion in the &s;moky regions of the damned.&mdash;Rage, hatred, envy, and malice fill every brea&s;t, and pen&s;ive lower on every beclouded brow. But my rea&s;on is this, and none other. When I arrived in the&s;e hor|rible man&s;ions, I lift up my eyes, being in exqui&s;ite torment, and beheld troops of my di&s;ciples po&s;ting after me to the &s;ame pit of de&s;truction. Right well knowing that their arrival would greatly add to my already in&s;upportable angui&s;h, with the rich libertine in the go&s;pel, I rai&s;e my voice from the belly of this bottomle&s;s aby&s;s, and &s;peak in the language of horrid de&s;pair, if by any means I may prevent the arrival of my brethren in fal&s;e&s;hood, and the &s;ouls by me deceived in

O why, why will you follow me, ye deluded ones? As for me, my &s;tate is unalter|ably fixed, the dye is ca&s;t, my lo&s;s is irrepara|ble, and my afflictions remedile&s;s; for there is neither work nor device in the grave. The irrevocable doom is pa&s;t, my tree is fallen, and in hell it mu&s;t lie, burning, but never to be con&s;umed! dying yet never dead! But for you, you are yet in a land of hope, on the act|ing &s;ide of death, on the mortal &s;ide of Jordan, not out of the reach of mercy, and the light of the go&s;pel of truth &s;hining around you. Ca&s;t off then your errors, and cleave to the truths of the Bible, the verbal report of which, as rational creatures, you are capable of receiving: and it will be your condemnation if you do it not. For <HI>I</HI> can tell you, if ever &s;alvation do reach your unhappy &s;ouls, it mu&s;t come through the &s;ame truths that I taught you to deny, but am my&s;elf, though too late, alas! convinced of.

<P>Is not this infinite vengeance that I &s;u&s;tain? Is not this Almighty wrath that rolls ince&s;&s;ant floods upon me? yet this is the very wrath and vengeance of the Saviour whom <HI>I</HI> denied. Nothing le&s;s than Omnipotence could thus torment, and along with the torment, convey &s;u&s;taining &s;trength. Is he a creature? no! verily this is uncreated indignation that falls upon me.

Nothing can be God but infinity; but the highe&s;t creature is only a finite being, therefore not God.&mdash;Was yonder being who pronounced my deci&s;ive doom only a creature? Why then did the terrors of Godhead &s;trike me, before the tremendous throne. Could creature terrors thus pierce me through with

<P>Deep infatuation! fal&s;e rea&s;on, that denies the &s;upremacy of the Son. Your rea&s;on, were it not gro&s;ly perverted, would readily &s;ee in the &s;acred volume that the Father is &s;upreme, the Son &s;upreme, and the Holy Gho&s;t &s;upreme, and that the&s;e three are &s;o in&s;eparably united, as to be only ONE everliving and &s;upreme GOD. Blinded creatures! O my di&s;ciples! will you believe nothing but what your rea&s;on can comprehend? Is your rea&s;on finite or in|finite? If it is but finite, as you know it is, how can you think thereby to gra&s;p infinity? But the light of your rea&s;on is only darkne&s;s, therefore it conceiveth irrational ideas of the deep things of GOD.</P>
<P>Be you a&s;&s;ured, that when you land in the&s;e intolerable man&s;ions, you will then, if not be|fore, repent that you gave the te&s;timony of rea|&s;on the preference to that of the divine oracles. O! what will you do, wretched men, when your rea&s;on bears te&s;timony again&s;t you? It is a dreadful thing for a man to be witne&s;&s;ed a|gain&s;t by his own rea&s;onable faculties. Yet &s;o it mu&s;t be when you die, if you hearken not to the voice of truth, who&s;e invariable dic|tates in&s;truct the mo&s;t enlightned rea&s;on to &s;ub|mit it&s;elf to revelation.</P>
<P>For my own part, <HI>I</HI> confe&s;s to you that I
<PB N="26" REF="013390_0025_0F9094A618986300">am condemned as a wilful idolater: and it will fare no better with you, if you recant not in time, for you are all wilful idolaters. You knowingly wor&s;hip a being whom you believe only to be a dignified creature: now know, that the wor&s;hip of any being who is not e&s;&s;en|tially GOD, how great &s;oever that being is, is only rank idolatry. You know likewi&s;e that our Arian and Socinian &s;ect doth, contrary to the law of GOD and right rea&s;on it&s;elf, in|troduce more Gods than one: What is this but pagani&s;m? The truth is, we, who were of the Socinian tribe whil&s;t on earth, now we are in hell, are &s;unk lower in the bottomle&s;s aby&s;s, and endure far higher degrees of tor|ment than the infidels who wor&s;hipped the &s;un, moon, and &s;tars, and all the ho&s;t of hea|ven. O blind and perverted rea&s;on, that by tru&s;ting to thy fal&s;e dictates I have de&s;pi&s;ed the truth and unhappily de&s;troyed my&s;elf. O cruelty never to be forgot! Treachery, ne|ver to be forgiven! Thro' &s;elf-deception, cruel in its nature, I have lo&s;t, ruined my&s;elf!</P>
<P>Unhappy men, when you come to view your tenets in the light of eternity, as your teacher and fellow-here&s;iarch now unhappily does, you will &s;ee that the profe&s;t athei&s;ts and we do &s;tand on a level. They deny the be|ing of GOD in terms that are obvious and di|rect, we deny the &s;ame being in a &s;ubtile indi|rect manner: For in denying the divinity of the Son, the whole deity is denied; for the
<PB N="27" REF="013390_0026_0F9094A7292395F0">God head of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit, is one and the &s;elf &s;ame Godhead, differing only in the manner of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; there|fore in denying one of the divine &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, &s;trictly &s;peaking, you deny all the three. But as for my di&s;ciples, you deny two of the&s;e di|vine &s;ub&s;i&s;tences, and a&s;cribe unto them &s;ome kind of un&s;criptural &s;uper-angelic qualities. Pray what do you call this? Is it not real athei&s;m? Cea&s;e from following me, I de&s;ire you. Burn, O burn my books again&s;t the truth, and forget my irrational here&s;ies. Cea&s;e, I &s;ay! cea&s;e from following after me, before you are &s;wallowed, to my un&s;peakable di&s;trac|tion, in the &s;ame perdition with me. Believe what the &s;criptures &s;ay of him whom you de|ny. If any man believe not that JESUS is the ETERNAL I AM, he &s;hall die in his &s;ins.</P>
<P>A &s;econd &s;entiment of yours which I adver|ti&s;e you of, and warn you to recant, is, the good opinion you have of your &s;uppo&s;ed in|herent purity, in oppo&s;ition to the voice of religion and the dictates of common &s;en&s;e. O that I had never maligned the truth by a&s;&s;ert|ing that the doctrine of original &s;in is a fallacy? Alas! though my repentance is &s;incere, it is now too late! is not that predominant pride which is peculiar to the tribes of the Dei&s;ts, Socinians, and Arians, a &s;trong demon&s;tration of our original depravity. Is it not pride that &s;welleth our haughty rea&s;on to that degree, that it not only vyes with, but even &s;upercedes everlation. We are wont to &s;ay that we will
<PB N="28" REF="013390_0027_0F9094A74941EF20">believe nothing but what our rea&s;on can com|prehend. The native meining of this decla|ration is, that the word of GOD may err, but rea&s;on is infallible. What is this better than Popi&s;h pride, Infidel blindne&s;s, and Turki&s;h arrogance. Believe me, my followers, if you choo&s;e to be governed by the dictates of car|nal rea&s;on, rather than divine revelation, you will find that yours will do by you as mine hath done by me; It will plunge you into hell in the end. Con&s;ider, my deluded followers, that if we by our rea&s;on had been capable of knowing the whole mind of GOD, there had been no need of revelation, no need of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t being &s;ent down from heaven to lead his people into all truth; to reprove the world of &s;in, of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of judgment.</HI></P>
<P>Doth not your incon&s;i&s;tency in preaching, &s;ometimes contradicting one day what you ad|vanced the other, plainly prove the in&s;ufficiency of rea&s;on to gra&s;p infinite my&s;teries. Ah! my di&s;ciples! how can you think to e&s;cape the damnation of hell? &s;eeing, though you pro|fe&s;s to hearken to the voice of rea&s;on, you only li&s;ten partially to her.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on tells you that it is irrational to preach and unpreach, to contradict in one &s;er|mon what you preached in another. But how can you do otherwi&s;e, if you adhere not to the voice of revelation, which is perfectly uniform, as rea&s;on al&s;o doth allow. But you and I are wont to charge the &s;criptures with contradic|tion;
<PB N="29" REF="013390_0028_0F9094A8073FCA08">I am now convinced indeed. that they are one chain of uniform truth. But alas! you remain unconvinced; and lo!

<P>Unhappy di&s;ciples! are you not guilty of &s;elf-contradictions every day? Do not you de|clare that you will believe nothing but what your rea&s;on can comprehend? And notwith|&s;tanding this declaration, you believe that you are po&s;&s;e&s;t of rational immortal &s;pirits, and you cannot comprehend how, or in what manner, the&s;e &s;pirits dwell in you. Your rea&s;on tells you, that no creature is, or ought to be an ob|ject of religious adoration; but, contrary to the dictates of common &s;en&s;e, you wor&s;hip Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom you are taught to call a creature. Your rea&s;on tells you that GOD mu&s;t be an infinite, uncreated, &s;upreme being: but, contrary to all rea&s;on, you and I are wont to talk of a finite, created, and &s;ubordinate GOD. Witne&s;s heaven and earth, if the&s;e and many other glaring contradictions are not &s;o many plain &s;ymptoms of natural depravity and dark|ne&s;s!</P>
<P>As long as you believe your&s;elves exempt from natural defilement, and in no danger by &s;in; as long as you cry up your own inherent power and worth, &s;o long are you in a &s;tate of condemnation, from which nothing can
<PB N="30" REF="013390_0029_0F9094AB23B0F680">&s;ave you but the attoning blood of Chri&s;t, which &s;acrifice I taught you to de&s;pi&s;e. Blind|ne&s;s as to your own wants and danger being a certain te&s;timony of your depravity, and of the hardne&s;s of your hearts again&s;t GOD.</P>
<P>Remember, that as long as you continue in that good opinion you have of your&s;elves, &s;o long you are enemies to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, bla&s;phemous contradictors of GOD's holy word, that hath judiciou&s;ly concluded all men under &s;in, and declared them dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, children of wrath, &amp;c. O that I had preached thus while I lived! then had not my hell been &s;o hot as alas! I find it. If you are &s;o unhappy as to follow me to this place of torment, you will &s;oon be convinced, that your boa&s;ted natural light is only darkne&s;s, that your virtue &s;o much talked of is only painted vice, your &s;trength imbecillity; and that your pretended humility is none other but pride in di&s;gui&s;e. Oh! the Socinians hell is hot, &s;even times hotter than that of the profe&s;t Pagans.</P>
<P>A third evil of a damning nature which attendeth your heretical tribes is, denying the imputation of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s for ju&s;ti|fication, for pardon and acceptance; a doctrine of GOD's word which none ever died in the denial of, and e&s;caped the damnation of hell. Con&s;ider, my unhappy followers, that I, hav|ing &s;een the my&s;teries of eternity, mu&s;t be al|lowed capable of teaching you le&s;&s;ons that you, in a &s;tate of mortality are utter &s;trangers unto:
<PB N="31" REF="013390_0030_0F9094ABD0F16AE8">and if you &s;ubmitted your&s;elves to my in&s;truc|tion when I lived on earth, with far more rea&s;on you ought to attend to me now, when my knowledge is refined by the flames of hell.</P>
<P>In denying the imputation of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s for the &s;inner's pardon and ac|ceptance, you in effect deny the ju&s;tice and truth of Jehovah. Ju&s;tice hath &s;aid <HI>the &s;oul that &s;inneth &s;hall die,</HI> truth is engaged to &s;ee the decree executed. Now, either the &s;inner mu&s;t die in him&s;elf, or in &s;ome other per&s;on who &s;tands in the relation of &s;urety for him: If the &s;inner die in him&s;elf, then is there &s;al|vation for none, for all have &s;inned; but if he die in his &s;urety, or if his &s;urety die for him, then what his &s;urety did for him mu&s;t be imputed to him for his acceptance. But as I taught you, &s;o you &s;ay, that he died not in his &s;urety, neither needs he to die in him &s;elf&mdash;as a ju&s;t con&s;equence of this, the mercy and truth of God do both fall to the ground. Now, if both the ju&s;tice and truth of God be denied, God him&s;elf is denied, and you commence ATHEISTS on the &s;pot.</P>
<P>Let not you and your brethren &s;trive to evade my arguments, and think your&s;elves &s;omewhat better than ATHEISTS; for I can a&s;&s;ure you, that the profe&s;t ATHEISTS and we, do compo&s;e only one canton in the&s;e in|fernal regions. Is the imputation of Chri&s;t's

<P>Mr. <HI>Fal&s;hort</HI> &s;tood charged in Mr. <HI>Au&s;terity</HI>'s Books with the &s;um of a thou&s;and pounds. <HI>Au&s;terity</HI> called on him once and again for his money, but meeting with nothing but good words and fair promi&s;es in&s;tead of &s;atisfactory payment, he re&s;olved to have Mr. <HI>Fal&s;hort</HI>'s circum&s;tances tried; and upon trial found that he was not worth a thou&s;and pence. <HI>Au&s;terity</HI> enraged at the di&s;appointment, immediately arre&s;ted <HI>Fal&s;hort</HI> and laid him in goal, where he lay in a helple&s;s and hopele&s;s condition, often &s;olliciting Mr. <HI>Au&s;terity</HI> for a relea&s;e. But <HI>Au&s;terity</HI> ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in his de|mands, either payment of the whole &s;um, or impri&s;onment during life.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Goodwill,</HI> a neighbouring gentleman, and relation to Mr. <HI>Fal&s;hort,</HI> moved with pity and compa&s;&s;ion towards his unfortunate friend, and being a man of &s;ub&s;tance and honour, went to Mr. <HI>Au&s;terity</HI> unknown to Mr. <HI>Fal&s;hort,</HI> and re&s;olved to deliver his, poor, in&s;olvent friend out of pri&s;on, but &s;corning to have it &s;aid that <HI>Au&s;terity</HI> &s;hould be a lo&s;er by his friend <HI>Fal&s;hort,</HI> he paid down chearfully the whole &s;um, to the &s;atisfaction of the creditor and deliverance of the in&s;olvent: on which payment he obtained a di&s;charge in full of all demands on the account of Mr. <HI>Fal&s;hort.</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="013390_0032_0F9094B2F5C9C298">Now the quere is, did <HI>Au&s;terity</HI> impute unto <HI>Fal&s;hort</HI> the payment of Mr. <HI>Goodwill,</HI> and account it the &s;ame as if <HI>Fal&s;hort</HI> him&s;elf had payed the debt.

Ah! my di&s;ciples, your abu&s;ed, yet boa&s;ted rea&s;on, if you recant not, will be a terrible devil to torment you when you arrive in the&s;e intoler|able man&s;ions, as my rea&s;on, alas! is the greate&s;t of all my tormentors.</P>
<P>But you &s;ay you have no need of the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of another, becau&s;e you have power of your&s;elves to do that which is well plea&s;ing in the &s;ight of GOD, and &s;ufficiently work out your own &s;alvation. Now if you could do &s;o, you would at once &s;top my mouth. Ah! poor deluded mortals, you little know what it is to keep the law of God! The command|ment is exceeding broad!</P>
<P>Does there never a vain thought pa&s;s through your mind? Does there never an idle word i&s;&s;ue from your mouth? Do you in all things do unto others as you would that they &s;hould do unto you? Unle&s;s you can an&s;wer the two fir&s;t queries in the negative, and the latter in the affirmative, never boa&s;t of &s;trength, but be mortified for want of will to keep ei|ther all or any precept of the moral law perfectly.

<PB N="34" REF="013390_0033_0F9094B607358CF0">into which they are involved? Ju&s;t as much power have you to work out your own &s;alvation. You can as &s;oon deliver your&s;elves from the torments of hell if once you are &s;wallowed up in it, as to deliver your&s;elves from the &s;lavi&s;h bands of your pride and ig|norance. Bewitched Socinians, let right rea&s;on have its cour&s;e, and it will teach you to &s;ubmit to revelation.

<P>As the Doctor had thus &s;poke, he was &s;urrounded by a number of mercile&s;s furies, &s;eized, and plunged into the flaming aby&s;s, &s;o that for &s;ome time I lo&s;t &s;ight of him, and the &s;moke of his torment a&s;cended up to hea|ven, darkening the air in its pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>After the &s;pace of about half an hour, I perceived him ca&s;t up at the farther &s;ide of a rolling billow, and after &s;ome violent &s;trug|glings he &s;tood erect, and in horrid di&s;traction &s;aid.&mdash;"Damnation! ah me! is this the Damnation I was &s;o often threatened with by the Calvini&s;ts, and as often laughed at it as a fanatic's dream? Is this the hell I &s;o often heard of, and &s;o fallaciou&s;ly concluded to con|&s;i&s;t barely in a &s;eparation from the bli&s;sful pre|&s;ence

<P>Wretched creatures, as I lift up my tor|mented eyes, I behold them po&s;ting onward toward the dreadful goal. If they arrive, my torment, though already inexpre&s;&s;ible, will be greatly aggravated.&mdash;Let me once more try what effect the eloquence of de&s;pair may have upon them. Who knows but it may retard their march!</P>
<P>Still! &s;till do you pur&s;ue your cour&s;e! O my deluded followers? Still will ye remain tenacious of your errors, notwith&s;tanding I plainly tell you to what di&s;mal di&s;traction they have reduced me! into what unalterable angui&s;h they have plunged me! You per&s;e|vere in your errors, therefore I mu&s;t per|&s;evere in admoni&s;hing you. Hearken &s;ir! hearken Mr.&mdash;while I &s;peak to you, and I charge you to tell your brethren what I &s;ay.</P>
<P>Your denying the efficacy of divine grace in regeneration and &s;anctification is ju&s;tly ranked among your damnable errors, and is one of the greate&s;t here&s;ies that ever <HI>I</HI> taught you.&mdash;Had I experimentally known the influences of efficacious grace, I had never come to this place of torment, but had been
<PB N="36" REF="013390_0035_0F9094B7C69D1D80">joining yonder a&s;&s;embly, yonder glorious church of the fir&s;t-born, which I &s;ee afar off written in heaven, beautified with all the lu&s;|tre of grace, both imputed and imparted, cloathed with all the radiance of undecaying glory, filled with the inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ures that i&s;&s;ue from the throne of &s;overeign love and goodne&s;s. Alas, I never &s;aw the need of the operations of unfru&s;trable grace till I ar|rived in eternity, and now too late I repent my denial thereof.&mdash;The flames of hell give a la&s;ting and full conviction of the truth of all the doctrines of the go&s;pel, and at the &s;ame time that we, the &s;pirits accur&s;ed, have no &s;hare in their &s;alutary report and in|fluence.</P>
<P>When I lived on earth among&s;t you, I taught you to attend to the voice of carnal corrupted rea&s;on; now I am in hell, I advi&s;e you to hearken to the voice of right rea&s;on compared with the word of GOD.</P>
<P>In the word of GOD conver&s;ion is ac|counted a quickening or ri&s;ing from the dead: and rea&s;on tells you, that you cannot quicken or bring to life again the deare&s;t, the mo&s;t be|loved object which death hath bereaved you of; nor can they quicken them&s;elves, or they would never &s;uffer their delicate bodies to be|come nau&s;eou&s;ly putrified in the devouring womb of the hungry grave. For my own part, I find I cannot quicken my body again, or I would not lie here broiling in the&s;e
<PB N="37" REF="013390_0036_0F9094B8985080A8">flames.&mdash;Some of you have hair of an un|lovely colour of which you are a&s;hamed, why do you not change its colour agreeable to your minds? Others of you my di&s;ciples have legs or &s;houlders not &s;haped, eyes and temples not &s;et to your liking, why do you not mend the matter and alter the proportion of your parts? Your own rea&s;on tells you, you cannot &s;o much as alter the colour of a &s;ingle hair of your head.</P>
<P>But the quickening of the &s;oul is an infi|nitely greater work. And is it rea&s;onable to pretend to do the greater, when you are convinced you cannot do the le&s;s? O my di&s;|ciples! how have I your blind leader darkened your under&s;tanding by my fal&s;hoods. Woe is me! for my followers are at the point of falling into this horrible ditch.</P>
<P>Again, the work of conver&s;ion is a creation of the &s;oul anew. Now if divine grace is not the efficient in this &s;oul creation, you your|&s;elves mu&s;t be the efficient therein. Can you do it? You profe&s;s you can. Fir&s;t try your creating hand on a le&s;&s;er job before you pro|ceed to the greater. Can you create riches and honour? You love them well enough; if you have power to create them why do &s;o many of you go de&s;titute of both? Can you create peace in the mid&s;t of trouble? Joy in the mid&s;t of &s;orrow? Ea&s;e in the mid&s;t of pain? Light in the time and place of dark|ne&s;s? Beauty in&s;tead of deformity? You
<PB N="38" REF="013390_0037_0F9094BB08F165F0">know you cannot. But to create the &s;oul <HI>in Chri&s;t Je&s;us to good works</HI> is a ta&s;k by far more difficult. If you cannot, as your con|&s;ciences confe&s;s, do the lea&s;t, is it not then a great degree of madne&s;s to pretend to do the greate&s;t, even a work that requires Omnipo|tence to perform.</P>
<P>Hearken ye blinded mortals, hearken to the voice of him who hath condemned me! It is not effected by <HI>works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which we have done, but by the walling of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Again, incon&s;i&s;tent creature that you are, (&s;aith he to me) if you can create your&s;elf a|new, why do you not do it? Why are you &s;o long e'er you begin the work? If you mu&s;t perform the work with your own &s;ingle hand, you will be long in fini&s;hing it: Mo&s;t likely you may &s;pend all your life time before you are half gone through with you work, then all your creating labour will be lo&s;t. Is it not highly unrea&s;onable when a man hears that he <HI>mu&s;t be born again, created anew, quicken'd together with Chri&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. and at the &s;ome time believes that the renewing power is in him&s;elf, that he &s;hould &s;it down contented in an unrenewed condition, not knowing but death may &s;eize him every moment?"</P>
<P>Here I was cut to the heart, to &s;ee that in|&s;tead of being guided wholly by rea&s;on, that in many things I both believed and acted contrary to rea&s;on. The old Doctor, per|ceiving my confu&s;ion, continued:</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="013390_0038_0F9094BB9FC4D7D0">
"Con&s;ider that if you deny the operations of the comforter, you deny the author of the bible, who is the very GOD that made you. Here you may &s;ee that I taught you Athei&s;m in various forms. Oh! that you repented your receiving my in&s;tructions as &s;incerely as I repent teaching them! then would not my torment be increa&s;ed by your arrival in hell. I do a&s;&s;ure you I recant all the&s;e bla&s;phemous errors, though now alas! it is too late. You may recant in time as you are yet on the mortal &s;ide of the gulph! Oh! that you might all recant in time! I dread your arrival in this fiery tophet! becau&s;e it will bring additional torment to me.</P>
<P>Mi&s;erable teacher that I was, I taught you to deny the operations of the Holy Gho&s;t, and in doing &s;o to deny the truth of God, which in fact is the &s;ame as to deny GOD him&s;elf. O! what &s;pirit accur&s;ed can &s;tand up under the fury of a denied God! Alas if you do not hearti|ly &s;ign your recantation in time, you mu&s;t needs &s;tand the &s;hock, the dreadful &s;hock of his fiery indignation to all eternity.</P>
<P>Another de&s;tructive error by which you trea&s;ure up unto your&s;elves wrath again&s;t the day of wrath, is the tru&s;t you have in a mild, yielding law, and flexible ju&s;tice of God the judge.</P>
<P>You may fancy what you will; but for my part, when I trembling &s;tood before the awful throne, I found no conde&s;cen&s;ion in, no abatements made by, the rigid law,
<PB N="40" REF="013390_0039_0F9094BC58241D60">not the lea&s;t in divine ju&s;tice! All was &s;tern, all was &s;evere, beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of miti|gation. I then found, though never before, that the council of the mo&s;t high doth &s;tand, and that his word is as invariable as him&s;elf. O! if you had &s;een as much of the immuta|bility of the law as I have! you would have done with talking as you do about abatement of its rigorous demands, or that ju&s;tice doth make allowances for &s;ins, however &s;uppo&s;ed venal. This error of yours doth directly wound both the mercy and ju&s;tice of God: for if God is ju&s;t, then mu&s;t his law be ful|filled according to the tenor thereof; if God is merciful, his mercy mu&s;t be unbounded: but if, as in effect you &s;ay, he in part forgives and in part receives, his mercy is limited by the circum&s;tances of the object. One man requires a greater, another requires a le&s;s de|gree of mercy. Is not this as great an indig|nity as you can offer to the mercy of God? As for me, I now &s;ee in the light of eternity, that where ever &s;alvation comes, it comes wholly, fully and freely, <HI>without money and without price,</HI> without any works of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s on the part of man.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e, I now &s;ee that God's ju&s;tice is infinite, which it could not po&s;&s;ibly be, if it could in any ways pa&s;s by the lea&s;t &s;in un|puni&s;hed. Fooli&s;h dreamers that we were! to think that God would drown his ju&s;tice in the flood of his mercy, would prejudice
<PB N="41" REF="013390_0040_0F9094BD08BC7728">one attribute of his incomprehen&s;ible nature, to the honour of another, and all for the &s;ake of creatures who are le&s;s than nothing, in his &s;ight altogether vanity. Folly in perfection indeed! That being who is GOD mu&s;t be infinitely holy and ju&s;t as well as infinitely mer|ciful. If he is infinitely holy, than he can make no allowance for &s;in. If infinitely ju&s;t, then his mercy can be extended to none, but to the honour of his ju&s;tice. But if his ju&s;tice can pa&s;s over &s;ome &s;ins, why not all &s;in? and then there would be no need of a Saviour; for verily if &s;alvation could have come by the holine&s;s of the creature, Chri&s;t hath died in vain. Have not you an equal right to a pen|ny which one man may owe you, as to a pound which another may? Such is the rigour of the law, (and that &s;oon you will find) that he who offends in one point, though it were but in a &s;ingle thought, is guilty of the whole,&mdash;GOD will by no means clear the guilty,&mdash;there is no relea&s;e from his law's arre&s;t,&mdash;no appeal from the tribunal of his ju&s;tice! O faithle&s;s and unbelieving, as I was, will you not open your eyes to &s;ee the light of in&s;truction? Will you ever &s;hut your ears again&s;t the voice of truth?</P>
<P>I know you &s;ay, that when you come to be tried at the divine bar, that your vices mu&s;t be put in one &s;cale, and your virtues in the other, and if there happen to be an e|quilibrium in the balance, that God will put
<PB N="42" REF="013390_0041_0F9094BDC4156900">in &s;o much of his divine clemency, as will make your virtues overweigh your vices. Alas! alas! I can look back to the time that I had &s;uch a fooli&s;h notion, which greatly facilitated my ruin. But when I came to be weighed, all my deeds were accounted evil; my virtues, which I formerly thought I had &s;tore of, were, when weighed in the balance of the &s;anctuary, lighter than nothing, vanity it&s;elf. You will find that unle&s;s Chri&s;t be put in the balance with you, <HI>you will be &s;ound wanting</HI> as I was. How &s;hould it be otherwi&s;e, when <HI>without faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e</HI> GOD, and <HI>what&s;oever is not of faith is &s;in?</HI> Why then will faithle&s;s mortals pre|tend to do <HI>that which is well plea&s;ing in the &s;ight of</HI> GOD? When I expected my virtues to appear as my <HI>wedding garment,</HI> I was &s;truck as with a thunder-bolt, and when I heard the Judge, the holy GOD to &s;ay, <HI>Let his filthy rags be burned with him, both he and they are an abomination to me, from this time forward I will rejoice over him to do him evil.</HI></P>
<P>Ah my di&s;ciples, you will find that the fir&s;t touch of the flames beneath will at once con|&s;ume all your &s;uppo&s;ed virtue. The law ad|mitteth not of compo&s;ition, and the ju&s;tice of GOD cannot be bribed with imperfect virtues, rather the appearance of virtue. If you mu&s;t &s;tand in your own righteou&s;ne&s;s, alas! you mu&s;t bear the whole weight of JEHOVAH's
<PB N="43" REF="013390_0042_0F9094BE80B4D4F8">vengeance, as I do at this day. O that I had been wi&s;e, and had under&s;tood this in time, then had not my latter end been &s;o terribly dreadful. Ah me! the&s;e complaints are now too late!</P>
<P>Another error whereby your hands are &s;trengthened in wickedne&s;s, is your vain imaginations concerning the torments of the damned. You &s;ay that the torments of hell con&s;i&s;ts only in a &s;eparation from the joys of heaven, the bli&s;sful pre&s;ence of GOD: If that indeed were all&mdash;it were no hell to &s;ouls who&s;e natural language is,&mdash;<HI>depart from me, O Lord, I de&s;ire not the knowledge of thee.</HI> All the heaven unregenerate men de&s;ire, is an ut|ter &s;eparation from GOD. But I can tell you from woeful experience, that exclu&s;ion from the mercy of GOD is in&s;eperable from endur|ing his wrath. Separation from the joy of heaven, in eternity, is immediately connected with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite pain. Can the elo|quence of angels per&s;uade me that I feel not the mo&s;t intolerable angui&s;h? Are the flaming billows, that roll ince&s;&s;antly upon me, nothing but bare &s;eparation? Are the&s;e &s;treams of vengeance, that i&s;&s;ue continually from the &s;pouts of omnipotent wrath, nothing but &s;e|paration? Doth this noi&s;ome &s;mell, ari&s;ing from the flaming &s;ulphur, impart no torment to the damned? Doth the&s;e di&s;mal howlings of &s;ouls in unutterable agonies&mdash;the&s;e dire|ful
<PB N="44" REF="013390_0043_0F9094BF70892FA8">yellings of hideous gho&s;ts, cutting their flight through the tremendous arches of the expan&s;ive tophet,&mdash;yield no degree of tor|ment to the damned ear? Or the &s;ight of millions of frightful gho&s;ts floating upon the &s;urface of the burning lake? All the &s;erpen|tine breed in their mo&s;t gha&s;tly dimen&s;ions, with all the &s;welling floods of JEHOVAH's vengeance, rolling in continually on us: can the&s;e be beheld with a peaceful eye! And all this within view of the overflowing joys of the righteous, whom on earth we accounted fanatics, enthu&s;ia&s;ts, &amp;c.&mdash;Is all this, and infinitely more than human heart in a &s;tate of mortality can form any idea of, no more than a bare &s;eparation from GOD? Now I will re|veal a my&s;tery unto you. You &s;ay that the damned are &s;eparate from GOD: but verily it is a mi&s;take! He is as fully manife&s;ted in the&s;e dreadful man&s;ions, as he is in heaven. There he is manife&s;ted in his love, grace, mercy, truth, and holine&s;s. Here he is manife&s;ted in his holine&s;s, truth, ju&s;tice, and wrath. If this manife&s;tation of GOD doth not create a hell of infinite torment, I know not what po&s;&s;ibly can.</P>
<P>But you &s;ay that de&s;pair con&s;titutes hell. I a&s;k you, did you ever &s;en&s;ibly know what is meant by de&s;pair? If you felt the awful tor|ment, cau&s;ed by that gnawing worm, for the &s;pace of one minute, you would dread it as long as you lived. Know of a truth that hell is intolerable! Flatter not your&s;elves that your
<PB N="45" REF="013390_0044_0F9094C0030C6D10">puni&s;hment will con&s;i&s;t in a &s;eparation from the per&s;on whom you hate. If you are &s;o un|happy as to per&s;i&s;t in your here&s;ies till the la&s;t, you will find that one hour in this dark abode will convince you of their fallacy.</P>
<P>But to make the be&s;t of a bad bargain, you have got a notion, that in &s;ome future period there &s;hall be a general relea&s;e from the tor|ments of hell. This is a flat denial of the oracles of God, an in&s;ult on the author, and crafty method of hardening &s;inners in their &s;ins. When I lived on the earth I was of the &s;ame mind with Mr. <HI>Bourn;</HI> but now I am in hell, and am convinced of its eternity.&mdash;Alas! my conviction adds greatly to my torment. Could we who are confined to this gloomy dungeon but once think of a relea&s;e, it would in a great mea&s;ure alleviate our di&s;tre&s;s. But &s;uch a thought doth not &s;o much as once enter in|to our minds. No, never will whil&s;t eternity endures. O eternity! eternity! To think of eternity is a galling thought. Any torment is to be cho&s;en, rather than an eternity of tor|ment. Eternal inevitably it mu&s;t be! Woe is me, I am lo&s;t! Eternally lo&s;t! beyond all remedy!</P>
<P>Bewitched man, to mea&s;ure eternity by the divi&s;ions of time. Here we have no years, months, weeks, and days! But eternity is eternity, that is all you mortals can know of it. In&s;ufferable in&s;olence! thus to a&s;&s;ault the truths of JEHOVAH, and give the lie to the
<PB N="46" REF="013390_0045_0F9094C3ED702FD8">God of eternal veracity. Should you treat the law of an earthly prince with equal contempt, would he calmly and patiently &s;uffer it?

I charge you Mr.&mdash;, that you write down and publi&s;h to the world all that you have heard and &s;een, if by that means any of my deceived followers may be per&s;uaded to believe the truth, and e&s;cape this direful mi&s;ery into which I am plunged. Tell them I heartily recant all the doctrines where|by I have &s;upplanted the truths of the go&s;pel.

<P>As the doctor had thus &s;poke, I beheld him &s;urrounded by a &s;quadron of black infernals, who cut their way &s;wifter than the wind through the &s;moky arches of dreadful Tophet. They &s;urrounded, &s;eized, and carried him a|way, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, to renewed torments, by rea&s;on of his hideous &s;hrieks, that reached up unto heaven, and even now fill my afflicted ears as I write the &s;tory.&mdash;They carried him off, and I &s;aw him no more.&mdash;</P>
<P>Amazed I &s;tood on this dangerous precipice, revolving in my mind what I had heard and &s;een, a&s;toni&s;hed to find my&s;elf &s;o clearly con|victed of infidelity; fearful le&s;t <HI>I</HI> &s;hould &s;hare the &s;ame end with my unhappy tutor; and partly, wondering that I was not indeed with him already, becau&s;e <HI>I</HI> had hitherto &s;o clo&s;ely followed his doctrines. As I was meditating on the&s;e things, I heard a noi&s;e equally fright|ful with that which <HI>I</HI> heard at the beginning: <HI>I</HI> trembling &s;tood, expecting a &s;econd eruption, fearful lea&s;t thereby <HI>I</HI> &s;hould be overwhelmed with certain de&s;truction. As <HI>I</HI> thus &s;tood dread|ing the con&s;equence, the noi&s;e waxed louder and louder, like many rolling thunders con|centring in one: all the noi&s;e &s;eemed to come from the bowels of the earth. Anon the earth began to tremble, at la&s;t to &s;hake in an un|common manner; and by and by the pit in
<PB N="48" REF="013390_0047_0F9094C7557FBD08">which <HI>I</HI> had &s;een &s;uch wonders clo&s;ed its lips, and cea&s;ed further to belch froth from its fiery entrails either fire, &s;moke, or hideous &s;pectres. This done the earth regained her &s;tability, and all nature appeared &s;erene.</P>
<P>Not knowing into what place of the world I was got, I judged it &s;afe&s;t to abide where <HI>I</HI> was, and wait for the wi&s;hed for morn, the welcome harbinger of day already appearing in the Ea&s;t.&mdash;When fair Aurora had &s;pread her broidered &s;kirts over all the oriental world, and darted her plea&s;ant &s;miles towards the We&s;t, <HI>I</HI> found in her light, that <HI>I</HI> was got to the middle of the common on the &s;outh &s;ide of the town. Now knowing right well the place on which <HI>I</HI> &s;tood, <HI>I</HI> began with the light of day to &s;earch for the burned fore&s;t <HI>I</HI> had &s;een overnight; but could &s;ee nothing but what was u&s;ual on the common. <HI>I</HI> gladly would once more have viewed that plea&s;ant, but &s;oli|tary avenue, through which <HI>I</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the night before; but no avenue was to be &s;een; <HI>I</HI> &s;ought it, but could not find it. This made me conclude, that both the fore&s;t and avenue were only vi&s;ionary.</P>
<P>I dreaded going home, expecting to find my wife and children buried in the ruins made by the earthquakes; but to my joyful &s;urprize, <HI>I</HI> gladly found them all in perfect health, and my wife told me, that though the &s;lept none in the night, by rea&s;on of my ab&s;ence, yet &s;he had heard no uncommon noi&s;e, nor felt the
<PB N="49" REF="013390_0048_0F9094C9D54E5498">lea&s;t &s;hock of an earthquake; making further enquiry among my neighbours, they an&s;wered in like manner: nor indeed was there to be &s;een about all the town the lea&s;t appearance of a pa&s;t earthquake: All which tended to a&s;to|ni&s;h me more and more.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> knew not what to think of the vi&s;ion&mdash;Certainly, thought <HI>I,</HI> it cannot be a dream! But <HI>I</HI> feared lea&s;t my brain was di&s;tempered, and in the mid&s;t of its di&s;traction painted out &s;uch apparitions to me. However, two things <HI>I</HI> re&s;olved on; 1&s;t, Utterly to ca&s;t off all Arian and Socinian errors, and embrace the orthodox faith, which <HI>I</HI> had de&s;pi&s;ed the day before; but <HI>I</HI> judged it prudent candidly to examine the doctor's books by the &s;criptures of truth, before <HI>I</HI> committed them to the flames.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, <HI>I</HI> re&s;olved to keep all the&s;e things which <HI>I</HI> had &s;een and heard a profound &s;ecret. The regard <HI>I</HI> had for the doctor's memory had great influence upon me.</P>
<P>That very day <HI>I</HI> began to take a &s;criptural view of the works of my unhappy tutor; and in the conclu&s;ion, found them very worthy of the fire, which accordingly in due time they fed.</P>
<P>Still <HI>I</HI> was re&s;olved to hide the vi&s;ion in my heart, till one night in my &s;leep <HI>I</HI> dreamt that the doctor appeared to me in all the gha&s;tly deformities of a damned &s;pirit, charged me with ingratitude to that God who had in &s;o
<PB N="50" REF="013390_0049_0F9094CA82FFB340">uncommon a manner delivered me from the dangerous here&s;ies <HI>I</HI> had imbibed from my tu|tor; and want of love to my fellow creatures, in that, having got the knowledge of the truth my&s;elf, <HI>I</HI> did not &s;tudy to reclaim others from error. He &s;aid <HI>I</HI> had no true regard either for his per&s;on or memory, or <HI>I</HI> would publi&s;h unto mankind what might in part, prevent the increa&s;e of his torments. And withal told me, if <HI>I</HI> would not re&s;olve to pub|li&s;h what <HI>I</HI> had heard and &s;een, that he would haunt me every night in my &s;leep, to my un|&s;peakable mortification.</P>
<P>Self-pre&s;ervation hath in it a per&s;ua&s;ive elo|quence; rather than be troubled every night with the gho&s;t of my unhappy tutor, <HI>I</HI> have prevailed with my&s;elf to obey him; though for my pains, <HI>I</HI> expect to be called a madman by one, a fanatic by another, an enthu&s;ia&s;t by a third, and perhaps by a fourth a malicious per&s;on.</P>
<P>But <HI>I</HI> re&s;t my&s;elf content, that the notable day will &s;hew who is the wi&s;e&s;t di&s;ciple of rea&s;on, or the madde&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;t; who u&s;eth and who abu&s;eth right rea&s;on: whether they that de&s;pi&s;e my vi&s;ion, or their humble &s;ervant, who&s;e name henceforth is</P>
