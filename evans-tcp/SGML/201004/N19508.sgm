<HEAD>THE AUTHOR's LIFE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>STEPHEN DUCK,</HI> the Author of the following Poems, was born in the year 1705, near the &s;eat of <HI>Pe|ter Bathur&s;t,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> at <HI>Clarendon Park,</HI> in the county of <HI>Wilts,</HI> of parents remarkable only for their hone&s;ty and indu&s;try. However, we find he had &s;ome &s;mall &s;hare of reading and writing be&s;towed on him, with very little or no grammar: For before he had reached his <HI>&s;yntaxis,</HI> his mother had a very notable complaint exhibited again&s;t him by his Schoolma&s;ter, viz. <HI>That he took his Learning too fa&s;t, even fa&s;ter than the ma&s;ter could give it him.</HI> So that the prudent parent, to prevent &s;o growing an evil, removed her &s;on from School to the Plough, le&s;t he might become too fine a gentleman for the family that produced him.</P>
<P>The &s;eeds of learning being once &s;owed in our young plowman, there was no po&s;&s;ibility of weeding them out: for the labour of his mind generally accompanied that of his body. <HI>Milton</HI> was his con&s;tant companion in the field and the barn: He had likewi&s;e made him&s;elf ma&s;|ter of a &s;et of the <HI>Spectators,</HI> and <HI>Bailey's Engli&s;h Diction|ary.</HI> Our Author, thus equipped, a&s;cends the Hill of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>The courteous reader mu&s;t be informed that our Poet is to be unhappily numbered among&s;t tho&s;e men, who&s;e <HI>learning</HI> and <HI>fine parts</HI> are not able to give their yoke|mates that <HI>&s;atisfaction</HI> and <HI>content,</HI> which a weak mind with a vigorous con&s;titution is generally apt to do. How|ever, he has had three children born to him in wedlock; at the chri&s;tening of the la&s;t child, one of the good wo|men happened to blab it out to the reverend gentleman who performed the ceremony, <HI>That Mr.</HI> Duck <HI>was a man of great learning, and had wit enough to be a par&s;on; for that he could make ver&s;es like any man, and as good as ever &s;he heard in her life.</HI> Upon the recommendation of this wi&s;e woman, the doctor who is a dignified per&s;on in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> had &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e with Mr. <HI>Duck,</HI> and gave him a theme, with &s;ome directions for the improvement of his genius: But when Mr. <HI>Duck</HI> had fini&s;hed his Ver&s;es, and pre&s;ented them to him for his approbation, the Doctor recommended them to the
<PB N="iv" REF="025421_0003_0FCD2A5843EFF710">
flames. This was a mo&s;t cruel di&s;couragement; &s;o that for a long time after he was almo&s;t out of conceit with him&s;elf, and went on writing and burning, and his wife continually &s;colding, becau&s;e he neglected his labour: And when he was <HI>&s;canning</HI> his lines, &s;he would oftentimes run out and rai&s;e the whole neighbourhood, telling the people, <HI>That her Hu&s;band dealt with the Devil, and was going mad becau&s;e he did nothing all day but talk to him&s;elf, and tell his Fingers.</HI></P>
<P>But mangre this ill &s;ituation of his poetical affairs, his fame at length began to rou&s;e the Wits of <HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI> to &s;ome con&s;ideration of him, and he was admitted to the tables of a great many worthy gentlemen. He now wrote his Poem called the <HI>Shunamite,</HI> that on <HI>Poverty,</HI> and the <HI>Thre&s;her's Labour;</HI> which were handed about the coun|try with great applau&s;e, in manu&s;cript. A copy was &s;ent to the Right Honourable the Earl of <HI>Tankerville</HI> at <HI>Wind|&s;or,</HI> where the Honourable Mrs. <HI>Clayton,</HI> of her Maje&s;ty's Bed-chamber, happening to &s;ee it, that Lady immediate|ly pre&s;ented it to the Queen: The Ver&s;es became in much reputation at Court by all judges of Poetry; and the Author was then &s;ent for to <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> where her Ma|je&s;ty was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to declare, <HI>&s;he would allow him Thirty Guineas a year, and a little Hou&s;e at Richmond, till he &s;hould be better provided for.</HI></P>
<P>He was a&s;ked by a Noble Earl to write upon the <HI>Sun,</HI> but &s;aid, That <HI>as he had no true knowledge, nor had read any thing of the nature of that great Luminary, he was at pre&s;ent uncapable of &s;uch a ta&s;k.</HI> He has read <HI>Milton</HI> with &s;uch attention, (whom he e&s;teems the fir&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poets) that he can repeat the whole book by heart. The <HI>Spectators,</HI> he &s;ays, were of &s;ingular u&s;e to him, and <HI>Bai|ley</HI>'s <HI>Engli&s;h Dictionary</HI> in&s;tructed him in the &s;ignifica|tion of all words which he thought <HI>uncouth.</HI> He gave &s;uch an&s;wers as were entirely &s;atisfactory to tho&s;e who might have any &s;u&s;picion that the Poems were wrote by &s;ome other per&s;on; and as he readily accounted for every thing that &s;eemed extraordinary, it is demon&s;trable he walks in no other <HI>Stilts</HI> than tho&s;e of his own Genius, which has ju&s;tly rendered him the admiration of the pre|&s;ent age.</P>

<L>THERE's no ill on Earth which mortals fly</L>

<L>O de&s;picable name! We thee to &s;hun,</L>
<L>On every other evil blindly run.</L>
<L>For fear of thee, di&s;tru&s;tful Niggards go</L>
<L>In tatter'd rags, and &s;tarve their bodies too;</L>
<L>And &s;till are poor, for fear of being &s;o.</L>
<L>For fear of thee, the trader &s;wears and vows</L>
<L>His wares are good, altho' his con&s;cience knows</L>
<L>That he hath us'd his utmo&s;t art and &s;kill,</L>
<L>Their faults and imperfections to conceal.</L>
<L>The &s;ailor terrify'd with thoughts of thee,</L>
<L>Boldly attempts the dangers of the &s;ea:</L>
<L>From Ea&s;t to We&s;t, o'er rocks and quick-&s;ands &s;teers,</L>
<L>'Tis Poverty, 'tis that alone he fears.</L>
<L>The &s;oldier too, whom nought but thee can &s;care,</L>
<L>In hopes of plunder, bravely meets the war:</L>
<L>To fly from Poverty, he runs on death,</L>
<L>And &s;hews he prizes riches more than breath.</L>
<L>Strange terror of mankind! by thee mi&s;led,</L>
<L>Not con&s;cience, quick-&s;ands, rocks, or death, they dread;</L>
<L>And yet thou art no formidable foe,</L>
<L>Except to little &s;ouls, who think thee &s;o.</L>
<L>'Tis only the imagination, that</L>
<L>The blunted edge of Poverty can whet.</L>
<L>'Tis &s;ervile fear that does us mo&s;t affect;</L>

<L>In the dark night he oft will &s;ideways &s;quint,</L>
<L>And &s;ee's a Gobling, when there's nothing in't.</L>
</LG>

<L>Contented Poverty's no di&s;mal thing,</L>
<L>Free from the cares unwieldy riches bring:</L>

<L>Then why &s;hould phantoms di&s;compo&s;e the mind,</L>

<L>And lo&s;t their &s;en&s;es, if they chanc'd to find</L>
<L>A beauteous <HI>female</HI> cruel and unkind.</L>
<L>How oft have wretched mortals been mi&s;led,</L>
<L>With murd'rous hands their rival's blood to &s;hed?</L>
<L>While &s;ome as de&s;p'rately have &s;ought for death,</L>
<L>And by &s;elf-murder &s;topt their vital breath!</L>
<L>The <HI>King</HI> is &s;trong, no people can deny</L>
<L>The honor due to &s;ov'reign maje&s;ty:</L>
<L>All &s;tand in fear of him; his pow'r is &s;uch,</L>
<L>'Tis death to &s;trike, no le&s;s than death to touch.</L>
<L>This mighty monarch I did lately &s;py</L>
<L>In his chair of &s;tate, fair <HI>Apame</HI> &s;itting by;</L>
<L>At his right hand this youthful beauty bright,</L>
<L>Appear'd like <HI>Cynthia</HI>'s glitt'ring rays of light;</L>
<L>Altho' he did the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> &s;cepter &s;way,</L>
<L>This blooming lady took his crown away;</L>
<L>The diadem that on his head was worn,</L>
<L>Her lovely brows and temples did adorn;</L>
<L>Nay furthermore, when &s;he had done this thing,</L>
<L>With her left hand &s;he &s;truck this pui&s;&s;ant king,</L>
<L>Yet no di&s;plea&s;ure did in him ari&s;e,</L>
<L>Who was a captive to her conqu'ring eyes:</L>
<L>Her radiant beauty did &s;uch beams di&s;play,</L>
<L>From her he could not turn his eyes away:</L>
<L>If this illu&s;trious <HI>Lady</HI> deign'd to &s;mile,</L>
<L>O'ercome with joy, the <HI>King</HI> would laugh the while:</L>
<L>If ought di&s;pleas'd her, then the <HI>King</HI> would try</L>
<L>With gentle words the <HI>Dame</HI> to pacify.</L>
<L>What mortal &s;trength with <HI>Women</HI> can compare,</L>
<L>Since crowned Heads to them obedient are?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The king and princes then began to gaze,</L>
<L>And look upon each other with amaze;</L>
<L>For now they very plainly did de&s;cry,</L>
<L>This noble prince would have the victory;</L>
<L><PB REF="025421_0038_0FCD2A9C39297028" MS="y">Who, having paus'd, began to &s;peak again,</L>

<L>All things at fir&s;t were made, Earth, Sea, and Land!</L>

<L>All men on earth of high and low degree,</L>
<L>Are &s;ubject unto &s;in and vanity;</L>
<L>De&s;truction does on wickedne&s;s attend,</L>

<L>Not only &s;trong, but good beyond compare;</L>
<L>No wicked men with <HI>him</HI> accepted are:</L>
<L>No rich reward, no golden bribe can buy</L>
<L>Licen&s;e from <HI>Truth</HI> to act unfaithfully:</L>

<L>Good men embrace it with a ready mind:</L>
<L>Whatever thing is virtuous, good, and great,</L>
<L>In <HI>Truth</HI> we find it perfect and complete:</L>
