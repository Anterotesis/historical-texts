<OPENER><SALUTE>Poor Sinners!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Send the&s;e Truths from the Eternal GOD to you in Love &amp; Faithfulne&s;s; unfeignedly de&s;iring that you may be convinced of your Unbelief, and of all your Sins, and of your pre&s;ent accur&s;ed and condemned State, and that you may be taught of God to rely upon Chri&s;t, who died for the ungodly. If you continue unrege|nerate, you will certainly ere long be the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of the whole Creation, and Monuments of divine Ju&s;tice, altho' you now enjoy the World in its Glory. Since divers of you are awakened, I hope that God may have Thoughts of everla&s;ting Love to &s;ome of your Souls: therefore as I have warned you to flee for Refuge from the Wrath of God
<PB N="4" REF="004702_0003_100DBC16125803B0">which is coming upon you &amp; without delay, pre&s;ently to come out of this dreadful Con|dition, to Chri&s;t, who will embrace you; &s;o I write to you, and to all others to whom the&s;e Truths may be communicated, to pre|vent their mi&s;carrying in Conver&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Seek to know and be convinced by the Spi|rit thro' the Scriptures, that you are born dead in Sins and Children of Wrath, without Chri&s;t, and without Hope:</HI> Eph 2 3, 12. And that you lie every Moment under God's Cur&s;e and Wrath; in danger of eternal Condemnation; <HI>Gal</HI> 3 10 <HI>The Wicked &s;hall be turned into Hell,</HI> P&s;al 9.17 <HI>The Soul thas &s;inneth it &s;hall die,</HI> Ezek 18 4. Unbelievers &s;hall not &s;ee Life, but the Wrath of God abideth on them, though they are in&s;en&s;ible of it. The Lord &s;aith <HI>Except a Man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the Kingdom of God:</HI> And <HI>he that believeth not is condemned already,</HI> Joh. 3.3, 18, 36. Con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly then, each of you, I be&s;eech you, <Q>What will become of me, who am not born again, nor ever had the Experience of a Work of Grace?</Q> O that your Eyes were open to behold all the Sins of your Hearts &amp; Lives, in order before you, which may cry aloud continually for Vengeance again&s;t your guilty Souls! 'Twere enough to make you tremble, who are now mo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s. Retire alone quick|ly, and reflect upon your Ways as in the Sight of God. Put the&s;e Que&s;tions to your &s;elves,&mdash;<Q>Have not I &s;ometimes Lyed, or
<PB N="5" REF="004702_0003_100DBC16125803B0">Stole, or &s;wore an Oath? Have I not pro|phaned the Lord's Day? Was I never Proud, nor Wanton, nor Malicious? Have I ne|ver taken the Lord's Name in vain? Have I not been di&s;obedient to my Parents? Have I not a carnal, unclean, hard and unbelieving Heart? Did I never break God's Laws? Am not I dead in Sins to this Day? Yea &s;urely I mu&s;t cry out, Guil|ty, guilty: My Con&s;cience condemns me. What will become of me if I die in this dreadful Condition? For the righteous God hath &s;aid, <HI>Cur&s;ed is every one that con|tinueth not in all Things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them</HI> He that &s;pared not the Angels when they &s;in|ned, but ca&s;t them down to Hell: He that &s;pared not the old World, nor the Cities of <HI>Sodom</HI> &amp; <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> but condemned them with an overthrow, making them an Ex|ample unto tho&s;e which after &s;hould live ungodly, will not &s;pare me long. Does not Hell gape for me? Is there any hopes that &s;uch a Sinner as I have been, may be wa&s;hed in the Blood of Chri&s;t? God may righteou&s;ly damn me for the&s;e Sins, or for the lea&s;t Sin; <HI>Rom.</HI> 3 23. It is of the Lord's Mercy that I am not con&s;umed, and now in Hell, howling among the damned, crying out for a Drop of Water to cool my Tongue; <HI>Lam.</HI> 3 22 <HI>Luk.</HI> 16.24.</Q></P>

Follow Chri&s;t, crying after him as the blind Man did, <HI>Lord, that our Eyes may be opened,</HI> Mat. 20 30.

A Per&s;on may go very far under the awakenings of Con&s;cience, and have a Zeal of God, &amp; yet being ignorant of God's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, go about all his Life time to e&s;tabli&s;h his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and get no|thing at la&s;t but the Hypocrites Hope, which &s;hall peri&s;h.

'Tis true, Faith comes by hearing, and 'tis our Duty to attend on God's Appointments, where the Spirit works; but if Righteou&s;|ne&s;s come by any Work of the Law, then Chri&s;t is dead in vain, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.21. To him that worketh not in the Point of Ju&s;tification, but believeth on him that ju&s;tifyeth the un|godly, his Faith is counted for Righteou&s;ne&s;s:

<P N="3">3. <HI>Lock to the Lord to convince you of Sin, becau&s;e you believe not in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which is promi&s;ed,</HI> John 16 7.8, 9. In your At|tendance on the Means of Grace, be willing to be convinced by the Comforter, that your Hearts are &s;o de&s;perately wicked that you will not come to Chri&s;t; and to &s;eel your Impotency, that you cannot believe in him, unle&s;s the Lord put forth the exceeding Greatne&s;s of his Power, <HI>Bph.</HI> 1.19.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Know a&s;&s;uredly, and welcome the&s;e glad Tidings, that Chri&s;t is come of a Truth into the World on purpo&s;e to &s;ave Sinners, and the chiefe&s;t of them,</HI> 1 Tim 1.15. <HI>God &s;o loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not pe|ri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting Life.</HI> John 3.19. <HI>Chri&s;t havh once &s;uffered sins, the Ju&s;t for the Unju&s;t, that he might bring us to God,</HI> 1 Pet. 3.18 Fice to this Refuge when thou &s;ee&s;t thy&s;elf ungodly, and accur&s;ed by the Law of God, and &s;eare&s;t thou &s;halt be condemned. Con&s;ider with thy &s;elf, tho' I am ungodly, yet Chri&s;t died for the Un|godly, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5 6. Though I am an Enemy, yet Chri&s;t hath reconciled Enemies to God by his Death. <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 10. Though I am rebellious, and &s;o abominable, that I fear le&s;t the Earth &s;hould open and &s;wallow up &s;uch a Wretch, and God &s;hould righteou&s;ly &s;ink me to Hell, living, and in his Wrath; yet
<PB N="9" REF="004702_0005_100DBC1A8A1C7870">here's good News and Encouragement for me, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t when he a&s;cended on high received Gi&s;ts for Men, yea, for the rebellious al&s;o, that the Lord might dwell among the Rebellious, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 68.18. Tho' I am accur&s;ed, and I fee evidently God threatens to damn me in many Scriptures, yet is there Hopes for &s;uch a condemned &s;inner, &s;ince Chri&s;t hath redeemed accur&s;ed &s;inners from the Cur&s;e of the Law, being made a Cur&s;e for them, that they might re|ceive the Ble&s;&s;ing of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and the Pro|mi&s;e of the Spirit, <HI>Gal</HI> 3.13, 14.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, becau&s;e 'tis the Command of God and plea&s;ing in his Sight, and thy Duty, though thou can&s;t &s;ee no other Warrant or Ground of Encouragement.</HI> It is not only thy Privilege, but thy Duty to be|lieve. <HI>This is his Commandment, that we &s;hould-believe on the Name of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> 1 John 3 22, 23. <HI>Believe on the Lord Je&s;us and thou &s;halt be &s;aved,</HI> Act. 16.31. Chri&s;t tells Hypocrites that &s;ought him for their Bellies, <HI>This is the Work of God, that ye believe on him whom God hath &s;ent,</HI> Joh. 6 28, 29. Apply the Word thus for thy &s;elf; the righteous God that knows all my hainous Sins, in&s;tead of condemning me for them, commands me to believe on his Son, and a&s;&s;ures me that I &s;hall be &s;aved. The Lord give thee the Spirit of Wi&s;dom and Revelation in the Knowledge of Chri&s;t, and the Obedience of Faith. The Voice of the

Hearken therefore to the ravi&s;hing Voice of Chri&s;t, altho' thou maye&s;t judge thy&s;elf the vile&s;t and chiefe&s;t of Sinners, and maye&s;t ve|rily think there may be Marcy for others, but there is none for &s;uch a great mon&s;trous Sin|ner as thou ha&s;t been; yet here's the joy|ful Sound, that the Son of Man, God mani|fe&s;t in the Fle&s;h, is come to &s;eek and &s;ave that which was lo&s;t, <HI>Luk</HI> 19.10</P>
<P>How dreadful &s;oever thy Condition may be in thy own Thoughts, yet Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>Him that cometh to me I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out,</HI> Joh. 6.37. Though you therefore feel hard and dead Hearts, yet come as Sinners

<P N="9">9. <HI>Never attempt to believe or repent in thy own Strength, but look unto Fe&s;us in whom it hath plea&s;ed the Father all Fullne&s;s &s;hould dwell,</HI> Col. 1.19 As thou would'&s;t not prove a rotten Hypocrite, beware of a dead Faith of thy own forming, which is not the Faith of the Operation of God, <HI>Col</HI> 2 12.

<P>Object. <HI>Surely it were better for me to de|&s;troy my &s;elf,</HI> (&s;aith another) <HI>under Tempta|tion, than to live only to aggravate my Dam|nation. I am condemned already, God hath &s;et me up as a Monument of his Wrath; why &s;hould I live any longer in this Torment?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. Take heed of Soul wounding Sins, and lea&s;t you run away from Chri&s;t by Un|belief, after falls into them. Some fin a|gain&s;t Light, and then in&s;tead of flying to the Blood of &s;prinkling, they depart away farther by their Unbelief, than they did by their back&s;liding into Sin; and entertaining hard Thoughts of God and Chri&s;t in the Pride
<PB N="30" REF="004702_0016_100DBC3355537900">of their Hearts, they will rather attempt to take a de&s;perate Cour&s;e, than &s;ubmit to the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, and fall down at the Feet of Chri&s;t, who&s;e Arms are open to re|seive the chiefe&s;t of Sinners.</P>
<P N="2">2. If thou had&s;t lain &s;corching in ever|la&s;ting Burnings, thou would think it a rich Mercy to be on this &s;ide Hell again: There are done to &s;ympathize with thee, or to pray for thee or to give thee a Drop of Water to cool thy Tongue.</P>
<P N="3">3. Although thy pre&s;ent Condition be deplorable, yet be not thine own Executioner, if God will give thee a Reprieve in the World. When thou are tempted to it, I &s;olemnly Charge thee to remember that God hath forbidden it, &s;aying, <HI>Thou &s;halt not kill.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. In the Hour of Temptation go not out in thine own Strength; look to Chri&s;t, and keep thine hold of him, who is able to keep thee from falling. The Lord hath laid Help upon one that is Mighty, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 89.19.</P>
<P N="5">5. Give no Place to the Devil. Be not affrighted from continuing in thy Calling: the Lord hath promi&s;ed to keep thee in all thy Ways, and his Angels &s;hall have Charge over thee, <HI>P&s;alm</HI> 91.11, 12.</P>
<P N="6">6. Thou art gro&s;ly mi&s;taken in thinking no Ca&s;e like thine, for no Temptation hath taken you, but &s;uch as is common to Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10 13. Many of God's dear Children have been as vehemently a&s;&s;aulted with &s;uch helli&s;h Temptations, tho' thou thinke&s;t
<PB N="31" REF="004702_0016_100DBC3355537900">thy Ca&s;e cannot be parallel'd, and have been recovered, and their Unbelief, and all their &s;ad Conclu&s;ions confuted.</P>
<P N="7">7. When thou art tempted to Sin, flee to that Promi&s;e, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 54.17. No Weapon that is formed again&s;t thee &s;hall pro&s;per. The God of Peace &s;hall brui&s;e Satan under thy Feet &s;hortly, <HI>Rom</HI> 16 20. God is faithful, who will not &s;uffer thee to be tempted a|bove that thou art able, but will with the Temptation, al&s;o make a way to e&s;cape, that thou maye&s;t be able to bear it.</P>
<P>Object. <HI>I fear I &s;hall faint in an Hour of Tryal.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. This godly Fear is a &s;pecial Pre|&s;ervative promi&s;ed in the New-Covenant again&s;t all Temptations to Sin, and Apo&s;ta&s;y, <HI>Jer.</HI> 32.40.</P>
<P N="2">2. Watch and Pray always that thou may&s;t be accounted worthy to e&s;cape all Things, that &s;hall come to pa&s;s, and to &s;tand before the Son of Man, <HI>Luke</HI> 21.36.</P>
<P N="3">3. Go not out in thine own Strength; for the eternal God is thy Refuge, and under|neath are everla&s;ting Arms. Be thou Par|taker of the Afflictions of the Go&s;pel accord|ing to the Power of God. Be &s;trong in the all-&s;ufficient Grace, which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2 1. Look to Chri&s;t to &s;trengthen thee with all Might according to God's glorious Power unto all Patience and Long-Suffering with joyfulne&s;s. The Archers &s;orely grieved <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> and &s;hot at him, but his Bow abode
<PB N="32" REF="004702_0017_100DBC363764E880">in Strength, and the Arms of his Hands were &s;trong by the Hands of the mighty God of <HI>Jacob, Gen.</HI> 49, 23, 24.</P>
<P N="4">4 God's Word is a tried Word. Behold the great Cloud of Witne&s;&s;es from the be|ginning of the World to this Day, all &s;et|ting their Seals of the Faithfulne&s;s of God to his exceeding great and precious Promi&s;es.</P>
<P N="5">5 Behold Chri&s;t's wonderful Love in leav|ing his Throne of Glory and his Father's Bo&s;om, and hanging upon the Cro&s;s in thy Nature, bearing the Wrath of God for all thy mon&s;trous Sins. This will con&s;train thee to follow God fully, to follow the Lamb whither&s;oever he goeth, and to continue with him in his Temptations. Look to Chri&s;t to &s;hed abroad his Lovs in thy Heart by his Spirit. Love is &s;trong as Death; many Wa|ters cannot quench Love, nor Floods drown it.</P>
<P>Object. Saith another, <HI>I have been long un|der fearful Temptations to foul and damnable Sins, &s;urely I am an Hypocrite, I live an Hell upon Earth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Caution.</HI> I would not have any &s;elf deceiv|ed Hypocrite, who allows him&s;elf delight|fully in a Cour&s;e of &s;ecret Sinning to cheat him&s;elf with this, that his reigning Sins are but Infirmities, becau&s;e his Con&s;cience &s;tings him after the commi&s;&s;ion of Sin.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. Flee to the Blood of Chri&s;t, to wa&s;h away the Guilt of thy &s;carlet Sins; and the Sen&s;e of God's pardoning Love &s;hed a|broad in thy Heart, will be one of the mo&s;t
<PB N="33" REF="004702_0017_100DBC363764E880">effectual Means in the World to keep thee from returning again to Folly. It is mo&s;t evident from <HI>Paul</HI>'s Experience, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2 20. that looking to Chri&s;t crucified for thy Sins and Back&s;lidings, is the mo&s;t expedite help to be crucified together with him, that the Body of Sin may be de&s;troyed. The <HI>Corin|thians</HI> experienced, that by beholding as in a Gla&s;s the Glory of the Lord <HI>(i. e.)</HI> the Riches of God's Grace and Forgivene&s;s through the Blood of Chri&s;t they were changed into the &s;ame Image, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.14. The Manife&s;tations of God's pardoning Love to thee, will con&s;train thee; This will be thy practical Judgment; if Chri&s;t died for thee, when thou wa&s;t an Enemy, therefore thou that live&s;t &s;hould'&s;t not henceforth live unto thy &s;elf, but unto him that died for thee and ro&s;e again, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. If the Grace of God which brings Salvation appear to thee, 'twill teach thee to deny ungodline&s;s and worldly Lu&s;ts; it will work evangelical Repentance in thee; it will di&s;&s;olve thy frozen Heart that thou &s;halt remember thy Ways and be confounded and never open thy Mouth becau&s;e of thy Shame, when thou be holde&s;t that God is pacified towards thee, for all that thou ha&s;t done, <HI>Ezek,</HI> 16.61.</P>
<P>Therefore after thy Falls, tho' thy Heart be dead and &s;tupid, yet run quickly to Chri&s;t with confu&s;ion of Face, who is exalted to give Repentance, and Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, <HI>Act,</HI> 5.31. Believe &s;tedfa&s;tly, though thou
<PB N="34" REF="004702_0018_100DBC37DE59FD30">ha&s;t Sinned, yet thou ha&s;t an Advocate with the Father, <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> the Righteous, who ever liveth to make Interce&s;&s;ion for Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 2.2. Do not Work at all for Peace, or Healing, thereby fru&s;trating the Death of Chri&s;t, but believe in Chri&s;t who was delivered for our Offences, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.25.</P>
<P N="2">2. When thou ha&s;t Sinned, run not farther from God by Unbelief, than thou ha&s;t done by thy Back&s;lidings. Pluck not up the Foundation pre&s;ently. This is one of Satan's Subtilties, by enticing thee to Sin, to break thy Peace, to torment and bewilder thee, and to take thee off thy Work, and U&s;efulne&s;s for God. Many Sins may cau&s;e matter of Humi|liation, but not of que&s;tioning our E&s;tates.</P>
<P N="3">3. Go out in the Strength of Chri&s;t, and thou &s;halt overcome at la&s;t, <HI>Eph.</HI> 6 9, 10. &amp;c. One Cau&s;e of our Falls in the Hour of Temp|tations, is our going forth in the Confidence of received Grace. Therefore live continu|ally under the actual Conviction, and Sen&s;e of thine inability to re&s;i&s;t the lea&s;t Tempta|tion, and abide in Chri&s;t, in whom all Ful|ne&s;s dwells</P>
<P N="4">4. It will be di&s;tingui&s;hing Love from God; if thou through the Injection of fiery Darts and other Temptations, thou art kept awake from Luke-warmne&s;s and from a Spirit of Slumber and Security, the epidemical Sin of this Hour of Temptation which prevails ex|ceedingly upon Saints, &amp; the World, not with|&s;tanding
<PB N="35" REF="004702_0018_100DBC37DE59FD30">all awakening Di&s;pen&s;ations, ac|cording to Chri&s;t's Prediction, <HI>Mat.</HI> 34.25.</P>
<P N="5">5. It may be thy Temptations may con|tinue all thy Life: Long not &s;o much for Deliverance as for Strength to re&s;i&s;t. Out of a &s;lothful Principle, we often cry earne&s;tly for Victory; therefore Temptations &s;till con|tinue. Ob&s;erve Chri&s;t's An&s;wer to <HI>Paul,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. There was no Deliverance from the Thorn in the Fle&s;h; but my Grace is &s;ufficient for thee, for my Strength is made perfect through Weakne&s;s. Be confident of this; Sin &s;hall not have Dominion over thee, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6. Becau&s;e thou art not under the Law, but under the Reign of Grace; and that God will give thee Power when thou art faint, and will increa&s;e thy Strength when thou ba&s;t no might, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 40. And in the Faith of the &s;ull Promi&s;es, purcha&s;ed by Chri&s;t's Blood, take Courage: Glory in thine Infirmities, becau&s;e of the Power of Chri&s;t, which &s;hall re&s;t upon thee. Rejoyce not again&s;t me, O mine Enemy; when I fall I &s;hall ari&s;e, when I &s;it in Darkne&s;s the Lord &s;hall be a Light unto me. Rejoyce in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, by, and in whom thou ha&s;t already overcome the World, and art more than a Conqueror, and art rai&s;ed up together, and made to &s;it toge|ther in heavenly Places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>Fight again&s;t Sin, the World, the Law, Death, and the Powers of Darkne&s;s, as a|gain&s;t conquered Enemies. Pray believing|ly for that Purcha&s;e of Chri&s;t, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. that
<PB N="36" REF="004702_0019_100DBC3B45F8E670">as Sin hath reigned unto Death in thee, Grace may now reign through Righteou&s;|ne&s;s to eternal Life. Rejoyce in Hope of everla&s;ting Re&s;t; where thou will more ad|mire the Power and Wi&s;dom of God in lead|ing and unholding a poor weak Worm through &s;uch &s;ad De&s;ertions, and Tempta|tions, and inextricable Labyrinths, than if thou had&s;t a calm Way to Glory. To him that overcometh, &s;aith Chri&s;t, will I grant to &s;it with me in my Throne, even as I o|vercome, and am &s;et down with my Father in his Throne, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.21.</P>
<P>Now unto Him, who is able to keep us from falling, and to pre&s;ent us faultle&s;s be|fore the Pre&s;ence of his Glory, with exceed|ing Joy, be Honour and Dominion for ever.</P>
