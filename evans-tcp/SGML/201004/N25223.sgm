<HEAD>SECOND PROPOSITION. <HI>The companies a&s;&s;umed the term, fee-&s;imple, and all the re&s;pon&s;ibility attached to it.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE evidence that they a&s;&s;umed the term is pre|&s;ented in the 7th &s;ection of the &s;econd article of the con&s;titution of the Georgia Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi Company.</P>
<P>"The Pre&s;ident and a majority of the whole Board of Directors and Executive Board collective|ly, &s;hall have power, and they are hereby fully au|thori&s;ed to &s;ell, and the grantees &s;hall convey any part or parts, or the whole of the territory and rights, granted and conveyed to the Company, to any per|&s;on or per&s;ons in FEE SIMPLE."</P>
<P>EVERY holder of Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi &s;cript was entitled by virtue of his purcha&s;e and certificate to have and hold <HI>to him&s;elf and his heirs and a&s;&s;igns forever,</HI> his propor|tion of the lands in <HI>fee &s;imple.</HI> All the other com|panies a&s;&s;umed the term, <HI>fee &s;imple</HI>&mdash;and the deeds to the northern purcha&s;ers generally expre&s;s a convey|ance in the very words of the original deeds&mdash;but whether expre&s;&s;ed or not, every purcha&s;er is entitled to the fee &s;imple by virtue of the public declaration made to the world, that the lands were thus holden and conveyed. Whenever a &s;eller conveys lands in fee &s;imple, he pledges his profits, his payments and his own property on the ve&s;ting of this kind of e&s;tate in the grantee. If the fee &s;imple fails and he has done this ignorantly, yet he mu&s;t replace the buyer in as good a &s;ituation as the buyer would have been, had the fee &s;imple ve&s;ted; but if he has u&s;ed the ex|pre&s;&s;ion fraudulently to allure and deceive purcha&s;ers, he mu&s;t refund the money paid and re&s;pond in dam|ages.

<HEAD>THIRD PROPOSITION. <HI>The &s;tate of Georgia never had any right to the fee &s;imple of the lands, conveyed to the companies.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AN e&s;tate in fee &s;imple, is the large&s;t and noble&s;t e&s;tate, that a man can have in real property. The proprietor of &s;uch e&s;tate is inve&s;ted with an ab&s;olute power to improve and di&s;po&s;e of his land as he plea&s;es.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Swift's Sy&s;tem.</NOTE> A fee is an e&s;tate of inheritance, being the highe&s;t intere&s;t, that a man can have in lands. When the word <HI>fee</HI> is u&s;ed with the addition of the word <HI>&s;im|ple,</HI> it denotes an unconditional, unlimited e&s;tate. The fee &s;imple in lands being the large&s;t po&s;&s;ible e&s;|tate, comprehends all inferior and le&s;&s;er e&s;tates, into which it may be divided.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Black. 10.</NOTE> This is the actual por|tion of e&s;tate to which the northern purcha&s;ers are en|titled.</P>
<P>OF the quality and value of vi&s;ible e&s;tate the buy|er may judge; but as the portion of e&s;tate which the &s;eller has a right to convey, often depends on a long &s;eries of papers in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;eller or on con&s;truction of law, the uniform pre&s;umption is that the &s;eller knows the foundation of his title and his portion of e&s;tate; therefore every expre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed by the &s;eller, expre&s;&s;ing the kind of e&s;tate, is &s;tric|ly con&s;trued and if he &s;hould &s;ell the fee &s;imple, when he owned but a le&s;&s;er e&s;tate, he mu&s;t &s;ave harmle&s;s the buyer from all lo&s;s, co&s;t and damage occa&s;ioned by the failure of the fee &s;imple. For this purpo&s;e the buyer has no need of covenants. His right of indemnity re&s;ults from this principle of common equity, <Q>That the &s;eller &s;hall cau&s;e the buyer to have that for which he received the money or &s;e|curities of the buyer.</Q></P>
<P>THE money of the northern purcha&s;ers has been paid or their notes have been given for the fee &s;im|ple
<PB N="48" REF="033425_0008_0FF7C438DE4757C0">of the lands, and if the State of Georgia owned this unlimited e&s;tate, there mu&s;t have been &s;ome time at which they began to own it and &s;ome &s;ource from which it mu&s;t have been derived.</P>
<P>THE author of the &s;tate of facts well aware that the right of the &s;tate to &s;ell the fee was all important, has a&s;&s;umed the burden of proving it.

<P><Q>THE Spaniards, who made the fir&s;t di&s;covery of America, claimed a right to exclude all other nations from making e&s;tabli&s;hments in this va&s;t extent of country: But other nations refu&s;ed to admit this ab&s;urd claim, in re&s;pect to &s;uch parts as the Span|iards had never even vi&s;ited. The Spaniards in 1521 di&s;covered, and &s;oon after made a &s;ettlement in Ea&s;t Florida. The French &s;ome time after this, &s;ettled in Canada and from thence having acci|dentally found the great river Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, and pur|&s;uing its cour&s;e, they di&s;covered Loui&s;iana, and in 1699 &s;ettled a colony at Mobile. The Engli&s;h, in 1607, made their fir&s;t American &s;ettlement in Vir|ginia&mdash;The&s;e three powerful nations, having each got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a part, di&s;puted about the extent of their &s;everal boundaries in the&s;e immen&s;e re|gions, through which an almo&s;t infinite number of Indian tribes were di&s;per&s;ed. Each claimed <HI>an exclu&s;ive right</HI> of purcha&s;ing from the natives
<PB N="49" REF="033425_0009_0FF7C43A8A7984C0">&s;uch lands, as lay within the limits they cho&s;e to &s;et to them&s;elves; the &s;overeignty of which they al|&s;o claimed: and this right of excluding other na|tions from purcha&s;ing the Indian lands, within &s;uch limits, is the foundation of <HI>the right of pre-emption.</HI> The&s;e di&s;putes gave ri&s;e to the war, that was end|ed by the treaty of Paris, between France, Spain, and Great-Britain; by which in fact the principle of the right of pre-emption is recognized, in as much as many Indian tribes were living within the limits of each, as then agreed on.</Q></P>
<P>IT &s;eems that the Spaniards, who claim to have fir&s;t di&s;covered this country, had (as they termed it) an indi&s;putable right by the gift of Pope Alexander the 6th to the property and dominions of all the con|tinents, i&s;lands and &s;eas between the arctic and ant|arctic poles, &amp;c.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chandler's com. debates, vol. II. page 52.</NOTE> The French and Engli&s;h after|wards got footing here, and the&s;e three powerful nations not agreeing, went to war, made a peace and then recogni&s;ed each others rights. <HI>Their quar|reling created the right, their treaty confirmed it!</HI></P>
<P>ON this foundation is laid the whole building of pre-emptive rights and on this is rai&s;ed all the claim of the &s;tate of Georgia to the fee-&s;imple of the lands, de&s;cribed in the companies deeds.&mdash;The author of the State of Facts has traced the whole from this or|igin and if his out&s;et were good, his conclu&s;ions in favor of the right of the &s;tate would be plau&s;ible at lea&s;t: But what are the facts?</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. THE Indians were the fir&s;t di&s;coverers of this country, and if fir&s;t di&s;covery and continued occu|pancy gives title according to the laws of nature and nations<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The law of nature con&s;i&s;ts in an application of the moral law to the condition of man. The law of nations is an adoption of the law of nature and an agreement in its application. This law, &s;ays Ju&s;tin|ian, is common to all the human race. This law guarantees to the fir&s;t di&s;coverer and occupant of any created thing an exclu&s;ive title; &s;o that a forcible extermination of &s;uch an one is a violence to this law. Camb. Elem.</NOTE> they had acquired an unque&s;tionable title.
<PB N="50" REF="033425_0010_0FF7C43D81D4CBB8">How many moons or centuries they had been here, when the Spaniards fir&s;t di&s;covered that they lived here, is to us wholly unknown. It is enough to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, that the Spaniards did not fir&s;t di&s;|cover this country, and tho&s;e, who are very &s;olicitous to decide which has the honor of <HI>di&s;covering</HI> this country, Columbus or Ve&s;pu&s;ius or Don Juan, may more di&s;cerningly direct their hi&s;torical re&s;earches to &s;ome tawny warrior of &s;ome far di&s;tant age.</P>
<P N="2">2d. THE di&s;covery of the Spaniards, that this country was inhabited by peaceful inoffen&s;ive tribes, living on fi&s;hing and hunting, gave them no right to the &s;oil, nor to the pre-emption of the &s;oil; for the &s;ame law of nature which had given to the Indians the fee as fir&s;t occupants, had al&s;o given them a right of &s;elling it to whoever they plea&s;ed.</P>
<P N="3">3d. THE gift of Pope Alexander, (being only an abridgment of his predece&s;&s;or's proffer of all the kingdoms of the earth) partakes too much of the ri|diculous to be admitted as a &s;erious ground of claim; yet this is as &s;ub&s;tantial, and certainly as &s;anctified a claim as ever was made by any chri&s;tian nation to the pre-emption of Indian lands.</P>
<P N="4">4th. THAT the French di&s;covered the Indians and Spaniards in this country, and that the Engli&s;h found them all here, is no &s;erious ground of claim again&s;t the Indians: for they are a party deeply intere&s;ted in this tran&s;action.</P>
<P N="5">5th. THAT the Spani&s;h, French and Engli&s;h could not agree in the ratio in which they might &s;everally defraud and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e fir&s;t di&s;coverers and oc|cupants&mdash;and that they went to war about it&mdash;and
<PB N="51" REF="033425_0011_0FF7C40186DE8B80">that they got tired of fighting and made a treaty at Paris&mdash;and that they then agreed on this ratio, are rather arguments of the ravenous and in&s;atiable &s;pirit of tho&s;e days, than of the right of either to the &s;oil or pre-emption of this country.</P>
<P N="6">6th. THAT the king of Great Britain after this treaty, granted and patented out this country to the minions of his court and officers of his army, is no argument that he owned the fee or right of pre-emp|tion; even if conque&s;t had given him title to any part, that could not extend to parts not conquered: therefore his patenting from &s;ea to &s;ea is rather to be con&s;idered as the vapouring of power, than as an evidence of right. But this may be otherwi&s;e ac|counted for;&mdash;the ignorance of the geography of this country, at that di&s;tant period, and even within the pre&s;ent century was great.&mdash;A man le&s;s &s;ubject than I am to a reverence for royalty and thrones would be apt to conceive that the kings of tho&s;e days con&s;idered this continent as &s;pread from north to &s;outh, like a piece of cloth upon a &s;hop board, which they as arch taylors, were to cut into patterns according to the fancy of their employers: indeed a map of this country, exhibits &s;uch &s;la&s;hing, as &s;hows its having been, at &s;ome time or other, roughly han|dled by the head &s;ervants of his Maje&s;ty's Lords of the bed-chamber.</P>
<P N="7">7th. FROM the farcical parade of Briti&s;h charters we come to the declaration of independence, at which time the author of the &s;tate of facts contends, <Q>that the limits of the thirteen Briti&s;h colonies, as fixed by the king's charters or letters patent, were ad|mitted as the bounds of the juri&s;diction of each, without regard to the tribes of Indians living within &s;uch limits.</Q> This is a new way of &s;liding up a title. Pray were the Indians a party to this ad|mi&s;&s;ion and confederation? Did they agree to be
<PB N="52" REF="033425_0012_0FF7C43FA4BE8A38">&s;ubject to &s;uch juri&s;dictions? Are they to &s;uffer the lo&s;s of all things to pay for the introduction of white people among them? Or are they laboring under &s;ome hidden cur&s;e, which the policy of the wi&s;eacres of this world is forever to conceal? They have been &s;uffering and retreating, till one would think that even power and avarice would &s;ay, it is enough. If there ever was rea&s;on for &s;warms to ri&s;e from older countries and to &s;ettle in this, they have already more than room enough for their hives: but be that as it may, the Indians now live in the country, de&s;cribed in the companies deeds. Their progenitors lived there long before the days of Columbus. They have oc|cupied and improved it&mdash;they have never abandoned it, nor been driven from it, and by the United States are recogni&s;ed in treaties. The northern people have been accu&s;tomed to purcha&s;e land of Indians willing to &s;ell, and the purcha&s;ers have regarded the Indians as <HI>lords of the &s;oil, till deeds were obtained from them:</HI> So &s;ay the deeds in the records of the ancient colony of New-Haven: There the Indians conveyed <HI>the lands</HI> not their right of hunting and fi&s;hing on them&mdash;but can any one contemplate the lands in que&s;tion and &s;ay that the &s;tate of Georgia owned the fee, &s;o that Gov. Matthews could with propriety convey the lands in fee &s;imple? For &s;uch is the expre&s;&s;ion in the deeds, <HI>In fee &s;imple as tenants in common and not as joint-tenants.</HI> There is no &s;uch thing. The &s;tate of Georgia do not now pretend to the fee: The above words were in&s;erted for the purpo&s;e of delu&s;ion. Congre&s;s di&s;|avow the idea of &s;tates claiming the fee of Indian lands. If the term could ever have been tolerably applied to any part of the Indian country at any period, &s;ince the &s;ettlement of this country; yet certainly the ap|plication of it to lands &s;ituated as the&s;e are, is wholly ab&s;urd.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="033425_0013_0FF7C4412D8726C0">
By the laws of nature and nations, and by the laws of the United States the Indians have a right in fee and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to all the lands, de&s;cribed in the companies deeds, and to all the attributes of this right as fully and ab&s;olutely as the people of Connecticut can have to their lands, and no act of di&s;covery, con|que&s;t, or occupancy, has ever ve&s;ted any white na|tion with any &s;emblance of title to the&s;e lands. No act of dereliction or di&s;u&s;e on the part of the Indians has ever left a moments opening to any po&s;&s;ible claim of this kind&mdash;hence <HI>the repeated declarations of the &s;tate of Georgia&mdash;their negociations with Congre&s;s&mdash;the nature of &s;overeignty&mdash;the implications of the Con. of the U. S.&mdash;the extent of boundaries claimed by the &s;tate, and the treaty of peace;</HI> &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted on by the author of the &s;tate of facts amount to nothing, becau&s;e they are built on nothing. Tis not enough that three powerful nations recogni&s;ed each others right to the fee or pre-emption of Indian lands. Such a right mu&s;t fir&s;t have exi&s;ted; el&s;e a recognition was ab&s;urd. That it did not exi&s;t has been &s;hewn as clearly as a negative propo&s;ition can be &s;hewn, and a plau&s;ible affirmative on the origin of this right has never been u&s;hered into our world. The long continued, actual and peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fir&s;t di&s;coverers is an in&s;tant and ample confutation of all that can be &s;aid in favor of the right of the &s;tate of Georgia to &s;ell the fee of the&s;e lands.</P>
<P>I HAVE dwelt thus fully on this &s;ubject, becau&s;e the &s;tate of Georgia in the granting act expre&s;&s;ed a conveyance of the fee-&s;imple&mdash;becau&s;e the grantees in their deeds to the northern purcha&s;ers expre&s;&s;ed a conveyance of the fee; becau&s;e the State of Facts publi&s;hed by the companies declares (page 12) the right of the companies to have been a <HI>right ab&s;olute</HI> in the &s;oil&mdash;and becau&s;e under the influence of the&s;e delu&s;ions the advocates for the granting act are attempt|ing
<PB N="54" REF="033425_0014_0FF7C406CF1D4340">to confound this &s;ubject by applying to it all the mazy principles, which in foreign countries have been drawn from feodal &s;y&s;tems and landed tenures.</P>
<P>FROM the premi&s;es may be drawn the following conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. THE Georgia &s;ellers, in &s;elling the fee of tho&s;e lands, &s;old that which they did not own&mdash;the granting act was no good evidence of a title to &s;ell the fee&mdash;nothing has pa&s;&s;ed by their deeds and the con&s;ideration of the bargains has wholly failed. I &s;ay <HI>wholly,</HI> becau&s;e from my premi&s;es the right of pre-emption, if it exi&s;ted, would be as worthle&s;s as the claim to the fee is unfounded; but &s;uppo&s;e that the right of pre-emption were of &s;ome value; yet the &s;eller is not obliged to admit it even as a partial con&s;ideration: For if a man declares to the world by an adverti&s;ement or verbally, that he owns the fee of a hou&s;e and land and offers them for &s;ale and I buy them of him, and it afterwards appears that he had only a lea&s;e of them, I am not obliged to open an account current with him&mdash;charging him the pur|cha&s;e money and crediting him with the value of the lea&s;e; <HI>but the whole bargain is vacated, becau&s;e the fee, which was the e&s;&s;ence of it, did not exi&s;t.</HI> This is good law, whether accredited by the books or not. The above ca&s;e would be more parallel, if the lea&s;e were to expire the next hour after the execution of the deed; for then the value of the lea&s;e would be ju&s;t paramount to the value of a right of pre-emption to the Indian lands in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</P>
<P>THE ready an&s;wer to this has been, You mu&s;t have known the facts about this bu&s;ine&s;s, when you bought. My reply is, then we mu&s;t have known that tho&s;e, who circulated the&s;e pamphlets and who declared to us that they owned the fee, were impo&s;|tors at the time of our purcha&s;e, which is hardly &s;up|po&s;able. But if any one &s;uppo&s;e it, he may be a&s;&s;ur|ed that we did not <HI>know it 'till afterwards.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="55" REF="033425_0015_0FF7C442B94C03B8">
2d. IF the fee of the lands was pretended to be conveyed; yet if in fact the fee did not pa&s;s&mdash;clear|ly the books on landed tenures mu&s;t be clo&s;ed; their principles cannot apply for rea&s;ons before &s;tated. The purcha&s;ers are not to be driven to all circuities and formalities nece&s;&s;ary for a recovery on an un|founded &s;ale of the fee, becau&s;e the &s;ellers u&s;ed the term <HI>fee.</HI> On a conveyance of lands which do not exi&s;t, or of lands inacce&s;&s;ible, the purcha&s;er need not be outed and di&s;&s;ei&s;ed; before he can recover again&s;t the &s;eller.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>FOURTH PROPOSITION. <HI>All which the deeds of the northern purcha&s;ers can po&s;&s;ibly contain is the Georgia right of pre-emption.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS right is of &s;uch de&s;cription, that a re&s;cind|ing act is completely fatal to it. But before we come to this act, it may not be ami&s;s to con&s;ider the nu|merous circum&s;tances, which render this pre-emptive right of the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible value.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. THE pretence of this right is a &s;tanding act of rebellion again&s;t the law of nature, which gives lands to the fir&s;t occupants: It is contrary to the avowed principles of our &s;ettlement in this country&mdash;a con|&s;tant violence done to the Indians, by depriving them of an inherent right of &s;elling to the highe&s;t bidder&mdash;and a wanton gra&s;ping for territory beyond the exi|gences of this, and probably of any future, century.</P>
<P N="2">2d. A PRETENCE of this pre-emption, though holding its right foot on the Briti&s;h charters, and its left on the treaty of peace is a direct violation of the laws of nature and nations, e&s;pecially while &s;u&s;tained again&s;t the con&s;ent of the natives and the &s;overeign will of the union. The i&s;&s;ue of the que&s;tion, wheth|er the&s;e lands are or are not, within the territory of
<PB N="56" REF="033425_0016_0FF7C4450EB4ADD0">Georgia is yet doubtful; but the exi&s;tence of a di&s;|pute and the mea&s;ures of Congre&s;s on this &s;ubject, &s;hew that the conclu&s;ions in the State of Facts, drawn from the acquie&s;cence of Congre&s;s, are not correct; and that the Georgia right of pre-emption is not re|cogni&s;ed by the &s;upreme power of the union. We are not to believe that Congre&s;s are rai&s;ing this que&s;|tion for the purpo&s;e of &s;ecuring to the United States a right of pre-emption; but for the better purpo&s;e of &s;ub&s;tantially guaranting to the Indians, that indem|nity for wrongs and that protection from future in|croachments, which they &s;o eminently de&s;erve from us as a nation. To calculate otherwi&s;e would be impeaching the ju&s;tice of the union.</P>
<P N="3">3d. THE numbers, characters and &s;ituation of the Indian nations, who po&s;&s;e&s;s and cultivate the&s;e lands, form a phalanx of arguments again&s;t the value of a pre-emptive right, more formidable than the laws of nature or nations&mdash;arguments wholly una&s;&s;ailable by force or fraud, and far removed beyond the power of confutation.</P>
<P N="4">4th. THIS pre-emptive claim, un&s;upported by the laws of nature and nations, di&s;puted by the United States, unheeded by the Indians, &s;tands &s;olely on the declaration of the &s;tate of Georgia&mdash;on the &s;imple a&s;&s;ertion of the only party intere&s;ted to make it&mdash;and &s;tanding thus alone was never of any value and prob|ably will never be of any value to the end of time.</P>
<P>PRE-EMPTIVE rights in their be&s;t e&s;tate are mi&s;er|able; but this &s;tanding on a grant re&s;cinded and burnt&mdash;on a title no better at be&s;t, than the gift of Pope Alexander&mdash;contemplating lands never to be in market, is mi&s;erable in the extreme: but this vain and illu&s;ive right of pre-emption, <HI>becau&s;e like Pindar's razors, good for market,</HI> became an object of purcha&s;e. The granting act gave them a &s;ort of &s;ignificance&mdash; the parchments with the Governor's name, the &s;eal
<PB N="57" REF="033425_0017_0FF7C40C1D5FED90">of the &s;tate and the words <HI>fee &s;imple,</HI> all &s;anctioned by the u&s;ual formalities of &s;overeign legi&s;lation, aided by a <HI>State of Facts,</HI> bore a very impo&s;ing appearance.</P>
<P>PREVIOUS to the granting act &s;everal years had elap&s;ed, in which the&s;e lands had not increa&s;ed in value or demand; but now, by the magic alchymy of &s;peculation, this &s;hadowy, ambiguous right of pre|emption was commuted to a <HI>fee &s;imple,</HI> and though bought at a fair price in January, had, by the Septem|ber following ri&s;en in market more than 400 per cent, and how high the&s;e productive acres would have ri&s;en is beyond calculation, if the re&s;cinding act had not re&s;tored them to their original &s;tandard. By rea&s;on of this act the lands have cea&s;ed to be of value and the eyes of the northern purcha&s;ers have been opened to &s;ee the mi&s;erable foundation of the Georgia fee and pre-emption. This mighty fabric of &s;peculation was built for tumbling and was de&s;ti|ned to cru&s;h in its fall the builders or the owners. Doubtle&s;s the Georgians e&s;timate their right as of &s;ome value; the glare of this &s;peculation has dazzled them&mdash;doubtle&s;s the purcha&s;ers, who have paid the whole of their money, wi&s;h to believe better things about this Georgia right. They will not be per&s;uaded that fee and pre-emption can &s;o &s;uddenly &s;ink out of &s;ight. Will the &s;ame men be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear that even a palace with its magnificent cor|nices and entabletures has tumbled &s;uddenly to ruins, after being informed that its real foundation was nothing more than <HI>painted bonnet-paper</HI> and that till the time of tumbling, it had been &s;u&s;tained by weak temporary props?</P>
<P>FROM the premi&s;es which have been pre&s;ent|ed, it is fair to conclude that the &s;tate of Georgia did pretend to &s;ell the <HI>fee</HI>&mdash;that the &s;tate never own|ed
<PB N="58" REF="033425_0018_0FF7C448677F2138">the <HI>fee</HI>&mdash;that the <HI>fee</HI> never ve&s;ted in the fir&s;t com|panies&mdash;that the northern purcha&s;ers have never ac|quired the <HI>fee</HI> and therefore that the whole con&s;ider|ation of the bargains has failed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="proposition">
<P>FIFTH PROPOSITION. <HI>The fee and a right to buy the fee are widely different, and the Georgia claim to pre|emption is peculiarly worthle&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>A RIGHT to buy a fee is no part of a fee. A right of pre-emption is a meer contingent right, <HI>equally</HI> ap|plicable to real and per&s;onal e&s;tates. It is a kind of thing, about which a covenant of &s;ei&s;in would be ab|&s;urd; a thing to which no ou&s;ter can be applied. It may be of &s;ome value or of no value, according to the object of it&mdash;as in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</P>
<P>IF the king of Great-Britain had a clear right to charter to the &s;tate of Georgia, an exclu&s;ive right to buy the lands in que&s;tion&mdash;and had actually done it &mdash;and the lands were clearly within the bounds of that charter&mdash;and the right of pre-emption was un|conte&s;ted&mdash;and the Indians were actually di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ell them for le&s;s than their value&mdash;and the &s;tate of Georgia had fairly a&s;&s;igned over this right of pre|emption&mdash;and if there were power enough to prevent their re&s;cinding the a&s;&s;ignment&mdash;and if no principle of law or policy could annul the a&s;&s;ignment of pre|emptive rights to individuals; then a conveyance from the a&s;&s;ignees would be of &s;ome value: That is, of ju&s;t as much value as the Indians were willing to &s;ell them, below what they could be &s;old for again: Which is ju&s;t the amount of what the Indians would &s;uffer, by being confined to one &s;et of purcha&s;ers, in&s;tead of having all the world as bidders.</P>
<P>BUT what a confluence of contingencies is here? Without every one of which the right of pre-emp|tion
<PB N="59" REF="033425_0019_0FF7C44A06586F78">is not worth having; and yet not one of them exi&s;ts in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. Great-Britain had no right to charter the right of purcha&s;e&mdash;the bounda|ries of the &s;tate and the right of pre-emption in the premi&s;es are conte&s;ted&mdash;the Indians have no di&s;po|&s;ition to &s;ell at any price&mdash;the &s;tate has never fairly a&s;&s;igned the right&mdash;they have re&s;cinded their fraudu|lent a&s;&s;ignment without a po&s;&s;ibility of control, and both law and policy annul the a&s;&s;ignment.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e propo&s;itions, except the la&s;t, are &s;u&s;tain|ed in the&s;e numbers; and of the la&s;t, it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that if the law of nature and the policy of nations can have &s;ubjected the Indians to the pre|emption of a &s;ingle &s;tate; yet that law and policy mu&s;t have contemplated &s;tates as acting on ju&s;t and liberal principles: But how exce&s;&s;ive is the oppre&s;&s;ion &mdash;when a &s;tate may barter this right to individuals, and when the&s;e may transfer it through a great &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of companies, each of which mu&s;t, in giving an enhanced price for pre-emption, calculate on pur|cha&s;ing the fee for as much <HI>le&s;s</HI> than the &s;tate could have given for it, as the price which they gave was <HI>more</HI> than the &s;tates' price to the purcha&s;ers! No one can fail to &s;ee that every progre&s;&s;ion of &s;ales in &s;uch a bu&s;ine&s;s is an injury to the Indians to the whole amount of the profits in each &s;ale. The event is that the la&s;t purcha&s;er has given &s;o much, that he can afford very little for the Indian right&mdash;the In|dians cannot afford to &s;ell it at &s;uch a reduced price &mdash;a war en&s;ues, and this per&s;ecuted people mu&s;t be driven nearer the &s;outhern ocean or the pole. Such has been too much the policy of the white people; and &s;o far as the northern alienations of pre-emption have involved or induced this wrong, &s;o far they have violated the laws of nature and the policy of nations.</P>
<P>THE author of the State of Facts on this &s;ubject &s;ays, (page 12) <Q>It is exclaimed, what mi&s;chiefs
<PB N="60" REF="033425_0020_0FF7C44BAD1CEF58">would en&s;ue, if individuals were allowed to pur|cha&s;e Indian rights! But it is no good objection to the validity of a title to property, that the pro|prietor may u&s;e it in &s;uch manner, as to become inconvenient to the public.</Q></P>
<P>I AM of tho&s;e who adopt the exclamation and mean to include in it all which is above expre&s;&s;ed &mdash;founding my&s;elf on an inconte&s;tible maxim that a law tending directly to immorality and inju&s;tice is void from the beginning. No legi&s;lature could have had power to enact &s;uch a law.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If a Statute be again&s;t common Right or Rea&s;on, the common law &s;hall control it and adjudge it to be void. 8 Rep. 118. 2 in&s;t. 527. Finch 74.
<P>A Statute, contrary to natural equity or tending to immorality and wrong, is void. Jura naturae &s;unt immutabilia. Hob. 87. 8 Rep. 118.</P></NOTE> It is the province of phi|lo&s;ophers to explore cau&s;es; that of legi&s;lators to calculate con&s;equences. The wrong in this ca&s;e is preci&s;ely coeval with the law; for it is manife&s;t that even the fir&s;t grantees could not give the native pro|prietors as much for their land as the &s;tate it&s;elf. Hence if law and policy had any rea&s;on for &s;ubjecting the natives to the pre-emption of a &s;tate, as for argu|ment's &s;ake I have admitted, yet on the in&s;tant of al|ienating this to individuals, law and policy give way to avarice and oppre&s;&s;ion and the very principles on which the &s;tate claimed the right are abandoned. <HI>Hence the companies deeds are void, as given in violation of fir&s;t principles.</HI></P>
<P>IN pur&s;uit of wealth men are apt to di&s;regard principles and means; but when every view of this &s;ubject, while it di&s;clo&s;es fraud and collu&s;ion, exhib|its the nothingne&s;s of the&s;e Georgia claims, &s;urely the di&s;cerning purcha&s;er will cea&s;e to look forward for gain: his &s;ole object will be re&s;titution for the money paid and indemnity for the wrong &s;uffered.</P>

<HEAD>SIXTH PROPOSITION. <HI>Suppo&s;e the &s;tate of Georgia had owned the fee of the lands; yet the granting act and the companies deeds are void on principles of common law.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BY rea&s;on of the variety of intere&s;ts and opinions on this &s;ubject many will differ from me in &s;ome of my premi&s;es and conclu&s;ions re&s;pecting the fee and pre-emption of the&s;e lands, I am therefore di&s;po&s;ed to try the &s;trength of this que&s;tion without the aid of them. Be it that the laws of nature and nations were made for white people, and that the Indian na|tions inhabiting and claiming the&s;e lands are to have no protection from the United States. Yet the northern purcha&s;ers have acquired nothing by their deeds. All the money paid, the notes given and the expence and labor created have been without any con&s;ideration; for the deeds of Governor Matthews to the companies and the granting act authorizing them are ab&s;olutely void on a fair principle of com|mon law. Which is, that <Q>no man or body of men, not being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;hall &s;ell lands to another or others not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>THIS law has in &s;everal of the &s;tates been erected in|to a &s;tatute, for the purpo&s;e of making it known, and of defining the penalty&mdash;it is founded on &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;on and calculated to prevent di&s;putes, quarrels and blood&s;hed. The original deeds of the compa|nies pre&s;ent to the world a higher violation of this common law, than any which has been recorded. The deeds purport to be a conveyance of the fee &s;im|ple of certain tracts of land, including i&s;lands, &amp;c. de&s;cribing the very lands, owned, occupied and en|joyed immemorially by the Indian nations, and lands, whereon the Indians were claiming at the very time when the&s;e deeds were &s;igned, and this within the knowledge of the grantors. The author of the State of Facts, who&s;e perception of difficulties appears very
<PB N="62" REF="033425_0022_0FF7C44E1232EB98">accurate, endeavours to obviate this by erecting two &s;overeign rights on the &s;ame land. 1&s;t. A fee &s;im|ple in the &s;tate of Georgia or as he terms it "a right in the &s;oil &s;imple and ab&s;olute in its nature." 2d. The Indians right of fi&s;hing and hunting, which he &s;ays, "is a right in the nation, as long as it continues to exi&s;t as a nation. It is an ab&s;olute right, of which it cannot be deprived, without its own con&s;ent in a fair purcha&s;e, by a voluntary abandonment, or by conque&s;t."</P>
<P>This Indian right is unque&s;tionably a &s;ole right of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to the exclu&s;ion of all others, and has been &s;o uniformly under&s;tood, ever &s;ince the &s;ettlement of this country. The author calls this Indian right <HI>an u&s;ufruct</HI> and &s;ays that "by long u&s;age and general principles of law it is no le&s;s alienable than any other contingent or rever&s;ionary intere&s;t in lands what&s;o|ever." <HI>This is good &s;liding again:</HI> but where is a &s;in|gle in&s;tance, in this long u&s;age, of a &s;tate &s;elling the Indian lands in fee &s;imple? Where is one general principle of law to ju&s;tify &s;uch an u&s;age? How come the words <HI>contingent</HI> and <HI>rever&s;ionary</HI> to be applied to lands &s;old in fee &s;imple? The Indians know nothing about the&s;e nice di&s;tinctions, of right ab&s;olute in one and right perpetual in another, that is, a fee &s;imple in Georgia, which comprehends and ab&s;orbs all le&s;&s;er e&s;tates, and at the &s;ame time an u&s;ufruct in them, which completely ab&s;orbs and annihilates this fee.</P>
<P>THESE paradoxical niceties are exclu&s;ively ve&s;ted in the Georgia companies, and the u&s;ufruct of them belongs to the author of the State of Facts.</P>
<P>BY the conce&s;&s;ion of this author the Indians own this perpetual right of u&s;ufruct &s;o ab&s;olutely that they cannot be deprived of it, without their own con|&s;ent in a fair purcha&s;e, by a voluntary abandonment or by conque&s;t: Yet according to him the &s;tate of Georgia owns the fee-&s;imple.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="033425_0023_0FF7C45032D77CD8">
WE have now di&s;covered what this fee-&s;imple is. In&s;tead of being like what the books call fee-&s;imple, the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> po&s;&s;ible e&s;tate in lands&mdash;comprehending all le&s;&s;er e&s;tates, it is the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> po&s;&s;ible e&s;tate and com|prehends nothing. In&s;tead of being, as other fee-&s;imples are, coeval with the creation of this earth, and always ve&s;ting in &s;ome one, it dates its exi&s;tence from the date of the Georgia deeds, and never ve&s;ted in any one, till the delivery of them.</P>
<P>THE companies deeds are made in defiance of the common law, at the very point, where the law mar|&s;hals all its force: For the natural tendency of them is to produce, in a mo&s;t aggravated degree, the very evils, the prevention of which gave exi&s;tence to that law.</P>
<P>THE manner in which di&s;putes, quarrels and blood|&s;hed would naturally en&s;ue from the&s;e deeds has been detailed in the la&s;t chapter.</P>
<P>HAD the Indians been conquered, and were in a &s;tate of rebellion again&s;t the &s;tate of Georgia.&mdash;Had the &s;tate ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the&s;e lands, far otherwi&s;e might be the merits of this que&s;tion&mdash;but the Indians are on the lands, claiming, cultivating and acknowl|edging no &s;uperior. Not only this: But by the very conce&s;&s;ion of the companies they are <HI>rightfully</HI> po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing and enjoying every privilege of a fee except the name; and the &s;elling of the name is of no u&s;e; except the eventual intention of that &s;ale be, to give the purcha&s;ers a colour of right to defraud, di&s;pute, quarrel with or murder the injured po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubject analized&mdash;&s;tript of its covering, pre|&s;ents no other explanation: For the fir&s;t companies cannot afford to give the Indians &s;o much for their right, as the &s;tate could have given: Here is the foundation of fraud laid:&mdash;the fir&s;t grantees can afford &s;till le&s;s: The &s;ales will be continued as long as any gain can be made: The fraud becomes magnified.
<PB N="64" REF="033425_0024_0FF7C41678890D90">Now if the Indians cannot be cheated, di&s;putes and quarrels will be the con&s;equence and <HI>murder</HI> will (as it ever has done, with tho&s;e injured tribes) bring up the rear. Tis enough to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, that the &s;tate not being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, has &s;old to compa|nies not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and this in direct violation of an acknowledged principle of common law. The &s;tatutes, which in this ca&s;e are but a tran&s;cript of the common law declare all conveyances of this de&s;crip|tion <HI>null and void,</HI> which terms may mo&s;t warranta|bly be applied to the granting act and the compa|nies deeds.</P>
<P>SHALL it be &s;aid that common law principles are not to regulate and control legi&s;lative acts of &s;ove|reign &s;tates? I am ready to agree to the po&s;ition, provided it may be con&s;idered as an agreed point be|tween us&mdash;and it &s;eems hardly competent that com|mon law principles &s;hould be applied to legi&s;lative acts, where there is no common law power to en|force the application: But this &s;alvo will not help the companies; for they, knowing them&s;elves not to be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and purcha&s;ing of others who had no claim to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, have, by their own violation of the &s;ame common law, made null and void their own title.&mdash;They can claim no exemption from com|mon law, unle&s;s they &s;hould claim that the &s;ove|reignty of the &s;tate, (backed by long u&s;age, accor|ding to the State of Facts,) can &s;anctify a wrong of the mo&s;t atrocious magnitude. Be it however, for their &s;akes, that the &s;tate can do this; yet their deeds to the northern purcha&s;ers are null and void, for here both parties are &s;ubject to this law.</P>
<P>HE who &s;eeks equity mu&s;t have done equity. He who &s;eeks law mu&s;t have done legally: But in this ca&s;e they, who are claiming all the aid of the com|mon law for the recovery of their notes, have, by their own &s;hewing, been guilty of &s;uch a gro&s;s vio|lation
<PB N="65" REF="033425_0025_0FF7C4525AAA4B40">of this common law, that the very men whom they are pur&s;uing, have, <HI>by rea&s;on of this very violation,</HI> lo&s;t all title to the lands for which the notes were given.</P>
<P>IF ever a trial about the title to this naked vi&s;ion|ary fee could be brought up, the objection here rai&s;|ed, again&s;t the validity of the granting act and the companies deeds, would be conclu&s;ive again&s;t the northern purcha&s;ers; unle&s;s the court trying the que&s;tion, &s;hould deviate from tho&s;e deci&s;ions, which, I am told, have invariably prevailed on this &s;ubject.</P>

<P>IT is well known that the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of this coun|try owe no thanks to the principles accredited by this eminent writer. Whatever might have been their mo|tives for emigration; yet nature, rea&s;on and religion

<P>IN Trumbull's Hi&s;tory of Connecticut may be found claims of title, liveries of &s;eizin, and modes of ejectment, unknown to the civil or canon law.</P>
<P>IT is &s;aid that our fore-fathers were per&s;ecuted for their religion and forced from their native land into this, then howling wilderne&s;s. If hi&s;tory di&s;covers that their tribulation had worked patience; if their conduct evinced their abhorrence of per&s;ecution&mdash; and if the wilderne&s;s cea&s;ed to howl at their ap|proach, we ought to ble&s;s the event,&mdash;It is &s;aid that the old world was over&s;tocked, and that the natives of this had more land than they wanted. If hi&s;tory informs that our ance&s;tors took their brethren of this new world by the hand and offered to give them, in exchange for the luxuries of this we&s;tern hemi&s;phere, the newly imported virtues and &s;cience of the ea&s;t, we ought to ble&s;s the event. If He, who&s;e is the earth, had decreed that our fore-fathers &s;hould have and enjoy this portion of it&mdash;and in token of this decree had put them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, we ought to cleave to this high evidence of title, and not to claim be|yond it. <Q>Plea&s;ed with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, we &s;eem a|fraid to look back to the means, by which it was acquired, as if fearful of &s;ome defect in our title; or at be&s;t we re&s;t &s;atisfied with the deci&s;ion of the laws in our favor, without examining the rea&s;on or authority upon which tho&s;e laws have been built.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Black.

<P>"MIGHT OVERCOMES RIGHT" &s;tands as the ba&s;is of this new &s;y&s;tem of landed te|nures, as will appear by the following hi&s;torical com|ments on the di&s;covery of America. <Q>The war|like animals on which the Spani&s;h officers were mounted; the artificial thunders which i&s;&s;ued from their hands; the wooden ca&s;tles, which had waft|ed them over the ocean, &s;truck a panic into the natives, from which they did not recover, until it was too late. Wherever the Spaniards marched, they &s;pared no age or &s;ex, nothing &s;acred or pro|fane. The Spaniards went out with their dogs to hunt after men. The unhappy &s;avages almo&s;t na|ked and di&s;armed, were pur&s;ued like deer into the thick of the fore&s;ts, devoured by ma&s;tiffs, killed with gun &s;hot, or &s;urpri&s;ed and burnt in their hab|itations.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Guthrie's Di&s;covery of America.</NOTE></Q> <HI>The&s;e were the triumphant liveries of &s;eizin in the &s;outhern parts of America!!</HI></P>
<P>THE poverty of the inhabitants of Bahama taught Columbus, that this was not the country, which he
<PB N="68" REF="033425_0028_0FF7C41993F690B0">was &s;eeking.&mdash;<Q>But &s;teering further &s;outhward he found a country, abounding in all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, inhabited by a humane and ho&s;pitable peo|ple; and what was of &s;till greater con&s;equence, promi&s;ing con&s;iderable quantities of <HI>gold.</HI> This, therefore, he propo&s;ed to make the centre of his di&s;coveries.</Q></P>
<P>IT was not benevolence nor &s;cience which moved Columbus to di&s;cover countries already di&s;covered; to people regions already populated, or to moralize nations, more virtuous than his own: But <HI>auri &s;acra fames,</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The cur&s;ed thir&s;t of gold.</NOTE> more powerful than Euroclydon, drove this impetuous hero upon the&s;e defencele&s;s natives. Ev|ery new di&s;covery of <HI>gold</HI> formed a new epoch in this hi&s;tory and added fre&s;h laurels to Guthrie's immortal Columbus.</P>
<P>THIS author exclaims, <Q>It is impo&s;&s;ible to deter|mine whether the genius of this great man in fir&s;t conceiving the idea of the&s;e di&s;coveries, or his &s;a|gacity in the execution of the plan he had con|ceived, mo&s;t de&s;erve our admiration.</Q> My admi|ration is more &s;u&s;pended between the ba&s;e motives of the hero, and the unfounded panegyric of his biog|rapher.

Becau&s;e this tran&s;action is wholly novel, yet is lan|guage to lo&s;e its u&s;ual &s;ignificance? Is the term, DIS|COVERY, &s;o convertible that it can be applied with in|crea&s;ing glory to new &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of adventurers?</P>
<P>AT the very time when this weight of glory devol|ved on Columbus, the immen&s;e regions of this coun|try were populated by millions far exceeding the numbers now living on it. Myriads of rational, in|telligent beings were &s;cattered throughout every part,
<PB N="69" REF="033425_0029_0FF7C430E3FA8A70">enjoying in innocence and &s;implicity the golden age of &s;ociety. According to the above author, <Q>The empire of Mexico, at this time, rich, powerful, in|habited by millions of Indians, had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for a|ges; its inhabitants were not rude and barbarous; but every thing announced a poli&s;hed and intelli|gent people.&mdash;Their government, founded on the &s;ure ba&s;is of laws, combined with religion, &s;eemed to bid defiance to time it&s;elf. Mexico, the capital of the empire, &s;ituated in the middle of a &s;pacious lake, was the noble&s;t monument of American in|du&s;try. It communicated to the continent by im|men&s;e cau&s;eways, carried through the lake. The city was admired for its buildings all of &s;tone, its &s;quares and market places, the &s;hops, which glit|tered with gold and &s;ilver, and the &s;umptuous pal|aces of Montezuma, &s;ome erected on columns of ja&s;per, and containing whatever was mo&s;t rare, curious or u&s;eful.</Q> <HI>This was the de&s;ert uninhabi|ted wild, de&s;tined for the di&s;covery of that immortal brute Fernando Cortez, who&s;e evidence of title was proclaimed by the groans of Guatimozin, while &s;tretched on burning coals, to compel a di&s;covery, where his trea&s;ures were con|cealed.</HI></P>
<P>ANOTHER inho&s;pitable wilderne&s;s tempted the patrioti&s;m of Pizarro. The Peruvian empire, foun|ded by Mango Capac, had been united, civilized, &s;oftened by the in&s;titution of a benevolent religion. "In &s;hort," &s;ays the above author, <Q>there was no part of America, where agriculture and the arts were &s;o a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly cultivated, and where the peo|ple were of &s;o mild and ingenuous manners. He adds, Pizarro had no conception of dealing gently with tho&s;e, whom he called barbarians: But who, though le&s;s acquainted with the cruel art of de&s;|troying their fellow-creatures, were more civili|zed than him&s;elf.</Q></P>

Among the worthies, who&s;e names have acquired a paper immortality on this &s;ub|ject, the family of the Cabots &s;tands mo&s;t con&s;picu|ous. In 1494, John Cabot, a Venetian, (born in England) had the <HI>honor</HI> of di&s;covering Newfoundland and the i&s;land of St. John's; in con&s;equence of which Henry VII. confered on him another <HI>honor</HI> ju&s;t equal to it&mdash;the order of Knighthood: Whereupon the &s;aid John died, and his &s;on Seba&s;tian, u&s;ing his fa|ther's journals, had the <HI>honor</HI> of falling in with the continent in the 56th degree of north latitude&mdash;and thence the <HI>long extended honor</HI> of exploring the coa&s;t as far as the Floridas. <Q>From the&s;e di&s;coveries origin|ated the claims of England to the&s;e parts of the northern continent.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Trumbull's Hi&s;t. of Connect.

<P>THE king's patents opened our title; per&s;ecution gave occa&s;ion to a&s;&s;ert it. I &s;hall only quote one livery of &s;eizin as a &s;ample of the re&s;t. In the year 1637, when quarrels between the ancient inhabitants and the patentees had prepared for the work of death, the conflict at Mi&s;tic decided the fortune of

Ma&s;on, find|ing that the Indians fought de&s;perately for their wives, their children, their homes and their all, cried out to his men, <HI>We mu&s;t burn them.</HI> He immediately entering a wigwam, took fire and put it into the mats, with which the wigwams were covered.

The enemy were now &s;eized with a&s;|toni&s;hment and forced by the flames from their lurking places into open &s;ight and became a fair mark for the Engli&s;h &s;oldiers. Some climbed the pali&s;adoes and were in&s;tantly brought down by the fire of the Engli&s;h mu&s;kets. Others, de&s;perately &s;allying forth from their burning cells, were &s;hot or cut in pieces with the &s;word. Such terror fell upon them, that they would run back from the Engli&s;h into the very flames. Great numbers peri&s;hed in the conflagration.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE greatne&s;s and violence of the fire, the reflec|tion of the light, the fla&s;hing and roaring of the arms, the &s;hrieks and yellings of the men, women and children in the fort, and the &s;houtings of the Indians without, ju&s;t at the dawn of the morning, exhibited a grand and awful &s;cene. In little more than an hour this whole work of de&s;truction was fini&s;hed. Seventy wigwams were burnt and 5 or 600 Indians peri&s;hed, either by the &s;word or in the flames.

<P>On this fiction of law was founded the patent to the earl of War|wick, of lands thoroughly populated and thus <HI>derelict principles</HI> were &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of <HI>derelict</HI> lands, and thus for two centuries the Indians have been &s;uffering on account of the profound ignorance of this univer&s;al occupant and all his mini&s;ters about this country, combined with an ignorance of the fair operation of their own FIC|TIONS.</P></NOTE>; but becau&s;e

<P>ON the idea of di&s;covery, power or conque&s;t, the charter of New-England, granted in 1620, could not contain much land, as but little was, at that time, conquered or di&s;covered by the king's &s;ubjects. The &s;ame is true of that of Connecticut in 1631. Both are very indefinite as to the kind of right intended to be conveyed; but both manife&s;tly expre&s;s the premi&s;es as extending from &s;ea to &s;ea; and by virtue of the&s;e and &s;imilar charters the different &s;tates have claimed a right of preference to purcha&s;e, incroach or con|quer within the limits of them &s;everally a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;peculators in this bu&s;ine&s;s were the earl of Warwick and others to the number of 40, com|monly called "The great Plymouth Company." The&s;e &s;old Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts to Sir Henry Ro&s;well and others&mdash;Connecticut to Vi&s;count Say and Seal and Co.&mdash;and thus the titles went from hand to hand, as the Georgia &s;peculation has done, <HI>neither party in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> and the natural con&s;equence was di&s;putes, quarrels and blood&s;hed.</P>
<P>As the principles of natural and common law are now out of the que&s;tion, all was well enough; there was &s;ub&s;tantial land at bottom; power enough to a&s;&s;ert it; and an unlimited right to exerci&s;e this power was implied in the original charter; in this it differed much from the pre&s;ent &s;peculation.

<P>THE &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity led up a &s;imilar arrangement between the colonies, and though it was an evil and a wrong to the natives; yet of two evils it was the lea&s;t, as a competition among the colonies, about pur|cha&s;es, might lead to quarrels and wars with the na|tives. At the union of the colonies, this re&s;ervation was not thrown into common &s;tock. By the treaty of peace a line between the Briti&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and the United States was de&s;ignated, which extending to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, left within our lines about 220 millions acres of territory, mo&s;tly owned and enjoy|ed immemorially by the natives. In the confedera|tion of the United States, the re&s;ervation of each was not relinqui&s;hed. But the re&s;ervation thus continu|ed was in no re&s;pect fortified.</P>
<P>HOWEVER inventive &s;peculation had in the mean time &s;ugge&s;ted, that &s;elling this re&s;ervation to com|panies would obviate the evils contemplated by &s;uf|fering individuals to purcha&s;e. The idea of filling the public coffers by &s;elling this indefineable &s;ome|thing induced the &s;ale of the Chene&s;&s;ee country, and the lands &s;outh of Lake Erie. By the deeds the
<PB N="77" REF="033425_0037_0FF7C429E1CEE070">purcha&s;ers were not inve&s;ted with the FEE SIMPLE of the lands, nor with any attribute of real e&s;tate; but with a right of excluding others from purcha&s;ing them, and of being purcha&s;ers in their own per&s;ons, whenever the policy of the United States and the di&s;|po&s;ition of the natives to &s;ell, &s;hould coincide to bring them into market.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e &s;ales the &s;tates did not authorize the pur|cha&s;ers to claim any <HI>right</HI> again&s;t the natives, on the ground of <HI>nece&s;&s;ity, religion, per&s;ecution, treaty, purcha&s;e or conque&s;t.</HI> All this new &s;y&s;tem of landed tenures had wrought its perfect work.

<P>IN the mean time the policy of the United States, tho' elevated above the idea of taking advantages of the Indians; yet not having power to compel ce&s;|&s;ions of this territory, had, by making treaties on the one hand, and on the other enacting laws, con|troling the exerci&s;e of the&s;e re&s;ervations, &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ed its authority over pre-emptive rights.</P>

WHAT confidence could be placed in the wi&s;dom, policy or good faith of a nation, which &s;hould &s;ign treaties with one hand and with the other betray the tribes, with whom they were made? Or what confi|dence could be placed in a nation, which trampling on the laws of nature, and the &s;acred doctrine of e|qual rights, &s;hould give &s;anction to charters, ba&s;ele&s;s as tho&s;e of the &s;tates, by aiding to extend their effects beyond the bounds, <HI>which even avarice and cruelty had formerly &s;et to them?</HI> But this confidence remains; this policy has never been relaxed, except when the relaxation was perfectly in uni&s;on with the feelings and intere&s;ts of the tribes concerned.</P>
<P>As the purcha&s;ers of the northern pre-emptions, have in fair market, with full con&s;ent of all parties, bought the fee and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lands, and as no que&s;tion has ever been had on the merits of the &s;ub|ject, it is impo&s;&s;ible to draw any legal inference from our quit-claims to the Georgia conveyances.</P>
<P>As the northern &s;tates never claimed nor alienated the fee &s;imple&mdash;as they alienated no right to pur|cha&s;e&mdash;as the congre&s;&s;ional power to hold a treaty alone gave the right to purcha&s;e, and as actual pur|cha&s;e northern quit-claims on this &s;ubject amounted to no more than a declaration on the part of the &s;tates that they would never attempt to exerci&s;e a claim, which from my premi&s;es, appears to have had no founda|tion even in the <HI>ba&s;e</HI> principles of their charters, and which exerci&s;e had before been controled by the U|nited States.</P>
<P>THESE &s;tates did not pretend to any fraud and collu&s;ion practi&s;ed on them, and therefore did not re&s;cind their quit-claims: had they done this, the con&s;equence might have furni&s;hed a precedent in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</P>

As the event has proved, their renunciations of claim have not been prejudicial to the intere&s;t nor oppo&s;ed to the policy of the union; therefore the evils, fairly calculable, as the i&s;&s;ue of ab&s;olute claims on indian land have not occurred. But in the ca&s;e of the Georgia &s;ales, no &s;uch event can have pre|&s;ented.</P>
<P>THEREFORE&mdash;Whether we canva&s;s the di&s;covery of this country&mdash;the charters of the colonies, lead|ing up their new &s;y&s;tem of landed tenures&mdash;the practice of the northern &s;tates upon this &s;y&s;tem&mdash;or the policy of the union; every view of the &s;ubject pre&s;ents a more hideous conception of the daring &s;windling practi&s;ed on the world by the Georgia granting act, and the companies deeds <HI>purporting to be conveyances of the fee-&s;imple of the Indian lands.</HI></P>
<P>THIS view of our &s;ubject, while it excludes forev|er the idea of a fee-&s;imple, ve&s;ting in the &s;tate of Georgia, pre&s;ents abundant rea&s;ons why the northern people were deluded by this &s;peculation&mdash;and while it di&s;clo&s;es a new &s;y&s;tem of landed tenures&mdash;excludes all the book principles on landed tenures&mdash;and all deci&s;ions upon tho&s;e principles from any application to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</P>

<P>AND WHEREAS the will or con&s;titution of the good people of this &s;tate is the only exi&s;ting legal authority deriv|ed from the e&s;&s;ential &s;ource of &s;overeignty, and is the only foundation of the legi&s;lative power or government thereof, and &s;o far as that will or con&s;titution expre&s;sly warrants, the legi&s;lature may go, but no further; and all con&s;tructive powers not nece&s;&s;arily deduced from that expre&s;&s;ed will, are violations of that e&s;&s;ential &s;ource of &s;overeignty, and the rights of the citizens, and are therefore of no binding force or effect on the &s;tate, or the good people thereof, but null and void.</P>

<P>THIS re&s;cinding act, whether regarded in a legal, equitable or moral point of view does the highe&s;t credit to the legi&s;lature which pa&s;&s;ed it. If it depriv|ed the northern purcha&s;ers of momentary hopes of wealth without labor, it probably &s;aved thou&s;ands from impo&s;ition. If it nipt in the bud a number of a&s;piring &s;windlers, it exhibited to the world an act of &s;overeign ju&s;tice, which thoroughly canva&s;&s;ed, will be found to &s;tand on an immoveable ba&s;is.</P>

<HEAD>SECOND PROPOSITION. <HI>This re&s;cinding act is com|pletely fatal to all claims on the part of the companies and the northern purcha&s;ers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>To try the &s;trength and equity of this act, let us fir&s;t con&s;ider what was in fact conveyed by the granting act and the companies deeds.</P>
<P>NOTHING more can ve&s;t or pa&s;s by any convey|ance, than what the grantor owned or had a right to convey; therefore the <HI>fee-&s;imple,</HI> though expre&s;&s;ed in the deeds, did not pa&s;s; becau&s;e the &s;tate did not
<PB N="93" REF="033425_0053_0FF74CCD26AB3B20">own it. The right of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, u&s;e or dominion could not pa&s;s; becau&s;e the &s;tate had not even a claim to it. An a&s;&s;ignment of any right under the Briti&s;h charters could not pa&s;s; for the lands de&s;|cribed had never been altered nor affected &s;ince the creation of the world. No pretence under the old or new &s;y&s;tem of landed tenures, could reach the&s;e lands. It could not convey a right to buy the land; for this could only be given by the United States. It could not be a right to conquer the Indians; for this either in a &s;tate or an individual would have been trea&s;on again&s;t the union.</P>
<P>THE whole extract and e&s;&s;ence of the granting act and the companies deeds was a &s;imple, unre&s;pon&s;ible declaration of the repre&s;entatives of the &s;overeign people of Georgia, that the people after the date thereof would have no claim upon certain lands with|in their a&s;&s;umed limits.</P>
<P>THIS declaration, which ought long before to have been made to the United States was made to the companies for the price of half a million dollars, and in&s;tead of being couched in the narrow compa&s;s of a due-bill, was promulgated to the world with great legi&s;lative formality as a bona fide conveyance of the fee-&s;imple of lands within their territory.</P>
<P>THE progre&s;s of this bu&s;ine&s;s from its ri&s;ing to its zenith and thence its falling to its original nothing|ne&s;s have been &s;ufficiently traced. But the people of Georgia, indignant at the granting act, have re|&s;cinded this declaration, and &s;uch are the real con|tents of the granting act that this re&s;cinding is fatal to the companies.</P>
<P>CONSIDERING the re&s;cinding act in this point of view, what is the condition of the northern purcha|&s;ers? They claim a right to purcha&s;e the lands, merely becau&s;e the repre&s;entatives of the &s;tate of Georgia declared that after the 7th of Jan. 1795,
<PB N="94" REF="033425_0054_0FF74CD433C68440">the &s;tate would not claim &s;uch a right; but after|wards in Feb. 1796, the people declared that they would claim &s;uch a right, and further declared that the companies, to whom this fir&s;t declaration was made, might take their money again: but for you, who had been defrauded by the&s;e companies, they made no provi&s;ion, and you have no means to com|pel the &s;tate to withdraw their claim.</P>
<P>Now &s;uppo&s;e the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible ca&s;e for the pur|cha&s;ers, viz. that the &s;tate of Georgia owned the fee: yet the&s;e men, who are pur&s;uing you for money, have it completely in their power to receive back the money from the trea&s;ury&mdash;to give up their deeds, and to ratify and confirm the act beyond all contro|ver&s;y: for the contract was only between the &s;tate and the companies&mdash;you are no parties to it. This can be done now, or at any time hereafter. The re|&s;cinding act has left your claim wholly in the power of your tormentors, and has given them the tempta|tion of half a million dollars to exerci&s;e this power, and their pa&s;t conduct has left you no room to doubt their di&s;po&s;ition to do it.</P>
<P>SHEWING you this in the ca&s;e of a fee, you will apprehend on what a &s;lender thread your title is &s;u&s;|pended, provided the granting act &s;hould happen to include any e&s;tate le&s;s than a fee.</P>
<P>'TIS true you are told by the books, that <HI>a fee al|ways ve&s;ts in &s;ome one,</HI> and from thence may infer, that in the ca&s;e propo&s;ed the fee would have been ve&s;ted in you, &s;o that no agreement between the &s;tate and the companies could be conclu&s;ive: but unfortu|nately the &s;ame law, which gives you this momenta|ry comfort, tells you <HI>that no fee can ve&s;t, where nei|ther party is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion;</HI> provided, <HI>that any is in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion claiming and holding all others out,</HI> which was true in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. And unfortunately the la&s;t clau&s;e of this law applies to every kind of right
<PB N="95" REF="033425_0055_0FF74A605FE93468">or claim in real e&s;tate, and when you leave real e&s;tate the law leaves you; &s;o that however you might con|&s;ider your claim, it would be completely voidable by the act of the parties who made the contract.</P>
<P>THUS, &s;eparate from the &s;trength and operation of the re&s;cinding act in it&s;elf, and from all your feel|ings and rea&s;onings about it, your claim is left whol|ly at the mercy of the companies, and this becau&s;e you have not the actual fee &s;imple, which they pre|tended to &s;ell you.</P>
<P>THIS con&s;ideration, added to the <HI>worthle&s;&s;ne&s;s</HI> of your claim, pre&s;ents, in a &s;trong point of view, the vanity of all reliance on your purcha&s;es.</P>
<P>BEYOND this, by de&s;troying the records of the ori|ginal deeds, and clo&s;ing the records again&s;t after con|veyances, the re&s;cinding act has put it in the power of any per&s;on, intermediately claiming the lands, to break a link in the chain of title, on which you may rely; this he may do by burning his deed or by con|veying to another and dating his deed anterior to yours. As you have no record, nor act of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to evidence your title, and as the proof of &s;uch fraud would doubtle&s;s be out of your power, you &s;ee how ea&s;ily your pro&s;pects might be cut off; and this merely by the <HI>exi&s;tence</HI> of the re&s;cinding act, without any reference to its merits.</P>
<P>BUT the actual &s;trength and operation of this act is further di&s;covered, <HI>in its having actually de&s;troyed the marketable quality of the lands.</HI> This &s;hews that the body of mankind, whatever they may think of its equity, really con&s;iders it fatal to your claim; for if they judged the re&s;cinding act to be of no con&s;equence, your lands would be of as much value as ever.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;trength of this act is further di&s;covered in its having with&s;tood all the elements combined to defeat it, triumphant over all the pa&s;&s;ions, which a|gitate men di&s;appointed in pro&s;pect of wealth, and
<PB N="96" REF="033425_0056_0FF74A68F2BEF780">equally above the fine &s;pun &s;ophi&s;ms of dealers in <HI>remnants</HI> of law. As the cau&s;es of its exi&s;tence and object of it formed a combination wholly new, &s;o the act is it&s;elf without a precedent, and &s;tanding thus alone, is firmly &s;upported by the voice of the people, by the inherent &s;overeignty of the &s;tate, and by a train of argument, well calculated to enforce its e|quity and validity upon every unprejudiced mind.</P>
<P>THE very effects of the re&s;cinding act, prove that the contents of the granting were weak; they al&s;o prove that the re&s;cinding act po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;tamina of ex|i&s;tence &s;tronger and more durable than its enemies have been willing to allow it. This act contains in it&s;elf forcible rea&s;ons why it was made; it does not de&s;cend to all the rea&s;ons which might have been of|fered &mdash;nor to any formal confutation of the argu|ments again&s;t it; but as the&s;e arguments have been a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly and in &s;ome in&s;tances &s;ucce&s;sfully u&s;ed at the northward, it may be proper to try the &s;trength of them.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t is, <HI>This re&s;cinding act is wholly unprece|dented and un&s;upported by authorities, therefore good for nothing.</HI></P>
<P>I ACCEDE to the premi&s;es; but deny the conclu|&s;ion.&mdash;It is true that the Briti&s;h king did not re&s;cind his patent to the earl of Warwick. Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts did not re&s;cind their grant of the Gene&s;&s;ee country, nor Connecticut theirs of the Re&s;erve. But &s;uppo&s;e that either or all the&s;e &s;overeign powers had re&s;cin|ded their grants, before the lands were obtained by the grantees, what remedy would the grantees have had? As there is no precedent of the ca&s;e, there can be no precedent of a remedy, and tho&s;e who u&s;e this argument, have never proceeded &s;o far as to &s;ugge&s;t even a plau&s;ible remedy in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. But it
<PB N="97" REF="033425_0057_0FF74A70CCD362E0">&s;o happens, there is no precedent of the fraud, col|lu&s;ion, atrocious &s;peculation and corruption, practi&s;ed on a &s;overeign legi&s;lature, to render &s;uch an act ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and where a new ca&s;e occurs, its merits mu&s;t be tried by the rules of rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>THE novelty of the ca&s;e was created by the fraud of the companies, and it &s;hould not be in their power to draw arguments, from this very novelty, again&s;t the re&s;cinding act.&mdash;The be&s;t, which can be &s;aid of this argument is, that the very terms of the premi&s;es wholly foreclo&s;e any conclu&s;ion in favor of or again&s;t the re&s;cinding act.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd argument is, <HI>that however the re&s;cind|ing act might have operated, previous to any &s;ales made by the companies: yet that it can have no effect on the northern purcha&s;ers; becau&s;e they bought in open mar|ket at a fair price, ignorant of the collu&s;ion.</HI> I have al|ready &s;ugge&s;ted the effects which it has had, and the impracticability of remedy; but in direct an&s;wer to the argument, be it remarked, that if any right ex|i&s;ted, it belonged to the &s;overeign people of Geor|gia&mdash; that the collu&s;ion of repre&s;entatives is not the collu&s;ion of the people, and that when tho&s;e act be|yond their delegated powers, their acts are voidable by the people. But when they, under the influence of bribes, agree to cheat their con&s;tituents and the&s;e bribes are given by the grantees, the contract be|comes void on common law principles.</P>
<P><Q>As the king's grants proceed chiefly from his own bounty, and his letters patent are records of a high nature, they ought to contain the ut|mo&s;t truth and certainty, and have in all times been con&s;trued mo&s;t favourably for the king contrary to the grants of common per&s;ons; and accordingly in a great variety of ca&s;es we find
<PB N="98" REF="033425_0058_0FF74A73E27E9CB8">incertainty, mi&s;recitals, fal&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, and all &s;uch matters as &s;hew that the king was deceived in his grant, held &s;uch rea&s;ons as have been &s;uf|ficient to vitiate the grants.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plow. 333. Co. 44.6 Co. 55.7 Co. 12.8 Co. 56.2 Co 24.8 Co. 145. Hob. 224. Pollexf. 418.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>EQUITY will relieve a man again&s;t a contract, en|tered into, when he was in a &s;tate of ebriety, pro|vided he were drawn into &s;uch debauch by the ma|nagement and contrivance of him, who gained the contract.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Powel on contracts, page 29.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t quotations regarding the &s;overeign people, as &s;tanding in the place of the king, and their repre&s;entatives as the king's mini&s;ters&mdash;the ca&s;es will apply, and the granting act would be void, on common law principles. On the la&s;t quotation, let the fraud be compared to the debauch, and equity will declare the granting act void. An exception taken under this argument is, that the property is now in bona fide purcha&s;ers, who are not partakers in the fraud:&mdash;but this exception is never admitted where a grant, deed, or contract is null and void in it&s;elf.</P>
<P>THIS dark work of legi&s;lation partook too much of the Ethiopian huc, and the conduct of the compa|nies too much of the Leopards &s;pots, ever to bring a white and un&s;potted title, to the northern purcha&s;ers.</P>
<P>IN this ca&s;e the &s;tate has, by a &s;overeign act, done no more, than what courts of law or equity would do in <HI>&s;imilar</HI> contracts between individuals.</P>
<P>THE third argument is, <HI>If the granting act was null and void in it&s;elf, there was no need of a re&s;cinding act and that if it was not thus null and void, a re&s;cinding act
<PB N="99" REF="033425_0059_0FF74A7D3AFA2500">could not make it so:&mdash;therefore that the validity of the granting act ought to have been tried by courts.</HI></P>
<P>IF Gunn and Co. had rai&s;ed a military force, and with colours flying, drums beating, loaded artillery and all the impo&s;ing attitudes of ho&s;tile array, had procured this grant&mdash;and afterwards the &s;tate of Georgia had, by armed force, overpowered the&s;e in|vaders&mdash;and the a&s;&s;embly had afterwards convened and re&s;cinded the grant, and outlawed Gunn &amp; Co. would not all the world &s;ay they had done right&mdash; and that burning was good enough for an act thus obtained? All kings, all nations and &s;overeign &s;tates would do this, and the world would approve it; but their approbation would be founded on princi|ples broader and more enlarged than are contempla|ted in the books.</P>
<P>THE principles of the laws of nature and nations, including the laws of morality, take root deeper than the roots of &s;ociety&mdash;the book deci&s;ions take root in a &s;oil le&s;s deep than that of &s;ociety&mdash;the &s;overeignty of the people is between them. Society is founded on fir&s;t principles&mdash;Legi&s;latures declare the opera|tion of tho&s;e principles&mdash;Courts apply the&s;e decla|rations to all the variety of ca&s;es, which the weak|ne&s;s and wickedne&s;s of man pre&s;ent for their deci|&s;ion. The &s;overeignty of the people never aliena|ted to its &s;ervants the judges of courts a right to judge of impo&s;itions on that &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>OF extremes of fraud or force this &s;overeign peo|ple will judge, le&s;&s;er violations are left to courts.&mdash; Once adopt as a principle that in &s;uch ca&s;es, courts may decide over the heads of legi&s;latures, and you di&s;&s;eize the people of all &s;overeignty and erect <HI>impe|ria in imperiis</HI> without end.</P>
<P>THE confu&s;ion of leaving a que&s;tion of this kind to courts would be endle&s;s. Without books or prin|ciples
<PB N="100" REF="033425_0060_0FF74A8425A3D570">to form their deci&s;ions, and without power to enforce them, the claimants would be led into im|men&s;e expence without po&s;&s;ible profit.</P>
<P>HAPPILY the que&s;tion about the validity of the granting act has been decided by a power, from which there is no appeal; and the re&s;cinding act has pub|li&s;hed this deci&s;ion in terms, liable to no mi&s;con|&s;truction.</P>
<P>THE fourth argument is, <HI>That the re&s;cinding act is an ex po&s;t facto law.</HI></P>
<P>ALL this doctrine about ex po&s;t facto laws, are re|&s;pects this ca&s;e, is wholly irrelevant: for though it be law and rea&s;on, that no man &s;hall be puni&s;hed for the breach of a law pa&s;&s;ed after the commi&s;&s;ion of an act, and though no law of this de&s;cription can alter the rights of individuals as re&s;pects each other: yet all this cannot apply to contracts between &s;overeign and &s;ubject; for in the fir&s;t ca&s;e parties exi&s;t which can be called into court and compelled to an&s;wer: here there is but one exi&s;ting party&mdash;the other is be|yond the power of the court. It created the court, and in this creation never imparted to it a power to control it&s;elf in legi&s;lative mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>THE term <HI>ex po&s;t facto law</HI> was derived from the immorality and inexpediency of &s;uch laws: but it wholly lo&s;es its name, where it lo&s;es its application; that is, when the after law is both moral and expe|dient, and when the power making the law is in ev|ery re&s;pect uncontrolable.</P>
<P>THIS argument therefore is weak for two import|ant rea&s;ons; one, that it cannot apply to the ca&s;e: another, that if it might apply in theory, there is no court or power on earth, mighty enough to make the application in practice.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="033425_0061_0FF74A8D691CA498">
THE fifth argument is, <HI>That a grant is &s;acred and irrever&s;ible; therefore that the re&s;cinding act cannot de&s;|troy the force of the granting act.</HI></P>
<P>IF the Georgia grant is &s;acred now, it would have been &s;o, if the whole &s;enate and hou&s;e of repre&s;enta|tives and governor had been bribed and if the land had been &s;old for five dollars, in&s;tead of half a mill|ion; but the fact is, nothing can make a grant <HI>&s;a|cred,</HI> but the <HI>&s;acred integrity</HI> of the contracting par|ties.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Truth and integrity being ab&s;olute requi&s;ites in contracts, fal&s;|hood and fraud render them po&s;itively void. <HI>See Hutchin&s;on on law of nature.</HI></NOTE> Nothing can make a grant irrever&s;ible, but <HI>a want of power in both parties to rever&s;e it.</HI> In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e was no &s;ympton of integrity, and one of the contracting parties, having <HI>abundant power</HI> for the purpo&s;e, has actually rever&s;ed it. Hence equity and power have been united in proving, to the con|fu&s;ion of the Georgia companies and di&s;appointment of the northern purcha&s;ers, that the granting act was neither &s;acred nor inviolable.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE the &s;tate had received for this land 800,000 dollars, the highe&s;t price offered, and the a&s;&s;embly had, without any corruption, or collu&s;ion, con&s;titutionally, freely and with the full con&s;ent of their con&s;tituents, granted this land and had receiv|ed full pay for it and had afterwards, on any pre|tence, re&s;cinded it and kept the money&mdash;all the world would have cried out <HI>&s;hame!</HI> But what good would all this do to the &s;uffering purcha&s;er? What lawyer could point to him any mode of reve&s;ting him|&s;elf with a &s;ole exclu&s;ive right to buy the&s;e lands? Tis beyond the power of human invention.</P>
<P>IF in &s;uch ca&s;e the &s;tate had owned the fee and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the individual had a&s;&s;erted and regained his right by force of arms&mdash;all the world might &s;ay,
<PB N="102" REF="033425_0062_0FF74A979CDAAC48">he had done well in oppo&s;ing might to might, and in redre&s;&s;ing an injury: But now in order to do this he mu&s;t fir&s;t violate the laws of nature and na|tions by extirpating the right owners; and they mu&s;t expatriate every principle of decency and hon|e&s;ty, in attempting to vindicate by force, a claim founded in fraud and iniquity; for very different from the above ca&s;e, in point of equity and morality, has been the conduct of the &s;tate of Georgia. By their re&s;cinding act, while they have a&s;&s;erted the ma|je&s;ty of a &s;overeign people, they have exerci&s;ed all the equity of an individual, by forgiving the wrong and offering to refund the money.</P>
<P>THE condition of <HI>&s;tatu quo</HI> propo&s;ed by this act, though generally recogni&s;ed among all nations, as a <HI>de&s;ideratum</HI> between contending parties is not at all to the humor of the&s;e colluders. It &s;evers them forever from the pro&s;pect of immen&s;e wealth with|out labor, invention or hone&s;ty, which was the glo|rious boon in pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>HAD the &s;tate confi&s;cated the purcha&s;e money, for the treachery practi&s;ed again&s;t the &s;overeign people, more might have been &s;aid; but they have honora|bly offered it back to tho&s;e who depo&s;ited it. Try them by the law of nations for this re&s;cinding act and they will be honorably acquitted. Tried by the laws of nature, the &s;tate of Georgia would be ap|proved.</P>
<P>FROM all the maxims, which regulate &s;overeign &s;tates, the claimants fly to courts of inferior juri&s;dic|tion&mdash;courts highly re&s;pectable in their in&s;titution&mdash; highly capable of admini&s;tering ju&s;tice between man and man; but <HI>wholly inadequate,</HI> in delegated power, for a deci&s;ion of this que&s;tion; and in &s;uch courts, borrowing the mantles of more hone&s;t &s;uitors, they practically avow their de&s;igns of plunder, and not content with having violated the principles of fair
<PB N="103" REF="033425_0063_0FF74AA5C970FA18">dealing in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, would under the ma&s;k of law, <HI>pirate the world</HI> of the fair di&s;tinctions which &s;ub|&s;i&s;t between hone&s;t and di&s;hone&s;t applicants for ju&s;|tice.</P>
<P>CONTRACTS between kings and &s;ubjects, between &s;overeign &s;tates and individuals, &s;tand on <HI>moral,</HI> not on legal principles.</P>
<P>THE high approbation, with which the re&s;cinding act is now received by an impartial public, e&s;tabli&s;hes its conformity to the laws of morality and of nature. If the advocates of this argument could have &s;hewn that this grant was fairly and &s;acredly obtained, the public would have lamented that this &s;overeign pow|er had been immorally exerci&s;ed: but the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity that &s;overeign power &s;hould in all govern|ments re&s;ide &s;omewhere, has foreclo&s;ed all appeals in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</P>
<P>THE &s;ixth argument is, <HI>That the Indian right to part of the lands de&s;cribed in the granting act has been extingui&s;hed&mdash;therefore that the re&s;cinding act could not at be&s;t reach the whole.</HI></P>
<P>To this my remarks on the nullity of &s;ale (nei|ther partly in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion) furni&s;h a &s;ufficient an&s;wer.</P>
<P>THE &s;eventh argument is, <HI>That the companies are &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the original deeds of Governor Matthews &mdash;therefore that the re&s;cinding act, by de&s;troying the re|cords, cannot have de&s;troyed the title.</HI></P>
<P>BUT deeds are only evidences of title, and like other evidences, they may &s;peak truth or fal&s;hood &mdash;theirs in conveying the fee violate the truth.&mdash; Deeds may be good or bad&mdash;valid or void, accord|ing
<PB N="104" REF="033425_0064_0FF74AB3B1DA40B8">to the power of the contracting parties, or the integrity and legality of their contracts. The&s;e deeds were given by a party, unable to contract: they were founded on fraud, and the &s;ubject of them was uncon&s;titutional and illegal. Deeds create no fee-&s;imple, nor any other quantity of e&s;tate in lands. The e&s;tate mu&s;t fir&s;t exi&s;t: but it did not exi&s;t in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. Your original deeds from the Go|vernor can an&s;wer no other purpo&s;e, than as a &s;tan|ding memorial, that there was a time, when certain repre&s;entatives of a free people were guilty of mo&s;t abandoned treachery again&s;t their con&s;tituents, and when there was a cla&s;s of men, capable of improving the ba&s;e&s;t of means for the vile&s;t of ends:&mdash;but the re&s;cinding act is to remain as an illu&s;trious memori|al of the everla&s;ting abhorrence with which their treachery and your corruption are to be regarded by this and future generations.</P>
<P>THE foregoing and &s;imilar arguments have been propo&s;ed by the &s;ellers in every form in order to give currency to a &s;econd edition of <HI>delu&s;ions,</HI> which may be truly &s;aid to be <HI>much enlarged</HI> by the authors. Every principle of law and equity has been put on the rack to compel a di&s;clo&s;ure of &s;omething in favor of the granting act. The books and their con&s;erva|tors have been put in requi&s;ition. Ca&s;es have been nicely fa&s;hioned to the fancy of employers, and the mighty quotient has been <HI>that the re&s;cinding act is good for nothing!</HI></P>
<P>AMIDST the preparations for ho&s;tility, &s;ome of the northern purcha&s;ers have been di&s;comfited&mdash;&s;ome &s;ettlements have been effected; but even the&s;e have been magnified and multiplied, for the purpo&s;e of drawing others to accommodation.

<P>A THOROUGH detail of the frauds practi&s;ed in the fir&s;t, &s;econd and la&s;t &s;tages of this bu&s;ine&s;s would be voluminous, and in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e of no other u&s;e than to add a new chapter to the volume of argu|ments which prove to what a depth of degradation the predominant lu&s;t of wealth is able to &s;ink the character of man, and to what a boundle&s;s field of wickedne&s;s, tho&s;e men are introduced who leave the path of morals and integrity, and abandon their duty as men and members of &s;ociety.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The frauds practiced in the northern &s;ales are within the knowl|edge and proof of the companies or individuals on whom they were practi&s;ed.</NOTE></P>

THE depo&s;itions here pre&s;ented need no other commentary, than the <HI>able and practical</HI> one made on them by the re&s;cinding act. I have endeavoured to notice &s;ummarily the arguments again&s;t this act in one or another part of the&s;e numbers. They have been of every de&s;cription. Whatever could opiate the reflections or brighten the pro&s;pects of the Georgia &s;ellers has been improved; but no one has met the re&s;cinding act at the point, where it concentres all its &s;trength; which is in THE SOVEREIGNTY OF AN IN|DEPENDENT STATE. This &s;tands above all the ar|guments oppo&s;ed to it, and will continue &s;o to do, till &s;ome one will find a power mighty enough to control it.</P>
<P>THE re&s;cinding act of the United States, in re&s;pect to their promi&s;e to pay Spani&s;h milled dollars for continental bills, and the acts of the &s;everal &s;tates, which re&s;cinded their plighted faith for the payment of their notes and bills, were never called in que&s;tion; although the&s;e acts involved property to the amount of millions, and affected &s;ubjects, who&s;e meritorious &s;ervices and hone&s;t earnings of the bills or notes were never doubted. This re&s;cinding re&s;ulted from the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, and became irre&s;i&s;tible BY REA|SON OF THE VERY SOVEREIGNTY, WHICH PASSED IT. But now, where nece&s;&s;ity and equity were com|bined with this &s;overeignty, a re&s;cinding act mu&s;t be|come in&s;tantly void&mdash;becau&s;e <HI>purcha&s;ers of members rights</HI> are in danger of &s;uffering. The fir&s;t re&s;cinding acts contemplated bills, purporting to be equal to Spani&s;h dollars. The la&s;t operated on deeds pur|porting to convey fee &s;imples. The bills and the deeds were equally deceitful: yet the &s;ufferer by the fir&s;t is left to lament that he tru&s;ted to a power beyond his control; while the <HI>purcha&s;ers of members rights</HI> are to bid defiance to the power which has already cru&s;h|ed them.</P>

THIS vain ga&s;conading, the&s;e nice di&s;tinctions re|&s;ult not from rea&s;on and nature; not from prece|dents and principles; but from judgments perverted by money and from the mi&s;erable items of a fee-table.</P>
<P>NOT being &s;o well ver&s;ed in the indexes of law books as the oppo&s;ers of the re&s;cinding act, I beg leave to clo&s;e this number with a fable, the due ap|plication of which will render further di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the merits of this act unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P><HI>ONCE on a time, a lion and a fox entered into a treaty of mutual convenants; but the fox had craftily drawn the lion into articles, wholly foreign from the object of the trea|ty, and very inconvenient for the lion to perform. The lion di&s;covering the treachery determined on redre&s;s when a fair opportunity &s;hould pre&s;ent. Soon after, Reynard took the liberty of breaking a very e&s;&s;ential article; upon which the lion, without ceremony, put him to death.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THE foxes a&s;&s;embled and complaining bitterly of cruelty and tyranny, determined,</HI> 1&s;t. <HI>That the lion had no right to put Reynard to death.</HI> 2d. <HI>That the que&s;tion about the breach of treaty ought to have been tried by a court of foxes. And</HI> 3d. <HI>That as the lion had no right to kill Reynard, and as the que&s;tion ought to have been tried, therefore</HI> Reynard was not dead. <HI>Able coun&s;ellors were named to make out the ca&s;e, and report their opinion. After much con&s;ultation they reported as follows:</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. <HI>SUPPOSE Reynard was now alive&mdash;and &s;uppo&s;e a lion was no &s;tronger than a fox&mdash;then he could not kill a fox; therefore</HI> Reynard is &s;till alive.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. <HI>SUPPOSE a lion never before killed a fox for breach of treaty; then the lion had nothing to ju&s;tify him in doing it; therefore he has not done it, and therefore</HI> Reynard is &s;till alive.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d. <HI>As Reynard had, after making the treaty, lived for a con&s;iderable time&mdash;and as his breath had ve&s;ted in
<PB N="123" REF="033425_0083_0FF74B41E0B667A8">him; therefore the lion could not take it away and there|fore</HI> Reynard is certainly alive. <HI>All which was hum|bly &s;ubmitted.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>As the burden of the bu&s;ine&s;s was</HI> Reynard's alive, <HI>and as the whole a&s;&s;embly of foxes wi&s;hed to believe it, the report was unanimou&s;ly adopted; and the coun&s;ellors were re-appointed to devi&s;e and report ways and means for carrying this judgment into effect.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THIS was an arduous ta&s;k; but they at length reported that as this lion was very powerful aad lawle&s;s, it would be be&s;t to wait for his decea&s;e, and perhaps his &s;ucce&s;&s;or might be as &s;mall and weak as a mou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To this it was objected, that as the life of a fox was far &s;hort of that of a lion, the pre&s;ent generation would not have the honor of carrying their judgment into effect. They therefore appointed a committee to wait on the lion with a copy of their judgment and to demand his a&s;&s;ent to their propo&s;itions. This being delivered, the monarch of the fore&s;t replied&mdash;</HI> <Q><HI>Your rea&s;oning may be very good; if you will appoint one of your number to enforce it upon me, I will receive him in the anti-chamber where your Reynard-alive is depo&s;ited; and further tell your a&s;|&s;embly, that when foxes deal with lions they mu&s;t deal with good faith.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>THAT</HI> Reynard was actually dead <HI>had been a &s;ore thing at the bottom of all their mea&s;ures: but good rea&s;oning had hitherto kept them up. Now this &s;evere an&s;wer returned to the company produced a &s;adne&s;s, which led to the following humbling re&s;olves:</HI></P>

<P>IN the&s;e numbers I have endeavoured to combine, in a narrow compa&s;s, a variety of con&s;iderations, calculated to pre&s;ent this &s;ubject to you as wholly dif|ferent from all others. My aim has been to unite you in a belief that you have obtained nothing for your money or your notes. Such an union would lead to a combination of mea&s;ures for your relief wholly irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>BEFORE I pledge my confidence in &s;uch a combi|nation, it may be prudent to con&s;ider the different cla&s;&s;es of men who are to unite&mdash;the ob&s;tacles to this union&mdash;and to &s;um up the real &s;trength of this &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t cla&s;s is of tho&s;e, who placed implicit con|fidence in all the &s;tories of the &s;ellers&mdash;who had amu|&s;ed them&s;elves with the delicious idea of immen&s;e wealth&mdash;and had anticipated the &s;plendor of fortune. It is hard for the&s;e to unbelieve&mdash;to renounce their idol&mdash;to part with their phantom&mdash;to reflect that they have been duped.</P>
<P>OF a &s;econd cla&s;s are a few, who have paid little attention to this &s;ubject; who have a general idea, that &s;tates cannot re&s;cind their grants; who have
<PB N="125" REF="033425_0085_0FF74B6E704A5DA0">advanced but little money; who have heard much profane abu&s;e again&s;t Jack&s;on and his party and have been willing to receive it as argument.</P>
<P>OF a third cla&s;s are &s;ome, who partly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the &s;ellers and partly by their own hopes have made up a &s;ort of &s;y&s;tem about this bu&s;ine&s;s, out of very mixt ingredients&mdash;and after very liberal abatements of the fraud&mdash;very high conceptions of the &s;acred nature of a grant&mdash;&s;ome &s;ugge&s;tions that the re&s;cind|ing act will be re&s;cinded and that if it is not, why it is no great matter, they believe it will all come out right in the end.</P>
<P>OF a fourth cla&s;s are a few, who have no opinion of their own; who a&s;k every man they meet, what he thinks of the Georgia bu&s;ine&s;s; who tremble at the &s;haking of a leaf; who feel &s;ome re&s;entment at the fraud; but dare not utter it&mdash;le&s;t the&s;e lion-like <HI>pur|cha&s;ers of members rights</HI> &s;hould eat them up; but who are willing to have a &s;tout defence made in their cau|&s;es, if they can only keep clear of the bu&s;tle.</P>
<P>THE fifth and mo&s;t numerous cla&s;s is of tho&s;e, who feel indignant at the &s;windling and fraud practi&s;ed in the &s;ales; who feel practically that the re&s;cinding act is fatal to their claim: who are willing to receive every rational propo&s;ition in favor of a defence in their cau&s;es&mdash;and to unite in mea&s;ures well adapted for that end.</P>

<P>THEY tell you, that the legi&s;lature of 1795, was uniformly re&s;pectable; and that of 1796, was con|temptible&mdash;that the people of influence in Georgia de&s;pi&s;e the re&s;cinding act&mdash;that Gen. Jack&s;on is the main&s;pring of motion, and that whenever he retires, the granting act will be re&s;tored. But they careful|ly conceal from you the mea&s;ures taken to get members into the fir&s;t legi&s;lature, who might be bri|bed. They do not tell you that the offer of 800,000 dollars was a bona fide offer. They &s;ay nothing a|bout the armed force, which came to the legi&s;lature to prevent the pa&s;&s;ing of the granting act, and that the&s;e were not di&s;per&s;ed, till a&s;&s;urances were given, that if the act &s;hould pa&s;s, it &s;hould be re&s;cinded. They do not tell you, that after the act pa&s;&s;ed, the people were a&s;toni&s;hed to find the companies compo|&s;ed of &s;ome of the mo&s;t influential men in the &s;tate&mdash;nor do they tell you, that mo&s;t of the&s;e men denied any knowledge of their names being improved, and indignantly refu&s;ed to have any connection with the bu&s;ine&s;s: nor do they tell you, that on this di&s;cov|ery,
<PB N="127" REF="033425_0087_0FF74B835BE2AFE8">there was a general bur&s;t of indignation from among the people again&s;t the granting act&mdash;that the indignation of the con&s;tituents of ROBERDS THOMAS was not confined to making him hug a &s;apling, ac|cording to the la&s;t depo&s;ition; but that <HI>they put him to death.</HI> They do not tell you, that all the new&s;|papers, publi&s;hed in the &s;tate, expre&s;&s;ed unequivocally this indignation. They &s;ay nothing of the doings of the convention in May 1795; nor of the general preparations of the people of the &s;tate for the re&s;cin|ding of the grant. They cautiou&s;ly conceal their own exertions to counteract the &s;pirit of the people by at|tempting a re-election of the members in favor of the granting act&mdash;their conviction, that they could not procure more than <HI>five</HI> to their purpo&s;e; the fact that they got but <HI>three;</HI> their coming to the north|ward and effecting their &s;ales, <HI>while knowing all the&s;e things.</HI></P>
<P>YET te&s;timony of the&s;e things is now in our po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, and would be publi&s;hed, were they not re&s;erved to be pre&s;ented to the public in the trial of pending cau&s;es.</P>
<P>As to the character of the two legi&s;latures, it is unque&s;tionably true, that the characters of Mr. Watkins and &s;ome others in favor of the granting act are re&s;pectable; but no amount of individual character can wa&s;h away the &s;tain, which the re&s;cind|ing act has indelibly fixed on the legi&s;lature of 1795.</P>
<P>As to GOV. JACKSON, that he is a man of genius, re&s;ources and patrioti&s;m, and that he re&s;igned an em|inent rank in the federal legi&s;lature, to intere&s;t him|&s;elf again&s;t the obnoxious act is true, and that he had influence in effecting it is equally true. But among the other names in favor of this re&s;cinding act are al&s;o others of genius, re&s;oures and patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P>IT is beyond a que&s;tion that the body of the peo|ple approve the re&s;cinding act; el&s;e why are all the
<PB N="128" REF="033425_0088_0FF68282FAB96E98">Yazoo men, as they are termed, peaceably turned out of office? Why are the legi&s;lative, judicial and executive offices of the &s;tate filled with the advocates of the re&s;cinding act? Why has the &s;ame legi&s;lature been continued? Are we to be told in one breath that Gen. Jack&s;on has no influence except among a mi&s;erable rabble? And in the next that his influence over all the departments of government is uncontrol|able and wholly irre&s;i&s;tible, and that when he is out of the way, the great men, the rich men, and the mighty captains will dare to &s;hew their heads? <HI>The&s;e are mi&s;erable cobweb deceits.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the real merits of this &s;ubject, men are drawn by intere&s;t and credulity to numerous chime|ras&mdash;each of which, after &s;erving its purpo&s;e of de|lu&s;ion, will leave them. They are told that the lands are now worth more than they co&s;t. Who tells this? <HI>The &s;ellers.</HI> Why then do not the &s;ellers give practi|cal proof of this declaration by taking back the lands? They &s;ay they are not able; but the truth is that they would rather pur&s;ue you, through all the laby|rinths of law, <HI>for a &s;ingle cent per acre,</HI> than take back the lands. They are now rending together the rem|nants of their &s;hattered fortunes to pay immen&s;e charges in pro&s;ecuting for the recovery of &s;ome notes, which, if wholly undi&s;puted, would not bring 5<ABBR><HI>&s;</HI></ABBR> in the pound. They are telling that the granting act is good. Any man, who really believed this, would take back the lands; for, the granting act being good, and the lands worth what they declared them to be, they are worth as much now and be they worth ever &s;o little are worth more than their notes in &s;uit, by the certain difference of all the co&s;t and charge of &s;u&s;taining the &s;uits.</P>
<P>MIND not their <HI>words,</HI> but look at their <HI>actions.</HI> When they tell you that others have &s;ettled and paid in full, deny it; for there are ten chances to one that
<PB N="129" REF="033425_0089_0FF74B9471EF4F58">what you would under&s;tand by a &s;ettlement has not been made. Some who were mo&s;t powerfully under the influence of their delu&s;ions have paid in full; that number is &s;mall.

<P>BUT the fourth ob&s;tacle is, <HI>The books, and the o|pinions of Lawyers.</HI></P>
<P>My ideas on the application of books to this &s;ubject have been already expre&s;&s;ed&mdash;and as to Lawyers o|pinions, you may have ob&s;erved, that men, who have &s;uch cau&s;es to advocate as tho&s;e of the Georgia &s;el|lers, generally employ a great number of Lawyers. They wi&s;h to monopolize the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Hence you are in the way of hearing a great deal of law and a multitude of opinions, better calculated (I tru&s;t) to alarm than to convince you. <HI>Such are the following.</HI> That you mu&s;t certainly pay the &s;crip notes and as to negotiable notes there can be no que&s;tion about them, all the deci&s;ions are that way, and to this point they will refer you to the following ca&s;es, (Dyer 300. Hob. 62. Sid. 365. Lutw. 238. 2 Mod. 62. Carth. 413. Salk. 622. pl. 1. Comb. 443. <HI>Giles</HI> v. <HI>Hart.</HI> 3 Salk. 353. Ld. Raym. 254. S. C.) I have not been particular to &s;ee whether any of the books or pages quoted have even a &s;pecious reference to the ca&s;es in que&s;tion. That they apply as well as any other books or ca&s;es I have no doubt. The fact is, that the books, as they are called (meaning reports of ca&s;es, between Aplin and Booth, and Steel and Ma&s;on, &amp;c.) are not mighty enough to decide a que&s;|tion depending &s;olely on the law of nature and na|tions.
<PB N="130" REF="033425_0090_0FF74B9B716994F8">The writers of &s;uch books never conceived of a pre-emptive right, and never heard of a &s;ove|reign independent &s;tate re&s;cinding an act. Any at|torney's clerk may find authorities enough about FEE and GRANT and OUSTER and DISSEISIN and what the judges of We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall have &s;aid about landed tenures; but what the&s;e have to do with a legi&s;lative act of a &s;overeign &s;tate, impowering their governor, contrary to con&s;titution, to convey the <HI>fee-&s;imple</HI> right of the &s;tate, to buy land of the right ow|ners, is beyond my conception.</P>
<P>THE real e&s;&s;ential difference between this &s;ubject in every point of view and all the &s;ubjects in tho&s;e books, di&s;tances all application.</P>
<P>THE introduction of Engli&s;h books into our prac|tice is much like our own introduction into this coun|try. In that country an enormous national debt, an expen&s;ive army and navy, extravagant &s;chemes of foreign murder and ambition, and an incalculable civil li&s;t, "dragging its &s;low length along," through the crooked paths of &s;ecret &s;ervice money, &s;inecures and all the items of abandoned expence, rendered it nece&s;&s;ary for the government to command and en|gro&s;s the coin and to &s;et up the idol paper in its &s;tead. This policy rendered it nece&s;&s;ary to protect and &s;up|port the paper, and this nece&s;&s;ity, originating with bank-bills, government &s;ecurities and company &s;tocks, at length extended its jaws to private notes, bills and bonds and the whole became fa&s;t bound in an imperious, un&s;een and irre&s;i&s;tible policy. The king's judges were con&s;trained to bend the whole practice of law, within the&s;e limits, to this policy. Hence come negotiable notes. Hence the nice &s;ubtlety, that fraud and want of con&s;ideration &s;hall not be pleadable again&s;t notes. Hence the expedi|ent of turning men round to the chancery &s;ide of
<PB N="131" REF="033425_0091_0FF74BA1C0B32748">courts for manife&s;t ju&s;tice, or obliging them to pay their notes and &s;ue for the fraud.</P>
<P>THOUGH our &s;y&s;tem of landed tenures and our whole policy was widely variant from that of Eng|land; yet the indroduction of all the&s;e &s;ubtleties was well enough. It &s;aved us from the trouble of erect|ing a &s;y&s;tem of common law on common rea&s;on and our own circum&s;tances&mdash;it loaded our libraries with Engli&s;h books&mdash;kept us <HI>piou&s;ly</HI> in mind of our moth|er country&mdash;and increa&s;ed the glorious uncertainty of the law. While it always furni&s;hed one &s;ide with abundance of precedents, it afforded the other a no|ble occa&s;ion of &s;hewing that the precedents did not apply. And thus, however barren of incident a cau&s;e might be; yet our juries, &s;worn to judge accor|ding to the evidence given them in court and the <HI>laws of the &s;tate</HI> have &s;eldom failed to be amu&s;ed by the authorities; and jury-rooms have re&s;ounded more with di&s;cu&s;&s;ions about the comparative merit of the ca&s;es cited from the books, than of the ca&s;e which they had &s;olemnly engaged to decide.</P>
<P>ALL this was well enough, and if any of tho&s;e books declare, that <HI>notes originating out of Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi &s;cript or negotiable notes for the fee of land which does not exi&s;t, or of pre-emption good for nothing, or for both un|der a re&s;cinded grant</HI> &s;hall be recovered; or if any ca&s;e can be found, ju&s;tifying &s;uch a conclu&s;ion, I will freely give up the que&s;tion. But the impo&s;&s;ibility of any fair application has been &s;ufficiently di&s;cu&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I ONLY add that a note is evidence of indebtedne&s;s and like other evidences may be deceitful. A note may have been &s;igned or not &s;igned by the per&s;on who&s;e name is &s;ub&s;cribed to it&mdash;it may have been give under dure&s;s; and if it has been obtained by extreme force or fraud, or if the con&s;ideration has wholly and manife&s;tly failed, in innumerable in&s;tances the books will &s;hew that negotiable bonds, bills, &amp;c.
<PB N="132" REF="033425_0092_0FF74BAA639EE198">have been avoided, both at law and in chancery. If then the bare exi&s;tence of a note is not conclu&s;ive a|gain&s;t the maker or endor&s;er, your lawyers can form you a defence, combining more &s;trength, than can be found in the books.</P>
<P>LAWYERS from their habits of thinking, of com|bining facts and arguments, and of public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, are well able to rai&s;e a &s;y&s;tem upon this unpreceden|ted &s;ubject; but meerly as lawyers, under&s;tanding the books, they are no more competent to manage the&s;e cau&s;es, <HI>than a ma&s;on is competent to repair the ru|ins of the fall or a &s;urgeon to amputate a tree.</HI> But if they feel confidence in their books, let them prove by them the right of their clients to &s;ell the &s;ee of the&s;e lands&mdash;let them &s;torm in front the &s;overeignty of the &s;tate of Georgia&mdash;and batter down the ever|la&s;ting rights of the natives to the premi&s;es;&mdash;then &s;hall we have an argument worth a fee.</P>
<P>BUT in&s;tead of this we have ca&s;es made out of &s;uppo&s;itions; &s;uch as, <HI>&s;uppo&s;e the fee of the lands be|longed to the &s;tate, and &s;uppo&s;e the &s;tate hone&s;tly &s;old it,</HI> why then the following ca&s;es will apply.</P>

<P>BUT oppo&s;ed to every ob&s;tacle, &s;tands the real &s;trength of your cau&s;e. In the fir&s;t pamphlet having &s;ugge&s;ted the different con&s;iderations, compo&s;ing this &s;ubject and in this having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed tho&s;e, which were mo&s;t important, I now proceed to pre&s;ent you the following general conclu&s;ions-</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. BY the Georgia deeds, by your own deeds, by the pamphlets and by the declarations of the &s;ellers, you had a right to believe that you had bought the FEE of the lands in que&s;tion. This was what you bar|gained
<PB N="135" REF="033425_0095_0FF682896F2703B0">for, and what you are entitled to have; for this only have your monies been paid and your notes been given: You are not obliged to accept any &s;ub|&s;titute: If the fee has failed, the whole con&s;ideration of the bargains has failed: The bargains are wholly void, and courts of chancery will compel the holders to give up your notes and refund your money, or courts of law, exerci&s;ing concurrent powers, will af|ford you equal relief.</P>
<P>I HAVE now left the field, where books and the power of courts cannot reach; but though the books cannot furni&s;h nor confute your premi&s;es, they af|ford abundant application, as &s;oon as your notes, founded on tho&s;e premi&s;es, are within the cogni|zance of courts.</P>
<P>BUT the fee has <HI>wholly failed.</HI> It is not &s;u&s;tained by the law of nature&mdash;by the principles of our landed tenures&mdash;by any precedent, nor by the policy of the United States; but Congre&s;s has denied the exi&s;t|ence of a fee in a &s;imilar ca&s;e. The Indians, by the very &s;hewing of the State of Facts, own rightfully every thing about the lands, which con&s;titutes a fee; and the &s;overeign people of Georgia do not now pre|tend that they ever owned the <HI>fee:</HI> and there is no per&s;on, who undertakes to quote any time, at which this fee ve&s;ted in Georgia, or any &s;ource from which they could have derived it. Every argument on the &s;ubject of the fee is decidedly in favor of the natives, who po&s;&s;e&s;s it.</P>
<P>IT is fair therefore to conclude that you have wholly failed of that which was the &s;ubject of your bargains, and the con&s;ideration of your notes; which conclu&s;ion will ju&s;tify the relief before propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>THIS &s;elling of a fee, which did not exi&s;t, is a fraud of &s;ufficient magnitude to exonerate you from payment, and the proof that it was thus &s;old, and that it did not exi&s;t in the &s;ellers, is within the reach of
<PB N="136" REF="033425_0096_0FF74BCCD692D6D0">every one of you. The &s;ellers adroitly calculated, (as &s;atan did when he propo&s;ed the comeline&s;s of the fruit) that the word <HI>fee</HI> would be alluring to purcha|&s;ers, and therefore in&s;erted it, computing that when that failed, a decent &s;ub&s;titute would be preferred to a breaking up of their bargains; but they relied too much on their &s;ucce&s;s in the fir&s;t delu&s;ions, and little imagined that the &s;pirit of an independent people would reduce a <HI>majority</HI> to the number of <HI>three</HI> and that the act would be re&s;cinded with marks of dete&s;|tation.</P>
<P>THE plau&s;ible right of pre-emption was intended as a &s;ub&s;titute, and this to the northern purcha&s;ers was not without its comeline&s;s; the argument that the companies &s;old in Georgia, and bought of, and &s;old to each other, takes nothing from the imputa|tion. This was all done with an eye to the event, which was to &s;ell again.</P>
<P N="2">2d. THIS PRE-EMPTION, (as it is termed) turns out to be the mo&s;t delu&s;ive of all &s;hadows; as unlike to a <HI>fee</HI> and as mi&s;erable a &s;ub&s;titute as could be con|ceived of. After exploring every re&s;ource, we at length find, that a right to purcha&s;e lands of the na|tives is ab&s;olutely involved in a right to hold a treaty with the natives, which right can alone be acquired from the Pre&s;ident of the union&mdash;that the United States are under no expre&s;s nor implicit obligation to grant it to a &s;tate or to any individual company, in preference to another&mdash;that they have never granted it, for the purpo&s;e of purcha&s;e, except when the Indians were di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ell&mdash;that the native po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the&s;e lands are never likely to con&s;ent to &s;ell; for the principal nation among them are <HI>very aver&s;e to part|ing with their lands.</HI></P>
<P>WE therefore find, that we never had any thing more by our deeds, than a fractional part of the declaration of the repre&s;entatives of Georgia, that
<PB N="137" REF="033425_0097_0FF74BD3D8552810">they would not apply for this right to hold a treaty&mdash; which &s;tate of Georgia was the lea&s;t likely of any in the union to obtain &s;uch a permi&s;&s;ion&mdash;and we find that we could never avail our&s;elves of this declaration in any other way, than by application to the pre&s;i|dent (if a proper time &s;hould ever arrive) &s;tating as a ground of &s;uperior merit, that we had bought this declaration. This time would not probably arrive, till the lap&s;e of many ages, and if any of our po&s;ter|ity &s;hould &s;tate to congre&s;s that their ance&s;tors had been dupes to a &s;et of &s;peculators, I tru&s;t it would not reflect much honor on us or them.</P>
<P>TIS true that this permi&s;&s;ion to hold treaty has been &s;ometimes granted to the relea&s;ees of a &s;tate; but if our right of pre-emption, our <HI>&s;ub&s;titute for a fee-&s;imple,</HI> is reduced to the pitiful chance of being THE MOST MERITORIOUS BEGGARS FOR A RIGHT TO CHEAT INDIANS, it mu&s;t be declared a mo&s;t delu|&s;ive &s;ub&s;titute, and if any thing more can be made of it, it mu&s;t be done by men more capable than I am of di&s;cerning its merits.</P>
<P N="3">3d. BUT this negative, worthle&s;s declaration of the &s;tate of Georgia, <HI>which the breath of a &s;outhern &s;lave might have blown into its original nothingne&s;s,</HI> has been cru&s;hed by a power mighty enough to have annihila|ted a fee-&s;imple, combined with an ab&s;olute right to deforce the occupants. The re&s;cinding act pre&s;ents a &s;y&s;tem of fraud in the companies, which would been fatal to any claim of whatever nature or de&s;cription. Call it a fee and exclude the fraud, and the contract has been &s;hewn to be void on principles of common law; but introduce the fraud, which is the principal argument in the act it&s;elf, and a new and conclu&s;ive defence in your favor is derived from this fraud.</P>
<P>THAT the very men, of whom you purcha&s;ed were guilty of this fraud, is proved by a cloud of witne&s;|&s;es.
<PB N="138" REF="033425_0098_0FF74BDD3B6863A8">Nearly the whole legi&s;lature of 1796, acting without any bias of private intere&s;t in a high re&s;pon|&s;ible capacity, have, by a public and &s;olemn act, de|clared their belief in this te&s;timony&mdash;and the &s;ove|reign people, year after year, are bearing public te&s;|timony of the integrity of their legi&s;lators in this tran&s;action.</P>
<P>FRAUD cannot be more conclu&s;ively proved, and this fraud has been practi&s;ed by the very men, who are pur&s;uing you for payment of your notes. Can a &s;tronger ca&s;e be laid before a court?</P>
<P>WHEN the&s;e frauds are thoroughly known to our courts, the books and the authorities will be of as little avail to the coun&s;el, as the rocks and the moun|tains will be to their clients in another day.</P>
<P>THE di&s;tinction, which I have taken, between that part of this &s;ubject, where the books cannot apply&mdash; and that part, where they may apply, is preci&s;ely this.

<P>FRAUD of the fir&s;t magnitude has been conceived, brought forth, matured and &s;tands confe&s;t before the court, at the very point of the&s;e cau&s;es, where the books can be con&s;i&s;tently opened&mdash;and opened at this point, the authorities both at law and in chan|cery are conclu&s;ively in your favor.

Did ever the holder of a counterfeit bill recover the amount from the bank and turn it round to the wretch, who fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed it? Will it an&s;wer for the holder to &s;ay that he exchanged &s;ilver for it? No! The reply of the bank is, <HI>we received nothing for it.</HI></P>
<P>As a bill mu&s;t be originally good, &s;o mu&s;t a nego|tiable note be good, and if it fail in any of the <HI>requi|&s;ites</HI> of a good note, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, that failure is not helped by its pa&s;&s;ing from hand to hand. This remark is true in a qualified &s;en&s;e&mdash;that is, a note mu&s;t be legally &s;igned by the maker or endor&s;|er, and this not under any fear of bodily harm. It mu&s;t be legally the act and deed of the maker or en|dor&s;er. The&s;e are ab&s;olute requi&s;ites and the want of them cannot be &s;upplied by any change of owners.</P>
<P>So a note, which, through fraud or any other cau&s;e, might have been avoided, had the &s;uit been in the name of the party to the fraud, is not made good, by its having been pa&s;&s;ed from hand to hand, <HI>when that very pa&s;&s;ing was done for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of aid|ing a recovery</HI>&mdash;which is preci&s;ely true and proveable re&s;pecting a great number and perhaps all the notes of this de&s;cription.</P>

<HEAD>STENT VS BAILIS. (See Peere Williams, 2d. Vol. page 218.)</HEAD>
<P>THIS was a bill to be relieved again&s;t a contract in writing for the &s;ale of eleven &s;hares in the Lu&s;tring Company, which &s;hares were never transferred, the books of the Company being &s;hut up, &amp;c.</P>
<P>FOR the defendant, it was objected, 1&s;t. That though this was a hard ca&s;e on the now plaintiff; yet that it had been likewi&s;e hard on the defendant, who was not a contriver of the project; but a &s;ufferer by it, having him&s;elf bought &s;tocks at high rates. 2d. That equity ought, in &s;uch ca&s;es, to &s;tand neuter and to let the hard&s;hip re&s;t where the law had ca&s;t it, and at law, now the defendant had a ver|dict. 3d. Though the books had been &s;hut for &s;ome time, it was im|po&s;&s;ible to know but that they might be open again, and that in a lit|tle time, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Ma&s;ter of the Rolls.</HI> It is again&s;t natural ju&s;tice that any one &s;hould pay for a bargain, which he cannot have; there ought to be <HI>quid pro
<PB N="141" REF="033425_0101_0FF74BF64EA54868">quo;</HI> but in this ca&s;e the defendant has &s;old the plaintiff <HI>a bubble or moon&s;hine.</HI></P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible that this bargain &s;hould ever be made good to the plaintiff; for here is proof by the company's own &s;ecretary of his having advi&s;ed with three eminent coun&s;el, who all agreed that the company cannot ju&s;tify accepting any more transfers, and the mo|ney cannot be &s;aid to be due in con&s;cience, <HI>&s;uppo&s;ing the plaintiff to be incapable of coming at what he contracted for and in con&s;ideration whereof he was to pay his money.</HI></P>
<P>IF I &s;hould buy an hou&s;e and before &s;uch time as, by the articles I am to pay for the &s;ame, the hou&s;e be burnt down by ca&s;ualty of fire, I &s;hall not in equity be bound to pay for the hou&s;e: and yet the hou&s;e may be built up again: but I doubt it will be impo&s;&s;ible to &s;et up the company again, as in the other ca&s;e the &s;eller may do the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>IT being four years &s;ince the contract; and the books having never been opened &s;ince, it is to be pre&s;umed they never will.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY it cannot be imagined that the plaintiff would have been prevailed upon to covenant for the payment of the money at a preci&s;e day, had he entertained the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion, that the books would never have been opened.</P>
<P>As to the objection that the plaintiff here might have defended him&s;elf at law&mdash;Matters of fraud are cognizable in equity as well as at law. The &s;eller in this ca&s;e is the chief actor; he went to market with the bubble and &s;ince no transfer can be made let there be a per|petual injunction and let the defendant, at the plaintiffs charge, enter &s;atisfaction on the judgment.</P>
<P>ON a rehearing, it was contended for the defendant that he was not the fir&s;t projector or inventor (of the bubble,) &amp;c. but no opinion was had&mdash;the cau&s;e being adju&s;ted by the parties.</P>

<HEAD>COLT &amp; al' vs. WOOLLASTON &amp; ARNOLD. (P. Will. vol. II. p. 155.)</HEAD>
<P>THE plaintiffs brought their bill to be repaid the two &s;everal &s;ums of 120<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and 120<ABBR>l.</ABBR> which they had paid to the defendants, as mana|gers and projectors of a bubble, called the <HI>Land Security and Oil Patent.</HI></P>
<P>THE defendant <HI>Woolla&s;ton</HI> had (it &s;eems) invented a project for ex|tracting oil out of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> radi&s;hes, and got a patent for the &s;ole ex|erci&s;e of this invention; and having bought an e&s;tate for 31,800<ABBR>l.</ABBR> cal|led <HI>Sutton Mar&s;h</HI> in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> formerly the e&s;tate of lady <HI>Corn|bury,</HI> which was then in mortgage for 28,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR></P>
<P>IN <HI>June</HI> 1720, this <HI>Woolla&s;ton</HI> made public this project and a&s;&s;igned his oil patent to the defendant <HI>Arnold,</HI> in tru&s;t for all the contributors
<PB N="142" REF="033425_0102_0FF74BFC8A77A060">towards the project, which he divided into five thou&s;and &s;hares, valu|ing every &s;hare at 20<ABBR>l.</ABBR> in order to rai&s;e 100,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR></P>
<P>AND as an encouragement and &s;ecurity for all the contributors, <HI>Woolla&s;ton</HI> conveyed his purcha&s;e of <HI>Sutton Mar&s;h</HI> to the defendant <HI>Arnold</HI> and his heirs, in tru&s;t, in the fir&s;t place, to pay off the two mortgages, being 28,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and afterwards to pay to him&s;elf (the &s;aid <HI>Woolla&s;ton</HI>) 57,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> in all 85,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and as to the &s;urplus which the e&s;tate would rai&s;e, it was to be for the benefit of the contributors; the project or bubble was to be called the <HI>Land Seurity and Oil Patent,</HI> and was repre&s;ented by the defendants to be a mo&s;t advantageous project without any hazard, there being landed &s;ecurity given for the benefit of the contributors.</P>
<P>The plaintiffs paid unto the defendant <HI>Arnold</HI> the &s;everal &s;ums of 120<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and 120<ABBR>l.</ABBR> for &s;ix &s;hares a-piece, for which <HI>Arnold</HI> gave them re|ceipts, and the projectors &s;old about 1000 tickets amounting to 20,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR></P>
<P>IN <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1720 the project failed, no oil having ever been made, or radi&s;hes &s;owed on the premi&s;es.</P>
<P>WHEREUPON the contributors, with &s;ome re&s;entment, called upon the projectors for their money, which occa&s;ioned the projectors to adverti&s;e, that in &s;ix months time, they would return the money with intere&s;t; but afterwards this was refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>INSISTED for the defendants, that the plaintiff being acquainted with this &s;ecurity as to the lands, they ought to re&s;ort thither; that there could be no impo&s;ition in this ca&s;e, becau&s;e the parties had no|tice; and the extracting oil out of radi&s;hes having had the &s;anction of a patent, could not be thought a cheat; and as to the adverti&s;e|ments, it was pretended they were gained by threatnings; and that the parties admitting they were aggrieved, had their remedy at law.</P>
<P><HI>Ma&s;ter of the Rolls:</HI> This is an impo&s;ition, to propo&s;e the &s;urplus of the value of an e&s;tate which co&s;t but 31,800<ABBR>l.</ABBR> after 85,000 charged upon it, which is much more than double the value) as a &s;ecurity to the contributors who laid out their money upon this project; it is giving them <HI>moon&s;hine</HI> in&s;tead of any <HI>thing real,</HI> and the proof is ve|ry &s;light, whereas it ought to have been extremely &s;trong; it is hard to believe, that any per&s;on would con&s;ent to be &s;o impo&s;ed upon And what makes it wor&s;e is, that this great &s;um of 57,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> is re&s;erved to the defendant the projector him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE gaining the patent can be no &s;anction to the cheat, becau&s;e the patent does not &s;ecure the patentee, if it is not a new invention, but others may u&s;e the &s;ame, or if it be not the fir&s;t patent, the pat|entee is not &s;ecure from an action; and patents of new inventions, as well as grants of other things, may be obtained by &s;urprize and fal&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions.</P>
<P>IF this were a fraud again&s;t any private or &s;ingle per&s;on, a court of equity would relieve; <HI>a fortiori,</HI> when it is a fraud again&s;t great numbers, again&s;t multitudes, where the mi&s;chief is more exten&s;ive, and many families thereby ruined.</P>
<P>IT is no objection, that the parties have their remedy at law, and may bring an action for monies had and received for the plaintiffs own u&s;e; for in ca&s;es of fraud, the court of equity has a concurrent juri&s;diction with the common law, matter of fraud being the great &s;ubject of relief here.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="033425_0103_0FF74C0C48C8FA48">
ACCORDINGLY ca&s;es of this nature have frequently met with relief in this court, as in <HI>Aaron Hill's</HI> ca&s;e, which was a patent for extract|ing oil out of beech, which was al&s;o divided into &s;hares, (as this is) and a &s;ecurity propo&s;ed and agreed to be made of lands, which came out to be <HI>terra incognita</HI> betwixt the degrees of latitude 50 and 57; and in the principal ca&s;e, the land, after the 85,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> paid, &s;eems to be worth as little as <HI>Aaron Hill's.</HI></P>
<P>AND as to the pretence of gaining the adverti&s;ements by force, the contributors were angry, and had rea&s;on to be &s;o, and one of the con|tributors (tho' it does not appear to have been either of the plaintiffs) threatened to cut the defendants throats; but this all ended in an arre&s;t of one of the defendants, which was a lawful proceeding, and after all the&s;e threatenings were over, the la&s;t adverti&s;ement was given out by the defendants on the 19th of <HI>September</HI> 1720.</P>
<P>FURTHER it is ju&s;t that the defendant <HI>Arnold,</HI> as well as the defen|dant <HI>Woolla&s;ton,</HI> &s;hould be charged; for as <HI>Woolla&s;ton</HI> was the fir&s;t projector and procurer of the patent, and purcha&s;er of the land, &s;o <HI>Arnold</HI> was his tru&s;tee, accepted the conveyance, was the trea&s;urer, received the money, and gave the receipts, was partner in the fraud, and plainly <HI>particeps criminis.</HI></P>
