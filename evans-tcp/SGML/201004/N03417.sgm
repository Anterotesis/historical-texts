<HEAD>A faithful NARRATIVE OF GOD's gracious Dealings WITH A Per&s;on lately recovered FROM THE <HI>Dangerous Errors of <HI>Arminius.</HI></HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>1 Cor. ii. 14.</HI></BIBL>
<P>But the natural Man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are fooli&s;hne&s;s unto him; neither can he know them, becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned</P>
<BIBL><HI>P&s;al. xciv. 12.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed is the Man whom thou cha&s;tene&s;t, O Lord, and teache&s;t him out of thy Law.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I Mu&s;t acknowledge, with grief of Soul, that by reading <HI>Arminian Books,</HI> and &s;ome of the Writings of &s;uch as are called Free-Thinkers, I came to be &s;o &s;tumbled at the <HI>Doctrine of Election,</HI> that I could not hear it preached without being very unea&s;y. Still I
<PB N="2" REF="004166_0002_1003F15E28CD4830">
read, and was mightily pleas'd in reading what &s;o much exalts Man, and nouri&s;hes the natural bent and bia&s;s we have to &s;et up Self, and a dreadful lothne&s;s to be at God's di&s;po&s;al: that it &s;hould be at his &s;overeign Will whether we &s;hould be converted and &s;aved, or left to pe|ri&s;h in our Sin and Unbelief; and that the Lord &s;hould give this as the Rea&s;on why he would have Mercy on &s;ome, and not on others; <HI>even becau&s;e it is his Will, and becau&s;e it &s;eemeth good in his Sight.</HI></P>
<P>About the &s;ame Time, I fell into the Com|pany of &s;ome Men of Wit and Learning, who&s;e Di&s;cour&s;e was much upon the &s;ame Strain. All &s;eem'd to agree in this, that our <HI>Doctrine</HI> of <HI>Election</HI> could not con&s;i&s;t with the Truth, Ju&s;tice, and Mercy of God.</P>
<P>Thus I was led on in the Way of <HI>free Will,</HI> as it &s;tands in oppo&s;ition to <HI>free Grace;</HI> quite be&s;ide and contrary to the way of Salvation. But my Con&s;cience would often check me for hankering after and li&s;tning to tho&s;e Doctrines; whil&s;t I was e'en bewitch'd away from the Truth as it is in Je&s;us, and carry'd further into plau&s;ible and plea&s;ing, but dangerous Errors; till it plea&s;|ed God (I hope in everla&s;ting Mercy to my Soul) to vi&s;it me with very great and &s;ore out|ward Afflictions, which brought on darkne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s of Mind and Con&s;cience, to a great Degree; and it &s;eem'd as if I had but a little
<PB N="3" REF="004166_0003_1003F307C85BE868">
while to live; &s;o I &s;pent almo&s;t whole Days alone, meditating Terror; and in the Night, &s;leep departed from mine Eyes.</P>
<P>In this doleful Condition, which I can't &s;et forth to the full, I remembred the mighty Con|victions I had been under in my youthful Time; and how, then I had pleaded God's free and e|verla&s;ting Love to the vile&s;t of Sinners; and how &s;weet the Doctrine of Election was then, and how relieving, whil&s;t I was con&s;trained to plead Guilty; and had Nothing, no not &s;o much as one good De&s;ire, that I could po&s;&s;ibly rai&s;e in my &s;elf, which might recommend me to the fa|vour of God.&mdash; I tho't I mu&s;t take the &s;ame Cour&s;e now, in hope that God had <HI>loved me</HI> with an <HI>everla&s;ting Love,</HI> and that therefore with <HI>loving Kindne&s;s he would draw me.</HI></P>
<P>But how did my Con&s;cience fly in my Face: &mdash; How &s;hould I think on that for my re|lief in my Di&s;tre&s;s, which I had &s;o quarrel'd a|gain&s;t? Then I cried to God to forgive me all my hard and murmuring Thoughts again&s;t the Doctrine of Election, and the Preachers of it. And when I had freely, and, I hope, humbly and penitently confe&s;&s;ed my &s;erpentine oppo&s;i|tion to the Truth; (for I believe it was from the &s;ubtil and venemous old Serpent) then I could find &s;ome relief in thinking of electing Love from all Eternity; and I was bro't to &s;ee, how that at fir&s;t, we had a &s;ufficient Stock in <HI>Adam</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="004166_0004_1003F2F3E87E1AA8">
(had we improv'd it) to &s;ecure our everla&s;ting Happine&s;s; but we fooli&s;hly and wilfully em|bezeled it away; and the <HI>fir&s;t Man,</HI> with his <HI>whole Race,</HI> had been <HI>irrecoverably lo&s;t;</HI> as the <HI>Angels</HI> who kept not their fir&s;t E&s;tate, are <HI>re&s;erv|ed in Chains to the Judgment of the great Day;</HI> had not God <HI>cho&s;en a Remnant in Chri&s;t, the &s;e|cond Adam:</HI> So that all our Hope, now, mu&s;t be in Chri&s;t, and in God's electing Love thro' him: who is plea&s;ed to &s;end the Spirit to bring home to the elect Soul the Father's everla&s;ting Love, and the Son's eternal Redemption by effectual Application.</P>
<P>Here I had relief; and on this Foundation I de&s;ire to build my Hope; which Hope, ca&s;t within the Vail, is a &s;ure Anchor. So I was brought to ble&s;s God for Election; had it not been for which, there would have been no more Hope for fallen Man than for fallen Angels.</P>
<P>After I had penned down the&s;e my Tempta|tions, I had great &s;truglings within, whether I &s;hould impart &s;uch Things to any one in the World. I had not, as yet, di&s;cover'd any thing, unle&s;s by dark and &s;hort hints, to a bo&s;om Friend. Sometimes I &s;hould think it be&s;t to conceal them; then it would run thus in my Mind; If you di&s;clo&s;e and make them known (without di&s;covering your &s;elf to the World) how know you but that &s;ome poor &s;tragling Sheep of Chri&s;t, lo&s;t in the Wilderne&s;s, and ready to be torn in
<PB N="5" REF="004166_0005_1003F1A3C7A1E350">
pieces by Wolves in Sheeps Cloathing, &s;hall be found out by the&s;e very Means, and brought home to Chri&s;t? Then what cau&s;e of Joy would there be! So I thought it might be a Sin in me not to make known what God had done for my Soul, and how narrowly I e&s;caped.</P>
<P>I know not how it may be with others; but as for poor me (one of the chief of Sinners and the lea&s;t of Believers: <HI>So fooli&s;h have I been, and ignorant!</HI> &mdash; O Fool that I am, and &s;low of Heart to believe) &mdash; I am now re&s;olved, God helping me, to lie at the foot of divine Sove|reignty, putting my Mouth in the Du&s;t, if &s;o be there may be Hope. And if Chri&s;t &s;hould, after all, reject me and ca&s;t me off for ever, he can do me no wrong. I am utterly lo&s;t in the <HI>fir&s;t Adam,</HI> who&s;e Sin is ju&s;tly imputed to me; and I have &s;o wretchedly oppos'd the <HI>&s;econd A|dam,</HI> who came to &s;eek &amp; &s;ave that which was lo&s;t, that I can't but know, if I peri&s;h, my Ruin will be of my &s;elf. <HI>O I&s;rael thou ha&s;t de&s;troyed thy &s;elf; but in me is thy Help.</HI></P>
<P>I have nothing to depend on but electing Love, redeeming Mercy, and renewing Grace; all infinitely free! And if any wicked Thoughts ari&s;e, at any time, in my fooli&s;h, blind and per|ver&s;e Heart, contrary to what I here declare and profe&s;s, I mu&s;t ca&s;t them away with abhor|rence. And whatever become of me, its a plea|ing thought to me, that Others may take warn|ing,
<PB N="6" REF="004166_0006_1003F19C42E8EF20">
and Mini&s;ters may be embolden'd to preach up the Doctrine of free &s;overeign Grace, in every Branch of it, and not &s;pare.</P>
<P>But to go on; I was, as I &s;aid, brought to &s;ubmit to the righteous Sovereignty of the Lord, who&s;e Name is Holy. And in pleading God's everla&s;ting Love, I &s;eem'd to have fre&s;h expe|rience of the Love of Chri&s;t; and the Lord &s;eem'd to &s;mile on me in his Providence, in the mid&s;t of frowning Di&s;pen&s;ations &mdash; I could give particular In&s;tances of it; but I forbear.&mdash;</P>
<P>Now, in the multitude of my Thoughts, it came into my Mind to <HI>renew my Covenant with God;</HI> and I did it in a &s;olemn Manner, and as compo&s;edly as could be, under &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and almo&s;t di&s;tracting Trouble: Outward and inward Sorrows, like two Seas, meeting toge|ther.&mdash; And it was my purpo&s;e to renew my Covenant every Day; &s;till pleading for Mercy, free Mercy to the very chief of Sinners; giving thanks to the Lord, that yet there &s;hould be a remnant according to the Election of Grace. Lord! thou ha&s;t <HI>cho&s;en &s;ome to Salvation, through &s;anctification of the Spirit, and belief of the Truth:</HI> and I know not but I am one of them. &mdash;The Offers of Grace are without Exception. <HI>This is a faithful &s;aying, and worthy of all ac|ceptation, that Chri&s;t Je&s;us came into the World to &s;ave Sinners, of whom I am chief.</HI> I &s;aw plainly that by all that I had done or could do, I
<PB N="7" REF="004166_0007_1003F30AD265A7E0">
could not de&s;erve &s;o much as a crumb of Bread, or a drop of Water. I &s;aw, at the &s;ame Time, that there was enough in Chri&s;t to ju&s;tify, &s;anctify, and &s;ave eternally, the wor&s;t Sinner in the World: and I de&s;ire to have my entire dependance on Him &s;till, daily renewing my Covenant; that I may maintain a clo&s;e Walk with God, and be fortifyed again&s;t new Temp|tations.</P>
<P>About this Time, I went into a Stationer's Shop, as I u&s;ed frequently to do; and there I e&s;py'd &s;ome of the <HI>Arminian Books;</HI> &s;uch as I had read but too much in; and the Book|&s;eller told me, of what e&s;teem they were in <HI>England.</HI>&mdash; But they appeared to me as a fiery Serpent, by which I had been mortally &s;tung; and had I not looked to Chri&s;t, as the I&s;raelites did to the brazen Serpent, my Soul mu&s;t have died of the Wound.</P>
<P>And I &s;uppo&s;e this to be one Rea&s;on why Election &s;eems &s;o &s;weet to me now, and is con|tinually running in my Mind; even becau&s;e of my bla&s;phemous quarrelling in the Day of Temptation. Like the proud <HI>Legali&s;ts,</HI> who, while <HI>Paul</HI> was preaching Chri&s;t and free Grace, are &s;aid to <HI>&s;peak again&s;t tho&s;e Things, contra|dicting and bla&s;pheming:</HI> But the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> were &s;o far from giving over when they were thus oppo&s;ed, that it is &s;aid in the next Ver&s;e, <HI>They waxed bold</HI> &amp;c. and then it follows; <HI>As
<PB N="8" REF="004166_0008_1003F2FA73A86938" MS="y">
many as were ordained to eternal Life, believed.</HI>&mdash; Thus my falling out with that &s;weet Doctrine, has renewed and increa&s;ed my Love to it:&mdash; And I mu&s;t again expre&s;s my humble De&s;ire and Wi&s;h, that Mini&s;ters might be moved, &mdash; But I forbear.&mdash; I have oppo&s;ed and &s;lighted them in the cloudy and dark Day of Temptation, and am not worthy to &s;peak to them: &mdash;Yet may I &s;peak to God for them, and de&s;ire their Prayers, and the Prayers of all the Lord's cho&s;en and called,&mdash; who may come to know my Ca&s;e, &s;till continuing gloomy; neither &s;o dark as it has been, nor &s;o light as I hope in God's Time it may be.</P>
