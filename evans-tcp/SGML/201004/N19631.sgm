<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><P>Who hath believed our report?</P>
<BIBL><HI>I&s;aiah 63 and 1.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS is a part of a remarkably full and clear prophecy of the Me&s;&s;iah. The &s;acred hi&s;torians &s;carcely write on his incarnation, life, &s;ufferings and death, with greater per&s;picuity and preci&s;ion, than the evangelic prophet. The&s;e beautifully plaintive words are quoted by the evangeli&s;t John, and the apo&s;tle Paul, who inform us they were originally addre&s;&s;ed to God, and had immediate reference to Chri&s;t's rejection by the Jewi&s;h nation. By this report, or <HI>doctrine,</HI> as the marginal reading is, taken in a large &s;en&s;e, may be de&s;igned the in&s;pired writings in general, or the whole &s;ubject of the go&s;pel mini&s;try; but in the &s;trict accep|tation, it relates immediately to the &s;cheme of &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and calls our particular attention to his incarnation, &s;ufferings and death. The truth and excel|lency of natural religion, have rarely been called in que&s;tion, but who has believed the report in contem|plation? This &s;ome <HI>reject,</HI> and others &s;till le&s;s ingenuous, <HI>wre&s;t</HI> to their own de&s;truction. The preaching of the cro&s;s, or the &s;ublime, yet unpopular doctrine of the bible, is to them that peri&s;h, fooli&s;hne&s;s; but to us who are &s;aved, it is, in&s;trumentally, the power of God. Our text implies, that God has &s;ome faithful mini&s;ters among men, who call on his name, and are concerned for his glory, to whom he has committed a report, or &s;y&s;tem of doctrines, &s;ufficiently authenticated, which they plainly, fully, and con&s;i&s;tently declare; and which tho&s;e to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed are bound to believe, according to the nature and degree of evidence pro|duced; but that, from &s;ome cau&s;e, they are lamentably incredulous. The&s;e propo&s;itions compo&s;e a foundation, on which might be &s;hewn the characteri&s;tics of go&s;pel mini&s;ters, the contents of their report, the evidence of its authenticity, the motives inducing a declaration of the whole divine coun&s;el, the nature, kind, degrees,
<PB N="4" REF="025616_0004_0FCE9C8A90E2AD78">
grounds, u&s;e, objects of, and obligations to faith; to|gether with the cau&s;es and con&s;equences of unbelief: But your time on the pre&s;ent intere&s;ting occa&s;ion will not admit, and my feeble talents are very unequal for the con&s;ideration of the&s;e important things at large. I &s;hall only attempt, as the Lord may a&s;&s;i&s;t,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> A brief recital and illu&s;tration of the leading doctrines of our faith, reported in the go&s;pel.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To &s;hew of whom, and the grounds on which, faith is required in our go&s;pel report, con&s;idered as it re&s;pects the whole of divine revelation. And</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to an&s;wer a few of the mo&s;t plau&s;ible and popular objections again&s;t this &s;cheme.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I am to attempt a brief recital and illu&s;tration of the leading doctrines of our faith as reported in the go&s;pel. The very foundation of revealed religion, which &s;tands with di&s;tingui&s;hed glory and lu&s;tre, is the &s;acred and my&s;terious doctrine of the ble&s;&s;ed Trinity. This,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, demands our mo&s;t &s;erious and devout attention. That there is a God, is as evident as that there is an univer&s;e. Deity is in&s;cribed in glaring and indelible cha|racters on every object. And that there is, and can be but one God, is al&s;o evinced by rea&s;on. But for the knowledge of three di&s;tinct per&s;ons in the indivi&s;ible God Head, we are wholy indebted to revelation. This is confe&s;&s;edly a great my&s;tery. But how can it be other|wi&s;e, as it re&s;pects the mode of the incomprehen&s;ible Jehovah's exi&s;tence? With &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, I conceive all endeavours to elucidate it (to &s;ay the lea&s;t) are unnece&s;|&s;ary. One ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, "That rea&s;on never &s;hews it&s;elf more rea&s;onable, than when it cea&s;es to rea&s;on about things above rea&s;on." This peculiarly ab&s;tru&s;e point, upon God's authority, demands our unre&s;erved faith, with the mo&s;t profound adoration and awe. It was &s;tated and maintained with an energy and evidence divinely glorious at Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m, and is forcibly inculcated every time that &s;acred ordinance is admini&s;|tered. Simon Magus held, that the Father, Son, and
<PB N="5" REF="025616_0005_0FCE9C8C1F494ED0">
Spirit, are only characters of one per&s;on con&s;idered in different points of view, or according to his different manner of operation. But the admi&s;&s;ion of this idea would render all the &s;criptures that relate to the im|portant &s;ubject, unintelligible and ab&s;urd. The Three that bare record in Heaven, and whom we wor&s;hip as the one eternal God, are <HI>per&s;ons,</HI> to whom all the attributes of Deity are indi&s;criminately applicable. This glorious peculiarity of revealed religion, is denied, oppo&s;ed and rediculed by Arians, Socinians, and Dei&s;ts, of every de&s;cription. 'Tis what the&s;e <HI>rationali&s;ts,</HI> as they are fond to be called, with all their erudition and &s;agacity cannot apprehend, and their prepo&s;terous con|clu&s;ion is, therefore it is fal&s;e and ab&s;urd. But the&s;e black epithets, upon the &s;ame principle, may be be|&s;towed upon many of the mo&s;t &s;tubborn facts. When our learned opponents explain the union betwixt their own bodies and minds, and &s;hew how any being can exi&s;t without a cau&s;e, or be the cau&s;e of its own ex|i&s;tence, we &s;hall pay an implicit deference to their other logical deci&s;ions. But at pre&s;ent, we deem it highly rational to believe the account God has plainly given of him&s;elf, however incomprehen&s;ible by us. His know|ledge, al&s;o, is too wonderful for us; yet we mu&s;t believe and confe&s;s,</P>
<P>Secondly, That his under&s;tanding is infinite. The &s;ublime doctrine of divine fore-knowledge, is no incon|&s;iderable part of our invaluable report. The ancient veterans of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in the cau&s;e of God and truth, u&s;ed it with happy and never-failing &s;ucce&s;s, in over|throwing all &s;y&s;tems that taught, or implied contingen|cies, as applied to God. Their mo&s;t acute and powerful adver&s;aries could neither evade nor with&s;tand the force of arguments properly drawn from this &s;ource: And all advocates for the invincible &s;y&s;tem of eternal truth, may ever avail them&s;elves of this re&s;i&s;tle&s;s and divine weapon. Some have the daring effrontery to deny God's fore knowledge of the free volitions of moral agents, which, in my judgment (one attribute
<PB N="6" REF="025616_0006_0FCE9C8D9A3580D0">
of Deity being as perfect as another) is the &s;ame in effect, as to deny his being infinitely ju&s;t. But from the highe&s;t authority, we know that his wi&s;dom is illimitted. "He looks to the ends of the earth, and &s;ees under the whole Heaven." And the &s;ame in|finite di&s;cernment that penetrates the mo&s;t &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of immen&s;ity <HI>now,</HI> intimately pervades all the dark intricacies of <HI>futurity.</HI> "His eyes are in every place, beholding the evil and the good;" and both good and evil, as they originate in, and proceed from the heart. "He fills Heaven and earth, and knows the thoughts of the mind afar off." Not only the pre|&s;ent but the mo&s;t remote thought. "Hell and de&s;truc|tion are," and were from eternity, "naked before him: How much more the hearts," and all the free volitions, "of the children of men?" There can be nothing concealed in the mo&s;t di&s;tant and darke&s;t gloom, from the only wi&s;e God, with whom the light dwells. The&s;e, and many other &s;imilar a&s;&s;ertions, with which the &s;criptures abound, have all been demon&s;trated by his fore-telling, particularly, at the di&s;tance of ages, a multitude of deep and intricate events, depending for their exi&s;tence, on the free volitions of moral agents. And if God's knowledge of that which to us is future, is perfect; and who can &s;ay it is not, all the objects of it, or events fore&s;een, mu&s;t be from &s;ome cau&s;e ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary. That which to us is pa&s;t, and cannot be otherwi&s;e, can be no more certain as it re&s;pects God, than all that is yet to come. With him, the <HI>future</HI> is as the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> and the <HI>pa&s;t.</HI> Well might an adoring apo&s;tle exclaim, O the depth of the riches of the know|ledge of God! It is true, fore-knowledge has no influence on its &s;ubjects; yet all mu&s;t grant, that their exi&s;tence, by <HI>&s;ome means,</HI> is made as certain and inevit|able, as the knowledge that comprehends them, is clear and infallible. No mathematical axiom can be more &s;elf-evident, than that <HI>certain</HI> fore-knowledge has an indi&s;&s;oluble connection with that which is <HI>certainly</HI> fore-known. He who will not allow this, can deny, that
<PB N="7" REF="025616_0007_0FCE9C8F0ED54D60">
"Things equal to one and the &s;ame thing, are equal to one another." With the &s;ame variety and &s;trength of evidence, the divine oracles declare,</P>
<P>Thirdly, The exi&s;tence of an eternal, determinate and <HI>untru&s;trable coun&s;el,</HI> the evolution of which will not be effected by le&s;s than the con&s;ummation of all things; nor prior to that period. God's &s;overeign and eternal will, being infinitely free to form his wonderful plan of operations, by effecting and permitting, as &s;eemed good in his own &s;ight; this is properly and emphatically called, "THE COUNSEL OF HIS OWN WILL." "A decree is declared: The decree of the Mo&s;t High, which &s;hall not pa&s;s."</P>
<P>And what can be more rationally &s;uppo&s;ed, than that God would not begin to act without propo&s;ing a deter|minate and important end? And to devi&s;e and &s;ecure all the means leading <HI>to,</HI> and in&s;eparably connected <HI>with</HI> its accompli&s;hment, was equally eligible and nece&s;&s;ary. God's ultimate end in all his works, of nature, provi|dence and grace, was neither the happine&s;s nor mi&s;ery of any, or all his creatures, but his own declarative glory. "He made all things for him&s;elf." And this important truth extending its influence to all parts of the divine &s;y&s;tem with which it is connected, merits the &s;tricte&s;t attention; many &s;criptures and di&s;pen&s;ations being inexplicable without the reflection of its rays. Though there is no di&s;tinction betwixt the pre&s;cience and coun&s;el of God, as immanent acts of the divine mind, in order of <HI>time,</HI> both being eternal, yet <HI>this</HI> was <HI>prior</HI> to <HI>that</HI> in order of <HI>nature.</HI> God did not fore&s;ee the events of time, and their final i&s;&s;ue, falling out <HI>for|tuitou&s;ly</HI> as <HI>&s;ome:</HI> or by an unde&s;igning <HI>fatality,</HI> as <HI>others</HI> &s;uppo&s;e, and decree accordingly; but with &s;overeign freedom and infinite &s;kill, he drew his inimitable plan; and as the effect of his righteous and immutable decrees, fore&s;aw its happy and exact execution. The admirable chain of providence re&s;pecting man, has been let down for enough to di&s;cover a de&s;ign, too grand and con&s;i&s;tent to be dependent on the giddy and cla&s;hing volitions of
<PB N="8" REF="025616_0008_0FCE9C9093A845B8">
&s;hort-&s;ighted mortals. Had they been all left to their &s;inful propen&s;ities, expo&s;ed to the violence of their own ba&s;e and turbulent pa&s;&s;ions; without re&s;traint, or quickening and directing influence from on high, the inevitable re&s;ult mu&s;t have been, their univer&s;al de|&s;truction.</P>
<P>Blind <HI>chance</HI> is as incompetent to the government of the <HI>moral,</HI> as it would have been to the formation of the <HI>natural</HI> world. God's providence is univer&s;al and par|ticular. To an&s;wer his wi&s;e and holy purpo&s;es, he <HI>effects</HI> the good which exi&s;ts, <HI>permits</HI> the evil, and <HI>re|&s;trains</HI> the re&s;t. And as the mo&s;t minute incident may have an a&s;toni&s;hing influence on a long &s;eries of intere&s;|ting di&s;pen&s;ations, <HI>all things</HI> were made the &s;ubject of divine determination. There is an indi&s;&s;oluble conca|tination betwixt things more di&s;tant and di&s;proportioned, than the extremes of time; or the fall of a &s;parrow and the revolution of a kingdom. "The very hairs of our heads are numbered." Tho&s;e who grant this, are prepared,</P>
<P>Fourthly, To contemplate, with awful and delight|ful reverence, the &s;tupendous di&s;plays of God's &s;ove|reign, electing and eternal love. This incomprehen|&s;ible love, is the mo&s;t intere&s;ting animating, and delightful theme, that ever exerci&s;ed a created mind. Love is an e&s;&s;ential attribute of the divine nature. "God is love." His love, like him&s;elf, is without beginning or end. He has loved all the objects of his pre&s;ent favor, with an everla&s;ting love. He is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works. But his love to his redeemed is &s;pecial, without the lea&s;t imaginable injury to the re&s;t of his creatures. It is with re&s;pect to this &s;pecial love, that tho&s;e who are not the objects of it, are repre&s;ented in holy writ, as com|paratively hated, without the con&s;ideration of their having done either good or evil.</P>
<P>But even <HI>the&s;e</HI> have great rea&s;on to be thankful; and are highly culpable in having an evil eye, a murmuring heart, or a caviling tongue, becau&s;e their bountiful
<PB N="9" REF="025616_0009_0FCE9C92409D6CC8">
benefactor is tran&s;cendantly good to others. Let the creature who has not received as much as it de&s;erves, demand a recompence of God. But if he is indebted to none, let him without cen&s;ure, do what he will with his own. When he was plea&s;ed to &s;et up Chri&s;t in the office of mediator, as head of all principalities and powers, who had a right to be di&s;&s;atisfied at being left to occupy an inferior &s;phere? God's &s;etting up his only begotten &s;on from everla&s;ting, could do no &s;hadow of injury to any, while it was infinitely advantageous to innumerable millions. For he was cho&s;en as a head, and with reference to a body, which was accordingly cho&s;en in him, irre&s;pective of works of righteou&s;ne&s;s, from eternity. And who among the non elect, God having dealt bountifully with them, could &s;ay that they were wronged in not being made to &s;hare the &s;till richer communications of his exuberant goodne&s;s, and the manife&s;tations of his &s;pecial love. Were complaints, on the &s;core of an unequal di&s;tribution of the divine bounty ju&s;t, there would be matter of univer&s;al murmuring. Every &s;pecies of inferior creatures might repine, be|cau&s;e they are not a &s;uperior link in the chain of <HI>being,</HI> from the meane&s;t animalcule, to the flaming <HI>&s;eraph; who,</HI> likewi&s;e, di&s;&s;atisfied with finite powers, might a&s;pire at deity.</P>
<P>But the ingratitude, pride, and rebellious ambition, that prompt to &s;uch daring impiety, and a conduct &s;o dreadfully perilous, mu&s;t ever furni&s;h &s;ad monuments of &s;ignal vengeance. The order of the vi&s;ible and ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;ubordination which exi&s;ts among the creatures, &s;hall never be violated. God's choo&s;ing a certain and definite number from among men <HI>in,</HI> and giving them as a portion, and charge <HI>to</HI> Chri&s;t, as their glorious head and repre&s;entative, rendered the condition of others, by no means wor&s;e than the law of their creation had made it. God was under no obligation to elect any man, or election was of debt contrary to &s;cripture; and con&s;equently he had an indi&s;putable right to pa&s;s over whom he plea&s;ed. The fulfilling of no future
<PB N="10" REF="025616_0010_0FCE9C96AE015FD0" MS="y">
conditions by the creatures, induced God's choice; nor were <HI>characters,</HI> but <HI>per&s;ons,</HI> the objects of it. Men are not elected becau&s;e converted; but converted be|cau&s;e elected. Faith and obedience are not cau&s;es, or conditions, but fruits and evidences of election. The elect being loved with an everla&s;ting love, they are drawn with loving kindne&s;s. They were cho&s;en to holine&s;s, as well <HI>as,</HI> and in order <HI>to</HI> happine&s;s. They were cho&s;en to &s;alvation through &s;anctification of the &s;pirit, and belief of the truth. "Ble&s;&s;ed be the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t," &s;ays the &s;eraphic Paul, "who hath ble&s;&s;ed us with all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings in heavenly places in Chri&s;t, according as he hath cho&s;en us in him, before the foundation of the world, that we &s;hould be holy and without blame before him in love. He hath &s;aved us and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpo&s;e and grace, which was given us in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, before the world began." And whom he thus fore-knew, we are to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>Fifthly, "He al&s;o did <HI>prede&s;tinate</HI> to the adoption of &s;ons. The elect are "Prede&s;tinated to the adoption of children by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in whom they have obtained an inheritance, being prede&s;tinated according to the purpo&s;e of him who worketh all things according to the coun&s;el of his own will." Men are not ordained to eternal life becau&s;e they <HI>believe;</HI> but as many as are <HI>ordained,</HI> or <HI>prede&s;tinated</HI> to eternal life, <HI>believe.</HI> Pre|de&s;tination, taken in its large&s;t &s;en&s;e, has all creatures and events for its objects in a certain &s;en&s;e; but that branch of it which re&s;pects the elect, is well defined by the 39^t^h article of the Engli&s;h national church, in the following words: "Prede&s;tination to life is the everla&s;ting purpo&s;e of God, whereby, before the foun|dations of the world were laid, he hath con&s;tantly de|creed, by his coun&s;el, &s;ecret to us, to deliver from cur&s;e and damnation, tho&s;e whom he hath cho&s;en in Chri&s;t out of mankind, and to bring them by Chri&s;t to everla&s;ting &s;alvation, as ve&s;&s;els made to honor." After
<PB N="11" REF="025616_0011_0FCE9C981910B7B0">
the&s;e authorities, it would be &s;uperfluous to add any thing more on this head. As election &s;uppo&s;es refu&s;ing, or pa&s;&s;ing by &s;ome; &s;o prede&s;tination to life, as <HI>&s;ome</HI> are finally lo&s;t, leads us</P>
<P>Sixthly, To con&s;ider the particular decree that re&s;|pects <HI>them.</HI> "If our go&s;pel be hid," &s;ays St Paul, it is hid to them that are lo&s;t." And we learn by St. Peter, that there are &s;ome, "Who &s;tumble at the word, being di&s;obedient, whereunto al&s;o they were appointed." The&s;e are they "Who&s;e names were not within the book of life from the foundation of the world." The decree which ju&s;tly appointed them to wrath is called reprobation. We read of &s;ome &s;tiled <HI>reprobate</HI> &s;ilver, and of others, who concerning good works were <HI>reprobate.</HI> The word in both the&s;e places &s;ignifies adulterated, or counterfeit. In this &s;en&s;e, God never reprobated any man. Men have reprobated and ruined them&s;elves. Though eternal life is God's gift, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, without re&s;pect to any merit in the heirs of it; eternal death is the ju&s;t wages of &s;in. God never puni&s;hes any man unle&s;s he de&s;erves it; and then only in exact proportion to his demerit. Man has no one to blame for his reprobation and de&s;truction, but him&s;elf. Reprobation, as it is God's act, does indeed &s;ignify, abandoning to eternal mi&s;ery; but it is for infinite and voluntary offences again&s;t his royal law and authority. All men act with the natural liberty of the will, and are worthy of prai&s;e and blame, gracious reward, and righteous puni&s;hment according to their works. "What&s;oever a man &s;ows, that &s;hall he al&s;o reap." Some divide reprobation into preterition and predamnation. Preterition found and left the non-elect like the re&s;t of the human race, doing them neither good nor harm; and predamnation was their righteous ap|pointment unto wrath, for their fore&s;een wickedne&s;s. A creature is never &s;ent to hell, the bedlam of the univer&s;e, <HI>as a creature,</HI> or while it is fit for any other place. Damnation is of the &s;inner. All the damned are ve&s;&s;els of wrath, fitted by their God provoking &s;ins,
<PB N="12" REF="025616_0012_0FCE9C9C4122C198">
for de&s;truction. The&s;e are the ungodly men, who, <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> were before of old, ordained to this condemnation. And it was undeniably as ju&s;t, upon perfect fore&s;ight of their &s;ins, to <HI>predetermine,</HI> as it is actually to <HI>inflict</HI> their damnation. "I cannot think," &s;ays that emi|nently great and good man, pre&s;ident Davies, "that the events of time, or the judicial proce&s;s of the la&s;t day, will furni&s;h God with any new intelligence to enable him to determine the final &s;tates of men more ju&s;tly than he could from eternity." The non elect were left to enjoy common gifts, ble&s;&s;ings and privi|ledges, in a providential way; but eventually to peri&s;h in and for their &s;ins. From this awful truth, permit me to call your attention,</P>
<P>Seventhly, To the covenant of redemption. The ble&s;|&s;ings of the elect were &s;ecured by covenant. God made a covenant with his cho&s;en, ordered in all things and &s;ure. It was between the eternal Three, in behalf of the elect: Provi&s;ion was made in this eternal contract to effect their recovery from the dire effects of the fall, in a way that would manife&s;t, magnify, and do infinite honor to every divine perfection. The righteous law of God was viewed as &s;hamefully violated, and divine ju&s;tice, as thereby infinitely injured. Men were viewed as depraved, guilty, helple&s;s and condemned creatures, without the lea&s;t inclination or ability to &s;atisfy for their offences or to return to God. Now God could not deny him&s;elf. He would by no means, as law|giver and judge, acquit the guilty. He would not agree for grace to reign but through righteou&s;ne&s;s; or to ju&s;tify the ungodly, unle&s;s he could do it ju&s;tly; ju&s;|tice being e&s;&s;ential to the divine character.</P>
<P>And though he might have exacted &s;atisfaction of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> bankrupts them&s;elves, he not only <HI>admitted,</HI> but exerci&s;ed his wi&s;dom goodne&s;s and mercy in <HI>providing</HI> a &s;urety in the per&s;on of his own Son. The Father was to prepare him a true body and a rational &s;oul, through the agency of the Holy Spirit, of the nature of man the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, which in the fulne&s;s of time,
<PB N="13" REF="025616_0013_0FCE9C9D80B584C0">
he was to take into an in&s;eparable union with the divine nature, as it exi&s;ted in his per&s;on, that he might be a &s;uitable mediator between God and man. In this ca|pacity he &s;tipulated to magnify and make honorable the law, by a per&s;onal obedience adequate to all its exten|&s;ive requi&s;itions; and to &s;atisfy the utmo&s;t demands of ju&s;tice, by the &s;acrifice of his &s;oul and body in the room and &s;tead of his people, who&s;e tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions were all accordingly imputed to, or laid upon him. He then, as their covenant-head, received in their behalf, all the great and precious promi&s;es which enrich and adorn the in&s;pired volume; together with all gifts, graces and heavenly ble&s;&s;ings that were to be confer|red upon, and applied to the whole church, by the divine &s;pirit. And the &s;acred compact was ratified by oaths, promi&s;es and blood. By this eternal contract the travel of Chri&s;t's &s;oul was &s;ecured: Hence, "He &s;hall &s;ee his &s;eed, and the plea&s;ure of the Lord &s;hall pro&s;per in his hand." Of the accompli&s;hment of this, there can be no rea&s;onable doubt, when it is con&s;idered.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, That redemption by Chri&s;t, as it re&s;pects the &s;atisfaction of ju&s;tice, is fini&s;hed and compleat. All who were cho&s;en in, and given to him, he covenanted in behalf <HI>of,</HI> and obeyed, &s;uffered and died <HI>for,</HI> to put an end to their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and bring in for them an everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s. For the&s;e <HI>many,</HI> for this <HI>all,</HI> he gave his life a ran&s;om. This is the church he pur|cha&s;ed with his blood. And for <HI>the&s;e,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed from the world, he intercedes. <HI>The&s;e</HI> are the ran&s;omed of the Lord, who &s;hall return to Zion with &s;ongs and ever|la&s;ting joy. <HI>The&s;e</HI> are redeemed from <HI>among</HI> men, <HI>out of</HI> every tongue and kindred and people; and, as a con&s;equence, wa&s;hed in the blood of the Lamb. Chri&s;t will accompli&s;h his whole undertaking. It never &s;hall be truly &s;aid of him, "He began to build, but was not able to fini&s;h." If he undertook, <HI>ab&s;olutely,</HI> to &s;ave the whole human race, there is nothing but change of mind, or want of power, neither of which can be a&s;cribed to him, that can hinder an univer&s;al &s;alvation;
<PB N="14" REF="025616_0014_0FCE9C9ECAABA0E0">
which does not, however, appear to be the doctrine contained in the oracles of God. If he &s;atisfied <HI>uncon|ditionally</HI> for <HI>all</HI> the &s;ins of <HI>all</HI> men, not a <HI>&s;oul</HI> in ju&s;tice can be damned. But if he only &s;atisfied for <HI>part</HI> of the &s;ins of all men, however <HI>con&s;iderable</HI> a part that might be, they will have to an&s;wer for the <HI>other part,</HI> and there being an infinite evil in the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> &s;in, not a &s;oul can be &s;aved. If Chri&s;t did not &s;atisfy for <HI>unbelief,</HI> as well as other &s;ins, all unbelievers mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be lo&s;t, nothing having the efficacy to clean&s;e from &s;in, but his invaluable blood.</P>
<P>From which it evidently appears, that either Chri&s;t did not &s;atisfy for their &s;ins who are finally lo&s;t, or that men may peri&s;h everla&s;tingly for the <HI>very</HI> tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions to which he put an end by the vicarious &s;acrifice of him|&s;elf. And if this is a po&s;&s;ible ca&s;e, I beg leave to a&s;k, what <HI>be&s;ides</HI> the death of Chri&s;t, is <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> to keep a &s;oul from condemnation. If the merits of Chri&s;t alone are not &s;ufficient to re&s;t upon for &s;alvation, what in addition to them <HI>is,</HI> &s;hould doubtle&s;s be preci&s;ely a&s;cer|tained. It is &s;aid, that he undertook to &s;ave men <HI>con|ditionally;</HI> but if he only undertook to &s;ave tho&s;e who are finally lo&s;t upon <HI>conditions</HI> which he knew would eventually <HI>never</HI> be fulfilled, he in fact never de&s;igned their &s;alvation <HI>at all</HI> and con&s;equently did not die, nor intercede for them. His life was infinitely too dear to lay down at uncertainties; much le&s;s for the &s;alvation of tho&s;e whom he knew would be <HI>finally lo&s;t;</HI> and lea&s;t of all for tho&s;e who <HI>were</HI> lo&s;t already when he died. It appears that he obeyed, &s;uffered and died for the elect only, who are called accordingly, by invincible grace, out of darkne&s;s into light, ju&s;tified by his righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed to them, &s;anctified by his grace implanted in them, and kept by divine power, through faith unto &s;alvation. Admoni&s;hed by my a&s;&s;igned limits, I pro|ceed,</P>
<P>Secondly. To &s;hew <HI>of whom,</HI> and the grounds on <HI>which</HI> faith is required in our report, con&s;idered as it re&s;pects the whole of divine revelation.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="025616_0015_0FCE9CA044E3F400">Fir&s;t, I am to &s;hew of whom this faith is required. It will doubtle&s;s be attended with little difficulty to prove, if a <HI>negative</HI> may be admitted, that faith is never required without information and te&s;timony. All agree that a revelation is not made to many who are lo&s;t; and yet &s;ome &s;ay that no man is condemned but for <HI>unbelief.</HI> But how can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a per&s;on who never heard, or obtained knowledge of our report, by any means, can be concerned with it as an object of faith? That <HI>faith</HI> through the powerful influence of the Holy Spirit may virtually, or e&s;&s;entially exi&s;t, without the u&s;e of external means, and &s;o produce the &s;alvation of the &s;ubjects of it, is readily allowed; but that even <HI>this</HI> is required without being <HI>produced,</HI> much le&s;s the <HI>exerci&s;e</HI> of it, mu&s;t be denied. A man can be under no obligation to <HI>believe,</HI> without a <HI>revelation:</HI> An angel in Heaven is incapable of this. For faith comes by hear|ing, and hearing by the word of God, in the manner effects are produced by their cau&s;e. Objects may exi&s;t without any connection with, or relation to <HI>faith;</HI> but faith cannot exi&s;t without reference to an <HI>object,</HI> real or under&s;tood, and an object <HI>revealed.</HI> Facts mu&s;t really or po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t, to become objects of faith; then they mu&s;t be revealed, and the revelation requires, and can only produce a faith according to its own nature. Faith never puts its object into exi&s;tence, as &s;ome have ab&s;urdly repre&s;ented, and facts are true whether they are be|lieved or not. Some <HI>confe&s;s,</HI> that an hi&s;torical faith without information, or a &s;aving faith, with a merely external revelation, is more than man can produce; but they argue that his ability in his pre&s;ent &s;tate, is not the &s;tandard of his duty, and that God ju&s;tly requires that of him now, which, through his own voluntarly contracted depravity, he cannot perform.</P>
<P>But though, in a <HI>qualified</HI> &s;en&s;e, we grant this, it will not follow, that God will require any thing inequit|able or unrea&s;onable of his creatures, as that unque&s;|tionably would be, for which he never gave them a capacity. And it is evident, that man in his primoeval
<PB N="16" REF="025616_0016_0FCE9CA8805D2F78">
&s;tate, had no power to believe without a revelation. And how can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, I &s;peak with reverence, according to our ideas of ju&s;tice, that that can be ju&s;tly required of man, to which his nature and powers in their highe&s;t perfection were inadequate? What God calls us to perform, is but our rea&s;onable &s;ervice. And yet it mu&s;t be owned, that duties are required of us, for which we have not, at pre&s;ent, a <HI>moral</HI> ability. It would be impious in the highe&s;t degree, for us to deny that it is our indi&s;pen&s;able duty, to love the Lord our God, with all our hearts, minds and &s;trength, and our neighbours as our&s;elves; and it would be equally fal&s;e and ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that we have a moral power to di&s;|charge this important obligation in our depraved &s;tate. But as we were originally &s;ufficient for the&s;e things, and have no one to blame but our&s;elves, that we did not <HI>continue</HI> &s;o, we are without excu&s;e in not living in the con&s;tant habit and exerci&s;e of them. We mu&s;t own, that all the duties required of our common parents, when recent from their Maker's hands, by the <HI>moral</HI> law, may be demanded, with equal ju&s;tice, of their po&s;terity; but they are under no <HI>further</HI> obligations until they have a revelation from heaven. The obe|dience which our parents owed the moral law <HI>prior</HI> to the fall, was without controver&s;y, due <HI>then</HI> from their po&s;terity, who &s;eminally and repre&s;entatively ex|i&s;ted in them; and the law being as unalterable as the divine perfections of which it is a tran&s;cript, the very &s;ame obedience mu&s;t be as ju&s;tly due <HI>&s;inc</HI> the fall. The guilty lo&s;s of our moral power to obey, by no means &s;lackened our obligations to obedience. The divine law, founded in eternal equity, and the various relations &s;u&s;tained by all intelligent creatures to God and each other, form the univer&s;al, perpetual, and unalterable criterion of vice and virtue. "By the law is the knowledge of &s;in." If the law might have been &s;atis|fied with the be&s;t obedience of which fallen men are capable, Chri&s;t need not have come to magnify and make it honorable. For it is evident that in the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="17" REF="025616_0017_0FCE9CAD93592000">
which has the approbation of the law, a man may be ju&s;tified before God. The &s;criptures and facts too, declare our guilt of the fir&s;t man's offence. And the lo&s;s of our original righteou&s;ne&s;s ab&s;tractedly con|&s;idered, being our common &s;in, or &s;in of our nature, cannot be admitted as an <HI>excu&s;e,</HI> but is rather an <HI>aggra|vation</HI> of our want of conformity unto, and tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion of the divine law. A man's voluntary intoxication, e&s;pecially when he is apprized and warned of its effects, furni&s;hes him with no admi&s;&s;ible apology for any con&s;e|quential mi&s;demeanor. But as it did not become the duty of Adam to believe in the Me&s;&s;iah, until he was revealed unto him, and <HI>then</HI> only according to the man|ner <HI>in which</HI> he was revealed, &s;o his &s;ons can be under no obligation to believe either in the written, or <HI>e&s;&s;en|tial</HI> word, without a revalation.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e who are favored with a revelation, are bound to a corre&s;pondent faith. The&s;e are the per&s;ons of whom faith in our report are required; and upon what <HI>grounds,</HI> comes next under our con&s;ideration. In attending to this matter, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to make an enquiry with re&s;pect to the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of a revelation. It is &s;aid by the dei&s;ts, that a revelation is unnece&s;&s;ary; rea&s;on, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by man in his pre&s;ent &s;tate, being adequate to all his exigencies: And could this a&s;&s;ertion be <HI>proved,</HI> all would be con&s;trained to allow that &s;uper|natural a&s;&s;i&s;tance would be &s;uperfluous, and that there|fore it would not be afforded. But what our natural light is competent to, let the &s;tate of the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> Hea|then nations, and the public and well-known practices of the <HI>pa&s;t,</HI> at the mo&s;t enlightened periods, declare. It is notorious that there are nations of men, who&s;e collected wi&s;dom and ingenuity are in&s;ufficient, as an elegant writer ob&s;erves, to form a nail or a hatchet. Their wor&s;hip is wor&s;e than <HI>brutal;</HI> they are in every re&s;pect <HI>hateful, hating,</HI> and <HI>(literally) biting, devouring</HI> and ma&s;&s;acreing one another. And whether the una&s;&s;i&s;ted rea&s;on of &s;uch wretched &s;avages, ever &s;o &s;trictly fol|lowed, may be depended upon as a &s;ure guide to virtue
<PB N="18" REF="025616_0018_0FCE9CAEA4D31408">
and happine&s;s; and what they might do towards form|ing a &s;y&s;tem of laws and ethics, tending to promote and &s;ecure their pre&s;ent and future felicity, I leave my judi|cious hearers to determine. The deplorable condition of the&s;e profoundly ignorant and mo&s;t unhappy beings, who are partakers of all our merely natural advant|ages, and the fragments of revelation found among the more improved heathen nations, tend to prove that even all the improvements in &s;cience, arts and civiliza|tion among the latter, are greatly owing to &s;uper|natural revelation. And it may be rationally pre|&s;umed, that if it were not for the very advantages derived from the &s;criptures, tho&s;e who are now laurel|led as men of wit and politene&s;s, merely becau&s;e they can dextrou&s;ly ridicule every thing that is &s;acred, might have been like the Hottentots, adorned with the entrails of wild bea&s;ts tied to their hair, as en&s;igns of their &s;u|perior worth and accompli&s;hments. But without &s;ome knowledge of the bible, by tradition or otherwi&s;e, it has been found by long ob&s;ervation, that no nation or community could ever arrive at any tolerable degree of moral or religious refinement. The public practices of the learned and renowned heathens of antiquity, which were highly e&s;teemed and celebrated by their famous poets and orators, were gro&s;sly idolatrous, and mo&s;t dete&s;tably ob&s;cene, lewd and cruel. No ab&s;tract rea|&s;onings can affect the validity of the&s;e &s;tubborn and melancholy facts, or hinder them from &s;hewing, to all who will calmly con&s;ider, the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of a revelation from heaven. And none can deny that the thing, in it&s;elf, is po&s;&s;ible. God is undeniably able to communi|cate divine intelligence to his rational creatures, which his goodne&s;s induces a hope for: And who, in our happy land of light, is not convinced that this is <HI>done?</HI> The glorious effects of &s;upernatural rays, every where evince their divine origin. <HI>True light</HI> in the moral world, now &s;hines. And all mu&s;t be con&s;trained to own, that the bible, from its purene&s;s and excellency, has, indi&s;putably, the faire&s;t preten&s;ions to this exalted
<PB N="19" REF="025616_0019_0FCE9CB0059AA588">
character: In this re&s;pect it has no competitor. The <HI>once</HI> famous lying oracles among the pagans, have been long &s;ince dumb. And no man of candor and information, will put the <HI>Alcoran</HI> in competition with the writings which we call in&s;pired. For though it is highly vene|rated by the Mahometans, as brought chapter by chap|ter to their founder, by the angel Gabriel; it is an evident medley of pagani&s;m, Judai&s;m and chri&s;tianity, without a &s;ingle internal mark of originality; much le&s;s of in&s;piration. In a time of gro&s;s darkne&s;s, it was palmed upon its deluded votaries, in order to unite them together in bloody wars with their neighbors. And the helli&s;h project &s;ucceeded. The execrable end was an&s;wered to the gratification of the pride, ambition and &s;en&s;uality of its author. But Mahomet him&s;elf, never denied the divine authority of the bible. His pretence was, to revive the primitive way of wor&s;hip and purity practi&s;ed by the ancient patriarchs: The Jews readily acknowledge the authenticity of the old te&s;tament, which every unprejudiced and di&s;cerning per&s;on mu&s;t &s;ee &s;tands or falls with the new. And the&s;e excellent writings, not only &s;hine with unrivaled &s;plendor, when compared with others, but appear to &s;till higher advantage, both as to evidence and worth, upon an <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> inve&s;tigation. Both their matter and man|ner be&s;peak their author. They contain every thing that could be required or expected from a divine revela|tion, and nothing more. They are neither deficient nor redundant. "Indeed," &s;ays the great Mr. Locke, "the perfection, the fulne&s;s, the comprehen&s;ion of the holy &s;criptures, is truly a&s;toni&s;hing." Nor is it matter of wonder, that men of &s;uch penetration and profound erudition, as Selden, Milton, Boyle, Locke, Sir I&s;aac Newton, Addi&s;on and Lyttleton, ranked among their warme&s;t admirers. They are adapted to every &s;tate and capacity; and with a commanding authority, and tran&s;|forming efficacy on the heart, inculcate every thing per|fective of mankind, both in time and eternity. They po&s;&s;e&s;s the beauties and excellency of hi&s;torical, poeti|cal,
<PB N="20" REF="025616_0020_0FCE9CB195EE9408">
epi&s;tolary, theological and moral compo&s;ition, in their highe&s;t perfection. The &s;implicity, &s;olemnity, conci&s;ene&s;s, &s;ublimity and maje&s;ty of their &s;tyle, excite the admiration of all who have critical knowledge, or a ta&s;te for fine writings; to which may be added, the aptne&s;s and elegance of their &s;imilies, parables, meta|phors allegories, and other elucidating, engaging and &s;triking figures of &s;peech, which are equalled by nothing but the excellency of their doctrines, the purity of their morals, and the importance of the facts they relate or unfold. And this invaluable a&s;&s;emblage of &s;acred truths, is pervaded by the &s;weete&s;t harmony, and the &s;tricte&s;t con&s;i&s;tence. This internal evidence of its divine original is found, upon &s;trict examination, to be irre&s;i&s;tibly &s;trong; but it authenticity is al&s;o clearly atte&s;ted, by a cloud of unexceptionable witne&s;&s;es from without. We find the ble&s;&s;ed bible in the highe&s;t e&s;timation with all good men, in every age, among whom are many not only of the fine&s;t parts and greate&s;t di&s;cernment, but &s;uch who di&s;play its efficacy by a virtuous and exemplary con|duct; a number of whom have, at various periods, but particularly in the early days of chri&s;tianity, &s;eated the truth of their te&s;timony with their blood. And it is no where treated with contempt but by wicked men who&s;e di&s;like ari&s;es from the reproof it gives their vices which is a mo&s;t convincing evidence of its intrin&s;ic ex|cellency. The enemies of the chri&s;tian religion among Jews and gentiles, demon&s;trate its genuinene&s;s, and are every day fulfilling the predictions of its adorable author. And notwith&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition it meets with from the lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions of men, by a &s;pecial providence it is permanently e&s;tabli&s;hed in various populous coun|tries and great nations, and extorts external deference from many who &s;ecretly repine at its pro&s;perity; the clouds of ignorance, error and &s;uper&s;tition fly <HI>before,</HI> and the works of darkne&s;s langui&s;h <HI>under</HI> its effulgent beams. Its friends and advocates are continually &s;trengthening and multiplying, and its infatuated ene|mies falling before its <HI>gentle,</HI> though irre&s;i&s;table influence.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="025616_0021_0FCE9CB30C7817C8">If we look back to the primitive &s;tate of chri&s;tianity, we find it &s;urrounded by <HI>numerous</HI> learned politic and powerful per&s;ecutors among <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> yet gloriou&s;ly triumphing over all oppo&s;ition. It made its way without the lea&s;t external force, with &s;uch amazing rapidity through the kingdoms of the world, that this &s;ingle circum&s;tance is enough to convince any rea&s;on|able man, it was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by divine power. "Turtul|lian tells the Roman governors, that their corporations, councils, armies, tribes, companies, the palace, &s;enate and courts of judicature, were filled with chri&s;tians. And Arnobious a&s;&s;erts, that men of the fine&s;t parts and learning, orators, grammarians, rhetoricians, lawyers, phy&s;icians, philo&s;ophers, de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;entiments they had been once fond of, took up their re&s;t in the chri&s;tian religlon." Neither &s;ecret fraud, nor open violence, could retard its progre&s;s. As to the <HI>miracles</HI> a&s;cribed by the &s;criptures to Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, their mo&s;t avowed enemies acknowledged them, though they ab|&s;urdly and bla&s;phemou&s;ly a&s;cribed them to magic. Than the&s;e, nothing at the &s;ame di&s;tance of time, can be bet|ter atte&s;ted, And none can deny, that the writers of the &s;criptures appear to have been good men. Their whole lives and their deaths demon&s;trated the purity of their intentions. And as they lived in different nations, and in di&s;tant ages, it is impo&s;&s;ible there could have been any combination among them to deceive. Be&s;ides, good men would &s;corn to deceive, or attempt affixing the &s;eal of heaven to their own performances. From the manner in which they received their various intel|ligence, it is impo&s;&s;ible they could have been deceived them&s;elves. And it is certain, from the implacable enmity that wicked men have ever manife&s;ted again&s;t the &s;criptures, that per&s;ons of their &s;pirit and character never wrote them. Upon the&s;e con&s;iderations, together with the acknowledged accompli&s;hment of many of their important predictions, we fairly conclude that their author is God.

by tho&s;e to whom they are &s;ent, the infidels, virtually, in the judgment of an apo&s;tle, give God the lie, and may therefore ju&s;tly expect, except they repent, the fore&s;t condemnation. Yet this &s;in is as common, as aggra|vated; though it is impo&s;&s;ible for a hi&s;tory to be better atte&s;ted than that of the bible; or more calculated to promote the happine&s;s of mankind, even in this life.

<P>I &s;hall la&s;tly endeavour to an&s;wer a few of the mo&s;t plau&s;ible and popular objections again&s;t what has been delivered. I have &s;hewn that there are three that bear record in heaven, and that the&s;e three are one; that God's under&s;tanding is infinite; that he works all things according to the coun&s;el of his own will; that there is an election of grace to eternal glory; that the elect are prede&s;tinated to the adoption of children by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; that others, for their fore&s;een &s;ins, are righteou&s;ly appointed unto wrath; that all gifts and graces be&s;towed upon the church from age to age, under every di&s;pen&s;ation, Chri&s;t &s;tipulated for in the covenant of re|demption; that he obeyed, &s;uffered and died for the elect only, to whom accordingly the &s;pecial benefits of his death are peculiar; that tho&s;e only who <HI>hear</HI> are bound to believe; that a revelation never requires a faith differ|ent from its own nature; that &s;upernatural light is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, might be expected, and evidently is communi|cated; that the bible contains it; and, upon the internal and external evidence in its favor, is to be received as the record of a divine revelation. And again&s;t a &s;y&s;tem of doctrines &s;o con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, and all the known attributes of God; &s;o corroborated by all the di&s;pen&s;a|tions of providence; &s;o much for the intere&s;ts, happi|ne&s;s and &s;ecurity of all good men; and &s;o much for the encouragement of all who &s;incerely de&s;ire to be &s;aved from &s;in and mi&s;ery, one would think there could be few &s;erious objections.

there are none &s;o weighty but may be removed. What has been advanced is indeed my&s;teriou&s;ly awful and &s;tupendous, infinitely tran&s;cending all the powers of human rea&s;on. And if it was otherwi&s;e, as it profe&s;&s;es to be a revelation of the coun&s;els of eternal wi&s;dom, the origin, revolutions and final &s;tates of the rational world, it would be le&s;s credible. The&s;e are the deep things of God which the &s;pirit reveals, and which angels de&s;ire to look into. Had we an exact account of the material &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e, in its <HI>nature,</HI> connection and dependencies, perhaps we &s;hould not be le&s;s a&s;ton|i&s;hed. Yet the my&s;terious nature of &s;ome divine truths, is con&s;idered, by a certain cla&s;s of men, as a very capital objection again&s;t them. They think it unrea&s;onable to <HI>believe</HI> without <HI>comprehending</HI> a propo&s;ition. I allude to tho&s;e incredulous gentlemen (and &s;uch as partake mea|&s;urably of their &s;pirit) who can <HI>only believe</HI> that the harmo|nious and a&s;toni&s;hingly grand &s;y&s;tem, of which the terra|queous globe is a &s;mall part, is the illu&s;trious offspring of the great godde&s;s CHANCE; to whom they a&s;cribe their own fearful and wonderful formation, together with the pre&s;ervation and government of all worlds. And this is no greater an exertion of the credulous faculty, than to believe that a commodious and &s;uperb edifice, di&s;playing all the &s;ymmetry, proportion and elegance of architecture, may be an accidental coalition of heterogeneous materials. Every article in their creed is as evident, as that a mo&s;t curious and u&s;eful watch, may be the re&s;ult of a fortuitous collection of &s;plendid particles, independent of ingenuity or de&s;ign: Or, that a voluminous and accurate hi&s;tory, containing an authentic narrative of the events of an age, and embelli&s;hed with all the elegancies of diction, may be the production of types and points, formed, and thrown together by accident. But we are told, that our &s;cheme is not only too my&s;terious for admi&s;&s;ion, but makes God the author of &s;in. This we deny. Though we cannot to account for its origin, believe with the Manichoeans, that there are two almighty conflicting principles, who

reign independent of each other, one of whom is the author of evil; yet we acknowledge it is dreadfully certain, &s;in has entered into our &s;y&s;tem and reigned unto death; but its origin, among the &s;ecret things which belong to God, is in many re&s;pects, environed with im|penetrable darkne&s;s. From his purity and holine&s;s we know that he can tempt no man <HI>to,</HI> nor have the lea&s;t fellow&s;hip <HI>with</HI> &s;in, much le&s;s be the author of it; but as he is the Almighty, and does what&s;oever his &s;oul plea&s;eth, it is equally certain that it cannot exi&s;t con|trary to his permi&s;&s;ive will. It is evident that God could have prevented its exi&s;tence, and we are &s;ure his goodne&s;s and benevolence would have di&s;po&s;ed him to it, would it have ultimately an&s;wered the mo&s;t valuable and important purpo&s;e. He had, no doubt, infinitely weighty rea&s;ons, to us unknown, for forming as he did all his permi&s;&s;ive and effective decrees, which he fulfils in a wi&s;e, holy, ju&s;t, and powerful manner; without offering the lea&s;t degree of violence to the will of a creature. He has permitted poi&s;ons to enter into the <HI>natural</HI> as well as the <HI>moral</HI> world, and has created their antidotes; and in &s;o doing, was not le&s;s holy than wonderful in coun&s;el; and is as pure as excellent in operation. Here the grey-headed objection, "why doth he yet find fault; for who hath re&s;i&s;ted his will?" is &s;ure to be revived; but our apo&s;tle has an&s;wered it. Wicked men and devils mu&s;t know, that their voluntary wicked|ne&s;s &s;hall be righteou&s;ly puni&s;hed, though God over|rules it, contrary to their de&s;ign and intention, for his own glory. The wrath of man &s;hall prai&s;e him, and the remainder he will re&s;train. The wicked are with|out excu&s;e, though with &s;atanical effrontery they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> again&s;t God. Another objection again&s;t our repo&s;e is, that it charges God with being a re&s;pecter of per&s;ons. But let it be con&s;idered, that a &s;overeign judge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> the capacity of a benefactor, may give to one man&punc; with|out being under the lea&s;t obligation to be&s;tow as much upon every one in the &s;ame condition; though in the execution of his office, he mu&s;t pronounce &s;entence upon
<PB N="25" REF="025616_0025_0FCE9CB9CCF6D130">
every offender, in exact proportion to his guilt. To depart from the line of ju&s;tice in the la&s;t in&s;tance, will &s;ubject him to a charge of partiality; to which he is never liable, in doing what he will with his own. And who can pre&s;ume to deny the judge of all the earth the &s;ame privilege. In di&s;pen&s;ing of his benefits, he may and does open wide his munificent hands, and give liberally to &s;ome, while he with-holds from others; which applies to the common bounties of providence, as well as to the &s;pecial ble&s;&s;ings of grace. But as a law-giver and judge, "God will render to every man according to his deeds: To them, who by patient continuance in well-doing, &s;eek for glory, and honor, and immortal|ity; eternal life: But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; indignation and wrath, tribulation and angui&s;h, upon every &s;oul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew fir&s;t, and al&s;o of the Gentile. For there is no re&s;pect of per&s;ons with God." When he gives, it is not from a partiality to the objects of his bounty; but from motives of &s;o|vereign goodne&s;s within him&s;elf. He has as much re&s;pect for a Gentile, as for a Jew; for the poor, as for the rich; for the bond, as for the free; for the illiterate, as for the learned. Our doctrines only contend, with the &s;criptures, for his doing what he will with his own. It is al&s;o &s;aid, that the doctrine of particular election, repre&s;ents God as unrighteous and cruel, in pa&s;&s;ing by a number of fallen men, without giving them a chance for &s;alvation. Plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, that tho&s;e who deny an election of per&s;ons to glory, are con&s;trained directly or indirectly to argue, that God was bound by his per|fections, to put the whole lo&s;t race of men into a &s;alvable &s;tate; for were they to acknowledge, that he might have ju&s;tly left <HI>all men</HI> to peri&s;h, as trangre&s;&s;ors of his holy law, it would undeniably follow, that he might, as he certainly did, leave <HI>&s;ome men</HI> to peri&s;h. But if God was bound to make &s;alvation po&s;&s;ible for all men, provi&s;ion for their recovery was no act of mercy, but the di&s;charge of an indi&s;pen&s;ible obligation. If God
<PB N="26" REF="025616_0026_0FCE9CBD2FCE4800">
could not ju&s;tly have left &s;inners to peri&s;h in, and for their &s;ins, he was bound in, and by ju&s;tice to provide for their &s;alvation. But does this accord with the <HI>&s;crip|tures?</HI> Do <HI>they</HI> &s;ay that in laying the foundation of our hope, God did by us what <HI>ju&s;tice required;</HI> or that he had <HI>unmerited mercy</HI> upon us? If making &s;alvation po&s;&s;ible was required by <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> all that we have to prai&s;e God for, on this head, is for not acting contrary, at lea&s;t, to one of his attributes; which was impo&s;&s;ible. But this, with a <HI>witne&s;s,</HI> makes provi&s;ion for &s;alvation of debt, in&s;tead of grace. Again, the advocates for this &s;cheme, which makes &s;alvation po&s;&s;ible to <HI>all men,</HI> grant, it does not make it ab&s;olutely &s;ure to <HI>any</HI> man. Now if this &s;cheme is true, it was not impo&s;&s;ible but Chri&s;t might have died in vain; but for him to die in vain, according to the coun&s;el of God, is an event unworthy of an all-wi&s;e, immutable and almighty being; therefore this celebrated &s;cheme, &s;o congruous to the ideas of natural men, mu&s;t be fal&s;e. I &s;peak to tho&s;e who acknowledge the divinity of Chri&s;t, and unto wi&s;e men, judge ye what I &s;ay. Be&s;ides, does this plan exclude <HI>boa&s;ting,</HI> even before God? Was a man to be glorified upon it, might he not ri&s;e with propriety before the eternal throne, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the happy intelligences, &s;ay, "I confe&s;s I fell in Adam, but God being <HI>bound</HI> to put me into a &s;alvable &s;tate, I was capacitated, in common with my &s;pecies, to <HI>&s;ave my|&s;elf;</HI> and, fulfilling the conditions of my &s;alvation, by a &s;teady per&s;everance, without the lea&s;t &s;pecial a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I happily arrived at glory. And tho&s;e indolent and perver&s;e wretches, who are &s;uffering the vengeance of eternal fire, had in every re&s;pect, an equal chance with me for a bli&s;sful immortality. It was not the impartial Jehovah who made me to differ; by <HI>diligence</HI> and <HI>per&s;e|verance</HI> I am what I am!" The&s;e, and many other &s;imilar ab&s;urdities, we mu&s;t admit, or el&s;e acknowledge with St. Paul, that God might have mercy on whom he would, without the &s;hadow of cruelty or inju&s;tice. Some who hold that Chri&s;t died <HI>intentionally</HI> for the
<PB N="27" REF="025616_0027_0FCE9CBE61FA8838">
<HI>elect only,</HI> think our &s;y&s;tem deficient, becau&s;e it does not allow that he died <HI>&s;ufficiently</HI> for <HI>all mankind.</HI> But, with all deference, I beg leave to &s;ay, that this appears, at lea&s;t to me, to be a groundle&s;s di&s;tinction. It is certain Chri&s;t's merits were <HI>&s;ufficient,</HI> had they been de&s;igned for &s;uch an end, to have &s;atisfied for as many &s;inful worlds, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of their exi&s;tence and fall, as there are individuals belonging to the hu|man race. But the <HI>object</HI> cannot be inferred from the <HI>&s;ufficiency</HI> of Chri&s;t's death. He will &s;ave <HI>no more,</HI> and he will certainly &s;ave <HI>no le&s;s,</HI> than tho&s;e for whom, by divine appointment, he <HI>died,</HI> and for whom he accord|ingly <HI>intercedes.</HI> All men receive innumerable common gifts and ble&s;&s;ings, for the elect's &s;ake, in con&s;equence of Chri&s;t's mediatorial interpo&s;ition; but as he never intended to &s;ave tho&s;e whom he knew would be <HI>eventu|ally</HI> lo&s;t, it appears incon&s;i&s;tent with the divine wi&s;dom and oeconomy, to make provi&s;ion in his redemption for them. Chri&s;t is the common and providential &s;aviour of all men; but he is the &s;pecial &s;aviour only of tho&s;e whom he <HI>purcha&s;ed;</HI> and to whom he accordingly <HI>gives</HI> evangelical faith and eternal life. Some think a great difficulty ari&s;es here from the obligations all men are under to believe in Chri&s;t. But let them di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween believing in Chri&s;t as the Me&s;&s;iah, with an hi&s;toric or rational faith which is required, and may be produced by the written word; and believing in him &s;piritually, as having died for our &s;ins, which faith is of divine operation, and the difficulty vani&s;hes. Their not be|lieving in Chri&s;t as the Me&s;&s;iah, was the unbelief for which the Jews were blamed, and for which their puni&s;hment will be more intolerable in the day of judg|ment than that of Sodom and Gomorrah, who added not the contempt of the go&s;pel, to the violation of the law. A man will not be blamed, much le&s;s damned in the great day, becau&s;e he did not believe that Chri&s;t died for his &s;ins. No con&s;i&s;tent Calvini&s;t will grant that any man will be damned, for who&s;e &s;ins of every kind, Chri&s;t died; and I &s;uppo&s;e there is no one that
<PB N="28" REF="025616_0028_0FCE9CBFC51AE280">
can think a man may be damned for not believing what is not true. But one of the&s;e propo&s;itions is true, or no &s;inner will be damned for not believing that Chri&s;t died for him.</P>
<P>The Jews, with all other men, were in a condemned &s;tate when Chri&s;t came; and they hated and rejected that glorious light, becau&s;e their deeds were previou&s;ly evil. They were told that they were in a &s;tate of condem|nation, as the &s;inful offspring of Adam, as was evident from their not having faith, the only in&s;trument and evidence of per&s;onal ju&s;tification. Some, from &s;up|po&s;ing the &s;criptures to be full of offers of &s;alvation to all men, infer an univer&s;al redemption. And without &s;uppo&s;ing, either that God is <HI>in&s;incere</HI> and <HI>di&s;ingenuous</HI> in his <HI>offers,</HI> or that Chri&s;t purcha&s;ed &s;alvation for many in vain, they mu&s;t hold, to be <HI>con&s;i&s;tent</HI> with an univer|&s;al &s;alvation too. But it &s;hould be carefully ob&s;erved, that eternal life is not the <HI>offer,</HI> but the <HI>gift</HI> of God. And all invitations to a participation of &s;pecial benefits are addre&s;&s;ed to the characters to whom the promi&s;es belong. If Chri&s;t, as man, had no right to be&s;tow a place in his kingdom on a petitioner, but according to his Father's appointment, much le&s;s have his mini&s;|ters a right to offer &s;alvation to tho&s;e for whom the Father never may have de&s;igned it. There is a divi&s;ion of the word to be made, and the different characters are to have their different portions. Chri&s;t crucified, or the go&s;pel, which knows nothing of offers, terms or penalties, but is a declaration of life and &s;alvation through Chri&s;t, for condemned, ruined, helple&s;s &s;inners, is to be preached to every intelligent attending creature. And all that find, and feel them&s;elves condemned, ruined and helple&s;s, are to be encouraged to believe in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; for &s;uch he came to &s;eek and to &s;ave. He was anointed to preach good tidings to the meek, and came to bind up the broken hearted; and, not to <HI>offer,</HI> but to <HI>proclaim</HI> liberty to the captives, and the opening of the pri&s;on to them that are bound; to comfort all that mourn. The &s;imple, the &s;corners and
<PB N="29" REF="025616_0029_0FCE9CC146ED3D38">
&s;inners of every de&s;cription, are to be exhorted to attend to the reproofs of wi&s;dom, and u&s;e all the public and private means of grace; and repentance is to be preached, and enforced as the duty of all men; for had not a &s;aviour been provided for any man, re|pentance would have been the duty of all &s;inners; but the&s;e are not to be invited to partake of the food and privileges of children. IF children, <HI>then</HI> heirs. It is &s;aid that &s;inners mu&s;t have Chri&s;t, or life through him offered to them, to leave them without excu&s;e, which involves the ab&s;urdity of God's being <HI>bound</HI> to <HI>provide</HI> and <HI>offer</HI> a &s;aviour to fallen men, to leave them <HI>inexcu&s;eable;</HI> as if the law did not &s;top every man's mouth, and prove the whole world guilty before God. But Chri&s;t came not to condemn the world. It is not Chri&s;t, but Mo&s;es that accu&s;es men to the Father. It is not the <HI>go&s;pel</HI> that condemns and leaves men without excu&s;e, but the <HI>law.</HI> Some, who would be thought great friends to holine&s;s, are apprehen&s;ive we neglect the intere&s;t of morality, and open a door for licentiou&s;|ne&s;s, by not making works the condition of &s;alvation; but we mo&s;t freely leave the world to determine what doctrines have been mo&s;t owned through all ages, in de&s;troying the works of darkne&s;s, and producing the fruits of holine&s;s. If we con&s;ider the dead in &s;in, in no capacity to work for life; we believe tho&s;e who are the workman&s;hip of God, created anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, will work <HI>from</HI> life. And natural men, who di&s;cern not the things of the &s;pirit, but deem them fooli&s;hne&s;s, have many other motives which are more powerful with them, to di&s;charge the external duties of which they are capable, than the promi&s;e of eternal life would be. As to the frivolous, vulgar objections again&s;t the doctrines of grace, from their being igno|rantly &s;uppo&s;ed to render the u&s;e of means, holine&s;s, and a judgment to come, unnece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e the&s;e things cannot change the mind of God, or give him information, they are too palpably contemptible to be regarded. As the light of truth and philo&s;o|phy

prevail, our glorious &s;y&s;tem will &s;hine and tri|umph with peculiar lu&s;tre and energy. The more it is &s;tudied and inve&s;tigated, the more per&s;picu|ou&s;ly its excellencies appear. It exalts every attribute of deity, &s;hews the nece&s;&s;ary dependance of all things on the fir&s;t cau&s;e, gives weight, efficacy and perma|nency to all the divine promi&s;es, threatenings, and prophecies, leaves &s;inners without excu&s;e, excludes boa&s;ting from &s;aints, and lays a <HI>firm</HI> foundation for the <HI>full</HI> a&s;&s;urance of faith, for the mo&s;t <HI>lively</HI> hope, <HI>humble</HI> re&s;ignation, <HI>perfect</HI> patience, <HI>manly</HI> fortitude, and <HI>ex|alted</HI> piety. Heathens could exclaim again&s;t vice, as the odious bane of per&s;onal and &s;ocial felicity, with as much pertinence and zeal, as our <HI>merely</HI> moral preachers, and &s;hew with equal elegance, the nature, beauty, fitne&s;s and utility of moral duties: But evangelical preachers not only &s;et morality in a more engaging light, but direct to &s;trength and righte|ou&s;ne&s;s&punc; di&s;cover a rational method of acceptance for our per&s;ons and performances with an offended God; and engage us in the highe&s;t improvement of our nature&punc; and the mo&s;t vigorous exertion of all our powers, for the intere&s;ts of mankind, and the glory of God, by the mo&s;t <HI>animating</HI> and <HI>powerful</HI> motives drawn from the grand peculiarities of the go&s;pel.
