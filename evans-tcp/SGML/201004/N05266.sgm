<HEAD>A SHORT HISTORY OF A Long Travel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the Days of my Youth, when I lived at Home in my Father's Hou&s;e, I heard many People talk of the Hou&s;e of God; and that who&s;oever did attain to get into it, did en|joy all manner of Happine&s;s, both in this World, and that which is to come. And a great De&s;ire kindled in me, if it was po&s;&s;ible, to get into the Hou&s;e; but I knew not where it was, neither did they that talk'd of it: But they had heard the Re|port, and they had reported what they had heard. There were al&s;o &s;ome Books that had been written by Men that had been in that Hou&s;e: which Books did declare much of the Joy and Felicity they had in that Hou&s;e: Which Books I got, and Read them over and over, which did much &s;trengthen my Belief in the Truth of the Reports; but by no means could I tell which was my Way. Yet &s;o ardent were my de&s;ires, that I thought my &s;elf willing to for&s;ake my Father's Hou&s;e, and country and all, to Travel any where,
<PB N="4" REF="006656_0003_1029757D73C78610">wherever my Legs could carry me, &s;o I might find this Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>And upon a Time I was breaking my Mind to a Friend of mine upon this Subject, who really told me, there were Men appointed in every Place, to Guide them that were willing to go thither; and it was their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and they had nothing el&s;e to do. When I heard this I was Comforted; and de&s;ired him if he loved me, to bring me Ac|quainted with one of the&s;e Men.</P>
<P>He told me he would, which he did; and when I came to Treat with the Man, and let him know the fervent De&s;ire I had to get to the Hou&s;e of God, which I had heard &s;uch Excellent Things of; and that I heard he was one Appointed to Guide any thither, that were willing to go. He very readily An&s;wered, and told me it was his Bu&s;ine&s;s to Guide any thither that were willing to go, and to per&s;wade Folks that were not yet willing to go; and if I would comply with his Terms, and follow him, he would lead me thither.</P>
<P>I asked him what his Terms were; he &s;aid, the Way was long, and would lead him from his Home, and I mu&s;t bear his Charges, and &s;ome|thing over.&mdash; To all which I agreed; &s;o we &s;et forward on our Journey early in the Morning; but before we had gone one Days Journey, I &s;aw my Guide &s;ometimes &s;tand &s;till and look about him; and &s;ometimes would pull a little Book out of his Pocket, and read a little to him&s;elf; which made me begin to mi&s;tru&s;t, that he knew the Way no better than I. However I &s;aid nothing, but went on, following him &s;everal Days Journey after this manner; and the further he went the
<PB N="5" REF="006656_0004_1029757F0E09A4A8">more my Guide was at a lo&s;t; and went &s;ometimes a little on, and then would look about him, and then turn another Way, and &s;ometimes right back again for a while, and then turn again. So my Su&s;picion grew very &s;trong, and I began to be in great Anxiety of Spirit, but &s;aid little to him about it.</P>
<P>But one day as we were Travelling along, we met with a Man that took Notice of my &s;ad Coun|tenance, and tired Condition, and he &s;poke very kindly to me, <HI>Young Man, whether art thou Bound?</HI> And when I began to tell him &s;omething of my Journey, he de&s;ired me to &s;it down upon the Gra&s;s, in a &s;hady Place, and Di&s;cour&s;e a little a|bout my Journey, and &s;o we did, and I told him how things had gone with me to that very hour. And whil&s;t I was telling him the Story, my Guide fell a&s;leep; at which I was not &s;orry, for thereby I had the more freedom to Di&s;cour&s;e with the Man; and when I had told him all, he pittied me, and withal told me, to his certain Knowledge this Guide of mine had never been at the Hou&s;e, neither did know the way to it, but as he had got &s;ome marks of the way, which he had receiv'd, as I or another may do, and if I followed him all my Days, I &s;hould be never the nearer to it, and &s;hould find at la&s;t, I had &s;pent my Time, Money and La|bour, to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>This Di&s;cour&s;e did &s;o a&s;toni&s;h me, that I was at my wits end, and did not know what Cour&s;e to take. The Man &s;eeing what an Agony I was in, began to Comfort me, and told me that the Hou&s;e I &s;ought was nearer than I was aware of; and if I would for&s;ake that Guide, and follow him, he
<PB N="6" REF="006656_0005_1029758212EA8B68">would &s;oon bring me in &s;ight of that Hou&s;e. Quoth he, I am one that belongs to that Hou&s;e, and have done &s;o &s;everal Years; and whereas, &s;aid he, thou art to bear his Charges, and give him Money be&s;ides, I will a&s;&s;ure thee it is not the man|ner of the Guides that belong to this Hou&s;e of God to take Money for Guiding People thither, I my &s;elf have been a Guide to many a one in my Time, but never took one Penny of them for it.</P>
<P>By this time you may think within your &s;elves, how my drooping Spirits were Comforted, and a new Hope &s;pringing, and a Re&s;olution to for&s;ake my wandering Guide, and to follow this New one.</P>
<P>Upon which, I awaked my Guide, and told him my Mind, and Paid him what I had agreed for, And Advi&s;ed him never to &s;erve poor Soul as he had done me; for I &s;ee, &s;aid I, thou knowe&s;t not the way, but as thou ha&s;t learned in &s;ome Books of it. If Book-Learning would have &s;erved my turn to have found this famous Hou&s;e, I needed not thee, nor any body el&s;e to have guided me to it, for there are but very few that have written expe|rimentally of it; but I have Read them diligent|ly; but now I have met with a Man, that I judge has more experience of the way than thou ha&s;t, and I am re&s;olved to go with him; and if thou wilt hone&s;tly confe&s;s thy Ignorance, and go along with us, come and welcome, one Guide will &s;erve two Travellers as well as one in the way; but I could not per&s;wade him, &s;o I left him to take his own way as he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>So I &s;et forward with my new Guide pretty chearfully, and he entertained me with a good deal of Di&s;cour&s;e by the way, and we went on in
<PB N="7" REF="006656_0006_102975851F216FC8">pretty &s;mooths Paths, and without &s;topping, and he told me in a &s;hort Time, we &s;hould come in &s;ight of the Hou&s;e, which made my Travel the ea&s;ier; and he al&s;o told me &s;omething of the Rules and Orders of the Hou&s;e, at which I was not at all Di&s;couraged; for I con&s;idered, God was a God of Order, and I doubted not but there was good Orders in his Hou&s;e, to which I was willing to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>And as we were thus Travelling along, he of a &s;udden &s;pake to me, &s;aying yonder is the Hou&s;e; at which I was exceeding glad, for now I thought I had not &s;pent my Labour in vain, and the nearer we grew to it, the more my Joy encrea&s;ed; and when I came in view of it, I plea&s;ed my &s;elf ex|treamly with looking at it, and viewing the Tow|ers and Turrets that were upon it, and the excel|lent Carvings and Paintings with which it was a|dorned; and there was as much of Art in &s;etting it forth, as could be imagined. Oh! thought I, if there be &s;o much Glory without, &s;urely there is more within, which I &s;hall &s;hortly be a Partaker of.</P>
<P>And as I was thus Contemplating my Happi|ne&s;s, and was come within as it were a Bow &s;hot of the Hou&s;e, we were to go down into a Valley, which we did, and in the Bottom of the Valley glided a long &s;mall River, and I looked about to &s;ee for a Bridge to go over it, but could &s;ee none; at which I wondered; but on we went till we came to the River &s;ide, then I asked my Guide where the Bridge was; truly he told me there was none, but we mu&s;t go thro' it, and &s;o mu&s;t all that go into that Hou&s;e.
<PB N="8" REF="006656_0007_102975886C82B6E0">I was a little troubled with my &s;elf, but he told me he had been through it, and there was no Dan|ger at all. With that I began to think within my &s;elf, have I taken all this Pains, and &s;hall give over for &s;o &s;mall a matter as this is; what would I have gone through when in my Father's Hou&s;e, to attain to the Knowledge of the Hou&s;e of God, and a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion therein; not Water nor verily Fire would have &s;topt me then, if I had had &s;o fair a Pro&s;pect of it as now I have.</P>
<P>I told my Guide, if he plea&s;ed to go before, I would follow him; &s;o in he went, and I after him; but when I came at the middle, there it was &s;o deep, that the Water went over my Head but I made &s;hift to keep my Feet to the ground, and got well out on the other &s;ide; and my Guided and I went up together very plea&s;antly; and when we came to the top of the Hill, there was a wide Plain, and in the middle thereof the Hou&s;e &s;tood. So we went apace, and drew near to it, and there I &s;aw a very &s;tately Porch at the We&s;t end of the Hou&s;e, and at the Door &s;tood a &s;trong tall Porter, to whom my Guide &s;pake, and &s;aid to him on this wi&s;e.</P>
<P>This Young Man hath long had a De&s;ire to be Entertained in the Hou&s;e of God, thereupon I have conducted him hither; the Porter asked him which way I came thither? He &s;aid through the River, and I don't remember he asked him any more Que&s;tions, but bid me welcome, and let me into the Hou&s;e, and my Guide went in with me, through many turnings and windings into a great Hall; mine Eyes went to and fro as I went about the Hou&s;e, and in the great Hall there I &s;aw
<PB N="9" REF="006656_0008_1029758B77AE12F8">many People, they bid me welcome, but none knew the Angui&s;h of my Soul; for I began to Que&s;tion, whether I was not again beguiled, for I found the Hou&s;e foul and Dirty, almo&s;t in every Part, and &s;o belined with Spiders and Cobwebs, that I thought in my &s;elf it had never been Swept clean &s;ince it was Built; and &s;ome things I met withal that di&s;plea&s;ed me yet wor&s;e, as ye &s;hall hear; howbeit a good Bed was provided for me to Re&s;t upon if I could; and I having little Stomack, af|ter I &s;aw how it was made ready, I went to Bed, and di&s;po&s;ed my &s;elf to Sleep what I could, but alas Sleep departed from me, and my Spirits were grievou&s;ly vexed, and my Cogitations were many, and grievous; &s;ometimes I thought of the Paintings without, and how that Suited not with the Dirti|ne&s;s that was within; and if I was deceived, what Cour&s;e I &s;hould take,</P>
<P>After a long and tedious thinking, I plea&s;ed my &s;elf with this, it may be better To-morrow, &s;o I fell into a Slumber a pretty while. In the Mor|ning before I Ro&s;e, I heard two or three Contend|ind about &s;ome Accounts, in which one laid Fraud to the others Charge; the other, in&s;tead of vindi|cating him&s;elf, fell a twitting him in the Teeth with &s;omething of the like kind; they grew hot in Words, &s;o that they threatened to turn each other out of Doors, and drive him back again through the River, and never &s;uffer him to come into the Hou&s;e any more.</P>
<P>My Heart was ready to bur&s;t with Sorrow, and in the Angui&s;h of my Spirit, I Ro&s;e and went to them, and told them, I little thought to have found
<PB N="10" REF="006656_0009_1029758FEDA4A588">&s;uch Doings, or heard &s;uch Language in the Hou&s;e of God. I fear, quoth I, I am deceived, and brought in among&s;t you by a fair Shew, but &s;ee not the Glory, Peace and Tranquility.</P>
<P>So I walked away to another Part of the Hou&s;e where I heard a great noi&s;e of hard Words, and I drew near, and under&s;tood it was about choo&s;ing an Officer, and two was &s;triving about it, and each of them had got a Party, and each Party grew hot one again&s;t another. As &s;oon as I could be heard, I &s;pake to them, and told them &s;uch kind of doings as this, did more re&s;emble a place in the World, called <HI>Billingsgate,</HI> than the Hou&s;e of God.</P>
<P>I went a little further, and there I heard &s;ome Women Scolding about taking the upper hand, and about &s;ome Fa&s;hions in their Cloaths; and others about getting their Childrens Play things from each other. All this and much more than I &s;hall mention, increa&s;ed my Sorrow: I now began to long to &s;peak with my Guide that brought me thither; and with diligent Search at la&s;t I found him, and began with him in this Manner.</P>
<P>Whether ha&s;t thou brought me, and where are the Rules and Orders thou tolde&s;t me were in the Hou&s;e of God? I have often read of the Beauty, Order, Peace and Purity of the Hou&s;e of God, but here I find nothing but the contrary; I fear thou ha&s;t brought me to a wrong Hou&s;e, and ha&s;t beguiled me; &s;o I Rehear&s;ed to him what I had met withal. To which he Replied; I mu&s;t ex|pect Men have their humane Frailties, and that Men were but Men, and per&s;waded me to be &s;a|tisfied, and make further Trial. And as for the
<PB N="11" REF="006656_0010_1029759173776E28">Orders he &s;pake of, they were mo&s;t about Meats and Drinks, and about Rules for Electing of Of|ficers to Rule the Hou&s;e of God, as I would &s;ee in Time, if I &s;tayed; and as to the Dirtine&s;s of the Hou&s;e, he confe&s;&s;ed, them to whom the Care belonged, and was Committed, to keep the Hou&s;e Clean, had not been &s;o Diligent as they ought to have been, but he hoped, upon Admonition, they would be more Careful. To which, I returned this An&s;wer. What! do&s;t thou talk of Humane Fra|ilties in the Hou&s;e of God? that Complaint is at large in the World, but doth not become the Hou&s;e of God, into which, I have heard none can come, but &s;uch as are Redeemed from the Earth, and are wa&s;hed from their Polutions; for God &s;aith, <HI>all the Ve&s;&s;els in my Hou&s;e &s;hall be Holy;</HI> and they that dwell in the Hou&s;e of God, mu&s;t have pure Hearts, and clean Hands; and much more I told him of what I heard and read concerning the Hou&s;e of God. And told him plainly, I had let in &s;uch a Belief of the Peace, Purity, Glory and Comli|ne&s;s of the Hou&s;e of God, that I was per&s;waded that was none of it, and where to find it I knew not; but if I never found it while I lived, I would never give over &s;eeking; my De&s;ires were &s;o after it, that I thought nothing would &s;atisfy me &s;hort of the Enjoyment of it. But as for your Hou&s;e here I have no Satisfaction in it to be the Place I &s;eek for, &s;o I mu&s;t leave you.</P>
<P>His An&s;wer was to me, he was &s;orry I could not be &s;atisfied there as well as he, but if I could not, he would lay no Re&s;traint upon me; for his part, he had directed me as far as he knew, and
<PB N="12" REF="006656_0011_1029759475C050A0">he could do no more for me. After our Di&s;cour&s;e was ended, I got up and went out, but knew not where to go; &s;everal in the Hou&s;e threw things after me in a &s;piteful manner, but none hurt me; and I wandered &s;ometimes North, and &s;ometimes South, and over every way that came in my Mind; but whither&s;oever I went, the Angui&s;h of my Soul went along with me, which was more than Tongue or Pen can declare or utter, or any one can be|lieve; except this Relation &s;hould meet with any one that has experienced the &s;ame Travel; which if it doth, they will under&s;tand it.</P>
<P>But &s;o was, I had no Comfort Night nor Day, but &s;till kept going on, whether Right or Wrong I knew not, nor dur&s;t I ask any Body, for fear of being beguiled as before. Thus I got into a va&s;t howling Wilderne&s;s, where there &s;eemed to be no way in it, only now and then I found &s;ome Men and Women foot&s;teps, which was &s;ome Comfort to me in my Sorrow; but whither they got out, without being devoured of Wild Bea&s;ts, or whi|ther I &s;hould go I knew not. But in this woeful State I travelled from Day to Day, ca&s;ting within my &s;elf what I had be&s;t to do, whether utterly to Di&s;pair in that Condition, or whether I had be&s;t to &s;eek &s;ome other Town or City, to &s;ee if I could get &s;ome other Guide. The fir&s;t I &s;aw to be de&s;|perate, I al&s;o de&s;paired of the la&s;t, having been &s;o deceived from Time to Time; &s;o that all the&s;e Con&s;ultatons did but increa&s;e the bitterne&s;s of my Soul.</P>
<P>And one Day as I was Travelling in the After|noon a terrible Storm aro&s;e, with Hail and Thun|der,
<PB N="13" REF="006656_0012_102975960C04D7E0">and great Wind, which la&s;ted till Night, and in the Night al&s;o. I being weary, both of Body and Mind, lay me down under a great Tree, and alter &s;ome Time I fell a&s;leep; and when I waked, and came to my &s;elf, it was &s;till very Dark; &amp; look|ing about, I &s;aw a &s;mall Light pretty near me; and it came in my Mind to go to it, and &s;ee what it was, and as I went, that went before me.</P>
<P>Then it came into my Mind that I had heard of fal&s;e Lights, as <HI>Ignis-Fatuus,</HI> and &s;uch like, that would lead People out of their Way; then thought I again, how could I be led out of my Way, that knew no way of Safety. And whil&s;t I &s;ate down to let the&s;e &s;tarving Thoughts have their Cour&s;e, I took notice, and beheld the Light as near me as at the fir&s;t, as if it had waited for me. At which I was &s;trongly affected, and thought within my &s;elf, may be &s;ome good Spirit is come to take pitty of me, and is come to lead me out of this mi&s;erable Condition. And &s;o a Re&s;olution aro&s;e in my Mind, that I &s;hould get up and follow it; concluding in my &s;elf, that I could not be brought into a much wor&s;e Condition than I was now in. So I aro&s;e and followed it, and it went a gentle ea&s;ie pace at fir&s;t, and I kept my Eye &s;trait to it; but after|wards I found a great part of the Luggage &amp; Pro|vi&s;ion I had got together, did but burthen me in my Journey; &s;o I threw away one thing, and then an|other, that I thought I could be&s;t &s;pare, but kept a great bundle of Cloaths &s;till by me, not knowing whether I &s;hould need them. And as I thus went on and the Light before me, it led me out of the Wilderne&s;s, along a plain Champion Country, with|out
<PB N="14" REF="006656_0013_1029759C031EF340">Trees, or Inhabitants; only I perceived as if &s;ome few had gone that way, and the Light kept &s;trait in that Path, without any winding or turn|ing till I came to the Foot of a great Mountain; and going up that great Mountain, I found it hard getting up, and began to con&s;ider my great bundle of Cloaths and Garments, and that &s;everal of them were in u&s;e for a Traveller as I was, and did not know how far I &s;hould go, nor whether I &s;hould want them, if ever I was &s;o Happy as to attain what I aimed at; nor whether the Fa&s;hions would &s;uit the Place I was going to. So I threw away &s;ome, and anon other &s;ome, till I had none left but what I worn. And as I followed this my Guide, I at la&s;t got up to the top of this Mountain, and &s;aw another yet higher; and there I &s;aw a Man; he asked me whither I was going, I told him I could not well tell; but I would tell him whither I de&s;ired to go, he &s;aid whither, to the Hou&s;e of God? He told me it was that way, but he thought I &s;hould never get thither. I asked him why? Why, quoth he, there lieth in yonder Mountain, &s;o many Vipers, Adders, and Serpents, and &s;uch Ve|nemous Bea&s;ts, that they devour many People that are going that way. For my part &s;aid he, I was going al&s;o, but I was &s;o afrighted with tho&s;e Ve|nemous Serpents, I was forced to turn back, and &s;o I would have you.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered him, Friend, I have for a pretty while taken yonder Light for my Guide, and it hath directed me a long way, and it doth not leave me; look, do&s;t thou &s;ee it there before me? He an&s;wered yes, I &s;ee it; well, &s;aid I, I have
<PB N="15" REF="006656_0014_1029759EFB51E5D8">heard by Travellers, that if a Man have Fire or Light, the Venemous Bea&s;t, cannot hurt him; and I intend to quicken my pace a little, and keep as clo&s;e to the Light as I can, come go along with me and venture it.</P>
<P>He &s;aid it was true, he had heard that Fire would pre&s;erve from them, but he thought Light would not. However, for his part, he would not venture his &s;weet Life among&s;t them; If would, I might, he wi&s;hed me well, and &s;o we parted; and I made ha&s;te, got up pretty near the Light, and up I went the Second Mountain; and when I came almo&s;t to the top of the Mountain, I &s;aw many Serpents Dens, and Vipers Holes, both on the Right Hand, and on the Lift, and they drew near me, and hi&s;s'd at me, and I began to be in great fear, and trembled exceedingly; but many times when they were ready to &s;ting me. the Light would &s;tep in, or appear betwixt me and them, and they were afrighted, and run away into their Holes and Dens.</P>
<P>Oh! when I perceived this, how did my heart leap for joy within me, my joy abounded, my fear of the Serpents abated, my Love to my kind and tender Guide increa&s;ed, and my Courage and Con|fidence abounded; and I began to believe I was in the Right way to attain my De&s;ire. So on I went, keeping my Eye to the Light, through them all, without harm, till I came to the top of the Mountain; and then I &s;aw an exceeding large Val|ley, that I could not &s;ee to the further &s;ide of it; it &s;eemed to be all Moors, and Places of Water, and Boggs and Mire all over the Valley, which began
<PB N="16" REF="006656_0015_102975A085AFFA78">again to di&s;hearten me; but thought I, what &s;hall I do; all is well hitherto; I was &s;trangely deliver|ed from the Serpents, and whatever comes of it, if this Light leave me not, I will follow it, if it be through Fire and Water; and &s;o I kept on, and went down the Mountain a gentle ea&s;ie pace, and &s;ee many of tho&s;e cruel Creatures by the way, who put out their Stings at me, but none hurt me. And I took Notice, the nearer I kept to the Light, the more they kept from me; &s;o I got down to the bot|tom of the Mountain, into the large Valley, which was very Green and Plea&s;ant for a little Way; but by and by the Light went towards a great Moori&s;h Ground full of Water, and that I thought was very Dangerous; but when I came ju&s;t to the &s;ide of the Place, I &s;aw a &s;mall Narrow Path through the middle of it, ju&s;t broad enough for a Man to go upon it, and into that Narrow Way the Light lead me, and went before me; and whil&s;t I kept my Eye &s;teady to it, I went on &s;afely; but if at any time I began to gaze about, my Feet &s;lipt into the Mire, and Puddles, and then I had much ado to get into my Way again, had not the Light kindly and tenderly waited for me, I had lo&s;t &s;ight of it, and had peri&s;hed in the way; for &s;ometimes it was &s;o far before me, that I could hardly di&s;cern it, &amp; then I would quicken my Diligence, and be more Care|ful of my Goings, and keep as clo&s;e to it as I could. So that &s;ometimes the Light &s;hined round about me, and I walked in the &s;hining of it with great fulne&s;s of Spirit, and after I had walked a long time in this Narrow Way. I lift up my Eyes, and &s;aw to the further &s;ide of the Moori&s;h Valley;
<PB N="17" REF="006656_0016_102975A3852B5188">and &s;aw beyond, that there was a very high Moun|tain, and on the top of that, there was a very great Hou&s;e; at the &s;ight of which I was greatly comforted, &s;uppo&s;ing that might be the Hou&s;e I had for a long &s;ought.</P>
<P>But after this, I met with another &s;ore Exerci&s;e; for there were many I perceived had been Tra|velling in that Narrow Way, and had fallen into the Mire, &s;ome on the Right Hand, and &s;ome on the Lift; and they lay wallowing, full of Envy; &s;ome by plucing at me, to pull me in; others by throwing Mire and Dirt upon me, to Di&s;courage me: Others would &s;peak very fair, on purpo&s;e to draw me into Di&s;cour&s;e with them, that whil&s;t I &s;pent my precious Time, I might be ca&s;t &s;o far behind, that I might lo&s;e that Sight of my good Guide. But I &s;aw their Evil De&s;igns, and was aware of them, keeping on my Narrow Way till I came to the End of the Boggy Valley, and then found Firm Ground under my Feet, to my great Comfort. And I had gone but a little way, and then my Guide the Light went into a Narrow Lane, well Hedged on both &s;ides; at which I was glad, thinking I could not go wrong, and need not now take &s;o very much Care; but alas, I quickly found &s;o many By-Lanes, and Ways, that lay al|mo&s;t &s;o &s;trait forward as that I went in; &s;o that if it had not been for the Light which went a little before me, I might certainly gone wrong many time; but by carefully keeping to my good Guide, I got at la&s;t up the Mountain, and &s;aw the Hou&s;e again, and di&s;cerned a Man, of that Country a pretty way off; and I called to him, Friend, Ho! Friend, pray tell me what is the Name of
<PB N="18" REF="006656_0017_102975A7F91524D8">yonder Great Hou&s;e; He told me, the Name of it was <HI>Bethel;</HI> then I pre&s;ently remembered that that was the Name by which the Hou&s;e of God was called in my Fathers Country, where I had heard the Reports of it, and was &s;o earne&s;tly &s;et to find it out.</P>
<P>Oh! the Joy and Con&s;olation that I felt in my Soul, no Tongue can expre&s;s it, to think that now after all my Travels, Perils and Di&s;appointments, I had now found that I &s;ought for. So on I went Journying with Joy un&s;peakable; and as I went I viewed the out&s;ide of the Hou&s;e, and that was very large, and had but one Tower, there was no Car|ved Work about it, nor no Paintings, nor any kind of Device that I could di&s;cern, but all the Stones were curiou&s;ly Joined together from the Top to the Bottom. I al&s;o took Notice that all the Stones of the Building were Tran&s;parent, &s;ome more, and &s;ome le&s;s, and I &s;aw no Windows to let in Light, from without; and when I drew near to it, it had a large outward Court, and a pretty large Gate to go into it, &s;o that a Man might go into it with a large Burthen on his Back; and when I came at it, in I went, where I &s;aw many People that were very cheerful, and lived very plea&s;ant Lives; and &s;ome of them told me they had lived there many Years, and wanted for nothing, for there was a mighty Tree grew in the mid&s;t of the Court, and the Fruit thereof was good, and the Leaves al&s;o, and they were well contented with it, and it bore Fruit all the Year long; and many of them were &s;o kind as to invite me to &s;it down and Eat with them, but that I refu&s;ed; and they &s;hewed me a great Ci&s;tern, they had hewn out to them|&s;elves
<PB N="19" REF="006656_0018_102975A980F4E368">to catch Water from the Elements, and they had made them&s;elves convenient Lodgings, in the &s;ides of the Court, to Lodge in; but this did not &s;atisfie me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> I &s;aw my beloved Guide pa&s;s through them all, and enter in at a little Door at the further &s;ide of it; whereupon I left them, and made ha&s;te to the Door, wherein I &s;ee my Guide had entered, and attempted to enter in thereat, but could not, it was &s;o &s;trait, which put me into great &s;orrow of Mind, and what to do I knew not, my thoughts troubled me on every &s;ide; and all ways I tried, but in vain; Oh! thought I, are all my Troubles and Labours come to this, mu&s;t I be &s;hut out at the la&s;t, what &s;hall I do? And as I was thus perplexing my &s;elf, I thought I heard a Voice, but knew not from whence it came, which &s;aid, <HI>Young Man, &s;trip thee of thy old Garments, and &s;o thou maye&s;t enter.</HI> This occa&s;ioned yet more trouble of Mind, for I was loath to go in Naked; but at la&s;t, I thought it better to go in Naked, than not at all. So at la&s;t I went to Stripping, think|ing a few pitiful Rags &s;hould not hinder me of &s;o great an Enjoyment. And when I was &s;trip &s;tart Naked as ever I was born, I tried to enter, and found great difficulty in it; and &s;o &s;oon as I was entered, one met me, and ca&s;t a Garment of pure white Linen over me, which reached down to my Feet; and he brought me into a narrow Room, and &s;aid, Re&s;t here a while. And then I lay me down in &s;o much Joy and Comfort, as is impo&s;&s;ible to be expre&s;&s;ed, all things were &s;o plea&s;ant about me; and my Re&s;ting place was &s;o delightful, and my Heart was &s;o fully &s;atisfied, that it overcame me with Songs of Joy; but I found my Bu&s;ines&s;
<PB N="20" REF="006656_0019_102975AC81E40628">to be &s;till and quiet in my happy Condition, that I was come for to enjoy.</P>
<P>I had not been long in this Room, before I was called out to &s;ee the Beauty and Comline&s;s, of the Hou&s;e: And as I walked, I found every thing &s;o Clean and Bright, that I was ravi&s;hed in an admi|rable Manner with it; and I met al&s;o with &s;ome People that welcomed me to the Hou&s;e of God, with &s;uch Kindne&s;s as refre&s;hed my Heart; and as I came to be Acquainted with them, I marked their Conver&s;ations, and their Di&s;cour&s;es were ex|ceeding Comfortable to me; no Quarrelling, no Contention, no high or hot Words, but all pa&s;&s;ed with Meekne&s;s, and Reverence, and due re&s;pect one for the other; the young Men waited for the Words of the Ancients and Fathers, and Virgins carried a reverent re&s;pect to the Matrons, and there was an Univer&s;al Concord &amp; Unity, &s;o that I won|dered greatly; &amp; one Day I was opening my Mind to an Ancient, and told him, <HI>I admired much, and wondered greatly at the Univer&s;al Concord that I had taken Notice of, beyong all I had met with in my Life.</HI> He &s;aid it mu&s;t needs be &s;o, and could not be otherwi&s;e; for that was the Guide which lead me hither, had been the Guide to them all. And further told me, there could be no Contenti|no but where two Spirits &s;trove for Ma&s;tery, but it was not &s;o in this Hou&s;e. His An&s;wer was &s;o full and &s;atisfactory to me, that I &s;aid no more to him at that time, but went on, viewing and be|holding the Order of every thing I &s;aw, till my &s;oul was filled, and I might &s;ay, my Cup did over|flow. So that my former Labours and Di&s;appoint|ments, Sorrows and Perils did &s;ignifie nothing to me, I had a full Reward, a hundred fold.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="006656_0020_102975AF83F11C08">
So I returned to my Re&s;t again, in a Larger Room than before, where I Sung Prai&s;es to my God; and &s;etting forth the Prai&s;es of the Hou&s;e, and them that dwell therein. And a while after I was called forth of the Room where I was, and told, I was not brought to that Place, only to take plea&s;ure and delight therein, but there was Work to be done, and I mu&s;t take my part of it, and be faithfull and deligent in what I was &s;et about. To which I an&s;wered, it was enough I had attained my de&s;ires in being admitted into the Hea|venly Place; but if there were any Bu&s;ine&s;s that I could do, I was willing to do it, be it what it would, for it would be my greate&s;t Joy to do any thing to the Advancement of the Honour of the Hou&s;e of God, and them that dwell therein. Then he that talked with me, told me, it was my Work, to teach the Children &s;o far as I knew and had learn|ed, and as far as I &s;hould from Time to time be further in&s;tructed. Indeed I was a little amazed thereat, knowing my Inabilities: But when I had a little pondered that part of the Sentence; that I &s;hould be from Time to Time further in&s;tructed, I took Courage in my Work, and made &s;ome Progre&s;s in it with great Fear, and Reverence, waiting daily for tho&s;e In&s;tructions I was to re|ceive, and I did receive in an abundant maner; and the work pro&s;pered in my Hand, and the Children loved me, and I loved them entirely, as though they had been my own Children; and many of them grew up to a good Under&s;tanding, and ob|&s;erved their places and orders, to my great Delight. And after I had thus continued a while, the Elder that talked with me before, came and told me,
<PB N="22" REF="006656_0021_102975B289DA6A48">I mu&s;t take the charge of part of the Hou&s;hold, and give them their Meat in due &s;ea&s;on; and &s;uit every ones Meat, in deviding to every ones State and Condition; <HI>and not to feed &s;trong Men with Milk, or Babes with &s;trong Meat;</HI> and for that Purpo&s;e, he gave me a Key that led into the Trea&s;ure, or Sore-Hou&s;e; which when I came to &s;ee and behold it was abundently filled with all &s;orts of Nouri&s;hments that never could be exhau&s;t|ed or &s;pent while the World endured.</P>
<P>And after &s;ome Time I took out to Di&s;tribute daily among the Hou&s;hold of God, and the Store Hou&s;e was &s;till full, as at the begining, and &s;o it continues to this day, and for ever.</P>
<P>And having continued a long while in this Hea|venly Habitation, it comes in my Mind to let my Countrymen the Children of my old Father whom I le&s;t in <HI>Babylon,</HI> hear of me; for I &s;uppo&s;e they judge me lo&s;t, or devoured; but I could be glad if any, yea all of them were hear to behold, and ta&s;te and feel what I do.</P>
<P>And let none of them &s;ay, I happen'd better than many can; for I have wandered &s;ince I came into this Hou&s;e. The &s;ame Light that appeared to me doth appear to any poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Soul in the whole World; but the rea&s;on that &s;o few come here, is becau&s;e they fear the Perils and dangers that are in the Way, more than they love the Light that would lead them thither through them; and &s;o turn a&s;ide, and &s;helter them&s;elves in an Old Rotten Building, that at one time or other will fall on their Heads and they peri&s;h in the Ruins.</P>
<P>Now if any one have a mind to know my Name in my Fathers Country; but in this long and te|dious
<PB N="23" REF="006656_0022_102975B70B1E5FE0">Journey I have lo&s;t it. but &s;ince I came hither, I have a new Name, but I have no Cha|racters to &s;ignify it by, that I can Write, or they can Read. But if any will come where I am, they &s;hall know my Name. But for further Sa|tisfaction, I was born in <HI>Egypt,</HI> Spiritually call'd and my Father went and lived in <HI>Babylon,</HI> about the Time the true Children of <HI>I&s;arel</HI> were in Cap|tivity; there I came acquainted with &s;ome of the Stock of the <HI>Jews,</HI> about the time they were re|turning to their own Land; and they told me wonderfull things of the Glory of the Hou&s;e they had at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and would have had me gone along with them; and among&s;t the re&s;t, I under|&s;tood that Solomon with many thou&s;ands of Car|penters and Ma&s;ons had built it. Upon which I con&s;idered, within my &s;elf, that if <HI>Solomon,</HI> and the Carpenters and Ma&s;ons had Built it, Carpen|ters and Ma&s;ons might at one time or other pull it down again. So I went not, but &s;ought a City, who&s;e Builder is God: And now I have found it Hallalujah in the Highe&s;t, Glory, Honour, and Renown to his Worthy Name, and Power, throughout all Ages and Geanrations, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
