<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING &s;een &s;everal <HI>Pieces</HI> of your printing very well wrote, and ob&s;erving that you are ready to print what may tend either to &s;erve the Publick, or to plea&s;e, or in&s;truct any of your Rea|ders. I am now induc'd to become your Corre&s;pondent, and flatter my&s;elf, that, if I do not happen to an&s;wer the Purpo&s;es ju&s;t mention|ed, I &s;hall, however, offend no body, &s;ince my Intention is to treat of <HI>Things,</HI> rather than <HI>Per&s;ons;</HI> and if I endeavour to expo&s;e Error and Vice, or to recommend Virtue and Truth, it &s;hall be without any invidious Reflections, or particular Applications.</P>
<P>The Subject I propo&s;e, at pre&s;ent, is that of Oaths; whereby I do not mean the idle and unnece&s;&s;ary Swearing, too frequently met with in common Conver&s;ation, which, as Mr. <HI>Habbs</HI> rightly ob&s;erves, <HI>is not properly Swearing, but an impious Cu&s;tom of prophaning the Name of God, gotten by too much Vehemence in talking.</HI> But my De&s;ign is to con&s;ider Oaths as they are required by Law, to be taken by Officers judicial and mini&s;terial, as well as by Witne&s;&s;es, in the &s;everal Courts of Ju&s;tice, and to &s;hew their binding Nature, together with the dan|gerous Con&s;equences of acting in Breach of them, with Regard to the Community, to the Parties guilty, and to tho&s;e that are immediately intere&s;ted in the Thing in Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>We find then that all civiliz'd Countries and Nations have &s;een the U&s;e and Nece&s;&s;ity of Oaths, and tho' the Forms thereof have been various, according to the different Cu&s;toms and Religions that have prevailed, yet they all agree in the Rea&s;on and Policy of them, which is more firmly to bind the Takers to declare the Truth, or to per|form the Thing thereby promi&s;ed to be done, from the Fear of of|fending invi&s;ible Powers, or the Dread of &s;ubjecting them&s;elves to the Penalty which the Laws of the Society annexed to the Crime of &s;wearing fal&s;ly. And it is certain, that the very <HI>Heathens</HI> look'd up|on Perjury as a Sin of the deepe&s;t Dye, as will &s;ufficiently appear from what <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> relates of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> that, by their
<PB N="4" REF="006015_0004_1027754ECDFEC380">
Laws, <HI>Per&s;ons who had for&s;worn them&s;elves, were adjudged to Capi|tal Puni&s;hments, as guilty of the two greate&s;t Crimes, in inviolating that Piety which they owed to God, and in de&s;troying Faith from a|mong&s;t Men, the &s;tronge&s;t Pillar of human Society</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lib.</HI> 1. c. 77.</NOTE>. Nay, &s;ome of tho&s;e People, who had only the Light of Nature for their Guide, carried their Notions of the Malignity of this Crime &s;o far, that they &s;uppo&s;ed Po&s;terity often puni&s;hed for the Perjuries of their Prede|ce&s;&s;ors; an Opinion, as <HI>Grotius</HI> ob&s;erves, <HI>that was never entertain|ed but in Ca&s;es of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> enormous Crimes.</HI> And <HI>Cicero,</HI> who &s;ays <HI>that our Ance&s;tors could never find out any Thing &s;tronger than an Oath, to bind us to the faithful Di&s;charge of what we had engaged;</HI> adds, that <HI>whatever is promi&s;ed by calling God, as it were, to witne&s;s to your Words, ought punctually to be performed.</HI></P>
<P>Our famous Lawyer, the Lord Chief-Ju&s;tice <HI>Coke,</HI> tells us, that <Q>an Oath is an Affirmation or Denial by any Chri&s;tian, of any Thing lawful and hone&s;t, before one or more, that have Authority to give the &s;ame, for Advancement of Truth and Right, calling Almighty God to witne&s;s that his Te&s;timony is true. And it is twofold, ei|ther <HI>A&s;&s;ertiorum ut de pretaerito, &s;icut Te&s;tes et &s;en Promi&s;&s;orium de fu|turo, &s;icut Judices, Ju&s;ticiarii, Officiarii,</HI> &amp;c. So as an Oath is &s;o &s;acred, and &s;o deeply concerneth the Con&s;ciences of Chri&s;tian Men, as the &s;ame cannot be admini&s;tred to any, unle&s;s allowed by the Common-Law, or by &s;ome Act of Parliament; neither can any Oath, allowed by the Common Law, or by Act of Parliament, be altered but by Act of Parliament. It is called a corporal Oath, becau&s;e he toucheth with his Hand &s;ome Part of holy Scripture.</Q> 3 <HI>In&s;t.</HI> 165.</P>
<P>And, according to a no le&s;s eminent Foreigner, the learned <HI>Puffen|dorf,</HI> (with whom our Divines concur) <HI>An Oath is a religious A&s;&s;e|veration, by which we either renounce the Mercy, or imprecate the Ven|geance of Heaven, if we &s;peak not the Truth<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">De Jur. Nat. <HI>&amp;</HI> Gen. Lib. <HI>4. c. 2.</HI> Sect <HI>2.</HI></NOTE>;</HI> which Definition does more immediately regard tho&s;e that are &s;worn as Witne&s;&s;es, and comes within that Cla&s;s of Oaths which the Ca&s;ui&s;ts call <HI>a&s;&s;ertory.</HI> But the &s;ame religious A&s;&s;everation is u&s;ed by <HI>Magi&s;trates,</HI> and other Civil Officers, who&s;e Oaths are of the <HI>Promi&s;&s;ary Kind.</HI> Thus the Purport of an Oath, taken by the former, is to do equal Ju&s;tice to the Poor and the Rich, without Favour or Malice, and generally to give
<PB N="5" REF="006015_0005_1027755051F1E328">
Sentence in the Ca&s;e before them, as Ju&s;tice and Equity &s;hall direct; &s;o the latter are &s;worn to the faithful Di&s;charge of their re&s;pective Tru&s;ts and Employments, and both upon the &s;ame Terms of re|nouncing the Mercy, and calling upon them&s;elves the Vengeance of God Almighty, if they perform not what they thus engage to do. It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, however, that an Oath does not directly produce a new Obligation; for a Covenant or Promi&s;e, if lawful, binds in the Sight of God, and in <HI>fore Con&s;cientiae,</HI> without an Oath, which is therefore an additional Bond only to what was valid before. Yet it cannot from this be inferr'd, that an Oath is therefore &s;uperfluous and unnece&s;&s;ary. <HI>For,</HI> as the excellent Author ju&s;t cited, &s;ays, <HI>tho' all Men, who are not Athei&s;ts, believe that God will puni&s;h the Violation of Promi&s;es, not confirm'd by Oath, yet they believe at the &s;ame Time, and with good Rea&s;on, that tho&s;e Wretches will feel a more &s;evere Vengeance, who have, in expre&s;s Terms, called down the Wrath of God upon them&s;elves, and as far as in them lies, have &s;hut them&s;elves out from all Hopes of Mercy, whil&s;t they engaged in Wickedne&s;s with &s;o full a Purpo&s;e and De&s;ign, as to &s;hew that they valued not the Di&s;plea|&s;ure of him who is able to be&s;tow the greate&s;t Goods, and to inflict the greate&s;t Evils</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Id. B. <HI>4.</HI> Ch. <HI>2.</HI> Sect <HI>6.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Now, as it is of the utmo&s;t Importance to Government, that Ju|&s;tice &s;hould be equally admini&s;tred; and &s;ince, without Integrity in the Magi&s;trate, the Veracity of Witne&s;&s;es will be of little Avail for this Purpo&s;e, I &s;hall begin with the <HI>Bench,</HI> and make a few Re|marks on the Duty of tho&s;e that are advanced to it, on Account of their Oath. But I mu&s;t fir&s;t premi&s;e, that, as it cannot be expected our Courts of Ju&s;tice in this di&s;tant Colony &s;hould be fill'd with Men of Knowledge, Learning, and Experience, equal to tho&s;e at Home, great Allowances are to be made on that Account. If therefore we meet in them, joined with common Abilities, an upright Mind, a &s;incere De&s;ire for Information, and a &s;teady Di&s;po&s;ition to be im|partially ju&s;t, according to the be&s;t of their Under&s;tandings, I think they will be entitled to the Re&s;pect due to their Characters, and dare promi&s;e too, they will in that Ca&s;e, and with tho&s;e Qualities, for the mo&s;t Part, &s;ufficiently an&s;wer the End of their Appointment.</P>
<P>Judges and Magi&s;trates then, whether they are fitting in Judica|ture on Matters of private Property, or in order to puni&s;h publick
<PB N="6" REF="006015_0006_102775534F7A72B8">
Offenders, are under the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t &s;olemn Obligations to do what is Right, and to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of all Pa&s;&s;ions, and of every Con&s;ideration which may bia&s;s them to the contrary. As they are Men, it is not expected, they &s;hould be infallible; and therefore they are greatly favour'd by our Law, in the Execution of their Office, according to the Maxim, <HI>De f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ie &amp; officio judicis can recipitur q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">iis.</HI> It is not to be pre&s;um'd that they who are en|tru&s;ted with the Laws, and the Di&s;pen&s;ation of Ju&s;tice among&s;t the King's People, that have the Power of determining the Rights and Properties of their Fellow Subjects, which they are &s;worn to do ac|cording to the Laws, will yet be &s;o mon&s;trou&s;ly per&s;idious as to act otherwi&s;e. But, notwith&s;tanding this, it is too well known that there have been in all Ages, and in every Country, wicked Judges, and perjur'd Magi&s;trates, &s;ome of whom have been called to an Account in this World, but many more left to an&s;wer for their mo&s;t execrable Villanies in another, before a Tribunal that does not &s;tand in Need of the Help of Witne&s;&s;es to come at the Truth, and from which no Fact can be concealed, nor any Offender e&s;cape the Puni&s;hment ade|quate to his Crimes.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual Temptations to an evil Magi&s;trate are downright <HI>Bribery,</HI> the <HI>Fear of offending,</HI> or the <HI>Hopes of plea&s;ing;</HI> all which I think may be included in the fir&s;t, &s;ince the two la&s;t are, in truth, but different Kinds or Degrees of the other.</P>
<P>Direct Bribery in a Judge, in relation to a Cau&s;e depending be|fore him, was, at Common-Law, look'd upon us an Offence of &s;o heinous a Nature (being complicated with Perjury. <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) that before the Stat. of 25 <HI>E.</HI> 3. it had &s;ometimes been puni&s;hed as High Trea|&s;on. And our Books make mention of one Sir <HI>Thomas Wayland,</HI> Chief-Ju&s;tice of the Common Pleas, in the Time of <HI>E.</HI> 1. who was attainted of Felony, for taking of Bribes, his Lands and Goods for|feited, and he bani&s;hed the Kingdom, as unworthy to live in that State which he had &s;o much abu&s;ed. In like Manner, Sir <HI>William Thorpe,</HI> Chief Ju&s;tice of the King's-Bench, having been convicted of receiving Bribes of three &s;everal Per&s;ons, amounting to 100 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> was adjudged to be hanged for it, and all his Lands and Goods forfeited. The Rea&s;on of the Judgment is entered in the Roll in the&s;e Words, <HI>Quia praedict.</HI> Willielmus Thorpe, <HI>qui &s;acramentum Domini Regis irga populum &s;uum habuit ad cullodiendum fiegit malitio&s;e, fal&s;e, &amp; rebeluter, quantum in ip&s;um &s;uit.</HI> Becau&s;e that he, as much as in
<PB N="7" REF="006015_0007_10277554E856F720">
him lay, had broken the King's Oath made to the People, which the King had intru&s;ted him withal. It was, however, declar'd that this Judgment was not to be drawn into Example again&s;t any other Officers who &s;hould break their Oaths, but only again&s;t tho&s;e <HI>qui praedictum &s;acramentum fecerunt, &amp; fregerunt, &amp; habent Leges An|gliae as cu&s;todiendum;</HI> that is, only the Oaths of the Judges who are entru&s;ted with the Laws. This Judgment being given, in the 24th of <HI>E.</HI> 3. there was a Debate next Year in Parliament, whether it was legal or not, when, <HI>nullo contradicente,</HI> it was declared to be ju&s;t, and according to Law, and that the &s;ame may be given in Time to come upon the like Occa&s;ion. The Sentence of the Earl of <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> did not, indeed, extend to Life, but was very &s;evere, and plainly indicated the Abhorrence the Parliament had of his Crimes. The&s;e were delaying Ju&s;tice to the Farmers of the Cu&s;toms, in a Matter referr'd to him by K. <HI>James</HI> I. and taking exorbitant Bribes; for which, he was &s;entenced to lo&s;e all his Offices which he held in the Kingdom, to be for ever incapable of an, Office, Place, or Employment in the State; to be impri&s;on'd in the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> during the King's Plea&s;ure; to be fined 50,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> never to &s;it in Parliament any more, nor to come within the Verge of the King's Court. Happy had it been for the&s;e Judges and Great Men, I have named, with &s;ome others that might have been men|tioned, if, in&s;tead of <HI>making Ha&s;te to be rich,</HI> they had duly adverted to the Words of &s;acred Writ; <HI>Neither take a Gift; for a Gift doth blind the Eyes of the Wicked, and pervert the Words of the Righteous.</HI></P>
<P>But expre&s;s Bribery is &s;o &s;hameful, as well as dangerous a Crime, that it is &s;eldom practi&s;ed; at lea&s;t it is dore &s;o privately, that we very rarely hear of In&s;tances of it; and therefore I &s;hall proceed to the other corrupt Motives mentioned above, <HI>viz.</HI> the Fear of offending, or the Hopes of plea&s;ing any body whatever; both which are equally bad, and I doubt are too often prevalent, even in our own Country, as well as other Parts of the World. <HI>Fear</HI> proceeds from Cowardice, and ari&s;es from the Want of Re&s;olution to &s;tand the Con&s;equences that may follow the doing the Thing under Con&s;ideration. A learned Judge, who at this Time adorns one of the Courts of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> finely ob&s;erves, that <HI>Cowardice in a Judge is but another Name for Corrup|tion. They differ only as the Act and Habit. Bribery is Cor|ruption
<PB N="8" REF="006015_0008_1027755684D90720">
in the Act; but Cowardice is habitual Corruption.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ded. to <HI>Forte&s;c.</HI> of the Diff. between an ab&s;. and a mix'd Monarchy.</NOTE> And certain it is, that as long as a Magi&s;trate labours under the powerful Influence of Fear, he will be always liable to be corrupted; and, on every Occa&s;ion, will rea&s;on with him&s;elf to this, or the like Effect: How will my Determination in this Cau&s;e &s;uit my own Circum&s;tan|ces? Who are the Parties intere&s;ted in the Que&s;tion? Or what their Attachments? I mu&s;t not give Judgment again&s;t &s;uch a Man, tho' I am convinced it is right, le&s;t I offend him, or &s;ome other, who will have it in his Power to do me, or mine, &s;uch or &s;uch an ill Office: If I &s;hould vote &s;o and &s;o, I &s;hall make &s;uch a Per&s;on my Enemy, or di&s;oblige &s;uch a One, who is my Friend. And thus, for Fear his doing the Thing which is ju&s;t &s;hould interfere with his own private Affairs, or, perhaps, with the Schemes of the Party he has e&s;pou&s;ed, he will deprive his Neighbour of his E&s;tate, or his Liberty, nay, perhaps, of his Life, and thereby bring upon him&s;elf a wounded Con&s;cience, which (if it does not at length prove &s;ear'd by repeated Practice) may make him continually unea&s;y in this Life, and greatly hazard his eternal Happine&s;s, if not in&s;ure his eternal Mi&s;ery, in the next. How much more noble, more rational, and more &s;afe then, is the Way of thinking and arguing of that hone&s;t Magi&s;trate, who con&s;iders only what is Law, and what is ju&s;t: Am I convinced the&s;e are in Favour of my greate&s;t Enemy, and again&s;t my mo&s;t inti|mate Friend, and &s;hall I yet, in Breach of my Duty, my Oath, and my Honour, give Judgment again&s;t the former, and for the latter? Will this be an&s;wering the End of my being appointed in the Office I fill? Or rather, &s;hall I not, whatever Evil en&s;ue, or how inconveni|ent &s;oever it may prove, di&s;charge my Con&s;cience, and the Tru&s;t re|po&s;ed in me? Certainly this la&s;t every Man &s;hould re&s;olve to do in all In&s;tances, who accepts of a Commi&s;&s;ion. Which brings to my Mind the Oath the King's of <HI>Egypt</HI> impo&s;ed on their Judges, and made them &s;olemnly &s;wear, <HI>viz. That they &s;hould not do any Thing contrary to their Con&s;cience, even tho' never &s;o earne&s;tly commanded by them&s;elves:</HI> For tho' the Oath taken by our Judges is not con|ceived in the &s;ame expre&s;s Terms, yet it is vertually the &s;ame, as will be farther &s;hewn hereafter.</P>
<P>What has been argued, concerning <HI>Fear,</HI> will be equally appli|cable to the other Motive <HI>Hope,</HI> as they both proceed from the &s;ame
<PB N="9" REF="006015_0009_10277558709C1B68">
ill Principle. The &s;acred Authority, I have once before quoted, &s;ays, <HI>Thou &s;halt not wre&s;t Judgment, nor re&s;pect Per&s;ons;</HI> and the wi&s;e&s;t of Men tells us, that <HI>to have Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons is not good; for, for a Piece of Bread</HI> that <HI>Man will tran&s;gre&s;s;</HI> intimating how &s;mall a Matter will warp &s;uch a Man's Judgment. It would therefore be no &s;trange Thing to &s;ee &s;uch an One thru&s;t him&s;elf into the Seat of Ju&s;tice, purely to <HI>wre&s;t Judgment,</HI> attend a Court meerly out of <HI>Re&s;pect to Per&s;ons,</HI> and go predetermined on one Side of the Que&s;tion, however the Cau&s;e appear to him on the Hearing.</P>
<P>But as it is manife&s;tly a flagrant Breach of his Oath in a Judge, to be influenced by any Per&s;on on Earth, again&s;t the real Merits of the Cau&s;e depending before him, &s;o it is very repugnant to the whole Cur|rent of our Laws, which exclude even the King him&s;elf (with great Reverence I &s;ay it) from any Favour or Re&s;pect, where it interferes with Ju&s;tice, and the Oaths of the Judges. For tho' His Maje&s;ty has, by His Prerogative, divers Privileges in his Courts, in Point of Pleading and the like, yet it is allowed, and &s;o it has often been ruled, that the Judges, who are neither to deny, or to delay Ju&s;tice, ought not to obey His Royal Commands, if illegal, tho' they come under his Broad or private Seal, Writs, Letters, Me&s;&s;ages, or other|wi&s;e. Of this, there is a remarkable In&s;tance in the Reign of the renouned Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> which I &s;hall the rather cite at large, becau&s;e it is a noble Precedent of the inflexible Probity of the Judges in tho&s;e Days, and cannot be too much admired, or too often &s;et in View, as it may be a good Example to all other Magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>The Queen, in the 25th Year of her Reign, was plea&s;ed to erect a new Office in the Common-Pleas, which &s;he grants to <HI>Richard Cavendi&s;h,</HI> whom &s;he &s;ends to have admitted, but the Judges delay|ed the doing it, becau&s;e they knew the Prothonotaries of the Court claimed a prior Right to the i&s;&s;uing the Writs for which the Office was erected: The Queen then &s;ends a &s;harp Letter, commanding them forthwith to admit <HI>Cavendi&s;h,</HI> but the Judges &s;till forbore; whereupon, &s;he wrote a &s;harper Letter, requiring them to &s;hew the Rea&s;ons of &s;uch their Contempt, to the Lord-Keeper, and the Earl of <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> and they accordingly &s;ignify'd their Rea&s;ons as above; which not &s;atisfying the Queen, her Maje&s;ty &s;ends a fourth peremp|tory Me&s;&s;age, adding withal by way of Inducement, that if the others were put out, they were rich Men, and her Courts were open,
<PB N="10" REF="006015_0010_1027755E89E74F10">
where they might demand, and make out their Right. To this the Judges humbly return'd the following An&s;wer: <HI>That the Queen had taken her Oath for the Execution of Ju&s;tice according to Law; that they did not doubt but, when her Maje&s;ty was informed that it was again&s;t Law, &s;ee wou'd do what befitted her. For their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urts, they had taken an Oath to God, to her, and the Common wealth; and if they &s;hould do it without Proce&s;s of Law before them, and, only upon her Command put the others out of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, tho' the Right remained in them, it were a Breach of their Oaths; and therefore, if the Fear of God were not &s;ufferred, the Puni&s;hment that was inflicted upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> Predece&s;&s;ors</HI> (all<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing to the Ca&s;e of the Judges in <HI>Richard</HI> II<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'s Time who were, in Parliament adjudged Traytor) <HI>might be a &s;uf|ficient Warning to them.</HI> The Queen being &s;ati&s;fy'd with the&s;e Rea&s;ons, the Judges heard no more of the Matter; and I will only ob&s;erve upon it, as I go a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rg, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at by the Words in the Judges An&s;wer, <HI>without Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce&s;s of Law before us,</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted that what|ever the Right be, or in whom&s;oever ve&s;ted, the <HI>regular Cour&s;e</HI> and <HI>proper Remedy</HI> mu&s;t be taken to come at it, and which they could not, con&s;i&s;tent with their Oath and their Duty break into, or di&s;|pou&s;e with, even to gratify their Sovereign, and one of the be&s;t of Queens:&mdash;An Excellent Le&s;&s;on to tho&s;e complai&s;ant Magi&s;trates (if any &s;uch there be) who imagine an Oath of to pilable a Nature, as to allow them to go out of the ordinary Paths of Ju&s;tice, to accom|modate a Friend or a Companion!</P>
<P>To conclude this Head. As a knowing and upright Judge, or Magi&s;trate, is an amiable Character, and merits the E&s;teem of every Body, &s;o a &s;candalou&s;ly ignorant, or a gro&s;ly corrupt Per&s;on arm'd with Authority, is the mo&s;t de&s;picable, or mo&s;t odious Character in Life; the one excites the Contempt, and the other, the Dete&s;tati|on of all his Fellow-Creatures: By the Want of Capacity, the for|mer is a Di&s;honour to tho&s;e that rais'd him to the Station; and, by the Want of Hone&s;ty, the latter is a Di&s;grace to Human Nature it&s;elf; the one has it not in his Power to do the Duty of his Office, nor the other, the Will; the fir&s;t, therefore, may in &s;ome Mea&s;ure de&s;erve Pity, but the la&s;t de&s;erves nothing better than a Halter.</P>
<P>I &s;hould now proceed on my Subject, according to the Method propos'd; but I perceive my Letter is run to a great Length, and therefore &s;hall re&s;erve what is further to be offer'd for another Oc|ca&s;ion. In the mean while I remain <HI>Yours,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER, II.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE famous <HI>Machiavel,</HI> in one of his Di&s;cour&s;es upon the fir&s;t Decad of <HI>Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y,</HI> &s;ays, that <Q>Whoever will peru&s;e the extraordinary Actions of the City of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me</HI> collectively, or of &s;e|veral <HI>Romans</HI> in particular, will find that they were more tender of fal&s;ifying an Oath than of violating the Laws, judging an Of|fence again&s;t God more hainous than an Offence again&s;t Men, and God more able to puni&s;h it.</Q> And concludes, that <Q>as Strictne&s;s in Divine Wor&s;hip and Con&s;cience of Oaths are great Helps to the Advancement of a State, &s;o Contempt of the one and Neglect of the other, are great Means of its De&s;truction.</Q> Seeing therefore the&s;e were the Sentiments of the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t flouri&s;h|ing People in the World, without the Help of Revelation, and this the Remark of a very extraordinary Genius who was never ac|cu&s;ed of Bigotry or Super&s;tition, 'tis hop'd the Subject I am upon will not he thought unworthy of our further Con&s;ideration. And tho' I did not mention <HI>Juries</HI> in my former Letter, yet they being e&s;&s;ential to the Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice in many In&s;tances, and, indeed, the ordinary Method of deciding Matters of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> and <HI>Tunes,</HI> as well as of bringing Evil-doers to con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gn Puni&s;hment. I will now con&s;ider <HI>Oaths</HI> with a Regard to tho&s;e who are called upon to offici|ate in that Capacity.</P>
<P>The Trial by twelve Men is a very antient In&s;titution, and has been continued down thro' a Succe&s;&s;ion of Ages as one of the grea|te&s;t Priviledges of <HI>Engli&s;hmen:</HI> not is it u&s;ed in any other Country whatever. But the Excellency thereof notwith&s;tanding depends al|together upon the rea&s;onable Pre&s;umption there is, that &s;uch a Number of Men fairly returned of the Vicinity, will hone&s;tly and faithfully di&s;charge their Duty. To which find, all who &s;erve upon Juries, whether they are of the Grand Inque&s;t for publick Offences, or of the Petty Jury, either in Civil or Criminal Ca&s;es, are fir&s;t obliged to take an Oath in open Court, &s;uited to the Nature
<PB N="12" REF="006015_0012_102775635D28B8C0">
of the Bu&s;ine&s;s they are entering upon, and purporting a &s;olemn Pro|mi&s;e to do it with the utmo&s;t Impartiality. And tho' this is &s;up|po&s;ed to be &s;trictly binding on the Jurors, <HI>God having</HI> (as Arch|bi&s;hop <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> ob&s;erves) <HI>planted in the Natural Con&s;ciences of Men a &s;ecret Dread of Perjury above mo&s;t other Sins,</HI> yet they are not left in|tirely to the Guidance of their own Con&s;ciences in re&s;pect thereto; for notwith&s;tanding the Fear of incurring the Divine Di&s;plea&s;ure may, and undoubted will re&s;train every good Chri&s;tian from viola|ting his Oath, the Wi&s;dom of our Laws has deem'd it expedient to &s;ubject the Offenders in many Re&s;pects to Temporal Puni&s;hments al&s;o, of which none ought to be ignorant.</P>
<P>Thus, they are liable to be fin'd at the Di&s;cretion of the Court, for Mi&s;demeanours of divers Kinds, all which are more or le&s;s in Breach of their Oath. And by the Stat. 34. <HI>E.</HI> 3. <HI>Cap</HI> 8. If any Juror take a Reward to give his Verdict, and be thereof attainted at the Suit of other than the Party, and maketh Fine, he that &s;ueth &s;hall have half the Fine and, if any of the Parties to the Plea bring his Action again&s;t &s;uch Juror, he &s;hall recover his Damages, and the Juror &s;o attainted &s;hall have Impri&s;onment for one Year. So by 5 <HI>E.</HI> 3. <HI>Cap.</HI> 8. If any Juror in Affixes, Juries or Inque&s;ts, take of the one Party or the other, and be thereof duly attainted, he &s;hall not hereafter be put into Affixes, Juries, or Inque&s;ts, but &s;hall be commanded to Pri&s;on, and further ran&s;om'd at the King's Will. And by the 38 <HI>E.</HI> 3. <HI>Cap.</HI> 12. Every one of the Jurors &s;hall pay Ten Times as much as he hath taken, otherwi&s;e be impri&s;oned for a Year. Upon this Statute the Writ of <HI>Decies tantum</HI> will lie, and may be brought by any one, where any of the Jurors, after he is &s;worn, take of the one Party or the other a Reward to give his Verdict, even if they give a true Verdict, or no Verdict at all. But where a fal&s;e Verdict is given by a Jury, in a Civil Ca&s;e, the Party grieved may bring his Writ of <HI>Attaint.</HI> And &s;o odious is this Kind of Per|jury in the Eye of the Common Law, that the Judgment therein is even &s;hocking to repeat, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that they lo&s;e <HI>liberam legem</HI> for ever, <HI>i. e.</HI> be &s;o infamous as never to be received as a Witne&s;s, or to be of any Jury. That they &s;hall forfeit all their Goods and Chattels. That their Lands and Tenements &s;hall be taken into the King's Hands. That their Wives and Children &s;hall be thrown out of Doors. That their Hou&s;es &s;hall be razed and pull'd down. That their Trees &s;hall be rooted up. That their Meadow Grounds
<PB N="13" REF="006015_0013_1027756A17B5FDF8">
&s;hall be ploughed up. That their Bodies &s;hall be ca&s;t into Goal, and the Party be re&s;tored to all that he lo&s;t, by rea&s;on of the unju&s;t Verdict. 'Tis true, the Severity of this Puni&s;hment is moderated in &s;ome Particulars by the Statute of 23d. <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>Cap</HI> 3. but the Writ may &s;till be brought at Common Law, as well as upon the Statute.</P>
<P>The&s;e Methods of Proceedings again&s;t <HI>Jurors</HI> and <HI>Juries</HI> are, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, but &s;eldom put in Practice, and it is indeed a&s;toni&s;hing that there &s;hould ever be an Occa&s;ion for them at all, &s;ince as a worthy Divine of our Church has it: <HI>All Partiality of Verdicts is a &s;olemn Evil; it is a Breach both of Truth and Tru&s;t, and an implicit Defiance of the Chri&s;tian Faith, which is there pligh|ted and pawned as a Pledge of Integrity.</HI> Leaving human Puni&s;h|ments then out of the Que&s;tion, and admitting they may be e&s;caped, what Satisfaction or Peace of Mind can a Man expect, or what Quiet within his own Brea&s;t, who having &s;olemnly taken the Oath as above, is yet con&s;cious to him&s;elf that, in giving a Verdict on any Trial, he was not guided by the Truth of Facts as they appeared in Evidence, but that he was bia&s;&s;ed by Hatred or Affection, Preju|dice or Pa&s;&s;ion, and induced by Hope or Fear (and perhaps from the &s;ame Motive induced others) to condemn or acquit the Party in a Criminal Ca&s;e, or to find for the Plaintiff or Defendant in a Civil One? Is it po&s;&s;ible for one who believes a Word of our Holy Re|ligion, to eat, drink, or &s;leep, or perform the common Offices of Life with any Comfort, after he has &s;o offended? Surely if he can, or does, the Weight of his Torments and the Horrors of his Puni&s;h|ment mu&s;t be more grievous hereafter.</P>
<P>I come now, in Cour&s;e, to &s;peak of the Oaths of <HI>Witne&s;&s;es.</HI> As the Jury are &s;worn to <HI>return their Verdict according to the Evidence,</HI> &s;o the Witne&s;&s;es are &s;worn to <HI>declare the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth;</HI> and as the former therefore are not to blame, if they find according to the Evidence, altho' the Evidence proves to be fal&s;e, unle&s;s they know the Fact to be otherwi&s;e them|&s;elves (and, where any one of them does, he ought to be &s;worn to give Evidence to his Brother Jurors) &s;o if the latter give a fal&s;e Te&s;timony, they are guilty of Perjury in the &s;tricte&s;t and legal Sen&s;e of the Word. But, before I &s;peak of the Laws relating to this Offence, I cannot forbear citing the Opinion of the celebrated Arch|bi&s;hop above-mentioned, concerning it. He tells us, that <Q>De|liberate
<PB N="14" REF="006015_0014_1027756D1809EA58">
Perjury being directly again&s;t a Man's Knowledge, no Man can commit it without &s;taring his Con&s;cience in the race, which is one of the greate&s;t Aggravations of any Crime. And it is equally a Sin again&s;t both Tables, being the highe&s;t Affront to God, and of the mo&s;t injurious Con&s;equences to Men. It is an horrible Abu&s;e of the Name of God, an open Contempt of his Judgments, and an in&s;olent Defiance of his Vengeance. And in re&s;pect of Men, it is not only a Wrong to this or that particular Per&s;on who &s;uffers by it, but Trea&s;on again&s;t human Society, &s;ub|verting at once the Foundations of publick Peace and Ju&s;tice, and the private Security of every Mans Life and Fortune. It is a de|feating of the be&s;t and la&s;t Way that the Wi&s;dom of Men could devi&s;e for the Deci&s;ion of doubtful Matters.</Q> So far that great and good Man, who&s;e Sentiments cannot fail to make the deepe&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion on all that duly weigh them.</P>
<P>But Perjury is one of tho&s;e Crimes which our Laws look upon as infamous and gro&s;ly &s;candalous, proceeding from Principles of downright Di&s;hone&s;ty; and by the Old Laws of <HI>England,</HI> we learn it was puni&s;hed by Death, and afterwards by cutting out of the Tongue. At this Day there is Perjury at Common Law, and by the Stat. of 5 <HI>Eliz. Cap</HI> 9. Perjury by the Common Law has been defined to be a wilful fal&s;e Oath by one who, being lawfully requi|red to depo&s;e the Truth in any Proceeding in a Court of Ju&s;tice, &s;wears ab&s;olutely in a Matter of &s;ome Con&s;equence to the Point in Que&s;tion, whether he be believed or not. The Puni&s;hment on a Conviction at Common Law is pretty much left to the Prudence of the Court, being generally Corporal, with &s;uch Fine and Lien to the good Behaviour for a certain Time as &s;hall &s;eem mo&s;t agreeable to the Nature and Circum&s;tances of the Offence. The Statute, tho' it re&s;trains the Offence to the particular Ca&s;es therein &s;pecify'd, yet it adds to the Puni&s;hment. For, by that, the Per&s;on only con|victed or attainted &s;hall forfeit 20 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> be impri&s;oned &s;ix Months with|out Bail or Mainprize, di&s;abled from being a Witne&s;s; and if he have not Goods or Chatties to the Value of 20 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> be put in the Pillory, and have both Ears nailed. Yet it is allowed, and inferred, from a Provi&s;o in the Statute (<HI>Par.</HI> 13.) that the Court of King's Bench, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> proceeding upon Indictment or Information of Perjury at Common Law, may not only &s;et a di&s;cretionary Fine on the
<PB N="15" REF="006015_0015_1027757026F81AD0">
Offender, but al&s;o condemn him to the Pillory, without making any Inquiry concerning his Goods.</P>
<P>There are, however, innumerable Ca&s;es wherein Per&s;ons may be guilty of Perjury without incurring the Penalties of the Law, and which, being impo&s;&s;ible for human Skill to provide again&s;t, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be left to another Judicature, from who&s;e All &s;eeing Eve nothing can be hid, and who will be avenged on tho&s;e that are guil|ty, in his due Time. Thus, for Example, if a Man be called upon to give his Te&s;timony concerning a Civil or Criminal Matter, and he, in Order to &s;creen or convict the Party, or to procure a Ver|dict in Favour of his Friend, or again&s;t one whom he &s;ecretly di&s;|likes, will in the Cour&s;e of his Evidence make U&s;e of any Arts to deceive; or, by Means of the Influence he may have, endeavour to mi&s;lead the Jury, and to carry them away from the Point before them, by &s;ugge&s;ting a Thing, perhaps, that may be true in one Sen&s;e, and fal&s;e in another, and making them believe it in the former, or the like; altho' he may expre&s;s him&s;elf in &s;uch Terms as to a|void the Imputation of having &s;worn directly fal&s;e, he is notwith|&s;tanding guilty of the Crime we are &s;peaking of to a high Degree. For my own Part, I confe&s;s I &s;hould be more upon my Guard with &s;uch a Man than with another who&s;e Ears have been actually nailed to the Pillory, and in my private Judgment think him as infamous. &mdash;But, in&s;tead of multiplying In&s;tances of this Nature. I will cite a Pa&s;&s;age from the &s;ame venerable Prelate to whom I have had Re|cour&s;e more than once already, and which as it is applicable to any that can happen, &s;o it may be a very good Le&s;&s;on to &s;uch as are le&s;s anxious of the <HI>Truth</HI> in their Evidence, than of keeping them&s;elves out of the <HI>Crown-Office.</HI> <Q>This, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> may be laid down as a certain Rule, that all Departure from the Simplicity of an Oath, is a Degree of Perjury, and a Man is never a whit the le&s;s for&s;worn, becau&s;e his Perjury is a little finer and more artificial than ordinary; and tho' Men think by this Device to &s;ave them|&s;elves harmle&s;s from the Guilt of &s;o great a Sin, they do really encrea&s;e it by adding to their Iniquity the impudent Folly of mocking God, and deceiving them&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P>'Tis now Time that I pa&s;s on to the Oaths of Civil or Mini&s;terial Officers; but as they are many of them, as well as others, obliged to take what are commonly called the <HI>State-Oaths,</HI> without any particular Oath of Office, I will fir&s;t hint a few Things relating
<PB N="16" REF="006015_0016_10277571B9B5F4D0">
thereto, and which I pre&s;ume will not be wholly unnece&s;&s;ary even on this Side the Globe. The&s;e Oaths then are demanded by the Government from its re&s;pective Members, as a Security for their Fidelity and Allegiance; and the impo&s;ing of them is grounded up|on the indi&s;putable Right which every State has to pre&s;erve it&s;elf, and to u&s;e all proper Methods for its own Defence, it being highly rea&s;onable that every Man who lives in, and receives the Benefits of a Regulated Community, &s;hall likewi&s;e be under &s;ome <HI>Tye</HI> to pro|mote the general Intere&s;t of the Whole, which in a great Mea&s;ure depends on the Life and Safety of the Supreme Magi&s;trate. Tho&s;e therefore that refu&s;e to give &s;uch Security which it is in the Power of all to give (and which was never more ju&s;tly due than to his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty) do in Effect renounce the Advantages, and bid Defiance to the Laws of that Society whereof they are Members, and con&s;e|quently mu&s;t be looked upon as Enemies to it. But as the&s;e Men are liable to be dealt with according to the Laws, and &s;ometimes their Scruples may po&s;&s;ibly be truly con&s;cientious, ari&s;ing from mi&s;|taken Notions they may have imbibed by a wrong Education, I ap|prehend they are le&s;s dangerous, as well as more excu&s;able than &s;uch as will take the Oaths with their Lips only, and in Order to enable them the better to di&s;turb and injure the Admini&s;tration they &s;wear to defend. We know indeed but of <HI>one</HI> Religion which countenances &s;uch Practices in its Votaries, and that is a very great Reproach to Chri&s;tianity; and how much &s;oever they may be prevailed on to believe in the Force or Validity of a <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ation</HI> from their <HI>Head,</HI> or what Security &s;oever they may derive to them&s;elves from any o|ther Con&s;ideration, one may venture to pronounce that, if the Re|ligion <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> came to e&s;tabli&s;h upon the Earth be true, that which allows of &s;uch a Practice mu&s;t be fal&s;e; far it can't be deny'd, but, if a Per&s;on promi&s;es upon Oath what he does not intend to perform, he is guilty of Perjury in the very Act of Swearing. Nor is there any Rea&s;on therefore to doubt but Men who can &s;atisfy their Con&s;ciences, in doing, in the In&s;tance before us, what is &s;o apparently contrary to natural Ju&s;tice, will find out &s;pecious Pre|tences for defrauding their Neighbour, or committing any other Crime which their Pa&s;&s;ions may prompt them, or their Circum&s;tan|ces and Inclinations lead them to. No Wonder then if &s;uch &s;hould occa&s;ionally put others upon, or encourage them in a Breach of their Duty and their Oath, who have them&s;elves &s;o little Regard thereto in their own Conduct!</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="006015_0017_10277575412F0250">As to the Oaths of Officers, they are various, and &s;uited to the different Natures of their re&s;pective Offices, which they are &s;worn no execute according to the Rules pre&s;cribed them. It would be too tedious to enumerate the &s;everal Officers we have among&s;t us, or de&s;cend to Particulars relating to them, and therefore what I &s;hall &s;ay will be general, and the rather becau&s;e I would, above all Things, avoid Offence, having no De&s;ign in the lea&s;t to make Per|&s;onal Reflections of any Kind. Now the Oath taken by Officers, publick or private, being of the <HI>Premi&s;&s;ary</HI> Kind, to which expre&s;s and judicial Perjury does not extend, they are not, 'tis true, indict|able for that Crime in re&s;pect of &s;uch Oath; however, as they may be pro&s;ecuted for Extortion and other Breaches of their Duty, &s;o the Offence will be greatly aggravated by being contrary to their Oath, and they liable to the &s;everer Fine on that Account.</P>
<P>But the incomparable <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> &s;o often quoted, ob&s;erves, that <Q>For the Faithful Di&s;charge of Offices of great Tru&s;t in which the Welfare of the Publick is nearly concerned, it is not po&s;&s;ible to find any Security equal to that of an Oath, becau&s;e the Obligati|on of that reacheth to the mo&s;t &s;ecret and hidden Practice of Men, and takes hold of them in many Ca&s;es where the Penalty of no hu|man Law can have any Awe or Force upon them.</Q> If Per&s;ons then in &s;uch high Employments were but rightly to con&s;ider the &s;a|cred Nature of an Oath, and the Duty they owe the Publick, how cautious would they be in their Conduct! how circum&s;pect in their Actions! and what Benefits would accrue to Mankind thereby! But it, on the other Hand, they will con&s;ider their Oath meerly as a Thing of Cour&s;e, and what they are obliged to take in Compliance with the Laws only, it cannot be &s;urprizing to find them on all Occa&s;ions con&s;ulting their own Pa&s;&s;ions and Prejudices, and aiming at their own private Intere&s;t, in&s;tead of pur&s;uing that of the Publick, for which alone they were placed in tho&s;e elevated Stations. Some Difficulties may indeed ari&s;e and Ca&s;es happen wherein a wi&s;e and a good Man may be at a Lo&s;s how to behave; but then he will, no doubt, and ought to take the be&s;t Advice he can get, not be precipitate in his Determinations, but apply to tho&s;e who are be&s;t able, and, according to the Nature of the Affair, mo&s;t likely to give the whol&s;ome&s;t Ad|vice. To apply to others, is only making a Shew of being willing to do what is right, and the readie&s;t Way to be led to do that which is wrong; for &s;uch, as are known to have private and &s;ini&s;ter Views of
<PB N="18" REF="006015_0018_10277579AE3B57A8">
their own, are not likely to forward any Thing that is for the Pub|lick Good, but will ever incline to Sacrifice it as often as it is in their Power, and it &s;tands in the Way of their Intere&s;t, or the Schemes they have laid to &s;upport or agrandize them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t ob&s;erve here, that Virtue and Vice, Good and Evil, are for the mo&s;t Part very di&s;tingui&s;hable, and I am per&s;waded there is no one of common Under&s;tanding, but feels either Pain or Plea&s;ure, Unea&s;ine&s;s or Satisfaction, as he is con&s;cious of having done one or the other; and this is certain, that as often as a &s;worn Officer wil|fully and knowingly acts contrary to his Duty, he is more or le&s;s guilty of for&s;wearing him&s;elf in Proportion to the aggravating Cir|cum&s;tances with which the Fact is attended. Whether then we re&s;pect the immediate Officers of the Crown, or &s;uch as are concer|ned in Aid of the Magi&s;trate in Courts of Judicature, or in the Exe|cution of the Laws without Doors, how &s;hocking is it to &s;ee any of them partial and unju&s;t, cruel and revengeful, proud and arrogant; ready to do that for one which they will ab&s;olutely deny to ano|ther, tho' both have an equal Right; <HI>&s;train at Gnats</HI> in &s;ome Ca&s;es, and <HI>&s;wallow Camels,</HI> in others; be in the Way at all Hours to oblige &s;ome Per&s;ons in what ought not to be done, and be pur|po&s;ely out of the Way to avoid doing what others may legally de|mand; extort the uttermo&s;t Farthing from &s;ome, and connive at Abu&s;es and Mi&s;applications in others; repre&s;enting one Man's Ca&s;e in the mo&s;t favourable Light, and that of another in the mo&s;t odi|ous; artfully protecting &s;ome from the Hands of Ju&s;tice, who de|&s;erve to be puni&s;hed, and rigorou&s;ly pro&s;ecuting others that ought to be &s;pared, or have not really offended. The&s;e, and &s;uch like Ac|tions, as they are unju&s;t in them&s;elves, &s;o they are infinitely the more heinous for being done in Violation of a &s;olemn Oath to the contrary.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be remembered, that all <HI>Offices</HI> were originally inten|ded for the Conveniency of the People in general, and not to &s;erve &s;ome, and oppre&s;s others, according to the Liking or Ill-Will of the Per&s;ons that are in them. How agreeable a Sight then is it to behold Gentlemen in Offices of Tru&s;t, who by a &s;teady and uni|form Behaviour are an Honour to their Po&s;ts, and a real Benefit to the Publick; who are not capable of being cajolled, bully'd, or brib'd out of their Duty, but will inflexibly adhere to it on all Oc|currences, and in every Situation? Who will not pro&s;titute their
<PB N="19" REF="006015_0019_1027757CA4C36C38">
Places to the Service of a Party or Faction; or make them meerly &s;ub&s;ervient to that of Friends and Dependants? Who will, for the Ea&s;e of the Country, even decline pur&s;uing what may greatly tend to their own Advantage, tho' it be lawful, when there is a Pro&s;|pect of promoting the Publick Peace, and attaining a general Good thereby? And who, in a Word, will, throughout their whole Conduct, con&s;ider what ought to be done and not what they could wi&s;h, or particular Per&s;ons may de&s;ire to have done. Such Officers do indeed an&s;wer the true End of their being made &s;o, they will de&s;erve the E&s;teem, and have the good Wi&s;hes of all hone&s;t Men; and whatever Abu&s;es they may receive from others (who&s;e Acqui|&s;itions probably depend on the Confu&s;ions and Di&s;turbances that happen in Government) they will, I dare &s;ay, enjoy a con&s;tant inward Plea&s;ure more than &s;ufficient to compen&s;ate &s;uch Di&s;courage|ments.</P>
<P>But as my chief De&s;ign was to &s;tir up in the Minds of People, of all Ranks and Conditions, a due Sen&s;e of the binding Nature of an <HI>Oath,</HI> and to &s;hew the U&s;efulne&s;s thereof, and how dangerous the contrary is to Society, for which Purpo&s;e I began my Letter with the judicious Ob&s;ervation of a noted Foreigner, I will now &s;ubjoin the Suffrage of an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed for fine Sen&s;e and good Literature, as the late <HI>Walter Moyle,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> undoubtedly was: <Q>When <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> we have lo&s;t all Re&s;pect for the Obligation of Oaths, there is an End of all our Courts of Judicature, we have no other Way to judge of Right or Wrong, Truth or Fal&s;hood, nor any Security left us for our Lives and Property, when the Reverence for that &s;olemn Appeal to Almighty God is once ex|tingui&s;hed in our Minds.</Q></P>
<P>Thus I have fini&s;hed what I had to offer on the pre&s;ent Subject, which I cho&s;e to handle in an u&s;eful rather than elegant Manner, accommodating the whole as much as po&s;&s;ible to our own Cli|mate; and I wi&s;h it may prove of that Service which &s;ome very worthy Per&s;ons were willing to make me believe they would.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III. To <HI>FAVONIUS.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING read lately your Two Letters concerning Oaths, wherein you give the Sentiments of hone&s;t <HI>Heathens</HI> as well as <HI>Prote&s;tant Chri&s;tians,</HI> on that Subject, I was thereby led to re|collect what I had formerly met with of a quite different Tendency, from &s;ome of the Writings of a very learned Body of Men who are plea&s;ed to &s;tile them&s;elves <HI>of the Society of Je&s;us,</HI> and would con&s;e|quently be thought, no doubt, to be, in a peculiar Re&s;pect&punc; Fautors of that pure Religion, which was in&s;tituted by the Divine Per&s;on who&s;e Name they a&s;&s;ume. Whether they are really &s;o, or not, may be&s;t appear from the Doctrine they teach, and openly avow in the In&s;tances hereafter mentioned, to each of which I &s;hall &s;ubjoin a Reference to the Book from whence it is faithfully tran&s;lated.</P>
<P>I will begin with <HI>Filliucius:</HI> who was a famous Ca&s;ui&s;t, and the Pope's Penitentiary. <Q>The Man, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> who has externally pro|mi&s;ed any Thing, but without an Intention of performing, being a&s;ked whether he made &s;uch a Promi&s;e, may deny it, meaning to him&s;elf, that he did not make a Promi&s;e that was binding; nay, he may even <HI>&s;wear</HI> to it, otherwi&s;e he might be urged to pay what he doth not owe.</Q> <HI>Filiuc. Tom.</HI> ii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 25. n 323</P>
<P><HI>Tambourin</HI> out-goes his Brother <HI>Filliucius,</HI> for he excu&s;es tho&s;e from keeping their Word and Oath, who even make a Doubt whe|ther they intended to oblige them&s;elves to keep &s;uch Word, or &s;uch Oath. <Q>Tho' you are &s;ure, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that you have made a Vow or an Oath, 'tis probable, in my Opinion, that you are not bound by it, if you doubt whether you had an Intention to oblige your|&s;elf to &s;tand to it.</Q> <HI>Tambour. in Decal.</HI> L. 1. c. 3 &sect;. 7. n. 6.</P>
<P>But <HI>Valentia</HI> goes &s;till farther than the other two. He is of O|pinion, <Q>That, tho' you make a Promi&s;e with an Intention of be|ing obliged to it, the Obligation does not take Effect, provided there was no De&s;ign to perform the Thing promi&s;ed; becau&s;e, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> the Vow becomes void, if you have no Will to put it in Execution.</Q> <HI>Scio Volenciam.</HI> 2 ii. <HI>d.</HI> 6. <HI>q.</HI> 6. <HI>p.</HI> 1. <HI>cen&s;ere. Tam|bour.</HI> 16. <HI>L.</HI> iii. <HI>c.</HI> 12. &sect;. 1. <HI>n.</HI> 4.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="006015_0021_10277582A638F150"><HI>Sanchez,</HI> another worthy and well qualify'd Member of this So|ciety, teaches, that <Q>When one goes to &s;wear, or is pre&s;&s;ed to take an Oath, to &s;ay <HI>Uro,</HI> I burn, in&s;tead of <HI>juro,</HI> I &s;wear, which, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> whether you burn or not, would be but a venial Lye at mo&s;t.</Q> <HI>Sanch.</HI> L. iii. c. 6. n. 37. And again, <Q>If a Man &s;hould &s;wear that he has not done a Thing which in Reality he has, meaning &s;ome other Thing, within his own Brea&s;t, which he has not done, or &s;ome other Day than that alledged for the Thing done, he is neither perjured, nor a Lyar.</Q> He adds, <Q>This, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> is mighty convenient to hide many Things: But the ju&s;t Cau&s;e of making U&s;e of &s;uch Ambiguities, is as often as 'tis nece&s;&s;ary or u&s;eful for the Defence of one's Per&s;on, Honour, or E&s;tate; &s;o a Man may lawfully &s;ay, he did not kill <HI>Peter;</HI> meaning pri|vately another Man of that Name, or that he did not do it be|fore he was born, <HI>Sanch. ib.</HI> n. 15. 19, and 26.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall not make any Reflections on this hopeful Specimen of Ca&s;ui&s;tical Divinity, but only cite what the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> very mode&s;tly &s;ay of their Society in general, and &s;ubmit it whether it be any Thing le&s;s than they de&s;erve. <Q>It was chiefly for the Honour of our Society that the wi&s;e Man &s;ays in the 9th Chapter of his Proverbs, <HI>Wi&s;dom hath built her Hou&s;e, and hewn cut her &s;even Pillars.</HI> For may we not with Rea&s;on call that the Hou&s;e of Wi&s;dom, on the Front whereof the eternal Wi&s;dom of God was plea&s;ed to engrave his Name <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the Name he a&s;&s;umed when he conver&s;ed in this World? If you a&s;k now where are the Pil|lars, I will tell you, that Per&s;ons of great Note, and even the Sovereign Pontiffs, have declared a long Time ago, that God had rai&s;ed up this Society to be the Support of the Church in tho&s;e de|plorable Times.&mdash;Therefore I may venture, yea, undoubtedly, I may be allowed, without Arrogance, to a&s;cribe to the HUMBLE Society of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> that Oracle which the Prophet-King publi&s;hed of <HI>Sion,</HI> that is to &s;ay, of the Church of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t, G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ric<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Things are &s;poken of thee, O City of God.</HI></Q> The&s;e are the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Words taken from their <HI>Latin</HI> Book of the Picture of the fir&s;t Cen|tury of the <HI>Je&s;uits, p.</HI> 704. and 582.</P>
<P>I was the rather induced to addre&s;s this to you, Sir, from a Hint I ob&s;erved in your 2d Letter, that you know but of one Reli|gion that countenances prevaricating with an Oath, in its Votaries, and I think what is here thrown together &s;ufficiently proves that the

Religion intended does &s;o, tho' your own Memory and Reading will perhaps furni&s;h you with many other Te&s;timonies to the &s;ame Pur|po&s;e. When therefore we &s;ee any Thing of this Kind practi&s;ed, 'twill not be difficult to gue&s;s who&s;e Di&s;ciples they are that do it, and of what Religion; at lea&s;t we may be very certain they are not of yours, or that of</P>

<Q><P>Nulli vendemus, nulli negabimus, aut differemus Ju&s;titiam, vel Rectum.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE fir&s;t Attempt to live in Society, and to form Com|munities, was a very bold Undertaking; and we find the Poets have accordingly feigned, that when Men fir&s;t began to enter into, and make a Common-wealth, JUSTICE came down from Heaven with a Sword in her Hand, threatening the Wicked, and puni&s;hing the Profligate Members; otherwi&s;e, nothing but Murders and continual Deva&s;tations would have en&s;ued. But, without being obliged to Fiction, it is certain that Ju&s;tice is allowed by all to be a Divine Virtue, and tho&s;e that have the Di&s;tribution of it, as we learn from &s;acred Writ, derive their Power from the Almighty him&s;elf, through the Hands of the Prince who entru&s;ts them with it. <HI>Let every Soul be &s;ubject unto the higher Powers. For there is no Power but of God. The Powers that be, are ordained of God. Who&s;oever therefore re&s;i&s;teth the Power, re&s;i&s;teth the Ordinance of God For ye judge not for Men but for the Lord, who is with you in the Judgment.</HI> They would do well therefore all of them to re|member the Words in the Wi&s;dom of <HI>Solomon. For Power is given you of the Lord, and Sovereignty from the Highe&s;t, who &s;hall try your Works, and &s;earch out your Councils. Becau&s;e being Mini&s;ters of his Kingdom you have not judged aright, nor kept the Law, nor walked after the Council of God. Horribly and &s;peedily &s;hall he come upon you; for a &s;harp Judgment &s;hall be to them that be in high Places. For Mercy will &s;oon pardon the meane&s;t; but mighty Men &s;hall be mightily tormented.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="006015_0023_102775871D56D188">By the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution, one of the be&s;t in the World, the executive Power is lodged in the King, who is obliged by his Co|ronation Oath to provide proper Officers for the due Execution of Ju&s;tice, in the &s;everal Courts e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law for that Purpo&s;e; and he is him&s;elf vertually pre&s;ent in all of them, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;peaking in Per&s;on in the Words at the Head of this Paper. WE WILL NOT SELL JUSTICE, WE WILL NOT DENY JUSTICE, WE WILL NOT DELAY JUSTICE TO ANY ONE. A Noble Declarati|on! And to which every Subject, the meane&s;t as well as the greate&s;t, has an equal Right! A Right moreover, that is founded on the firm|e&s;t Ba&s;is! For as the <HI>Great Charter,</HI> wherein it is expre&s;&s;ed, has been confirmed, e&s;tabli&s;hed, and commanded by 32 Acts of Parlia|ment, &s;o Sir <HI>Edward Coke,</HI> who makes that Ob&s;ervation, a&s;&s;ures us likewi&s;e, that it is only declaratory of the Fundamental Grounds of the Common Law, and no more than a Confirmation or Re&s;titu|tion of the Privileges which were previou&s;ly claimed, and doe thereby. 'Tis on this Account, that the Crime of unju&s;t Judges has been thought to be aggravated, in Regard that their evil Prac|tices tend, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, to make the King him&s;elf violate his Oath to his People.</P>
<P>I have often fancied it might be of good Service towards preven|ting very flagrant In&s;tances of this Kind, if the Oath taken by the Judges of every Court were to be &s;et up in Capital Letters, in the re&s;pective Places where they fit. It would undoubtedly be a great Satisfaction to the Suiters, and probably of U&s;e too to &s;ome of the Judges them&s;elves, who&s;e Memory might not always retain the Pur|port of what they have &s;worn, perhaps &s;everal Years before.</P>
<P>If it be con&s;ider'd how frail the Nature of Man is, how liable to Pa&s;&s;ions and Prejudices, and how &s;urrounded with Temptations of various Kinds; in a Word, that <HI>we are prone to do Evil, as the Sparks fly upwards,</HI> it mu&s;t be allow'd, I think, that there cannot be too many Barriers again&s;t Inju&s;tice, nor too much Precaution u&s;ed in tying up the Hands of Magi&s;trates from committing it. What I hinted, therefore, concerning the Oaths of our Judges, will not, I pre&s;ume, appear altogether unrea&s;onable or im|proper; nor can it po&s;&s;ibly give Offence to &s;uch as mean to act wor|thy of their Character. As they have already vouched the Al|mighty for their Behaviour, they do not care how many of his Creatures are Witne&s;&s;es to it; and, as they fully intend to make
<PB N="24" REF="006015_0024_1027758A5D6EDDC8">
good their Engagements to the Omni&s;cient, they are not in the lea&s;t aver&s;e to the giving all other Security, that may be deem'd requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>But as my De&s;ire is not &s;o much to exclaim again&s;t bad Magi|&s;trates, as to recommend, promote, and encourage good Ones, I &s;hall cite, here, the Advice given by the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Coke</HI> to tho&s;e of his Time, and who were to come after him, which may be &s;een at the End of his <HI>Fourth In&s;titutes.</HI> <Q>You Honourable and Reve|rend read Judges and ju&s;tices <HI>(&s;ays he)</HI> that do or &s;hall &s;it in the high Tribunals and Courts, or Seats of Ju&s;tice, fear not to do Right to all, and to deliver your Opinion according to the Laws; for Fear is nothing but a betraying of the Succours that Rea&s;on &s;hould afford. And, if you &s;hall &s;incerely execute Ju&s;tice, be a&s;&s;ured of Three Things: Fir&s;t, tho' &s;ome may malign you, yet God will give you his Ble&s;&s;ing. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That, though thereby you may offend great Men and Favourites, yet you &s;hall have the favourable Kindne&s;s of the Almighty, and be his Favourites; and <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> That in &s;o doing, again&s;t all &s;candalous Complaints and pragmatical Devices again&s;t you, God will defend you as with a Should: <HI>For thou, Lord, will give Ble&s;&s;ing to the Righteous, and with thy favourable Kindne&s;s wilt thus defend him as with a Shield.</HI></Q></P>
<P>After all, I hope it will not be thought nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould make an Apology for the Freedom I have us'd in the&s;e my Letters, when I declare that I was prompted thereto meerly by the Love of Ju&s;tice, and an hone&s;t De&s;ire of promoting it, without the lea&s;t Prejudice again&s;t the Per&s;ons of any that are at pre&s;ent in Authority here. All therefore I &s;hall &s;ay is, that if there &s;hould be &s;uch a|mong&s;t the re&s;t, as are con&s;cious to them&s;elves of having been hither|to le&s;s circum&s;pect than the Nature of their Office requires (with which I am far from charging them) they will do well to be more ob&s;ervant for the future. As I envy none of them their Po&s;ts, &s;o nei|ther would I willingly make them, nor indeed ought they to be made unea&s;y therein, while they endeavour to act &s;uitable to their re&s;pec|tive Characters, according to the be&s;t of their Knowledge. To con|clude then, and as a Proof of my unfeigned Regards, I heartily wi&s;h for their own Sakes, and the Sake of the Publick, they may always feel that inward Satisfaction and Peace of Mind which never fails to attend the <HI>Te&s;timony of a good Con&s;cience,</HI> and which is a Plea&s;ure I am, for my own Part, folly &s;atisfy'd nothing el&s;e can afford.</P>
