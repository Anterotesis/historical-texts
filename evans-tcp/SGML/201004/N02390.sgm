<P>UPON the reading of the&s;e words your Thoughts will doubtle&s;s have immediate recour&s;e to the awful Providences of GOD to this People in the <HI>la&s;t Summer,</HI> and e&s;pecially on the la&s;t <HI>Lord's-Day Evening</HI> in the often repeated <HI>Shocks</HI> of an <HI>Earthquake.</HI></P>
<P>GOD that is mighty has done <HI>terrible things in Righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> and when He thus di&s;plays
<PB N="2" REF="002833_0004_0FE6727882E98778">His Greatne&s;s, it becomes us to take a very &s;erious notice of it our &s;elves, and to &s;peak to one another with a holy Fear and Reverence of His mighty Acts, that can't be parallel'd by the united force of all Creatures.</P>
<P>TO let &s;uch <HI>Providences</HI> pa&s;s off carele&s;ly and in Silence, is in a very high degree to of|fend God, and thereby we become expo&s;ed to the de&s;tructive Judgments which the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> prophetically denounces again&s;t them that <HI>re|gard not the works of the Lord, nor the opera|tion of his hands,</HI> P&s;al. 28.5. I hope there is not a Soul here pre&s;ent to whom this Charge and Threatning belong, but that we are all &s;en&s;ible of and deeply affected with this His <HI>Strange work</HI> wherein he has been loudly &s;peak|ing to us; and I pray God &s;o to keep this for ever in the Imagination of the thoughts of our Hearts as to prepare our Hearts unto Him, and that the Impre&s;&s;ion which that Night of terror made upon us, wherein we looked upon our &s;elves as dead men, as Per|&s;ons appointed to an immediate De&s;truction, may never &s;o wear off as that we &s;hall return to our former &s;inful Cour&s;es, and become the &s;ame People, or wor&s;e than we were before.</P>
<P>THE terrible Judgments which the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> foretold were coming again&s;t <HI>Ariel,</HI> have lately befallen this Land without a <HI>Me|tapher,</HI> and the de&s;ign of all is to awaken us to Repentance and Reformation; to humble
<PB N="3" REF="002833_0004_0FE6727882E98778">us for pa&s;t Sins, and to prevent future Mi&s;car|riages; to bring us down from that height of wickedne&s;s to which we are grown, that we may lie low before him, and &s;peak to Him out of the Du&s;t: And it will be well for us if this may be the Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>BUT if we are re&s;olved to per&s;i&s;t in Sin in defiance of the <HI>Almighty,</HI> and will not take the repeated Warnings He has given us, in&s;tead of Di&s;tre&s;s, Heavine&s;s and Sorrow, he <HI>will make us &s;mall as Du&s;t &mdash; and as Chaff that pa&s;&s;eth away, and it &s;hall be at an in&s;tant &s;udden|ly,</HI> ver. 2, &mdash; 5. <HI>Wo to Ariel &mdash; Thou &s;halt be vi&s;ited</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Ariel is Jeru&s;alem,</HI> the chief City of God's own People. Yet &s;he mu&s;t be told that God was coming forth again&s;t her in his hot di&s;|plea&s;ure: From whence we may learn that God will not bear with Sin in his profe&s;&s;ing People; but that they as well as others &s;hall &s;uffer for it, and more than others, as their Sins have been peculiarly aggravated. <HI>Ariel</HI>'s Fidelity to her God was her glory and &s;afety, and they that invaded her were like a Wheel, and as &s;tubble before the Wind; but her Sin prov'd her ruin, as it deprived her of his Favour and Protection, and opened a door for Calamities of all &s;orts. His Heart was turned again&s;t <HI>Ariel</HI> when &s;he was irreclaimable by all the wi&s;e and gracious Methods he had u&s;ed with her, and therefore He re&s;olves to puni&s;h her; <HI>Thou &s;halt be vi&s;ited</HI> &mdash; The word is u&s;ed both in a good and bad &s;en&s;e, carrying in it the intention of God, either to di&s;play his
<PB N="4" REF="002833_0005_0FE6728B224C9FD8"><HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> or his <HI>Mercy</HI> to a People, according as they behave towards Him. In the latter &s;en&s;e <HI>David</HI> and others implored a Vi&s;it from Him, and having obtained it, they bowed their heads and wor&s;hipped in token of Gratitude. But it is a <HI>Judicial Vi&s;itation</HI> the Text &s;peaks of, Thou &s;halt be <HI>vi&s;ited with Thunder and Earthquake.</HI> This Threatning has had a <HI>lite|ral Accompli&s;hment</HI> among us the <HI>la&s;t Summer.</HI> GOD in his ju&s;t Di&s;plea&s;ure has &s;pread over us his thick and black <HI>Cloud,</HI> deeply charged with mo&s;t awful <HI>Thunders,</HI> the effects whereof were &s;orrowful. The Earth under us has been horribly <HI>convul&s;ed.</HI> And the <HI>Stormy Wind</HI> ful|filling his Word, has &s;haken our Hou&s;es &amp;c.</P>

<P>I. <HI>THUNDER and Earthquake are the dreadful Vi&s;itations of GOD to a People.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002833_0005_0FE6728B224C9FD8">
THAT they are the Vi&s;itations of GOD none will deny, but the <HI>Athei&s;t,</HI> who &s;ays <HI>There is no God,</HI> and attributes all to <HI>Chance;</HI> or the wild herd of <HI>Epicurus</HI> who won't al|low Him to have any concern at all in the Government of this lower World. I per&s;wade my &s;elf that there are none in this A&s;&s;embly under any manner of doubt but that the late terrible <HI>Earthquake</HI> was the Work of GOD; and it is upon that Principle of Faith, that we are now acting in our <HI>Joint Prai&s;es</HI> to Him for our <HI>wonderful Pre&s;ervation</HI> in that danger|ous Hour, and in our <HI>united Prayers</HI> for his continued Protection as the day and occa&s;ion &s;hall require; &s;o that it might &s;eem a needle&s;s expence of Time and Words, to prove that <HI>Thunder</HI> and <HI>Earthquakes</HI> are the <HI>Operations of GOD</HI> which you believe already. What I &s;hall endeavour therefore from this particular &s;hall be chiefly to impre&s;s your Minds with a more warm and affecting &s;en&s;e of this Truth; or to a&s;&s;i&s;t your Faith in the more vigorous exerci&s;e of it, which you are now called unto by the late Occurrence of the Earthquake.</P>
<P>IN Order to this I &s;hall &s;ay</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THUNDER is the Work of GOD.</HI> And very much of his Maje&s;ty and Power is to be &s;een in it; accordingly it is &s;ometimes called, <HI>The Thunder of his Power,</HI> and His <HI>Powerful Voice,</HI> from its mighty noi&s;e and terrible effects.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="002833_0006_0FE672921B271C60">
THE <HI>Heathen</HI> a&s;cribed the Thunder to their great Idol <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and as a di&s;tingui&s;h|ing character of honour called him the <HI>Thun|derer;</HI> but we have learned from the <HI>infalli|ble Oracles</HI> in our Bibles to &s;ay it is God that &s;peaks to us in the Thunder, and to invocate Him in our Dangers by it, and to prai&s;e Him as our great Deliverer. <HI>Give unto the Lord O ye mighty, give unto the Lord glory and &s;trength. Give unto the Lord the glory due un|to his Name: wor&s;hip the Lord is the beauty of holine&s;s. The voice of the Lord is upon the waters: the GOD of glory thundereth,</HI> P&s;al. 29. begin. <HI>Elihu</HI> attributes the fir&s;t Production, and the &s;ub&s;equent Motion and Effects of Thunder and Lightning to GOD, all which are above the reach and influence of the mo&s;t potent Creatures, Job. 37. <HI>Hear attentively the noi&s;e of his voice, and the &s;ound that goeth out of his mouth. He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth. After it a voice roareth: he thundreth with the voice of his excellency &mdash; GOD thun|dreth marvellou&s;ly.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are very probably <HI>natural Cau&s;es</HI> of Thunder and Lightning which <HI>Philo&s;ophers</HI> undertake to account for, which brings to Mind the <HI>bold Saying</HI> of an obdurate Sinner, <HI>viz.</HI> That to have <HI>the Awe and Impre&s;&s;ion of a Deity upon our Minds when we &s;ee the Light|ning and hear the Thunder is vain and childi&s;h, becau&s;e we can a&s;&s;ign the natural Cau&s;es of them.</HI> But this is to pervert the great De&s;ign of their
<PB N="7" REF="002833_0006_0FE672921B271C60">glorious Author, which is to make us Fear Him, to rouze up an unthinking World to the con&s;ideration of a GOD above us, that can in a Moment de&s;troy our lives. This was the happy influence of it upon a <HI>celebrated Man</HI> who was reclaimed <HI>from Athei&s;m</HI> by the terrors of Thunder and Lightning.</P>
<P>THE Lightning is very evidently a mix|ture of <HI>Sulphurous</HI> and <HI>Nitrous Particles</HI> ex|tracted from the Earth by the Sun, which meeting in the middle Region of the Air, are put into a quick motion, or by an <HI>Antiperi&s;ta|&s;is</HI> are &s;et on Fire; which is al&s;o the true no|tion of the <HI>Stella cadens;</HI> the odds between them being only this the <HI>Meteor</HI> which cau&s;es the Lightning being &s;hut up in a thick Cloud, and taking Fire there, and &s;o bur&s;ting the Cloud, throws it &s;elf out with the mighty and irre&s;i&s;|table force we &s;ometimes &s;ee: Whereas the other being under no Confinement is more gradual in its motion, and u&s;ually &s;pends its &s;trength in the Air. The <HI>perpendicular motion</HI> in the Lightning is from the <HI>Nitre,</HI> the pecu|liar Quality of which is to burn downwards, and 'tis this renders it &s;o quick and penetrat|ing.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Thunder</HI> follows the Lightning as the Effect the Cau&s;e, and is made either by the Colli&s;ion of the Clouds from the breaking out of the Lightning, or by the divided Clouds falling together after it's Expul&s;ion. The mo&s;t lively Emblem in nature of Thunder and
<PB N="8" REF="002833_0007_0FE6729248163C78">Lightning is <HI>Gunpowder,</HI> both in re&s;pect of its Noi&s;e from the mouth of a Cannon, and the Effects of it. Hence it is called <HI>Artificial Thundring.</HI></P>
<P>THUS according to our be&s;t Conception, Thunder and Lightning are made; but then GOD is the Cau&s;e of this Cau&s;e; He forms the Cloud, prepares the matter for the Light|ning, and gives Fire to it. This <HI>Artillery of Heaven</HI> is di&s;charged by Him who is the GOD of Heaven; 'tis He that <HI>makes way for the Lightning of the Thunder.</HI> And it is certain that <HI>Second Cau&s;es</HI> could produce no &s;uch <HI>Effect</HI> without leave from Him; He gives them that Virtue or Power whereby they act, and He can alter their Properties, or withhold their Influences when He will; and this He often|times does when it be&s;t &s;erves his own Ho|nour, and the good of his People: He appoints when and where it &s;hall thunder, and what &s;hall be the Effect. He &s;ends forth his Voice from the black Cloud either more low or le&s;s terrible, or &s;trong and loud to our greater Amazement. He commi&s;&s;ions the fiery Me|teor &s;ometimes to rend and tear in pieces or to di&s;&s;olve the Objects it &s;trikes on according to their different Natures; &s;ometimes to bla&s;t or &s;corch them, and &s;ometimes to burn them to A&s;hes, and there's nothing that can re&s;i&s;t the force of it; no Creature but is liable to be hurt by it; for it is a ridiculous Fiction of the <HI>Poets</HI> that the <HI>Eagle carries Jupiter's Ar|mour,</HI> &s;cil. the Lightning, meaning that it
<PB N="9" REF="002833_0007_0FE6729248163C78">can't &s;trike upon the Eagle. And it is a no|tion no le&s;s ab&s;urd that Per&s;ons or Things co|vered with the Skins of <HI>Seals,</HI> or <HI>Sea-Calves</HI> are &s;ecure, from whence &s;ome have made u&s;e of them in Storms of Thunder, as <HI>Tiberius</HI> did of the <HI>Lawrel-tree</HI> which he formed into a Crown, and wore upon his head.</P>
<P>THE commanding Providence, as well as the creating Power of GOD extends to every thing. <HI>Wi&s;dom and Might are his, He changeth the Times and Sea&s;ons, and the Fire and Hail, Snow and Vapour and the &s;tormy Wind fulfil His Word.</HI> And His De&s;igns both of Mercy and Judgment to a People are many times &s;erved by the <HI>Wind.</HI> GOD &s;ometimes makes u&s;e of it to clean&s;e and purge the Air from noxious Vapours, which would be of fatal Con&s;equence to us. Sometimes to fan and cool our Bodies in the heat of Summer: and by the Wind we are able to vi&s;it far di&s;tant Countries, and commerce with all Nations, and to bring from them the rare&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;eful Productions of their Soil, as well as carry to them the be&s;t of our own. And then on the other hand by the Wind GOD &s;ometimes bla&s;ts our Fruit, brings mortal Di&s;|tempers upon a People, overturns our Build|ings, throws down va&s;t numbers of Trees of all &s;orts, and of the large&s;t Size. A &s;ad In|&s;tance of this we had <HI>September</HI> 16th. which is fre&s;h in your Memories. And then as a yet more awful In&s;tance, by this he &s;hakes terribly
<PB N="10" REF="002833_0008_0FE6729372A4A538">the Earth, and &s;ometimes rends it in pieces, and in a moment cau&s;es it and it's Inhabitants to <HI>&s;ink as Lead in the mighty Waters.</HI></P>
<P>AND &s;o GOD orders every clap of Thun|der and fla&s;h of Lightning, when and where they &s;hall be, how far they &s;hall extend, &amp; what Execution they &s;hall do, and no Man may pre|&s;ume to &s;ay, <HI>a Chance has befallen me,</HI> when the Thunder breaks upon his Hou&s;e, or de|&s;troys his Cattle or any part of his E&s;tate. GOD has often puni&s;hed the Wickedne&s;s of Men with <HI>hot Thunderbolts.</HI> The Cities of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah</HI> were de&s;troyed by Thun|der and Lightning. And it was one of the Plagues of <HI>Egypt,</HI> Exod. 9.23. <HI>The Lord &s;ent Thunder and Hail, and the Fire ran along upon the ground.</HI> And &s;o very &s;urpri&s;ing and terri|ble it was to <HI>Pharaoh</HI> as to force the ob&s;tinate wretch into a Confe&s;&s;ion of his Sin, and a Pray|er for Mercy. And by awful Thunders GOD fought again&s;t the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> when they in|vaded <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> 1 Sam. 7.10. &mdash; <HI>The Lord thun|dred with a great Thunder on that day upon the Phili&s;tines, and di&s;comfited them</HI> &mdash;. In a very lively and elegant manner the di&s;mal effects of Thunder are exhibited to us in the 29th <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> which &s;ome think was compo&s;ed by <HI>David</HI> upon the Occa&s;ion of &s;ome great Thun|der-&s;torm, <HI>The voice of the Lord is Powerful &mdash; The voice of the Lord breaketh the Cedars: yea, the Lord breaketh the Cedars of Lebanon.</HI></P>
<P>WHICH has been remarkably exemplified with us this la&s;t Summer. The de&s;tructive
<PB N="11" REF="002833_0008_0FE6729372A4A538">Effects of Thunder having been many more than we have ever known in any one, or in many Years. The long continued and exce&s;|&s;ive Heat has been productive of abundance of Thunder, and there has &s;eldom been a Thunder-&s;torm, but that &s;ome hurt has been done by it; and &s;ometimes the &s;ame Storm has broke in many Places; &s;ometimes Trees have been rent and &s;plit to Pieces; &s;ometimes it &s;truck upon our <HI>Hou&s;es;</HI> &s;everal <HI>Barns</HI> have been burnt to the ground, and &s;ome of them richly &s;tored with Grain: Sometimes it has killed fome of our <HI>Cattle;</HI> but in all, GOD <HI>who is a Covert from the Storm,</HI> has wonder|fully <HI>&s;pared his People;</HI> and though &s;ome of them have been wounded, yet none that I have heard of have been de&s;troyed. GOD might have commi&s;&s;ion'd his Thunder again&s;t our <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> and not our <HI>Sub&s;tance,</HI> and laid our fle&s;hly Tabernacles in A&s;hes in a Moment; but in&s;tead of this He &s;aid to it, <HI>De&s;troy them not.</HI> He turned the point of his arrows ano|ther way, and only di&s;play'd his awful Power in our Sight, to let us know how ea&s;y it was for him to de&s;troy us.</P>
<P>THUS Thunder is the Work of GOD, his terrible Work, and one great de&s;ign he has in it is to make us fear Him. We &s;hould therefore improve the Thunder to a more ju&s;t apprehen&s;ion of GOD, and re&s;olve that we will no more expo&s;e our &s;elves to his fiery In|dignation by breaking his Laws, le&s;t he &s;hould
<PB N="12" REF="002833_0009_0FE672939DD7E480">pre&s;ently rai&s;e a Storm of Thunder and Light|ning to avenge our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>Oh the Days and Nights of Terror that have lately pa&s;&s;ed ever us!</HI> The dreadful Thunder|claps we have heard, wherein an angry GOD has proclaimed War again&s;t his Enemies, and threatned them with &s;peedy De&s;truction by Fire from Heaven, if they did not &s;ubmit them&s;elves and turn unto Him.</P>
<P>HOW very terrible was the Storm in the <HI>Month of July;</HI> the <HI>Thunder</HI> almo&s;t continual|ly roaring over our Heads for the &s;pace of an Hour or more, and the deeply tinctured <HI>blue Lightning</HI> fla&s;hing in our Faces, and actu|ally &s;triking one, and very near to another of our Hou&s;es. Who of us thought then of ever living the Storm out, but GOD was better to us than our Fears.</P>
<P>AND the <HI>amazing Lightnings</HI> in the Night after the 1&s;t Day of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> will never be for|gotten by many, wherein there was hardly a Moments intermi&s;&s;ion for &s;everal Hours be|tween the mo&s;t di&s;mal Flames that ever our Eyes beheld: The Darkne&s;s vani&s;h'd as at the light of the Sun before them, and the &s;malle&s;t Objects were vi&s;ible to us, as at Noon|day.</P>
<P>THIS was attended with &s;ome Thunder, and one Clap broke among us; but without harm to Man or Bea&s;t. And now, from the whole, we &s;ee how very ju&s;tly we a&s;cribe the Thunder to GOD as the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of it. We are
<PB N="13" REF="002833_0009_0FE672939DD7E480">taught by Example of wi&s;e and good Men to call it <HI>His Voice, the Sound that goeth out of His Mouth, the Fire of GOD</HI> &amp;c. As if it was the immediate Production of His Hand, and &s;econd Cau&s;es had nothing to do in it. And in our Text GOD him&s;elf a&s;&s;erts his Authori|ty, and claims the Honour of being <HI>Lord of this Ho&s;t.</HI> And accordingly we are to apply to Him in all our Dangers by it, to &s;pread o|ver us the wing of His Protection, and com|mand the Thunder not to &s;trike and de&s;troy us, or our Sub&s;tance.</P>
<P>AND let our <HI>many Pre&s;ervations</HI> in the Thunder <HI>excite</HI> our &s;incere and affectionate <HI>Thank&s;givings</HI> to him; for it mu&s;t be entirely re&s;olved into his Mercy that we are not con|&s;umed.</P>
<P>LET the Children of GOD <HI>correct</HI> their <HI>un|due Fears</HI> of the Thunder. Oh act Faith in GOD then as yours. Con&s;ider it as the Voice of your be&s;t Friend, and heavenly Father, who dearly loves you, is always thoughtful of you, and who&s;e Perfections are ever engaged for your Benefit. This will help to &s;ilence your Complaints, allay your Fears, and create a Divine Calm in your Brea&s;ts.</P>
<P>AND let the Thunder and Lightning &s;erve <HI>to put us all in Mind of that Great and Terrible Day of the Lord, in which the Heavens &s;hall pa&s;s away with a great noi&s;e, and the elements &s;hall melt with fervent, the earth al&s;o and the works that are therein &s;hall be burnt up:</HI> Yea, let it extend our thoughts farther, to the <HI>devouring
<PB N="14" REF="002833_0010_0FE672A220722ED0">Fire and everla&s;ting Burnings con&s;equent upon the Judgment,</HI> to every impenitent Sinner. Which Con&s;ideration has a natural tendency to awaken us out of our dozing Frames, and excite us to flee from this Wrath by a timely and deep Repentance, a thorough and effec|tual Reformation.</P>
<P>EVERY Thunder-clap we hear has this in|&s;tructive Voice in it, <HI>Agree with your Adver&s;a|ry quickly,</HI> by an humble Confe&s;&s;ion of your many Sins, and by &s;triving no more again&s;t your Maker; but by practically acknowledg|ing GOD for your Sovereign, and by a mo&s;t free and hearty Con&s;ent to all his Claims and Demands upon you. Attend then to the Call of GOD.

2. <HI>GOD is the Primary Efficient Cau&s;e of Earthquakes.</HI></P>
<P>AS <HI>Thunder</HI> is His Voice, and <HI>Lightning</HI> a Flame that goeth out of His Mouth; &s;o <HI>Earthquakes</HI> are cau&s;ed by His &s;trong Hand: And how much &s;oever it exceeds the Strength of any Creature or all united, to &s;hake the Earth, the <HI>Omnipotent Author</HI> of it, can do it with greater Ea&s;e, than any of us can move a Finger or wave a Feather. <HI>Job</HI> having a&s;|&s;erted the Power of GOD in general, de|&s;cends to prove it by an Induction of parti|cular In&s;tances, Job 9.5&punc;6. <HI>He is mighty in Strength,&mdash;removeth the Mountains, and they know not, overturneth them in his anger, &s;haketh the Earth out of her place and the Pillars thereof tremble.</HI> What is it that infinite Power exert|ed to the height can't effect? As He gave Exi&s;tence to the whole <HI>Globe</HI> of Earth by a Word, &s;o He can de&s;troy it in a Moment.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="002833_0011_0FE6727B6045CF70">
'TIS ab&s;urd and athei&s;tical to a&s;&s;ert that Earthquakes are the Effects of a <HI>blind Chance;</HI> or to re&s;olve them into <HI>natural Cau&s;es,</HI> exclu|&s;ive of the <HI>Divine Superimendency</HI> and Effici|ency: We may affirm on equal grounds that GOD does nothing in the World in re&s;pect to Government, that there is no &s;uch thing as Reward and Puni&s;hment in any degree admi|mini&s;tred here; as deny Him this great and mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and awful In&s;tance of His Power and Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>OUR <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour</HI> would have us to ac|knowledge GOD and His Providence in the mo&s;t minute and common Occurrences of Life; certainly then we mu&s;t attribute this <HI>Prodigi|ous Work</HI> to Him, and &s;ay when this Evil is in the City or Country, it is the Lord has done it.</P>
<P>SOME Earthquakes are from GOD imme|diately, others by the agency of &s;econd Cau&s;|es, and both are a&s;cribed to Him in Holy Scripture without Di&s;tinction. And agreeably I &s;hall here &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>EARTHQUAKES are &s;ometimes the im|mediate Works of GOD,</HI> that is, they are per|formed by Him either beyond the Cour&s;e and above the Power of Nature, or &s;econd Cau&s;es are by His immediate influence &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, and operate &s;o as to produce &s;uch Effects.</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Earthquake at Sinai,</HI> when the <HI>SON of GOD,</HI> our King and Lawgiver came down upon the Mount to publi&s;h His Law,
<PB N="18" REF="002833_0012_0FE6728CBB213CD0">was a <HI>Supernatural Operation.</HI> That was a Day of <HI>Miracles,</HI> and every thing in it was extraordinary, &s;uitable to the Pomp and So|lemnity of it. 'Tis of this awful Tran&s;action that the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> &s;peaks, P&s;al. 114. <HI>When I&s;rael went out of Egypt &mdash; the Sea &s;aw it and fled, Jordan was driven back, the Mountains &s;kipped like Rame, and the little Hills like Lambs. What ailed thee, O thou Sea?</HI> By which Que&s;tion he means to expre&s;s the Reality of the <HI>Mira|cle,</HI> and that it was not the Effect of any na|tural Cau&s;e. So the <HI>Violent Earthquake</HI> that &s;hook the Apo&s;tles <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> out of their Chains, and converted the <HI>Jaylour</HI> was doubt|le&s;s extraordinary, and &s;ent of GOD on pur|po&s;e to accompli&s;h the&s;e things. And I &s;up|po&s;e none will deny but that the repeated Earthquakes at our Saviour's <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Re|&s;urrection</HI> were <HI>miraculous;</HI> as the <HI>Ecclip&s;e</HI> of the Sun was at that time, which according to Nature was impo&s;&s;ible; and de&s;ign'd for Tokens of GOD's Anger at the horrid Fact, and for the Conviction of that &s;tupid Nation that the Per&s;on they had &s;o ba&s;ely treated was more than a Man.</P>
<P>THE Earthquake in <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> which we read of <HI>Amos</HI> 1.1. <HI>Zech.</HI> 14. was an imme|diate Judgment of GOD upon <HI>Uzziah</HI> for in|vading the Prie&s;t's Office. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays that it rent their <HI>Temple</HI> in the mid&s;t at the very time when he was offering Incen&s;e, and that a great Light of the Sun broke in at the Cha&s;m, and reflected on the King's Face, and
<PB N="19" REF="002833_0012_0FE6728CBB213CD0">in|&s;tantly over&s;pread his whole Body with a Lepro&s;y; he adds, that half a Mountain was thrown down by it, and rolled upon the Ground for the &s;pace of four Stadia or Fur|longs, and then re&s;ted upon the King's Gar|dens. And now from the&s;e In&s;tances may we not rea&s;onably think, that GOD &s;ometimes immediately and in way of Admonition or Pu|ni&s;hment vi&s;its a People with Earthquakes.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>EARTHQUAKES are produced by the agency of &s;econd Cau&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>THE great former of the <HI>Earth</HI> has un|doubtedly &s;o made it as to &s;erve His eternal De&s;ign in this awful Di&s;pen&s;ation; and then he has endowed the Cele&s;tial and Elementary World with &s;uch Virtues and Powers as to produce &s;uch an Effect; and though He has not obliged him&s;elf always to act by the e&s;|tabli&s;h'd Laws of Nature, yet He ordinarily does. Thus He produces the Fruits of the Earth by the Influences of the Sun and Moon; and thus He brings on the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Revolu|tions of Day and Night in a natural Way, and the quaternial Sea&s;ons of the Year, by the Suns pa&s;&s;ing thro' &s;uch and &s;uch Signs of the <HI>Zodiack.</HI></P>
<P>BUT now what are the natural Cau&s;es of Earthquakes, Men of the greate&s;t Sagacity and deepe&s;t Penetration, can but gue&s;s. And hence ari&s;es the great Diver&s;ity of Thought about them, one fixing upon this thing, ano|ther
<PB N="20" REF="002833_0013_0FE6724CDD7E3F48">upon that, which &s;eems to them mo&s;t probable.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Ancient Heathen</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed them to proceed from the <HI>Fluctuations</HI> of Waters in the Subterraneous <HI>Caverns,</HI> and celebrated <HI>Neptune</HI> as the Cau&s;e of them; but this hath no Solid Foundation.</P>
<P>OTHERS tell us that a &s;trong <HI>Windy Exha|lation</HI> impri&s;oned in the Bowels of the Earth and wanting Vent, makes an Earthquake; this al&s;o is liable to Exception, it being altogether impo&s;&s;ible in Nature that the Wind can have &s;o &s;wift a Currency thro' the Earth as to &s;hake it for five hundred Miles in length within a few Minutes of time; for if we &s;uppo&s;e a <HI>Can|non</HI> &s;hot, which glides much &s;wifter thro' the Air then the &s;tronge&s;t bla&s;t of Wind, flies after the rate of a League in a minute; according to that Computation it mu&s;t be near three Hours and half in going 500 Miles, or if we double the Motion it mu&s;t be one Hour and half, which is above a full Hour more than the di&s;tance of time betwixt the late Earth|quake's being felt at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and at <HI>Arow&s;ick.</HI></P>
<P>THAT Opinion which to me carries in it the greate&s;t Probability of Truth is this; That <HI>Subterraneous Fires</HI> occa&s;ion'd by the <HI>Fer|mentation</HI> of combu&s;tible Minerals in the Earth, &s;uch as <HI>Sulpher, Salt-Petre, Vitriol</HI> &amp;c. are the cau&s;e of this <HI>Prodigy.</HI> The&s;e Fires being made of the &s;ame Matter with <HI>Lightning,</HI> fly as the Lightning does with an incredible
<PB N="21" REF="002833_0013_0FE6724CDD7E3F48">Swiftne&s;s, and carry in them an irre&s;i&s;table Force, and give the Earth tho&s;e violent Shocks we have lately felt; but whether this &s;olves the Matter, I don't pretend to &s;ay, I &s;hall leave it to them who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is more properly to &s;earch into it.</P>
<P>BUT let the <HI>natural Cau&s;es</HI> be what they will, this is mo&s;t certain, that they are all in the <HI>Hand,</HI> and entirely &s;ubject to the <HI>Will of GOD.</HI> We may not think that He has thrown off the Government of them, and left them to effect what is in their own Power! What wild Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion would this create in the World? No verily! He guides and directs, re&s;trains and limits them, or gives them a Liberty according to the De&s;ign He is to accompli&s;h by them; and from hence it is that we are to attribute all to Him; both the good we enjoy, and the Evils we &s;uffer. What Foundation for Prayer to him would there be, either to prevent Judgments or to confer Ble&s;|&s;ings: What Dependance could we have up|on him, to protect us in our Dangers, or do any thing at all for us, if he had not the ac|tual Command of all the &s;prings of Nature? So that to re&s;olve all Events into natural Cau&s;es is derogatory to the Honour of GOD, and the direct Cour&s;e to bani&s;h all Religion out of the World, and will prove of fatal Con&s;equence to all who adhere to it. All his <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> are but meer <HI>Cheat</HI> and Delu&s;ion, and his <HI>Threatnings ridiculous Terrors,</HI> and worthy of no Regard, if &s;uch a Per&s;wa&s;ion
<PB N="22" REF="002833_0014_0FE6724E071BDAD0">is true; and for Men under the influence of this Principle to apply to him to make good his Promi&s;es, or not to execute his Threat|nings, is the mo&s;t provoking Mockery, &s;ince according to them, He can accompli&s;h neither.</P>
<P>GOD every where in His Word challenges the Honour of being the immediate <HI>ab&s;olute Governour</HI> of the World, and this we mu&s;t firmly believe He is; and as his Perfections take their turns to act and di&s;play them&s;elves, &s;o we mu&s;t ob&s;erve the Order of them, and give them the Honours which are re&s;pectively due to them. <HI>I will &s;ing of Mercy and Judg|ment, unto thee O Lord will I &s;ing.</HI> And thus in particular we mu&s;t acknowledge that GOD is the Cau&s;e of <HI>Earthquakes.</HI> He that &s;upports and guides the <HI>Orbs of Light</HI> and Fire over our Heads, holds in his Hand the <HI>rolling World</HI> under our Feet, and makes it tremble and &s;hake when he plea&s;es; and without any &s;train of Power can disjoin the infinite Parti|cles whereof it con&s;i&s;ts, and cau&s;e them to di&s;|per&s;e and wander in the Air, at a wide di&s;|tance from one another.</P>
<P>HE that in Strength has <HI>&s;et fa&s;t</HI> the <HI>Moun|tains,</HI> can <HI>take them off</HI> from their <HI>ancient Ba|&s;is,</HI> and tran&s;plant them remote from where they &s;tood. Or he can &s;o convul&s;e the Earth as that it &s;hall throw Mountains out of her Bowels upon the level Ground, or in the Sea. He can cau&s;e the dry and &s;olid Earth to &s;well and ri&s;e like the Waves of the Sea under our

<P>AS to the di&s;tinct <HI>kinds</HI> of Earthquakes, and their <HI>Antecendentia</HI> or Progno&s;ticks which <HI>Phi|lo&s;ophers</HI> &s;peak of, I &s;hall &s;ay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Excepting in one In&s;tance, the like having happened with us, It is one preceeding Sign of an Earthquake, &s;ays my Au|thor, when the Water in deep Pits or Wells, is from an invi&s;ible Cau&s;e put into Motion, or gives a di&s;agreeable Ta&s;te or Smell. The latter of the&s;e Signs, &s;everal of my Neighbours, three at lea&s;t, have had in their Wells: About <HI>3</HI> days before the Earth|quake they perceiv'd an ill &s;tinking Smell in the Water, and not thinking of the proper Cau&s;e, &s;earched the Wells, but finding nothing that might thus infect them, were at a Lo&s;s into what to re&s;olve it, till &s;ome Days &s;ince the Earthquake being in|form'd that Earthquakes &s;ometimes had &s;uch an Influence up|on Wells, judged it to be that. The Scent was &s;o &s;trong and offen&s;ive that they could not &s;uffer the Water in their Hou&s;es, and for about <HI>8</HI> or <HI>10</HI> Days they entirely omitted the u&s;e of them. In the deepe&s;t of the&s;e Wells which was <HI>36</HI> feet, the Water turn'd to a Brim&s;tone colour, but had nothing of the Smell of it, and was thick like puddle Water.

<P>THE World has been alarm'd by <HI>Earth|quakes,</HI> and the <HI>tragical Effects</HI> of them have rendred them formidable to all Nations; e&s;pe|cially of late they have been numerous. A
<PB N="24" REF="002833_0015_0FE6724E2D5FDC28">learned Writer has reckon'd up near <HI>Forty,</HI> that have happen'd in about <HI>Thirty Years;</HI> which as he &s;ays are more than the World has known for &s;everal <HI>Centuries</HI> before; and &s;ince 1713, which is the date of his Account, there have been &s;everal, as in <HI>Sicily, China, Jamaica, England, Paris,</HI> and now in <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>De&s;ign</HI> of GOD in Earthquakes is not always the &s;ame; and from hence it follows that the <HI>Effects</HI> of them are different; &s;ome|times they come in <HI>Mercy;</HI> but for the mo&s;t part in <HI>Judgment;</HI> &s;ometimes they are &s;ent to <HI>admoni&s;h</HI> a &s;inful People, and often to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the Terror of them has been comparatively little, the Roar and Shake being both &s;mall, and they pa&s;s off without Harm; and then &s;ometimes they are terrible beyond Expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES they have rais'd up <HI>I&s;lands</HI> in the Sea, and thrown out Fire, Sand and Rocks almo&s;t as high as to the very Clouds, to the A&s;toni&s;hment of poor Sailors.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES they have turned the <HI>Cour&s;e of Rivers,</HI> and cau&s;ed Rivers to break out in new Places.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES they have divided Kingdoms and Countries, as <HI>Britain</HI> from <HI>France, Africa</HI> from <HI>Spain,</HI> and <HI>Sicily</HI> from <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>SOMETIMES they have cau&s;ed violent Eruptions of Fire out of the Earth, and di&s;co|vered new burning Mountains.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="002833_0015_0FE6724E2D5FDC28">
SOMETIMES they have &s;haken down many Thou&s;ands of Hou&s;es, Churches and Ca&s;tles &amp;c. and made very <HI>flouri&s;hing Cities</HI> almo&s;t <HI>ruin'd Heaps.</HI></P>
<P>SOMETIMES they have &s;wallowed up ma|ny Cities and Towns without leaving any Mark at all of them; they have &s;unk as Lead in the mighty Waters.</P>
<P>THUS it was in <HI>Sicily</HI> in the Year 1693, of which Prodigy my <HI>Author</HI> writes that on Fri|day <HI>January 9.</HI> after a warm &s;erene and calm Day, the Earth began to tremble &s;uddenly; the fir&s;t &s;hake was attended as is common, with a hollow thundring noi&s;e, and &s;ucceeded by another early the next Morning; but on the Day following viz. 11, happen'd a third which was &s;tupendous beyond human Imagination which almo&s;t totally de&s;troyed 20 or more Ci|ties and Towns, and above one hundred Thou&s;and Inhabitants, after which va&s;t De|&s;truction, the Earth continued trembling at times for &s;everal Months.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>Earthquake</HI> was preceeded like ours with <HI>Southerly Winds,</HI> extreme heat and terri|ble Storms of Thunder and Lightning, and after this, profu&s;e Rains.</P>
<P>THE Earthquake at <HI>Port-Royal</HI> in <HI>Jamaica</HI> the Year before this <HI>June</HI> 7. at noon was ve|ry terrible, Rocks and Mountains were over|turned, and all the Buildings in the Town fell, whole Streets were &s;wallowed up; both Hou&s;es and Inhabitants went down together.
<PB N="26" REF="002833_0016_0FE6725644606C20">Some were killed by the fall of Hou&s;es, &s;ome were wounded, &s;ome were floted off to Sea upon pieces of Timber &amp;c. and &s;o peri&s;hed. Others that were falling to the Earth, by its clo&s;ing together again on a &s;udden were catch|ed, &s;ome by the Legs, others by the Neck, &amp;c. and &s;ome that were actually fallen into it's Caverns were thrown out again by the vio|lent Eruption of Waters.</P>
<P>AND then, the late <HI>China</HI> Earthquake, was very awful: this fell out <HI>June</HI> 19. 1719. and was &s;o violent as to remove Mountains two full Leagues over a Plain, and to &s;wallow up the Plain without leaving any Mark of Men, Hou&s;es or Animals. In another Place the Earth opened, and a Mountain was rolled down upon the Town, and in the twinkling of an Eye the Town was &s;wallowed up, and the Plain ro&s;e in Waves &s;ix fathom.</P>
<P>BUT above all that the World has known, was that at <HI>Antioch</HI> in the <HI>&s;econd Century</HI> after CHRIST, and tho' of long &s;tanding yet it de|&s;erves to be recogni&s;ed, and &s;poken of to the Honour of GOD, and the terror of Men as long as the Sun and Moon &s;hall endure. The whole City was de&s;troy'd by this Earthquake, not an Hou&s;e left; almo&s;t incredible Num|bers were killed and wounded; for it hap|pen'd at &s;uch a time when they were met to|gether from all Parts of the Empire at the Command of <HI>Trajan</HI> their Emperor. All the
<PB N="27" REF="002833_0016_0FE6725644606C20">Elements con&s;pired in their ruin. The Thun|ders roared from above, the Earth &s;haking be|low, and an horrible Tempe&s;t of Wind, and as the Effect of the&s;e the Sea raging, the Hou&s;es and City Walls falling; and all toge|ther made &s;uch a Noi&s;e and thick Du&s;t that they were not able to &s;ee the Faces, or hear the Voices of one another. And when all was over, and the Survivors &s;aw the De&s;truc|tion of their City, and the heaps of dead Bodies in all places, they were ready to wi&s;h to have undergone the fate of their Brethren, rather than live to behold &s;uch deplorable Ruins.</P>

<P>I &s;hall here in&s;ert a <HI>&s;hort Narrative</HI> of this awful Di&s;pen&s;ation, and &s;o conclude this <HI>Pro|po&s;ition.</HI></P>
<P>IT begun as I conceive in the <HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> about half an Hour after Ten in the <HI>Lord's-Day Evening</HI> after the 29th of <HI>October,</HI> 1727.

<P>THE Surpri&s;e and Terror of it were very great: &s;ome thought their Hou&s;es were all on Fire about them, and made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to e&s;cape the Burning; others who were free from this Fear, were &s;eized with the Terrors of the <HI>La&s;t Day,</HI> and could think of nothing but the <HI>di&s;&s;olving World,</HI> the &s;ound of the <HI>la&s;t Trumpet,</HI> and the &s;udden Appearance of <HI>CHRIST</HI> their Judge; others expected to die by the falling of their Hou&s;es, or that the Earth under them would open, and they &s;hould go down alive into the Pit. Words can't expre&s;s the <HI>Agonies</HI> that our Souls were in; our Faces were pale as A&s;hes, our Lips quivered, our Speech faultred, and our Knees &s;mote together, and there was no &s;trength left in us; <HI>Our Fle&s;h then trembled for fear of GOD, and we were afraid of his Judgments.</HI> And we were ready, like the Men of <HI>Judah,</HI> to have fled, if we had known where, becau&s;e of the Earthquake. And thus I have con&s;i|dered the <HI>fir&s;t Particular</HI> that I propounded to &s;peak to; viz. <HI>That Thunder and Earthquake
<PB N="29" REF="002833_0017_0FE6725671CF7AE8">are the awful Vi&s;itations of GOD to a People</HI> And now proceed to the <HI>Second,</HI> namely this</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>GOD's terrible Vi&s;its to a People by Thun|der and Earthquake are evident Te&s;timo|nies of his Anger.</HI></P>
<P>THE efficient Cau&s;e of Earthquakes is the Power of GOD, the final is the Signification of his Anger moved by the execrable Crimes of a wicked People, according to that of the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. 18.7. <HI>Then the Earth &s;hock and trembled, the Foundations of the Hills mo|ved and were &s;haken, becau&s;e he was Wroth.</HI> The very <HI>Heathen</HI> have accounted Earth|quakes Tokens of GOD's Di&s;plea&s;ure, and ac|cordingly they prayed and offered Sacrifice to avert his Wrath. The <HI>Romans</HI> pa&s;&s;ed it into a Law that Prayers &s;hould be made to GOD in time of an Earthquake: And verily &s;o great Occa&s;ion there is for this, that it is &s;trange any one that has a Mouth to &s;peak to Him, &s;hould be &s;ilent at &s;uch a Time.</P>
<P>WE read of &s;ome Earthquakes that have been &s;ent <HI>in Mercy;</HI> but for the mo&s;t part they come <HI>in Wrath,</HI> and are the Threatnings or Executions of <HI>Divine Ju&s;tice.</HI> 'Tis no <HI>Hy|perbole</HI> to &s;ay that Sin &s;ets the Heavens on Fire over us, and the Earth under our Feet. That Earthquakes are Evidences of GOD's Anger appears from his Threatnings to vi&s;it a &s;inful People with them, and from the fear|ful
<PB N="30" REF="002833_0018_0FE6725A5C009440">De&s;olations he has brought upon the World by them; for it is an offended GOD that is a <HI>con&s;uming Fire.</HI> Yea, they are not Marks of common Anger, but of Wrath en|flamed; for GOD ob&s;erves a Proportion and Gradation in his Judgments, as the Sins of a People ri&s;e and multiply; and Earthquakes are ju&s;tly reckoned among his mo&s;t terrible Judgments, <HI>Matth.</HI> 24. &mdash;</P>
<P>'TIS certain that GOD can be angry at nothing but Sin, and there had never been the lea&s;t &s;park of Indignation in Him towards Mankind, if Sin had not occa&s;ion'd it. 'Tis Sin that turns the Heart of GOD again&s;t us, converts his Care into Neglect, his Ble&s;&s;ings into Cur&s;es, and makes the Arrows of his Vengeance go forth as Lightning, fly &s;wift and far; &s;catter and de&s;troy his People.</P>
<P>WHEREVER we read in the <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of the <HI>Jews,</HI> of their &s;uffering State we are told, That Sin was the Cau&s;e. GOD never would have drawn his Sword again&s;t them, but to avenge the Quarrel of his Covenant. It is for the <HI>unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of Men</HI> that the <HI>Wrath of GOD is revealed from Heaven.</HI> So that when He vi&s;its a People with Earthquake, they mu&s;t charge the Fault upon them&s;elves, and &s;et His Throne guiltle&s;s, &s;aying, <HI>Righte|ous art thou, O LORD, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t judg|ed thus.</HI></P>
<P>THE Series of <HI>awful Providences</HI> the Lord of Ho&s;ts has vi&s;ited this People with of late
<PB N="31" REF="002833_0018_0FE6725A5C009440">are evident Tokens that His Anger is out again&s;t us. It has been an extraordinary Year, not any that we have known like it in &s;ome re&s;pects; early in the <HI>Spring</HI> we were &s;ur|pri&s;ed with &s;everal very <HI>&s;udden Deaths,</HI> Per|&s;ons falling down Dead as they walked the Streets, as Mr. <HI>Hir&s;t,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Summer</HI> was remarkable for extream Heat, by which &s;ome al&s;o died &s;uddenly; and for mo&s;t <HI>awful Thunder</HI> and Lightning. After this we had the violent <HI>Storm of Wind</HI> which threatned us with the De&s;truction of our Hou&s;es, and made us think our &s;elves in the greate&s;t Danger from tho&s;e Places of common Safety. And now the <HI>terrible Earthquake:</HI> Thus a provoked GOD has been repeating his awful Vi&s;its, one in a &s;hort time after another. And what do all the&s;e &s;peak, but his hot An|ger again&s;t us; and that Man is certainly under a judicial Blindne&s;s, and his Heart like <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s is hardned under Judgments, who makes light of &s;uch Di&s;pen&s;ations.</P>
<P>THUS GOD's late vi&s;it to this People by Earthquake is a Te&s;timony of his Anger, and this I doubt not but we &s;hall all readily ac|knowledge; but then the difficulty lies in rightly &s;tating the Matter, and &s;aying who are the faulty Cau&s;es; for &s;ome who have as deep a &s;hare it may be in the Of|fence as any, will be very loth to own they have any Hand at all in it, and &s;hift off the
<PB N="32" REF="002833_0019_0FE6725A8B1AD988">Blame to others. They &s;ee as they imagine a <HI>Beam</HI> in their Neighbours Eye, but a <HI>Mote</HI> in their own; when in reality the Beam is theirs, and the Mote their Neighbours: But thus partial are Men in their own Ca&s;e, and by thus mi&s;applying the Pla&s;ter, the Wound remains, corrupts and putrifies, and affords many a threatning Symptom to the Body.</P>
<P>IN &s;uch an <HI>Evil Day</HI> as this we mu&s;t every one look at home, <HI>examine his own Heart,</HI> &s;e|riou&s;ly propo&s;e the Que&s;tion to him&s;elf, <HI>What have I done?</HI> And charge him&s;elf in the Name of GOD to give a ju&s;t and full An&s;wer to it. And upon a &s;trict Review of his Ac|tions, every one will find enough ami&s;s in him&s;elf to bring down the awful Judgments of Heaven upon his own Head. We are certainly <HI>all faulty;</HI> there are none among us but have dealt wickedly; yea among the <HI>faithful</HI> there is none that has not done <HI>ami&s;s,</HI> and highly offended.</P>
<P>THERE is no Rank or Degree of Men to be acquitted.</P>
<P>IS there not too much of a <HI>&s;elfi&s;h and con|tracted Spirit</HI> in too many that are intru&s;ted with the publick Intere&s;ts of this People? And is it not mo&s;t evident that there is too little Regard had to the Execution of the Laws of the Province upon bold Offenders; and though Iniquity appears bare-faced, yet it goes unpuni&s;hed. Some in Authority want
<PB N="33" REF="002833_0019_0FE6725A8B1AD988">Courage, others ('tis to be feared) Con&s;ci|ence to pro&s;ecute the Actors of it; and by this Neglect a private per&s;onal Offence be|comes publick, and the whole mu&s;t &s;uffer for it.</P>
<P>AND may not the <HI>Mini&s;ters of Religion</HI> charge them&s;elves with too much <HI>Sloth</HI> and Negligence in their great Work? Oh! Have they been enough concerned about the Wel|fare and Happine&s;s of the precious Souls of their People. I do mo&s;t freely own my &s;elf chargeable with many Defects, and fly to the great and common Saviour for Pardon and Mercy. Has not a <HI>worldly Spirit</HI> too much the A&s;cendant over many of us? The hot and fierce Debates about Sallaries, may not, I fear, be every where imputed to real Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>BUT then this People would do well to in|quire, Whether they are chargeable with no Omi&s;&s;ions as to their Mini&s;ters; but that they have in all Re&s;pects a proper Notice taken of them.</P>
<P>HOW little Regard is paid to the Law of the <HI>Fourth Commandment.</HI> Worldly Concerns too often croud out the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Preparati|on for the <HI>Sabbath.</HI> Many are late from Home on Saturday-Evenings, who &s;hould be with their Families, Reading, Catechi&s;ing and In&s;tructing their Children and Servants. And is there not a &s;candalous Neglect of the
<PB N="34" REF="002833_0020_0FE672626A4C56B0">publick Wor&s;hip upon the Lord's-Day and Lecture-Days, generally through the Land. And then Sabbath-Day Evenings are &s;pent by very many in unnece&s;&s;ary Vi&s;its, vain Company &amp;c. And has not the jealous GOD, jealous of His Sabbath been dreadfully te&s;ti|fying His Abhorrence of &s;uch Practices by the Storm and by the Earthquake on the Saturday and Sabbath Evening?</P>
<P>LET Sabbath-breakers then take the&s;e aw|ful Admonitions, let them hear and fear and do no more &s;o wickedly&mdash;</P>
<P>IS not the <HI>Table of CHRIST neglected,</HI> and thereby His plain Law violated by very many; and is there a due Care taken by Church-Members that they may <HI>worthily re|ceive</HI> the con&s;ecrated Elements?</P>
<P>AND then, are not <HI>Pride, Oppre&s;&s;ion, Pro|phane Swearing, Drunkenne&s;s, Adultery</HI> &amp;c. crying Sins of this People?</P>
<P>AND now, &s;eeing there are all the&s;e (and many more) <HI>evil Deeds and great Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es</HI> to be found among&s;t all Orders of Men, we can be at no Lo&s;s for the de&s;erving Cau&s;es of GOD's Controver&s;y with us. This People need not make that Inquiry, <HI>Shew me where|fore thou contende&s;t with me?</HI> As if we were wholly in the dark about the Matter, and the Sin like <HI>Achan</HI>'s, was &s;ome great Secret; when the Rea&s;ons of His Anger are as evi|dent
<PB N="35" REF="002833_0020_0FE672626A4C56B0">as the Sun at Noon-Day. And his Anger won't be turned away, but <HI>His Hand will be &s;tretched out &s;till,</HI> unle&s;s the&s;e Evils are reformed. Which brings me to the <HI>third Particular,</HI></P>
<P>Namely this,</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>THE profe&s;&s;ing People of GOD may very ju&s;tly expect His awful Vi&s;its by Thunder and Earthquake, &s;o long as they per&s;i&s;t in Sin.</HI></P>
<P>SEEING Sin is the Cau&s;e of GOD's Anger, we can't rationally think that He will be re|conciled to us &s;o long as that is unrepented of and per&s;i&s;ted in, and then what can be ex|pected from an angry GOD but Thunder and Earthquake &amp;c. His Wrath can't burn again&s;t a People, but they will be made &s;en&s;i|ble of it by &s;ome terrible Judgment or other. Not to puni&s;h them, but to own and protect a People that practically di&s;own Him, would be to patronize their Sin, and take part with His Enemies again&s;t Him&s;elf, which &s;urely no Man in his Wits would do; much le&s;s may we &s;uppo&s;e it of GOD only wi&s;e, and His Throne holy.</P>
<P>'TIS a mighty Aggravation of Sin to con|tinue in it after a great Variety of Methods u&s;ed by GOD to reclaim us, and what can we expect but that He will &s;ay of us as He &s;aid
<PB N="36" REF="002833_0021_0FE6726291C9CD70">of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> he <HI>is joined to Idols, let him alone.</HI> Since he is irreclaimable both by Mercies and Judgments, I will leave him to &s;in him&s;elf into final Ruin.</P>
<P>IT extremely provokes GOD when a Peo|ple harden them&s;elves in Sin after Judgments, as it directly contradicts his De&s;ign in puni&s;h|ing them, and bids an open Defiance to his Power and Ju&s;tice, and is an implicit chal|lenging the Almighty to do his wor&s;t. The plain Language of &s;uch Ob&s;tinacy is that, <HI>I know not the Lord,</HI> neither will I let my Sins go. There is not a more &s;ad and certain Pre&s;age of Ruin to a People than this, it looks as if GOD had utterly rejected &s;uch a People, and had no further u&s;e to make of them but only to puni&s;h them, this is plainly intimated by the Prophet <HI>Ezra</HI>'s Confe&s;&s;ion and Prayer, Ezra 9. <HI>After all that is come up|on us for our evil Deeds, and great Tre&s;pa&s;s,</HI> after all the Judgments that are come upon us to reform us, and after all the Mercies that are be&s;towed upon us to engage us to thee and Duty, <HI>&s;hould we again break thy Com|mandments, &mdash; woulde&s;t thou not be angry with us till thou had&s;t con&s;umed us, &s;o that there &s;hould be no remnant nor e&s;caping.</HI> And the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> threatned <HI>Judah</HI> with a to|tal Overthrow, for their Contempt of the Tokens of GOD's Anger, Jer. 44.10. <HI>There|fore thus &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts, I will &s;et my Face again&s;t you for Evil, and out off all Judah.</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="002833_0021_0FE6726291C9CD70">Which Prediction was an&s;wered, and they are groaning under the Accompli&s;hment of it to this very Day.</P>
<P>AND indeed there &s;eems to be a Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a Proceedure with a &s;tubborn People, for what el&s;e can be done with them. To let them alone in their Sins after all, looks di&s;honourable to GOD, as if He wanted Wi&s;|dom or Power to controul their Exorbitan|ces; or to bring them to a &s;uitable Puni&s;h|ment, His Mercy is the only Attribute he can think to glorify by &s;uch a Delay, and this al|ready &s;uffers, His Pity and Patience are a|bu&s;ed, and they are ready to re&s;olve the Su&s;|pen&s;ion of his de&s;tructive Threats into &s;ome|thing el&s;e than meer Lenity and Goodne&s;s, and thus His Power is &s;lighted, and the bright Character of his Holine&s;s is &s;lurr'd, as if they were beyond the reach of His Arm, and He could not puni&s;h them, or He was too much like what they are to have any Di&s;po&s;ition to it, &s;o that it &s;eems to be high time for GOD to pour His Wrath to the uttermo&s;t upon &s;uch a People, and thereby manife&s;t that He is a GOD hating Iniquity, and both able and faithful to execute His Threatnings. We are plainly told <HI>Lev.</HI> 26. from ver. 14. to ver. 40. what an incorrigible People may expect from GOD.</P>
<P>LET not this People then, becau&s;e they have outliv'd the Earthquake, think their
<PB N="38" REF="002833_0022_0FE67265E1D46A68">Danger is over; that Ju&s;tice has no further Work and &s;o return to their Sins again. If we are not reformed by the <HI>Threatning,</HI> we have Rea&s;on to fear being ruin'd by the <HI>Execution.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Fourth</HI> and la&s;t <HI>Particular</HI> is this</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>THUNDER and Earthquake are loud Calls to Repentance; and the Re|formation of this People is the only Me|thod of Safety to be taken by us under the&s;e awful Tokens of GOD's Anger.</HI></P>
<P>THE Lord of Ho&s;ts thus be&s;peaks the Bo|dy of this People by the&s;e Providences; <HI>Re|turn and &s;eek thy GOD O I&s;rael;</HI> both great and &s;mall are comprehended in it, Rulers and ruled, Mini&s;ters and their People, Old and Young, Rich and Poor, Bond and Free. O that he would &s;peak it to all our Hearts, and give us the Grace of Repentance, as well as the Command to repent, and then it &s;hall be well with us, both we and our Seed &s;hall live.</P>
<P>HERE are <HI>two Articles</HI> I &s;hall briefly &s;peak to,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THUNDER and Earthquake are loud Calls to Repentance.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="002833_0022_0FE67265E1D46A68">
THE De&s;ign of GOD in the Earthquake was evidently not to de&s;troy, but reclaim us. So that how much &s;o ever it carries in it the Face of Wrath, it may eventually prove a great Mercy, if it is not our own Fault. The Fire of Affliction is to con&s;ume our Lu&s;ts; <HI>By this &s;hall the Iniquity of Jacob be purged.</HI> We are cha&s;tned of the Lord for our Amend|ment. GOD who is rich in Mercy, and does not afflict willingly, would not thus ter|rify and di&s;tre&s;s us, if there was no need of it; if our Forgetfulne&s;s of Him, and Duty did not call for it. It is to &s;hake Sin out of it's Inhabitants, that the Lord &s;haketh thus terribly the Earth.</P>
<P>HE calls us to think &s;ericu&s;ly of what we have done again&s;t Him, to own our Inju&s;tice in it, and expre&s;s our Penitence for it. And He expects that we come before him this Day in the mo&s;t humble and &s;elf-aba&s;ing Manner, mourning every one for His own Sins, and for the Sins of this People.</P>
<P>OUR Con&s;ciences are called upon by the Earthquake to do their Office, to charge Sin upon us wherein we have been guilty. That we may <HI>humble our &s;elves under the mighty Hand of GOD;</HI> that we may <HI>abhor our &s;elves, and repent in Du&s;t and A&s;hes.</HI> The Ex|hortation from GOD is that, &s;oel 2.13. <HI>Blow the Trumpet in Zion, &s;anctify a Po&s;t, call a &s;olemn A&s;&s;embly, gather the Children
<PB N="40" REF="002833_0023_0FE6726614158E48">and tho&s;e that &s;uck the Brea&s;ts: let the Bride|groom go forth of his Chamber, and the Bride out of her Clo&s;et. Let the Prie&s;ts, the Mini&s;ters of the Lord weep between the Porch and the Altar, and let them &s;ay, Spare thy People. Turn ye unto me with all your Heart, and with fa&s;ting add with weeping, and with mourning, and rent your Heart, and not your Garments, and turn unto the Lord.</HI> Let it not be &s;aid of us as of them, I&s;ai. 22.12, 13. <HI>In that Day did the LORD GOD of Ho&s;ts call to Weeping, and to Mourning, and to Baldne&s;s, and to girding with Sackcloth. And behold Joy and Gladne&s;s, &s;laying Oxen, and killing Sheep, eating Fle&s;h, and drinking Wine; let us eat and drink, for to morrow we die.</HI> This is to pervert the Intention of the Threat|ning, for it is &s;ent for this End, that we may &s;ee the Evil and ta&s;te the Bitterne&s;s of Sin; that our Hearts may be rent both for Sin; and from it; that we may mortify our Lu&s;ts, purify our &s;elves from all our carnal and &s;piritual Pollutions.</P>
<P>GOD &s;ays to us in the <HI>Earthquake,</HI> Sin mu&s;t be parted with, our Pride, Covetou&s;|ne&s;s, Worldlymindedne&s;s, Uncharitablene&s;s, Inju&s;tice, Intemperance, Sen&s;uality, &amp;c. all Ungodline&s;s.</P>
<P>AND then He calls us to devote our &s;elves entirely to Him, to avouch Him for
<PB N="41" REF="002833_0023_0FE6726614158E48">our GOD, and firmly re&s;olve that for the time to come, if He &s;hall plea&s;e in His great Mercy to &s;pare us, we will be obedient to Him in all Things, renouncing all others who claim our Service.</P>
<P>AND then, He calls us thus to return to Him without Delay, NOW, this pre&s;ent Time, and for ought we know, it may be His la&s;t Call. The Earthquake came upon us &s;uddenly and without a Minutes Warning, and it may return upon us as &s;uddenly, and with much greater Violence, &s;o as to de&s;troy us in a Moment.</P>
<P>IT highly concerns us then to <HI>hear the Rod, and who hath appointed it,</HI> and learn to &s;ub|mit our &s;elves to His preceptive Will in all Things.</P>
<P><HI>LET the wicked for&s;ake his Way, and the unrighteous Man his Thoughts, and turn unto the Lord.</HI> Let the <HI>Drunkard</HI> leave his <HI>Cups,</HI> the prophane <HI>Swearer</HI> his <HI>Oaths,</HI> the Wan|ton and <HI>Unclean</HI> his <HI>Adulteries,</HI> and every &s;ort of Sinner bid an everla&s;ting Farewell and Defiance to his Sin whatever it is. If we do thus, we have Rea&s;on to hope that GOD will &s;tay the Progre&s;s of His Judgment, and turn from His Anger that we peri&s;h not.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="002833_0024_0FE6726F2A5ABA48">
WHICH brings me to the other Article, viz.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THAT the Reformation of this People is the only Method to avert the&s;e awful Tokens of GOD's Anger.</HI></P>
<P>AS He has called us to repent by his Earth|quake, &s;o he has promi&s;ed Mercy to us by his Word upon this Condition, Ezek. 18.30. <HI>Repent, and turn your &s;elves from all your Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, &s;o Iniquity &s;hall not be your Ruin.</HI> Our Repentance has a powerful Influence upon GOD, &s;o as that he has obliged him|&s;elf to forgive the Sins of a penitent People. I&s;ai. 1.16 &mdash;. Ho&s;. 14.1, 4. <HI>O I&s;rael re|turn unto the Lord thy GOD,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>I will heal their Back&s;liding &mdash;.</HI> But if ye refu&s;e and rebel ye &s;hall be devour'd, the Mouth of the Lord hath &s;poken it. Which Promi&s;es are not to be looked upon as limited to the Jew|i&s;h Nation, but extend to all Nations under Heaven, that take Care to fulfil the Conditions that &s;upport them. But yet, if any &s;hould object again&s;t the&s;e Promi&s;es, I &s;hall offer one that is liable to no Exception, Jerem. 18.7, 8. <HI>At what in&s;tant I &s;hall &s;peak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to de&s;troy it. If that Nation, again&s;t whom I have pronounced, turn from their Evil, I will repent of the Evil that I thought to do unto them.</HI> And then it
<PB N="43" REF="002833_0024_0FE6726F2A5ABA48">follow, <HI>At what in&s;tant I &s;hall &s;peak concern|ing a Nation and concerning a Kingdom, to build, and to plant it. If it do Evil in my &s;ight, that it obey not my Voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I &s;aid I would benefit them.</HI></P>
<P>FROM all which appears the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of our Repentance and Reformati|on, in order to prevent our Ruin, and the infallible Certainty of our Pro&s;perity and Happine&s;s on this Condition. But without this we &s;hall not e&s;cape his righteous Judg|ments.</P>
<P>WE &s;ee then what our Bu&s;ine&s;s is with GOD this Day, and upon what Terms he will hear our Prayers, and &s;ave this People. The Reply he makes to us now we are &s;preading forth our Hands, and offering up fervent Prayers and &s;trong Cries for Mercy and Salvation, is this, <HI>Repent, Repent, Put away the Evil of your Doings from before mine Eyes,</HI> cea&s;e to do Evil, and learn to do well, &amp;c. Which if we do, we may humbly hope that he will hear us, but otherwi&s;e we pray in Vain, and our Returns will be in Wrath, and not in Mercy.</P>
<P>AND thus I have fini&s;hed the Con&s;ide|ration of the Particulars laid down in the beginning of this Di&s;cour&s;e and &s;hall endea|vour
<PB N="44" REF="002833_0026_0FE6726F545FD9D0">a brief and &s;utable Improvement of them.</P>
<P><HI>LET us all learn then to Reverence the Great GOD.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the De&s;ign of the late di&s;play of his Power in the Earthquake, and we are &s;tu|pid indeed if &s;o bright an Evidence of a boundle&s;s Strength, does not produce this Effect. The Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> ob&s;erves that <HI>when His Judgments are in the Earth, the In|habitants of the World will learn righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> I&s;ai. 26.9. He has been uttering his mighty Voice not only by Thunder, but from the Earth al&s;o to excite our Fears and reform our Lives, that we may renounce Sin as our Plague and Mi&s;ery; and chu&s;e him for our highe&s;t Lord and our only Happine&s;s, and make an intire and hearty &s;urrender and De|dication of our &s;elves to Him and his Ser|vice, and if we do thus the Con&s;equence will be happy, the thick and black Cloud of his Anger will blow over, and he will ordain Peace for us.</P>
<P>THE contemplative and admiring P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, P&s;alm 92. <HI>O Lord how great are thy Works, and thy Thoughts are very deep. A bruiti&s;h Man knoweth not: neither doth a Fool under&s;tand this.</HI> They are Fools and bruiti&s;h indeed, who don't take notice of GOD's
<PB N="45" REF="002833_0026_0FE6726F545FD9D0">Hand in the Earthquake, but bid Defiance to this Threatning of the ALMIGHTY. Some &s;uch hardned Wretches there are, as can let this tremendous Di&s;pen&s;ation of an angry GOD pa&s;s off, and not be affected with it, when the very Brutes fear and tremble. Surely this is the Temper we &s;hould be in, and the Language we &s;hould expre&s;s at &s;uch a Time as this, <HI>My Fle&s;h trembleth for Fear of Thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments.</HI> Oh! Who is able to &s;tand before this GOD? With Him is terrible Maje&s;ty. There is no Creature that has an Arm like Him, neither is there any that hath ever hardned him&s;elf again&s;t Him, and pro&s;pered. Fear the Lord all ye his Saints. <HI>Let all the Earth fear Him. Let all the Inhabitants of the World &s;tand in awe of Him,</HI> P&s;alm 33.8. and 34.9.</P>
<P><HI>LET us all ble&s;s GOD for His great Mer|cy in &s;paring our Lives in the Earthquake.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is certainly a very important Article in the Matter of our Prai&s;es, and the Grace of GOD to us herein we can't &s;ufficiently admire and celebrate. Let us then deeply impre&s;s upon our Hearts this great Deliver|ance, often reflect upon it our &s;elves, and &s;peak of it to others with Hearts full of af|fectionate Gratitude. Let us with holy <HI>David, Call upon our Souls, and all that is within us, to ble&s;s the Name of the Lord, who
<PB N="46" REF="002833_0025_0FE67270CCFA5788">has redeemed our Lives from De&s;truction,</HI> P&s;alm 103. begin.</P>
<P>LET us &s;ing with <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>I&s;rael</HI> after their great Deliverance, Exod. 15.2. <HI>The Lord is my Strength and Song, and He is be|come my Salvation. He is my GOD, and I will prai&s;e Him.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT Cau&s;e have the <HI>Unregenerate to ble&s;s GOD that they are alive, and have a little longer Time given them for Repentance?</HI> What a mi&s;erable State did the Earthquake find you in, and if you had died that Moment, what had become of your Souls to all Eternity? <HI>Better had it been for you that you had never been born.</HI> The immediate Con&s;equence of Death had been Hell and Damnation to you.</P>
<P><HI>LET us pray earne&s;tly to GOD to &s;anc|tify the Earthquake to us, and accompli&s;h all the merciful De&s;igns of it upon us.</HI></P>
<P>GOD &s;ent it doubtle&s;s for the Prevention and Cure of Sin. Let us pray that this may be the Effect, and this being obtained, let us pray for the Removal of it. 'Tis GOD only can give us help from this Trouble, and quiet the di&s;turbed Earth. He can &s;ay Peace, be &s;till, to the natural Cau&s;e of the Earthquake, and not a &s;ingle Atom of Du&s;t
<PB N="47" REF="002833_0025_0FE67270CCFA5788">&s;hall any more be di&s;turbed by it. We hope in the Mercy of GOD, together with his Power to do this for us.</P>
<P>WE learn by this Earthquake the <HI>great Uncertainty of all worldly Things, and the great Folly of Men in placing their Happine&s;s in them.</HI></P>
<P>SINCE the Earth may &s;ink, and fail us in a Moment which has the greate&s;t Stability of any Thing here, what Dependance can there be upon other Things more liable to peri&s;h?</P>
<P><HI>HOW happy are all tho&s;e who in &s;uch a Time as this have Peace with GOD.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH Per&s;ons are above all ju&s;t Fears and Dangers from an Earthquake, and may triumph with the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;alm 46.1, 2, 3. <HI>GOD is our Refuge and Strength: a very pre|&s;ent help in Trouble. Therefore will not we Fear, though the Earth be removed: and though the Mountains be carried into the mid&s;t of the Sea. Though the Waters thereof roar, and be troubled, though the Mountains &s;hake with the &s;welling thereof.</HI> No Calamity can hurt a good Man; his Faith and his Hope are as an Anchor within the Vail, and he is &s;ecure in the mid&s;t of all Storms.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="002833_0027_0FE67270F90CC450">
BUT what have Sinners to &s;upport them when <HI>GOD above</HI> them is in this terrible Manner te&s;tifying his Anger again&s;t them, and the <HI>Earth under them</HI> is &s;inking and leaving them? O deplorable State! A CHRIST in &s;uch an Hour is worth infi|nite Worlds.</P>
<P><HI>THIS Earthquake may &s;erve to &s;trengthen our Faith in the great and important Doctrine of the Re&s;urrection, &s;o far as Concerns the Power of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>FOR certainly it requires a much greater Degree of Power thus to &s;hake the Earth, than to call up a dead Body from the Grave. A Specimen of the general Re&s;ur|rection we have had by an Earthquake: Matth. 27.51, 52. <HI>And behold, the Vail of the Temple was rent in twain, from the Top to the Bottom, and the Earth did quake, and the Rocks rent, And the Graves were opened, and many Bodies of Saints which &s;lept, aro&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>LET the &s;haking Earth remind us of the <HI>Things that cannot be &s;haken. The World a|bove is a Kingdom that cannot be &s;haken.</HI> The Inhabitants there are unchangeably happy.</P>
<P>THIS World's glory pa&s;&s;eth away. The <HI>Earth</HI> is nigh unto <HI>burning,</HI> and all the ad|mirable
<PB N="49" REF="002833_0027_0FE67270F90CC450">Works both of Nature and Art &s;hall be de&s;troyed, but the <HI>third Heaven</HI> is an <HI>enduring Sub&s;tance;</HI> a Trea&s;ure there we are in no danger of lo&s;ing.</P>
<P>'TIS the Song of the Ble&s;&s;ed, <HI>This GOD is our GOD for ever and ever;</HI> And that it may be our Song, GOD of his infinite Mer|cy grant unto us for the &s;ake of JESUS CHRIST. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
