<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS UPON NEGRO SLAVERY.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Negro &s;lavery totally incon&s;i&s;tent with the principles of revealed religion and natural ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I CONCEIVE that it would become every ad|vocate of Chri&s;tianity to te&s;tify again&s;t a cu&s;|tom which is now practi&s;ed by a great part of Chri&s;tendom. I mean the cu&s;tom of en&s;laving the Africans. It is &s;aid in the go&s;pel, "thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf." It would be vain to plead that a Negro is not the neigh|bour of a white man, and that a difference of complexion will alter the nece&s;&s;ity of obeying the command of our Saviour. To plead this would be an affront to rea&s;on, as well as a direct con|tradiction to the expre&s;s declaration of chri&s;tian|ity,&mdash;For the &s;ame revelation which &s;ays, "Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf," &s;ays, that GOD "hath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth."
<PB N="6" REF="022434_0004_0FB87CBFFA345460">The words here are as comprehen&s;ive and as for|cible as any words can be to prove that men of e|very color and appearance, that Negroes, as well as the re&s;t of mankind, &s;hould be con&s;idered as their neighbours by the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t. It is fir&s;t &s;aid that GOD hath made of <HI>one blood, all</HI> nations of men, and then again it is &s;aid that the&s;e of <HI>one</HI> blood are to dwell on <HI>all</HI> the face of the earth. When therefore it can be proved that <HI>one</HI> blood &s;ignifies <HI>various</HI> bloods, that <HI>all</HI> nations &s;ignif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y <HI>&s;ome</HI> nations, and that <HI>all the face</HI> of the earth &s;ignifies only <HI>a part</HI> of the earth, then it may be proved that tho&s;e who call them|&s;elves Chri&s;tians, are not culpable in their con|duct towards the oppre&s;&s;ed Africans. St. Paul &s;ays, that the go&s;pel was de&s;igned to give free|dom to all mankind. "Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumci&s;ion nor uncircumci|&s;ion, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free, but Chri&s;t is all, and in all." Colo&s;ians iii. 11. In &s;hort, we may apply to &s;ome of the oppre&s;|&s;ors of this unhappy race of men, who perhaps may conceive from their color that they are of an inferior &s;pecies, and that they may be op|pre&s;&s;ed without guilt, what this Apo&s;tle &s;ays in another place, we may &s;ay of them, that GOD hath &s;ent them "&s;trong delu&s;ion, that they &s;hould believe a lie: that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had
<PB N="7" REF="022434_0005_0FB87CC182263778">plea&s;ure in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s." II. The&s;&s;alonians ii. 11 and 12. For have not Negroes the &s;ame figure, the &s;ame voice, the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, and the &s;ame feelings, with white men? Were they not made by the &s;ame GOD, and are they not redeemed by the &s;ame Saviour? Can it be any &s;ignification in the eye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Supreme, who the Apo&s;tle tells us "is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons," whether we are brown, or black, or white?&mdash; In the Old Te&s;tament the Prophets frequently denounce the heavie&s;t judgements upon the Jews for keeping their brethren in &s;lavery. The cau&s;e of freedom is mentioned as the cau&s;e of GOD in the Bible. Jeremiah &s;ays that the peo|ple of Jeru&s;alem made a covenant with King Hezekiah, that they &s;hould proclaim liberty un|to their &s;ervants. And afterwards he repre&s;ents the Almighty as declaring, "But ye turned and polluted my name, and cau&s;ed every man his &s;ervant, and every man his hand-maid, whom he had &s;et at liberty at their plea&s;ure, to return, and brought them into &s;ubjection, to be unto you for &s;ervants and for hand-maids:&mdash;There|fore, thus &s;aith the Lord, ye have not hearken|ed to me in proclaiming liberty every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour; be|hold I proclaim a liberty for you, &s;aith the Lord, to the &s;word, to the pe&s;tilence, and to the fa|mine, and I will make you to be removed into
<PB N="8" REF="022434_0006_0FB87CC3C2849F70">all the kingdoms of the earth." Jeremiah xxxiv. 16 and 17. The&s;e &s;evere afflictions were to be the con&s;equence of unju&s;tly keeping others in a &s;tate of &s;ervitude much milder than that with which the Negroes are oppre&s;&s;ed. The making others work without payment, which is but a trivial part of the oppre&s;&s;ion of the Negroes, was e&s;teemed by the Jewi&s;h Prophets a crime of con|&s;iderable magnitude. Jeremiah &s;ays, "Wo unto him that buildeth his hou&s;e by unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s, and his chambers by wrong; that u&s;eth his neighbour's &s;ervice without wages, and giveth him not for his work: That &s;aith I will build me a wide hou&s;e and large chambers, and cut|teth him out windows, and it is ceiled with cedar, and painted with vermilion. Shalt thou reign becau&s;e thou clo&s;e&s;t thy&s;elf with cedar? Did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgement and ju&s;tice, and then it was well with him? He judged the cau&s;e of the poor and needy, then it was well with him: Was not this to know me? &s;aith the Lord. But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetou&s;ne&s;s, and for to &s;hed innocent blood, and for oppre&s;&s;ion, and for violence to do it. Therefore, thus &s;aith the Lord concerning Jehoiakim, the &s;on of Jo&s;iah, King of Judah, They &s;hall not lament for him, &s;aying, Ah my brother! or, Ah &s;i&s;ter! They &s;hall not lament for him, &s;aying, Ah Lord! or
<PB N="9" REF="022434_0007_0FB87CC64FBE55A0">Ah his glory! He &s;hall be buried <HI>(attend ye tyrants!)</HI> with the burial of an a&s;s, drawn and ca&s;t forth beyond the gates of Jeru&s;alem." chap. xxii. ver&s;es 13&mdash;19. The &s;lavery with which the Negroes in various parts of the We&s;t Indies, and in the &s;outhern &s;tates of America, and with which the pea&s;ants in Poland, and &s;ome other countries, are afflicted, is not only oppo&s;ed by the principles of religion, but of rea&s;on and ju&s;|tice. It is well &s;aid by Dr. Black&s;tone, "I have formerly ob&s;erved that pure and proper &s;lavery does not, nay cannot, &s;ub&s;i&s;t in England; &s;uch I mean, whereby an unlimited power is given to the ma&s;ter over the life and fortune of the &s;lave. And indeed it is repugnant to rea&s;on and the principles of natural law, that &s;uch a &s;tate &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t any where. The three origins of the right of &s;lavery, a&s;&s;igned by Ju&s;tinian
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Servi fiunt aut na&s;cuntur; fiunt Jure Gentium, aut Jure Civili; na&s;cuntur ex A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cillis no&s;tris. In&s;t. I.</NOTE>, are all of them built upon fal&s;e foundations. As fir&s;t &s;lavery is held to be "Jure Gentium" from a &s;tate of captivity in war; whence &s;laves are call|ed Mancipia, qua&s;i Manu capti. The conquer|or, &s;ay the Civilians, had a right to the life of his captive, and having &s;pared that, has a right to deal with him as he plea&s;es. But it is an un|true po&s;ition, when taken generally, that by the law of nature or nations, a man may kill his
<PB N="10" REF="022434_0008_0FB87CC77A93ED08">enemy; he has only a right to kill him in par|ticular ca&s;es; in ca&s;es of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for &s;elf-defence; and it is plain this ab&s;olute nece&s;|&s;ity did not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, &s;ince the victor did not ac|tually kill him, but made him pri&s;oner. War it&s;elf is ju&s;tifiable only on principles of &s;elf-pre|&s;ervation; and therefore it gives no other right over pri&s;oners, but merely to di&s;able them from doing harm to us, by confining their per&s;ons; much le&s;s can it give a right to kill, torture, a|bu&s;e, plunder, or even to en&s;lave an enemy, when the war is over. Since, therefore, the right of <HI>making</HI> &s;laves, by captivity, depends on a &s;uppo&s;ed right of &s;laughter, that foundation failing, the con&s;equence drawn from it mu&s;t fail likewi&s;e. But &s;econdly, it is &s;aid that &s;lavery may begin "jure civili;" when one man &s;ells him&s;elf to another. This, if only meant of contracts to &s;erve or work for another, is very ju&s;t; but when applied to &s;trict &s;lavery, in the &s;en&s;e of the laws of old Rome, or modern Bar|bary, is al&s;o impo&s;&s;ible. Every &s;ale implies a price, a quid pro quo, an equivalent given to the &s;eller in lieu of what he transfers to the buy|er: But what equivalent can be given for life and liberty, both of which (in ab&s;olute &s;lavery) are held to be at the ma&s;ter's di&s;po&s;al. His pro|perty al&s;o, the very price he &s;eems to receive, devolves ip&s;o facto to his Ma&s;ter, the in&s;tant he
<PB N="11" REF="022434_0009_0FB87CC9C011CAB0">becomes his &s;lave. In this ca&s;e, therefore, the buyer gives nothing, and the &s;eller receives no|thing: Of what validity then can a &s;ale be, which de&s;troys the very principles upon which all &s;ales are founded? La&s;tly, we are told that be&s;ides the&s;e two ways by which &s;laves "fiunt," or are acquired, they may al&s;o be hereditary: "Servi na&s;cuntur," the children of acquired &s;laves, are jure naturae, by a negative kind of birth right, &s;laves al&s;o. But this being built on the two former rights, mu&s;t fall together with them. If neither captivity, nor the &s;ale of one's &s;elf, can, by the law of nature and rea&s;on, reduce the pa|rent to &s;lavery, much le&s;s can they reduce the offspring." Black&s;tone's Commentaries, vol. I. page 243. 4to. edition.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS many have been apt to pretend that the Negroes are inferior to the white people on account of their color, it may &s;erve the cau&s;e of humanity to prove this color to be the effect of climate. It has been &s;aid that the Negroes are the de&s;cendants of Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n upon whom GOD <HI>&s;et a mark.</HI> If it were not for the great number in various parts of the world who have this a&s;|&s;ertion in their mouths, it would not be worthy of a &s;erious an&s;wer. A little attention to &s;crip|ture, however, will convince us of the ab&s;ur|dity of this opinion: for we there find that all who are upon earth are the de&s;cendants of Noah and his family <HI>only.</HI> The Apo&s;tle mo&s;t certainly &s;ays the truth when he &s;ays that GOD "hath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth." If we exa|mine
<PB N="13" REF="022434_0011_0FB87CCE443875A8">the matter with due care we &s;hall al&s;o find that true Philo&s;ophy will tell us the &s;ame as the &s;cripture. It will tell us that the Negro is in every re&s;pect &s;imilar to us, only that his &s;kin, or rather the &s;kin of his ance&s;tors, has been darkened by the &s;un. If we attend to our&s;elves we &s;hall find that the part of our bodies which is expo&s;ed is of a very different color from that which is covered. If we take a piece of bread and put it to the fire for a little time it will be brown, but if it is continued there long it will be black. In the &s;ame manner it is the nature of the &s;un fir&s;t to embrown, and then to blacken the &s;kin. I my&s;elf knew a gentleman in the We&s;t-Indies, who from his engagements for a con&s;iderable part of his life u&s;ed to be almo&s;t daily expo&s;ed to the &s;un, which made him &s;o brown that he was proverbially called Mulatto Frank. The lower part of his face had as much of the Negro tinge in it as the face of a mulatto, of a per&s;on born from a white and black parent. And he, I very well knew, was de&s;cended from Engli&s;h parents, who had not the lea&s;t Negro blood in them. It has been ob&s;erved that if the black &s;kin and the frizzled head of the Negroes proceeded from the heat of the &s;un, we &s;hould find people of a &s;imilar appearance in the &s;ame parallels of latitude with Africa. This is a cir|cum&s;tance of which we have &s;ufficient evidence.
<PB N="14" REF="022434_0012_0FB87CD078BE3AD8">In Captain Carteret's account of his voyage round the world, in the years 1766, 1767, 1768, and 1769, he &s;ays, "In the night of Monday the 24th, we fell in with nine i&s;lands; they &s;tretch nearly N. W. by W. and S. E. by E. about 15 leagues, and lie, in latitude 4&deg; 36&prime; S. longitude 154&deg; 17&prime; E. according to the &s;hip's ac|count. I imagine the&s;e to be the i&s;lands which are called Ohang <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aya, and were di&s;covered by Ta&s;man; for the &s;ituation an&s;wers very nearly to their place in the French Chart, which, in the year 1756, was corrected for the King's &s;hips. The other i&s;lands Carteret's, Gower's, and Simp&s;on's, I believe had never been &s;een by an European navigator before. There is certainly much land in this part of the ocean not yet known. One of the&s;e i&s;lands is of con&s;iderable extent, the other eight are &s;carcely better than large rocks, but though they are low and flat, they are well covered with wood and abound with inhabitants. The people are black and woolly-headed like the Negroes of Africa: their weapons are bows and arrows; and they have large canoes which they navigate with a fail, one of which came near us, but they would not venture on board." Hawke&s;worth's voyages, vol. 1 pages 586 and 587, quarto edition Captain Carteret &s;ays al&s;o of New-Ireland (which is nearly in the &s;ame latitude) that "the people
<PB N="15" REF="022434_0013_0FB87CD1F7CAAF30">are black and woolly-headed like the Negroes, but have not the flat no&s;e and thick lips; and we thought them much the &s;ame people as the inha|bitants of Egmont's-I&s;land: like them they were all &s;tark naked, except a few ornaments made of &s;hells upon their arms and legs. They had, however, adopted a practice without which none of our belles and beaus are &s;uppo&s;ed to be com|pletely dre&s;t, for the hair, or rather the wool, upon their heads, was very abundantly powdered with white powder." Page 599.&mdash;Buffon, in his e&s;&s;ay on the varieties of the human &s;pecies, &s;ays "to the &s;outh of the Mariana I&s;lands, and ea&s;tward of the Moluccas, we find the land of the Papous and New-Guinea, which &s;eem to be the mo&s;t &s;outherly regions of the globe. Ac|cording to Argen&s;ola, the Papous are as black as the Caffres, have cri&s;ped hair, and a meagre di&s;agreeable vi&s;age." Vol. 3, page 92&mdash;In an|other place he &s;ays, "the Papous and other na|tions adjacent to New-Guinea, are real Negroes, and re&s;emble tho&s;e of Africa; though they are feparated from the continent, by a tract of &s;ea more than 2200 leagues over. The natives of New-Holland have a &s;trong analogy to the Hot|tentots." Page 96&mdash;Dampier (according to Buffon) &s;peaking of an i&s;land in New-Guinea, called Garret Denys, &s;ays, "that the inhabi|tants are black, robu&s;t, and well made, that they
<PB N="16" REF="022434_0014_0FB87CD4F933A188">have large round heads, and &s;hort, cri&s;ped hair, which they cut in different fa&s;hions, and paint with various colors, as red, white, and yellow." See Dampier, vol. 5, page 102. If we ca&s;t our eyes over a globe or a map of the world, we &s;hall find all the&s;e places to be in the &s;ame parallel of latitude with Africa. Buffon &s;ays, in his above mentioned e&s;&s;ay, that "the natives of the coa&s;t of New-Holland, which is &s;ituated in the 16th degree of &s;outh latitude and beyond the i&s;land of Timor, are perhaps the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of the human &s;pecies. They have no beard, and their vi&s;age is long without a feature that is agreea|ble; their hair is &s;hort, black and cri&s;ped, and their &s;kin is as black as that of the Guinea Ne|groes." He refers to Dampier, vol. 2, page 171. In "A Journal of a voyage round the World," made by Capt. Cook, in his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip the En|deavor, in the years 1768, 1769, 1770, 1771, it is &s;aid, &s;peaking of the inhabitants of New-Hol|land, in latitude 36&deg; 21&prime; S. and longitude 150&deg; 18&prime; E. variation 10&deg; 42&prime; E. "the inhabitants were entirely naked and black, but they differed from the Negroes of Africa in having long &s;trait hair, in&s;tead of wool upon their heads." Buf|fon &s;peaks of the inhabitants in the 16th degree of latitude, and Captain Cook of tho&s;e in the 36th, which may account for the difference in their hair, which is not &s;o &s;oon made cri&s;ped by the &s;un as the &s;kin is darkened.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="022434_0015_0FB87CD678F5B210">
It has been objected that if color were the ef|fect of climate, many of the inhabitants of South America would be black. There are &s;e|veral rea&s;ons why the &s;ame parallel of latitude in South America, may not be as hot as that in Africa. There are very high mountains in ma|ny parts of South America, which, with exten|&s;ive mar&s;hes, may there render the air cooler than in many parts of Africa, where they have no mountains and a &s;andy &s;oil. South America, however, is not without people who are black, and in Africa may be found &s;ome who are of a copper or an olive complexion. Buffon, &s;peak|ing of South-America, &s;ays, "Some voyagers mention a nation in Guiana, of which the na|tives are blacker than any other Indians. The Arras, &s;ays Raleigh, are nearly as black as the Negroes, are extremely &s;trong, and u&s;e poi&s;oned arrows." E&s;&s;ay on the Varieties of the Human Species, vol. 3, page 183.</P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved by &s;ome that the inhabi|tants of New-Guinea and other places, who are black and have frizzled hair, are the de&s;cendants of emigrants from Africa. This appears, how|ever, to be an ob&s;ervation totally un&s;upported by rea&s;on. New-Guinea and the&s;e places are di&s;|tant more than 6000 miles from Africa. We have no record in hi&s;tory, whatever, to make us &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch an emigration was ever prac|ti&s;ed,

<P>It is mo&s;t certain that if a white people were to emigrate to Africa, they would in the cour&s;e of time become black, and have the woolly head of the Negroes. Job Ludolphus, in his "Hi&s;|tory of Fthiopia or the Kingdom of Abe&s;&s;inia," &s;ays, "I am now about to write the Hi&s;tory of the Abe&s;&s;ines, concerning whom there have been many large but few true relations. For the&s;e people having tran&s;planted them&s;elves from the maritime regions of the Arabian Guif, into the more upland parts of Africa, &amp;c." Page 1. And in another place he &s;ays, "The Abe&s;&s;ines are generally black which they mo&s;t admire." Page 71. The Arabians are &s;warthy, it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, but they became generally black in the cour&s;e of a very few centuries from the heat of Africa. In Aftley's collection of voyages, it is mentioned, that, in the beginning of the 15th century, &s;ome Portugue&s;e &s;ettled in Africa, mar|ried with the natives, and that their de&s;cendants have now a black &s;kin and woolly head &s;imilar to other Negroes. On the other hand, if the Africans were to emigrate to colder climates their de&s;cendants would in the cour&s;e of time become white, and have long &s;ilky hair. It is a well known fact that the de&s;cendants of the Ne|groes in America become every generation

The Colchi were origi|nally Ethiopians, who &s;ettled upon the borders of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uxine or Black Sea, and their de&s;cen|dants are now proverbially called the fair Cir|ca&s;&s;ians. If we were able to prove, however, for which we cannot produce any thing like an argument, the Hypothe&s;is that color is not the effect of climate in regard to the human &s;pecies, and that the Almighty originally made &s;ome men white and &s;ome black as he made hor&s;es, yet this &s;hould not induce us to treat the Ne|groes otherwi&s;e than as our Brethren. For a black man, as well as a black hor&s;e, may have all the good properties of a white one. We are told by the Prophet that the Almighty does not con&s;ider us with affection from being white or black, from having long or frizzled hair, but he repre&s;ents him &s;aying, "The Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my foot-&s;tool, but to this man will I look who is of an humble and contrite &s;pirit, and who trembleth at my word."</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is an a&s;&s;ertion of Mr. David Hume, in his E&s;&s;ay on National Characters, that "there never aro&s;e a man of genius among Negroes." This a&s;&s;ertion is attacked, as well as many other ab&s;urd and dangerous principles of Mr Hume, with great propriety, by the celebrated Dr. Beattie, in his E&s;&s;ay on the Nature and Immuta|bility of Truth. There are two di&s;advantages again&s;t the improvement of their talents, under which the negroes labor, from which the white people are free. They are en&s;laved, and they want opportunity. Slavery depre&s;&s;es the mind, and prevents it from expanding its faculties. It has the effect which the Latin Poet a&s;cribes to intemperance.</P>
<L>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">igit humi divinae particulam aurae.</L>
<P>The late Anthony Benezet of Philadelphia, &s;eems to have been as well qualified as almo&s;t any man, to judge of the difference between the natural genius of the Negroes and the white people. He originally kept a &s;chool for be in|&s;truction of white children, and afterwards for
<PB N="21" REF="022434_0019_0FB87CDC784DA688">the in&s;truction of the blacks. He &s;ays in a little pamphlet which he publi&s;hed, that "he, as teach|er of a &s;chool e&s;tabli&s;hed by private &s;ub&s;cription in Philadelphia, for the in&s;truction of the black children and others of that people, has for many years had opportunity of knowing the temper and the genius of the Africans, particularly of tho&s;e under his tuition, who have been many of different ages; and he can with truth and &s;in|cerity declare, that he has found among&s;t them as great a variety of talents, equally capable of improvement, as among&s;t a like number of whites; and he is bold to a&s;&s;ert, that the notion entertained by &s;ome, that the blacks are inferior to the whites in their capacities, is a vulgar pre|judice, founded on the pride orignorance of their lordly ma&s;ters, who have kept their &s;laves at &s;uch a di&s;tance, as to be unable to form a right judgement of them."</P>
<P>Ignatius Sancho may be produced as an in|&s;tance of genius among Negroes under great di&s;|advantages. His letters are publi&s;hed in a vo|lume. I will tran&s;cribe his letter to the cele|brated Mr. Sterne, as it not only exhibits a fine &s;pecimen of his talents, but as it contains &s;ome|thing which may influence the mind again&s;t the dete&s;table practice of en&s;laving the Negroes.</P>

<P>IT would be an in&s;ult to your humanity (or perhaps look like it) to apologize for the liberty I am taking.&mdash; I am one of tho&s;e people whom the vulgar and illiberal call "Negurs." The fir&s;t part of my life was rather un|lucky, as I was placed in a family who judged ignorance the be&s;t and only &s;ecurity for obedience. A little reading and writing I got by unwearried application. The latter part of my life, has been, through GOD's ble&s;&s;ing, truly fortunate, having &s;pent it in the &s;ervice of the be&s;t of fa|milies in the kingdom. My chief plea&s;ure has been books &mdash;Philanthropy I adore. How very much, good Sir, am I (among&s;t millions) indebted to you for the charac|ter of your amiable Uncle Toby! I declare I would walk ten miles in the dog-days to &s;hake hands with the hone&s;t Corporal. Your Sermons have touched me to the heart, and I hope have amended it, which brings me to the point. In your tenth di&s;cour&s;e, page 78, in the &s;econd volume, is this very affecting pa&s;&s;age: "Con&s;ider how great a part of our &s;pecies, in all ages down to this, have been trod under the feet of cruel and capricious tyrants; who would neither hear their cries, nor pity th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ird &s;tre&s;|&s;es.

<P>We read of a Negro in &s;cripture who mu&s;t have been a man of genius and learning, as well as in an elevated &s;tation. We are told (Acts, chap. 8.) that he was of great authority under Candace, Queen of the Ethiopians, and that he was entru&s;ted with all her trea&s;ure It is &s;aid that he was &s;itting in his chariot, and was read|ing the Prophet I&s;aiah (probably in Hebrew) when Philip the Apo&s;tle was led by the &s;pirit to interpret the Prophet to him, and to fini&s;h his character by making him a Chri&s;tian It is &s;aid that Job Ben Solomon, a native of Africa, who was brought to the acquaintance of Sir Hans Sloane, was by him known to be a complete ma&s;|ter of the Arabian tongue, by his tran&s;lating &s;everal manu&s;cripts and in&s;criptions upon me|dals. He was thought to be a man of very ex|traordinary talents. There is a long account of him by Bluet and Moore, in A&s;tley's Collec|tion, vol. 2. The celebrated James Ram&s;ay in a pamphlet of his called, "An Enquiry into the effects of putting a &s;top to the African Slave

Farhan, a jet black Negro, was carried a boy into Arabia, and there &s;old to an officer in the Court of Imam or Prince of Yemen.

The&s;e he conducted with &s;o much propriety and addre&s;s as to attract the notice of the Prince, who took him near his per&s;on, and afterwards made him Governor of Loheia, a city on the &s;ea coa&s;t.

<P>Dr. James Derham, a Negro, who is now living, may be produced as an in&s;tance of genius. He was born in the city of Philadelphia, and became a practitioner of phy&s;ic at the Spani&s;h &s;ettlement of New-Orleans on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi.

A gentleman of my acquaintance, who is a phy&s;ician, told me that he lately &s;aw Dr. Derham in Philadelphia; and that he has a very good opinion of the Doc|tor's integrity and knowledge. He mentioned that he invited Dr. Derham to tea, and that it was with difficulty his own black &s;ervant could be prevailed upon to hand a di&s;h to him, who thought that Derham had impudently obtru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d him&s;elf into the parlour among gentlemen.</P>
<P>Olaudah Equiano, or, Gu&s;tavus Va&s;&s;a, the African, is a man of talents, as appears by the narrative of his life, which was written by him|&s;elf, and publi&s;hed in London, in 1789.

They are made in the We&s;t-Indies, with little in&s;truction, excellent carpenters, coopers, and ma&s;ons. They very commonly know the art of making &s;ugar, and &s;ome the more difficult &s;cience of di&s;tilling rum. Some of them are expert &s;wimmers and fi&s;hermen. They have an eye, like a lynx, to detect their prey. I have been delighted when in the boat with them, to &s;ee them dive to the bottom of the &s;ea, and &s;trike the &s;ea hedge-hog or other things, with an iron in&s;trument formed for that purpo&s;e.&mdash; Some of them have been known, in this &s;itua|tion, and when thus armed, to fight a &s;hark, and beat him off.

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the moral virtues of the Negroes.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT has been &s;aid by &s;ome that the Negroes are not inferior to the white people, only in the endowments of the mind, but in the virtues of the heart; and &s;ome extravagantly a&s;&s;ert that they generally po&s;&s;e&s;s he malignant &s;pirit of Cain, from whom they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be de|&s;cended. It is &s;aid by a &s;en&s;ible writer in his account of the nations of Africa. "The in|habitants of the Grain and Ivory coa&s;t are repre|&s;ented by tho&s;e that deal with them as &s;en&s;ible, courteous, and the faire&s;t traders on the coa&s;ts of Guinea. They rarely drink to exce&s;s: If any do they are &s;everely puni&s;hed by the King's order. They are &s;eldom troubled with war: If a difference happen between two nations, they commonly end the di&s;pute amicably.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the Gold and Slave coa&s;t likewi&s;e, when they are not artfully incen&s;ed a|gain&s;t each other, live in great union and friend|&s;hip, being generally well tempered, civil, tract|able, and ready to help any that need it. In
<PB N="33" REF="022434_0031_0FB87CF2F7E8A710">particular the natives of the kingdom of Whi|dah, are civil, kind, and obliging to &s;trangers. And they are the mo&s;t gentleman-like of all the negroes, abounding in good manners towards each other. The inferiors pay great re&s;pect to their &s;uperiors: So wives to their hu&s;bands, chil|dren to their parents. And they are remarkably indu&s;trious: all are con&s;tantly employed; the men in agriculture, the women in &s;pinning and weaving cotton.</P>
<P>The Gold and Slave Coa&s;ts are divided into &s;everal di&s;tricts, &s;ome governed by kings, others by the principal men, who take care each of their own town or village, and prevent or appea&s;e tumults. They puni&s;h murder and adultery &s;e|verely; very frequently with death. Theft and robbery are puni&s;hed by a fine proportionable to the goods that were taken. All the natives of this coa&s;t, though Heathens, believe there is one GOD, the author of them and all things.&mdash; They appear likewi&s;e to have a confu&s;ed appre|hen&s;ion of a future &s;tate. And accordingly e|very town and village has a place of public wor|&s;hip I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is remarkable that they have no beg|gars among them: Such is the care of the chief men in every city and village, to provide &s;ome ea&s;y labor, even for the old and weak. Some are employed in blowing the &s;mith's bellows;
<PB N="34" REF="022434_0032_0FB87CF47721EFF8">others in pre&s;&s;ing palm-oil; others in grinding colors. If they are too weak even for this, they &s;ell provi&s;ions in the market.</P>
<P>The account we have of the natives of the kingdom of Benin is, that they are a rea&s;onable and a good-natured people, &s;incere and inoffen|five, and do no inju&s;tice either to one another or to &s;trangers. They are civil and courteous: If you make them a pre&s;ent, they endeavour to re|pay it double. And if they are tru&s;ted till the &s;hip returns next year, they are &s;ure hone&s;tly to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pay the whole debt. Theft is puni&s;hed among them, although not with the &s;ame &s;everity as murder. If a man and woman of any quality, are taken in adultery, they are certain to be put to death, and their bodies thrown upon a dung-hill, and left a prey to wild bea&s;ts. They are punctually ju&s;t and hone&s;t in their dealings; and are al&s;o very charitable. The king and the great lords taking care to employ all that are ca|pable of any work. And tho&s;e that are utterly helple&s;s they keep for God's &s;ake; &s;o that here al&s;o are no beggars.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Congo and Angola are generally a quiet people. They di&s;cover a good under&s;tanding, and behave in a friendly manner to &s;trangers, being of a mild temper and affable
<PB N="35" REF="022434_0033_0FB87CF778739578">carriage. Upon the whole, therefore, the Ne|groes who inhabit the coa&s;t of Africa, from the river Senegal to the &s;outhern bounds of Angola, are &s;o far from being the &s;tupid, &s;en&s;ele&s;s, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut|i&s;h, lazy barbarians, the fierce, cruel, perfidious &s;avages, they have been de&s;cribed, that on the contrary, they are repre&s;ented by them, who had no motive to flatter them, as remarkably &s;en&s;ible, con&s;idering the few advantages they have for improving their under&s;tanding; as very indu&s;trious, perhaps more &s;o than any nation of &s;o warm a climate; as fair, ju&s;t, and hone&s;t in their dealings, unle&s;s where white men have taught them to be otherwi&s;e; and as far more mild, friendly, and kind to &s;trangers, than any of our forefathers were. Our forefathers! Where &s;hall we find at this day, among the fair faced natives of Europe, a nation generally prac|ti&s;ing the ju&s;tice, mercy, and truth, which are related of the&s;e poor black Africans? Suppo&s;e the preceding accounts are true (which I &s;ee no rea&s;on or pretence to doubt of) and we may leave England and France to &s;eek genuine ho|ne&s;ty in Benin, Congo, and Angola."&mdash; Thoughts on Slavery, by John We&s;ley, A. M. Pages 13, 14, 15, 16.</P>
<P>Some may think that the virtues of the Ne|groes are too highly extolled in this account of
<PB N="36" REF="022434_0034_0FB87CF999CA14D0">them; but I think that every impartial and in|telligent per&s;on will agree with me that, with the &s;ame advantages, there is as great likelihood of finding virtue in a Negro as in a white man. Mr. Ram&s;ay, however, in his E&s;&s;ay on the Treatment and Conver&s;ation of African Slaves in the Briti&s;h Sugar Colonies, page 262, gives an extract of a letter from a humane, intelligent &s;ea officer, in which it is &s;aid&mdash;"The Negroes along the &s;ea-coa&s;t of Africa, (particularly a|mong the French) are well-informed, ea&s;y, kind, generous, and have a better &s;en&s;e of right and wrong than any other people I ever vi&s;ited. I was thrown among them in a &s;tate of wretched|ne&s;s and &s;ickne&s;s, with twenty &s;even dying men, being abandoned by our own people, who re|fu&s;ed me a&s;&s;i&s;tance and medicines. I ca&s;t my&s;elf on the charity of &s;avages, and received more in|&s;tances of compa&s;&s;ion and goodne&s;s from them than from all Chri&s;tians I have ever known. From this exemplary be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ignity in this people, who are inhabitants about Cape Verd, may be collected the probability of introducing freedom and chri&s;tianity among them." Mon&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur A|dan&s;on in his Voyage to Senegal, the I&s;le of Goree, and the River Gambia, &s;ays&mdash;"As the i&s;land of Senegal is within the dependance of the kingdom of Oualo, the Negroes who live there, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who are free, are of that
<PB N="37" REF="022434_0035_0FB87CFAE71318F8">nation. They are, generally &s;peaking, very good-natured, &s;ociable, and obliging. Tho&s;e whom the company entertained in my &s;ervice, were Oualofs, as they call them&s;elves, or by cor|ruption, Jalofs." Page 40. And again he &s;ays&mdash;"Which way &s;oever I turned my eyes on this plea&s;ant &s;pot, I beheld a perfect image of pure nature, an agreeable &s;olitude, bounded on every &s;ide by a charming land&s;cape. The rural &s;ituation of cottages in the mid&s;t of trees; the ea&s;e and indolence of the Negroes, reclined un|der the &s;hade of their &s;preading foliage; the &s;implicity of their dre&s;s and manners; the whole revived in my mind the idea of our fir&s;t parents, and I &s;eemed to contemplate the world in its pri|mitive &s;tate." Page 54. Abbe Raynal gives us a fine in&s;tance of heroic virtue in a Negro. He &s;ays, "In America it is generally believed and a&s;&s;erted that the Africans are equally incapable of rea&s;on and virtue. The following well-authenti|cated fact will enable us to judge of this opinion.</P>
<P>An Engli&s;h &s;hip that traded in Guinea, in 1752, was obliged to leave the &s;urgeon behind, who&s;e bad &s;tate of health did not permit him to continue at &s;ea. Murray, for that was his name, was there endeavoring to recover his health, when a Dutch ve&s;&s;el drew near the coa&s;t, put the blacks in irons, whom curio&s;ity had brought
<PB N="38" REF="022434_0036_0FB87CFCB7765188">to the &s;hore, and in&s;tantly &s;ailed off with their booty.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who intere&s;ted them&s;elves for the&s;e un|happy people, incen&s;ed at &s;o ba&s;e a treachery, in&s;tantly ran to Cudjoe, who &s;topped them at his door, and a&s;ked them what they were in &s;earch of. "The white man who is with you, (replied they) who &s;hould be put to death, be|cau&s;e his brethren have carried off ours." "The Europeans (an&s;wered the generous ho&s;t) who have carried off our countrymen are barbarians, kill them whenever you can find them. But he who lodges with me is a good man, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> my friend; my hou&s;e is his fortre&s;s; I am his &s;oldier, and will defend him. Before you get at him, you &s;hall pa&s;s over my body. O my friends, what ju&s;t man would enter my doors, if I had &s;uffered my habitation to be &s;tained with the blood of an innocent man!" This di&s;cour&s;e appea&s;ed the rage of the blacks: they retired a&s;hamed of the de&s;ign that had brought them there, and &s;ome days after acknowledged to Murray him&s;elf how happy they were they had not committed a crime which would have occa|&s;ioned them perpetual remor&s;e." Ju&s;tamond's tran&s;lation of Abbe Raynal's hi&s;tory, vol. III, page 440. Mr. Ram&s;ay in his E&s;&s;ay on the Treatment and Conver&s;ion of African Slaves in
<PB N="39" REF="022434_0037_0FB87CFE384AF320">the Briti&s;h Sugar Colonies, gives the following noble in&s;tance of gratitude in a Negro. "Jo&s;eph Rachel was a black trader in Barbadoes; he dealt chiefly in the retail way, and was &s;o fair and complai&s;ant in bu&s;ine&s;s, that in a town filled with little peddling &s;hops, his doors were throng|ed with cu&s;tomers. I have often dealt with him, and found him remarkably hone&s;t and obliging. If any one knew not where to procure an article Jo&s;eph would be at pains to &s;earch it out, to &s;upply him, without making an advantage of it. In &s;hort, his character was &s;o fair, his manners &s;o generous, that the be&s;t people &s;hewed him a regard which they often deny men of their own color, becau&s;e not ble&s;&s;ed with like goodne&s;s of heart.</P>
<P>"In 1756, a fire happened which burned down great part of the town, and ruined many of the inhabitants. Jo&s;eph luckily lived in a quarter that e&s;caped the de&s;truction, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed his thankfulne&s;s, by &s;oftening the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of his neighbours. Among tho&s;e who had lo&s;t their all by this heavy misfortune, was a man to who&s;e family Jo&s;eph, in the early part of life, owed &s;ome obligations. This man, by too great ho&s;pitality, an exce&s;s common enough in the We&s;t Indies, had involved his affairs, be|fore the &s;ire happened, and his e&s;tate lying in
<PB N="40" REF="022434_0038_0FB87CFFB76FE8E8">hou&s;es, that event entirely ruined him, he e&s;caping with only the clothes on his back. A|mid&s;t the cries of mi&s;ery and want which excited Jo&s;eph's compa&s;&s;ion, that man's unfortunate &s;i|tuation claimed particular notice. The gener|ous, the open temper of the &s;ufferer, the obli|gations that Jo&s;eph had to his family, were &s;pe|cial and powerful motives for acting towards him the friendly part.</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph had his bond for &s;ixty pounds &s;ter|ling. "Unfortunate man, (&s;ays he) this &s;hall never come again&s;t thee. Would Heaven thou could &s;ettle all thy other matters as ea&s;ily! But how am I &s;ure that I &s;hall keep in this mind: may not the love of gold, e&s;pecially, when by length of time thy misfortune has become fami|liar to me, return with too &s;trong a current, and bear down my fellow feeling before it? But for this I have a remedy. Never &s;halt thou apply for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any friend again&s;t my avarice." He got up, ordered a current account that the man had with him to a con&s;iderable a|mount to be drawn out, and with a whim that might have called up a &s;mile on the face of cha|rity, filled his pipe, &s;at down again, twi&s;ted the bond, and lighted his pipe with it. While the account was drawing out he continued &s;moking in a &s;tate of mind a monarch might envy. When
<PB N="41" REF="022434_0039_0FB87D0138A5F018">fini&s;hed he went in &s;earch of his friend, with the account di&s;charged, and the mutilated bond in his hand. On meeting with him he pre&s;ent|ed the papers to him with this addre&s;s. 'Sir, I am &s;en&s;ibly affected with your misfortunes&mdash; the obligations that I have received from your family, give me a relation to every branch of it. I know that your inability to &s;atisfy for what you owe, gives you more unea&s;ine&s;s than the lo&s;s of your own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. That you may not be anxious on my account in particular, accept of this di&s;charge, and the remains of your bond. I am overpaid in the &s;atisfaction that I feel from having done my duty. I beg you to con&s;ider this only as a token of the hap|pine&s;s that you will impart to me whenever you put it in my power to do you a good office.' One may ea&s;ily gue&s;s at the man's feelings, on being thus generou&s;ly treated, and how much his mind mu&s;t have been &s;trengthened to bear up again&s;t his misfortunes. I knew him a few years after this; he had got a &s;mall po&s;t in one of the forts, and pre&s;erved a decent appear|ance." Page 254.</P>
<P>In A&s;tley's Voyages it is mentioned, &s;peaking of The Manners and Cu&s;toms of the Inha|bitants of Kongo, that, "although &s;ome of them be &s;urly and proud, yet in general they
<PB N="42" REF="022434_0040_0FB87D0437B5C7A0">carry them&s;elves very friendly towards &s;trangers; being of a mild conver&s;ation, courteous, affable, and ea&s;y to be overcome with rea&s;on, yet in|clined to drink, e&s;pecially Spani&s;h wine and brandy." Vol. III. page 247.</P>
<P>It appears to me that the&s;e people mu&s;t ge|nerally have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a good di&s;po&s;ition, (ex|cepting their pa&s;&s;ion for &s;trong liquors) and a great inclination to ho&s;pitality, who could be very friendly towards &s;trangers, when they had found &s;o many &s;trangers to be treacherous and wicked. It is a&s;toni&s;hing that they did not all &s;eem &s;urly and proud.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, there are &s;ome travellers who give very unfavorable accounts of the morals of &s;ome black nations. Their accounts are certainly not wholly devoid of truth.

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Methods of procuring Slaves in Africa.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT has been &s;aid by &s;ome in defence of the Slave Trade, that the Negroes purcha&s;ed in Africa, are pri&s;oners of war, or criminals, who have ju&s;tly forfeited their liberty; that the trade will prevent them from cutting one another's throats; and that it may be the means of initi|ating them into the principles of chri&s;tianity. It mu&s;t be allowed that &s;ome of the Negroes who are purcha&s;ed in Africa are pri&s;oners of war, or criminals; but it can be proved by the mo&s;t in|conte&s;table evidence, that mo&s;t of tho&s;e who are taken from thence are innocent people, who have in no manner whatever forfeited their right to freedom. Francis Moore, who was Factor for the Engli&s;h African Company, on the river Gambia, &s;ays, "The Kings of that country generally ad|vi&s;e with their head-men, &s;carcely doing any thing of con&s;equence without con&s;ulting them fir&s;t, except the King of Bar&s;alli, who being &s;ubject to hard-drinking, is very ab&s;olute. It is to this King's in&s;atiable thir&s;t for brandy, that his &s;ub|jects' freedoms and families are in &s;o precarious a &s;ituation." Page 61. In another place he &s;ays, "Whenever this King wants goods or brandy, he &s;ends a me&s;&s;enger to the Engli&s;h
<PB N="44" REF="022434_0042_0FB87D073819FFE0">Governor, at James Fort, to de&s;ire he would &s;end a &s;loop there with a cargo; this news being not at all unwelcome, the Governor &s;ends ac|cordingly; again&s;t the arrival of the &s;loop, the King goes and ran&s;acks &s;ome of his enemies' towns, &s;eizing the people, and &s;elling them for &s;uch commodities as he is in want of, which commonly is brandy, guns, powder, balls, pi&s;|tols and cutla&s;&s;es for his attendants and &s;oldiers; and coral and &s;ilver for his wives and concu|bines <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ca&s;e he is not at war with any neigh|bouring King, he then falls upon one of his own towns, which are numerous, and u&s;es them in the &s;ame manner. He often goes with &s;ome of his troops by a town in the day-time, and re|turning in the night, &s;ets fire to three parts of it, and putting guards at the fourth, there &s;eizes the people as they run out from the fire; he ties their arms behind them, and marches them either to Joar or Cohone, where he &s;ells them to the Europeans." Page 46. Andrew Brue, the principal Factor for the French African Company, and who re&s;ided a con&s;iderable time in Africa, &s;ays, "That having received goods he wrote to Damel, (King of Kayor) that if he had a &s;ufficient number of &s;laves, he was ready to trade with him. This Prince, as well as the other Negro Monarchs, has always a &s;ure way of &s;upplying his de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iciencies by &s;elling his
<PB N="45" REF="022434_0043_0FB87D08BA144558">own &s;ubjects, for which they &s;eldom want &s;ome preten&s;ion or other. Damel had recour&s;e to this method: he &s;eized three hundred of his own people, and &s;ent word to Brue that he had &s;laves to deliver for his goods." A&s;tley's Col|lection of Voyages, vol. 2, page 29. After|wards he &s;ays, "that &s;ome of the natives are, on all occa&s;ions, endeavouring to &s;urpri&s;e and car|ry off their country people. They land with|out noi&s;e, and if they find a lone cottage, with|out defence, they &s;urround it, and carry off all the people and effects to their boat, and imme|diately reimbark." Page 98. Barbot, the French Factor, &s;ays, "It is well known that many of the European nations, trading among&s;t the&s;e people, have very unju&s;tly and inhumanly, without any provocation, &s;tolen away, from time to time, abundance of the people, not on|ly on this coa&s;t, but almo&s;t every where in Guinea, who have come on board their &s;hips in a harmle&s;s and confiding manner. The&s;e they have in great numbers carried away, and &s;old in the plantations with other &s;laves, which they had purcha&s;ed." Page 110. It is al&s;o con|firmed by writers of a later date, that Negroes are frequently &s;tolen from the coa&s;t of Africa; and that the Kings of that country, &s;eize by vio|lence, their innocent &s;ubjects, to &s;ell them to the Europeans. It is &s;aid in an account of the
<PB N="46" REF="022434_0044_0FB87D0A375B2C50">Slave Trade on the Coa&s;t of Africa, by Alex|ander Falconbridge, late Surgeon in the African Trade, London, printed, 1788; "Upon the windward coa&s;t another mode of procuring &s;laves is pur&s;ued; which is, by what they term boating; a mode that is very pernicious and de&s;tructive to the crews of the &s;hips. The &s;ail|ors who are employed upon this trade go in boats upon the rivers &s;eeking for Negroes, a|mong the villages &s;ituated upon the banks of them. But this method is very &s;low, and not always effectual. For, after being ab&s;ent from the &s;hip during a fortnight or three weeks they &s;ometimes return with only from eight to twelve Negroes. Numbers of the&s;e are procured in con&s;equence of alledged crimes, which, as be|fore ob&s;erved, when any &s;hips are upon the coa&s;t, are more productive than at any other pe|riod. Kidnapping, however, prevails here.</P>
<P>"I have good rea&s;on to believe, that of one hundred and twenty Negroes, which were pur|cha&s;ed for the &s;hip to which I belonged then lying at the river Ambris, by far the greater part, if not the whole, were kidnapped. This, with various other in&s;tances confirms me in the belief, that kidnapping is the fund which &s;up|plies the thou&s;ands of Negroes annually &s;old off the&s;e exten&s;ive windward and other coa&s;ts where

It is &s;aid in a pamphlet, which was printed in London in 1789, entitled, Ob&s;ervations on the Slave Trade, and a De&s;cription of &s;ome part of the Coa&s;t of Guinea, during a Voyage made in 1787 and 1788, in company with Doctor A. Sparrman and Captain Arr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">henius. By C. B. Wad&s;trom, Chief Director of the Royal A&s;&s;ay and Refining Office; Member of the Royal Chamber of Com|merce, and of the Royal Patriotic Society for improving Agriculture, Manufactures, and Com|merce in Sweden. "The King of Almammy had, in the year 1787, very much to his honor, enacted a law, that no &s;lave, whatever, &s;hould be marched through his territories. At this time &s;everal French ve&s;&s;els lay at anchor in the Se|negal, waiting for &s;laves. The route of the black traders in con&s;equence of this edict of the King was &s;topped, and the &s;laves carried to o|ther parts. The French, unable on this ac|count, to complete their cargoes, remon&s;trated with the King. He was, however, very unpro|pitious to their repre&s;entations, for he returned the pre&s;ents which had been &s;ent him by the Senegal Company, of which I my&s;elf was a wit|ne&s;s; declaring at the &s;ame time, that all the riches of that Company &s;hould not divert him from his de&s;ign. In this &s;ituation of affairs the French were obliged to have recour&s;e to their
<PB N="48" REF="022434_0046_0FB87D0DDDAF5D80">old friends the Moors. The&s;e, who had be|fore &s;hewn them&s;elves &s;o ready on &s;uch occa&s;ions, were no le&s;s ready and active on this. They &s;et off in parties to &s;urpri&s;e the unoffending Negroes, and to carry among them all the ca|lamities of war. Many unfortunate pri&s;oners were &s;ent, and for &s;ome time continued to be &s;ent in. I was once curious enough to &s;ee &s;ome of tho&s;e that had ju&s;t arrived. I applied to the director of the Company, who conducted me to the &s;lave-pri&s;ons. I there &s;aw the unfortunate captives chained two and two together, by the foot. The mangled bodies of &s;everal of them, who&s;e wounds were &s;till bleeding, exhibited a mo&s;t &s;hocking &s;pectacle; and their &s;ituation may be much ea&s;ier conceived than de&s;cribed. The Director of the Company, however, u&s;ed his be&s;t means to con&s;ole them.</P>
<P>"This is a &s;pecific in&s;tance clearly &s;hewing that <HI>one war at lea&s;t</HI> was undertaken for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of procuring &s;laves. I cannot, howe|ver, help ob&s;erving, that if no &s;uch in&s;tance as this had come within my knowledge during my &s;tay in tho&s;e parts, I &s;hould yet have thought my&s;elf ju&s;tifiable in &s;uppo&s;ing that the wars a|mong the Negroes originated in the &s;lave trade. For in all the ob&s;ervations I have been able to make (and I went to the Coa&s;t of Africa, not
<PB N="49" REF="022434_0047_0FB87D0EB8647A48">with any commercial views, but for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of inquiry and ob&s;ervation) I have ever con&s;idered the Negroes as a quiet, inoffen&s;ive people, happy in them&s;elves, and in one another enjoying the comforts of life, without the in|tervention of toil and trouble. If, therefore, I had found wars among a people of &s;uch di&s;po|&s;itions, and &s;o &s;ituated as to have no motive for them, I &s;hould certainly have &s;et them down, as having been excited for &s;ome diabolical pur|po&s;e, and for none &s;o likely as the pro&s;ecution of the &s;lave trade." Pages 4, 5, and 6. In another place he &s;ays&mdash;"A &s;econd &s;ource from whence the Europeans are &s;upplied with &s;laves on the Coa&s;t of Africa, is pillage, which is of two kinds; public and private. It is public, when practi&s;ed by the direction of the kings, private, when practi&s;ed by individuals. I mu&s;t al&s;o make a further di&s;tinction, namely, as it is practi&s;ed by the blacks and the whites. This la&s;t I call robbery, which will be the &s;ubject of the next article.</P>
<P>"The public pillage is of all others the mo&s;t plentiful &s;ource from which the &s;lave trade de|rives its continuance and &s;upport. The Kings of Africa, (I mean in that part of the country which I have vi&s;ited) incited by the merchandi&s;e &s;hewn them, which con&s;i&s;ts principally of &s;trong
<PB N="50" REF="022434_0048_0FB87D1039AA7F38">liquors, give orders to their military to attack their own villages in the night. Saturday night is particularly fixed upon for this purpo&s;e, being e&s;teemed the mo&s;t lucky for expeditions of this kind. However, when &s;laves are wanted in ha&s;te, no night is deemed &s;o inau&s;picious as to prevent an attempt.</P>
<P>"As I have been my&s;elf an eye witne&s;s to &s;e|veral of the&s;e nocturnal exhibitions, it will, per|haps, be better to illu&s;trate this kind of pillage by &s;ome examples.</P>
<P>"The French make pre&s;ents to the Negro as well as the Moori&s;h Kings. It happened when I was at Goree, that an Amba&s;&s;ador was to be &s;ent from thence to the King of Barbe&s;in on this errand. I obtained leave with my fellow-tra|vellers to accompany the emba&s;&s;y. We accord|ingly &s;et out and arrived at Joal, a place where the King re&s;ides at particular times of the year, viz. when the trading ve&s;&s;els arrive there.</P>
<P>"It is u&s;ual on the receipt of the&s;e pre&s;ents to &s;end back a number of &s;laves in return. It &s;o happened, however, that the King of Bar|be&s;in had no &s;laves in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at that time.

"We re&s;ided, I believe, about a week at Joal. During our re&s;idence there, the pillage, of which I have been &s;peaking, was attempted almo&s;t every night. The following is a de&s;cip|tion of the per&s;ons concerned in it, and of their various &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>"There were &s;everal parties of the military a&s;&s;embled at fix in the evening, or about du&s;k. Each party con&s;i&s;ted of about ten or twelve.

Page 7, 8 and 9. Afterwards he &s;ays, "At another time, the military, who had been &s;ent out to pillage, returned with &s;e|veral captives. The&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of men, women, and children.

He be&s;eeched his captors, with great fervency, that they would not tear him from his wife and children. The women, on the other hand, vented their &s;orrow in &s;hrieks and lamentations. The children, in a &s;tate of

During all this time the captors, to &s;hew their joy on the occa&s;ion, and to drown the cries of their unfortunate fel|low-&s;ubjects, were beating large drums. To this was added all the noi&s;e that could be col|lected from the blowing of horns, and the hu|man voice. Taking in the &s;hrieks and agony of the one, and the &s;houts and joy of the other, with the concomitant in&s;truments of noi&s;e, I was never before witne&s;s to &s;uch an infernal &s;cene.</P>
<P>"What I have &s;aid of the King of Barbe&s;in's conduct with re&s;pect to the mode of procuring &s;laves is equally applicable to tho&s;e other Kings of the country of whom I have any knowledge. King Damel, who&s;e dominious lie between Por|tugal and Senegal, wanting a &s;lave to deliver in exchange for &s;ome goods he had bargained for with a Goree trader, ordered his &s;oldiers to &s;eize on one of his own &s;ubjects. Finding a woman (who&s;e hu&s;band was ab&s;ent) in a hut with their children, they &s;eized her, bound her, and tore her from her babes, who were reject|ed, as not being able to perform the journey to the &s;hore."

<P>That the &s;lave-trade will prevent the Negroes from cutting one another's throats is an a&s;&s;er|tion totally un&s;upported by rea&s;on or experi|ence. It is mo&s;t certain that it has a contrary effect, that it tends to promote an ince&s;&s;ant con|tention between the people of Africa, and to deluge the land with blood. Anthony Benezet mentions, in his Hi&s;torical Account of Guinea, page 119, from an original manu&s;cript jour|nal of a per&s;on of credit, who went Surgeon on the &s;ame trade, in a ve&s;&s;el from New-York; "Being on the coa&s;t, the Commander of the ve&s;&s;el, according to cu&s;tom, &s;ent a per&s;on on &s;hore with a pre&s;ent to the King, acquainting him with his arrival, and letting him know they wanted a cargo of &s;laves.

The author of the journal, who beheld the dead bodies on the field after the battle, &s;ays, "Think what a pitiable &s;ight it was to &s;ee the widows weeping over their lo&s;t hu&s;bands, or|phans deploring the lo&s;s of their fathers, &amp;c." Mr Clark&s;on &s;ays, in his admirable E&s;&s;ay on the Slavery and Commerce of the human Species, particularly the African.&mdash;"Another argument yet remains, which, though nature will ab&s;o|lutely turn pale at the recital, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be omitted. In tho&s;e wars, which are made for the &s;ake of procuring &s;laves, it is evident that the conte&s;t mu&s;t be generally ob&s;tinate, and that great numbers mu&s;t be &s;lain on both &s;ides, be|fore the event can be determined. This we may rea&s;onably apprehend to be the ca&s;e: and we have &s;hewn that there have not been wanting in&s;tances, where the conquerors have been &s;o incen&s;ed at the re&s;i&s;tance they have found, that their &s;pirit of vengeance has entirely got the better of their avarice, and they have murdered in cool blood, every individual, without di&s;cri|mination,

The la&s;t order is the mo&s;t numer|ous. Let us &s;uppo&s;e then that only &s;ix thou|&s;and of this order are annually &s;ent into &s;ervi|tude, and it will immediately appear that no le&s;s than <HI>&s;ixty thou&s;and</HI> people annually peri&s;h in tho&s;e wars, which are made only for the purpo&s;e of procuring &s;laves.

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Treatment of the Negroes on the Pa&s;&s;age to the We&s;t Indies and the Southern States of A|merica&mdash;Explanation of the Plate.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN the Negroes are objected to by the Captains on account of age, &s;ickne&s;s, deformity, or any rea&s;on whatever, they are frequently beaten and treated with great cruel|ty by the traders. At New Calabar, it is &s;aid, by Alexander Falconbridge, in his Account of the Slave-Trade, on the Coa&s;t of Africa, the black traders have frequently in the&s;e circum|&s;tances put them to death. They have been known to drop their canoes under the &s;tern of the ve&s;&s;el, and in&s;tantly to behead them in &s;ight of the &s;hip's crew &mdash;Mr. Clark&s;on &s;ays, in his Sub&s;tance of the Evidence of &s;undry Per&s;ons on the Slave-Trade. "Mr. &mdash; was lying in the &mdash;, in Benin river. At the time alluded to Captain Lemma Lemma, a great trader of Benin was on board. This trader, happening to be on deck, ob&s;erved a canoe with three people in it, cro&s;&s;ing the above river. Upon &s;eeing it he di&s;patched a war canoe, which was then lying along &s;ide the &mdash;; and on board of which were five of his people, in pur|&s;uit. They pre&s;ently came up with the canoe afore&s;aid, and having &s;eized her brought her
<PB N="62" REF="022434_0060_0FB87D247751D5B0">along &s;ide of the &mdash;. The three people were then taken out of the canoe, and brought on board. They con&s;i&s;ted of a father, &s;on, and daughter. The two latter were &s;old to the Chief Mate, Captain &mdash; being then at the Factory at Gatoe. The former, on account of his age, was refu&s;ed. Upon this Capt. Lemma Lemma ordered his people to take him into his own canoe, which they accordingly did, but laid his head upon the thwart of the boat, and in two &s;trokes with a cutla&s;s cut it off. This Mr. &mdash; &s;aw with his own eyes." Page 33. The Negroes upon being brought on board the ve&s;&s;el as &s;laves, will &s;ometimes, e&s;pecially the women, become in&s;ane; which to a feeling mind mu&s;t greatly add to the horror of the &s;cene, though it may be matter of laughter to the unfeeling. They will &s;ometimes jump into the &s;ea to e&s;cape the fangs of the oppre&s;&s;or, or aim at the de&s;truction of them&s;elves by &s;ome other means. They often attempt in&s;urrections. "The men Negroes (&s;ays Alex. Falconbridge) on being brought aboard the &s;hip are immedi|ately fa&s;tened together, two a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> two, by hand|cuffs on their wri&s;ts, and by irons riveted on their legs. They are then &s;ent down between the decks, and placed in an apartment partition|ed off for that purpo&s;e. The women likewi&s;e are placed in a &s;eparate apartment between
<PB N="63" REF="022434_0061_0FB87D25F9C88E88">decks, but without being ironed. And an ad|joining room, on the &s;ame deck, is be&s;ides ap|pointed for the boys. Thus are they all placed in different apartments.</P>
<P>"But at the &s;ame time they are frequently &s;towed &s;o clo&s;e, as to admit of no other po&s;ture than lying on their &s;ides. Neither will the height between decks, unle&s;s directly under the grat|ing, permit them the indulgence of an erect po&s;ture; e&s;pecially where there are platforms, which is generally the ca&s;e. The&s;e platforms are a kind of &s;helf, about eight or nine feet in breadth, extending from the &s;ide of the &s;hip towards the center. They are placed nearly midway between the decks, at the di&s;tance of two or three feet from each deck. Upon the&s;e the Negroes are &s;towed in the &s;ame manner as they are on the deck underneath." Page 20.</P>
<P>The annexed plate is a copy of that which was lately publi&s;hed in England by the Commit|tee of the Plymouth Society for the Abolition of the Slave-Trade. "The annexed plate (they &s;ay) repre&s;ents the lower deck of an African &s;hip of two hundred and ninety &s;even tons bur|den, with the &s;laves &s;towed in it, in the pro|portion of not quite one to a ton.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="022434_0062_0FB87D294BE57C88">
"In the men's apartment the &s;pace allowed to each is &s;ix feet in length, by &s;ixteen inches in breadth. The boys are each allowed five feet by fourteen inches. The women five feet ten inches, by &s;ixteen inches; and the girls four feet by one foot each. The perpendicular height between the decks is five feet eight inches.&mdash; It may perhaps be conceived from the crowded &s;tate in which the &s;laves appear in the plate, that an unu&s;ual and exaggerated in&s;tance has been produced; this, however, is &s;o far from being the ca&s;e, that no &s;hip, if her intended cargo can be procured, ever carries a le&s;s number than one to a ton, and the u&s;ual practice has been to carry double that number. The bill which was pa&s;&s;ed the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ions of Parliament, only re&s;tricts the carriage to five &s;laves for three tons; and the Brooks, of Liverpool, a capital &s;hip, from which the annexed &s;ketch was proportion|ed, did, in one voyage, actually carry &s;ix hun|dred and nine &s;laves, which is more than double the number that appear in the plate. The mode of &s;towing them was as follows: platforms, or wide &s;helves, were erected between the decks, extending &s;o far from the &s;ides towards the middle of the ve&s;&s;el, as to be capable of con|taining four additional rows of &s;laves, by which means the perpendicular height between each tier, after allowing for the beams and platforms,
<PB N="65" REF="022434_0063_0FB87D2A78AFD740">was reduced to two feet &s;ix inches, &s;o that they could not even &s;it in an erect po&s;ture; be&s;ides which, in the men's apartments, in&s;tead of four rows, five were &s;towed, by placing the heads of one between the thighs of another. All the horrors of this &s;ituation are &s;till multiplied in the &s;maller ve&s;&s;els. The Kitty of one hundred and thirty-&s;even tons, had only one foot ten inches, and the Venus, of one hundred and forty-&s;ix tons, only one foot nine inches perpendicular height, above each laver."</P>
<P>Alexander Falconbridge in his before-men|tioned publication &s;ays, "About eight o'clock in the morning the Negroes are generally brought upon deck. Their irons being examin|ed, a long chain, which is locked to a ring-bolt, fixed in the deck, is run through the rings of the &s;hackles of the men, and then locked to another ring-bolt, fixed al&s;o in the deck. By this means fifty or &s;ixty, and &s;ometimes more, are fa&s;tened to one chain, in order to prevent them from ri&s;ing, or endeavoring to e&s;cape. If the wea|ther proves favorable, they are permitted to re|main in that &s;ituation till four or five in the af|ternoon, when they are di&s;engaged from the chain, and &s;ent down." Page 21.</P>
<P>In another place he &s;ays, "Upon the Negroes refu&s;ing to take &s;u&s;tenance, I have &s;een coals of
<PB N="66" REF="022434_0064_0FB87D2BF8194848">fire, glowing hot, put on a &s;hovel, and placed &s;o near their lips, as to &s;corch and burn them. And this has been accompanied with threats, of forcing them to &s;wallow the coals, if they any longer per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing to eat. The&s;e means have generally had the de&s;ired effect I have al&s;o been credibly informed, that a certain Cap|tain in the &s;lave-trade, poured melted lead on &s;uch of the Negroes as ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed their food." Page 23.</P>
<P>Again he &s;ays, "On board &s;ome &s;hips, the common &s;ailors are allowed to have intercour&s;e with &s;uch of the black women who&s;e con&s;ent they can procure. And &s;ome of them have been known to take the incon&s;tancy of their para|mours &s;o much to heart, as to leap overboard, and drown them&s;elves. The officers are per|mitted to indulge their pa&s;&s;ions among them at plea&s;ure, and &s;ometimes are guilty of &s;uch bru|tal exce&s;&s;es, as di&s;grace human nature.</P>
<P>"The hard&s;hips and inconveniences &s;uffered by the Negroes during the pa&s;&s;age are &s;carcely to be enumerated or conceived. They are far more violently affected by the &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s, than the Europeans. It frequently terminates in death, e&s;pecially among the women. But the exclu&s;ion of the fre&s;h air is among the mo&s;t in|tolerable.
<PB N="67" REF="022434_0065_0FB87D2DE7C63870">For the purpo&s;e of admitting this needful refre&s;hment, mo&s;t of the &s;hips in the &s;lave-trade are provided between the decks, with five or &s;ix air-ports on each &s;ide of the &s;hip, of about &s;ix inches in length, and four in breadth: in addition to which, &s;ome few &s;hips, but not one in twenty, have what they denominate <HI>wind-&s;ails.</HI> But whenever the &s;ea is rough, and the rain heavy, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hut the&s;e, and every other conveyance by which the air is admitted. The fre&s;h air being thus excluded, the Negroes' rooms very &s;oon grow intolerably hot. The confined air, rendered noxious by the effluvia exhaled from their bodies, and by being repeatedly breathed &s;oon produces fevers and fluxes, which generally carry off great num|bers of them.</P>
<P>"During the voyages I made I was frequent|ly a witne&s;s to the fatal effects of this exclu&s;ion of the fre&s;h air. I will give one in&s;tance, as it &s;erves to convey &s;ome idea, though a very faint one, of the &s;uffering of tho&s;e unhappy beings whom we wantonly drag from their native coun|try, and doom to perpetual labor and captivity. Some wet and blowing weather having occa&s;ion|ed the port-holes to be &s;hut, and the granting to be covered, fluxes and fevers among the Ne|groes en&s;ued. While they were in this &s;itua|tion,
<PB N="68" REF="022434_0066_0FB87D2EF73C9060">as my profe&s;&s;ion required it, I frequently went down among them, till at length their a|partments became &s;o extremely hot, as to be on|ly &s;uffered for a very &s;hort time. But the ex|ce&s;&s;ive heat was not the only thing that render|ed their &s;ituation intolerable. The deck, that is the floor of their rooms, was &s;o covered with the blood and mucus, which had proceed|ed from them in con&s;equence of the flux, that it re&s;embled a &s;laughter-hou&s;e. It is not in the power of human imagination to picture to it&s;elf a &s;ituation more dreadful or di&s;gu&s;ting. Num|bers of the &s;laves having fainted they were carri|ed upon deck, where &s;everal of them died, and the re&s;t were with great difficulty re&s;tored. It had nearly proved fatal to me al&s;o." Page 24 and 25.</P>
<P>This author mentions that a &s;mall &s;hip from Liverpool took in near &s;even hundred &s;laves.&mdash; "By purcha&s;ing &s;o great a number (he &s;ays) the &s;laves were &s;o crowded that they were obliged to lie, one upon another. This occa&s;ioned &s;uch a mortality among them, that, without meeting with unu&s;ual bad weather, or having a longer voyage than common, nearly one half of them died before the &s;hip arrived in the We&s;t-Indies." Page 26.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="022434_0067_0FB87D30781DA190">
He &s;ays, "The place allotted for the &s;ick Negroes is under the half deck, where they lie on the bare planks. By this means tho&s;e who are emaciated, frequently have their &s;kin, and even their fle&s;h, entirely rubbed off, by the mo|tion of the &s;hip, from the prominent parts of the &s;houlders, elbows, and hips, &s;o as to render the bones in tho&s;e parts quite bare. And &s;ome of them, by con&s;tantly lying in the blood and mucus, that had flowed from tho&s;e afflicted with the flux, and which, as before ob&s;erved, is general|ly &s;o violent as to prevent their being kept clean, have their fle&s;h much &s;ooner rubbed off, than tho&s;e who have only to contend with the mere friction of the &s;hip. The excruciating pain which the poor &s;ufferers feel from being obliged to conti|nue in &s;uch a dreadful &s;ituation, frequently for &s;everal week, in ca&s;e they happen to live &s;o long, is not to be conceived or de&s;cribed. Few, indeed, are ever able to with&s;tand the fatal effects of it." Pages 27, 28.</P>
<P>The Rev. John Newton, &s;ays, in his Thoughts on the African Slave-Trade. London, printed 1788. "With the Engli&s;h &s;hips on the coa&s;t the great object is to be full. When the &s;hip is there it is thought de&s;ireable &s;he &s;hould take as many as po&s;&s;ible. The cargo of a ve&s;&s;el of one hundred tons, or little more, is calculated to

Their lodging rooms, below the deck, which are three (for the men, the boys, and the women) be&s;ides a place for the &s;ick, are &s;ometimes more than five feet high, and &s;ometimes le&s;s; and this height is divided towards the middle for the &s;laves lie in two rows, one above the other, on each &s;ide of the &s;hip, clo&s;e to each other, like books upon a &s;helf. I have known them &s;o clo&s;e that the &s;helf would not ea&s;ily contain one more. And I have known a white man &s;ent down among the men to lay them, in the&s;e rows, to the greate&s;t ad|vantage, &s;o that as little &s;pace as po&s;&s;ible might be lo&s;t. Let it be ob&s;erved that the poor crea|tures thus cramped for want of room are like|wi&s;e in irons, for the mo&s;t part both hands and feet, and two together, which makes it difficult for them to turn or move, to attempt either to ri&s;e or life down without hurting them&s;elves or each other. Nor is the motion of the &s;hip, e&s;|pecially her heeling, or &s;toop on one &s;ide, when under &s;ail, to be omitted; for this as they lie athwart or acro&s;s the &s;hip, adds to the uncom|fortablene&s;s of their lodging, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who lie on the leeward, or leaning &s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<Q>Dire is the to&s;&s;ing, deep the groans.</Q>

The heat and the &s;mell of the&s;e rooms, when the weather will not admit of the &s;laves being brought upon deck, and of having their rooms cleaned every day, would be almo&s;t in&s;upporta|ble to a per&s;on not accu&s;tomed to them. If the &s;laves and their rooms be con&s;tantly aired, and they are not detained too long on board, perhaps there are not many die, but the contrary is often their lot. They are kept down by the weather to breathe a hot and corrupted air &s;ometimes for a week: this added to the galling of the irons, and the de&s;pondency which &s;eizes their &s;pirits, when thus confined, &s;oon becomes fatal. And every morning, perhaps, more in&s;tances are found than one, of the living and the dead, like the captives of Menzentius fa&s;tened toge|ther.</P>
<P>Epidemical fevers and fluxes which fill the &s;hip with noi&s;ome and noxious effluvia, often break out, infect the &s;eamen likewi&s;e, and the oppre&s;&s;or and oppre&s;&s;ed fall by the &s;ame &s;troke. I believe nearly one half of the &s;laves on board have &s;ometimes died, and that the lo&s;s of a third part in the&s;e circum&s;tances is not unu&s;ual. The &s;hip in which I was mate, left the coa&s;t with 218 &s;laves on board; and though we were not much affected with epidemical di&s;orders, I find by my journal of that voyage (now before me) that we

<P>"I believe upon an average between the more healthy and the more &s;ickly voyages, and including all contingencies, one fourth of the whole purcha&s;e may be allotted to the article of mortality.

<P>This author mentions a &s;hocking in&s;tance of inhumanity in a mate of a ve&s;&s;el with whom he once &s;ailed.

<P>Mr. Wad&s;trom the author whom we quoted in the preceeding chapter &s;ays, "I am very &s;orry that humanity obliges me here to divulge a mo&s;t barbarous practice, frequently u&s;ed by the French traders in the middle pa&s;&s;age. I have been a&s;&s;ured by &s;everal of their merchants

It is the general cu&s;tom of the Captains of the ve&s;&s;els in the &s;lave-trade, if there &s;hould be occa&s;ion on account of bad weather, to throw &s;ome of the Negroes overboard to lighten the &s;hip. This is al&s;o done without reluctance, if there &s;hould be any fear that provi&s;ions or wa|ter &s;hould fall &s;hort before the arrival of the &s;hip at its de&s;tined port. Mr. Clark&s;on, however, in his celebrated E&s;&s;ay on the Slavery and Com|merce of the Human Species, particularly the African, &s;ays, "But indeed &s;o lightly are the&s;e unhappy people e&s;teemed that their lives have even been taken away upon &s;peculation: there has been an in&s;tance within the la&s;t five years of <HI>one hundred and thirty-two</HI> of them being thrown into the &s;ea, becau&s;e it was &s;uppo&s;ed that by this <HI>trick</HI> their value could be recovered from the in&s;urers. This in&s;tance happened in a &s;hip, commanded by one Collingwood. On the 29th of November, 1781, fifty four of them were

Ten others, who were brought upon the deck for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, did not wait to be hand-cuffed, but bravely leaped into the &s;ea, and &s;hared the fate of their companions. It is a fact, that the people on board this &s;hip had not been put upon &s;hort allowance. The excu&s;e that this execrable wretch made on board for his conduct, was the following, "that if the &s;laves, who were then &s;ickly had died a natural death, the lo&s;s would have been the own|ers; but as they were thrown alive into the &s;ea, it would fall upon the underwriters."

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Treatment of the Negroes in the We&s;t-Indies and other places.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE appearance of a &s;lave-&s;hip in the har|bour of a We&s;t-India I&s;land is the mo&s;t horrible and di&s;gu&s;ting of any &s;ight that can be conceived. It is black with filth, and emits a mo&s;t fetid &s;mell. It is &s;urrounded with &s;harks of an enormous &s;ize, who have followed it per|haps from Guinea, and who appear eager to ta&s;te again of tho&s;e carca&s;es upon which they have frequently been fed. The Negroes upon their arrival in the We&s;t Indies are &s;ometimes &s;old by &s;cramble. In a &s;cramble the Negroes bear an equal price, which is &s;ettled before-hand with the purcha&s;ers, and every man is to be con|tent with the Negro or Negroes which he can &s;eize. It has been known that when the &s;ale in this manner has been made on board a &s;hip, and when upon a &s;ignal given the purcha&s;ers have ru&s;hed in upon the Negroes, they have been &s;truck with terror, and have jumped into the &s;ea. When they have been &s;old in this manner in a merchant's yard on &s;hore, they have been known to climb over the fence or wall that &s;ur|rounded them, and to run wild and affrighted over the whole town. This fear proceeds greatly
<PB N="78" REF="022434_0077_0FB87ADCB8B5D280">from an opinion, very common among the Ne|groes lately taken from Africa, that the white people de&s;ign to eat them. The mo&s;t u&s;ual me|thod, however, of &s;elling them, is on &s;hore without a &s;cramble. At the &s;ale the mo&s;t &s;hock|ing indecencies are practi&s;ed; and hu&s;bands and wives, and parents and children, are &s;eparated without reluctance, if it is inconvenient to the purcha&s;er that they &s;hould be kept together. A Negro in &s;ome of the We&s;t-India I&s;lands and in &s;ome parts of America, has &s;carcely a greater protection, from the laws, than a hor&s;e. The murder of a &s;lave is in many places not puni&s;h|able by death, but by a pecuniary fine. The notorious and execrable law of Barbadoes, which is a di&s;grace to human nature, &s;ays that "if any man &s;hall of wantonne&s;s or only of bloody-mindedne&s;s, or cruel intention, wilfully kill a Negro, or other &s;lave of his own, he &s;hall deliver into the public trea&s;ury, fifteen pounds &s;terling, and not be liable to any other puni&s;h|ment or forfeiture, for the &s;ame."&mdash;Laws of Bar|badoes, Act 329.</P>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been a&s;&s;erted in the new&s;papers that this law has very lately been repealed; and that by the laws of Barbadoes the penalty of death, is now affixed to the murder of a Negro by a white man.</NOTE>
<P>The mo&s;t wanton cruelties are daily practi&s;ed upon the Negroes in the We&s;t-Indies. I have
<PB N="79" REF="022434_0078_0FB87ADDB9CD0EE0">known, in an I&s;land in the We&s;t-Indies, where I re&s;ided for &s;ome years, a Negro to be &s;everely whipped and to be ince&s;&s;antly per&s;ecuted for re|fu&s;ing his daughter to a manager of an e&s;tate, upon the plea that &s;he was from her early youth unripe for love, and that he had de&s;igned her at a more advanced age, for a young man of his own color, who was his friend, and attached to his daughter. Reader attend to the hand of Heaven, which was palpably rai&s;ed for the pu|ni&s;hment of this profligate villain, and if ever thou ha&s;t committed an act of inju&s;tice or tyranny again&s;t any of thy fellow-creatures, know that thy crime can only be expiated by repentance, or by retribution here or hereafter. This man, who&s;e name was Thom&s;on or Thomp&s;on, left the e&s;tate on which he lived &s;oon after the per|&s;ecution of this Negro for refu&s;ing his daughter to his peevi&s;h and damnable lu&s;t, and entering into a privateer, accumulated in a &s;hort time the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">m of a thou&s;and pounds. He returned to the We&s;t-Indies, and quickly having con&s;umed his money in riot and debauchery, he was &s;eized with a di&s;order the con&s;equence of his amours. As he lay dying in a tavern, with what is called a corona veneris upon him, and putrid before his death, there were &s;ome game&s;ters in a near chamber to him, who were rattling the dice-box, and he was at la&s;t, unlamented, and almo&s;t unat|tended,
<PB N="80" REF="022434_0079_0FB87AE10E778978">thrown into a hole like a dead dog.&mdash; "Vengeance is mine; I will repay &s;aith the Lord." Paul's Epi&s;tles. A fellow who had the management of an e&s;tate in the &s;ame i&s;land, is &s;aid, when peevi&s;h from the gout, to have or|dered a Negro-boy, as he was lying down, to bru&s;h the flies from his face, and to have threa|tened him with thirty nine la&s;hes for every fly that &s;hould touch him. The con&s;equence is &s;aid to have been, what we &s;hould naturally &s;up|po&s;e, that in a hot country, where flies are nu|merous, a great many &s;ettled upon the face of this &s;coundrel, and inexorable tyrant, and the boy was almo&s;t whipped to death. Sir Hans Sloane, in his introduction to the Natural Hi&s;to|ry of Jamaica, &s;ays, "The puni&s;hments for crimes of &s;laves, are u&s;ually for rebellions, burn|ing them, by nailing them down on the ground, with crooked &s;ticks, on every limb, and then applying the fire by degrees from the feet and hands, burning them gradually up to the head, whereby <HI>their pains are extravagant;</HI> for crimes of a le&s;&s;er nature, gelding, or chopping off half the foot with an axe. The&s;e puni&s;hments are &s;uffered by them with great con&s;tancy.&mdash;For negligence they are u&s;ually whipped by the over|&s;eers with lance-wood &s;witches, till they be bloody, and &s;everal of the &s;witches broken, be|ing fir&s;t tied up by their hands in the mill-hou&s;es.

<P>The puni&s;hment of this Negro is &s;omewhat &s;imilar to the puni&s;hment of a Negro for mur|der in the i&s;land of St. Eu&s;tatius: an account of which is to be found in one of Dod&s;ley's Annu|al Regi&s;ters. The conduct of the Negro in St. Eu&s;tatius &s;eems, however, to have been more violent than the conduct of the Negro in Ame|rica. As he was working on board a ve&s;&s;el in the harbour of that i&s;land, he happened to kill a white man. At the in&s;tigation of ano|ther Negro, who was &s;tanding by, and who told him he could be no more than hung if he killed &s;everal white men, he jumped into the &s;ea, &s;wam to the town, and running a muck (as cer|tain people are de&s;cribed in Hawke&s;worth's
<PB N="85" REF="022434_0084_0FB87AE8DA135AA0">Voyages to do in Batavia) he was de&s;irous of killing every one he met. A re&s;olute &s;ailor at la&s;t overpowered him. He was condemned to &s;uffer death by being put without food or water in a cage, which was rai&s;ed &s;ome di&s;tance from the ground. He then became, after &s;ome time a mo&s;t wretched &s;pectacle, and his cries, for <HI>wa|ter, water,</HI> were ince&s;&s;ant. I believe the cir|cum&s;tances in general which are mentioned of the execution of the&s;e two Negroes to be true. It is impo&s;&s;ible for a benevolent mind to read of the torture to which they, but e&s;pecially the Ne|gro in America, were expo&s;ed, without the ut|mo&s;t horror. It is &s;aid his crime was that of killing the Over&s;eer of the Plantation. He might have killed the over&s;eer in his own de|fence&punc; or he might have been provoked to it by injuries of the mo&s;t galling and afflictive na|ture (which we know to be too often inflicted by tyrants on their &s;laves) by injuries, through which patience it&s;elf might have been irritated, and which the uncorrected pa&s;&s;ions of an Afri|can could not in any manner brook. We are told that oppre&s;&s;ion will make even a wi&s;e man mad. But if we were to allow that the Negro killed the Over&s;eer unju&s;tly, &s;till we mu&s;t allow that the puni&s;hment to which he was expo&s;ed was inhuman, and &s;uch as &s;hould not have been inflicted. If he had been guilty of a deliberate
<PB N="86" REF="022434_0085_0FB87AE9BAC73DC0">murder, it &s;hould have been remembered, how|ever, when he was put to death that he was a man. There is &s;omething diabolical in torture; it begins to be exploded by civilized nations. It will be &s;aid that executions like the&s;e are nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;trike terror into &s;laves. In an&s;wer to which I will ob&s;erve that if &s;uch executions are nece&s;&s;ary where &s;lavery is practi&s;ed, it is a forci|ble argument for the abolition of it.</P>

<P>Here is encouragement given, under the &s;anc|tion of an act of A&s;&s;embly, to commit murder. This, with many other circum&s;tances, &s;hould teach us not to pay too much veneration to what
<PB N="90" REF="022434_0089_0FB87AEFBA2F5320">is called law. We &s;hould di&s;regard the law of man, where it is contrary to the law of God.

<P>Mr. Clark&s;on in his E&s;&s;ay on the Slavery and Commerce of the human &s;pecies, particularly the African, &s;ays, "An iron coffin, with holes in it, was kept by a certain coloni&s;t, as an auxi|liary to the la&s;h. In this the poor victim of the Ma&s;ter's re&s;entment was inclo&s;ed, and placed &s;ufficiently near a fire, to occa&s;ion extreme pain, and con&s;equently &s;hrieks and groans, until the revenge of the ma&s;ter was &s;atiated, without any other inconvenience on his part, than a tempo|rary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the &s;lave's labor.

<P>It mu&s;t give &s;ome con&s;olation to the friends of humanity to know that the cruelty which was practi&s;ed upon the Negroes, begins in &s;ome places to be re&s;trained by law. This may be
<PB N="91" REF="022434_0090_0FB87AF13A2A7CD8">greatly attributed to the clamor which has been rai&s;ed by various writers in defence of the&s;e per|&s;ecuted per&s;ons, and &s;hould urge tho&s;e who have abilities or information to greater exertions in the noble cau&s;e of vindicating the oppre&s;&s;ed.&mdash; The A&s;&s;embly of Jamaica have lately pa&s;&s;ed an act to meliorate the condition of the Negroes, and have affixed the penalty of death to the mur|der of a Negro. The A&s;&s;embly of Grenada have pa&s;&s;ed an act on the 3d of November 1788, "for the better protection, and for promoting the encrea&s;e and population of &s;laves." The in|tent of this act, it is mentioned in the pream|ble, is "to pre&s;cribe rea&s;onable bounds to the power of ma&s;ters, and others, having the charge of &s;laves, by compelling them &s;ufficiently and properly to lodge, feed, cloath and maintain them, by introducing them to the knowledge of the chri&s;tian religion, and affording them opportunity of improvement in morality, and by inducing them to regular marriage, and when married protecting them in their con|jugal rights." It is to be lamented that the act does not immediately prevent the further importation of &s;laves, but &s;peaks only of the "means of removing in the cour&s;e of time the nece&s;&s;ity of further importations from Africa."

<P>It is to be lamented that this act does not lay a heavy penalty upon a crime which is very fre|quent in the We&s;t-Indies. I mean the puni&s;h|ing a young Negro girl, or her father, if the

I can vouch for the authenticity of the account which I have given of the flagitious conduct of one manager in this re&s;pect. It is mentioned in the Roman Hi&s;tory that a &s;imilar attempt in Appius, a De|cemvir, produced a revolution in Rome, and for ever overturned the power of him and his col|leagues. The people &s;hocked at the wicked|ne&s;s of this magi&s;trate, who wi&s;hed to debauch the daughter of a Centurion, fled from the ci|ty as from a polluted place. "What have we to do, (&s;aid they) in a city, where neither cha&s;ti|ty nor liberty is &s;afe." See Hooke's Roman Hi&s;tory, vol. 2, page 181, octavo. The cele|brated Machiavel, though he often gives di&s;hon|e&s;t advice to a Prince for the government of his kingdom, yet &s;ometimes gives him that which is very &s;alutary. He recommends to him not to debauch the wives or daughters of his &s;ubjects, as &s;uch actions have a tendency to inflame the mind with &s;ingular indignation, and to make the family who are injured attempt the &s;ubver&s;ion of a government.</P>

<P>IT &s;urely would not be impolitic in the coun|tries of Europe, or in the &s;tates of America, to aboli&s;h the &s;lave-trade. Here humanity would be doubly or trebly ble&s;t. It would not only ble&s;s tho&s;e who receive, but tho&s;e who give.&mdash; It would not only be advantageous to the Negro, but to the Planter or Farmer, and afterwards to the generous country which &s;hould &s;tretch out its hand to relieve the oppre&s;&s;ed. The exi&s;tence of the European &s;ettlements would not be en|dangered, nor would a defalcation of revenue en&s;ue, from an abolition of the &s;lave-trade. I am convinced that the abolition of the &s;lave-trade would tend to the intere&s;t of the Planters, that it would make the condition of the We&s;t-India i&s;lands more pro&s;perous, and therefore that no diminution of revenue would en&s;ue.&mdash; Long, in his Hi&s;tory of Jamaica, &s;ays, "The purcha&s;e of new Negroes is the mo&s;t chargeable article attending the&s;e e&s;tates, and the <HI>true &s;ource</HI> of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es under which their owners &s;uf|fer: for they involve them&s;elves &s;o deeply in debt to make the&s;e <HI>incon&s;iderate</HI> purcha&s;es, and

The celebrated Mr. Clark&s;on in his e&s;&s;ay on the impolicy of the African &s;lave-trade &s;ays, in confirmation of Mr. Long's Ob&s;ervations which he quotes; that in the i&s;land of Jamaica four Courts are annually held; in each of which Courts about three thou&s;and new actions are u|&s;ually brought, chiefly upon bonds, nine tenths of which bonds have been given to the factors <HI>for new &s;laves.</HI> He &s;ays the principal part of the people who were confined in the goals of that i&s;land, were &s;uch who&s;e per&s;ons had been &s;eized, after their property had been found inadequate to &s;atisfy the demands of tho&s;e from whom they had purcha&s;ed newly inported Negroes. I my|&s;elf when I was in the We&s;t Indies, knew a gentleman who purcha&s;ed ten young Negroes at the &s;ale of the cargo of an African ve&s;&s;el, for each of whom, he gave thirty pounds current money of the i&s;land of Antigua. His wife was
<PB N="98" REF="022434_0097_0FB87AFD3949CD50">remarkable for the tenderne&s;s and the care with which &s;he cau&s;ed the new, the young, and the &s;ick Negroes to be nur&s;ed upon the e&s;tate, yet notwith&s;tanding every art and expence, every one of them, excepting one, &s;hortly died. The &s;urvivor was a &s;ingularly &s;ine boy when he fir&s;t was brought to the i&s;land, with a piercing eye and cheerful &s;pirit. He, however, did not e&s;|cape without a &s;evere illne&s;s. In this method of proceeding every Negro from Africa, who is rai&s;ed to bear the work of an e&s;tate, co&s;ts the purcha&s;er three hundred pounds; or more, for the price of Negroes is now advanced. It is not unu&s;ual, however, that among ten Negroes im|ported from Africa into the We&s;t-Indies not one &s;hould &s;urvive the &s;ea&s;oning. It has been a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome that the abolition of the &s;lave-trade, would cau&s;e the ruin of the European &s;ettlements, where Negroes have been u&s;ed in the cultivation of the land, and of the &s;outhern &s;tates of America. It is certain, however, if the Negroes were treated with humanity, there would be no occa&s;ion for further importations from Africa. Mr. Clark&s;on, in his before-mentioned E&s;&s;ay, &s;ays, "In the year 1771, a gentleman, now in England, became the proprie|tor of an e&s;tate &s;ituated near Montego-Bay, in the pari&s;h of Hanover, Jamaica. The number of &s;laves at that time upon it, amounted to two
<PB N="99" REF="022434_0098_0FB87AFF4DDC2438">hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix, all of whom had been born in the i&s;land. In the year 1786, after fifteen years had elap&s;ed, the number was found the &s;ame: nor had any purcha&s;e whatever been made within that period, nor was any at the end of it nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>In the year 1754, another gentleman &s;ucceed|ed to an e&s;tate in the &s;ame pari&s;h and i&s;land.&mdash; It contained at that time, two hundred and thirty three &s;laves. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y this la&s;t account, dated in June 1786, the number appeared to have increa&s;ed without any &s;upplies from the coa&s;t, to three hundred and fourteen, though fourteen had been &s;ent to other e&s;tates, or manumitted.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame i&s;land are &s;ix other e&s;tates, which have been in a &s;imilar &s;ituation, and for the truth of which I will become accountable if re|quired.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e has &s;upported it&s;elf, inde|pendently of the &s;lave trade, for twenty years, and from no other cau&s;e than that the owner, having thought it more to his intere&s;t that his &s;laves &s;hould increa&s;e, by birth, than by purcha&s;e, made his arrangements accordingly.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="022434_0099_0FB87B003A415098">
The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cond and third, &s;ituated in the pari&s;h of Clarendon, have had no occa&s;ion for a &s;ingle recruit from Africa for many years.</P>
<P>The fourth, in the pari&s;h of St. James, found a re&s;ource within it&s;elf, and by the following means: The proprietor made it a rule to relea&s;e every woman from all obligation to labor, as &s;oon as &s;he had a certain number of children, &s;it to be put to work. The con&s;e|quence of this was, that his &s;laves were conti|nually on the increa&s;e.</P>
<P>The fifth and &s;ixth, &s;ituated in the pari&s;h of St. John, and vale of Guanaboa, on account of the humane di&s;po&s;ition of the over&s;eer, and the moderate &s;hare of labour which he impo&s;es on the &s;laves, have no nece&s;&s;ity for &s;upplies.</P>
<P>The above is an account of &s;uch plantations as can be &s;pecified, and proved beyond the po&s;|&s;ibility of refutation, to have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted indepen|dently of the &s;lave-trade in the i&s;land of Jamai|ca. Many others are to be found there in the &s;ame predicament." Page 82 and 83.</P>
<P>What has been brought about in Jamaica may be practi&s;ed in other places. The u&s;e of the plough in the We&s;t-Indies, would enable a
<PB N="101" REF="022434_0100_0FB87B01C4848E20">Planter to work his e&s;tate with fewer Negroes than he u&s;es in his pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem. Mr. Long, in his Hi&s;tory of Jamaica, &s;ays, "It was found that one plough u&s;ed on an e&s;tate in the Pari&s;h of Clarendon, turned up as much ground in one day, and in a much better manner, than one hundred Negroes could perform with their hoes in the &s;ame time." Vol. 1, page 449. The objection that has been made to the plough in the i&s;land of Antigua, is that it would require more cattle upon an e&s;tate, and con&s;equently more land to be laid out in pa&s;ture. This, in many e&s;tates, where they have a good deal of pa&s;ture, would be no inconvenience whatever, and where they are deficient in this re&s;pect, the inconvenience might be remedied by planting Guinea gra&s;s in the intervals between the cane-pieces: for the additional number of cattle re|quired would be very &s;mall. In Jamaica they have lately thought it worth the while to enter again upon this plan of working an e&s;tate, and have encouraged people from England, who are acquainted with the method of managing a plough, to live upon their e&s;tates as over&s;eers, that the Negroes might be properly in&s;tructed. There cannot be a doubt but that with judge|ment and with patience this new &s;y&s;tem might be adopted with va&s;t advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="022434_0101_0FB87B0339388F40">
The Members of the Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature, and tho&s;e who are in authority among other nations of the world who carry on the &s;lave-trade, if they do not endeavor by every rea&s;onable exer|tion to abrogate that trade, are guilty indirectly of murder. They &s;uffer murder to be com|mitted by their neglect. They will an&s;wer, there|fore, for &s;uch neglect at that dread tribunal where there will be an "Inqui&s;ition for blood." The Privy Council in England have lately been engaged in inquiries concerning the &s;lave-trade. This &s;urely is highly becoming in them. If a &s;ingle murder is committed among a civilized people, do we not rai&s;e an immediate hue and cry after the &s;uppo&s;ed murderer? Is not the hou&s;e, the city, the country, where it was done, all at once agitated? And &s;hall the annual mur|der of an hundred thou&s;and, or more, innocent per&s;ons, not excite our inquiries, and not inflame our indignation? In England petitions have been pre&s;ented to Parliament again&s;t the &s;lave-trade by various &s;ects of chri&s;tians, and from nu|merous cities; and it is expected that before long an act will be pa&s;t for its final abolition.&mdash; In America the &s;tates of Rhode-I&s;land and Penn|&s;ylvania, to their immortal honor be it &s;poken, have led the way in this holy and glorious work. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gi&s;latures in both the&s;e &s;tates have lately pa&s;t acts, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a heavy penalty upon any

It would be hap|py if all their &s;i&s;ter &s;tates would follow them in this path of virtue and of glory, which they have trodden.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid in defence of the &s;lave-trade that it is a nur&s;ery for &s;eamen. Mr. Clark&s;on in his E&s;&s;ay on the Impolicy of the African Slave-Trade, has &s;hewn that it is rather the grave of the &s;eamen of Great-Britain. He &s;ays that

<P>Having now furni&s;hed a comparative view of the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained in &s;ome of the trades that are carried on by the &s;ubjects of this country, I will venture to a&s;&s;ert that if we except the &s;lave-trade, all the re&s;t of them put together did not di&s;&s;ipate more than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ine hundred &s;eamen in the year 1786. In the &s;ame year were de&s;troyed by the &s;lave-trade nineteen hundred and fifty.
<PB N="104" REF="022434_0103_0FB87B07C20C3F08">So that the truth of my former a&s;&s;ertion, "that this iniquitous trade de&s;troys more, in one year, than all the other trades of Great-Britain, when put together, de&s;troy in two," will but too ma|nife&s;tly appear." Page 66 and 67.</P>
<P>Mr. Clark&s;on &s;ays that the Captains in the &s;lave-trade are generally the mo&s;t inhuman ty|rants in the world; that they often cruelly beat their &s;eamen for trivial or imaginary faults, and will &s;ometimes wantonly murder them. He &s;ays that he has within his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the mo&s;t indi&s;|putable proofs of his a&s;&s;ertions.</P>
<P>It is greatly to be lamented that mankind will not relinqui&s;h the trade for &s;laves with A|frica, and carry on a commerce for other mat|ters. The country is fertile in the extreme.

Page 19.&mdash; He &s;ays again, "I cannot clo&s;e my account of this article without mentioning that cotton, crim&s;on in the pod, is to be found in Africa. It grows principally in the Eyeo country, and is to be &s;een in many of the Whidah cloths. A &s;mall &s;pecimen of it was brought home in the year 1786.</P>
<P>The value of this cotton would be great both to the importer, and manufacturer of mu&s;lins. The former would immediately receive eight &s;hillings for a pound of it, and the latter would gain con&s;iderably more by his ingenuity and ta&s;te. He might work it up into the white cotton in delicate &s;pots and figures, and as both would be of their natural color, no inconvenience would ari&s;e from wa&s;hing." Page 20. Mr. Clark|&s;on &s;ays that the dyes of Africa are &s;uperior to tho&s;e in any part of the world, and that in Africa they have the mo&s;t curious as well as the mo&s;t valuable woods, not only for dying, but for other purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>If the &s;lave-trade were aboli&s;hed, &s;ettlements of great importance could be immediately com|menced in the country, for the purpo&s;e of car|rying
<PB N="107" REF="022434_0106_0FB87B0E7AC36560">on a different commerce. It is &s;aid that the French purcha&s;ed, a few years ago, a con&s;i|derable tract of land at Cape Verd, which they now wi&s;h to u&s;e with this de&s;ign. Preachers al|&s;o of different &s;ects of chri&s;tianity would imme|diately repair to Africa to propagate the Go&s;pel, who are now, on account of the commotions and troubles which the &s;lave-trade produces, di&s;cou|raged from the attempt.</P>
<P>It might be advantageous to the European &s;et|tlements and the &s;outhern &s;tates of America to aboli&s;h <HI>gradually</HI> the &s;lavery of the Negroes which they at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;s, as well as to pre|vent the importation of others. Mr. Coxe, in his travels, &s;ays, "The generality, indeed, of the Poli&s;h Nobles are not inclined either to e&s;ta|bli&s;h or give efficacy to any regulations in favor of the pea&s;ants, whom they &s;carcely con&s;ider as entitled to the common rights of humanity: A few Nobles, however, of benevolent hearts and enlightened under&s;tandings, have acted upon different principles, and have ventured upon the expedient of giving liberty to their va&s;&s;als.&mdash; The event has &s;howed this project to be no le&s;s judicious than humane, no le&s;s friendly to their own intere&s;ts than to the happine&s;s of their pea&s;ants: for it appears that in the di&s;tricts, in which the new arrangement has been intro|duced,
<PB N="108" REF="022434_0107_0FB87B10ADED81E0">the population of their villages is con|&s;iderably increa&s;ed, and the revenues of their e&s;tates augmented in a triple proportion. The fir&s;t noble who granted freedom to his pea&s;ants was Zamoi&s;ki, formerly Grand-Chancellor, who in 1760, infranchi&s;ed &s;ix villages in the Palati|nate of Ma&s;ovia.</P>
<P>The revenues of the &s;ix villages &s;ince their en|franchi&s;ement, have augmented in a much great|er proportion than their population. In their &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage Zamoi&s;ki was obliged, accord|ing to the cu&s;tom of Poland, to build cottages and barns for his pea&s;ants, and to furni&s;h them with &s;eed, hor&s;es, ploughs, and every implement of agriculture; &s;ince their attainment of liberty they are become &s;o ea&s;y in their circum&s;tances, as to provide them&s;elves with all the&s;e nece&s;&s;aries at their own expence; and they likewi&s;e cheer|fully pay an annual rent, in lieu of the manual labor, which their ma&s;ter formerly exacted from them. By the&s;e means the receipts of this par|ticular e&s;tate have been nearly tripled.</P>
<P>Upon &s;igning the deed of enfranchi&s;ement of &s;ix villages, their benevolent ma&s;ter intimated &s;ome apprehen&s;ions to the inhabitants, le&s;t en|couraged by their freedom, they &s;hould fall into every &s;pecies of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and commit more
<PB N="109" REF="022434_0108_0FB87B117ABF7D60">di&s;orders than when they were &s;laves. The &s;implicity and good &s;en&s;e of their an&s;wer is re|markable: "When we had no other property," returned they, "than the &s;tick which we hold in our hands, we were de&s;titute of all encou|ragement to a right conduct, and having nothing to lo&s;e, acted on all occa&s;ions in an incon&s;iderate manner; but as &s;oon as our hou&s;es, our lands, and our cattle, are our own, the fear of forfeit|ing them will be a con&s;tant re&s;traint upon our actions." The &s;incerity of this a&s;&s;ertion was manife&s;ted by the event.</P>
<P>The example of Zamoi&s;ki has been followed by Chreptowitz, Vice-Chancellor of Lithuania, and the Abbe Bryzotow&s;ki, with &s;imilar &s;ucce&s;s. I was informed by a per&s;on who had vi&s;ited the Abbe's e&s;tate at Pawlowo near Vilna, that the happy countenance and comfortable air of the&s;e pea&s;ants made them appear a different race of men from the wretched tenants of the neigh|bouring villages. The pea&s;ants, penetrated with a &s;en&s;e of their ma&s;ter's kindne&s;s, have erected at their own expence, a pillar with an in&s;cription expre&s;&s;ive of their gratitude and affection."&mdash; Coxe's Travels into Poland, &amp;c. vol. 1, page 158, &amp;c. octavo.</P>
<P>What has been practi&s;ed in Poland, may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be brought about in the We&s;t-Indies,
<PB N="110" REF="022434_0109_0FB87B1396E530D8">and the &s;outhern &s;tates of America. In the&s;e latter places the receipts of a man's e&s;tate who liberated his negroes might not be tripled, but they might be con&s;iderably augmented, if his Negroes were gradually liberated in a judi|cious manner. It is well &s;aid, by the Bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter, in a &s;ermon which was preached a few years ago in England, before the &s;ociety for the propagation of the Go&s;pel in foreign parts: "If ever then we hope to make any progre&s;s in our benevolent purpo&s;e of communicating to our Negroes the benefits and the ble&s;&s;ings of religion, we mu&s;t fir&s;t give them &s;ome of the benefits and ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety and of civil government.

Having been previou&s;ly habituated to the climate and to hard labor, and animated at the &s;ame time by that &s;pirit, which freedom and gratitude, and the pro&s;pect of &s;ome little property never fail to in&s;pire, he would do three times the work of a languid, feeble, heart-broken &s;lave; and the plantation would be cultivated with far le&s;s expence to the proprietor than the frequent purcha&s;e of fre&s;h Negroes, and their maintenance in health, &s;ickne&s;s, and old age, amount to.

The German family likewi&s;e, forty in number, were employed in all manner of labor. And this was &s;o far from impairing our health that we all continued perfectly well, while the idle ones all round about us, were &s;wept away as with a pe&s;tilence."</P></NOTE> That this regulation might in a great mea&s;ure an&s;wer the end propo&s;ed appears
<PB N="112" REF="022434_0111_0FB87B1779244008">from the memoirs of Guilma, &s;uperior of the Indian Mi&s;&s;ion on the great river Oronoko, where he re&s;ided thirty years. He informs us, that a great number of Negroes on the coa&s;t of Curacoa, where it is &s;aid this regulation took place, had bought them&s;elves free; that of all tho&s;e who had been converted to chri&s;tianity, he had not known one, who ever turned back to his former heatheni&s;h practices; and that the King of Spain had not more faithful and more indu&s;trious &s;ubjects than the&s;e Negroes who were thus liberated. It has been ob&s;erved that if the Negroes were liberated they would not continue in the We&s;t-Indies, and the Planters would be ruined for the want of laborers to work their e&s;tates. If they were free they would become attached to the places where they were born, and would con&s;ider them in every re&s;pect as their country. It is probable al&s;o, if proper laws
<PB N="113" REF="022434_0112_0FB87B1B1D2F3100">were made in the We&s;t-Indies for the protection of the Negroes that many would go thither from England and other places. It is &s;aid in an ad|dre&s;s to the Honorable Sir William Dolben, Ba|ronet, &s;igned Thomas Cooper, Gu&s;tavus Va&s;&s;a, Thomas Jones, Ottobah Cugoana Steward, George Robert Mandevil, John Mandevil, who are free Negroes re&s;iding in England: "We are not ignorant, however, Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, that the be&s;t return we can make is, to beha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> with &s;obriety, fidelity, and diligence in our &s;everal &s;tations, whether remaining here under the protection of the laws, or colonizing our native &s;oil, as mo&s;t of us wi&s;h to do under the dominion of this country; or, as free laborers and artizans in the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, which, under equal laws, might become to men of our color places of voluntary and ve|ry general re&s;ort." This addre&s;s was printed in the London papers of July 1788.

It will be objected by &s;ome that the evidence, relative to the enormities in the treatment of Negroes which have been mentioned in the fore|going chapters, &s;hould be certain and unexcep|tionable. In an&s;wer to which it may be ob&s;erved that the evidence that may be produced is the mo&s;t certain and unexceptionable that can be conceived. Factors, of various nations, who in different times have been in Africa, allow that that the Negroes are frequently &s;tolen from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hence. They may be &s;aid to give evidence again&s;t their intere&s;t. Mr. Wad&s;trom, who is a man of character and rank in Sweden, went to Africa for the purpo&s;e of enquiring into the particulars of the &s;lave-trade. He &s;ays that the Negroes are generally &s;tolen from thence, and gives &s;uch in&s;tances of cruelty as would melt the heart if it were <HI>fle&s;h</HI> and not <HI>&s;tone.</HI> In this he is &s;upported by the evidence of other impartial re|putable per&s;ons. It is regularly proved, as ap|pears in the fifth chapter, in a Court of Ju&s;tice, that the crews of &s;ome &s;hips upon the coa&s;t of Africa, murdered a King, and carried his two brothers, with many other Negroes, into &s;lavery. Mr. Falconbridge and Mr. Newton, whom I have mentioned in the preceding part of my work, are men of credit, and were eye witne&s;&s;es of the &s;avage cruelties committed in a &s;lave ve&s;&s;el. What they have declared, may be coroborated
<PB N="115" REF="022434_0114_0FB87B1E185E3860">by the evidence of thou&s;ands. Mr. We&s;ley and Mr. Ram&s;ay, who have given long accounts of the treatment of the Negroes, were religious men, (as well as my&s;elf) and could be tempted by no intere&s;t to mi&s;repre&s;ent the matter. All candid men who have an opportunity of judg|ing, will &s;ay that we have generally &s;poken the truth. We were witne&s;&s;es of many of the facts which we write upon, and have not, inten|tionally, I believe, uttered a fal&s;ehood in regard to the mo&s;t trivial matter.</P>
<P>I think it nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve before I con|clude that it is ju&s;t to di&s;criminate between the Planters. There are &s;ome among this cla&s;s of people for whom I have a great regard. My father, who was a genuine de&s;cendant of the antient and highly illu&s;trious Hou&s;e of Craw|ford,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One branch of the family of Lind&s;ay, Earl of Crawford, were to take "the Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">name and Arms of Crawford."

In the female line I have relations in the We&s;t-Indies, who are the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of numerous &s;laves, for whom I bear a becoming affection. I have al&s;o in the
<PB N="116" REF="022434_0115_0FB87B1F02613120">Indies, many friends, from whom I have receiv|ed great civilities. In travelling through &s;eve|ral of the We&s;t-India i&s;lands I have met the mo&s;t liberal ho&s;pitality. The Planters are &s;ome|times poli&s;hed men, with the be&s;t education which Europe can afford. I have known &s;ome to live in great &s;plendor and elegance, and who di&s;daining the vulgar vicious cu&s;tom of pre&s;&s;ing their gue&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to drink, have permitted me to de|part from their hou&s;es, chearful and &s;atisfied, but &s;ober. Some of my relations and &s;ome of my friends are remarkable for the humanity with which they treat their &s;laves, and perhaps would not be unhappy if government were to adopt a rational plan for their gradual emanci|pation. It is not, therefore, from malice, that I give the&s;e Ob&s;ervations on Negro-Slavery, to the world, but from a firm, a holy, regard to truth, and a generous &s;olicitude for the intere&s;ts of the afflicted.</P>
<P>Some injudicious per&s;ons, in their rage again&s;t Negro-Slavery, are fond of repre&s;enting all the Planters, as men utterly de&s;titute of Principles and good manners. The celebrated Dr. Prie&s;t|ley, who, though all his religious tenets may not be defen&s;ible, is certainly, in many re&s;pects, an enlightened man, &s;ays, that the We&s;t-Indi|ans "are not them&s;elves aware, how much
<PB N="117" REF="022434_0116_0FB87B207AD8B668">their natures are deba&s;ed, and how offen&s;ive their behavior often is to others." In many, there may be this offen&s;ive behavior, and who&s;e natures may be much deba&s;ed, but in other natives of the We&s;t-Indies and the &s;outhern &s;tates of America, (I think I &s;hall not be accu&s;ed of partiality by tho&s;e who may properly judge of the matter) are to be found men of elegant manners and of generous &s;pirits. The We&s;t-In|dians are remarkable, as well as the natives of the &s;outhern &s;tates of America, for one virtue, the noble one of ho&s;pitality, in which many of their opponents &s;hould endeavor to imitate them.&mdash; This under proper regulations is the virtue of a Chri&s;tian. The Apo&s;tle recommends to "u&s;e ho&s;pitality one to another without grudging." 1 Peter, 4; 9.</P>
<P>It is to be lamented that in &s;ome of the &s;tates of America, where they have in &s;ome degree li|berated the Negroes, they have not advanced them to all the rights of men. Why, if their color is only the effect of climate, the effect of that glorious &s;un which we all admire, and God hath made of one blood all nations of men, and his &s;on has impartially redeemed them all, why, if the&s;e things are &s;o, do we haughtily keep them at &s;uch a di&s;tance from us? If the&s;e propo&s;itions are true, which I have indi&s;putably
<PB N="118" REF="022434_0117_0FB87B2284B736E0">proved in this work, which has been the pro|duce of much reading and con&s;ideration, a Negro &s;hould elect and be elected like other freemen; he &s;hould be &s;uffered to marry a white woman without their being per&s;ecuted; he &s;hould &s;it, if he de&s;erves it by his morals and his manners, at the fir&s;t of our tables; and &s;hould be encouraged to &s;it in religious meet|ings, not on a bench with Negroes only, but in|di&s;criminately with white people In &s;hort, he &s;hould be admi&s;&s;ible to all the rights, privileges, and honors, of a white man.</P>
<P>It is the duty of all the nations in the world who are engaged in the &s;lave-trade to de&s;i&s;t from the iniquitous occupation. I am aware of the objection that would be made to a di&s;continu|ance of the &s;lave-trade by intere&s;ted men. It would be &s;aid that a fre&s;h importation of Ne|groes is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the carrying on a We&s;t-Indian or American plantation. I am of a contrary opinion. If the &s;lave-trade is pro|hibited, the owners of the&s;e plantations, as it has been before ob&s;erved, can work them with the Negroes which they already po&s;&s;e&s;s. They would be prevented from the injury of their fortunes by the purcha&s;e of newly imported Ne|groes, which experience proves to be a fa&s;ci|nating and ruinous cu&s;tom to many. They
<PB N="119" REF="022434_0118_0FB87B239D726BF0">would al&s;o be induced, that they might rai&s;e a &s;uf|ficient number to cultivate their property, to treat their &s;laves with more humanity. The premium, which is &s;aid to be given of late of twenty &s;hillings to an Over&s;eer, who &s;hould rai&s;e any Negro child to one year's age upon any e&s;tate in Jamaica, would be offered in other places. The regula|tion e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements might be introduced, which experience has proved to be wi&s;e and &s;alutary, and not vi&s;ionary and pre|judicial. In addition to this regulation, a Code of Laws might be enacted, and properly execut|ed, for the &s;ecurity of various rights to the Ne|groes until the final obtainment of their free|dom. And above all things it would be happy if the Moravians, who are &s;cattered over the We&s;t-Indies, were every where invited to in|&s;truct the Negroes in the principles of chri&s;ti|anity. There is generally a remarkable difference between tho&s;e Negroes who attend to the preaching of the Moravians, and the others. They become, when influenced by the doctrines of this re&s;pectable &s;et of men, compo&s;ed, and decent in their appearance. Their dre&s;s is cleanly, without any thing in it that is gari&s;h or ab&s;urd. Their conduct al&s;o is indu&s;trious and moral. They &s;teal no more, are faithful to their tru&s;ts, and are capable, frequently, of advanc|ing, con&s;iderably, the intere&s;ts of their ma&s;ters.

The &s;ocieties therefore which have been formed for the abolition of the Slave-Trade would render an important &s;ervice to mankind by publi&s;hing the various tracts which have been written by men of talents in favor of the Negroes, and di&s;per&s;ing them about the world.
