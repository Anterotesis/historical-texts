<HEAD>THE CRISIS. NUMBER XXI.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>To Lord NORTH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the fewe&s;t words I can po&s;&s;ibly u&s;e (for I will not wa&s;te many upon you, who are as callous as your tyrannic ma&s;ter) I mo&s;t hear|tily congratulate your Lord&s;hip upon the honourable retreat of your unnatural and &s;avage mercenaries under the command of your bully, Col. Smith. I am told your ma&s;ter laughs at the event; you, who know him, know to which of his amiable qualities we are to impute this heroic merriment; whether to his brutality, his &s;tupidity, or hypocri&s;y. Let him remember, and do you tremble, when I tell your Lord&s;hip, that neither of tho&s;e qualities will avail him in the field, however they may be flattered in his &s;ycophantic circle at a fawning levee.</P>
<P>In the &s;ub&s;equent part of this paper, I have given a true rea&s;on for the early prorogation of your &s;muggled parliament. I have told how much your Lord&s;hip and your mini&s;terial gang feared the ar|rival of news from Bo&s;ton, during the &s;itting of parliament.</P>
<P>But why has your Lord&s;hip &s;topped the publi|cation
<PB N="174" REF="013987_0002_0F9259B562332850">of this plea&s;ing news in your Gazette? Why do you wait for the arrival of the Sukey? With what delu&s;ive lye do you intend to cheat the peo|ple, who, even in this kingdom, are upon the eve of taking arms? I tell your Lord&s;hip, peremptorily, that they will do &s;o. Though I know, that neither you, nor any of your impolitic, bloody herd, from the ma&s;ter butcher, down to his lowe&s;t &s;laughter|man, can relent, yet in the name of the people of England, I charge you all to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Forewarned, forearmed, my Lord, you have now, mo&s;t traiterou&s;ly opened a &s;cene of CIVIL WAR in America; let me conjure you not to ri&s;que one here. Turn over the annals of that weak tyrant Charles the fir&s;t? lay them fairly (in &s;pite of Bute and Mansfield) before your deluded, infatuated &s;o|vereign, dare to be hone&s;t in this dreadful CRISIS, do not, like a coward, con&s;ult your own &s;afety, but your country's. Let Bute and Mansfield peri&s;h; and, if there is a blacker parricide, let him fall too; nay, rather fall your&s;elf, my Lord, then lend a further hand to extingui&s;h liberty in this unhappy empire.</P>
<P>Your vain, your wicked hopes of conque&s;t in America, will mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly prove abortive; your retreating troops, your mercenary parricides (En|gland di&s;claims the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins) have drawn blood from the virtuous, the brave, the free Americans. It is the wi&s;h, my Lord, of every true born Bri|ton, that tho&s;e military hirelings (who are En|gland's ba&s;tards, not her &s;ons; may fall a &s;acrifice to the ju&s;tice of America. Re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, my Lord, that they will be cut to pieces before your murder|ous reinforcement, under that nece&s;&s;itous tool Bur|goyne, can po&s;&s;ibly arrive.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="013987_0003_0F9259B695DD6980">
That every reinforcement for &s;uch inhuman, un|natural, and unju&s;t purpo&s;es, may &s;hare the &s;ame fate, and that &s;truggling America may at la&s;t be free, or, if en&s;laved, that &s;he may di&s;dain to be en&s;laved by her tyrannic parent, is the pious prayer of every virtuous Briton, and the mo&s;t fervent wi&s;h of</P>

<P>NO Prince can be more a&s;toni&s;hed at the hum|ble &s;upplications of injured &s;ubjects than I am at the &s;hameful negligence of Charles Eyre and Wil|liam Strahan, Printers to the King's mo&s;t excellent Maje&s;ty. I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that his Maje&s;ty's la&s;t &s;peech is by far the fulle&s;t of typographical errors of any &s;ince the revolution. The&s;e errors will
<PB N="176" REF="013987_0004_0F9259B741186540">&s;eem palpable and obvious to every reader, who is not ignorant of the pre&s;ent critical &s;tate of Great-Britain and America. The royal Printers are the le&s;s excu&s;able for want of due attention, as a royal &s;peech is no ordinary compo&s;ition, it originates from Bute, is trimmed up by Mansfield, adopted by North, and pronounced by a royal orator; but as it is at la&s;t &s;ubmitted to the in&s;pection of the public, it mu&s;t, like other human compo&s;itions, undergo the public cen&s;ure.</P>

<P>"As far as the <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> will allow you")&mdash; That is to &s;ay, as far as Bute and Mansfield's un|con&s;titutional notions of the con&s;titution will allow; according to them, it allows only of the&s;e two al|ternatives, tyranny or death; America may take her choice. Every remon&s;trance, petition, and &s;uppli|cation of America, has been &s;purn'd by King, Lords, and Commons, two conciliatory plans, upon <HI>Con|&s;titutional, free, ju&s;t,</HI> and <HI>honourable principles,</HI> have been rejected in each Hou&s;e. The inhuman mini|&s;terial particides, &s;hould remember, however, that a conciliatory plan may be gladly embraced again by tyrants, when offered in the field, like the great one in Runny Mead, let them remember too, that upon the breaking out of a civil war, in this coun|try, corruption will not be able to &s;ecure to them the brave&s;t part, even of the &s;tanding army; not one of the con&s;titutional militia, nor a &s;ingle Gene|ral, equal to tho&s;e honourable men, who have al|ready refu&s;ed to bathe their &s;words in the blood of the &s;pirited Americans.

A name which Doctor John&s;on, in his dictionary, &s;ays, is to be found in the dictionary only; the Doctor at that time little thought of writing an infamous pamplet under that name.</P>
<P>"My <HI>faithful</HI> and <HI>beloved</HI> people"] By this di&s;|tingui&s;hing and re&s;pectful epithet <HI>(faithful)</HI> mu&s;t be meant the <HI>faithful majority</HI> of Lords and Com|mons. In the wheedling epithet <HI>(beloved)</HI> this ma|jority is al&s;o certainly included. But the &s;tiff-necked patriotic mini&s;try, the plaintive city of London, the injured &s;ubjects in general, and the brave American in particular, (not forgetting their truly noble friend Lord Effingham) are mo&s;t certainly excepted. As to the firm Americans, it is impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould be compri&s;ed in the&s;e tender terms; becau&s;e his Maje&s;ty is mo&s;t graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to intimate, a little before that if his firm and &s;teady parliament had not, with a firm and &s;teady re&s;olution, devoted that part of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects to de&s;truction, the rights of his crown, the authority of parlia|ment, and the commercial intere&s;ts of his kingdoms, could not be maintained, protected and promoted. The nece&s;&s;ary inference from the&s;e words is, that nothing can maintain, protect, or promote, the true intere&s;ts of the Briti&s;h empire, but popery, &s;word, and famine, I may add tyranny, and taxa|tion. If the above &s;ugared words (<HI>faithful</HI> and <HI>beloved</HI>) are extended generally, they mu&s;t be look|ed upon as &s;prings to catch woodcocks, they remind me of that &s;hrew'd reflection which Shake&s;pear
<PB N="180" REF="013987_0008_0F9259BA5E7637C0">puts into the mouth of Hot&s;pur, upon King Hen|ry's &s;weet words, to that young Hero, whil&s;t his Maje&s;ty was cajoling him (as he &s;ays) like a fawn|ing greyhound, viz.</P>

<P>Q.&mdash;Whether this early prorogation is not as truly &s;ymtomatic of the Mini&s;ter's fears, as the &s;udden di&s;&s;olution was of the la&s;t infamous parlia|ment? This early prorogation (by Mansfield's ad|vice) &s;hews, that after all the foul mouth'd, bul|lying, in&s;olence of a tyrannic admini&s;tration, they dare not protract the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament any longer for fear of hearing news from America (which they could not conceal) during that &s;e&s;&s;ion. This vacation, therefore, is artfully contrived to give breath to a confu&s;ed, di&s;tracted, and trembling admini&s;tration; at the opening of the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, (if this vile admini&s;tration lives &s;o long) we may (under Bute and Mansfield's au&s;pices) expect &s;ome curious &s;tate manoeuvre, ready cut and dryed. I will venture to prophe&s;y with more cer|tainty than Lord Sandwich, Lord Denbig, or any other mini&s;terial bully in the gang, that we &s;hall at la&s;t &s;ee, not a rational political gratification o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> the wi&s;hes; but a pitiful, mean, contemptible, and da&s;tardly &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, (by downright compul&s;ion) to the ju&s;t demands of America. I call upon my countrymen, to remember, that &s;o in&s;ignificant an individual as Ca&s;ca, now foretells that neither the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration, nor, (as I fear) the pre&s;ent reign will end till they have &s;upplied matter for a dreadful and mo&s;t exemplary record in the Briti&s;h annals.</P>
