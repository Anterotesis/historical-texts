<P>I HAVE undertaken a piece of bu&s;ine&s;s of no &s;mall im|portance, that of e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of a million and an half of human beings, now groaning under the infer|nal yoke of &s;lavery: and I have been induced to put this publication under your protection, the rather, becau&s;e I am convinced, that in many in&s;tances, the principles there|in contained have been adopted already. In this work, I &s;peak to men of a great variety of &s;entiments; but I &s;hall cla&s;s them briefly under two heads; viz. tho&s;e who believe in the &s;criptures and all that is therein contained; and tho&s;e who take rea&s;on for their guide: and with re|&s;pect to the former of the&s;e, I &s;hall only remark, that they may find many and &s;trong proofs in the &s;criptures, of the truth of what I have advanced in the cour&s;e of this work&mdash;With regard to the latter, rea&s;on will not admit, that any man has a right to another man's money or other property; and con&s;equently that he has not a right to u&s;urp that time which the Almighty has given every man, to provide &s;ub&s;i&s;tance and comfort for him&s;elf and family; and I am per&s;uaded, that many of you, my fellow citizens, have long &s;ince con&s;idered the &s;lave-trade as both iniquitous and unrea&s;onable; and however a man may &s;ay that a &s;lave, who has been bought with his mo|ney,

is his property; yet that does not alter the fraud of the principle, any more than a man buying &s;tolen pro|perty of a thief, and paying his money for it, gives him a warrantee title thereto; in the one ca&s;e, the property has been clande&s;tinely obtained; in the other, the man's li|berty has been withheld by force, and in defiance of ju&s;tice and humanity; however, &s;ome of my fellow-citizens, may not approve this work, yet I hope they will read it with attention, and the time may come when they may &s;ee the truth contained in it; namely, that ju&s;tice and huma|nity are the two greate&s;t virtues that di&s;tingui&s;h man from the brute creation; and I have long admired the di&s;intere&s;ted philanthropy of the Quakers with re&s;pect to the Africans, which in my opinion is their brighte&s;t cha|racteri&s;tic; and though they &s;eem to be thwarted in their benevolent intentions at pre&s;ent, yet I hope to &s;ee the time, when their mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations on that head will be realized; and I &s;hall only add, that if this work &s;hould be fortunate enough to meet with approbation, and be the cau&s;e of bettering the condition of only one human being, I &s;hall be happy that I have undertaken it, hoping therefore for your indulgence,</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>I AM fully convinced, that &s;uch a publication as this will meet violent oppo&s;ition in the minds of many who are bound more by intere&s;t than ju&s;tice or humanity; and if a man betray no &s;igns of flagrant inju&s;tice in his com|mon dealings among the red of mankind, with re&s;pect to pecuniary matters, be is generally cryed up for an hone&s;t man, a man of un&s;potted reputation &amp;c. but we are too apt to look over his conduct, as it relates to the poor ig|norant African, groaning under the yoke which he has laid upon him, and that any particular de&s;cription of mankind whether of one, or another &s;tature or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">our, were intended, by the great Creator of all, to be herd in a &s;tate of abject and cringing dependance upon men of any de&s;cription, is a doctrine, which I never could &s;ee into, either from motives of religion, morality, rea&s;on or policy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the &s;lave-trade according to the con&s;truction generally put upon that word, is meant that &s;y&s;tem which relates to the buying and &s;elling the natives of Africa. But altho' this be the general acceptation of the term &s;lave-trade yet it cannot be de|nied that every &s;y&s;tem, whether political, religions or dome&s;tic, that tends to &s;etter the mind or body of man, and deprive him of the utmo&s;t extent of his rights in a greater or le&s;s degree, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> of that &s;y&s;tem.</NOTE> My intention is to lay national affairs entirely a&s;ide, and
<PB N="6" REF="047013_0006_10229055AE2752A8">
con&s;ider the two extremes, of De&s;poti&s;m and Slavery, as they apply to individuals only.</P>
<P>In order to come at the truth of any matter, it is often improper to take it up in that &s;tate, in which we find it, as coming through a number of hands; the real &s;tate of the ca&s;e may be ob&s;cured by fal&s;ehood and deceit, and it is therefore nece&s;&s;ary to inve&s;tigate the &s;ubject to the very &s;ource, by which means it is more than probable we may come at the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e. That it has been cu&s;to|mary in all ages and countries, &s;ince the earth has been tolerably inhabited, to keep &s;laves, is a truth, which, though it cannot be denied, yet it ought to be lamented for the pa&s;t and avoided for the future; and in the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the world after the deluge, there being little or no government among mankind, to re&s;train the &s;trong and turbulant, and protect the weak and more peaceable, it is no wonder if a few ruffians of one neighbourhood, depending more upon their own &s;trength, than any regard to ju&s;tice, &s;hould go to another, pillage the place, and carry off not only the &s;poils, but oftentimes the children of the helple&s;s inhabitants; which children, being kept continually as &s;laves, and brought up in that &s;tate, hav|ing no idea of any other &s;ituation of life, became recon|ciled to it, and appeared no way anxious about changing their &s;tation; but however reconciled a man may be to a &s;tate of &s;lavery, or however &s;atisfied with his lot he may appear in the eyes of the world to be, yet all this does not alter the fraud of the principle on the part of the con|queror or ma&s;ter. It is in the above manner that &s;lavery has crept in upon mankind by degrees, and been handed down from generation to generation, until it has arrived at the pre&s;ent period, in which it is continued and &s;upport|ed in a more criminal extent than has ever before been equalled in the annals of the world; and that it was cu&s;tomary in the fir&s;t age after the deluge, for the con|querors to make &s;laves or captives of the conquered, can ea&s;ily be proved to the &s;atisfaction of any one who believes in the old te&s;tament, in the ca&s;e of the Sodomites being
<PB N="7" REF="047013_0007_10229057422D6B38">
carried away captive, by Chedalaomer, king of the Ela|mites or Per&s;ians, after he had defeated them; and we al&s;o read, that Abraham hearing of this defeat of the Sodo|mites, and that his nephew's lot was among the captives, armed his own &s;ervants to the number of three hundred and eighteen, and pur&s;uing the conquerors, overtook them, attacked them and defeated them, recovering all the &s;poils which they had taken, together with the men of Sodom. As we do not read that Abraham ever went to war, either before or after this expedition, it is plain that he could not have got the&s;e &s;ervants by conque&s;t; and therefore mu&s;t have got them by &s;ome other means; and the mo&s;t probable pre&s;umption is that he bought them from &s;ome of the neighbouring conquerors, who either having enough others, or thinking it un&s;afe to keep too many among them&s;elves, lea&s;t they might attempt to re|gain their liberty, or perhaps in order to enable them the better to carry on their depredations, fell into the method of &s;elling them to tho&s;e who would give the highe&s;t price for them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As to tho&s;e who do not believe in the Scriptures, they may find almo&s;t innumerable proofs in hi&s;tory of nations and indivi|duals making &s;laves of their conquered enemies, particularly the ancient A&s;&s;yrians, and the Romans. Hi&s;tory abounds with re|lations of this nature, but it is needle&s;s at pre&s;ent to &s;ay any thing further upon the &s;ubject.</NOTE></P>
<P>As I have before &s;tated, the avowed object of this publication, is to prove in a &s;atisfactory manner the fraud and unrea&s;onablene&s;s of the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of &s;lavery, as it applies to the unhappy Africans; not only as it relates to bringing an additional number into the country, but al&s;o as it relates to tho&s;e already here; and it is con|tended by many of the advocates for this inhuman traffic, that "the Africans are the &s;eed of Cain, and that the mark which the great Creator &s;et upon their forefather, was to change his colour from white to black, and that this colour was to follow his po&s;terity as long as the
<PB N="8" REF="047013_0008_10229059CA8B8620">
world &s;tands, and that &s;lavery was to be their unalterable lot, during that time." To this I reply, that the mark &s;et upon Cain, as far as I can di&s;cover from the bible, was no other than a di&s;tinction of him from the re&s;t of mankind, in order that no one &s;hould lay violent hands upon him and &s;lay him; for it evidently appears to me that God intended to puni&s;h him while here upon earth by tho&s;e &s;tings of con&s;cience, which guilt, and the merited contempt of the re&s;t of mankind, never &s;ail to bring upon the wretch who is &s;o unfortunate as to de&s;erve them; nei|ther can we form any probable opinion, whether the mark &s;et upon Cain, was any change in his colour or not; it might have been a crop of the ear, or a thou&s;and other things, as well as a change of his colour; but admitting that his colour was changed, it might as well have been purple, green, yellow, &amp;c. as black; and the black people might as well contend that before that time, all men were black, and that Cain was made white; and &s;till have as good grounds to argue upon, as the advocates for &s;lavery have, when they &s;ay that Cain was made black; for I do not recollect any pa&s;&s;age in the bible that &s;ays what was Adam or Eve's colour, and add to this, we cannot find any pa&s;&s;age to ju&s;tify an opinion, that any of Cain's &s;eed were in the ark; and if there were, it mu&s;t have come from the wives of &s;ome one or more of the Patriarchs, or have been the wife of &s;ome one or other of Noah's &s;ons. As the Chronology in the male line is brought down from Adam, by which it plainly appears that all the males who were in the ark, were de&s;cended from Seth, the third &s;on of Adam; and as we read, and have every rea&s;on to be|lieve, that the de&s;cendants of Seth held no intercour&s;e with tho&s;e of Cain, it amounts almo&s;t to po&s;itive proof that Cain's po&s;terity were all cut off by the deluge.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As this work may fall into the hands of many who do not believe that there ever was a deluge which de&s;troyed all man|kind, except Noah and the other &s;even per&s;ons mentioned in the account given of that event in the bible; I &s;hall only de&s;erve that if they object to that belief they mu&s;t al&s;o of nece&s;&s;ity, object to the belief of there ever having been &s;uch a man as Cain; both tho&s;e accounts re&s;ting upon the &s;ame foundation, viz. the credibi|lity of the authors of the bible, let them be who they may.</NOTE> But ad|mitting
<PB N="9" REF="047013_0009_1022905C41B96418">
for argument &s;ake, that the wives of Noah's &s;ons, were entirly of the blood of Cain, it would then follow, of cour&s;e, that their po&s;terity (being of the &s;eed of Cain on the one &s;ide, and that of Seth on the other) they would be the equal de&s;cendants of both tho&s;e ance&s;tors; and therefore it would be impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h between them, which was to be con&s;idered as the po&s;terity of the one, and which the po&s;terity of the other; and for in|&s;tance, &s;uppo&s;e Cain's po&s;terity (according to the argu|ments, or rather a&s;&s;ertions, of the advocates of &s;lavery) to have been black, and the po&s;terity of Seth to have been white, by the intermarriage of Noah's &s;ons with women de&s;cended from Cain, and according to the cour&s;e of na|ture, their children mu&s;t have been between black and white, or in other words, what we term mulattoes; and tho&s;e children having no other colour to intermarry with, would never to the pre&s;ent generation have varied their colour (except according to the inten&s;e heat of &s;ome, and cold of other climates) nor as I have ju&s;t ob&s;erved, would it be po&s;&s;ible for any one of them to convince the other, that he was the per&s;on alluded to in God's &s;etting a mark upon Cain, and mu&s;t therefore be his &s;ervant; as the other would have full as good a foundation to retort it upon the fir&s;t, and &s;ay that he was the &s;eed of Cain, and thus would mankind be eternally &s;heding the blood of man in vain, without a po&s;&s;ibility of ever arriving at the right of the &s;tory.</P>
<P>As for my own part I cannot conceive that the Creator ever intended to put &s;uch a &s;tumbling block in the way of mankind, much le&s;s how could we (at the di&s;tance of up|wards of four thou&s;and years after the flood) pretend to &s;ay, "this or that man is one of Cain's po&s;terity; and I being one of the de&s;cendants of Seth, am his right and
<PB N="10" REF="047013_0010_1022905F8C941F90">
lawful ma&s;ter." And again, admitting the wife of one of Noah's &s;ons only to have been a de&s;cendant of Cain, and that the di&s;tinction could ea&s;ily be made between the po&s;te|rity of the one and the po&s;terity of the other two; it is hold|ing up an idea the mo&s;t derogatory to the ju&s;tice of the great Creator, to &s;uppo&s;e he would be guilty (not only of inju&s;tice but of double inju&s;tice) fir&s;t, to inflict a heri|ditary puni&s;hment upon one man and his po&s;terity, where|by thou&s;ands, or perhaps millions of innocent per&s;ons mu&s;t &s;uffer in an abject &s;tate of &s;lavery, for the guilt of one man who had &s;inned; and &s;econdly, that his revenge not being &s;atiated upon the fir&s;t, that he &s;hould blend the &s;eed of the innocent with that of the guilty, and deal out the bitter cup of &s;lavery and di&s;grace to their po&s;terity to the end of time. And I believe the Almighty (to u&s;e the language of Mr. Paine) to be too ju&s;t to do any &s;uch a thing, and too Almighty to be driven to the nece&s;&s;ity of doing it. I never can be brought over to join a doc|trine that requires me to have &s;o mean an opinion of my Creator, e&s;pecially when it re&s;ts on &s;o &s;lender a founda|tion.</P>
<P>By what I have &s;aid, I tru&s;t I &s;hall remove the belief of the Africans now among us, being the de&s;cendants of Cain, from the mind of every per&s;on who &s;hall &s;ee this work, unle&s;s he be a per&s;on who, lo&s;t to every &s;entiment of humanity or benevolence, &s;eeks only to hoard up riches at the expence of injured humanity, and by &s;tifling rea&s;on, morality, and every generous &s;entiment of the human heart to carry his favorite de&s;ign into execution.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING in the foregoing chapter offered my rea|&s;ons for &s;uppo&s;ing that the pre&s;ent generation of Africans, are not the de&s;cendants of Cain; I propo&s;e in the pre&s;ent one, to inve&s;tigate this matter a little further; hoping that I &s;hall &s;ufficiently prove at all events, that the &s;lave-trade is both unrea&s;onable and unju&s;t. It is &s;aid, by another cla&s;s of the advocates for the &s;lave-trade, that "they are de&s;cended from Canaan, the &s;on of Ham, and grand-&s;on of Noah, and that they lay under this cur&s;e for the &s;in which Canaan's father (Ham) committed by making &s;port of Noah when he was drunk in his tent;" and that the Africans are de&s;cended from Ham, is ex|ceedingly probable, both from &s;cripture, and hi&s;tory.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Both of which agree that Ham was the fir&s;t &s;ettler of Egypt, from whence it is more than probable his de&s;cendants penetrated into, and peopled the interior and more &s;outhern part of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> But what can be the rea&s;on that the cur&s;e is only in part put in execution (in that there are millions of Africans &s;till at liberty, and con&s;equently not fulfilling the &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon them) I am totally at a lo&s;s to account for. Be&s;ides, it appears from the bible, that Noah had been drunk but ju&s;t before he pa&s;&s;ed the &s;entence upon Canaan; and it does not appear to me, that a man who had ju&s;t been laying dormant the powers of rea&s;on, the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing that God has given to man, was at that time a fit judge to pronounce &s;entence upon a man who had of|fended him, and much le&s;s again&s;t the &s;on who was inno|cent of what the father had done.</P>
<P>But what does the &s;entence amount to? is it any tem|porary puni&s;hment which was to be inflicted upon Canaan, for what his father had done? No&mdash;it was to lay his whole off&s;pring under the cur&s;e of &s;lavery, for a fault committed by his father, of which he was innocent, and
<PB N="12" REF="047013_0012_10229063DF7AF9A8">
which (it is not probable) was a greater fault than that committed by Noah him&s;elf, in getting drunk: in &s;hort, Noah &s;eems by the reading of the pa&s;&s;age, to have been over-ruled by his pa&s;&s;ion, at the time of his cur&s;ing his grand-&s;on; and whether or not this may be the ca&s;e, I cannot find from &s;cripture or rea&s;on, whence he derived his authority to cur&s;e him; or the power to give efficacy to his denunciations after they were made. Neither does it appear to me, to corre&s;pond with divine or moral ju&s;tice or mercy, that the &s;on &s;hould be made liable for the &s;ins of the father; much le&s;s, that his po&s;terity for four thou|&s;and years, &s;hould continue &s;laves for the expiation of his guilt; and add to all this, that one of the prophets has &s;aid (and we are told that it is bla&s;phemy to di&s;believe them) no longer &s;hould the proverb be u&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ezekiel,</HI> 18, 2.</NOTE> "that the fathers have eaten four grapes, and the children's teeth been &s;et on edge." From whence I infer that man is to be accountable for his own actions only, and indeed the &s;equel of the chapter plainly demon&s;trates it to be &s;o.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing Noah to have been in a perfect and un|di&s;turbed &s;tate of mind at the time of his cur&s;ing his grand|&s;on, I cannot &s;ee how that cur&s;e ought to effect him or his po&s;terity, and how many daily in&s;tances do we &s;ee of men cur&s;ing their brothers, children, &amp;c. and yet we do not &s;ee that tho&s;e cur&s;es have any effect what&s;oever; ex|cept &s;uch as may be produced by the influence of the cur&s;er among men,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">By allienating their affections from the cur&s;ed.</NOTE> and I &s;hould rather take it for an example of the folly of &s;uch imprecations, than any prin|ciple that ought to awe a child into an undue obedience of an unju&s;t and unrea&s;onable command, of a &s;ordid pa|rent; and in a word, I di&s;pute the right of Noah or any other man that ever lived, to cur&s;e his off&s;pring yet un|born, thereby entailing &s;lavery upon them. My father had no right to cur&s;e me, and if he had done it, it would not have had any bad effect upon me: I have no right to
<PB N="13" REF="047013_0013_102290681940D800">
cur&s;e my offspring, neither had Noah, or any other man, a right which was not al&s;o applicable to every other man.</P>
<P>To &s;um up the whole&mdash;If Noah had a right to cur&s;e his grand-&s;on and his po&s;terity, it certainly admits, that every other man had a right to do the &s;ame with re&s;pect to their grand-&s;ons &amp;c. and according to that doctrine, we &s;hould &s;oon have the whole human race cur&s;ed into &s;lave|ry, for &s;ome real or &s;uppo&s;ed mi&s;demeanor, and none left for ma&s;ters, to lord it over them. A thing, that is incon&s;i&s;tent in it&s;elf, and morally impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>From the&s;e con&s;iderations, I am fully convinced, that the &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon Canaan has nothing at all to do with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;lavery, into which the unhappy Africans are plunged.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore proceed to offer a few other remarks, in order to &s;hew, as far as I am capable, the ab&s;urdity of this hateful traffic of human fle&s;h and blood.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP III.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING mentioned two principle points on which the advocates for the &s;lave-trade place their dependence, and having offered my rea&s;ons for viewing the &s;ubject in a different light, I &s;hall next proceed to &s;tate a third a&s;&s;er|tion of their's, and endeavour to confute it as well as I can both from &s;cripture and rea&s;on. They &s;ay that the colour, hair, &amp;c. of the Africans, is different from that of a white man, and that the&s;e differences are &s;ufficient evidences that the Almighty intended them for &s;laves. What an ab&s;urd argument is this! to &s;ay that he who knows no difference between man and man, &s;hould have &s;uch a par|tiality for this, that, or the other colour; or if he had, might we not as rea&s;onably expect him to be partial to the blacks as the whites; or to the tawny coloured Indian as either?</P>
<P>Reader, if you believe in the old or new te&s;tament, you may find many pa&s;&s;ages in them which altogether con|demn the practice of making &s;laves of our fellow creatures; and that they are our fellow-creatures cannot be denied; they have a rational mind, if properly cultivated; many of them are per&s;ons of bright talents, but for the mo&s;t part, tho&s;e talents are lo&s;t to mankind for want of proper culti|vation and encouragement.</P>
<P>Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ays, that the fir&s;t, and great command|ment is "thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy mind, with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy &s;trength;" and that the &s;econd is like unto it, namely, "thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf." In the fir&s;t place then &s;earch the new te&s;tament, and you will find it po&s;&s;itively proved, that every man breathing is our neighbour, according to the doctrine of the aforementioned great philanthropi&s;t, who had the mo&s;t unbounded compa&s;&s;ion for all men, and was a great lover of mercy. That the Africans are men, I pre&s;ume the mo&s;t barefaced per&s;on in America, will not pretend to deny; it therefore re&s;ults, from the&s;e proofs,

fir&s;t, that the Africans are men, and &s;econdly, that all mankind are our neighbours; that the keepers of &s;laves are guilty of a breach of the commandment that is the &s;econd one in magnitude; and as long as that &s;in is left unrepented of, he can never enter the kingdom of heaven (according to the Chri&s;tian religion) and if it is repented of, and the cau&s;e not removed, it is ju&s;t leaving the &s;ame thing to be repented of again at a future day. It is as if a thief having repented of his former actions, continues the &s;ame cour&s;e of life &s;aying, that he could repent of his future actions at a future time. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This kind of conduct is holding up the idea of keeping a running book account with the Almighty, &s;ometimes charging, and &s;ometimes giving credit.</NOTE> Again&mdash;Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ays, do inju&s;tice to no man; how can a follower of his reconcile the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages to his own conduct, in keeping his brother a &s;lave? If a man has wrought hard, and earned a &s;um of money, is it ju&s;t that another &s;hould come, and take it away from him? I pre&s;ume that every man of rea&s;on will &s;ay not; if this is not ju&s;tice, neither is it ju&s;t to withhold from him, that time in which, by his indu&s;try he may acquire that money, whether it be more or le&s;s.</P>
<P>Then if Je&s;us Chri&s;t has commanded his followers to do inju&s;tice to no man, and on a careful examination, a man finds that he is oppre&s;&s;ing his neighbour (perhaps the widow, or the orphan) and con&s;equently doing inju&s;|tice to &s;ome per&s;on, I &s;ay, how ill do that man's actions accord with the profe&s;&s;ions of his lips, or with the amiable conduct of him whom they pretend to follow, who never injured a man in his life, much le&s;s, en&s;laved him. It is further &s;aid, by the &s;ame per&s;on (Je&s;us Chri&s;t) in com|paring men to &s;ervants of a great man, who went a long journey, that one of the &s;ervants got drunk and began to beat and abu&s;e the other &s;ervants in his lord's ab&s;ence, and that he was puni&s;hed &s;everely for it at his lord's re|turn. From this I draw an inference, that the Almighty
<PB N="16" REF="047013_0016_1022906F6F8A70D0">
is the Lord there &s;poken of, and that men are the &s;ervants; and that they are to be called to account hereafter for their actions; if &s;o, what mu&s;t be the &s;ituation of many who having en&s;laved their fellow &s;ervants, abu&s;e them without mercy? in &s;hort, their conduct is diametrically oppo&s;ite to the mild and philanthropic doctrine taught by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>We come next to take a view of the manner of procur|ing &s;laves in Africa. This is done in a variety of ways; fir&s;t, two nations being at war with each other, the poor wretches who are &s;o unfortunate as to be taken pri&s;oners, are &s;old by the captain to the fir&s;t good bidder. Secondly, I am told, that their princes exerci&s;e a de&s;potic &s;way over them, by which, they will &s;ell hundreds annually to all countries that want them. Thirdly, for any offence committed again&s;t their laws, or rather barbarous and ar|bitrary cu&s;toms, the king will &s;ell them which bears &s;ome affinity to the Briti&s;h government, &s;ending their (pretended) offenders to Botany-Bay; only with this difference, that the latter &s;end them for a certain term, whereas the former &s;end them not only during life, but for generations yet unborn. Fourthly, if any man owes a debt which he is unable to pay, the creditor &s;eizes upon the fir&s;t of the debtor's family that falls in his way; &s;ells him, or her at the next &s;ea-port town, to the be&s;t bidder; and thus en|tails &s;lavery upon a man's po&s;terity, on account of a trifling debt, which perhaps a few days labour would di&s;charge; and fifthly, the officers and crews of &s;hips, often kidknap the innocent creatures, particularly children, in the woods and along the &s;ea coa&s;t. There may be many other methods of obtaining them, but the&s;e are the chief with which I am acquainted.</P>
<P>Let me a&s;k any man of common &s;en&s;e or rea&s;on, if he can find the man innocent who having been in the Briti&s;h or French &s;ervice, and having taken a pri&s;oner, has &s;old him to an American; or would not the purcha&s;er be equ|ally guilty with the &s;eller? certainly he would, if he knew that the &s;eller came di&s;hone&s;tly by that property which he
<PB N="17" REF="047013_0017_1022907105C13888">
&s;old to him; and certainly no man can come &s;o hone&s;tly by another man, as to be authorized to make &s;ale of him, as of a hor&s;e or a cow. In the like manner let him take any of the other ca&s;es that I have mentioned, and con&s;ider what ought to be done with the man who has been guilty of one of the&s;e means of oppre&s;&s;ing his neighbour. In a word, let any man of rea&s;on or candour (I care not whe|ther he is a religious man or not) take the matter home to him&s;elf, and &s;ay how he would reli&s;h to have his wife and children, or either of them, or perhaps, his brother or &s;i&s;ter, torn away from him and dragged to a foreign country, he knows not where, nor how to be u&s;ed. Let him contemplate the wife of his bo&s;om, or a beloved &s;i&s;ter, laboring in the open field with little or no cloathing to keep them decent, or guard them from the inclemency of the weather; with an unmerciful wretch of a driver, who knows no more of humanity than a tyger or a panther, to abu&s;e them on every frivolous occa&s;ion; and let him fol|low them from the field to the wretched hut, in which they &s;pend their melancholy nights; and view them with a &s;canty mor&s;el of mi&s;erable food, &s;carce &s;ufficient to keep nature alive. Having brought his imagination to this point, let him lay his hand upon his heart, and in the pre&s;ence of him who made man, &s;ay whether or not this is ju&s;tice, mercy, rea&s;on, or religion. If he cannot give it his ap|probation, when it applies to him&s;elf or his connections&punc; neither ought he when it applies to others, for that would not be doing what he would wi&s;h to have done to him|&s;elf. I am not, as many may think I am, for &s;etting the Africans free immediately, in that &s;tate of ignorance and darkne&s;s in which they have been gropeing this long time. But I &s;hall, in the en&s;uing chapter, give &s;ome hints of a plan, which I have engendered in my own mind, for &s;etting them all free in time, and making worthy citizens of them. Permit me reader, to a&s;k you one que&s;tion; &s;uppo&s;e your&s;elf taken by any means whatever, and carried into a foreign country, and there u&s;ed as many of the Afri|cans are here; would you hold any attempt too hazard|ous
<PB N="18" REF="047013_0018_10229073773A84F0">
to regain your liberty and return to your country and friends? certainly not; why then condemn another man for that which in your&s;elf you would e&s;teem the greate&s;t virtue in your compo&s;ition, the love of liberty? If you do, you act contrary to that &s;ublime and glorious principle, "do as you would wi&s;h to be done by." A few words more, and I will clo&s;e this chapter. At the time when the American war commenced, it was declared that all men were born, and of right ought to be free; and this prin|ciple was held up as the creed of nine tenths of the peo|ple in America. Let him then, who fought for liberty upon tho&s;e principles, and he who has any thing to &s;ay in prai&s;e of the glorious Fourth of July, 1776, remember that he is acting diametrically oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e principles, provided he keeps either man, woman, or child in &s;lavery.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>IN the former part of this work, I have endeavoured to convince all men of the inju&s;tice and unrea&s;onablene&s;s of keeping &s;laves. I come now to &s;ugge&s;t a plan for &s;et|ting them free: with regard to this, people may differ greatly, it being a matter of great magnitude; for my own part, I &s;hall only attempt to drop a few hints on the &s;ubject. To &s;et all the &s;laves in America free at once, in their pre&s;ent ignorant &s;tate of mind, would be fraught with great danger to the community at large; and &s;till more &s;o to individuals. The plan therefore which I would recommend is this; that every per&s;on having a &s;lave, from ten years old, and younger, or that may be born hereafter, be obliged to regi&s;ter the name and al&s;o the time and place of birth of the &s;aid &s;lave, in an office to be kept in each di&s;trict for that purpo&s;e. And let each &s;uch per&s;on be obliged upon penalty of forfeiting the &s;um of &mdash;to teach or cau&s;e to be taught, to the &s;aid &s;lave,
<PB N="19" REF="047013_0019_102290750BB1AAE8">
the arts of reading and writing by the time he or &s;he &s;hall have attained the age of fifteen years. By this means, they may be &s;natched from ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition, and the way fairly paved for making good citizens of them when they come to be &s;et free, which might be fixed at the age of one or two and twenty; during which time, they ought not to be allowed to be taken out of one &s;tate into another, lea&s;t they &s;hould at la&s;t be cheated out of their freedom. Perhaps &s;ome people may ridicule the idea of &s;etting the Africans free, becau&s;e they are intere&s;t|ed in keeping them &s;laves; but every man who has the feeling of a man, mu&s;t acknowledge, that though the keeping of &s;laves has acquired the &s;anction of cu&s;tom, yet it is unju&s;t in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word. Hence I am inclined to hope that my propo&s;ition, after receiving amendments, from abler pens, may meet the ideas of mo&s;t people who are generally agreed that it is not right to keep them, but di&s;agree as to the method of &s;et|ting them at liberty. If I have offended any man, by the open manner in which I have &s;poken of this infamous traffic, I would not have him blame me for &s;peaking my &s;entiments upon the &s;ubject; but rather blame him&s;elf for his imprudence in leaving a door open to cen&s;ure. Con|&s;ider man (whoever thou art, that en&s;lave&s;t thy fellow creature) that it would be far better for thee to take pro|per mea&s;ures in hand for &s;etting him free at a convenient time, than by tyrannizing over him all the days of his life; to make him thy enemy and perhaps put thy life in danger from his thir&s;t for revenge; and above all, render thy&s;elf obnoxious to the great Creator, who is thy ma&s;ter. If the Africans were free, the country would receive a great addition to its pre&s;ent &s;trength; becau&s;e every one of this hardy race of people, who had by their indu&s;try ac|quired a property, though ever &s;o little, would no doubt &s;tand in defence of it; whereas, at pre&s;ent they have no|thing for which it is worth their while to venture their lives; for if a man is to be a &s;lave all his life, what mat|ters it to him, whether his ma&s;ter is a Frenchman, an Engli&s;hman, or an American?</P>

<P>The late decree of the National Convention of France, freeing all their negroes at once, is a great decree, and worthy the patriotic band who pa&s;&s;ed it; but for want of a little education being be&s;towed upon them in time, I fear they will be very di&s;orderly during the pre&s;ent ge|neration; as many people pretend to &s;ay, that that decree was only pa&s;&s;ed upon political, and not upon moral prin|ciples; I &s;hall only &s;ay, that it is immeterial what was the motive, &s;o that it an&s;wers the grand object, that of re&s;toring an injured people to their long lo&s;t rights.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now quit the &s;ubject altogether, well per&s;uaded that (however it may, or may not meet the approbation of my fellow-citizens) I have done my duty, and hoping that this &s;mall &s;pecimen of my poor abilities may meet their &s;erious con&s;ideration.</P>
