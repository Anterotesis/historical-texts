</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS day is con&s;ecrated to academical exer|ci&s;es. The beauties of &s;cience, and the charms of philo&s;ophy, are doubtle&s;s the mo&s;t appo&s;ite themes for cla&s;&s;ical declamation. In this re&s;pect, how|ever, the &s;peakers of to-day have always had their choice. If propriety and decorum be con&s;ulted, they are not confined to any particular de&s;cription of &s;ub|jects. He, who now addre&s;&s;es you, would not advance a principle, or anticipate a po&s;&s;ible juncture of circum|&s;tances, which might dimini&s;h the hilarity, or violate the &s;olemnities of the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. If his theme, or his &s;entiments, &s;hould be unplea&s;ant to a &s;ingle in|dividual in hearing, that individual may be a&s;&s;ured, that, neither the one was cho&s;en, nor &s;hall the others be exhibited, with any reference to any occa&s;ion, or any de&s;cription of citizens.</P>
<P>THIS fe&s;tive anniver&s;ary, this civick and cla&s;&s;ical pa|rade, the concour&s;e, the &s;plendour, and even the very countenances of this numerous a&s;&s;embly, are &s;o many te&s;timonials of the felicity of our country. But there are truths which tell us all the&s;e delights of peace may be violated. When we &s;ee yonder en&s;ign, unfolding its red bo&s;om to the winds of heaven, we feel the po&s;&s;i|bility of war. "Steel may glitter in the mu&s;es &s;hade."</P>
<P>The fir&s;t monitions of philo&s;ophy teach us to enjoy with moderation, and hope rationally; to familiarize the idea of probable calamities, and, if po&s;&s;ible, deduce beneficial con&s;equences from them. Influenced by this con&s;ideration, I have cho&s;en War for the pre&s;ent theme. Let us, for a few moments, contemplate the ne|ce&s;&s;ity, the ju&s;tice, the effects of war; and ob&s;erve what reference they may, now have, to our own country.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="035255_0003_1001CF86205FC7E0">REASONING from analogy, we &s;hall be per&s;uaded that war is inevitable. The two fir&s;t brothers made war; one &s;lew the other. Since then, individuals and nations, have conducted in the &s;ame manner; &s;o that the hi&s;tory of the world is but the narration of war&mdash;a &s;tory of bat|tle &mdash;&s;tratagem&mdash;blockade&mdash;capitulation&mdash;conque&s;t&mdash;and pillage. War has become an art. Its di&s;ciples are taught its precepts, and initiated into its my&s;teries; they become &s;oldiers by profe&s;&s;ion, and follow the trade of arms to purcha&s;e the means of daily &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. If, from the birth of time, till now, war has, very frequently happen|ed, will it not, in all probability, very frequently, happen again? We believe rivers will continue to roll towards the ocean, becau&s;e they have ever rolled that way; and that the dews, and the &s;howers of heaven, will always de|&s;cend. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, war is ju&s;t as inevitable.&mdash; If war be inevitable, it is al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ity of it may be illu&s;trated and further e|vinced, by a momentary view of our own nature and &s;itu|ation. Men have many relations, and the&s;e relations o|riginate many rights. The eye of rea&s;on is not, at all times, &s;ufficiently clear to perceive the line of &s;eparation between the rights of one man, and tho&s;e of another.&mdash; Mental vi&s;ion is often ob&s;cured, either by pa&s;&s;ion, or pre|judice, or malevolence. From one or other of the&s;e cau&s;es, aggre&s;&s;ions are con&s;tantly made. In a &s;ociety, when one individual violates the rights of another, the arm of law compels remuneration. Among nations, it cannot be &s;o. They have no common arbiter in who&s;e deci&s;ions they will acquie&s;ce; or who&s;e power can force from the aggre&s;&s;or a reparation of injury. The wronged nation mu&s;t tamely indure it, or el&s;e demand redre&s;s by war. So long, therefore, as nations, either by error, or by malevolence, will infract the laws of reciprocal right|eou&s;ne&s;s, &s;o long will war be inevitable, be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>A WAR of <HI>aggre&s;&s;ion</HI> has not that kind of nece&s;&s;ity which can render it ju&s;t. It is indeed a polluted &s;tream from the fountain of inju&s;tice. But if a war of <HI>defence</HI> be nece&s;&s;ary, from that nece&s;&s;ity, its ju&s;tice is demon&s;trated. If one part of mankind will make aggre&s;&s;ions on the other, why may not tho&s;e aggre&s;&s;ions be repelled by arms? If we may not make war, we may not re&s;i&s;t injury. If that
<PB N="5" REF="035255_0004_1001CF8EEFFEAAB8">
re&s;i&s;tance, which terminates in war, may not be made, no re&s;traint will be left on the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the profli|gate. Re&s;i&s;tance is the only mound, oppo&s;ed to that ocean of oppre&s;&s;ion, which, if this were broken down, mu&s;t ru&s;h in and deluge the moral world. If re&s;i&s;tance be not made, where will aggre&s;&s;ion terminate? "Inju&s;|tice mu&s;t &s;weep the wide earth, and trample down man|kind."</P>
<P>IF re&s;i&s;tance be unju&s;t, why do we &s;ympathize with the injured; or why do we feel the &s;ame re&s;entment at our own wrongs? God Almighty, the Omni&s;cient, the All Good, knew that the felicity of his creatures depended on free-will, and that with free-will, they mu&s;t be liable to tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. To oppo&s;e this liability, he gave us re&s;entment, that &s;pirit of divinity which &s;wells our hearts with indignation, &s;parkles in our eye, and nerves our arm again&s;t the wretch who dares abu&s;e the freedom be&s;towed upon us by our common Creator.</P>
<P>A CERTAIN equilibrium is the pre&s;ervation of all be|ing. In the material world this equilibrium is maintain|ed by repul&s;ion. By repul&s;ion each particle of matter drives back, and excludes from its own place, all its fel|low atoms. If repul&s;ion were de&s;troyed, one atom would be con&s;tantly ru&s;hing into the habitation of another, and I know not what cea&s;ele&s;s motations might fluctuate the univer&s;e. Re&s;entment is the repul&s;ion of the moral world. Take away re&s;entment, take away re&s;i&s;tance its offspring, and not only &s;ociety would be de&s;troyed, but even the human race it&s;elf would very nigh become ex|tingui&s;hed. Battle, it is true, would be excluded from the earth; but the good mu&s;t fall a prey to the wicked; and the world be transformed into one wide realm of unre|&s;i&s;ted rapine, pillage and ma&s;&s;acre.</P>
<P>IF a war of defence be unju&s;t, why have we a principle of &s;elf pre&s;ervation? Why do we love our country, our friends, our own being, if we are forbidden to rai&s;e our arm in their defence? Did God warm our hearts with the&s;e endearing attachments merely to encrea&s;e our wretchedne&s;s, and &s;harpen our agony at the de&s;truction of their objects? He did, unle&s;s he has commanded us to &s;pill our blood in their defence. What, mu&s;t I &s;ee my country laid wa&s;te, my parents butchered, and the &s;word
<PB N="6" REF="035255_0005_1001CF9D14188FD0">
reeking with the blood of my mother, plunged at my own naked bo&s;om, not lift a hand again&s;t the ruffian aggre&s;|&s;or? I mu&s;t, or a war of defence is a war of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>IF I may not re&s;i&s;t, he, who would take my life, may, ju&s;tly, take it. I may take it my&s;elf. For &s;urely I, or any other, may ju&s;tly de&s;troy what, neither I, nor any o|ther, without inju&s;tice can pre&s;erve. This doctrine of non-re&s;i&s;tance goes to the utter de&s;truction of all virtue. If we may not defend our friends, our country, our bro|ther-men, then friend&s;hip, and patrioti&s;m, and philan|thropy, and benevolence are vices. Nay more, vice is transformed to virtue, parricide becomes piety, the &s;tain of guilt is wa&s;hed from the forehead of murder, and &s;ui|cide it&s;elf canonized.</P>
<P>THERE was war in heaven, Michael and his angels fought again&s;t the &s;pirits of perdition. Je&s;us, the meek and immaculate friend of humanity, Je&s;us &s;aid, he who takes the weapons of <HI>aggre&s;&s;ion,</HI> &s;hall peri&s;h by them, but let him who has no &s;word of <HI>defence</HI> &s;ell his coat and buy one.</P>
<P>THE intention of a ju&s;t war is pre&s;ervation. This ever is the effect of it, if the arm of violence be not too power|ful for the arm of ju&s;tice. Tho millions have fallen in battle; tho thou&s;ands of hills have &s;moked with blood; and the flame of many a conflagrant city reddened on the dark bo&s;om of midnight; yet often are nations pre&s;erved by war alone. War has once been the &s;alvation of our country. It wre&s;ted us, not from the parental embrace of a mother &s;tate, but from the iron arms of tyranny; gave us independence, and in a manner prepared for us the fir&s;t nutriment by which we have grown to our pre|&s;ent athletic, national maturity. War demoli&s;hed the Roman Empire, that &s;tupendous fabrick of de&s;poti&s;m, built from the plunder, and trophied with the conque&s;ts, of a world. The Feudal Sy&s;tem, a complication of &s;ervitude and domination, more ba&s;e and ferocious, than any known to elder time has been, by the influence of repeat|ed wars, meliorated down to the mildne&s;s of modern Brit|i&s;h juri&s;prudence.</P>
<P>WAR has given the world its mo&s;t illu&s;trious charact|ers. It furni&s;hed Homer a theme for deathle&s;s ver&s;e; and opened to Achilles a field for immortal atchieve|ments.
<PB N="7" REF="035255_0006_1001CFA1D1E36FF0">
It rai&s;ed Green, my Fellow-Citizens, your be|loved Green, it rai&s;ed to the glory of the &s;econd in de|fence of his country. Had War never been, Wa&s;hing|ton had never been. The world had forever lo&s;t the mo|del, and the admiration of all &s;ucceeding time.</P>
<P>WAR gives men the ineffable delight of defending all that is dear to them. There are tho&s;e, whom to redeem from danger, we would die with extacy. I, this moment, behold men who have marched barefoot, many a winter midnight, and amid&s;t the &s;torm of many a battle, wi&s;hed no greater joy than to throw their naked bo&s;oms between their country and her foes. What then mu&s;t they have felt on that day, when glad millions rai&s;ed loud &s;houts of triumph to the God of armies, who extended his Al|mighty hand over the fields of Columbia, and frowned the tempe&s;t of battle from our hemi&s;phere? When they &s;aw their country &s;afe? When they beheld parental age, ex|tending the hands of benediction, while infancy &s;miled, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;cious of their kindne&s;s, and the eye of beauty beamed on them &s;uffu&s;ed with tears of gratitude?</P>
<P>IF, therefore, war be inevitable, if, urged by inju&s;tice, nations will violate our rights; if a war of defence be ju&s;t|ified by our own feelings the eternal principles of &s;elf pre|&s;ervation, the example of heaven, and the awful mandates of him who has all power in all worlds; if war &s;ave na|tions, demoli&s;h de&s;poti&s;m, throw open the portals of im|mortal renown, and be&s;tow the ineffable delight of defend|ing all that can endear the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of life; if it do all the&s;e things, let us bani&s;h all reluctance, and all temerity at the approach of battle; magnanimo&s;ly give our&s;elves up to the voice of our nature, and our God, regarding the tempe&s;t in which we may be engaged, as we do tho&s;e el|emental contentions, which, for a while, &s;eem to blot out the light and frown the univer&s;e into convul&s;ions; but, when their fury is exhau&s;ted, pa&s;s off, leaving a &s;un bright|ened with additional lu&s;tre, and young creation laughing with renovated loveline&s;s.</P>
<P>IF at any time, in any region of the earth, any nation might apply the&s;e principles to them&s;elves, this is the time, this is the country, we, my fellow-citizens, are that nation. The war between the United States and France is not merely nece&s;&s;ary, and ju&s;t, and beneficial;
<PB N="8" REF="035255_0007_1001CFAB36537498">
a war not only for our property, our independence and &s;overeignty; but for our manners, our morality, our re|ligion; for all we enjoy, for all we hope. French ra|pacity, ambition, and demoralization aim to encircle in their all devouring, all contaminating embrace, whate|ver of wealth, or liberty, or virtue, may be found under the whole heaven. The war, therefore, is a war of hu|manity, moderation, and decency, again&s;t cruelty, profli|gacy, and impunity; a war of all the virtues again&s;t all the vices; in a word, a war of the principle of all good again&s;t the principle of all evil. To the French not e|ven vice it&s;elf is plea&s;ant unle&s;s it be audacious and cru|el; unle&s;s it has in it &s;omething of perjured treachery, &s;ome violation of compact, or de&s;truction of ancient in|&s;titutions, or &s;ubver&s;ion of liberty and religion. Grown fa&s;tidious by a reiteration of common pillage, nothing can now &s;atiate their unhallowed rapacity but &s;poils plun|dered from the cabinets of the learned, and the altars of the Almighty.</P>
<P>AMERICANS, you will think on Flanders and Italy. You will not &s;uffer Gallick pollution to &s;tep over the thre&s;hold of your temples. You have parents and wives, and daughters, and the hallowed tombs of tho&s;e who &s;tood between your infant bo&s;oms and the point of Briti&s;h &s;teel. Round the&s;e you will form battalions, dark, terrible and re&s;i&s;tle&s;s, as the cloud of the North fraught with the &s;piky artillery of heaven. Let the &s;ons of Gaul beware. Let them &s;tep a ho&s;tile foot over the la&s;t wave of the Atlantic&mdash;not one &s;hall e&s;cape. Their bones &s;hall be left bleaching on our mountains; the &s;cattered frag|ments of their &s;hips &s;hall mingle with the &s;ea-weed that drifts upon our &s;hores. What though they gra&s;p at un|limited domination; what though they have nurtured to a gigantick &s;tature a &s;oul and fiend-like tyranny; who lifts his bloody forehead towards the &s;tars of heaven; who tramples Europe under his feet, lays hold of Africa and A&s;ia with one hand, and is reaching the other to|wards America; yet &s;hall the mon&s;ter &s;oon be pro&s;trated and the hallelujahs of triumph re-echo from Good-Hope to Nova Zembla, from Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi to the Ganges.</P>
