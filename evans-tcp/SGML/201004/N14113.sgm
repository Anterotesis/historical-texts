<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends and Fellow Citizens,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE proceedings of the late A&s;&s;embly held at Jack&s;onborough have already excited the attention not only of this, but of other States; and &s;ome of the laws then enacted are of &s;o &s;erious a nature, that the memory of them will la&s;t, and their con&s;equences operate, when the authors of the mea&s;ures &s;hall be no more. By one of tho&s;e laws, upwards of two hundred men who had been citizens of this State before the reduction of Charle&s;town, have been &s;tript of all their property: innocent wives and children involved in the calamity of hu&s;bands and fathers, their widows are deprived of the right of dower, their children di&s;inherited, and them&s;elves bani&s;hed for ever from this country. And this <HI>without proce&s;s, trial, examination,</HI> or <HI>hearing;</HI> and without allowing them the &s;acred right of proving their innocence on a future day. Under other acts of that a&s;&s;embly, a number of the inhabitants are &s;ubjected to heavy fines, &s;ome to near one third, others to one eight, and &s;ome to a tenth part of their e&s;tate, real and per&s;onal, without better proof of crime than report and &s;ugge&s;tions. Another act excludes from the freedom of voting or being elected to a &s;eat in the legi&s;lature, almo&s;t a majority of our citizens. The crimes of all con&s;i&s;t in the part which they were &s;aid to have taken after the reduction of South-Carolina by the Briti&s;h army.</P>
<P>One would imagine there is no free country upon earth, in which laws bringing &s;uch ruin on &s;o many families, and &s;o big with political mi&s;chief, would not have been publickly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed before this day. But whether it be owing, that the mea&s;ures have &s;uc|ceeded in breaking the &s;pirit of the people, by filling every man
<PB N="4" REF="017861_0004_0FA37412874D52E0">with a &s;en&s;e of his own danger; or that the fear of the Governor's <HI>extraordinary power,</HI> awes men into &s;ilence; or that they are indifferent about public affairs; not a man has yet undertaken to enquire into the ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice of it, or a&s;k his neighbour how far the Legi&s;lature could effect the ruin and di&s;grace of &s;o many of his fellow citizens, con&s;i&s;tently with the laws, con&s;titution, and happine&s;s of his country.</P>
<P>From every point of view in which I con&s;ider tho&s;e proceedings, I am convinced it is e&s;&s;ential to the future peace and liberty of our country, that a true judgment be formed on the matter. The people at large in whom the &s;overeignty of the State <HI>&s;hould be ve&s;ted,</HI> ought to be informed whether public mea&s;ures be right or wrong; and it therefore becomes the duty of every citizen to pre&s;ent the &s;ubject in as open and publick a light as opportunity or knowledge may enable him. Under this per&s;ua&s;ion I venture to offer a few remarks to the con&s;ideration of the publick; and I only wi&s;h my talents were equal to the importance of the &s;ubject. I tru&s;t the candid, plain manner in which I &s;hall di&s;cour&s;e on it will an&s;wer for me, that I have no other de&s;ign by it but what has been the object of my pur&s;uit through &s;even years public &s;ervice; that is, the liberty and peace of my courtry.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t fir&s;t ob&s;erve, that G&mdash;r R&mdash;'s proclamation of the 27th of September 1781, was the fountain from whence &s;prung &s;ome of tho&s;e bitter laws, and the forfeitures and di&s;abilities abovemention|ed. That proclamation went entirely on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the citizens of the State who had taken protection on the fall of the country under Briti&s;h u&s;urpation, had thereby not only forfeited their lives, fortunes, and the privileges of citizen&s;hip, but had al&s;o incurred the penalty of trea&s;on again&s;t the State. This was the doctrine allowed on all hands; not only laid down by the proclamation, but advanced in both hou&s;es, and I never heard it contradicted by the <HI>judges</HI> or <HI>lawyers</HI> who ought to have known better. The proclamation indeed was &s;uppo&s;ed to have re&s;tored all tho&s;e who complied with the terms of it, to their lo&s;t liberties, by joining the army within a limited time.</P>
<P>I &s;hall proceed to make &s;ome remarks on the &s;uppo&s;ed crime and delinquency of the people in taking protection.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>I. <HI>On the Citizens making a temporary Submi&s;&s;ion to the Briti&s;h Arms, after the reduction of Charle&s;town in</HI> 1780.</HEAD>
<P>THIS State, &s;oon after the reduction of Charle&s;town, may be &s;trictly &s;aid to have been conquered. Not only the capital, but every po&s;t throughout the country was in the hands of the enemy. The Governor who repre&s;ented the Sovereignty of the State, had provided for his &s;afety by flight, and all the Conti|nental troops in South-Carolina were either killed, taken, or routed.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="017861_0005_0FA3741346D06280">
The enemy, thus ma&s;ters of the country, re&s;olved to reduce by military force the inhabitants to obedience. And Sir Henry Clinton accordingly in the month of June 1781, i&s;&s;ues a proclama|tion,
<Q>Commanding all per&s;ons whatever inhabitants of this province, (tho&s;e who were in Charle&s;town and Fort Moultrie at the time of their capitulations and &s;urrender, or were then in actual confinement excepted) who &s;hall after the 20th of June next, neglect to return to his allegiance and to his Maje&s;ty's government, will be con&s;idered as enemies and rebels to the &s;ame, and treated accordingly.</Q></P>
<P>Thus a military de&s;poti&s;m was e&s;tabli&s;hed throughout the &s;ettlements, and to compleat this mi&s;erable &s;cene of woes, the army under General Gates, and a divi&s;ion under General Sumpter, to whom we looked up as our deliverers, were entirely defeated. The country thus abandoned to a cruel, unprincipled foe, the people had no idea but that our independence was lo&s;t irrecoverably. And indeed the advantages gained by the enemy were &s;o rapid and deci&s;ive, it was for &s;ome time apprehended thro' the other States, and even by many members of Congre&s;s, that Carolina and Georgia mu&s;t in the end revert to the domination of Great Britain.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> who&s;e dominion triumphs over all hu|man laws pointed out to our inhabitants, that as there was neither government, laws, nor army to protect them, they were at liberty to protect them&s;elves, as well as they could. This is the law of Nature and of Nations: And all State&s;men, the be&s;t lawyers, and mo&s;t eminent writers, agree, that when an invader over-runs a country, defeats the &s;tanding forces, and &s;ubverts its government, the inhabitants of &s;uch a country are ju&s;tifiable to take the conqueror's protection and obey his laws; and whether the government be a monarchy or republick, it makes no difference, as the rea&s;on of the thing is the &s;ame.</P>
<P>In Germany and other parts of Europe, it is not uncommon for one and the &s;ame city to be taken and retaken and have different ma&s;ters in one campaign. And the inhabitants of &s;uch a city, magi&s;trates and all, who are not &s;oldiers by profe&s;&s;ion, uniformly take an oath of allegiance to the &s;tronger &s;ide, which oath is binding only &s;o long as the conqueror's power la&s;ts. And I believe we have the exclu&s;ive honour of being the fir&s;t who proceeded to puni&s;h their inhabitants on account of &s;uch &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. I &s;hall bring forward the authority of the be&s;t writers on the laws of nations and nature to prove that taking protection from a conqueror is no crime.</P>
<P><Q>Things may be brought to &s;uch an i&s;&s;ue, &s;ays Puffendorf, lib. 7 c. 8. as &s;hall make it not only allowable, but good and nece&s;&s;ary to obey the ruler in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by what&s;oever means po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was gained. As if the lawful Sovereign be reduced to &s;uch &s;traits, that one can no longer exerci&s;e his regal office to|wards his people. For tho' the commands of the u&s;urper, being de&s;titute of legal power are not in them&s;elves obligatory, yet it
<PB N="6" REF="017861_0006_0FA3741406DE9F08">becomes a wi&s;e man to con&s;ult the welfare of him&s;elf and of his affairs, make provi&s;ion again&s;t the future, and with warine&s;s and caution reflect on his pre&s;ent condition, that he may not thru&s;t his life and fortune into danger; as he would do, &s;hould he by vain ob&s;tinacy and oppo&s;ition draw the u&s;urper's rage upon his own head, without procuring the lea&s;t advantage to his country.</Q> And further on he concludes,
<Q>That when the prince cannot afford his &s;ubjects due protection, nor they on the other hand able to re&s;i&s;t the u&s;urper without imminent ruin, they are relea&s;ed from all obligations to him, until providence &s;hall open a way to his re&s;toration.</Q> Again,
<Q>This method mu&s;t be allowed to be lawful not only for particular &s;ubjects, but al&s;o for entire cities and provinces, when they find no other way left for their &s;afety and pre&s;ervation.</Q> Lib. 8. c. 11. In &s;upport of this right he quotes the ca&s;e of the Petilini from Livy. This nation being in alliance with the Romans, and pre&s;&s;ed by their enemies, &s;ent for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But the Romans being di&s;tre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, an&s;wered,
<Q>They confe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves no longer in a condition to defend their di&s;tant friends, and therefore de&s;ired the petitioners to return home, con&s;ult for them&s;elves, and make the be&s;t terms they could.</Q></P>
<P>This is the law laid down by Grotius as well as Puffendorf: and Vattel, a late writer of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction, delivers the like doctrine in the following words:</P>
<P><Q>If a State is overcome by force, <HI>nece&s;&s;ity, that irre&s;i&s;table law,</HI> frees it from its fir&s;t engagement, and gives it a right to treat with the conqueror, in order to obtain the be&s;t conditions po&s;&s;i|ble. If it mu&s;t &s;ubmit to him, or peri&s;h, who can entertain a doubt but that it may, and even ought to chu&s;e the fir&s;t expe|dient, <HI>&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion?</HI> The modern u&s;age is agreeable to this deci|&s;ion: A city &s;ubmits to an enemy when it cannot expect &s;afety from a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance: it takes an oath of fidelity to him, and the Sovereign of &s;uch city has no body to accu&s;e but for|tune.</Q></P>
<P>Vattel gives as examples the ca&s;es of the country of Zug, and the city of Zurich abandoned by their Confederates in the 14th century, who entered into a treaty with their enemies from nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>This part of my &s;ubject I &s;hall conclude with a quotation from Mr. Heboes, a writer who&s;e authority is the more to be depended on, as be lived in England in the time of the grand rebellion, when England then was, as Carolina was lately, di&s;tracted by a fierce war, and were per&s;ecuting each other, as the parlia|ment forces, or tho&s;e of the king got the better.</P>
<P><Q>Becau&s;e I find, &s;ays Hobbes, by our Engli&s;h books lately printed, that the civil wars have not &s;ufficiently taught men in which point of time it is that a &s;ubject becomes obliged to the conqueror, nor how it comes about that men are obliged to obey his laws. Therefore, for &s;atisfaction of men therein, I &s;ay, That for him who has no obligation to his former &s;overeign, but
<PB N="7" REF="017861_0007_0FA37414C95B08E8">that of an ordinary &s;ubject, <HI>(that is not a &s;oldier by profe&s;&s;ion)</HI> it is then when the means of life are within the guards and garri|&s;ons of the enemy: for it is then he hath no longer protection from his &s;overeign, but is protected by the adver&s;e party for his contribution. Seeing therefore &s;uch a contribution is every where e&s;teemed lawful, as a thing inevitable, (notwith&s;tanding it be an a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the enemy) a total &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion cannot be e&s;teemed unlawful. Be&s;ides, if we con&s;ider that he who &s;ubmits a&s;&s;i&s;ts the enemy but with part of his e&s;tate, whereas, they that refu&s;e to &s;ubmit, a&s;&s;i&s;t him with the whole.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Again, when in a war (foreign or dome&s;tic) the enemy get a final victory, &s;o as the forces of the Commonwealth keeping the field no longer, there is no farther protection of the citizens in their loyalty: <HI>Then is the Common wealth di&s;&s;olved, and every man at liberty to protect him&s;elf by &s;uch cour&s;es as his own direction &s;hall &s;ugge&s;t to him.</HI> For the Sovereign is the public &s;oul, giving life and motion to the Commonwealth; which expiring, the mem|bers are no more governed by it than the carca&s;e of a man by his departed &s;pirit. For tho' the right of a &s;overeign cannot be extingui&s;hed, yet the obligation of the members may; for he that wants protection may &s;eek it any where.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Again, the obligation of &s;ubjects to the State is under&s;tood to la&s;t &s;o long, and no longer than the power la&s;ts by which it is able to protect them. For the right which men have by nature to protect them&s;elves, when none el&s;e can protect them, can by no covenant be relinqui&s;hed. The &s;overeignty is the &s;oul of the commonwealth, which once departed from the body, the members do no more receive their motion from it. The end of obedience is protection, which where&s;oever a man &s;eeketh, either in his own, or his enemy's &s;word, nature applieth his obedience to it.</Q> Hobbes's Leviathan, cap. 21.27.29. and the Review.</P>
<P>Nothing can be clearer than this doctrine; and however &s;hocking it will &s;eem to tho&s;e who have kept a perpetual boa&s;ting of their own virtue and clamour again&s;t &s;uch as the Briti&s;h did not think fit to &s;end to St. Augu&s;tine; yet this is what is good law in South-Carolina as well as all the world over: All tho&s;e writers who&s;e autho|rity we rely on in law-matters laying it down for law, that &s;ubjects are excu&s;ed and ju&s;tified, and not liable to be impleaded or called to account for taking protection from a conqueror or u&s;urper.</P>
<P>I hope I have &s;aid enough to &s;atisfy the reader, that our in|habitants did nothing more than their duty in taking protection: and if they thought they could &s;ecure better treatment, or alleviate their calamity by congratulations, they had an undoubted right to do it. It did not &s;hew much political wi&s;dom, I allow; but let that matter be as it will, they did not commit any crime again&s;t the laws or government, for neither law nor government exi&s;ted. The Sovereign power was in a &s;tate of temporary death, the &s;oul was fled and departed, and nothing remained but the carca&s;e; which could no more be injured or violated by any of our former
<PB N="8" REF="017861_0008_0FA3741585FBB148">citizens taking protection, or &s;igning a congratulation, than they could be &s;aid to commit murder by trampling on the body of a man who had been dead and buried many months.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to pre&s;enting congratulations, it were ea&s;y to prove from what happened in other countries that they are by no means a true te&s;t or proof of the public &s;entiments, or of tho&s;e who pre&s;ent them. Such addre&s;&s;es are obtained in all countries by a few de&s;igning men, and the re&s;t by threats, terror, or a &s;ort of impul&s;e, follow the example. For a long time before Cromwell died he was dete&s;ted by the Engli&s;h nation, and &s;carcely an hone&s;t man in it who did not wi&s;h to have him di&s;patched.</P>
<P>Yet after his death, and the nomination of his &s;on Richard to the protector&s;hip, which was looked on as a tyranny.
<Q>The city of London and almo&s;t all the countries and cities in England &s;ent him addre&s;&s;es of condolance for the lo&s;s of his father, and con|gratulations on his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the protector&s;hip. So little, &s;ays Burnet, do the&s;e appearances &s;ignify.</Q> This levity, this infirmity of the multitude, no &s;tate&s;man before our time thought in earne&s;t of puni&s;hing. Our laws cannot do it. Lord Cornwallis him&s;elf, tho' not a man of abilities, yet has &s;en&s;e enough to know that if he and Clinton were in Charle&s;town going to be hanged, the people would rejoice and &s;ign congratulations as they did on a different occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I well know prudent men, or rather &s;uch as think them&s;elves &s;o, will &s;ay, that this doctrine of <HI>Protection</HI> ought not to be drawn into di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, but &s;hould &s;leep in &s;ilence for the pre&s;ent. But is not the contrary doctrine believed to be law? Have not be few proclaimed to the world, and &s;till continue to proclaim it, that the protection|men forfeited their lives and fortunes? Has not the government been &s;eized, and its con&s;titution &s;ubverted, by the <HI>few</HI> in con&s;equence of that doctrine? Has it not &s;et one part of the community again&s;t the other, brought ruin on many, and di&s;honour on us all? I &s;hould hold my&s;elf guilty of the mo&s;t po&s;illammous &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, were I under this conviction and to be &s;ilent on it.</P>
<P>For men in power to per&s;uade the people, that they committed crimes and acted di&s;honourably, when there is neither crime nor di&s;honour in the ca&s;e, is a mo&s;t mi&s;chievous policy. It has the &s;ame pernicious effects on the multitude, that private &s;candal and defamation, has on an innocent individual. It breaks that &s;pirit, and generous pride, which is the be&s;t guardian of publick liberty and private honour. It overwhelms the publick as well as the private mind, with con&s;cious inferiority; degrades men in their own opinion, and tenders them fit tools for the ambitious de&s;igns, and arbitrary di&s;po&s;itions of haughty a&s;piring &s;uperiors.</P>
<P>Whether I am right, let tho&s;e judge who have carefully ob&s;erved the deportment and behaviour of &s;uch of our unhappy citizens as are held under cen&s;ure, for taking protection, by tho&s;e in authori|ty. The citizens who came from Charle&s;town in the &s;corching hearts of Augu&s;t la&s;t, by a proclamation, afforded a melancholy
<PB N="9" REF="017861_0009_0FA374164725B640">proof, how &s;oon oppre&s;&s;ion degrades mankind, and impre&s;&s;es timid, cringing habits, even on the minds of freemen.</P>
<P>Having proved the taking protection was no crime in the people, I &s;hall go on to &s;hew, that on the re&s;toration of the republic and laws from Briti&s;h thraldom, the protection-men who had been our citizens before, were as fully entitled to all the rights and freedom of citizen&s;hip, as tho&s;e who were detained pri&s;oners of war, or took refuge to the northward.</P>
<P>Every country of which we have any account from hi&s;tory, has had its day of woe and affliction, by foreign inva&s;ion, or civil di&s;cord, as we have had. But in every one of them as &s;oon as the troubles were over, and the country regained; the government returned to its antient form, and the &s;ubjects were rein&s;tated in the participation of their rights and privileges. And this is not only agreeable to ju&s;tice, but the freedom and liberty of the country would be de&s;troyed if it were otherwi&s;e. If in a republic a <HI>few</HI> could &s;et up preten&s;ions to &s;uperior political merit, over the whole aggregate body of the people, and deprive the latter of their rights and privileges, this would be nothing more nor le&s;s than overthrow|ing the con&s;titution, &s;eizing on the liberties of the people, and &s;etting up an arbitrary government of the <HI>few</HI> The laws of nations as well as the rights of nature therefore dictate, that when a country oppre&s;&s;ed by a foreign power regains its liberty, the citizens &s;hould be re&s;tored to all the rights and liberties they before enjoyed.</P>
<P><Q>A whole nation, &s;ays Puffendorf, cap. 6, when it hath, either by its own &s;trength, or the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of friends or allies, &s;haken off an enemy's yoke, recovers its liberty and antient &s;tate. And if a part of the people be recovered by the people, from which they were for &s;ome time divided or torn, or by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of allies, they again incorporate with the old body, and return to the place and rights they had before.</Q></P>
<P>This authority goes to the point; but in order to make it plainer, I &s;hall put a ca&s;e: I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e a nation governed by a limited monarch, invaded by a powerful enemy, and after trying the for|tune of war, entirely vanqui&s;hed. The Prince e&s;capes into another State, and the &s;ubjects are obliged to receive &s;uch terms as the conqueror chu&s;es to grant. In ca&s;e this country be again recovered by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of friends or allies, would it not be &s;trange indeed, that the prince on returning, &s;hould call the conque&s;t over his people, and their nece&s;&s;ity to &s;ubmit, by the name of trea&s;on again&s;t the government? Should he carry this notion &s;o far as to exclude the &s;ubjects from the benefit of the antient laws, and deny to all the rights of citizen&s;hip, except to his friends or adherents, and &s;uch who&s;e captivity prevented them from following the example of the re&s;t, or who&s;e re&s;idence on the frontier afforded an ea&s;y removal into another country; would not this procedure be con&s;idered as &s;eizing the government and &s;etting up his own will to reign in&s;tead of laws?

<HEAD>II. <HI>On Governor Rutledge's Proclamation of the</HI> 27th <HI>of September,</HI> 1781.</HEAD>
<P>A Mea&s;ure &s;o &s;ingular as this is mu&s;t be produced by &s;ome uncommon motive. It is, however, one of tho&s;e things, which the more a man will think of, the more will he dete&s;t it. For it is calculated for no other end but to &s;ow the poi&s;onous &s;eeds of faction and party, to di&s;grace the middling and lower cla&s;s of our citizens, and throw the whole weight and powers of govern|ment out of the people into a few families. G&mdash;r R&mdash;'s proclamation, and the plans which he carried la&s;t a&s;&s;embly, would, unle&s;s unrivetted by a future one, fa&s;ten at one blow in this country, a fierce and jealous ari&s;tocracy, which has been gaining ground for &s;even years pa&s;t. Mi&s;erable is that republic who&s;e citizens want di&s;cernment to penetrate through &s;uch de&s;igns, or are afraid to expo&s;e them!</P>
<P>For &s;ome time before the battle of the Eutaw Springs, almo&s;t all our citizens without the lines of Charle&s;town, and with few ex|ceptions, all within, worried by the tyranny of the Briti&s;h army, held them and their cau&s;e in the utmo&s;t dete&s;tation. The victory obtained in that action proved a death-warrant to the tory intere&s;t in this State; and the capture of the Briti&s;h army under Lord Corn|wallis following on the heels of the event, rou&s;ed the few tories there were as from a dream; and they &s;aw clearly they had hitherto only deluded them&s;elves in thinking this country would be con|quered. And tho&s;e who from zeal, levity, or nece&s;&s;ity, adhered to the enemy after the fall of Charle&s;town, employed all the means in their power to pave the way to a reconciliation. This was not difficult for tho&s;e who had not per&s;onal enemies among us; for General Greene wanted &s;upplies, the town abounded with merch|andize,
<PB N="11" REF="017861_0011_0FA37417C809E838">of which our old citizens found means to &s;end out large quantities. The very adventurers who followed the Briti&s;h army to South-Carolina became our friends, and te&s;tified their zeal for us on many occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>This I believe was the true &s;tate of parties the latter end of the year 1781. Happy would it have been for this country if the &s;er|vants of the public could have di&s;entangled their minds from the re&s;entments and party-rage which prevail in civil wars! A procla|mation then framed upon principles of wi&s;dom and humanity, would have had a happy tendency to bury in oblivion what was pa&s;t; to extingui&s;h from the minds of men, a &s;en&s;e of late injuries; to unite the affections of all; and re&s;tore the country to order and tranquillity.</P>
<P>The proclamation of September 27th, as I ob&s;erved before, went on the Governor's idea that the great body of the people who had taken protection had thereby forfeited their lives, liberty, and property. He takes upon him to offer pardon to every one of them who &s;hould join our &s;tandard in 30 days, and &s;erve 6 months in the militia, as common &s;oldiers; excepting from this benefit, tho&s;e who were bani&s;hed the State in the beginning of the troubles; the congratulators, and &s;uch as held commi&s;&s;ions civil or military on the 27th of September, or were then with the enemy. I &s;hall &s;ay no|thing of the good or bad policy of excluding &s;uch a number of ci|tizens as this exception comprehended, admitting he had the power he pretended to&punc; However on the 17th of November he i&s;&s;ued a &s;econd proclamation, extending the benefits held out by the former under the like terms.</P>
<P>As the capture of Cornwallis and his army was known to the Governor when this proclamation came out; as the Briti&s;h troops had ab&s;olutely lo&s;t their courage with their lo&s;s at Eutaw, and the Penn&s;ylvania Line was on the march from York-Town to our a&s;|&s;i&s;tance: When this, and the &s;tate the country was in at that junc|ture, is con&s;idered; I leave the reader to judge, whether the pro|clamation was not calculated rather for creating mi&s;chief than for rai&s;ing a force. For it laid all who neglected or refu&s;ed, not only under a &s;tigma and reproach, but under &s;uch di&s;abilities as degrad|ed them below the rank of freemen.</P>
<P>Obliging the whole country that had taken protection to turn out and &s;erve &s;ix months in the militia, was the greate&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion imaginable; and the contriver of it well knew, as tho&s;e do, who now drive down the mea&s;ure, that it was commanding what was ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible. Men are generally &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed with in|conveniences of one &s;ort or another, that there is no &s;ociety on earth, the aggregate body whereof could all quit their families and homes for &s;ix months. In our ca&s;e, not to mention how much agriculture would &s;uffer by &s;uch emigration, the heads of tho&s;e families who re&s;ided within the enemy's range, were peculiarly cir|cum&s;tanced. They were no doubt called on by the feelings of
<PB N="12" REF="017861_0012_0FA3741886C46430">fathers, hu&s;bands, or protectors to &s;tay and afford the feeble pro|tection they could to their families, or avert the di&s;tre&s;s or ruin that would en&s;ue; if they joined our army, which at that time had not the power of protecting them.</P>
<P>Ordering them out, therefore, without regard to local &s;ituation, &s;ickne&s;s, or other di&s;tre&s;s, was an extravagant act of power. Whether they re&s;ided within or out of the enemy's garri&s;on or guards; whether a man's wife or little ones, or the property the Briti&s;h had left him unplundered, were in or out of the enemy's reach: All this was nothing; they mu&s;t abandon the whole to the rage of an unprincipled, revengeful enemy; and &s;ally forth, like Don Quixote, &s;etting Briti&s;h guards and parties at defiance, in que&s;t of adventures on the report of a proclamation; and what per|haps was more mortifying; they mu&s;t humble them&s;elves and &s;up|plicate for mercy as criminals, at the feet of a man who a little be|fore was a fellow citizen, no more than on a fooling with them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>I conjure any &s;en&s;ible hone&s;t man to tell me, if this was acting the part of a magi&s;trate, framing regulations for the ea&s;e and con|venience of a people, over who&s;e happine&s;s he was appointed to pre&s;ide? In the high &s;tation he was, ought he not to have looked on the people at large as children of the republic; who&s;e only crime was a misfortune that admitted of no alternative? In&s;tead of ad|ding to the li&s;t of their calamities, from Briti&s;h oppre&s;&s;ion, ought he not to have comforted them, and rather to palliate, or cover over any &s;tain of di&s;honour, if any there was, than lay them under the condemnation of treachery to their country? this proclamation was like putting the citizens in a Bear-&s;kin, and then worrying them; or according to a more ju&s;t compari&s;on made by General Gad&s;den on the Confi&s;cation Bill; he &s;aid it was like an <HI>Auto de fe,</HI> a &s;ort of proceeding u&s;ed in Portugal again&s;t Heretics, where they are dre&s;&s;ed in frocks painted over with figures of fiends and devils, to excite a horror in the multitude again&s;t them.</P>

<HEAD>III. <HI>On the Mode of conducting the Election for the A&s;&s;embly at Jack&s;onborough.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Shall proceed to examine the mode of conducting the elections in the latter end of 1781, for the A&s;&s;embly at Jack&s;onborough; as I think it of con&s;equence that the public &s;hould be acquainted with the nature of it. The Governor re&s;olved to convene the A&s;|&s;embly in January; and whether the mea&s;ure of calling them at all, at that time, will turn out a ble&s;&s;ing or a cur&s;e to us, time will di&s;cover. The writs of election were accompanied with <HI>printed in&s;tructions</HI> to the returning officers, not to admit any per&s;on to vote, but &s;uch as obeyed his extraordinary proclamation. The returning officers had al&s;o further orders from the Governor to chu&s;e particu|lar men whom he named, and according to &s;uch nomination they were cho&s;en.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="017861_0013_0FA3741945C36B08">
Our Con&s;titution or Charter or Liberties a&s;certains the qualifica|tion of voters, and &s;ecures this valuable priviledge by the following clau&s;e:</P>
<P><Q>Every free white man who has attained to the age of 21 years, and hath been a re&s;ident and an inhabitant in this State for the &s;pace of one whole year, and hath freehold of fifty acres of land, or a town lot, and been &s;eized of it &s;ix months previous to the election, or paid a tax, or was taxable &s;ix months previous to the election in a &s;um equal to the tax on fifty acres of land, &s;hall be deemed qualified to vote for, and be eligible, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Thus the Con&s;titution gives to every &s;uch citizen a <HI>participation in the Sovereignty of the State,</HI> which right and &s;hare neither Governor nor both Hou&s;es can take away without e&s;tabli&s;hing a tyrannical government on the ruins of our Liberties. And at any rate the A&s;&s;embly could not alter the Con&s;titution nor any part of it without ninety days notice by the&mdash;&s;ection. For the Governer therefore to a&s;&s;ume authority to deprive &s;ome citizens of this right and give it to others, is a flagrant in&s;tance of tyranny, and is &s;carcely to be equalled in any country that pretended to freedom. The priviledge of voting for tho&s;e who are to make laws for us, is a right &s;o inherent in every citizen of our State, that the Governor or Legi&s;lature, who pretends under any condition or limitation to deprive him of it, and then return it as a matter of favour, actually plays the tyrant by &s;o doing: It is <HI>at once ve&s;ting the government in a few independant of the whole: An overt-act</HI> to change the nature and form of our Con&s;titution: Not an injury to one or a few individuals, but I aver it to be what in every Republican Govern|ment is called <HI>crimen lae&s;ae libertatis, high trea&s;on again&s;t the &s;overeignty and liberties of the people.</HI></P>
<P><Q>It is e&s;&s;ential to the being of a parliament, &s;ays Black&s;tone, that elections &s;hould be ab&s;olutely free. Therefore all undue influence on the electors is illegal and &s;trongly prohibited; Mr. Locke ranks it among tho&s;e breaches of tru&s;t in the <HI>executive magi&s;trate,</HI> which according to his notion amount to a di&s;&s;olution of the government if he employs the force, the trea&s;ure and offices of &s;ociety to corrupt the Repre&s;entatives, or <HI>openly to pre-engage the electors,</HI> and <HI>pre&s;cribe what manner of per&s;ons &s;hall be cho&s;en.</HI> For thus to regulate candidates and electors and <HI>new model the ways of election;</HI> what is it, &s;ays he, but to cut up the government by the roots, and poi&s;on the very fountain of public &s;ecurity.</Q> Black&s;t. vol. 1. p. 178.</P>
<P>The right of electing tho&s;e who act as public tru&s;tees in the legi&s;lature is by our con&s;titution &s;o ve&s;ted in the citizen, &s;o per&s;onal to him, that he cannot &s;urrender or re&s;ign it, any more than the &s;ub&s;tance of his body can part with its &s;hadow; nor can it be forfeited until he be convicted of &s;ome notorious crime, on a fair trial by his peers. <HI>It is indefea&s;ible and hereditary,</HI> and the Go|vernor with all the authority which an act of A&s;&s;embly could give him, was only an agent or tru&s;tee, who could no more aboli&s;h
<PB N="14" REF="017861_0014_0FA3741A06D76760">this right of the principal or people who appointed him, than a man who is only attorney or manager of an e&s;tate, can de&s;troy or alienate the right of his employer. The manager exerci&s;ing an act of owner&s;hip, &s;uch as &s;elling or converting it to his own emolument, makes void his commi&s;&s;ion. The power of the tru&s;t returns to the owner, and the other is re&s;pon&s;ible for his breach of it. So the Governor &s;eizing on the freedom of election, which alone con&s;ti|tutes the freedom of the people, was de&s;troying all legal authority in him&s;elf. Such an act of power was a <HI>felo de &s;e;</HI> a murderer of it&s;elf. It was no longer the act of the law, but of the u&s;urper; and <HI>packing an A&s;&s;embly</HI> in which he confirmed all his doings, was making the matter ten times wor&s;e; it was employing the <HI>forms</HI> of parliament, of law and con&s;titution to rivet his u&s;urpation.</P>
<P>As to the Governor's extraordinary powers in the rece&s;s of the A&s;&s;embly, <Q>to do and execute whatever he thought nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety of the State.</Q> On due con&s;ideration of this clau&s;e, I believe no lawyer will be &s;o hardy as to deny, that this power only authori&s;ed him to &s;upport, not to overturn the charter of our liber|ties and fundamental laws of the State, and by this precedent ex|po&s;e us in future to all the mi&s;chiefs of arbitrary power.</P>
<P>Encroachments on public liberty commence in all republics with plau&s;ible pretences of promoting &s;ome public good, or remedying &s;ome evil. In any government where there is the lea&s;t &s;park of freedom, <HI>open</HI> and <HI>barefaced tyranny</HI> can never in&s;inuate it&s;elf. It is obliged therefore like the original tempter in Paradi&s;e, to a&s;&s;ume a &s;hape which may conceal its &s;ubtilty, and the &s;tory of every na|tion affords examples of this truth. In the in&s;tance before me, the pretence was "a nece&s;&s;ity for excluding from votes the di&s;affected or protection-men, to prevent a tory influence in the Legi&s;lature." I look upon this to be a &s;hallow pretence: It al&s;o amounts to a calumny on the great body of the people, who hated the Briti&s;h government as much, and loved <HI>Republican equality</HI> much better than &s;ome people I could name <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have been told that certain gentlemen frequently make it their bu&s;ine&s;s in company, to propagate a notion, that the people of this State are not capable to govern them&s;elves, and that the con&s;titution &s;hould be changed into an ari&s;tocracy, or the government of certain potent families. Does not this let the Cat out of the bag, and account for &s;ome late proceedings?</NOTE>. The political &s;entiments of the public were &s;uch, and the hatred to the Briti&s;h &s;o univer&s;al, that had a free, impartial election prevailed, there would have been, not only no danger, but the &s;ettlement of the government, and peace of the country, would in all probability have been con&s;ulted much better than it was. I believe as much as I exi&s;t, that it was a great and public misfortune, that the Governor returned to the country, or that Major Hyrne, whom I regard by the by, as a man of great merit, exchanged the Charle&s;town militia. Had they remained where they were, <HI>a convention of the people</HI> would have been
<PB N="15" REF="017861_0015_0FA3741AC74E1E00">held as &s;oon as things were ripe for it: Elections would have been made agreeable to the con&s;titution; &s;omething like temperance and ju&s;tice might have prevailed; and the State at this time might have been in freedom and &s;erenity; in&s;tead of the arbitrary mea|&s;ures, the &s;pirit of faction, and di&s;content, ruin and mi&s;ery of families, which like a di&s;mal gloomy mi&s;t hangs over the land at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>At any rate we could not have been wor&s;ted, for anarchy or no Government is far preferable to an arbitrary one. How different the policy adopted in New-Jer&s;ey, and other parts of America, where the enemy for a while domineered, and the people uniformly took a temporary protection! Not one of them affords an example of a public &s;ervant fixing on the tyranny exerci&s;ed by the enemy over his countrymen, as a ma&s;k or pretence for accu&s;ing them of di&s;affection, and taking the government out of their hands. Not one of them trampled, as we have done, on <HI>the charter of their li|berties or con&s;titution,</HI> under colour of guarding again&s;t tory influence.</P>
<P>This influence the State of Jer&s;ey apprehended a few months ago; but what did they do? Not to open a theatre for the citizens to worry and per&s;ecute each other, under di&s;tinctions of the <HI>virtuous few,</HI> and <HI>protection-men;</HI> they only pa&s;&s;ed an act &s;ub&s;tituting the mode of giving in their votes at the elections, openly and publicly, in&s;tead of balloting as formerly.</P>
<P>How the legi&s;lature could make this proclamation of the Govern|or the ground-work of all their proceedings, cannot be accounted for, but by con&s;idering that &s;uch was his influence, and the man|agement of his party, that it became dangerous to make any oppo|&s;ition. The great majority of the A&s;&s;embly were men who had taken protection; but who from local &s;ituation were enabled to join the army, or find a &s;ub&s;titute.</P>
<P>What a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion of horror of the Governor's arbitrary power mu&s;t tho&s;e members have upon them, when they gave their votes for degrading their fellow-citizens from the rights of freemen, only for doing what they did them&s;elves, making a temporary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to a conqueror! Some gratified the workings of revenge, and others &s;ome other paltry pa&s;&s;ion. But they were all mere tools to carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s of u&s;urpation on the freedom of their country, and rai&s;e a few families to a height of power as would one day cru&s;h them and their po&s;terity.</P>

<HEAD>IV. <HI>On the Exclu&s;ion Act, which cuts of the Citizens from the Rights of Election.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>The following words of the preamble of the Exclu&s;ion Act are worth quoting:</HI></P>
<P><Q>AND WHEREAS it is incon&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice and poli|cy that any of the per&s;ons who are excluded by the Go|vernor's
<PB N="16" REF="017861_0016_0FA3741B86A395C0">proclamation from pardon &s;hould be admitted to vote for, or be eligible as members of the Legi&s;lature; be it enacted, that no per&s;on by the &s;aid proclamation excepted, &s;hall be en|titled to vote for, or be eligible as members of either branch of the Legi&s;lature.</Q></P>
<P>This Act of A&s;&s;embly &s;uppo&s;es with the Governor, that all who did not come in whithin the time &s;pecified by the proclamation, and &s;erve &s;ix months, had forfeited their liberty, and that &s;uch as obeyed, were re&s;tored to lo&s;t freedom. But the gentlemen of both Hou&s;es forgot, that the citizens of South-Carolina had to thank the Governor for nothing: Their rights and liberties were founded on &s;omething el&s;e be&s;ides parchment, or paper, or a proclamation; they were built on the laws of nature, and the fundamental laws of the State, and they were &s;upported by the valour, and cemented by the blood of tho&s;e brave men who fought, bled, and died in the cau&s;e of freedom, not for the u&s;urpation of a few, but for the liberties and happine&s;s of all. And yet this wretched country at this very hour, when peace and happine&s;s &s;hould prevail, is &s;plit into a faction of two cla&s;&s;es of men; the one &s;ort, a &s;et of mongrel freemen, begot between G&mdash;R&mdash;and a proclamation, or his party in the A&s;&s;embly; or holding the privilege of voting becau&s;e they could advance fifty or &s;ixty guineas to procure a &s;ub&s;titute. The re&s;t are aliens in the government, dive&s;ted of every privilege we have been contending for the&s;e &s;even years pa&s;t, and to be <HI>ruled</HI> and <HI>taxed without their con&s;ent.</HI> Even the unfortunate citizens of Charle&s;town, who tho' they were not <HI>&s;ix months-men</HI> under G&mdash; R&mdash;'s proclamation, yet were actually <HI>&s;ix years-men</HI> like common &s;oldiers, before the reduction of the town. Their zeal for the cau&s;e, and courage in &s;upporting it, was often proved on dangerous and honourable trials: They were all taken in defending it; and the great bulk of them bore hunger, in&s;ults and per&s;ecution before they would &s;ubmit even to a conqueror; yet are their &s;ervices not only forgotten, but they have been abu&s;ed and worried as if they were convicts, and are now little better than va&s;&s;als in their own city, except a few of the richer &s;ort, who could buy the freedom of voting; which it &s;eems before this la&s;t general election was let to &s;ale as it were with an OYEZ. Gold, it appears, with all their pretended fears of tory influence can work a miracle, by making a man a whig, and buy a right of voting or being elected. Is not this like the coming of the day of judgment to our freedom? when the right of election, to keep which cha&s;te and un&s;potted, we went to war with Great Britain, is now, like a public &s;trumpet, to be embraced only by him who can pull out his guineas, and advance a mercenary reward?</P>
<P>I have now done with the proclamation and election bu&s;ine&s;s; and here I mu&s;t declare, that I can lay my hand on my heart, and &s;ay, that I entertain no per&s;onal di&s;like or prejudice to J&mdash; R&mdash;. It is not the man I cen&s;ure but the mea&s;ure. Probably any other citizen with the power of doing what he plea&s;ed, would
<PB N="17" REF="017861_0017_0FA3741C45CDB3D8">have acted no better; for &s;upreme authority is &s;o intoxicating to human nature, that even the good are mi&s;led by it. The aggran|di&s;ement of his family, and perpetuating power in it; or being at the head of an <HI>ari&s;tocracy,</HI> is of far greater con&s;equence to an able, ambitious man, than public freedom. South-Carolina is not the only place in the world where a fir&s;t-rate citizen, of a guardian of his countrymens liberty, turned an invader, and &s;ubverted it, un|der pretence of pre&s;erving it.</P>

<HEAD>V. <HI>On the Confi&s;cation Act.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I SHALL now enter on the Confi&s;cation Act; make a few remarks on the Amercement Law; and conclude with endea|vouring to prove that an Act of Amne&s;ty and Oblivion is the only means for re&s;toring order, tranquility and happine&s;s to our common country.</P>
<P>The principal difficulty I meet with on a &s;ubject where &s;o much may be &s;aid, is to confine my&s;elf within the narrow compa&s;s I propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible not to feel di&s;tre&s;s when we reflect on the mi&s;eries which each party in a civil war, inflicts on the other as they become uppermo&s;t. The cruel oppre&s;&s;ions of the Briti&s;h, par|ticularly the per&s;onal in&s;ults and outrage we &s;uffered from their officers, after the fall of the country, is enough to make a man &s;hudder.</P>
<P>Their treatment was &s;o extravagantly outrageous, that no de&s;cription will ever give a ju&s;t idea of it; and to my&s;elf who was a witne&s;s and a &s;ufferer, it appears like a dream, and almo&s;t incredi|ble to me. Their cruelty to the garri&s;on; their violation of the capitulation; their &s;eque&s;tration and plunder; their bani&s;hing the tender &s;ex, our wives, and children, to a di&s;tant country, merely to gratify malice, as a days journey would have &s;et them down amid&s;t their friends in their own country: During all this &s;cene of violence and revenge, we our&s;elves never cea&s;ed to make the mo&s;t tragical complaints, and calling heaven and earth to witne&s;s and avenge the inju&s;tice of our enemies; and yet no &s;ooner did Providence turn things in our favour, and re&s;tore to us our country, than in&s;tead of thinking how to &s;ettle the peace and happine&s;s of it, we took the quite contrary way, and looked about for means of doing vengeance in our turn, by way of retaliation. No &s;ooner did we cea&s;e to fear and &s;uffer, than our next endeavour was to make others fear and feel mi&s;ery, as if it was nece&s;&s;ary either to be &s;uffering ruin or doing mi&s;chief. In thinking on the&s;e bitter calamities which men are &s;o ingenious in contriving for each other, he mu&s;t be more or le&s;s than man who cannot feel compa&s;&s;ion and &s;orrow for the unhappy lot of human nature, and cry out with Shake&s;pear,

<P>Our act of a&s;&s;embly which bani&s;hes &s;o many citizens, after reducing their families <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Beccaria makes the following remarks on confi&s;cation: <Q>The law which ordains confi&s;cations, &s;ets a price on the head of the &s;ubject; with the guilty puni&s;hes the innocent; and by reducing them to indigence and de&s;pair, tempts them to become criminal. Can there be a more melancholy &s;pectacle, than a whole family, over|whelmed with infamy and mi&s;ery, from the crime of their chief? a crime, which if it had been po&s;&s;ible, they were re&s;trained from preventing, by that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which the laws them&s;elves have ordained.</Q></NOTE> to beggary, <HI>without hearing,</HI> is perhaps the mo&s;t furious pro&s;cription of which we have any account in all hi&s;tory. Sylla, the Dictator, by virtue of his <HI>extraordinary powers,</HI> to be revenged on the party in oppo&s;ition, and enrich his own ad|herents, bani&s;hed more citizens, though he took not perhaps half the property we did. He di&s;dained however to do it under pre|tence or colour of law and con&s;titution; he did it as Lord Corn|wallis &s;eque&s;tered our e&s;tates, and bani&s;hed our families, by dint of military force, at the head of an army devoted to him.</P>
<P>In the civil di&s;cord and factions of the &s;mall republics of Greece, the party which was uppermo&s;t &s;ometimes bani&s;hed the leading men on the other &s;ide. But this proceeding was always done in a mobbi&s;h way, or by force of arms. But our A&s;&s;embly very peaceably, under the ma&s;k of ju&s;tice, and under the forms of par|liament, condemned the citizens in violation of the &s;pirit and &s;ub|&s;tance of both. No crime alledged; no one article of charge given in again&s;t any of them; nor does any &s;uch accu&s;ation appear on the journals of either hou&s;e at this moment. Before they heard of it with any certainty, the law was pa&s;&s;ed and their doom fixed. At the time the A&s;&s;embly was taking his property from the citizen, which the State &s;hould &s;ecure for the maintenance of his children; at the in&s;tant he was condemned to utter ruin and infamy, and put to a <HI>political death;</HI> the unhappy man was in Charle&s;town, with his wife and family; perhaps &s;truggling under the pre&s;&s;ure of ne|ce&s;&s;ity in getting them common nece&s;&s;aries, or &s;uffering under
<PB N="19" REF="017861_0019_0FA3741DC6ECBC50">Briti&s;h tyranny; and his little property going for a trifle, under the de&s;potic orders of a military tribunal. This was the ca&s;e with many of them.</P>
<P>And thus, a report or idle &s;lory, an old grudge, revenge, or malice, &s;upplied the place of legal accu&s;ation, of evidence, of Judge and Jury.</P>
<P>The inju&s;tice of this mea&s;ure is &s;o enormous, that the endeavour|ing to prove it, is like proving that the Sun now &s;hines at noon|day. Hearing the accu&s;ed, and giving him a chance to defend him&s;elf, is the fir&s;t and mo&s;t &s;acred rule of ju&s;tice. All &s;orts of laws, civil and military, laws of parliament, courts-martial, and others, hear proof and defence; and any tribunal that refu&s;es to hear proof, refu&s;es to do ju&s;tice; and mu&s;t thereby &s;uffer a ruin of character, and bear an eternal &s;tigma and reproach on the face of its proceedings.</P>
<P>According to Magna Charta, which is in force in this State, <Q>No man &s;hall be di&s;inherited, nor put out of his franchi&s;es, or freehold, unle&s;s he be duly brought to an&s;wer, and before-judg|ed by due cour&s;e of law, if any thing be done to the contrary, it &s;hall be redre&s;&s;ed and holden for none.</Q></P>
<P>By the&mdash;clau&s;e of our con&s;titution, or charter of liberties, <Q>No freeman ought to be taken or impri&s;oned, or di&s;&s;eized of his freehold, liberties or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any manner de&s;troyed, or deprived of his liberty or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land.</Q></P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to ob&s;erve that the liberty of the people through the other States, are &s;ecured again&s;t arbitrary power in the &s;ame man|ner, by their re&s;pective con&s;titutions. All of them have pa&s;&s;ed laws of bani&s;hment and confi&s;cation again&s;t &s;ome of their danger|ous citizens; but every one of them appointed a long day, and pub|lic notice was given in the prints, to render them&s;elves for trial.</P>
<P>Nor did they make any di&s;tinction, whether the parties were within the enemy's lines at New-York, or el&s;ewhere. The legi&s;|lature of Penn&s;ylvania, pa&s;&s;ed a <HI>Second Act,</HI> for giving a further time to certain of the exiles, who were &s;aid to be in England, and &s;uppo&s;ed to have been out of the reach of the former proclamation; and accordingly this &s;econd law was notified in the prints. I am credibly informed that the State of Maryland extended to their exiles, three years to come in and &s;hew their innocence. In &s;hort we are the only State in the Union, who ran blindfold into this irregular bu&s;ine&s;s, without hearing their defence or giving them a future day to make it; except the State of Georgia who improved on our example; but it &s;eems are now repenting of it.</P>
<P>The drivers of the confi&s;cation and other acts, may attempt to ju&s;tfy the late proceedings from the Parliamentary hi&s;tory of the Hou&s;e of Lords in England: The nation whence we de&s;cended; who&s;e code of laws we in general made u&s;e of, and who&s;e con|&s;titution of government we have copied as nearly as our circum|&s;tances will admit. If in the whole hi&s;tory of that people, the
<PB N="20" REF="017861_0020_0FA3741E8790DFD8">mea&s;ure of attainting without a hearing, cannot be &s;upported; then mu&s;t it fall to the ground: for as to the ju&s;tice, rea&s;on, or policy of it, the mind of man mu&s;t revolt at it.</P>
<P>I do aver it to be a law of Parliament, <Q>That on all bills of attainder the accu&s;ed do appear and put in his an&s;wer;</Q> and the hi&s;tory of England affords not a &s;ingle in&s;tance of an attainder, that was grounded upon <HI>general charges,</HI> without examination and hearing, but hath been univer&s;ally branded with marks of dete&s;ta|tion, by the lawyers and hi&s;torians of that nation, and is at this day, con&s;idered rather as a national reproach, than a precedent for imitation. It is true their parliament have been too often led by the furious heats of civil war, or the influence of arbitrary rulers, into acts of attainder without a hearing. But they have not only been execrated, but almo&s;t uniformly rever&s;ed by act of Parliament, for the inju&s;tice of them; as I &s;hall &s;hew pre&s;ently. In moderate reigns, and when arbitrary power did not prevail, bills of attainder in Parliament were conducted according to maxims of ju&s;tice, or <HI>&s;ecundum allegata &amp; probata:</HI> That is, the accu&s;ed was re&s;pon&s;ible only for &s;uch crimes as were <HI>alledged and proved</HI> again&s;t him; if he was in any port of the king's dominions, and forth coming, he had notice to appear, or was legally arre&s;ted; if he ab&s;conded, then they proclaimed a day for his appearance, which if he ob&s;erved not, they proceeded to attaint him.</P>
<P>On the bill of attainder again&s;t the Earl of Clarendon, [Lords Debates, Vol. I. &amp;c] he was &s;o generally obnoxious to all parties, that he did not think it &s;afe to abide by the event, but he fled his country to Holland. On this the hou&s;e &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the king to i&s;&s;ue a proclamation for his appearance, and afterwards the charges of impeachment again&s;t him were enquired into, and referred to the opinion of the Judges whether they were criminal or not. This is the law, this the mode of proceeding in the Briti&s;h Parliament, except where law and ju&s;tice were trampled on by tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have ob&s;erved, that bills of attainder were never intend|ed by the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, but as the ultimate re&s;ource upon extraordinary occa&s;ions: The de&s;ign of them was excellent; not to de&s;troy mechanics and people of ob&s;cure condition, &s;uch as our act of attainder is full of; but bills of attainder was originally in&s;tituted to call to a &s;evere reckoning, <HI>Governors</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;ters of State,</HI> who, of public &s;ervants, turned public enemies; and were by the influence which their very abu&s;e of power gave them, grown too big and weighty for Judge and Jury to deal with.</P>
<P>According to Judge Black&s;tone, this, and no other, was the true intent of bills of attainder. <Q>For though in general, &s;ays he, the union of the Legi&s;lature and judicial powers ought to be mo&s;t carefully avoided, yet it may happen <HI>that a &s;ubject intru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of public affairs, may infringe the rights
<PB N="21" REF="017861_0021_0FA3741F47626180">of the people, and be guilty of &s;uch crimes as the ordinary magi&s;trate, either does not or cannot puni&s;h.</HI></Q></P>

<P>I &s;hall leave the reader to apply the quotation as he chu&s;es, and go on to produce a few ca&s;es on attainders.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the reign of Edward III Roger, Earl Mor|timer, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lord Coke &s;ays they indicted him, and not being able to proceed that way, "Re&s;olved to ruin him by Attainder."</HI></NOTE> was condemned and executed without trial. But this at|tainder was rever&s;ed by Act of Parliament for this rea&s;on, <Q>becau&s;e he was not brought to judgement according to the cour&s;e of law.</Q></P>
<P>1&s;t. Ed. 3 The like happened to Edmond, Earl of Arundel; but in the 4th of this reign, his &s;on petitioned Parliament, &s;etting forth, "that the proceedings were contrary to Magna Charta, and in&s;id|ing he &s;hould have been tried by due cour&s;e of law" And he was re&s;tored in part; and an act of rever&s;al pa&s;&s;ed the 28th of this reign, <Q>declaring that the &s;tatute by which he was attainted, was void and null.</Q></P>
<P>4th. Ed. III. Sir Simon de Beresford, Materevers, and others were condemned to death without trial or examination, for killing Edward II. and his uncle. But the 19th of the &s;ame reign, a writ i&s;&s;ued to &s;u&s;pend the judgment again&s;t Materevers, for this rea&s;on, "becau&s;e it had been illegally pa&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>In the reign of Charles 1&s;t, the Earl of Stafford was attainted by Act of Parliament, but he was allowed to pot in his an&s;wer, and was heard before the Hou&s;e of Lords. However, though the charges again&s;t him, amounted not to trea&s;on or felony, he was condemned and executed through party malice and revenge; but in the next reign his attainder was, for the inju&s;tice of it, rever&s;ed by Act of Parliament, in which was a clau&s;e to this effect, viz. <Q>That the &s;aid act of attainder again&s;t Earl Stafford be obliterated from the journals of both hou&s;es, that the &s;ame be not vi&s;ible in after ages, nor u&s;ed as a precedent again&s;t any per&s;on what|&s;oever.</Q></P>
<P>For the act of attainder pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t Sir John Fenwick, Wil|liam the IIId. was branded by the Briti&s;h nation, becau&s;e he was attainted without a witne&s;s; whereas an act pa&s;&s;ed that very Par|liament requiring two witne&s;&s;es in ca&s;es of trea&s;on.</P>
<P><Q>It is impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ays an author of a treati&s;e on penal laws, to apologize for the many bloody &s;tains we find indelibly fixed upon Engli&s;h hi&s;tory. One of Henry VIII's Parliaments, attainted the Counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury, the Marchione&s;s of Exeter, and others, <HI>without any trial or citation to appear, or without better proofs than the &s;ugge&s;tions</HI> of the wretched &s;ycophant Cromwell, (his mini&s;ter.) This in&s;trument of regal tyranny, fell a &s;acri|fice to the &s;ame <HI>iniquitous mea&s;ures</HI> him&s;elf. He was &s;ome time afterward attainted by the &s;ame Parliament, and without trial,
<PB N="22" REF="017861_0022_0FA3742007F55E68">examination, or evidence, condemned to death and executed.</Q> Principle of penal laws, c. 5.</P>
<P>My Lord Coke's remark on Cromwell's attainder without trial, is thus:&mdash;Au&s;ert oblivio, &s;i potent, &s;i non utcunque &s;ilentium regat.&mdash;<HI>Let the tran&s;action be forever buried in oblivion, if po&s;&s;ible; if not, conceal it as well as we can.</HI> The&s;e cruel attainders are al&s;o cen&s;ured by Bi&s;hop Burnet, Hi&s;t. Reformat. <Q>Such bills, &s;ays he, cannot be enough condemned; for they were a breach of the mo&s;t &s;acred and unalterable rules of ju&s;tice.</Q></P>
<P>The cruelty of this Parliament in condemning the &s;ubjects with|out trial or examination is al&s;o branded with infamy, by the hi&s;torians, Hume, Rapin, and tho&s;e who went before them. To &s;trike a blow of vengeance under the ma&s;k of ju&s;tice, is the mo&s;t to be execrated of all iniquity; and the hi&s;torian who joins to a clear head, a good heart, never fails to deter po&s;terity from &s;uch deeds by painting them in proper colours. Mr Hume in the Counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury's ca&s;e, ob&s;erves; <Q>Henry re&s;olved to pro|ceed again&s;t her <HI>in a more &s;ummary and more tyrannical manner;</HI> he found that her offences could not be proved, or that &s;he could not by law be &s;ubjected to &s;uch &s;evere puni&s;hment as he de&s;ired to inflict on her. And for that purpo&s;e he &s;ent Cromwell, who was ob&s;equious to his will, to demand of the judges whether the Parliament could attaint a per&s;on who was forth-coming without giving him any trial, or citing him to appear before them. The Judges replied it was a dangerous que&s;tion, and <HI>that the high court of Parliament ought to give examples to inferior courts, of proceeding according to ju&s;tice&mdash;No inferior court could act in an arbitrary manner, and they thought the Parliament never would.</HI>&mdash;Being pre&s;&s;ed to give a more explicit an&s;wer, they replied, that if a per&s;on were attainted in that manner, the attainder after could never be brought in que&s;tion, and mu&s;t remain good in law. Henry learned by their deci&s;ion that &s;uch a method of proceeding, <HI>though the contrary to all principles of equity, was yet practicable.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In his account of Cromwell's fate he goes on. <Q>Immediately after a bill of attainder was framed again&s;t him, and the Hou&s;e of Peers thought proper, without trial, examination, or evidence, to condemn him to death. The only circum&s;tance of his conduct by which he &s;eems to have merited this fate was, his being the in&s;trument of the <HI>king's tyranny</HI> in conducting the like <HI>iniquitous bills</HI> in the former &s;e&s;&s;ions again&s;t the Counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury and others.</Q></P>
<P>The few quotations I have made need no comment. Every ca&s;e I have given runs parallel to that under con&s;ideration, and goes to prove the irregularity of the late proceedings.&mdash;They &s;hew what a clamour the illegal condemnation of even one &s;ubject makes in a nation that pretends to freedom. And that no Parliament was ever under&s;tood by any &s;ound lawyer, or good hi&s;torian, to have a lawful power to de&s;troy the citizens without trial or examination.
<PB N="23" REF="017861_0023_0FA37420C7194E78">It is &s;o cruel and unju&s;t in its nature, that it can never be made law|ful by an Act of Parliament or of A&s;&s;embly, any more than theft, adultery, or murder can.</P>
<P>But condemning without hearing is not the only objection again&s;t our late pro&s;cription; it is what the lawyers call an <HI>ex po&s;t facto law;</HI> which even in arbitrary governments is reckoned tyranny. An <HI>ex po&s;t facto law</HI> is &s;uch a law as is made <HI>to day,</HI> to puni&s;h the action of <HI>ye&s;terday,</HI> tho' ye&s;terday's action was innocent. A man for in&s;tance takes a protection from a conqueror, who is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country, or &s;igns a congratulation; this, I &s;ay, could not be puni&s;hed by any law of <HI>our</HI> State on a public and fair trial. To bring in a retro&s;pective act therefore, on purpo&s;e to ruin him, is an <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> law. It fir&s;t makes the crime out of nothing, or which is next to nothing, out of appearances: and afterwards ordains a puni&s;hment as revenge or caprice may dictate. It requires &s;ome reflection to &s;ee into the mi&s;chiefs of &s;uch laws. But all lawyers agree, <Q>that to puni&s;h for a fact done before there was a law to forbid it, is not, properly &s;peaking, a <HI>puni&s;hment,</HI> but <HI>ho&s;tility;</HI> not the penalty of the law, but the outrage of an enemy. For before the law was, there could be no trangre&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>Again&s;t laws &s;o de&s;tructive all moderate governments have armed them&s;elves: Mo&s;t of our Si&s;ter States have done it expre&s;sly by their Con&s;titutions. In the Declaration of Rights of the State of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, it is enacted, article 24, <Q>That laws made to puni&s;h for actions done before the exi&s;tence of &s;uch laws, and which have not been declared crimes by preceding laws, are unju&s;t, oppre&s;&s;ive, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the principles of a free government.</Q> Article 25, <Q>No &s;ubject ought in any ca&s;e, or at any time to be declared guilty of trea&s;on or felony by the Legi&s;lature.</Q></P>
<P>Other States are guarded by &s;imilar laws, and the &s;pirit of our own, if attended to, forbids the u&s;e of them. For if there exi&s;ted a country in which they were frequent, it mu&s;t be governed by the fierce pa&s;&s;ions of malice and revenge, and not by ju&s;tice and equity.</P>
<P>There are many weighty rea&s;ons why a Republic &s;hould be more cautious than any other form of government, not to tran&s;gre&s;s their laws and con&s;titutions by arbitrary mea&s;ures. A popular a&s;&s;embly, not governed by fundamental laws, but under the bla&s;s of anger, malice, or a thir&s;t for revenge, will commit more exce&s;s than an arbitrary monarch <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Athens the citizens went into a faction about a divi&s;ion of corn. Party-rage was carried &s;o far, that the &s;tronger &s;ide, actually &s;old <HI>5000</HI> of their fellow-citizens as &s;laves in the public market. This is the only ca&s;e that I recollect in hi&s;tory which exceeds the late <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">|franchi&s;ing of our citizens.</NOTE>; The extravagant tyranny of Alexander, Nero, Herod, Henry VIIIth and others, are well known.</P>
<P>But a popular a&s;&s;embly acting in the different characters of Legi&s;lators and judges, who proceed to confi&s;cation and bani&s;h|ment;
<PB N="24" REF="017861_0024_0FA3742186FF8CB8">to name names: to put in per&s;onal enemies, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In many in&s;tances at Jack&s;onborough, this was carried to extraordinary lengths. It is well known a certain gentleman who is now in the pre&s;ent A&s;&s;embly, would have been bani&s;hed, and his e&s;tate forfeited, had not &s;ome friend &s;ecreted the &s;lip of paper on which his name was in&s;erted.</NOTE> <HI>and keep out friends;</HI> will give more loo&s;e to malice, avarice, or revenge; commit more <HI>inju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>glaring partiality;</HI> and differ in outrage from one tyrant, as one fire-brand is inferior to many hundreds lighted together, and blown up by a fierce gale. Such deviations from ju&s;tice, moderation and temper, would fix di&s;grace on the very name of a republic.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this it will be &s;aid, that the exce&s;s of tho&s;e powers lately exerted by the legi&s;lature, can never be formidable, but to the enemies of the republic; and that nothing can be too &s;evere for the tories. <Q>Who can find fault with &s;everity of laws again&s;t men who were foremo&s;t in &s;upporting Briti&s;h tyranny?</Q> Why not give them a hearing, I &s;ay? They formerly took an oath of allegiance to the State; and admitting they were guilty of the greate&s;t crimes, they were &s;o far entitled to its protection, that they had a clear right to be heard in their defence.</P>
<P>Unthinking are tho&s;e who imagine that one arbitrary exertion of power will not open a door for many others! There is hardly an in&s;tance in hi&s;tory of a law made to be revenged on enemies, but that very law was brought in as a precedent to de&s;troy friends; and the thing is quite natural. For if the legi&s;lature can, without ceremony, or forms of law, &s;eize the property, or bani&s;h the per&s;on of the meane&s;t, or wor&s;t member of &s;ociety; what I pray can hinder their &s;tripping or bani&s;hing men of character and virtue? If &s;o ob&s;cure a man as <HI>Paday Hinas,</HI> or &s;o obnoxious a one as <HI>Bob Williams,</HI> can be bani&s;hed, amerced, or put to death without trial, hearing, or examination; whence comes &s;ecurity to you, or even to J&mdash; R&mdash; him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He, and other citizens may blind and flatter them&s;elves with hopes that no mi&s;chiefs can accrue from &s;uch tyrannical proceed|ings. But as factions and revolutions have been the lot of every republic that we ever heard of, our government will no doubt have its &s;hare of them.</P>
<P>Time which changes all things, may bring matters about, &s;o as to turn the tables again&s;t the very men who were foremo&s;t in driving down tho&s;e laws; for after this precedent I &s;ee nothing they have to depend on, but faction, cabals, or influence in the legi&s;lature: And the &s;heets on which tho&s;e laws are written, may wrap in winding-&s;heets &s;ome of their de&s;cendants.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved before, that hi&s;tory abounds with examples which prove, that arbitrary laws made to puni&s;h obnoxious people, have been generally u&s;ed afterwards, as precedents to the de&s;truction of the innocent.</P>

Therefore the application of &s;uch laws as that of the <HI>amercement,</HI> can never be &s;aid <HI>to be governing a country.</HI> It is ra|ther <HI>di&s;tracting it,</HI> and turning things up&s;ide down. Tho&s;e men
<PB N="26" REF="017861_0026_0FA3742306180F00">are deprived of their property, without being &s;o much as allowed to hear the accu&s;ation again&s;t them, contrary to the fundamental laws of the State. Can any one imagine that &s;uch extraordinary proceedings will produce no bad con&s;equence in the community? and that all divi&s;ion, di&s;content and murmur about the matter will be &s;oon over, as if nothing had happened? This law of it&s;elf would be &s;ufficient to di&s;turb the peace of the country, and alarm every thinking man in it; and he who thinks otherwi&s;e has but little knowledge of human nature.</P>
<P>The reader may judge by the preamble, whether the Committee who framed the Amercement Law, paid more attention to law and fact than they did civil language. <Q>Whereas many per&s;ons in|habitants of, and owing allegiance to this State (&s;ome bearing high and important commi&s;&s;ions) have withdrawn them&s;elves from the defence thereof, accepted protection, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>I have proved already that our government was di&s;&s;olved; it did not exi&s;t, and of cour&s;e tho&s;e who are amerced could not withdraw from its defence: At the Republic could not give the citizen pro|tection, which is the equivalent he receives for allegiance, he owed none, and yet the preamble in&s;i&s;ts, "they owed allegiance." We al&s;o &s;ee that "accepting protection" is &s;tated as a high crime, though I have proved above it was not. It goes on: <Q>And are either within the lines of the enemy, or have omitted to enroll them&s;elves and perform the duties of their country, pointed out and required by the Proclamation of his Excellency the Govern|or, of the 27th of September, in utter contempt of the executive authority, and evil example of &s;ociety.</Q></P>
<P>My remarks on the circum&s;tances of the inhabitants who were within <HI>the enemy's guards,</HI> have, I hope, &s;atisfied the reader that the proclamation was improper and oppre&s;&s;ive; that tho&s;e citizens could not po&s;&s;ibly comply with it; and that remaining where they were was perfectly ju&s;tifiable.</P>
<P><Q>And whereas there are others, who forgetting the &s;ocial ties of kindred and humanity, and regardle&s;s of the duty and alle|giance they had mo&s;t &s;olemnly &s;worn to their country, did actu|ally &s;ub&s;cribe, and pay by them&s;elves or agents, con&s;iderable &s;ums of money towards mounting and equipping a troop or troops of cavalry, or other military force for the &s;ervice of his Britannic Maje&s;ty.</Q> It is a maxim of our law that the greater the crime of which any citizen is accu&s;ed, the clearer &s;hould be the proof to convict him of it: Yet the preamble &s;tates tho&s;e facts without any &s;ort of proof that can be called <HI>legal,</HI> and in ut|ter contempt of all law-knowledge declares the facts to be a crime, that if true, were not puni&s;hable by our laws.</P>
<P>In all countries overrun by an invading and victorious army, no|thing more common than to rai&s;e, what is called <HI>Contribution,</HI> for the &s;upport of it; and in cities and civilized places, to make the matter ea&s;y to the people, or from an affectation of politene&s;s, which &s;oldiers of fortune can &s;ometimes put on, with the bayonet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> your brea&s;t, the thing is generally done by <HI>&s;ub&s;cription;</HI> and we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> the fir&s;t example of &s;uch contribution being charged as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>

Tho&s;e in Charle&s;town who &s;ub&s;cribed for the Briti&s;h cavalry, were &s;ome of them voluntiers for rai&s;ing a force again&s;t us; but I be|lieve this was not the ca&s;e with all of them; the citizens was under the yoke of a tyrant, who had a thou&s;and ways of doing him mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>He had favours to a&s;k of Briti&s;h commanders; a re&s;toration of indigo, rice, cattle, or other property, was a great one that day; and to be purcha&s;ed only by mortifying conce&s;&s;ions. To &s;uch people the <HI>&s;ub&s;cribing to Briti&s;h cavalry,</HI> was another name for <HI>contribution.</HI> It was done perhaps under the highe&s;t nece&s;&s;ity and compul&s;ion. To make that a crime therefore, by a <HI>retro&s;pective law,</HI> which was none before, and condemn them to near a third of their property, was what I mentioned above, to be puni&s;hing by <HI>ex po&s;t facto law,</HI> and is arbitrary and uncon&s;titutional. The amerced citizens are painted as mi&s;creants who do not de&s;erve to live; yet not one act charged in the preamble could be con&s;trued to be a breach of any law of South-Carolina.</P>
<P>As the amercement law is founded on inju&s;tice and bad policy; it is no wonder that the mode in which it is inforced, adds to the hard&s;hip of it. Three freeholders are cho&s;en by the commi&s;&s;ioners, to apprai&s;e tho&s;e e&s;tates, without the controul or challenge of the owner: and however enormous the valuation they &s;et, yet he mu&s;t abide by it, without appeal or redre&s;s. The freeholders may be raw unexperienced men, or bia&s;&s;ed by the prejudices, malice, or revenge, peculiar to civil troubles, or mi&s;led by a thir&s;t for &s;pecula|tion on the property of their neighbour. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee therefore, that inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be the lot of many. It is &s;aid by good judges, that &s;ome e&s;tates have been apprai&s;ed at upwards of twice their real value; &s;o that the proprietor, in&s;tead of 12 or 30 <HI>per cent.</HI> may &s;uffer an entire confi&s;cation of the whole. Tho&s;e who have <HI>large families to bring up,</HI> and are <HI>much in debt,</HI> mu&s;t be com|pletely ruined; and in this manner are our laws and forms of ju&s;tice overturned, which have been handed down as our birth-right for ages pa&s;t; and the fruits of a man's toil and indu&s;try, which every good government ought to &s;ecure for the education and advancement of his children, are &s;natched from him in a moment.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething very curious in the &s;tory of the republic which was attempted in England, in the la&s;t century, after the trial and execution of Charles I. and the expul&s;ion of his family. It is worth the reader's attention: The true republican &s;pirit never &s;hone with more lu&s;tre on any &s;pot of the globe. Such was the enthu&s;ia&s;m of that nation, that it produced, as it were in an in&s;tant, a race of heroes, patriots, and men of letters, who all di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in pulling down kingly government, and &s;etting up a commonwealth.</P>
<P>The great <HI>Milton, Harrington,</HI> and other men of genius, em|ployed all the charms of eloquence to cheri&s;h and &s;upport it. But their liberties under their favourite republic they did not maintain a moment. Not becau&s;e the conjuncture of affairs was unfavourable; for it was quite otherwi&s;e. But the members of the new legi&s;lature, <HI>forgetting that they were young beginners in the art of governing;</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="017861_0028_0FA3742486C77D28">in&s;tead of endeavouring to reconcile all parties to the republic, by a temperate admini&s;tration of law and ju&s;tice; &s;et to work immedi|ately to gratify per&s;onal malice and revenge; and pur&s;ue their adver&s;aries, the <HI>Royali&s;ts,</HI> with <HI>confi&s;cation</HI> and <HI>amercement.</HI></P>
<P>Some had to avenge cruelty or in&s;ults, when in the hands of their enemies; others the burning of their hou&s;es, or to retaliate the death of their kindred; or the plunder of their property; all which mi&s;|chiefs, the royal party, in the hour of &s;ucce&s;s, never failed to ex|ecute.</P>
<P>By way of retaliation, <Q>they were plundered, impri&s;oned, de|cimated, &s;ays an annali&s;t, and &s;o worried by amercements or fines, that they were forced to compound over and over, 'till at la&s;t they had nothing left.</Q></P>
<P>Many of them were forced by &s;uch tyranny, to fly their country, and &s;uffered &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s abroad, that the very gentlemen were forced to fell them&s;elves as &s;laves to the Dutch, who accordingly tran&s;ported them to their plantations.</P>
<P>The ble&s;&s;ings of heaven could not attend &s;cenes of &s;uch oppre&s;&s;i|on. The &s;pirit of di&s;cord went forth among the people; mutual hatred and animo&s;ity aro&s;e between neighbours; fear and appre|hen&s;ions &s;eized others, for them&s;elves or family connections: Men had no re&s;ource or &s;afety, but to enter into parties, form factions and cabals, to &s;upport them&s;elves or friends. And thus oppre&s;&s;i|on, hatred, malice, and vexation, &s;eemed to have been let loo&s;e by Divine Providence, as a puni&s;hment on the nation. Their af|fairs at la&s;t were &s;o entangled and di&s;tracted by the animo&s;ity of contending parties, that the tyrant Cromwell &s;prung up in the heighth of it; and the &s;en&s;ible part of the people were glad to &s;ubmit to his u&s;urpation, rather than bear any longer the mi&s;ery of being governed by men, who &s;et moderation and ju&s;tice at defiance and who proved them&s;elves totally incapable of any thing, but to create public and private ruin.</P>
<P>God Almighty has &s;o ordered the affairs of men in this world, that a mi&s;chievous legi&s;lature, any more than a mi&s;chievous indi|vidual, can never &s;ucceed in oppre&s;&s;ion and inju&s;tice, without drawing down a cur&s;e and misfortune on it&s;elf. And &s;hould the legi&s;lature of South-Carolina, and Georgia per&s;i&s;t in the fearful mea&s;ures lately pur&s;ued, I make no ceremony to foretel, that we and they &s;hall remain a con&s;picuous example with po&s;terity, to prove, <HI>that the people are incapable of governing them&s;elves. Tyranny</HI> will be furni&s;hed from our hi&s;tory with another new example to e&s;tabli&s;h her favourite principle, <Q>that mankind were de&s;tined by nature for &s;lavery, and to be hewers of wood and drawers of water for <HI>one</HI> or <HI>a few.</HI></Q></P>

<HEAD>VII. <HI>The Conclu&s;ion, with Remarks to prove the Nece&s;&s;ity of an Amne&s;ty, or Act of Oblivion</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE experience of all countries has &s;hewn, that where a com|munity &s;plits into a faction, and has recour&s;e to arms, and one finally gets the better, a law to bury in <HI>oblivion</HI> pa&s;t tran&s;actions
<PB N="29" REF="017861_0029_0FA374254812CD90">is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;tore tranquillity. For if after a civil war, and one party vanqui&s;hed, per&s;ecution was to go on; if the fury of laws and the fierce rage of pa&s;&s;ions prevailed, while the minds of men were yet fired by deadly revenge again&s;t their fallen adver&s;aries; this would be wor&s;e than keeping up the war: it would be carrying on ho&s;tility under the &s;hape of ju&s;tice, which is the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive, and of all other inju&s;tice, excites the greate&s;t de|te&s;tation, and the mo&s;t violent factions and divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>Every part of Europe has had its &s;hare of affliction by u&s;urpation, or civil war, as we have had lately; but every one of them con&s;i|dered an act of oblivion as the fir&s;t &s;tep on their return to peace and order. This was the ca&s;e in Greece and Rome, as well as in Eng|land and other places, as I &s;hall &s;hew by a few examples.</P>
<P>The cruelty of the thirty tyrants in Athens exceeded all bounds. Xenophon tells us, they de&s;troyed more citizens in eight months than were killed in thirty years war; and what made them more formidable was their being &s;upported by 3000 citizens. However, they were at la&s;t depo&s;ed by an armed force, under Thra&s;y|bulus, and their ruin was followed by a general amne&s;ty. <Q>By which order wi&s;ely made, and carefully ob&s;erved, the city returned to its former quietne&s;s, &s;ays Raleigh.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I cannot forbear ob&s;erving, &s;ays Rollin, &s;peaking of that event, the wi&s;dom and moderation of Thra&s;ybulus, &s;o e&s;&s;ential after a long continuance of dome&s;tic troubles. <HI>This is one of the fine&s;t events in antient hi&s;tory, worthy the Athenian lenity and benevolence,</HI> and has &s;erved as a model for &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages to good governments.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Never had tyranny been more cruel and bloody than that which the Athenians had &s;haken off: Every hou&s;e was in mourning: Every family bewailed the lo&s;s of &s;ome relation. I had been a &s;eries of public robbery and rapine; in which licence and impunity had authorized all manner of crimes. The people &s;eemed to have a right to demand the blood of all accomplices in their villainies; but Thra&s;ybulus ro&s;e above tho&s;e &s;entiments: from the &s;uperiority of his genius, and his views of a more di&s;tingui&s;hing policy, he fore&s;aw that <HI>by giving into the puni&s;h|ment</HI> of the guilty, eternal &s;eeds of di&s;cord and enmity would remain and weaken the republic by dome&s;tic divi&s;i|ons.</Q></P>
<P>All hi&s;torians and political writers condemn the mi&s;chievous policy of pur&s;uing the citizens with pro&s;ecutions after civil wars. Machiavel him&s;elf, tho' for violent mea&s;ures on other occa&s;ions, yet &s;trongly recommends an act of oblivion after a revolution. And he cen&s;ures the conduct of the Roman republic on the expul|&s;ion of the ten tyrants, for not pa&s;&s;ing an amne&s;ty, in&s;tead of carrying on pro&s;ecutions again&s;t tho&s;e citizens who &s;upported their tyranny.</P>
<P>In that republic ten of their principal citizens were entru&s;ted with <HI>extraordinary powers;</HI> but regardle&s;s of laws or con&s;titution, they &s;eized on the government and freedom of the people; who, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the army, expelled them after three years
<PB N="30" REF="017861_0030_0FA374260713C480">u&s;urpation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appius was at the head of that tyranny, and his cruelty and lu&s;t are well known. Yet the proceedings again&s;t him are condemned by all hi&s;torians, for he was refu&s;ed a hearing and appeal before the people, agreeable to their con&s;titution.</NOTE>. Inflamed with &s;ucce&s;s and revenge, the very people who had taken the tyrant's protection, for all did it; were for putting to death the mo&s;t violent and mi&s;chievous and their adherents. Machiavel's remarks on this conduct is worth noting.</P>
<P><Q>It is a very great fault in a State, &s;ays he, every day in the citizens minds to renew the memory of old wrongs done to this and that man, with new puni&s;hments, as it befel at Rome under the Decemvirate. For all the ten, and &s;undry other citizens were accu&s;ed and condemned, &s;o that the nobility were affrighted, thinking they would never leave off condemning them 'till they had de&s;troyed the whole. And certainly it had produced &s;ome great commotion in the city, if Marcus Duellius the Tribune, had not pa&s;&s;ed a decree, that for a whole year it &s;hould not be lawful to accu&s;e any citizen. Where we &s;ee how great a hurt it is in a republic, or prince, to hold their &s;ubjects minds in &s;u&s;picion and fear with continual pro&s;ecutions and puni&s;hments; <HI>and without doubt a wor&s;e cour&s;e cannot be taken.</HI> For men that begin to doubt of mi&s;chief in any ca&s;e, provide for them&s;elves in their danger, grow bolder and le&s;s re&s;pectful how they venture on novelties. Wherefore it is nece&s;&s;ary never to hurt any, or the hurt that is done to do it at once, and afterwards let them enjoy &s;ome a&s;&s;urance that may give them cau&s;e to quiet and &s;ettle their minds.</Q> Machiavels di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Whether the nece&s;&s;ity of a general amne&s;ty ever occured to the reader or not, the above ob&s;ervations will &s;trike him very forcibly, as they apply &s;o well to our pre&s;ent &s;ituation. However, to make this matter &s;till clearer, I &s;hall draw a compari&s;on between the conduct of the Briti&s;h nation, on the re&s;toration, after the grand rebellion, and of our legi&s;lature on the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of our re|public in 1782.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the two countries was &s;imilar in this, that Eng|land &s;uffered a u&s;urpation under Cromwell, and other tyrants, and South-Carolina under the tyranny of Great-Britain: And the in|habitants of both countries, with few exceptions, &s;ubmitted to the u&s;urpers. But in other circum&s;tances England differed from us: Briti&s;h tyranny prevailed in this country only about 16 months. Their officers plundered our &s;ide boards of <HI>place,</HI> and our ward|robes of their <HI>contents,</HI> to a con&s;iderable amount; and &s;tole, or were the death of about twenty thou&s;and negroes. In battle and cold blood they de&s;troyed perhaps 3000 of our citizens; and they tortured our every manlike feeling, by di&s;tre&s;&s;ing our families, and in&s;ults to our&s;elves, whenever we fell into their hands. This is rating our damage pretty fairly.</P>
<P>But the&s;e injuries vani&s;h into nothing, compared with what the Engli&s;h nation &s;uffered in the grand rebellion. It la&s;ted 19 years I think. The &s;tronger party dethroned the prince, brought him
<PB N="31" REF="017861_0031_0FA37426C68BDB88">to a public trial, and put him to death. The heir to the crown-having been detained under various indignities a pri&s;oner in Scot|land, put him&s;elf at the head of an army; and was defeated in battle at Worce&s;ter.</P>
<P>Ten thou&s;and of his adherents were made pri&s;oners, many of whom Cromwell &s;old as &s;laves to the We&s;t-India planters. Young Charles, after the rout was hunted like a deer, and by a&s;&s;uming various di&s;gui&s;es got to France. When abroad he was reduced &s;o low that he could not command a pi&s;tole. The number of &s;ub|jects de&s;troyed on both &s;ides is computed at half a million.</P>
<P>When the troubles were over, and Charles the Second was re|&s;tored to the throne, he had his own injuries and the ruin of his friends, to avenge. But did he avenge tho&s;e injuries? Did he di&s;|mi&s;s his fir&s;t parliament, as we did the la&s;t a&s;&s;embly, leaving the terrors of laws hanging over the people's heads; and re&s;olve to &s;end the courts of &s;e&s;&s;ions through the country, to fill it with condemnati|ons and convicts, to the di&s;grace and utter di&s;tre&s;s of families, and add to the li&s;t of widows and orphans? He did nothing of all this. The very fir&s;t bill he pa&s;&s;ed was an act of amne&s;ty, to &s;ettle the di&s;tractions of the nation. Had he rea&s;oned like our politicians, he would have fallen upon confi&s;cation, bani&s;hment and amerce|ment; and under pretence of preventing a future rebellion, he would like us, have pa&s;&s;ed acts to exclude from votes or &s;eats in the legi&s;lature, &s;uch as were deemed enemies to royalty. In&s;tead of &s;uch like mea&s;ures, which would have only increa&s;ed the nation's misfortunes, he pa&s;&s;ed a general amne&s;ty; out of which forty nine of the late king's judges were excepted. The&s;e had a fair and public trial, and of the whole, ten only were executed. This was all the blood &s;hed after &s;o furious a civil war.</P>
<P>I &s;hall tran&s;cribe one healing clau&s;e of this famous <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I refer any of the Gentlemen in the A&s;&s;embly to the fir&s;t volume of the Lords debates.</NOTE> act of am|ne&s;ty, which is worthy to be remembered.</P>
<P><Q>And to the end and purpo&s;e that all names and terms of di&s;|tinction, may be likewi&s;e put in utter oblivion, be it further enacted, that if any per&s;on or per&s;ons, within the &s;pace of three years next en&s;uing, &s;hall pre&s;ume maliciou&s;ly to call or alledge, or object again&s;t any per&s;on or per&s;ons, any name or names, or other words of reproach, any way leading to revive the memo|ry of the late differences; that then every &s;uch per&s;on offending as afore&s;aid, &s;hall pay ten pounds if a gentleman, and forty &s;hillings if of an inferior degree.</Q></P>
<P>It is a maxim in politics, that if a breach be made in the con&s;ti|tution of a government, and it be not healed, it will prove as fatal to its freedom, as a wound that is neglected and &s;uffered to mortify, would to the life of a man. I proved clearly that ours received a mortal one; and &s;hould the pre&s;ent a&s;&s;embly leave it <HI>to inflame,</HI> without applying a cure, we cea&s;e to be a free people. The reme|dy I &s;peak of is lenient, all healing. <HI>Repeal at once the late election act, the amercement law, and the confi&s;cation act, as far as it affects

<P>If every citizen cannot enjoy the rights of <HI>election</HI> and <HI>repre&s;entation,</HI> according to the con&s;titution, I hope <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">o body will be &s;o idle as to talk of <HI>Liberty.

<P>The&s;e are the &s;entiments of one who pleads not for per&s;onal in|dulgence. In the varieties of good and bad fortune which America has pa&s;&s;ed thro', he &s;hared in her joys and &s;orrows. Though the connection with her brought him little be&s;ides the affection &s;he in|&s;pired; though the changes in her health and appearance were often for the wor&s;t, yet it made no change in him; and neither in feeling, word, or deed, from the fidelity he pledged to her, has he deviated a moment. If he has any political &s;in to an&s;wer for, it is that he di&s;dains in the hour of &s;ucce&s;s, to triumph over the di&s;tre&s;s of any man who once bore the name of a fellow-citizen. And &s;hould the pre&s;ent publication but contribute to re&s;tore harmony to the Repub|lic; or prevent the return of the bitter hours of heart-ake, which many an innocent man has undergone &s;ince la&s;t January; then however &s;ilent or ob&s;cure my walk in life, I &s;hall enjoy a &s;weet and &s;ecret plea&s;ure of having done &s;ome &s;ervice to my country.</P>
