<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SOME may a&s;k, why I have not taken notice, in the following pamphlet, of Porcupine's life? to which I would an&s;wer, that this pamphlet was written and ready for the pre&s;s before he publi&s;hed his life; and as he has brought forward no fact or argument to induce me to change my belief, but rather to confirm it, with re&s;pect to his being "a hireling writer;" I declined altering it, or taking any notice of his life. But if I have occa|&s;ion to write another pamphlet, "out of his own mouth will I condemn him;" and prove to the world, whatever his &s;upporters may think of him, that it is true what the Reviewers have &s;aid of his writings, that "they are a di&s;honor to any party." And more I will prove, that he and his party had &s;upported their mea&s;ures by fal&s;ehood, and mi&s;repre&s;enta|tion; in proof of this I will recur to one fact only, on the pre&s;ent occa|&s;ion. It is a well known circum&s;tance that all the writers, in &s;upport of the treaty, from Philadelphia on to the ea&s;tward, rai&s;ed the "hue and cry" among the farmers, that if they would not turn out and petition in &s;upport of the treaty, it would be rejected; and the con&s;equence finally would be, that their grain would become a mere drug, they would find no mar|ket for it; and it would lie, and rot on their hands. But when the trea|ty was adopted to their entire &s;atisfaction, and time brought round things in their natural order; what was the con&s;equence that actually took place, which we have heard, which we have &s;een; and which is known to every farmer from one end of the union to the other. Then I will tell you Mr. Fenno, p&s;haw! its nothing more than about &s;ix, or &s;even weeks after the treaty was finally ratified; wheat and flour fell in New-York, and many other towns, to nearly one half le&s;s than it was previous to the adopting of the treaty; what think you of the treaty now Johnney? go blu&s;h ye fabricators! Ye fal&s;e &s;tory-tellers! and hide your heads a|mong the pumpkin vines of Connecticut, and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts; and amu&s;e your countrymen by fabricating marvellous &s;tories. Go tell them! that one of Mr. Ames's con&s;tituents had a large turkey cock, that hatched a dozen of eggs in con&s;equence of the treaty's being ratified; and that the clouds poured forth &s;howers of fi&s;h, upon the plantation of one of Mr. Buck's con&s;tituents. Go tell them! that the cats would not kitten, nei|ther the yews bring forth their young, nor their young men bundle with the bonny la&s;&s;es, unle&s;s the treaty would be adopted. Go ye fabulators! and &s;ing ho&s;annas to the Lord, and tell your countrymen, that even the mules of Connecticut have become prolific &s;ince the treaty was ratified.</P>
<P>"But Porcupine abu&s;es all men!" exclaimed a republican, to a well known ari&s;tocrat with whom I was conver&s;ing the other day; "you are mi&s;taken, replied the gentle ari&s;tocrat, he has in the hi&s;tory of his life paid Mr. Carey a very hand&s;ome compliment;" and &s;o the matter ended between them. But in order to &s;atisfy my own curio&s;ity, I went and purcha&s;ed the hi&s;tory of his life; and to my great &s;urpri&s;e I found the compliment to be preci&s;ely this, that Mr. Carey had acted with re&s;pect to Porcupine, in concealing his per&s;on from the public, as a man of honor; and Porcupine &s;imply relates the cricum&s;tance, but with evident reluct|ance;
<PB N="iv" REF="030155_0003_0FE4B03FE4B80A28">
now where is the compliment? If Porcupine by &s;aying it was an act of honor in Mr. Carey to conceal his per&s;on, had made it become &s;o, as the edict of kings has often attached honor, or di&s;honor to an action; then, and not until then would he have paid Mr. Carey a compliment. For the action was it&s;elf an honorable one, and the opinion of Porcupine, or any other individual will neither make it more nor le&s;s &s;o. If every man who performs an honorable action mu&s;t be under a compliment to ano|ther, it e&s;tabli&s;hes at once a check upon every virtuous proceeding; and we are in future to look for honour and virtue, only among &s;laves and cowards; where we have the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of finding them. He com|plains that Mr. Carey treated him with a certain degree of contempt, on his fir&s;t interview with him; and wi&s;hes for another yellow fever, that he might al&s;o acquire a fortune. The in&s;inuation here conveyed is ob|vious, that is, that Mr. Carey has become elate with pro&s;perity. I have conver&s;ed with him both before and &s;ince the yellow fever, and have ne|ver di&s;covered any change in his conduct; and am per&s;uaded an hundred others in town will &s;ay the &s;ame thing. He has underwent a change it is true, but it is a change of a different nature from what Porcupine in&s;inu|ates; it is the change of care into contentment on finding his indu&s;try rewarded; it is a change which every man, under the &s;ame circum&s;tan|ces, mu&s;t feel, who lives among "a people where riches fix the only con&s;ideration," where men are e&s;teemed and care&s;&s;ed only in proportion to their wealth.&mdash;An artful &s;entiment indeed, that riches ought to fix the only con&s;ideration, for <HI>our modern fine gentlemen of ye&s;terday</HI> to introduce to obtain re&s;pect, who&s;e merit is commen&s;urate with their riches; and who&s;e genius or abilities is below the notice of mankind; for deprive them of their wealth and you rob them of the only merit they po&s;&s;e&s;s. Were they el&s;where, but by their own fire &s;ides &mdash; were they el&s;ewhere, but in Phila|delphia, they would find to their eternal &s;hame, that &s;omething more than riches would be nece&s;&s;ary, to render them re&s;pectable in the opinion of o|thers. Had Mr. Carey, like Mr. Y&mdash;, when he acquired a fortune, plumed him&s;elf in a bob-tailed coat, with the collar hanging half way down his back, and bedaubed with powder; had he, like him, purcha&s;ed a country hou&s;e, and drive in his carriage every morning behind his coun|ter, with a tippee cane in his hand; would he, like him, when a poor man comes into his &s;hop, to purcha&s;e a pamphlet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> up his no&s;e as if he felt an offen&s;ive &s;mell; and an&s;wer him, with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">eering grin, &s;ome mi|nutes after the poor man had a&s;ked him for it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> that he had no &s;uch pamphlet;" then might it be in&s;inuated indeed that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> Carey had become elate with pro&s;perity.</P>

<HEAD>A VINDICATION.</HEAD>
<P>HAD a writer, who &s;tiles him&s;elf Porcupine, taken the advice of Doctor Swift, when he publi&s;hed his two fir&s;t pieces; he might have pa&s;&s;ed on the world as a humorous facetious writer.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a <HI>brain</HI> that will endure but one <HI>&s;cumming;</HI> let the owner gather it with di&s;cretion, and manage his little &s;tock with hu&s;bandry. But of all things let him beware of bringing it under the <HI>la&s;h</HI> of his <HI>betters;</HI> becau&s;e that will make it all bubble up into impertinence, and he will find no new &s;upply: Wit without knowledge being a &s;ort of <HI>cream,</HI> which ga|thers in a night to the top, and by a &s;kilful hand may be &s;oon <HI>whipt</HI> into <HI>froth;</HI> but once &s;cummed away, what appears underneath, will be fit for nothing, but to be thrown to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ogs.</NOTE> The citizens being unaccu&s;tomed to receive &s;uch pieces, from the pre&s;s of an Ame|rican printer, their novelty procured them a general circulation; whil&s;t the ridicule they contained &s;erved to indulge a &s;pirit of party &s;pleen: by exciting mirth at the expence of o|thers. For mo&s;t men may be laughed out of their money, but there are few who can be rea|&s;oned out of it. The rapid &s;ale of his two fir&s;t pieces en&s;ured him &s;ucce&s;s, with the party who&s;e cau&s;e he had e&s;pou&s;ed; and a foreign agent, finding to what advantage his turn for ridicule might be employed, to &s;upport the de|te&s;ted cau&s;e of a Briti&s;h faction, has con&s;e|quently paid him &s;everal vi&s;its; this has been &s;ome time ago made known to the public, and is now generally believed. What a cabal was

rai&s;ed again&s;t citizen Genet, three years ago, becau&s;e a certain party had a&s;&s;erted, that he interfered in the internal government of our country. Admitting he did interfere, was he more culpable than the other, who does it by means of an hireling. Surely his being a na|tive of this city, and a tory; nay were he the royal a&s;s him&s;elf, it would never ju&s;tify him in the opinion of tho&s;e, who regard the internal peace and happine&s;s of their country. Had Porcupine confined him&s;elf to tran&s;lations from the French, and giving in&s;tructions in that language, to tho&s;e who thought proper to em|ploy him; he would not have drawn upon him|&s;elf the ju&s;t indignation of a whole people; for tho&s;e in&s;ults and gro&s;s epithets, with which he has vilified them. Nor would we have &s;een him under the contemptible alternative of forg|ing a letter;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See his Scare-Crow.</NOTE> wherein he cen&s;ures him&s;elf for his gro&s;s calumny; that he might, by that mean, afford him&s;elf an opportunity of vindicating his conduct, and apologi&s;ing for tho&s;e in&s;ults he has given to the American citizens. He has now opened a book-&s;tore, through the bounty of this <HI>pious</HI> agent, and his intere&s;t tells him, he ought, to conciliate the affection and con|fidence of all parties. For it is a&s;&s;erted, by &s;ome, that his employer having now gained his point; and having di&s;covered by his la&s;t pieces, that the fountain has nearly ran dry, and an eter|nal drought mu&s;t &s;ucceed; he has con&s;equent|ly withdrawn his golden au&s;pices, and thrown

Porcupine on the mercy of an offended people. But a momentary contrition will not palliate for mob, banditti, &amp;c. with which he has &s;o often vilified the peaceable citizens of the Uni|ted States; cut-throats and murderers, with which he has abu&s;ed their friends the French; thieves and robbers, with which he has calum|niated the Iri&s;h; who contributed &s;o largely, in the late revolution, to humble the blu&s;tering pride of Britain. How far the different parties, whom he accu&s;es, are de&s;erving of his calum|ny and &s;lander, we need have recurrence but to a few facts, and arguments, to di&s;cover. There has not been, in my remembrance, a col|lection of the inhabitants, in this city, &s;ince after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace in eighty-three; who &s;hewed the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ition to riot, or act in open defiance of the laws of the &s;tate, or of humanity and decorum; except one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was this mob, or a party of it, that dragged from their lodgings, to the A&s;&s;embly-room, the members in the minority of the &s;tate legi&s;lature, who had withdrawn on taking the que&s;tion, "Shall the federal con&s;titution be now adopted," and compelled them to make a quorum, that the hou&s;e might proceed to take the vote.</NOTE> on the a|doption of the federal con&s;titution, when &s;ome of Porcupine's pre&s;ent friends&mdash;the old tories of '76&mdash;the very &s;cum of &s;ociety, a&s;&s;embled together, and were headed by a certain gentle|man; who led them (it was after night) to a re|&s;pectable clergyman's hou&s;e in this city; who was a known friend to the revolution, and in|&s;ulted him and his family, with every mark of indignity. The next day it was affirmed, by an eye-witne&s;s, that this &s;ame gentleman, who
<PB N="8" REF="030155_0007_0FE4B04B8ED50328">
headed the mob, went upon his hands and feet, at the clergyman's door; and <HI>bow-wowed</HI> in imitation of one of his dome&s;tic animals, in hopes of gaining admi&s;&s;ion The odium of a bankruptcy, and a derangement of his pecuni|ary circum&s;tances, &s;till pre&s;&s;ing heavily upon his &s;houlders; he cunningly took this method to recommend him&s;elf to a certain party, who have always had the banks, the principal &s;ource of wealth, under their direction. He &s;ucceed|ed in his &s;cheme, and his &s;on now drives, in &s;tate, to his compting-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The next mob that appeared was during the time of the embargo; when a party of Bri|ti&s;h &s;ailors a&s;&s;embled, and paraded through the &s;treets, in a haughty manner. They marched up behind congre&s;s-hall where the members were &s;itting; and became noi&s;y and clamor|ous, in &s;uch a degree, that one of Porcupine's party, not knowing it was his friends who had a&s;&s;embled there, got greatly alarmed, &s;tarted from his &s;eat, and made a motion for the ad|journment of Congre&s;s, to &s;ome other place.</P>
<P>The la&s;t collection of people, who had the lea&s;t appearance of a mob, &s;hewed them&s;elves at the clo&s;e of the town meeting, in the State-Hou&s;e yard, la&s;t &s;ummer; when &s;ome boys, to the number, perhaps, of two hundred; a|mong whom were &s;everal &s;ailors, who wi&s;ely fore&s;aw, that the treaty would afford them no protection, again&s;t the inhumanity and &s;avage cruelty of the Briti&s;h; paraded through &s;ome of the &s;treets, burnt the treaty in effigy, and
<PB N="9" REF="030155_0008_0FE4B04D15A32F40">
proceeded to the hou&s;e of a certain &s;enator, and broke a &s;ingle pane of gla&s;s, in one of his windows; without &s;hewing any other mark of a riotous di&s;po&s;ition. And it is more than pro|bable, that even that &s;olitary pane would not have been broken, had not a well known Vi&s;|count, who was riding forward in company with the proprietor of the hou&s;e, the folly and pre&s;umption, to get upon one of the gentle|man's coach-hor&s;es, and attempted to ride down the boys; in order to ingratiate him&s;elf, no doubt, into the e&s;teem of the &s;enator and his family. Such a wild, and extravagant attempt of a &s;orry individual like him, who was, and is him&s;elf dete&s;ted by the people, was &s;ufficient to excite them, to that &s;ingle act, of outrage&mdash;and it did &s;o. As &s;oon as they di&s;covered, that it was the noble Vi&s;count, who was on hor&s;eback; &s;ome one of the mob, who accidentally had a &s;tump of an old fi&s;h|ing rod, or a &s;mall pole, in his hand, ran up to our modern Don Quixote, and gave him a blow acro&s;s his &s;houlders; which &s;o cooled his courage, that he &s;campered off <HI>Sans ceremonie.</HI> If I have in the above narrative of facts mi&s;ta|ted any circum&s;tance, I am willing to be cor|rected; but, I believe, there are too many living witne&s;&s;es in this city, to day, that will bear te&s;timony of the truth of what I have here related, with re&s;pect to mobs. And I am convinced, that upon a candid examination and enquiry, mobs will be as rarely met with, in other parts of the union, as in Philadelphia;
<PB N="10" REF="030155_0009_0FE4B04F9BB1A920">
&s;o that Porcupine, in&s;tead of ca&s;ting an odium on the friends of Republicani&s;m, has called forth an examination of facts, which recoil with di&s;honour upon the very heads of his &s;upporters.</P>
<P>With regard to the murders and outrages committed by the French nation; there are none who will believe a &s;ingle fact &s;tated by Porcu|pine, except credulous children, or prejudiced old women &s;inking into their dotage. To be|lieve that a nation &s;o enlightened as the French, "and always, &s;ays Mr. Bruce, foremo&s;t in the acts of benevolence and humanity," would tie men and women in pairs, and drown them by tens, and by fifties; nay even &s;ink boat loads of them, and thus wantonly &s;port with the lives of their fellow creatures, as Porcupine a&s;&s;erts, is what no man in his &s;en&s;es can ever believe. For calumny her&s;elf blu&s;hes at the exaggera|tion&mdash;humanity treats it as an in&s;ult&mdash;rea|&s;on and truth &s;purn the daring impo&s;ition &mdash;whil&s;t poor credulity is upon the rack. The implacable hatred, which Engli&s;hmen are known to entertain towards the French nation, ought to put every prudent man upon his guard; before he gives his a&s;&s;ent, to all tho&s;e Porcu|pine accounts of "horrid ma&s;&s;acres;" a man who is a declared enemy to the French revolu|tion, and the liberties of mankind in general. What confidence can we place in the veracity of a man, who would &s;it down and deliberate|ly tell the world, as Porcupine did, that there were two hundred gaming-tables kept in this
<PB N="11" REF="030155_0010_0FE4B05644F86A48">
city by Frenchmen?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If I am rightly informed, Porcupine will find, that one of his own countrymen kept the principal gambling table in town.</NOTE> John Fenno him&s;elf, who is not very remarkable for his mode&s;ty, when an opportunity offers of abu&s;ing the French nation, allows there were but about twenty; before they were expelled by the magi&s;tracy. By this fal&s;e a&s;&s;ertion, he endeavoured to ca&s;t a di&s;honourable reflection on the republican par|ty; but gamblers were never known to be the friends of a republican government. Tho&s;e French are well known to be men of ari&s;tocra|tic principles, the a&s;&s;ociates of Porcupine; who were expelled France, and the We&s;t-India I&s;lands for attempting to &s;ubvert the liberties of the people; and having no means of &s;up|porting them&s;elves they had recour&s;e to gam|bling. They are now bani&s;hed, and it is to be lamented, the corporation had not taken earlier &s;teps to have them puni&s;hed; before their vil|lainy produced tho&s;e evils it did. Exaggerat|ing their own prowe&s;s, and calumniating their enemies, are tricks, which the Briti&s;h govern|ment have been always known to practi&s;e, up|on their poor deluded &s;ubjects. He mu&s;t be very little acquainted with the Briti&s;h accounts of the American revolution, who does not ac|knowledge the truth of what is here advanced. For every battle they gained was magnified in|to a victory; and the American character was degraded, by them, to a level with the uncivil|ized Indian of the woods. With the He&s;&s;ians, in particular, they were &s;olicitous in repre&s;ent|ing
<PB N="12" REF="030155_0011_0FE4B057CE00FDD0">
the Americans, as a cruel, vindictive, and &s;avage people; in order to rou&s;e them to com|mit acts of wanton barbarity. And I have the authority of an Engli&s;h gentleman in &s;aying, that the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions are not yet entirely worn off his countrymen. Many people in England, who live remote from the &s;eaports and have but little means of information, believing to this day, that the citizens of the United States, are &s;carcely a degree removed above unciviliza|tion; and he a&s;&s;igned this as a rea&s;on, why &s;o few of the farmers, and labouring poor, emi|grate to this country.</P>
<P>That the French have gullotined, every man who was brought before their tribunals of ju|&s;tice, is no evidence of their cruelty and inju|&s;tice; but is the fulle&s;t proof of their lenity and forbearance; becau&s;e it was not until after their crimes became &s;o notorious, that even the &s;lighte&s;t doubt could not be entertained of their criminality, that they were brought before their tribunals; when the united voice of the people, and the pre&s;ervation of the republic, required their execution. Their condemnation was the re&s;ult of irre&s;i&s;tible nece&s;&s;ity, and not of choice, or wanton barbarity. The Repub|licans were forced into tho&s;e &s;anguinary mea|&s;ures, by the &s;tupid ob&s;tinacy of the royali&s;ts &mdash;an ob&s;tinacy which nothing could conquer but death.</P>
<P>That the accounts of ma&s;&s;acres, in France, publi&s;hed by Porcupine, Fenno, and Web&s;ter; are often fal&s;e and exaggerated, I can te&s;tify
<PB N="13" REF="030155_0012_0FE4B05956943A48">
upon the authority of &s;ome French citizens; men of education and principle, re&s;iding here. The&s;e gentlemen have frequently read, in the public papers, of per&s;ons being gullotined, who were actually living when they received their la&s;t accounts from France; and which was many months &s;ub&s;equent to the time, wherein it was &s;aid, that tho&s;e per&s;ons were executed. No doubt there have been many gullotined, in the cour&s;e of the revolution; but when the clouds of prejudice are di&s;&s;ipated, and an im|partial inve&s;tigation of all the facts, and cir|cum&s;tances, take place, relating to tho&s;e who &s;uffered under the&s;e &s;anguinary mea&s;ures; I am per&s;uaded, there will be but a &s;mall num|ber found among&s;t them, of the innocent and unoffending.</P>
<P>Although there be no principle of candour, truth and honour, which Porcupine has not violated, in his abu&s;e of the French nation; yet he is not alone cen&s;urable, for Mr. Hamil|ton has trodden the path before him. The lat|ter, in his writings, has endeavoured to prove, that it was not from di&s;intere&s;ted motives, France took an active part in the American revolution; but to pull down the enormous and overbearing pride, of England. Admitting this was the motive, which made France de|clare war again&s;t that power, this all men mu&s;t acknowledge, that if their motives in &s;erving us were not &s;o pure, as Mr. Hamilton wi&s;hes, they certainly loved us more than Great Bri|tain did; and if they loved us more, ought not
<PB N="14" REF="030155_0013_0FE4B05BDFEC1A98">
our gratitude to be in proportion to that love, in preference to Britain, as theirs was in pre|ference to us. Why then reject their overtures for entering into a treaty, both friendly and advantageous; and meanly crouching &s;olicit England to grant us one, which is equally in|jurious to our intere&s;t, as degrading to our na|tional dignity and honour? Although I believe univer&s;al benevolence and di&s;intere&s;ted friend|&s;hip, are found among&s;t mankind, in their pri|vate individual capacity; yet I could never learn from hi&s;tory, that they were ever found among&s;t monarchies. I am per&s;uaded Mr Ha|milton cannot produce, from hi&s;tory, one in|&s;tance of monarchies, whether ancient or mo|dern, being actuated towards each other; with that cordial attachment, as has been known to exi&s;t between Republics. What have we then to expect from our union with England? Has not experience already convinced us, that when her intere&s;t is concerned, every principle of ju&s;tice, of humanity, and the law of nations, are violated by her in their turn; to gratify her rapacious, haughty, and overbearing &s;pirit. To illu&s;trate what has here been &s;aid, with re|gard to the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of monarchies, let us take a general view of the kingdoms in Eu|rope, for a few years back. England, in the la&s;t Turki&s;h and Ru&s;&s;ian wars, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Turks privately, again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians; &s;he has &s;ince the commencement of the pre&s;ent revolution, entered into a triple alliance, with the Au&s;tri|ans, and Ru&s;&s;ians, again&s;t the Turks.

American revolution, Spain a&s;&s;i&s;ted France a|gain&s;t England, and in the pre&s;ent revolution &s;he a&s;&s;i&s;ted England again&s;t France; and it is univer&s;ally believed, if a general peace does not &s;oon take place, &s;he will join the French again&s;t the Engli&s;h. England has &s;ought &s;everal times for, and again&s;t, the Hollanders. Behold the haughty contemptible Victor Amadeus, king of Sardinia; who, not many months ago, &s;wore eternal enmity to the French republicans, late|ly upon his knees before the Executive Direc|tory, the very &s;ame republicans, like a di&s;obe|dient &s;nivling &s;chool-boy, a&s;king pardon for his former tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; and declaring, with the &s;ame lying tongue, with which he cur&s;ed them, that if they will pardon him his folly and pre&s;umption, he will, in future, be to them a faithful ally. It is more than probable the next account we receive from Europe, of this bigotted old monarch, is that he is marching the &s;hattered remains of his army again&s;t the Engli&s;h and Au&s;trians. Was it not, three years ago, equally as improbable, in the opinion of all Europe, that the king of Sardinia would a&s;k pardon of the National Directory, for his pre|&s;umption and folly; as that the idiot George the third, would three years hence, be upon his bended knees, begging of the National Di|rectory, in the &s;ame humiliating voice, forgive|ne&s;s of his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions? National pride, am|bition, folly, and intere&s;t, are the governing, and only motives, which actuate kings towards each other; and which give ri&s;e to all this ver|&s;atility

of conduct: For no man of common &s;en&s;e &s;urely will &s;ay, it was the effect of di&s;|intere&s;ted friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>But France, more enlightened and magnani|mous than all the re&s;t, gave America early proofs of her friend&s;hip; by entering into a treaty of amity and commerce, in the mo&s;t pe|rilous times, involving her&s;elf in a general war, at the hazard of loo&s;ing &s;ome of her mo&s;t valuable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. And to convince Ameri|ca, and the world, more fully; that her form|er &s;ervices were not the effect of a temporary, &s;ordid, &s;elfi&s;h intere&s;t; &s;he has &s;ince made over|tures for entering into a treaty anew; on prin|ciples the mo&s;t honourable, and flattering, to the national dignity of America, and advanta|geous to her intere&s;ts. But Mr. Hamilton, "&s;tiff in opinion always in the wrong," by his influence in the cabinet council of America, defeated her friendly de&s;igns; and rendered all her overtures abortive. Let us now admit, that France took an active part in the late re|volution from intere&s;ted motives; for we ad|mit it only, becau&s;e Me&s;&s;rs. Hamilton and Smith,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">S. Carolina.</NOTE> with all their contemptible quibbles, will never be able to prove it; until they con|vince the under&s;tandings of men, that France would have gone to war with England, at that period, independent of the &s;olicitations of A|merica. It is a fact, known to the whole world, that America &s;olicited the friend&s;hip and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of France, and that &s;he granted their re|que&s;t;
<PB N="17" REF="030155_0016_0FE4B0669D023560">
which was beyond all controver&s;y an act of friend&s;hip, if there be any &s;uch thing as friend&s;hip in this world. Hence it follows, from what we have admitted, that France was actuated by two motives, that is, a friend&s;hip for America, and a per&s;onal intere&s;t &s;he had in checking the domineering pride, and arrogance of England. This per&s;onal intere&s;t, and the independence of America, which was the na|tural con&s;equence of &s;uch a check, were the only objects the two countries had in view. In accompli&s;hing the&s;e, France being governed by two motives, it is certain, &s;he would act with a vigor proportioned to the force of tho&s;e motives&mdash;&s;he did &s;o; and American independ|ence was &s;ecured. Let me now a&s;k the ex-&s;e|cretary and his coadjutor, was there no friend|&s;hip in her &s;ending her armies, and her fleets, to fight our battles, both by &s;ea and land?&mdash;was there no friend&s;hip in her furni&s;hing our ar|mies, and our privateers, with ammunition, and arms; the only nece&s;&s;ary means of defence? &mdash;was there no friend&s;hip in her opening her ports, for the &s;ale of the prizes captured by our privateers?&mdash;was there no friend&s;hip in her &s;upplying our naked and defencele&s;s citizens, with her manufactures, the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;aries of life&mdash;and was there no friend in her opening her trea&s;ury, and lending us five million of dollars: were all the&s;e nothing? Speak thou demons of ingratitude and an&s;wer me.</P>
<P>Much has been &s;aid, by Mr. Hamilton in|directly, in his writings, again&s;t the French,
<PB N="18" REF="030155_0017_0FE4B0691E44DEF0">
about motives. The doctrine of motives is perhaps one of the mo&s;t ob&s;cure, and ambigu|ous, in nature. For an individual to attempt to pry into the feelings of mens heart's, in or|der to di&s;cover the &s;ecret &s;prings of actions which may there operate, is at once ab&s;urd, and pre&s;umptuous; it belongs to omni&s;cience only to view the motives, and &s;ecret &s;prings of action with men; and con&s;ider them accor|dingly. If I &s;olicit a favour of my neighbour, and he grants my reque&s;t; I want no more to complete my happine&s;s, &s;o far as the &s;upply of a &s;ingle want will render me happy. I am not to enquire, whether his motive in &s;erving me, was di&s;intere&s;ted, or not; admitting it was, in this ca&s;e, it is an imaginary good only; for be|fore we can pretend to di&s;cover what men's mo|tives are, the action mu&s;t either be re&s;olved up|on, or performed. It is not by motives we live, but by actions; and con&s;idering or judging of men's motives &s;ub&s;equent to their actions, will never feed the hungry, nor clothe the naked. If my neighbour renders me a &s;ervice, it is the mo&s;t certain proof which I could receive from him, that he entertains no hatred toward me; and if he entertains no hatred towards me, but renders me an e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice, what is he? is he not my friend? if he be not, I know not who is; I am apprehen&s;ive I will not find one in Mr. Ha|milton. Actions are to motives, what light is to the &s;un, were it not for them we could have no idea of men's motives, no more than we could have an idea of the &s;un, were it not for his
<PB N="19" REF="030155_0018_0FE4B06E294CCCB8">
light. Now to &s;uppo&s;e the &s;un an impure and opaque body, becau&s;e he diffu&s;es light, is not a greater ab&s;urdity, than to &s;uppo&s;e a man who is capable of friend&s;hip and of perform|ing a friendly action; is governed by ba&s;e and &s;elfi&s;h motives. If by &s;erving my friend, I &s;erve my&s;elf at the &s;ame time, am I to be cen|&s;ured as a &s;elfi&s;h intere&s;ted man, Mr. Ha|milton &s;ays yes,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If Mr. Hamilton does not expre&s;sly &s;ay &s;o, his writings admit no o|ther deduction.</NOTE> but I an&s;wer the con|trary, for if he, in con&s;equence of that cir|cum&s;tance, rejects my friend&s;hip, I will then con&s;ider him as the &s;urly dog&mdash;would neither &s;uffer me to do my&s;elf a kindne&s;s, nor would he receive one of my hands, becau&s;e I was in|directly &s;erving my&s;elf. Is he not the &s;elfi&s;h man, who would allow him&s;elf only to receive the good I would do? nay, is he not &s;omething wor&s;e than a &s;elfi&s;h man, who would deprive him&s;elf of that good, that he might al&s;o de|prive his benefactor, from rendering him&s;elf alike &s;ervice. A virtuous man will always re|joice, when he finds a two fold good re&s;ulting from an action; but according to Mr. Hamil|ton's rea&s;oning, becau&s;e a two fold good aro&s;e from the &s;ervice of the French, during the late revolution; that is, they procured the inde|pendence of America; whil&s;t they added to their own con&s;equence, in the balance of the European powers, we ought to treat them as a &s;elfi&s;h intere&s;ted nation. I repeat again, that a virtuous man will always rejoice, when
<PB N="20" REF="030155_0019_0FE4B070F5F0E620">
he finds a two fold good re&s;ulting from an ac|tion; but Mr. Hamilton and his coadjutor, &s;narl at it, and call the French a &s;elfi&s;h, wheed|ling, and intere&s;ted people. That a man of Mr. Hamilton's abilities, would advance &s;uch prepo&s;terous arguments, as he &s;o frequently does, in his writings, is to me the greate&s;t a|&s;toni&s;hment in life. For this &s;ingularity in him, I can find no better &s;olution, than the ob|&s;ervation of Mr. Duncan; &s;peaking, in his in|troduction to his logic, of the happy talent &s;ome men po&s;&s;e&s;s of unravelling, and throw|ing light upon, the mo&s;t intricate &s;ubjects; "others, &s;ays he, confound the ea&s;ie&s;t &s;pecu|lations, their under&s;tandings &s;eem to be form|ed awry, &amp;c." From what has been here ad|vanced upon the doctrine of motives, I am con|vinced every candid thinking man will ac|knowledge, that the conduct of the French nation towards America, during her &s;trug|gles for liberty, was highly honorable and friendly, and worthy of a magnanimous na|tion: or admitting &s;he was intere&s;ted, a two|fold good re&s;ulted to the world from her con|duct, during that period; and therefore ought not to le&s;&s;en, but doubly encrea&s;e, our grati|tude and e&s;teem. How unanimous were the citizens, &s;ix years ago, in declaring their &s;tea|dy and unfeigned attachment to that nation; they would have continued in the&s;e &s;enti|ments, had not Mr. Hamilton, like a mu&s;hroom of ye&s;terday, &s;tarted up and poi&s;oned their minds, by endeavouring to impre&s;s them with
<PB N="21" REF="030155_0020_0FE3F820EC2D3440">
the belief, that gratitude to the French nation was repugnant to their intere&s;t; this was the mean by which he collected all the men of &s;ordid principles in the union, and &s;everal la|dies, around him; they became his &s;teady friends, and the open avowed enemies of France. For there is no tie of gratitude, no principle of honour and virtue, which avari|cious men will not &s;acrifice, to accompli&s;h their &s;ordid views. It is a&s;&s;erted, upon good authority, that Mrs. Maginnis was among the number of tho&s;e ladies, which Mr. Hamilton let into the &s;ecrets of the funding &s;y&s;tem; whether this particular kindne&s;s to her, was owing to her &s;teady attention to him, in fur|ni&s;hing him always with a clean room, and a fre&s;h pullet; when he went to &s;up with her, is of no con&s;equence to the public. It is howe|ver well known, to all the gentlemen of the quill, at the different banks, that &s;he &s;peculat|ed largely; and has been enabled by her &s;pe|culations, and the bounty of her vi&s;itors, to re|tire on the fruits of her labour. Having &s;ince purcha&s;ed a &s;nug hou&s;e, a coach, a footman in genteel livery; &s;he now drives about the city in great &s;plendor, the warme&s;t advocate of Mr. Hamilton's mea&s;ures.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What a glorious proof, it is, of the purity of Mr. Hamilton's admi|ni&s;tration, when all the whores and ru&s;&s;ians, from New-Hamp&s;hire to Georgia, are become his advocates.

of gentlemen. What Doctor Charles Davenant &s;aid of a party that exi&s;ted in England in his time, may be al&s;o &s;aid, with great truth, of tho&s;e friends of Mr. Hamilton, whom avarice collected around him; "an ignorant, &s;ays he, mercenary, and &s;ervile crew; unanimous in evil; diligent in mi&s;chief, variable in princi|ples, con&s;tant to flattery, talkers for liberty; but &s;laves to power," &s;tiling them&s;elves fe|derali&s;ts, and the Pre&s;ident's only friends. From the influence Mr. Hamilton's writings has had, in giving a tinge to the American character, I am convinced it will render them the contempt, and &s;corn, of Europe. Have we not daily &s;triking proofs of my a&s;&s;ertion? have not the American citizens been treated with coldne&s;s by the French?&mdash;have they not been vexed, harra&s;&s;ed, and buffetted by the Engli&s;h? &mdash;and have not the Algerines, one of the weak|e&s;t and mo&s;t contemptible powers in that part of the globe, compelled us to purcha&s;e a trea|ty, at the enormous &s;um of twelve hundred thou&s;and dollars?</P>
<P>When we turn a&s;ide from viewing his con|duct towards the French&mdash;the manner in which it has influenced the public &s;entiment, to that nation; the only one from whom America could expect to receive real acts of friend&s;hip; and view his conduct with regard to the Uni|ted States internally, I am apprehen&s;ive, we will find as little cau&s;e of approbation and pa|nygeric. Let us therefore take a general view of his conduct, from the meeting of the feder|al

convention. In that enlightened body of patriots, for patriots they were, in compari&s;on to Mr Hamilton, we find him making a mo|tion for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a monarchial go|vernment; and when he failed, in his attempts, to get &s;uch a form introduced into the United States, he got offended, like a capricious &s;illy girl; and left the convention in a pout;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is generally under&s;tood, that when attached to the Pre&s;ident's hou&s;ehold, in the late revolution, he left it al&s;o in a pout; and that he is very much addicted to tho&s;e little girli&s;h poutings; for &s;hame colonel Ha|milton, once the great Financier General of America!</NOTE> for all his fine oratory was lo&s;t in a breath of air. How mortifying, mu&s;t it have been, to a man of his ambitious views and nice feelings to be thus early di&s;comfited, in his political career; and in an object too wherein he &s;eemed &s;o warmly intere&s;ted. However, he meditated re|venge, and he &s;ought for it. On finding the con&s;titution admitted great latitude of con|&s;tructive power, he returned to the convention and &s;igned the con&s;titution; but with &s;trong marks of di&s;approbation, declaring that he &s;ign|ed it only in con&s;equence of its ambiguity, in defining the powers of the different branches of government. The con&s;titution being now pub|li&s;hed, and &s;oon becoming popular; from the confidence the citizens placed in General Wa&s;h|ington, Doctor Franklin, and &s;ome others; Mr. Hamilton had no alternative, to pre&s;erve his popularity with the leading party, but to join, in conjunction with Mr. Madi&s;on,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It was not, until &s;ome time after, that the public were let into the &s;ecret, that Mr. Madi&s;on was concerned in writing the Federali&s;t: But Mr. Hamilton is not the only one who founded a reputation upon the merits of a mode&s;t man.</NOTE> and write

Having thus e&s;tabli&s;hed his reputation, as a man of abilities, and a warm federali&s;t, among&s;t the real friends of the con|&s;titution; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an in&s;inuating manner of addre&s;s, it procured him many friends; who were active in promoting his advancement, to the head of the trea&s;ury department, on the or|ganization of the con&s;titution. It was now, that he had the fulle&s;t opportunity of indulg|ing that revenge, which he meditated on &s;ign|ing the con&s;titution; by in&s;ulting the good &s;en&s;e of the citizens. No &s;ooner was he fixed in his office, than he endeavoured to introduce all the etiquette, bu&s;tle, noi&s;e and impertinence of royalty; by introducing levees, a courtly gazette, &amp;c. the latter under the direction of John Fenno, of pious memory; who &s;tuffed it occa&s;ionally with all the non&s;en&s;e, and empty &s;ound of royalty, &amp;c. Ju&s;t arrived in town, &s;ays Mr. Fenno, in his paper, the honourable Mr. &s;uch a one, &amp;c. Many thinking, &s;ober|minded citizens, became doubtful of Mr. Fen|no's outward piety, con&s;idering all this tra&s;h and non&s;en&s;e, as an in&s;ult offered to their un|der&s;tandings. His paper, in con&s;equence, lo&s;t its circulation; and to &s;ave his reputation, he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of changing it into a daily gazette; and depend on the &s;peculators, and a few governmental men, for its &s;upport. He inter&s;per&s;ed it occa&s;ionally, with &s;ome pi|ous &s;aying of &s;ome good old woman to the ea&s;tward, who, perhaps, &s;uffered under the martyrdom of witchcraft; probably his old

who of its friends will now &s;tep forward, and prove in what particular man|ner, it has been productive of general welfare; to the community at large? Experience, on the contrary, has convinced us; that there is no bank in the United States, more partial, limit|ted, and &s;elfi&s;h in its di&s;counts. The fact is, it has been conducted in &s;uch a manner as to a&s;|&s;i&s;t, and enrich a few governmental men; who neither care, in principle, for bank, or government; longer than either mini|&s;ter to the enlargement of their pecuniary circum&s;tances. The conduct of Porcupine, their champion, the other week to the tax-ga|therer, exhibits a &s;trong proof of the attach|ment of his party to government, when their pur&s;e is in que&s;tion. Although the bank has contributed to enrich a few, at the entire ne|glect of others, yet the evil is partial, in com|pari&s;on to tho&s;e ari&s;ing from the funding &s;y|&s;tem, a&s;&s;umption and exci&s;e laws. By the two former, Mr. Hamilton has rever&s;ed the origi|nal contract; and in &s;o doing, the United States have become re&s;pon&s;ible, for the pay|ment of &s;ome millions of dollars, more than they were by the original contract. This he has done, to enrich a few &s;ycophants, as rapa|cious as vultures, ever ready to prey upon the vitals of their country. To di&s;charge this enormous ma&s;s of national debt, it became nece&s;&s;ary to lay heavy taxes upon the people; among the&s;e, we find "a law laying duties upon &s;pirits di&s;tilled within the United States,

and upon &s;tills:" a law which is every way repugnant to the principles of a republic; it has grown, and flouri&s;hed, under the de&s;po|ti&s;m of monarchial governments only; where it required a military force to put it into ope|ration. But oppre&s;&s;ive taxes, and facility in encrea&s;ing the national debt, were not the on|ly objects Mr. Hamilton had in view; a mili|tary e&s;tabli&s;hment was wanting, as a key &s;tone to the arch. Michavel him&s;elf never invented &s;chemes, fraught with more cunning, and du|plicity; or more &s;ubver&s;ive of the liberties of a free people. By introducing an exci&s;e, he fore&s;aw, as there was no law within the reach of government, more di&s;cordant to the feelings of the citizens, and repugnant to the &s;pirit of a republic, that it would naturally meet with oppo&s;ition; hence would ari&s;e the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;tanding army, to &s;upport the dignity of govern|ment. But Mr. Hamilton's inordinate pa&s;&s;ion for a military e&s;tabli&s;hment, to perfect his &s;y&s;tem, heated his imagination too much; he fore&s;aw more than really happened.

Whil&s;t the negligence, or connivance of government, impre&s;&s;ed them with the be|lief, that it was feeble&mdash;wanting energy and firmne&s;s, to enforce obedience to its laws. Two powerful motives to induce a people, al|ready di&s;&s;atisfied, with other heightened mea|&s;ures of Mr. Hamilton's admini&s;tration, to be|come violent in their oppo&s;ition; to a law which was more particularly oppre&s;&s;ive on them, than on any other part of the union.

<P>From a pamphlet publi&s;hed this pre&s;ent year, by Moreau de St. Mery, on the pri&s;ons of Phi|ladelphia, which is now lying before me; I will be able to prove, to the honour of Iri&s;h|men, that Porcupine's &s;trictures upon the cha|racter of the Iri&s;h, who emigrate to this coun|try,
<PB N="34" REF="030155_0033_0FE4B09AC138CE20">
are fal&s;e; and can only ari&s;e from his invincible ignorance of facts, and national pride and &s;urline&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P><HI>The fact then to be proved, is, that there are few|er rogues, con&s;equently more hone&s;t men, emigrate to this country from Ireland, than England, in pro|portion to the whole number of emigrants.</HI> Moreau de St. Mery, in this pamphlet &s;tates, that du|ring the &s;pace of four years, ending June 1791, there were three hundred and twenty-one fo|reigners, under conviction in the pri&s;ons of Philadelphia; "among the&s;e, &s;ays he, two hundred and thirty-one were Iri&s;h, and eigh|ty-four Engli&s;h or Scotch;" and during the next four years, ending March 1795, con|tinues the above writer, "among the hundred and thirty-five &s;trangers, ninety-two are Iri&s;h, and nineteen Engli&s;h or Scotch." To prevent trouble, in the calculations, and deductions let us combine the two periods, which make a term of eight years; &s;o that the whole num|ber of Iri&s;h convicted during this term, is three hundred and twenty-three. There are twenty-&s;even hundred Iri&s;h arrive in this port every year. The data, upon which I found this cal|culation, are, that generally one year with another, five ve&s;&s;els &s;ail from the port of Lon|donderry, with pa&s;&s;engers, and four from Bel|fa&s;t; be&s;ides others from Newry, Killebegs, Donnegal, and &s;ome from Dublin, Limerick, Cork, and Sligo; but &s;eldom from the latter. The nine ve&s;&s;els, &s;ailing from Derry and Bel|fa&s;t, contain from two to four hundred pa&s;&s;en|gers
<PB N="35" REF="030155_0034_0FE4B0A3A98691C8">
each; &s;o that each ve&s;&s;el may be averaged at three hundred pa&s;&s;engers; this makes the whole number of emigrants, amount yearly to twenty-&s;even hundred; as I have &s;tated above. But if we go back in our calculations, to the four years &s;ub&s;equent to the peace in eighty-three, we will find that upwards of three thou&s;and emigrated each year, to this port, from Londonderry alone; and if we did ju&s;tice to our calculations and deduction, we would: becau&s;e a man, however rogui&s;h he may be inclined, will rarely commence thief, or robber on his fir&s;t arrival in a &s;trange coun|try; he mu&s;t remain an hone&s;t man for &s;ome time, until he becomes acquainted with the manners, and cu&s;toms of the people; the &s;i|tuation of the country; and above all, until he gets acquainted with others of his profe&s;|&s;ion. But I need not go &s;o far back, for proof, to convince the world, that the number of di&s;|hone&s;t men, who emigrate from Ireland to this country, is much le&s;s, in proportion to the whole number of emigrants, than either from England, or Scotland. I have already &s;hewn upon what data, I &s;uppo&s;e twenty-&s;e|ven hundred emigrate to this port yearly; which, in the &s;pace of eight years, amount to twenty-one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred; the num|ber of tho&s;e, who were convicted during that period, according to Moreau's &s;tatement, was three hundred and twenty-one, which are nearly as one is to &s;ixty-two.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="030155_0035_0FE4B0A5396DC070">Let us now &s;ee how the hone&s;ty of Engli&s;h|men, will bear to be analized, in like manner. It is &s;o generally known, I need &s;carcely repeat, that, for four years &s;ub&s;equent to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of peace in eighty-three, there were few or no Engli&s;hmen emigrated to this country; except &s;ome clerk, who were &s;ent, by their ma|&s;ters, into the &s;eaports, on &s;chemes of &s;pecula|tion. Many of tho&s;e gentlemen, have &s;ince fat|tened upon the &s;poils of the war-worn &s;oldier; as well as upon the labour, and indu&s;try of the un&s;u&s;pecting farmer. They now a&s;&s;ume a big-bellied con&s;equence, in our &s;treets, little inferior to a London alderman; who has been fed upon turtle-&s;oup, and calves heads. They may be known by an affected &s;neer, at every thing which is American; and a frothy in&s;o|lence in their looks; when they &s;ee a man, whom they &s;u&s;pect to po&s;&s;e&s;s le&s;s wealth than them&s;elves. In the eight years, de St. Mery has given us, of tho&s;e under condemnation in the pri&s;ons of Philadelphia; that is, from June 1787, to March 1795, there were not more Engli&s;h and Scotch, I am convinced, arrived in this port, to &s;ettle in the country, than one hundred each year, upon an average; which a|mount, in eight years, to eight hundred. The number of Engli&s;h convicted during that peri|od, I have already &s;tated, amounted to one hundred and three; the proportion, therefore, of the whole number of convicts, to the whole number of emigrants, is &s;omewhat more, than, as one is to eight. Hence it unque&s;tionably
<PB N="37" REF="030155_0036_0FE4B0A6CACEFBA8">
appears, that out of every &s;ixty-two, who emi|grated, from Ireland to the United States, one in the cour&s;e of eight years is convicted, for committing &s;ome offence again&s;t the laws of the &s;tate; whereas, out of every eight Engli&s;h|men who emigrated, one is convicted in the &s;ame &s;pace of time. To which I may add, without hazarding my reputation, as a candid writer, that there are generally five, or &s;ix &s;pe|culators or &s;windlers, arrive in our city every year from the different ports of England. The&s;e are generally &s;tiled d&mdash;d &s;mart fel|lows, but of whom the laws can take no cog|nizance; and who are perhaps, as pernicious to &s;ociety, and contribute as largely in cor|rupting the morals of our citizens, as the open|ly profane. The&s;e gentry appear to be fully acquainted with the maxim of a certain Qua|ker, who is well known, among the &s;peculating order; for a peculiar addre&s;s, and dexterity, he has in negociating all his tran&s;actions. Be|ing called to an account one day, by a gen|tleman for want of candour, in his dealings, Obediah replied with more warmth, than cau|tion; "friend, thee art mi&s;taken, thee needs not complain; I did not cheat thee, I only out|witted thee." From the foregoing deductions, which I have drawn from the mo&s;t unque&s;ti|onable data, it appears that if the &s;ame number of Engli&s;h, as of Iri&s;h, emigrated to this coun|try in the &s;ame &s;pace of time; there would be two thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-four convicted; whereas there are only 321 of the
<PB N="38" REF="030155_0037_0FE4B0A95159D948">
Iri&s;h; what a ble&s;&s;ing it is to the United States, that national pride, ignorance and prejudice keep them at home? Although fully &s;atisfied of having convinced the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate and prejudiced, as far, as well e&s;tabli&s;hed facts will do &s;o; that there are fewer rogues emigrate, to this country, from Ireland than from En|gland, nearly in a proportion as one is to eight. Yet if the whole number of Engli&s;hmen who were convicted, for committing offences a|gain&s;t the laws of the &s;tate, had been found innocent on their trials; &s;till there are a few of their countrymen, who have e&s;caped pu|ni&s;hment, by a &s;trange perver&s;ion of the laws, &mdash;have done more injury to &s;ociety, and have robbed the citizens of the United States of more property, than all the articles would a|mount to, that were &s;tolen by Iri&s;hmen &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of America. Among the&s;e I will mention two only, becau&s;e more would be unnece&s;&s;ary. Duer of New-York, it is well known, failed in one million five hundred thou&s;and dollars; it is al&s;o known that a great part of this he borrowed in five, ten, fifteen, twenty, &amp;c. dollars, as he could get them; from every fruit-woman, drayman, and car|ter. But if an Iri&s;hman, from want of edu|cation or from nece&s;&s;ity, robs a man of a cow or a hor&s;e; the whole nation mu&s;t be calum|niated by a contemptible wretch, as thieves and robbers. The other I will mention is Sta|bler, who failed in New-York, ran off to this city; and &s;oon after opened a large &s;tore, and
<PB N="39" REF="030155_0038_0FE4B0AF19D0BFD8">
as &s;oon after failed in forty thou&s;and dollars; and fled to Am&s;terdam.</P>
<P>And now let it be affirmed to the honor of Iri&s;hmen, that three-fourths of all the mer|chants, who turn bankrupts throughout the United States, are Engli&s;h and Scotchmen; although there are as many of the former merchants, as there are of the latter.</P>
<P>There is another circum&s;tance, which ought not to be concealed on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; as it affects the honor and hone&s;ty of Engli&s;h|men, in a very delicate point; its con&s;equen|ces are exten&s;ive in their operation, and bane|ful to &s;ociety; it ought therefore to receive publicity: I mean the counterfeiting the notes of the bank of the United States, and North A|merica. It is a truth, which the heads of the judiciary department of the &s;tate can te&s;tify, as well as the &s;heriff and goaler of Lanca&s;ter county; that there were an Engli&s;h man and woman tried, and convicted at Lanca&s;ter; for forging the notes of the&s;e two banks. This cir|cum&s;tance, with a combination of others, has thrown &s;uch light upon that affair; as will ju|&s;tify us in a&s;&s;erting, that there was a banditti of Engli&s;hmen and women di&s;per&s;ed over the United States; from New-Hamp&s;hire to Geor|gia, employed in counterfeiting, and pa&s;&s;ing the&s;e notes. It is a fact, known to all Europe, that the <HI>immaculate</HI> Pitt employed &s;everal men in counterfeiting French a&s;&s;ignats; but owing to the watchfulne&s;s of the national convention, few of them ever went into circulation: on
<PB N="40" REF="030155_0039_0FE4B0B19E5C3B68">
finding that he failed in his attempt to rai&s;e money, by his counterfeit a&s;&s;ignats, to carry on "a ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary war;" have we not the mo&s;t pre&s;umptive proof, that he turned his at|tention to counterfeiting the notes of the&s;e two banks? We all know, that the Briti&s;h counter|feited the paper currency of the United States, in the late revolution; and why not now the paper currency of the&s;e two banks? their ne|ce&s;&s;ities are greater now, than they were dur|ing the American war; and what faith, or mo|ral rectitude can we expect from a &s;et of cor|rupt unprincipled men, goaded on by nece&s;|&s;ity? Surely there is no barrier which national faith, honor, and ju&s;tice can erect, that &s;uch men will not break through and violate; to ac|compli&s;h their nefarious de&s;igns. And when we con&s;ider that the&s;e banks are &s;ituated in a more exten&s;ive, and larger trading town, than any other in the United States; their notes ha|ving therefore a more general and exten&s;ive circulation; is a circum&s;tance which renders them fit objects of Pitt's de&s;igns. To which if we add, that the&s;e counterfeits appeared &s;hort|ly after he had adverti&s;ed French a&s;&s;ignats for &s;ale, and was defeated in his attempts to get them into circulation; it gives additional force to the evidence. But there is one fact yet re|mains to be told, which mu&s;t remove the doubts of every man, and &s;ilence at once the clamours of the Briti&s;h faction. It is well known, to many citizens of Philadelphia, that at the time when Pitt publi&s;hed his counterfeit a&s;|&s;ignats,
<PB N="41" REF="030155_0040_0FE4B0B32646FB10">
there was an Engli&s;hman re&s;iding in this city of the name of Hancock; who had fled from London, &s;ome years before, for crimes alledged again&s;t him there; and for which he would, no doubt, have received a Tyburn elevation, had he been taken. About this time Hancock left this city for London; and &s;oon after return|ed with all the apparatus for coining dollars; and &s;everal copperplates, upon which were en|graved the counterfeit notes. He had &s;everal hundred copies &s;truck off the plates, in Lon|don; and brought over the bank-notes in &s;heets. Now to &s;uppo&s;e that Mr. Hancock, who is well known to be an accompli&s;hed villain, would be &s;o &s;tupid as to return to London, when con&s;cious of his guilt, and that certain death awaited him there, if he were detected, is improbable. It is a &s;uppo&s;ition that cannot be admitted, as there is not one circum&s;tance, except the man's &s;tupidity, which is not a cha|racteri&s;tic in him, that could ju&s;tify us in form|ing the &s;uppo&s;ition; &s;ince it is well known that there are &s;ome of his countrymen re&s;iding within the United States, fully capable of coun|terfeiting bank-notes; why then endanger his life, in returning to London, when all things might be as well accompli&s;hed here? It is evi|dent he mu&s;t have returned, under the autho|rity of Mr. Pitt, who employed him in di&s;|po&s;ing of the counterfeit notes; as Lord North did many of the old tories, who now a&s;&s;ume among&s;t us, no &s;mall degree of con&s;equence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hancock was detected and convicted in Lanca&s;ter, and an Iri&s;hman with him, who lent him his hou&s;e, and became the dupe of his villainy.

In their own way, nei|ther of them has left a path unexplored; in order to have his favorite principles adopted; one by &s;ophi&s;try, frequently of the &s;lighte&s;t texture, and an analogical method of rea&s;on|ing; which oftener leads men into error than any other. It is indeed the method chiefly practi&s;ed by &s;ophi&s;ts, as they frequently take for granted, that there is a likene&s;s between things; when there is none in nature. Who ever di&s;covered a likene&s;s between the Pre&s;i|dent of the United States, and the army; be|fore Mr. Hamilton attempted to exculpate the Pre&s;ident, from tho&s;e charges brought again&s;t him, by the "calm ob&s;erver?" Mr. Hamilton
<PB N="44" REF="030155_0043_0FE4B0BE91E99DF8">
takes for granted there is a likene&s;s between them, hence he concludes, as the army have often drawn more money out of the trea&s;ury; than the &s;pecific &s;ums appropriated by Con|gre&s;s, and tho&s;e at an earlier period; that the Pre&s;ident was al&s;o ju&s;tifiable in doing the &s;ame; which, in other words, is &s;aying that the Pre&s;ident's nece&s;&s;ities are equal to the ar|my's; for unle&s;s Mr. Hamilton proves this, which I think he will not attempt to prove, his deductions are all childi&s;h, and frivo|lous; and will never exculpate the Pre&s;ident in the public opinion. This vein of analo|gical rea&s;oning, is the ba&s;is of all Mr. Ha|milton's writings; and if one had time to analyze them, I am per&s;uaded, the greater part of them, as well as of tho&s;e where|in he prides him&s;elf mo&s;t, would tumble to the ground like a ba&s;ele&s;s fabric; for rea&s;on|ing by analogy is like building a hou&s;e upon a &s;andy foundation. But to illu&s;trate more fully Mr. Hamilton's method of rea&s;oning, let us &s;uppo&s;e him cro&s;&s;ing a field, at Albany, to &s;educe his neighbour's wife, or daughter; as it is &s;aid, he has a wonderful itching after other men's wives; and when he has gotten into one of the&s;e catterwalling moods, no he-cat is more la&s;civious; for rather than be di&s;ap|pointed, he would ru&s;h into the ebony arms of an African, provided &s;he had a hu&s;band. I &s;ay let us &s;uppo&s;e, that he is cro&s;&s;ing a field, and in his way meets a white pig; if he had never &s;een one before, what would be his me|thod
<PB N="45" REF="030155_0044_0FE4B0C01BDD9350">
of rea&s;oning on this occa&s;ion? not like an enlightened philo&s;opher, who would exa|mine if it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e properties, in com|mon, with the &s;pecies to which it belongs; or whether it was a variety only; but the fir&s;t idea, that would enter the mind of our analo|gical rea&s;oner, would be that of milk; if he were nece&s;&s;arily led to rea&s;on on the properties of the pig, he would proceed thus, "milk is white, and we all know it is nutritive; there|fore it mu&s;t be good to make men go a catter|walling. The pig is white, it mu&s;t con&s;equent|ly po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame properties; I will therefore make a funding &s;y&s;tem of it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the funding &s;y&s;tem has not &s;et men a catterwalling, it has certain|ly &s;et many a beggar upon hor&s;eback.&mdash;The above rea&s;oning is not more ab&s;urd, than the rea&s;oning of Mr. Hamilton, in &s;upport, that "a public debt is a public ble&s;&s;ing."</NOTE> Among the va|rious bonds of union which direct men's under|&s;tandings, to a&s;&s;ociate their ideas, re&s;emblance is one; and I believe there are few who po&s;|&s;e&s;s that a&s;&s;ociating quality in a higher degree, than Mr. Hamilton; like an <HI>ignus fatuus,</HI> he bewilders us in the multiplicity of his ideas; hence he has been very ju&s;tly &s;tiled "the long winded Pacificus."</P>
<P>But Porcupine is a writer of a different ca&s;t from Mr. Hamilton; although their princi|ples, and the object they have in view, are preci&s;ely the &s;ame, the di&s;credit of republican|i&s;m; yet they pur&s;ue roads widely different. Porcupine more bold, and adventurous; but le&s;s artful, and de&s;igning; like a head &s;trong &s;tubborn hor&s;e, that runs off with his rider,
<PB N="46" REF="030155_0045_0FE4B0C2A3984E00">
he da&s;hes through mud and mire, making the dirt fly in all directions. If truth he in his way, he be&s;mears it with calumny and fal&s;e|hood; for he has on every occa&s;ion fully &s;hewn, that no truth, however &s;acred, he will re&s;pect. There is no calumny too gro&s;s, no fal&s;ehood too glaring and ab&s;urd; for this hireling to practi&s;e, as weapons, in butchering the man's reputation, who is oppo&s;ed to him in princi|ple. And when he has calumniated him to|day, he will return to it to-morrow with the &s;ame eagerne&s;s, that a dog would to his vomit.</P>
<P>But let us return to Mr. Swanwick, of whom I am ju&s;tifiable in a&s;&s;erting, that if he acquits him&s;elf, in his political capacity, as an hone&s;t man; his con&s;tituents will never enquire, whe|ther he &s;ent a piece of poetry to the editor of a London magazine, for publication, or not: or whether he has his hou&s;e ornamented with paintings, bu&s;ts, and &s;tatues;&mdash;that he has ac|quitted him&s;elf to the entire &s;atisfaction of his con&s;tituents, Porcupine will not attempt to de|ny. But if he has &s;ent a piece of poetry, acro&s;s the atlantic for publication, is that any proof of his vanity? common &s;en&s;e &s;purns the idea. If &s;uch a thing be a proof of a man's vanity, how many vain men will we find among&s;t mankind? I could here, were it nece&s;&s;ary, name &s;everal; who, if they did not &s;end po|etry, &s;ent other works for publication; yet who ever thought, before Porcupine, that &s;uch a circum&s;tance con&s;tituted a vain man? Porcupine critici&s;es upon this poetry, but
<PB N="47" REF="030155_0046_0FE4B0C91CA0C7F8">
Mr. Swanwick may reply to him with the &s;ame ju&s;tne&s;s of thought, that Hanibal repli|ed to the philo&s;opher; who had the folly and pre&s;umption, to di&s;cant before him upon the principles of war. "Of all the &s;illy old men, &s;ays Hanibal, that I ever heard talk, thou art the &s;illie&s;t." I need not a&s;k the reader, whe|ther Hanibal or the philo&s;opher was the vaine&s;t man; neither need I a&s;k him, whether Mr. Swanwick or Porcupine is the vaine&s;t man. Porcupine critici&s;es upon Mr. Swanwick's poe|try, like the vain philo&s;opher upon the princi|ples of war; without having had any experi|ence, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing one of the nece&s;&s;ary qualifi|cations of a warrior. And Porcupine critici&s;es upon Mr. Swanwick's poetry, without po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing one of the nece&s;&s;ary qualifications of a critique; except his ill-nature. Porcupine urg|es al&s;o, becau&s;e Mr. Swanwick has his hou&s;e ornamented with paintings, bu&s;ts and &s;tatues; he mu&s;t therefore be a vain man. If he had reflected, for fifty years, and as many centu|ries, provided he out-lived that period, for a fact or an argument to prove a man to be vain, he could not have brought forward one more prepo&s;terous. Tho&s;e things are evidently a proof of Mr. Swanwick's love of the arts; and in this opinion, I believe, every &s;en&s;ible man will coincide with me; for if we judge of cau|&s;es by their effects, we can draw no other con|clu&s;ion. By purcha&s;ing tho&s;e things does he not reward the labour of the arti&s;t? he who rewards the labour of the arti&s;t, gives encou|ragement
<PB N="48" REF="030155_0047_0FE4B0CAA79433C0">
to the art it&s;elf; and he who encou|rages the art mu&s;t love it. How &s;imple and ea&s;y it is for men to rea&s;on, when they have truth on their &s;ide, and candour to acknow|ledge it. If every man would act their part, in that re&s;pect, as well as Mr Swanwick; the arts would not langui&s;h in this country, &s;o long in their infancy, as they do. But men's minds are too much ab&s;orpt in &s;peculation, and pecunia|ry aggrandizement, to admit a ta&s;te &s;ufficiently refined to reli&s;h them. Why then cen&s;ure a man for contributing his &s;hare, to the encou|ragement of tho&s;e arts; which enlightened ages and nations have approved? nay more, it was owing to the encouragement that the arts met with in tho&s;e times; which make future writ|ers apply to them, the appellation of an en|lightened age, or enlightened people. Why do we call the Indians an uncivilized people? it is not becau&s;e they po&s;&s;e&s;s fewer of the &s;ocial, and dome&s;tic virtues than we do; for travellers all agree, that the&s;e they fulfill with more warmth, than even the pious folks of New-En|gland; if we except bundling, as we have not yet learned, whether that &s;ocial virtue has been introduced among&s;t them. It is not becau&s;e they po&s;&s;e&s;s le&s;s moral hone&s;ty, than is found a|mong&s;t Porcupine's friends; for travellers agree al&s;o, that among&s;t them are found no brokers, no &s;peculators, no &s;tock and land-jobbers; nor have they yet di&s;covered, notwith&s;tanding &s;e|veral years re&s;idence among&s;t them, one in|&s;tance of mercantile fraud and meanne&s;s. But
<PB N="49" REF="030155_0048_0FE4B0CC35889ED0">
it is alone from the circum&s;tance of their hav|ing no reli&s;h for the arts, and &s;ciences; that we apply to them the degraded appellation, of "an uncivilized people." Why then, in the name of heaven! &s;hould we accu&s;e a man of vanity, for encouraging tho&s;e things; by which we acquired the honourable appellation of "a civilized people?" But what lengths, will not envy and malice go: when determined upon murdering a man's reputation The &s;ame ma|lice and envy, which per&s;ecute Mr. Swanwick to-day; per&s;ecuted Mr. Nichol&s;on for nine long years in this city; his political &s;entiments did not harmonize with a certain party; and he was treading the path, to acquire a fortune, by which he was likely to obtain a pre-emi|nence over them; as far as riches will do &s;o, in a free country. They were like the &s;urly dog in the manger, who could not eat the hay him&s;elf; neither would they &s;uffer Mr. Ni|chol&s;on, to obtain a fortune; as far as their malignant influence could go, in preventing it. But when he had acquired that fortune, which was the &s;ole object of his wi&s;hes; and which he pur&s;ued with the mo&s;t unremitted exertion, and indu&s;try; he then changed his political &s;entiments, turned his back on his old friends; and became the rallying-point of almo&s;t all the land-jobbers, and &s;peculators, throughout the United States, Since that time they have taken him into their bo&s;oms, and &s;ome of them even now court his friend&s;hip. We do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> that party accu&s;e him, to day, of a &s;ingle

I would a&s;k any man of &s;en&s;e, and candour&mdash;for it is only to &s;uch men I wi&s;h to &s;peak on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, is Mr. Nichol&s;on an hone&s;ter man to-day, than he was &s;ix years ago, or is he le&s;s vain? I &s;uppo&s;e the next charge, brought again&s;t Mr. Swan|wick, by Porcupine; is, that he is a vain man, becau&s;e he eats&mdash;he drinks, and &s;leeps; for the&s;e he may repeat to-morrow. "The &s;hort man from Philadelphia," what ingenuity of thought! who would have believed their own eyes, on &s;eeing Mr. Swanwick, that he was a man of moderate &s;ize; if the humourous, the witty, and ingenuous Porcupine had not told us? What a happy di&s;covery!</P>
<P>Had antient biographers and hi&s;torians, been as particular in tran&s;mitting to us; the &s;ize, figure, and tone of voice, of their re&s;pective heroes, as Porcupine is in handing Mr. Swan|wick's down to futurity; what a glare of light would it have diffu&s;ed upon their hi&s;tories? For he &s;eems to in&s;inuate that the capacity of men's minds, ought to be mea&s;ured by the bulk of their bodies. The ob&s;ervation exact|ly contains as much profoundne&s;s of thought, and good &s;en&s;e; as one made by the learned Doctor Belknap, in his hi&s;tory of New-Hamp|&s;hire. Speaking of the climate of that &s;tate, and the coldne&s;s of the winter &s;ea&s;on; the Doctor profoundly tells us, that this is the time, "when nature teaches the hens to &s;et on

the cow's back, to keep their feet warm."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. III. page 19.</NOTE> Heavens! who would have thought? if the learned Doctor had not told us, that the hens of New-Hamp&s;hire po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o much &s;agacity. I &s;uppo&s;e a Virginia, or an Iri&s;h hen, would be &s;uch a &s;tupid, &s;illy devil; as to run in a cold day, and &s;et her&s;elf down upon a &s;heet of ice, or a heap of &s;now. But if the hens of New-Hamp&s;hire po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o much &s;agacity, how much more mu&s;t the learned Doctor po&s;&s;e&s;s? he would never have thought, I pre&s;ume, of &s;etting him&s;elf down upon a cow's back, in a cold day, to keep his feet warm, had not the hens put him in mind of it; nay, I am per|&s;uaded, he would prefer to &s;it by a good fire; for certainly it is no uncommon thing, to find a learned Doctor &s;itting by a plea&s;ant fire, in a cold day, in preference to a cow's back; which unque&s;tionably proves, that a Doctor in divinity as well as Porcupine, may po&s;&s;e&s;s more &s;agacity than a hen.</P>
<P>While I am thus &s;peaking of the &s;agacity of hens, and doctors in divinity; it brings to my recollection, the author of "the American U|niver&s;al Geography;" who has lately been crowned with the ari&s;totelian cap. This geo|graphic divine &s;peaking of the political di&s;|&s;entions which prevailed in New-Hamp&s;hire, re&s;pecting the adoption of the federal con&s;titu|tion, brings in the following argument to prove, that the delegates to the &s;tate conven|tion, who had received in&s;tructions from their
<PB N="52" REF="030155_0051_0FE4B0D7F28A3F68">
con&s;tituents, were not in duty bound to obey them. "Although, &s;ays this learned &s;on of Ari&s;totle, the in&s;tructions of con&s;tituents can|not, on the true principles of repre&s;entation, be binding upon a deputy in any legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly, becau&s;e his con&s;tituents are but a part of the &s;tate, and have not heard the ar|guments and objections of the whole, where|as his act is to affect the whole &s;tate." I would a&s;k Mr. Mor&s;e, what are the majority in any legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly? are they not a part? but &s;ays Mr. Mor&s;e, "a part ought not to govern;" a majority being a part, (for it is evident that a majority of the towns might have given in|&s;tructions) therefore they ought not govern, according to his mode of rea&s;oning. A doc|trine &s;ubver&s;ive of every principle of true re|publicani&s;m.

<P>The di&s;po&s;ition of the New England clergy, to get them&s;elves interwoven into the govern|ment of their re&s;pective &s;tates; is manife&s;t up|on every important, political que&s;tion; which comes before the public. It is a well known fact that the clergy of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, once held the reins of that government; and &s;ince they have been ou&s;ted by the good &s;en&s;e of the citizens, they have not cea&s;ed to gra&s;p at every opportunity; whereby they might regain their antient unlimitted power, over the rights and con&s;ciences of the citizens. Does not this exactly corre&s;pond with the part,
<PB N="54" REF="030155_0053_0FE4B0DC09C2A840">
which many of the New-England clergy have acted, upon a late important que&s;tion? In &s;up|port of my a&s;&s;ertion generally, I have only to appeal to the writings of Mr. Mor&s;e, wherein he &s;ays, that the very democratical govern|ment of Connecticut, is counterbalanced by the ari&s;tocracy of the clergy. We know then, that the intere&s;ts of ari&s;tocracy and democra|cy are diametrically oppo&s;ite; and when &s;uch intere&s;ts exi&s;t in a &s;tate, they mu&s;t naturally create di&s;&s;ention among its citizens; but we hear of no &s;uch di&s;&s;ention among the citizens of Connecticut; for the ari&s;tocracy of the cler|gy, like a &s;low poi&s;on in the human body, has paralized the democratical part and rendered it merely nominal. The clergy of the ea&s;tern &s;tates are like tho&s;e women, who are more re|markable for &s;ubtilty, than candour; and who through principles of cunning and artifice, go|vern their &s;illy hu&s;bands, without letting them know that they are governed. When a certain divine per&s;onage, at who&s;e name every knee ought to bend, and the tongue of clamour cea&s;e, was a&s;ked by one of tho&s;e brothers; who thought him&s;elf unju&s;tly dealt with, in regard to his patrimonial e&s;tate, what he &s;hould do? "Man, replied the Son of God, who made me a judge?" giving him to under&s;tand that car|nal, or worldly affairs; were foreign to the true &s;pirit, and intention of his mi&s;&s;ion. And when others, to try the political &s;entiments of the &s;ame divine per&s;onage, pre&s;ented him with a piece of &s;ilver; and after being informed that
<PB N="55" REF="030155_0054_0FE4B0E496F5DA78">
the image and &s;uper&s;cription it bore, were Cae|&s;ar's; he declined all interference in political matters, by giving them the following eva&s;ive an&s;wer; "render, &s;ays he, unto Cae&s;ar, the things that are Cae&s;ar's." Are not tho&s;e circum|&s;tances which directly and unequivocally prove, that the Chri&s;tian religion, in its purity, does not admit clergymen interfering in political concerns. Hence we are no longer &s;urpri&s;ed, to find clergymen of ambitious views and mer|cenary principles, attempting to prove that the &s;ervant ought not to obey his ma&s;ter. Bet|ter &s;uch clergymen would relinqui&s;h, at once, their clerical functions; than longer pervert the precepts of Chri&s;tianity, by making them &s;ub&s;ervient to their mercenary purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Porcupine's critici&s;ms, on Mr. Swanwick's poetry, are not the only in&s;tance we have of his vanity and ill nature. The illiberal and vulgarly manner which he has treated Tele|machus, a work of the celebrated Fenelon, in a French grammar he publi&s;hed &s;ome time a|go in this city, is di&s;gu&s;ting to the feelings of every man, who regards virtuous and enlight|ened men, as the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing and orna|ment to &s;ociety. Of this work, which Porcu|pine treats with contempt and ridicule, a writ|er highly e&s;teemed for his candour and good &s;en&s;e, &s;peaks in the following manner; "no work, &s;ays he, ever had a greater reputation; the &s;tile of it is lively, natural and beautiful; the fictions well contrived; the moral &s;ublime; and the political maxims all tending to the
<PB N="56" REF="030155_0055_0FE4B0E61F300240">
happine&s;s of mankind." But Porcupine, in contempt of the univer&s;al opinion of mankind, ridicules this work; and calls Telemachus a &s;imple fellow. Why? becau&s;e he would not go to bed to Calyp&s;o, who was in love with him. Gracious God! that a man would be &s;o lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of decency, and moral &s;enti|ment, as to call another "a &s;imple fellow;" becau&s;e he would not pro&s;titute him&s;elf, and indulge his brutal appetites; at the expence of innocence and virtue. This is uniformly the method, which men of vicious habits endea|vour to propagate their nefarious principles; by ridiculing virtue, and innocence; for if they could get men to be once a&s;hamed of their in|nocence, and virtue; they were then &s;ure of &s;ucceeding. When we view Porcupine him|&s;elf in the character of a &s;educer, we are no longer &s;urpri&s;ed to find him ridiculing Telema|chus, as "a &s;imple fellow." When we behold him inveigling an innocent girl, not more than &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen years, from her aged pa|rents&mdash;their only remaining blo&s;&s;om&mdash;and la&s;t be&s;t hope; when we con&s;ider him breaking the ties of parental affection, and filial duty; exci|ting animo&s;ity between parent and child; our wonder cea&s;es when we find him endeavouring to excite animo&s;ity, between the citizens of the ea&s;tern and the &s;outhern &s;tates. When we view him giving an aged parent occa&s;ion to exclaim, in the bitterne&s;s of his heart, "If I am bereft of my only daughter, I am bereft!" What pa|rent of &s;en&s;ibility, who has a daughter; or what

brother of &s;en&s;ibility, who has a &s;i&s;ter; that would not be rou&s;ed with indignation, at re|flecting on &s;uch circum&s;tances? Are the tears and &s;ighs of an aching heart&mdash;a bereft parent, unworthy of our notice! is female happine&s;s of no con&s;ideration among&s;t men, that we &s;hould pa&s;s it over in &s;ilence!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In an&s;wer to the foregoing we have only to ob&s;erve, that it was ge|nerally believed, by tho&s;e who were intimate at the hou&s;e where Porcu|pine lodged, on his arrival, that he had &s;educed the girl who lived with him as his wife: they believed, and &s;aid &s;o, but upon what authority I never enquired.</NOTE> When we moreover con&s;ider him abu&s;ing the archbi&s;hop of Cambray, and Doctor Franklin; two of the mo&s;t enlightened men of their age; it confirms us in our belief, that his writings tend to the &s;ubver&s;ion of all tho&s;e principles; upon which re&s;t the peace, happine&s;s, and well-being of &s;o|ciety.</P>
<P>The archbi&s;hop of Cambray believed and &s;upported the being of a Deity, and the Chri|&s;tian religion; Porcupine &s;ays, that Doctor Franklin a deity only, and moral rectitude.

Taking a general view of the princi|ples of mankind, &s;o far as they relate to reli|gion, we are naturally led to divide them in|to three cla&s;&s;es; tho&s;e who believe in a Su|preme Being and a Redeemer, are &s;tiled Chri|&s;tians; tho&s;e who believe in a Supreme Being alone, and the fitne&s;s of moral actions to pro|cure eternal happine&s;s, are &s;tiled Dei&s;ts; and tho&s;e who believe as neither of the former,
<PB N="58" REF="030155_0057_0FE4B0E93081B980">
are &s;tiled Athei&s;ts. Porcupine ridicules Doctor Franklin's principles in the &s;illie&s;t manner, without refuting them; now if he ridicules the principles of a Dei&s;t, and laughs at the principles of a Chri&s;tian? what inference can we draw? but that he is him&s;elf an Athei&s;t; and if to this conclu&s;ion, which I think every man of candour will acknowledge to be ju&s;t, we add the contempt he has &s;hewn for the Chri&s;tian religion, by not attending any of its public in&s;titutions; for who ever &s;aw Por|cupine at a religious a&s;&s;embly in this city? it mu&s;t confirm every man's belief, that Por|cupine is an Athei&s;t in the fulle&s;t latitude of the word. I have taken for granted, all this time, on the authority of Porcupine, that Doctor Franklin was a Dei&s;t; a man of can|dour and an enlightened under&s;tanding, will never make an a&s;&s;ertion, which he cannot &s;up|port by &s;ome fact, or fair deduction; but what proof has Porcupine brought forward, that will lead us to believe, that Doctor Franklin's principles were dei&s;tical; &s;urely not one, that would induce a credulous child to believe &s;o. He has brought forward the here&s;ay of an en|venomed old man; who is univer&s;ally known to entertain an irreconcileable hatred, to the memory of Doctor Franklin; becau&s;e he took &s;uch an active part in the late revolution; well may we apply to him, on this occa&s;ion, the &s;aying of a celebrated writer; "as bad as men are, they dare not appear to be the ene|mies of virtue, and when they re&s;olve to per|&s;ecute
<PB N="59" REF="030155_0058_0FE4B0EFC16B9DF0">
it, they pretend to believe it fal&s;e, or lay &s;ome crime to its charge." I repeat again, that Porcupine has not adduced one &s;enti|ment of the Doctor's of a dei&s;tical tendency; only the malignant a&s;per&s;ions of a turbulent old man, who is more remarkable for his bankrupt&s;ies, and clamorous di&s;po&s;ition; than for candour, fair dealing, and a de&s;ire of &s;eek|ing after truth. But I have produced both &s;entiments and actions of Porcupine; from which I have, by the faire&s;t deduction, pro|ved him to be an Athei&s;t. For if we believe in a deity, the immortality of the &s;oul, and in future rewards and puni&s;hments; in which no Athei&s;t ever believed; To obtain tho&s;e future rewards, there can be only the following prin|ciples of general conduct; that is we mu&s;t ei|ther believe in the merits of a Redeemer and moral actions, which are always the con&s;e|quence of &s;uch a belief; or in the fitne&s;s of moral rectitude alone, to procure us tho&s;e fu|ture rewards; now he who ridicules and laughs at men for believing and practi&s;ing one or other of the&s;e general principles; cannot be &s;aid to believe, or practi&s;e either him&s;elf; and if he neither believes, nor practi&s;es either, it is then &s;elf evident, he mu&s;t be an Athei&s;t. For it would be prepo&s;terous, in the extreme, to &s;uppo&s;e a man would treat with contempt and ridicule tho&s;e &s;acred principles of action in o|thers, which mark the general tenor of his own conduct. Before we attempt to ridicule a thing, we mu&s;t remove from it all tho&s;e ideas of &s;a|credne&s;s,
<PB N="60" REF="030155_0059_0FE4B0F2451D0D30">
which we formerly con&s;idered attach|ed to it.</P>
<P>In his "Scare Crow," he quotes the follow|ing pa&s;&s;age out of Doctor Franklin's will, to prove him an ari&s;tocrat; notwith&s;tanding the &s;ervices he rendered his country, and the cau&s;e of liberty, and &s;cience in general. "I bequeath, &s;ays the Doctor, to my worthy friend George Wa&s;hington, my gold-headed cane, &s;ur|mounted with a liberty cap: if it were a &s;cep|tre he is worthy of it." Porcupine then makes the following remark; "after all the Doctor's clamour again&s;t kings, he thought a &s;ceptre &s;omething more than a liberty cap." But, I an&s;wer, it was directly the rever&s;e; it was not owing to any e&s;timation the Doctor held a &s;ceptre in; but being well convinced, that Ge|neral Wa&s;hington always entertained a wo|mani&s;h longing after a &s;ceptre; which made him u&s;e that &s;oothing expre&s;&s;ion. It &s;hews the Doctor's goodne&s;s of heart, that he wi&s;hed to part in peace with all mankind; and give cau&s;e of chagrin to none. In&s;tead of proving, that the Doctor held a &s;ceptre in higher e&s;timation than a liberty cap, it proves only, that Gene|ral Wa&s;hington always held it in higher e&s;ti|mation; for is it not &s;elf-evident, that if the Pre&s;ident entertained an antipathy towards a &s;ceptre, or viewed it as a contemptible bauble; and the Doctor, under the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, offered him his cane, by &s;aying, "Sir, if it were a &s;ceptre, you are worthy of it;" would not &s;uch conduct be &s;omething
<PB N="61" REF="030155_0060_0FE4B0F3CCFAE810">
like irony? would it not be degrading the pre|&s;ent in the Pre&s;ident's opinion, and directly in|&s;ulting his feelings? Porcupine further ob|&s;erves, that "poor Richard (Doctor Franklin) certainly de&s;erves to be tumbled from his niche, for his dying confe&s;&s;ion;" becau&s;e he di&s;covered to the world the Pre&s;ident's fondne&s;s for a &s;ceptre; "and I tru&s;t, continues Porcu|pine, when the day of retribution comes he will not be forgotten;" the above pa&s;&s;age of this <HI>humane</HI> hireling needs but little comment; it fully &s;hews of it&s;elf to what &s;avage lengths, his party would extend their per&s;ecutions if they dared&mdash;that they would even wreak their feeble vengeance, upon a &s;en&s;ele&s;s block of marble. This is the generous&mdash;the immacu|late hero, who fir&s;t accu&s;es, and then condemns the French nation; for a crime which he threatens to put into execution, when a &s;uita|ble opportunity will offer. Would it not be well for the corporation, to take notice of him; before his helli&s;h malice may tempt him to de|face, that beautiful &s;tatue? Surely threats are as cognizable in law, as real crimes: No doubt his good old friend, Mr. Olden, would &s;pare time from his private di&s;counting, to go before a magi&s;trate and pledge &s;ome of his dirty acres, as a &s;ecurity for his good behaviour. But &s;till the magi&s;tracy ought to a&s;&s;ert their dignity; and be a &s;afeguard to the works of genius, as well as to that property which is too often ac|quired by fraud, and &s;peculation.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="030155_0061_0FE4B0F55606B7B8">I have already adduced arguments and facts, &s;ufficient to convince the mo&s;t prejudiced, that Porcupine is neither a Chri&s;tian, nor a moral man. But the following fact, e&s;tabli&s;hes be|yond all controver&s;y, the impiety of this wretched &s;cribbler. In his Cen&s;or of May, page 189, &s;peaking of Mr. Swanwick, he advi|&s;es, with the mo&s;t unblu&s;hing effrontery, the ladies of Philadelphi to go, and "even &s;&mdash; him:" mon&s;trous ob&s;cenity! a&s;&s;uring them at the &s;ame time, by a &s;olemn oath, that "they need not apprehend any mi&s;chief." Heavens! what an incitement does he offer to vice! What &s;hall we in future think of this hireling's mo|de&s;ty, morality and di&s;cretion? How long will he be &s;uffered to pa&s;s with impunity? I have not the lea&s;t doubt, were he in London, but he could ea&s;ily get &s;ome cockneigh wench, to act that vile abominable part: But &s;ure I am that the American women, though the Yankees may bundle, have not yet become &s;o lo&s;t to e|very &s;en&s;e of mode&s;ty and virtue; as that he could even find one among Mrs. Maginnis's girls &s;o abandoned. When William Penn was tracing out his beloved city of Philadelphia,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> Crow.</NOTE> if any one had told him, that the time would come, when one of his own countrymen would have the canine impudence; for to advi&s;e the ladies of Philadelphia, in many of who&s;e veins his own blood was trickling, to pro&s;titute them|&s;elves; I much que&s;tion if the good old man, though a Quaker, would not have &s;aid "that

"Fellow, thee art a d &mdash;d confounded liar." Poor old man! he little dreamed what was to happen, about the clo&s;e of the eighteenth century; but William was no dreamer&mdash;he knew how to employ his time to more advantage. He would rather be giv|ing &s;trings of beads, and old hor&s;e &s;hoes to the Indians for their lands; than &s;itting up in his great armed chair dreaming about the di&s;|cord, which Porcupine and his a&s;&s;ociate Ben Davis, would endeavour to excite, among the peaceable citizens, by their lies and calumnies. What a golden age! when men with a little religious artifice, on the tip of their tongues; and a few &s;trings of beads and old hor&s;e &s;hoes, could purcha&s;e land in any quantity. What pity &s;ome of our pre&s;ent monopolizers, had not lived in tho&s;e days of beads, and old hor|&s;es &s;hoes; in&s;tead of giving hard dollars for their lands, or mortgaging their property to &s;ave their credit; they would have nothing more to do, but to order their &s;ervant to pull off an old &s;hoe off one of their hor&s;es feet, or take a &s;tring of beads from little Mi&s;s Polly; pay for their lands, and lift their notes. The &s;treets of our city would not then be &s;o croud|ed, with the pious hor&s;e-&s;tealers from Connec|ticut; gathering up every bit of old iron they

could find. But in&s;tead of them we would &s;ee Me&s;&s;rs.

Why not? when it would pay for their lands, and prevent them from mortgaging one part to &s;ave the o|ther. The beautiful and all-accompli&s;hed Mr. G&mdash;f, with his ro&s;y cheeks, would not then be under the dire nece&s;&s;ity of purcha&s;ing India mu&s;lins, on &s;ecurity and long credit, from a certain mercantile hou&s;e in this city; and &s;end them the next day to vendue, to &s;ell for what they could bring. His matrimonial attach|ment prevents him from returning to Am&s;ter|dam, to renew his &s;peculations there; for it is &s;aid, when there, that he loved with all the <HI>ar|dor</HI> of a Ru&s;&s;ian. Neverthele&s;s, I will venture to affirm, that his Am&s;terdam &s;peculation was the be&s;t he ever made; be this as it may, it is pretty generally under&s;tood, that a certain bru|nette has often exclaimed with a heavy heart, in the language of one of Dryden's females, "our thoughtle&s;s giddy &s;ex, is caught by out|ward form, and empty noi&s;e, and lo&s;es it&s;elf in man."

<P>In his Cen&s;or of April, page 133, Porcupine ob&s;erves, that in the Philadelphia Gazette of la&s;t year, he found the following words made u&s;e of by Mr. Giles, in the debate on the al|lowances to members of Congre&s;s. "Mr. Giles &s;aid there was a country, from which America copied a great deal too much. The members of the Briti&s;h hou&s;e of commons re|ceived no wages, while the officers of &s;tate had immen&s;e &s;alaries. It was, however, under|&s;tood that the Briti&s;h hou&s;e of commons were very well paid; he did not wi&s;h to &s;ee &s;cenes of that kind introduced into this country. It was, I think, very uncivil in you Mr. Giles, to mention the word "&s;cenes," as all men &s;uppo&s;e you meant &s;cenes of bribery and cor|ruption; and what hone&s;t man ever doubted, that &s;uch &s;cenes were practi&s;ed by the Briti&s;h. It was, notwith&s;tanding, unpolite to pre&s;s &s;o hard upon Mr. Porcupine's &s;ores; that he has &s;uch &s;ores, the following &s;entence fully evin|ces; it needs no comment; "now, &s;ays he, would it, I wonder, be permitted me to a&s;k this talkative gentleman, what he means by "&s;cenes." He then goes on with his intero|gatories; If, &s;ays he, this were permitted, I would go on, and a&s;k him what he meant by copying too much from Great-Britain." In the next &s;entence he means to quibble, or ap|pear witty, or &s;ay &s;omething to the di&s;advan|tage
<PB N="67" REF="030155_0066_0FE4B10959BD6AA0">
of Mr. Giles; but his idea was certainly too complex, his feeble faculties mu&s;t have been &s;trained, he could not therefore develope it; and he &s;inks into &s;uch unintelligible jargon, that Des Carte, if he were living, could not explain. It is as follows, "If he him&s;elf, &s;peaking of Mr. Giles, be a copy of &s;ome original from that country, (Britain) which I believe to be the ca&s;e, in this in&s;tance I &s;hall not contend, that we have copied too much." To &s;ay that we have copied Mr. Giles from &s;ome original in England; is as mere non&s;en&s;e, in the common acceptation of the word, as ever was uttered; we might &s;ay with &s;ome propriety of thought, that Mr. Giles him|&s;elf imitated, or copied &s;ome original per&s;on, or great orator in that country, had he ever been there; but to &s;ay that we have copied him, is altogether non&s;en&s;e. For a man of Mr. Giles's &s;uperior abilities to think of imitating the Engli&s;hmen, who come into this country, its entirely out of the que&s;tion; its what no man in his &s;en&s;es would ever think of doing; except &s;ome &s;illy Scotchman, who was too la|zy to work and wi&s;hed to become either a knave, or a drunkard. "Again, &s;ays Porcupine, I would a&s;k him,"&mdash;notwith&s;tanding all this bomba&s;t of Peter's, I will venture to affirm, that if he met Mr. Giles fifty times in the &s;treets, he would not dare a&s;k him a &s;yllable; but &s;a|tan like, con&s;cious of &s;uperior worth, he would &s;tand aba&s;hed and hang his guilty head. "A|gain, &s;ays Porcupine, I would a&s;k him, how

I could dare him to a compari&s;on."

As Mr. Giles's time and attention are occupied, on &s;ubjects of too much importance to the community at large; to an&s;wer &s;uch impertinent, &s;illy que&s;tions; I will undertake to inform Mr. Porcupine, where he may <HI>under&s;tand</HI> that the Briti&s;h hou&s;e of Commons are very well paid.

He may likewi&s;e read, "a &s;tatement of facts pub|li&s;hed, in 1795, by Mr. Morgan F. R.
