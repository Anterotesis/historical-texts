<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE this volume was written, the di&s;|pute of Mr. Adams with France hath reached a cri|&s;is. The directory di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with di&s;dain our triple Braintree emba&s;&s;y. The robbery of American &s;hip|ping has bur&s;t into tenfold magnitude; and our pre|&s;ident's bo&s;om beats with rapture at the approach|ing con&s;ummation of his wi&s;hes. Oppo&s;ed as con|tending parti&s;ans, the republic might addre&s;s this mo&s;t infatuated of all &s;tate&s;men in the language of the poet,
<Q><L>One look from Crononhotonthologos</L>

<P>The French may begin by blockading American &s;eaports with ten or twelve frigates. Immediate|ly, the merchants lay up their &s;hipping. Their bills are prote&s;ted by quires. The counting hou&s;es are de&s;erted. The jails are crouded. Stocks tumble to forty per cent. below par. The banks bolt their doors. Hard money vani&s;hes. Drays un|yoked rot by dozens on every wharf. The trea&s;ury &s;u&s;pends payment, and cannot borrow a &s;hilling; becau&s;e, after deducting import duties, its own expences, and the intere&s;t of public debt, become twelve times greater than the public income<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide American Annual Regi&s;ter.</NOTE>. Of cour&s;e the federal government expires.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="033485_0003_0FF71EDAB1EB7AE0">Mr. Sitgreaves &s;poke of dying in the la&s;t ditch. If Jourdan di&s;embarks at Newca&s;tle, he may find an excellent opportunity for dying in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> ditch. We have nine hundred thou&s;and negroes ripe for in&s;urrection; and not a &s;ingle fort fit to be the pigeon-hou&s;e of a Flanders ba&s;tion. Even the Alps and Pyrenees have been &s;caled in their mo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible fa&s;tne&s;&s;es; while five years of French victory have eclip&s;ed five centuries of Ro|man fame. Many people &s;ay that the United States are popular in France, and that the government dares not to declare war. This argument is only fit for a drowning ideot catching at a &s;traw. The di|rectory need but to print a few columns from Mr. Fenno's gazette, and the charm is di&s;&s;olved. At the end of the conte&s;t in Europe, France will overflow with turbulent veterans, and a di&s;tant expedition may very likely be planned, merely for the &s;ake of &s;ending them out of the country.</P>
<P>All men of property are intere&s;ted in per&s;uading Mr. Adams immediately to retire from office. An hundred thou&s;and, or even a million of dollars, would be wi&s;ely be&s;towed to purcha&s;e his re&s;igna|tion.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AMERICA was di&s;covered by Chri&s;to|pher Columbus on the 12th of October, 1492. The north-ea&s;t extremity of A&s;ia approaches within thir|ty-nine miles of the north-we&s;tern coa&s;t of the new world <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">American Edition of the Briti&s;h Encyclopedia: vol. I. p. 568.</NOTE>. The pa&s;&s;age over this narrow &s;trait is faci|litated by two intermediate i&s;lands. Perhaps, in a re|mote aera, &s;ome wandering families of Tartars cro&s;&s;|ed over by this route; and, in the cour&s;e of ages, their po&s;terity di&s;per&s;ed a &s;canty population over this great divi&s;ion of the globe. The E&s;quimaux alone, upon the north-ea&s;tern coa&s;t of the continent, are of a different race, and appear to have been a co|lony from Greenland.</P>
<P>The habitable part of the globe is computed to
<PB N="10" REF="033485_0009_0FF71EE9C1828D08">
contain upwards of thirty millions of geographical &s;quare miles. Of the&s;e, at lea&s;t nine millions are comprehended in America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Carey's American Edition of Guthrie's Geographical Gram|mar, vol. I. p. 36.</NOTE>. This area is about ninety times larger than that of Britain and Ireland, which po&s;&s;e&s;s a population of fourteen millions. When the forge, and the plough &s;hall have &s;tretched their dominion to the &s;ources of the Mi&s;&s;ouri, when a regular body of civilized nations, extending from the St. Laurence to Patagonia, &s;hall cheer and gladden the &s;urface of the earth, America may, without difficulty, &s;upport a thou&s;and millions of in|habitants; or mo&s;t likely, a much greater number.</P>
<P>Though this continent hath been di&s;covered for three centuries, it is yet but imperfectly known to the nations of Europe. Travellers, in de&s;cribing it, have a&s;&s;umed their wonted privileges of embelli&s;h|ment and di&s;tortion. The &s;trange&s;t fables have been circulated and believed, with regard to its climate, its a&s;pect, its natural productions, and the manners of its people.</P>
<P>When an American opens one of tho&s;e nu|merous de&s;criptions of this country, that are pub|li&s;hed in Europe, he is commonly &s;truck with the multiplicity of mi&s;takes that occur in almo&s;t every page. To give an accurate account of any country requires a con&s;iderable &s;hare both of indu&s;try and accutene&s;s. But peculiar difficulties attend this ta&s;k, on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the Atlantic. The habits of the people are more various and fluctuat|ing, than in regions which have been long and thickly &s;ettled. Alterations and improvements of all kinds advance with &s;uch rapidity, at lea&s;t in the territory of the United States, that what was, five years before, a ju&s;t picture, often differs widely from the pre&s;ent condition of the &s;ame territory.
<PB N="11" REF="033485_0010_0FF71EF01F6FA738">
The immen&s;e extent of the continent pre&s;ents &s;uch a variety of temptations to the forming of new &s;et|tlements, the&s;e are &s;o widely diver&s;ified from each other, in their &s;ituation, climate, and produce, and &s;uch numbers of people are con&s;tantly retiring backwards from the ea&s;tern coa&s;t, into the rece&s;&s;es of the wilderne&s;s, that many years mu&s;t pa&s;s over before it can be po&s;&s;ible to &s;ketch a picture of America, which will remain for any con&s;iderable time, an exact re&s;emblance of the original<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A farmer of Kentucky, &s;ometime ago, mentioned in Phila|delphia, that he had re&s;ided in that &s;tate, for about eighteen months. He &s;ettled on the &s;kirts of the cleared land, next the woods, his own hou&s;e being the farthe&s;t in that direction. Since his arrival, &s;o many new &s;ettlers had come, that plantations, were extended fifteen miles beyond his into the de&s;art.</NOTE>. This country may be compared with a child ri&s;ing, by the mo&s;t rapid growth, into the dimen&s;ions of a giant; but con&s;equently requiring a much longer period, before it a&s;&s;umes a completene&s;s of form, than an object of far inferior bulk.</P>
<P>As a &s;pecimen of the &s;trange mi&s;repre&s;entations, with regard to America, which are current in Europe, a few pa&s;&s;ages &s;hall be here &s;elected from &s;ome of the books popular in that part of the world. Dr. Robert&s;on informs us that, <Q>Over all the con|tinent of North-America, a north-we&s;terly wind and <HI>exce&s;&s;ive cold</HI> are &s;ynonimous terms. Even in <HI>the mo&s;t &s;ultry weather,</HI> the moment that the wind veers to that quarter, its penetrating influence is felt in a tran&s;ition from heat to cold no le&s;s violent than &s;udden. To this powerful cau&s;e we may a&s;|cribe the extraordinary dominion of cold, and its violent inroads into the &s;outhern provinces in that part of the globe<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of America. Book IV.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Charlevoix is quoted as an authority for this tale. When he wrote it, he mu&s;t have been thinking of
<PB N="12" REF="033485_0011_0FF71EF1B38D99F0">
the north-we&s;t wind of Canada, through which he travelled. He did not vi&s;it the Briti&s;h colonies; &s;o that he could not &s;ay whether &s;uch a phenomenon prevailed in them or not. From extravagant accounts of this kind, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that the people of Europe form an alarming idea of the American climate. To the greater part of the territory of the United States, perhaps to the whole of it, this de&s;cription bears no re&s;emblance. Char|levoix wrote above &s;eventy years ago; and even though his account had been accurate for that time, yet the climate has &s;ince undergone great alter|ations. Mr. Jeffer&s;on relates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notes on Virginia. ART. CLIMATE.</NOTE>, that formerly the &s;nows in Virginia covered the ground, for about three months in every winter, but that now, in the lower parts of the country, they very &s;eldom lie aweek. He remarks, that, <Q>In Virginia, both heats and colds have become much more moderate with in the memory even of the middle-aged.</Q> Dr. Robert|&s;on mentions a prodigious fro&s;t, at Charle&s;ton, in South-Carolina, in February, 1747. For many years pa&s;t, &s;now and ice have been hardly &s;een in that city.</P>
<P>The &s;ame hi&s;torian attempts to explain the pri|mitive cau&s;e of the extreme degree of cold in Ame|rica. His rea&s;onings appear to be &s;omewhat incon|&s;i&s;tent. As to the northern extremity of the con|tinent he ob&s;erves that, <Q>though the utmo&s;t extent of America towards the north be not yet di&s;cover|ed, we know that it advances nearer to the pole than <HI>either Europe or A&s;ia.</HI> The latter have large &s;eas to the north, which are open during part of the year; and even when covered with ice, the wind that blows over them is le&s;s inten&s;ely cold <HI>than that which blows over land</HI> in the the &s;ame high la|titudes. But in America the land &s;tretches from the
<PB N="13" REF="033485_0012_0FF71EF3471D3678">
river St. Laurence towards the pole, and &s;preads out immen&s;ely to the we&s;t. A chain of enormous mountains, covered with &s;now and ice, runs thro' all this dreary region<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of America. Book IV.</NOTE>.</Q> He goes on to a&s;cribe the peculiar &s;everity of the north-we&s;t American winds to their blowing over <Q>&s;uch an extent of high and frozen <HI>land.</HI></Q> The re&s;ult of his inquiry is, that the climate of North-America is more cold than that of Europe becau&s;e the land is broader and approaches nearer to the north pole. The doctor has omitted to give us any rea&s;on, why a wind that blows over <HI>frozen land</HI> mu&s;t be colder than another which blows over <HI>a frozen &s;ea;</HI> &s;o that his theory of explanation re&s;ts on a mere a&s;&s;umption. But let us admit the ju&s;tice of his a&s;&s;ertion, that the northern extremity of the continent is <HI>colder</HI> than that of Europe, be|cau&s;e it is <HI>broader,</HI> and advances <HI>nearer to the pole.</HI> We are certain then, that the &s;outhern extremity of America, mu&s;t be a great deal warmer than the &s;ame latitude in Europe; for the land approaches only within thirty four degrees of the &s;outh pole, that is, to the latitude of Dunbar, a town in the &s;outh-ea&s;tern part of Scotland. The continent, be&s;ides, is very <HI>narrow;</HI> and its &s;ituation is indeed a perfect contra&s;t to the northern extremity. But here again, the author takes up a quite different doctrine. <Q>The mo&s;t obvious and probable cau&s;e of this &s;uperior degree of cold towards the &s;outhern extremity of America, &s;eems to be the <HI>form of the continent there.</HI> Its breadth gradually <HI>decrea&s;es,</HI> and its dimen&s;ions are <HI>much contracted.</HI></Q> This hy|pothe&s;is he explains in a long note. Thus in one end of America, the <HI>breadth,</HI> and in another end the <HI>narrowne&s;s</HI> of the continent, is advanced as a phi|lo&s;ophical explanation of extreme cold.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="033485_0013_0FF71EF85A4FBBA8"><Q>Another peculiarity in the climate of America is its <HI>exce&s;&s;ive moi&s;ture in general.</HI> In &s;ome places, indeed, on the we&s;tern coa&s;t, rain is not known; but in all other parts, the moi&s;tne&s;s of the climate is as remarkable as the cold. The fore&s;ts where|with it is every where covered, no doubt, partly, occa&s;ion the moi&s;ture of its climate; but the mo&s;t prevalent and obvious cau&s;e is the va&s;t, and Pacific Oceans, with which America is <HI>environed on all &s;ides</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Encyclopedia. vol. I. p. 539.</NOTE>!</Q>. The Cape of Good-Hope is &s;urrounded by immen&s;e oceans; yet the climate is remarkably <HI>dry.</HI> This cannot therefore be a &s;atisfactory expla|nation for the exce&s;s of moi&s;ture in the American atmo&s;phere. But if it were &s;o, the writer, to make his theory con&s;i&s;tent, ought to have demon&s;trated, for what rea&s;on rain is not known, in &s;ome places on <HI>the we&s;tern coa&s;t.</HI> Peru extends along the &s;hore of the great Pacific Ocean, by far the broade&s;t on the &s;urface of the globe, and yet thirty years are &s;aid to have &s;ometimes elap&s;ed in that country without rain. It does not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, on any &s;ound evidence, that the climate of that country is more wet than that of many o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s. Let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s hear the account that is given of the weather of England by per&s;ons who ob&s;erve it. In the Gentleman's Magazine, for February 1793, there is an article, dated the 27th of that month, which may &s;erve to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, in forming ideas on this point. "The climate of England," &s;ays the writer, <Q>in the opinion of many, has, of late years, undergone a con&s;iderable change. Formerly we u&s;ed to have &s;mart fro&s;ts in winter; and hot and &s;ometimes <HI>dry &s;ummers.</HI> For &s;ome years back, both winters and &s;ummers have <HI>generally been wet,</HI> with &s;o little ice, that luxury, by its agents, has been obliged to procure it from foreign parts. In the cour&s;e of la&s;t year, tho&s;e who kept a regi&s;ter of
<PB N="15" REF="033485_0014_0FF71EFADE8310D0">
the weather, tell us, there were but <HI>one hundred and three dry days!</HI> For the little that is pa&s;&s;ed of the pre&s;ent year, we have &s;carcely had &s;ix dry days.</Q> It is not ea&s;y to conceive a more dreadful picture of the atmo&s;phere of any part of the tem|perate zones, than what is here &s;et before us. As it comes from the Engli&s;h them&s;elves, and is atte&s;ted in a re&s;pectable publication, it would be trifling to doubt of its general accuracy. Nor is &s;uch a quantity of rain and moi&s;ture a novelty, as the author &s;eems to hint, in the Briti&s;h i&s;lands. <Q>We have rain, &s;ays a proverb, for nine months in the year, and wet weather for all the re&s;t of it.</Q> Even Americans &s;eem to have adopted an erroneous opinion re&s;pecting the comparative moi&s;ture of their climate. Dr. Mor&s;e has ob&s;erved, that, <Q>the quantity of rain which falls in England annually is computed to be twenty four inches; in France eighteen inches, and in New-England from forty-eight to fifty inches; and yet in New-England they &s;uffer more from drought than in either of the fore-mentioned countries, although they have <HI>more than double</HI> the quantity of rain."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">American Univer&s;al Geography, vol. I. p. 310.</NOTE> In New-England they &s;uffer more from drought,</Q> becau&s;e there is not one-half, nor, perhaps, one-&s;ixth part of the rain annually that falls in England; where, as we have &s;een above, there is rain for five days in the week. If double the quantity of rain actually fell in New-England, it would follow, as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, that every day in the year mu&s;t be wet; but on the contrary, weeks together often pa&s;s in New-England without a &s;ingle &s;hower.</P>
<P>The American climate is colder than that of European countries under the &s;ame latitudes, where the woods have been cleared, and the &s;oil culti|vated for many centuries. But this implies not, as it

the &s;ame degree of latitude in Europe. Many tracts of land, that now lie buried in &s;now, for &s;ix months of the year, will then rival the fine&s;t regions of the world. Quebec &s;tands a degree and fifty-five minutes to the &s;outh of Paris, Halifax, in Nova-Scotia, four degrees and ten minutes to the &s;outh of it, and only one degree and four minutes north of Mont|pelier in Languedoc. Montreal is but ten minutes north of Milan in Italy, and one degree and fifty-nine minutes north of Montpelier. Philadelphia is only two minutes north from the &s;ame latitude with Pekin in China; and in this city, for half of the year, we enjoy delightful weather. Even the colde&s;t winters are con&s;idered as the mo&s;t healthy. In autumn, for a month together, there is frequently not a &s;ingle cloud to be &s;een, while a regular and plentiful dew &s;upercedes the fear of drought. At the &s;ame time of the year, the rains of Britain fre|quently continue during a con&s;iderable time, for &s;ix days in the week, and rot the harve&s;t, while Briti&s;h philo&s;ophers are gravely employed in de&s;cribing and deprecating the malignant moi&s;ture of America. In Penn&s;ylvania, a&s;thmatic complaints are &s;aid to be le&s;s frequent than in Britain, which is a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence from the &s;uperior mildne&s;s and purity of our &s;ky. The climate of London is &s;uppo&s;ed to be equal to that of mo&s;t other parts of England, and is certainly much better than that of &s;ome counties, &s;uch as Lanca&s;ter and Cornwall. Yet from a writer there, we learn that of the fir&s;t fifty-eight days in the year 1793, hardly &s;ix were dry. We are told, on the &s;ame authority, that in the year 1792, England had two hundred and &s;ixty-two days of rain, which is more than a proportion of five days in the week. The Briti&s;h climate al&s;o is thought to be growing wor&s;e; while it is remarked all over this continent, that ours is con&s;tantly grow|ing

better. Mar&s;hes are every where begun to be drained. Whole fore&s;ts are daily cut down. The free circulation of air is thus promoted, while an exuberance of moi&s;ture is checked. Ten times more land is now cleared in one year, than was cleared in the &s;ame &s;pace of time before the war of 1756. We may infer that the improvement of the climate will hear &s;omething like an equally augmented proportion. Hence it is weak in a modern hi&s;torian, to refer implicitly, upon this head, to writers of fifty or an hundred years old. He ought to enquire with diligence how circum|&s;tances actually exi&s;t. A literary man is apt to ima|gine that he knows much, when he has only read much.

<P>There is a copious collection of e&s;timates of this kind, which a&s;certain, that the number of births is in proportion to the number of deaths much greater in North-America than in Europe. Mr. Barton has likewi&s;e printed comparative tables of the longe|vity of the inhabitants of Britain and America; and it appears that the advantage is not on the &s;ide of the former country. In Connecticut, &s;eventy-four per&s;ons, out of every thou&s;and who are born, &s;urvive the age of eighty years; whereas, at North|ampton in England, only forty &s;urvive that period; and at Norwich in the &s;ame country, but thirty-one. The citizens of the northern and middle &s;tates of this continent may re&s;t perfectly &s;atisfied by the conviction, that they have an equal chance for health and long life, with the natives of any other quarter of the globe. To complaints of heat and cold, the&s;e calculations give a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Dr. Robert&s;on tells us, that <Q>the va&s;t number, as well as <HI>enormous</HI> &s;ize of the trees in America, indicate the extraordinary vigour of the &s;oil in its native &s;tate.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of America. Book IV.</NOTE></Q> To believe many European wri|ters as to the growth of American trees, one would imagine, that every tree whatever, in the fore&s;ts of America, grows from four to &s;even or eight feet in diameter, and from &s;ixty to an hundred and twenty feet in height. In fact, a very large propor|tion of American trees are of the common &s;ize
<PB N="20" REF="033485_0019_0FF67B86B16E1168">
of tho&s;e in the old world, and there are &s;till to be &s;een in England, the remains of &s;everal very ancient oaks, of a greater magnitude than any trees yet heard of in America. Some of the&s;e, indeed, ri&s;e to a larger bulk than is u&s;ual in Europe, but in general, the difference in this re&s;pect is only trifling. In America, vegetation is more vigorous than in the Briti&s;h i&s;lands, and a tree has acquired in this country a greater magnitude in twenty years than it can generally reach in England during forty years.</P>
<P>There is a common &s;uppo&s;ition, among the wri|ters of the old world, concerning the woods of America, which has been countenanced by Dr. Robert&s;on: <Q>As trees and plants derive a great part of their nouri&s;hment from, air and water, if they were not de&s;troyed by man and other ani|mals, they would render to the earth more, per|haps, than they take from it, and feed rather than impoveri&s;h it. Thus the unoccupied &s;oil of Ame|rica might go on, <HI>enriching</HI> for many ages.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of America. Book IV.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>This &s;ource of American fecundity is chimerical. It is true that here, as in the old world, the fore&s;ts &s;hed their leaves during autumn, and the&s;e cover the ground in prodigious quantities, but without forming or perceptibly deepening the &s;oil. When the&s;e leaves are turned up to the depth of four, &s;ix, or perhaps twelve inches, the &s;urface of the earth is frequently found heaped with naked &s;tones, with|out almo&s;t a &s;ingle mark of vegetation; and this is, &s;ometimes, the ca&s;e for whole miles together. What, then, has become of tho&s;e immen&s;e ma&s;&s;es of vegetable putrefaction that have been heaped on the ground for at lea&s;t four thou&s;and years? Or where is that peculiar mould of earth, formed by tho&s;e leaves, of which the writers in Europe are
<PB N="21" REF="033485_0020_0FF71F0B42026B68">
&s;peaking? The proper an&s;wer &s;eems to be, that they do not exi&s;t. In Europe, a large extent of country is often covered with fore&s;ts, and when the land has been cleared, the &s;oil is frequently found barren. But if the rotting of the falling leaves in America forms a mould of peculiar fertility, the &s;ame cau&s;es mu&s;t in Europe have produced the &s;ame con&s;equences. As in that continent, how|ever, no &s;uch con&s;equences are to be met with, a moderate degree of reflexion might have convinced the advocates of this idea, that the &s;ame ca&s;e mu&s;t happen in America. Many tracts of this country are entirely dive&s;ted of trees, and yet are equally fertile with any other part of the continent. By this &s;y&s;tem, however they &s;hould have been compari|tively barren. Be&s;ides, a doctrine of this kind leads to extravagant conclu&s;ions. If the fall of leaves is to deepen the &s;oil at all, we may at lea&s;t allow an additional depth of the twentieth part of an inch annually, or five inches in the cour&s;e of a century. At the end of four thou&s;and years, the &s;ur|face of the earth in North-America, &s;hould, by this calculation, have been bedded with a mould to the depth of two hundred inches, or upwards of &s;ix|teen feet and an half. But no per&s;on will affirm, that &s;uch a depth of &s;oil is, perhaps, any where to be found. It is in vain to fabricate plau&s;ible theories in oppo&s;ition to the te&s;timony of the human &s;en&s;es; nor is it of the &s;malle&s;t weight, that &s;uch a doctrine may have been adorned by the combined eloquence of Raynal, Robert&s;on, and Buffon.</P>
<P>As an evidence of the malignity of the American atmo&s;phere, it has been remarked, by Dr. Robert|&s;on, that the animals in this country, when di&s;co|vered by Columbus, were le&s;s various in their &s;pe|cies than tho&s;e of the old world. <Q>Nature was not only le&s;s <HI>prolific</HI> in the new world, but &s;he ap|pears

likewi&s;e to have been le&s;s vigorous in her productions. The animals, <HI>originally</HI> be|longing to this quarter of the globe, appear to be of an inferior race, neither &s;o robu&s;t, nor &s;o fierce, as tho&s;e of the other continent. America <HI>gives birth</HI> to no other creature of &s;uch bulk as to be compared with the Elephant or rhinoceros, or that equals the lion and tyger in &s;trength and ferocity. The <HI>tapyr</HI> of Bra&s;il, the quadruped of the <HI>fir&s;t magnitude</HI> in the new world, is not larger than a calf of &s;ix months old. The <HI>puma</HI> and <HI>jaguar,</HI> its fierce&s;t bea&s;ts of prey, which the Europeans have inaccurately denominated lions and tygers, po&s;&s;e&s;s neither the undaunted courage of the former, nor the ravenous cruelty of the latter. They are inactive and timid, hardly formidable to man, and often turn their backs upon the lea&s;t appearance of re&s;i&s;tance. (So much the better.) The &s;ame qualities in the climate of America which &s;tinted the growth, and enfeebled the &s;pirit of its <HI>native</HI> animals, have proved per|nicious to &s;uch as have <HI>migrated into it volun|tarily</HI> from the other continent, or have been tran&s;ported thither by the Europeans.

Mr. Jeffer&s;on, in his Notes on Virginia, has fully vindicated the climate of America from the&s;e unju&s;t imputations, and the reader will turn, with peculiar &s;atisfaction, to a work, which unites the &s;weetne&s;s of Xenophon with the force of Polybius, information without parade, and eloquence without effort. Mr. Williams, al&s;o, in his hi&s;tory of Vermont, proves, by a multitude of examples, that many animals in America exceed the bulk of the &s;ame &s;pecies in the old world. Some places in this citation, de&s;erve particular notice.</P>
<P>From the in&s;pired writings we learn, that, all quadrupeds, now on the face of the globe, emi|grated from A&s;ia, after the deluge. It is hard then to &s;ay, what the writer means by <HI>animals originally belonging</HI> to this continent, and <HI>native</HI> animals; which he holds up in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e which have <HI>migrated into it voluntarily.</HI> If he &s;uppo&s;es that the tapyr, the puma, and jaguar have been the produce of &s;eparate creation, or that, as he expre&s;&s;es it, America has <HI>given birth</HI> to them, it is as likely that the bears, wolves, and deer, of America, have al&s;o been <HI>created</HI> in the new world. We are fortunate in wanting the &s;trength and perfection of the rhin|oceros, the lion, and the tyger, for we certainly never &s;hould have been the better for them, But the mammoth alone was much larger than the elephant, the rhinoceros, and all the carnivorous quadrupeds put together. This is &s;urely a &s;ufficient evidence of the vigour of nature. Mr. Jeffer&s;on mentions an American bi&s;on that weighed eighteen hundred pounds, a bear, four hundred and ten pounds, and a red deer, two hundred and eighty-eight pounds. He quotes Buffon, as admitting that the beaver, the otter, and &s;hrew-mou&s;e, are <HI>larger in America than in Europe.</HI> The black moo&s;e, is &s;aid by Kalm, to be as high as a tall hor&s;e, and by Cate&s;bey, to be

about the bigne&s;s of a middle-&s;ized ox. Mr. Jeffer|&s;on adds, that the white bear is as large in America as in Europe. If the dome&s;tic animals of North-America are inferior to tho&s;e of Europe, it is only from want of care in tho&s;e who breed them. <Q>It may be affirmed with truth, that in tho&s;e countries, and with tho&s;e individuals of America, where nece&s;&s;ity or curio&s;ity has produced equal attention, as in Europe, to the nouri&s;hment of animals, the hor&s;es, cattle, &s;heep, and hogs of the one continent are as large as tho&s;e of the other.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notes on the State of Virginia.

of the &s;ea-port towns of the United States, where &s;ub&s;i&s;tence has univer&s;ally become very expen&s;ive, as in any part of England. Yet, &s;uch marriages occa&s;ionally take place in both countries. In the country, where food may be had for a trifle, an American farmer might not be much afraid of &s;uch an incumbrance with a wife, yet he would con&s;ider four or five children to be one. The value of chil|dren, regarded merely as working machines, would be an idle motive to matrimony, &s;ince it would be more expedient to hire &s;ervants. The pre&s;ent generation is &s;ufficiently di&s;po&s;ed to leave another behind it; but not for the money that is to be ac|quired by rearing of children. As to the great increa&s;e by &s;uch early marriages, in a con&s;iderable portion, at lea&s;t, of this continent, marriages are not perceptibly more early than in Europe, or, if a difference can be found, it is but &s;mall. Mr. Barton, in the article before quoted, has made a large collection of the various amount of births in proportion to marriages, in France, England, Pru&s;|&s;ia, Switzerland, and other parts of Europe. For the&s;e four countries, the births are about four to every marriage, or &s;omewhat le&s;s. He quotes the regi&s;ter of marriages and births for a town in Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts, during the cour&s;e of fifty-four years. The former amounted to five hundred and twenty-one, the latter to two thou&s;and two hundred and forty-&s;even. This gives four births to every mar|riage, with an overplus of one hundred and &s;ixty-three, or le&s;s than one-third. But no &s;ingle in&s;tance can be a &s;atisfactory evidence of the &s;uperior num|ber of births to a marriage, for the whole of &s;o va&s;t a continent.</P>

<P>The que&s;tion has been warmly debated, what right Europeans ever had to territories in America? When the Spaniards laid wa&s;te populous and civi|lized empires, the nature of their conduct needs no illu&s;tration. We &s;hall here &s;peak only of the &s;et|tlement of tho&s;e colonies, that are now compre|hended in the federal union. With regard to them, hi&s;tory will not &s;upport or ju&s;tify the har&s;h language that has been &s;ometimes employed.</P>
<P>New-England contains nearly one-fifth, part of the people in the United States. It was originally colonized by per&s;ons who conducted them&s;elves on the principles of &s;trict ju&s;tice. In March, 1621, Ma&s;a&s;&s;oit, one of the principal Indian chiefs, vi&s;ited the Plymouth &s;ettlers. He entered into a treaty with them. It was inviolably ob&s;erved by him&s;elf and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors for fifty years; and, at this day, the name of Ma&s;a&s;&s;oit is remembered in New-England with re&s;pect and gratitude. New-York was fir&s;t planted by the Dutch; and this event does not &s;eem to be marked by any &s;trong &s;ymptoms of ho&s;|tility, or of fraud. The lands of Penn&s;ylvania were hone&s;tly purcha&s;ed from the Indians. They adhered peaceably to their bargain, and no third party is entitled to object again&s;t it. As to Virginia, Mr. Jeffer&s;on, in his Notes, ob&s;erves, <Q>that the lands of this country were taken from them (the na|tives) by conque&s;t, is not &s;o general a truth as is
<PB N="30" REF="033485_0029_0FF71F24292C5820">
&s;uppo&s;ed. I find, in our hi&s;torians and records, repeated proofs of purcha&s;e, which cover a con|&s;iderable part of the lower country; and many more would, doubtle&s;s, be found on further &s;earch. The upper country we know has been acquired altogether by purcha&s;e, made <HI>in the mo&s;t unexceptionable form.</HI></Q> As for the other &s;tates, we &s;hall find, that, in general, the lands have been acquired at a price which was con&s;idered as adequate, by both parties. Sub&s;equent breaches of treaty have been committed on each &s;ide. In con&s;equence, quarrels en&s;ued, ju&s;t as they do in Europe. They could not always be avoided here, any more than in the old world, unle&s;s the new &s;ettlers had de&s;erted their lands and left North-America to remain a wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>In &s;ome parts of Virginia, Mr. Jeffer&s;on com|putes, that the Indians were as one to every &s;quare mile. Other regions of the continent were &s;till more de&s;olate. Of this Dr. Robert&s;on gives the following in&s;tances. A mi&s;&s;ionary travelled from the Illinois to Machillimackinac. In twelve days, the party did not meet with a &s;ingle human creature. Dr. Brickell, in an excur&s;ion from North-Carolina towards the mountains, did not, in the cour&s;e of fif|teen days, meet any per&s;on whatever. The continent, with a few exceptions, contained, perhaps, not more than a thou&s;andth part of the people whom it was capable of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting. Such va&s;t tracts of excellent land ought not to lie wa&s;te; and they never would have been peopled by the Indians. The Europeans purcha&s;ed exten&s;ive territories on the coa&s;t, and colonized them. If the natives found them&s;elves incommoded for want of room, they had it in their option to retire backwards into the de&s;art; where a hunter might range for a fortnight without meeting a rival. They had, therefore, no great rea|&s;on
<PB N="31" REF="033485_0030_0FF71F26C799D8B8">
to be di&s;contented. It might be &s;aid, that they could &s;ub&s;i&s;t by hunting only, and that to deprive them of their hunting ground was to &s;tarve them. We mu&s;t admit, with many exceptions, the idea that their chief &s;ub&s;i&s;tence was derived from the chace. The tribes on the north and &s;outh-we&s;tern frontier of the union, have large plantations of Indian corn, and rai&s;e cattle; &s;o that they now, at lea&s;t, are in very little danger of &s;tarving, though they &s;hould never hunt at all. When general Sullivan marched into the country of the Six Nations, he found exten|&s;ive orchards and cornfields. General Wayne, in Augu&s;t, 1794, declared, that the Miamis had the large&s;t corn fields which he ever &s;aw in America; and it has been &s;aid, that they extended to five thou|&s;and acres. Some writers indeed &s;eem to think that it was culpable to take Indian lands, upon any terms, and expatiate on the trifling prices paid for them. But the&s;e lands are in reality worth very little to a tribe of hunters compared with their value to a na|tion of farmers and manufacturers. There is no harm in <HI>buying</HI> ground from an Indian community any more than from a private per&s;on in Europe. Why &s;hould a tribe of two or three hundred hunters engro&s;s an extent of land equal to the &s;upport of five hundred thou&s;and or a million of people? The Indians on our frontier are not, at pre&s;ent, famed for &s;implicity; as will appear in a future part of this volume.</P>
<P>Mr. Guthrie, in his Geographical Grammar, e&s;|timates the whole inhabitants of America at one hundred and fifty millions. This is a very wild mi&s;take. The amount may be a&s;certained with to|lerable accuracy. The &s;ubject is curious and de|&s;erves our attention.</P>
<P>By the cen&s;us of 1791, the United States contain|ed, three millions, nine hundred and twenty-nine
<PB N="32" REF="033485_0031_0FF71F28580DEDB0">
thou&s;and, three hundred and twenty-&s;ix per&s;ons; &s;ome di&s;tricts were not included. The whole, ac|cording to Mor&s;e, vol I. p. 207, may have been three millions, nine hundred and fifty thou&s;and. In 1784, Canada, by a cen&s;us, was found to have one hundred and thirteen thou&s;and and twelve in|habitants, be&s;ides ten thou&s;and loyali&s;ts, in the up|per parts of the province. The total population of the Briti&s;h dominions of North-America can &s;carce|ly exceed two hundred thou&s;and. The native In|dians may be gue&s;&s;ed at an equal number; and the &s;ettlers in the Spani&s;h part of North America, at an hundred thou&s;and. The&s;e make together half a million. About &s;even years have elap&s;ed, &s;ince the cen&s;us of the United States. The people may be now augmented by one million. Thus, if we allow five millions to the federal government, and five hundred thou&s;and to the Spaniards, the Briti&s;h, and Indians, we have, in whole, five millions, and an half. The empire of Mexico is divided into nine dioce&s;es; and in 1741, a cen&s;us was made of the people in four of the&s;e, and in &s;ome part of a fifth. The Indian families were two hundred and ninety-four thou&s;and, three hundred and ninety-one, which, at five to a family, make one million, four hundred and &s;eventy-one thou&s;and nine hundred and fifty-five. Dr. Robert&s;on, who gives this &s;tatement, &s;ub|joins, that in two of the dioce&s;es omitted, <Q>the In|dian race is more numerous than <HI>in any</HI> (other) <HI>part of New Spain.</HI></Q> In Nova Galicia, which he terms a va&s;t province, the people, of only <Q>a &s;mall part of it,</Q> were numbered. We may, therefore, conclude, that the four di&s;tricts, where the Indians were not numbered at all, and that part of Nova Galicia which was left un&s;ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eyed, contains, at lea&s;t, as many Indians, as the other part of the empire. The hi&s;torian, therefore, was certainly inaccurate
<PB N="33" REF="033485_0032_0FF71F2B0D831B40">
in &s;aying, that <Q>the number of Indians in the Mex|ican empire exceeds <HI>two</HI> millions.</Q> By his own account, they mu&s;t have been not le&s;s than three millions, in 1741, when this imperfect cen&s;us was made in four dioce&s;es only, and part of a fifth one, out of the whole nine. About fifty-three years have &s;ince elap&s;ed. They are, upon the whole, increa&s;ing, of which Dr. Smith has brought &s;ome evidence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inquiry into the Wealth of Nations, Book V. Chap. vii. Part II.</NOTE>, &s;o that by this time, they are, mo&s;t likely, four millions. The other inhabitants of Mexico are, by the highe&s;t computation of Dr. Robert&s;on, three millions. Thus we have &s;even millions for Mexico, and Peru is not beleived to be more populous. Ad|mitting the&s;e two empires to contain fourteen mil|lions of inhabitants, and the other Spani&s;h dominions on the continent of South-America two millions, we have thus &s;ixteen millions. Four millions will be &s;ufficient for Bra&s;il and Paraguay. The re&s;t of that continent, a few &s;pots excepted, is a de&s;art. Hence the total number of inhabitants in South-America does not amount to more than twenty millions, nor tho&s;e in North-America to more than five millions and an half; at lea&s;t the over-plus cannot be con&s;i|derable.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the United States have, by various calculations, been found to double upon a medium, in twenty-five years. Hence, in 1847, their pre&s;ent population of five millions will have extended to twenty, and in 1897, to eighty mil|lions. By the &s;ame progre&s;s, the clo&s;e of the nine|teenth century would comprehend an augmen|tation to twelve hundred and eighty millions; and as, before that time, the northern continent mu&s;t be over-&s;tocked with people, the over-plus will natu|rally find vent in the &s;outhern continent. Under

many difficulties, the people of New-England, in particular, have continued for an hundred and fifty years to multiply in the preceding proportion; and there is no rea&s;on to think, that the ratio will here|after decrea&s;e.</P>
<P>Peru was conquered about two hundred and fifty years ago, and Mexico at a more early period. Since that time, the&s;e countries have remained in tranquillity; and yet it is very doubtful whether, including every colour, they contain at pre&s;ent five times the number of people which were to be found in them immediately after the Spani&s;h conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Since the fir&s;t torrent of emigration, in the reign of Charles I. very few individuals have ever gone to &s;ettle in New-England; but there has been a con|&s;tant &s;tream of emigration from it into the other colonies. The original &s;ettlers amounted, by Hutchin&s;on's account, to about twenty thou&s;and, and, including Vermont, that part of the union has now a million of people. Thus, in a century and an half, the fir&s;t colony has augmented to fifty times its primitive number; while the increa&s;e in the Spani&s;h provinces bears not any thing that ap|proaches to a corre&s;pondent proportion. Such is the eternal difference between freedom and &s;lavery. Under a government like ours, the Spani&s;h colo|nies might, by this time, have made the banks of the Amazon and the La Plata, as populous as tho&s;e of the Delaware and the Hud&s;on.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS the native Americans were, in a a great mea&s;ure, defencele&s;s, the &s;overeigns of Eu|rope immediately marked out this continent for their prey; and a con&s;iderable portion of it continues to langui&s;h in their fetters. By flagrant u&s;urpation, they a&s;&s;umed the right of granting patents and charters, for di&s;covery and colonization, on the we&s;tern &s;hore of the Atlantic. If Columbus had accompli&s;hed a voyage to the moon, or if Cabot had a&s;cended to the planet Her&s;chel, a king of Spain or England, might, with equal plau&s;ibility, have claimed a title of parcelling out the&s;e regions to Cortez, or to Penn. This was a violation of natural ju&s;tice, which had no precedent among the ancients. When the Gre|cian republics di&s;per&s;ed colonies on the coa&s;t of A&s;ia, they never attempted to a&s;&s;ume that &s;ort of dominion, which hath &s;ince been claimed by the monarchs of Europe. The Americans, during the late revolution, might have &s;pared much of their labour in proving what rights they had acquired,
<PB N="36" REF="033485_0035_0FF71F346BE7E9F8">
by their charters, from the Briti&s;h crown. All go|vernment, which is not founded on the legitimate con&s;ent of the people, and conducted by their re|pre&s;entatives, is, in it&s;elf, u&s;urpation Hence, when a Briti&s;h monarch gave a title to countries which were not his own, it was to be &s;uppo&s;ed that his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, in the &s;ame &s;pirit of robbery, would em|brace the fir&s;t temptation to break their part of the engagement. But this breach, on their &s;ide, was of little con&s;equence; becau&s;e, &s;uch patents and char|ters formed an in&s;ult upon common &s;en&s;e, and the primitive rights of mankind.</P>
<P>If the Briti&s;h government had been at any charge in founding colonies in North America, there might have been &s;ome rea&s;on for a&s;&s;uming a privilege to give them laws, to &s;mother their manufactures, and re&s;trict their navigation. But, in place of money or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he gave them nothing, or next to nothing, but charters, for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing territories that were not her's to be&s;tow, and of which &s;he did not always know under what degree of latitude they were placed. The numerous mi&s;takes in extending royal grants have produced confu&s;ion and litiga|tion in the colonies. The &s;ettlers of America were able, without foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to have made laws, and marked out boundaries for them&s;elves. Eng|land interpo&s;ed in this way for one &s;ingle purpo&s;e only, that, as &s;oon as the colonies became a fit ob|ject for taxation, or monopoly, &s;he might &s;ecure to her&s;elf the whole benefits that could be drawn from them. People, to this day, and even on this &s;ide of the Atlantic, per&s;i&s;t in terming Britain the <HI>mother</HI> country. If her relation to her colonies de|&s;erved a dome&s;tic name, it was that of a jealous and bloody &s;tep-mother.</P>
<P>In the exportation of their own &s;urplus produce, the Briti&s;h colonies, both of North-America, and
<PB N="37" REF="033485_0036_0FF71F3636D96990">
the We&s;t-Indies, were greatly re&s;tricted by acts of parliament. Part of their productions could be ex|ported only to Britain. By confining tobacco and cotton, for in&s;tance, to the home market, the Bri|ti&s;h merchants expected that they would be able to buy them cheaper in the plantations, and to &s;ell them with a better profit in Britain. They likewi&s;e propo&s;ed, by this regulation, to e&s;tabli&s;h, in their own favour, between the colonies and foreign countries, an advantageous <HI>carrying trade,</HI> of which Britain was to be the centre, as the only country in Europe into which the&s;e commodities were fir&s;t to be im|ported. Britain encouraged America in the manu|facture of pig and bar iron, by exempting them from duties to which the like commodities were &s;ubjected, when imported from any other country. Yet an ab&s;olute prohibition was impo&s;ed upon the erection of &s;teel furnaces, and &s;litting mills in any of the colonies. England would not &s;uffer her co|loni&s;ts to work in tho&s;e more refined manufactures, even for their own con&s;umption. They were to purcha&s;e, from her merchants and manufacturers, all goods of this kind, for which they had occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>She prohibited the exportation from one pro|vince to another by water, and even the carriage by land upon hor&s;eback, or in a cart, of hats, of wools and woollen goods of the produce of Ame|rica. This regulation prevented the e&s;tabli&s;hment of any manufactures of &s;uch commodities for di&s;|tant &s;ale; and confined the indu&s;try of the Ame|ricans in this way, to &s;uch coar&s;e and hou&s;hold ma|nufactures, as a private family commonly makes for its own u&s;e, or for that of &s;ome of its neigh|bours in the &s;ame province. After reciting the&s;e re&s;trictions, Dr. Smith adds, that <Q>to prohibit a great people from making all that they can of every part of their own produce, or from employ|ing
<PB N="38" REF="033485_0037_0FF71F38EA953AD8">
their &s;tock and indu&s;try in the way that they judge mo&s;t advantageous to them&s;elves, is a <HI>ma|nife&s;t violation of the mo&s;t &s;acred rights of man|kind</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inquiry into the Nature and Cau&s;es of the Wealth of Nations, Book IV.

For the author adds, that the&s;e prohibitions were <Q>only <HI>impertinent badges of &s;lavery</HI> impo&s;ed upon them (the colonies) without any &s;ufficient rea&s;on, by the groundle&s;s jealou&s;y of the merchants and ma|nufacturers of the <HI>mother</HI> country.</Q></P>
<P>This account ought to calm the raptures of Ame|rican gratitude towards the &s;upremacy of Britain, even in its be&s;t days, and its milde&s;t form. Her commercial regulations have always been adapted, or, at lea&s;t, de&s;igned, to &s;erve her own intere&s;t at the expence of the re&s;t of the world, her colonies not excepted. How far &s;he was &s;ucce&s;sful in this effort, may be gathered from the intere&s;ting &s;tate|ment exhibited by the &s;ame author<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Part III.</NOTE>.

<P>In the fir&s;t place, it does not appear that the crown of England bore almo&s;t any part of the charges of founding the colonies, that now compo&s;e the &s;ixteen United States. Before the year 1589, Sir Walter Raleigh had expended forty thou&s;and pounds &s;ter|ling, in attempting to &s;ettle adventurers in Virginia.

<P>Be&s;ides the difficulty of obtaining leave to &s;et|tle in America, the coloni&s;ts had another formid|able ob&s;tacle to encounter and &s;urmount. The crown of England had parcelled out the country to &s;ome of its hungry dependents. To the&s;e men a new co|lony was of no value, but for what could be &s;queez|ed out of it. They were careful to exert their au|thority in a &s;tyle worthy of the &s;ource from which
<PB N="41" REF="033485_0040_0FF71F40C2632520">
it was derived. The arbitrary proceedings of the king and parliament, in a&s;&s;uming a power to make laws for the colonies without their concurrence, filled up the mea&s;ure of American wrongs. Britain, evidently thru&s;t her&s;elf into the government of this country for the &s;ake of what &s;he could get; and, accordingly, when the colonies had made &s;ome pro|gre&s;s in agriculture, &s;he was careful to cramp their commerce and indu&s;try, by vexatious and oppre&s;&s;ive edicts. In this account there appear no traces of maternal affection. The royal, or parliamentary au|thority, along with that of the patentees, was, in all ca&s;es, and without exception, a gro&s;s de&s;poti&s;m, founded on the helple&s;sne&s;s of the original &s;ettlers. Between the patentees, however, a di&s;tinction mu&s;t be made. Of Gorges and Ma&s;on, the colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts knew little, but by the law-&s;uits rai&s;|ed in &s;upport of their claims. As far as they or Penn had expended money in &s;ettling or improving the colonies, they were entitled to compen&s;ation; and certainly no farther.</P>
<P>This kind of rea&s;oning cuts &s;hort all claims of gratitude on the part of America towards England. As England never had any right of making laws for America, it is not worth while to de&s;cend to particu|lar in&s;tances, where the&s;e laws were oppre&s;&s;ive, be|cau&s;e the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of them were, in equity, as truly void, as the gift of an e&s;tate by a per&s;on who is not the lawful owner. The con&s;tant tran&s;|portation of all &s;orts of criminals from Britain to the colonies, was an in&s;ult, of that kind, which might have excu&s;ed the Americans, for overlook|ing even the greate&s;t obligations. Lewis the four|teenth, if a&s;ked, would very chearfully have ceded Canada, Cape Breton, and Nova Scotia to England. The&s;e opportunities were neglected. Judge Hutch|in&s;on thinks it likely, that, if the French had been

In reality, it does not appear that the Engli&s;h govern|ment, in any &s;ingle in&s;tance, paid &s;erious atten|tion to the intere&s;t of the colonies.

<P>As to the war of 1756, Dr. Franklin had pro|po&s;ed to defend Penn&s;ylvania, by em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ying an American militia.

The mo&s;t effectual mode of le&s;&s;ening this, was to put arms into the hands of the inhabitants, to teach them their u&s;e.

It may, therefore, be worth while to examine more fully the real cau&s;es of the war of 1756, and the real importance of Canada to the re&s;t of the Briti&s;h empire.</P>
<P>The animo&s;ity of the Engli&s;h nation towards France, has plunged them into many unprovoked wars again&s;t that people. One of the principal cau&s;es of that in que&s;tion, was their jealou&s;y of the &s;hare which the French had in trade with the Indians. Some of the latter pa&s;&s;ed by Albany to Montreal, two hundred and fifty miles farther, to buy goods, which they could have had cheaper at Albany. Guthrie, in his Geographical Grammar, &s;tates this circum&s;tance, and adds, with a tone of regret, <Q>&s;o much did the French exceed <HI>us</HI> in the arts of winning the affections of the&s;e &s;avages!</Q> If the
<PB N="45" REF="033485_0044_0FF71F4B13FE2618">
Indians preferred the French to the Engli&s;h market, it mu&s;t have been becau&s;e they were better treated at Montreal than at Albany; &s;o that the remark, though de&s;igned by the writer as an oblique &s;arca&s;m on French cunning, is a tacit acknowledgement of the &s;uperior prudence and integrity of the French nation. But this diminutive advantage on the &s;ide of France, de&s;erved not to have been, as it really was, an object of envy to the people of England. The&s;e two rival nations traver&s;ed an ocean above a thou&s;and leagues wide, that they might open dram &s;hops, for the de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uchery and extirpation of a race of naked barbarians. This traffic was not an object of rational ambition to either party. Their common eagerne&s;s to pur&s;ue it, may readily be traced to their &s;trong de&s;ire of purcha&s;ing furs from the In|dians, at a very cheap rate, in order to &s;ell them at an exorbitant price in Europe. The &s;piritous liquors, which formed a &s;taple commodity in this commerce, have utterly de&s;troyed whole tribes of the primitive Americans: of tho&s;e who &s;till exi&s;t, the havoc has been very great. The Six Nations, for example, are &s;aid to have &s;hrunk from a very &s;uperior number, to hardly fifteen hundred fighting men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>There are in the Six Nations, according to an accurate e&s;ti|mate, lately made by the reverend Mr. Kirkland, mi&s;&s;ionary among them, &s;ix thou&s;and, three hundred, and thirty &s;ouls. He adds, that among the&s;e there <HI>is,</HI> comparatively, but very few chil|dren.</Q> Mor&s;e, vol. I. p. 44.</NOTE>. In a moral &s;en&s;e, therefore, this trade was extremely dete&s;table. But, even as a &s;ource of wealth, its expediency might have been very doubt|ful. We are told that the Indians would &s;ometimes give away their whole property for a dram. But the traders were frequently robbed and murdered, by the &s;avages, whom they had intoxicated for the purpo&s;e of cheating them. This is the natural pro|gre&s;s
<PB N="46" REF="033485_0045_0FF71F4EFB0563E8">
and termination of knavery. After all, the furs were to be tran&s;ported acro&s;s the Atlantic, be|fore they could be &s;old again. Hence, if we take into con&s;ideration, the numerous hazards of all kinds that were to be &s;urmounted, before the &s;kin of a beaver was finally brought to market, it &s;eems very likely, that, upon the whole, the&s;e wandering pedlars from Europe, would have been employed more honourably and more profitably, both for their countrymen and them&s;elves, at home, in the ordi|nary occupations of dome&s;tic life. But the futility of this plan of commerce is placed beyond all doubt by another con&s;ideration. Canada was the princi|pal cau&s;e of the bloody war of 1756. This war co&s;t England one hundred and eleven millions, two hundred and &s;eventy-one thou&s;and, nine hundred and ninety-&s;ix pounds &s;terling of public money<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of the Public Revenue of the Briti&s;h Empire, by &s;ir John Sinclair, vol. II. p. 99.</NOTE>. The expences of France were certainly as great. Thus it is evident that a &s;ingle campaign co&s;t either nation more than all the furs in the world were worth. Since Britain became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Canada, her trade with that country has been computed to employ about &s;ixty &s;hips, and a thou&s;and &s;eamen. The exports from the province, at an average of three years, in &s;kins, furs, gin&s;eng, &s;nake-root, ca|pillaire, and wheat, amounted to one hundred and five thou&s;and, five hundred pounds &s;terling per an|num. The imports from Britain were e&s;timated about the &s;ame &s;um<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Guthrie, p. 887.</NOTE>. It may be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the number of &s;hips and &s;eamen engaged in this trade, is at pre&s;ent much greater, than has been above &s;tated; for the trade it&s;elf has, of late years, been con&s;iderably augmented. In 1786, the exports from the province of Canada amounted to three hundred
<PB N="47" REF="033485_0046_0FF71F51A52C1530">
and forty-three thou&s;and, two hundred and &s;ixty-three pounds &s;terling. The imports of the &s;ame year, were three hundred and twenty-five thou|&s;and, one hundred and &s;ixteen pounds &s;terling<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mor&s;e, vol. I. p. 109.</NOTE>. Thus the extent of the commerce between Britain and Canada &s;eems to have trebled &s;ince the peace of 1763. We &s;hall lay a&s;ide the extravagant ex|pence of the conque&s;t, as well as that of preceed|ing wars for Canada, and of its defence in the re|volution of 1775. Let us then e&s;timate the pre&s;ent advantages derived by Britain from this addition to her dominions. The amount of Briti&s;h goods ex|ported to Canada, &s;ince the conque&s;t, in 1763, can|not, upon an average up to this time, (January, 1798) be higher than two hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling per annum. This calculation may be &s;afely re&s;ted on the particular &s;tatements above mention|ed. It is always reckoned a good trade, where a clear profit is to be gained of ten per cent. At this rate, England obtains, by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Canada, twenty thou&s;and pounds annually. It is u&s;ual, in e&s;|timating the benefits ari&s;ing to a nation in Europe, from one of its American colonies, to &s;peak of the whole profits of the commerce, as if they were &s;ome peculiar &s;pecies of emolument, that could have been acquired only by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that indivi|dual &s;pot. This &s;ort of political &s;ophi&s;try has pro|duced &s;ome very bloody and fruitle&s;s wars. In the ca&s;e before us, for in&s;tance, the &s;ame capital could have been employed by Briti&s;h merchants in other branches of trade; and therefore the acqui&s;ition of the country did not de&s;erve a &s;truggle. We are, indeed, informed, of the immen&s;e advantages that are obtained by the procuring from Canada of raw materials for manufactures<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Guthrie, p. 887.</NOTE>. This is another part
<PB N="48" REF="033485_0047_0FF71F5386994CF0">
of the mercantile catechi&s;m, that has impelled man|kind to innumerable crimes. <HI>The raw materials</HI> of manufactures may always be had, by tho&s;e, who, like the Briti&s;h nation, are able to pay for them. But we &s;hall admit that they could only be found in Canada, and that upon the&s;e raw materials, there is a &s;econd clear profit of ten per cent. amounting altogether, to a benefit of forty thou&s;and pounds per annum, to Britain. Still that nation is a great lo&s;er by the retention of Canada. The expences of her civil and military e&s;tabli&s;hment cannot be ex|actly a&s;certained, yet they will hardly come to le&s;s than an hundred thou&s;and pounds a year; for the &s;ingle fortre&s;s of Gibraltar, even in time of peace, co&s;ts England annually twice that &s;um<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of the Public Revenue, vol II. p. 172.</NOTE>. In time of war, the expences both of Gibraltar and of Canada, become infinitely greater. If the military e&s;tabli&s;h|ment in Canada be two thou&s;and men, the&s;e are &s;o many hands &s;ubtracted from the dome&s;tic manufac|tures of Britain, to an extent of lo&s;s, perhaps, not le&s;s than fifty thou&s;and pounds a year. Thus, in one way or other, this province draws from Britain an hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling per annum, even in time of peace, while its profits are forty thou&s;and. Ireland, in the reign of Elizabeth, required for its peace e&s;tabli&s;hment, more than four times the product of the whole revenue that tyranny could rend from its vitals<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rey<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s American Edition of Guthrie, vol.

<P>For the &s;ake both of Europe and America, it is to be de&s;ired, that the colonial &s;upremacy, held by the former, over &s;ome regions of the latter, may &s;oon expire. This u&s;urped authority has uniformly pro|duced bad con&s;equences to all parties. Spain, for in&s;tance, with the mo&s;t wealthy and tempting por|tion of the new world, hath been reduced to ruin. Her colonies, at the &s;ame time, groan under odious oppre&s;&s;ion. Peru and Chili excepted, the culture of the vine and olive are forbidden to the Spani&s;h co|loni&s;ts. They mu&s;t buy the wine and oll for which they have occa&s;ion from old Spain. The difficulty of tran&s;porting &s;uch bulky articles acro&s;s the I&s;th|mus of Panama, is the only rea&s;on for exempting Peru and Chili from this edict of de&s;olation. No ve&s;&s;el belonging to the Spani&s;h colonies was ever permitted to carry the commodities of America to Europe. No ve&s;&s;el of any foreign nation is openly received into the harbours of the Spani&s;h dominions on the continent of America. The pains of death, and the confi&s;cation of moveables, are denounced again&s;t every inhabitant who trades with them. Yet, in &s;pite of all the&s;e regulations, the king of Spain is defrauded of half his revenues. An author, quot|ed

<P>It is plea&s;ing to ob&s;erve how the rapacity of de&s;poti&s;m over&s;hoots its aim. The Spaniards, both in Europe and America, have their invention continual|ly on the &s;tretch to elude the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oyal edicts. This &s;pirit de&s;cends from the highe&s;t departments in govern|ment to the lowe&s;t. The very officers appointed to check contraband trade, are often employed as in&s;tru|ments in carrying it on; and the boards in&s;tituted to re&s;train and puni&s;h it, are the channels through which it flows. In Mexico and Peru, the annual e&s;tab|li&s;hment for defraying the charge of admini&s;tration, exceeds one-half of the revenue collected. The annu|al amount, in &s;terling money, exacted by Spain from America and the Phillipine i&s;lands, is computed by Dr. Robert&s;on at only two millions and &s;even hun|dred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, of which one-half is expended in &s;upport of the admini&s;tration. If the&s;e dominions contain &s;ixteen millions of people, the king of Spain gains by them about one &s;hilling and eight pence per head. A poor reward for the &s;la|very of a human being! But for their oppre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, the Spani&s;h colonies might, perhaps, have
<PB N="51" REF="033485_0050_0FF71F5DA0A6CB90">
been thrice as populous, and certainly much more improved than they are at pre&s;ent. Spain has had a &s;till wor&s;e bargain of her colonies than Britain. Even in point of economy, it would have been for her advantage, to declare them independent an hundred years ago. The bloody war of 1739, exclu&s;ive of many other quarrels, mu&s;t have co&s;t her altogether, at lea&s;t twenty-five or thirty mil|lions &s;terling.

In &s;ummer la&s;t, Mr. Robert Har|per held out to Congre&s;s, the conque&s;t of the two Mexicos, as a temptation for America to league with England again&s;t France. The above detail &s;hews how in&s;ignificant the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are even to Spain her&s;elf; and thus, on the &s;ide of avarice, the &s;cheme is bla&s;ted, even if the regions de&s;tined to federal plunder could be &s;eized without re&s;i&s;tance. Mr. Harper, at the &s;ame time, railed at the French for conquering the dominions of monarchs, who had endeavoured to conquer them. Spain hath not warred again&s;t the United States, &s;o that his own plan was evidently by far more atrocious than any which he had a&s;cribed to the republic. A pro|&s;al for robbery more unprovoked, more &s;hamele&s;s, more criminal, was never &s;ugge&s;ted in the cabin of Blackbeard, or the camp of Brandt.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><Q>THE way to empire cannot be too &s;hort,</Q> &s;aid Tullia, when &s;he drove her chariot over her father's dead body. <Q>The way to Spani&s;h gold cannot be too &s;hort,</Q> exclaims the federal orator to congre&s;s. The wi&s;dom of Mr. Harper's &s;cheme is equal to its hone&s;ty. For the trifling ex|pence of ten millions of dollars, the United States might a&s;&s;emble twenty thou&s;and men at the mouth of the Ohio. They have then only to de&s;cend with the &s;tream, till they gain &s;ome proper place for di&s;|embarking. They next da&s;h through a fore&s;t three hundred leagues wide, which leads them to the ca|pital of New Mexico. Some &s;light objections occur. Three-fourths of the army will die of hunger on the march, from the difficulty of taking &s;ufficient provi&s;ions along with them. Three-fourths of the remainder will peri&s;h of fatigue and the flux; and the Indians may, probably, knock the re&s;t on the head. But the&s;e are the petty cavils of cowardice. Cortez did not calculate, and why &s;hould we?</P>
<P>If this plan had only been &s;pouted in a &s;it of pa&s;|&s;ion, it had not been worthy of attentive remark,
<PB N="54" REF="033485_0053_0FF67B885DD730D0">
But Mr. Harper, in a printed letter to his con&s;titu|ents, dated May 25th, 1797, dwells upon the idea, Recommending an alliance with England, he &s;ays, that the colonies of Holland and Spain <Q>mu&s;t &s;ink under the arms of the two countries:</Q> viz. of Britain and the United States. A long extract, con|taining this a&s;&s;ertion, he been circulated in one, at lea&s;t, if not others, of the federal new&s;papers. If the friends of order, in congre&s;s, had never propa|gated any &s;cheme equally profligate and audacious with this, charity would be led to &s;uppo&s;e, that Mr. Harper acted only by the impul&s;e of his own folly. But their &s;truggle for rejecting the Indian, Algerine, and Spani&s;h treaties, unle&s;s linked with that of Jay, was a branch from the &s;ame root. The war with France, into which they make &s;uch vigorous efforts for driving America, is altogether as frantic as Mr. Harper's plan; and hence it is not injuring them to believe that they approved of his propo&s;al for the Mexican expedition.</P>
<P>On the 2d of June, 1797, a number of American captains at Port-au-Prince, in St. Domingo, pre&s;en|ted a petition to governor Simcoe. They repre&s;en|ted that eleven American ve&s;&s;els, with cargoes, amounting to three hundred thou&s;and dollars, had been captured by Briti&s;h privateers, and were then lying at that port, in expectation of a trial. They had applied for it, and had been told in an&s;wer, that they were to be &s;ent for adjudication to Mole St. Nicholas. They &s;tate, that &s;ome of the ve&s;&s;els can|not proceed to that place without con&s;iderable re|pairs: others, had been abandoned by their crews, Some, with their cargoes, were likewi&s;e in a &s;tate of &s;uffering. Many of the petitioners, being entire &s;trangers, were reduced to inconvenience from want of money. Some crews and &s;upercargoes, from &s;ickne&s;s, di&s;appointments, and mortifications, were
<PB N="55" REF="033485_0054_0FF71F65EDC03050">
reduced to the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing circum&s;tances. They affirm, that they had carried on a legal trade, agree|ably to the Briti&s;h treaty. They &s;upplicate that a court of admiralty may be appointed at Port-au-Prince for trying their cau&s;es, and conclude with &s;ome compliments to the per&s;onal character of Sim|coe him&s;elf.</P>
<P>His an&s;wer was haughty and reproachful. He promi&s;ed to recommend to the judge of the ad|miralty, Mr. Combauld, to decide their ca&s;es at an early period; but he gave them no rea&s;on to think that there would be a court erected for that end at Port-au-Prince. He hoped that they would be ac|quitted of that contraband traffic which many ci|tizens of the United States carried on with the French government in St. Domingo. He clo&s;ed with telling them that this illicit trade might, at no remote di&s;tance, <Q>&s;eriou&s;ly di&s;turb the national re|po&s;e, and affect the <HI>&s;ecurity</HI> of the American con|tinent.</Q> This menace appears &s;omewhat inex|plicable. He cannot &s;urely mean that England is to affect our &s;ecurity by land, as a con&s;equence of her having robbed our &s;hips at &s;ea. The lat|ter was, of it&s;elf, enough in all con&s;cience. Thus American ve&s;&s;els are liable to be taken into an Eng|li&s;h port, and to be kept there till their crews de&s;ert, their cargoes &s;poil, and them&s;elves rot for want of an Engli&s;h trial. When no longer capable of &s;ail|ing, they are ordered to make a voyage in que&s;t of adjudication. Mr. Harper and his friends think that they have gained every thing, becau&s;e they have at la&s;t exa&s;perated the French into the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem of privateering, which the Briti&s;h have car|ried on for four years and an half, and in which they &s;till ardently per&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>It would require con&s;iderable room to enume|rate all the Briti&s;h confi&s;cations of American pro|perty
<PB N="56" REF="033485_0055_0FF71F6883AD7B88">
in the We&s;t-Indies, within the la&s;t &s;ix months. Captain Dunlevy remained in Hi&s;paniola from the 9th of June, to the 20th of October, 1797. The following is a &s;ummary of his account, as to Mr. Combauld's operations. Eighteen ve&s;&s;els, with their cargoes, were condemned. Two of the cap|tains of the&s;e &s;hips were detained three months be|fore they could get their papers, which could have been had with ea&s;e in three days, or a much le&s;s time. Another of the&s;e captains died of grief. A nineteenth ve&s;&s;el, with her cargo, was &s;old to pay the co&s;ts of court. A twentieth was cleared, but the cargo condemned. Seven were di&s;charged on paying co&s;ts. This is manife&s;t inju&s;tice; for, if the Engli&s;h were not warranted in &s;eizing them, it was highly oppre&s;&s;ive to make them pay any ex|pence whatever. They &s;hould rather have them reimbur&s;ed for their detention. But what could be expected, when the &s;ame nation were both par|ties and judges? Some others in the above li&s;t were under trial, when captain Dunlevy came away. The whole amount to thirty one, and &s;everal ve&s;|&s;els were likewi&s;e detained, of which the trials had not come on. Many &s;uch details of the pre&s;ent year might be given, as to Engli&s;h piracy. Yet the Adamites always &s;peak as if piracy were confi|ned to the French only.</P>
<P>The relative &s;pirit of the American mini&s;try to|wards the two nations is fully exhibited in the fol|lowing narrative. Citizen Adet had complained to Mr. Pickering re&s;pecting the French corvette L'E&s;perance. She was taken by the Briti&s;h &s;hip Argonaut, who went with her prize into Lynnha|ven bay, in Virginia. According to Adet, the cor|vette was there fitted out by admiral Murray, as a Briti&s;h crui&s;er, and this Adet urged as a violation of the treaty of Paris. Pickering, in his letter to
<PB N="57" REF="033485_0056_0FF71F6D433AF720">
Charles Pinckney, undertakes to an&s;wer this com|plaint. He fir&s;t remarks, that the captain of the corvette, and the French con&s;ul at Norfolk, had both been applied to, and &s;hewed no di&s;po&s;ition to complain of any improper conduct on the part of the captors. Thus far all is well; but Mr. Pick|ering proceeds thus: <Q>the governor (of Virginia) having heard that a re&s;pectable pilot by the name of <HI>Butler,</HI> was acquainted with the circum&s;tan|ces of this affair, he directed his depo&s;ition to be taken; it was taken, and imported, that admiral Murray him&s;elf, purcha&s;ed the prize and manned and fitted her in Lynnhaven bay for a cruize; but Butler's <HI>depo&s;ition</HI> was afterwards taken on the part of the Briti&s;h, in which <HI>he contradicted all the material facts recited in the former depo&s;i|tion,</HI> which he accounted for by &s;aying, that he could neither write nor read, and that there had been in&s;erted in his fir&s;t depo&s;ition what he had never &s;aid <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Me&s;&s;age from the Pre&s;ident, of January 19th 1797, p. 46.</NOTE>.</Q> Mr. Pickering then mentions to Pinckney his anxiety for further information. This had been &s;upplied by the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, Mr. Hammond, in a letter from admiral Murray, who declared that he &s;ent the corvette back to &s;ea, as &s;oon as wind and weather would permit.</P>
<P>From the face of this &s;tory, it &s;eems that our &s;e|cretary of &s;tate acted right. The French con&s;ul and captain, at lea&s;t as he pretends, would have no|thing to do with complaining. Butler, the only evidence again&s;t Murray, retracted upon oath; and &s;ince the admiral him&s;elf denied his having fitted out the L'E&s;perance, as a privateer, Mr. Pickering had no choice but to give him credit.</P>
<P>Now comes the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the que&s;tion. On the 24th of March, 1795, Butler emitted his <HI>fir&s;t</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="033485_0057_0FF71F6F45D79330">
depo&s;ition, purporting, as above, that the corvette was fitted out by admiral Murray, for a privateer. But it is NOT TRUE, as Mr. Pickering affirms, that Butler ever contradicted this te&s;timony in a &s;econd depo&s;ition. That of the 24th of March, 1795, was immediately &s;ent forward to Mr. Pickering, and by the latter communicated to Mr. Hammond, who &s;ent a copy of it to captain Cochrane of the Thetis, which was then under repair at Norfolk. When Cochrane was ready to &s;et &s;ail, he &s;elected Butler, as his pilot; and after the &s;hip had got into Hampton roads, he began to charge the man with having acted as a &s;py on board of Engli&s;h &s;hips. He read in evidence, a copy of Butler's depo&s;ition of the 24th of March, and threatened to carry him off, and treat him as a &s;py. Under tho&s;e circum&s;tances, Cochrane pre&s;ented a paper, which he called of the nature of a counter declaration, and required Butler to &s;ub&s;cribe it. The pilot was glad to &s;ign any thing, rather than run the im|mediate hazard of being carried away from his bu|&s;ine&s;s, his family, and his country; be&s;ides the pro&s;pect of being &s;tarved, flogged, and probably murdered by a gang of barbarians. He was not indulged with a copy of the paper, nor made ac|quainted with its contents. Captain Cochrane did not offer to admini&s;ter an oath.</P>
<P>When Butler got on &s;hore, he made a depo&s;ition before three magi&s;trates of the county of Norfolk, and in pre&s;ence of a number of re&s;pectable citi|zens. He therein related the circum&s;tances of &s;ur|pri&s;e, compul&s;ion, and alarm, under which Coch|rane compelled him to &s;ign a paper contradictory to his depo&s;ition of the 24th of March. This &s;econd depo&s;ition was taken on the 4th of May, 1795, and forwarded to Mr. Pickering. Yet our &s;ecretary, takes not the lea&s;t notice of it, and mode&s;tly gives
<PB N="59" REF="033485_0058_0FF71F71F79F1ED8">
the title of a <HI>depo&s;ition</HI> to the paper obtained by captain Cochrane. The&s;e particulars are abridged from a copious detail furni&s;hed by co|lonel Jo&s;iah Parker, who has been five times elec|ted as a repre&s;entative to congre&s;s, and who, for cla&s;&s;ical propriety of expre&s;&s;ion, is excelled by no &s;peaker in that hou&s;e. This gentlemen has docu|ments for proving what is above related. After this explanation, it will be difficult to defend the vera|city of colonel Pickering. Mr. Wa&s;hington, along with a copy of this letter to Pinckney, &s;ent to con|gre&s;s, as u&s;ual, an introductory me&s;&s;age. It con|cludes in the&s;e words: <Q>A government which required only a knowledge of the <HI>truth</HI> to ju&s;tify its mea&s;ures, could not but be anxious to have this fully and frankly di&s;played.</Q> Canting is always &s;u&s;picious. Mr. Wa&s;hington, in the una|voidable exerci&s;e of his mind, <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have known that this inflammatory letter contained other bun|gling attempts at impo&s;ture, as well as that about the Norfolk pilot. Such cobwebs may la&s;t for a day, but the bru&s;h of hi&s;tory quickly &s;weeps them down, and con&s;igns them to their native dunghill.</P>
<P>This is the cabinet that makes &s;o much noi&s;e about its <HI>morality.</HI> From contemplating the pre&s;ent &s;ecretary of &s;tate, we naturally turn to one of his predece&s;&s;ors. For a long time before Thomas Jef|fer&s;on re&s;igned his place, the federal prints were diligent in reproaching him, as unworthy to be en|tru&s;ted with &s;o high an office. Since he gave it up, they have cen&s;ured him for a re&s;ignation, of which they were extremely glad. The Minerva con|tains a letter, copied into a Jer&s;ey Gazette, of October 11th, 1797, which has the&s;e words: <Q>The good and the wi&s;e &s;aw him &s;uddenly retreat from a po&s;t of honour, and e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice, at a mo|ment, when his country was in a &s;ituation &s;o cri|tical
<PB N="60" REF="033485_0059_0FF71F7571CDF830">
as to require all the efforts of wi&s;dom, and the po&s;ture of firmne&s;s and dignity.</Q></P>
<P>If Mr. Jeffer&s;on is &s;o dangerous a man as the &s;ix per cent. writers have con&s;tantly repre&s;ented him to be, it was un&s;uitable to regret his retreat. Ame|rica was well rid of him. But the&s;e &s;cribblers had terms to keep with the great body of citizens, upon whom his abilities and his &s;ervices had made a la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion. His retirement was heard of with uni|ver&s;al concern, unle&s;s among the immediate leaders and agents of the &s;tock-holding and Briti&s;h faction; and with them it was nece&s;&s;ary to conceal their triumph. Enlightened men looked around them, and &s;aw no other character capable to fill the gap. Motives of prudence compel Mr. Jeffer&s;on's ad|ver&s;aries, Phocion excepted, to &s;peak with defer|ence of his talents.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of re&s;ignation may be told in a few words. The late pre&s;ident has a re&s;erved &s;ullen temper, which of it&s;elf mu&s;t be extremely tire&s;ome. He had likewi&s;e a &s;trong bias to the Hamiltonian and Antigallican &s;y&s;tem, &s;o that Mr. Jeffer&s;on found him&s;elf in very frequent minorities. When the three &s;ecretaries, and Mr. Randolph, attorney ge|neral, were convened with the pre&s;ident, report &s;ays, that Randolph u&s;ed to argue on the &s;ide of Jeffer|&s;on, and when the vote came, to agree with Knox and Hamilton. To a man of independent fortune, and of a literary turn, this &s;ituation could have no charms; and as few aro&s;e from the emoluments of office. The&s;e rea&s;ons form a good apology for his retiring; as the events that &s;ucceeded his re|treat, compo&s;e the be&s;t encomium on his abilities. Within three &s;hort months thereafter, the pre&s;ident &s;tumbled into that pit of de&s;truction, the plan for a Briti&s;h treaty. The next four months produced what Mr. Hamilton cho&s;e to call a <HI>rebellion.</HI> All the
<PB N="61" REF="033485_0060_0FF71F77081DED38">
re&s;t of our hi&s;tory has been as calamitous as it well could be, when &s;hort of actual war. At la&s;t, matters grew &s;o very bad, that general Wa&s;hington him&s;elf dur&s;t no longer hold the helm. If re&s;ignation, at a critical moment, be culpable, the charge falls a thou&s;and times more heavily on the pre&s;ident than on his &s;ecretary.</P>
<P>And here, in&s;tead of what has been done, let fancy &s;uppo&s;e what might have been done, &s;ince the fatal 16th of April, 1794, if Mr. Jeffer&s;on, with a &s;ound majority of congre&s;s to &s;upport him, had conducted the admini&s;tration of America. In&s;tead of aukward in&s;tructions, which the executive blu&s;hed to pro|duce, the me&s;&s;age would have been open, conci&s;e, and deci&s;ive; and the repre&s;entatives would have been con&s;ulted about it. "Send back," it would &s;ay, <Q>our impre&s;&s;ed fellow citizens, with double wages for the time of their detention. Send back our ve&s;&s;els, taken in contempt of ju&s;tice. The &s;ubject is complicated, and will require time. But as a pledge of your &s;incerity, depo&s;it in our trea&s;ury before hand, a million of dollars, for the relief of the families of impre&s;&s;ed &s;eamnen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notice, on this head, the whining of Mr. Pickering. When a&s;&s;igning the motives for Jay's mi&s;&s;ion, he &s;ays,&mdash;<Q>Did not the im|pre&s;&s;ment of our &s;eamen, like the &s;poliations on our commerce, ex|cite an univer&s;al complaint?</Q> Letter to Pinckney, p. 15.

<P>By this firm but rea&s;onable tone, England might have learned to re&s;pect the United States. France,
<PB N="62" REF="033485_0061_0FF71F79985435E0">
courting their amity, would have re&s;trained her crui&s;ers, as &s;he actually did, till July, 1796, when &s;he heard of the final ratification of the Briti&s;h trea|ty, which is the confe&s;&s;ed cau&s;e of her pre&s;ent de|predations.</P>
<P>As for the we&s;tern in&s;urrection, Mr. Jeffer&s;on has never expre&s;&s;ed impatience for the burning of Pitt&s;|burgh; of cour&s;e, he would have quelled the riots in their infancy, at an expence of five hundred dol|lars. In&s;tead of refu&s;ing to pay the militia who burnt Nickajack, in&s;tead of inveighing again&s;t de|mocratic &s;ocieties, and boa&s;ting of Creek friend&s;hip, he would have authori&s;ed generals Clarke and Pick|ens to enter the country of the&s;e cut-throats, at the head of five thou&s;and men, to teach them &s;ome re&s;pect for treaties, and &s;ome dread for offended ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The writer in the Minerva proceeds to declaim upon a letter &s;aid to be written from Mr. Jeffer&s;on to one Mazzei at Florence. Much clutter has been made about this piece, which, unfortunately for the enemies of Mr. Jeffer&s;on, contains only &s;trict truth. The following is the mo&s;t intere&s;ting part of it.</P>
<P><Q>Our political &s;ituation is prodigiou&s;ly changed &s;ince you left us. In&s;tead of that noble love of liberty, and that republican government, which carried us triumphantly through the dangers of the war, an Anglo-monarchico-ari&s;tocratic par|ty has ari&s;en.&mdash;Their avowed object is to impo&s;e on us the &s;ub&s;tance, as they have already given us the form, of the Briti&s;h government. Never|thele&s;s, the principal body of our citizens remains faithful to republican principles. All our pro|prietors of lands are friendly to tho&s;e principles, as al&s;o the ma&s;s of men of talents. We have again&s;t us (republicans) the executive power, the judiciary power, (two of the three branches

of our government,) all the officers of govern|ment, all who are &s;eeking offices, all timid men, who prefer the calm of de&s;poti&s;m to the tempe&s;tu|ous &s;ea of liberty, the Brit&s;h merchants and the Americans who trade on Briti&s;h capitals, the &s;peculators, per&s;ons intere&s;ted in the bank and the public funds; e&s;tabli&s;hments invented with views of corruption, and to a&s;&s;imilate us to the Briti&s;h model in its corrupt parts.</Q></P>
<P>This letter was originally tran&s;lated from a French new&s;paper by Web&s;ter, who &s;poke of it as if it had been <HI>trea&s;on.</HI> That an Engli&s;h faction has ari&s;en, and obtained an undue influence in govern|ment, can hardly be denied, when, be&s;ides a mil|lion of other traits, we &s;ee one pre&s;ident after ano|ther haranguing again&s;t French piracy, and pa&s;&s;ing over in guarded &s;ilence, the &s;ea-robberies of Britain. The con&s;titution, of which the letter &s;peaks, is, upon the whole, a good in&s;trument, but liable to numerous and important objections. One of the&s;e is the immen&s;e patronage be&s;towed on the pre&s;ident, and a &s;econd, the univer&s;al negative of the &s;enate. It has been &s;hewn<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of 1796, Chap. VIII.</NOTE>, that a pre&s;ident, with eleven &s;enators to help him, can ab&s;olutely &s;top the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the legi&s;lature. This may be called re|pre&s;entative government, but it is evidently the dregs of monarchy and ari&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>The &s;ame piece in the Minerva, that has been above cited, &s;peaks of Virginia as uncommonly prone to in&s;urrection. The American Annual Regi&s;|ter, and the Hi&s;tory of 1796, comprehend a variety of remarks in an&s;wer to the calumnies heaped upon that &s;tate by the federal party. The &s;ubject has not, however, been exhau&s;ted, and it is of infinite con|cern to undeceive the people who may have been
<PB N="64" REF="033485_0063_0FF71F7FE636C2B8">
mi&s;led by their artifices. The fact then is, that if true republicani&s;m, if a genuine &s;en&s;e of order and of freedom, &s;hall be driven from every other &s;tate in the union, their la&s;t &s;tand will be made in Virgi|nia. Previous to the actual commencement of ho&s;|tilities in 1775, little or nothing was heard of mobs in that province; for its inhabitants were &s;en&s;ible that the burning of effigies, the bedaubing of a de|fencele&s;s individual with tar and feathers, was not the way to reflect honour on a &s;truggle for inde|pendence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not here affirmed that <HI>nothing</HI> of that kind may have taken place; but that, upon the whole, the behaviour of the colony was exemplary.</NOTE>. While the Briti&s;h new&s;papers were fil|led with the noi&s;y and tumultuous proceedings of other colonies, Virginia remained in comparative order and tranquility. Her loyalty was a con&s;tant &s;ubject of mini&s;terial exultation; for it &s;eemed plain enough, that if &s;he &s;tood by the old country, all the projects of New-England were to end in di&s;appoint|ment. When matters, however, came to an extremi|ty, it was found, that Virginia was as zealous in the common cau&s;e as any other &s;tate, and much more &s;o than mo&s;t of them. Connecticut tories &s;upported a bloody &s;hare in the partizan war of the frontiers. Mr. Williams, one of the repre&s;entatives of New-York, &s;aid, la&s;t winter, in congre&s;s, that at the commencement of the revolution, one half of the people of that &s;tate were tories. In Penn&s;ylvania, the revolutionary party never could have &s;tood upon their legs, but by the concurrence of Iri&s;h emi|grants. In the two Carolinas and Georgia, the peo|ple fought de&s;perately among them&s;elves. But it is believed that, during the whole war, no body of Virginian citizens ever rai&s;ed the Briti&s;h &s;tandard. They did not even &s;ubmit, when Briti&s;h armies entered the &s;tate. Ram&s;ay &s;ays, that, in general,
<PB N="65" REF="033485_0064_0FF71F8177D672E8">
they cho&s;e to retire out of the way, when Corn|wallis was burning all before him. In battle they were inferior to no troops in the union. The &s;a|vages, whom they &s;ubdued, u&s;ed to &s;ay, that Vir|ginia was <HI>the great knife.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;tate, &s;o frequently &s;tigmatized as <HI>anti-federal,</HI> was the very fir&s;t that &s;ugge&s;ted a fede|ral union. In 1785, this propo&s;al was made in the Virginian hou&s;e of delegates. In con&s;e|quence, an imperfect continental convention was, in 1786, held at Annapolis, and this proved the &s;eed|bed of that convention which formed the pre&s;ent con&s;titution. "Virginia," &s;ays Mor&s;e, <Q>has taken a leading, active, and influential part in bringing about the late grand revolution in our federal government<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">American Geography, London Edition of 1792, p. 400.</NOTE>.</Q> Ever &s;ince that time, the &s;tate has remained in tranquility, and in perfect &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to the laws. To Virginia, America is, in a a great mea&s;ure, indebted both for her indepen|dence, and her pre&s;ent con&s;titution. To upbraid her then, as antifederal, is the very pinnacle of in|gratitude, of audacity, and fiction.</P>
<P>The &s;tock-jobbing party accu&s;e this &s;tate as de|&s;irous of a war with England. No Virginian above ideoti&s;m, &s;hould ever de&s;ire a foreign war. Inter|&s;ected almo&s;t throughout by navigable &s;treams, Virginia lies more open to the ravages of a mari|time enemy than any other &s;tate in the union. This truth was &s;everely felt during the war of 1775; and con&s;equently, this will be one of the la&s;t &s;tates that would ever wi&s;h for actual ho&s;tility. The cla|mour excited again&s;t her, as anxious for a war with England, is, only a branch of the <HI>truly federal</HI> &s;y&s;|tem of impo&s;ture.</P>
<P>Virginia has been reproached for permitting the continuance of &s;lavery. But we have the authority
<PB N="66" REF="033485_0065_0FF71F84055E7360">
of Mr. Jeffer&s;on <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notes on Virginia.</NOTE> for &s;aying, that, long before the revolution, the &s;tate wanted to prohibit the impor|tation of &s;laves; a mea&s;ure prevented by England. In 1786, the a&s;&s;embly, by an act, put an end to this vile commerce; and a general abolition is gradu|ally going forward. In a petition, lately pre&s;ented to congre&s;s, by &s;ome negroes, it tran&s;pired, that Virginia affords an a&s;ylum to fugitive &s;laves from the more &s;outhern &s;tates. She does not, with the &s;avagene&s;s of North-Carolina, prohibit their eman|cipation. While Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts connives at eccle|&s;ia&s;tical oppre&s;&s;ion, Virginia has e&s;tabli&s;hed an uni|ver&s;al right of con&s;cience, and no man is obliged to pay for religion, unle&s;s he plea&s;es. The clergymen of New-England, or a part of them, cannot avoid being much hurt at a precedent, &s;o dangerous to the commercial intere&s;t of the church; and they have, undoubtedly, &s;welled the torrent of calumny with which Virginia has been overwhelmed in the ea&s;tern &s;tates.</P>
<P>The vindication of Virginia has been taken up in this place, becau&s;e the federal party appear very much di&s;po&s;ed to extrude her from the union. Ma|ny of their projects and menaces are &s;o clo&s;ely in|terwoven with downright madne&s;s, that it &s;eems difficult to believe the &s;incerity of the party. And yet, after their attempt for a conditional rejection of three foreign treaties, unle&s;s they could obtain a fourth; after their propo&s;ed &s;tanding army of twen|ty-five thou&s;and men<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">American Annual Regi&s;ter.</NOTE>; their doctrine of partitioning the United States<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>; their French war; their Mexi|can excur&s;ion, with other frenzies equally wild and di&s;tracted, wonder cea&s;es at the propo&s;ed extru|&s;ion of Virginia; or, as Web&s;ter and other federal writers term it, a &s;eparation from the whole &s;ou|thern
<PB N="67" REF="033485_0066_0FF71F87EE648A88">
&s;tates. By &s;uch a disjunction, the continent, as to all its external relations, would &s;ink into the lowe&s;t in&s;ignificance and wretchedne&s;s. Yet a Connecticut new&s;printer has publi&s;hed a &s;eries of letters in defence of this propo&s;ed &s;eparation; which, among other effects, implies an immedi|ate annihilation of public and private credit, and con&s;equently of the national debt. The federal party revile Virginia, becau&s;e its members in con|gre&s;s have con&s;tantly oppo&s;ed their funding &s;y&s;tem, the overgrowth of pre&s;idential influence, and other matters connected with the&s;e. Yet if left to them|&s;elves, Mr. Sedgwick and Co. would long &s;ince have extingui&s;hed the pre&s;ent government, the funds, and all together. If they can ju&s;t now en|tangle the union in a French war, this cata&s;trophe may &s;till be expected. The following anecdote di&s;plays the genuine &s;pirit of the &s;tockholding party.</P>
<P><Q>When the bill for e&s;tabli&s;hing a national bank was under con&s;ideration, he (Mr. Madi&s;on) had oppo&s;ed it, as <HI>not warranted in the con&s;titution,</HI> and incidently remarked, that in the convention a motion was made and negatived, for giving congre&s;s a power to grant charters of corpora|tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bache's Debates on the Briti&s;h Treaty, vol. I. p. 378.</NOTE>.</Q> Mr. Madi&s;on &s;ubjoins, that, for this &s;light reference to the convention, he was attacked by &s;everal &s;peakers, and among others by Mr. Gerry of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, who had been a member of the convention.</P>
<P>On the &s;ubject of this bank, Mr. Alexander Hamilton gave in to congre&s;s a report, dated 13th of December, 1790, and which fills twenty-one folio pages. He &s;ays not a &s;ingle word as to its be|ing authori&s;ed by the con&s;titution, which undoubt|edly
<PB N="68" REF="033485_0067_0FF71F8A9F48D9A0">
gives no &s;uch power. But here we learn that it was directly negatived by the framers of that in|&s;trument; and expre&s;sly contradicted the &s;pirit and de&s;ign of it. Indeed, a power of creating corporations, would have ve&s;ted in congre&s;s an op|pre&s;&s;ive degree of influence, repugnant to the geni|us of a free government.</P>
<P>Mr. Madi&s;on was cen&s;ured for referring to what pa&s;&s;ed in the convention. When an ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;age occurs in a living author, the be&s;t mode of expla|nation is by an appeal to him&s;elf. When a bond or indenture appears ambiguous, the &s;ure&s;t way to get its meaning is, by enquiry at the parties who drew and &s;ub&s;cribed it. The reference to the conven|tion was, therefore, &s;trictly proper; and Gerry, and others who objected to it, betrayed impene|trable effrontery. The bare omi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch power in the con&s;titution, was enough to warrant the re|jection of the plan; but when the point had been ab&s;olutely debated and negatived in the convention, this added, if po&s;&s;ible, to the &s;trength of the ca&s;e. Congre&s;s had &s;worn to &s;upport the con&s;titution. By pa&s;&s;ing the law for incorporating the bank of the United States, they, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, broke their own oaths of office, and violated the con&s;ti|tution. So far from pocketing the reproof for refer|ence, Mr. Madi&s;on and his friends ought to have adverti&s;ed, in the new&s;papers, the true picture of this enormous &s;tride of venality. Yet this junto af|fect peculiar reverence for the con&s;titution; and hold them&s;elves out as its exclu&s;ive guardians. All who que&s;tion their purity are its enemies. What a&s;toni&s;hing hardine&s;s!</P>
<P>Gerry, and great part of his majority, were de&s;|tined to be partners of the future bank, thus found|ed on a breach of the con&s;titution. The&s;e are the immaculate legi&s;lators whom Virginia dete&s;ts, and
<PB N="69" REF="033485_0068_0FF71F8D2514AD00">
Connecticut admires. If the fir&s;t federal congre&s;s wanted the comprehen&s;ive information, the dignity of &s;entiment, and enthu&s;ia&s;m of eloquence, that &s;ometimes mark a Briti&s;h parliament, they did not fall &s;hort of the &s;ervility, meanne&s;s, and cor|ruption of its blacke&s;t era.</P>
<P>A writer in the New-Jer&s;ey <HI>Centinel of Freedom,</HI> of January, 1797, has well drawn the portrait of &s;uch parti&s;ans as Web&s;ter. <Q>The writer of this paragraph," &s;ays he, "by good government only means the Hamiltonian admini&s;tration; by good order, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to this admini&s;tration; by federal ticket, a ticket favourable to this admi|ni&s;tration; and by peace, peace with England and war with France. It is curious to ob&s;erve with what effrontery &s;ome people talk of good government, good order, peace, and federali&s;m. Every one knows that the Hamiltonian par|ty have di&s;covered a much greater di&s;po&s;ition towards antifederali&s;m than their political oppo|nents; for they have on all occa&s;ions endeavour|ed to <HI>quarrel with the &s;outhern &s;tates,</HI> and di&s;|affect them to the union. Their love of order has only been di&s;covered by their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to an admini&s;tration under their own controul; but as &s;oon as the majority of the hou&s;e of repre|&s;entatives checked their progre&s;s to dominion, they immediately became refractory, abu&s;ive, and attempted to menace the immediate repre|&s;entatives of the people into an unconditional compliance with their will: their love of peace has only been &s;hewn by an humiliating &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Briti&s;h in&s;olence and depredation, and in a pro&s;tituted commendation of a treaty that has tar|ni&s;hed the lu&s;tre of America.</Q></P>
<P>The ful&s;ome compliments which have con|&s;tantly pa&s;&s;ed between the pre&s;ident and congre&s;s,
<PB N="70" REF="033485_0069_0FF71F8EB451F390">
betray that &s;pirit of monarchy, of which the letter to Mazzei complains. This &s;ervility is carried far|ther by congre&s;s than in the Briti&s;h hou&s;e of com|mons, where a royal &s;peech is always criticized with freedom and minutene&s;s. Among other en|comiums bandied between Mr. Wa&s;hington and the fir&s;t congre&s;s, one turned on his accepting of no &s;alary but for his per&s;onal expences. <Q>I mu&s;t decline," &s;ays he, "as inapplicable to my&s;elf, any &s;hare in the per&s;onal emoluments.&mdash;And pray that the pecuniary e&s;timates for the &s;tation in which I am placed, may, during my continuance in it, be limited to &s;uch actual expenditures as the public good may be <HI>thought to require.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The an&s;wer of the repre&s;entatives, dated May 5th, 1789, tells him that this re&s;triction, <Q>cannot fail to demon&s;trate the <HI>purity,</HI> whil&s;t it increa&s;es the <HI>lu&s;tre</HI> of a character, which has &s;o many ti|tles to <HI>admiration!</HI></Q> Thus they began, and thus they have ever &s;ince gone on. Of all the vulgar artifices for popularity ever heard of, this as to accepting of no &s;alary is perhaps the mo&s;t pitiful; and yet &s;uch has been public infatuation, that, while drawing for every cent of his allowance, general Wa&s;hington has been celebrated for refu|&s;ing to take more than his net hou&s;hold charges. The granting of &s;o large a &s;um had bad effects, by adding the wet of avarice to that of ambition.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS our pre&s;idents and friends of order, are &s;o wonderfully delicate on the &s;ubject of Engli&s;h piracies and impre&s;&s;ments, this chapter &s;hall begin with &s;ome recent anecdotes of that kind. Every federal artifice has been employed, from the two &s;peeches of Mr. Adams to congre&s;s, down to the &s;currilous paragraphs in Mr. Fenno's gazette, with the view of exciting the tempe&s;t of public indig|nation again&s;t France. A &s;ummary, like that which follows, will help to pre&s;erve in equipoi&s;e the ba|lance of re&s;entment.</P>
<P>On the 27th of July, 1797, Nathaniel Sil&s;bee, cap|tain of the &s;hip Bet&s;ey, addre&s;&s;ed a letter to the prin|ter of a Salem new&s;paper. He had arrived at Sa|lem three days before, from Madras. He left in that port nine Engli&s;h &s;hips of war. One of the&s;e was the Sybille frigate, captain Cook, who pre&s;&s;ed from captain Sil&s;bee Edward Hulen, a native of Salem. He al&s;o threatened that if complaint &s;hould be made by Sil&s;bee to the governor, on &s;hore, he would not only take every &s;eamen, but al&s;o every officer from the Bet&s;ey. He did not commit this violence from &s;carcity of hands; for he told cap|tain Sil&s;bee that he had thirty-five men <HI>over and
<PB N="72" REF="033485_0071_0FF71F967A6CF860">
above his &s;hip's complement.</HI> He added, that he be|lieved fifteen of them to be real American born citizens. He &s;aid that he had pre&s;&s;ed them from on board of American &s;hips at Li&s;bon, in &s;pite of the remon&s;trances of the American con&s;ul at that place. Cooke farther declared, that he would keep the&s;e men in perfect &s;ecurity, till the end of the war.</P>
<P>After the impre&s;&s;ment of Hulen, the Bet&s;ey was daily vi&s;ited by a lieutenant from the Sy|bille. During his &s;tay on board, this officer took full command of the &s;hip, mu&s;tered the crew regularly on the quarter deck, and would not &s;uf|fer any &s;hip's duty to be carried on at the&s;e times. He farther threatened to correct the American officers for not manning the &s;hip's &s;ide, and paying him &s;uch re&s;pect as he &s;aid that the pre&s;ence of any Briti&s;h officer ought to command. Hulen has left an aged and di&s;con&s;olate mother, who depended entirely for &s;upport upon her &s;on. Cap|tain Sil&s;bee adds that &s;everal other American &s;eamen were, about the &s;ame time, pre&s;&s;ed from other Ame|rican &s;hips at Madras. The ca&s;e of Edward Hulen, mu&s;t afflict every friend to the United States. But it will give joy to that Briti&s;h junto, in this city, who, by a recent mea&s;ure, have done their utmo&s;t for promoting a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. The late and pre&s;ent be|haviour of American tories afford an able vindi|cation for the prudent &s;everity of the French re|public.</P>
<P>A letter from a Philadelphian captain, dated Cape Nicholas Mole, 13th July, 1797, gives the following account. Off Tortuga, his ve&s;&s;el, which was bound for Gonaives, a French port, was taken by an En|gli&s;h frigate. That &s;ame evening, while the &s;hips were lying within twenty yards of each other, the frigate fired a twelve pound &s;hot <Q>in hopes to &s;ink
<PB N="73" REF="033485_0072_0FF71F99054AF718">
me,</Q> &s;ays the captain. On arriving at Cape Ni|cholas, his papers were examined, and returned; but government would neither buy his provi&s;ions, nor permit him to proceed on his voyage; <Q>they pay no attention to the treaty here.</Q> The rea|&s;on for detaining him &s;eems to have been le&s;t he &s;hould &s;ail for a French port; as he &s;ubjoins that he was to &s;ail for King&s;ton by the fir&s;t convoy. The captain further &s;ays that the Engli&s;h bring in for adjudication all American ve&s;&s;els going to or co|ming from French ports. Tho&s;e <HI>going to</HI> are libel|led for having in their invoices nails and knives, French letters, French &s;upercargoes; or in &s;hort any trifle &s;erves as a pretence, and they are gene|rally condemned. Tho&s;e <HI>coming from</HI> French i&s;lands are libelled for having coffee on board, &s;hip|ped by the French admini&s;tration, and are generally condemned as <HI>French Amoricans.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Engli&s;h con&s;ider Jay's tran&s;action as a mere je&s;t. The twenty fifth article of that paper &s;ays that <Q>nothing in this treaty contained &s;hall, however, be con&s;trued or operate contrary to former and exi&s;ting public treaties with other &s;o|vereigns or &s;tates.</Q> Now, before this war began, England did not pretend that &s;he had any title to &s;top American ve&s;&s;els bound to a French port; nor did &s;he ever attempt to &s;top them. The violation would not have been endured in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, and was in it&s;elf too extravagant ever to have been projected.</P>
<P>By the twenty-third article of the treaty of com|merce, &s;igned at Paris, in 1778, it is declared, that "free &s;hips &s;hall al&s;o give a freedom to goods;" thus, that Engli&s;h property in an American &s;hip &s;hall be &s;ecure from a French privateer. The twenty-fifth clau&s;e of Jay, as ju&s;t now quoted, com|prehends a protection of the treaty of Paris; and
<PB N="74" REF="033485_0073_0FF71F9AD8547848">
yet, in practice, the Engli&s;h have broken it many hundreds of times, to the entire ruin of a multitude both of French and American citizens. They were not contented with this. They &s;eized, al&s;o, Ameri|can ve&s;&s;els bound to or from French i&s;lands, which tended directly to de&s;troy the trade of the latter. Thus the French were put upon the mo&s;t unequal and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing footing. They were not to interrupt American trade with the Engli&s;h We&s;t-Indies, while England was de&s;troying American trade with the French We&s;t-Indies. In&s;tead of interfering, our pal&s;ied executive, through the medium of the &s;enate, were encouraging Mr. Fenno to publi&s;h daily co|lumns of invective again&s;t the French revolution.</P>
<P>It was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that any people, and much le&s;s that a people intoxicated with victory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The French government lately publi&s;hed a &s;tatement on this head, from the 8th of September, 1793, to the 10th of February, 1797. The republic has, by this account, gained thirty one pitched battles, and two hundred and thirty le&s;&s;er actions. Her troops have killed an hundred and fifty-two thou&s;and, &s;ix hundred men; and taken, an hundred and ninety-&s;even thou&s;and, &s;even hundred and eighty-four pri&s;oners; &s;even thou&s;and, nine hundred, and &s;ixty-three pieces of cannon; an hundred and eighty-&s;ix thou&s;and, &s;even hun|dred and &s;ixty-two firelocks; four millions, three hundred and eighty-eight thou&s;and pounds weight of powder, and five hundred and fifty-&s;even important cities, or camps, forts, redoubts, and other places of &s;trength.</P>
<P>This is &s;uch a catalogue of &s;ucce&s;s, as, perhaps, no other nation ever could exhibit. The number of the &s;lain is certainly not magni|fied. Tho&s;e who peri&s;hed in ho&s;pitals were, mo&s;t likely, four times as numerous.</P></NOTE>, were long to endure &s;uch partial treatment as that above de&s;cribed, without feeling re&s;entment and meditating vengeance. The frigid neglect of Mr. Wa&s;hington has been &s;ucceded by the boyi&s;h petu|lence, or factious malignity of Mr. Adams; and both have gone directly to the extirpation of the Ameri|can mercantile intere&s;t. Had Mr. Jeffer&s;on been elected pre&s;ident, France would have placed &s;ome
<PB N="75" REF="033485_0074_0FF71F9FE51B0218">
confidence in the known purity of his republican principles. This national choice, would have held out a kind of pledge for the general good will of the citizens of the United States; and the deluge of commercial de&s;olation mu&s;t, in that ca&s;e, have had a fair chance for being, in &s;ome degree, &s;u&s;pended. But when the French found, that Mr. Adams, the friend of England, was rai&s;ed to the chair, they fore&s;aw that extremities were to be the &s;ole re|&s;ource.</P>
<P>And here it is grateful to ob&s;erve, how com|pletely deceit has over&s;hot its mark. With many honourable exceptions, the great body of the mer|cantile intere&s;t, in this city, is devoted to England, as exi&s;ting, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, by credit obtained in that country. The printed ticket, the ballot-box, and po&s;t-office manoeuvres, as well as the <HI>legal opinion,</HI> &s;o timeou&s;ly tendered, during the late elec|tion for pre&s;ident, were the work of the federal party, of whom our Briti&s;h merchants compo&s;e &s;uch a powerful divi&s;ion. Having, by the mo&s;t &s;candalous artifices, obtained the election of Mr. Adams, as pre&s;ident, they now reap the fruits of it in the ruin of their trade, and the probability of a French war, into which their hero is &s;training every nerve to plunge them. Had they permitted the election to proceed in an hone&s;t way, Mr. Jeffer&s;on mu&s;t have been pre&s;ident, and our affairs with France might have been in a train of accommodation.</P>
<P>The letter from the We&s;t-Indies, la&s;t quoted, has neither the name of the &s;hip nor captain, and this might afford room for doubting its authenticity. But the &s;ub&s;tance of its contents has been verified from a thou&s;and other channels. The printer of the Philadelphia Gazette has no di&s;po&s;ition to tell faults of England, but on the be&s;t evidence. The &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the ve&s;&s;el's name ari&s;es, mo&s;t likely,
<PB N="76" REF="033485_0075_0FF71FA174A8E948">
from the prudence of its owner. His bills, indor&s;ed by &s;ome federal friend, are, probably, lying pro|te&s;ted at the banks; and the guilt of having &s;ent &s;uch a piece to the pre&s;s, would be an adequate rea&s;on for &s;ending <HI>him</HI> to pri&s;on. He mu&s;t know little of the paper-money party, who fancies them incapable of &s;uch a proce&s;s. It will be wonderful indeed, if, before this time, the Scotch tories at Norfolk, have not commenced the ruin of the pilot Butler.</P>
<P>It is not true, by the way, that even yet the French univer&s;ally capture American &s;hips. Here follows an in&s;tance to the contrary. On July 28th, 1797, the &s;chooner William, captain Linnel, arriv|ed at Norfolk, from Grenada. On the 4th current, while in company with a &s;chooner, of and for New-London, two French privateers brought them too. After examining their papers, the French told them that they had particular orders not to &s;top or di&s;|turb any American ve&s;&s;el, and were very &s;orry for having put them out of their cour&s;e. The mate of the William had &s;ix hundred dollars under his care, and they told him that he had no occa&s;ion to hide them, as they &s;hould take nothing but what appeared to be Engli&s;h property. A French &s;ailor was &s;everely threatened by his captain for attempting to &s;teal a pig. On the 23d of May, 1797, James Hammond, an American &s;eaman, was pre&s;&s;ed from the &s;hip Hope of New-York, captain Pierce, at Madeira. This was done by captain James, of the Briti&s;h brig of war, El Cor&s;o. Some days after, the &s;ame brig impre&s;&s;ed five others of his men, two of whom were, with difficulty, recovered. Hammond and other three were kept. On the 28th of June, the brig Abigail, capt. Lake, while lying in the port of Gi|braltar, was boarded by the Hamadryade, a Briti&s;h frigate. Four of his crew were forcibly taken away.

Two of them had been recently redeemed from &s;lavery at Algiers. Captain Lake, who gave this account, arrived at Philadelphia on the 31&s;t of Augu&s;t, 1797. Other in&s;tances of Briti&s;h impre&s;&s;|ment might be collected, but the&s;e are &s;ufficient for a &s;ample of the admirable effects of our Briti&s;h al|liance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A Bo&s;ton new&s;paper, of December 8th, 1797, has the following &s;ingular &s;pecimen of Briti&s;h friend&s;hip. Captain Coffin, in the Joanna of Nantucket, had &s;ailed on a voyage to the South &s;ea whale fi&s;hery. After great hard&s;hips in attempting to double Cape Horn, he returned to Fi&s;hby to repair. He would then have made a plentiful cargo, but was prevented by a Briti&s;h letter of marque, the captain whereof had orders not to let any American ve&s;&s;el catch fi&s;h, till the Briti&s;h &s;hips were &s;upplied. Thus captain Coffin lay idle during half the &s;ea&s;on, till the letter of marque &s;ailed away. The Briti&s;h fi&s;hers then &s;uffered him to proceed in his bu&s;ine&s;s; but they &s;hewed him a pro|clamation, excluding all American ve&s;&s;els from killing whales, till the Briti&s;h had left the &s;tation.</P>
<P>As the United States have, for &s;ome years pa&s;t, become a mere receptacle for external indignities, no trifle of this kind can be &s;up|po&s;ed to make an impre&s;&s;ion.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of 1796, exhibits oceans of demon|&s;tration that the dread of a Briti&s;h war, in the event of congre&s;s rejecting Jay's bargain, was the joint of offspring of ignorance, and knavery. Dr. Smith, Mr. Sedgwick, and the other &s;ix per cent. leaders, panted for nothing &s;o much as alliance with a monarchy, which furni&s;hed ample prece|dents for every &s;pecies of financial corruption, and which held their political opponents in mortal ab|horrence. The merchants kept in view compen|&s;ation for previous piracies, a perpetuity and ex|ten&s;ion of their Briti&s;h credit, and the dome&s;tic danger of per&s;ecution from the banks, if they re|jected this conclu&s;ive &s;tep of the Hami<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nian &s;y&s;|tem. The people, at large, who could have no intere&s;t but that of their country, believed a&s;&s;er|tions, which the timid republican repre&s;entatives hardly ventured to contradict. Thus was the wel|fare
<PB N="78" REF="033485_0077_0FF71FA762B56040">
of the United States &s;acrificed to the &s;hort-&s;ighted pro&s;pects of intere&s;t and fear. General infa|tuation overlooked the moral certainty that France, having already broke down one half of Europe, would demand and extort from America a tenfold atonement for the ungrateful and injurious prefer|ence given to the mo&s;t dete&s;ted of her enemies.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on of repentance and degredation has at length arrived. Like Ce&s;ar's ides of March, it has come, but it has not gone. On this head, the Ma|ryland Journal of June 18th, 1796, contains a few remarks that, like the prophecies of Ca&s;&s;andra, will find belief when it is too late. They were oc|ca&s;ioned by the capture of the Mount Vernon, a few days before, and are as follows.</P>
<Q><P>Phoedrus, tells a &s;tory of a man with whom two females were in love. His hair was half black and half grey. One of his admirers pul|led out all the grey hairs to make him look young; and the other all the black hairs to make him look o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> He very &s;oon became bald.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent condition of American commerce may be quoted as a corrollary to this fable. On one hand, the Briti&s;h, under the mo&s;t frivolous or &s;candalous pretences, &s;eize, plunder, and confi&s;cate American ve&s;&s;els, beat or pre&s;s the crew, and in the ca&s;e of Mr. Bo&s;&s;on, murder the captain. On the other hand, the French captain of the Flying Fi&s;h deliberately leaves his dwelling hou&s;e at No. 399, North Front-&s;treet, Philadel|phia, goes aboard of his ve&s;&s;el, &s;ails down the ri|ver, captures one of our merchantmen, and &s;hews the ma&s;ter a li&s;t of others which he is re&s;olved to take. He then &s;tands in for the coa&s;t, turns the crew into a pilot boat, gives them his name and addre&s;s, and tells them that he has orders to
<PB N="79" REF="033485_0078_0FF71FA9F0164998">
&s;eize every ve&s;&s;el which he knew or even <HI>&s;u&s;pec|ted</HI> of being bound to or from Britain.</P>
<P>Thus the head of the axe is at once buried in the root of our commerce. Citizen Paris plain|ly con&s;iders him&s;elf as acting by legal authority. He does not hide his candle under a bu&s;hel. He has re&s;ided in Philadelphia, where his family and hou&s;hold furniture are &s;till very likely to be found, and where he is him&s;elf well known. When boarding the Mount Vernon, he behaves like a man con&s;cious of rectitude, and di&s;dainful of oppo&s;ition, frankly tells his name, his place of re&s;idence, his in&s;tructions, and his intentions. It requires very little judgement to &s;ee that the captain of the Flying Fi&s;h is not a pirate. He mu&s;t therefore be &s;omething el&s;e; and it is not pre&s;umptuous to think him only <HI>part of a &s;tupen|dous whole;</HI> in a word, that five hundred other privateers, belonging to the republic, have, or very &s;oon will have, commi&s;&s;ions of the &s;ame te|nor with his.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances announce profound con|tempt for this country. If France did not like our treaty with her Briti&s;h enemy, &s;he might have attempted to defeat it by negociation. But this &s;he &s;corned to do; for, though the Bo&s;ton Centi|nel and the Minerva, have repeatedly &s;aid that about fifty members of congre&s;s are traitors to their country and French tools, no body is weak enough to believe &s;o impudent an a&s;&s;ertion. France finds that &s;he can, by this time, do with|out us, and &s;corns to enquire what are our de|&s;igns. Provi&s;ions are now as cheap and plentiful in France as here, and the want of them was the chief rea&s;on why &s;he courted our good will with &s;o much a&s;&s;iduity.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="033485_0079_0FF71FACAE147A70">Indeed many features in our behaviour to France &s;eem de&s;igned to di&s;gu&s;t her. New&s;pa|pers and pamphlets have teemed with abu&s;e of the mo&s;t inflammatory and indecent nature again&s;t the republic. They have been circulated with indu&s;try, and read with approbation, by a very numerous party among us. The word <HI>jacobin</HI> has been tran&s;planted into the vocabulary of Ame|rican billing&s;gate; and, in fine, grinning where they could not bite, one half of our political au|thors, orators, and printers, have repre&s;ented the French, by the lump, as the vile&s;t mon&s;ters that ever di&s;graced the human form. It was impo&s;|&s;ible that the French &s;hould not be offended at &s;uch childi&s;h in&s;olence, &s;uch toothle&s;s malignity. We are now reaping the harve&s;t that we have &s;own.</P>
<P>The naval power of Britain is a ju&s;t object of terror to this country; but that of France, though inferior to the former, is yet, by a mil|lion of times, &s;uperior to that of a nation who&s;e navy con&s;i&s;ts of three or four frigates, that have been for two years on the &s;tocks, and are like|ly to remain there. By a quarrel with Britain we might have had the mi&s;erable revenge of plun|dering part of her commerce, but, from France, we can gain nothing better than bloody no&s;es and wooden legs. She has few trading &s;hips at &s;ea; and, as for taking her privateers, the Flying Fi&s;h would hardly &s;ell at vendue for as much powder and ball as, in the common rate of fighting, would be wanted to &s;ink her.</P>
<P>Pretences for &s;ea-robbery are always to be had. The republic may declare Britain to be in a &s;tate of &s;iege; and with as much rea&s;on as the Briti&s;h have declared Guadaloupe to be &s;o. She is then, by the law of nations, warranted to capture all
<PB N="81" REF="033485_0080_0FF71FAF31287CE8">
that goes out or comes in; and, between the two rivals, America is exactly in the &s;ame plight with the man in Phoedrus between his two mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>If France had &s;ent a dozen men of war to at|tack our &s;ea coa&s;t, it would have &s;hown that &s;he at lea&s;t thought us capable of re&s;i&s;tance; but when a canoe of &s;ix nine pounders is made the in&s;trument of alarm and vengeance, we may gue&s;s that her re&s;entment is exceeded by her contempt.</P>
<P>Much has been &s;aid of the benefits re&s;ulting to America from the privilege of trading in neutral bottoms during the pre&s;ent war. But the war has cau&s;ed a ri&s;e in the price of provi&s;ions ruin|ous to many individuals. For one example, out of an hundred thou&s;and, there is a per&s;on now in a printing-office in Baltimore, who&s;e wages were, three years ago, a dollar per week higher than they are now; while, at the &s;ame time, a dollar will not go half as far now as it did then. Individuals who are in this &s;ituation, plainly pay a per&s;onal tax, extending to half their income, on account of the war. To them it is evidently and highly oppre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h have often envied the rapid pro|gre&s;s of America in the carrying trade. They have laboured in vain to thru&s;t her out of it. By a policy more acute than honourable, Eng|land is now within &s;ight of affecting her purpo&s;e. France, has, for many years, been fighting the bat|tles of America, but citizen Paris has now begun to fight tho&s;e of Britain. If he acts without autho|rity, the mi&s;take may co&s;t him his life, in a coun|try like France, where the head of a man is &s;ometimes cut off with as little ceremony as the quarters of a bull frog.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="82" REF="033485_0081_0FF71FB0C226A8C0">It is generally under&s;tood, that, in the conven|tion of 1787, a form of government, in &s;ub&s;tance monarchical, was propo&s;ed and rejected. Mr. Ha|milton conducted this party. At the period of accept|ing the con&s;titution, the republicans were di&s;plea&s;ed by the length of time for which the &s;enate hold their &s;eats; and, it has been affirmed, that their friends in the convention, only acceded to it as a matter of compromi&s;e. If the ari&s;tocratical party had carried the point of a pre&s;ident and &s;enate elected for twelve, or even eight years, this would have an|&s;wered, very completely, all the purpo&s;es of mo|narchy. They could, as at pre&s;ent, throw out every bill from the repre&s;entatives, which did not &s;uit their views. In the mean time, their chief, the pre|&s;ident, had the ab&s;olute di&s;po&s;al of the loaves and fi&s;hes; and &s;o long a period of u&s;ele&s;s re&s;i&s;tance, could not fail to wear out the ob&s;tinacy of almo&s;t any republican in the lower hou&s;e. Here then, be|hold royalty in all its deformity of &s;trength and cor|ruption! The federal &s;enate of twelve years were likely to have been more flexible, more abject, than even a Briti&s;h hou&s;e of peers. The latter, in general, enjoy an independent property twenty or forty times greater than that of mo&s;t American &s;enators. Hence the former are le&s;s acce&s;&s;ible than the latter, either to foreign or dome&s;tic corruption. Had Mr. Ha|milton, therefore, and his party, obtained this object of a longer period for the election of a &s;enate and pre&s;ident, the whole fruits of the revolution mu&s;t have been forfeited. Of the two &s;y&s;tems, Briti&s;h &s;u|premacy would have been the le&s;&s;er evil. There is no peculiar &s;ublimity in American legi&s;lators, that would render them impenetrable to an argument from the mint. Franking, for in&s;tance, was not more odly perverted by an Engli&s;h member to pay the wages of his footman, than by Roger Sherman

<P>The actual plan of a federal con&s;titution, as laid before the convention by Mr. Hamilton, was never expo&s;ed to the public view. A copy of it has been obtained for in&s;ertion in this volume. It was com|municated by a gentleman who has long held an important &s;ituation in the government of the coun|try. By &s;ingular good fortune, his character has e&s;caped the &s;hafts even of federal calumny; and his name is at the &s;ervice either of Mr. Hamilton, or of any gentleman who &s;hall, at his de&s;ire, enquire for it. In two or three &s;entences he may have va|ried a word, from inaccuracy of tran&s;cription, but he is po&s;itive as to having pre&s;erved the ideas, in every article, with &s;trict fidelity. The paper has al&s;o been read, in pre&s;ence of two members of con|gre&s;s, to a gentleman who &s;at in the convention; and he declared his belief that it was a faithful copy of the plan &s;ugge&s;ted by Mr. Hamilton.

<HEAD>PROPOSITION OF COLONEL HAMILTON OF NEW-YORK, IN THE CONVENTION FOR ESTABLISHING A CONSTITUTION OF GOVERNMENT FOR THE UNI|TED STATES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. The &s;upreme legi&s;lative power of the Uni|ted States of America to be ve&s;ted in two differ|ent bodies of men; the <HI>one</HI> to be called the a&s;&s;em|bly; the <HI>other</HI> the &s;enate, who together &s;hall form the legi&s;lature of the United States, with power to pa&s;s all laws what&s;oever, &s;ubject to the <HI>negative</HI> hereafter mentioned.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="84" REF="033485_0083_0FF71FB6C76DD718">II. The a&s;&s;embly to con&s;i&s;t of per&s;ons elected by the people, to &s;erve for three years.</P>
<P>[One year is long enough. The Senate are re|markably li&s;tle&s;s about the trifling bu&s;ine&s;s which they have to do; and this may be ju&s;tly a&s;cribed to the length of time for which they are elected. The nation cannot hold its legi&s;lators by too &s;hort a bridle.]</P>
<P N="3">III. The &s;enate to con&s;i&s;t of per&s;ons elected to &s;erve during good behaviour; their election to be made by electors cho&s;en for that purpo&s;e by the people; in order to this the &s;tates to be divided into election di&s;tricts. On the death, re|moval, or re&s;ignation of any &s;enator, his place to be filled out of the di&s;trict from which he came.</P>
<P>[This clau&s;e is exceptionable. To &s;erve during good behaviour means to hold the office for life; &s;ince if a &s;enator votes with the majority, it is about impo&s;&s;ible to get him di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. This has been proved by two well known ca&s;es in the pre&s;ent &s;enate. As for this mode of electing by electors, it gave room for that juggling by which Mr. Adams obtained the pre&s;idency. The paper mu&s;t imply, though it has not been &s;o expre&s;&s;ed, that the &s;enate were to have a negative on the acts pa&s;&s;ed by the repre&s;entatives. Thus legi&s;lation would i&s;&s;ue in an ari&s;tocracy holding their &s;eats for life. It would be far preferable to &s;end back for an Engli&s;h go|vernor.]</P>
<P N="4">IV. The &s;upreme executive authority of the United States to be ve&s;ted in a <HI>governor</HI> to be elected during good behaviour; the election to be made by electors cho&s;en by the people in the election di&s;tricts afore&s;aid: the authorities and functions to be as follows; to have a <HI>negative</HI> upon all laws about to be pa&s;&s;ed, and the execu|tion of all laws pa&s;&s;ed; to have the direction of
<PB N="85" REF="033485_0084_0FF71FBA3A22C060">
war, when authori&s;ed or begun; to have, with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate, the power of making all treaties; to have the &s;ole appoint|ment of the heads or chief officers of finance and foreign affairs; to have the nomination of all other officers, amba&s;&s;adors to foreign nations in|cluded, &s;ubject to the approbation, or rejection of the &s;enate; to have power of pardoning all of|fences, except trea&s;on, which he &s;hall not pardon without the approbation of the &s;enate.</P>
<P>[America has been taught, by experience, that the &s;enatorial check on the pre&s;ident is a mere &s;hadow. The number of &s;enators is &s;o &s;mall, and the offices which he has to be&s;tow are &s;o many, that a pre&s;ident always has comman|ded, and always may command, the acquie&s;cence of a majority in any mea&s;ure that he thinks fit. The contrary can only happen by a very unu&s;ual combination of circum&s;tances. But when this go|vernor and &s;enate hold their &s;eats for life, nothing but jobbing and corruption can be expected to en&s;ue. The executive negative on the laws en|tru&s;ting the welfare of a whole people to the judg|ment or folly of a &s;ingle man, is one of the very wor&s;t features in monarchy. The power of making treaties, as explained by congre&s;s in the ca&s;e of Jay, implies any thing and everything. In&s;tead of holding his office for life, a pre&s;ident &s;hould not hold it for more than two years at a time, leaving the peo|ple to elect him a &s;econd time if they &s;aw proper. This would dimini&s;h the probability of his becom|ing a pen&s;ioner to &s;ome foreign power; as the &s;hortne&s;s of his &s;tay in office would make it le&s;s worth while to purcha&s;e him. Such a &s;ale is far within the chapter of po&s;&s;ibilities. Suppo&s;e that &s;ome future chief magi&s;trate of America &s;hall write an encomium, in three volumes, on the
<PB N="86" REF="033485_0085_0FF71FBC063EA200">
con&s;titution of Ru&s;&s;ia; that the latter country &s;hall be at war with England; and that he &s;hall, in de|fiance of the intere&s;t of his con&s;tituents, and to the apparent ruin of the government it&s;elf, attempt to plunge America into the quarrel, as an ally of Ru&s;&s;ia. Rea&s;on mu&s;t conclude, that the court of Peter&s;burgh has paid him hand&s;omely for his efforts. The probability of a &s;ecret pen&s;ion will be increa&s;|ed, if it &s;hall tran&s;pire, that this pre&s;ident, before his elevation, corre&s;ponded, in a very di&s;honourable mode, with &s;ome &s;py or informer at Peter&s;burg.</P>
<P>With the powers conferred by Mr. Hamilton's propo&s;al, an American <HI>governor</HI> would want no|thing of royalty but the name.]</P>
<P N="5">V. On the death, re&s;ignation, or removal of the governor, his authorities to be exerci&s;ed by the pre&s;ident of the &s;enate, till a &s;ucce&s;&s;or be ap|pointed.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The &s;enate to have the &s;ole power of de|claring war, the power of advi&s;ing and approv|ing all treaties, the power of approving and re|jecting all appointments of officers, except the heads or chiefs of the departments of finance, war, and foreign affairs.</P>
<P>[The &s;ole power of declaring war is, in it&s;elf, &s;uch a &s;weeping privilege, as could not be &s;afely entru&s;ted but to the immediate repre&s;entatives of the people. This would be a complete ari&s;tocracy.]</P>
<P N="7">VII. The &s;upreme judicial authority of the United States, to be ve&s;ted in judges, to hold their office during good behaviour, with adequate and permanent &s;alaries; the court to have original juri&s;diction in all cau&s;es of capture, and an appel|late juri&s;diction in all cau&s;es on which the reve|nues of the general government, or the citizens of foreign nations, are concerned.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="87" REF="033485_0086_0FF71FBEABCBCEA8">VIII. The legi&s;lature of the United States to have power to in&s;titute courts in each &s;tate, for the determination of all matters of general con|cern.</P>
<P N="9">IX.

So immen&s;e an accumulation of patronage, would have made them as ab&s;olute as the late kings of France. Such a &s;y&s;tem as that here &s;ketched out was a direct extirpation of the liberties of America. General Wa&s;hington, as a member of the conven|tion, knew this plan; and that it met with his ap|probation is plain; for when rai&s;ed to the pre&s;i|dency, he appointed Mr. Hamilton to be &s;ecretary of the trea&s;ury. This office, in the way by which Mr. Hamilton conducted it, immediately comprehend|ed twenty times the real influence enjoyed by Mr. Jeffer&s;on, as &s;ecretary of &s;tate. The pre&s;ident thereafter continued to fo&s;ter Mr. Hamilton with augmenting confidence, and never failed to ratify all the &s;tatutes of his majority. The&s;e circum|&s;tances &s;peak very di&s;tinctly; nor will the pre&s;ident's tuneful periods in prai&s;e of republican govern|ment obliterate the &s;tain. Mr. Wa&s;hington ought to have held in dete&s;tation every man capable of inventing or defending &s;o vile a &s;cheme. In&s;tead of that, the apo&s;tle of a federal throne was pre&s;&s;ed to his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>When &s;uch plans were in agitation, it is not &s;ur|pri&s;ing that a party in the convention became &s;o|licitous to &s;hut their doors. But time has, at length, rent the veil of &s;ecrecy; and the primitive prin|ciples and projects of Mr. Hamilton and his friends are now fairly committed to the world.</P>
<P>When, in the convention of 1787, the vote was carried for &s;hutting the doors, the republican par|ty &s;hould have walked out of the hou&s;e. Their want of firmne&s;s hath been the &s;ole cau&s;e of their depre&s;&s;ion. It was of infinite con&s;equence that the opinions and arguments of every member in the convention &s;hould be exactly known. The re|publicans could not have committed a greater er|ror than by flinching from the publicity of debates.

As the convention met in order to frame a repre|&s;entative government, their numbers ought to have borne &s;ome proportion to the importance of the &s;tates from whence they came. For though the meeting voted &s;eperately by &s;tates, and not in an indi|vidual ma&s;s, yet &s;till that &s;tate which &s;ent the grea|te&s;t number of repre&s;entatives had the be&s;t chance of obtaining its own wi&s;hes. Five lawyers in a cau&s;e have the advantage over two of equal abili|ties.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Remarks on Mr. Alexander Hamilton's explanation of his corre&s;pondence with James Reynolds.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON Augu&s;t 25th, 1797, a pamphlet was publi&s;hed at Philadelphia, under the following title: <Q>Ob&s;ervations on Certain Documents, contained in No. V. and VI. of <HI>the Hi&s;tory of the United States, for the year</HI> 1796, in which the Charge of Speculation, again&s;t Alexander Hamilton, late Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, is fully refuted. Written by Him&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>This piece extends to thirty-five pages, be&s;ides an appendix of fifty-eight. The fir&s;t part compri&s;es the author's reply to the accu&s;ation again&s;t him. The latter contains fifty-&s;ix letters and other papers.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="033485_0089_0FF71FC74A3E2970">Mr. Hamilton opens his pamphlet with a de&s;|cription of the jacobins of America. In his dialect, the word jacobin comprehends one-half of the ci|tizens of the United States; for, at the late election of pre&s;ident, the two parties, under the re&s;pective names of Adams and Jeffer&s;on, were exactly ba|lanced. By accident, or fraud, a part of the ci|tizens of Penn&s;ylvania were prevented from tran&s;|mitting their votes to this city, within the time re|quired by law. Hence Mr. Jeffer&s;on had only thir|teen &s;uffrages from this &s;tate, when the voice of the people had given him fifteen. The transference of the&s;e two votes to the oppo&s;ite &s;cale, decided again&s;t Mr. Jeffer&s;on. He lo&s;t the pre&s;idency by a minority of &s;ixty-eight &s;uffrages again&s;t &s;eventy-one. Had the remainder of the Penn&s;ylvania votes been accepted, he would have been pre&s;ident by &s;eventy again&s;t &s;ixty-nine.</P>
<P>When two parties are thus minutely poi&s;ed, they &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;peak about each other with temper and decency. Such conduct ought e&s;pecially to be expected from Mr. Hamilton; who filled, for about &s;even years, one of the fir&s;t offices under the federal government. An idea of gravity and dig|nity is annexed to &s;uch a &s;tation.</P>
<P>Of American jacobins our ex-&s;ecretary &s;peaks thus. <Q>The mo&s;t direct fal&s;hoods are invented and propagated, with undaunted effrontery, and un|relenting per&s;everance. Lies, often detected and refuted, are &s;till revived and repeated, in the hope that the refutation may have been forgotten, or that the frequency and boldne&s;s of accu&s;ation may &s;upply the place of truth and proof.&mdash;If truly this be, as every appearance indicates, a con&s;piracy of vice again&s;t virtue, ought I not rather to be
<PB N="91" REF="033485_0090_0FF71FC9D0632120">
flattered, that I have been &s;o long and &s;o peculi|arly an object of per&s;ecution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;ervations, &amp;c. p. 4.</NOTE>?</Q></P>
<P>This martyr of virtue, this exulting object of per&s;ecution, this antagoni&s;t of fal&s;hood, has publi&s;h|ed ninety-three pages to prove, that he was guilty of conjugal infidelity, that is of <HI>breaking an oath;</HI> for the latter is one of the crimes comprehended within the former. This is the man, who, at the &s;ame moment, has the hardine&s;s to announce <Q>a con&s;piracy of vice again&s;t virtue.</Q> Mr. Hamil|ton &s;hould &s;peak with re&s;erve as to the faults of others. The portrait which he draws of American jacobins, corre&s;ponds, preci&s;ely, with the publica|tions and mea&s;ures common, though not univer&s;al, among the writers and leaders of the federal party. No man has plunged farther than Mr. Hamilton him&s;elf into the ocean of calumny. He &s;hould, therefore, be one of the la&s;t men to complain about it.</P>
<P>The entire form and e&s;&s;ence of this vindication is &s;o vile, &s;o di&s;gu&s;ting, &s;o gro&s;sly indecent, that one hardly knows either how to tran&s;cribe or abridge it. Some of the principal facts are as follows.</P>
<P>In &s;ummer, 1791, Maria, the wife of James Reynolds, waited upon Mr. Hamilton at his hou&s;e in Philadelphia. She told him that her hu&s;band had treated her with cruelty, and de&s;erted her; that her relations re&s;ided in the &s;tate of New-York, and &s;he &s;olicited money to pay the expence of re|turning to them. Mr. Hamilton, for the purpo&s;e of be&s;towing charity, paid a vi&s;it to Mrs. Reynolds at her lodgings. "She met me," &s;ays he, <Q>and con|ducted me into a <HI>bed</HI> room.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After this, adds our author, I had frequent meetings with her, mo&s;t of them at my own
<PB N="92" REF="033485_0091_0FF71FCFCAA11D78">
hou&s;e; <HI>Mrs. Hamilton, with her children, being ab&s;ent on a vi&s;it to her father.</HI></Q> OBSERVATIONS, p. 18. The ex-&s;ecretary might have &s;pared the ad|ditional offence of this palliation. If he had really felt that remor&s;e and &s;hame to which he pretends, Mr. Hamilton never could have printed this lug|gage of circum&s;tances. They were not requi&s;ite even to "wipe away <HI>a more &s;erious &s;tain.</HI>" OBSERVA|TIONS, p. 10. Their omi&s;&s;ion could not have im|paired the force, but they add to the ignominy of his exculpation. Mr. Hamilton might have copied the delicacy of the painter, who ca&s;t a veil over the face of Agammenon, to conceal what it was impo&s;|&s;ible to expre&s;s.</P>
<P>An indignant hu&s;band &s;oon makes his appearance; and Mrs. Reynolds, in a letter to the colonel, &s;ays that he had been &s;wearing he would write to Mrs. Hamilton. This was in December 1791. No. II. of the appendix is a letter from the hu&s;band demanding <HI>&s;atisfaction,</HI> which he affirms that he <HI>will</HI> have, "before one day pa&s;&s;es me more." In No. IV. he &s;ays <Q>I have this propo&s;al to make to you. Give me the &s;um of one thou&s;and dollars.</Q> There next follow two receipts for this money, the one for &s;ix and the other for four hundred dollars. The lady was unwilling to quit &s;o good a friend. She addre&s;&s;es him in love &s;ick epi&s;tles, real or forged, and declares that till he &s;hall vi&s;it her, <Q>my brea&s;t will be the &s;eate of pain and woe.</Q></P>
<P>Reynolds him&s;elf, al&s;o, writes a letter to the colonel, dated March 24th, 1792. He expatiates on his own good nature in permitting the ex-&s;ecre|tary's vi&s;its, gives hints of his power to be trouble|&s;ome, and of his di&s;po&s;ition to oblige. Some other letters &s;ucceed, demanding money. They had been complied with, for it appears by No. XV. da|ted April 17th, 1792, that the colonel continued
<PB N="93" REF="033485_0092_0FF71FD15E3ED7F8">
his vi&s;its. On the 2d of May, he received a formal prohibition from ever &s;eeing the lady again. <Q>I was in hopes, &s;ays Reynolds, that it would ware off, but I find their is no hopes.</Q> Solicita|tions for money follow. The two hundred dollars mentioned by Clingman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Documents, No. 4.</NOTE> were obtained to fit up a boarding hou&s;e. The la&s;t letter is dated Augu&s;t 30th, 1792. In the OBSERVATIONS p. 9, Mr. Ha|milton calls this an <HI>amorous</HI> connection. If this account be true, it merited a coar&s;er name.</P>
<P>The object in publi&s;hing this corre&s;pondence is to prove that the connection between Reynolds and the ex-&s;ecretary did not refer to the purcha&s;e of certificates, but to the charms of Mrs. Reynolds.</P>
<P>Yet Mr. Hamilton and his friends have always enlarged on his poverty. The &s;cale of expence in this affair di&s;agrees with that &s;uppo&s;ition. In eighteen months Maria, mu&s;t have co&s;t him at lea&s;t about eighteen hundred dollars. The expence is ex|travagant in proportion to its end. It revolts again&s;t his well known character for economy. He &s;ays that he was afraid of having the matter known to Mrs. Hamilton. Yet in her ab&s;ence, he had frequent interviews with Mrs. Reynolds at <HI>his own hou&s;e.</HI> This betrays but &s;mall regard for the &s;ecret. <Q>Ser|vants, have ears, as well as other people,</Q> &s;ays Slip&s;lop. It appears, likewi&s;e, that he received nu|merous me&s;&s;ages and letters from the parties, and that Reynolds paid him &s;everal vi&s;its at his hou&s;e. All this di&s;covers little attention to the dread of di&s;clo&s;ure; and indeed the &s;tory was well enough known.</P>
<P>Mr. Hamilton re&s;ts much upon the profligate character of the parties, and the improbability of his having entru&s;ted &s;uch a being as Reynolds with
<PB N="94" REF="033485_0093_0FF71FD2F4B871D8">
his &s;ecrets of &s;peculation. But, by his own ac|count, he did commit his confidence to this man, and protracted the connection with his wife during a whole year after he had been menaced with a di&s;covery.</P>
<P>His pamphlet, full as it is of defiance and de|famation, puts a clo&s;e to his claims for &s;uperior ve|racity. He who acknowledged the reality of &s;uch epi&s;tles, could feel no &s;cruple to forge them. The latter &s;uppo&s;ition is as favourable as the former to his good name. He &s;peaks much about his attach|ment to Mrs. Hamilton, while he &s;quandered what was due to his family, and rambled, as he pre|tends, for eighteen months in the embraces of pol|lution.</P>
<P>The evidence or pre&s;umption again&s;t the authen|ticity of the letters printed by Mr. Hamilton &s;tands thus. Reynolds affirms, that Mr. Hamilton had em|ployed him as an agent of &s;peculation. This the ex-&s;ecretary denies; but, their probity being upon a par, we know not which of them to believe. Mrs. Reynolds adds her te&s;timony, as to the belief of &s;peculation, and &s;ays, that the corre&s;pondence and receipts for money, &s;ince publi&s;hed by Mr. Hamil|ton, were fabricated by him and her hu&s;band<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Documents, No. V. See Hi&s;tory of 1796, Chap. VI. The co|lonel has reprinted the other papers, but leaves out No. V.</NOTE>. But if they actually were &s;o, it remains to be gue&s;&s;ed <HI>why, when,</HI> and <HI>where</HI> they were compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>On this hypothe&s;is we are to believe that Mr. Hamilton, on the motive of threats from Reynolds, and of his being vi&s;ited in pri&s;on by Me&s;&s;rs. Muh|lenberg, Monroe, and Venable, ha&s;ted his enlarge|ment. This happened, on the evening of Wedne&s;|day, the 12th of December, 1797. The interview between Mr. Hamilton and the members was on the evening of Saturday following. The corre&s;|pondence
<PB N="95" REF="033485_0094_0FF71FD4A220E870">
mu&s;t have been framed in the interval; and a day or a few hours were &s;ufficient for that effect.</P>
<P>In No. IV. Clingman, &s;ays, that Reynolds, on the night of his liberation, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to Mr. Hamilton, and by de&s;ire waited on him on Thur&s;day morning. In No. V. he relates &s;ome particulars, which, according to his account from Reynolds, pa&s;t at this interview. Clingman, in a po&s;t-&s;cript to No. V. &s;ays, that, as Mrs. Reynolds a&s;&s;ured him, the letters were <HI>fabricated by her hu&s;band and Mr. Hamilton.</HI> The latter, in this publication, takes no notice of the allegation by Clingman, that <HI>he,</HI> (Mr. Hamilton) <HI>&s;aw Reynolds after his enlargement.</HI> He ought, in con&s;i&s;tency to have denied it. But he had already owned the fact to the three members. Mr. Hamilton, a rake, and Mr. Reynolds, a &s;win|dler, alternately give each other the lie. The pro|bability of untruth and fraud upon each &s;ide is &s;o great, that it is impracticable to determine be|tween them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Hi&s;tory of 1796, it is &s;aid, by mi&s;take, that Mr. Hamil|ton received a copy of the whole documents therein publi&s;hed. From the Ob&s;ervations it comes out, that he never &s;aw No. V. till in print.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the appendix, No. XXXIII. we meet with a letter to Mr. Hamilton, from Me&s;&s;rs. Muhlenberg and Monroe, dated 17th of July, 1797, wherein they write thus: <Q>the explanation of the nature of your connection with Reynolds, which you then gave, removed the &s;u&s;picions we had before entertained of your being connected with him in &s;peculation.</Q> There is another from Mr. Vena|ble to the &s;ame effect. The ex-&s;ecretary re&s;ts much upon this admi&s;&s;ion. But every other per&s;on is now equally well qualified with the&s;e gentlemen to judge of the evidence; &s;o that this is nothing more than the opinion of three individuals.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="033485_0095_0FF71FDC1B9683E8">Yet even their opinion is unfortunately mutila|ted. Mr. Hamilton has printed thirteen letters that pa&s;&s;ed between him&s;elf and Mr. Monroe. From the&s;e it appears that Mr. Monroe &s;till entertained con&s;iderable doubts. They were grounded on the information given by Clingman, which clo&s;es No. V, and bears date the 2d of January, 1793. In one letter Mr. Monroe &s;ays, <Q>whether the im|putations again&s;t you as to &s;peculation, are well or ill founded, depends upon the facts and cir|cum&s;tances, which appear again&s;t you upon your defence. If you &s;hew that they are ill founded, I &s;hall be contented.</Q> Mr. Hamilton, in a &s;uc|ceeding letter, writes thus: <Q>the re&s;ult in my mind is, that you have been and are actuated by mo|tives towards me <HI>malignant</HI> and <HI>di&s;honourable.</HI></Q> The parties wrote on till they were at the point of fighting a duel. The &s;econd cla&s;s of doubts excited in Mr. Monroe, by Clingman, as to the innocence of the ex-&s;ecretary, did not take place till &s;ome weeks after the three members had received the explanation from Mr. Hamilton. The one circum|&s;tance happened on the 15th of December, 1792, and, the other on the 2d of January thereafter. Now, the exculpatory letters from the three mem|bers refer to nothing &s;ub&s;equent to the former date; and as the &s;u&s;picions of Mr. Monroe were revived by Clingman, it is natural to imagine that tho&s;e of Me&s;&s;rs. Muhlenberg and Venable were likewi&s;e ex|cited. Whether this was the ca&s;e, or not, appears of little con&s;equence, unle&s;s, becau&s;e it &s;hews the very &s;lippery nature of the vindication derived from them. If this was the be&s;t defence which they would give to Mr. Hamilton, he has but &s;can|ty room for triumph.</P>
<P>The colonel dwells, with much complacency, on his own tran&s;cendant dignity of character. <Q>It is
<PB N="97" REF="033485_0096_0FF71FDDB08C6BC8">
morally impo&s;&s;ible," &s;ays he, "I &s;hould have be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fooli&s;h as well as depraved <HI>enough</HI> to em|ploy &s;o vile an in&s;trument as Reynolds for &s;uch in&s;ignificant ends, as are indicated by different parts of the &s;tory it&s;elf.</Q> OBSERVATIONS. p. 10. The ends alledged were, &s;peculation to the extent of thirty thou&s;and dollars. Mr. Hamilton pretends that he employed Reynolds as a conveni|ent hu&s;band. This end was <HI>infinitely</HI> more in&s;ig|nificant than the other; &s;o that the inference in the above pa&s;&s;age evidently contradicts the fact.</P>
<P>On p. 13, he &s;peaks of <Q>the general improbabili|ty, that I &s;hould put my&s;elf upon paper with &s;o de&s;picable a per&s;on, on a &s;ubject which might ex|po&s;e me to infamy.</Q> The improbability has actu|ally been fulfilled.</P>
<P><Q>As to the di&s;appearance of the parties after the liberation, how am I an&s;werable for it? Is it not pre&s;umable, that the in&s;tance di&s;covered at the trea&s;ury was not <HI>the only offence of the kind of which they were guilty?</HI> After one detection, is it not very probable that Reynolds fled to avoid detection in other ca&s;es?&mdash;Reynolds was con&s;ide|rably in debt. What more natural for him than to fly from his creditors?</Q> OBSERVATIONS, p. 35. <Q>Could it be expected that I &s;hould &s;o deba&s;e my&s;elf as to think it nece&s;&s;ary to my vindication to be confronted with a per&s;on &s;uch as Reynolds? Could I have borne to &s;uffer my veracity to be expo&s;ed to the humiliating competition?</Q> Ibid p. 36. This tone does not become Mr. Hamilton. People of regular morals, think that the profligate, who debauches another man's wife, cannot be <HI>degra|ded</HI> by confronting her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>As to the di&s;appearance of Reynolds, after his enlargement, Mr. Hamilton has not even offered to deny the having &s;een him privately on the &s;uc|ceeding
<PB N="98" REF="033485_0097_0FF71FDF70CC4770">
day at his own hou&s;e. In No. V. of the documents, he owned to the three members of con|gre&s;s, <Q>that he had received a note from Reynolds in <HI>the night,</HI> at the time &s;tated in Clingman's pa|per, and that he had likewi&s;e &s;een him in <HI>the morning following.</HI></Q> This looks &s;omewhat my&s;|terious. The di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of Reynolds from pri&s;on, without trial, remains to find a decent apology; but, if it was pre&s;umable that he had been guilty of other and &s;imilar offences, this highly aggravated the im|propriety of di&s;charging him. As to his running away for debt, there does not appear any particular rea&s;on for thinking that he fled on this account. Reynolds, in his torn letter to Clingman, gave a more natural and &s;imple account of his intended di&s;appearance. <Q>He has offered to furni&s;h me and Mrs. Reynolds with money to <HI>carry us off.</HI> If I will go, he will &s;ee that &s;he has money to <HI>follow me.</HI></Q> The word <HI>he</HI> can refer only to Mr. Ha|milton, which is clear from the re&s;t of the letter. He was writing in full confidence to Clingman, and could have no imaginable rea&s;on to frame a fiction.</P>
<P>The confronting of Reynolds with Hamilton, before the three members of congre&s;s, would have been more &s;atisfactory to them than the production of any papers. Be&s;ides, although our ex-&s;ecretary profe&s;&s;es &s;uch di&s;dain of being placed in a &s;tate of compari&s;on with him, yet the in&s;tinctive indigna|tion of innocence, would have prompted mo&s;t peo|ple, to drag forward &s;o perfidious an accu&s;er; and, in pre&s;ence of the gentlemen, to have extorted a confe&s;&s;ion of his fraud. The &s;ame &s;hyne&s;s of ap|pealing to the original parties, appears in this pam|phlet. Clingman and the lady have been married. They re&s;ide now at Alexandria. Reynolds him&s;elf lives, it is &s;aid, in New-York. If the letters pub|li&s;hed by Mr. Hamilton in the name of Maria are
<PB N="99" REF="033485_0098_0FF71FE108A58810">
genuine, it would be very ea&s;y to obtain her atte&s;|tation of the fact. A ju&s;tice of peace, at Alexandria, could di&s;patch the bu&s;ine&s;s in half an hour. She could be directed to give a &s;ample of her hand; and, by comparing this with the letters, it would be a&s;|certained whether or not they really came from her pen. But Camillus dares not to meet this te&s;t.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of &s;uch an obvious and deci&s;ive elucida|tion, Mr. Hamilton <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix, No. XLI.</NOTE> brings forward Mary Willi|ams, keeper of a boarding hou&s;e in Philadelphia. This woman &s;wears, that &s;he is well acquainted with the hand writing of Mrs. Reynolds, and that &s;he is <HI>well &s;atisfied</HI> of the letters being genuine. She gives no particulars of her acquaintance with Mrs. Rey|nolds, except the declining to admit of her as a lod|ger. This is as lame a kind of evidence as can well be conceived. Why not appeal to the lady her&s;elf, in place of &s;uch a circuitous method?</P>
<P>The&s;e letters from Mrs. Reynolds are badly &s;pelt and pointed. Capitals, al&s;o, occur even in the mid&s;t of words. But waving &s;uch excre&s;cences, the &s;tile is pathetic and even elegant. It does not bear the marks of an illiterate writer. The con&s;truction of the periods di&s;agrees with this apparent incapa|city of &s;pelling. The officer who can mar&s;hall a regiment, mu&s;t know how to level a mu&s;quet. A few gro&s;s blunders are inter&s;per&s;ed, and the&s;e could readily be devi&s;ed; but, when &s;tript of &s;uch a veil, the body of the compo&s;ition is pure and cor|rect. In the literary world, fabrications of this na|ture have been frequent. Our ex-&s;ecretary admits that he has been in the habit of writing to this fa|mily in a feigned character. The tran&s;ition was ea&s;y to the writing in a feigned &s;tile. Mrs. Rey|nolds her&s;elf may have wrote the&s;e epi&s;tles from
<PB N="100" REF="033485_0099_0FF7201A2D340198">
the dictating of the colonel; for <Q>the variety of &s;hapes which this woman could a&s;&s;ume was end|le&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;ervations, p. 31.</NOTE>.</Q> It is natural, then, to &s;u&s;pect, that &s;he real|ly may have acted that part. But if the colonel is not afraid of her &s;pringing a leak in the bottom of his tale, why does he avoid her te&s;timony, and try to divert our attention by the prattle of Mary Wil|liams?</P>
<P>But even admitting that the love letters and others were genuine, this does not take away the probability of a &s;windling connection between Rey|nolds and Hamilton. The way in which the colo|nel and Maria became acquainted re&s;ts on the &s;in|gle evidence of him&s;elf. Reynolds does not ap|pear to have dropped to Clingman even a hint of in|continency. Mrs. Reynolds<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Documents, No. III.</NOTE> told the three mem|bers of congre&s;s that &s;he had burned a con&s;idera|ble number of letters from Mr. Hamilton to her hu&s;band. The dread that her depo&s;ition may &s;tum|ble upon this fact, appears the only rea&s;on why the colonel chu&s;es to keep her out of the way.</P>
<P>Hence, if the letters from Mrs. Reynolds are in her hand writing, this does not prove that they were the real effu&s;ions of a libidinous corre&s;pondence. If that corre&s;pondence had a being, it does not de&s;troy the po&s;&s;ibility of another, of a quite dif|ferent &s;ort, between the colonel and the hu&s;band. Speculation in June may well con&s;i&s;t with adul|tery in December. The whole proof in this pam|phlet re&s;ts upon an allu&s;ion. <Q>I am a rake, and for that rea&s;on I cannot be a &s;windler. I con|fe&s;s that I &s;tole a hor&s;e; but, if you &s;ay that I &s;tole a cow, I &s;corn to be confronted with my accu&s;ers.</Q> This is an edifying and convenient &s;pecies of logic. Both Reynolds and his lady af|firm
<PB N="101" REF="033485_0100_0FF67B9410C54620">
that there was a &s;peculation, and until they undergo a thorough examination, before &s;ome pro|per authority, the doubt never can be re&s;olved. Under &s;uch circum&s;tances, it was proper that Mr. Monroe &s;hould &s;u&s;pend his judgment.</P>
<P>Mr. Hamilton &s;ays<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;ervations p. 8.</NOTE>, that, during his di&s;cu&s;&s;ion with the three members, he di&s;covered no &s;ymptom different from that of <HI>a proud con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of inno|cence.</HI> What pride, what con&s;cious innocence, any man could feel, in the mid&s;t of &s;uch an acknow|ledgment, the reader is left to judge.</P>
<P>Thus much for the main points in Mr. Hamil|ton's piece. A few epi&s;odes remain to be handled. It now comes out that the improper communica|tions from the trea&s;ury office to Reynolds and Cling|man were made by <HI>Fraunces,</HI> a clerk therein. This man afterwards pre&s;ented a memorial to congre&s;s arraigning Mr. Hamilton. His charge was rejected as groundle&s;s. In a note, the ex-&s;ecretary adds, <Q>would it be believed, after all this, that Mr. Jeffer&s;on, vice-pre&s;ident of the United States, would write to this Fraunces friendly letters? Yet &s;uch is the fact.</Q> In the appendix, we find the&s;e alarming epi&s;tles. Ob&s;erve now, to what a de&s;titution of materials the ene|mies of Thomas Jeffer&s;on are reduced! The fir&s;t letter, dated June 27th, 1797, mu&s;t have been in an&s;wer to &s;ome reque&s;t for money. <Q>I &s;hall not have one dollar to &s;pare,</Q> &s;ays the vice-pre&s;ident. Another, dated next day, refu&s;es a <HI>certificate of character.</HI> This is the wonderful friend&s;hip &s;o &s;hock|ing to the nerves of our fi&s;cal Atlas! The letters are, in them&s;elves, entirely unimportant. They have no reference to any part of the ex-&s;ecretary's budget. In what way he got them, or for what rea&s;on he

printed them, is yet to be told. They cannot le&s;&s;en, by the value of one cent, the reputation of our vice-pre&s;ident. If this corre&s;pondence is one of the great|e&s;t faults in Mr. Jeffer&s;on which hatred can di&s;co|ver, and fury reveal, he enjoys the pure&s;t character which has adorned hi&s;tory. But &s;ince Hamilton &s;peaks of di&s;reputable corre&s;pondence, we may re|mind him of that which he &s;upported, for a twelve month, with Mr. Reynolds, and of his crouching under the menaces of this precious agent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Mrs. Reynolds, more than once, communicated to me, that Reynolds would occa&s;ionally relap&s;e into di&s;content at his <HI>&s;ituation;</HI> would treat her very ill, hint at the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of me, and more openly threaten, by way of revenge, to inform Mrs. Hamilton.</Q></P>
<BIBL>Ob&s;ervations, p. 15.</BIBL></NOTE>. If any thing, within one million of degrees of &s;uch di&s;|grace, can be fixed on Mr. Jeffer&s;on, pray let us hear it; for, in that lexicon of lies and calumnies, printed by our Portugue&s;e amba&s;&s;ador, Dr. Smith, hardly one article, granting it to be true, has the ve&s;tige of common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of inveighing again&s;t the republican party, as propagators of &s;lander, Mr. Hamilton ought to thank them for a degree of forbearance and deli|cacy of which his friends have very &s;eldom &s;et an example. During the time of this connection, it was known to many members of congre&s;s. If any repub|lican character had been the hero of the &s;tory, it would infallibly have been echoed from one end of the continent to the other. Yet that party, with much good nature, ob&s;erved profound &s;ilence. Mr. Jeffer&s;on had received a copy of the&s;e documents. He never &s;hewed them, nor ever &s;poke of them, to any per&s;on. In &s;ummer, 1797, when the vice-pre|&s;ident heard of the intended publication, he advi&s;ed that the papers &s;hould be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. Benevolence could not go farther, but his interpo&s;ition came too
<PB N="103" REF="033485_0102_0FF71FE89D9A1060">
late. Mr. Hamilton well knew that Mr. Jeffer&s;on was ma&s;ter of his &s;ecret, and had kept it; and yet he took the opportunity of this pamphlet to attack his benefactor's reputation. If the papers had been printed four years &s;ooner, the be&s;t effects might have en&s;ued to America, for the pre&s;ident would undoubtedly have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Camillus.</P>
<P>Quitting the&s;e two letters from Jeffer&s;on to Fraun|ces, we come to the offence for which Reynolds was impri&s;oned, and the cau&s;es for which he was di&s;charged. Mr. Wolcott<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix No. XXIV.</NOTE> &s;ays, that Reynolds and Clingman were pro&s;ecuted for having <HI>&s;uborned a per&s;on to commit perjury.</HI> After the pro&s;ecution commenced, Clingman confe&s;&s;ed that he and Rey|nolds had li&s;ts of the names and &s;ums due to cer|tain creditors of the United States, and which had been obtained from a clerk in the trea&s;ury, with a view to the forgery of warrants on it, in the name of &s;uch creditors. As to the name of this clerk, Hamilton, in No. V, intimated to the mem|bers that it was Duer. But Wolcott<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> affirms, that Duer had no concern with it. Thus, the two gen|tlemen contradict each other, and on a point which mu&s;t have been equally well known to both. Mr. Wolcott explains the rea&s;on for withdrawing the pro&s;ecution, which was, that the offenders gave up the li&s;ts of creditors obtained from the trea&s;ury, and told the name of the unfaithful clerk. This he calls "an important di&s;covery." As for deli|vering the li&s;ts, the&s;e were only copies, and not original papers. It was quite ea&s;y for the parties to keep other copies, and proceed to fabricate warrants; indeed they might withhold and conceal part of the very li&s;ts which they had got from the trea&s;ury.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="033485_0103_0FF71FEA312C0728">Mr. Hamilton, &s;peaking of this di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, &s;ays, <Q>it was certainly of more con&s;equence to the pub|lic to detect and expel from the bo&s;om of the trea&s;ury department, an unfaithful clerk, to pre|vent future and exten&s;ive mi&s;chief, than to di&s;|grace and puni&s;h two worthle&s;s individuals.</Q>&mdash; OBSERVATIONS, p. 34. But the ex-&s;ecretary &s;hould have proved that the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the one was ne|ce&s;&s;ary towards the di&s;covery of the other; and this he has not done. <Q>The culprits were compel|led to give <HI>a real and &s;ub&s;tantial equivalent</HI> for the relief which they obtained from a department <HI>over which I pre&s;ided.</HI></Q> Ibid. The &s;ub&s;tantiality is very doubtful. As for <HI>pre&s;iding,</HI> the comptroller is independent. Either Mrs. Reynolds was the real and ultimate cau&s;e of this di&s;charge, or it re&s;ulted from &s;ome invi&s;ible machinery, which the movers do not chu&s;e to bring forward. It revolts again&s;t propriety, and the official judgment of Mr. Wol|cott, to &s;ay, that he would di&s;mi&s;s two criminals for &s;o trifling a rea&s;on. Clingman, of him&s;elf, confe&s;&s;ed to Wolcott, the affair of the &s;tolen li&s;ts of names from the trea&s;ury. From the certificate of the lat|ter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix, No. XXIV.</NOTE>, it is to be under&s;tood, that he made the con|fe&s;&s;ion, un&s;olicited, and even un&s;u&s;pected. But adds the comptroller, <Q>both Clingman and Reynolds ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed, for &s;ometime, to deliver up the li&s;ts, or to di&s;clo&s;e the name of the per&s;on through who&s;e infidelity they had been obtain|ed.</Q> All this mu&s;t clearly be a &s;ham. The cul|prits were under pro&s;ecution for another crime, the &s;ubornation of perjury. Their de&s;pair is evi|dent, from the voluntary confe&s;&s;ion of Clingman. The delivery of the li&s;ts, and the di&s;clo&s;ure of the name of their a&s;&s;ociate, were matters of cour&s;e.
<PB N="105" REF="033485_0104_0FF71FEC13918968">
The comptroller had only to proceed with his &s;uit, and could, at any period, have en&s;ured the promul|gation of every &s;ecret which they had. When a public officer, like Mr. Wolcott, conjures up an ab&s;urd excu&s;e for having de&s;erted his duty, tho&s;e who pay his &s;alary have a right to critici&s;e him. Mr. Wolcott di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, with impunity, two offen|ders that, as he &s;ays, he might reach Fraunces, a clerk in the trea&s;ury. Had the comptroller been a boy or a fool, rea&s;on might have &s;miled at his frivolity of triumph. But &s;ince he is a man of long experience in bu&s;ine&s;s, and free from the &s;allies of a florid imagination, it is ju&s;t to infer that &s;ome|thing deeper than vanity lies at the bottom of the pool.</P>
<P>Other pa&s;&s;ages in this pamphlet might admit of remark, but the above appears to be a &s;ufficient &s;pecimen. The arguments and the te&s;timony pro|duced by our ex-&s;ecretary are alike un&s;atisfactory. He lays much weight upon the purity and elevation of his per&s;onal character. His own performance explodes it. He triumphs in an exculpation from the three members of congre&s;s. Yet, as to Me&s;&s;rs. Monroe and Muhlenberg, his auxiliary writers con&s;tantly repre&s;ent them as traitors to their coun|try. According to Mr. Hamilton's own de&s;crip|tion of jacobins, they mu&s;t be the vile&s;t of mankind; and their atte&s;tation can de&s;erve no credit what|ever; but yet it fills him with pride. An impar|tial by&s;tander might addre&s;s him thus.</P>
<P><Q>If Muhlenberg, and his two friends, are the fire|brands of faction, which you repre&s;ent them to be, then it was unworthy of your innocence to a&s;k a vindication from them. The oak does not lean upon the bramble; nor &s;trength court the protection of weakne&s;s. But &s;ince you have ap|pealed to the&s;e gentlemen, in defence of your

character, you betray an evident con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that they have a character to lo&s;e. This earne&s;t recour&s;e to their honour di&s;covers that you di&s;|believe your own general portrait of jacobins; and the peculiar reproaches that your &s;cribblers have poured on Me&s;&s;rs. Muhlenberg and Monroe. A ve&s;tal does not prop her purity by the evidence of a bawd; nor a Sully wa&s;h his hands while Cartouche holds the ba&s;on. You arraign the&s;e men as calumniators; and, on the &s;ame page, you refer to their veracity in defence of yours. This is a contradiction. You placed your&s;elf in a delicate &s;ituation. If they had refu&s;ed, as they well might have done, to take notice of your ap|plication, your fame was, by your own arrange|ment, in a dangerous way. The confidence that you repo&s;ed in them, and the alacrity which, in &s;pite of all provocations, they have manife&s;ted to &s;erve you, refute your clamours again&s;t them. The fir&s;t &s;tep in &s;upport of your &s;ame, fixes you in detected calumny.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You give an in&s;ufficient rea&s;on, for the relea&s;e of Reynolds from jail. You received a vi&s;it from him before &s;unri&s;e on the en&s;uing morning. He then di&s;appeared; and when the three gentlemen waited on you re&s;pecting his accu&s;ations, you tell a long hi&s;tory of an intrigue, and produce a bun|dle of letters concerning it. That they are the real hand writing of the parties we have no proof but your word, and a depo&s;ition from the mi&s;tre&s;s of a boarding-hou&s;e. On the contrary, Reynolds never &s;poke to Clingman of any thing but &s;pecu|lation. His wife adds her &s;u&s;picion; and affirms, that the love epi&s;tles, and receipts for money, are a fabrication by her hu&s;band and you. The whole collection would not have required above an evening to write them. At the di&s;tance of four
<PB N="107" REF="033485_0106_0FF71FF335AEB8B8">
years and an half, and when warned and chal|lenged to produce the parties them&s;elves, you &s;till avoid a per&s;onal reference. You &s;peak as if it was impo&s;&s;ible to invent a few letters. Yet, upon this very bu&s;ine&s;s, you wrote in a feigned hand. And what is your molehill appendix, altogether, to the gigantic fabrications of P&s;almanazar and of Chat|terton? Send for the lady, or pay her a vi&s;it. Take her before a magi&s;trate, and let us hear what &s;he has to &s;ay. Your avoiding a public meeting with her, holds out a &s;trong pre&s;umption of her inno|cence. Try, al&s;o, to find out Reynolds. Never pretend that you &s;corn to confront accu&s;ers. The world will believe that you dare not.</Q></P>
<P>To this addre&s;s the ex-&s;ecretary would be puzzled to make a &s;ound an&s;wer. Some of his friends are le&s;s &s;ore than he is on the &s;ubject of &s;peculation. In &s;pring, 1794, commodore Gillon, replying, in congre&s;s, to Dr. William Smith, &s;aid, <Q>what makes the gentleman angry? Did I &s;peak a word of <HI>pilot boats?</HI></Q> The doctor pocketed this hint, which was equally well under&s;tood by every man in the hou&s;e. Dr. Smith has always been among the fore|mo&s;t in the battles of the ex-&s;ecretary; and no fact is beter believed, than that many others of the fe|deral members did &s;peculate in certificates to the amount of millions. Of this party, Mr. Hamilton was the centre and the &s;oul. He not merely plan|ned, but dictated their mea&s;ures; a circum&s;tance e&s;tabli&s;hed by the uniform corre&s;pondence between his reports and the &s;tatute book of the fir&s;t and &s;e|cond congre&s;s. Now, if he really did not touch a cent of their earnings, &s;till he mu&s;t own that he kept &s;orry company. If Mr. Hamilton &s;hook from about his ears the golden &s;hower, and trampled under foot the wages of &s;peculation, he can be no|thing le&s;s than a &s;econd Abdiel.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="033485_0107_0FF71FF4CE934708"><Q>Of all the vile attempts which have been made to injure my character," &s;ays Mr. Hamilton, that which has been lately revived in No V. and VI. of the Hi&s;tory of the United States, for 1796, is <HI>the mo&s;t vile.</HI>&mdash;A ju&s;t pride, with reluctance &s;toops to a formal vindication again&s;t &s;o de&s;pica|ble a contrivance, and is inclined rather to op|po&s;e to it <HI>the uniform evidence of an upright cha|racter.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>This would be my conduct on the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion, did not the tale derive &s;ome &s;anction from the names of three men of &s;ome weight and con|&s;equence.</Q> OBSERVATIONS, p. 9.</P>
<P>As for the vilene&s;s of <HI>the attempt,</HI> &amp;c. it is as fair as any thing can be. In committing the documents to pre&s;s, the publi&s;her exerci&s;ed a right and a duty. It did not appear, from any thing on the face of the&s;e papers, that the three gentlemen were &s;atis|fied with Mr. Hamilton's explanation. And he knew that they were not unanimous in the acquittal. The enquiry was a public concern, and the public were entitled to judge for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>With regard to <HI>uniform uprightne&s;s of character,</HI> there is no man in America, who&s;e good name has encountered &s;uch violent oppo&s;ition as that of Mr. Hamilton. If he is to an&s;wer every charge again&s;t him, that has been made on re&s;pectable authority, this piece does not complete the ta&s;k. Mr. Findley, in his Hi&s;tory of the We&s;tern In&s;urrection, has urged many accu&s;ations, as bad as that of jobbing in cer|tificates. The following are two in&s;tances. Mr. Ha|milton has not attempted to deny any part of them.</P>
<P>The commander of the army lodged for &s;ome time in the hou&s;e of major Powers, about thirty miles from the town of Wa&s;hington. This man had been active in promoting a &s;ettlement. <Q>His &s;er|vices were acknowledged, while head-quarters
<PB N="109" REF="033485_0108_0FF71FF7AF626AB8">
were at his hou&s;e, and he was paid a larger &s;um than he demanded, for his trouble and ex|pences<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Findley, Chap. XVIII.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Sometime after this payment, Mr. Hamilton &s;ent for major Powers to Wa&s;hington. He then examin|ed him concerning the conduct of Albert Gallatin, and of &s;ome other per&s;ons with whom the major was not even acquainted. The an&s;wers were un&s;atisfac|tory, and an officer was ordered to conduct him into another apartment, where he might, for an hour, re|fre&s;h his memory. He was thru&s;t into a room, among a croud of pri&s;oners, under the point of the bayonet. When called out again, he told Mr. Hamilton that he had nothing further to recollect. The &s;ecretary reproved him in &s;evere terms for concealing truth. He was immediately committed a clo&s;e pri&s;oner. The be&s;t bail was offered for his appearance and refu&s;ed. The military conducted him to Pitt&s;burg and kept him in cu&s;tody till the eighth day. Mr. Hamilton being then gone, "the judge" &s;ent for major Powers, and politely a&s;&s;ured him that he had no charge whatever again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Thus a meritorious citizen, who&s;e &s;ervices had been gratefully rewarded, was, without warrant, accu&s;er, or even a pretence of guilt, impri&s;oned for eight days. The motive to this outrage was yet ba&s;er than the act it&s;elf. Mr. Hamilton wan|ted Powers to turn evidence again&s;t people of whom he knew no harm. The crime of Reynolds and Clingman was &s;aid to be &s;ubornation of perjury. The proceedings of the &s;ecretary came very near it. He had, by the way, no legal authority to commit any body. He held no regular tru&s;t of that nature. As for the judge, who endured &s;uch tran&s;actions before his eyes, it may be hazardous to &s;ay much about him. The other of the two ca&s;es is as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="033485_0109_0FF71FFCCA0552A8">John Hamilton was, at that time, high &s;heriff of Wa&s;hington county, and colonel of the Min|go Creek regiment of militia. Mr. Findley enu|merates his &s;ucce&s;sful exertions to prevent mi&s;chief. This man, hearing that a charge had been lodged again&s;t him, went thirty miles to pre&s;ent him&s;elf to judge Peters. His honour had not time to exa|mine him. He was, however, arre&s;ted, and &s;ent to the town of Wa&s;hington. He applied again to the judge for examination; but in vain. He was &s;ent pri&s;oner to Philadelphia, a winter journey of more than three hundred miles. He was paraded, along with others, through the &s;treets, with a badge in his hat, and ca&s;t into the cells. After near TWO MONTHS AND AN HALF, he obtained an examination, and was admitted to bail. In the &s;equel, not a &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tance could be found agin&s;t him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Findley Chap. XVIII.</NOTE>. The rea&s;on for this outrage is given by Mr. Find|ley. The &s;ecretary of the trea&s;ury had re&s;olved on his de&s;truction. For actions like the&s;e, James the &s;econd was turned out of England, and George the third expelled from this continent.</P>
<P>If Mr. Hamilton wanted to drive the we&s;tern people into the arms of Britain, and to excite a &s;econd in&s;urrection, wor&s;e than the fir&s;t, this beha|viour was judicious and con&s;i&s;tent. But while he has thus coolly trampled on law, ju&s;tice, humanity, and every maxim of &s;ound policy, our ex-&s;ecreta|ry &s;hould not refer to his uniform uprightne&s;s of character. In pa&s;&s;ing, we cannot withhold a tri|bute of admiration to the &s;pirited and important part acted by the American bench. It is to be la|mented that &s;ome patriotic citizens did not rai&s;e a &s;ub&s;cription for &s;upporting an action of damages again&s;t judge Peters.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="033485_0110_0FF71FFE57D45398">Thus the &s;heriff of a county was illegally taken from the exerci&s;e of his office, an office as &s;acred and important as that of judge Peters him&s;elf; and, at that time, of high con&s;equence to the peace of the country. Becau&s;e the judge had not lei&s;ure to examine him, he was hauled to Philadel|phia, and confined, for about &s;eventy days, before he could obtain a hearing. Mr. Peters, when at Wa&s;hington, had promi&s;ed to examine him with|in half an hour. What a fine &s;pecimen of ju&s;tice was this to hold out before the people beyond the mountains! John Hamilton had to make a &s;econd journey to this city, in June, 1795, to &s;tand trial, &s;o that, fir&s;t, and la&s;t, he mu&s;t have travelled fifteen hundred miles.

Our fede|ral literati are con&s;tantly talking about the atro|city of the we&s;tern riots, which they dignify or degrade with the name of rebellion.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><Q>IT is a maxim deeply ingrafted in that dark &s;y&s;tem, (the <HI>jacobin</HI>) that no character, however upright, is a match for con&s;tantly rei|terated attacks, however fal&s;e.&mdash;Every calumny makes &s;ome pro&s;elites, and even retains &s;ome; &s;ince ju&s;tification &s;eldom circulates as rapidly and as widely as &s;lander.</Q> OBSERVATIONS, p. 8.</P>
<P>Mr. Hamilton him&s;elf is fond of attacking per|&s;onal characters. A con&s;iderable portion of Mr. Findley's book con&s;i&s;ts of details re&s;pecting the ca|lumnious accu&s;ations which the &s;ecretary circulat|ed, while acting in his incomprehen&s;ible capacity on the we&s;tern expedition. It is believed that not even a &s;yllable of the&s;e charges has been contra|dicted, and far le&s;s refuted, either by him&s;elf, or by any body for him. It is impo&s;&s;ible and u&s;ele&s;s to quote in this place a tenth part of the&s;e details. They were u&s;hered into the world under a name known and re&s;pected. They are as explicit as they imaginably could be; and as indefen&s;ible as either truth or calumny, or hi&s;tory or fable, could make them. A &s;ample or two &s;hall be &s;elected from the ma&s;s.</P>
<P>Two judges of We&s;tmoreland county waited on Mr. Hamilton and judge Peters, to enquire in what way they ought to proceed again&s;t offenders. In&s;tead of a &s;uitable an&s;wer, they were urged to accu&s;e Mr. Gallatin, as having <Q>expre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf in a trea&s;onable manner at the fir&s;t Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kin&s;on

meeting. And when they denied having heard any &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions, the &s;ecretary a&s;&s;erted, that <HI>he had &s;ufficient proofs of them already.</HI> They however, per&s;i&s;ted in a&s;&s;erting that he u&s;ed no &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Findley, Chap.

They were &s;ifted, al&s;o, regarding Mr. John Smilie, but to no effect. At this inqui&s;ition, Mr. Hamilton &s;aid, that he never would forgive Findley, who <Q>had told or wrote lies about him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>One John Baldwin was treated yet wor&s;e. He refu&s;ed to give evidence again&s;t &s;heriff Hamilton. For this he was in&s;ulted, told that he evaded &s;wear|ing truth, and that he had forfeited the benefit of the amne&s;ty by not giving the te&s;timony demand|ed. Somebody Vaughan, a light hor&s;eman from Phi|ladelphia, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the &s;ecretary at this &s;cene.</P>
<P>Such behaviour was only &s;uitable to an Engli&s;h &s;tar chamber, or a Scots court of ju&s;ticiary. If judge Peters had a&s;&s;umed the command of a wing of the army, or if general Morgan, or any other military officer, had placed him&s;elf on the bench with Mr. Peters, the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the fact would have been in&s;tantly di&s;cerned, and the continent have re&s;ounded with outcries of indignation. But the &s;ecretary had no office, either civil or mi|litary. He was, in every &s;hape, and in every &s;en&s;e of the word, an intruder and an u&s;urper, and he exerci&s;ed his authority as might have been ex|pected from the way in which he obtained it. Behold him a&s;cending the bench, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a di&s;trict attor|ney, an in&s;pector of exci&s;e, and a light-hor&s;eman. This knot of &s;elf-created magi&s;trates attempt to dic|tate the depo&s;ition of a witne&s;s; and, as in the ca&s;e of Baldwin, they threaten his life on the event of

his refu&s;al. Ob&s;erve, al&s;o, the tremulous judge, &s;hrinking into the back ground of the picture, while the laws and liberties of the people are troden under foot. Mr. Hamilton, <Q>by his own authority, wrote a &s;evere reprimand to the commander in chief of the right wing of the army, in con&s;equence of which, he was treated in a manner not becoming his rank<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Findley, Chap. XVIII.</NOTE>.</Q> This was de&s;troying di&s;cipline, the back bone of an army. It was a &s;elf-created power, by far more dangerous, than any contemplated by democratic &s;ocieties. The pre&s;ident &s;uffered Mr. Hamilton to a&s;&s;ume it, and forebore calling him to account for it.</P>
<P>Here is another &s;ample of Mr. Hamilton's di&s;|cretion. He expre&s;&s;ed much &s;urpri&s;e at the we&s;tern people for repo&s;ing &s;o much confidence in fo|reigners. He &s;aid, that Gallatin and Findley <Q>were both foreigners, and therefore <HI>not to be tru&s;t|ed</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid, Chap. XIX.</NOTE>.</Q> Mr. Findley has been longer, by many years, in the country than our &s;ecretary him&s;elf, who&s;e father was from Scotland, and his mother from Ireland. Their &s;on was born at &s;ea, or in an i&s;land of the We&s;t-Indies. He had no right to con|temn foreigners. This is the general cant of his party. Above all, they dete&s;t Iri&s;hmen, becau&s;e the latter, coming from a mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ed country, have a natural bias to political inve&s;tigation. A great part of the people in the four we&s;tern counties are na|tives of that i&s;land, &s;o that this language held out an in&s;ult upon the community at large. It was one of the many direct mea&s;ures, employed by Mr. Ha|milton, for the excitement of deep and durable mi&s;chief. At the hou&s;e of captain Dicky, he com|plained of the <HI>thirteen letters,</HI> publi&s;hed &s;ometime before the in&s;urrection, by Mr. Findley. He &s;wore
<PB N="115" REF="033485_0114_0FF7200A2293C2C8">
that they contained lies again&s;t him. His landlord replied, that he believed their contents to be true. Such a fooli&s;h demeanour, of which Mr. Hamilton afforded many examples, would have been &s;carcely pardonable in a boy.</P>
<P>Another trait in the colonel's conduct de|&s;erves attentive reflection. The money for de|fraying the expence of this army, was &s;upplied by him in direct oppo&s;ition to the con&s;titution. That in&s;trument, article i. &s;ection ix. clau&s;e vi. &s;ays, that <Q>no money &s;hall be drawn from the trea&s;ury, but in con&s;equence of appropriations <HI>made by law.</HI></Q> There exi&s;ted a &s;tatute autho|ri&s;ing the pre&s;ident to call out the militia, in ca&s;e of an in&s;urrection; but by an over&s;ight in fram|ing the law, he had no power to take money from the trea&s;ury to &s;upport them. <Q>The monies drawn from the trea&s;ury on that occa&s;ion (the we&s;tern expedition,) were paid out of a fund appropriated for <HI>other and di&s;tinct purpo&s;es;</HI> they were not drawn, agreeable to the con&s;titution, in con&s;equence of any appropriation made by law. It might be a defect in the law, authori&s;ing the expence, not to have provided the means; but that defect &s;hould have been remedied by the only competent authority, by convening congre&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gallatia, p. 82.</NOTE>.</Q> This omi&s;&s;ion in the law &s;hews the ma&s;terly &s;tile in which our &s;tatutes are &s;ometimes compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>If the bombardment of a Briti&s;h fleet, or the di&s;embarkation of a French army had not left one moment to &s;pare, engulphing nece&s;&s;ity would ju&s;tly have &s;uperceded all forms, and vindicated the ir|regular ab&s;traction of a million of dollars. Yet even in that ca&s;e, the pre&s;ident, at the next meet|ing
<PB N="116" REF="033485_0115_0FF7200BB532D1F8">
of congre&s;s, ought to have explained and apo|logized for the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>But no &s;uch imminent danger had a being. There was ample time to have a&s;&s;embled congre&s;s. Ne|ville the in&s;pector's hou&s;e was burnt on the 17th of July, 1794. The fir&s;t proclamation by the pre&s;ident was i&s;&s;ued on the 7th of Augu&s;t, and the &s;econd on the 25th of September following. It was not till after the latter date, that the militia were or|dered to march. The &s;even weeks intervening between the two proclamations allowed full time for a&s;&s;embling the legi&s;lature. Of this Mr. Adams hath afforded an in&s;tance, in the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of the fifth congre&s;s. In&s;tead of this legal and practicable mea&s;ure, the pre&s;ident and Mr. Ha|milton walked &s;traight through the con&s;titution, through the privileges of the legi&s;lature, and the duties of their own re&s;pective offices.</P>
<P>If congre&s;s had been previou&s;ly called, the very report of their a&s;&s;embling would have &s;truck a mortal damp into this thoughtle&s;s rabble, who had neither plans, leaders, nor re&s;ources. The &s;olemnity of the &s;tep was &s;ure of making a con|&s;iderable impre&s;&s;ion. Time would have been gained, al&s;o, for more accurate information; and as the fifteen thou&s;and militia, who did march over the mountains, never &s;aw an enemy, it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed that five thou&s;and could have done the bu&s;ine&s;s equally well.</P>
<P>But Mr. Hamilton had many good rea&s;ons for not wi&s;hing to call congre&s;s. The &s;ound policy of the exci&s;e law would have met with a &s;evere di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion. The expence and danger of a civil war mu&s;t have rendered exci&s;e completely odious. Every lenient mea&s;ure was &s;ure to have been tried before a &s;ingle regiment would be ordered to march, and the &s;equel &s;hews that they mu&s;t have
<PB N="117" REF="033485_0116_0FF7200F4258C0F8">
been &s;ucce&s;sful. The &s;ober and &s;ub&s;tantial ma&s;s of the we&s;tern citizens, though aver&s;e to exci&s;e, were yet firm on the &s;ide of government. In the pro&s;pect of an agreement, Hamilton &s;aw no|thing but the reprobation of his mea&s;ures, and the fracture of his importance. The parties in congre&s;s are nicely poi&s;ed; but every legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly has a number of doubtful members, and the natural aver&s;ion to civil blood&s;hed, held out an irre&s;i&s;tible cau&s;e, or a &s;olid pretence, for univer&s;ally de&s;erting the &s;ix per cent. &s;tandard. In this ca&s;e, the latter could not, probably, have mu&s;tered one-third of the members, and mino|rities are always dangerous to a political par|ty. The republicans abhor the ex-&s;ecretary with a cordiality of hatred equal to his own. They con&s;ider him as a &s;econd Pandora's box, from who&s;e tran&s;cendant capacities for mi&s;chief have exclu|&s;ively and collectively &s;prung the whole political misfortunes of America. The utmo&s;t force of the party was certain, therefore, to have been levelled per&s;onally at him, and his vulnerable &s;ides offer|ed an ample verge for the quivers of invective. Hence he &s;hunned a previous meeting of congre&s;s, where it was more than an equal chance that he &s;hould find not protection and triumph, but re|proach and defeat. This &s;eems to be the only rational key to his conduct in hazarding a ci|vil war, and a rape upon the trea&s;ury, without con&s;ulting the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>The in&s;ignificance of their conduct when they did meet, &s;hewed, that the victory of Mr. Hamil|ton was as complete in Philadelphia as at Pitt&s;burg. On the 19th of November, 1794, the pre&s;ident ad|dre&s;&s;ed the two hou&s;es. He began, as u&s;ual, with a reference to divine goodne&s;s, and to the riches, power, and happine&s;s, for which America &s;eems
<PB REF="033485_0117_0FF72010CF49AE58">
de&s;tined. A pompous and exaggerated &s;ketch was then given of the in&s;urrection. Certain &s;elf-created &s;ocieties were referred to, as having a&s;&s;umed the tone of condemnation towards the mea&s;ures of go|vernment. But the pre&s;ident forgot to mention, and much le&s;s to apologize, for the &s;elf-created power of taking a million of dollars from the pub|lic trea&s;ury. When he related the outrages com|mitted upon officers of government, he overlooked the provocations by which they had been excited, the numerous in&s;tances of mi&s;management on the part of the &s;ecretary of the trea&s;ury, by which they had been fo&s;tered, and the thou&s;and-fold enormities of the federal army, and of that &s;ecretary, under which they had been overwhelmed. There is a French fable, of a gardener and a hare, that &s;ome|times came through the hedge, and cropt his cab|bages. He repre&s;ented the ca&s;e to a gentleman, who, next day, with a pack of hounds, entered the gar|den in chace of her. The dogs did more mi&s;chief in five minutes, than the hare could have done in &s;even years, and after all, pu&s;s got away.</P>
<P>This is a conci&s;e and impartial picture of the fe|deral army, with one &s;mall di&s;tinction, that the gar|dener was a fool, and the &s;ecretary a knave. Never think that you under&s;tand the &s;tory of this in&s;ur|rection, till you read Findley and Brackenridge. Compare their copious and intere&s;ting narratives with the collection of papers publi&s;hed by govern|ment. The temperate and manly &s;tile of the for|mer hi&s;torian is &s;ometimes clogged with a tire&s;ome length of periods. His reference to dates is occa|&s;ionally confu&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Almo&s;t every one of the ancient hi&s;torians has been remarkably negligent on this point. Sallu&s;t, Livy, and Tacitus, for example, are often inextricably imperfect. Try to follow Cae&s;ar through his own account of his fir&s;t campaign in Belgium, or in his two inva&s;ions of Britain. A modern general gives you the date of every tran&s;action. To forbear it, would be pu&s;hing out the right eye of his narrative.</NOTE>, and the remarks which he in|ter&s;per&s;es,
<PB N="119" REF="033485_0118_0FF720157AB9B8D0">
might improve by concentration. But the&s;e are trifling &s;pecks, and only mentioned here to obviate the ho&s;tility of fi&s;cal critici&s;m. Mr. Findley was a farmer, and a &s;oldier in the Ameri|can army, for many years before he became a pro|fe&s;&s;ed author; and the wonder ought to be that his faults are &s;o few. His accuracy has been atte&s;ted by the &s;ilence of the &s;ecretary, while the toothle&s;s &s;currility of the trea&s;ury new&s;papers announces that he has drawn blood.</P>
<P>Mr. Brackenridge writes with more ea&s;e and vivacity than Mr. Findley. His per&s;picuity, his &s;implicity, his picture&s;que minutene&s;s, conduct his reader into the &s;cene of action. You &s;ee, hear, and feel, ju&s;t as the author actually did; and this it&s;elf is a talent of high excellence. Amid&s;t much en|tertainment, candour will forgive the &s;erious or affected vanity that &s;ometimes peeps through the curtain of his mind. The&s;e two writers have been neglected. An e&s;timate of the &s;ales may induce a belief that they have never been peru&s;ed by more than two or three thou&s;and American citizens, that is to &s;ay, by perhaps a two-hundredth part of the community at large. Without &s;uch a peru&s;al, however, it is impo&s;&s;ible to comprehend the nature and effects of the we&s;tern riots. The declama|tion that fills the federal gazettes and pamphlets cannot afford a ju&s;t or luminous conception of this all-important &s;ubject; which is, therefore, gro&s;sly and almo&s;t univer&s;ally mi&s;under&s;tood. Next to the compo&s;ition of a good book by your&s;elf, one of the be&s;t &s;ervices to the public is the recommending of another which has been ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">looked.</P>
<P>After thus explaining where a proper account of the in&s;urrection may be found, we go back to the pre&s;ident, his congre&s;s, and his &s;peech. <Q>It has been a &s;pectacle, &s;ays he, di&s;playing to the
<PB N="120" REF="033485_0119_0FF720185C597240">
highe&s;t advantage, the value of republican govern|ment, to behold the mo&s;t and the lea&s;t wealthy of our citizens &s;tanding in the ranks as private &s;oldiers, pre-eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed by being the army of the con&s;titution.</Q> He ought to have &s;aid, of <HI>monarchical</HI> government, for every part of the bu&s;ine&s;s bore the &s;tamp of de&s;poti&s;m. In the fir&s;t place, the four counties were outlawed, on the &s;in|gle notification of judge Wil&s;on. That <HI>any</HI> &s;ingle man &s;hould have been entru&s;ted with &s;o va&s;t a di&s;|cretionary power was incon&s;i&s;tent with <HI>republican</HI> freedom.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington &s;ent commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with the in&s;urgents, but if Hamilton had been pre|&s;ident, he would immediately have marched again&s;t them, and the four counties mu&s;t have been co|vered with blood and a&s;hes, by the official temerity of one man, and the ferocious impetuo&s;ity of ano|ther. This is but a poor &s;pecimen of republican go|vernment, and yet it might take place.</P>
<P>Again, the army was rai&s;ed on principles purely <HI>monarchical.</HI> The pre&s;ident acted &s;olely on the au|thority of a law inve&s;ting him, during the rece&s;s of congre&s;s, with unlimited power, a law that may one day overturn the con&s;titution. Let us explain it by the following &s;uppo&s;ition. The pre&s;ent congre&s;s will cea&s;e to exi&s;t, on the 3d of March, 1799. On the 4th, Mr. Adams may get a certificate from &s;ome confidential judge, that Virginia or Tenne&s;&s;ee is in a &s;tate of rebellion. Whether the &s;tory be true or fal&s;e, re&s;ts entirely within his brea&s;t. He directly calls out the militia, and, as this in&s;urrection is ten times more dangerous than that of Braddock's field, he requires an hundred and fifty thou&s;and men. He &s;ets out at their head, parades four or eight hundred miles, renews the horrors of the we&s;tern expedition, and, till the fir&s;t Monday of December thereafter, he
<PB N="121" REF="033485_0120_0FF67B8E82DC77B8">
and his militia are ab&s;olute ma&s;ters of America. They proceed, at an expence of two hundred thou|&s;and dollars per day, to be drawn from a trea&s;ury which has not one &s;pare &s;hilling. No part of the con&s;titution can, practically, &s;top Mr. Adams in his progre&s;s. The legi&s;lature does not a&s;&s;emble till the fir&s;t Monday of December, unle&s;s the mere accident of a law, by their predece&s;&s;ors, may have ordained a more early date. Even this remedy could ea&s;ily be prevented. On a preconcerted plan, the majority in the &s;enate would be &s;ure to reject any bill for the more early meeting of congre&s;s. Thus nine months of a royal <HI>interregnum</HI> might readily put an end to the government. The precedent &s;et by general Wa&s;hington, for emptying the trea&s;ury, would greatly facilitate &s;uch a con&s;piracy. The above explanation clearly proves, that, <HI>according to law,</HI> our lives and properties may &s;oon be at the mercy of &s;ome chief magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>The federal army did not, then, di&s;play the &s;pectacle of a <HI>republic,</HI> but the embryo of royalty hatched in the dregs of legi&s;lative ignorance. Con|gre&s;s gave the pre&s;ident authority as good as unli|mited, for rai&s;ing an army; but they forgot to in|form him in what way that army was to be paid. This was, as if a merchant &s;hould &s;end a &s;hip to the We&s;t-Indies, and forget to furni&s;h her with bi&s;|cuit or water. What imbecility, what unacquain|tance with the fir&s;t principles of legi&s;lation, are un|folded in this congre&s;&s;ional performance! Its wor&s;t parts might be amended by a clau&s;e like the fol|lowing.</P>
<P><Q>The pre&s;ident &s;hall not be permitted to call out the militia, till he has held a council with the vice-pre&s;ident, the three &s;ecretaries, the at|torney-general, and the governors of at lea&s;t four of the &s;tates neare&s;t to the &s;eat of the fede|ral
<PB N="122" REF="033485_0121_0FF7201F4DBC72F0">
government. Of the&s;e nine, &s;ix with him&s;elf may form a quorum; and a majority of at lea&s;t five members, &s;hall decide. Every opinion &s;hall be given in writing, and each of the council &s;hall be an&s;werable and impeachable for his vote. The proclamation for the actual calling out of the militia &s;hould be directed to contain a &s;um|mons for the meeting of congre&s;s, it being other|wi&s;e high trea&s;on to obey the call. Leave &s;hould al&s;o be granted to take the requi&s;ite &s;ums from the trea&s;ury; or if not there, a ca&s;e very likely, the council might be authorized to open a loan.</Q></P>
<P>Till &s;ome amendment of this kind &s;hall be made, the liberty of the United States mu&s;t be in &s;eri|ous hazard. General Wa&s;hington went to the trea&s;ury. Some future pre&s;ident may go to the bank. The one &s;tep will not be a jot wor&s;e than the other. The act, when amended, &s;hould be an|nexed to the con&s;titution, le&s;t &s;ome future congre&s;s might dare to repeal it. The pro&s;pect of mi&s;chief is not di&s;tant. Its approach may &s;oon be expected. Deriving, like Venus, his birth from the deep, the United States have already been harra&s;&s;ed with their Machiavel. If Wa&s;hington did not act that of Cromwell, it may be a&s;cribed to the &s;oundne&s;s of his judgment, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that a party who ba&s;ked under the &s;plendour of his name, left him almo&s;t nothing to be de&s;ired.</P>
<P>We return to the pre&s;ident's &s;peech. He advi|&s;es the citizens of the America to cheri&s;h their con|&s;titution, not merely for their own &s;akes, but <Q>for the &s;ake of tho&s;e, who, from every clime, are daily &s;eeking a dwelling in our land.</Q> This &s;ounds very well; and, if Mr. Jay's treaty had con|tained one line for the protection of emigrants from the Briti&s;h dominions to America, it might have
<PB N="123" REF="033485_0122_0FF72020E26607C0">
been believed that, in the above expre&s;&s;ion, Mr. Wa&s;hington was &s;incere. The pre&s;&s;ing of men from Iri&s;h pa&s;&s;enger &s;hips, on the coa&s;t of America, is not only, in it&s;elf, an act of &s;hocking cruelty, but an egregious in&s;ult on this country. In Novem|ber, 1794, when this &s;peech was delivered, Mr. Wa&s;hington had profe&s;&s;edly put him&s;elf at the head of that party who revile emigrants in the ma&s;s, who want to exclude them from voting at elections, and who, in &s;ummer 1797, wanted to pa&s;s a &s;tamp duty of an hundred dollars, on their admi&s;&s;ion as citizens.</P>
<P>In a &s;ub&s;equent paragraph, the pre&s;ident &s;peaks of having extended his <HI>protection to the Creeks.</HI> This pa&s;&s;age has already been critici&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of the United States for 1796, Chap. VII.</NOTE>; but I &s;ubjoin a circum&s;tance that has not yet reached the new&s;papers. On the 8th of November, 1794, only eleven days before the delivery of this &s;peech, the &s;ecretary at war received a letter from the go|vernor of Georgia. It inclo&s;ed a depo&s;ition concern|ing two murders by the Creeks. On the 30th of September, preceeding, they had, near fort Fidius, &s;hot down and &s;calped Catharine Ce&s;&s;na, a young lady. Five of them had, al&s;o, &s;hot and &s;calped a ne|gro woman. Governor Matthews further mentions, &s;ome thefts of negroes and hor&s;es, committed by Indians, in Liberty county; and that the Talli&s;ee king, and Broken Arrow, were both for war. With this letter before him, the pre&s;ident came forward, and, without one word about avenging the blood of Catharine Ce&s;&s;na, and of a multitude of &s;imilar victims, harangued on his &s;ucce&s;s in the protection of her a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. This ca&s;e is only a &s;ample of, per|haps, a thou&s;and, equally horrid, and equally un|avenged. The honour of America, if one may &s;peak
<PB N="124" REF="033485_0123_0FF720227130F4E0">
of non-entities, hath been as ba&s;ely pro&s;trated by land as by &s;ea.</P>
<P>How little rea&s;on tho&s;e &s;avages had to complain, appears from the copy of a talk with them, tran&s;|mitted by the governor of Georgia to the &s;ecretary of war, in a letter dated Augu&s;ta, Augu&s;t 19th, 1794. The piece is too long to be in&s;erted here; but the following extracts are made from an atte&s;t|ed manu&s;cript of it. After &s;tating the treaty of New-York, he &s;ays, <Q>&s;ome goods were promi&s;ed to you, which you received, and you were to make a plain line between our people and yours. This you <HI>failed to do.</HI></Q> He then relates, that when they and their families were in want of corn, the pre&s;i|dent &s;ent them a gratuitous &s;upply. He al&s;o opened a &s;tore at St. Mary's to furni&s;h them with goods. They murdered the men who kept it, and carried off the goods. The murderers were not puni&s;hed, nor any &s;atisfaction given. <Q>You have killed many of our citizens, &s;ays the governor, and car|ried away a great number of our hor&s;es, cattle, and negroes. All this your father, general Wa&s;h|ington, has <HI>borne with,</HI> from a wi&s;h to be the friend of your nation.&mdash;You a&s;k about forts.&mdash; They are on the north &s;ide of the river, and on the land that was given by your nation at the treaty at New-York, for which you have been paid; and I cannot &s;ee why you complain of it. By that treaty your nation is to receive twelve hundred dollars a year for the lands, which is ten times as much as all the game you can kill on <HI>it</HI> in one year is worth. I cannot &s;ee how your na|tion can di&s;pute the river's being the line, as it was agreed on at <HI>three</HI> treaties in Georgia, and the <HI>one</HI> at New-York.</Q> Such were the people to whom the pre&s;ident gave his protection. The
<PB N="125" REF="033485_0124_0FF72024F93AF0A0">
&s;peech has not even one hint about the defence of citizens on the Georgian frontier.</P>
<P><Q>From a de&s;ire, al&s;o, &s;ays the pre&s;ident, to remove the di&s;contents of the Six Nations, a &s;et|tlement meditated at Pre&s;qu' I&s;le, on lake Erie, has been &s;u&s;pended; and an agent is now endea|vouring to rectify any <HI>mi&s;conception,</HI> into which they may have fallen.</Q> The matter was &s;hortly this. No mi&s;conception exi&s;ted on the part of the Indians, excepting from Engli&s;h bribery. A letter from general Wilkins to Clement Biddle, quarter|ma&s;ter general of Penn&s;ylvania, explains the &s;tory. It is dated April 25th, 1794, and mentions, that Cornplanter and other Indians had been invited to an Engli&s;h council at Buffaloe creek. <Q>On the re|&s;ult of that council, &s;ays the general, &s;eems to hang war or peace between us and the Six Na|tions. <HI>There have been a great deal of pains u&s;ed lately by the Engli&s;h to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our their minds, and they &s;eem, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to have effected it.</HI></Q> A let|ter from general Gib&s;on to governor Mifflin, dated Pitt&s;burg, June 11th, 1794, inclo&s;es a depo&s;ition by David Ran&s;om, informing, that Cornplanter had been bought by the Briti&s;h, and that there had been a plot to cut off the &s;ettlers at Pre&s;qu' I&s;le. Captain Denny, in a letter to general Gib&s;on, dated 14th and 16th of June, 1794, confirms this intelligence. The corre&s;pondence contains many other circum|&s;tances, proving the ho&s;tile de&s;igns of the Briti&s;h. It was not, therefore, an Indian mi&s;conception, but an Engli&s;h con&s;piracy; and if the pre&s;ident did not chu&s;e to tell the &s;tory candidly, he &s;hould have been &s;ilent. Even without defending Genet, one cannot &s;ay that he came within an hundred degrees of the guilt of governor Simcoe. Genet wanted the United States to attack the enemies of France; but Simcoe wanted the Indians to attack the United States. We

had not done the &s;malle&s;t injury either to the Six Nations or to England. The perfidy of the latter can|not, therefore, admit of aggravation. The French had a&s;&s;i&s;ted this country in obtaining her liberty, and now &s;olicited her to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the &s;ecuring of theirs. It might be improper in America to grant the reque&s;t, but it was extremely natural in the French to make it.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing over the re&s;t of this &s;peech, we come next to the an&s;wer of the &s;enate. It ran as u&s;ual, in a ful&s;ome echo. As if this tri&s;le had been worth notice, the pre&s;ident replied with much &s;atisfaction on finding that his conduct was approved by <Q>the enlightened repre&s;entatives of a free nation.</Q> In the la&s;t &s;entence, he alluded to <Q>tho&s;e <HI>judicious</HI> and <HI>&s;pirited</HI> exertions, which have brought VIC|TORY to our we&s;tern army.</Q> He was at the head of an army for &s;even years and an half. He was &s;everal times beaten. His fame, as a conquer|or, re&s;ts on the capture of nine hundred He&s;&s;ians<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What a figure would our American campaigns make be&s;ide the hi&s;tory of the war of &s;even years!

From what hath &s;ince tran&s;pired, a &s;ingle Briti&s;h regiment of foot, another of hor&s;e, and two field pieces would, at a twentieth part of the expence, have been altogether equal to the performances of our fifteen thou&s;and militia.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer of congratulation from the &s;enate pa&s;t immediately. That from the repre&s;entatives co&s;t more time. They began to debate on Monday the 24th of November, 1794; and this fir&s;t day was &s;pent on a notable di&s;pute. One part of the propo&s;ed addre&s;s had the&s;e words: <Q>we cannot otherwi&s;e than warmly approve of <HI>a</HI> policy in our foreign affairs.</Q> &amp;c. <HI>Your</HI> policy was recom|mended as better. After exactly twenty &s;pecches upon it, the clau&s;e was wholely withdrawn, as the hou&s;e could not agree, and were a&s;hamed to divide on the re&s;pective merits of the article and the pronoun. The pre&s;ident had ca&s;t an oblique reflection on <HI>&s;elf-crea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d &s;ocieties</HI> as fomenting the in&s;urrection. It was propo&s;ed that the an&s;wer &s;hould echo this cen&s;ure <HI>verbatim.</HI> The debate la&s;ted till Thur&s;day afternoon; and the preci&s;e echo was rejected by forty-&s;even votes again&s;t forty-&s;ix. Next morning, &s;ome loquacious members wan|ted to renew the conte&s;t. On this, Mr. M'Dowell &s;aid, that <HI>twenty-five</HI> days of the &s;e&s;&s;ion were now elap&s;ed, and he was as at a lo&s;s to know <HI>what the hou&s;e had been doing.</HI> The words <HI>combinations of men</HI> were put in&s;tead of <HI>&s;elf-created &s;ocieties</HI> into the repercu&s;&s;ion of cen&s;ure. Thus the an&s;wer pa&s;t.</P>
<P>It is proper to take &s;ome notice of the&s;e traits, as a warning to future legi&s;latures. After all this wrangling, the paper in que&s;tion proved but a poor production. If truth or rea&s;on, or the public &s;er|vice, had been at all con&s;ulted, the hou&s;e would have begun by a&s;king the executive why he took from the trea&s;ury eleven hundred thou&s;and dollars,
<PB N="128" REF="033485_0127_0FF7202F639AF5B0">
without their leave, and in contempt of the con&s;ti|tution? Why he did not take mea&s;ures, as he ve|ry well might have done, for checking this riot in the bud? Why he rai&s;ed an army of &s;uch enor|mous numbers, when a fifth part of them, at the utmo&s;t, could have done the bu&s;ine&s;s? Why he permitted Alexander Hamilton to engro&s;s &s;uch ex|travagant authority? Why the whole country was in&s;ulted, the pri&s;oners, and even witne&s;&s;es &s;o bar|barou&s;ly treated? And why he was awed by &s;uch diminutive enemies as the Tali&s;&s;ee king, Broken Arrow, and the Cornplanter?</P>
<P>It was not from want of good will, in forty-&s;even members, that the&s;e que&s;tions were avoided. But, &s;uch was the popularity of the pre&s;ident, and the univer&s;al rage excited again&s;t the rioters, that the &s;malle&s;t re&s;i&s;tance to adulation of the executive, would have been held as bad as trea&s;on. In allu|&s;ion to the a&s;&s;embling of the militia, the repre|&s;entatives, amid&s;t other encomiums, have the following words: <Q>the &s;pectacle, therefore, when viewed in its true light, may well be affirmed to di&s;play, in equal lu&s;tre, the virtues of the Ame|rican character, and the value of republican government.</Q> Such a racket has been made about the rai&s;ing of this we&s;tern army, and the &s;ublime patrioti&s;m by which it was in&s;pired, that &s;omething more &s;hall be &s;aid upon it.</P>
<P>If the we&s;tern people had been able or willing to &s;tand an attack, not one half of the militia were fit for fighting. The ranks were crouded by young men, altogether unacquainted with the u&s;e of arms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A journeyman printer, from the office of the Philadelphia Ga|zette, went out upon his fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay, as a private.

Smith told the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives that <Q>num|bers of the militia did not know how to &s;et up a tent. The Virginian militia who went out, were neither trained nor di&s;ciplined. As for the Ma|rylanders, when he drew part of them out, and ordered them to load, he found that fifty of them had put down the ball before the <HI>charge of pow|der.</HI> Some of them did not even know how to lay a gun over their &s;houlders.</Q> A merchant would not entru&s;t, as his book-keeper, a clerk, who put the wrong end of his pen into an ink-&s;tandi&s;h; or who was ignorant of the difference between addi|tion and &s;ubtraction. Yet &s;uch a novice would be ju&s;t as fit for the de&s;k, as the&s;e militia were for the camp. When you take up the &s;ubject in this point of view, when you reflect on the folly of con|ducting troops like the&s;e into actual &s;ervice, your mind mu&s;t feel a &s;udden oppre&s;&s;ion under the bur&s;t of a&s;toni&s;hment. There could be no u&s;e in &s;ending &s;uch people to reduce an in&s;urrection. It was the mo&s;t unmilitary management conceivable. If fight|ing was wanted, the&s;e raw recruits were u&s;ele&s;s. If the country beyond the mountains was peceable, their multitude would only make them in&s;olent and mi&s;chievous. A &s;mall part of their own number of French or Briti&s;h veterans would have cru&s;hed them like an apple in the cyder pre&s;s. In his hi&s;|tory of the war of &s;even years, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia gives a le&s;&s;on on this head. He &s;ays that when his armies had been ordered into winter quarters, the recruits for the next campaign were collected as early as po&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e it required three or four months to teach them the exerci&s;e. Between the two proclamations of the pre&s;ident, the one for being in readine&s;s, and the &s;econd for marching, only &s;even weeks intervened, and within that time not all the drill &s;ergeants of Potzdam could have
<PB N="130" REF="033485_0129_0FF7203293ACC9F8">
taught them the u&s;e of arms. But if Frederic re|quired three or four months to form a &s;oldier, the be&s;t officer in the United States would need longer time. Whatever then congre&s;s, or the pre|&s;ident, might think of &s;uch a <HI>&s;pectacle,</HI> no reader of &s;ober and impartial under&s;tanding will ad|mire that kind of general&s;hip which a&s;&s;embled &s;e|veral thou&s;ands of raw lads from the plough and the work&s;hop, and di&s;patched them three hundred miles in que&s;t of an enemy.</P>
<P>Put the ca&s;e that out of the&s;e troops one third were real &s;oldiers, who had &s;een &s;ervice, and ac|quired military feelings. The other ten thou&s;and who put in the ball before the charge, or who committed acts of equivalent ignorance, were a mere burden on the profe&s;&s;ional men. The latter would have been more formidable without them. The&s;e matters are &s;o very clear that it is almo&s;t a &s;hame to repeat them. Yet, if the government of a country chu&s;es to commit its character by &s;uch proceedings, the public have a right to re|view them.</P>
<P>We &s;hall be &s;afe in computing that the &s;uper|numeraries of the exci&s;e army, co&s;t &s;ix hundred thou&s;and dollars of extra and u&s;ele&s;s expence. Five thou&s;and good &s;oldiers, if the camp contained as many, would have been quite equal to the bu&s;ine&s;s. Suppo&s;e that the remaining ten thou&s;and were ab|&s;ent from their common employments for ninety working days. At the common and moderate com|putation of a dollar per day, the lo&s;s of labour, by the enli&s;tment of the&s;e ten thou&s;and hands, comes to nine hundred thou&s;and dollars. Add this to, per|haps, &s;ix hundred thou&s;and dollars, of money ad|vanced from the trea&s;ury, for the expence of the

<P>For the la&s;t three years, or thereabouts, two and an half per cent. per month has been a common rate of intere&s;t among many of our merchants. It has often been at five per cent. The above e&s;timate of thirty per cent. a year falls by far &s;hort of the lowe&s;t of the&s;e two rates, as the monthly compound in|tere&s;t is kept out of &s;ight. Here we &s;ee that the in|&s;urrection was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed at an enormou&s;ly greater expence than was nece&s;&s;ary. A general alarm was rai&s;ed in behalf of the con&s;titution, an alarm very laudable, if it had been exactly founded on facts. This, along with the ultimate &s;ucce&s;s of the expe|dition, and the intere&s;ted encomiums of Mr. Ha|milton's regiment, have &s;hed a lu&s;tre over the whole tran&s;action, that no part of it de&s;erves. Before the citizens of the United States ru&s;h upon the extirpa|tion of a &s;econd in&s;urrection, they will do well to be &s;ure of its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>A ca&s;e has been imagined, in a former page, of a pre&s;ident, during the rece&s;s of congre&s;s, ha&s;ting the country into a civil war. It is po&s;&s;ible that his conduct might merit impeachment; and for this, or other offences, the con&s;titution has re&s;erved a remedy. He is to be tried by the &s;enate, and the chief ju&s;tice &s;hall pre&s;ide. He cannot be convicted unle&s;s by the concurrence of two-thirds of the members pre&s;ent. The latter clau&s;e is equitable; for candour will pre&s;ume that a pre&s;ident acts for the be&s;t; and it would be iniquitous to condemn him by the ca&s;ting vote of a &s;enator, who, in the eye of law, and mo&s;t likely of rea&s;on, is not a better
<PB N="132" REF="033485_0131_0FF72039D9C15E58">
man than him&s;elf. But a &s;erious objection lies again&s;t the tribunal before which he is to be tried. One of the mo&s;t likely ca&s;es of an impeachment would re|gard foreign treaties, becau&s;e, in the&s;e there would be the greate&s;t ri&s;k of corruption, and of con&s;equent treachery. Here the con&s;titution leaves us, like a whale on the &s;trand, for the pre&s;ident cannot act without the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Wa&s;hington, at the nomination of John Jay, did, in &s;ub|&s;tance, make a partial breach of this part of the con&s;titution. See Hi&s;tory of the Untied States for 1796, Chap. V.</NOTE>, and if he and two-thirds of them &s;hould think fit to &s;ell America, &s;he has only to &s;ubmit to the purcha&s;er. Even in the event of dome&s;tic mi&s;management, as little can be hoped from the vigilance or virtue of the <HI>upper</HI> hou&s;e. They have already broached a doctrine the wilde&s;t and mo&s;t criminal, that has pro|bably been ever heard of in a legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">American Annual Regi&s;ter, Chap. V.</NOTE>; and general Ma&s;on did only one-half of his duty to the country, when he forbore to publi&s;h that en|gulphing tenet. There is no a&s;&s;urance, nor, indeed, much probability, that any future &s;enate will po&s;|&s;e&s;s more information, or integrity, or indepen|dence, than the members now in office. A pre&s;ident has always in his gift a variety of appointments, &s;ufficient to &s;ecure a majority of two-thirds. This tribunal, then, for the purpo&s;e of his impeachment, is entirely u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>The pro&s;pect of ju&s;tice would not be much im|proved by a transference to the hou&s;e of repre&s;en|tatives. Perhaps the &s;afe&s;t and faire&s;t way of pro|&s;ecuting the chief magi&s;trate might be to name de|legates from each of the &s;tates, in the numbers and proportions that &s;hould be found advi&s;eable.

<P>Seven letters, under the &s;ignature of Manlius, appeared, &s;ometime ago, in the Columbian Centi|nel. The fir&s;t of them is dated the 3d, and the la&s;t, on the 17th of September, 1794. They con&s;i&s;t of furious invective again&s;t the republican party. In No. III. the writer complains, that <Q>Mr. Dexter, noted for &s;olidity of judgment, &s;trength and per&s;picuity of rea&s;oning, elegance and accuracy of &s;tile, in an anarchical gazette of Philadelphia, is made to talk <HI>like a &s;chool boy.</HI></Q> If Manlius want|ed to mock Mr. Dexter, his attempt is &s;ucce&s;sful. If he wanted the public to believe his panegyric, he betrays his own want of judgment or veracity. No per&s;on has, for the la&s;t four years, ever &s;o in|tolerably tired the patience of congre&s;s, as Mr. Dexter, if we except Robert Harper, and even the latter is greatly &s;uperior to the former. He has in|genuity, information, and an ea&s;y delivery, if he could only know when to &s;top. In the &s;e&s;&s;ion of November, 1796, he made two very intere&s;ting &s;peeches; the one for the widow of John de Neuf|ville,
<PB N="135" REF="033485_0134_0FF72041F7FAAC58">
and the other, for the inhabitants of Savan|nah.</P>
<P>Of democratic &s;ocieties, Manlius, No. I. &s;peaks thus. <Q>They have oppo&s;ed their <HI>veto</HI> to the doings of the pre&s;ident, to the laws of the union, and to the will of the whole people.</Q> [<HI>Veto</HI> is a word borrowed from the tribunes of ancient Rome. By pronouncing it, they prevented the enacting of a law. The &s;ocieties never made even a motion in any legi&s;lature whatever, nor have they endeavour|ed to ob&s;truct the execution of any law. If they had done &s;o, they would have been apprehended, and the di&s;pute would have been decided in a court of ju&s;tice. They did nothing more than publi&s;h their opinions. They were warranted to do &s;o, by the con&s;titution, which declares, that <Q>congre&s;s &s;hall make no law abridging <HI>the freedom of &s;peech,</HI> or of <HI>the pre&s;s</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Additional Articles, No. III.</NOTE>.</Q> If they went too far the attorney general could &s;top them.] "They have arraigned," &s;ays Manlius, <Q>the conduct of the mo&s;t wi&s;e and virtuous citizen now on earth; they have de|clared that this beloved fir&s;t magi&s;trate hath trampled on the con&s;titution.</Q> [There never was a chief magi&s;trate in the world, who e&s;caped with|out arraignment. We might as well attempt to keep mankind from coughing, or &s;neezing, as ex|pect that any government can give univer&s;al &s;atis|faction. The democratic &s;ocieties only did what occurs in every a&s;&s;embly of the human race. They cen&s;ured their government, and &s;o do the &s;laves of Dahomey and Morocco.] <Q>They have excited oppo&s;ition to the laws; and, an <HI>armed</HI> rebellion, probably, in con&s;equence of their fal&s;e &s;ugge&s;|tions, is actually rai&s;ed in the very centre of the United States.

<PB N="136" REF="033485_0135_0FF7204485AD9918">
been <HI>murdered,</HI> and their dwellings burnt to the ground. They have endeavoured to involve the country in all the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of war; while they have oppo&s;ed the adoption of every mea&s;ure to prepare for this dreadful calamity.</Q></P>
<P>This extract pre&s;ents a fair &s;ample of the &s;tile of Manlius. His letters have been reprinted in a pamphlet, and enjoy &s;ome &s;ort of reputation. The preceding pa&s;&s;age is one of tho&s;e few, wherein we can di&s;robe him of the mi&s;t of declamation, and gra&s;p him on the ground of facts. <Q>Many of our fellow citizens have been murdered.</Q> The papers publi&s;hed by government &s;peak of no &s;uch mur|ders. But previous to the burning of Neville's hou&s;e, and in a &s;eries of three years, about eight per&s;ons had been maltreated. On the 6th of Sep|tember, 1791, Robert John&s;ton, an exci&s;e officer, was tarred and feathered at Pigeon-creek, in Wa&s;hington county, by a party in di&s;gui&s;e. Four other ca&s;es of the &s;ame nature occurred &s;oon after. One of the &s;ufferers was a lunatic, and another a private per&s;on, who had innocently re|marked, that, when people did not obey govern|ment, they could not look for its protection. It does not appear that any puni&s;hment was inflic|ted on the&s;e offenders, and hence the executive mu&s;t have expected a continuation of outrages. An office of in&s;pection for Wa&s;hington county was opened in Augu&s;t, 1792, at the hou&s;e of cap|tain William Faulkner. This man was &s;oon after threatened with de&s;truction, unle&s;s he turned away the in&s;pector. He did &s;o and no per&s;onal violence was committed. Di&s;orderly meetings went on, and &s;till the executive forbore to cru&s;h them.</P>
<P>In April, 1793, a party in di&s;gui&s;e, broke, du|ring the night, into the hou&s;e of an exci&s;e officer in Fayette county. He was from home, but they
<PB N="137" REF="033485_0136_0FF7204707E18848">
abu&s;ed his family. Warrants for apprehending them were delivered to the &s;heriff at Fayette. He did not, and probably dur&s;t not, execute them. Still government per&s;i&s;ted in its want of energy. If re|bellion had been the object of the cabinet of Phi|ladelphia, this was the very way to nur&s;e it. Such apparent lenity was the height of real barbarity. Every new act of blackguardi&s;m &s;anctioned that which was to come next; and every day mu&s;t have increa&s;ed the di&s;re&s;pect for &s;ocial order. It was in a high degree culpable for government thus tamely to &s;tand by, and permit the flames of bru|tality and &s;edition to extend unre&s;i&s;ted from one year to another.</P>
<P>On the 22d of November, 1793, a party again vi&s;ited the hou&s;e of the collector of exci&s;e in Fay|ette county, for whom they had &s;earched in April. He gave up his books and commi&s;&s;ion. Yet it is own|ed that about the end of 1793, the law appeared to be gaining ground. The &s;malle&s;t exertion of execu|tive power mu&s;t have en&s;ured its ultimate &s;ucce&s;s. Some of the principal recu&s;ant di&s;tillers began to comply, and others di&s;covered a di&s;po&s;ition to do &s;o. One of the former had his barn burnt. The &s;till-hou&s;e of a &s;econd was de&s;troyed; that of a third narrowly e&s;caped the &s;ame fate; and his gri&s;t and &s;aw mills were damaged. The blame mu&s;t fall entirely on the timidity or negligence of admini|&s;tration. <Q>The mo&s;t <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>virtuous</HI> citizen now on earth,</Q> can gain no more honour by this ama|zing inattention to his duty than he formerly did by &s;hooting the French officer who advanced with a flag of truce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Smollet's Hi&s;tory of the War of 1756. The court of Ver|&s;ailles made all Europe ring with complaints on this &s;trange con|duct.</NOTE>. On the 6th of June, 1794, an act of violence occurred in Wa&s;hington county. The
<PB N="138" REF="033485_0137_0FF72048B6EC4D80">
office of exci&s;e was kept in the hou&s;e of John Lynn, who was tarred, feathered, and tied to a tree. Some days after, part of his hou&s;e was pulled down. From the fir&s;t violence committed on Ro|bert John&s;ton to the la&s;t date, two years and nine months had elap&s;ed. During this long interval, the executive looked on, like the mariner, who &s;ees his ve&s;&s;el &s;pringing a leak, but who lets the hold be half filled with water before he tries to &s;top it. If a thou&s;and well affected militia had been quartered in the vicinage of the rioters who a&s;&s;aulted Mr. John&s;ton, if they had been driven out of the coun|try, or &s;ent to the workhou&s;e, we &s;hould have heard nothing of a we&s;tern in&s;urrection; or of a wa&s;te of public money, of property, and of time, to the va|lue of &s;ome millions of dollars. It is well known that a rabble, when unre&s;i&s;ted, always proceed from bad to wor&s;e, till the violence of the di&s;order pro|duces a remedy, which is often more dangerous than the di&s;ea&s;e. The &s;malle&s;t political fore&s;ight might have di&s;covered that, fir&s;t or la&s;t, it would be needful to extend the arm of power, and that the &s;ooner this was done &s;o much the better.</P>
<P>This detail of circum&s;tances mu&s;t, in every can|did mind, alleviate the blame of the we&s;tern riot|ers. Their ignorance was as much to be pitied, as their barbarity was to be dete&s;ted. They were permitted to advance by gradual and even by an|nual &s;teps to the brink of de&s;truction. They were then pitched over the precipice, with an in|&s;olence and ferocity of vengeance that &s;ink the judge to a level with the criminal. As for Man|lius, and his <HI>numerous murders,</HI> they are the offspring of his own calumnious fancy. The in&s;urgents do not &s;eem ever to have &s;hed &s;o much as a &s;ingle drop of blood, excepting at Neville's
<PB N="139" REF="033485_0138_0FF7204E59E17148">
hou&s;e, where three of the defenders were wounded. From the publications of the times, Manlius mu&s;t have known that his a&s;&s;ertion was an untruth. With his eyes open, he circulated this fal&s;ehood to promote incendiary and infamous purpo&s;es. Such is the patriot, who rails at democratic &s;o|cieties.</P>
<P>Of this we&s;tern in&s;urrection it has become the mark of a party to &s;peak in &s;trong terms. On April 12th, 1796, judge Iredell, of the &s;upreme court of the United States, referring chiefly to this rupture, delivered a charge to the grand jury of Penn&s;ylvania. Some parts of it are open to objec|tion. De&s;cribing the &s;uperior excellence of the American con&s;titution, he &s;ays, that, in other coun|tries, <Q>&s;u&s;picion has &s;upplied the place of evi|dence.&mdash;The highe&s;t in&s;tances of public virtue have been doomed to the puni&s;hment of the high|e&s;t public offences. Happily for the United States, &s;uch &s;cenes have been known to them <HI>only by the hi&s;tory of other nations.</HI></Q> This is wrong. In the ca&s;es of Randolph, and of &s;heriff Hamilton, the mo&s;t direct evidence was &s;et a&s;ide by &s;u&s;picion. The numerous in&s;tances of oppre&s;&s;ion committed in the we&s;t, under the eye, though not by the de&s;ire of judge Peters, prove, that here, as in other coun|tries, government may oppre&s;s with impunity. The judge then alludes to the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the in&s;ur|rection, <Q>a period which will form as bright a page, as any in the American annals.</Q></P>

In the camp at Carnaghan's, in We&s;tmoreland, the mo&s;t expe|rienced officers were afraid, that the di&s;orders com|mitted by the army would ruin the country.

<P>When judge Iredell, Manlius, and other friends of order, indulge them&s;elves in prai&s;es of the we&s;tern army; in declamations again&s;t the in|&s;urgents; and, in arraignments again&s;t the demo|cratic &s;ocieties, they will do wi&s;ely to reflect on the particulars here &s;tated. Such an army was, when taken collectively, as great an object of terror as the in&s;urrection it&s;elf. No democratic &s;ociety has done any act that approaches to the bacchanalian project of burning Carli&s;le. It is affirmed, that the &s;ocieties wanted to plunge America into a Briti&s;h war. This project did po&s;&s;ibly float in the brains of a &s;mall number of madmen. That it could be the de&s;ire of any con&s;iderable part of the members is untrue. But even a Briti&s;h war was &s;till le&s;s dreadful than a civil one; and if it had not been for &s;ome officers of experience, and, above all, for the re&s;pect paid to the pre&s;ident, this &s;anctified we&s;tern army would have produced a &s;econd rebellion, before at|tempting
<PB N="142" REF="033485_0141_0FF7205438386CF0">
to quell the fir&s;t one. The &s;ober portion of the troops were on the point of being obliged to attack the rioters within their own ranks.</P>
<P>How dreadful mu&s;t have been the condition of the United States, if Carli&s;le had actually been de|&s;troyed. It is weakne&s;s to &s;hrink from the retro&s;pect of this woeful probability, or to hold up <Q>the army of the con&s;titution</Q> as a pattern for future ages. From the hurry with which that corps was huddled together, nothing &s;plendid could ju&s;tly be expected. If Alexander Hamilton had advi&s;ed the previous calling of congre&s;s, or if he had, in 1791, pur&s;ued proper mea&s;ures to check the out&s;et of the riots, he would have rendered an eminent &s;ervice to the United States. Proceeding with judge Iredell, he tells the grand jury, that the in&s;urgents were &s;e|duced <Q>by the ba&s;e&s;t artifices, and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t mi&s;|repre&s;entations of a few de&s;igning men; who&s;e views, in all probability, were much deeper, and more malignant than they were <HI>avowed to be.</HI></Q> The judge ought to have &s;pecified who the&s;e <HI>few de&s;igning men</HI> are, otherwi&s;e he &s;inks to the &s;ame rank with Manlius, Curtius, Camillus, aad the re&s;t of that tribe, who prattle about con&s;piracies alike incomprehen&s;ible to them&s;elves and every per&s;on el&s;e. If he refers to Findley, Smilie, Brackenridge, and Gallatin, Mr. Hamilton &s;trained every nerve, without finding a &s;park of evidence again&s;t them. The judge cannot &s;urely want to trump up another edition of Fauchet's romance; and if that is not his object, he &s;hould, in defence of his own reputation, declare what was his meaning.</P>
<P>Again, we hear that the in&s;urrection was &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed in a manner <Q>worthy of the government of a free people.</Q> He &s;hould have added, as in the in&s;tance of &s;heriff Hamilton, of major Powers, of the deputies of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion menaced with murder,
<PB N="143" REF="033485_0142_0FF72059DD32CEC8">
of the expected conflagration of Carli&s;le, or of the man knocked down for a&s;king the price of a quart of whi&s;key. To this paper the grand jury replied, that the in&s;urrection <Q>has, however, been attended with good con&s;equences.&mdash;It has offered another <HI>proof</HI> of the firmne&s;s, the wi&s;dom, and benevo|lence of our much beloved pre&s;ident.&mdash;It has opened the eyes of a once deluded people.</Q> This is the &s;um total of advantages named by the jury. They have co&s;t a wa&s;te of two or three millions of dollars; two or three millions of calumnies in the federal new&s;papers; and vexation, oppre&s;&s;ion, and ruin to a great number of people. Eyes have, in|deed, been opened; but what have they &s;een? the horrors of military de&s;poti&s;m, inflicted by a raw militia; the impo&s;&s;ibility, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, of obtaining redre&s;s; the u&s;urpation of both civil and military powers, by a &s;ecretary of the trea&s;ury, who had no title to interfere with either. The grand jury clo&s;e with referring to the <Q>unexampled pro&s;perity of our dear and happy country,</Q>&mdash;exemplified in the deva&s;tation of commerce; the explo&s;ion of cre|dit; the contempt of England; and the pro&s;pect of ho&s;tilities with France.</P>
<P>Of the we&s;tern army, more yet remains to be &s;aid. Andrew Wat&s;on, William H. Beaumont, Je|remiah Sturgeon, and George Robin&s;on, re&s;ided, in 1794, at Pitt&s;burg. Mr. Brackenridge declares, that the town did not contain four le&s;s &s;u&s;pected, or le&s;s offending men. They <Q>were dragged out of their beds, at two o'clock in the morning; not &s;uffered to dre&s;s them&s;elves, but in an unfini&s;hed manner; obliged to march, &s;ome of them, with|out putting on their &s;hoes, which they had to car|ry with them in their hands; dragged out of their beds amid&s;t the cries of children, and the tears of mothers; treated with language of the mo&s;t

<P>To this black narrative, let us &s;ee what can be compared on the &s;ide of democratic &s;ocieties.

in men who have already excited an ar|med rebellion again&s;t the laws of their country; and &s;pread havoc and de&s;olation over the peace|ful dwellings of our fellow citizens; who have already produced trea&s;on and <HI>murder.</HI></Q> And again&mdash;"the trea&s;ons and <HI>murders</HI> of Pitt&s;burg." The only blood &s;pilt was, as already &s;aid, by the ar|my; and as for havoc and de&s;olation, that committed by the in&s;urgents was but like a grain to the bu&s;hel of the exci&s;e heroes. Manlius, in a long note, conde&s;cends upon particulars. In May, 1794, the people of Lexington in Kentucky burnt in effigy John Jay. And what then? before the burning they guillotined him. The <HI>defence</HI> of Mr. Adams was &s;u&s;pended about his neck, and in his left hand he held <Q>Swift's la&s;t &s;peech in congre&s;s on the &s;ub|ject of Briti&s;h depredation.</Q> This childi&s;h &s;to|ry formed a triumphant article in &s;ome Kentucky new&s;paper.

<P>Hi&s;torical knowledge mu&s;t be at a very low ebb in Bo&s;ton; otherwi&s;e no writer dur&s;t have forged the notorious fiction ju&s;t quoted. If, in 1794, the people of Kentucky had been in arms, they might have remained &s;o. No federal army, or indeed any other, could have reached them. But, happi|ly, this is the fir&s;t and la&s;t notice which we have received of a rebellion in that quarter The lie was good or bad enough to plea&s;e the trade&s;men and farmers of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. In their irritation, Manlius reaps the harve&s;t of his labours. He prints a &s;warm of inflammatory fables, and proceeds to rail at inflammation.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="033485_0146_0FF720645C36D6E0">It does not appear that any democratic &s;ociety had concern in burning of Jay's effigy.

<P>On the 26th of November, 1794, Dr. Ames, in a &s;peech to the repre&s;entatives, attacked democra|tic &s;ocieties. He repeated the above circum&s;tances from Manlius. He added others. The &s;ocie|ty, at Charle&s;ton, in South Carolina, had &s;olici|ted the jacobin club of Paris to adopt it. This was in October, 1793.

<P>There was another fact omitted both by Dr. Ames and Manlius. The former and his friend, Dr. Smith, were burnt in effigy at Charle&s;ton, (S. C.) for oppo&s;ing Madi&s;on's re&s;olutions. Perhaps this, al&s;o, may be a&s;cribed to democratic &s;ocieties. But all the&s;e indecencies put together, do not balance even half a page of Findley or Brackenridge. It &s;ignifies nothing to burn one judge in effigy, compared with the dragging of another to the di&s;tance of three hundred and fifty miles from his di&s;trict, and, with|out examination, confining him for &s;eventy days in the cells of Philadelphia jail.

<P>Among the pri&s;oners, Mr. Findley enumerates colonel Crawford and &s;on, Mr. Sedgwick, a ju&s;tice of the peace, Mr. Corbly, a bapti&s;t mini&s;ter, and others. He never could learn that Mr. Sedgwick had done any thing to lay a foundation even for &s;u&s;picion. The&s;e people a&s;&s;ert, that they had not the opportunity of &s;igning the terms of the com|mi&s;&s;ioners, until the appointed day was pa&s;t. After an impri&s;onment of <HI>&s;everal months,</HI> they were ad|mitted to bail. On their trial, no bill was found again&s;t any of them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Findley, Chap.

<P>In the American Annual Regi&s;ter, Chap. X. &s;ome ob&s;ervations are made on the corre&s;pondent ca&s;e of George Lucas, another pretended in&s;urgent, &s;uch as Mr. Sedgwick and Co. Compare this with what follows. The pre&s;ident, in his &s;peech to congre&s;s, on the 19th of November, 1794, &s;trongly recommends
<PB N="150" REF="033485_0149_0FF7206B9A224EC0">
an indemnification to per&s;ons in office, who had &s;uffered in <HI>defence</HI> of government; &s;uch as Neville, the in&s;pector, who&s;e hou&s;e was burnt. <Q>The ob|ligation, &s;ays he, and policy of indemnifying them, are &s;trong and obvious. It may al&s;o merit attention, whether policy will not enlarge this provi&s;ion to the retribution of other citizens, who, though not under the ties of office, may have &s;uffered damage by their generous exertions for upholding the con&s;titution and the laws. The amount, even if all the injured were includ|ed, would not be great; and, on future emer|gencies, the government would be amply repaid by the influence of an example, that he who in|curs a lo&s;s in its defence, &s;hall find a recompence in its liberality.</Q></P>
<P>This reads very well. Send your &s;ervant on a me&s;&s;age, and order him to mount an unruly hor&s;e. He is, in &s;pite of his efforts, thrown off and brui&s;ed. You cannot chu&s;e but to pay the &s;urgeon's bill. Thus far we go with the pre&s;ident; for the go|vernment of a country proceeds on the &s;ame prin|ciples with that of a family, only that it covers a more extended &s;cale. Put the ca&s;e then, that your courier &s;hall, with or without de&s;ign, ride over a dozen pa&s;&s;engers on the road. The &s;urgeon brings in a &s;econd account. This al&s;o will fall to be paid either by him or you. Equity requires that ultimate compen&s;ation &s;hould be made by the owner of this hor&s;e, who put him into the way of doing the harm.</P>
<P>It demands no depth to &s;ee the fairne&s;s of this pro|po&s;ition, and the propriety of its application to ju&s;tice Sedgwick, to colonel Crawford, &s;erjeant Lucas, and Mr. Corbly. In con&s;equence of the pre&s;ident's re|commendation, a bill pa&s;t to indemnify tho&s;e who &s;uffered lo&s;&s;es in the &s;ervice of government by the in&s;urgents. The &s;ame bill &s;hould have contained
<PB N="151" REF="033485_0150_0FF7206E5878ADD0">
a clau&s;e for indemnifying tho&s;e who had been gro&s;sly abu&s;ed by the we&s;tern army, or who had endu|red unju&s;t impri&s;onment by the mi&s;take of govern|ment. Humanity, ju&s;tice, and &s;ound policy, pled as warmly in the latter in&s;tance as in the former. The ca&s;e was even &s;tronger than that of pa&s;&s;engers rode down by a hor&s;e. The federal ar|my, that in&s;trument which executed &s;uch a mi&s;appli|cation of puni&s;hment, was, in part, rai&s;ed at the ex|pence of its victims. It was only, by their own con|&s;ent, granted &s;even years before, that, as it regarded them, the pre&s;ident held his office; for if they had, in 1787, &s;et up an independent government, it would have been difficult or impo&s;&s;ible to hinder them; nor &s;hould it be forgotten that the con&s;titution was re|conciled to their choice by con&s;iderable manage|ment, &s;olicitation, and artifice. The officers of ex|ci&s;e, who lo&s;t property, or were abu&s;ed per&s;onally, had reaped per&s;onal emoluments from the execu|tive. Lucas and Sedgwick had not. They drew only blanks in this lottery; while they were ju&s;t as well entitled to protection, and retribution, as officers of exci&s;e, or any other cla&s;s of citizens. Nay &s;ome of them, &s;heriff Hamilton, and major Powers, for example, had been active in&s;truments in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the riots. Their claim to compen|&s;ation was of the mo&s;t forcible nature. They got none.</P>
<P>The policy of &s;uch a mea&s;ure is no le&s;s evident than its ju&s;tice. By paying only the &s;ufferers on one &s;ide, congre&s;s were placing them&s;elves at the head of a party, and what is yet wor&s;e, of that par|ty who were mo&s;t in the wrong; for, after the explanation already made, candour will admit, that the outrages perpetrated by the whi&s;kymen, vani&s;h in a compari&s;on with the barbarities and villainies committed by part of the army, and of its conduc|tors.

Now, the government of a party is, in it&s;elf, illegal, and but for the &s;ake of expediency, de|&s;erves no attachment. The people to the we&s;tward could not help &s;eeing, and reprobating &s;uch gro&s;s partiality again&s;t their magi&s;trates, and other fel|low citizens, and in favour of exci&s;e officers. Their re&s;entment may, at this time, be held of &s;mall con|&s;equence. But they are a growing &s;ociety. In the cen&s;us of 1791, the four counties were e&s;timated to contain about &s;eventy thou&s;and people. At pre|&s;ent, they can hardly have fewer than an hundred thou&s;and, and, as the country is in a rapid pro|gre&s;&s;ion, twelve years more will double their num|bers. In new &s;ettlements, the proportion of able bodied men to the general population is very great<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hi&s;tory of Vermont; a &s;tate wherein more than a fifth part of the people are enrolled in the militia.</NOTE>. The two hundred thou&s;and inhabitants of the year 1810, will probably be able to mu&s;ter forty thou&s;and armed citizens. The mountains that &s;eperate their territory from the Atlantic coun|try are equivalent to a &s;econd army. The ma&s;ters of Loui&s;iana and Canada will be ready to furni&s;h them with arms; an a&s;&s;i&s;tance equally to be ex|pected from Spain, France, and England. In ca&s;e of &s;erious provocation, and actual in&s;urrection, the memory of ancient injuries will make the people de&s;perate.

In|&s;tead of &s;triving to cru&s;h mi&s;chief, he may po&s;&s;ibly, at the head of his Mingo creek regiment, &s;eize a po&s;t on the Alleghany, and bid defiance to congre&s;s and exci&s;e. Major Powers will not likely become a &s;econd time, an emba&s;&s;ador of obedience, that he may be impri&s;oned, for eight days, at the point of the bayonet. A revolt like this, would far better

<P>The &s;eventh amendment enjoins, that no per&s;on &s;hall <Q>be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without <HI>due proce&s;s of law.</HI></Q> The &s;tipulation is illu&s;ive, by the generality of the &s;tile; for, the con|&s;titution

&s;hould either have defined what is meant by <HI>due proce&s;s,</HI> or it i&s;&s;ues in mere words.</P>
<P>The eighth amendment declares, that, <Q>in all criminal pro&s;ecutions, the accu&s;ed &s;hall enjoy the right to a &s;peedy and public trial, by an impartial jury, of the &s;tate and di&s;trict wherein the crime &s;hall have been committed.</Q></P>
<P>This amendment is, likewi&s;e, un&s;atisfactory; for a <HI>&s;peedy</HI> trial is an indefinite phra&s;e, that may be &s;tretched to intolerable delay. Thus, in the ca&s;es of the we&s;tern people, about &s;ix months, or up|wards, intervened between arre&s;tment and trial. This was any thing, &s;urely, but &s;peed. The word <HI>di&s;trict</HI> lies, al&s;o, open to objection. The &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania is a di&s;trict four hundred miles broad. A per&s;on dragged to that di&s;tance, a whi&s;key rioter, for example, is completely &s;eparated from his con|nections, and lo&s;es every benefit of trial by jury from the vicinage. The very length of the journey is, in it&s;elf, a &s;evere puni&s;hment to any man, who has bu&s;ine&s;s to mind. Suppo&s;e that he gets bail, re|turns home, comes back to Philadelphia, and is ac|quitted, or, perhaps the grand jury throws out the bill, &s;o that he does not even &s;tand a trial. His three journies amount to twelve hundred miles, which, at twenty miles per day, employ &s;ixty days. His expences, in travelling, cannot be le&s;s than a dollar per day, and his lo&s;s of time about as much more. Here is a fine of more than an hundred dollars, and, perhaps, he has not one dollar of his own. This calculation does not include his wa&s;te of time in at|tending tho court, and three prefatory months in pri&s;on, before he could find bail for his appearance, or, perhaps, before judge Peters found lei&s;ure to examine him. To the poore&s;t man brought from the we&s;tern country, the arre&s;tment mu&s;t, in it&s;elf, have been equal to an exaction of three or four hundred
<PB N="155" REF="033485_0154_0FF7207B95488838">
dollars. The above three amendments to the con|&s;titution point out no explicit principle to protect him. As for compen&s;ation, I &s;u&s;pect that no writer on law, has ever &s;o much as &s;ugge&s;ted a hint of it. The extreme iniquity of this omi&s;&s;ion has already been explained<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">American Annual Regi&s;ter, Chap. X.</NOTE>. Amid&s;t the numerous projects for political reformation, I have never met with an ef|fectual remedy propo&s;ed for <HI>arbritrary impri&s;onment, before trial, on the part of government.</HI></P>
<P>We have &s;een a few of the abu&s;es in this way, which occurred during the we&s;tern in&s;urrection. While they can be repeated with impunity, it is ra&s;h to &s;ay much about the rights and liberties of an American citizen. While your government can apprehend you, make you walk four hundred miles on foot, and thereafter lie three months in jail, be|fore examination, it is childi&s;h, it is even imperti|nent, to rai&s;e a racket about the &s;uperior public vir|tue of American citizens, or the &s;uperior purity of the federal con&s;titution. If the former had &s;hone with peculiar &s;plendour, it is likely, that a certain judge would, long &s;ince, have been impeached, fined, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. If the latter had been as excellent, as it is &s;aid to be, it would have held out a warning &s;ufficient to deter him. As for the &s;ecretary of the trea&s;ury, his non-impeachment by the hou&s;e of re|pre&s;entatives, was an eminent neglect of duty. It is true that two-fifths of them, or, perhaps, a majo|rity, would have oppo&s;ed any motion of that &s;ort. The &s;enate, al&s;o, were &s;ure to have acquitted the criminal. Yet difficulties, like the&s;e, ought not to hinder an hone&s;t member of congre&s;s from obeying the dictates of his con&s;cience. Some elder repre&s;en|tatives affect to &s;mile at the blunt but re&s;pectable &s;incerity of colonel Lyon, of Vermont. It would
<PB N="156" REF="033485_0155_0FF7207EED00F348">
be well for the country if every member dur&s;t &s;peak his &s;entiments with as much hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>To the amendments above cited, the follow|ing addition might be an improvement. <Q>Every man, apprehended for any crime, &s;hall be entitled to an examination as early as po&s;&s;ible; to bail, if the offence be bailable, and to a &s;peedy trial. But as it is impo&s;&s;ible, in &s;uch matters, to &s;ix a preci&s;e rule, the following provi&s;ions will en|&s;ure the circum&s;pection of government in i&s;&s;u|ing warrants to apprehend the accu&s;ed, and its di&s;patch in deciding their fate. From the day of his arre&s;t, till that of trial, he &s;hall receive whole&s;ome and plentiful diet, and be lodged in an apartment dry, and as well aired as may be<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the criminal apartment of the jail of Philadelphia, a pri&s;oner is re&s;tricted to the diet of the hou&s;e, that is, to &s;emi-&s;tarvation. He is not even allowed to buy food for him&s;elf, out of his own pocket. Thus, even <HI>before trial,</HI> he is &s;everely puni&s;hed by famine. Ameri|cans ought not to &s;peak of Algerine &s;avagene&s;s, while &s;uch enor|mities exi&s;t at home. After trial, there may be good cau&s;es for &s;tin|ting diet.</NOTE>. In the event of an acquittal he &s;hall be entitled to treble the ordinary wages of a labourer, in that part of the country where he re&s;ides; or, if he is a trade&s;man, to treble the wages that a journeyman of his profe&s;&s;ion can, upon a medi|dium, earn. The quantum is to be determined by a jury of his own vicinage, as early as po&s;&s;ible, after his di&s;charge. Over and above this &s;um, it &s;hall bear a weekly compound intere&s;t of one per cent. from the day of the pri&s;oner being ap|prehended, until the day that he &s;hall be ultimately paid the balance found due to him by the ver|dict of the jury. In ca&s;e of his death before trial, one half of the &s;ums &s;o due, on his being acquitted, &s;hall be awarded to his neare&s;t heir
<PB N="157" REF="033485_0156_0FF72081A38D5568">
at law; the amount being fixed as afore&s;aid, and the proportional compound intere&s;t conti|nuing to accumulate till the day of payment. If &s;trong &s;u&s;picions remain of the pri&s;oner's guilt, or, if the accidental death or ab&s;ence of a witne&s;s hath mutilated the evidence of the pub|lic pro&s;ecutor, the jury of the vicinage are to have a di&s;cretionary power of reducing the prin|cipal &s;um to one half, and the compound intere&s;t to one per cent. per week of the remaining moi|tey. If the pri&s;oner &s;hall be compelled to travel on foot for more than fifty miles to the place of confinement, or of trial, he &s;hall receive at the rate of one day's wages for every thirty miles &s;uch of di&s;tance. In court, he is to be allowed able coun&s;el, and any rea&s;onable number of wit|ne&s;&s;es, whom he may wi&s;h for, &s;hall be paid at public expence. His damages, on acquittal, are to be defrayed by the county, di&s;trict, or government, at who&s;e in&s;tance he has been tri|ed. If his health &s;uffers materially from bad diet, or an unwhole&s;ome apartment, addi|tional damages may be a&s;&s;igned at the di&s;cretion of the jury. For the time of <HI>his enlargement upon bail,</HI> the pri&s;oner, if finally acquitted, &s;hall only be entitled to the expence of travelling to and from the place where he re&s;ides.</Q></P>
<P>The reader may &s;mile at this effu&s;ion of fancy, but until a &s;imilar regulation &s;hall be adopted, the con&s;titution mu&s;t labour under an important defect. The point of ju&s;tice is not worth an argument, &s;ince every candid heart mu&s;t echo approbation. This practice of arbitrary impri&s;onment, both be|fore and after trial, has, in the old countries, been an in&s;trument of general and enormous tyranny. In Scotland, when a culprit had been condemned to tran&s;portation for a number of years, it was, &s;ome|times,
<PB N="158" REF="033485_0157_0FF7208331AD6458">
two or three years before government &s;ent him off. In equity, this interval &s;hould have been deducted from the &s;pace of bani&s;hment; but that was not the practice. The following anecdote refers to this cu&s;tom. It is publi&s;hed here by way of con&s;olation, as &s;hewing that public ju&s;tice can|not be more &s;tupid or brutal in America, than &s;he often is in Europe. Not many years ago, two brothers were capitally convicted at Edinburgh for hou&s;e breaking. One of them was to be re&s;pi|ted; but, by a blunder in drawing out the paper, the wrong chri&s;tian name crept in, and on this mi&s;|take he was hung. The &s;urvivor, whom it had &s;aved, underwent a long and painful impri&s;onment, till, &s;eeing no termination of mi&s;ery, he attempted an e&s;cape. He was detected, and the blood-thir&s;ty bench in&s;tantly obtained from the king an order for his execution. One of their lord&s;hips, le&s;s bar|barous than the re&s;t, ob&s;erved that the impri&s;on|ment which this man had endured was too dread|ful for human patience, and hinted that he was a much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ter object of pity than of a halter. The remark was in vain, for pity very &s;eldom touches the brea&s;t of a judge, or at lea&s;t of a Scots one.</P>
<P>From this excur&s;ion, we go back to the propo|&s;ed amendment. As government is erected for an univer&s;al di&s;pen&s;ation of ju&s;tice, it is completely mon&s;trous that government it&s;elf &s;hould be placed beyond the reach of ju&s;tice. With regard to ac|quitted pri&s;oners, nobody can deny the fact. When a man is apprehended either here, or in Europe, for a capital offence, he is often half &s;tarved to death, of cold and hunger, before his trial comes on. If, in the &s;equel, he mu&s;t die, that alone is enough; and if he is di&s;charged, the court can make no atonement equal to his previous &s;ufferings. Thus is Juri&s;prudence transformed into a pro&s;titute,
<PB N="159" REF="033485_0158_0FF72087BA7170E8">
a daemon, &s;uch as &s;he di&s;played her&s;elf on the we&s;|tern expedition.</P>
<P>To an acquitted pri&s;oner the retribution propo&s;ed cannot be thought extravagant. Even with the pre|vious a&s;&s;urance of &s;afety, if that were po&s;&s;ible, a labourer, or a journeyman mechanic, would much rather continue at the axe or the anvil, than undergo a &s;cene that, like a &s;nail on the wall, is &s;ure of leaving &s;lime behind it. The treble wages offer no temptation. To a per&s;on in exten&s;ive bu&s;ine&s;s, they offer much wor&s;e than none. They hold out the pro&s;pect of certain lo&s;s, which, however, he is bet|ter able to &s;upport than a poorer man. The com|pound intere&s;t would en&s;ure expedition, as tho&s;e in hazard of paying it, would effectually &s;pur the judge to an early di&s;charge of his duty. The tra|velling expences might tend to moderate the incon|venient di&s;tance to which a per&s;on accu&s;ed may &s;ometimes be dragged. The probability of retri|bution could hold out no encouragement to real guilt; be&s;ides, that the jury of the vicinage could cut compen&s;ation through the middle. The chance of paying &s;martly for mi&s;takes would render a court cautious in granting warrants. The &s;ame pro&s;pect would retard the acquittal of a pri|&s;oner, when he is known to be guilty. On the 3d of March, 1795, the day on which the third congre&s;s di&s;&s;olved, Mr. Dexter laid before the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives a re&s;olution for mitigating, in &s;ome in&s;tances, the &s;everity of penal laws. He &s;aid, that he had known a pri&s;oner come to the bar laughing, becau&s;e, though guilty, he knew before hand that the jury would acquit him. Condemning the &s;everity of the law, they refu&s;ed to condemn the pri&s;oner. Ju&s;tice, or cruelty over&s;hot its mark; and he was di&s;charged in contempt of evidence. But if the jury knew that &s;uch an act of perjury,
<PB N="160" REF="033485_0159_0FF7208ACE5C9ED8">
on their part, was to produce a heavy fine on the county or di&s;trict, we &s;hould hear no more of this corrupted mercy. It would reflect &s;ingular dignity on the juri&s;prudence of America, to &s;et the fir&s;t ex|ample to the world of &s;uch a magnanimous regula|tion. It might blunt the deri&s;ion that po&s;terity mu&s;t feel, at tho&s;e torrents of &s;elf-applau&s;e which the pre&s;ent age hath &s;o bountifully poured upon it&s;elf. Such an article in the con&s;titution would augment the &s;afety, and promote the indemnification of in|nocence, while, at the &s;ame time, it multiplied the dangers of guilt. Of &s;uch an article every party may, in turn, feel the benefit, or &s;uffer by the want. The unavenged exce&s;&s;es of the fall of 1794, prove, that, till &s;omething of this nature &s;hall be adopted, the vaunted liberties of America are but the frag|ments of a &s;y&s;tem. If the &s;ixth year of our govern|ment hath reached &s;uch Mamaluke maturity of de&s;|poti&s;m, what prodigies may be expected in the ac|cumulation of a century!</P>
<P>Here it may be u&s;eful to notice another defect in the federal con&s;titution. The king of England can, at plea&s;ure, di&s;&s;olve his parliament. Whenever they become unmanageable, he has a right of directing them to di&s;per&s;e. If they neglect his orders, there is nothing to hinder his guards from &s;hooting them, under the riot act. This royal privilege has ob|vious and dreadful con&s;equences to the indepen|dence of parliament. A member in oppo&s;ition, has, perhaps, expended one-half of his e&s;tate in canva&s;&s;ing for his borough. By a &s;ingle me&s;&s;age from the crown, the labour of years, and the wa&s;te of ten thou&s;and guineas are rendered abortive; and he mu&s;t, a &s;econd time, contend with the profu&s;ion of mini&s;terial bribery. Charles the fir&s;t con&s;ented to &s;u&s;pend this prerogative; and that over&s;ight paved the way to the foundation of the commonwealth
<PB N="161" REF="033485_0160_0FF7208D598FD6A8">
of England. It was by a bold exertion of the right of di&s;&s;olution, that William Pitt, in 1784, broke up the coalition parliament. The expedient has been often adopted. It is a &s;ure card in the hand of a de|ci&s;ive mini&s;ter, and one of the &s;tronge&s;t links in the chain of corrupted influence.</P>
<P>With &s;uch an example before them, the framers of the con&s;titution of 1787, have granted, in &s;ub|&s;tance, the very &s;ame prerogative to the pre&s;ident. They could not have betrayed a &s;tronger mark of incapacity. In article ii. &s;ection iii. are the&s;e words: <Q>He may, on extraordinary occa&s;ions, convene both hou&s;es, or either of them; and, in ca&s;e of di&s;agreement between them, with re&s;pect to the time of adjournment, he may adjourn them to &s;uch time as HE <HI>&s;hall think proper.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In article i. &s;ection ii. it is provided, that <Q>con|gre&s;s &s;hall a&s;&s;emble at lea&s;t once in every year.</Q> The pre&s;idential privilege reduces this rule to a nullity. Before they have been a week in &s;e&s;&s;ion, <HI>his</HI> &s;enate may propo&s;e an adjournment. The two hou&s;es di&s;agree, and the pre&s;ident determines that they &s;hall ri&s;e. With a view to this emergency, the appropriation bill may be po&s;ted through both hou&s;es within a few days after they &s;it down. If the repre&s;entatives become re&s;tive, he can di&s;mi&s;s them, without an appropriation act. He has only to quote the precedent of Mr. Wa&s;hington, and march to the bank or the trea&s;ury.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON April 28th, 1796, Dr. Ames deli|vered, in congre&s;s, a &s;peech in defence of the Bri|ti&s;h treaty&punc; <Q>If a treaty, &s;ays he, left king George his i&s;land, it would not an&s;wer; not if he &s;tipulated to pay rent for it. [This is wild exaggeration.] It has been &s;aid, [And pray, by whom has it been &s;aid? for no &s;uch language ever addre&s;&s;ed the ears of congre&s;s.] the world ought to rejoice if Britain was &s;unk in the &s;ea; if, where there are now men, and wealth, and laws, and liberty, there was no more than a &s;and-bank for the &s;ea mon&s;ters to fatten on; a &s;pace for the &s;torms of the ocean to mingle in conflict <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bache's Debates, Vol. II. p. 319.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="033485_0162_0FF720932AC1FBE0">Dr. Ames has not &s;pecified where, or by whom this object of rejoicing was propo&s;ed. If any demo|cratical member of congre&s;s had uttered that wi&s;h, Mr. Fenno would have refre&s;hed the public with an hundred editions of it. To a&s;cribe to a party opinions which they do not hold is uncandid, and &s;erves only to embitter political animo&s;ity. This citation helps to a&s;certain the credit due to &s;ome other a&s;&s;ertions in that &s;peech <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Something like this hath been quoted, by an eminent federal writer, as from <HI>The Political Progre&s;s of Britain,</HI> where no &s;uch &s;enti|ment is to be found,</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In a note &s;ubjoined to this &s;peech, Dr. Ames adds, that the pre&s;ent war <Q>has done more injury to the <HI>morals</HI> and <HI>happine&s;s</HI> of nations than all the wars of the la&s;t century.</Q> As to the quantity of blood &s;hed in the revolution, the party have already been told, and they dare not deny the fact, that, in Ben|gal only, the Engli&s;h have de&s;troyed about as many people as the late kingdom of France contained. Stale objections de&s;erve &s;tale an&s;wers. The guillo|tine is tender mercy compared with the rack and the wheel, both of which have been aboli&s;hed by the revolution. It has likewi&s;e put an end to the French &s;lave trade, which England continues to cul|tivate. Robe&s;pierre, and his chief accomplices, ex|piated their crimes on the &s;caffold; and even they were not wor&s;e than Turrene, ravaging the Pala|tinate, than Cromwell, extirpating the Iri&s;h nation, than the New-England &s;aints, of the la&s;t century, burning witches, or, than the Connecticut tories, with Brandt and Butler at their head, breaking up the &s;ettlement of Wioming. Smith's Wealth of Na|tions, and Arthur Young's Travels through France, will inform Dr. Ames, that, as to <HI>morals</HI> and <HI>hap|pine&s;s,</HI> a very large majority of the French nation could fear no change for the wor&s;e. They have freed
<PB N="164" REF="033485_0163_0FF72095B17B9E28">
them&s;elves from an oppre&s;&s;ive monarchy and nobi|lity; and from a clergy of enormous expence. The government, as in the United States, is repre&s;enta|tive, and religion left at liberty. The French were ju&s;t as well entitled to freedom as the Americans. Their revolution has been attended with much vi|olence and iniquity; but &s;o was ours. In the affair of September, 1797, the &s;imple exile of the vanqui&s;h|ed leaders, di&s;plays unexampled lenity. The French have not merely freed them&s;elves. They have like|wi&s;e delivered other nations from &s;lavery. The perfidious &s;tadtholder is expelled from his office. The bi&s;hop of Liege no longer uplifts a revenue from the gaming tables of Aix-la-Chapelle. Flanders, Nice, and Savoy, are admitted to &s;hare in the go|vernment of the republic. The Au&s;trian u&s;urpers are driven from Italy; and, in a few years, the whole penin&s;ula will enjoy a repre&s;entative govern|ment. The corporation of German tyrants hath been &s;haken to the root, and lopped of numerous branches. Every campaign has been pregnant with horrors, but not more &s;o than tho&s;e of former wars. The progre&s;s of republican principles hath been gradual, but irre&s;i&s;tible. Mankind begin to &s;ee that they are capable of legi&s;lating for them&s;elves, and to laugh at their previous veneration for emperors and kings.</P>
<P>This pro&s;pect ought to gladden the heart of a true republican; but the American revolution &s;eems to have gone too far for the feelings of many people in this country. No &s;ooner had the New-Englanders got rid of their Briti&s;h monarch, than a con&s;ider|able part of them began to look out for &s;omething very like another. It was chiefly through them that the new con&s;titution conferred &s;uch immen&s;e power and influence on the office of pre&s;ident. And, ever &s;ince, mo&s;t of the New-England members of con|gre&s;s

have been di&s;po&s;ed to &s;train his prerogatives. Ob&s;erve what follows.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution, article i. &s;ection ix. clau&s;e vii. &s;ays that <Q>no title of <HI>nobility</HI> &s;hall be granted by the United States.</Q> On April 24th, 1789, the repre&s;entatives received a me&s;&s;age from the &s;enate. It &s;tated, that they had appointed a committee to con&s;ider <Q>what <HI>&s;tile</HI> or <HI>titles</HI> it will be proper to annex to the office of pre&s;ident and vice-pre&s;i|dent, if any other than tho&s;e given in the con&s;ti|tution.</Q> The repre&s;entatives refu&s;ed their con|currence, and the affair was dropt. Nothing could in it&s;elf, be more de&s;picable, nothing could be more oppo&s;ite even to the letter of the con&s;titution, or betray a &s;tronger ta&s;te for monarchy than this pro|po&s;al. The con&s;titution prohibits titles of nobility. The &s;enate recommend <HI>titles,</HI> and certainly not of degradation. Of cour&s;e they mu&s;t have been adap|ted, like the &s;imilies of Mr. Bayes, to elevate and &s;urpri&s;e. Mo&s;t &s;erene, mo&s;t potent, mo&s;t illu&s;trious, or any luggage of that kind, would have excited ridicule in&s;tead of re&s;pect. But in &s;miling at the childi&s;hne&s;s of the &s;cheme, we &s;hould not overlook its ultimate tendency. The next propo&s;al was, pro|bably, to have been by what title &s;hall members addre&s;s each other; and the continent might &s;oon have re&s;ounded with babbling appellations.&mdash;<Q>This day his grace the mo&s;t &s;erene John Adams, vice-pre&s;ident, &amp;c. &s;et out for his &s;eat at Braintree.&mdash; La&s;t night arrived, in this city from Mount Vernon, his high mightine&s;s, the mo&s;t potent and illu&s;trious George Wa&s;hington, &amp;c.&mdash;To-morrow his excellency, the right honourable Alexander Hamilton, with his lady, and their &s;uite proceed to New-York, on a vi&s;it to his excellency the mo&s;t illu&s;trious colonel Duer.&mdash;Their &s;erene highne&s;&s;es, the mo&s;t pui&s;&s;ant the &s;enate of the

United States, have re&s;olved that in future it &s;hall not be lawful for any &s;enator to pick his teeth, to yawn, or emit the like &s;ymptoms of intellec|tual vacancy, till half an hour after prayers have been fini&s;hed.</Q> It was from the &s;ame &s;pirit, that Me&s;&s;rs. Dexter and Sedgwick wanted, on the 1&s;t of January, 1795, to engraft, on our government, a foreign nobility<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See American Annual Regi&s;ter, Chap. V.</NOTE>. In both in&s;tances, the innova|tion would have rai&s;ed infinite di&s;content, and it was to produce no good effect of any kind. It breathed the pure &s;pirit of <HI>di&s;organization;</HI> a fa|vourite term of reproach with the federal party.</P>
<P>On titles, Thomas Paine has written with great &s;ucce&s;s; and this is one rea&s;on why the friends of order hate him. Abu&s;e of this author is now as naturally expected in a federal new&s;paper as tea and chocolate in a grocer's &s;tore. To &s;uch things, com|pare two re&s;olutions of congre&s;s of the 26th of Au|gu&s;t, and 3d of October 1785. In con&s;equence of his <Q>early, un&s;olicited, and continued labours in ex|plaining and enforcing the principles of the late revolution, by ingenious and timely publications, upon the nature of liberty, and civil govern|ment,</Q> they direct the board of trea&s;ury to pay him three thou&s;and dollars. This atte&s;tation out|weighs the clamour of the &s;ix per cent. orators. They dread, they revile, and if able, they would per&s;ecute Thomas Paine, becau&s;e he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es ta|lents and courage &s;ufficient to rend a&s;under the mantle of &s;peculation, and to delineate the ricketty growth of our public debt.</P>
<P>In his &s;peech to congre&s;s, on May 16th, 1797, Mr. Adams complains heavily of France, as wan|ting to promote civil di&s;cord in America. The pa&s;|&s;age that has almo&s;t produced a French war, claims
<PB N="167" REF="033485_0166_0FF7209FB11932D8">
particular notice, and is in the&s;e words. France <Q>will not aba&s;e her&s;elf by calculating the con&s;e|quences of the conde&s;cen&s;ion of the American government in li&s;tening to the &s;ugge&s;tions of her former tyrants. Moreover, the French repub|lic hopes that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Columbus, Raleigh, and Penn, always proud of their liberty, will ne|ver forget that <HI>they owe it to France.</HI> They will weigh in their wi&s;dom the magnanimous be|nevolence of the French people with the crafty care&s;&s;es of certain per&s;ons who meditate bringing them back to their former &s;lavery.</Q> The&s;e were the words of Barras, pre&s;ident of the directory, on the 30th December, 1796, in his farewell reply to Mr. Monroe. The &s;tile betrays o&s;tentation that might have been &s;pared; and contempt which has been de&s;erved; but not a &s;pirit of animo&s;ity. It is certain that, humanly &s;peaking, America could not have compelled Cornwallis to &s;urrender, but for the interference of France; and even the va|nity of a &s;elfi&s;h benefactor &s;hould be endured with re&s;pect. It would have been wi&s;e in the pre&s;ident to take no notice whatever of this &s;atiri|cal flight. He opened the door to &s;uch harangues as had not before been heard in congre&s;s. Among other polite repartees, Mr. Thatcher ob&s;erved that Barras mu&s;t have been either <HI>mad</HI> or <HI>drunk.</HI> Thus, in half a minute, we turned the balance of ci|vility to the &s;ide of France.</P>
<P>But there is the be&s;t rea&s;on for affirming that the indignation of Mr. Adams was affected; that he wanted to find a pretence for quarrelling with the republic; and that, if expre&s;&s;ions far &s;tronger than tho&s;e of Barras had been employed by lord Gren|ville, not a murmur would have been heard about them. We &s;hall examine each of the&s;e two points.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the pre&s;ident de&s;ired, and &s;till de|&s;ires,

a French rupture, is evident from his patron|age of the Gazette of the United States. Its edi|tor, Mr. Fenno, is printer to the &s;enate, and as much at the nod of Mr. Adams, and of them, as their clerk or door keeper. He vindicates all the mea&s;ures of the federal party; and, &s;ince the beginning of the French revolution, he has railed at that people in the mo&s;t violent tone. The following paragraphs are copied from his new&s;paper, &s;o late as the 20th of September, 1797. Read them; and then a&s;k your&s;elf whether Mr. Adams and his &s;enate can be &s;incere in wi&s;hing for a reconcilement with France? While they countenance the publi&s;her of &s;uch invectives, they cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed either to expect or de&s;ire French amity. It is of the utmo&s;t importance to a&s;certain whether our executive is &s;erious in its efforts for pacification. Judge if the following language is of that &s;ort.</P>
<P><Q>By the advices this day publi&s;hed, it is ren|dered probable that the con&s;titution-makers of &s;ans-cullotte land, that great nur&s;ery of pirates, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and robbers, are, ere this, once more <HI>blown up.</HI></Q> [This is abundantly brutal, but the writer goes from bad to wor&s;e.]</P>
<P><Q>A new, long, and violent conte&s;t will &s;ucceed; but the i&s;&s;ue will be favourable to France, and mankind.</Q> THE KING <HI>&s;hall have</HI> HIS OWN <HI>again;</HI> [This is charming doctrine for a republic. Few people will hereafter be hardy enough to deny that there is a monarchical faction among us; and as the printer is the mere organ of his employers, it is but candid to rank Mr. Adams, and his fede|ral majority in the &s;enate, as the leaders of that faction.] <Q>and America and the world &s;hall have peace. Adieu, then, to Me&s;&s;idor, and Prairial, to Nivo&s;e, Pluvoi&s;e, and Vento&s;e, and Sans-Cul|lotides,

To the arms of the United States the republic is about as impregnable as the moon.

<P>But while the pre&s;idential gazette ejects &s;uch filth, we cannot, in rea&s;on, hope for a favourable conclu&s;ion from the triumvirate emba&s;&s;y. Indeed, if our envoys po&s;&s;e&s;s common &s;en&s;ibility, they mu&s;t look &s;omewhat fooli&s;h, if they are admitted into the pre&s;ence of Barras. Put the ca&s;e that he has on the table before him a volume of Mr. Fenno's new&s;paper, and that he &s;hall a&s;k them who are the patrons and prompters of that editor? Their an|&s;wer, if they &s;peak truth, mu&s;t be, that it is the funnel of government. He may then tell them that they are hypocritical ra&s;cals; that, with the olive branch in one hand, they hold a &s;tink-pot in the other; that, in the mid&s;t of &s;uch publications, their emba&s;&s;y is an additional in&s;ult; and that they may be thankful to get &s;afely out of the territo|ries of the republic.</P>
<P>The re&s;tive and &s;ullen demeanour of Charles Cote&s;worth Pinckney, at Paris, was both u&s;ele&s;s and
<PB N="170" REF="033485_0169_0FF720A851752D60">
impertinent. It de&s;erved no part of that prai&s;e conferred on it by Mr. Giles, and other members, in the late &s;e&s;&s;ion of congre&s;s. France, in the per|&s;on of her repre&s;entative, had endured a thou&s;and affronts from the pre&s;&s;es of Philadelphia. She had finally, and with intimation of her di&s;gu&s;t, re|called citizen Adct. She did not, however, enjoin Mr. Monroe to quit Paris, but a &s;ucce&s;&s;or having been appointed in his room, this removal pre&s;en|ted a decent opportunity for getting entirely quit of American amba&s;&s;adors. If Monroe had not been recalled, it is likely that he might &s;till have been permitted to remain at Paris. America would then have e&s;caped from eighty thou&s;and dollars of ex|pence, on account of the late extra &s;e&s;&s;ion of con|gre&s;s, be&s;ides about thirty or forty thou&s;and, as the extra charges of the pre&s;ent triple deputation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The exact amount of this expence cannot yet be &s;tated. Mr. Wolcott, in his report and e&s;timates for 1797, p. 16. reckons nine thou&s;and dollars, as the outfit of an amba&s;&s;ador to France. We have at pre&s;ent two &s;uch outfits, be&s;ides that of Pinckney. This comes in all to twenty-&s;even thou&s;and dollars, that might have been &s;aved by letting Monroe keep his place. As for &s;alary, Mr. Wolcott &s;tates four foreign mini&s;ters, at nine thou&s;and dollars each, and one at four thou&s;and five hundred. At the lowe&s;t rate, the ex|pence of three mini&s;ters to France will come to thirteen thou&s;and five hundred dollars, per annum, in&s;tead of paying only one &s;alary.</NOTE>. What was yet more important, &s;he would have e&s;caped from the &s;peech of the 16th of May, 1797; from all the improper harangues of which it was the fountain head; and from all the bad effects which are to be expected by the farther irritation of France.</P>
<P>As the republic had recalled her amba&s;&s;ador from the United States, &s;he could not be &s;uppo|&s;ed anxious for the re&s;idence of an American en|voy at Paris. My declaration, that I &s;hall no lon|ger enter your hou&s;e, amounts to a tacit prohibi|bition of your coming into mine. Be&s;ides, the
<PB N="171" REF="033485_0170_0FF720A9E35A75F8">
directory well knew why Monroe was recalled. His crime con&s;i&s;ted in a cordial attachment to the French revolution. They were, therefore, to look with a jealous eye on the per&s;on appointed to &s;ucceed him. This alone would have en&s;ured to Mr. Pinckney a cold reception; even if the recall of Adet had not afforded a plau&s;ible rea&s;on for refu&s;ing to receive him. He was wrong for not leaving France, on the fir&s;t injunction of de|parture. He improved his delay into a quar|rel with the French mini&s;ter. Hence it was highly injudicious in Mr. Adams to &s;end him back, as he has done, a &s;econd time. This, in it&s;elf, is a &s;pe|cies of di&s;re&s;pect to the French government. If peace with the republic was the point in view, the &s;ure&s;t way would have been to &s;end back Jef|fer&s;on or Monroe. The directory would recog|nize them, not merely as amba&s;&s;adors, but as friends. From &s;uch a deputation there would at lea&s;t be a chance for the return of mutual confidence. From the pre&s;ent choice of envoys there can be but little<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When Mr. Wa&s;hington wanted to gain the good will of England, he &s;ent over Jay, the profe&s;&s;ed advocate of the Briti&s;h intere&s;t in America.

<P>That it was improper to &s;end Mr. Pinckney back to France, appears from his own printed corre&s;pon|dence. It contains various expre&s;&s;ions highly di&s;re|&s;pectful to the directory. The remarks may be very ju&s;t, but the good policy of Mr. Adams, in expo&s;|ing them to the world, admits of doubt. Mr. Pinck|ney gave his letters of credence to the French mi|ni&s;ter, De la Croix, on December 9th, 1796. On the 11th, the latter informed Mr. Monroe, that no envoy could be received, till America had granted the redre&s;s of grievances demanded by France.
<PB N="172" REF="033485_0171_0FF720AB7901FE80">
De la Croix, by addre&s;&s;ing Monroe, gave a broad enough hint that he wanted to have no bu&s;ine&s;s with Pinckney. Yet, next morning, our envoy &s;ent him a long letter, enquiring, whether he &s;hould quit the republic. On the 15th, the French mini&s;ter &s;ignifi|ed his opinion, that this was the de&s;ire of the direc|tory; but that he would con&s;ult them again. Mr. Pinckney &s;tood on the ground of diplomatic privi|leges, though he adds, that the directory had recent|ly &s;ent off thirteen foreign mini&s;ters. On the 26th, he again &s;ent to enquire of De la Croix, whether he might re&s;ide in the republic. He received a &s;harp an&s;wer, which his &s;ecretary wanted the French mini&s;ter to put into writing. This was re|fu&s;ed, with &s;ome bad humour. De la Croix wonder|ed at Mr. Pinckney, for having &s;taid &s;o long, after he had been informed that it was impo&s;&s;ible to al|low him. Still he lingered in Paris, till the 5th of the en&s;uing February, having tea&s;ed the directory, till they gave him a written order to quit the French territories. His letter, conveying this la&s;t news, con|cludes with an ardent wi&s;h for a <HI>return</HI> of the good &s;en&s;e and good humour of the republic.</P>
<P>This bickering would not be worth an analy&s;is; but as the federal party make a prodigious clamour about it, the particulars ri&s;e above their natural de|gree of intere&s;t. In&s;tead of hara&s;&s;ing De la Croix, and the directory, and &s;tanding upon the tiptoe of diplomatic privilege, Pinckney would have &s;erved the United States better, by quitting France on the fir&s;t intimation, that he could not be received in an official character. The previous di&s;mi&s;&s;al of thirteen mini&s;ters, might have convinced him, that the di|rectory would remain inflexible, and that impor|tunity could only &s;erve to widen the breach. Ad|mitting that the French were in the wrong, and that is extremely doubtful, a wi&s;e envoy would

<P>Mr. Adams has completed this individual rup|ture.

<P><Q>I am happy to find that Mr. Adet's di&s;organiz|ing manoeuvres have been treated, by my country|men, as they de&s;erved, and that his attempts to divide, have tended to unite them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 62.</NOTE>.</Q> The plai&s;|ter of adulation is here laid on pretty thick. When Genet behaved with petulance to Mr. Wa&s;hington, he had, at lea&s;t, the merit of acting above board. Here is a man, who, under covert, &s;eems to do eve|ry thing in his power to &s;e&s;ter the animo&s;ity of our executive again&s;t France. It has been thought of importance to enter into this di&s;&s;ection of his of|ficial corre&s;pondence. It was from his rubbi&s;h of
<PB N="177" REF="033485_0176_0FF720BA00622118">
materials, that Mr. Adams fabricated his military harangue. When the papers were read in the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, the &s;pirited behaviour of Pinck|ney met with loud applau&s;e. The &s;peech of Barras was condemned by every member who took notice of it.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ident Adams would find it difficult to give a good rea&s;on for pre&s;enting this corre&s;pondence, in its full extent, to congre&s;s. He well knew that it would be printed, that copies of it would be &s;ent to France, that many parts of it were &s;ure to offend the direc|tory, and that, from the day of its arrival, they would regard Pinckney as a calumniator and a &s;py. If the pre&s;ident wanted the directory to refu&s;e, for a &s;econd time, the admi&s;&s;ion of his credentials, this was the mo&s;t likely way to &s;ucceed. Mr. Fenno him&s;elf would have been as commendable a choice as Mr. Pinckney.</P>
<P>In an early part of this chapter it was affirmed, that Mr. Adams <Q>de&s;ired, and &s;till de&s;ires a rup|ture with France.</Q> Evidence on this charge has now been examined, and the public will decide as to its ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Along with the above, another point was &s;tated, that, <Q>if expre&s;&s;ions far &s;tronger than tho&s;e of Bar|ras had been employed by lord Grenville, not a murmur would have been heard about them.</Q></P>
<P>In proof of this affirmation, there is a letter from Thomas Pinckney, dated London, January 9th, 1794. In a conver&s;ation with Pinckney, Grenville made a reference to <Q>evil di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons among us, who, according to the intelligence he had re|ceived, were endeavouring to irritate our peo|ple again&s;t Great Britain, as well as to oppo&s;e the mea&s;ures of our own government, and, in &s;hort, to reduce us to the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of France; a misfortune which they deprecated, as well for

our fakes, as for the common welfare and tran|quility of mankind.</Q></P>
<P>As for <HI>the common welfare of mankind,</HI> it was ju&s;t a month after this conver&s;ation that Dorche&s;ter, by de&s;ire of Grenville, delivered his war-talk to the Indians.</P>
<P>Genet was accu&s;ed of threatening to appeal from the pre&s;ident to the people. But here &s;omething in|finitely wor&s;e has been actually performed. Gren|ville at once appeals from the people to the pre&s;i|dent. He charges a great part of them with wi&s;hing to involve the continent in anarchy and blood&s;hed, and gives notice, in a &s;tile plain enough, that Eng|land would be glad to a&s;&s;i&s;t our executive in &s;upport of order. Compared to this in&s;olence, the glance of Barras fades beneath critici&s;m. If one drop of republican blood had warmed the heart of Thomas Pinckney, he never would have become the agent of this communication. The pre&s;ident did not like Genet's propo&s;ed appeal to the people, but he was highly &s;atisfied with this appeal to him&s;elf. From that day forward, he drew more clo&s;ely the bonds of union with England. The hint would have &s;uit|ed queen Elizabeth, or Philip the &s;econd; in ad|dre&s;&s;ing the earl of Murray, or a leader of the French league.</P>
<P>The re&s;idence of Phineas Bond in Philadelphia, as Briti&s;h con&s;ul, pre&s;ents an evidence of pitiful tamene&s;s. <Q>No &s;tate, &s;ays Hutche&s;on, is bound to admit any exiled criminal or fugitive &s;ubject of theirs, as an amba&s;&s;ador from any neighbour|ing &s;tate. But if &s;uch a one is &s;ent with &s;uch com|mi&s;&s;ion, he cannot ju&s;tly be &s;eized or puni&s;hed, but he may be immediately ordered to quit our country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hutche&s;on, Book III.

Guelph, that he accompanied the Briti&s;h army from this city. He did not return to America till &s;ome years after the revolution. No act of indemnity has been extended to him. His Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;ion alone &s;aves him from the penalties of an outlaw, which his &s;ub&s;equent in&s;olence has highly de&s;erved. If ge|neral Lee had &s;urvived the late war, and been &s;ent as a con&s;ul or amba&s;&s;ador to England, the court of London would have re&s;ented the nomination as an in&s;ult, and he might, perhaps without much impro|priety, have been committed to the tower. But the Briti&s;h government has a &s;en&s;e of dignity, which America is yet to learn. By the way, our tories clamour greatly at the &s;evere fate of French emi|grants, while their own conduct &s;hews how dange|rous indulgence might be. It is needle&s;s to act a re|volution by halves. When American pri&s;oners were &s;tarved to death at New-York, the republicans &s;hould have u&s;ed theirs exactly in the &s;ame manner.

<P>On February 21&s;t, 1797, a treaty of com|merce, between England and Ru&s;&s;ia, was &s;ign|ed at Peter&s;burgh. By the third article, Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ailors are amply &s;ecured from impre&s;&s;ment; as al&s;o the pa&s;&s;engers on board of their ve&s;&s;els, Briti&s;h &s;ubjects alone excepted. The tenth e&s;tabli&s;hes the maxim that <HI>free bottoms make free goods;</HI> a maxim by which an American ve&s;&s;el might convey a cargo of French coffee from St. Domingo to Bourdeaux. A rea&s;onable exception is made again&s;t &s;upplying a

nation, at war with either party, with arms or am|munition; and e&s;pecially places under &s;iege or block|ade. <Q>But in all other ca&s;es, &s;ays the treaty, &s;hall the &s;aid &s;ubjects freely carry into tho&s;e places, pa&s;&s;engers and all kinds of goods, except ammu|nition.</Q></P>
<P>The eleventh article &s;pecifies ammunition, as a term &s;trictly confined to military &s;tores. It adds, that, in ca&s;e of &s;eizure, <Q>neither the ve&s;&s;els, nor the pa&s;&s;engers, nor the other goods, &s;hall be de|tained, or hindered in the pro&s;ecution of their voyage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aurora, September 4th, 1797.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Compare this treaty with ours, in four different points, and then confe&s;s that Americans are unequally dealt with. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As for impre&s;&s;ment no &s;ecurity is granted. <HI>Second,</HI> The &s;eventeenth article gives up the privilege of neutral bottoms. <Q>If any property of an enemy &s;hall be found on board &s;uch ve&s;&s;el, that part only, which belongs to the enemy <HI>&s;hall be made prize.</HI></Q> <HI>Third,</HI> By the &s;econd para|graph of the eighteenth article, <Q>provi&s;ions and other articles, not generally contraband,</Q> may be &s;eiz|ed, the Briti&s;h government paying for them. A jar|gon &s;tipulation is introduced of their being only &s;eiz|able when <Q>becoming contraband according to <HI>the laws of nations.</HI></Q> The latter phra&s;e, like a poly|pus, or a &s;tocking, may, without injury to its tex|ture, have its in&s;ide turned out. But the above is the real and practical &s;ignification of the clau&s;e. Ru&s;&s;ian provi&s;ions are, in no ca&s;e whatever, &s;eizable. <HI>Fourth,</HI> The next paragraph of the eighteenth arti|cle is as inferior as all the re&s;t to the Ru&s;&s;ian treaty. An American ve&s;&s;el attempting to enter a place be|&s;ieged, is, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, to be turned away, and, on a &s;econd attempt to get entrance, her cargo,
<PB N="181" REF="033485_0180_0FF720C5414A23A0">
though not contraband, &s;hall be confi&s;cated. But a Ru&s;&s;ian &s;hip may enter at any time, and with <Q>all kinds of goods, <HI>except ammunition.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Thus, in four points, of the highe&s;t con&s;equence, the Ru&s;&s;ian treaty has the advantage of ours. A &s;tranger might wonder that any man in America is capable of defending Jay. Some of his advocates have been impelled by motives di&s;tinct from in|ternal approbation. Four hundred and thirteen merchants and traders, in Philadelphia, gave an addre&s;s of thanks to the pre&s;ident for pa&s;&s;ing of the treaty. Of this number, it is charitable to be|lieve, that one-half acted under the hope of plea&s;|ing, or the dread of offending Mr. Thomas Wil|ling, pre&s;ident of the bank of the United States, and who appears at the head of the li&s;t. With &s;everal, it was a &s;ufficient motive to &s;ee their names in &s;uch reputable company. Many dozens of the &s;ub&s;cribers have &s;ince become bankrupt. Morris and Nichol&s;on were &s;o at the time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At lea&s;t they were indebted to the extent of many millions of dollars; none of their creditors could get a cent; and their bills were &s;old at a reduced price.</NOTE>; and certainly were not <Q>more immediately concerned than any other cla&s;s of men<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The words of the addre&s;s.</NOTE>,</Q> &s;ince the real in|tere&s;t lay with tho&s;e to whom they were indebted. The following enquiry will prove &s;ome of the ob|ligations which this country has to Mr. Willing, and to a part of <HI>the gentlemen with whom he had the honour to act.</HI></P>
<P>A bank is e&s;tabli&s;hed by permi&s;&s;ion from the go|vernment of a country, for the univer&s;al conveni|ence of its citizens. Hence its directors have no title to make a di&s;tinction between per&s;ons or par|ties, any farther than re&s;pecting their <HI>&s;olvency.</HI> A bank is, or ought to be, de&s;igned for the good of
<PB N="182" REF="033485_0181_0FF720C6CE947BA0">
&s;ociety at large. Individuality of di&s;couragement, or of favour, is excluded from the &s;cheme. Such par|tiality would transform it into a nui&s;ance.</P>
<P>But equality of treatment &s;hould more e&s;pecially be the ca&s;e with the bank of the United States. One fifth part of its paper money capital belongs to the national government. For this rea&s;on, eve|ry citizen is, at &s;econd hand, a partner in it; as he pays a proportion of taxes to the public &s;tock, from whence that fifth &s;hare was derived. But it is notorious that this bank has been employed as an engine of government, to &s;erve the views of Briti&s;h intere&s;t. Di&s;counts have often been refu&s;ed at this national bank to men of mo&s;t undoubted opulence, merely on account of the republican principles of tho&s;e who drew or accepted of the bill. The de&s;poti&s;m of paper money pervades every mu&s;cle and vein of Philadelphian &s;ociety. <HI>The domination of Briti&s;h cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers has been exchanged for that of American &s;tockjobbers</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the act of incorporation, three-fifths of the funds are paya|ble in &s;ix per cent. public &s;tock. Compare &s;ections 2d and 11th.</NOTE>. As a minute example, &s;everal gentlemen of con&s;i|derable property, declared that they dur&s;t not &s;ub&s;cribe for the late Hi&s;tory of 1796; but that they would be &s;ure to buy it as &s;oon as prin|ted. They feared federal vengeance; of which a &s;toppage of di&s;counts at the bank is the foremo&s;t and favourite weapon. The effects of &s;uch a &s;top|page would infallibly ruin the mercantile character of any man in Mr. Willing's li&s;t.</P>
<P>It has been remarked<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">American Annual Regi&s;ter, Chap. V.</NOTE>, that Philadelphia has thirty offices exclu&s;ively for printing of books. This was a year ago; but, &s;ince that time, and owing to the late torrent of bankruptcies, &s;ome
<PB N="183" REF="033485_0182_0FF720C8620FAE48">
have been &s;hut up, and others have become half idle. If the paper money of this country had been confined within one-&s;ixth part of its pre&s;ent limits, the&s;e bankruptcies would have been re&s;tricted in at lea&s;t as great a proportion. In&s;tead of thirty printing offices, but indifferently employed, there might have been fifty well employed. In Edin|burgh or Gla&s;gow, a good journeyman printer will earn fifteen &s;hillings &s;terling or a guinea per week. In Dublin, his wages are, it is true, higher, but in Philadelphia, he makes upon a medium, eight or ten dollars. A difference in the expence of labour attends, al&s;o, the manufacture of paper. By much the greater part of this &s;uperior rate of wages may be traced not to the &s;carcity of hands, but to the exce&s;s of bank notes, and the con&s;equent ri&s;e of markets. The dearth of wages, to the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es of workmen, renders it difficult to pay them. Hence the employer mu&s;t &s;ometimes borrow mo|ney, at an high intere&s;t, in order to clear their accounts. The difference of wages, with a pre|mium for the advance of money, is laid by the paper-maker on his manufacture. A &s;econd upon his own work, is &s;uperadded by the printer, and a third by the book&s;eller. It is partly by this means, that books are dearer in Philadelphia or New-York than in England, though we have, comparatively, but very few taxes, and the pecu|liar advantage ari&s;ing from an unbounded extent of fertile territory. The &s;ure&s;t way to augment the circulation of a commodity is to be able to &s;ell it cheap. An American printer is often un|der&s;old, at his own door, by the Scots or Iri&s;h printer, who has labour at a price one-third lower. In London, wages are higher than probably any where el&s;e in Britain. A journeyman book-prin|ter, who exerts him&s;elf, can clear two guineas per
<PB N="184" REF="033485_0183_0FF720CDBB80A2B0">
week, but even there, by dint of large capitals, and the &s;uperiority of an old e&s;tabli&s;hment, the printer and book&s;eller can afford to deal for le&s;s profit, and to give longer credit than a printer in America, where the intere&s;t of money is &s;o much higher than in England.</P>
<P>It will be replied that, before the bank of the United States was opened, a journeyman prin|ter could be had for three, or four dollars, that trade was then very dull, and that Engli&s;h books were imported as fa&s;t as they are now. In rea&s;oning, it is common to a&s;cribe effects to im|aginary cau&s;es, merely becau&s;e the latter occurred at the &s;ame time with the former. Ye&s;terday, at noon, the clock &s;truck twelve, but the &s;un would have cro&s;&s;ed the zenith, whether the clock had &s;truck or not. It will be &s;uppo&s;ed that bank pa|per arrived only by degrees at its pre&s;ent oppre&s;|&s;ive magnitude; that at fir&s;t it promoted a prudent extent of foreign trade; and that trade in turn &s;timu|lated internal manufactures. It is not the u&s;e, but the abu&s;e of paper money, that is liable to objec|tion. Had the quantum of its circulation become &s;tationary, five or &s;ix years ago, it might have done well; but, in&s;tead of this, it has gone forward to &s;et open &s;uch &s;toodgates of gambling and of u&s;ury, as hardly ever overwhlemed any country before. If the expence of print and paper had remained &s;ta|tionary &s;ince 1792, the volume which now co&s;ts a dollar, could have been had for four or five &s;hil|lings. This mu&s;t have excluded in whole or nearly &s;o, the pre&s;ent large importation of paper, and it mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time, have greatly augmented the pre&s;ent manufacture of printing. The like increa&s;e would have en&s;ued in &s;ome other bran|ches, more readily than in this one. Both here and in Britain the wages of a printer are higher
<PB N="185" REF="033485_0184_0FF720CF4E671E58">
than tho&s;e of mo&s;t other trade&s;men, and nearer the &s;ame level in the two countries. This is, no doubt, one rea&s;on why book-printing has thriven more rapidly here than &s;o many other manufac|tures. On the contrary, look at weavers. In the old country their wages are &s;o low, and their work can be furni&s;hed &s;o cheap, that, in &s;everal branches, no e&s;tabli&s;hment in America can compete them.</P>
<P>Internal manufactures are a more important, be|cau&s;e a more &s;afe and durable acqui&s;ition than foreign commerce. They can involve no external quarrel, and they are beyond the reach of external piracy. The tanner, at Lanca&s;ter, has nothing to fear from the cor&s;airs of Barbary; and a potter, or cutler, on the Su&s;quehanna, may &s;mile at the menaces of the Briti&s;h navy. Twice the pre&s;ent number of American trade&s;men, though purcha&s;ed by lo&s;ing half the pre&s;ent number of American merchants, would produce a very de&s;irable alteration in the real &s;trength and re&s;ources of the United States.</P>
<P>The whole force of the banking &s;y&s;tem has been directed entirely towards the promotion of foreign trade. The encouragement which it afforded to dome&s;tic improvement was but as by proxy, through the medium of that wealth which commerce ten|ded to produce. But naturally &s;peaking, matters, if left more freely to their own operation, and le&s;s impeded by mountains of paper money, would have taken a &s;urer cour&s;e. A multitude of manu|facturing villages, planted over the continent, are preferable to an immen&s;e quantity of &s;hipping di&s;per&s;ed over the ocean. A carpenter, or a black|&s;mith, is more likely to be &s;ober, long-lived, and to leave a family behind him, than that part of our &s;eamen employed in di&s;tant voyages.

remarks, that &s;ailors look, for the mo&s;t part, older by ten years than land&s;men of the &s;ame age. Great numbers are annually lo&s;t at &s;ea or peri&s;h by the hard&s;hips peculiar to their profe&s;&s;ion. Per|haps not one-half of the aggregate body enjoy the comforts of a dry death. Of tho&s;e engaged in voyages to foreign countries, only a few are mar|ried. The &s;ailors of New-England have the re|putation of being orderly, and attached to their families; but this is not, in mo&s;t parts of the world, the general character of mariners. Of their extreme utility and value to the United States, notice has been formerly taken<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">American Annual Regi&s;ter, Chap. III.</NOTE>. But internal manufacturers are a &s;till more e&s;&s;ential cla&s;s in the &s;cale of national pro&s;perity. If you can find a taylor, or &s;hoemaker, at the next plantation, it is &s;urely more profitable to employ him than to &s;end your wheat three or four thou&s;and miles by &s;ea, to be exchanged for cloaths and &s;hoes. Be&s;ides the ri&s;k, and the wa&s;te of additional labour in the voyage, the trade&s;man whom you employ in France or England is not your fellow citizen. A mecha|nic, re&s;iding in America, forms a part of the nation. His earnings are expended among us. His family are blended with and augment the general ma&s;s of population; whereas a &s;ailor is often but &s;lightly connected with his native country, in which he is indeed a &s;tranger, while the foreign manufacturer, who is to con&s;ume your commodities, has no alli|ance whatever with it, but the tran&s;itory pro&s;pect of receiving employment. Mr. Gallatin<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 16.</NOTE> computes the number of American &s;eamen at near forty thou&s;and. Of the&s;e, it is much to &s;ay that &s;ix|teen thou&s;and are married, and rai&s;e families. Here then we have twenty-four thou&s;and batchelors, to

The&s;e hints are thrown out not to depreciate the real value of the banking &s;y&s;tem, and much le&s;s of fo|reign commerce; but merely to &s;hew what is now indeed, univer&s;ally granted, that the former has been driven to a ruinous exce&s;s, and that the latter ought not to be encouraged at the expence of do|me&s;tic manufactures, which, of the two &s;y&s;tems, greatly de&s;erve the preference.</P>
<P>A &s;hort review will di&s;cover what an enormous ma&s;s of paper has been i&s;&s;ued in this city.

<P>Thus, within the &s;pace of only &s;even years, from 1787, to 1793, inclu&s;ive, three batteries of

paper money, extending to FIFTEEN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, were opened, and &s;till continue to play again&s;t the antient fortre&s;s of gold and &s;ilver. The capitals of other banks on the continent amount to about five millions. Bring twice as many tur|kies to the market as you can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ell; and the price of money will in&s;tantly ri&s;e, or, accor|ding to common ideas, that of turkies will fall. In the &s;ame way, by thru&s;ting &s;o many thou&s;and reams of artificial money into the market, gold &s;oon became of much inferior value. Like Swift's pippin, the hone&s;t old milled dollar, that never de|ceived any body, that makes its vi&s;its always wel|come, and is the only &s;tedfa&s;t friend, found it&s;elf jo&s;tled out of the market by five or &s;ix up&s;tarts. By degrees, as the operations of the banks exten|ded, the nece&s;&s;aries of life grew dearer, till, in &s;ome in&s;tances, they arrived at an intolerable pitch. Three hundred dollars per annum were lately gi|ven for a hou&s;e in Water-&s;treet, Philadelphia, that would not turn rain, and that had not a &s;ingle tolerable room. Even on the &s;kirts of the city, an hundred dollars are often paid for an hovel of rotten boards, comprehending two or three apart|ments rather wider than a centry box, and which would not, in the vicinage of London, bring a rent of three guineas. It was well ob&s;erved, &s;ome|time ago, by an old citizen, that, if Philadelphia could get but another bank, we &s;hould &s;oon pay a dollar for a bunch of a&s;paragus. Some copies of this book will reach France and England; inten|ded emigrants are reque&s;ted to compare the&s;e de|tails with that cant of <HI>the peculiar facility with which a family can be rai&s;ed in America;</HI> and, in the name of all that is &s;acred, let them not envy the happine&s;s of re&s;iding in an American &s;ea-port.</P>
<P>If the capitals of the three banks had extended,
<PB N="189" REF="033485_0188_0FF720DA9936C5E0">
collectively, to three or four millions, they might have done &s;ervice; as fifty drops of laudanum will cure a cholic, when five hundred would kill the patient. But when congre&s;s, by a law, which they had not the &s;malle&s;t title to make, abruptly opened an enormous &s;luice of ten millions of dollars, they acted with the fore&s;ight of the &s;hepherd, who wi&s;h|ed for the Ganges to run through his fields. The bank of Penn&s;ylvania came next, with its three millions, like the &s;econd three hundred la&s;hes on the back of a Briti&s;h &s;oldier, who has &s;tolen a cou|ple of hens. No &s;carca&s;m is intended on the foun|ders of this in&s;titution. They did not fore&s;ee its con&s;equences to the public at large. It has been of much pecuniary advantage to the government of this &s;tate; and the a&s;&s;embly rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed, that, while &s;uch great &s;ums were made by banking, they had an equal right, with others, to the profit of an adventure. Their e&s;tabli&s;hment had another effect of &s;ome value. Its operations tended to weak|en the vortex of influence which ten millions of ca|pital gave to the bank of the United States. After this explanation, it may be &s;afely a&s;&s;erted, that the bank of Penn&s;ylvania was injurious to the country, not from any peculiarity in the e&s;tabli&s;hment it&s;elf, but becau&s;e the market was previou&s;ly over&s;tocked. In one re&s;pect it is greatly &s;uperior to the Hamilton bank. The government of Penn&s;ylvania derives a con&s;iderable revenue from its bank, and which is &s;aid to defray its whole expences. Congre&s;s gains only forty thou&s;and dollars, and even that is ac|quired by a &s;econd breach of the con&s;titution, as illegal as the act of incorporation it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Of the ten millions of paper capital held by the bank of the United States, two millions were ad|vanced by government, in virtue of a clau&s;e in the charter. But if it was irregular to found a bank, it
<PB N="190" REF="033485_0189_0FF720E1B5203070">
mu&s;t be &s;till more &s;o to &s;port in &s;hares of it with public money. In the annual reports from the trea&s;ury to congre&s;s, an hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and dollars are &s;tated as the &s;hare of government in the dividends. The two millions of dollars were bor|rowed, at &s;ix per cent. from the bank it&s;elf. Thus, after &s;triking off an hundred and twenty thou&s;and dollars of intere&s;t, the clear profit, as above &s;tated, is only forty thou&s;and. It is believed, that either of the banks of North America, or of Penn&s;ylvania, would give a large &s;um for the additional conve|nience and repute of handling public money. A di&s;|tinction of this nature is intere&s;ting to any banking company. The remittances of revenue from Scot|land to the exchequer at London, pa&s;s, of cour&s;e, through the hands of an Edinburgh banker. The agency is &s;aid to be worth ten thou&s;and pounds &s;ter|ling per annum, and it &s;ometimes produces a &s;harp competition. William Ram&s;ay, who is under&s;tood to have a fortune of at lea&s;t three or four hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, and who was thus far above conte&s;ting for a trifle, mi&s;&s;ed this employment, &s;ome years ago, in a hard &s;truggle with &s;ir William Forbes, the foreman of Thomas Mair's jury.</P>
<P>From the&s;e ob&s;ervations it re&s;ults, that, though banks have promoted the exten&s;ion of commerce, the too great amount of their notes in circulation, and the mon&s;trous u&s;ury for which paper opened an avenue, have, in the i&s;&s;ue, filled Philadelphia with in&s;olvencies.

<P>Since the deci&s;ion of the treaty bu&s;ine&s;s, I have been charged with de&s;erting the republican cau&s;e, and acting with duplicity. A &s;hort hi&s;tory or &s;tate of facts is &s;ubmitted to impartial friends.</P>
<P>I was oppo&s;ed to the treaty from its fir&s;t ap|pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ance, and was one of the committee who applied to the executive not to ratify it. When the que&s;tion for pa&s;&s;ing the laws nece&s;&s;ary to carry it into effect was agitated in the commit|tee of the whole, I continued to oppo&s;e to it. But finding the numerous petitions in favour of it; the unu&s;ual &s;en&s;ation, and party rancour, it had occa&s;ioned, particularly to the ea&s;tward, and con&s;idering that it had been ratified by two-thirds of the &s;enate and the pre&s;ident, I did not think it was prudent to carry the oppo&s;ition farther, unle&s;s it appeared probable that there would be a re&s;pectable majority in the hou&s;e to counterba|lance the weight of its friends and &s;upporters. I felt a decided belief that otherwi&s;e oppo&s;ition would tend more to injure than benefit the republican cau&s;e. I avowed this opinion, at &s;everal private meetings of members of the hou&s;e, at one of which I was pointedly a&s;ked what I deemed a re&s;pec|table majority, and whether I deemed fifteen, &s;uch as had appeared on the que&s;tion for obtaining the papers, a re&s;pectable one? I replied that I did, and that I thought eight re&s;pectable, but in this in|&s;tance would even be content with five. I ex|pre&s;&s;ed my doubts whether that number would
<PB N="193" REF="033485_0192_0FF720E6EE6F7768">
eventually appear, although the gentlemen pre|&s;ent were of a different opinion. From the know|ledge which I had of the &s;entiments of the members, which I expre&s;&s;ed to &s;everal of my friends on the morning of the day on which the deci&s;ion took place, it terminated much in the manner that I expected. To many members of the then con|gre&s;s I can appeal for the truth of the above; and I challenge any one of my acquaintances, either in or out of congre&s;s, to prove that I ever pledged my&s;elf, at all events, to vote again&s;t appropriations. I had an opinion of my own, and was determined to vote as exi&s;ting circum|&s;tances &s;hould direct to be mo&s;t prudent, and for the real benefit of my country. As to a &s;eem|ing incon&s;i&s;tency in my conduct, when the que&s;|tion was before the hou&s;e, I equally deny that. I was for the preamble, which declares the treaty objectionable. By calling the yeas and nays, I knew that this opinion, whether it prevailed or not, would be brought on the journals, where my name appears in the affirmative. This being effected, I cared le&s;s about the final deci&s;ion, though the imperious circum&s;tances which pre&s;ented them&s;elves led me to con&s;ent to the mea&s;ure, lea|ving the re&s;pon&s;ibility with tho&s;e who had for|med and ratified the treaty, and had been &s;o indefatigable in rai&s;ing the &s;torm, and bringing the hou&s;e, and this country, into &s;o di&s;graceful a dilemma. If I have erred, I have experienced the human lot. If I have injured my country, which I cannot yet &s;ee, it was not done de&s;ign|edly. Suffice it to &s;ay, I acted according to the be&s;t of my judgement, without intere&s;ted views, and with a full knowledge that it would injure me with tho&s;e who deem them&s;elves exclu&s;ive patriots and republicans. But as neither that

Whatever improper motives may be a&s;cribed to me, a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having ac|ted uprightly will con&s;ole me, whil&s;t I am &s;ati&s;|fied that I have the genuine republican intere&s;t of this country as much at heart, as any one, though I may rai&s;e le&s;s clamour about it.

<P>In the &s;ea-port towns of this country provi&s;ions were, for &s;ome years pa&s;t, at a higher price than, in common &s;ea&s;ons, they co&s;t in any part of Europe.

Nor is this year &s;elected for any peculiar magnitude of exports. In 1790, there were &s;hipped &s;even hundred and twenty-four thou&s;and barrels of flour; in 1791, &s;ix hundred and nineteen thou&s;and; in 1792, eight hundred and twenty-four thou&s;and; in 1793, one million and &s;eventy-four thou&s;and; and, in 1794, eight hundred and twenty-eight thou&s;and. During 1796, an hundred and ninety-&s;even thou&s;and bar|rels of flour were &s;hipped at the port of Philadel|phia only. In the mar&s;h-market of Baltimore, five hundred turkies have been &s;ometimes &s;old in a &s;in|gle day.

It is amazing to think of the patience with which poor people do, in this country, endure &s;uch treatment; and of the profound &s;ilence, regarding their wrongs, that is ob&s;erved by our admirable new&s;papers.

care who &s;hall be pre&s;ident, or what becomes of the legi&s;lature of the &s;tate wherein he lives, or of the repre&s;entatives of the union? The man to whom government does not extend &s;uitable protection, has no obligation to feel towards it either gratitude, attachment, or re&s;pect. The wages of labour did not ri&s;e in any thing like an equal proportion to the price of provi&s;ions, and the general expence of liv|ing. Thus the poor were placed, like Tantalus, ju&s;t within reach of plenty, which they were forbid|den to ta&s;te. The be&s;t economi&s;t in Philadelphia would be puzzled to &s;upport a family of &s;ix per|&s;ons, though he had ten dollars per week, when flour was at fifteen, or even twelve dollars, per bar|rel. But it is certain that great numbers of trade&s;|men and labourers protracted the exi&s;tence of them|&s;elves and their families, upon a weekly income of &s;ix or eight dollars, while flour &s;tood at fifteen dol|lars, and while &s;ome of Mr. Thomas Willing's com|purgators <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the la&s;t chapter.</NOTE> were borrowing and lending wind-bills and paper dollars to each other, at five per cent. a month, to facilitate the exportation of &s;even hun|dred thou&s;and barrels of flour. Both &s;ides of this picture explain why the pri&s;on of Philadelphia has long been as populous as a bee-hive, and why, in the yellow fever of Augu&s;t, 1797, numbers of citi|zens were compelled to remain and peri&s;h, becau&s;e they could dot mu&s;ter the expences requi&s;ite for a removal. The poor form the pede&s;tal on which &s;o|ciety does ultimately re&s;t; and this is the degree of attention which they and their hard&s;hips meet with, from the government and police of this wi&s;e&s;t of nations.</P>

and thou&s;ands were &s;ure to have died of hunger, though admini&s;tration would undoubtedly have done every thing po&s;&s;ible to prevent it. A London new&s;|paper of December, 1795, &s;ays, that two millions &s;terling had, in that year, been paid for bounties on the importation of corn. This bounty proved a trap-door to American merchants. Flour was bought here at fourteen dollars per barrel, and &s;old in Li|verpool for eight dollars. The bounty might, per|haps, cover the expence of freight. Members of parliament, and others, entered into re&s;olutions for eating coar&s;e bread, and the homeline&s;s of that &s;erved up at the royal table was de&s;cribed, in a mini&s;terial print, with minutene&s;s and ex|ultation. But in America, mi&s;ery, like that then felt in England, can hardly take place; becau&s;e the cheapne&s;s of land outweighs many legi&s;la|tive imperfections. Nine-tenths of people are farmers, and of con&s;equence take care, in the fir&s;t place, to feed them&s;elves. Of the re&s;t, a large majority po&s;&s;e&s;s property of &s;ome kind, and do not live, as the phra&s;e is, from hand to mouth. Hence the po&s;&s;itive &s;ufferers formed a much le&s;&s;er propor|tion to the community than they would have done in France, or England. Now, it always happens that a poor man, re&s;iding in the mid&s;t of ten others richer than him&s;elf, contrives to jo&s;tle on with more ea&s;e than if all his neighbours were, like him, nece&s;&s;itous. This is one main rea&s;on why the more dependent cla&s;s in the &s;ea-ports did not en|dure that awful extremity of di&s;tre&s;s which, in 1795; almo&s;t overwhelmed Britain. Be&s;ides, if a poor man has a numerous family, he can find &s;ome per&s;on who will take healthy children on an indenture, as &s;ervants or apprentices<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the ca&s;e in Penn&s;ylvania, but New-England differs from it. A per&s;on there will, it is &s;aid, be glad to &s;upport his &s;on during an apprentice&s;hip, for the &s;ake of his learning the trade.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="033485_0199_0FF721210EB01DD8">But, for the&s;e alleviating circum&s;tances, no thanks are due to the rulers of America; and though people did not ab&s;olutely die of hunger, yet there exi&s;ted between that and competency many modes of &s;ub&s;tantial hard fortune. It was culpable in our legi&s;lators to &s;tand tamely by, while part of its citizens laboured under &s;uch peculiar penury.</P>
<P>Yet it is more ea&s;y to point out misfortunes than to provide an effectual remedy. In Europe, five different methods have been practi&s;ed to prevent or to remove the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of famine. One of the&s;e is to pro&s;&s;er a bounty on the in&s;tant importation of foreign grain. The &s;econd gives premiums for the improvement of agriculture. As for Ameri|can &s;carcity, both of the&s;e plans are out of the que&s;tion. Provi&s;ions always abound, but the poor cannot &s;ometimes get at them. A third expedient is to prohibit by law the exporting of victuals, when they have ri&s;en in the market beyond a cer|tain price. The maritime parts of Britain are, with this view, divided into di&s;tricts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See particulars in <HI>The Political Progre&s;s of Britain,</HI> Part 1&s;t, 3d edition, Chap. 4th.</NOTE>, and the &s;he|riff of each county, has under &s;ome re&s;trictions, a di&s;cretionary power of opening or &s;hutting the ports. But the Briti&s;h corn laws do not invite imitation. They propagate &s;o much confu|&s;ion and mi&s;chief as to di&s;courage regulations of that nature. A fourth &s;ource of relief has been by the di&s;tribution of money, or provi&s;ions, at the public expence. In the ca&s;e of the fire at Sa|vannah, the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives determined that the con&s;titution did not allow them to be&s;tow charity. The a&s;&s;embly of Pen&s;ylvania, however, gave, on the &s;ame occa&s;ion, fifteen thou&s;and dol|lars. But this practice of donations, be&s;ides being
<PB N="201" REF="033485_0200_0FF720FD8B604310">
altogether a direct and heavy expence, becomes very liable to abu&s;e.</P>
<P>A fifth &s;cheme, practi&s;ed in Geneva, and Swit|zerland, is to have large granaries con&s;tantly &s;tock|ed with flour. By a peculiar proce&s;s of beating it into a hard &s;ub&s;tance, flour is pre&s;erved, with|out injury, for &s;everal years, as lord Garden&s;tone was a&s;&s;ured on the &s;pot, by people concerned in the bu&s;ine&s;s. Now, although congre&s;s cannot give money, they can lend it. Fifty thou&s;and dollars were, in 1795, appropriated for trading with the Indi|ans, and, in 1796, an hundred and fifty thou&s;and dol|lars<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Folwell's edition of Acts of Congre&s;s, vol. iii. p. 232 and 259.</NOTE>. Congre&s;s have al&s;o wandered to the depth of two millions of dollars in banking. It would &s;eem as agreeable both to &s;ound policy, and to the con&s;titution, to e&s;tabli&s;h granaries in a few of the principal towns on the &s;ea-coa&s;t that are mo&s;t lia|ble to a ri&s;e of markets. Individual pride, and &s;ome rules of re&s;triction, would hinder the rich, or tho&s;e in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, from battening upon this in&s;titution. Let a number of poor families be enrolled, and &s;upplied from this &s;ource with flour, at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year, for &s;ix dollars per barrel. This would place the lower cla&s;&s;es more at their ea&s;e, and tend greatly to cheapne&s;s of labour, increa&s;e of emigration, and the facility of e&s;tabli&s;hing manufactures.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the good policy of &s;uch a plan, of which the above hints are a faint outline, ju&s;tice requires retribution to the inhabitants of &s;ea-ports, who bear, beyond all proportion, the greate&s;t weight of public taxes. In 1796, the duties on merchan|dize and tonnage amounted to twelve times more than the whole produce of internal taxes. But it is evident that the inhabitants of the &s;ea-port
<PB N="202" REF="033485_0201_0FF7210019FF9FD8">
towns con&s;ume a greater quantity of the imports than an equal number of people in the country, e&s;pecially at a di&s;tance from the &s;ea-coa&s;t. For in&s;tance, take the article of clothing. In towns, a weaver is generally a rare phaenomenon. It is believed that Philadelphia does not contain even a &s;ingle weaver. But in the country, and e&s;peci|ally remote from the &s;ea, the people make their own cloth. In the debates on Mr. Madi&s;on's re|&s;olutions, general Scott, of Wa&s;hington county, in this &s;tate, ob&s;erved, that the union contained about four millions and five hundred thou&s;and peo|ple, and that their bedding and cloathing could not come to le&s;s than ten dollars annually per head, being, in the whole, forty-five millions of dol|lars. <Q>Where &s;aid he, do all the&s;e manufactures come from? Suppo&s;e that Briti&s;h imports were two millions &s;terling, and one half of them in clothing. The amount is only about four mil|lions and five hundred thou&s;and dollars, or one-tenth part of the annual con&s;umption.</Q> None of the&s;e calculations can be rigidly exact<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The duty on articles of wearing does not, probably, exceed one-fourth part of the whole impo&s;t. Con&s;ult Mr. Gallatin p. 18.</NOTE>. Yet they clearly &s;hew that one great branch of impo&s;t falls by far the mo&s;t heavily on people in the &s;ea|ports, who, at lea&s;t to the &s;outh of New-England, wear, in general, Briti&s;h or Iri&s;h manufactures, while inland inhabitants are &s;pinning and weaving for them&s;elves. Other articles, &s;uch as wine, tea, &s;ugar, and coffee, are u&s;ed much more commonly in towns than in the country. It has always been a favourite maxim in congre&s;s to throw the &s;tre&s;s of taxation upon impo&s;t, and recently on exci&s;e. Hence, it is likely, that the fifty or &s;ixty thou&s;and inhabitants of Philadelphia pay thrice as much

money to government as the four we&s;tern coun|ties of Penn&s;ylvania, the &s;tates of Vermont, Tenne&s;&s;ee, and Kentucky collectively.

<P>The landed intere&s;t enjoys, indeed, entire a&s;|cendany, in the federal government. The con|&s;titution, article i. &s;ection ix. &s;ays, that <Q>no tax or duty &s;hall be laid on articles <HI>exported</HI> from any &s;tate.</Q> Section x. apparently rever&s;es this article by declaring, that <Q>no &s;tate &s;hall, <HI>without the con&s;ent of congre&s;s,</HI> lay any impo&s;ts or duties on imports, or <HI>exports,</HI> except what may be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for executing its in&s;pection laws.</Q> By the fir&s;t clau&s;e, defining the power of congre&s;s, they are di&s;abled from lay|ing any duty on <HI>exports.</HI> By the &s;econd, they can expre&s;sly grant a power to individual &s;tates of lay|ing duties on exports, beyond what is needful for the purpo&s;e of in&s;pection. They are authori|zed to give a right, which they dare not exerci&s;e in their own capacity. But pa&s;&s;ing over this &s;eem|ing incon&s;i&s;tency, the received doctrine is that no duty can be levied on exports. By this ex|emption, the farmers gain an immen&s;e, and appa|rently an unfair advantage. A barrel of flour, or a hog&s;head of tobacco, when exported, brings as
<PB N="204" REF="033485_0203_0FF72106CEE8DD30">
clear profit to its owner as a loaf of refined &s;u|gar; nor is it obvious that there &s;hould be a di&s;tinc|tion in the right of taxing them. When &s;even or eight hundred thou&s;and barrels of flour are expor|ted in a &s;ingle year, at the exorbitant price of twelve or fifteen dollars, one &s;hould imagine that the farmer might well afford to pay a duty of one dollar per barrel. This cla&s;s reap undi&s;turbed the profit of an immen&s;e exportation, while they ca&s;t the burden of public expence almo&s;t entirely on the manufac|turers, and con&s;umers of exports. A land tax has been oppo&s;ed as impracticable to be levied. A du|ty on exports might be collected without the addi|tion of many revenue officers, and perhaps without the &s;malle&s;t increa&s;e of their pre&s;ent number.</P>
<P>From the prodigious advance in the amount of exports, a que&s;tion has been &s;tarted as to the &s;carcity of money, for the two la&s;t years. Mr. Harper, in his fir&s;t letter to his con&s;tituents, &s;ays, p. 21, that <Q>it would be very much for our intere&s;t for Bri|tain to remain at war with all Europe, becau&s;e &s;he and her enemies are obliged to purcha&s;e our provi&s;ions at <HI>an enormous price,</HI> and our neutra|lity gives us immen&s;e advantages in <HI>the carrying trade.</HI></Q> If foreign nations could be prevented from &s;ea-robbery, the United States might certainly derive benefit, though it would be purcha&s;ed on &s;hocking conditions. There is a greater advantage to be hoped from it. The contending powers, by the weakening of each other, may, for &s;ome years, be di&s;abled from tyrannizing &s;o much as they would, perhaps, be otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed to do, over the de|fencele&s;s navigation of America. The captures which they have made afford one great rea&s;on for the decline of credit. This lo&s;s falls chiefly on the mercantile intere&s;t, and the &s;carcity of ca&s;h is mo&s;t felt in that quarter. With augmented profits, the
<PB N="205" REF="033485_0204_0FF7210952E33480">
farmers have, undoubtedly, much augmented their expence of hou&s;e-keeping. Their demands for ma|nufactures increa&s;ed con&s;iderably, at lea&s;t in &s;ome parts of the union, during 1796. But be&s;ides, the country holds out an immen&s;e field for improve|ment, and it is improving rapidly in &s;pite of the alledged &s;carcity of ca&s;h. A man dealing to the va|lue of ten thou&s;and dollars, makes often larger gains, than from turning over only two thou&s;and; but as his projects frequently augment much fa&s;ter than his capital, he very often finds him&s;elf more &s;traitened than when his expected profits were much &s;maller. The &s;pirit of exce&s;&s;ive land-jobbing on one &s;ide may turn out as di&s;tre&s;&s;ing as that of over-trading on the other. Each di&s;temper will, in due time, partly cure it&s;elf. If matters could be reduced to a proper level, it will be found that there has been rather a di&s;tortion, and partial mi&s;|application, than a diminution of general wealth, which, when matters can be duly tempered and ba|lanced, has undoubtedly, within the la&s;t three years, received &s;ome increa&s;e. In every part of the coun|try, the area of cultivated land is hourly augment|ing. Every new&s;paper announces the formation of additional &s;ettlements, the planning of roads and bridges, and &s;ometimes of canals, and though our numbers are daily augmenting, yet every man con|nected with agriculture, finds employment and com|pen&s;ation. Within the la&s;t twelve months, land has, indeed, fallen much in its value, and e&s;pecially in the back countries; but that is becau&s;e it had been racked beyond its real worth by the dreams of &s;pe|culation. That fever is now &s;ub&s;iding, and the pul&s;e of prices, by returning to its former and more &s;teady height, promi&s;es, not a decline of vigour, but the re&s;toration of political health. One of our in&s;olvent land-jobbers, who&s;e bills are adverti&s;ed for auction,
<PB N="206" REF="033485_0205_0FF7210AE7099378">
and knocked down at a &s;hilling or &s;ix-pence per pound, will, perhaps, tell a creditor, that he is one of the riche&s;t men in the country; but that the bankruptcies in Europe cau&s;ed the return of his bills under prote&s;t, and he cannot &s;ubmit to &s;ell his lands, at this juncture, when they would not bring one-half of their real value. He, therefore, locks him&s;elf up, and till the return of better days, bids defiance to ju&s;tice. In this explanation, however, that he gives, there occurs no actual de&s;truction of real property, but of that which was imaginary. He obtained immen&s;e &s;ums in paper money, which he never could have procured in gold and &s;ilver. He became entangled with the brokers, at thirty or &s;ixty per cent. and, in his explo&s;ion, ruined an immen&s;e number of creditors. Still, however, the land re|mains. The gra&s;s will grow; the corn will ripen; and the &s;oil will, in due time, bring its natural price, ju&s;t as if he and his projects never had exi&s;ted. The ruin of &s;o many individuals is a con&s;iderable mi&s;|fortune; but &s;till it is one of that kind from which the country at large, though not the immediate &s;uf|ferers, will &s;oon recover. The bank of Ayr, in North Britain, which broke near thirty years ago, is a ca&s;e in point. After a &s;hort, but rapid progre&s;s, it &s;topt payment, having granted credit almo&s;t indi&s;crimi|nately, to every adventurer. To have &s;een the li&s;ts of bankruptcies, and the notices of the &s;ale of lands, one might have &s;uppo&s;ed that the nation was irre|deemably ruined. Be&s;ides every other &s;ort of mi&s;|chief, land was, within a few years, &s;old, to pay the company's debts, to the value of &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. But amid&s;t all this alarm, it was not an extinction but only a transference of property. Agriculture continued to extend its pro|gre&s;s, with more than u&s;ual rapidity; and notwith|&s;tanding the wreck of &s;o much private credit, the
<PB N="207" REF="033485_0206_0FF7210C772F5D78">
effects were not vi&s;ible in the general ma&s;s of pro|perty. This fact, however unaccountable, was ge|nerally remarked at the time; and as the natural re&s;ources of America are infinitely greater than tho&s;e of North-Britain, &s;he will overcome this embarra&s;&s;|ment with &s;till greater facility.</P>
<P>To ha&s;ten this amendment, a check &s;hould be given to the enormous extent of paper currency. No expedient appears le&s;s di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to individuals, or more &s;imple and expeditions in its operation than to aboli&s;h all notes under fifty dollars. An inter|val of time would, no doubt, be granted to prevent too &s;udden a jerk in the &s;tate of circulation. Some effectual &s;teps ought likewi&s;e to be taken for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of u&s;ury. Till that bramble &s;hall be grubbed from the roots, all other regulations will be found incomplete, for the recovery of mercan|tile &s;oundne&s;s. This truth is &s;o trite as to be re|peated in this place with reluctance. But the prac|tice of exacting enormous intere&s;t, has become &s;o frequent, and its profe&s;&s;ors are now &s;o numerous, that to give, or to receive thirty per cent. is not con|&s;idered as di&s;graceful.</P>
<P>It cannot be too often repeated that till the ex|orbitant quantity of paper money &s;hall be reduced, and till the practice of u&s;ury &s;hall al&s;o be checked, all hopes of being able to manufacture entirely for our&s;elves mu&s;t end with di&s;appointment. The importance of that object has been &s;tated in an adverti&s;ement of a late edition of Shake&s;peare, and the following extract merits pre&s;ervation. <Q>The independence of the United States cannot be &s;ecure, till we &s;hall be much farther removed than at pre&s;ent, from the nece&s;&s;ity of importing the manufactures of Europe. It is ridiculous and humiliating, that we &s;hould &s;o frequently &s;end four thou&s;and miles for a pair of blankets,
<PB N="208" REF="033485_0207_0FF72112B2AE3E40">
a pen-knife, a p&s;alm-book, and a quire of pa|per. This &s;ituation, &s;o unnatural and ab&s;urd, cannot la&s;t long, and, the &s;ooner that we put an end to it, the better. It was the con&s;tant policy of Britain, to rivet the &s;hackles of this country, by &s;trangling in their cradle, her in|fant manufactures. Chatham, who&s;e &s;tatue has been erected and demoli&s;hed in this country, declared, in parliament, that he would not &s;uf|fer the colonies to manufacture a hob-nail for a hor&s;e&s;hoe. If this antagoni&s;t of America, could expre&s;s him&s;elf in &s;uch language, we know upon what quarter public intere&s;t calls for exertion. We no longer &s;end for hob-nails, becau&s;e, by a late ingenious invention, we make nails better, quicker, and cheaper than any other people; and we may &s;oon expect other di&s;coveries of utility.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Of manufactures few de&s;erve encouragement better than that of paper. But it can never reach maturity, while we continue to import annually from Europe, &s;uch immen&s;e quanti|ties of printed books. As paper it&s;elf is made out of rags, and as this is the only u&s;e to which they can be put, the price of paper manufactur|ed in America, is, in a great mea&s;ure, clear gain to the country. This is one rea&s;on why the erection of paper mills claims patronage from every friend to the United States.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But that is not all. By extending the &s;cale of making paper, we may expect to lower its price, and by lowering the price of paper, we encou|rage another great and mo&s;t u&s;eful trade, that of printing. The latter, within the la&s;t ten years, has ari&s;en in this city from almo&s;t nothing, to a con&s;iderable extent. Typography augments the &s;tock of public knowledge, and knowledge improves the morals, and &s;timulates the diligence
<PB N="209" REF="033485_0208_0FF7211469557F48">
of the people. So attentive is Britain to her intere&s;t, in this re&s;pect, that no book which has ever been printed in that i&s;land, is allowed to be imported into it. If &s;uch a book falls out of print, the nation mu&s;t remain without it, un|le&s;s a Briti&s;h book&s;eller &s;hall republi&s;h it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The&s;e con&s;iderations &s;hew the propriety of encouraging a publication like ours.

<HI>federal</HI> &s;ide, and that would have been accepted as an ample excu&s;e, by his pre&s;ent employers, al|though his rabble had burnt the &s;tate-hou&s;e. No mortal, excepting a Philadelphian board of admiral|ty, ever dreamed of paying the captain of a &s;hip for three or four years before &s;he was built. This is an undi&s;gui&s;ed theft of public money; yet al|though <HI>theft</HI> is its only proper name, not one of our repre&s;entatives has dared to challenge it. The &s;alary is nine hundred dollars per annum; and &s;uppo&s;ing it held for three years before the launch, then each of our three captains has co&s;t two thou|&s;and &s;even hundred dollars before he had any ve&s;|&s;el to command. Our executive might as well have ca&s;t the&s;e eight thou&s;and one hundred dollars, into the Delaware. The duke of Richmond's tax upon coals is a larger but not a plainer job; nor has the &s;alary of Dr. James Mea&s;e, at Mud I&s;land, been more woefully thrown away. From &s;uch a &s;ample the inference is that prodigality has engraf|ted it&s;elf upon every other part of the expendi|ture of the eleven hundred thou&s;and dollars; and that it is imprudent to tru&s;t our exi&s;ting ru|lers with any money that can be kept out of their hands. The&s;e pen&s;ions to captains are like an Engli&s;h county-mark on a &s;harper's cheek, which at once unfolds the rece&s;&s;es of his character. This would have been a powerful an&s;wer from Mr. Chri&s;tie, to Me&s;&s;rs. Parker and Swanwick's defence of the &s;ix frigates.</P>
<P>On June 24th, 1797, Mr. Gallatin &s;aid, in con|gre&s;s, that the building of the frigates would co&s;t double, and the payment of their &s;eamen, almo&s;t treble of what they would have done in Britain. This is one of the con&s;equences of an exce&s;s of pa|per money. A million of dollars, in 1796, were not, in reality, worth more than &s;even hundred thou|&s;and,
<PB N="211" REF="033485_0210_0FF7211887AC3BC0">
or thereby, three years before. The altera|tion in value has been &s;everely felt by government. From October 1&s;t, 1795, to September 30th, 1796, the charges of the military department amounted to twelve hundred and &s;ixty-three thou&s;and dollars. Of this &s;um, it is likely that one-third or fourth part would have been &s;aved, if flour had not ri&s;en be|yond eight dollars per barrel. If congre&s;s had been able to lay a duty upon exports, this inconvenience mu&s;t have found a remedy. A duty of three dollars per barrel on exportation was &s;ure of making flour as much cheaper at home. But at pre&s;ent, the imme|&s;urable influence of the landed intere&s;t overbears every other part of the community. Commerce cannot be protected without a fleet, and yet the farmers, who reap the large&s;t &s;hare of the benefits of commerce, refu&s;e even a penny to build one. "You &s;hall not tax our exports," &s;ays the con&s;titu|tion. "You &s;hall not tax our lands," exclaim the farming majority in congre&s;s. <Q>Buy our flour, at double the former price. En&s;ure and &s;hip it. You and the underwriters mu&s;t look to that. If we are paid, it is a matter of indifference in our eyes, whether your ve&s;&s;els are captured or not. We &s;hall not pay for mounting a &s;ingle tier of guns to protect them.</Q> The farmers have treated the merchants with as much ungenero&s;ity, as the latter have exhibited towards their &s;eamen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of 1796, Chap. III.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The original object of the frigates was to &s;ail to the coa&s;t of Africa, and attack the Algerines. The ab&s;urdity of that plan has already been proved<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">American Annual Regi&s;ter, Chap. III. &amp; IX.</NOTE>; but the inference does not follow, that American commerce can ever be &s;ecure without a navy. Four material objections occur again&s;t proceeding, at pre|&s;ent, in the bu&s;ine&s;s. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Government has no
<PB N="212" REF="033485_0211_0FF7211F807128C0">
money, and could not borrow a &s;um equal to any &s;erious equipment. <HI>Second,</HI> Unle&s;s there is either a land-tax, or an amendment of the con&s;titution, as to taxing of exports, the trea&s;ury mu&s;t always be in a mendicant condition, and incapable to &s;upport a navy, though it were built for nothing. <HI>Third,</HI> It is admitted, that the frigates have co&s;t much more than they &s;hould have done, after allow|ing for the ri&s;e of wages. Hence, it is di&s;agreeable to vote money for &s;uch bad managers. <HI>Fourth,</HI> If Mr. Adams po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a fleet of any tolerable force, he would never be quiet, until he got into &s;ome quarrel with the French navy. An American &s;qua|dron is highly needful, but till the &s;y&s;tem of finance has been improved, the plan of building one cannot be &s;ucce&s;sful. At the &s;ame time, till public money &s;hall be under more frugal management, it could hardly be advi&s;eable.</P>
<P>The following is a &s;hort hi&s;tory of the progre&s;s and expence of the federal navy. On March 27th, 1794, an act pa&s;t for building four frigates of for|ty-four guns, and two of thirty-&s;ix. A &s;econd act of June 9th, 1794, appropriated &s;ix hundred and eighty-eight thou&s;and, eight hundred and eighty eight dollars, and eighty two cents <Q>to defray the expences which &s;hall be incurred, pur&s;uant to</Q> that act. This expre&s;&s;ion is not correct. The former law had likewi&s;e appointed the number of the crews, their wages and rations; but the ap|propriation of money, of June 9th, did not extend to the&s;e articles. It regarded only the charge of building the &s;ix frigates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Aurora, of January 18th, 1798, a writer &s;ays that this &s;um comprehended <HI>&s;ix months provi&s;ions.</HI> I find nothing in the &s;ta|tute book to &s;upport &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion.</NOTE>. The e&s;timates of this expence bore an appearance of great exactne&s;s,
<PB N="213" REF="033485_0212_0FF67B906D13B028">
when they extended to eighty-two odd cents. But notice the &s;equel. Early in June, 1794, an act pa&s;t for the equipment of gallies, and that of June 9th, the la&s;t day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, appropriated eigh|ty thou&s;and dollars for this u&s;e. The law for the gallies was &s;ince repealed, and, on April 20th, 1796, congre&s;s added the &s;um appointed for them to the fund for the frigates. At the &s;ame time, the latter were reduced from &s;ix to three, viz. to two of forty-four guns and one of thirty-&s;ix.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this reduction, an act of March 3d, 1797, granted an hundred and &s;eventy-two thou&s;and additional dollars <Q>for fini&s;hing the fri|gates <HI>United States, Con&s;titution,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tella|tion;</HI></Q> be&s;ides five thou&s;and for the pay and &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence of three <HI>captains,</HI> and of labourers employ|ed in taking care of the three frigates. An act of July 10th, 1797, a&s;&s;igned two hundred thou&s;and dollars more for completing of the&s;e frigates.</P>
<P>The whole &s;ums appropriated &s;tood thus.</P>

<P>By the fir&s;t e&s;timate, &s;ix frigates were to be com|pleted for &s;ix hundred and eighty-eight thou&s;and dollars; and, yet with four hundred and fifty-two thou&s;and as a &s;upplement, three were not fini&s;hed. In the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, of November 1797, an hun|dred and fifty thou&s;and dollars were again a&s;ked.
<PB N="214" REF="033485_0213_0FF72122A8969C18">
Surpri&s;ed by this new demand, Mr. Living&s;ton brought into the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives a re&s;o|lution for appointing a committee of enquiry into the expenditure of money, which had been appro|priated for the naval &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The re&s;olution was taken up on the 15th of Ja|nuary, 1798. Mr. Harper objected to it, as im|plying a cen&s;ure on public officers, which was improper; &s;ince there had not been &s;pecified any ground of &s;u&s;picion again&s;t them. He &s;aid that &s;tatements from the public offices were, within a few days, to be laid before the hou&s;e, agreeably to a previous order, and recommended that no com|mittee &s;hould be appointed, till the&s;e papers had been examined. If they did not prove &s;atisfactory, he &s;hould vote for enquiry.</P>
<P>Mr. Living&s;ton replied that the patience of the hou&s;e had been worn out by the&s;e repeated appli|cations for money. The expence had exceeded all belief. The mo&s;t exten&s;ive imagination could not have conceived an amount like that which con|gre&s;s had, from time to time, been blindly led to appropriate. The &s;tatements expected, and re|ferred to by Mr. Harper, came down only to Ja|nuary 1&s;t, 1797. They could not, therefore, even if the hou&s;e had them, give adequate &s;atisfaction. The three hundred and &s;eventy-two thou&s;and dollars granted &s;ince January 1&s;t, 1797, and the demand now made, did not come within the period of the&s;e papers. This was the main &s;cope of Mr. Living&s;ton's ob&s;ervations. The re&s;olution pa&s;t, and a committee were appointed.</P>
<P>Next day, January 16th, 1798, &s;ome documents from the war-office were laid before the hou&s;e. In&s;tead of an hundred and fifty thou&s;and dollars, the &s;um formerly applied for, only an hundred and fifteen thou&s;and, eight hundred and thirty-three

<P>By the computation of March, 1794, each of the &s;ix frigates was to co&s;t a fraction le&s;s than one hun|dred and fifteen thou&s;and dollars. By the actual i&s;&s;ue, in January, 1798, each of the&s;e three &s;hips that were to be completed, will co&s;t, as above &s;pecified, an overplus of an hundred and eighty-nine thou&s;and dollars. This makes, upon a medium for each frigate, three hundred and four thou&s;and dollars, in&s;tead of the original e&s;timate of an hun|dred and fifteen thou&s;and.</P>
<P>Three &s;hips are not to be fini&s;hed. The materials mu&s;t either be &s;old or laid up. It is natural to be|lieve that a con&s;iderable part of them would be ap|plied to the completion of the other three ve&s;&s;els. Hence the real co&s;t of the latter will exceed three hundred and four thou&s;and dollars each, as trench|ing on more than their proportion of the materials, bought with the original &s;ix hundred and eighty-eight thou&s;and dollars. In a word, it may &s;afely be affirmed, that the <HI>United States,</HI> and her two &s;i&s;ters, have required thrice as much money as they were expected to co&s;t; and double the &s;um for which an architect on the river Thames would have built them. Almo&s;t four years have been occupied, and this American armada is not yet completed.</P>
<P>In 1794, when the plan was fir&s;t adopted, Dr.
<PB N="216" REF="033485_0215_0FF7212A5D4EEE00">
Smith, and his friends, affirmed, that the frigates might be built, manned, and blockading the &s;treights of Gibraltar, within a year. At the end of <HI>two</HI> years, the pre&s;ident informed congre&s;s, that &s;ome of their keels were laid, and &s;ome of their &s;tern-po&s;ts rai&s;ed, all <HI>in the be&s;t manner.</HI> So &s;kilful were the calcula|tions of Dr. Smith, and &s;o rapid the progre&s;s of our admiralty! The above documents, of January 16th, e&s;timate the pay and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the officers and crews for a year, at two hundred and eighty thou|&s;and, three hundred and &s;eventy-nine dollars. Thus, the total &s;um wanted immediately, amounts to three hundred and ninety-&s;ix thou&s;and, two hundred and twelve dollars.</P>
<P>This money can only be rai&s;ed by loan; and, in the fullne&s;s of time, the intere&s;t of that loan mu&s;t al&s;o be borrowed. On July 6th, 1797, an act pa&s;t for a &s;tamp duty on vellum, parchment, and paper. But &s;uch an uproar has been excited again&s;t it, that, in the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, the operation of the law has been &s;u&s;pended until the fir&s;t of July next. On July 8th, when a number of repre&s;entatives had gone to the country, an act pa&s;t for an additional duty on &s;alt. It originated in the diligence of Dr. Smith. A re&s;olution is, at pre&s;ent, before congre&s;s for the repeal both of the&s;e &s;alt <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the &s;e&s;&s;ion of December, 1796, Mr. Findley told the repre|&s;entatives that, before leaving the we&s;tern country, he had paid fix guineas for &s;ix bu&s;hels of &s;alt. In that part of Penn&s;ylvania, it is &s;aid to have &s;ometimes co&s;t eight dollars per bu&s;hel.</NOTE> and &s;tamp duties. They were the only taxes laid in the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of the fifth congre&s;s, and they are mo&s;t likely to be repealed <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The exci&s;e on refined &s;ugar ought to &s;hare the &s;ame fate.</NOTE>. In the preceeding &s;e&s;&s;ion, although the want of money was &s;trongly urged, no more than two &s;tatutes of taxation were pa&s;t. The one laid an additional duty on certain imported articles. The
<PB N="217" REF="033485_0216_0FF7212BEBCD5548">
other altered the mode of exci&s;ing &s;tills. If they produce any augmentation whatever, of the reve|nue, it can be but trifling. In the interim, the de&s;|truction of trade en&s;ures an immen&s;e mutilation of impo&s;t duties, for 1797. We &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee the par|ticulars in a report from the trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>The expences of government are in a &s;tate of con&s;tant augmentation. The abortive efforts of the two la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ions prove, that its practical &s;ources of new revenue are almo&s;t exhau&s;ted. When expence uniformly exceeds income, the re&s;ult is known. In the event of a French war, the ruin of commerce would en&s;ure an annual <HI>deficit,</HI> at the trea&s;ury, of &s;everal millions of dollars. The intere&s;t of the national debt could no longer be paid; and bank|ruptcy mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, en&s;ue. Yet, in &s;ummer la&s;t, pen&s;ioner Harper told congre&s;s that, <Q>if we threw our &s;word into the Briti&s;h &s;cale, the French would <HI>kick the beam!</HI></Q> America can be but a cracker at the tail of England's explo&s;ion. Mr. Allen, in the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ion, declared, that, <Q>if France obtained Loui&s;iana from Spain, we ought to <HI>de|clare war</HI> again&s;t the republic.</Q> He did not in|form the hou&s;e on what right he re&s;ted their claim to direct Spain in the di&s;po&s;al of her colonies. On the &s;ame ground, if congre&s;s were to a&s;&s;ign Rhode-I&s;land, or Nantucket, to the Dutch, England, or Sweden, would be warranted in commencing ho&s;|tilities again&s;t this country. We need not &s;tartle at jacobin rapacity, or the partition of Poland, or the Briti&s;h in the Old Jer&s;ey, or the Dutch at Amboyna, or Titus at Jeru&s;alem, when one of <HI>our own</HI> ine&s;|timable repre&s;entatives recommends a project the hermaphrodite offspring of Newgate and of bedlam. It is time to &s;peak di&s;tinctly, when a few lunatics or traitors have brought this continent to the brink of a French war, that is, to the brink of perdition.

In three months after it &s;hall begin, the value of ground property, in Philadelphia, will &s;ink to fifty per cent. of its pre&s;ent value.</P>
<P>Another &s;ure con&s;equence mu&s;t be the breaking up of the union. Kentucky and Tenne&s;&s;ee have been long and ju&s;tly exa&s;perated at the Hamiltonian &s;y&s;|tem of defending the frontiers. The approaching clo&s;e of this volume does not leave room for in&s;ert|ing an inve&s;tigation of that amazing bu&s;ine&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A paper on this head is ready for the pre&s;s, and will appear at an early opportunity.</NOTE>. Many tyrants have want only murdered their &s;ubjects; but the Wa&s;hington cabinet exhibits the fir&s;t example in hi&s;tory, of a government, that will neither de|fend its people, nor &s;uffer them to defend them&s;elves. On the Atlantic &s;ide of the continent, this &s;ubject is as gro&s;sly mi&s;apprehended, as the we&s;tern expedi|tion hitherto has been. Kentucky and Tenne&s;&s;ee are in a rapid progre&s;s of population<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In 1796, twenty-two thou&s;and white people, and eleven thou|&s;and blacks, emigrated into the we&s;tern part of Tenne&s;&s;ee. They had to cro&s;s Cumberland river by two ferries, at which an ac|count was kept of their numbers. I had this from Mr. Andrew Jack&s;on, one of the &s;enators from that &s;tate, in the pre&s;ent congre&s;s. He computes the total amount of emigrants, in 1796, at between forty and fifty thou&s;and.</NOTE>. They know the real cau&s;e which retards the execution of the Spani&s;h treaty, and the &s;etting open of the we&s;tern waters. France is enraged at the compact with Eng|land. She &s;ways, with irre&s;i&s;table weight, in the court of Madrid; and the treaty with Spain will never be fulfilled, till that with England has been modified or di&s;&s;olved. The &s;outh-we&s;tern citizens regard a free navigation as the chief object of their wi&s;hes. The republic, by the medium of Spain, has only to hold out this temptation, as the &s;ignal of re|volt. The Philadelphians would not con&s;ent to &s;hut up the Delaware, for the &s;ake of protracting their
<PB N="219" REF="033485_0218_0FF7212F2E3BA5C8">
union with Kentucky. They cannot require that &s;elf-denial which they would not exert.</P>
<P>By the calculation, above in&s;erted, of three times the original e&s;timate of the three frigates, the final outfit of each of them comes to three hundred and forty-five thou&s;and dollars, or in whole to one million and thirty-five thou&s;and dollars. They carry an hundred and twenty-four guns, which thus co&s;t, within a minute fraction, eight thou&s;and three hundred and forty-&s;ix dollars, and three fourths, per gun. In &s;terling money this amounts to eighteen hundred and &s;eventy-eight pounds, eight &s;hillings and four-pence halfpenny. In Eng|land, the common computation for every gun, is a thou&s;and pounds, including &s;tores for &s;ix months. The&s;e do not come within the above American e&s;timate; &s;o that England can &s;end a &s;hip to &s;ea, at half our charge. Yet, from the decline of &s;hip-building, in con&s;equence of Jay's treaty, wages are, at this time, comparatively low. The current wages of American &s;eamen are thirty dollars per month; a rate unheard of in the French or Engli&s;h &s;ervice. With &s;uch an odds of expence again&s;t the United States, it is needle&s;s to think of a navy.</P>
<P>Indians have been &s;poke of in this chapter. On January 18th, 1798, an e&s;timate was laid before the repre&s;entatives of the charges of a propo|&s;ed treaty with the Cherokees. The whole &s;um amounts to twenty-five thou&s;and, eight hundred and eighty dollars. This includes fifteen thou&s;and dollars for rations to <HI>two thou&s;and</HI> Indians; and five thou&s;and dollars for pre&s;ents. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that the&s;e Indians, as well as the Creeks, have never kept a &s;ingle agreement made with them. Their perfidy is equal to their cruelty. If a new treaty is to be framed, there can be no u&s;e for the pre&s;ence of two thou&s;and &s;avages. Two

hundred are &s;ufficient; and this would &s;ave thir|teen thou&s;and five hundred dollars. The &s;ums an|nually wa&s;ted on the&s;e people are very con&s;idera|ble. It is time to try another way of <HI>treating.</HI> Offer an hundred dollars per &s;calp for the fir&s;t three hundred Cherokee warriors, who &s;hall be cut, or &s;hot down. The &s;outh-we&s;tern riflemen will &s;oon earn the money. This may be called inhumani|ty. But if one of the&s;e Indians had &s;tabbed your father, and &s;tuck the hearts of your children, on the point of his &s;calping knife, perhaps you might endure the propo&s;al. Government is afraid of a frontier militia. Were the rampart of &s;avages removed, thou&s;ands of families would in&s;tantly wander beyond the reach of cu&s;toms and exci&s;e. The pre&s;ident and &s;enate, &s;upported by a party of repre&s;entatives, chu&s;e rather to give the Indi|ans every po&s;&s;ible mea&s;ure of countenance and protection, to expend very large &s;ums of money in the purcha&s;e of treaties that are &s;ure to be broken, and to connive at &s;ome hundreds of annu|al murders.</P>
<P>Our pre&s;ent political a&s;pect does not promi&s;e much. It combines the helple&s;sne&s;s of infancy with the decrepitude of age; the feeblene&s;s of a young government without its alledged purity, and the corruption of an old one, without its readine&s;s of re&s;ources. The world never &s;aw a more com|plicated &s;cene of weakne&s;s, ignorance, and folly, than that now di&s;played in the United States. The pre&s;ident, on May 16th, 1797, delivers a &s;peech again&s;t France, that is only ju&s;t le&s;s than a declara|tion of war. In the &s;ame moment, he pretends to de&s;ire a peace with the French. For this pur|po&s;e he &s;ends back to Paris Pinckney, the very man who had ju&s;t quarrelled with the directory, and who, by his ob&s;tinacy and impertinence, had
<PB N="221" REF="033485_0220_0FF721370FB0FF90">
forced them to thru&s;t him out of their territories. To cut up all chance of future confidence between the two governments, Mr. Adams &s;uffers, or invites congre&s;s to print Pinckney's confidential corre&s;pon|dence. The repre&s;entatives de&s;ire a li&s;t of French and Briti&s;h depredations. Me&s;&s;rs.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Gazette of the United States is the profe&s;&s;ed organ of the political &s;entiments of Mr. Adams and his friends. Hence its princi|ples become important, le&s;s by their intrin&s;ic value than on account of the &s;ource from whence they &s;pring.</P>
<P>In Mr. Fenno's paper, of January 10th, 1798, a writer &s;peaks of <Q>nine hundred and fifty millions

It &s;ig|nifies a government by the people. The con&s;titution begins in the&s;e words: "We the people of the United States, do ordain," &amp;c. &s;o that the de&s;ign was evidently democratical. If the Adam|ites di&s;approve this preamble, they might &s;ugge&s;t an amend|ment. <Q>We, the well-born holders of bank, and &s;ix per cent. &s;tock, do ordain.</Q> A paper at Walpole, in New-Hamp&s;hire, late|ly referred to the <HI>lepro&s;y of</HI> REPUBLICANISM. A federali&s;t, as he &s;igns him&s;elf, &s;peaks, in the &s;ame print, of a late fire at Bo&s;|ton. "The <HI>&s;ame &s;pirit,</HI>" &s;ays he, <Q>which lighted a flame in <HI>&s;eventy-five,</HI> would &s;urvey with indifference a blazing &s;treet in <HI>ninety-&s;even,</HI> rather than forget the &s;urly <HI>&s;pirit of oppo&s;ition.</HI></Q> If this rant has any meaning, it implies a cen&s;ure on the revo|lution. Probably the printer, at Walpole, is likewi&s;e po&s;t-ma&s;ter. This is a frequent executive arrangement, and &s;ecure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a pre&s;s to the party.</NOTE>. If malice could vent it&s;elf in prayer, the actual &s;tate of our <HI>enemies,</HI> the French, exceeds <HI>its la&s;t &s;upreme ejaculation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>If the French have become our enemies, this ari&s;es from the mean, pedlar-like &s;pirit of our po|licy. Their <HI>actual &s;tate</HI> is certainly different from ours. France is the terror, and the United States are the contempt of Europe. Their friend&s;hip is univer&s;ally courted, and ours univer&s;ally de&s;pi&s;ed. In confidence that the republic would be overtur|ned, America ha&s;ted to de&s;ert her benefactre&s;s. By an eventual and offen&s;ive treaty, &s;he guaranteed the French dominions, at a period when, but for the &s;ake of form, her guarantee was not worth acceptance. In 1794, &s;he could not fulfil the &s;ti|pulations of 1778; but, to prove that her ingrati|tude was equal to her weakne&s;s, &s;he inverted them. Jay's treaty compri&s;es a multitude of conditions in|jurious to the republic. The plan of this agreement was made by Mr. Wa&s;hington, in April, 1794. At

that time France, like Cae&s;ar at Munda, contended not for empire, but exi&s;tence.

<P>We return to Mr. Fenno's corre&s;pondent. <Q>Hu|man happine&s;s, &s;ays he, will not be encrea&s;ed, till all the pre&s;ent actors of the <HI>farce of innova|tion,</HI> are rotted and forgotten. To ameliorate the &s;tate of &s;ociety, by de&s;troying <HI>tyranny</HI> and <HI>&s;uper|&s;tition,</HI> is a benevolent wi&s;h. I have li&s;tened to, and repeated, tho&s;e fairy tales my&s;elf. It is a <HI>dream!</HI></Q> The&s;e are the manly &s;entiments propa|gated by our executive. They imply an expre&s;s cen&s;ure of the American revolution, which attempt|ed to overturn tyranny, but only half completed its de&s;ign. The party who at pre&s;ent hold the govern|ment, found means to &s;addle America with a debt which daily grows larger; and they have now taken the ground and the doctrines of George the third.</P>
<P>Mr. Fenno pronounces, that, to attempt the improvement of &s;ociety, by de&s;troying tyranny and &s;uper&s;tition, is a fairy tale and a dream. The mind cannot conceive, nor can language ex|pre&s;s, a more hateful maxim. Candour will place no confidence in a party capable of inculcating &s;uch opinions. As for the attack on France, it chimes in uni&s;on with the two &s;peeches of pre&s;ident Adams.
<PB N="225" REF="033485_0224_0FF7214263631500">
A few extracts from the fir&s;t of the&s;e productions will prove this to be true. In that of May 16th, 1797, he &s;peaks thus:</P>
<P><Q>The refu&s;al, on the part of France, to receive our mini&s;ter, is, then, the denial of a right; but the refu&s;al to receive him until we have acceded to their demands, without di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, is to treat us neither as allies nor as friends, nor as a &s;ove|reign people.</Q>&mdash;As for the matter of <HI>right,</HI> Vat|tel contradicts Mr. Adams<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the &s;peech of Mr. Freeman, in the &s;equel of this chapter.</NOTE>. General Wa&s;hington refu&s;ed to open a letter from lord Howe; and the old congre&s;s would not treat with Carli&s;le, and the re&s;t of North's commi&s;&s;ioners. Citizen Adet had attempted to negociate at Philadelphia. He was treated with neglect, and Mr. Adams and his friends encouraged a Briti&s;h agent to lampoon him. As for <HI>allies</HI> or <HI>friends,</HI> the United States had no claim to either title. Jay's treaty put an end to it.</P>
<P>Again.&mdash;<Q>There is rea&s;on to believe, that the executive directory pa&s;t a decree, on the 2d of March la&s;t, contravening, in part, the treaty of amity and commerce of 1778, injurious to our lawful commerce, and endangering the lives of our citizens.</Q> They acted only in &s;elf-defence. This decree is fully explained in the next chapter. The Briti&s;h were then, and are &s;till &s;eizing Ameri|can &s;hips, and pre&s;&s;ing their &s;eamen; but Mr. Adams pa&s;&s;es over that.</P>
<P><Q>Endeavours have been employed to e&s;tabli&s;h and fo&s;ter a divi&s;ion between the government and people of the United States. To inve&s;tigate the cau&s;es which have encouraged this attempt is not nece&s;&s;ary.</Q>&mdash;The mo&s;t likely cau&s;e is Engli&s;h gold. Web&s;ter and Ru&s;&s;el, that ideot of editors, who has defended Hamilton's <HI>Defence,</HI> would not
<PB N="226" REF="033485_0225_0FF72143F2064640">
write &s;o much non&s;en&s;e to &s;erve Pitt, unle&s;s he paid them. No man in his wits will believe that Camil|lus wrote his thirty-eight letters for nothing. Did he ever plead thirty-eight cau&s;es without a fee?</P>
<P>But Mr. Adams refers not to the&s;e gentry, for they are his intimate friends. He alludes to the &s;peech of Barras, as alarming; though this trifle could make no more impre&s;&s;ion on the public mind of America, than a pi&s;tol-ball on the ba&s;tions of Luxembourg. The &s;uppo&s;ition, that it was to have a dangerous effect here, betrays gro&s;s affectation, hypocri&s;y, and impo&s;ture. The people of this coun|try care very little about two or three &s;entences of a &s;peech delivered in Paris. But, if Barras was able to do &s;o much mi&s;chief, the pre&s;ident ought to have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the &s;arca&s;m. <HI>Mortui non mordent.</HI> It could do no harm, if we heard nothing about it. If a previous tran&s;lation had e&s;caped into the Aurora, a fortnight mu&s;t have &s;unk it in forgetfulne&s;s. But the point with Mr. Adams was to make a bu&s;tle, in order to make a quarrel. This is the plain truth. Mr. Adams may yet hear of a &s;peech from Barras, that &s;hall make both him and congre&s;s tremble.</P>
<P>"It mu&s;t not be permitted to be doubted," &s;ays he, <Q>whether the people of the United States will &s;upport the government, e&s;tabli&s;hed by their vo|luntary con&s;ent, and appointed by their free choice.</Q> True. But if they &s;ee that government evidently driving them into a ruinous war, without taking any one rational &s;tep to &s;hun it, they will not be tardy in making their importance felt.</P>
<P>Mr. Adams then pledges him&s;elf to &s;upport the Briti&s;h treaty. <Q>Convinced that the conduct of the government has been ju&s;t and impartial to foreign nations,&mdash;nothing will ever be done by me to im|pair the national engagements; to innovate upon principles, which have been &s;o deliberately and
<PB N="227" REF="033485_0226_0FF7214673D93950">
uprightly e&s;tabli&s;hed; or to &s;urrender, in any man|ner, the rights of the government.</Q> As the com|pact was made for fear of an Engli&s;h war, it may &s;uitably be repealed for fear of a French one. The purport of this bouncing pa&s;&s;age is to a&s;&s;ure the French, that they have no chance for conce&s;&s;ions from the United States, if Mr. Adams can di&s;ap|point them.</P>
<P>In one of his letters, publi&s;hed by congre&s;s, Charles Pinckney, when &s;peaking of his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion by the directory, puts this que&s;tion. <Q>You will judge whether <HI>the an&s;wer of the Senate and the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives to the pre&s;ident's &s;peech</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the 7th of December, 1796.</NOTE>, and the late &s;ucce&s;&s;es in Italy, have not concur|red to occa&s;ion it<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Documents p. 62.</NOTE>?</Q> The an&s;wers were only an echo to the &s;peech it&s;elf, which was quite as in|flammatory as them. But the envoy, in a letter to the &s;ecretary, could not with politene&s;s, include that &s;acred performance<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The infallibility of general Wa&s;hington is a doctrine &s;tarted &s;ince the war. At one period of the revolution, he was on the point of being &s;uperceded, as commander in chief, by the talents and popularity of governor Mifflin.</NOTE> among the cau&s;es of ir|ritation. This notice of the tendency of &s;uch addre&s;&s;es and &s;peeches, on the minds of the direc|tory, might have made Mr. Adams cautious in what way he conveyed his &s;entiments to congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Fenno's gazette of January 18th, 1798, has this pa&s;&s;age. <Q>Like the Romans, whom they (the French) imitate, war and rapine are nece&s;|&s;ary to their exi&s;tence.&mdash;If England is not de&s;troy|ed by internal faction, &s;he will be able to keep the MONSTERS <HI>in their den,</HI> until they devour each other.</Q> This writer has forgot the unpro|voked con&s;piracy of Pilnitz, by which the <HI>crowned heads</HI> were to revive in France the tragedy of
<PB N="228" REF="033485_0227_0FF7214C0542D8F8">
Poland. He has forgot that the duke of Brun&s;|wick menaced Paris, and its eight hundred thou&s;and inhabitants, with military execution.</P>
<P>Mr. Adams affects to de&s;ire a peace with France. The per&s;on who believes him is completely dive&s;|ted of common &s;en&s;e. Look at the &s;tile of his own new&s;paper. No farther evidence can be wanted. Pitch a barrel of tar into a bonfire, and &s;ay that you intend to extingui&s;h it. Such is the picture of &s;omebody. This old man cannot de&s;cend to the grave in peace, till he has entan|gled his con&s;tituents in a war that mu&s;t put an end to the government of the country, and replunge her into the horrors of 1780. The&s;e are our thanks for twenty-five thou&s;and dollars a year, for eminence, adulation, and immea&s;urable patronage. For the complete model of depravity, why &s;hould we refer to another world? Can a fallen angel be as ba&s;e as man?</P>
<P>In Mr. Pickering's letter to Pinckney, p 91, he &s;peaks thus of citizen Adet. <Q>After an exhibition of complaints in a &s;tile &s;o exceptionable, he could add but one more <HI>improper act,</HI> that of publi&s;hing his notes in the new&s;papers: he had &s;carcely tran&s;mitted them to the executive before he <HI>forwarded them to the printer for pub|lication.</HI></Q> Mr. Pickering here complains of Adet for his precipitate appeal to the pre&s;s. Granting, what is untrue, that the envoy acted wrong, Pick|ering did an offence again&s;t the directory of the &s;ame kind. This letter to Pinckney at Paris bears date the 16th of January, 1796. A copy of it was, on the 19th, &s;ent by the pre&s;ident to congre&s;s, by them in&s;tantly to the pre&s;s, and of cour&s;e to the new&s;papers. It was fit that congre&s;s &s;hould be acquainted with the letter, but its publication was a &s;till greater affront upon the directory than the
<PB N="229" REF="033485_0228_0FF7214D935FD6C0">
printing of Adet's notes was upon Pickering. The Frenchman did not &s;end his pieces to the pre&s;s till they had reached their place of de&s;tina|tion. This was a degree of politene&s;s neglected by Mr. Pickering.</P>
<P>It will be an&s;wered, that when the pre&s;ident &s;ent the papers to congre&s;s, he did not know whe|ther the repre&s;entatives would print them, and that they had a right of doing &s;o. When a fri|gate is to be built, or a &s;hip to be freighted with ammunition, for the dey of Algiers, a pre&s;ident knows in what way to communicate with the le|gi&s;lature, and yet to prevent his papers from being expo&s;ed to the public eye. The federal repre|&s;entatives &s;upport a due under&s;tanding with the executive; and unle&s;s they had known that the publication would be acceptable to him, the con|tents of Mr. Pickering's letter would have been kept &s;ecret.</P>
<P>Mr. Pinckney ob&s;erves, that the French <Q>wi&s;h to de&s;troy the trade of Great Britain, and they look upon us as one of her be&s;t cu&s;tomers, and, to obtain their object, <HI>they care not what we &s;uf|fer</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Documents, p. 63.</NOTE>.</Q> This may be very true, but it comes to a plain declaration that the French are intere&s;ted and faithle&s;s, while the publication permitted by the pre&s;ident implies that the remark enjoys his approbation. There is particular rea&s;on to believe that Rufus King hath tran&s;mitted to our executive mo&s;t unfavourable accounts of England. But not a word of them tran&s;pires from the cabinet. The truth of Pinckney's ob&s;ervation would not ju&s;tify its publication. If every man were to tell exactly what he thinks of each of his acquaintances, &s;oci|ety would be transformed into a bear-garden, and
<PB N="230" REF="033485_0229_0FF67B921A05B670">
the field of diplomacy into a field of battle. On the plain &s;core of di&s;cretion and civility, it will be difficult to defend the mea&s;ures of Me&s;&s;rs. Adams and Pickering towards the French nation. The&s;e remarks explain the degree of merit in our execu|tive. Let us now, in a &s;light &s;ketch, examine whe|ther congre&s;s it&s;elf acted better.</P>
<P>The two hou&s;es met on May 15th, 1797. The &s;peech was made on the 16th. The &s;enate did not pre&s;ent their an&s;wer till the 24th. Thus, upon this trifle, they &s;pent eight days, and twelve or fif|teen hundred dollars worth of their time. They might have made a proper an&s;wer in fifteen minutes. <Q>We learn, &s;ay they, with &s;incere concern, that attempts are in operation to alienate the af|fection of our fellow citizens from their govern|ment. Attempt, &s;o wicked, wherever they ex|i&s;t, cannot fail to excite our <HI>utmo&s;t abhorrence.</HI></Q> They mu&s;t &s;urely then have abhorred their own printer, Mr. John Fenno, for calling the preceding hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives a many-headed <HI>mon&s;ter.</HI> The &s;peech of Barras was made at a di&s;tance; and, before they went &s;o far in que&s;t of affronts offered to this government, the &s;enate &s;hould have &s;ilenced this organ of di&s;content, for it was ten thou&s;and times louder than the French directory. The an&s;wer of the &s;enate was dull and toad-eating, but much le&s;s faulty than the one reported on May 22d, from the &s;elect committee; and which, with a few &s;light alterations, was ultimately pre&s;en|ted. This committee con&s;i&s;ted of five members. The majority, Mr. Kittera, Mr. Rutledge, and Mr. Gri&s;wold, were truly federal.</P>
<P>Their report was as complai&s;ant to the &s;peech as Mr. Adams could de&s;ire it to be.&mdash;<Q>While we view with &s;atisfaction the wi&s;dom, dignity, and moderation, which have marked the mea&s;ures of
<PB N="231" REF="033485_0230_0FF7214F89B70B98">
the &s;upreme executive of our country, in its at|tempts to remove, by candid explanations, the complaints and jealou&s;ies of France, we feel the full force of that indignity which has been offer|ed our country, in <HI>the rejection of its mini&s;ter.</HI></Q> The law of nations, as laid down by Dr. Hutche|&s;on, gave the French a right of &s;ending Pinckney out of their territories; and his own letters &s;hew, that, while he remained in Paris, he proved an in|flammatory and dangerous re&s;ident. The &s;elect com|mittee will not certainly pretend, that the direc|tory were obliged to read and an&s;wer any papers that Mr. Pinckney might wi&s;h to pre&s;ent. They were to be ma&s;ters of their own time. They had already, by citizen Adet, explained, as far as they thought nece&s;&s;ary, their demands upon America. If Mr. Kit|tera becomes tired of a corre&s;pondent, he will think him&s;elf at liberty to return his letters unopened.</P>
<P>Thus much for the rejection of our mini&s;ter; but put the ca&s;e that he had been actually received. A hire|ling, in the pay of an Engli&s;h agent, is next ordered to write pamphlets again&s;t him; and, among other epi|thets, to call him <HI>an unprincipled bully; a ga&s;conading impudent bluff;</HI> and <HI>a dog</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See remarks on this ho&s;pitable treatment, in the American An|nual Regi&s;ter, Chap.

<P>Mr. Pinckney would be wor&s;e u&s;ed, by permi&s;&s;ion to re&s;ide in Paris, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, than by a direct di&s;mi&s;&s;al. A man of &s;pirit would prefer the latter.

<P><Q>Knowing, as we do, adds the report, the confidence repo&s;ed by the United States in their government, we cannot he&s;itate in expre&s;&s;ing our indignation,</Q> &amp;c. This relates to Barras, a topic-already worn to tatters. As for <HI>confidence,</HI> it is now, on the part of the republicans, at an end. On the acce&s;&s;ion of Mr. Adams, they were very well di&s;po&s;ed to live on good terms with him. Mo&s;t of them were ignorant of his corre&s;pondence with &s;ir John Scott. Several of his late oppo&s;ers declar|ed their belief of his being an hone&s;t man, and that he had too much &s;pirit to be led by any party. With great candour and propriety, Mr. Bache refu&s;ed to admit remarks unfavourable to Mr Adams. <Q>Let us give him a fair trial,</Q> &s;aid this editor, to one of his corre&s;pondents, <Q>and then, if he actually does wrong, our cen&s;ures will fall with the grea|ter weight.</Q> The Aurora was, accordingly, crammed, for &s;ome time, with encomiums on Mr.

Adams, deduced from the profe&s;&s;ions of republi|cani&s;m that he made in &s;ome &s;peeches. For conduct &s;o full of ju&s;tice and of good nature, Mr. Bache has been &s;ince upbraided in the &s;ix per cent. new&s;papers. From the 16th of May, 1797, downwards, Mr. Bache firmly believed, that Mr. Adams was only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> leader of a party. His amicable &s;tile, until the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lo&s;ure of that day, de&s;erved prai&s;e in place of cen&s;ure. Mr. Adams then convinced all impartial men, that he had entangled him&s;elf in the Briti&s;h intere&s;t. Hence he will con&s;tantly meet with their cordial oppo&s;ition. This the &s;elect committee well knew.</P>
<P>They proceed to &s;ay, that <Q>fully impre&s;&s;ed with the uncertainty of the re&s;ult, we &s;hall prepare to meet, with fortitude, any unfavourable events which may occur, with all the &s;kill we po&s;&s;e&s;s, and all the efforts in our power.</Q></P>
<P>On this report, Mr. Nicholas, in &s;trong terms, recommended a conciliating &s;tile. Upon the an&s;wer, about to be given, the peace of the United States might, in a great mea&s;ure, depend. He propo&s;ed an amendment, which was, upon the whole, proper. Yet it had this expre&s;&s;ion. <Q>The rejecting of our mini&s;ter, and the manner of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing him from the territories of France, have excited our <HI>warme&s;t &s;en&s;ibility.</HI></Q> This complaint might have been &s;par|ed. Mr. Nicholas, in his &s;peech, al&s;o &s;aid, that <Q>he hoped, on this occa&s;ion, they &s;hould get rid of that irritation, which <HI>injury</HI> naturally produced in the mind. He declared, that he felt for the <HI>in|&s;ult</HI> which had been offered to Mr. Pinckney; and he felt more for him, from the <HI>dignity</HI> with which he had borne it, and which had proved him to be <HI>a proper character for the emba&s;&s;y.</HI></Q> A rea|&s;onable &s;u&s;picion may be entertained that this re|&s;pectable member expre&s;&s;ed more &s;trongly than he
<PB N="234" REF="033485_0233_0FF721588DD42940">
felt. He &s;aw that the Briti&s;h party were very &s;trong in the hou&s;e, and that direct oppo&s;ition to the main principle of the addre&s;s would be hopele&s;s. But &s;uch half-way declarations, although &s;ometimes ex|pedient within doors, have a tendency to mi&s;lead the public at large. Mr. Nicholas, indeed, after far|ther compliments on Mr. Pinckney, and his <HI>good temper,</HI> <Q>confe&s;&s;ed, that the bu&s;ine&s;s did not &s;trike him with <HI>all</HI> the force with which it &s;eemed to have impre&s;&s;ed the mind of that re&s;pectable character.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Nicholas added, that <Q>he con&s;idered the an&s;wer, reported to them, as going to decide the que&s;tion of <HI>peace</HI> or <HI>war</HI> for this country. He thought it a thing of that &s;ort, which might have the wor&s;t po&s;&s;ible effect, and could have no good effect. It might tend to irritate, to prevent any &s;ort of enquiry or &s;ettlement taking place, but it could not tend towards an adju&s;tment of differ|ences.&mdash;We are condemning the French govern|ment, becau&s;e they a&s;k for redre&s;s, without li&s;ten|ing to negociation; yet we &s;ay to them, <HI>we</HI> are right; you have no cau&s;e to complain.</Q> Mr. Ni|cholas &s;hewed the incon&s;i&s;tency of this prejudging tone. He &s;tated, by the way, that the hou&s;e had the &s;tronge&s;t proofs, even the declaration of an Engli&s;h governor, that, in ca&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t France, England had de&s;igned to declare war again&s;t Ame|rica. The &s;peech, with a &s;mall exception, was commendable.</P>
<P>Dr. William Smith ro&s;e next. He entered into the feelings of Mr. Pinckney, and the <HI>injurious</HI> treat|ment which he had received from De la Croix and the directory. He then took a &s;urvey of the me|rits of the Briti&s;h treaty. "The gentlemen," &s;aid he, <Q>tell us we are feeble. They know that we are <HI>not</HI> feeble; and that, if occa&s;ion calls us forth,

we &s;hall be found able to defend our&s;elves.</Q> The United States have the greate&s;t natural re&s;ources for defence by land, and for attack by &s;ea. But as go|vernment neither has money, nor can tell where to get any important &s;um, a war would run the ut|mo&s;t ri&s;k of overturning it. This di&s;ablity of rai&s;|ing ca&s;h ari&s;es from the half-crown certificates, the bungling a&s;&s;umption act, and the deluge of bank notes. The doctor had, no doubt, by this time, a pre&s;cience of his emba&s;&s;y to Portugal. Yet he might have reflected that &s;ix months of a French war would &s;ink the &s;tocks to thirty per cent.</P>
<P>Mr. Freeman read a long pa&s;&s;age from Vatel. The &s;ub&s;tance of it was, that nations were not obliged to receive a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of foreign mini&s;ters, when there was nothing particular to be negociated. They might be allowed to meet &s;uch envoys upon the frontiers, to receive their me&s;&s;age, and di&s;mi&s;s them, without once permitting them to enter upon the territory of the nation to which they were &s;ent. Vatel added, that republics, in particular, might have very good rea&s;ons for not choo&s;ing to permit an amba&s;&s;ador to re&s;ide among them; becau&s;e, &s;uch a character was frequently employed to excite di&s;content among the citizens. Thus he agrees exactly with the law of nations, as already cited from Hutche&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Supra Chapter VIII.</NOTE>. Mr. Freeman re|ferred to the recent di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, by the directory, of thirteen other mini&s;ters. This &s;hewed that no par|ticular indignity had been offered to the United States.</P>
<P>Mr. Giles moved that the committee of the whole hou&s;e &s;hould ri&s;e, in order to refer the report, and amendment by Mr. Nicholas, back to the &s;elect com|mittee.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="033485_0235_0FF7215CC87E7FE0">This propo&s;al was objected to, with great vio|lence. At that part of the debate, Mr. Otis made his maiden &s;peech. A few extracts &s;hall be given from a copy of it written by him&s;elf.&mdash;<Q>His con|&s;tituents, and him&s;elf, were di&s;po&s;ed to regard the inhabitants of the &s;outhern &s;tates as <HI>brothers.</HI></Q> [The party who &s;ent Mr. Otis to congre&s;s, take every opening to calumniate the &s;outhern &s;tates.

If their plan of paying the national debt had been adopted, Dr. Smith, and Mr. Hillhou&s;e, would have only got the ten-pence or half-crown per pound, which they actually paid for certi|tificates. Thus twenty or thirty millions of dollars might have been &s;aved. Seven years ago, four mil|lions of dollars were &s;ufficient for building ten &s;hips of the line, and twenty frigates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In 1794, the &s;ix frigates were expected to be built for &s;ix hun|dred and ninety thou&s;and dollars; and in 1790, they could probably have been built for that &s;um.

His claim on government is eight or ten times ju&s;ter than that of Sedgwick or William Smith, yet he gets not a &s;ingle cent.

This is the &s;ort of people under who&s;e banner Mr. Otis hath enli&s;ted. His &s;peech proceeds thus:]</P>
<P><Q>The injuries &s;u&s;tained by us were of a high and atrocious nature, con&s;i&s;ting in the capture of our ve&s;&s;els, depredations upon the property and per&s;ons of our citizens, the indignity offered to our mini&s;ter; but what was more aggrava|vating than the re&s;t, was, the profe&s;&s;ed deter|mination not to receive our mini&s;ter until the complaints of the French &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed, without explanation and without exception; until we &s;hould violate treaties, repeal laws, and do what the con&s;titution would not authori&s;e, vacate &s;olemn judgments of our courts of law.</Q></P>
<P>This extract &s;hall have a full an&s;wer. To be|gin with the Briti&s;h treaty, it was an injury of a high and atrocious nature towards France. It contravened our previous treaty with her. Be|&s;ides an hundred other writers, Mr. Dallas, in his <HI>Features,</HI> has clearly proved this point. With a general reference to that pamphlet, Part V. one or two in&s;tances are here in&s;erted.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="033485_0237_0FF72162E9BBB740">By the eleventh<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dallas, by mi&s;take, cites it as the ninth.</NOTE> article of the treaty of alliance between Louis XVI. and the United States, the lat|ter guarantee to the former <Q>the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the crown of France in America, as well as tho&s;e which it may acquire by the future treaty of peace.</Q> The king, on his part, guarantees the territories of the United States. The federal party have &s;pent thou&s;ands of pages to prove that America owes nothing to France, on the &s;core of gratitude, which was exclu&s;ively due to the king him&s;elf. Nay &s;ome of them have alledged that the treaties between the two countries were voided by the di&s;&s;olution of the monarchy. If the latter po&s;ition is true, France cannot be blamed <HI>for break|ing obligations that cea&s;e to exi&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Alexander Hamilton, in his long-winded letters of <HI>Pacificus,</HI> argues that the guarantee became void, becau&s;e the treaty was entitled not <HI>offen&s;ive</HI> and de|fen&s;ive, but only <HI>eventual</HI> and defen&s;ive; and as the French were the fir&s;t to declare war again&s;t Eng|land, hence they were the <HI>offen&s;ive</HI> party, and the guarantee expired, at lea&s;t for this time. Such ap|pears to be his inference.</P>
<P>If this was the view of the treaty, it &s;hould have been &s;o expre&s;&s;ed. But the twelfth article, though explanatory, makes no di&s;tinction, and the conclu&s;ion ought to be that the two powers never once thought of it. The guarantee is in <HI>general terms.</HI> If we forbear to guarantee the French We&s;t-Indies, we &s;hould certainly not a&s;&s;i&s;t England in at|tacking them. If the treaty had any &s;ignification whatever, this was implied in it, for its whole avowed object was <HI>to re&s;i&s;t Britain.</HI> Without pro|vi&s;ions from the United States, the Engli&s;h could not have attacked Martinique, or Guadaloupe.
<PB N="239" REF="033485_0238_0FF72166496B31A0">
Every barrel of pork or flour &s;hipped from this continent to the Briti&s;h We&s;t-Indies, was as clearly a&s;&s;i&s;ting England again&s;t France, as if we had &s;ent our three frigates. A &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of &s;hipping provi|&s;ions would have entirely prevented Engli&s;h military operations, and have &s;tarved the Engli&s;h i&s;lands. This was to render to France a very important &s;ervice; and, being merely of the negative kind, it furni&s;h|ed to England no pretence for ho&s;tilities.</P>
<P>It will be &s;aid that &s;uch a prohibition was to <HI>&s;acrifice commerce.</HI> Every guarantee implies a &s;acri|fice. If a man is never to fulfil a treaty, when it cro&s;&s;es his per&s;onal intere&s;t, it is entirely u&s;ele&s;s to make treaties. By &s;tepping forward in this way, America could have &s;hewed that &s;he was not, what &s;he now is, the mere anvil of the belligerent world. To &s;ave her We&s;t-Indies, England could not have helped acceding to a peace; while, placed upon an i&s;thmus, between the oppo&s;ite tides of ho&s;ti|lity, America might, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, have dicta|ted the terms of an agreement. By doing nothing, by a mere act of negation, &s;he was to have done every thing. By an embargo again&s;t England, for only four months, America could not have lo&s;t more than five or &s;ix millions of dollars, and very probably not half that &s;um. The whole exports of 1793, came only to twenty-&s;ix millions of dollars; and, on a medium, tho&s;e of four months, came to le&s;s than nine millions. Of the&s;e nine millions a great part did not con&s;i&s;t of provi&s;ions. Such were cotton, indigo, and fifty-nine thou&s;and nine hundred and forty-&s;even hog&s;heads of tobacco. Of the pro|vi&s;ions various kinds, as pork and beef, were in no danger of &s;poiling. Much of the flour would have been exported, with other vivres, to the We&s;t-Indies, in French bottoms. Much of the remain|der could have been kept without &s;uffering damage.
<PB N="240" REF="033485_0239_0FF72167E05ABED0">
Putting the&s;e matters together, it will be &s;een that, by four months of patience and fidelity, and at the lo&s;s, comparatively &s;mall, of one, two, or three millions of dollars, America might have pre&s;erved her character, along with French amity. She had only to prohibit every American or foreign ve&s;&s;el from exporting provi&s;ions, with the &s;ingle exception of France.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ALONG with the treaty of alliance eventual and defen&s;ive, there was &s;ub&s;cribed at Paris another of amity and commerce. The latter in&s;trument, in a &s;pirit of liberality very different
<PB N="241" REF="033485_0240_0FF7216C8521F318">
from Jay's, had fixed the rule that <HI>free bottoms make free goods.</HI> The twenty-third article &s;ays, that it &s;hall be lawful <Q>to &s;ail with the &s;hips and merchan|di&s;es aforementioned, and to trade with the &s;ame liberty and &s;ecurity from the places, ports, and havens of tho&s;e who are <HI>enemies of both or either party,</HI> without any oppo&s;ition, or di&s;turbance what&s;oever, not only directly from the places of the enemy aforementioned to neutral places; but al&s;o from <HI>one place belonging to an enemy,</HI> to ano|ther place belonging to an enemy.&mdash;And it is hereby &s;tipulated, that free &s;hips &s;hall al&s;o give a freedom to goods.</Q> The article has much more to this effect. The twenty-fourth enumerates all &s;orts of <HI>provi&s;ions</HI> as coming within the definition of free goods. This treaty is dated at Paris, Fe|bruary 6th, 1778.</P>
<P>The eighteenth article of the Briti&s;h treaty has been above cited, and be&s;ides aboli&s;hing the privilege of free bottoms, it warrants the &s;eizure of provi|&s;ions, on paying the price of them.</P>
<P>The twenty-fifth article does, indeed, &s;ay, that, <Q>nothing in this treaty contained &s;hall, however, be con&s;trued or operate contrary to former and exi&s;t|ing public treaties with <HI>other &s;overeigns or &s;tates.</HI></Q> If this &s;tipulation had been ob&s;erved, it &s;eems that the republic would have had no cau&s;e to com|plain of that eighteenth article. But the mea&s;ures of England have been a &s;y&s;tematic violation of it. In &s;pite of the treaty of Paris, America has con|&s;tantly &s;uffered French goods to be taken out of her bottoms. Va&s;t quantities of provi&s;ions have been &s;eized from American &s;hipping bound for France, at the very time, when the Engli&s;h were boa&s;ting that they would &s;tarve her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The plan of &s;tarving the French nation was the mo&s;t diaboli|cal that ever entered into the heart even of an emperor, or a king. It could nor &s;erve to di&s;band French armies, but mu&s;t have had an oppo&s;ite effect.</P>
<P>In 1709, France was ravaged by a terrible famine; and the ranks of their armies were overwhelmed with volunteers; for hunger is an admirable recruiting officer. The very &s;ame circum&s;tance has happened both before and &s;ince. A &s;carcity of provi&s;ions alone would be &s;ufficient to fill the battalions.</P>
<P>The military part of a nation, are always, in the la&s;t re&s;ort, its ma&s;ters. Hence, in a general famine, they are the la&s;t cla&s;s of citizens who feel the extremity of hunger. The fir&s;t part of the French nation which die of it mu&s;t be their old men, women, and children.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h are fond of repre&s;enting their neighbours <HI>as in a &s;tate of &s;tarving.</HI> When they wi&s;h to revile the Welch, the Scotch, the Iri&s;h, or the French, goat-milk chee&s;e, oatmeal, po|tatoes, and frogs are favourite topics. <HI>Time about is fair play,</HI> &s;ays the proverb. Many thou&s;ands of people in England have, &s;ince that &s;cheme of &s;tarving France, died of hunger.</P></NOTE>. In the face
<PB N="242" REF="033485_0241_0FF7216F1C672228">
of &s;uch matters, it is not wonderful that the French are angry.</P>
<P>Mr. Jay's friends reply, that France, by the &s;econd article of the treaty of Paris, was enti|tled to <Q>any particular favour in re&s;pect of com|merce and navigation</Q> that &s;hould be granted by the United States to another nation. Of con|&s;equence, when Jay gave up the right of <HI>free</HI> bot|toms, and of provi&s;ion ve&s;&s;els, to England, the French came to have the &s;ame privilege of &s;topping them. But the twenty-fifth article, above quoted, &s;hews that Jay had really &s;aved the republic, in this point. Yet the exception of the French, as to provi&s;ions, and free bottoms, ought, at &s;o criti|cal a time, to have been fully and fairly named. The de&s;ertion of neutral rights, even in the &s;light|e&s;t way, opened a pretence for abu&s;e.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e between France and America appears to be &s;hortly this. Jay, in his treaty, gave up the principle of free bottoms, with the exception of treaties already made by the United States. This was wrong; yet the twenty-fifth article ought to
<PB N="243" REF="033485_0242_0FF72170B0BD5F08">
have &s;aved France. The Engli&s;h, in reading their copy of the treaty, overleaped this excepting arti|cle, and, ju&s;t as if it never had been written, con|tinued to &s;eize French property on board of Ameri|can ve&s;&s;els, as likewi&s;e American provi&s;ions freight|ed for any part of the republic. When this trea|ty was publi&s;hed in America, the directory were bu&s;y in arranging affairs of intricate complication, and &s;tupendous importance. The recent conque&s;t of Flanders and Holland called for their whole attention. Compared with &s;uch objects, the cap|ture of five hundred ve&s;&s;els, either <HI>by</HI> their ene|mies or <HI>from</HI> them, was a trifle. Be&s;ides, oppo&s;i|tion to Jay's treaty became &s;o violent in America that there was the greate&s;t chance for congre&s;s over&s;etting it, as indeed it e&s;caped in the end on|ly by a &s;ingle vote<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That of Mr. Muhlenberg, in a committee of the whole hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives.</NOTE> out of ninety-&s;even.</P>
<P>In &s;ummer, 1796, a &s;plendid prize was to be contended for in Italy, and till that di&s;pute had been partly decided, the directory did not wi&s;h to entangle them&s;elves in American negociation. Buonaparte, who&s;e name hath &s;ince become &s;ynoni|mous to victory, &s;oon convinced the world what was to be the fate of Lombardy. When the di|rectory perceived the republic to be pro&s;perous on that &s;ide, they of cour&s;e turned their attention to this country. Ob&s;erve the following dates.</P>
<P>Jay's treaty had been &s;igned on the 19th of No|vember, 1794. It was ratified by the &s;enate, on June 24th, 1795, and by Mr. Randolph, as &s;ecretary of &s;tate, on Augu&s;t 14th, 1795. The appropriations for effecting the Briti&s;h treaty were not ageeed to, by the repre&s;enta|tives, till April 30th, 1796. During this whole
<PB N="244" REF="033485_0243_0FF721725CA53C98">
time, the French did not plunder American ve&s;&s;els, unle&s;s in two or three rare in&s;tances, while the Briti&s;h were &s;eizing them by hundreds. That this was the ca&s;e has been a&s;certained in the Hi&s;tory of 1796, which contains a copious ac|count of all captures made by French, or Engli&s;h privateers up to about the end of April. The detail was then &s;u&s;pended from want of room.</P>
<P>This forbearance, on the part of France, from the time that the treaty had been approved by the pre|&s;ident, till appropriations were made for it by con|gre&s;s, was the re&s;ult of honourable and &s;ound poli|cy. By commencing the capture of American &s;hip|ping, while the fate of Jay's treaty was yet unde|cided, they would have been &s;ure to exa&s;perate the people of this country, and run the chance of driv|ing them into a &s;till clo&s;er connection with England. They did not furni&s;h America with any pretence or provocation to quarrel with them, while, at the &s;ame time, they left her to the free operation of her own mind. The republic, during this interval, &s;uf|fered &s;everely by the treaty; for they re&s;pected that of Paris, while the United States permitted Eng|land to break it. The French, agreeably to its &s;ti|pulations, allowed Briti&s;h property to go free, if protected by an American bottom; while the Bri|ti&s;h, in expre&s;s violation of the twenty-fifth and &s;aving article of Jay's treaty, &s;eized French pro|perty in American &s;hipping.</P>
<P>The&s;e are facts inconte&s;tably true; and they place France in the mo&s;t favourable light, when com|pared to Britain. Under very great di&s;advantage, the republic adhered to her treaty of 1778, while England was ince&s;&s;antly violating the one, dictated by her&s;elf, that &s;he had ju&s;t made with Jay. The republic thus acted with &s;trict honour, while Eng|land di&s;played treachery. Yet even this perfidy and
<PB N="245" REF="033485_0244_0FF7217858BF7300">
effrontery had no effect in rou&s;ing America to manly feelings. On the contrary, in &s;pring, 1796, while the treaty was before congre&s;s, and while Briti&s;h captures and impre&s;&s;ments filled every new&s;paper, Me&s;&s;rs. Harper and Tracy &s;tood up in the hou&s;e to deny their exi&s;tence. An artificial caterwauling was, in the meanwhile, excited all over the country, that unle&s;s the United States agreed to Jay's treaty, England would declare war. In vain did Mr. Gal|latin, and others, urge, that, before the appropria|tion for effecting it, England &s;hould be compelled to &s;u&s;pend her piracies. For urging a propo&s;ition &s;o ju&s;t in it&s;elf, and &s;o important to America, they were, in the brutal, paper-jobbing dialect, reproach|ed as pen&s;ioners of France.</P>
<P>The republic, in the unavoidable exerci&s;e of her judgment, could not help de&s;pi&s;ing a people &s;o com|pletely enfeebled by pu&s;illanimity, by &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and by faction. Almo&s;t one half of congre&s;s were &s;o far from wanting to redre&s;s the Briti&s;h injuries com|mitted on their allies, and even on their own con|&s;tituents, that they cen&s;ured every member who wi&s;hed to complain. When the directory &s;aw that the federal faction were entirely victorious; that England continued to &s;eize French property in American bottoms; and that our executive took no effective &s;teps to prevent it; having waited as long as ju&s;tice to their fellow citizens could permit them to wait; they, on July 2d, 1796, pa&s;&s;ed a decree, of which Mr. Pickering gives this ac|count. <Q>It announces, that the conduct of France towards neutrals, will be regulated by the man|ner in which they &s;hould &s;uffer the Engli&s;h to treat them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Me&s;&s;age from the Pre&s;ident, of 22d June, 1797, p. 6.</NOTE>.</Q> If they were to be ruled by that precedent, they could never be at a lo&s;s to vindi|cate
<PB N="246" REF="033485_0245_0FF72179EB0E5AA8">
all &s;orts of crimes. Though the decree was dated July 2d, 1796, it was not, as Mr. Pickering ob&s;erves, <Q>in general operation, until October.</Q> From this account it clearly follows, that French depredations are the con&s;equence of congre&s;s having appropriated for Jay's treaty, with|out making even an attempt to enforce that of Paris, for the protection of French property under the American flag.</P>
<P>The principle laid down in the decree is, in it&s;elf, equitable. It has been followed, on the 2d of March, 1797, by one &s;till more explicit, and which forms No. II. of the documents, already cited, laid before congre&s;s, by Mr. Adams, on June 22d, 1797. An abridgement of the chief articles in the latter edict, will explain the greater part of the pre&s;ent grounds of complaint, which France has again&s;t America, and which are fairly deducible from Jay's unhappy de&s;ertion of the doctrine, that free bottoms make free goods; that a French cargo is &s;afe under the American flag.</P>
<P>The directory begin by quoting a law of May 9th, 1793, of which, the pre&s;ent decree is little more than a &s;econd edition. This law, which had either been long &s;u&s;pended, or, indeed, never exe|cuted, &s;ets out with complaining that the enemies of France violate the flag of neutral powers to her prejudice, and therefore, &s;ays, that &s;he can no longer fulfil, towards tho&s;e neutral powers in general, the wi&s;h that &s;he has con&s;tantly manife&s;ted for the en|tire freedom of commerce and navigation.</P>
<P>The law of 1793, then enjoins, that neutral ve&s;|&s;els may be &s;topt, when the property of an enemy is found on board of them. Thus, if a merchant in London, comes over to Norfolk, in Virginia, buys a quantity of tobacco, and &s;hips it for England, in an American bottom, the cargo will be &s;eizable.
<PB N="247" REF="033485_0246_0FF7217B7AB334D8">
The ve&s;&s;el, however, is to be di&s;charged, as &s;oon as unloaded, and what American property &s;he may contain is al&s;o free. She is to be paid the freight for which &s;he was hired, with a ju&s;t indemnification for the time of her being detained. French tribunals are appointed to determine tho&s;e matters. The law, with equity, adds, that its operations again&s;t neutral bottoms are to cea&s;e, whenever the enemy &s;hall de|clare that they will no longer mole&s;t French pro|perty in the like &s;ituation. All this, with the long forbearance of France, till &s;o late as October, 1796, evidently proves, that the republic was driven into the pre&s;ent attack upon neutral bottoms, by the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of creating a counterbalance to the previous and &s;till continued piracies of Britain.</P>
<P>Having cited this law, the decree next refers to Jay's treaty, and that of Paris. It explains wherein they differ, and in what way they mu&s;t be recon|ciled, in order to &s;ecure an equal advantage to France as to England. The directory quote, in their defence, the &s;econd article of the treaty of Paris, which begins in the&s;e terms.</P>
<P><Q>The mo&s;t chri&s;tian king, and the United States, engage, mutually, not to grant any particular fa|vour to other nations, in re&s;pect of commerce and navigation, which &s;hall not immediately be com|mon to the other party, who &s;hall enjoy the &s;ame favour.</Q></P>
<P>After explaining the nece&s;&s;ity for taking advantage of this &s;tipulation, the decree quotes the &s;eventeenth article of Jay's treaty, and, grounding preci&s;ely on the &s;ame footing, declares, that <HI>free &s;hips are</HI> NOT <HI>to make free cargoes.</HI> It next refers to the eighteenth article, and in like manner extends the li&s;t of contraband goods beyond what was &s;ettled by the treaty of Paris. Jay had admit|ted &s;hip-timber, pitch, tar, hemp, and &s;ome other
<PB N="248" REF="033485_0247_0FF7218085984040">
articles to be &s;eizable, even though American pro|perty. The decree follows up this blow, and ju&s;tice cannot blame it.</P>
<P>Jay, by the twenty-fir&s;t article, con&s;ented, that an American &s;ailor, fighting on board of a French ve&s;&s;el, and taken pri&s;oner by England, &s;hall be treated as a <HI>pirate.</HI> The French decree copies this clau&s;e, and then makes the &s;ame declaration. It farther adds, that an American &s;hall not be permitted to plead <HI>impre&s;&s;ment.</HI> This is hard upon individuals, but as to the United States at large, they never made any &s;erious efforts to hinder Engli&s;h kidnapping. Their negligence cau&s;ed great numbers of Americans to be impre&s;&s;ed, and whether as volunteers, or by compul&s;ion, they are equally effective again&s;t France. Hence the republic is warranted, in her own de|fence, to u&s;e every method for compelling the Uni|ted States to do ju&s;tice to them&s;elves, and to her.</P>
<P>Mr. Pinckney<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Documents, &amp;c. p. 33.</NOTE> &s;ays, that American &s;ailors are at pre&s;ent detained in Bre&s;t, as pri&s;oners of war, and <Q>&s;uffer much by clo&s;e confinement and bad provi&s;ions.</Q> They may thank the mi&s;erable clau&s;e which declared them liable to be con&s;idered as pirates, if they enli&s;ted on board of French &s;hips of war. But for that clau&s;e, the French would have been glad to &s;et them free, and take them into their own &s;ervice. At pre&s;ent, many Ameri|cans are, in &s;pite of the treaty, in the French navy, and the&s;e pri&s;oners in Bre&s;t will be kept mo&s;t likely, as a pledge, in ca&s;e that Barney, or &s;ome other Americans, in the French &s;ervice, &s;hall be captured by the Engli&s;h. Jay has authori&s;ed Gren|ville to hang Barney, and the directory keep ano|ther &s;et of Americans for the halter of retaliation. To &s;uch a climax of independence, re&s;pect, and
<PB N="249" REF="033485_0248_0FF7218213CF9FF0">
dignity, has this country been elevated by the ma&s;terly politics of the federal party. It is im|po&s;&s;ible that we &s;hould e&s;cape the univer&s;al con|tempt of Europe. The &s;ix per cent. cabinet have converted the national character into a &s;ort of po|litical common &s;ewer for the reception of every indignity from every government on earth.</P>
<P>The two decrees of the French directory, of July 2d, 1796, and March 2d, 1797, are evi|dently engrafted on the principles of the Briti&s;h treaty, and mu&s;t be a&s;cribed exclu&s;ively to it. They differ e&s;&s;entially from the bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">aneering proclama|tions of the Briti&s;h king, for the leg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> adjudication of American ve&s;&s;els. They go preci&s;ely as far as the United States already &s;uffered England to go, and not a &s;tep farther. In executing the&s;e French de|crees, many &s;eizures have taken place, which they did not apparently contemplate. Many horrid out|rages have been committed on the property and per&s;ons of Americans; for the crew of a French privateer are compo&s;ed of as coar&s;e materials as tho&s;e of an Engli&s;h one. But the conduct of our government led exactly to &s;uch a &s;ituation. For &s;ome years pa&s;t it has beat up for external indigni|ties. It has &s;ent out riders to take in commi&s;|&s;ions for in&s;ult. Such were tho&s;e factors of de|gradation, Thomas Pinckney and John Jay. <Q>If the treaty is ratified,</Q> &s;aid pre&s;ident Wa&s;hing|ton, <Q>the parti&s;ans of the French, or rather of war and confu&s;ion, will excite them to ho&s;tile mea&s;ures; or at lea&s;t to unfriendly &s;entiments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Randolph p. 37.</NOTE>.</Q> In every word he was mi&s;taken.

<PB N="250" REF="033485_0249_0FF72183D07C3700">
as the obvious con&s;equence of the treaty it&s;elf. It was framed under the au&s;pices of a party in pro|fe&s;&s;ed enmity to France. <Q>The &s;ucce&s;s of the duke of Brun&s;wick was mo&s;t earne&s;tly wi&s;hed for by the principal agents of this ari&s;tocratic and fi&s;cal party, who had not even the decency to conceal their &s;entiments upon the &s;ubject.&mdash; The pul&s;e of the whole party beat in uni&s;on with him, as he advanced towards Paris, and with him they were covered with &s;hame and mortification as he retreated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An Examination of the late Proceedings in Congre&s;s, &amp;c. p. 23.</NOTE>.</Q> Yet, with their u&s;ual &s;incerity, they affect to date their dread of France from the arrival of Genet, about eight months after.</P>
<P>This explanation has been &s;omewhat long, but it accounts for the pre&s;ent conduct of the French. It &s;hews that they have received atrocious provo|cation; that they bore it for a con&s;iderable time, with patience, till they &s;aw that no redre&s;s was to be expected. They are now acting, from hone&s;t re&s;entment, what England did from wanton in&s;o|lence. This is the real di&s;tinction between the pi|racies of the two nations. When a man becomes both judge and avenger in his own cau&s;e, he is apt not only to get ju&s;tice, but &s;omething more than ju&s;tice. This is, no doubt, the way with the French; but for the original mi&s;chief, we are to blame &s;uch legi&s;lators as Harri&s;on Otis, to who&s;e harangue we are now to return.</P>
<P><Q>Where, &s;aid Mr. Otis, are your &s;ailors?

the federal party were troubled with an invincible deafne&s;s. But whenever the French begin to offend in the &s;ame way, they become quick of hearing.</P>
<P>Mr. Otis <Q><HI>defied</HI> the ingenuity of any gentle|man to draw a compari&s;on between the di|rectory and the Briti&s;h parliament, to the ad|vantage of the former; and <HI>in&s;i&s;ted</HI> that the de|mands of Charles de la Croix were upon a para|lel with tho&s;e of lord North.</Q> If the orator means to compare the parliament of 1775, with the pre|&s;ent directory, or to &s;ay that the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of Pinck|ney amounts to another Bo&s;ton port bill, he com|mits a gro&s;s violation of truth. Incendiaries, like Mr. Otis, have hurried this country into a &s;eries of mea&s;ures offen&s;ive to France, and previou&s;ly de&s;ign|ed to be &s;o. America mu&s;t now retrace her &s;teps. If La Croix had &s;ent forty thou&s;and men to invade this continent, there would be &s;ome meaning in the defi|ance of Mr. Otis. But now, it is the challenge of ig|norance, debility, and impo&s;ture.</P>
<P><Q>There was a time when he (Mr. Otis) was ani|mated with enthu&s;ia&s;m in favour of the French revolution, and he cheri&s;hed it, while civil liberty appeared to be the object; but he now con&s;idered that revolution as completely atchieved, and that the war was continued, not for liberty, but for conque&s;t and aggrandizement, to which he did not believe it was <HI>the intere&s;t of this country to contribute.</HI></Q></P>

between the directory and the council of five hundred, induced Malme&s;bury, as the French affirm, to retard, for &s;ome time, his &s;econd nego|ciation.

Mr. Harper has not received the education, nor does he po&s;&s;e&s;s the feelings of a gentleman; otherwi&s;e this bur&s;t of vulgarity could not have e&s;caped from his lips. Behold the being that hi&s;&s;es at the Cor&s;i|can hero!</P>
<P>After &s;uch doings, Mr. Harper and his party pretend to be angry at the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of Pinckney. Put the ca&s;e that Barras had granted him an audi|ence, and had &s;poke as follows. <Q>Your pre&s;ident is an old doating fool. His head is turned with his elevation. He &s;uffers him&s;elf to be led by the no&s;e by a circle of a&s;&s;ociates in the pay of Britain. But unle&s;s he and his congre&s;s chu&s;e to correct their &s;tile, the republican navy &s;hall lay New-York and Philadelphia as flat as the floor that you <HI>&s;tand</HI> on.</Q> Such a harrangue would not be more brutal or in&s;olent than the menace which Harper has thrown out of conquering the Spani&s;h colonies. Pluck out the <HI>beam</HI> before you &s;eek for the <HI>mote.</HI></P>
<P>The words of this legi&s;lative luminary were taken down, and publi&s;hed a few days after, in the Merchant's Adverti&s;er, as a part of his &s;peech. By this time he had begun to be a&s;hamed of it. He
<PB N="257" REF="033485_0256_0FF721996CA7E280">
went to Mr. Bradford's office, made a con&s;idera|ble noi&s;e, and obtained admi&s;&s;ion for a <HI>corrected</HI> co|py of his harangue. It appeared, for the &s;econd time, on the 10th of June. Mr. Harper therein only &s;ays, that Buonaparte was <Q>a great man, tru|ly qualified to be the in&s;trument of &s;uch oppre&s;|&s;ion.</Q> He afterwards printed a third edition of it, in three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive numbers of another new&s;pa|per, wherein it &s;welled to the incredible bulk of &s;even folio pages. It is hard to believe that one half of this matter was ever pronounced in the hou&s;e, for they &s;it only four or five hours.</P>
<P>We &s;hall here conclude this imperfect glance at the debates on the pre&s;ident's &s;peech. The repre|&s;entatives did not get their addre&s;s ready, till the &s;econd of June. They had met on the 15th of May, heard the oration on the 16th, and had tugged for &s;ixteen days inclu&s;ive, from the 17th, to the 2d of June following. The amendment of Mr. Nicholas was rejected. All the pa&s;&s;ages, quoted in the out&s;et of this &s;ketch, were retained. The yeas and nays were called over &s;even times. The addre&s;s finally pa&s;t, by &s;ixty-two votes again&s;t thirty-&s;ix; and, with admirable con&s;i&s;tency, cen&s;ured the directory, for gently hinting to Monroe, that we are a divided people. This paper affirmed, al&s;o, that <Q>the con|duct of the government has been <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>impar|tial</HI> to foreign nations.</Q> The affirmation is uni|ver&s;ally known to be fal&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among other glaring in&s;tances of partiality, ob&s;erve the fol|lowing. France and England are at war. Government permits the latter, unmole&s;ted, to pre&s;s our &s;eamen. At the &s;ame time we agree to a treaty forbidding them to enter into French &s;ervice. Be&s;ides that the French are greatly in want of able &s;ailors, an American, by &s;peaking the Engli&s;h language, and being acquainted with the &s;ea|man&s;hip of that people, would be of peculiar u&s;e in a French privateer.</NOTE>; and as &s;uch, had been con&s;tantly contradicted by the republican &s;ide of the hou&s;e. The &s;e&s;&s;ion ended on July 5th, 1797, hav|ing
<PB N="258" REF="033485_0257_0FF7219C85208000">
la&s;ted exactly fifty-two days. Of the&s;e, &s;ixteen were &s;pent upon an an&s;wer to the pre&s;ident. The whole charge of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, by an account given in, was about eighty thou&s;and dollars, or fifteen hun|dred and thirty eight dollars, and a fraction, per day. Thus the addre&s;s required twenty-four thou|&s;and &s;ix hundred dollars worth of time, and amount|ted, in the judgment of the minority, to a decla|ration of war again&s;t France. The journal of the whole &s;e&s;&s;ion forms but an hundred and forty pages. The reply of Mr. Adams to this addre&s;s, ends on the forty-fourth.</P>
<P>So much bu&s;tle about a pre&s;ident's &s;peech, evi|dently &s;hews that we are ambitious of po&s;ting to|wards monarchy. Speaking of the late birth day of general Wa&s;hington, a federal new&s;paper has the&s;e words.&mdash;<Q>Two public companies, and many pri|vate parties, ob&s;erved this POLITICAL CHRIST|MAS, and HALLOWED it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aurora, 7th March, 1797.</NOTE>!</Q> It is believed that no Engli&s;h print was ever polluted with &s;uch abject profanation. Mr. Adams was not contented with &s;colding at France. He hath &s;ince been inveighing again&s;t tho&s;e who di&s;approve his conduct. He was angry at Barras for attempting, as he alledged, to &s;eparate the people from their government. He now declares, that &s;uch a project has actually been fram|ed in the United States; and that it has <HI>a high pro|bability of &s;ucce&s;s!</HI> The particulars are thus.</P>
<P>On Augu&s;t 7th, 1797, Mr. Adams dined at Fa|nueil Hall, in Bo&s;ton, with two hundred and fifty of his fellow citizens. An addre&s;s was pre&s;ented to him, which has this pa&s;&s;age. <Q>When dome&s;tic <HI>fac|tion</HI> appears to have con&s;pired with foreign in|trigue, to de&s;troy the peace of our country; when our con&s;tituted authorities are reviled and in&s;ul|ted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The greate&s;t in&s;ult was that on the repre&s;entatives, of their not being at liberty to give an opinion to the pre&s;ident for or again&s;t a rupture with France.</NOTE>;
<PB N="259" REF="033485_0258_0FF7219E1871FAF8">
and the mo&s;t <HI>daring</HI> attempts to &s;eparate the people from their government are openly made and avowed; at &s;uch a cri&s;is we are excited, no le&s;s by our inclination than our duty, to re|probate,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>To this yell of malice and &s;tupidity, the pre&s;i|dent made a mo&s;t gracious reply. The addre&s;s had <HI>fourteen</HI> lines upon faction. Mr. Adams rung the changes through forty-eight. <Q>I cannot," &s;ays he, but be of the opinion, that the profligate &s;pirit of fal&s;ehood and malignity, which has appeared in &s;ome, and the unguarded di&s;po&s;ition in others to encourage it, are &s;erious evils, and bear a threat|ening a&s;pect upon the union of the &s;tates, their con&s;titution of government, and the moral cha|racter of the nation.</Q></P>
<P>Thus hath our pre&s;ident proclaimed his re&s;ent|ment becau&s;e a minority of congre&s;s were unwil|ling to embark in his French war. He &s;eems to ju&s;tify an ob&s;ervation made by Mr. Paine. <Q>I have always," &s;ays he, "been oppo&s;ed to the mode of refining government up to an individual, or what is called a &s;ingle executive. Such a man will al|ways be <HI>the chief of a party.</HI> A plurality is far better. It combines the ma&s;s of a nation better together; and, be&s;ides this, it is nece&s;&s;ary to the manly mind of a republic, that it lo&s;es the deba&s;|ing idea of obeying an individual<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Paine to Wa&s;hington, p. 5.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives have always po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed a number of men, equal to Mr. Adams. Nothing but the &s;pirit of &s;ervility would excite &s;uch a noi&s;e about his &s;peech. The debate on mak|ing an an&s;wer to it produced a dozen &s;peeches equal
<PB N="260" REF="033485_0259_0FF721A0A10074B0">
to his. But then Mr. Adams has the right of appointment to many &s;nug places, with an annual &s;inecure to him&s;elf of twenty-five thou|&s;and dollars. The&s;e be thy gods O I&s;rael! But for his high &s;alary, and his unbounded patronage, an an&s;wer to a pre&s;ident's &s;peech would be very con|ci&s;e, and the debates upon it very cool.</P>
<P>If the change to a quintuple directory can be accompli&s;hed, without intermediate mi&s;chief, it may be as well for America if Mr. Adams &s;hall be her la&s;t pre&s;ident. This remark is not levelled at the gen|tleman, but the office. Matters have come to &s;uch a height that Mr. Jeffer&s;on, if cho&s;en at the next election, will, perhaps, be forced to take refuge in his party. They can hardly commit as much harm as their predece&s;&s;ors have done. The certificates are funded. The bank government is e&s;tabli&s;hed. Yet, after all, democratical a&s;cendency will &s;till be, mo&s;t likely, but the domination of a party. A native citizen of the county of Philadelphia, of the fir&s;t cla&s;s, both in point of information and of fortune, was a&s;ked, during the late pre&s;idential canva&s;s, whe|ther he preferred Adams or Jeffer&s;on. <Q>I wi&s;h for the latter, he replied, as, by far, mo&s;t likely to keep us out of a French war. But I would rather &s;ee a &s;tick of wood in the chair than either of the candidates. The very bu&s;tle that you make about this election proves that your con&s;titution is a monarchy. A pure republic will re&s;t nothing upon the choice of a &s;ingle man.</Q></P>
<P>The an&s;wer to the &s;peech &s;hould be circum&s;cri|bed to a verbal me&s;&s;age: and congre&s;s ought to give up the cu&s;tom of vi&s;iting a pre&s;ident at his levees, and on his birth day. A gradual extinc|tion &s;hould be promoted of that ful&s;ome &s;tile with which, for the&s;e nine years, our pre&s;idents have been addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="033485_0260_0FF721A460C26210">In his an&s;wer to the Bo&s;ton addre&s;s, Mr. Adams &s;peaks of <Q>a threatening a&s;pect upon <HI>the union</HI> of the &s;tates.</Q> The &s;tronge&s;t a&s;pect of that kind appears in Connecticut. On December 23d, 1796, there was di&s;tributed to the a&s;&s;embly of Penn&s;yl|vania, a pamphlet, entitled, <HI>Papers Re&s;pecting in|tru&s;ions by Connecticut Claimants.</HI> It begins with a circular letter of April 16th, 1796, from the go|vernor of this &s;tate to tho&s;e of New-Jer&s;ey, New-York, Rhode-I&s;land, Connecticut, and Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts. This inclo&s;ed the copy of a proclamation, i&s;&s;ued by him, at the in&s;tance of the a&s;&s;embly, for preventing intru&s;ions. A reque&s;t was &s;ubjoined that it might be publi&s;hed in their re&s;pective &s;tates; and, that if any attempts were made to emigrate into Penn&s;ylvania, they might be oppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve the various reception that this letter met with from the&s;e five governors. As New-York has a &s;imilar quarrel with Connecticut, Mr. Jay not only publi&s;hed the Penn&s;ylvanian manife&s;to, but &s;uperadded another of his own. New-Jer&s;ey and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts have no &s;uch intere&s;t in the cau&s;e, and in the&s;e two &s;tates it was &s;ent to the new&s;papers, without &s;uch an appendage. Rhode-I&s;land, influen|ced by its Connecticut neighbours, appears to have done nothing at all. The governor of Connecticut declined per&s;onal agency in printing the proclama|tion, but, with an obliging an&s;wer, laid it before the two branches of the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>From the other papers we learn, that, early in May, 1796, a land &s;urveyor, from Connecticut, and four a&s;&s;i&s;tants, were on the Penn&s;ylvania line, near the one hundred and twenty-nine mile &s;tone. They de&s;igned to run off &s;ix town&s;hips within this &s;tate. A letter from Lycoming county, of June 18th, 1796, informed, that there were five &s;etts of &s;urveyors on the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s. On June 22d, a committee of
<PB N="262" REF="033485_0261_0FF721A6EA48D440">
that county was held to counteract the invaders. In a letter of July 6th, to the governor, the committee write thus. <Q>We have further been informed, that, &s;ome few days &s;ince, a party, of fifteen or twenty men, were &s;een, <HI>well armed with rifles,</HI> and equipped, proceeding on into the country up the Cawane&s;que, in the neighbourhood of the &s;tate line; and that a party of fifteen &s;urveyors, with their hands, were to &s;et out from about the mouth of Tioga river, to &s;urvey in the &s;ame coun|try. General report &s;ays, that this proceeding has taken place, &s;ince a council was re&s;olved upon and holden at Tioga point, <HI>in con&s;equence of your excellency's proclamation being &s;ent into that coun|try.</HI> We are a&s;&s;ured, that they are in numerous parties, throughout the northern parts of this country, and we apprehend that they expect re&s;i&s;tance to their intru&s;ions. We are decidedly of opinion, that a civil magi&s;trate, unprotected by an armed force, would be in imminent danger in attempting to arre&s;t any of the intruders.</Q> Mea&s;ures were taken to repel them, and their pro|ject was, for that time, &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>Here we &s;ee, that a party of armed men entered Penn&s;ylvania, with a purpo&s;e to re&s;i&s;t the governor's proclamation. Granting their claim to be well founded, it ought not to be &s;upported by rifles. A &s;imilar conduct in other di&s;putes about land, would fill the continent with carnage. A purcha&s;er, jo&s;t|led out of his farm, has only to charge his gun, and level at his enemy. This precedent is the mo&s;t alarming, the mo&s;t antifederal, that can well be imagined. It came from a body of people firmly devoted to Mr. Adams. If any other &s;tate had inva|ded Connecticut with a detachment of men in arms the whole union would have rung with reproaches, from Trumball, Web&s;ter, and the re&s;t of her lite|rati.
<PB N="263" REF="033485_0262_0FF721A8D6611488">
The de&s;ign was dropt from dread of a &s;uperior force, but will, it is likely, be renewed with the fir&s;t opportunity. Our pre&s;ident may point out, if he can, what other &s;tate entertains any plans which are half &s;o dangerous to the general peace. If go|vernor Mi&s;&s;lin had refu&s;ed to publi&s;h a proclamation again&s;t the we&s;tern in&s;urgents, he would have be|haved preci&s;ely as the governor of Connecticut did, in the affair of the Su&s;quehanna company.</P>
