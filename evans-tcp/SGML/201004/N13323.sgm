<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY FRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT the greatne&s;s and pro&s;perity of a people depend upon the proportion of public &s;pirit and the love of virtue, which is found to exi&s;t among them, &s;eems to be a maxim e&s;tabli&s;hed by the univer&s;al con&s;ent and I may &s;ay experience of all ages.</P>
<P>MAN is formed with a con&s;titution wonderfully adapted for &s;ocial conver&s;e and connection. Scarcely u&s;hered into the world, but his wants teach him his inability, of him&s;elf, to provide for them. Wrapt in a&s;toni&s;hment, with an anxiety inexpre&s;&s;ible, the &s;olitary exi&s;tant looks around for the aid of &s;ome friendly neigh|bour,
<PB N="6" REF="016836_0005_0F9EC000E82EBA58">and &s;hould he perchance meet the de&s;ired object; &s;hould he find one, endowed with intellectual faculties, be&s;et with the &s;ame wants and weakne&s;&s;es, and in all re&s;pects the very image of him&s;elf; &s;hould he find him with a heart open to mutual kind offi|ces, and a hand &s;tretched out to be&s;tow a proportion of his labour, with a bo&s;om glowing with gratitude, his &s;oul is on the wing to expre&s;s the &s;en&s;e he entertains of the generous obligation.</P>
<P>A CONFIDENCE is e&s;tabli&s;hed between him and his benefactor, they &s;wear perpetual friend&s;hip, and a compact for mutual pro|tection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance becomes imperceptably con&s;ented to. Thus doubly armed, together they pur&s;ue their morning rout to &s;atisfy tho&s;e demands only which nature reminds them of, and while the ingenuity of the one is exerci&s;ed to en&s;nare, the &s;trength of the other is perhaps employed to &s;ubdue their vigorous opponent.</P>
<P>THEIR little family &s;oon encrea&s;es, and as their &s;ocial ring becomes gradully enlarged, their obligations to each other are equally circular. Hone&s;t indu&s;try early teaches them that a part only is &s;ufficient to provide for the whole, and that a portion of their time may be &s;pared to cull the conveniences as well as ap|pea&s;e the wants of nature. Property and per&s;onal &s;ecurity appear to be among the fir&s;t objects of their attention, and acknowledged merit receives the unanimous &s;uffrage to pre&s;ide guardian over the rights and priveledges of their infant &s;ociety. The advantages de|rived are in a moment experienced. Their little policy, erected
<PB N="7" REF="016836_0006_0F9EC0017A897558">upon the broad ba&s;is of equality, they know of no &s;uperiorty but that which virtue and the love of the whole demands; and while with chearfulne&s;s they entru&s;t to his care a certain part of their natural rights, to &s;ecure the remainder, the agreement is mutual, and the obligation upon his part equally &s;olemn and binding to re|&s;ign them back, either at the in&s;tance and reque&s;t of their &s;overeign plea&s;ure, or when&s;oever the end &s;hould be perverted for which he received them.</P>
<P>INTEGRITY of heart, benevolence of di&s;po&s;ition, the love of freedom and public &s;pirit, are con&s;picuous excellencies in this &s;elect neighbourhood. Lawle&s;s ambition is without a friend, and the in|&s;inuating profe&s;&s;ional pleas of tyrants, ever accompanied by the magnificence and &s;plendor

The indu&s;try of the citizen will receive encouragement and magnanimity; heroi&s;m and benevolence will be e&s;teemed the admired qualifications of the age.

PATRIOTISM is a virtue which will ever be univer&s;ally admir|ed, even by tho&s;e incapable of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it. Its happy effects are equally vi&s;ible in individuals as in States, and if we be&s;tow a mo|ments reflection upon the heroes of antiquity, who have been de|&s;ervedly celebrated by &s;ucceeding generations, both for their abili|ties and conduct, we &s;hall find that the true &s;ource of their great|ne&s;s was this &s;pirit of freedom, and their inviolable attachment to the intere&s;t of their country.</P>
<P>WITH an attentive &s;ilence we li&s;ten to the hi&s;torian while he re|lates to us the integrity of conduct, the invincible courage, the earne&s;t glow of &s;oul, and the ardent love of liberty which was ex|hibited in the lives of tho&s;e illu&s;trious men, and &s;o great were their virtues that we are &s;carce able to credit them, but as the dreams of fancy, or the fictions of the ingenious.</P>
<P>IT is recorded of the celebrated
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rollin.</HI></NOTE> Timoleon, general of Corinth, that notwith&s;tanding he was ble&s;t with a temper &s;ingularly humane, and with feelings that were ever rou&s;ed at the mi&s;eries of his fellow|men, he loved his country &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately, that after making u&s;e of every argument in his power to convince an older brother of his error, for attempting to become the tyrant of it, be devoted him to death; a brother on whom he had previou&s;ly placed his affection, and who&s;e life being expo&s;ed to the fire of an enemy in a &s;evere battle, be had before &s;aved at the great ri&s;que of his own.

No, but fired with a generous glow of &s;oul, fired with the manly &s;entiments of freedom, with an im|placable hatred to oppre&s;&s;ion of all kinds, he marches his troops to the deliverance of this afflicted people, and with a firmne&s;s becom|ing &s;oldiers, fighting under the &s;tandard of liberty, after a &s;eries of fatigue and toil, harra&s;&s;ing marches and fierce conflicts, he de|thrones the tyrant, and is proclaimed the deliverer of Syracu&s;e.&mdash; Having re&s;tored tranquility to this unhappy country, repeopled their cities, revived their laws, and di&s;pen&s;ed ju&s;tice to all ranks and cla&s;&s;es, he re&s;igned his command, and retreated once again to the private walks of life, accompanied with the greatful acknow|ledgments of millions as the patron of their liberty and the &s;aviour

By an affluent fortune placed beyond the reach of poverty or dependence, ble&s;s'd with the &s;ocial circle of friends, and happily connected by yet more endearing ties; peaceful reflections are his companions through the day, and the &s;oothing &s;lumbers of innocence hover over his couch: Charity pre&s;ides &s;teward of his hou&s;hold, and the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed are ever &s;ure to receive from his bo&s;om that &s;igh which never fails to con&s;ole, and from his cheek the al|leviating tear of &s;ympathy. Having reached the &s;ummit of human felicity beyond even the picture of his mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations, it is indifferent to him as an individual, whether prince or people

<P>SUCH is the progre&s;s of public &s;pirit and the love of virtue, and it is the only pillar, upon which can &s;afely be erected the happine&s;s of mankind. Without &s;ome play of the &s;ocial affections in every &s;ociety, without &s;ome barrier to oppo&s;e the &s;tormy pa&s;&s;ions of in|dividuals, without &s;ome general attachment to the public welfare, a door is open to ambition and political corruption,

<P>O MY countrymen, it is the want of patrioti&s;m, that we are at this time called to weep over the wanton ma&s;&s;acre of innocent men; that this is not the only hou&s;e of mourning; that the fields of America have become devoted to war, and &s;cenes of &s;laughter familiar to her &s;ons; that our oppre&s;&s;ors yet per&s;i&s;t in their de&s;tructive &s;y&s;tem of tyranny, and if their power was equal to their thri&s;t of blood, with the &s;pirit of ambition by which they are now di|rected, would lead them to de&s;troy and extirpate the whole human race. But thanks be to Heaven, that by the force of tho&s;e virtues which they have di&s;carded, we have nobly re&s;i&s;ted the attempts of the&s;e cruel men, and the mi&s;eries they have &s;o profu&s;ely dealt out to us, are returning with additional vengeance upon their own heads. The danger of the i&s;&s;ue is now pa&s;t, and if we but retain the &s;ame patriotick ardor, with which we fir&s;t defended our rights from the gra&s;p of our enemies, they are every day in our power. We have every thing to hope; they on the other hand have every thing to &s;ear. Youth, vigor and the invincible arm of ju&s;tice are on our &s;ide:&mdash;The genius of liberty al&s;o is our advocate, who though per&s;ecuted, hath never been conquered.</P>

IN our day we are called to &s;ee a happy country laid wa&s;te at the &s;hrine of ambition; to experience tho&s;e &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s which hi&s;tory is filled with, but experience rivetts it's le&s;&s;ons upon the mind, and if we re&s;olve with deliberation, and execute with vigor, we may yet be a free and flouri&s;hing people. Repine not too much at the ravages of war, nor murmur at the di&s;pen&s;ations of Provi|dence. We oftentimes rate our ble&s;&s;ings in proportion to the dif|ficulty of attaining them, and if without a &s;truggle we had &s;ecured our liberties, perhaps we &s;hould have been le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of their valor. Cha&s;ti&s;ements in youth are not without their advantages. Ble&s;&s;ings mo&s;t commonly &s;pring from them in old age. They lead us to reflect &s;eriou&s;ly in the hour of retirement, and to cheri&s;h tho&s;e qualifications, which are frequently lo&s;t in the glare of pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>THE important prophecy is nearly accompli&s;hed. The ri&s;ing glory of this we&s;tern hemi&s;phere is already announced, and &s;he is &s;ummoned to her &s;eat among the nations. We have publicly de|clared our&s;elves convinced of the de&s;tructive tendency of &s;tanding armies: We have acknowledged the nece&s;&s;ity of public &s;pirit and the love of virtue, to the happine&s;s of any people, and we profe&s;s to be &s;en&s;ible of the great ble&s;&s;ings that flow from them. Let us not then act unworthy of the reputable character we now &s;u&s;tain&punc; Like the nation we have abandoned, be content with freedom in form and tyranny in &s;ub&s;tance, profe&s;s virtue and practice vice, and convince an attentive world that in this glorious &s;truggle for our lives and properties, the only men capable of prizing &s;uch exalted priviledges, were an illu&s;trious &s;et of heroes, who have &s;eal'd their

<P>LET us therefore be &s;till vigilant over our enemies.&mdash;In&s;till into our armies the righteous cau&s;e they protect and &s;upport, and let not the &s;oldier and citizen be di&s;tinct characters among us. By our conduct let us convince them,
