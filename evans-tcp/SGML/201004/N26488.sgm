<P>THE exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s of Hemp, the little interference of its culture with the other work of farmers in America; and <HI>when water-rotted,</HI> the ea&s;e with which it is produced and prepared for <HI>rope,</HI> as well as the general certainty of the crop with a good price, led me to admire it in preference to other uncommon articles of crop.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My Hemp Harve&s;ts at Wye in Maryland, were always after tho&s;e of wheat, and before &s;eeding winter grain. In England they interfere with the grain harve&s;ts.

In America, Hemp and Flax are commonly <HI>dry</HI> before they are &s;pead to be dew rotted. If &s;pread before the la&s;t of September, they become &s;un-burnt, red, har&s;h, and dead.</NOTE></P>
<P>Much is &s;aid of the cultivation of Hemp; and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e appears a con&s;iderable variety in the modes of management<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> My practice was &s;imple. Ground, level and rather low, not wet, and a mellow <HI>loam,</HI> whether of the &s;andy or clayey &s;orts, was preferred. The&s;e &s;oils are not cold; and when well cleaned and prepared by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> plowings and a due quantity of manure, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> are in condition to yield <HI>many repeated
<PB N="2" REF="035217_0002_1002106BACD01390" MS="y">crops</HI> of Hemp; a little manure being now and then added.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Young &s;peaks of a piece of ground at Hoxne in Suffolk, England, which has been under crops of Hemp for <HI>&s;eventy &s;uce&s;&s;ive years.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Farmers without experience, if not al&s;o without thought on the &s;ubject, &s;ay their lands will not bring Hemp. Mo&s;t kinds of &s;oil will yield good crops of it, if not wet. If poor, manure them. Every hu&s;bandman can manu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and cultivate land enough for giving him rich <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ops of Hemp. The plowings for reducing ground to a mellow garden-like &s;tate &s;hould be many, preceding the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;owing. Every time that young weeds appear, plow them in re|peatedly. When the ground is thus well cleared of the &s;eeds of weeds, then &s;ow Hemp-&s;eed, and repeat it year after year on the &s;ame ground; giving it a little manure and <HI>two autumnal plowings;</HI> and the like plowings with harrowings in the next &s;pring, imme|diately before &s;owing. If to cultivate an acre thus highly &s;hould deter the farmer, let him at fir&s;t try a fourth of it; which would give him more than he would want of traces, leading lines and other rope. The &s;pinning and working of it up would be mere play: but, as is &s;een below, making as much Hemp as he can for market, would yield him a good income.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> planter thinks nothing of cultivating twenty acres in tobacco, and erecting, four or five large framed hou&s;es for curing it. But he would &s;tart at a propo&s;al that in&s;tead of Tobacco he &s;hould cultivate the 20 acres in Hemp, altho' it would require but one &s;uch hou&s;e, not an eighth of the labour and attentions, and is without any of the uncer|tainty. It is a common mi&s;take that Hemp requires low ground or rich bottom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. Almo&s;t any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> land that is not wet, may be made to yield good crops.</NOTE></P>
<P>April, when the ground is moi&s;t, clean and mel|low, in garden-like condition from plowings and harrowings is the time for &s;owing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> The
<PB N="3" REF="035217_0003_1002106D48740C18" MS="y">plants then &s;oon appear, and rapidly cover and &s;hel|ter the whole &s;urface of the ground; whereby we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds are kept under, and exhalation is greatly prevented My Hemp never &s;uffered materially from drought but once, and that of a &s;owing in May. It was never found nece&s;&s;ary to weed what was &s;owed for a crop: but only &s;uch as was &s;own thin for producing &s;eed. Sometimes &s;eed was &s;aved from the margin of the field, where the plants had room to branch and were coar&s;e.</P>
<P>When the male or impregnating plants &s;hewed maturity by &s;ome change in the colour, and by the farina or du&s;t flying off from the blo&s;&s;oms, all was pulled up, both male and female: and the pulling of every day was put into a &s;alt water cove, in the evening of the &s;ame day, bound up in &s;mall bundles, and &s;unk 4&frac12; feet in the water, in a thick &s;quare bed. On the third day it was in&s;pected; and from the third to the fifth it was enough rotted, as it is called. In examining it, with finger and thumb &s;ome of the roots were broke. If they bent or were tough, it was not enough: when they &s;napt off &s;hort like gla&s;s, it was enough: but the bark al&s;o was tried. The Hemp was then taken out of the water, and the heads laid &s;loping down to drain 'till morning; for it was u&s;ually taken out in the evening. In the morning it was &s;pread, and whil&s;t drying once turned. In a few
<PB N="4" REF="035217_0004_1002106EDFF390C0" MS="y">fair days it was dry, and then carted to an old tobacco hou&s;e, where it was bulked up 'till the hurry of &s;e|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ops was over. It was broke and &s;wingled in the next winter. Some of it was made into ropes for my farms; the re&s;t &s;old to rope-makers, from the &s;wingle. The rope was bright and &s;trong, and &s;aid to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of a quality enti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ling it to the bounty then offered for <HI>water-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed</HI> Hemp.</P>
<P>A &s;mall part of one of my crops of Hemp was <HI>dea</HI> rotted: which was &s;ufficiently di&s;gui&s;ting to forbid a repetition or that mode. It was a redious while on the ground. Winds blew it about and entangled it. It rotted partially: not the whole of the &s;ame fibre alike. Here it was &s;trong: there weak.</P>
<P>Where there is only a &s;tream of water, it might be proper not to place the Hemp <HI>in</HI> the &s;tream; but, digging a deep oblong receptacle, let a &s;ufficiency of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pa&s;s through it, when full, on one &s;ide of the natural current. There rot the Hemp in clean water; which &s;hould con&s;tantly be coming into and pa&s;&s;ing through the pit, in a degree of plenty for pre&s;erving the water from corrupting or being &s;tag|nant: but not &s;o rapidly as to fret off its bark.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The operation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> called <HI>rotting</HI> of Hemp, ought to avoid every tendency to <HI>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t</HI> or <HI>forment</HI> the plant. Water when pate and lively does not <HI>rot,</HI> but it <HI>di&s;&s;elves</HI> a vi&s;cous gummy &s;ub&s;tance which had bound the fibres of the bark together and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the body of the plant. The pur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t water is the be&s;t <HI>di&s;&s;el|vent</HI> of &s;uch vi&s;cous &s;ub&s;tances. I have &s;een Hemp which had been rotted in &s;tagnant dirty water; the appearance whereof was bad. The Hemp I rotted in clear tide-water, had a light <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">raw colour.</NOTE></P>
<P>After pulling the Hemp, weeds grew up: which
<PB N="5" REF="035217_0005_1002107089032CB8" MS="y">were reduced, and the ground was left in clean con|dition 'till the &s;pring, by plowings.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aving no minute of the quantity of &s;eed &s;own, I can only recommend what &s;eems be&s;t. But, it greatly depends on the &s;late of the ground, and the purpo&s;es for which the crop is intended. A little experience will a&s;certain the proper quantity. Two bu&s;hels of &s;eed to an acre, I believe are a full portion for rope. A little le&s;s might be about the quantity I &s;owed. It is &s;aid in a publication by the Bo&s;ton Committee of Agriculture, that in the common me|thod of &s;owing by broad ca&s;t, "not le&s;s than three bu&s;hels are u&s;ually &s;owed, and &s;ometimes more, ac|cording to the richne&s;s of the &s;oil." They &s;ow a great deal in New England for making <HI>linens,</HI> e&s;pe|cially <HI>&s;ail-cloth,</HI> as well as for <HI>ropes.</HI></P>
<P>If the ground be good and well prepared, no crop is more certain than Hemp &s;owed in time and when the &s;oil is moi&s;t. But, how uncertain is the tobacco crop! Failure of plants from fro&s;t, drought, or fly; want of &s;ea&s;onable weather for planting; web-worm, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, horn-worm; buttening low, for want of rain: curling or frenching, from too much rain; hou&s;e-burning or &s;unking whil&s;t cur|ing; fro&s;t before hou&s;ed; heating in bulk or in the hog&s;head; in&s;pection, culling, &amp;c. Cultivating to|bacco cleans, but expo&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;oil to exhalation and wa&s;hing away. It is only about a month that it &s;hel|ters the ground: but Hemp &s;hades it from May 'till about the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t; and from early Augu&s;t it would be advantageou&s;ly &s;heltered with a growth of buckwheat, 'till this blo&s;&s;oms; and then during a temperate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of heat, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> plowed in as a manure.
<PB N="6" REF="035217_0006_1002108454AB4668" MS="y">Buckwheat mu&s;t not run to <HI>&s;eed</HI> on ground to be &s;own with Hemp. I have had it &s;pireing up and contend|ing with growing Hemp, 'till the buck has been five feet high.</P>
<P>The heavie&s;t work in procuring Hemp, is the <HI>breaking</HI> and &s;cutching or &s;wingling it. But as it is the work of lei&s;ure winter, and every per&s;on who &s;trips Tobacco can break and &s;wingle Hemp: and moreover as hirelings, if nece&s;&s;ary, are in that &s;ea&s;on ea&s;ily obtained, this bugbear part of the bu&s;ine&s;s can a&s;&s;uredly be accompli&s;hed, and the Hemp got rid of at market in the &s;pring.</P>
<P>A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> planter gaining 20 hog&s;heads of tobacco from 20 acres of ground, value 800 dollars, might expect 12000 or 16000 lbs. of Hemp from the &s;ame ground, value 1000 or 1200 dollars. But, if the in|come from the Hemp &s;hould be a fourth le&s;s than from the tobacco crop, yet I would, on &s;everal ac|counts, prefer the hemp culture.</P>
<P>For the country hou&s;e-wife who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> in|formation, the following is in&s;erted as what I have read of a method of <HI>&s;oftning</HI> and <HI>preparing</HI> Hemp, for naking it into linen. The Hemp is laid at full length in a kettle. If the kettle is too &s;mall to admit it at full length, the Hemp may be doubled, but without twi&s;ting it; only the &s;mall end of every hand is twi&s;ted a little, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eep the hands whole, and from tangling. Smooth &s;ticks are laid in the bottom of the kettle, acro&s;s and acro&s;s three or four layers, according to the &s;ize and depth of the kettle; which is for keeping the Hemp from touching the liquor. Then pour lie of middling &s;trength, half the &s;trength of that for &s;oap, gently into the ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> 'till it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es
<PB N="7" REF="035217_0007_10021074AF81A2E8">nearly to the tops of the &s;ticks. The Hemp is then laid in, layer cro&s;&s;ing layer, &s;o that the &s;team may pa&s;s through the whole body of the Hemp. The kettle is now covered clo&s;e as can be, and hung over a very <HI>gentle</HI> fire to &s;tew or &s;immer, but not boil, &s;o as to rai&s;e a good &s;team for 6 or 8 hours. It is then taken off, and let &s;tand <HI>covered</HI> 'till the Hemp is cool enough to be handled. It is now taken out, and wrung very <HI>carefully,</HI> 'till dry as can be: then hang it up <HI>out of the way of the wind,</HI> in a garret or ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n with all the doors &s;hut. Here it remains, now and then turning it, 'till perfectly dry. Then pack it up in a <HI>clo&s;e,</HI> dry place, 'till it is to be u&s;ed. Yet at times it is to be vi&s;ited, and examined if any part has become <HI>damp.</HI> At lei&s;ure, <HI>twi&s;t up</HI> as many hands of Hemp as are intended for pre&s;ent u&s;e, <HI>hard</HI> as you can; and with a &s;mart, round, &s;mooth hand-beetle, on a &s;mooth &s;tone beat and pound each hand by it&s;elf, all over very well, turning it round till all is well brui&s;ed. Then untwi&s;t and hackle it through a coar&s;e, and after it through a fine hackle. Hackling is performed in the &s;ame manner as if combing a fine head of hair; beginning at the <HI>ends</HI> below as the&s;e are entangled, ri&s;ing higher and higher: at la&s;t the top of the head is reached. The fir&s;t tow makes country rope; the &s;econd, oznabrigs, &s;heeting and bagging; and the pure Hemp excellent linen.</P>
