<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN January la&s;t, I publi&s;hed <HI>The American Annual Regi&s;ter for</HI> 1796. My collection of materials required more room than had been expected, and it was found nece&s;&s;ary to clo&s;e the volume without completing the plan.</P>
<P>Some gentlemen, who wi&s;hed to &s;ee the publication proceed, offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t by &s;ub&s;criptions for a &s;econd volume. But this was un&s;uitable, becau&s;e per&s;ons who had not &s;een the for|mer one could not with propriety be a&s;ked to &s;ub&s;cribe for a continuation of it. I therefore began the &s;ame ta&s;k over again under a different title page. The &s;ubject was fertile, and repe|titions of what had been &s;aid already have been avoided with &s;o much care that they do not, in whole, extend to near half a page.</P>
<P>On the appearance of the former volume, certain critics complained of my &s;tile. The roughne&s;s of their own, in the in&s;tant of condemnation, afforded the be&s;t apology for the faults of mine. But moreover the&s;e refined literati were the patrons and prompters of William Cobbet. He had &s;poke of me, with his wonted politene&s;s, in ten or twelve pamphlets. It was proper, as it &s;eems, that I &s;hould be &s;ilent, becau&s;e the two chaplains of Congre&s;s, the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate and of the trea&s;ury were in the number of his auxiliaries or admirers. I would not injure Mr. Cobbet by comparing him with his em|ployers. The bench and jury who a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated lord Stafford were &s;till more execrable than Titus Oates.</P>
<P>In this catalogue of the patrons of genius we find Mr. Ro|bert Li&s;ton. The Briti&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, not contented with paying Mr. Cobbet for his labours, receives a daily bundle of his gazettes. No per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the feelings of a gentle|man would &s;uffer that commodity to come within his door. Such intermeddling from a foreign envoy would not be endured by any independent country in the world, unle&s;s in the United States of America. A French envoy at London, or an Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at Paris, never &s;ets up a new&s;paper to recommend
<PB N="viii" REF="031906_0008_0FEF424D2739D308">
his mea&s;ures. Neither the old monarchy nor the pre&s;ent republic of France, would, for a &s;ingle day, have endured &s;uch a connec|tion. In London, where the &s;pirit of national independence is under&s;tood and felt, the fir&s;t news of the Morning Chronicle being &s;upported by a French pen&s;ion, would level the prin|ter's office with the pavement. But Mr. Li&s;ton goes farther. He corre&s;ponds with internal traitors. He is detected, and the mo&s;t de&s;picable, or rather the mo&s;t pro&s;tituted of all cabinets, hath accepted of his refu&s;al to reveal their names. To trace the con&s;piracy, Congre&s;s appoints a committee of five mem|bers. Of the&s;e, three are tories, and one of them is Robert Goodloe Harper, the intimate friend of Li&s;ton, the advi&s;er of a Spani&s;h war, and of the conque&s;t of Mexico. This is a new way to di&s;cover plots.</P>
<P>When the fifth number of this book was publi&s;hed, Mr. Alexander Hamilton printed, in Mr. Fenno's gazette, a deni|al of his connection with Reynolds. He has now come from New-York to complete a &s;atisfactory &s;tatement. Like the pot whitewa&s;hing the kettle, he has already received from Mr. Wolcot a certificate of his virtue. He is, at pre&s;ent, al&s;o &s;olici|ting Mr. Monroe and Mr. Muhlenberg, on both of whom he had heaped mountains of calumny. Mr. Hamilton entreats them, to atte&s;t his <HI>innocence,</HI> that is to &s;ay, their belief of his having <HI>debauched Mrs. Reynolds.</HI></P>
<P>The variety of articles tran&s;mitted for revi&s;al and publication was unexpected, and many have been delayed for want of room. The denial of acce&s;s to &s;ub&s;cribers appeared an ungra|cious ta&s;k. A compliance with their wi&s;hes made it nece&s;&s;a|ry to &s;horten the latter part of the narrative, and to leave out &s;ome entire chapters that were prepared for the pre&s;s. This gives to the volume a mi&s;cellaneous texture, which the rigid remark|er is entitled to condemn. At another time, I &s;hall perhaps do better.</P>
<P>A report has been circulated, that Mr. John Beckley is the author of this volume. He did not frame a &s;ingle &s;entence of it. He is unacquainted with my hand writing, and I could not be &s;ure to di&s;tingui&s;h his.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AT the beginning of the year 1796, the fourth Congre&s;s of the United States were in their fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion. On the 4th of January, Mr. Samuel Smith laid on the table of the Repre&s;entatives a re&s;olution in the&s;e words: <Q>That from and after the  <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">  day of  <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">  it &s;hall not be lawful for any foreign &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el to land in the territories of the United States any goods, wares, or merchandize other than the produce of that country to which <HI>the &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el belongs.</HI></Q> This propo&s;al was profe&s;&s;edly pointed at the treaty of
<PB N="2" REF="031906_0010_0FEF42514506D1C8">
commerce with Britain, which had been &s;igned at London on the 19th of November, 1794, by Mr. John Jay, as envoy on the part of Ame|rica. Mr. S. Smith oppo&s;ed that in&s;trument. He &s;aid in Congre&s;s, that, within two years, it might be expected to de&s;troy the &s;hipping of this country. The fifteenth article of the treaty has the&s;e words: <Q>Nor &s;hall any prohibition be impo&s;ed on the ex|portation or the importation of any articles to or from the territories of the two parties re&s;pec|tively, which &s;hall not equally extend to all other nations.</Q> Thus the re&s;olution was in &s;trict har|mony with the conditions of the treaty; yet, if the United States &s;hall ever carry it into execution, the treaty it&s;elf will, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be at an end. Britain could find a thou&s;and effective ways of ex|pre&s;&s;ing her di&s;gu&s;t at this regulation, which would incommode her much more than the other mari|time &s;tates of Europe. Still &s;he would have le&s;s rea&s;on to complain than any nation in the world, becau&s;e the re&s;olution is grounded on the princi|ple a&s;&s;umed in the Engli&s;h act of navigation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the 2d of September, 1793, the French Convention pa&s;&s;ed a &s;imilar act. Its operation is only &s;u&s;pended on account of the war. By the fir&s;t article, no foreign commodities can be im|ported into France, but in French ve&s;&s;els, or in tho&s;e of the country which produces them, or of the country from which they are u&s;u|ally fir&s;t exported. By the &s;econd, no foreign ve&s;&s;el can convey from one port of France or her colonies to another, any of their produce. Third, every French ve&s;&s;el mu&s;t have her officers and three-fourths of her crew Frenchmen. It is amazing that the court of Ver&s;ailles did not adopt this rule an hundred years ago. It will, in a &s;hort time, double or quadruple the number of French &s;eamen. Were other omens averted, this law is an epitaph on the naval &s;upremacy of Britain. See an eloquent report by BARRERE.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The treaty in que&s;tion has produced many vo|lumes of elaborate inve&s;tigation. Since the new con&s;titution, no other &s;ubject has excited &s;o gene|ral an effort of the ingenuity, the eloquence, and
<PB N="3" REF="031906_0011_0FEF42566FE27028">
the pa&s;&s;ions of America. It was this emergency which marked out the pre&s;ent year as more emi|nently de&s;erving of hi&s;torical notice. The mat|ter it&s;elf daily grows in importance, as this tran&s;ac|tion has brought the United States to the verge of a French war. Few have lei&s;ure to read, and &s;till fewer have information or even capacity ade|quate to comprehend a great part of the complica|ted arguments employed for or again&s;t it. To at|tempt a detail of the topics on each &s;ide would be a voluminous, and by this time, almo&s;t an u&s;e|le&s;s undertaking. The public has already become &s;atiated with e&s;&s;ays, letters, memorials, replies, ob|&s;ervations, features, reports, addre&s;&s;es, views, vin|dications, defences, paragraphs, re&s;olutions, peti|tions, explanations, proceedings of town meetings, motions, and &s;peeches. Within the &s;hort &s;pace of eighteen months, the argument has entirely &s;hifted its place. The &s;tre&s;s of the debate can be no longer about whether the Briti&s;h treaty is advantageous or prejudicial to American commerce; but whether it is worth pre&s;erving at the ri&s;k of a French war. That the Directory of Paris have this object &s;ome|what in their eye is mo&s;t likely. The recall of their amba&s;&s;ador, citizen Adet, was a broad inti|mation of their de&s;ign. In Europe, &s;uch a &s;tep is the profe&s;&s;ed &s;ignal for ho&s;tilities. It is as certain that a party in this country are &s;olicitous of driving the United States into that conte&s;t. If a croud of other evidences could be forgotten, their ab&s;ence is &s;upplied by the letter from &s;ecretary Pickering to Mr. Pinckney our amba&s;&s;ador to the French re|public. At the &s;ame time, attempts are con&s;tantly made to decry the power of France. When a French general chances to retreat, the new&s;papers of the party teem with exultation. The republic at large is invariably repre&s;ented as a rendezvous of
<PB N="4" REF="031906_0012_0FEF4259B933BCE0">
ruffians, a nui&s;ance to civilized &s;ociety. It is im|po&s;&s;ible that the French &s;hould fail of being offen|ded at &s;uch unprovoked in&s;olence. They hire no gazettes in Paris to revile America. They do not fill libraries in cen&s;uring our political characters. Yet our federal prints attack, on every occa&s;ion, both the republic and all her friends, in the mo&s;t vulgar &s;tyle of abu&s;e. Even the mini&s;terial prints of London, the organs of Ro&s;e and Dundas, are, by many degrees, le&s;s in&s;olent in their invective, and le&s;s brutal in their reproach<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For in&s;tance, a late corre&s;pondent in the Gazette of the United States writes thus: <Q>That contemptible and drunken vagabond TOM PAINE, who is notoriou&s;ly de&s;titute of every hone&s;t princi|ple, religious, moral, or political, has crowned his career of impu|dence and fal&s;ehood, &amp;c.&mdash;This creature of avaricious poverty and deranged ambition, would &s;et the world on fire, if he could find &s;ixpence by the fight, and advocate the climate and govern|ment of hell to be popular there.&mdash;He was, at the commencement of our troubles, a decided friend to the mea&s;ures of Great Bri|tain.</Q> After the war, <Q>his fir&s;t attack was upon the <HI>tranquility</HI> of Great Britain: but here he was di&s;gracefully defeated.</Q> [It will be time enough to &s;peak of his <HI>defeat</HI> when the bank of England be|gins to pay its notes in gold and &s;ilver. The pre&s;ent paper-money plan is like trying to cro&s;s the Atlantic in a cork jacket.] <Q>I regret there was found any man in the United States &s;o ba&s;e and ho&s;tile to the peace and honour of his country, as to publi&s;h this letter of infamy;</Q> the letter from Paine to general Wa&s;hington, printed by Mr. Bache. The peace of the country runs no hazard, and as little awaits the honour of the general. On the 14th of December, 1796, Dr. Ames ob&s;erved in Congre&s;s, that <Q>the character is fixed in <HI>hi&s;tory!</HI></Q> Paine, therefore, has come too late.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Before going farther, we &s;hall glance at the cha|racter and actual &s;tate of the French, whom Mr. Pickering and his friends are &s;o anxious to degrade. In preparing for a quarrel it is e&s;&s;ential to be ac|quainted with the talents and re&s;ources of your an|tagoni&s;t. The &s;ituation of our citizens, thinly di&s;|per&s;ed over an immen&s;e continent, affords a pecu|liar avenue to deception. It has been employed with diligence again&s;t the republic. On a topic
<PB N="5" REF="031906_0013_0FEF425D9D6711B0">
of &s;uch univer&s;al Importance candid explanation can hardly be tedious. No better authority will be required than that of Edmund Burke. Two letters from him on this head have been recently printed. A few detached &s;entences, extracted from whole &s;heets to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, will place the re&s;ources of France in a ju&s;t light, and &s;hew what the United States have to expect in a conte&s;t with her. <Q>Out of the tomb of the murdered monar|chy in France, has ari&s;en a va&s;t, tremendous, unformed &s;pectre, in <HI>a far more terrific gui&s;e</HI> than any which ever yet overpowered the imagi|nation and &s;ubdued the fortitude of man.&mdash;The republic has actually conquered the fine&s;t parts of Europe, has di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, di&s;united, deranged, and broke to pieces all the re&s;t.&mdash;We have not in the &s;lighte&s;t degree, impaired the &s;trength of the com|mon enemy, (France), in any one of tho&s;e points in which his particular force con&s;i&s;ts.&mdash;The re|gicide has received our advances with &s;corn<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The letters were publi&s;hed before Malme&s;bury went to Paris.</NOTE>!&mdash; If things &s;hould give us <HI>the comparative happi|ne&s;s of a &s;truggle,</HI> I &s;hall be found dying by the &s;ide of Mr. Pitt.&mdash;Spain is a province of the ja|cobin empire.&mdash;Her crown is a fief of regicide.&mdash; We have not con&s;idered, as we ought, the dread|ful energy of a &s;tate in which the property has nothing to do with the government.&mdash;The di&s;co|very is dreadful, the mine <HI>exhau&s;tle&s;s.</HI>&mdash;A repub|lic of a character the mo&s;t re&s;tle&s;s, the mo&s;t en|terpri&s;ing, the mo&s;t impious, the mo&s;t fierce and bloody, the mo&s;t hypocritical and perfidious, the mo&s;t bold and daring that has ever been &s;een, or indeed that can be conceived to exi&s;t!</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Burke is far from being &s;ingular in his pa|nic. Major Cartwright, in his work, entitled, <HI>The
<PB N="6" REF="031906_0014_0FEF425F65341028">
Commonwealth in Danger,</HI> &s;hews the folly of Eng|land depending for &s;afety, &s;olely on her fleet. The French may give battle by &s;ea, be defeated, and lo&s;e twenty &s;hips of the line, without material in|jury. They know that the Engli&s;h mu&s;t be crip|pled and return to port. The road is then open, and they di&s;embark in Britain what troops they plea&s;e. The major adds, that, previous to the vic|tory of the 1&s;t of June, 1794, admiral Howe was reviled for not beating the French fleet; but even then, he only did &s;o becau&s;e the French came pur|po&s;ely in his way. They al&s;o, by &s;acrificing a few &s;hips of the line, gained their object. This was to &s;ecure the arrival of an American convoy with provi&s;ions. Arthur Young, a third writer of emi|nence, has demon&s;trated the depth of his de&s;pair by the following propo&s;al; viz. that England &s;hould rai&s;e an army of five hundred thou&s;and men; and that they, as well as their officers, mu&s;t all be <HI>men of property.</HI> He &s;ays that nothing el&s;e can &s;ave the country from a French conque&s;t. This was above two years ago<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See An Idea of the pre&s;ent State of France, printed &s;ometime previous to March, 1795.</NOTE>. The&s;e authorities con|firm the lamentations of Mr. Burke. As to his picture of what France can perform, we may judge by what &s;he hath &s;uffered. In March, 1795, Du|mourier printed at Hamburgh, a very intere&s;ting pamphlet on the &s;tate of the war. He therein &s;ays, that, in December, 1794, a report was laid before the Convention of the number of &s;oldiers whom France had lo&s;t by her three campaigns. They were &s;tated at &s;ix hundred and fifty thou&s;and. Du|mourier adds, that this computation was by one-third part le&s;s than the truth; and that, including emigration, famine, and the &s;caffold, France had
<PB N="7" REF="031906_0015_0FEF420ECB32C2A0">
then lo&s;t twelve hundred thou&s;and men, in the flow|er of life, be&s;ides aged per&s;ons, women and chil|dren. Compared with this havoc of the human &s;pecies, the wa&s;te of any other modern war is but trifling. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia e&s;timates that the war of 1756, which la&s;ted &s;even years, de&s;troyed, in the whole, and in all parts of the world, only about a million of &s;oldiers. To the twelve hundred thou&s;and Frenchmen we may &s;afely add eight hundred thou|&s;and from the allied armies; &s;ince the latter were equally numerous with the republicans, and be&s;ides were beaten. We have thus about two millions of deaths, in two years and four months, or above eight hundred thou&s;and per annum; &s;o that the pre&s;ent war is at lea&s;t five times more de&s;tructive than that of 1756.</P>
<P>No other nation or government that the world ever &s;aw, could have &s;upported &s;uch enormous lo&s;&s;es as the French have endured; yet their &s;trength appears undimini&s;hed, and every campaign adds to the catalogue of their conque&s;ts. It is not le&s;s than madne&s;s for a party in America to be hiring new&s;papers to revile &s;uch a terrible people. They are not only mo&s;t formidable from their phy&s;ical &s;trength, but from the peculiar &s;tructure of their government. <Q>It is &s;y&s;tematic; &s;ays Mr. Burke, it is &s;imple to its principle; it has unity and con|&s;i&s;tency in perfection.</Q> [Congre&s;s have refu&s;ed to impo&s;e a land tax. Nay &s;ome of them, with &s;urpri&s;ing hardine&s;s, declare &s;uch a mea&s;ure imprac|ticable, though land taxes are at this moment paid in perhaps every &s;tate of the union. Penn&s;ylvania has three or four. Oppo&s;ed to this frivolity, this puppet-&s;hew of legi&s;lation, ob&s;erve what Burke tells of France:] <Q>In that country, entirely to cut off a branch of commerce, to extingui&s;h a manufac|ture, to de&s;troy the circulation of money, to

<P>This is the &s;ort of enemy whom we may chance to encounter, as the price of the Briti&s;h treaty, and the epi&s;tle of Mr. Pickering. When in parlia|ment, Mr. Burke was con&s;idered as the be&s;t in|formed member of the Hou&s;e of Commons. He has long been the oracle of Engli&s;h ari&s;tocracy. He is a pen&s;ioner to Pitt, and would be &s;orry to overcharge the picture of French power.</P>
<P>It is &s;erving America, to make a &s;hort compari&s;on between the relative force of the two nations. The French, in only four years, have overcome the German empire, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and the Netherlands, comprehending not le&s;s than fifty millions of people. The United States, white, black and yellow, have not five millions. The French have drubbed three Briti&s;h kingdoms, with their popula|tion of fourteen millions, and cru&s;hed numerous con|&s;piracies and rebellions in the heart of their country. The revolt of La Vendee alone co&s;t as much fight|ing as pa&s;&s;ed in America during the revolution. Pichegru, in one campaign, did what Marlborough, though con&s;tantly victorious, could not accompli&s;h in ten.</P>
<P>In 1794, France maintained nearly eleven hun|dred thou&s;and fighting men, and was, in 1795, to have &s;ixty thou&s;and cannoneers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Carey's edition of Guthrie's Geography, vol. ii. p. 699.</NOTE>.

The French are the be&s;t appointed troops, perhaps, in the world. From an immen&s;e di&s;tance, they have been often tran&s;ported in waggons to the field of battle. The pay of American regulars is ab&s;o|lute beggary. The privates have a ration per day worth twenty cents, or &s;eventy two dollars and eigh|ty cents a year.

All other &s;ources are about exhau&s;ted; and a war with France, by the ruin of our commerce, would certainly cut off a great part of tho&s;e ari&s;ing from it. Nine parts in ten of the public taxes proceed from the duties on impo&s;t and tonnage. In the land tax debates of Congre&s;s, la&s;t winter, Mr. Harper &s;trangely &s;aid, that, if at war with France, our trade would not, in his opinion, &s;uffer more than it does already.

<P>If we look at the &s;ea there is no pro&s;pect of &s;uc|ce&s;s in a conte&s;t with France. We have on the &s;tocks three frigates.

But then our privateers can de&s;troy their com|merce! Yes. And they &s;hall de&s;troy ours. Thus, as Henry Fielding &s;ays, we &s;ell a blind hor&s;e and receive a bad note in payment.

In a &s;truggle with France alone, un&s;upported by her allies, we could not mu&s;ter a tenth part of her force either by land or &s;ea. Mr. Pitt computed, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, that the campaign of 1794, co&s;t the republic an hundred and fifty millions &s;ter|ling. Ours with the Wyandots were e&s;timated at a million of dollars yearly. The burden produced infi|nite di&s;content, and an earne&s;t de&s;ire of peace. France, at an annual charge three or &s;ix hundred times grea|ter, continues to fight and to conquer, to trample every enemy, and to dictate the terms of every peace. To contend, if we can help it, with this re|publican Typhoeus would, in ra&s;hne&s;s, re&s;emble the la&s;t &s;truggles of Jeru&s;alem and Palmira. On the altars of Titus and Aurelian we might read with probability the pro&s;pect before us.</P>
<P>As a political writer, Alexander Hamilton holds the &s;ame rank in America that Burke enjoys in Eng|land; and it would be injuring the logic of his party not to give his opinion. Camillus, No. vii. was publi&s;hed in the &s;ummer of 1795, and contains a &s;urvey of Europe extremely different from that of Mr. Burke. <Q>It cannot be denied that &s;he (Britain) is triumphant on the ocean; that the acqui&s;itions which &s;he has made upon France are hitherto <HI>greater</HI> than tho&s;e which France has made upon her.</Q> The reduction of two or three i&s;lands in the We&s;t Indies is not worth notice in this conte&s;t, where the independence of Britain is in imminent danger. When No. vii. was written, the French had conquered Holland, and the Au&s;trian Netherlands. <Q>Holland, &s;ays Mr. Burke, is to England a matter of value <HI>ine&s;timable.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter I.</NOTE></Q> By the conque&s;t of the low countries, France forms a &s;emicircle around the Briti&s;h i&s;lands.

of England lies wind-bound at Spithead, or is in any other given &s;ituation, the French, by taking an oppo&s;ite point of the compa&s;s, can, at their lei&s;ure, di&s;embark an army on the coa&s;t of Britain or Ireland. For excluding them, an hundred &s;hips of the line and an hundred canoes would be of equal importance. This, by the way, points out the folly of a favourite Briti&s;h maxim, that <HI>he who is ma&s;ter by &s;ea is ma&s;ter by land.</HI> While the Ne|therlands, therefore, continue a part of the repub|lic, it is frivolous to &s;peak of Briti&s;h conque&s;ts in the Ea&s;t or We&s;t Indies, or indeed any where el&s;e.

<P><Q>If, on the one hand, &s;he (Britain) owes an im|men&s;e debt, on the other &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an immen&s;e credit, which there is no &s;ymptom of being im|paired.

Yet &s;uch is the condi|tion of England as de&s;cribed by its advocate.] <Q>Her government po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, internally, as much vigor, and has as much national &s;upport, as it perhaps ever had at any former period of her hi&s;tory. Alarmed by the unfortunate exce&s;&s;es in France, mo&s;t men of property cling to the government, and carry with them the great bulk of the nation, almo&s;t the whole of the farming intere&s;t, and much the greate&s;t proportion of other indu&s;tri|ous cla&s;&s;es.</Q></P>

Thus the authority of Pitt is &s;uperadded to that of Burke, and they explode the opinion of Ca|millus. Each &s;ucceeding campaign is an additional nail driven into the head of monarchy. Every new tax makes a number of new enemies. Here we per|ceive three di&s;tinct cau&s;es for a Briti&s;h revolution. The&s;e are, a &s;uperior and implacable enemy on the continent, who&s;e local po&s;ition makes a Bri|ti&s;h navy u&s;ele&s;s; a national debt, which by this time approaches to four hundred millions &s;terling, and of which the very intere&s;t can be paid only in paper; and a party within the country who&s;e enmity cannot be extingui&s;hed, and who, by the confe&s;&s;ion of their enemies, are abundantly numerous for the de&s;truction of any government in the world. <Q>Among her allies, &s;ays Camillus, are the two greate&s;t powers of Europe, France excepted; namely, Ru&s;&s;ia and Au&s;tria. Spain and Sardinia

make a common cau&s;e with her.</Q> The two lat|ter have been turned by France into mere &s;tepping &s;tones in her path to the dominion of Europe. Ru&s;|&s;ia never gave any help, more or le&s;s, to the crown|ed coalition. Catharine is now dead; and her &s;on has declined any concern with it. But even if he did &s;end an army to the Rhine, Britain would be obliged to pay them. As for Au&s;tria, Ja&s;per Wil&s;on, in his celebrated letter to Mr. Pitt, &s;ays, that, before the pre&s;ent war began, the Emperor was offering nine per cent for money, &s;o that by this time he mu&s;t be as much entangled in debt as England her&s;elf. Nothing but arbitrary power could enable him to pay even a &s;ingle regiment. This will not hold out long. <Q>She (France) cannot, without great dif|ficulty, from their geographical po&s;ition, make any farther acqui&s;itions upon the territories of Au&s;tria.</Q> Carnot is a better geographer than Mr. Hamilton. Since this prediction, Moreau and Jour|dan have penetrated into the heart of Germany. They have &s;ubdued a multitude of its princes, and were within a &s;mall matter of reaching Vienna. As to Italy, Buonaparte has eclip&s;ed every commander &s;ince Tele&s;inus and Sylla engaged under the walls of Rome. Hear what Burke &s;ays: <Q>The over-running of Lombardy, the &s;ubjugation of Pied|mont, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its impregnable fortre&s;&s;es, the &s;eizing on all the neutral &s;tates of Italy, our expul&s;ion from Leghorn, in&s;tances renewed for our expul&s;ion from Genoa, Spain rendered &s;ub|ject to them and ho&s;tile to us, Portugal bent un|der the yoke, half the empire over-run and rava|ged<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter I.</NOTE>.</Q> This is the picture of 1796.

When the blind lead the blind, we know the &s;equel. With regard to Europe, Mr. Hamilton is, in all his views, mi&s;taken. This lamp of politi|cal wi&s;dom, has conducted America to the edge of a precipice from which General Wa&s;hington &s;aw fit to retire.

Some people &s;peak of the Briti&s;h navy as if it could be pre&s;ent every where at the &s;ame time. If twenty-five thou&s;and Frenchmen had di&s;embarked at Bantry bay, a march of two days would have brought them to Corke, a city as large as Philadelphia, di&s;affected to government, and be&s;ides entirely defencele&s;s. Another week would be &s;uf|ficient for reaching Dublin. The temper of its citizens appears by a letter from the viceroy.

He boa&s;ts of having a militia of two thou&s;and bar|ri&s;ters, attornies, merchants, and &s;uch people.

But, as lately ob&s;erved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">American Annual Regi&s;ter, Chapter 8.</NOTE>, the time cho&s;en for ma|king it was highly improper. Camillus, in ancient or modern annals, will hardly find that, with views merely commerical, any nation ever cho&s;e &s;o hazar|dous a time for entering into a treaty. This con|&s;ideration alone &s;hould have laid the bargain on its back, at lea&s;t till the conclu&s;ion of a peace. It was ju&s;t like building a hou&s;e clo&s;e to another which is on fire.

If &s;o much had been acquired by one delay of &s;ix months, rea&s;on pointed out a &s;econd po&s;tponement. Britain has been ever &s;ince going down hill, and had the affair been to begin at this time, we might have had any terms that could be de&s;ired. The latter part of the above citation obliquely implies that Ame|rica had no choice between a treaty and a war. The &s;uppo&s;ition gives a poor &s;pecimen of the writer's di&s;|cernment.

while Hoche's hu&s;&s;ars are whetting their &s;abres in the barracks of Dublin. America would then make but a &s;orry figure in a &s;olitary negociation. Be&s;ides, we cannot tru&s;t our ally. This appears by an ex|tract from the journals of Congre&s;s, in the year 1779. <Q>"We are contending, &s;ay they, again&s;t a kingdom <HI>crumbling to pieces</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How does this agree with Camillus?</NOTE>, a nation with|out public virtue, and a people &s;old and be|trayed by their own repre&s;entatives; again&s;t a prince governed by his pa&s;&s;ions, and a mini&s;try without con&s;i&s;tency or wi&s;dom; again&s;t <HI>armies half paid,</HI> and <HI>generals</HI> half tru&s;ted [the&s;e were two flagrant fal&s;ehoods], again&s;t a government equal <HI>only</HI> (ob&s;erve this <HI>only</HI>) to plans of plunder, conflagration, and murder, a government noted for its violations of the rights of <HI>religion,</HI> ju&s;tice, humanity, and mankind, and revolting from <HI>the protection of Providence!</HI>"&mdash;"Our armies in Flan|ders &s;wore terribly," &s;aid uncle Toby, "but nothing like this!"</Q> As for Providence, the peo|ple of England held frequent fa&s;t days for military &s;ucce&s;s.

They &s;hould have &s;aid nothing about half-paid armies, till they had been half able to pay their own.

the &s;tile of 1779 agrees with that of 1794. Only poor fifteen years have converted a horde of demons, for that is the amount of his billing&s;gate de&s;cription, into the mo&s;t upright people in the world.</P>
<P>We have remarked on the ha&s;te with which Mr. Jay clo&s;ed his treaty, and how much might have been won by deferring it. But the conduct of the negociator is eclip&s;ed by that of the great body of the people. It does not appear that the po&s;&s;ibility of a rupture with France ever once came into the conception of mo&s;t of our citizens. A majority in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of Congre&s;s did indeed fore&s;ee or fear it. One of them was a&s;ked why they did not &s;tate it in their &s;peeches, in&s;tead of ma|ny trifles, which were advanced again&s;t the treaty. He replied that <Q>they did not think it prudent. The Hamiltonians would in&s;tantly have accu&s;ed them of encouraging the French to begin a war with this country.</Q></P>
<P>This is the very de&s;ign of &s;ome of that party them&s;elves. When a man calls hard names at his neighbour he is under&s;tood as de&s;iring to quarrel. Mr. Monroe, American amba&s;&s;ador to France, con|ducted him&s;elf with prudence and popularity. In December 1796, he pre&s;ented letters of recall, and bade farewell to the Executive Directory, in the mo&s;t amicable terms. His addre&s;s was received with re&s;pect and cordiality. He congratulated the nation on their victories, and their new con&s;titution, in terms not as &s;trong, by twenty degrees, as tho&s;e of Mr. Wa&s;hington on receiving the French flag. The Gazette of the United States, for the 29th of March, 1797, &s;colds him for this act of civility &s;o contra&s;ted to the in&s;olence of Mr. Pickering. <Q>Though you could <HI>crouch,</HI> and <HI>kneel,</HI> and <HI>lick,</HI> and <HI>fawn,</HI> on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, your fellow citizens
<PB N="23" REF="031906_0031_0FEF4298692FC708">
can feel nothing for you but <HI>contempt;</HI> and for the Directory, who require of the United States an act that would pro&s;trate them in the du&s;t, the utmo&s;t <HI>indignation.</HI></Q> There is much more in this &s;tile. The alleged act referred to, is, that the Direc|tory refu&s;ed to admit an American mini&s;ter till the United States <HI>had redre&s;&s;ed their grievances.</HI></P>
<P>As for the contempt and indignation &s;o fiercely &s;poke about, a different tone may &s;oon be found ne|ce&s;&s;ary. Mantua is at length given up. Five Au&s;|trian armies have been de&s;troyed, and an hundred thou&s;and pri&s;oners taken, during a &s;ingle campaign in Italy. Compared to this work, the American revolution was mere &s;cratching. The Emperor cannot pay his troops with Engli&s;h bank notes. He mu&s;t either make an immediate peace, or be de|throned. It does not appear that the United States could, in one &s;ummer, rai&s;e five, or indeed two &s;uch armies, in defence of the frontier of Canada; and it is likely enough that the French may reclaim that province from England, and require this coun|try to re&s;tore its ancient boundaries. They would enter upon &s;uch a &s;cheme with every advantage. They have already a numerous colony of their own people in Canada, who are acquainted with it as well as the New Englanders. They have always exceeded the Briti&s;h in the art of gaining the Indi|ans. The war with the &s;avages has been computed to co&s;t yearly a million of dollars; but with a French army to &s;upport them, a campaign might devour fifty millions. The ce&s;&s;ion of Canada would be one of the lea&s;t wonderful events of the pre&s;ent war. A great part of the people of New England have been uncomonly &s;olicitious to exa&s;perate the repub|lic, and, after the treatment which they have al&s;o diligently be&s;towed on the &s;outhern &s;tates, and their numerous menaces of disjunction, the latter might

chu&s;e to give them&s;elves but &s;mall concern in the di&s;pute. On the &s;outh-ea&s;tern frontier, the United States are &s;till more vulnerable. Were Victor Hughes, with three or four battalions of black troops, to land on the coa&s;t of Virginia, the horrors of St. Domingo would immediately be renewed. Geor|gia &s;till continues to import negroes; a practice de&s;erving the &s;evere&s;t reprobation.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider the terror, which France has, for three years pa&s;t, in&s;pired in Europe, the con|que&s;t of Canada, and the exten&s;ion of its limits, will &s;eem but as du&s;t in the balance. The brutal in&s;olence with which the republicans are treated in the Columbian Centinel, can ari&s;e only from an un|acquaintance with the po&s;&s;ible extent of danger to New England. Count Montgaillard is a French royali&s;t. His enmity to the revolution is as &s;incere as that of any printer or preacher in the ea&s;tern &s;tates. In 1794, he publi&s;hed a pamphlet on <HI>The Nece&s;&s;ity of continuing the war.</HI> <Q>The generation, &s;ays he, which is to invade and de&s;troy Europe has now reached the twelfth year of its age. It was born in the very mid&s;t of a revolution [that of America perhaps]; it has &s;een all the epocha of this [the French] revolution; it has inhaled all its principles, and it has &s;ucked in every poi|&s;on by which it was infected.&mdash;Where is the trea|ty of peace which can con&s;train this ri&s;ing genera|tion to renounce &s;o horrible a conque&s;t.</Q> He in&s;i&s;ts, like Burke, that the war mu&s;t be continued; he even affirms, that the republic <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;ubdu|ed. When this piece appeared, the French had not conquered Lombardy. They had not plun|dered one-half of Germany; and the bank of England had not &s;topt payment. Arthur Young, in the pamphlet already cited, &s;peaks in the &s;ame tone. <Q>Activity, vigour, and energy, &s;uch as the

William Cobbet has &s;et up a gazette in this city, for the expre&s;s end of reviling France. He does not conceal his de&s;ign of bringing the nation into a French war. Sincerity is always re&s;pectable, and he cannot, as an editor, be charged with a want of that virtue. If we are plunged into &s;uch a &s;itua|tion, his &s;ub&s;cribers, and not Mr. Cobbet, mu&s;t be held accountable for the mi&s;chief that he has done. It will be nothing wonderful, if, before three years elap&s;e, a French fleet &s;hall anchor in the Delaware, and compel Philadelphia to deliver to the republic both him and them. Myriads of precedents of this kind are to be found in hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Dr. Ames once ob&s;erved, in Congre&s;s, that "this country is ri&s;ing into a giant's &s;trength." He was right. Ten years more of peace will double the population of the whole range of we&s;tern &s;tates from Vermont to Tenna&s;&s;ee. Above an hundred and fifty thou&s;and people are annually added to our num|bers, and the ratio of increa&s;e is con&s;tantly aug|menting. It will &s;oon amount to two hundred thou|&s;and yearly, or perhaps it has already reached that proportion. This is an advantage enjoyed with equal happine&s;s by no other nation. The addition|al &s;warms will, for centuries to come, have no want of room.</P>

of America was the re&s;ult of examination. The &s;hameful attempts made to widen the breach between the two countries was illu&s;trated by addi|tional remarks. We have clo&s;ed with pointing out the peculiar advantages that America may hope for, beyond any other nation, from the continuance of peace; and we have &s;een &s;ome of the motives of that party, who, under pretended zeal for her con|&s;titution, wi&s;h to di&s;turb her tranquility. To elu|cidate the numberle&s;s advantages of a pacific &s;y&s;|tem a great deal yet remains to be &s;aid. So much untruth and deception have been &s;tudiou&s;ly heaped on the &s;ubject, that much previous labour is requi|red to remove the rubbi&s;h, before even the founda|tion of a narrative can be properly &s;ketched out. The mo&s;t painful portion of the ta&s;k is to be&s;tow cen&s;ure on per&s;ons or parties, and &s;ometimes to hold up even a large majority of the nation in a light not extremely reputable.

The city of Wa&s;hington, and the treatment of the late continental army, will merit and receive &s;ome inve&s;tigation. The&s;e topics are intimately connected with the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;e&s;|&s;ion of Congre&s;s about to be de&s;cribed.

<P>The fir&s;t five introductory chapters having been employed on political &s;ubjects, we &s;hall be prepared to go on with the journal of Congre&s;s. As variety is the &s;oul of enjoyment, and as this work is intended for the entertainment of every cla&s;s of people, an intermediate and mi&s;cellaneous chapter will be given on the pre&s;ent internal &s;tate of America. A &s;warm of books of travels, in this country will, among other articles of amu&s;ement, be brought on the ta|pis, and &s;ome of their injurious or ab&s;urd ob&s;erva|tions with re&s;pect to America will be candidly ex|plained.

<P>The mere bulk of a daily new&s;paper makes its mode of information often intricate, and &s;ometimes inacce&s;&s;ible. A folio volume of twelve hundred and forty-eight pages may damp the curio&s;ity of the bolde&s;t reader. No one new&s;paper can relate eve|ry thing. The proprietor generally wi&s;hes, as far as he conveniently can, to decline publi&s;hing what his competitors have already given to the world. Almo&s;t every &s;heet is, likewi&s;e, half filled with ad|verti&s;ements which are entirely u&s;ele&s;s to mo&s;t rea|ders. The&s;e defects in new&s;papers cannot, by di|ligence or candour, be entirely &s;hunned. But they point out the expediency of an annual compilation, where &s;election, brevity, and arrangement can more ea&s;ily find place. Many citizens of Philadelphia take in &s;ix daily new&s;papers at an yearly expence of about fifty dollars. Three different prints are a common &s;upply. Not one-half or perhaps one-tenth part of their contents are read; and they are &s;ometimes ca&s;t into the fire without being opened. After &s;uch a wa&s;te of money, a charge of one or two dollars for a yearly publication cannot be held extravagant. The compiler of &s;uch a book has the greate&s;t ad|vantage in coming at a di&s;tance behind the events which he is to relate. He can expatiate on the igno|rance of &s;tate&s;men who, at ea&s;ter, did not exactly fore&s;ee what was to happen next chri&s;tmas, and which, a twelve month after it has pa&s;t, he &s;ees ve|ry di&s;tinctly.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><Q>AS to Gallatin, the &s;editious Gallatin! What &s;hall I &s;ay? How &s;hall I de&s;cribe that com|pound of vice and depravity, that di&s;ciple of meanne&s;s, corruption, debauchery, and idlene&s;s. He is a foreigner by birth and education.</Q> [Of cour&s;e, he mu&s;t be a ra&s;cal]. <Q>For &s;ome time after his arrival in this country, he wandered about the di&s;trict of Maine, like Cain, a fugitive and vagabond, de&s;titute of the means of hone&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.&mdash;The writer of this felt the effects of his own liberality for <HI>months afterwards!</HI>&mdash; Unable to pay for a lodging, or to purcha&s;e the nece&s;&s;aries of life, it was his cu&s;tom to &s;leep in barns, and under the foliage of hedges, and not unu&s;ually in the arms of &s;ome &s;hameful &s;trumpet. The fragments of the kitchen &s;ati&s;fied the cra|vings of hunger. We find him next among the
<PB N="32" REF="031906_0040_0FEF42B0449AECB0">
in&s;urgents of the we&s;tern counties in Penn&s;yl|vania. The late whi&s;ky rebellion there is prin|cipally attributed to him.</Q> There is ten times more of this trumpery. It is copied from the Ken|nebeck Intelligencer; and was publi&s;hed about the beginning of the year 1797 to defeat the re-election of Mr. Dearborne, a member of Congre&s;s for Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. This is one &s;ample of the fe|deral eloquence of New England. If Mr. Galla|tin had wi&s;hed for an opportunity of inflaming the public, he could not have cho&s;en a better topic than American finance. Yet his treati&s;e on it is written in the mo&s;t harmle&s;s &s;tile, and &s;eems to evince an unu&s;ual degree of good nature and for|bearance.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time with this production, the Connecticut Courant contained <HI>Guillotina,</HI> a &s;eries of rhimes, written by one Trumbull. They were republi&s;hed in a Providence new&s;paper. A few lines will &s;hew in what kind of kennel this Con|necticut mu&s;e dabbles; and how wretchedly a certain party labour under a dearth of decent ad|vocates.</P>
<Q><L>"Once more my fond attentions turn,</L>
<L>"Where Penn&s;ylvania's patriots burn.</L>
<L>"See Mifflin &s;tretching out the laws,</L>
<L>"To aid the anti-federal cau&s;e."</L></Q>
<P>This refers to the &s;candalous artifices employ|ed in Penn&s;ylvania to &s;top the arrival of the po&s;t at this city with votes for electors at the late elec|tion of Pre&s;ident, and to the activity of governor Mifflin in detecting a variety of frauds made u&s;e of by the federal party. If Trumbull had felt any &s;en&s;e of common hone&s;ty, or common &s;hame, he would not have &s;tirred the a&s;hes of a &s;tory &s;o di&s;|honourable to his friends.</P>
<Q><PB N="33" REF="031906_0041_0FEF42B3FA7919D8">
<L>"See him with Barclay, John, and Dallas,</L>
<L>"(Poor Penn&s;ylvania keeps no gallows)</L>
<L>"Play many a democratic prank,</L>
<L>"In fleecing Penn&s;ylvania bank."</L></Q>
<P>One may &s;ay, with par&s;on Adams, <Q>I would ra|ther be the &s;ubject of &s;uch ver&s;es, than the au|thor.</Q> Several months before this piece ap|peared, Mr. Dallas had publi&s;hed a certificate that the bank of Penn&s;ylvania was, at the time referred to, in his debt. This fact could not be unknown to the libeller of Hartford. But <HI>old bra&s;s will make a new pan,</HI> &s;ays the proverb. A fiction, though refuted in pro&s;e, may have a joyful re&s;urrection in ver&s;e. The polite introduction of the gallows &s;hews how &s;trongly &s;ome of the federal party thir&s;t for blood. They have given more than one intimation to that purpo&s;e. The New-York Gazette has an e&s;&s;ay by William Wilcocks, dated the 15th of November, 1796. <Q>Surely, &s;ays he, the guillotine has not done <HI>all</HI> its du|ty!</Q> He rails at the machine in France, yet re|commends the &s;etting up of another in America, for that is his plain inference. Some people &s;hould not, in common prudence, be &s;o forward to &s;peak of banks, till they give a &s;atisfactory account of their connection with Alexander Hamilton, and <HI>his</HI> bank of the United States. <Q>The books of transfer at the trea&s;ury, and the books at the bank, are held &s;ecret under the obligation of an oath, on all per&s;ons who u&s;e or in&s;pect them, not to reveal the names or amount of &s;tock hol|ders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See An Examination of the late Proceedings in Congre&s;s, re|&s;pecting the official conduct of the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, da|ted 8th of March, 1793, p. 25.</NOTE>.</Q> So much concealment can hardly be
<PB N="34" REF="031906_0042_0FEF42B6C543BB88">
for an honourable purpo&s;e. The righteous are bold as a lion. Trumbull proceeds thus:
<Q><L>"When Fauchet kept <HI>an open mint,</HI></L>
<L>"They doubtle&s;s had a finger in't.</L></Q></P>
<P>This is another exploded untruth. The rhymer goes on at this rate through five columns of rib|baldry. The lines now cited are &s;ufficient to &s;hew the cla&s;&s;ical di&s;cernment of his friends, and what &s;ort of aid they will &s;toop to receive. Swanwick, Giles, Gallatin, and a long li&s;t of that party are reviled &s;adly. Dr. Franklin, his grand&s;on, Mr. Bache, and Thomas Paine meet with the &s;ame u&s;age. General Wa&s;hington, as u&s;ual, is thoroughly &s;oaked in the treacle of panegyric. But when the Pre&s;i|dent notified his intention to re&s;ign, the party &s;oon began to change their tune. Wilcocks has &s;aid <Q>that the <HI>ful&s;ome adulation</HI> of the Pre&s;ident on the reception of the French flag was the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> deroga|tory part of his admini&s;tration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aurora, 31&s;t December, 1796.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The charge of being a ful&s;ome &s;ycophant does not entirely agree with the &s;uperb encomiums, which Wilcocks has &s;o frequently plai&s;tered upon Gene|ral Wa&s;hington. This veering about lets us into the real character of &s;ome people, and how little they care about the General, when his reputation cea&s;es to promote their private ends.</P>
<P>But this revolt was overbalanced by Major William Jack&s;on, &s;urveyor of the port of Philadel|phia. The &s;peech of the Pre&s;ident, on the 8th of December, 1796, was followed up, next day, by the Major, with a puff in one of our new&s;papers. It begins thus. <Q>To attempt an illu&s;tration of a &s;ubject in it&s;elf &s;o illumined as the &s;peech of our mo&s;t excellent Pre&s;ident were an arrogance
<PB N="35" REF="031906_0043_0FEF42BBAE02D6D0">
which we utterly di&s;claim.</Q> He goes on white-wa&s;hing for a con&s;iderable length. <Q>The di&s;tant &s;ettler on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi beholds with <HI>exultation</HI> that his happine&s;s forms a con&s;ideration in the mind of the government, co-equal with that of his fellow citizen on the Atlantic.</Q> He is equally entitled to protection; for his welfare is e&s;&s;ential to the union. Hence exultation would be mi&s;plac|ed. A Pre&s;ident and other officers of government are paid for doing their duty; and, if they fail of performing it to public &s;atisfaction, there are, if we could only believe &s;o, abundance of men as good as the be&s;t of them. Major Jack&s;on here points at the Spani&s;h treaty; but he might have reflected that the &s;ame admini&s;tration, by the weake&s;t and meane&s;t &s;pecies of trimming, has induced the dan|ger of a French war, and if that happens, the we&s;|tern waters will be more completely blocked up than ever.</P>
<P><Q>Is there a &s;eaman belonging to the United States, or a connection of that valuable cla&s;s of citizens, who&s;e vows are <HI>not</HI> offered for the good of him, who&s;e head and heart have been &s;o much occupied with their concerns?</Q> This was an unfortunate topic. But the Major, as a military man, knows that the weake&s;t part of a fortifica|tion has mo&s;t need of defence. <Q>Where is the veteran who&s;e bo&s;om does not beat in re&s;pon&s;ive applau&s;e to the eulogium of Wa&s;hington on military &s;kill?</Q> If, at the creation of the public debt, he had taken a &s;ingle &s;tep to &s;ave them from indigence, if he had refu&s;ed to &s;ign the &s;tatute of limitations, and &s;ome other laws not much better<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">American Annual Regi&s;ter, chap. v. and xi.</NOTE>, their bo&s;oms would have been more likely to beat.

the Pre&s;ident. The great body of the people have betrayed entire indifference about the old &s;oldiers, otherwi&s;e &s;uch acts never could have pa&s;t. At the &s;ame time money is unaccountably wa&s;ted on &s;a|vages. John Watts, a Creek warrior, boa&s;ts of having taken thirty-three &s;calps. In the latter part of 1796, this fellow, and a number of others, came to Philadelphia, where they fea&s;ted at an ex|pence of four thou&s;and dollars<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is &s;tated on the authority of Mr. Chri&s;topher Greenup, a repre&s;entative from Kentucky. The writer has not yet &s;een the ac|compt.</NOTE>. Thus much for Major Jack&s;on.</P>
<P>Nothing is, in it&s;elf, more comtemptible, and nothing tends more certainly to defeat its own purpo&s;e, than extravagant prai&s;e. Encomium ne|ver appeared in a more farcical &s;hape, than it has often a&s;&s;umed in poetry. Of this &s;ort of writing the Bo&s;ton Federal Orrery afforded a mi&s;erable &s;peci|men, in the <HI>Gratulatory Addre&s;s</HI> on the birth-day of the Pre&s;ident, in February, 1796.</P>
<P>If a &s;tranger knew nothing el&s;e of the hi&s;tory of the American war, than what he could glean from this copy of ver&s;es, he would infer, that General Wa&s;hington had &s;ingly, and exclu&s;ively, extermi|nated the Briti&s;h armies in a per&s;onal combat. In the la&s;t line of the fir&s;t &s;tanza, this rhymer of Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts calls him the <HI>"Godlike Wa&s;hington."</HI> This is &s;omething wor&s;e than mere non&s;en&s;e. It approaches to indecency and profanation.</P>
<P>In the third &s;tanza we meet with a parallel be|tween General Wa&s;hington and &mdash;: let the rea|der, if he can, conjecture the counter part of this compari&s;on! Mo&s;es, the Jew, is introduced as not &s;uperior in legi&s;lative or military merits, to the leader in our revolution. As if that were not
<PB N="37" REF="031906_0045_0FEF42C2DDA42280">
enough, there follows a parallel between the Pre|&s;ident and the Creator of the Univer&s;e; and though this &s;tyle may &s;eem ridiculous, incredible, and mad, it has ab&s;olutely been adopted by the bard of the <HI>Bo&s;ton Federal Orrery.</HI> After alluding to the mi|raculous pa&s;&s;age of the Red &s;ea, he adds, that
<Q><L>"By <HI>night</HI> your pillar, and your <HI>cloud</HI> by day,"</L>
<L>"He (the Pre&s;ident) fought your battles."</L></Q></P>
<P>Here is an attempt to blend the &s;ervices and exer|tions of the American colonies with the omni&s;cient &s;uperintendancy of the Supreme Being. Effrontery or impiety cannot proceed much farther. Of &s;uch panegyri&s;ts, Dr. Edward Young has ob&s;erved, that
<Q><L>"Their prai&s;e degrades, as if a fool &s;hould mean,</L>
<L>"By &s;pitting in your face, to make it clean!</L></Q></P>
<P>For the &s;ake of completene&s;s, our author &s;hould have run a compari&s;on of Mount <HI>Vernon</HI> with Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> the Delaware at Trenton and the Arabian Gulph. Between &s;uch impious jargon and legitimate poetry, there is the &s;ame di&s;tinction as between the trowel of a bricklayer, and the pen|cil of Titian.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, another piece of excel|lence, too &s;ingular to be forgotten, appeared in a Philadelphia new&s;paper. Here it is:
<Q><LG>
<HEAD>ADVICE TO COUNTRY POLITICIANS.</HEAD>
<L>Go weed your corn, and plow your land,</L>
<L>And by Columbia's intere&s;t &s;tand,</L>
<L>Ca&s;t prejudice away;</L>
<L>To able heads leave &s;tate affairs,</L>
<L>Give <HI>railing</HI> o'er and &s;ay your prayers,</L>
<L>For &s;tores of corn and bay.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>This is the fir&s;t &s;tanza of that brilliant production. American farmers are very obligingly advi&s;ed to give over <HI>railing.</HI> The writer mu&s;t by this word mean <HI>remon&s;trating</HI> again&s;t the treaty of Mr. Jay. As to <HI>able</HI> heads, five-&s;ixths of the members of Con|gre&s;s
<PB N="38" REF="031906_0046_0FEF42C52734E550">
are farmers, and hence this admonition ap|plies to them. They had better, as it &s;eems, go home and mind their ploughs. The next and con|cluding &s;tanza runs, or hobbles, in the following words.</P>
<Q><L>"With politics ne'er break your &s;leep,</L>
<L>"But <HI>ring your hogs,</HI> and &s;hear your &s;heep,</L>
<L>"And rear your lambs and calves;</L>
<L>"And Wa&s;hington will take due care,</L>
<L>"That Britons never more &s;hall dare</L>
<L>"Attempt to make you &s;laves."</L></Q>
<P>The felicity of the rhime in <HI>calves</HI> and <HI>&s;laves,</HI> proves that the auricular accuracy of this laureate keeps pace with his other qualifications. It is a very hand&s;ome compliment to the farmers of the United States to tell them that their under&s;tandings are ju&s;t equal to putting a ring into the &s;nout of a hog. The odes of Horace, and Martial's epigrams, were written in the &s;ink of Roman tyranny; yet, they contain no|thing corre&s;pondent with the abject vulgarity of this advice. The piece is, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, a &s;tupid in|&s;ult on the feelings of a free country. This Phila|delphian bard &s;eems a formidable rival to the vi|le&s;t &s;ycophant that ever licked up the &s;pittle of de&s;|poti&s;m.</P>
<P>The people of America boa&s;t loudly of their free|dom, and of their &s;uperiority, in this re&s;pect, to every other nation; yet the &s;pirit of &s;ervility in writing birth-day ver&s;es, exceeds all bounds.</P>
<P>One of the gazettes of this city, after the birth-day in February, 1795, had another piece of the &s;ame &s;habby &s;train. It filled two entire columns; and, which &s;hews the wretchedne&s;s, or rather non-entity of literary ta&s;te, it was printed, <HI>in at lea&s;t one other new&s;paper.</HI></P>
<P>Alluding to the friends of democratic &s;ocieties, this poet calls them <HI>&s;orcerers in their cells.</HI> After

raving through this compari&s;on for a few impudent lines, worthy of Web&s;ter and his Minerva, we are told that

<L>"The mortal hero of the immortal &s;cene.</L></Q></P>
<P>The genius of <HI>Columbia</HI> (this is the new-fangled rhyming name for America), then bounces into the following exclamation:
<Q><L>"Chaos will come, when Wa&s;hington expires,</L>
<L>"Hide Freedom's &s;un, and quench her &s;tarry fires.</L>
<L>"A gift &s;o fatal, why &s;hould I retain?</L>

<L>"No, let the&s;e regions to the deep be hurl'd.</L>

<P>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar found it for his intere&s;t to be bountiful and grateful to Virgil and Horace. Their ver&s;es, like &s;tepping &s;tones acro&s;s the mire, part|ly &s;aved his name from that reproach, through which it has waded down to po&s;terity. The reputation of our Pre&s;ident requires not the help of poetical crutches.

<P>As an evidence of the greatne&s;s of Britain, Cur|tius, No. vii. &s;ays, that her Ea&s;t-India territories <Q>yield an annual revenue of more than eight mil|lions &s;terling.</Q> Camillus, al&s;o, No. vii. lays much weight upon the &s;hips from India to England in 1795, having cargoes <Q>computed to be worth between four and five millions &s;terling.</Q> While an alliance with that country is recommended, and &s;uch accounts given of its wealth and power, only a few words are needful to &s;et the matter right. Three-fourths of this revenue go to the expence of &s;upporting the government of the country; part is ab&s;orbed by inve&s;tments and commercial charges, and the remainder is con&s;umed in paying the inte|re&s;t of the Indian debts of the company. By the late&s;t advices received, on the 16th of June, 1795, from India, they were owing, in that part of the world, &s;even millions three hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling.

<P>With the &s;ame judgment this writer rejects all danger of a Briti&s;h revolution. If England cannot be happy enough to make a peace, &s;he will be ex|cluded from every port in Europe, as &s;he is at pre|&s;ent from two-thirds of them; and then her com|merce and her power mu&s;t decline together. It is worth while to con&s;ider the effects of this turn in her affairs on the &s;ituation of America. One of the con&s;equences mu&s;t be the explo&s;ion of her paper money. The quantity in circulation may be in England about three times, and in Scotland &s;ixty times greater than that of gold and &s;ilver. This is a rough gue&s;s. Every year of war augments the quantity of paper. The fir&s;t effects of a na|tional bankruptcy would be an utter de&s;truction of credit. Currency would again be re&s;tricted to the precious metals; and they would increa&s;e to three, four, or five times the value that they now bear. The &s;ilver &s;ix-pence, which, in London, would not, la&s;t winter, buy a pound of beef, will then purcha&s;e three, four, or five pounds, as was the ca&s;e fifty or an hundred years ago. Hence it follows, that the manufactures of Britain will fall &s;urpri&s;ingly in their prices, becau&s;e the &s;ame quan|tity of labour that formerly was worth half a gui|nea, will then probably be offered for three or four &s;hillings, or le&s;s. Another cau&s;e mu&s;t cheapen Bri|ti&s;h exports. The country being rid of public debt, will, of cour&s;e, ca&s;t off a great proportion of her taxes; for, at this time, including the expence of the collection of revenue to pay its intere&s;t, the
<PB N="44" REF="031906_0052_0FEF42DCCB289528">
debt requires about &s;ixteen millions &s;terling per an|num. Even now the manufactures of the United States cannot, in many ca&s;es, bear a competition in point of cheapne&s;s with tho&s;e of Britain. But a &s;udden fall of one-half of the former rate, or perhaps a &s;till greater reduction mu&s;t put an end to them, unle&s;s their co&s;t can al&s;o be le&s;&s;ened. The price of &s;o many commodities having &s;unk &s;o fa&s;t, they will, of cour&s;e, drag all other kinds of property after them, till matters &s;hall be re&s;tored to their com|mon level, becau&s;e the &s;ituation would be too forced and unnatural for any length of endurance. The price of flour, for example, could not long conti|nue at eight or ten dollars, in America, while En|gland rai&s;ed it for two or three. The value of lands, hou&s;es, and per&s;onal labour &s;inking with &s;uch rapidity would produce numerous failures, and the quantity of money afloat being more than was wan|ted, the precious metals, as on &s;imilar occa&s;ions, would drive paper out of the market. This mu&s;t, in &s;ome degree, give a check to banking: Another cla&s;s of people would &s;uffer e&s;&s;entially, and that is the holders of public &s;tock. From its nature the fall would be more &s;everely felt in this than mo&s;t other property. Land, when equally ploughed, will yield as large a crop as now, whatever might be the want of money. The &s;carcity of hou&s;es in the &s;ea port towns, would prevent them from &s;tan|ding empty. Good trade&s;men are always need|ful and mu&s;t be paid a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. But &s;tock be|ing entirely unproductive of it&s;elf, unle&s;s as to the intere&s;t paid by the public, its decline in price would operate as a real lo&s;s, &s;ince it is only worth what it can bring in the market.</P>
<P>Thus the ruin of the Briti&s;h &s;y&s;tem of funds, and paper money, would run the hazard of &s;ha|king the &s;ame &s;y&s;tems in the United States. This
<PB N="45" REF="031906_0053_0FEF42DE96F4C138">
appears to be the rea&s;on why per&s;ons connected with them have &s;uch a violent prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for Briti&s;h &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;o &s;trong an aver&s;ion to the a&s;cendancy of France. The de&s;truction of public credit in that country, &s;oon after the revolution began, and the mixture of de&s;poti&s;m and anarchy which have &s;ince prevailed, in&s;pired every holder of &s;tocks with horror. A con&s;iderable number of the&s;e public creditors were from the ea&s;tern &s;tates, and but few from the &s;outhern. The whole influence of the fi&s;cal corps, was directed again&s;t the French revolution. As a requi&s;ite counter|poi&s;e, the party wi&s;hed to ca&s;t America into the arms of Britain. The bankers and &s;tock-holders were joined by two other cla&s;&s;es. The one of the&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of Briti&s;h tories, who had been permitted to continue here in the war, or who had returned &s;ince the end of it. Another order of men, in whom the motives of the former were often blended, had frequent occa&s;ion for the di&s;counting of bills, to &s;upport their credit. Within a few years, &s;ince banks became numerous, there has ari&s;en an ex|treme &s;pirit of mercantile &s;peculation, which could only expand its flight on the wings of paper-money. All the&s;e &s;orts of people, with a few exceptions, and all on whom they had influence, joined in re|probating the French revolution. Alexander Ha|milton has always been con&s;idered as the leader of this party. His official powers gave him a very con&s;iderable &s;way in the management of the public funds, and the bank of the United States. Under him, the party have acted, or are thought to have acted with &s;y&s;tem and &s;pirit. But while they were thus loudly declaiming, and often with ju&s;tice, again&s;t the &s;hocking barbarities perpetrated in France, many of them have forfeited their preten|&s;ions to purity, by promoting, to the utmo&s;t of their

&s;kill, a civil war among the United States them&s;elves, and likewi&s;e a quarrel with the republic. Their de&s;igns have been gradually developed by the cour&s;e of events; and it has at length been fairly confe&s;|&s;ed, both by their words and actions, that they are willing to go to war with France. They dread her example as contagious for the de&s;truction of their financial fabric, which they con&s;tantly mention not by its proper name, but as the <HI>con&s;titution.</HI></P>
<P>Having premi&s;ed the&s;e particulars, we &s;hall now quote &s;ome of the expre&s;&s;ions that Curtius adopts in his twelfth letter. <Q>There is a confederation of characters, from New-Hamp&s;hire to Geor|gia, arrayed in oppo&s;ition, either to the con&s;ti|tution of the United States, to its admini&s;tration, or to particular men in office. The oppo&s;ition of the principal men <HI>in this confederacy</HI> can be traced to &s;ome known cau&s;es, originally of a per&s;onal nature. Di&s;appointment in application for &s;ome office, or the failure of &s;ome favourite &s;cheme in their political &s;y&s;tem, has converted many of the friends of the late revolution into determined oppo&s;ers of the general &s;y&s;tem of the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration.</Q></P>
<P>This charge is daily repeated in an infinity of dif|ferent &s;hapes. No facts are &s;pecified by Curtius, except an indi&s;tinct reference to Genet. <Q>The con|duct of this amba&s;&s;ador is entirely unexampled in the hi&s;tory of civilized nations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Carey's edition of Guthrie's Geography, vol. ii. p. 294.</NOTE>.</Q> He was re|ceived with tumultuous ho&s;pitality, and childi&s;h ex|ultation. But when it was di&s;covered that he wanted to plunge the nation into a war with Britain, this envoy in&s;tantly &s;unk into neglect. Curtius &s;ays, <Q>that his views were counteracted by the Pre&s;ident, &s;econded by <HI>the northern &s;tates.</HI></Q> One would
<PB N="47" REF="031906_0055_0FEF42E5CAE40278">
imagine that the militia of New-England had been ordered to march, that the legi&s;latures had taken &s;ome important &s;tep, or at lea&s;t that their members in Congre&s;s had introduced &s;ome motion to the hou&s;e, which led the way for recalling the French mini&s;ter. Not one of the&s;e circum&s;tances ever happened. The impertinence and indi&s;cretion of Genet were, in a few months, vi&s;ible to all men of &s;en&s;e. His importance &s;hrunk immediately to no|thing. As to <HI>&s;econding,</HI> it was manife&s;ted in no way by New-England, unle&s;s &s;currilous new&s;paper para|graphs de&s;erve that name. Even this commodity was as plentifully be&s;towed at New-York and Philadel|phia, as at Bo&s;ton. The reign of Genet was very &s;hort. He arrived in this city on the 17th of May, 1793, and his recall was &s;olicited by the American Secretary of State in a letter dated the 16th of Au|gu&s;t following. This letter, though different in|deed from the &s;tile of Timothy Pickering's epi&s;tle to Pinckney, was as &s;harp as decorum would permit. The one haggles like a ru&s;ty knife. The other cuts like a razor. The next news from France was, that, if Genet had returned home, Robe&s;pierre would have made him look out at <HI>the little national window.</HI> Even the letter de&s;iring his recall was not &s;o much as wrote by a native of New-England, though Henry Knox, as Secretary at War, was then a member of the American cabinet. Neither did Alexander Hamilton, though al&s;o in office, write any part of it; for the di&s;patch has none of his entangled periods. It was drawn by Thomas Jef|fer&s;on of Virginia. The &s;tory of the Pre&s;ident being <HI>&s;econded by the northern &s;tates</HI> is, therefore, an entire fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of Genet has been thus examined, becau&s;e it is the only fact to which Curtius refers. We now go back to his quotation, and &s;hall begin
<PB N="48" REF="031906_0056_0FEF42EAD8B89530">
with what he calls <HI>a confederation of characters ar|rayed again&s;t the con&s;titution, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The mo&s;t eminent per&s;onage of the party accu|&s;ed is Thomas Jeffer&s;on, the &s;ingle man who a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Pre&s;ident in driving Genet out of office. But if the democrats, as, for the &s;ake of di&s;tinction, we mu&s;t call them, were &s;o violently attached to Ge|net, they mu&s;t have held his antagoni&s;t Jeffer&s;on in the utmo&s;t abhorence. Yet this is &s;o far from be|ing the ca&s;e, that, at the di&s;tance of four years, their re&s;pect and friend&s;hip are unabated. Thus, as to Genet, the charge again&s;t the great body of the democrats involves a gro&s;s contradiction. Whe|ther a few individuals do &s;till admire what he did, cannot be worth enquiring. If he was often in the wrong, he was &s;ometimes in the right. The wretched attack made upon him by John Jay and Rufus King was only fit for two old women in a chimney corner. It di&s;graced the national charac|ter of America, by &s;hewing what weak men had been elected as a chief ju&s;tice and a &s;enator.</P>
<P>Curtius &s;peaks of <HI>the principal men in this confede|racy,</HI> and <HI>their di&s;appointment in application for &s;ome office.</HI> Neither can this apply to Jeffer&s;on. He had been amba&s;&s;ador to France. He was then Se|cretary of State. Little more was to be had. Some|time after he re&s;igned his office. The re&s;ignation was voluntary. This appears from the choice of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to him. Randolph was of the &s;ame party and principles; which proves that the Pre&s;ident only cho&s;e him becau&s;e Jeffer&s;on would no longer keep the office.</P>
<P>As to the failure of <HI>&s;ome favourite &s;cheme in their political &s;y&s;tem,</HI> of this al&s;o Mr. Jeffer&s;on &s;tands clear. His retirement was heard of with general regret. Nay, &s;o much does he po&s;&s;e&s;s the confi|dence of every &s;tate in the union, that Mr. Adams
<PB N="49" REF="031906_0057_0FEF421A61262908">
was perhaps the only man on the continent who could have had a tolerable chance again&s;t him for the pre&s;idency. It is &s;ingular that the principal per|&s;on of a confederacy again&s;t government &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the e&s;teem even of its friends.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t enquire among the repre&s;entatives in Congre&s;s for the &s;econd leader of the confederation of characters. This is James Madi&s;on, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> of Vir|ginia. Mr. Vans Murray &s;aid, &s;ome years ago, in Congre&s;s, that he might be called the father of the pre&s;ent con&s;titution. It would be &s;trange if he was al|ready impatient to &s;trangle his own offspring. Of the private character of the man it is needle&s;s to &s;peak, for the &s;tock-holding new&s;papers confine them|&s;elves to an incomprehen&s;ible jargon about con&s;pi|racies. He certainly had no hand in promoting the popularity of citizen Genet. He was in Virginia during the period of the citizen's importance. It is doubtful if they were ever in the &s;ame room toge|ther. The cla&s;&s;ical elegance, and logical acute|ne&s;s of Madi&s;on bear the &s;ame re&s;emblance to the &s;campering fu&s;tian of Genet which Madeira has to ditch-water. It is impo&s;&s;ible that two per&s;ons &s;o contra&s;ted in every thing intellectual could have agreed, for a &s;ingle day, in any confederation. Be|&s;ides, Mr. Madi&s;on is in clo&s;e friend&s;hip with Mr. Jeffer&s;on, who put an end to the citizen. <HI>Di&s;ap|pointment in application for &s;ome office</HI> cannot be imputed to this gentleman, unle&s;s the office can be named which he was di&s;appointed of obtain|ing. Very few places in the gift of the Pre&s;ident would have been a temptation. Mr. Jeffer&s;on did not, as Secretary of State, &s;ave money. By ab&s;ence from his e&s;tate, he very likely lo&s;t as much as he received for re&s;iding in Philadelphia. If Mr. Madi|&s;on had undertaken an office in this city worth two thou&s;and dollars a year, it would have been of no
<PB N="50" REF="031906_0058_0FEF42FB565E8830">
pecuniary advantage to him, while his plantation was lying half wa&s;ted for want of his pre&s;ence. But none of the federal hacks has ever pretended that Mr. Madi&s;on met with a repul&s;e in &s;olicita|tion. They &s;ay that he has been in the pay of France. Yet he ju&s;t now de&s;pitefully gives up his &s;eat in Con|gre&s;s, thus robbing the accu&s;ation of the la&s;t rag which covered its nakedne&s;s. He never had a cent from the government of this country, excepting his &s;ix dollars per day. As to <HI>favourite &s;chemes,</HI> Mr. Madi&s;on, at lea&s;t for the la&s;t four years, has been as often in a majority as out of it.</P>
<P>Thus we have got over the fir&s;t and &s;econd heads of the confederation. The third in order is Wil|liam B. Giles, another Virginian. Almo&s;t all which has been &s;aid of Mr. Madi&s;on &s;uits him. He never applied for any office. Perhaps the execu|tive has not one to be&s;tow, that, in a pecuniary light, would de&s;erve his acceptance. He has an independent fortune. He is a lawyer of eminence. He could make a hand&s;ome income by his pro|fe&s;&s;ion, if he cho&s;e to &s;tay at home, and mind that only. He could live on his own farm in Virginia for a tenth part of the money which he mu&s;t &s;pend in attending Congre&s;s. To &s;uch a man &s;ix dollars a day, or any place that the executive could give him, is not an object; and nothing but &s;heer igno|rance can excu&s;e a party writer for holding &s;uch language about him.</P>
<P>If we look over the other members who have often voted in oppo&s;ition to executive oracles, the &s;ame ob&s;ervations as to per&s;onal indepen|dence apply to perhaps every one of them. For in&s;tance, Gabriel Chri&s;tie is a merchant in Havre de Grace, a village at the mouth of the Su&s;quehan|nah. If he wants to recommence planter, he has a large farm of his own a few miles up the river,
<PB N="51" REF="031906_0059_0FEF42FD13AA7450">
in one of the mo&s;t healthy and de&s;irable &s;pots in Maryland. Such a man could gain nothing by confu&s;ion, nor could the executive offer him almo&s;t any po&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a lucrative tempta|tion. An office in Philadelphia, or any where out of his own country, with a &s;alary of fifteen hun|dred dollars a year would be as a feather. The ca&s;e is &s;imilar with Me&s;&s;rs. Baldwin, Blount, Heath, Page, Parker, New, Nicholas, Macon, M'Dowell, Carnes, Venable, Pre&s;ton, and others. They have either independent property, or lucra|tive profe&s;&s;ions, or both. They could gain nothing by di&s;turbing government. They never made the &s;malle&s;t attempt of the kind; nor has any of the &s;cribblers, who abu&s;ed them in whole&s;ale, ever pretended to &s;pecify a &s;ingle fact, and much le&s;s to bring evidence of a &s;ingle fact, that looked like a confederacy again&s;t government. Such malici|ous non&s;en&s;e may do very well for a Connecticut tavern, a Kennebeck Journal, or a town meeting of Stockbridge, when our patriotic citizens are toa&s;|ting <HI>John Jay and the papers!</HI> It may &s;uit Samuel Dexter in a circle at the dancing &s;chool, or Daniel Buck in an addre&s;s to &s;ome mob, who are ring|ing the town bells for joy at his return to Vermont.</P>
<P>After the words <HI>&s;econded by the northern &s;tates,</HI> Curtius proceeds thus. <Q>But the party which <HI>ori|ginally</HI> rallied under that man, (Genet) &s;till ex|i&s;ts, and forms a league co-exten&s;ive with the United States, connected in all its parts, and act|ing by a &s;ingle impul&s;e.</Q> Dr. Swift, &s;peaking of Gulliver's Travels, &s;ays, that they contained <HI>a lie at every &s;econd word.</HI> If a &s;ingle word could convey an untruth, Curtius would be an unrival|led ma&s;ter in that &s;ort of brevity. The party, &s;uch as it is, exi&s;ted in all its vigour, for &s;everal years before Genet landed on this continent, a fact known
<PB N="52" REF="031906_0060_0FEF42FFB89440C0">
to every per&s;on who has cro&s;&s;ed even the thre&s;hold of American hi&s;tory. As for the <HI>&s;ingle</HI> impul&s;e, if the <HI>confederates</HI> were always to behave to each other with common civility, there might be &s;ome po&s;&s;i|bility of the charge being true. But they are con|&s;tantly differing among them&s;elves on &s;erious topics. For example, Colonel Parker, on the 10th of Fe|bruary, 1797, made an able and earne&s;t &s;peech in defence of the three frigates. He was &s;upported, <HI>manibus pedibu&s;que,</HI> by John Swanwick, who, if cart|loads of &s;lander can be&s;tow di&s;tinction, &s;hines like a &s;tar of the fir&s;t magnitude in the democratical zo|diac. They were oppo&s;ed by three of their con|federates, Me&s;&s;rs. Chri&s;tie, Nicholas, and Giles. The poor frigates were kicked about, as if they had been &s;o many wa&s;hing tubs. Nicholas wi&s;hed them to rot on the &s;tocks, as an in&s;tructive monu|ment of national folly. Chri&s;tie did not care if they were reduced to a&s;hes. Giles declared that he always had oppo&s;ed, and always &s;hould oppo&s;e them, in every &s;tage, and every &s;hape. This is only one in&s;tance out of fifty or an hundred, that occur in every &s;e&s;&s;ion, where the gentlemen &s;tigma|tized as acting by a &s;ingle impul&s;e, do &s;hew very plainly that they value not one farthing the opinions of each other; but &s;peak immediately from their own caprice or conviction. We go back to Curtius.</P>
<P><Q>Thus, in the infancy of our empire, the bane of all republics, is already diffu&s;ed over our coun|try, and <HI>poi&s;ons the whole body politic!</HI></Q> [It is natu|ral that weak or ignorant people &s;hould find their heads half cracked, while they hear of &s;uch terri|ble phantoms.] <Q>Faction is a di&s;ea&s;e, which has pro|ved fatal to all popular governments; but in Ame|rica it has a&s;&s;umed an a&s;pect more formidable than in <HI>any other country.</HI></Q> [He a&s;&s;igns &s;ome fooli&s;h rea|&s;ons, and then adds:] <Q>But in America, faction

<P>Curtius ought to name tho&s;e &s;ecret leaders, and to give &s;ome traits of the progre&s;s of this con&s;piracy. In his labyrinthian &s;tile, it is impo&s;&s;ible ever to take a fa&s;t hold. He is one of the mo&s;t decent wri|ters of the federal party; and this is the univer&s;al way in which they make an a&s;&s;ault on private cha|racters. In the la&s;t four years of chiming, they have hardly advanced four intelligible a&s;&s;ertions. Their charges glide from the gra&s;p of &s;traight inquiry, like the &s;hade of Anchi&s;es from the embrace of his &s;on. The Tom Thumb tale about Fauchet bri|bing Randolph, has been &s;afely conducted to its grave in the American Annual Regi&s;ter. As for the we&s;tern in&s;urrection, Findley, in his hi&s;tory of it, has &s;hewed that Gallatin was &s;o far from being an in&s;urgent, that he had a principal &s;hare in pre|venting mi&s;chief.

<P>There is a con&s;iderable &s;amene&s;s in the dialect of the Hamiltonians.

In the whole country, down to Georgia, you meet with no gazette lying and raving in the &s;tile of Cur|tius and the Columbian Centinel. The Virginians encourage no new&s;printer to balance accounts in black ball with Web&s;ter; or to proclaim the peo|ple of New-England bankrupts, &s;windlers, con&s;pi|rators, and traitors. They are not, with the mono|tony of a magpie, eternally croaking about the danger of rebellion. Their &s;ouls do not &s;it &s;o much upon thorns as tho&s;e of their ea&s;tern fellow citizens. There appears to be le&s;s vinegar in their compo&s;ition. At lea&s;t, by judging from the &s;tate of the pre&s;s, in the&s;e oppo&s;ite quarters of the union, a by&s;tander would make that inference. Envy may have &s;ome &s;hare in this barking. The popu|lation of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Connecticut is &s;tationary, and their territory is but &s;mall.

<P>The relative proportion of exports from the mid|dle and &s;outhern &s;tates has augmented greatly, and mu&s;t continue to do &s;o. Bo&s;ton, formerly as popu|lous as Philadelphia, hath &s;till but about twenty thou&s;and inhabitants, while tho&s;e of its late rival have augmented to &s;ixty thou&s;and. New-York, which formerly was much its inferior, hath fifty thou&s;and. But Baltimore is the mo&s;t provoking in|&s;tance of recent a&s;cendency.

Virginia is twelve times larger than Ma&s;chu&s;etts; and has already double her popula|tion. So great a difference of numbers did not ex|i&s;t in the cen&s;us, of 1775, and it is hourly augmen|ting.

The&s;e two New-England &s;tates are not perhaps plea&s;ed to fore&s;ee the decline of their con&s;equence. Whatever may be the cau&s;e, the rancour of many of their citizens again&s;t the &s;outhern &s;tates appears to be of the bittere&s;t kind. Judging from the Co|lumbian Centinel, a foreigner might be led to believe that the latter have &s;ub&s;cribed a &s;olemn league of revolution; that troops have been rai&s;ed, and ma|gazines formed; that half our citizens are prepa|ring to butcher the re&s;t; that Madi&s;on is a &s;econd Cataline, and Giles a Cae&s;ar Borgia. A con&s;idera|ble minority in New-England agree with the poli|tics of Virginia. In May, 1794, the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton held a very numerous town-meeting, at which, by a great majority, they agreed to recom|mend to Congre&s;s to prolong the embargo. An additional &s;ixty days of famine would have put an effectual end to Briti&s;h piracies in the We&s;t Indies; and would likewi&s;e have been of more &s;ervice to France than an aid of ten thou&s;and land forces, and ten &s;hips of the line. A copy of the Bo&s;ton re&s;olutions, &s;igned by the town clerk, was tran&s;mitted not on|ly to their repre&s;entative, Dr. Ames, but a &s;econd al&s;o, &s;uper&s;cribed to Mr. Madi&s;on, Colonel Parker, and Mr. Giles. This told pretty plainly that they tru&s;ted the three latter gentlemen farther, in that in&s;tance, than their own repre&s;entative. Perhaps, however, this town-meeting con&s;i&s;ted likewi&s;e of <HI>con&s;pirators. Aves unius generis facile congregantur.</HI> The fooli&s;h word <HI>jacobin</HI> is rung in endle&s;s changes;

<P>The calumny of the federal patriots is not confined to the &s;outhern &s;tates. The whi&s;ky riots in the we&s;|tern counties of Penn&s;ylvania have &s;upplied them with a happy fund for declamation. Of their la|bours in this line, accept the following &s;pecimen.</P>
<P>In a Philadelphia new&s;paper of the 8th of March, 1796, there is in&s;erted an extract of a letter, dated Pitt&s;burgh, the 25th of February preceding, which contains unexpected intelligence. The extract extends to one third of a column, and repre&s;ents the we&s;tern counties, as having relap&s;ed into a &s;tate of anarchy. <Q>It is generally believed, &s;ays the writer, that near half the men in this country have cro&s;&s;ed the river to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what|ever land they could get. <HI>This town is almo&s;t empty!</HI> Some large parties are gone with an in|tent to clear all before them, where the land is good. Reports from the woods &s;ay, that a &s;trong party coming to a hou&s;e, they turn out the weak|er, and a &s;tronger coming on turn them out, &s;o that &s;ome hou&s;es <HI>change their owners two or three times a day.</HI></Q> This makes about a fourth part of the extract, which is all exactly in the &s;ame &s;tyle, though &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages &s;oar quite above comprehen|&s;ion.</P>
<P>No farther intelligence about this tumult reach|ed us, till the 28th of March brought forth a &s;e|cond extract of an epi&s;tle from Pitt&s;burgh, dated the 12th of March. It corroborates the former news, affirming that <Q>the poor people are pa&s;|&s;ing the Alleghany in legions with their families <HI>to re&s;ide, and e&s;tabli&s;h actual &s;ettlements,</HI></Q> &amp;c. Both letters, but the &s;econd in particular, have a

multiplicity of ranting bomba&s;tical phra&s;es, which would be apt to make their veracity &s;u&s;pected. Both of them &s;peak much about a Mr. &mdash;, who is doing &s;ome inexplicable wonders. Both contain a profu&s;ion of &s;uch egregious non&s;en&s;e, and malicious fal&s;ehood, that they are in them&s;elves, an hundred and fifty degrees beneath animadver&s;ion.</P>
<P>No further notice was taken in any new&s;paper about this in&s;urrection. Hence it is natural to in|fer that both pieces came from the &s;ame pen, and that both were written with one ra&s;cally view, that of &s;preading a fal&s;e alarm among the people in the Atlantic regions of the union. If &s;uch revolution|ary wonders were going forward, beyond the moun|tains, it was &s;trange that nobody &s;hould hear about them but one corre&s;pondent. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of every good citizen, to pluck up by the roots &s;uch incendiary &s;lander. There &s;eems a double barba|rity in ripping open the &s;car of a wound that is but ju&s;t &s;kinned over.</P>
<P>The bad effect of &s;uch reports was very well de&s;cribed in Congre&s;s by Mr. Baldwin. On the 1&s;t of December, 1794, this gentlemen ob&s;erved that in a country &s;o exten&s;ive as America, and where the people are &s;o widely &s;cattered, it was a work of immen&s;e difficulty to have a regular and accu|rate account of the mea&s;ures of government com|municated through every part of the union. It can &s;carcely be conceived, &s;aid he, by tho&s;e who have no call to vi&s;it the interior and more retired parts of the country, how much the peace of &s;ociety is di&s;turbed by the malicious propagation of poli|tical fal&s;ehood. The mo&s;t wicked lies are kept in circulation, for months together, and before they can be effectually contradicted, the people have be|come almo&s;t frantic. For example, Mr. Baldwin mentioned, (and editors of new&s;papers in every
<PB N="58" REF="031906_0066_0FEF42243AC4D490">
part of the union, ought to quote this part of his ob&s;ervations, as a <HI>caveat</HI> in future,) that it had been a&s;&s;erted that a poll tax of forty &s;hillings per head, has been laid on all the inhabitants, that the exci&s;e has been extended to <HI>wheat,</HI> to <HI>looms,</HI> and to in|&s;truments of hu&s;bandry, and that the late draughts of the eighty thou&s;and militia, are &s;old to France to carry on the war! It is probable, that riots and in&s;urrections are fomented by the&s;e rumours more than by all other cau&s;es. If a con&s;tant and regular publication of all that is done could reach every part of the United States, it would be an effectual, and, perhaps the only cure for the&s;e mi&s;chiefs. The people of this exten&s;ive country have, for the&s;e ten years, enjoyed all the e&s;&s;ential benefits of &s;ociety, on very ea&s;y terms. A man with five or &s;ix hundred acres of land is &s;carcely called upon for a dollar of taxes in a year. Per|haps no people on earth ever enjoyed &s;o fully the advantages of &s;ociety with &s;o few burdens. Is it not a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing con&s;ideration, that when we have &s;o few real evils, we &s;hould create to our&s;elves ima|ginary ones, that give us &s;o much u&s;ele&s;s unea&s;ine&s;s? Some wrong mea&s;ures have taken place, and here|after will take place, and nobody can expect that any kind of conduct will give <HI>univer&s;al</HI> &s;atisfaction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the cour&s;e of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this day, Mr. Hillhou&s;e ha|ving &s;poke for &s;ome time, Mr. Dayton ro&s;e next.

On the 2d of March, 1795, Mr. Harper &s;aid in Congre&s;s that the &s;ale covered thirty millions of acres of the fine&s;t land in the world, and mo&s;t admirably &s;ituated for commerce and emigration.

<P>The following is another anecdote of oppre&s;&s;ion, and of &s;o &s;ingular a kind, that it ought to be recor|ded for the honour of the eighteenth century. A negro man from the coa&s;t of Guinea had been &s;old to a farmer on the &s;outhern line of North-Caroli|na. In the fall of 1793, he applied to a black boy and girl, the property of an adjacent planter, to give him &s;ome victuals. In return he a&s;&s;ured them that he would perform a charm to &s;often the &s;eve|rity of their ma&s;ter. He gave them a calliba&s;h full of the feathers and claws of birds, mixed with negro men's nails. This was buried under the thre&s;hold of the planter's door. He was, at that time &s;ick, or fell ill &s;oon after; and having ordered the boy to be puni&s;hed for &s;ome offence, the latter &s;aid that, if he was pardoned, he would tell what had made his ma&s;ter ill. The concealment was im|mediately di&s;covered, along with &s;ome of the &s;ame materials which had been &s;tuck about the &s;ick man's bed. The necromancer was con&s;equently taken up. This was on a Saturday. He was tried on the next Monday, by a jury of three free-holders, convicted of witchcraft, and hanged on the Tue&s;|day. The boy and girl were whipt and branded in the forehead with a red hot iron. One of the&s;e children was eleven, and the other thirteen years of age. The &s;tory has made noi&s;e, and an indi&s;|tinct account of it with &s;ome remarks, appeared

<P>We &s;hall clo&s;e this chapter with a few mi&s;cel|laneous remarks. In the profound debates of De|cember, 1796, about <HI>whether Americans were the free&s;t and mo&s;t enlightened people in the world,</HI> Dr. Ames &s;aid that, by all which he could learn, the people in Europe who <HI>could</HI> read were but as nume|rous as tho&s;e in America who could <HI>not</HI> read. In plainer words, he meant to &s;tate that the people in the new world had twenty times more commonly a decent education than tho&s;e in the old one. Mr. Giles agreed with him in thinking that Americans were wi&s;er than the re&s;t of mankind, but he did not believe it mode&s;t or becoming to divulge the &s;ecret; for a &s;ecret it hitherto has been, and, &s;ince the re&s;olution was negatived, it is likely to remain &s;o. The very morning after the doctor made the above remark, Mr. Bache printed a deci&s;ive &s;peci|men of the &s;uperiority of the American intellect. A woman in New-Hamp&s;hire was accu&s;ed, and per|&s;ecuted for being a witch. A man who had beaten her, was, ju&s;t before this debate, brought to trial.

<P>The writer &s;ets out by alluding to the <HI>di&s;graced</HI> &s;ituation of Congre&s;s and our country. A majority in the hou&s;e are <Q>li&s;ted <HI>under</HI> Madi&s;on and Galla|tin; or rather Gallatin and Madi&s;on, for the lat|ter has <HI>become &s;o changed</HI> as to be only a &s;econd to the former, a devoted tool to him in <HI>overturn|ing the government.</HI>&mdash;A majority of the hou&s;e are arrayed, <HI>under &s;uch</HI> leaders, to oppo&s;e and <HI>pull down the Pre&s;ident.</HI> Their aim is to <HI>de&s;troy the executive,</HI> to u&s;urp to the hou&s;e all the power given by the con&s;titution to them exclu&s;ively.</Q></P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, or a majority of them, have never been <HI>li&s;ted</HI> under Mr. Madi&s;on or any body el&s;e; as little has Mr. Madi&s;on been li&s;ted under Mr Gallatin, as <HI>a devoted tool</HI> to aid him in <HI>overturning the government.</HI> No rea&s;on is a&s;|&s;igned, and no proof is offered, that a majority in Congre&s;s had any &s;uch de&s;ign; and the re&s;ult &s;hew|ed that a majority of the repre&s;entatives would &s;ub|mit to ratify the treaty. What then becomes of their pretended <HI>enli&s;tment?</HI></P>
<P>As for <HI>pulling down</HI> of the Pre&s;ident, the ex|pre&s;&s;ion is highly impertinent, and intended only to inflame the feelings of the public. Did a Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons ever &s;cruple, or did they even forbear, to di&s;cu&s;s the merits of a foreign treaty? No! And yet it &s;eems that to do &s;o in America is to <HI>pull down</HI> the Pre&s;ident, and <HI>overturn</HI> the con|&s;titution. If the conduct of Congre&s;s in making this enquiry was culpable, the con&s;titution is <HI>de fac|to</HI> overturned already. It is laid in ruins at the feet of the executive. The writer goes on to tell us that, &s;ince 1781, Mr. Madi&s;on has been <HI>a devoted tool to the French intere&s;t and government, the ab|ject

<P>There is more ribbaldry to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and all equally impudent and non&s;en&s;ical.

<P>If the citizens of New-England are &s;o much wi|&s;er than their neighbours, it mu&s;t certainly appear in the choice of their repre&s;entatives in Congre&s;s. The &s;uperiority is not always con&s;picuous. In the debate on the &s;nuff exci&s;e, in &s;pring 1794, &s;ome mem|bers from that part of the union, and e&s;pecially Mr. Sedgwick, affirmed, that a land tax was inju&s;t and <HI>impracticable,</HI> and that Americans <HI>would never &s;ubmit to it</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The words were taken down at the time, by the author.</NOTE>.

<P>The&s;e remarks have occurred on reading the ac|count of a very melancholy affair which took place in the latter end of February, 1796, at Hingham, in the &s;tate of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. The following par|ticulars of it are abridged from a letter written by one of the profe&s;&s;ors in the univer&s;ity at Cambridge, dated the 23d of February, and printed in a late Bo&s;ton new&s;paper.</P>
<P>About two months before the date of the letter, a young foreigner called on this profe&s;&s;or, and in|troduced him&s;elf by &s;aying, that he wanted to be|come acquainted with &s;ome &s;cientific man. The &s;ubject which he brought on was pneumatics and mechanics. He conver&s;ed with the profe&s;&s;or flu|ently, in French, Dutch, and Latin. After a con|ference, of which part is related, he took his leave, and, by agreement, paid a &s;econd vi&s;it to the profe&s;|&s;or in three days. We &s;hall now quote <HI>verbatim</HI> a part of the account of him, as given by the wri|ter of the letter.</P>
<P><Q>From his good figure, polite and ea&s;y manners, I concluded he was &s;ome unfortunate emigrant from the continent of Europe, probably in the &s;ervice of the monarchy, <HI>who, de&s;titute of money and friends,</HI> cho&s;e to apply &s;ome of the princi|ples he had learnt at college, to the purpo&s;e of <HI>procuring &s;ub&s;i&s;tence</HI> by a novel exhibition. <HI>On this account,</HI> I never a&s;ked him his name or na|tion?</Q></P>
<P>On what account? He was de&s;titute of money and friends, and he wanted to procure &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by the exhibition of a novel mechanical apparatus;
<PB N="72" REF="031906_0080_0FEF4317771881E8">
and, <HI>therefore,</HI> this American philo&s;opher did not venture to a&s;k him his name or nation.</P>
<Q>"'Twas pitiful! 'twas wond'rous pitiful!"</Q>
<P>That the profe&s;&s;or in a college &s;hould be capable of mean ungentlemany conduct, we know by fre|quent per&s;onal experience; but, that any man &s;hould wi&s;h to bring him&s;elf forward to the public in &s;o humiliating a point of view, is rather uncom|mon. Is it a crime to be in want of money? Is it culpable to attempt earning &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by exhibit|ing an apparatus of mechani&s;m? Both the&s;e <HI>liberal</HI> and <HI>manly</HI> doctrines are avowed by this Cambridge profe&s;&s;or. Such treatment of a foreigner, a man of learning, and, above all, a fellow creature in di&s;|tre&s;s, is di&s;graceful not only to the individual who acted &s;o, but, from his alacrity in telling the &s;tory, it reflects a &s;arca&s;m on the country to which he be|longs. A reader in Europe will be tempted to think very meanly of the general ca&s;t of our ideas. Was the profe&s;&s;or afraid that this foreigner would eclip&s;e him in the eyes of his pupils, by his inten|ded &s;hew? How ea&s;y would it have been for the profe&s;&s;or to have found employment of &s;ome de|cent kind for a well educated man, who under&s;tood four languages! It is tru&s;ted that every reader will heartily de&s;pi&s;e &s;uch a fro&s;t-bitten pedagogue.</P>
<P>The chilling reception that he encountered, was undoubtedly the rea&s;on why this ill-fated wander|er fell into de&s;pair, and &s;hot him&s;elf. He left a letter addre&s;&s;ed to the profe&s;&s;or, wherein he &s;tates, that his want of money, and the failure of his plans for obtaining &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, had determined him to put an end to his life.</P>
<P>The profe&s;&s;or &s;peaks of him thus:</P>
<P><Q>The writings and drawings which he left di|rected to me, are &s;o far from evincing a derang|ed mind, that they intimate a cool and vigor|ous

<P>The profe&s;&s;or concludes by citing the exit of this gentleman as a proof, that <Q><HI>nature,</HI> without the commanding voice of <HI>religion,</HI> has left the noble&s;t of her works imperfect.</Q> What part of the chri&s;tian religion taught this per&s;on to keep a &s;tranger at a di&s;tance, becau&s;e he is in di&s;tre&s;s? To repel &s;uch &s;ordid ideas, and to extend the feelings of humanity, is the only intelligible or rational purpo&s;e of religion.</P>
<P>The name of this victim to ra&s;hne&s;s was <HI>Iberkin.</HI> He was probably a German, there is, at lea&s;t, &s;uch a name in Pru&s;&s;ia. The letter-writer is Dr. Ben|jamin Waterhou&s;e, Profe&s;&s;or of Medicine at Cam|bridge. Leyden gave him education; Rhode-I&s;land had the di&s;honour of his birth.</P>
<P>The people of New-England boa&s;t much of their &s;uperior ho&s;pitality to &s;trangers; of which this anecdote holds up a &s;hocking &s;ample.</P>
<P>Before this &s;orry pedant &s;peaks a &s;econd time of <HI>religion,</HI> let him read the parable of <HI>the good Sa|maritan.</HI> In the Levite, <HI>who pa&s;&s;ed by on the other &s;ide,</HI> he will trace the intellectual pedigree of his own mind. When &s;uch a character pre&s;ents it&s;elf to mankind, as a paragon of <HI>piety,</HI> it is both our right and duty to wrench the vizor from the features of deformity, and to admini&s;ter that typographical drubbing, which has been &s;o hardily courted, and &s;o richly de&s;erved.</P>

<P>AMONG other artifices employed by the federal party to exa&s;perate the people of this country again&s;t the French republic, one is, their a&s;&s;ertion that the United States were indebted for the aid of France to the per&s;onal benevolence of Louis. This is con&s;tantly held up as a rea&s;on for dete&s;ting the revolution; and mountains of ribbaldry have, from that ground, been di&s;charged on its authors. Some notice has already been taken of this error<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Briti&s;h Honour and Humanity, p. 14. American Annual Re|gi&s;ter, chap. viii.</NOTE>. Mr. Burke, in the letters above quoted, goes fully through it. He &s;ays that even when Louis came to the throne, <Q>the revolution &s;trongly operated in all its cau&s;es.</Q> The politicians of France had been compelled to de&s;pi&s;e their kings. <Q>From quarrelling with the court, they began to com|plain

of <HI>monarchy it&s;elf;</HI> as a &s;y&s;tem of govern|ment too variable for any regular plan of nation|al aggrandizement. They ob&s;erved, that, in that &s;ort of regimen, too much depended on the per&s;onal character of the prince.&mdash;They compa|red with mortification the &s;y&s;tematic proceedings of a Roman Senate with the fluctuations of a <HI>monarchy.</HI>&mdash;What cure for the radical weak|ne&s;s of the French <HI>monarchy,</HI> but in <HI>a republic?</HI> Out the word came; and it never went back.&mdash; The different effects of a great military and am|bitious republic, and of a monarchy of the &s;ame de&s;cription were con&s;tantly in their mouths.</Q> After a long detail of circum&s;tances, Edmund goes on in the&s;e words: <Q>The&s;e &s;entiments were not pro|duced, as &s;ome think, by their American alli|ance. The American alliance was produced by their <HI>republican</HI> principles and <HI>republican</HI> policy.</Q> Several pages are &s;pent on this &s;ubject, and every thing proves that the alliance of France with Ame|rica was the work of the republican party, not of the king. After this explanation, no man who prefers truth to fiction will deafen the public about their obligations to Louis, or the guilt of putting him to death. It was at wor&s;t not more criminal than the unavenged murder &s;o lately com|mitted in the jail of Philadelphia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">American Annual Regi&s;ter, chap. X.</NOTE>. We print week|ly whole columns of reproach again&s;t French ar|mies; yet, when five thou&s;and of the&s;e troops mar|ched down Front-&s;treet, in their way to the capture of Cornwallis, it is &s;till remembered with what pro&s;tration of gratitude they were welcomed by the &s;urrounding citizens. The French amba&s;&s;ador was looked up to as a tutelar divinity. His landing from Europe was announced by the di&s;charge of cannon, by fire-works and illuminations. His pre|&s;ence

was e&s;&s;ential at every public entertainment. He was the arbiter of politics, of fa&s;hion, and of ta&s;te. But our turn has been &s;erved, and citizen Adet can de&s;cribe the rever&s;e of the medal. Daniel Defoe, &s;peaking of his country, &s;ays:
<Q><L>"Ingratitude, a devil of black renown,</L>
<L>"Po&s;&s;e&s;s'd her very early as <HI>his own!</HI>"</L></Q></P>
<P>Yet there is nothing quite &s;o paltry as this con|duct of ours, even in the &s;able hi&s;tory of England. In a compari&s;on with Briti&s;h armies, the French cannot lo&s;e much. When Howe landed at the head of Elk, many per&s;ons in that neighbourhood had pre|pared the be&s;t entertainment which they could af|ford for the reception of their deliverers. They brought the Engli&s;h &s;oldiers to their tables. The in&s;tant that dinner was over, the gue&s;ts began to plunder. It was affirmed, at the time, that in an extent of a few miles, they took away &s;ixteen hun|dred hor&s;es. It was a common practice, when one of the regulars met an American, to a&s;k him the time of day. When he pulled out his watch, it was wre&s;ted from his fingers. The tories were &s;o much a&s;hamed of this treatment, that they were never heard to complain, and at the di&s;tance of twenty years, many of them are yet as firm in loyalty as ever.</P>
<P>Alexander Hamilton and Co. are in the habit of making compari&s;ons between France and England to the advantage of the latter. A celebrated wri|ter of the federal phalanx ob&s;erves, that the French <Q>have ran&s;acked the coffers of the rich, &s;tripped poverty of its very rags, robbed the infant of its birth-right, wrenched the crutch from tot|tering old age, and, joining &s;acrilege to burgla|ry, have plundered the altars of God<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A New Year's Gift for the Democrats, p. 1.</NOTE>.</Q> All this, and much more is true; and declamations of that &s;ort have been a powerful means with the Bri|ti&s;h

<P>This is a &s;ufficient reply to the endle&s;s barking of Web&s;ter and Camillus about jacobin principles. Let us add one word more about this war of 1739. Guthrie &s;ays, that the Engli&s;h took three thou&s;and four hundred and thirty-four prizes. They lo&s;t three thou&s;and two hundred and thirty-eight. Thus we learn that a navy cannot protect an exten|&s;ive commerce. Engli&s;h trade has, in the pre&s;ent &s;truggle, &s;uffered &s;till more &s;everely. A Briti&s;h navy of &s;ix hundred &s;ail cannot &s;ecure Briti&s;h &s;hip|ping. Six frigates have an hundred times le&s;s ca|pability to protect the commerce of America.</P>

<P>One ince&s;&s;ant reproach to the French has been the breach of public credit. Our ally is de&s;cen|ding, with ha&s;ty leaps, to the &s;ame level. On the 27th of February, 1797, the privy council of George the third, by an arbitrary order, forbade the bank of England <Q>from i&s;&s;uing any ca&s;h in payment, until the &s;en&s;e of parliament could be taken on that &s;ubject.</Q> The rea&s;on given is, an apprehen|&s;ion of <Q>a want of &s;ufficient ca&s;h to an&s;wer the exigencies of the <HI>public</HI> &s;ervice.</Q> If government had forbidden the bank to pay gold and &s;ilver as the intere&s;t of the public debt, this would have been no wor&s;e than a &s;imple confe&s;&s;ion of bank|ruptcy. But they &s;tep in between the bank and its private creditors, and &s;ay, <Q>You &s;hall not pay your private debts. We mu&s;t have the money to pay our own &s;alaries, and to &s;upport our &s;tanding armies; to defray the charge of barracks built in defiance of law; and to clear off the bills of a prince who has defrauded his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, in&s;ul|ted his two wives, <HI>who are both alive</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Briti&s;h Honour and Humanity, p. 44.</NOTE>! hired new&s;papers to calumniate his mother, and at|tempted to keep his father for life in a &s;trait wai&s;t|coat.</Q></P>
<P>Parliament have an equal right to interfere between any debtor and creditor in the kingdom. Thus, all the requi&s;itions of Robe&s;pierre are rivalled at a &s;ingle &s;troke.

iniquity. It is as exten&s;ive in its operation, as de|te&s;table in its object. Every individual in Britain will feel the effects of this &s;toppage. A&s;&s;ociations of bankers and manufacturers may, and will for a time, keep up the price of paper; but the fir&s;t loan wanted for 1798, will ring the knell to its inter|ment.</P>
<P>The act of parliament that has followed this or|der of council, affects, in a tender point, the mer|cantile intere&s;t of the United States; and, as &s;hall be pre&s;ently explained, it &s;trikes at one of the pil|lars of the Briti&s;h treaty. Much pains are employ|ed to repre&s;ent it as of a temporary nature, and to convince the public that credit will quickly come round to the former &s;ituation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The tories who &s;ay &s;o do not believe it. The rate of exchange on England was formerly above par, which is one hundred and &s;ixty-&s;ix and two thirds per cent. It has now (May 10th, 1797,) &s;unk to an hundred and twenty-five, and an hundred and thirty. When a bill returns under prote&s;t from England, the indor&s;ee is intitled to twenty per cent. of damages. People now refu&s;e to grant &s;uch bills, unle&s;s with this provi&s;o, that they &s;hall not be liable to the u&s;ual pe|nalty of non-payment.</NOTE>. On this account, it cannot be regarded as de&s;ultory to &s;tate, in this place, &s;ome deci&s;ive facts, of which a few are not generally known in America.</P>
<P>The national bankruptcy of England is not a matter which has come &s;uddenly to a cri&s;is. Its inevitable approach was di&s;tinctly fore&s;een and de&s;cribed. Mr. William Morgan, an eminent writer on Engli&s;h finances, publi&s;hed, in the begin|ning of 1796, <HI>Facts addre&s;&s;ed to the people of Great Britain.</HI> From a long &s;eries of arguments and cal|culations, the following particulars have been a|bridged.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt e&s;timates the yearly rents of all the landed e&s;tates in Britain, at twenty-five millions
<PB N="82" REF="031906_0090_0FEF4327B511B180">
&s;terling. But the land tax, at four &s;hillings in the pound, though comprehending hou&s;es, places, and pen&s;ions, gives only one million nine hundred thou|&s;and pounds. Mr. Morgan believes that the yearly rents do not exceed eighteen millions. The ac|tual expen&s;es wanted, in 1796, even for a <HI>peace</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hment, were twenty-two millions. Thus, even a year ago, the public taxes were equal to the whole landed rents of Britain. It was, howe|ver, found difficult or impo&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e the twen|ty-two millions e&s;&s;ential for the national credit, even &s;uppo&s;ing that the war had ended in January, 1796. In February, 1795, taxes were laid to the expected amount of &s;ixteen hundred and forty-five thou&s;and pounds. In December following, others were al&s;o <HI>propo&s;ed</HI> to the amount of eleven hun|dred and twenty-three thou&s;and pounds. Yet the intere&s;t of many millions of debt &s;till remained to be <HI>provided for.</HI> From the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of the con&s;olidated fund, in 1786, till the commence|ment of the pre&s;ent war, the expenditure invaria|bly exceeded the <HI>revenue.</HI> The deficiencies in the &s;ix years preceding the war, amounted to nearly &s;even millions &s;terling. The blank was &s;upplied by loans, and extraordinary but ca&s;ual receipts. In the fir&s;t three years of the war, new taxes were laid to the amount of about four millions, and &s;till the annual deficiencies increa&s;ed. In 1795, they came nearly to <HI>two millions.</HI>
<Q>It is probable, there|fore, &s;ays Mr. Morgan, that <HI>annual loans</HI> will become nece&s;&s;ary, in future, to provide for the ordinary expences of a peace e&s;tabli&s;hment; and the&s;e loans, by requiring new taxes, will produce further deficiencies; &s;o that, by borrow|ing each year, not only to pay the deficiencies of the preceding year, but al&s;o the intere&s;t on the deficiencies in former years, the national debt
<PB N="83" REF="031906_0091_0FEF4329F8E49EF8">
will be increa&s;ing, at compound intere&s;t, in the &s;ame manner as it is reduced; but with this alarming difference, that the operations in the one ca&s;e, are ten times more powerful than in the other. If the&s;e are likely to be the effects of the public debt, with the expenditure only of a <HI>peace</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hment, or on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the war were immediately clo&s;ed, what mu&s;t be the con&s;equences of ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ting in a &s;y&s;tem of profu&s;ion, which, if long continued, would ruin any country, however unimpaired its &s;trength and re&s;ources?</Q></P>
<P>Men who de&s;ire u&s;eful knowledge will not tire of this quotation. It is certainly better entertain|ment than to ring invidious changes on the purity of Connecticut<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The hi&s;tory of the new &s;tate-hou&s;e at Hartford, exhibits a de|lectable &s;pecimen of this commodity. The a&s;&s;embly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a claim on the &s;tate of New-York for almo&s;t fifteen hundred thou&s;and acres of land, which are worth three or four millions of dollars. In 1795, they &s;old this claim for a few thou&s;and pounds, to a private company. See American Annua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Regi&s;ter, chap. x. If they be|lieved their title to be groundle&s;s, they were no better than a gang of coiners, who &s;ell b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d &s;hillings at half price. If the law-&s;uit of this company &s;hall be &s;ucce&s;sful, New-York will hardly &s;ubmit to the deci&s;ion, but on the point of the bayonet. Thus it follows, that for the dirty con&s;ideration of a few thou&s;and pounds, the legi&s;lature of Connecticut has put the union in danger of a civil war. With the&s;e facts before their eyes, and with an effrontery that tran&s;cends all de&s;cription, many writers extol the &s;uperlative <HI>federali&s;m</HI> of Con|necticut; and poor Samuel Dexter, as one of his rea&s;ons for &s;up|porting the &s;ugar and &s;nuff exci&s;e, &s;aid in Congre&s;s, in 1794, that all the members of that &s;tate voted for it.</P>
<P>If from the a&s;&s;embly them&s;elves, we turn to their con&s;tituents, the pro&s;pect does not improve. The &s;ale of the&s;e fifteen hundred thou&s;and acres, if the &s;tate had a real right to them, was an act of outrageous robbery on their fellow citizens; it was a &s;econd Yazoo bu&s;ine&s;s. When the people of Georgia found their property invaded, they elected a new a&s;&s;embly, era&s;ed the &s;windling law from the pub|lic records, proclaimed its infamous authors, and ordered their at|torney-general to pro&s;ecute &s;enator James Gunn, as one of the con|&s;pirators. This was acting like men; but the citizens of Connecti|cut, when in a &s;imilar &s;ituation, truckle under legi&s;lative treachery; while Pelham, and Trumbull, and Web&s;ter, and a &s;warm of other &s;cribblers from that quarter, rack their ingenuity in reviling, as a race of inferior and degraded beings, the people of the &s;outhern &s;tates.</P></NOTE>, and the wickedne&s;s of Virginia. Since the&s;e remarks were publi&s;hed by Mr. Mor|gan, a campaign has elap&s;ed more di&s;a&s;trous, if po&s;&s;ible, to England, than any of the former. Her &s;ituation has, uniformly, &s;unk from bad to wor&s;e.

and his auxiliaries, about Briti&s;h pride, and power, and opulence, have become too de&s;picable for refutation. If Camillus really believed what he wrote re&s;pecting them, he mu&s;t have been ve|ry ignorant. If he knew more than he cho&s;e to tell, his conduct demands a har&s;her name. Ano|ther citation from Mr. Morgan will, perhaps, re|pay a peru&s;al.</P>
<P><Q>The competition of rapacious loan-mongers to &s;hare in the &s;poils of the country, &s;upported by the <HI>fictitious</HI> credit of paper-money, may perhaps enable the mini&s;ter to triumph in the facility with which the public debts are accumulated, and the tempori&s;ing expedient of ineffectual taxation may &s;erve him as a proof of our inexhau&s;tible re|&s;ources to provide for tho&s;e taxes; but a &s;y&s;tem founded upon delu&s;ion, mu&s;t end in di&s;appoint|ment and ruin. It was the boa&s;t of a French mini&s;ter of finance, that the American war was carried on during his admini&s;tration, without impo&s;ing a new tax upon the French people; and it was this very circum&s;tance which produced
<PB N="85" REF="031906_0093_0FEF432BC73AC0F8">
the revolution. He borrowed immen&s;e &s;ums an|nually, and endeavoured to provide for them by the ineffectual means of economy; for, in that country, taxation had then arrived at its limits. A &s;y&s;tem of economy, under a government which exi&s;ted by corruption, nece&s;&s;ary failed. New loans became nece&s;&s;ary to pay the intere&s;t of for|mer loans. The ma&s;s of debt continued to ac|cumulate, till at length it overwhelmed public credit, and buried the government in its ruins.</Q></P>
<P>As the government and the bank of England can|not at pre&s;ent command &s;pecie, the next que&s;tion is, at what time, or from what &s;ource, have they a pro&s;pect of getting it? The debts of the former are about three hundred and eighty millions &s;ter|ling. Paine gue&s;&s;es the paper of the bank of En|gland at &s;ixty millions. Several other great banks had &s;topt before it, and the banks of Scotland and that of Ireland, have &s;topt &s;ince. In an affair of uncertainty, but of enormous magnitude, we may conjecture that eighty millions &s;terling, in bank notes have been blocked up. This added to the debt will make four hundred and &s;ixty millions. Oppo&s;ed to this world of paper, George Chalmers, an autho|rity to be tru&s;ted in this ca&s;e, &s;ays, that the Briti&s;h dominions have a circulation of twenty millions in gold and &s;ilver. Thus credit &s;tands like an inver|ted pyramid, of which paper is the ba&s;e. But &s;ince that calculation, the quantity of hard money has been reduced. Be&s;ides, every guinea, and eve|ry &s;ixpence, will now hide it&s;elf. Suppo&s;e that the bank has at pre&s;ent in its coffers two millions &s;terling, and that this money is to be re&s;erved for public exigencies. Two months only of the ap|proaching campaign will exhau&s;t it. The ca&s;h will dive into the pockets of tho&s;e who furni&s;h the &s;upplies, and they will hold it, with the gripe of
<PB N="86" REF="031906_0094_0FEF43763A435C08">
death, till the alarm has become to an i&s;&s;ue. It is hard to &s;ee from whence money can be expected. The emperor will not replace his wages. In the mean while, confidence mu&s;t by degrees decline. Trade&s;men mu&s;t be thrown idle, from the want of a proper medium to pay them; and, after every ex|pedient has been tried, an univer&s;al bankruptcy will en&s;ue. Unle&s;s France &s;hall grant England a peace, the campaign of 1798 will require another loan. Paper cannot be &s;ent to the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies, even were its character &s;ound at home. The precious metals cannot be had, and public credit will of nece&s;&s;ity expire. We &s;ee that &s;ix years be|fore the war, the mini&s;ter after every exertion, was annually borrowing great part of a million &s;terling to pay the intere&s;t of old debts. This practice alone would, in time, have produced in&s;ol|vency; but, when there is &s;uperadded the hi&s;tory of the la&s;t four years, probability ri&s;es to demon|&s;tration. In 1791, Mr. Rayment publi&s;hed a &s;tatement of the number of the public creditors of England, taken from the books. It amounted to an hundred and twenty-&s;even thou&s;and three hun|dred and one per&s;ons&punc; About an hundred and twen|ty or thirty millions &s;terling have been added to the debt, &s;o that we may now compute the credi|tors as being at lea&s;t an hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and. The bankruptcies of 1793 came perhaps to twenty millions &s;terling. Tho&s;e made by the &s;toppage of paper money will be at lea&s;t twenty times greater. Every man in Britain, who is worth five guineas, will be affected more or le&s;s. The &s;hock mu&s;t convul&s;e every nerve in the ma&s;s of property. Thus much for Briti&s;h credit. We now come to apply the&s;e remarks with re&s;pect to Jay's treaty. The Philadelphian addre&s;s to the Pre&s;ident, thanking him for having &s;igned it, &s;peaks of <Q>indemnity

The <HI>indemnity</HI> addre&s;|&s;ers of Philadelphia drop not one word of alarm or &s;ympathy for the dangers or &s;ufferings of &s;ome thou&s;ands of mariners. On the 14th of April, 1797, al&s;o, when the merchants of Philadelphia
<PB N="89" REF="031906_0097_0FEF43364D3491C8">
pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to Congre&s;s in favour of the treaty, that paper contains not one glimmering of compa&s;&s;ion or even of reference to the &s;ufferings of their &s;eamen. Five millions of dollars, and <Q>the principal part of their remaining <HI>fortunes,</HI></Q> form the exclu&s;ive burden of the &s;ong. Never did the &s;ordid &s;pirit of mercantile adventure di&s;play it&s;elf in more repul&s;ive colours. Woe be to that coun|try who&s;e coun&s;els are governed by merchants, or by prie&s;ts! When the Senate &s;aw an article about the We&s;t Indian trade which they did not like, they refu&s;ed to accept it. But they overlooked this hideous cha&s;m about &s;eamen, though in every view of ju&s;tice, honour, humanity, and even of commer|cial intere&s;t, it was by many degrees more impor|tant than the other. This is preci&s;ely the way in which Congre&s;s and the country have treated their old continental &s;oldiers; &s;o that no part of our en|lightened citizens has a title to condemn the re&s;t.</P>
<P>It may be an&s;wered, <HI>but what could you do!</HI> The reply is ready. The immediate re&s;toration of every American &s;eaman, or a &s;erious and vigorous effort to that end, &s;hould have been demanded and obtained, before making a &s;ingle clau&s;e of any treaty. Farther, every one of them &s;hould have received a liberal compen&s;ation for the time during which they had been confined in Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els. We have not heard of &s;uch compen&s;ation being either given, or &s;ought. If any &s;cruple was to be entertained on the part of Britain about making &s;uch reparation, it contradic|ted common rea&s;on to believe that negociation with &s;uch people could end in &s;atisfaction. Figure the ca&s;e that a crimp kidnaps your &s;on on the &s;treets of London, and &s;ends him to the Ea&s;t Indies as a re|cruit. This offender owns the fact, and without engaging to re&s;tore the young man, he a&s;ks you to enter into an agreement for a freight of cotton or

tobacco. You would not li&s;ten to &s;uch a propo&s;al till &s;ecurity was given for the redemption of your &s;on; or, if you did li&s;ten, the whole world would pronounce you an unnatural barbarian. Of Briti&s;h impre&s;&s;ments, the following in&s;tance is not, perhaps, wor&s;e nor better than an hundred others. It is in|&s;erted merely as a &s;ample.</P>
<P>On the 29th of July, 1795, Cyprian Cook, ma&s;ter of the &s;loop Cri&s;is, of Norwich, in Connecticut, and Elijah Clarke, a pa&s;&s;enger in the ve&s;&s;el, emitted de|po&s;itions at New-London, of which here follows an abridgement. On the 4th of July, preceding, the Cri&s;is, and above twenty other American ve&s;&s;els were lying at anchor in the port of Jeremie, in Hi&s;paniola. The Hermione, an Engli&s;h frigate, came into the port, anchored, and &s;ent her boats to board the Americans. Every man in the ve&s;&s;els, was taken away, excepting the captains and mates. They were, to the number of &s;ixty or &s;eventy, kept on board and fa&s;ting, during forty-eight hours. They were examined, one by one, and five only were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e, as the Engli&s;h captain ob|&s;erved, they were unfit for &s;ervice. All the&s;e men were Americans born, excepting two Danes, who had been naturalized here. This outrage happen|ed &s;even months and an half after &s;igning of the treaty; and it &s;hews how &s;incerely England de&s;pi&s;ed our envoy and tho&s;e who &s;ent him. Tame &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to &s;uch treatment was the very exce&s;s of national di&s;grace. But, after Jay had declined to write an article in favour of our &s;ailors, they were &s;ure of meeting with the wor&s;t u&s;age. It is &s;trange that Jay did not burn the copy of his card, making a demand in their behalf, and of the con&s;enting re|ply of Grenville. The Pre&s;ident had very good rea|&s;on to be a&s;hamed of laying &s;uch a corre&s;pondence before the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. It is &s;uppo|&s;ed

A great part of the&s;e fellows are them&s;elves &s;ailors, and every one of them, from the na|ture of the &s;ervice, mu&s;t be robu&s;t and able-bodied. Their &s;ituation requires better wages, and better living, than that of a foot &s;oldier. They can hardly co&s;t the country le&s;s, in one &s;hape or other, than two &s;hillings &s;terling per day. On &s;hip board, or in u&s;eful manu|factures, they would be worth at lea&s;t an equal &s;um. Thus each of the&s;e kidnappers &s;inks daily four &s;hillings &s;terling, which, between po&s;itive and negative lo&s;s, they might expend or earn for &s;ociety. Nine thou&s;and men, at a lo&s;s of four &s;hillings per head, make a &s;ink|ing fund of eighteen hundred pounds &s;terling a day. This, multi|plied by the number of days in a year, gives &s;ix hundred and fifty-&s;even thou&s;and pounds per annum, for the charge of pre&s;s gangs.

<P>Camillus, in No. vi. points out many difficulties in the way of a complete protection for our mari|ners. It is likely enough that the article, if in&s;er|ted, would have been broken; and real difficulties might have occurred in the bu&s;ine&s;s. But even de|corum required &s;uch a clau&s;e. Camillus has ad|vanced &s;ome a&s;&s;ertions that are ab&s;olutely untrue. He &s;ays that <Q>Great Britain has accordingly per|&s;everingly declined any definitive arrangement on the &s;ubject; notwith&s;tanding earne&s;t and reitera|ted efforts of our government.&mdash;Our mini&s;ter plenipotentiary, Mr. Pinckney, it is well known, has long had this matter in charge, and has &s;tre|nuou&s;ly exerted him&s;elf to have it placed upon &s;ome acceptable footing; but his endeavours have
<PB N="92" REF="031906_0100_0FEF321C398D6DD0">
been un&s;ucce&s;sful.</Q> By Thomas Pinckney, and his efforts, we need not &s;et much &s;tore. While France was in the very act of driving the allies to perdition, Jay, by the mo&s;t ab&s;urd, or per&s;i|dious mi&s;conduct, put his hand to the treaty, when, if he had only waited &s;ix weeks, till the approaching conque&s;t of Holland had been completed, he might have had almo&s;t any terms worth a&s;king. Pinckney was &s;illy enough to approve of his management in making &s;o good a bargain. Neither of the&s;e pre|cious envoys would buy largely in the funds, when there was a certainty of their tumbling. Yet they clapped up a treaty, when every moment of delay was ine&s;timable to America. This is the &s;canda|lous way in which our bu&s;ine&s;s hath been tran&s;acted. The affair had hung over ten years, and then was fini&s;hed at a moment of infinite impropriety. Such mi&s;erable botching the world has probably never &s;een before.</P>
<P>Camillus fore&s;aw the objection as to the very un|&s;ea&s;onable period of &s;igning the treaty. In No. vii. he defends it thus. <Q>It will be u&s;eful to go back to the periods when the negociation began and en|ded. Our envoy arrived in England, and enter|ed upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of his mi&s;&s;ion, at the mo|ment when there was a general elation on account of the naval victory gained by Lord Howe, and previous to tho&s;e important &s;ucce&s;&s;es, which have terminated in the conque&s;t of Holland; and the treaty was concluded by the 19th of No|vember la&s;t, prior to the la&s;t mentioned event, and the defection of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia. The po&s;ture of things at the time of the negociation, and not <HI>at this time,</HI> is the &s;tandard to try its merits.</Q></P>
<P>It will indeed be <HI>u&s;eful to go back;</HI> for every line of this argument is contradicted by undi&s;puted facts.
<PB N="93" REF="031906_0101_0FEF4429022A9C78">
The Pre&s;ident's me&s;&s;age to Congre&s;s about his having appointed Jay, was dated the 16th of April, 1794. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia, in the beginning of that month, had publi&s;hed a curious manife&s;to &s;tating his rea|&s;ons for quitting his allies. Pitt afterwards gave him twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds to make him return to the combat. He took the money, but never performed his promi&s;e. In&s;tead of that, he went into Poland to be&s;iege War&s;aw. He left in|deed his quota as a prince of the German empire; but they al&s;o were annihilated, along with an Au&s;|trian army, at Kai&s;er&s;lautern, in a battle which la&s;ted inclu&s;ively night and day, from the 12th to the 15th of July, 1794; in the end, the republicans plunged through the loaded Pru&s;&s;ian batteries at the point of the bayonet. Surely, Mr. Hamilton imagines that nobody reads new&s;papers except him&s;elf. In No|vember, 1794, when Jay &s;igned this paper, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ede|ric William had, for many months, been abu&s;ed in the daily prints of London, as a de&s;erter from the cau&s;e of <HI>morality,</HI> and <HI>regular</HI> government. Thus Camillus &s;tands detected of an intentional and notorious fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>As to the general <HI>elation</HI> about lord Howe's victory, the French were equally &s;atisfied, and with better rea&s;on. An American amba&s;&s;ador <HI>ought to have been</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more penetration than the porters and chairmen whom Pitt or his runne <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|red, upon that joyful occa&s;ion, to break the win|dows of John Wilkes and lord Stanhope.</P>
<P>Again, Camillus &s;ays that Jay entered upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of his mi&s;&s;ion <HI>previous to tho&s;e important &s;ucce&s;&s;es which terminated in the conque&s;t of Holland.</HI> This is another &s;tupendous untruth, like that about the king of Pru&s;&s;ia. A few facts and dates will prove it to be &s;o. On the 26th of April, 1794, Pichegru totally beat Clairfait at Moucron, and
<PB N="94" REF="031906_0102_0FEF43CE40A6E2A8">
killed &s;ix thou&s;and of his troops. In the cour&s;e of a few weeks, a number of other de&s;perate battles en|&s;ued. The allies did whatever brave men, and able officers could do; but the French, by their numbers, their enthu&s;ia&s;m, and their talents, fair|ly drove them out of the field. So early as the 19th of May, 1794, the emperor printed an addre&s;s to the inhabitants of Bru&s;&s;els, in a tone almo&s;t as dejected as the king of Pru&s;&s;ia's farewell manife&s;to. The armies continued almo&s;t con&s;tantly fighting till the 26th of June, when the French gained the battle of Fleurus. This completely turned the &s;cale. The grand Au&s;trian army immediately &s;ent off their baggage, and, in the cour&s;e of a few days, thirty thou&s;and people fled from Bru&s;&s;els. From that day forward every man in England, excepting Jay, mu&s;t have fore&s;een the conque&s;t of Holland. Though Jay had <HI>entered upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of his mi&s;&s;ion</HI> be|fore the fate of Flanders was decided, it was his duty to have &s;pun out the bu&s;ine&s;s and to have ta|ken the utmo&s;t advantage of that invaluable con|tingency. Camillus, by advancing, in Jay's de|fence, the above palpable fictions, has expo&s;ed with|out reinforcing the weakne&s;s of the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But Camillus &s;hould al&s;o have defended the Se|nate of Congre&s;s. They certainly did not approve of the treaty till after the defection of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, and the &s;urrender of Am&s;terdam. They did not ratify till the 24th of June, 1795. In the above quotation, Camillus plainly implies, that, af|ter the <HI>defection</HI> and <HI>reduction,</HI> &amp;c. better terms might have been had. The que&s;tion then comes to be <HI>why the Senate did not &s;tand out to get them?</HI> They &s;ent back an article. They &s;hould have amen|ded and &s;ent back others. The true rea&s;on was, fir&s;t, that &s;ome of the Senators were &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;ub&s;tantially ignorant about the real &s;tate of politics
<PB N="95" REF="031906_0103_0FEF4386638EEBA8">
in Europe; for, after the reduction of the &s;even United Provinces, a fear of England attacking Ame|rica was <Q>but the eye of childhood; that fears a painted devil.</Q> Secondly, the ratification was an object of party. Jay had been &s;ent over in de&s;|pite of a majority in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives; and to have refu&s;ed the ratification of a treaty plan|ned under the au&s;pices of Mr. Hamilton, would have ca&s;t irrecoverable ridicule on their whole connec|tions. For this rea&s;on twenty &s;enators, le&s;s par|donable, if &s;uch a thing can be, than Jay him&s;elf, agreed to what he had done; and, as Junius ob|&s;erves, <Q>though royal favour cannot remove moun|tains of infamy, it undoubtedly <HI>le&s;&s;ens,</HI> for it <HI>di|vides</HI> the burden.</Q></P>
<P>But, independent of French victories, Jay mu&s;t have known that Pitt, from his dreadful want of money, could not hold out for any con&s;iderable time. Much has been &s;aid as to the danger of Eng|land (for&s;ooth!) declaring war again&s;t the United States. To &s;hew the dreadful plight that &s;he was in, the following particulars are taken from a &s;e|ries of re&s;olutions read in the hou&s;e of commons by Mr. Smith, on the 22d of February, 1796.</P>
<P>In September, 1795, Walter Boyd, junior, was reque&s;ted by Pitt to advance him a million &s;terling. He did &s;o, and by agreement, he was to draw bills on the lords commi&s;&s;ioners of the trea&s;ury, which they were to accept. Now comes the a&s;toni&s;hing part of the tran&s;action. Bills for &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds were drawn in London, bearing a fal&s;e date at Hamburgh, &s;everal weeks pre|ceding the real time of framing them. Walter Boyd is not engaged in any hou&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s at Hamburgh, &s;o that he might as well have preten|ded to draw bills from the moon. The&s;e forge|ries, pro&s;e&s;&s;ing to be foreign bills, were written
<PB N="96" REF="031906_0104_0FEF442AE165BE60">
upon un&s;tamped paper. <Q>They were, &s;ays Mr. Smith, of &s;uch a nature and de&s;cription, as the bank of England would have refu&s;ed to di&s;count for any commercial hou&s;e whatever, and &s;uch as it would have been injurious to the credit of any private hou&s;e, to have negociated.</Q> The&s;e are civil words, but, in plain Engli&s;h, any other parties of &s;uch a plot, but the mini&s;ter and his friends, would infallibly have been hanged.</P>
<P>It was plain that a government adopting &s;uch in|famous expedients to rai&s;e money, mu&s;t have been upon its la&s;t legs. With &s;uch facts in view, it is amazing how completely &s;ome of the able&s;t men in America were deceived about it. Of all the argu|ments in favour of the Briti&s;h treaty, none was more loudly repeated than the danger of a war with Britain. <Q>War, &s;aid Dr. Ames, might be delay|ed, but could not be prevented. The cau&s;es of it would remain, would be aggravated, would be multiplied, and &s;oon become intollerable. More captures, more impre&s;&s;ments, would &s;well the li&s;t of our wrongs, and the current of our rage.</Q> [If England had declared war again&s;t the United States, in con&s;equence of the repre|&s;entatives rejecting the treaty, &s;he would have become bankrupt before the next Chri&s;tmas.] <Q>The progre&s;s of <HI>wealth</HI> and improvement is wonder|ful, and &s;ome will think too rapid.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bache's debates, vol&punc; ii. p. 332.</NOTE> [Witne&s;s the enormous bankruptcies in October, 1796, and the intolerable &s;carcity of money ever &s;ince.

<P>We &s;hall now go back to Mr. Smith's re&s;olutions, and cite another proof of the utter incapacity of England, in June 1796, to have attacked America. <Q>The profits of the contractors, &s;ays he, at the expence of the nation, have been &s;o exorbitantly &s;welled, as to have ri&s;en even before the depo|&s;it was made thereon, to an amount greatly ex|ceeding the depo&s;it it&s;elf, viz. on a loan of eigh|teen millions, to the enormous and incredible &s;um of, <HI>two millions, one hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling.</HI></Q></P>
<P>No man could imagine that &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem was to hold out, any more than the gambling intere&s;t of five per cent. per month, &s;o frequently paid of late in the &s;ea port towns of America. Both the&s;e ways of rai&s;ing money re&s;embled the re&s;ource of the culprit, who &s;aid that he could e&s;cape the gal|lows by cutting his throat in pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance &s;hall be given of the hurry in which Pitt was to &s;ecure the loan for 1796, and of the extreme impatience with which the people of England &s;aw the war prolonged.</P>
<P>When the bankers of London agreed to lend a &s;um of money to the mini&s;ter, the cu&s;tom was to
<PB N="98" REF="031906_0106_0FEF43D586C0F160">
give them credit in the public funds to a certain amount. The current price of &s;tock, at the time of making the bargain, determined the quantity of it to be given for the new advances of the creditors. Thus, if the three per cents were at eighty, the &s;ame proportion of them would buy ten thou&s;and pounds, that would only buy &s;even thou&s;and five hundred, if the &s;tocks were at &s;ixty per cent. It was hence the great aim of every premier to rai&s;e them as high as po&s;&s;ible, before his loan, and it was u&s;ual to ca&s;t pro&s;pects of peace, into &s;ome royal &s;peech or me&s;&s;age, by which they were &s;ure of being rai&s;ed. But, on the 27th of November, 1795, Mr Pitt, with a precipitancy that wears the foule&s;t a&s;pect, clo&s;ed a loan for eighteen millions with Mr. Boyd. A me&s;&s;age that he mu&s;t have fore&s;een, came on the 8th of December, thereafter, from George the Third to parliament, telling his earne&s;t de&s;ire of peace. The funds in&s;tantly got up &s;o high that the quantity given for the loan, ro&s;e in its value, <HI>nine hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling.</HI> This was ju&s;t &s;o much money lo&s;t to the public, and gained to the bankers, who probably run halves with Pitt him&s;elf. So rapid a ri&s;e in the funds, on the &s;lender pro&s;pect of peace, &s;hewed how very little the Briti&s;h were by this time di&s;po&s;ed or indeed enabled for a war with America. <Q>I con&s;ider all tho&s;e war arguments that have been made u&s;e of," &s;aid Mr. Chri&s;tie, as nothing more than the old &s;tory of raw-head-and-bloody-bones, much fitter to be u&s;ed by an old woman to quiet a cro&s;s child, than to convince any of the enlightened members of this hou&s;e of the propriety of this mea&s;ure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bache's Debates, vol, ii. p. 351.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Events have &s;ince proved that the dread of war was a mere chimera, as the public credit of England

had become too feeble to &s;upport &s;uch a &s;hock.

The We&s;t-India Royal Gazette, of the 7th of October, 1794, contains a memorial to Henry Dundas from the We&s;t-Indian planters and mer|chants. They &s;tate, at much length, how impo&s;&s;ible it is for them to &s;ub&s;i&s;t unle&s;s by &s;upplies of pro|vi&s;ions from this country.

Every &s;tep of inve&s;tigation di&s;covers more clearly the utter ignorance, negligence, or corruption of his excellency John Jay. This envoy might have dic|tated his own terms about the We&s;t-India trade, yet it was in this very quarter that he con&s;ented to a &s;tipulation which even the capacious gulp of our Senate could not, or dur&s;t not, &s;wallow. By the twelfth article, we were not to keep the Briti&s;h i&s;lands from &s;tarving by freighting any ve&s;&s;els larger than <HI>&s;eventy tons!</HI></P>
<Q><P>Many ob&s;tacles &s;tand in the way of the We&s;t-India colonies, obtaining lumber and provi&s;ions from Great-Britain, or any other country in Eu|rope; more particularly the precarious circum|&s;tances of &s;uch a &s;upply; its di&s;tance in time of emergency, and the peri&s;hable nature of the ar|ticles of food, which forbids a provi&s;ion of large &s;tores from a re&s;ource &s;o remote; and even were it practicable for the colonies to exi&s;t under a de|pendance of the nece&s;&s;aries of life and cultivation, upon means &s;o uncertain, yet the enormous ex|pence of tho&s;e means, particularly in re&s;pect to lumber, mu&s;t prevent their cultivating their lands to any beneficial purpo&s;e either to them&s;elves, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, or finally to Great Britain.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h colonies have found, in an inter|cour&s;e with the United States, a market for their &s;uperfluous produce beyond the European con|&s;umption, and particularly for the article of rum; for which, at different times, the European market would not afford the co&s;t of package and tran&s;|port.</P></Q>
<P>Thus far we have about one-fourth part of the memorial. We now plainly &s;ee that the more i&s;lands which England conquered in the We&s;t-Indies, the more &s;he was dependant on this country, for their means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, for timber to build hou&s;es,
<PB N="102" REF="031906_0110_0FEF43D737AE41D8">
for &s;taves and heading, as likewi&s;e for taking off a great part of the We&s;t-Indian productions that would not bear the expence of being conveyed to Europe. The planters and merchants proceed to complain heavily of the mode of intercour&s;e then permitted between the continent and the i&s;lands. It is difficult to do ju&s;tice to their ideas but in their own words. Here follows part of what they &s;ay.</P>
<P><Q>Since the &s;eparation of the United States from Great Britain, their intercour&s;e with our i&s;lands having been re&s;tricted to <HI>Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els only,</HI> the price of lumber and provi&s;ions at the We&s;t-India markets, under the mo&s;t favourable circum&s;tan|ces of peace and regular &s;upply, has ari&s;en from fifty to an hundred per cent.</Q></P>
<P>This, by the way, &s;hews the tyrannical &s;pirit of the Briti&s;h government, and how every other part of the empire is &s;acrificed to the plan of aggrandi|zing the mother country. The memorial goes on in the&s;e words.</P>
<Q><P>The intercour&s;e, while confined to Briti&s;h ve&s;|&s;els, has, for various rea&s;ons, been principally carried on by a direct trade between the i&s;lands and the United States, in ve&s;&s;els con&s;tructed and fitted for the purpo&s;e, which mu&s;t evidently have the advantage over ve&s;&s;els employed in the circu|itous trade from Great-Britain; as the la&s;t could not be at once proper for the tran&s;port of lumber from America to the i&s;lands, and for that of pro|duce from the i&s;lands of Great Britain; nor afford means of barter in rum and mola&s;&s;es, nor be navi|gated on equally advantageous terms with tho&s;e &s;maller ve&s;&s;els, nor equally &s;uit their expedition to the wants of the i&s;lands and to the &s;tate of markets.</P>
<P>Upon the breaking out of a war with France, the&s;e &s;mall and defencele&s;s ve&s;&s;els have either
<PB N="103" REF="031906_0111_0FEF322308621288">
fallen a prey to the enemy, or been employed in other trades; and this cannot be accounted a circum&s;tance accidental, or that admits of future remedy; &s;ince the nature of the intercour&s;e in que&s;tion forbids an e&s;tabli&s;hment of regular con|voys to and from all the i&s;lands at &s;uch times as may be &s;uited to their wants; and the immen&s;e expence of outfit, &s;eamen's wages, and in&s;urance, di&s;courage adventure in a trade attended with &s;uch imminent ri&s;k, and which, if a &s;upply by &s;uch means were even po&s;&s;ible, mu&s;t &s;well the ex|pence beyond tho&s;e bounds which the cultivators in tho&s;e i&s;lands can po&s;&s;ibly &s;upport.</P></Q>
<P>There is next &s;tated the frequent and <HI>invincible nece&s;&s;ity</HI> which the governors of the We&s;t-India i&s;lands find of opening their ports to American ve&s;&s;els to prevent in&s;tant &s;tarvation; and yet provi&s;ions and other articles of <HI>immediate nece&s;&s;ity</HI> are &s;ome|times &s;old at three hundred per cent. beyond the average price. For this, and other rea&s;ons above &s;tated, they &s;olicit a more extended intercour&s;e with America. They repre&s;ent the impo&s;&s;ibility of providing food from their lands, and the pecu|liar di&s;tre&s;s under which they labour during the pre&s;ent war. <Q>Under &s;uch di&s;advantages a per&s;eve|rance in the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of their intercour&s;e with America mu&s;t form an accumulation of bur|den, which will entirely preclude a fair competi|tion with their rivals in cultivation, will &s;timu|late and a&s;&s;i&s;t the progre&s;s of cultivation in the Dutch and Spani&s;h &s;ettlements, and immediate|ly tend to the di&s;tre&s;s and ruin of the inhabitants of the Briti&s;h We&s;t-India colonies, and of the numerous cla&s;&s;es of their fellow &s;ubjects in Great Britain and Ireland connected with and depen|dant upon them.</Q></P>
<P>The memorial al&s;o repre&s;ents the good policy
<PB N="104" REF="031906_0112_0FEF3210DE874AD8">
of encouraging America to per&s;evere in her agri|cultural &s;y&s;tem, and expre&s;&s;es fears that the de|pre&s;&s;ion of her intercour&s;e with the i&s;lands may have a tendency of driving her to manufactures. They add, <Q>our &s;y&s;tem of exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e be|nefits has been found, in times of emergency, impracticable, and the participation which, at &s;uch times, we have granted to America, has had neither the merit of a conce&s;&s;ion with that country, nor the advantage of effectual relief to our&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to &s;eek farther evidence of the Bri|ti&s;h We&s;t-Indies exi&s;ting wholely at our good will; and how highly England values that part of her ac|qui&s;itions appears from her &s;olicitude to extend them.</P>
<P>In the debate, in parliament, about the beginning of 1796, on the bill for aboli&s;hing the &s;lave-trade, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, Mr. Dundas &s;tated the imports from the Briti&s;h We&s;t-Indies, in 1795, to be as follows: eight millions eight hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling; revenue ari&s;ing on this amount, one million &s;ix hundred and twenty-four thou&s;and; &s;hipping employed in that trade, &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty-four ve&s;&s;els; tonnage, one hundred and fifty-three thou&s;and; &s;eamen eight thou&s;and; exports from Great-Britain, to the We&s;t-Indies, in 1794, three millions &s;even hundred and forty thou&s;and pounds, employing &s;even hundred ve&s;&s;els; tonnage, one hundred and &s;eventy-&s;even thou&s;and; &s;eamen, twelve thou&s;and; produce of the i&s;lands imported to Britain and re-exported, three millions &s;even hun|dred thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>On the 10th of February, 1797, Mr. Parker, when defending the plan of building American fri|gates, ob&s;erved that, &s;ince the beginning of the war, not a &s;ingle Briti&s;h We&s;t-India fleet had been home|ward bound which the&s;e &s;ix frigates were not &s;trong
<PB N="105" REF="031906_0113_0FEF4392A093FB28">
enough to have taken. Such was the known track of the trade-winds that they were obliged to come <HI>within &s;even days &s;ailing of this coa&s;t.</HI> The French were in the &s;ame condition, &s;o that we might have been as formidable to either of the&s;e powers as Al|giers is.</P>
<P>The &s;topping of this enormous trade mu&s;t have ruined the credit of Britain. She would not, there|fore, have been ha&s;ty in declaring war again&s;t the country, after the dreadful campaign of 1794. On the 10th of February of that year, Dorche&s;ter had, in|deed, made an addre&s;s to the Indians, wherein he &s;ta|ted the po&s;&s;ibility of a war, in the cour&s;e of the year, between England and the United States. But this was, mo&s;t likely, a mere decoy for our executive. On the 26th of May following, Grenville and Dun|das denied, in Parliament, any knowledge of this performance. They certainly lied, for they refu|&s;ed to produce a copy of Dorche&s;ter's in&s;tructions; and, as Fox ob&s;erved in reply, his lord&s;hip was not a per&s;on who would hazard &s;uch a conduct without proper authority. This di&s;avowal by Dundas and Grenville &s;hews that they were afraid to acknow|ledge the &s;peech; and that a rupture with the Uni|ted States would have been regarded in the old country with univer&s;al reprobation. Grenville even pretended to deny the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch a harangue having ever been delivered. What an impo&s;tor! But this agrees very well with the forgery of Boyd's Hamburg bills<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;atellites of the mini&s;ter have about as much honour and hone&s;ty as him&s;elf. The Telegraph of the 30th of March, 1795, re|lates, that, on a late trial at Thetford, it came out that a member of Parliament pocke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed three hundred pounds &s;terling a year for frank|ing letters to a banking-hou&s;e.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Camillus, No. v. overlooks every circum&s;tance of this kind that &s;hews how much Pitt would have
<PB N="106" REF="031906_0114_0FEF4394417A76B8">
been afraid of an American war. He tries to play upon our prudence and our fears. When &s;peaking of the claim for negroes carried away by the Bri|ti&s;h from New-York, at the end of the late war, he &s;ays <Q>no con&s;ideration of honour forbid <HI>(for|bade)</HI> the renunciation; every calculation of in|tere&s;t invited to it. The evils of war for one month would outweigh the advantage, if, at the end of it, there was a certainty of attainment. But was war the alternative? Yes, war or di&s;|grace. &mdash;If nothing had re&s;ulted [from Jay's voyage, he means,] was there any choice but re|pri&s;als? Should we not have rendered our&s;elves ridiculous and contemptible in the eyes of the whole world by forbearing them?</Q></P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity that Camillus de&s;cribes did not ex|i&s;t; though we have lo&s;t le&s;s by a &s;habby &s;tate of peace, than we mu&s;t have done by a &s;ucce&s;sful war. But wi&s;dom would have cho&s;en a middle cour&s;e. Jay might have addre&s;&s;ed Grenville in terms like the&s;e. <Q>You have wronged the United States in a variety of &s;hapes. Your offers of redre&s;s are eva|&s;ive or in&s;olent. We &s;hall not declare war again&s;t you. There is a &s;horter and a cheaper way. America has no treaty of commerce with Eng|land. She cannot be accu&s;ed of breaking any, by &s;topping the exportation of provi&s;ions to your We&s;t-India i&s;lands. We know that your fifty thou&s;and whites, and five hundred thou&s;and blacks cannot find bread or pork for their dinners, or timber to build their hou&s;es, or &s;taves for their ca&s;ks, or even hor&s;es or cattle, but by &s;ending for them to our continent. Be&s;ides large quan|tities of their rum, we al&s;o take &s;everal produc|tions that will not bear the expence of a con|veyance to Europe.

After driving Victor Hughes out of Guadaloupe, you might burn &s;ome of our towns on the &s;ea coa&s;t, as you did in the la&s;t war. But then we &s;hall infallibly de&s;troy your nine millions &s;terling per annum of imports from the We&s;t-Indies, and the &s;ixteen hundred thou&s;and pounds of revenue derived from them. This would be a mortal &s;troke to your finances, and &s;o take your choice.</Q></P>
<P>In No xv. Camillus treats of the compen&s;ation afforded by the &s;eventh article of Jay's treaty for Briti&s;h piracies on American commerce. Since the apoplexy of Briti&s;h paper the word <HI>compen&s;ation</HI> &s;ounds like mockery. But Camillus would have it believed that Pitt never intended the confi&s;cation of our ve&s;&s;els. <Q>The&s;e terms, <HI>legal adjudication,</HI> were certainly not equivalent, upon any rational con&s;truction, to <HI>condemnation.</HI>&mdash;Yet the Briti&s;h We&s;t-India courts of admiralty appear to have ge|nerally acted upon the term as &s;ynonimous to con|demnation.&mdash;The Briti&s;h cabinet have di&s;avowed this con&s;truction of the We&s;t-India courts; and

<P>The &s;tile of Mr. Hamilton is &s;o prolix, he has &s;uch &s;kill at beating out his guinea into an acre of gold leaf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This can really be done.</NOTE>, that it is inconvenient to quote him at full length. But he means to have it under&s;tood, that the We&s;t-India judges acted again&s;t the under|&s;tanding and wi&s;hes of P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t. The latter mu&s;t have been a very great blockhead, if he could not write a dozen intelligible lines, e&s;pecially on a &s;ubject of &s;uch immen&s;e importance. But every man, Camil|lus and the tories excepted, can &s;ee at once the bot|tom of the &s;tory. The object was to &s;eize Ame|rican &s;hipping for the treble purpo&s;e of enriching the Engli&s;h, of humbling America, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing France. Yet the orders were to be drawn in a &s;huf|fling form, that Pitt, if he &s;hould afterwards find it advi&s;eable to di&s;own them, as he did Dorche&s;ter's in&s;tructions, might have a chink to creep through. We may be &s;ure that judges, and officers of the na|vy, acted from a perfect acquaintance with Pitt's re|al intention&punc; and, when colonel Hamilton tries to per&s;uade us of the contrary, it is only adding in&s;ult to robbery. When the object had been attained, it was very ea&s;y for Pitt to deny his orders. In a fu|ture chapter &s;hall be in&s;erted a regular hi&s;tory of the whole of the&s;e in&s;tructions. A &s;econd &s;et was publi&s;hed by the cabinet of London on the 8th of January, 1794. They were very little better than the fir&s;t. A former edition, ju&s;t about as bad, had been i&s;&s;ued on the 8th of June, 1793, under which al&s;o &s;ome bucaneering was committed. Thus the court of London acted upon a &s;y&s;tem, and it was very wrong in Camillus to ca&s;t the blame on the judges in the We&s;t-Indies. As for the above <HI>door

that has been opened,</HI> it co&s;ts two hundred and fifty pounds &s;terling to get in. Divine ju&s;tice never di&s;|played it&s;elf more &s;plendidly than by the cha&s;ti&s;ement of Briti&s;h pride. Since the &s;torming of the Ba&s;|tile, the mo&s;t au&s;picious event in the annals of Eu|rope is the fall of the bank of England.</P>
<P>Among the inflammatory topics of the federal party, no one has had a more powerful effect than the attempt of Genet to involve this country in ho&s;tilities with England. The force of the objec|tion &s;hall be admitted; but any other envoy, &s;itua|ted like Genet, would have rejoiced in &s;ecuring the alliance of America. This was the very part which Dr. Franklin acted at the court of France; and the ultimate con&s;equences of his mi&s;&s;ion overturn|ed the French monarchy. Nothing, therefore, can be more impenetrably &s;tupid than to advance, as Mr. Hamilton and his hacks con&s;tantly do, this de|&s;ign of involving us in an Engli&s;h war, as a charge of peculiar atrocity again&s;t Genet and the republic. This was the very path formerly pur&s;ued by the United States; and it would, under &s;imilar circum|&s;tances, have been attempted by any nation or any amba&s;&s;ador under heaven. This identical trap had been laid by the old Congre&s;s and Franklin for the French cabinet, &s;o that it was perfectly natural for France to endeavour at obtaining a retaliation. While Genet mu&s;t be condemned, Mr. Hammond was equally culpable. His perfidious and in&s;olent propo&s;al to Mr. Randolph, previous to the ratifi|tion of Jay's treaty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">American Annual Regi&s;ter, chap. viii.</NOTE>, was more affronting to the executive feelings, if any &s;uch feelings exi&s;ted, than the mo&s;t frantic menaces uttered by Ge|net. A compliance by General Wa&s;hington would have ca&s;t him completely into the lee-way of the
<PB N="110" REF="031906_0118_0FEF4434FAD40348">
Briti&s;h amba&s;&s;ador. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a &s;ecret mu&s;t have been of immen&s;e value to the Briti&s;h cabinet. It would have been a rudder by which our executive mu&s;t have &s;teered wherever Ham|mond cho&s;e to lead him; for it di&s;covery was &s;ure to have interred even the popularity of Wa&s;h|ington. If this di&s;graceful project had come from Genet, the Gazette of the United States would have played a weekly tune upon that fiddle to the end of this century. But, originating with Pitt, not a &s;ingle word will be heard about it from the fede|ral pre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Mr. Wa&s;hington has made an uncommon parade about the impartiality of his conduct between France and England. As the former &s;aved him from the chance of a&s;cending a gibbet, to which he had been de&s;tined by the Parliament of Britain, he can|not derive much honour from an utter oblivion of his political obligations. But the fact is, that he has preferred Britain to France. This will appear from what follows.</P>
<P>In 1793, when Genet came here, he was direct|ed, by his in&s;tructions, to open negociations for a commercial treaty. They direct him to tell the American government that the executive council <Q>are inclined to extend the latitude of the propo|&s;ed <HI>commercial</HI> treaty.</Q> Another idea was to break up the colonial and monopolizing &s;y&s;tems of all nations, and emancipate the new world. Camil|lus, No. xxiv. calls the latter <HI>a mad &s;cheme</HI> and <HI>a po|litical chimera.</HI> The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions betray Mr. Ha|milton's general ca&s;t of thinking. His feelings are &s;o perfectly Briti&s;h, and monarchical, that it &s;eems inconceivable how he ever came to &s;ight, as he did, for the American revolution. Mexico and Bra&s;il are ju&s;t as well entitled to freedom as New-York and Penn&s;ylvania. Their emancipation would be
<PB N="111" REF="031906_0119_0FEF449F2AC979D8">
an immen&s;e benefit both to the inhabitants of tho&s;e countries them&s;elves, and to mankind at large. So far from being chimerical, the event is probable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French had actually prepared a manife&s;to intituled, <HI>Les Fran|cai&s;e Libres le leurs fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">res de la</HI> LOUISIANE.

In the la&s;t age, Camillus would have defended the divine right of kings. In England, he would vindicate the Guinea trade, as in America he &s;ighs over the me|mory of the Ba&s;tile; while John Jay, and Rufus King, and Jedidiah Mor&s;e, and the whole prie&s;thood of Connecticut, heave re&s;pon&s;ive notes of &s;orrow<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The reverend doctor has a pulpit at Charle&s;town, in Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts.

So far from &s;uch an emancipation being chimerical, it is next to certain of taking place. If the French do not atchieve this great event, the tide of federal population, rolling we&s;tward, will begin it in le&s;s than a century.</P>
<P>Returning to Pre&s;ident Wa&s;hington and Genet, we ob&s;erve that the former refu&s;ed to enter into any treaty, becau&s;e the Senate were not &s;itting at the time when the French envoy made the propo|&s;al.

<P><PB N="113" REF="031906_0121_0FEF44397AC5E218">The Pre&s;ident's me&s;&s;age is of con&s;iderable length, but the few words above quoted contain its e&s;&s;ence. In the left hand column he &s;ays, that he cannot en|ter into any negociation for a treaty till the meet|ing of the Senate. No words can be plainer or &s;tronger than tho&s;e which he employs. The oppo&s;ite column &s;peaks an oppo&s;ite language. It is ungene|rous to triumph over the ruins of declining fame. Upon this account, not a word more &s;hall be &s;aid about the matter. The bare circum&s;tances &s;uper|cede any attempt either to exaggerate or demon|&s;trate. Nothing but the nece&s;&s;ity of explanation could have, at all, brought the &s;ubject forward.</P>
<P>While this &s;heet was going to pre&s;s, (16th May, 1797,) Pre&s;ident Adams has delivered a &s;peech at the opening of the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of the fifth Congre&s;s. He &s;ays that <Q>the conduct of the government has been ju&s;t and IMPARTIAL to foreign nations.</Q> With re&s;pect to France, what has been above cited refutes the a&s;&s;ertion. The &s;peech con&s;i&s;ts entirely of a complaint again&s;t the republic. It forms a kind of po&s;t&s;cript to Pickering's letter to Pinckney. Not a word e&s;capes the Pre&s;ident about Briti&s;h piracy, which continues to expand in full blo&s;&s;om. The ve|ry day before this &s;peech was pronounced, the Phi|ladelphia Gazette contained a curious example of the relative amity of France and England. The French had carried about &s;ixteen American ve&s;&s;els into Jean Rabel. The Briti&s;h cut out the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, and it was expected that they would be &s;ent to Ja|maica for trial. There can be no doubt of their being tried &s;omewhere; and the chance is, that mo&s;t, if not the whole&punc; of them will be confi&s;cated.</P>
<P>When Mr. Munroe, had his farewell audience of the executive directory, Barras glanced with con|tempt at the Briti&s;h treaty, and the Briti&s;h intere&s;t by which it had been brought about. Mr. Adams
<PB N="114" REF="031906_0122_0FEF443BC4691EB0">
has mu&s;tered up this into an alarming in&s;ult again&s;t our country, and an attempt to &s;ow dome&s;tic di&s;|&s;en&s;ion. He reprobates &s;uch a &s;tyle in the bittere&s;t terms, as <Q>&s;tudiou&s;ly marked with indignities to|wards the government of the United States. It evinces a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;eparate the people of the United States from the government; to per&s;uade them that they have different affections, princi|ples, and intere&s;ts, from tho&s;e of their fellow-citizens, and thus to produce divi&s;ions fatal to our peace.</Q></P>
<P>This &s;peech does not come within the period a&s;|&s;igned to the pre&s;ent volume; but it forms a branch of the plan already explained for provoking a French war. A ca&s;e exactly &s;imilar to this of Bar|ras and Munroe happened, &s;ome years ago, be|tween lord Grenville and Thomas Pinckney. The former mentioned to the latter, in the mo&s;t overbea|ring manner, the influence of a jacobin faction in America. Choi&s;eul or Neckar would not have up|braided an Engli&s;h envoy with the riots excited by John Wilkes or George Gordon. If the American executive of 1793, had felt even the mo&s;t glim|mering &s;park of national dignity, the in&s;ult would have been re&s;ented. If Pinckney him&s;elf had been penetrable by reproach, he would have cut Gren|ville &s;hort. <Q>My lord, he might have &s;aid, Eng|land has many jacobins. Scotland has perhaps a &s;till larger proportion, and the number is hourly augmenting. The Iri&s;h are a jacobin nation. They are as ripe for a revolution, as a peach ever was for dropping. Confine your &s;olicitude to them, and leave us to get rid, as quietly as we can, of your corre&s;pondent, Alexander Hamilton, and his funding cancer of &s;ix per cent.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Pinckney pocketed the &s;tigma. He &s;ent home the precious notice of a jacobin faction in

America. The executive, proud of &s;uch a corro|boration to his own doctrine, &s;ent it to Congre&s;s; and the letter was read to the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;en|tatives without one murmur of di&s;dain. That Pinckney &s;hould have endured &s;uch mockery was bad. That General Wa&s;hington &s;hould have tran&s;|ferred the indignity to his own &s;houlders, without any muttering, was a great deal wor&s;e. The abject &s;ilence of the repre&s;entatives, when the paper was read, betrayed an equal extinction of any formida|ble &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Barras could not have wi&s;hed for a better prece|dent in his &s;peech to Munroe. The etiquette of federal degradation had been e&s;tabli&s;hed at London. It had been approved by the Pre&s;ident and Congre&s;s. Barras, with a thou&s;and rea&s;ons for re&s;entment, while Grenville had not one, was highly excu&s;able for giving us a repetition of the do&s;e.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident affects to bri&s;tle up at the mention of American parties. He knows that there are &s;uch, and an allu&s;ion to them was not <HI>&s;eparating the peo|ple from the government.</HI> The Briti&s;h treaty was &s;queezed through the Senate by a party of twenty again&s;t a party of ten; and two of the former, on account of their per&s;onal characters, would hardly be admitted as evidences in a court of ju&s;tice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Extract from the journals of the Kentucky legi&s;lature, Novem|ber 21, 1795. <Q>On motion, re&s;olved, that a committee ought to be appointed to draught a memorial to Congre&s;s, &s;etting forth that HUMPHREY MARSHALL, one of our Senators from this &s;tate, has been publicly charged with being guilty of <HI>perjury,</HI> and reque&s;ting that an inve&s;tigation may be made on the &s;ubject, and that, if the fact be &s;ufficiently proved, he ought to be expelled from the Senate.

The Gazette of the United States is an egg hatched under the very wing of the Senate. It produces a con&s;tant &s;tream of invective again&s;t the republic, and again&s;t every man in this country who has ap|proved of the French revolution. On the part of Barras the &s;arca&s;m was perfectly fair. We had no right or pretence to complain about it.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives have &s;et out with a direct breach of one of their &s;tanding rules. This is that <Q>in ALL ca&s;es where others than mem|bers of the hou&s;e are eligible, there &s;hall be <HI>a previous nomination.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The propriety of adopting this rule will be happily illu&s;trated by a recent circum&s;tance, which occurred within the walls of that hou&s;e. In the &s;econd &s;e&s;&s;ion of the third Congre&s;s, Mr. Sedgwick pre&s;ented a petition from a per&s;on who wanted to be appointed as their &s;hort hand writer. It was after|wards known that this man <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">David Hogan, editor of the State-Trials of Penn&s;ylvania.</NOTE> had, &s;ometime before, been publicly tried at Baltimore, and bani&s;hed, as <HI>a receiver of &s;tolen goods.</HI> Had a &s;tenographer been, at that time, cho&s;en by ballot, Mr. Sedgwick might have probably brought him&s;elf into the dilem|ma of voting for this <HI>hone&s;t</HI> candidate. Such an in&s;tance has, to be &s;ure, nothing to do with the &s;ucce&s;sful candidate in the election here referred to; but it &s;hews what may fall within the chapter of po&s;|&s;ibilities.</P>
<P>Mr. Giles urged the ju&s;tice of naming the candi|dates beforehand, that gentleman might have an opportunity of balancing, in their own minds, the merit of each. This looked like fairne&s;s. The propo&s;al was re&s;i&s;ted by Dr. William Smith of South-Carolina. That &s;tate hath, in the fifth Con|gre&s;s, &s;ent two members of the &s;ame name and
<PB N="117" REF="031906_0125_0FEF44474BD3D118">
&s;urname. The one here meant is the writer of PHOCION'S letters. This is the man who di&s;patch|ed pilot boats, while Congre&s;s met at New-York, to Charle&s;ton. The object of this maritime emba&s;&s;y was to buy up continental certificates. They were obtained at eighteen pence or half a crown per pound. They were then funded by the doctor at twenty &s;hillings. By a &s;pecial act of Congre&s;s, to which he gave his vote, an hundred and twenty or an hundred and fifty thou&s;and dollars of his precious commo|dity were transferred from the public &s;tocks into the &s;tock of the bank of the United States. There the Doctor draws eight per cent. of intere&s;t for the nominal amount of a &s;um of which the principal originally co&s;t him but ten per cent. In plainer words, he advanced as it were ten dollars to &s;erve his country, and, by various &s;teps, he now draws an yearly intere&s;t for them, at the moderate rate of eight dollars. A nation cannot help flouri&s;hing, when under the au&s;pices of &s;uch a <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted</HI> le|gi&s;lator.</P>
<P>The point in view, by the breach of the above &s;tan|ding rule, was, to remove Mr. John Beckley from his office as Clerk of Congre&s;s, an office which he has held ever &s;ince the operation of the new government. There was not a member in the hou&s;e, who could, even in the &s;malle&s;t degree, impeach his of|ficial conduct. This made it nece&s;&s;ary to exclude him by a <HI>&s;ilent</HI> vote. The motion was carried by forty-one voices again&s;t forty. Mr. Beckley may now, like Sully, find lei&s;ure to write an hi&s;tory of the abominations to which he has been a witne&s;s. His talents are equal to the ta&s;k, and he cannot ren|der America a more important &s;ervice.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid about the &s;ale of cer|tificates, it is not inferred that every purcha&s;er of them, at an inferior price, acted di&s;hone&s;tly. No
<PB N="118" REF="031906_0126_0FEF44490DBF5D08">
certainty exi&s;ted of their being funded by the new government, and much le&s;s of their being funded at the full nominal value. It was a lottery where|of no one could tell the proportion of prizes. The blame in &s;peculating re&s;ted entirely with tho&s;e mem|bers of Congre&s;s who bought up the certificates at a cheap rate, with the view of thereafter voting for their being funded at the full price; or who gave &s;uch a vote with an eye to &s;ub&s;equent pur|cha&s;es. Among other defects of the new government, one was that the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives con&s;i&s;ted only of &s;ixty-five members. This number was too &s;mall, and twenty, joined together, by the &s;acred bond of paper-jobbing, were next to certain of car|rying any point about which they were anxious.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of January, 1790, this dome&s;tic debt amounted, in principal and intere&s;t, to forty milli|ons, two hundred and fifty-&s;ix thou&s;and dollars<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gallati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, p. 96.</NOTE>. A majority of each hou&s;e voted for funding the whole ma&s;s at its nominal value. How many mil|lions belonged to them&s;elves cannot be a&s;certained until the arrival of that day, which is to di&s;clo&s;e all human &s;ecrets. Thus did the nation &s;uffer a do|zen or perhaps thirty &s;peculators to &s;it as judges upon their own job.</P>
<P>A member of Congre&s;s might, on this occa&s;ion, be very fitly compared to an attorney whom you &s;end into court to make the be&s;t compo&s;ition that he can with your ju&s;t creditors. They had heard of your being partly in&s;olvent, and offer to tran&s;|fer their claims for an eighth part of their nominal amount. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of your agent to take advantage of this juncture; in&s;tead of which he clande&s;tinely buys up all tho&s;e debts again&s;t you, at the reduced price, for which his funds afford

him ability. To &s;helter him&s;elf in a croud, he en|courages other adventurers to buy up all the re|maing debts again&s;t you in the &s;ame way. He then comes forward, in name of him&s;elf and his a&s;|&s;ociates, and compels you to give a mortgage for forty millions of dollars, when he could, in reali|ty, have rid you of the whole &s;um for five milli|ons. You would not think that &s;uch an attorney had di&s;charged his tru&s;t with fidelity. You never would employ him again. It is even po&s;&s;ible that he might be turned out of his profe&s;&s;ion. Within the la&s;t twenty years, Mr. Alexander M'Kenzie, an at|torney at Edinburgh, was employed to &s;ell an e&s;|tate. At the time and place publicly appointed, no purcha&s;er appeared, and Mr. M'Kenzie bought it up in his own name. Several of his brethren, men above being &s;u&s;pected of collu&s;ion, attended the whole tran&s;action, and gave evidence that they had no jealou&s;y of unfair dealing. The price it|&s;elf, though alledged to be &s;omewhat low, was not much under the mark. Yet the Court of Se&s;&s;ion declared that no factor could buy and &s;ell at the &s;ame time. They rever&s;ed the bargain, and the hou&s;e of peers confirmed their decree. But, if Mr. M'Kenzie had been directed to buy an e&s;tate at its market price of two thou&s;and five hundred pounds, and if he had fir&s;t procured it for him&s;elf, and thereafter forced his client to pay twenty thou|&s;and pounds for it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This proportion of one to eight is laid down by Mr. Gallatia as the medium difference between the market price, and the full amount at which the certificates were funded.</NOTE>, his gown would have been torn from his &s;houlders. The fir&s;t glance from the bench would have announced the annihilation of his &s;cheme.</P>
<P>Of the above forty millions of dollars, a &s;mall part was funded at only three per cent. though with
<PB N="120" REF="031906_0128_0FEF444FFB0AF998">
the pro&s;pect of certain advantages, needle&s;s here to be explained, which were &s;uppo&s;ed to place it on a level in value with the remainder of the debt. Another part, though but a &s;mall one, was funded in name of original creditors, the men with pal|&s;ies and rheumati&s;ms caught on board of the Old Jer&s;ey, with wooden legs and weather-beaten faces, who&s;e very looks are di&s;gu&s;ting to a <HI>friend of order.</HI> The&s;e heroes promoted an American revolution, when we were fifty times le&s;s heavily taxed than any other &s;ubjects of the Briti&s;h crown.

<P>For the &s;ake of round numbers, and to be con|&s;iderably under the fact, &s;uppo&s;e that only twenty four millions of dollars, out of the above forty, had been funded in the name of purcha&s;ers at half a crown per pound. The intere&s;t, at &s;ix per cent. comes to fourteen hundred and forty thou&s;and dol|lars per annum. If this &s;um had remained in the pockets of tho&s;e who pay it, we &s;hould have been &s;aved from many of the burden&s;ome taxes which are &s;o heavy on the inhabitants of the &s;ea-port towns; and more or le&s;s &s;o upon every part of the country. Again, tho&s;e traders or manufacturers, who pay &s;uch taxes, mu&s;t always add more than the net addition, to indemnify them&s;elves for the trou|ble which attends it, as well as for the advance of money<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This circum&s;tance has been fully explained, and proved in <HI>The Political Progre&s;s of Britain.</HI></NOTE>. The enormous dearth of labour mu&s;t partly be deduced from this cau&s;e, and it produces, in an hundred different ways, inconvenience and
<PB N="121" REF="031906_0129_0FEF445334A82DC8">
backwardne&s;s to all &s;orts of bu&s;ine&s;s. The ex|pence of collecting or borrowing the money forms al&s;o a &s;erious item; and all the&s;e together, make a real lo&s;s to the public, by the&s;e twenty-four mil|lions of dollars, not merely of fourteen hundred and forty thou&s;and dollars, but of at lea&s;t three millions. This equals the whole principal &s;um that the buyers of the twenty-four millions advan|ced. Thus nominally we pay about fifty per cent. but in reality, at the lowe&s;t, an hundred per cent. of intere&s;t for the &s;um truly given before hand.</P>
<P>The common body of creditors mu&s;t have been very glad to &s;ee &s;ix millions of dollars. This would have doubled their principal and made a very &s;nug adventure. Judging by the &s;tatute of limitations, and other de&s;perate leaps of congre&s;&s;ional economy, we may be perfectly &s;ure that other creditors would not have got one &s;ixpenee more than they really ad|vanced, if it had not been to &s;erve as a &s;creen for the full gratification of Camillus and his myrmi|dons. They have ever &s;ince been con&s;tantly ha|ranguing the public about con&s;piracies. <HI>The greate&s;t rogue always turns king's witne&s;s,</HI> &s;ays the proverb. Nothing, &s;ince the new con&s;titution, has, within an hundred degrees, as much the appearance of a con|&s;piracy as this certificate bu&s;ine&s;s, unle&s;s, perhaps, the uproar which forced Congre&s;s to ratify the Bri|ti&s;h treaty.</P>
<P>This was the dawning &s;cene of that government who&s;e wi&s;dom and virtue have re&s;ounded through the four quarters of the globe.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. BACHE has compiled two volumes of &s;peeches on Jay's treaty, which were made in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of Congre&s;s, in &s;pring, 1796. It would have been a &s;ervice of &s;till more con&s;equence to this country, if he had re|printed a collection of the various narratives of Briti&s;h piracy on American ve&s;&s;els in the We&s;t-In|dies. This monument of bucanneering might have &s;erved as an u&s;eful curb to national vanity, and have taught us, if not quite incurable on that &s;ide,
<PB N="123" REF="031906_0131_0FEF3225E0544A78">
to apprehend the meanne&s;s of our pre&s;ent maritime condition. The deva&s;tation has been going on, with different degrees of violence, &s;ince the &s;ummer of 1793. A complete account of the&s;e piracies would very far exceed our pre&s;ent limits. A few exam|ples are here &s;elected from the ma&s;s; and begin|ning with the early part of the year 1796; &s;everal mi&s;cellaneous anecdotes and ob&s;ervations being oc|ca&s;ionally inter&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>A Salem new&s;paper, of March 8th, mentions the arrival of the &s;chooner John, captain Philip Saun|ders, from Jamaica. While he lay there, an Eng|li&s;h officer and five men, from a &s;loop of war, came on board to impre&s;s his crew. Only one of them happened to be on board, be&s;ides the mate and a boy. The re&s;t were on &s;hore on bu&s;ine&s;s. The gang t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;ailor. On being told that he was an Ame|ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y replied that they knew this, but wanted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and would have them, whatever might be the con&s;equence. Captain Saunders went on board of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">p of war, to reclaim his &s;eaman. The com|mander told him to go back to his own ve&s;&s;el, make out his account of the wages due to the hand, and &s;end them and his clothes to the &s;loop. In ca&s;e of non-compliance, he was threatened with a &s;logging. Whether he obeyed this order, we are not told. The re&s;t of the crew were &s;ecreted on &s;hore by the captain, for ten days, till the &s;loop of war &s;ailed, as her declared de&s;ign was to impre&s;s the whole. Du|ring this time, the &s;chooner lay expo&s;ed to the weather, as well as the in&s;ults of the &s;loop of war, without any per&s;on to take care of her, except the captain, his mate, and the boy. The &s;loop's crew con&s;i&s;ted of eighty-&s;even men. Of the&s;e, <HI>thirty-five</HI> were &s;aid to be Americans, who had been impre&s;&s;ed in the We&s;t-Indies. Such, at the di&s;tance of twenty months, was the &s;ucce&s;s of Jay's appeal to the <HI>mag|nanimity</HI>
<PB N="124" REF="031906_0132_0FEF445832575440">
of George Guelph, and of his ki&s;&s;ing the hand of <Q>the meat, drink, &s;nuff, and diamond-loving dame.</Q> Captain Saunders further inform|ed, that &s;everal ve&s;&s;els belonging to the &s;outhern &s;tates, were lying at Jamaica, when he left it, with|out &s;eamen to navigate them home.

<P>Early, as it &s;eems, in the year 1796, captain Sa|muel Green made a voyage from Norfolk, in Virgi|nia, to Martinico. He had the command of a fa&s;t-&s;ailing &s;chooner, of three bundred barrels burden, and carried a cargo for the Briti&s;h at that i&s;land.
<PB N="125" REF="031906_0133_0FEF445C9B60B678">
On his arrival, the con&s;ignee &s;hewed him a bill of &s;ale of the ve&s;&s;el, and told him, that he was no longer ma&s;ter, becau&s;e the &s;chooner was bought for the <HI>Briti&s;h government,</HI> and to be fitted out as a privateer. If captain Green cho&s;e to remain on board, he was told that he might have employment. This offer he refu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed. Several of the &s;ailors were <HI>impre&s;&s;ed by the Briti&s;h.</HI> Others were enticed to en|ter as volunteers in the different &s;hips. This was the treament which other American crews, in the &s;ame trade, met with as well as his. The&s;e priva|teers, when thus fitted out, were to intercept our &s;hipping in their way to the We&s;t-Indies. Thus the United States furni&s;hed privateers and &s;eamen for the de&s;truction of their own commerce. This is one proof, among many, of the indifference of &s;ome American owners to the per&s;onal &s;afety of their &s;ailors. Captain Green arrived from Marti|nico at Baltimore, about the 14th of March, 1796. He related the above particulars to Colonel Low|ry of that town, who gave them for publication to the author. Put the ca&s;e, that a merchant of Liverpool were to freight a ve&s;&s;el for Calais or Pe|ter&s;burg, with the previous but concealed certain|ty before him, that the &s;hip was to be &s;old; the captain turned adrift without warning, and the crew to be &s;educed or pre&s;&s;ed into the Ru&s;&s;ian or the French &s;ervice. The atte&s;ted recital of &s;uch a fact would make the owner completely odious to the public. But, in this country, a &s;eries of &s;uch tran&s;actions does not excite the &s;malle&s;t emotion, or even attention. About twenty-five years ago, an Engli&s;h &s;ailor at Dantzie, was entrapped by a recruiting party, belonging to the late king of Pru&s;|&s;ia. The man got a letter conveyed to England, and though Frederic po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in all its vigour, the faculty of retention, yet he found it nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="126" REF="031906_0134_0FEF445FCF57DF28">
to give Jack his freedom. The &s;tory was printed in the Engli&s;h new&s;papers, and became, for a &s;hort time, a topic of conver&s;ation. Compare this &s;en|&s;ibility to national rights, with the &s;elfi&s;h American apathy, and &s;ay which of the two countries has the greate&s;t appearance of being <HI>enlightened.</HI></P>
<P>A new&s;paper of this city, of the 15th of March, 1796, contained a narrative &s;ub&s;cribed by Jacob Peter&s;on, ma&s;ter of the &s;loop Polly, of Philadelphia. He &s;ays that, on the 29th of January, 1796, he ar|rived at cape Nicola Mole, where he had &s;carcely ca&s;t anchor, when the Syren, a Briti&s;h &s;ixty-four, pre&s;&s;ed one of his be&s;t &s;eamen. On the 31&s;t, he &s;ailed for Jeremie. While he remained in that port, about nine o'clock in the evening, of the 9th of February, captain Reynolds, of the Harriot, a Briti&s;h armed &s;hip in government &s;ervice, manned his boat and pre&s;&s;ed &s;everal American &s;eamen from different &s;hips in the harbour. He began with the &s;hip Carolina, of Baltimore, captain Lu&s;her.</P>
<P>Next day, Reynolds, when on &s;hore, &s;wore that he would that night make a &s;weep among the Ame|ricans. The latter, hearing of this threat, a&s;&s;em|bled them&s;elves into two ve&s;&s;els that lay in the har|bour, one of them the brig Richard and James of Philadelphia, and the other the &s;chooner Eliza of Baltimore. About nine o'clock in the evening, a boat full of armed men was ob&s;erved coming from the Harriot towards the Eliza. She was hailed and enjoined to keep her di&s;tance. Reynolds cau&s;ed his men to fire. This was returned; and, after &s;ometime, the boat went off. She came back with a fre&s;h &s;upply of men, and again found it prudent to retire. The people in the Eliza then went on board of the Richard and James. Reynolds went on &s;hore, obtained a reinforcemt, and came back to a third a&s;&s;ault. Finding the Eliza de&s;erted he
<PB N="127" REF="031906_0135_0FEF4461F792F590">
gave up the attempt. In this conte&s;t, the Briti&s;h &s;aid that they had &s;eventeen men killed or woun|ded. The Americans had one killed, and one wounded.</P>
<P>The above account, as to what happened at port Jeremie, was almo&s;t immediately confirmed by the arrival of captain Webb, of the brig Nymph. Cap|tain Webb added, that the Americans had pre&s;ented a petition to the commandant at Jeremie, admiral Murray, for the recovery of their impre&s;&s;ed men, and &s;atisfaction for the behaviour of Reynolds. Murray an&s;wered, that he had given no orders for the impre&s;s, and that he would u&s;e <HI>his influence</HI> to get the men re&s;tored; but, when captain Webb left Jeremie, there was no appearance of that taking place. The an&s;wer of Murray was mere mockery. Reynolds dur&s;t not have fired a pi&s;tol again&s;t the real inclination of the admiral. A Briti&s;h officer, in the river Thames, dur&s;t no more impre&s;s a &s;ea|man without orders, than he dur&s;t &s;et fire to the city. For the bare lo&s;s of &s;o many men, indepen|dent of other circum&s;tances, he would have been called to a mo&s;t &s;evere account, even at Jeremie, unle&s;s he had acted by expre&s;s orders, or conniv|ance.</P>
<P>On this affair, Web&s;ter has a curious para|graph<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Minerva, March 17, 1796.</NOTE>. In &s;pite of his Briti&s;h pen&s;ion, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;ave appearances, by &s;aying &s;omething about it.

<P>On the 28th of March, 1796, the &s;hip Bacchus, captain George, arrived at Philadelphia. On the 20th he was boarded by the Thetis, a Briti&s;h fri|gate. She pre&s;&s;ed his mate and cabin boy, on a &s;u&s;picion of their being Briti&s;h &s;ubjects. The boy was an indented apprentice.</P>
<P>As it is proper to do ju&s;tice to all parties, it may here be noticed that, at this time, captain Burnet, of the brig George, arrived in Philadelphia from King&s;ton, and brought a complaint of the French privateers. He &s;aid that &s;everal of them were crui&s;ing off Jamaica, when he left it. They were very trouble&s;ome to American ve&s;&s;els, &s;ometimes plundering them of their &s;ea &s;tores, and otherwi&s;e behaving with the greate&s;t in&s;olence. No farther particulars are &s;pecified; and this is the fir&s;t com|plaint again&s;t France, or at mo&s;t the &s;econd, which hath as yet occurred in collecting materials for the pre&s;ent &s;ummary of piracies. At the &s;ame time, &s;everal articles of Briti&s;h rapine have been omitted for want of room. So contra&s;ted at that period, was the conduct of the&s;e two nations to this country!</P>
<P>A gentleman at King&s;ton in Jamaica, in a letter to the printers of the Maryland Journal, dated the 25th of February, 1796, gave the following par|ticulars. The Argonaut man of war of &s;ixty-four guns, had, a few days before, &s;ent into King&s;ton, two American ve&s;&s;els. The one was the &s;chooner Swallow, captain Stubbs, from Cape Francois to Bo&s;ton. Her cargo con&s;i&s;ted of cotton and coffee, with &s;ix thou&s;and dollars in &s;pecie. The whole
<PB N="133" REF="031906_0141_0FEF43A18BCB3DC8">
property belonged to Mr. Tri&s;dale of Bo&s;ton. The other ve&s;&s;el was the &s;chooner Paragon of Norfolk, laden with coffee, and owned by Mr. Mo&s;es Myers of that town. In June, 1794, coffee co&s;t in re|tail, at Philadelphia, about a &s;hilling per pound. In June, 1795, it had got up to one &s;hilling and four pence. By November, 1796, if not &s;ooner, it ro&s;e to two &s;hillings and four pence. The pira|cies ju&s;t now &s;tated, which are only part of hun|dreds of the &s;ame kind, explain, very fully, the cau&s;e of this alteration. The writer of the above letter added that both ve&s;&s;els were libelled, and that indeed <HI>none need expect to e&s;cape that fate,</HI> whatever might be the final verdict about them. The very delay, di&s;appointment, and ri&s;e of in&s;u|rance, in con&s;equence of &s;uch alarms, impo&s;e a ruinous tax on the owners, while, in the mean time, the &s;ailors were frequently pre&s;&s;ed. Sometimes they were &s;wept off by the yellow fever; and car|goes of a peri&s;hable nature were often de&s;troy|ed while the &s;hip waited for a deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;ame letter adds that the &s;chooner Volup|tas, Jonathan Hall, ma&s;ter, of Baltimore, had been &s;ent into King&s;ton, by the Severn of forty-four guns. She had on board a valuable cargo of cof|fee and cotton, and part of an outward bound freight of provi&s;ions, with a large &s;um of money. The &s;upercargo, Mr. Duncan, was going from Gonaives to the Platform, to purcha&s;e coffee to load the &s;loop for Baltimore The pretence for &s;ending in the Voluptas was, that &s;he carried pro|vi&s;ions for an enemy's port. At this time, the captain of the Severn had kept Mr. Duncan a pri|&s;oner for fifty-two days, and threatened to try him, as a Briti&s;h &s;ubject, for high trea&s;on; al|though he had with him a certificate of his being an American citizen.</P>

From the brig this jacobin took a bar|rel of beef, and paid fifteen dollars for it. Thus far the letter to the printers of the Maryland jour|nal.</P>
<P>A Philadelphia print of the 26th of March, 1796, contained an extract of a letter dated March 2d, from Bermuda. The writer mentions that the &s;hip Hannah, captain Hoare, from Philadelphia to France, was, on the 24th of February, taken by the Lynx &s;loop of war. She &s;tript the Hannah of her whole crew, excepting the mate, the cook, and the cabin boy, and &s;ent her into Bermuda. Mo&s;t of the hands impre&s;&s;ed had protections. The captain of the Lynx had &s;poke, on the day before, with the Roebuck of Philadelphia, and &s;aid that he was prevented from taking her by a violent gale of wind.</P>
<P>An article dated Salem, the 22d of March, gives what is called <HI>verbal information by captain Blacker.</HI> Part of it is in &s;ub&s;tance as follows:</P>
<P>On the night of the 22d of January, 1796, the pre&s;s gang at Liverpool crimped an American &s;ea|man, having previou&s;ly &s;erved &s;everal others in the &s;ame way. Two hundred and fifty American &s;ailors a&s;&s;embled, went to the hou&s;e of rendezvous of the gang, and re&s;cued their companion. They placed the officers of the impre&s;s in the centre of the room, obliged them to uncover, and give three cheers to
<PB N="136" REF="031906_0144_0FEF44715D784020">
the United States. On the 27th, another American was impre&s;&s;ed. His countrymen again a&s;&s;embled, re&s;cued the man, killed one of the gang, threw ano|ther into the dock, where he was drowned and &s;e|verely beat the remainder, who fled.</P>
<P>On the 2d of February, the American captains were called before the mayor and magi&s;trates of Liverpool. They were admoni&s;hed to keep their crews in order. They made an an&s;wer which mu&s;t have occurred to any body excepting a member of Congre&s;s vindicating appropriations for the Briti&s;h treaty. The account adds that, from thence for|ward, the Americans were unmole&s;ted.</P>
<P>About the 29th of March, 1796, the &s;hip Friend|&s;hip, captain Atkins, arrived at Norfolk. The cap|tain &s;aid that, within the capes of Che&s;apeake, he was boarded by a boat from the Thetis, captain Coch|ran, which pre&s;&s;ed a man who had been naturalized for ten years pa&s;t. As the Che&s;apeake is within the territory of the United States, the Briti&s;h might as decently have taken him from the &s;treets of Phi|ladelphia. A letter from New-York to a merchant in Philadelphia, dated the 2d of April, informed that his &s;hip, the Ocean, captain Vredenburgh, had been taken on the 31&s;t ult. and &s;ent into Halifax by La Prevoyance, a Briti&s;h frigate. The whole crew, at the time of writing the letter, were detained on board of the frigate, except the ma&s;ter, the fir&s;t mate and a boy. The Ocean was from Havre-de-Grace, and the frigate took her, not far from the Highlands, with a pilot on board. The Argus, of April 4th, &s;ays, that before &s;he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for Halifax, <Q>&s;everal pa&s;&s;engers were mo&s;t graciou&s;ly permitted to jump into the long boat, and come up to New-York.</Q> When captain Vredenburgh remon&s;trated, the Bri|ti&s;h captain told him that this conduct was ju&s;tified by Jay's treaty. The Minerva &s;ays that the Ocean

was taken three days before &s;he made land. But the Connecticut godde&s;s of wi&s;dom is di&s;tingui&s;hed for want of veracity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Web&s;ter is a native of that &s;tate.</NOTE>. It is at lea&s;t very uncommon to take in a pilot, at &s;uch a di&s;tance from &s;hore; and it is agreed that the Ocean had one. While the Briti&s;h were thus plundering American &s;hip|ping, Mr. Pickering received a letter from Mr. Samuel Bayard, dated London, 29th of December, 1795. The following extract appeared, on the 31&s;t of March, 1796, in the Philadelphia Gazette.</P>
<Q><P>In the cour&s;e of this next month, the Judge of the Admiralty has authorized us to expect an order for the re&s;titution of the ve&s;&s;els and car|goes &s;eized and &s;old by &s;ir J. Jarvis and &s;ir Charles Grey, at Martinico, St. Lucia and Gua|daloupe.</P>
<P>In the Court of Appeals, al&s;o, two illegal &s;en|tences of the Vice-Admiralty Courts, in the We&s;t-Indies, have lately been annulled, and the con|duct of the judges &s;everely cen&s;ured by the Lords commi&s;&s;ioners of appeals.</P></Q>
<P>This intelligence, as if worth a peru&s;al, was communicated by Mr. Pickering to the Committee of Merchants in this city, appointed to &s;uperintend the bu&s;ine&s;s of indemnification. Nothing but the blindne&s;s of intere&s;ted hope, could have drawn any comfort from &s;uch an account. The attainment of an object is at a very indefinite di&s;tance, when the parties are only <HI>authorized to expect.</HI> The an|nulling of two piracies, out of five or &s;ix hundred, was merely ca&s;ting a tub to the whale. As for the cen&s;ure be&s;towed on the We&s;t-Indian judges, how much it was in earne&s;t, and how much it was re|&s;pected, appears from their per&s;i&s;ting, at that very moment, to proceed in the &s;ame track. There
<PB N="138" REF="031906_0146_0FEF447A81EF9EE8">
could not be a more palpable delu&s;ion, though in|deed the thinne&s;s of the di&s;gui&s;e almo&s;t precludes it from that name. The Briti&s;h had been plunder|ing American merchantmen for almo&s;t three years. A treaty, which was to &s;top every proceeding of the kind, had been ratified eight months before. Yet &s;till piracy and impre&s;sment went on at full vigour. But when we con&s;ider the uncommonly petrified ideas of many merchants in the &s;ea-ports of America, nothing but the mo&s;t &s;nivelling timidity could be looked for. In &s;ummer, 1793, Briti&s;h effrontery declared the French republic in <HI>a &s;tate of &s;iege;</HI> and, under that pretence, confi&s;cated Ame|rican ve&s;&s;els freighted for any French port with provi&s;ions, as if France and her colonies had only been &s;ome fortified town with an area of a &s;quare mile. At that cri&s;is, merchants of eminence in this city were to be found who vindicated that enormous robbery. If, in a &s;imilar &s;ituation, any citizen of London had harboured &s;uch feelings, the certainty of public abhorrence would at lea&s;t have forced him to hold his tongue. When captain Barney, about that time, made a voyage to the We&s;t-Indies, and declared his determination, if attacked, of giving battle to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Blackbeard, the tory par|ty in Philadelphia were violent in his condemnation. A report having reached the continent, that the Engli&s;h at Jamaica had re&s;olved to hang him, it was &s;olemnly pronounced, in this city, to be perfectly right; and that he was an incendiary who wanted to embroil the two countries. It was to be expec|ted that &s;uch people would abominate the American Annual Regi&s;ter as <HI>the verie&s;t catch-penny that ever was publi&s;hed, the mere tittle tattle of jacobini&s;m</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Gazette of the United States.</NOTE>.

It cannot e&s;cape ob&s;ervation that the above notice from Bay|ard contains not one &s;yllable about the impre&s;&s;ment of &s;ailors. This blank in Jay's treaty, and Bayard's commi&s;&s;ion, may be compared to the capitulation of a general, who, without a &s;ingle &s;tipulation about protecting the &s;ick and wounded men of his army, thinks of nothing but the &s;ecurity and free depar|ture of his baggage.</P>
<P>Captain Paulding, of the brig Polly, in a letter to his owners, at New-York from Curracoa, dated March 3d, &s;ays that he had been &s;ent into Grenada, by the Favourite &s;loop of war, after &s;he had taken from him <HI>all his hands,</HI> with &s;ailing orders, letters, invoices, and bills of lading. He was detained for &s;ome weeks. At length he had orders to depart, but could not recover his papers. His cargo was, he &s;ays, con&s;iderably damaged by his detention. He does not tell whether he got back any of his men, which is very unlikely, or by what means he work|ed the ve&s;&s;el to Curracoa.</P>
<P>The Maryland Journal, of the 13th of April, 1797, has an extract of a letter from an American &s;eaman, dated Spithead, December <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">6th, 1795, on board the &s;hip A&s;&s;i&s;tance, in which &s;he had been detained from the 20th of October preceding.

In private morals, they were ju&s;t as good as other people. But, in a political light, they were at be&s;t concealed, and often profe&s;&s;ed enemies. In pri|vate life, no man would lodge under his roof an in|cendiary who, for eight years, had been attempting to burn his hou&s;e. At the la&s;t election for Congre&s;s, in the county of Philadelphia, one of the mo&s;t offici|ous of the <HI>federal</HI> managers had formerly acted as a Briti&s;h guide.

<P>Captain Elkanah Mayo, who arrived in town this week from New-York, has favoured us with the following ac|count of the cruel treatment he and his men received from the officers and men of the Briti&s;h frigate La Pique, at Bar|badoes, in December la&s;t, viz. Captain Mayo, in the &s;hip Polly, of Cape Ann, homeward bound, from a whaling voy|age, was drove in by &s;tre&s;s of weather to Barbadoes, where he lay near three weeks for the arrival of &s;ome Americans to freight his oil home; during which time, the Briti&s;h fri|gate La Pique arrived there from a crui&s;e, and in two days after, pre&s;&s;ed two of his hands. Captain Mayo applied to the governor for protection, who cau&s;ed the men to be re|lea&s;ed; three days after, captain Mayo's boat, being a&s;hore with three men waiting for him, the frigate's barge hauled in clo&s;e to his boat, and boarded him with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">utla&s;&s;es, to pre&s;s the men by force. The men called on captain Mayo, from the &s;hore, who run to the boat for their relief, where he found the crew of the Briti&s;h frigate with the tiller of their barge, beating his men over their heads, with &s;aid tiller, till the blood gu&s;hed from their mouths and no&s;es, and otherwi&s;e mangling them in a barbarous and &s;hocking manner. Captain Mayo &s;prung into the boat and cleared it of the Briti&s;h crew. The commanding officer, who was then on the wharf, &s;aid he would have every man aboard the &s;hip. Mr. Woodruff, with whom captain Mayo did bu&s;ine&s;s, being on the wharf, offered his bonds to the captain of the frigate that he would bring his protections on &s;hore. Captain Mayo then went on board his &s;hip to bring his protections. While he was on board, the commanding officer of the frigate, and all the re&s;t of the officers, got into their barge, waiting for captain Mayo, who was returning with all his protections; they boarded him; the commanding officer jumped into captain Mayo's boat with his drawn cutla&s;s, and dragged by force all
<PB N="144" REF="031906_0152_0FEF44898793A2E0">
his men into their barge, and then pre&s;ented his cutla&s;s to capt. Mayo's brea&s;t, and ordered him into the barge, which he refu|&s;ed; after which he pricked him &s;everal times in the brea&s;t, and then towed him on board the frigate; he put capt. Mayo's men into the hole among his men who were &s;ick with the yellow fever; he then ordered a pair of irons to be fixed on captain Mayo, which were not, however, fixed; he kept him on the quarter-deck until evening, then ordered captain Mayo's boat to be hauled up, and ordered him on board alone. Capt. Mayo reque&s;ted him to let him have a man to go with him, which the captain of the frigate refu&s;ed; then &s;aid he would ca&s;t him off, and let him go adrift, he told him he might peri&s;h at &s;ea, to which he replied, he hoped he would. Captain Mayo told him he would not go, unle&s;s he ca&s;t him off, he then took his barge, and towed captain Mayo on board his own &s;hip; the next morning captain Mayo went to the go|vernor, and complained of the officers' conduct; the gover|nor ordered his men to be immediately relea&s;ed, who were accordingly &s;ent on &s;hore. Four days after, three of his men were taken with the yellow fever, which they took while on board the frigate, and which &s;pread through captain Mayo's &s;hip's company: four of his men died of the fever, the re&s;t were obliged to leave the &s;hip, and he hired negroes to pump her. Captain Mayo then chartered ve&s;&s;els as he could find them to take his men and cargo to the United States. This ba&s;e conduct of our new-treaty-allies occa&s;ioned the lo&s;s of eight thou&s;and dollars to his owners.</P>

<P>While the Briti&s;h were going on at this rate, a letter, dated January 17th, was received in Phila|delphia, from Samuel Bayard, agent for the United States, at London, on the bu&s;ine&s;s of re&s;titution. Mr. Bayard writes thus:</P>
<P><Q>As &s;oon as mini&s;try learn the line of conduct, which the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives mean to pur|&s;ue, I am per&s;uaded their conduct, as it regards us, will be le&s;s fluctuating. Should the hou&s;e co|incide with the Pre&s;ident and Senate, every thing here will go well: &s;hould ob&s;tacles, on the other
<PB N="145" REF="031906_0153_0FEF448D6B2E4E58">
hand, be thrown in the way by the popular branch of the government, I doubt whether the we&s;tern po&s;ts will be &s;urrendered, or <HI>re&s;titution made of our captured property.</HI> However, I tru&s;t that every man who has any regard to the <HI>honour,</HI> the <HI>faith,</HI> or <HI>intere&s;t</HI> of his country, will &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of carrying the treaty fully into effect, &s;o far as regards the United States.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;cope of the letter is, that, if Congre&s;s ap|propriated for Mr. Jay's treaty, compen&s;ation would be made for the piracies in the We&s;t-Indies. If they did not, the prizes would be kept. This plainly infers, that the Briti&s;h were acting as con|&s;ummate bucanneers. For, whether the treaty pa&s;t or not, they had no title to have taken the&s;e ve&s;|&s;els. But the &s;uperior talents of Mr. Jay had happily interwoven two matters totally di&s;tinct. If you &s;ign this treaty of commerce, you &s;hall get compen|&s;ation for the ve&s;&s;els. If not, we &s;hall have them to our&s;elves. Before entering upon the old &s;tory of debts due to Britain; of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, and of matters relative to the la&s;t war; before plunging into treaties of amity, the recent &s;eizure of the ve&s;&s;els &s;hould have been fully and &s;eparately &s;ettled. If that could be done, it was time enough to get into a treaty. If it could not be done, the way for America was to have &s;tood by in wait for con|tingencies, while an embargo on provi&s;ions would have laid the Briti&s;h We&s;t-Indies pro&s;trate at her feet. In&s;tead of this obvious policy, matters the mo&s;t di&s;tinct were all jumbled together; and the bait of compen&s;ation made America &s;nap at the gilded hook.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In ju&s;tice to Mr. Jay, it mu&s;t be believed that his conduct was af|fected by &s;ome rea&s;ons not yet communicated to the public. The application of the following anecdote cannot be mi&s;taken. It &s;hews the frequent appeals that Pitt makes to Macedonian logic.</P>
<P>On the 9th of February, 1794, colonel Whitlock wrote a letter to general Lavaux, who commanded at Port-au-Paix, in St. Do|mingo. He required Lavaux to deliver up the town, the forts, and &s;hipping. He then, in the name of the Briti&s;h government, adds thus: <Q>The &s;um of FIVE THOUSAND CROWNS TOURNOIS &s;hall be paid to you in per&s;on, or depo&s;ited in the bank of England, payable to your order.</Q></P>
<P>In his an&s;wer, Lavaux &s;ays, <Q>permit me now to complain to your&s;elf, of the indignity you have offered me, in thinking me &s;o vile, &s;o flagitious, &s;o ba&s;e, as not to re&s;ent,</Q> &amp;c. He concludes with &s;ending Whitlock a challenge immediately to meet and fight him. See New Annual Regi&s;ter for 1794, Hi&s;tory, p. 338.</P>
<P>But if Port-au-Paix was worth five thou&s;and crowns to England, Jay's treaty was worth fifty millions. The Repre&s;entatives were in the direct way to the de&s;truction of the Briti&s;h We&s;t-Indies. A &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of commercial intercour&s;e, and an embargo, would have re|duced both England and tho&s;e colonies to the utmo&s;t difficulty. The&s;e two mea&s;ures would have broke no treaty, nor afforded any pretence for a quarrel, and they would have humbled England too much to leave her any appetite for the wanton declaration of ho&s;tili|ties. All this was &s;o evident, the track pur&s;ued by the Repre&s;enta|tives was marked with &s;uch luminous circum&s;tances of invitation, that nothing but ignorance, corruption, or the mo&s;t abject imbeci|lity of under&s;tanding, could mi&s;take it.</P>
<P>Like Sennacherib's angel, Camillus interfered to &s;ugge&s;t an ex|pre&s;s libel on Congre&s;s, to tarni&s;h the character, to undermine the intere&s;t, and to ham&s;tring the vengeance of America. With a me&s;|&s;age &s;o welcome, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, to the very being of the court of Lon|don, Jay mu&s;t have been a favourite gue&s;t. And, after the &s;acrifi|ces which he made, if he did not pay due attention to the future in|dependence of his family, he is a greater &s;impleton than the world can po&s;&s;ibly think him to be.</P></NOTE> Suppo&s;e that one of her neighbours

<P>On the 8th of April, 1796, a Philadelphia print contained the following extract of a letter from London, dated February 2d.</P>
<P><Q>I this moment came from the court of admi|ralty, where the fir&s;t ca&s;e of the captures at Mar|tinique, by Grey and Jervis, was tried this mor|ning: it was rever&s;ed, which will be a precedent for all the others, and a point gained for all of us that have ca&s;es in the courts here. And now they &s;ay, on Saturday next, the lords will &s;it, and will go on to try the legality of the condem|nations in the We&s;t-Indies.</Q></P>
<P>As to <HI>the point gained for all of us,</HI> there is yet very little progre&s;s made, nor is it of much concern to the claimants whether there is or not. The above, and Mr. Bayard's letter, are quoted chiefly becau&s;e they contain not even one &s;ingle, &s;olitary, word, about the relief of the &s;ailors, who had been torn from their families, and their country, &s;tar|ved, hand-cuffed, and flogged, to make them en|rol in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.

<P><PB N="149" REF="031906_0157_0FEF4378E74E1688">As Mr. Hamilton has betrayed &s;o much concern for Briti&s;h creditors, it may be a&s;ked why he does not feel equal intere&s;t in the &s;tate of Maryland? Before the war that province had ve&s;ted con&s;idera|ble &s;ums of money in the bank of England. On the 17th of December, 1795, a &s;elect committee re|ported to the legi&s;lature of that &s;tate, that <Q>they have no information as to the probability of their recovering the &s;tocks in the bank of England, to which they claim a title.</Q> When Jay took &s;o much care for the &s;afety of Briti&s;h creditors in American funds, he might likewi&s;e have paid &s;ome attention to the intere&s;t of Maryland in the Briti&s;h funds.</P>
<P>The tenth article of the treaty contains a plain commentary on this &s;toppage of Maryland property. It &s;ays that <Q>neither the debts due from individu|als of the one nation to individuals of the other, nor &s;hares nor monies which they may have in the public funds, or in the public or private banks, &s;hall ever, in any event of war or national differ|ence, be &s;eque&s;tered or confi&s;cated, <HI>it being unju&s;t and impolitic, &amp;c.</HI></Q> Why then did England &s;eque&s;|trate, or with what pretence of decency does &s;he continue to keep the funds of Maryland?

The Senate and Pre&s;ident ra|tified this in&s;ult on the Repre&s;entatives, though, as being a &s;olemn act of government, it contained an attack on the American legi&s;lature, a million of times more flagrant than the tran&s;itory &s;quib of

But indeed no Engli&s;h mini&s;ter dared to have made &s;uch a di|gre&s;&s;ion. In di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the treaty, none of the Re|pre&s;entatives adverted to this tacit reproach. The pul&s;e of national dignity &s;eems to beat higher in England than in the United States.</P>
<P>Camillus clamours loudly about the iniquity of America in neglecting the payment of debts due to Britain, before the la&s;t war. What here follows, on that head, was related to the author, in January 1796, by Mr. James Madi&s;on.</P>
<P>Much noi&s;e has been made about the ju&s;tice of America, in neglecting the payment of debts due to Britain before the la&s;t war. In Virginia, it was formerly u&s;ual for the planters, in that country, to con&s;ign their cargoes of tobacco to a corre&s;pondent in Britain, who was ve&s;ted with a di&s;cretionary power of &s;elling them as high as po&s;&s;ible. It was often ob&s;erved, that when two planters had each of them, at the &s;ame time, &s;ent cargoes of tobacco of equally good quality to England, the one received perhaps twenty pounds the hog&s;head, and his neigh|bour not more than four pounds. There was no regularity or equality in the prices, and this gave ri&s;e to complaints and &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>Sometime ago, a gentleman, in Virginia, brought a counter-action again&s;t his Briti&s;h creditor, in one of the courts of that &s;tate. His plea was, that the creditor and con&s;ignee had actually &s;old his tobac|co in Europe at a much higher price than <HI>he had &s;ta|ted in balancing their accounts.</HI> The facts alledged

<P>THIS chapter begins with a few in&s;tances of the maritime conduct of France and England, that occurred about, or previous to, the commencement of the year 1796. They had been omitted for the &s;ake of brevity. But while this work is printing off, Pre&s;ident Adams, and a formidable phalanx in the fifth Congre&s;s, are driving the federal chariot, at full &s;peed, to the brink of a French war. One great pretence for this mea&s;ure is the republican robberies on our &s;hipping in the We&s;t-Indies. But if it can be proved that our commerce endured greater injury, in 1796, from England, than it hath &s;ince done from France, and that the government

<P>A letter from Port-au-Paix, dated the 18th of December, 1795, to a merchant in Philadelphia, Has the following particulars. Anthoine Chaplin, captain of the Guillotine, a French privateer, had maltreated captain M'Keever of the American &s;hip James. For that and a &s;imilar offence again&s;t the &s;hip Molleville, of St. Thomas, Chaplin was fined in two hundred dollars, and all damages that might accrue from the illegal capture of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els. His privateer was confi&s;cated; and the pirate him|&s;elf was condemned to fifteen months of impri&s;on|ment in irons. <Q>I this day &s;aw him, &s;ays the let|ter-writer, chained with a negro working in the &s;treet, in the &s;ame kind of dre&s;s in which he for|ced captain M'Keever to leave the privateer and go on board an American ve&s;&s;el. So much for our Laveaux's ju&s;tice.</Q></P>
<P>Anthoine Chaplin was le&s;s culpable than Reynolds, and other Engli&s;h kidnappers. His puni&s;hment was immediate and complete; but we have never

But we have never been told of their flogging American &s;eamen, to make them enter into the republican &s;ervice. The convul&s;ive &s;tate of the French We&s;t-Indies was well known. Anarchy, conflagration, and ma&s;&s;acre, &s;trode &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively from one i&s;land to another. If a merchant in Philadelphia, cho&s;e to &s;end his cargo to &s;uch a market, he could expect no better reception, nor did he, in all ca&s;es, merit much &s;ympathy. The&s;e &s;peculators rai&s;ed the price of flour from &s;even dollars per barrel, to fifteen, to the utter oppre&s;&s;ion of the labouring poor in this and other &s;eaport towns. In Britain, neither the laws, nor even the people would have endured &s;uch fore&s;talling.</NOTE>.

The fact &s;eems to have been this. The Directory &s;till valu|ed federal friend&s;hip as &s;omething; while Pitt held it as <HI>nothing.</HI></P>
<P>On the 4th of January, the &s;chooner Hiram, cap|tain Brooks, arrived at Hartford in Connecticut. He related, that the Sea Hor&s;e, captain Smith, from Guadaloupe for Bo&s;ton, had all her crew, excepting the ma&s;ter and fir&s;t mate, taken out by an Engli&s;h &s;hip. She was &s;ent to Antigua, and relea&s;ed, but her crew were detained on board of the &s;hip that took them.</P>
<P>A more complete account of the &s;ufferings of captain Smith and his people, was given by him|&s;elf, dated Baltimore, January 5th, 1796. On the
<PB N="154" REF="031906_0162_0FEF43AD6F762580">
13th of November, preceding, he was taken by the frigate Re&s;ource, captain Watkins. Five of his men, two of whom had the fever, were impre&s;&s;ed. A prize-ma&s;ter and four men were put on board of the Sea-Hor&s;e. They confined captain Smith for three days below, under the guard of two men with drawn cutla&s;&s;es, and loaded pi&s;tols. While captain Smith was on board of the Re&s;ource, he was ill treated by a mid&s;hipman; and told him that he would not be in&s;ulted by a boy. Captain Wat|kins &s;aid, that, if he had heard the expre&s;&s;ion, he would have tied up and flogged Smith for daring to in&s;ult his <HI>maje&s;ty's officer.</HI> To the feelings of an <HI>enlightened federali&s;t,</HI> this language may be acceptable. Watkins offered him two hundred pounds, and a &s;hare of the prize-money, to &s;ay that <HI>the &s;hip was French property.</HI> At Antigua, the fir&s;t mate of the Sea Hor&s;e died, and the pre&s;ident cau|&s;ed his body to be thrown into the &s;ea. He al&s;o &s;ent a pilot and negroes on board to carry the ve&s;&s;el out to &s;ea. Captain Smith offered to knock them down. The pre&s;ident &s;ent for him, and threatened to cau&s;e the fort to fire into the ve&s;&s;el, if &s;he did not go out to &s;ea, either with men or without them. On Smith's refu&s;al, the pre&s;ident &s;aid that he would have him confined. What a &s;plendid blaze of Bri|ti&s;h honour and ho&s;pitality! And how fondly would Noah Web&s;ter have chuckled over it, if the &s;cene had only pa&s;t in a French port in&s;tead of an Eng|li&s;h one! Watkins had brought three other Ameri|can prizes into Antigua. He cut them out of a port in Guadaloupe; and, their regi&s;ters being in the of|fice on &s;hore, he boa&s;ted of them as a &s;ure prey. They were, notwith&s;tanding, di&s;charged. How captain Smith got hands to work his ve&s;&s;el to Baltimore does not appear. Two leagues from Cape Henry, he was boarded by admiral Murray, who, as if the
<PB N="155" REF="031906_0163_0FEF43E7A6B491C0">
poor man had not already &s;uffered enough, took from him Wilkin&s;on Gilt, a mate whom he had &s;hipped at Antigua. Somebody called citizen Hughes, is &s;incerely thanked for &s;upplying him with part of a crew. But whether this was Victor Hughes, or where the help was given, we are left in the dark.</P>
<P>On the 8th of January, 1796, the brig Experi|ence, captain Hou&s;ton, arrived from Port-au-Prince at Philadelphia. He informed, that three Briti&s;h &s;hips of war, at the former place, pre&s;&s;ed every American who could not produce a protection. They were chiefly manned with American &s;eamen. A number of our ve&s;&s;els, lying at Port-au-Prince, were in a mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation for want of hands.</P>
<P>A letter from St. Kitts, dated 4th January, 1796, and received by a merchant of Philadelphia, &s;ays, that the brig Fame, captain Medlin, of this port, was about to &s;ail for it. The letter adds, that &s;he had been plundered by a French privateer, but gives no particulars.</P>
<P>On the 17th of January, the Mu&s;quito, captain Har&s;haw, arrived at Baltimore from Bourdeaux. On the voyage, he was met by the Hu&s;&s;ar, a Briti&s;h frigate. His keys were taken, his che&s;ts broke up, and every thing &s;tolen that the Briti&s;h could lay their hands on. They al&s;o drank a ca&s;e of his wine, and pre&s;&s;ed the Mu&s;quito's mate, and one of the hands, who was an American.</P>
<P>Thus far we have in&s;tances of Briti&s;h piracy, for|merly overlooked or omitted, as ob&s;erved in the beginning of this chapter. The reader mu&s;t have become tired with this uniform and di&s;gu&s;ting tale of our commercial degradation. As a relief to the melancholy picture, let us turn, for a moment, to the debates on the Briti&s;h treaty. The enthu&s;ia&s;m of attachment which it in&s;pired, forms one of the
<PB N="156" REF="031906_0164_0FEF43E9733CA360">
mo&s;t &s;ingular phenomena in the hi&s;tory of the hu|man mind. Many of its &s;anguine advocates were men un&s;u&s;pected of a &s;ini&s;ter de&s;ign.</P>
<P>On the 26th of April, 1796, Mr. Gallatin, in &s;peaking of the Briti&s;h treaty, had the&s;e words:</P>
<P><Q>The fact was uncontroverted, that the Briti&s;h &s;till continued to impre&s;s our &s;eamen and to cap|ture our ve&s;&s;els. If they pretended to ju&s;tify that conduct by the treaty, it became nece&s;&s;ary to obtain an explanation of the doubtful articles; if there was nothing in the treaty to ju&s;tify it, their acts were acts of ho&s;tility; were an infrac|tion of that treaty; and even, according to the doctrine of tho&s;e gentlemen who thought that, in common ca&s;es, the hou&s;e had no di&s;cretion, the treaty once broken by one party, was no lon|ger binding on the other; and it was the right as well as the duty of this hou&s;e, not to proceed to pa&s;s the laws nece&s;&s;ary to carry it into effect, until &s;atisfactory a&s;&s;urances were obtained, that the&s;e acts &s;hould cea&s;e, and until Great Britain had evinced a friendly di&s;po&s;ition towards us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bache's Debates, vol. ii. p. 266.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible to conceive a plainer, or a more &s;ub&s;tantial argument. The&s;e few lines con|tain ju&s;t enough to have convinced an audience of acce&s;&s;ible under&s;tandings, of the propriety of &s;u&s;|pending proceedings toward fulfilling the Briti&s;h treaty, till an effectual check had been given to Briti&s;h piracy. On the 27th of April, Mr. Tracy ro&s;e in an&s;wer to Mr. Gallatin. Two pa&s;&s;ages &s;hall be here given from his &s;peech. The fir&s;t is as fol|lows:</P>

Would they tamely &s;ee their govern|ment &s;trut, attempt to look big, call hard names; and the moment they were faced, like an over-grown lubberly boy, &s;hrink into a corner? Is this, he a&s;ked, the American character? He thought him|&s;elf acquainted with a part of the United States, too well, to believe they merited &s;uch a cha|racter; the people where he was mo&s;t acquain|ted, whatever might be the character in other parts of the union, were not of the &s;tamp to cry Ho&s;annah to day, and crucify to-morrow; they will not dance round a whi&s;ky pole one day, and cur&s;e their government, and, upon <HI>hearing</HI> of a military force, &s;neak into a &s;wamp. No, &s;aid Mr. Tracy, my immediate con&s;tituents, whom I very well know, under&s;tand their rights, and will defend them, and if they find that the govern|ment either cannot, or will not protect them, they will at lea&s;t attempt to protect them&s;elves.

<P>This rhap&s;ody makes up with ill-nature what it wants in meaning. From the fir&s;t part of it, where the gentleman &s;peaks of the injuries committed on this country by England, one would &s;uppo&s;e, that he was going to recommend an immediate exertion of American vengeance. But, &s;o far from that, he only recommended that we &s;hould ki&s;s the Briti&s;h

rod by in&s;tantly appropriating for Jay's treaty. The blu&s;tering &s;ound of his words, and the abject pro&s;tration of his ideas form a &s;triking contra&s;t. His compari&s;on between Connecticut and the we&s;t|ern counties of Penn&s;ylvania is a ma&s;ter-piece of vulgar calumny. That the people of the former &s;tate are as brave as any in the union has never been denied; and the convention of Saratoga will, for ages to come, be remembered and cited as a monu|ment of their courage. But this ought not to be converted into a handle for reproach, and much le&s;s for &s;lander, again&s;t other &s;tates. As to the we&s;tern in&s;urrection, it is time that we &s;hould begin to &s;peak truth about it. The way in which that af|fair was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed did, in it&s;elf, di&s;credit the go|vernment of the country.

<P><Q>On Thur&s;day the 13th of November, there were about forty per&s;ons brought to Parki&s;on's hou&s;e, by order of general White; he directed to put the damned ra&s;cals in the cellar, to tie them back to back, to make a fire for the guard, but to put the pri&s;oners back to the father end of the cellar, and to give them neither victuals nor drink. The cellar was wet and muddy, and the night cold; the cellar extended the whole length, un|der a log-hou&s;e, which was neither floored, nor the openings between the logs daubed. They were kept there until Saturday morning, and then marched to the town of Wa&s;hington. On the march, one of the pri&s;oners, who was &s;ubject to convul&s;ions, fell into a fit: but when &s;ome of the troop told general White of his &s;ituation, he ordered them to tie the damned ra&s;cal to a hor&s;e's tail, and drag him along with them, for he had only
<PB N="159" REF="031906_0167_0FEF43B029055F90">
feigned having the fits. Some of his fellow pri|&s;oners, however, who had a hor&s;e, di&s;mounted, and let the poor man ride: he had another fit before he reached Wa&s;hington. This march was about twelve miles. The poor man, who had the fits, had been in the American &s;ervice, during almo&s;t the whole of the war with Great Britain.</Q></P>
<P>General White has not denied this accu&s;ation, nor pro&s;ecuted the hi&s;torian who records it. Hence we mu&s;t admit the &s;tatement to be true; and New Jer&s;ey may congratulate her&s;elf on the acqui&s;ition or production of a &s;econd DUKE OF CUMBERLAND. Mr. Findley gives &s;ome farther traits of this fede|ral hero. <Q>Stockdale was forbid, on the peril of of his life, to admini&s;ter any comfort to his neigh|bours, though they were peri&s;hing with cold, and fami&s;hing with hunger. The general treated the pri&s;oners, as they arrived, with the mo&s;t in&s;ulting and abu&s;ive language, cau&s;ing them all to be tied back to back, except one man, who held a re|&s;pectable rank, and who, however, was &s;aid to be one of the mo&s;t guilty in his cu&s;tody. One of the neare&s;t neighbours, who had a child at the point of dying, and ob&s;erving that they were bringing in the whole neighbourhood pri&s;oners, without regard to guilt or innocence, went and gave him|&s;elf up to general White, expecting that, as he was con&s;cious there was no charge again&s;t him, he would be permitted to return to his family on gi|ving bail, but he al&s;o was inhumanly thrown into the cellar, tied with the re&s;t, and re|fu&s;ed the privilege of &s;eeing his dying child; nor was he permitted to attend its funeral, until after many entreaties he obtained that liberty, accom|panied with the mo&s;t horrid oaths and impre|cations.</Q> Of the &s;mall honour acquired in
<PB N="160" REF="031906_0168_0FEF449A66C366A0">
this expedition, a great part falls to the &s;nare of captain John Dunlap, of this city. <Q>Captain Dunlap and his party, while they behaved with the greate&s;t dexterity in taking the pri&s;oners, trea|ted them with as much politene&s;s and attention as their &s;ituation would admit of, and engaged their gratitude by accompanying unavoidable &s;everity with humanity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Findley's Hi&s;tory of the In&s;urrection, p. 202.</NOTE>.</Q> At Carli&s;le, a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t of our ar|my, after a hearty dinner, were on the point of &s;et|ting fire to the town, and of charging each other with the bayonet. Mr. Tracy is left to judge whether &s;uch conduct was not as bad as that of dancing round a whi&s;ky pole. But when the member attempts to &s;tigmatize the whole con&s;tituents of Mr. Gallatin, as rebels and poltroons, it is hard to find, within the compa&s;s of decency, a term &s;uitable to his behaviour.</P>
<P>Mr. Tracy farther complained of Mr. Gallatin for having &s;aid that <Q>the negociation with Great Britain was begun in <HI>fear,</HI> carried on through <HI>fear,</HI> and the treaty made by the &s;ame motive; when it arrived in this country the Senate &s;anc|tioned it, and the Pre&s;ident placed his &s;ignature to it from <HI>fear&punc;</HI> and now there was an attempt to obtain the &s;anction of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;en|tatives from <HI>fear.</HI> All the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, in an un|qualified manner, the gentleman had applied to this country, in its mo&s;t important tran&s;actions, by its mo&s;t important characters, and to crown all, we were to defeat the treaty, and &s;it down quietly under injuries the mo&s;t irritating, and not attempt a redre&s;s, or to do any thing like going to war. Under impre&s;&s;ions made by &s;uch declarations, he had &s;aid what he had, and he now &s;aid, he wi&s;hed to look in the face of Mr.
<PB N="161" REF="031906_0169_0FEF4380F1772D70">
Gallatin, or Mr. Hei&s;ter, or any other, who da|red &s;ay, the American character was that of cow|ardice. He would &s;ay again and again, it was madne&s;s, or wor&s;e, to &s;uppo&s;e we could defeat this treaty and avoid a war.</Q></P>
<P>What Mr. Gallatin &s;ays about <HI>fear</HI> is perfectly true. Mr. Tracy always takes it for granted, that America had no medium between the acceptance of Mr. Jay's treaty and a Btiti&s;h war. An embargo for four months would have reduced the mother coun|try to our terms, without occa&s;ion for the firing of a pi&s;tol.</P>
<P>Mr. Tracy next denies the reality of Briti&s;h im|pre&s;&s;ments. <Q>He took this opportunity to a&s;k for <HI>the proofs of &s;uch tran&s;actions,</HI> as impre&s;&s;ing our &s;eamen, by the Briti&s;h government. He decla|red he knew of none; and had never heard one in&s;tance of the Briti&s;h government either avowing the right, or practi&s;ing upon it, of impre&s;&s;ment of an American into their &s;ea &s;ervice; many in&s;tan|ces had occurred of complaints to the govern|ment, and all were immediately redre&s;&s;ed; and, although it was become very fa&s;hionable to calumniate the Briti&s;h government, he was impelled, from his own belief and conviction on the &s;ubject, to &s;ay, that no &s;uch in&s;tance had ever taken place or would ever, of the Bri|ti&s;h government, ju&s;tifying the impre&s;&s;ment of natives of the United States, or one who was an acknowledged citizen. Is it not unfair, &s;aid Mr. Tracy, to attribute to the government unautho|rized mi&s;conduct of individuals, far removed from the &s;eat and controul of the government? It was equally unrea&s;onable to &s;ay, that we were not protected by the treaty, and &s;hould not be, when the Briti&s;h government had promi&s;ed to pay for all former depredations made in that way up|on
<PB N="162" REF="031906_0170_0FEF43B200BA91B8">
our commerce, was it not rea&s;onable to &s;up|po&s;e, they would prevent or pay for any &s;uch depre|dation now made? And they certainly would pre|vent all &s;uch, which were not from the confu&s;ion of war rendered inevitable.</Q></P>
<P>As for the <HI>proofs</HI> of impre&s;&s;ment, the gentleman is referred to the depo&s;ition of Cyprian Cook, emit|ted at Norwich in Connecticut. As for his never hearing of <HI>one</HI> in&s;tance, where the Briti&s;h govern|ment avowed the right of impre&s;&s;ing, or practi&s;ed upon it, the inference mu&s;t be, that Mr. Tracy has ears of a particular con&s;truction. Whether Mr. Pitt him&s;elf a&s;&s;erted the right is of no con&s;equence. The Briti&s;h, in the We&s;t-Indies, univer&s;ally avowed and practi&s;ed upon it. Mr. Tracy &s;ays that all com|plaints to government were immediately redre&s;&s;ed. He &s;hould have told us what redre&s;s was obtained in the ca&s;e related by captain Cook. He then mounts upon that favourite topic of the Briti&s;h officers acting without orders. <HI>Compen&s;ation</HI> clo&s;es the cho|rus. We now proceed with the li&s;t of Briti&s;h pira|cies, leaving Mr. Tracy to deny their exi&s;tence, as long as he &s;hall think proper.</P>
<P>A Philadelphia new&s;paper, of the 8th of April, 1796, informs, that the brig Maria Wilman, of Bal|timore, captain Oaks, was taken in Tortola by the Bull Dog &s;loop, and there &s;old at auction. She was from Demarara, bound to Baltimore, with a cargo of &s;ugar and coffee. It farther &s;ays, that, on Monday, the 11th of April, 1796, the brig Charlotte, of Pro|vidence, arrived at Baltimore, in thirteen days from Martinique. Captain Watts, of the &s;chooner Alex|andria, of Alexandria, came pa&s;&s;enger, along with a number of other Americans. Their ve&s;&s;els had been contracted for, and they were <HI>obliged to leave them.</HI> This corroborates the account already given by captain Samuel Green. In &s;ummer, 1793, Gide|on
<PB N="163" REF="031906_0171_0FEF43B4681B5580">
Henfield and John Singletary had been arre&s;ted on board of the Citizen Genet, a French privateer, lying in the Delaware, and Henfield was tried in this city, &s;oon after, for having enli&s;ted in the French &s;ervice. In &s;pite of a bu&s;tle made by govern|ment, he was acquitted. In the eye of rea&s;on, it &s;eems equally culpable to have &s;old privateers to Britain, yet no notice has been taken of that practice.</P>
<P>A paragraph from Frederic&s;burg, dated April 1&s;t, 1796, &s;ays, that, la&s;t week, arrived in the river, the &s;chooner William, captain John Scott, from Ba&s;&s;a|terre, St. Kitts. He &s;aid that on the 23d of Febru|ary, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, in Ba&s;&s;aterre road, he was boarded by a boat with five men with cutla&s;&s;es. They belonged to a Briti&s;h armed &s;loop lying there. They ordered William M'Coy, a native of Frederic&s;burg, into the boat; but, being prevented from taking him, they went back to the &s;loop. Immediately after, they returned with their commander, one Williams, and an addi|tional number of men, armed with pi&s;tols and cut|la&s;&s;es. They took away from the &s;chooner, John Mansfield, William M'Coy, and two blacks. Next morning, captain Scott went on &s;hore, and proved the&s;e people to be citizens of the United States. He could recover only the two blacks. Every Ameri|can at the port &s;hared a &s;imilar fate. A Baltimore &s;chooner was &s;tript of all her hands, excepting the mate and a boy.</P>
<P>A practice had for &s;ometime prevailed at Norfolk, in Virginia, of &s;ending hor&s;es to the Briti&s;h We&s;t-Indies to mount their cavalry. This, if not a breach of neutrality, was at be&s;t a plain enough indication to France that we preferred the mo&s;t petty &s;elf-intere&s;t to any &s;ucce&s;s on her &s;ide. A King&s;ton new&s;pa|paper, of the 23d of February, 1796, has the fol|lowing article. <Q>Captain Huntington reports, that,
<PB N="164" REF="031906_0172_0FEF43B8FA945298">
when he left America, admiral Murray, with his &s;quadron, was lying in Hampton road, waiting to convoy the hor&s;es that were purcha&s;ed for <HI>the dragoons in St. Domingo.</HI></Q> Two articles, dated Philadelphia, April 12th, &s;ay, that three of the&s;e ve&s;|&s;els, with their freights of hor&s;es, were taken by the French, and &s;ent into Cape Francois. This is the only capture by the French of American &s;hipping that has yet occurred in compiling the la&s;t or the pre&s;ent chapter.</P>
<P>The Federal Gazette of Baltimore, of the 15th of April, 1796, contains a letter from Tortola. The writer mentions the irregular proceedings of the Briti&s;h court of admiralty in that i&s;land, re&s;pec|ting American captures. The captains of the &s;hips of war were permitted to detain the ma&s;ters and &s;u|percargoes of the prizes as pri&s;oners on board of their ve&s;&s;els, till they were deprived of opportunities for employing proper coun&s;el. Enormous co&s;ts were granted, of which the bench received a &s;hare. Some particular circum&s;tances of inju&s;tice are mentioned in the ca&s;e of the Maria Wilman, captain Oaks, who, in the &s;ame new&s;paper, is noticed as having, at this time, arrived &s;afe with his ve&s;&s;el at Baltimore. It is likely that he wrote this very letter; but perhaps nei|ther he nor his owners dur&s;t avow it, for fear of of|fending the Briti&s;h party. In an <HI>independent</HI> coun|try, this dread may &s;eem &s;trange, yet nothing is more notoriou&s;ly true, than that &s;uch influence is extreme|ly active and formidable. Every mercantile man, and every new&s;printer, who dares to &s;peak, with energy, of the in&s;olence and rapine of the Queen of I&s;les, runs imminent hazard of per&s;ecution. The Briti&s;h tories, in our &s;eaport towns, &s;econded by the American intere&s;t, will &s;pare no toil or ex|pence to make him in&s;olvent and infamous.

<P>Jacobin men and jacobin mea&s;ures are all hol|low and rotten. An in&s;tructive in&s;tance has ju&s;t occurred. The bank of Penn&s;ylvania was e&s;tab|li&s;hed in oppo&s;ition to the bank of the United States. A jacobin pre&s;ident, &s;ecretary, and a ma|jority of jacobin directors were appointed. The i&s;&s;ue has di&s;clo&s;ed a &s;cene of jacobin villainy. It turns out, that the pre&s;ident, &s;ecretary, and the notable John Swanwick, have fraudently, and by collu&s;ion, drawn out of the bank one hundred and &s;eventy thou&s;and dollars more than they had a right to. John Swanwick, the famous French American democrat, whom the good democrats in Philadelphia have lately made a member of Congre&s;s, in oppo&s;ition to the prudent and hone&s;t part of the city, now appears in his true colour, an unprincipled &s;windler. Such is the authentic intelligence ju&s;t received from Philadelphia. And yet a large body of citizens, many good but delu|ded ones, are &s;training every nerve to place once more in Congre&s;s the ari&s;tocratic, democratical, jacobinical, Edward Living&s;ton.

<P>Recurring again to the ca&s;e of the Baltimore brig, it may well be &s;uppo&s;ed, that captain Oaks was afraid of provoking &s;uch a &s;warm of &s;corpions. For the &s;ame obvious and weighty rea&s;on many nar|ratives of Briti&s;h piracy have been &s;ecreted, by the &s;ufferers, from the public prints. Of the fifty-five &s;hips taken by the Argonaut, perhaps no regular account of the capture of &s;ix has appeared in any new&s;paper.</P>
<P>The Maryland Journal, of the 2d of May, 1796, gives the following account as from captain Wade of the &s;chooner Polly, from Jamacia. He &s;ays, that from the 20th of February to the 1&s;t of April, thir|teen American prizes had been &s;ent into King&s;ton. Three of the&s;e were &s;chooners, belonging to Oliver and Thom&s;on, of Baltimore. Another was a new copper-bottomed &s;hip from Baltimore to Calcutta.</P>
<P>On the 3d of May, the &s;chooner Edward and William, captain Levin Jones, arrived at Baltimore, in nineteen days from Port-au-Paix. In the pa&s;&s;age, &s;he met with a brig from Port-au-Prince bound for New-London. The people told captain Jones, that five of them had been impre&s;&s;ed by a Briti&s;h frigate. On the 28th of April, they were cha&s;ed by another, but night coming on they got out of her way.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame day, the Ariel, captain Fi&s;her, ar|rived at Baltimore from Jacquemel. He had &s;poke to the &s;chooner Elizabeth, of Philadelphia, from Ja|maica. The captain gave him an account of <HI>twen|ty-&s;even</HI> American ve&s;&s;els carried into that i&s;land

<P>On the 17th of April, the brig Si&s;ters, captain Brent, arrived in Hampton roads from Guern&s;ey. She had, on the 12th of March, been boarded by the Thetis, a Bermudian cor&s;air.

<HI>By an arrival, on Saturday, of a ve&s;&s;el from Curracoa, we received the following prote&s;t of Hugh Wil&s;on, ma&s;ter of American brig called the Jay, belonging to Baltimore; who being duly &s;worn before the notary royal and public of St. Bartholomew, declareth:</HI>&mdash;</OPENER>
<P>That, having got his ve&s;&s;el captured and condemned, as hereafter will appear, and having had his log-book and all the papers belonging to the ve&s;&s;el and to him&s;elf taken from him, all to the &s;hipping articles and a &s;mall memorandum book of his private di&s;bur&s;ements, he is obli|ged to give his declaration from memory, and to the be&s;t of his recollection, viz. that, on the 10th of April la&s;t, 1795, he &s;ailed in &s;aid brig from St. Pierre, in the i&s;land of Mar|tinique, bound to Antigua: that, on the 12th of &s;aid month, in the morning, he was boarded by the French armed &s;choo|ner called, (as near as he could recollect) the Alhenienne, commanded by one Pa&s;cal from Guadaulope, under the lee of which i&s;land the brig then was, and in the evening was carried into Ba&s;&s;aterre road, in &s;aid la&s;t i&s;land. That the &s;ame deponent and all his crew were immediately put on board a French &s;loop of war, where they were detained about eight or ten days, without knowing what was the intention of the French to do with the &s;aid brig, and without ever having been heard or examined. That the deponent and the &s;upercargo, Mr. John Starck, were &s;ent on &s;hore and conducted to the interpreter or lingui&s;ter, who told them the brig Jay and her remaining cargo, con&s;i&s;ting in corn and &s;taves, had already been con|demned, and who furni&s;hed Mr. Starck with a copy of the
<PB N="169" REF="031906_0177_0FEF43C0E7A77958">
condemnation. That Mr. Starck was put at liberty; but the deponent was, the next day, thrown into Ba&s;&s;aterre goal, where he remained about ten days, after which he was drove out of the &s;aid goal and put in chains, on board a &s;mall French &s;chooner bound to Point-a-Petre, the deponent lying all the pa&s;&s;age (about &s;ixty hours), with eight pri&s;oners more chained to the &s;ame bar, in the hold of &s;aid &s;chooner, upon the &s;tone bal|la&s;t, with a very &s;canty and indifferent food. That, having arrived in &s;uch a &s;ituation at Point-a-Petre, the deponent was immediately put on board one of the pri&s;on&s;hips in the harbour, where he was detained for near eight months, that is to &s;ay, until the 1&s;t in&s;tant, (January 1796) when captain Whee|ler, of the brig Peggy, of New-York, having obtained per|mi&s;&s;ion to pick out American &s;ailors, that might be found on board of the different pri&s;on &s;hips, came along &s;ide the &s;hip, where the deponent was detained. That having made his ca&s;e known to him, he the &s;aid captain Wheeler took the de|ponent along with him, and put him on board the &s;aid brig Peggy. That on the 11th in&s;t. or thereabout, the depon|ent went in &s;aid brig from Point-a-Petre, and arrived in this harbour of Gu&s;tavia ye&s;terday, the 13th in&s;t. without yet knowing what has become of his ve&s;&s;el, the brig Jay, her cargo, or any thing belonging to her, and without ever hav|ing been heard, either in behalf of &s;aid property or of him&s;elf, during all the time of near nine months, he was detained in Guadaloupe, plundered of every thing belonging to him, and not left a &s;econd &s;hirt to put on; that, during his detention in Point-a-Petre, captain Lyle of Baltimore, as he pa&s;&s;ed by the &s;aid pri&s;on&s;hip, having &s;een and recollected the deponent, had applied to the commi&s;&s;aire de guerre in his behalf, but in vain, as &s;aid captain Lyle afterwards told the deponent.</P>

<P>A paragraph, dated Norfolk, April 26th, 1796, mentions the arrival of the &s;chooner Eleanor, cap|tain Jack&s;on. He gave an account of the Hu&s;&s;ar, a Briti&s;h frigate, having captured the &s;hip Alexan|der of Yorktown, captain Orr, from Li&s;bon to Nor|folk. The crew were taken on board of the Hu&s;|&s;ar, and the &s;hip her&s;elf was &s;ent to Halifax. The Maryland Journal, of the 2d of May, gives ac|count of the &s;chooner Bet&s;ey of Bo&s;ton, captain Philips. She was taken by the Briti&s;h, but re-cap|tured by the crew, who delivered up the Briti&s;h as pri&s;oners to the French, at Jacquemel. The &s;ame new&s;paper tells of the &s;eizure of the &s;hip Alexander, of Baltimore, by the Briti&s;h. She was bound from Demarara for Baltimore. The captors &s;ent her in|to Grenada, where the cargo was libelled. Here is al&s;o a &s;tatement from captain Wade of the &s;choo|ner Polly, of thirteen &s;ail of Americans which had been &s;ent into King&s;ton, Jamaica, between the 20th of February, and the 1&s;t of April, 1796. One of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els was bound from Baltimore to Calcutta.</P>
<P>It &s;eems amazing that, in the face of &s;uch injuries, any member of Congre&s;s could recommend appro|priations for the Briti&s;h treaty. Public curio&s;ity has been excited by the concealment of Mr. Jay's in&s;tructions. Acce&s;s has been obtained to this paper, and leave has been given to make an ab&s;tract of every material part of it. This, though not in form, yet in &s;ub&s;tance, will an&s;wer the end in view.</P>
<P>Some notice has already been taken of the &s;ingu|lar conduct of the executive in refu&s;ing to treat
<PB N="171" REF="031906_0179_0FEF44A22C36D130">
with Genet becau&s;e the Senate were not then &s;it|ting, and thereafter, while they actually were in &s;e&s;&s;ion, of his re&s;olving to enter into a Briti&s;h nego|ciation, and nominating Mr. Jay as envoy, with|out giving the Senate previous intimation of &s;uch a de&s;ign. The me&s;&s;age does not a&s;k either advice or con&s;ent, but abruptly declares that <HI>he has thought proper.</HI> This is not the con&s;titutional &s;tyle of a&s;k|ing advice, or con&s;ent. The departure from the &s;pirit of the con&s;titution is obvious.</P>
<P>The me&s;&s;age was received by the Senate on the 16th of April, 1794. On the 17th, a motion was made in the following words: <Q>that previous to going into the con&s;ideration of the nomination of a &s;pecial envoy to the court of Great Britain, the Pre&s;ident of the United States be requ&s;ted to in|form the Senate of <HI>the whole bu&s;ine&s;s with which the propo&s;ed envoy is to be charged.</HI></Q> This mo|tion was negatived. Thus the <HI>advice</HI> and <HI>con&s;ent</HI> of the Senate, as required by the con&s;titution, were overlooked. Without con&s;ulting them, the Pre&s;ident re&s;olved to enter into a negociation, and named an en|voy. When he &s;ent down the me&s;&s;age to the Senate as to his having done &s;o, he did not let them know what the negociation was to be about. If the words <HI>advice</HI> and <HI>con&s;ent</HI> mean any thing, it mu&s;t &s;urely be that the Senate are to be previou&s;ly acquainted with and con&s;ulted upon the bu&s;ine&s;s that an amba&s;&s;ador is going to undertake. There can be no other ra|tional explanation of the phra&s;e. The Senate could not pretend to give their advice about the expe|diency of commencing a treaty, when they did not know the terms on which it was to begin. Yet &s;uch is the &s;pirit in a majority of that body that they refu&s;ed, as appears above, to reque&s;t a com|munication from the Pre&s;ident upon this pohnt. They had a title to have <HI>demanded</HI> &s;uch an ecclair|ci&s;ement. In private life, it would be mockery to
<PB N="172" REF="031906_0180_0FEF43C6CE9F6880">
a&s;k a man to con&s;ent to any bu&s;ine&s;s, without fir&s;t telling him the &s;cope of it. Without &s;uch know|ledge it is impo&s;&s;ible that he can give any thing de|&s;erving the name either of <HI>advice</HI> or <HI>con&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>On the 19th of April a motion was made in the Senate of which the following is part. <Q>That to permit judges of the Supreme Court to hold, at the &s;ame time, any other office or employment emanating from, and holden at the plea&s;ure of the Executive, is contrary to the &s;pirit of the con|&s;titution, and, as tending to expo&s;e them to the influence of the Executive, is <HI>mi&s;chievous</HI> and <HI>im|politic.</HI></Q> This motion pa&s;&s;ed in the negative, ten to &s;eventeen. On the 27th of November, 1794, Dr. William Smith objected in Congre&s;s to the de|mocratic &s;ociety of this city, the holding of &s;uch a doctrine. But its being &s;upported by &s;o large a part of the Senate ought at lea&s;t to have &s;oftened the &s;everity of his cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>We now come to the in&s;tructions of our envoy. Of the&s;e an entire copy cannot, as above &s;tated, be obtained; but permi&s;&s;ion has been procured to make a copious ab&s;tract. They &s;et out with directing Mr. Jay to obtain redre&s;s for the piracies committed on our commerce by authority of in&s;tructions from the king and council. He is next enjoined to draw to a conclu&s;ion all points of difference concerning the peace of 1783. The Executive then expre&s;&s;es a wi&s;h, that <Q>the debts, the intere&s;t claimed upon them, and all things relating to them, be put out|right in a diplomatic di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, as being certainly of a judicial nature to be decided by our courts.</Q> If this point could not be obtained, he was to &s;up|port the doctrines of government, <Q>with argu|ments proper for the occa&s;ion, and with that at|tention to his former public opinions, which &s;elf-re&s;pect will ju&s;tify.</Q> This phra&s;e, as to former
<PB N="173" REF="031906_0181_0FEF3218D61B06F0">
public opinions, does not &s;eem very happy. Mr. Jay, as a judge, had declared, from the bench that the Engli&s;h were ju&s;tified in detaining the we&s;tern po&s;ts, on account of the debts due to Britain. Hence, attention to his former opinions, would lead him to vindicate the latter, at the expence of America.</P>
<P>The in&s;tructions proceed to &s;ay, that, <Q>the Bri|ti&s;h government, having denied their abetting the Indians, we mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, acquit them. But we have &s;atisfactory proofs, &s;ome of which, howe|ver, cannot, as you will di&s;cover, be well u&s;ed in public, that Briti&s;h agents are guilty of &s;tir|ring up, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting, with arms, ammunition, and warlike implements, the different tribes of Indians again&s;t us.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is incumbent upon that government to re|&s;train the&s;e agents, as a forbearance to re&s;train them, cannot be interpreted otherwi&s;e than as a determination to countenance them.</Q> Mr. Jay was farther directed to in&s;i&s;t, <Q>that the Indians dwelling in the territories of one, &s;hall not be in|terfered with by the other.</Q> He was likewi&s;e en|joined, <Q>to explain the pacific wi&s;hes of America, in ca&s;e that he &s;hould find the court of London equally di&s;po&s;ed for amity.</Q> Mr. Jay was, be|&s;ides, in&s;tructed to mention the dangerous effect that might be produced upon the minds of the citizens of America, by the continuation of outrages in the We&s;t-Indies, while, at the &s;ame time, our courts gave entire authority to claims for Briti&s;h debts. Mr. Jay was, in particular, enjoined to con&s;ider <Q>the inexecution and infraction of the treaty, as &s;tanding on di&s;tinct grounds from the vexations and &s;polia|tions; &s;o that no adju&s;tment of the former, is to be influenced by the latter.</Q> Mr. Jay was, in the next place, in&s;tructed, if he &s;hould be able to obtain &s;a|tisfaction,

as to the tre&s;pa&s;&s;es on the treaty of 1783, and as to the We&s;t-Indian piracies, to &s;ound the Briti&s;h mini&s;try on the &s;ubject of a commercial treaty. If he found this &s;ubject eligible, he was e&s;|pecially directed to in&s;i&s;t upon the following points.</P>
<Q><P N="1">1. Reciprocity in navigation, and particularly to the We&s;t-Indies, and even to the Ea&s;t-Indies.</P>

By defining a blockade, if contraband, mu&s;t continue, in &s;ome degree, as it is defined in the armed neutrality. By re&s;tric|ting the opportunities of vexation, in vi&s;iting ve&s;|&s;els, and bringing under &s;tricter management privateers, and expediting recoveries again&s;t them for mi&s;conduct.</P>

<P>The above enumeration pre&s;ented, in a general point of view, the objects which our Executive con|&s;idered as de&s;irable to be comprehended in a com|mercial treaty. But Mr. Jay was e&s;pecially caution|ed not to expect that a treaty could be po&s;itively ef|fected with &s;o great a variety of advantages in fa|vour
<PB N="176" REF="031906_0184_0FEF43C9C4090520">
of America. Here it is difficult to &s;uppre&s;s the feelings of &s;urpri&s;e, at &s;o very injudicious a choice of the time for making a commercial treaty with Britain. Something has been &s;aid upon that &s;ubject already, and to which the reader is referred.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth chapter of an act of Parliament, pa&s;t in the 28th year of the reign of George the third, mentions certain articles which may be carried from the United States to the Briti&s;h We&s;t-Indies, in <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> bottoms; and certain others which may be conveyed from the Briti&s;h We&s;t-Indies to the United States in <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> bottoms. Mr. Jay was en|joined, if practicable, to obtain the &s;ame privilege, in both ca&s;es, for <HI>American</HI> bottoms. But &s;uch trea|ty, in&s;tead of the u&s;ual clau&s;e of ratification, was to contain the following. <Q>This treaty &s;hall be ob|ligatory and conclu&s;ive, when the &s;ame &s;hall be ratified by his Britannic maje&s;ty of the one part, and by the Pre&s;ident of the United States, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate, of the other.</Q></P>
<P>But if a treaty of commerce could not be form|ed upon a ba&s;is as advantageous as that above &s;ta|ted, Mr. Jay was prohibited from <HI>concluding or &s;igning any &s;uch;</HI> <Q>it being conceived that it would not be expedient to do any thing more than to dige&s;t with the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, the articles of &s;uch a treaty, as they appeared willing to accede to, <HI>referring them here for con&s;ideration and fur|ther in&s;truction,</HI> previous to a formal conclu&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>From this part of Mr. Jay's in&s;tructions, the plain inference &s;eems to be, that he was not at liberty to &s;ign any treaty at all, till it had been previou&s;ly re|mitted to this country for examination. Indeed it was plainly enough admitted, in the Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives, that our envoy had exceeded his powers.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="031906_0185_0FEF43FD0B9C4E28">After this injunction, the in&s;tructions to Mr. Jay proceed immediately in the following words. <Q>Some of the other points which it would be in|tere&s;ting to comprehend in a treaty, may not be attended with difficulty. Among the&s;e, is the admi&s;&s;ion of our commodities and manufactures generally, in the Briti&s;h European dominions, upon a footing equally good with tho&s;e of other foreign countries. At pre&s;ent, certain enumera|ted articles only are admitted, and though the enumeration embraces all the articles which it is of pre&s;ent con&s;equence to us to be able to export to tho&s;e dominions, yet, in proce&s;s of time, an ex|ten&s;ion of the objects may become of moment. The fixing of the privileges which we now enjoy, in the Briti&s;h Ea&s;t Indies, by toleration of the company's government, if any arrangement can be made with the con&s;ent of the company for that purpo&s;e, would al&s;o be a valuable ingredient.</Q></P>
<P>As Denmark and Sweden were upon very indif|ferent terms with the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, and as Ru&s;&s;ia, the nominal ally of England, had, in the American war, appeared at the head of the famous armed neu|trality, it was to be expected, that &s;ome co-operation from that quarter would greatly tend to enforce the &s;ucce&s;s of Mr. Jay's errand. Accordingly, &s;ome ideas on this &s;ubject &s;eem to have occurred to our American cabinet. But the timid and indeci&s;ive &s;tyle in which the in&s;tructions, as to that point, are couched, &s;hews how little could be re&s;ted upon them. Our envoy was cautioned as to entering into &s;uch a negociation, if there was a danger of its being di&s;covered by the Briti&s;h court. Now this notion of our Executive runs expre&s;sly counter to the common experience of mankind. For, the very dread of Jay maturing &s;uch a treaty, would have been the mo&s;t likely way to bring Grenville to favourable terms. Nothing
<PB N="178" REF="031906_0186_0FEF43848BC21608">
was to be depended upon from that quarter, but through the operation of intere&s;t or fear; and the &s;horte&s;t way to make this impre&s;&s;ion, was, by affec|ting a corre&s;pondence with the Dani&s;h and Swedi&s;h mini&s;ters, even though America had previou&s;ly de|termined to decline &s;uch a conjunction. The for|mer armed neutrality had &s;truck England with un|u&s;ual alarm, and the very dread of a &s;econd com|bination of that &s;ort would have chilled the warme&s;t drop of blood in the veins of the Engli&s;h nation. In private life, when you want to cheapen a piece of goods, the fir&s;t argument is, that you can go to the next &s;tore. But Jay was expre&s;sly directed to con|ceal any de&s;ign of &s;uch a nature. To give our Exe|cutive full ju&s;tice, the whole pa&s;&s;age, as it imme|diately follows the la&s;t quotation, is here in&s;erted <HI>verbatim.</HI></P>
<P><Q>You will have no difficulty in gaining acce&s;s to the Mini&s;ters of Ru&s;&s;ia, Denmark, and Sweden, at the court of London. The principles of the armed neutrality would abundantly cover our neutral rights. If, therefore, the &s;ituation of things with re&s;pect to Great Britain &s;hould dictate the nece&s;&s;ity of taking the precaution of foreign co|operation on this head; <HI>if no pro&s;pect of accommoda|tion &s;hould be thwarted by the danger of &s;uch a mea|&s;ure being known to the Briti&s;h court;</HI> and if an en|tire view of all our political relations, &s;hall, in your judgment, permit the &s;tep; you will &s;ound tho&s;e mini&s;ters upon the probability of an alliance with their nations to &s;upport tho&s;e principles. Howe|ver, there can be no ri&s;k in examining what can be concerted with Denmark and Sweden, or any other power, again&s;t the Algerines. It may be re|pre&s;ented to the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, how productive of perfect conciliation it might be to the people of the United States, if Great Britain would u&s;e her
<PB N="179" REF="031906_0187_0FEF4400A92416D8">
influence with the Dey of Algiers for the libera|tion of the American citizens in captivity, and for a peace upon rea&s;onable terms. It has been <HI>com|municated from abroad,</HI> to be the fixed policy of Great Britain to check our trade in grain to the Mediterranean. This is too doubtful to be a&s;&s;u|mcd, but fit for enquiry.</Q></P>
<P>As to the re&s;triction in corre&s;ponding with the mini&s;ters of Sweden and Denmark, with regard to an armed neutrality, the reader can compare the text with the commentary, and decide whether a mini&s;ter like Jay, who had ju&s;tified the Briti&s;h in detaining the we&s;tern po&s;ts, was likely to negoci|ate with the northern powers, under &s;uch equivocal and tremulous injunctions.</P>
<P>Another part of the above paragraph, refers to getting the Briti&s;h mini&s;try to obtain the liberation of American pri&s;oners in Algiers. Our mini&s;ter was to tell how productive this &s;tep would be of <HI>perfect conciliation.</HI> If the Briti&s;h had de&s;ired the latter, American &s;ailors would never have been carried as &s;laves into Barbary. It was publicly un|der&s;tood in both countries, that the court of London, by patching up the Portugue&s;e truce, were the real authors of the Algerine piracies. <HI>No&s;tro quoque &s;eculo mon&s;trum.</HI> To &s;uch atrocious, &s;uch abandon|ed political bloodhounds, who&s;e guilt rivals the darke&s;t precedent in the records of perdition, the application of this trimming, fawning &s;tyle, was per|fectly u&s;ele&s;s. It was like telling a highwayman how greatly you would thank him for returning your pur&s;e. Jay, if in earne&s;t, ought to have a&s;&s;umed a different tone. <Q>You are not only, he might have &s;aid, cor&s;airs in per&s;on, but cor&s;airs by proxy. You have not only accumulated upon our commerce every wrong that Briti&s;h bucanneers were capable of inflicting, but with a meanne&s;s and ba&s;ene&s;s which
<PB N="180" REF="031906_0188_0FEF44A781CFEDA0">
no language can de&s;cribe, you have &s;ummoned to your aid the dregs of the human race. Till you make reparation, common &s;en&s;e loudly exclaims that no treaty between us can repay the trouble of &s;ub&s;cription.</Q></P>
<P>The la&s;t &s;entence of the above extract from Jay's in&s;tructions, &s;peaks of &s;omething as a &s;ecret, which was in reality known to the whole world. England adhered to the policy of checking, not merely <HI>Ame|rican trade in grain to the Mediterranean,</HI> but Ame|rican trade in every commodity to every quarter of the world. Lord Sheffield had even wrote a book, extremely popular in England, wherein he recom|mended that protection from <Q>the powers of Bar|bary</Q> &s;hould not be granted by England to Ame|rican commerce. This was, in other words, recom|mending that the&s;e robbers &s;hould be turned loo&s;e upon us, at the fir&s;t opportunity. When Jay went to England, Lord Sheffield, the apo&s;tle of this pro|ject, was high in the confidence of Mr. Pitt, &s;o that the conduct of the latter was merely an illu&s;tration of the principles of the former. Yet our Executive &s;peaks, in the in&s;tructions, as if this news had been conveyed by &s;ome &s;ecret channel, though the doc|trine and practice of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try were alike notorious. Nay, Mr. Tench Coxe had wrote an an&s;wer to Sheffield, and in particular to this Al|gerine plan, &s;everal years before Mr. Jay went to England. Thus our Executive might have found full evidence as to <HI>the fixed policy of Britain,</HI> in the &s;tore of every book&s;eller in Philadelphia. The next part of the in&s;tructions is in the&s;e words.</P>
<Q><P>Such are the outlines of the conduct which the Pre&s;ident wi&s;hes you to pur&s;ue. He is aware that at this di&s;tance, and during the pre&s;ent in&s;tabi|lity of public events, he cannot undertake to pre|&s;cribe rules which &s;hall be irrevocable; you will,
<PB N="181" REF="031906_0189_0FEF440270FFDE78">
therefore, con&s;ider the ideas herein expre&s;&s;ed, as amounting to <HI>recommendations only,</HI> which, in your di&s;cretion you may modify, as &s;eems mo&s;t benefi|cial to the United States, except in the following ca&s;es, which are <HI>immutable.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That, as the Briti&s;h mini&s;try will doubtle&s;s be &s;olicitous to detach us from France, and may, probably, make &s;ome overtures of this kind; you will inform them that the government of the Uni|ted States will not derogate from our treaties and engagements with France, and that experience has &s;hewn that we can be hone&s;t in our duties to the Briti&s;h nation, without laying our&s;elves under any particular re&s;traints as to other nations; and,</P>
<P N="2">2. That no treaty of commerce be concluded, <HI>contrary to the foregoing prohibition.</HI></P></Q>
<P>This extract concludes the in&s;tructions. A &s;hort analy&s;is will evince that they are not remarka|ble for per&s;picuity. We &s;hall begin at their out&s;et, and attempt a &s;hort &s;ketch of their merits.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t object &s;tated in the in&s;tructions is, to ob|tain redre&s;s for the piracies, or, as the paper terms it, <Q>for the <HI>vexations</HI> and <HI>&s;poliations</HI> com|mitted on our commerce.</Q> The mo&s;t atroci|ous of the&s;e vexations was the impre&s;&s;ment of American &s;eamen; yet, in the whole text of the in|&s;tructions, of which about five-&s;ixths have been ex|actly cited, nothing di&s;tinct or deci&s;ive is &s;aid on that point. We have in&s;erted above, an entire copy of the whole nineteen articles upon which Mr. Jay was authori&s;ed to found a commercial treaty. In the&s;e, nothing levels at the practice of impre&s;&s;|ment, unle&s;s it can be implicated under the general phra&s;e, "as to the &s;afety of neutral commerce," and <Q><HI>re&s;tricting</HI> the opportunities of vexations in vi&s;iting ve&s;&s;els.</Q> Re&s;triction is one thing, and prohibition is another; &s;o that even if impre&s;&s;ment
<PB N="182" REF="031906_0190_0FEF442142A34EE8">
had been really implied, the language was too vague and equivocal for the object. The treaty, as it now &s;tands, contains not one &s;ingle word about the pro|tection of American &s;eamen. After Grenville and Jay had almo&s;t fini&s;hed the articles of this paper, Jay &s;ent a note to the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, containing eighteen corrections, or additions, that had occur|red to him. Only one of them, viz. the &s;ixteenth, de&s;erves publication here. It is in the&s;e words.</P>
<P><Q>An article ought to be added, to prevent the impre&s;&s;ment of each other's people.</Q></P>
<P>To this clau&s;e, the an&s;wer was thus.</P>
<P><Q>Lord Grenville can &s;ee no rea&s;on whatever, why &s;uch an article &s;hould not be added.</Q> No farther notice was taken by Mr. Jay of the bu&s;ine&s;s. As to the authenticity of this &s;ingular corre&s;pondence, it has been fir&s;t had from a member of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of la&s;t Congre&s;s, who read it when lying on the table of the Senate, and the &s;ub&s;tance of it was publi&s;hed, la&s;t fall, in <HI>Briti&s;h Ho|nour and Humanity.</HI> It was &s;ince repeated to the author by a member of the Senate. As for the merit of our envoy, in this ca&s;e, a thou&s;and volumes of diplomatic hi&s;tory would not furni&s;h &s;uch another in&s;tance of negligence in the duty of office.</P>
<P>The in&s;tructions next ob&s;erve, that the debts due to England are to be <Q>put <HI>outright</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In pa&s;&s;ing, one cannot fail to admire the cla&s;&s;ical &s;tyle of our cabinet.</NOTE> in a diploma|tic di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, as being certainly of a judicial na|ture to be <HI>decided by our courts.</HI></Q> In&s;tead of this Mr. Jay erected an arbitrary board of five commi&s;|&s;ioners. Thus American debtors were, with one da&s;h of his pen, deprived of the right of a trial by jury. The Pre&s;ident and Senate ratified this breach of ju&s;tice and of law.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="031906_0191_0FEF43CC52A29D58">The in&s;tructions likewi&s;e &s;ay, that <Q>the Briti&s;h government, having denied the abetting of the Indians, <HI>we mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, acquit them.</HI></Q> On the &s;ame principle, an American debtor, denying his debt before the five commi&s;&s;ioners, they <HI>mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, acquit him.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Jay was al&s;o to con&s;ider, <Q>the inexecution and infraction of the treaty, as &s;tanding on di&s;tinct grounds from the vexations and &s;po|liations; &s;o that no adju&s;tment of the former, is to be <HI>influenced by the latter.</HI></Q> The ge|neral face of the treaty plainly &s;ets off the debts due to Britain, again&s;t the detention of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, and the piracies in the We&s;t-Indies. The public have been &s;ufficiently tired with harping upon Jay's treaty; but the bu&s;ine&s;s of compen&s;ation &s;tands at pre&s;ent as follows. Provi|ding that American merchants recover their dama|ges in a Briti&s;h court of admiralty, they are not to receive immediate payment. The Briti&s;h claims on American debtors are to be held up as a counter-poi&s;e; and, when the balance &s;hall be &s;truck be|tween the two cla&s;&s;es of claims, the Briti&s;h expect and &s;ay, that &s;everal millions of dollars will be found in their favour. This extraordinary mode of compen&s;ation for piracy, was related by a per&s;on high in office in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice, to a Senator of the pre&s;ent Congre&s;s, from whom the account is here given.</P>
<P>We now come to the que&s;tion, <HI>whether Mr. Jay broke his in&s;tructions?</HI> A few literal citations from them will decide this point. On p. 176, there has already been quoted a paragraph beginning thus: <Q>but if a treaty of commerce cannot be formed up|on a ba&s;is as advantageous as this, YOU ARE NOT TO CONCLUDE OR SIGN ANY SUCH, it being con|ceived,</Q> &amp;c. The whole paragraph is &s;omewhat
<PB N="184" REF="031906_0192_0FEF44046B7C7628">
confu&s;ed, but it clearly enjoins a prohibition upon Mr. Jay of &s;igning any treaty, unle&s;s he could ob|tain an agreement to the whole of his own terms, which the Executive, as above, &s;ays, <HI>could not be expected.</HI> Thus we have one &s;tep.</P>
<P>A &s;ub&s;equent pa&s;&s;age already quoted, has the&s;e words: <Q>you will therefore con&s;ider the ideas herein expre&s;&s;ed, as amounting to <HI>recommen|dations only,</HI> which in your di&s;cretion you may modify, as &s;eems mo&s;t beneficial to the Uni|ted States, except in the two following ca&s;es, which are IMMUTABLE.</Q></P>
<P>The two ca&s;es are above in&s;erted. One of them is, <Q>that no treaty of commerce be concluded or &s;igned, contrary to the foregoing prohibition.</Q> The&s;e are the clo&s;ing words of the in&s;tructions; and hence they mu&s;t be regarded as explanatory of what goes before them. The preceding prohi|bition can only allude to that pa&s;&s;age where Mr. Jay is forbidden from &s;igning a treaty, unle&s;s he ob|tained every thing on his own conditions. The intermediate reference to his <HI>di&s;cretion</HI> is in&s;tant|ly checked by the prohibition of &s;igning. The ca&s;e may then be reduced to three points.</P>
<P N="1">1. Mr. Jay was prohibited from &s;igning a treaty unle&s;s <HI>on certain terms,</HI> that were not within the compa&s;s of expectation.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mr. Jay &s;igned a treaty.</P>
<P N="3">3. So far from obtaining the terms required, he agreed to a treaty almo&s;t entirely the rever&s;e of them. For in&s;tance, <HI>Free &s;hips to make free goods</HI> is inverted. The &s;ecurity of emigrant manufac|turers is unnoticed. No admi&s;&s;ion is obtained to Briti&s;h fi&s;hing grounds. In the ca&s;e of an Indian war, we have no re&s;triction of military &s;upplies from Britain to the &s;avages. The free export of arms and military &s;tores is forbidden, in time of
<PB N="185" REF="031906_0193_0FEF44128BA70C28">
war, for the eighteenth article of the treaty declares them contraband. Thus, out of the eighteen in|junctions above quoted, the third, fifth, &s;ixth, ninth, and &s;ixteenth, are either neglected or contradicted; and other infractions, of an inferior nature, may readily be found. But, pa&s;&s;ing by &s;uch trite mate|rials, we proceed at once to the two capital points of <HI>&s;ecurity to American commerce</HI> and of <HI>avoiding all cau&s;e of offence to France.</HI> As to the fir&s;t, the Bri|ti&s;h continue at this day (June 19th, 1797,) to plun|der, though two years and &s;even months have pa&s;t over &s;ince Mr. Jay &s;igned his treaty. With regard to the &s;econd, the French were, from the fir&s;t, highly and rea&s;onably exa&s;perated at the conditions of the treaty, and a war with that republic is like|ly to be the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Thus, in all their material parts, Mr. Jay vio|lated his powers. We a&s;ked for a fi&s;h, and he gave us a &s;erpent. It has been whi&s;pered that a &s;econd &s;et of in&s;tructions were tran&s;mitted to our envoy. They were never laid before the Senate, and it fol|lows, that, if they really exi&s;ted, which is extreme|ly doubtful, the Senate knew nothing about them. They can form no part of our envoy's vindication, unle&s;s he &s;hall chu&s;e to produce them.</P>
<P>The tenth article, as to the inju&s;tice and impolicy of &s;eque&s;trating Briti&s;h debts, was written, as it now &s;tands, by Mr. Jay. This evinces, if evidence were wanting, that the whole affair was an in&s;tru|ment of party.</P>
<P>We have now a&s;certained that Mr. Jay tre&s;pa&s;|&s;ed his orders. The next que&s;tion is, by what mo|tives he could be induced to do &s;o? In this coun|try it has been the cu&s;tom to hold up Americans as a race of &s;uperior beings, and from that theory the re&s;ult is, that, for Grenville to purcha&s;e our federal envoy, was impracticable. But the tenth article of
<PB N="186" REF="031906_0194_0FEF441FA9C80B80">
the treaty, by an expre&s;s implication, arraigns Mr. Dayton and a con&s;iderable party in Congre&s;s, as me|ditating an act of inju&s;tice. Camillus, al&s;o<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Supra, chap. IV.</NOTE>, in all the plenitude of his eloquence, can find <HI>no powers of language</HI> equal to the ba&s;ene&s;s of the Daytonian pro|ject.</P>
<P>From the&s;e e&s;timates of American purity, every man will make what inference he thinks fit, as to the probable &s;ale of our treaty. Speaking of this country, Thomas Paine has indeed told us that <Q>the <HI>innocence of her character,</HI> that won the hearts of all nations in her favour, may, a thou|&s;and years hence, &s;ound like a romance; her <HI>inimitable virtue,</HI> as if it had never been<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Paine to Wa&s;hington, p. 8.</NOTE>.</Q> At the date of only ten years, from writing of the above &s;entence, the tale &s;ounds not like a romance, to be &s;ure, but very like an untruth. It forms a part of that empty blabbing of national vanity, which has been remarked among every race of mankind, from Greenland to Cape Horn. With|out launching into the ocean of the revolutionary virtue of the United States, let us hear what the A&s;&s;embly of Georgia have to &s;ay about its &s;ituation, in 1796. The picture makes an intere&s;ting part of the hi&s;tory of that year.</P>

The deponent at this time, wi&s;hed to make further di&s;covery of the conduct of the members on that &s;ale, and therefore affected to be inclined to come into the mea&s;ure, and, by that means, kept up a conver|&s;ation about it occa&s;ionally; that on the day the bill received its fir&s;t reading, before the hou&s;e convened, &s;aid Long&s;treet &s;poke to the deponent to get his approbation to the &s;ale.

It was happy for America, that, in June, 1795, the terre&s;trial &s;peculations of general Gunn did not prevent his attendance at Philadel|phia as a &s;enator.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>TO commence this chapter, a few additional &s;pecimens of Briti&s;h amity are in&s;erted. A letter from captain Thorndike Deland, dated King|&s;ton, 1&s;t of April, 1796, to a merchant in Phila|delphia, contains, for publication, a li&s;t of twelve American ve&s;&s;els taken and carried into that port. Captain Deland farther &s;ays, that he had heard of
<PB N="190" REF="031906_0198_0FEF440E568A3F98">
twenty-&s;even other &s;hips at Tortola, which were in jeopardy. He informs, that all Americans, when carried into King&s;ton, were, after examina|tion, turned a&s;hore, without provi&s;ion for their &s;upport. Any one having concern in a hou&s;e, or having even a factor at St. Domingo, or any French port, was deemed a Frenchman, and his property was, on that account, condemned. On the 21&s;t of April, 1796, the &s;chooner William and Mary, captain Shaw, arrived at Port&s;mouth, New-Hamp|&s;hire, in thirty-eight days from King&s;ton. When he left that place, the impre&s;&s;ment of American &s;eamen had not &s;ub&s;ided. On the 5th of May, the &s;chooner Mermaid, captain Tabet, arrived from the Mole, at New-York. His mate, a native Ame|rican, was pre&s;&s;ed by the Regulus. Several other Americans were, at the &s;ame time, pre&s;&s;ed from different ve&s;&s;els. The Mermaid had &s;ailed from New-York, with a load of timber, on account of the Briti&s;h government.</P>
<P>The Minerva, of the 13th of April, expre&s;&s;es &s;urpri&s;e, that, if all the accounts of impre&s;&s;ments were true, they had little or no effect in deterring American &s;eamen from entering into the &s;ervice. <Q>In a full public meeting of merchants, in this city, la&s;t week, &s;ays Web&s;ter, the que&s;tion was a&s;ked, whether the Briti&s;h impre&s;&s;ments had operated to di&s;courage &s;eamen from entering in|to &s;ervice? The reply was, that no &s;uch effect had been perceived.&mdash;If &s;eamen do not com|plain, how happens it <HI>[that]</HI> printers take up their cau&s;e <HI>with &s;o much zeal?</HI></Q> Seamen do complain, of which the numerous details in this volume, and which are not, perhaps, a twentieth part of the whole, compo&s;e an ample atte&s;tation. But a common &s;eaman has more difficulty in chang|ing his profe&s;&s;ion, than almo&s;t any other per&s;on.
<PB N="191" REF="031906_0199_0FEF4410016C3648">
This explains the general adherence to it, even in &s;pite of Briti&s;h crimping. Web&s;ter is angry at printers for taking up the cau&s;e of &s;eamen with <HI>&s;o much zeal.</HI> But, if they are not to be defended with ardour, upon what point &s;hould zeal be ex|cited? If circum&s;tances require it, the pre&s;&s;es of America will continue to remon&s;trate again&s;t &s;uch wrongs, when the bones of Web&s;ter &s;hall be as rotten as his heart. As to the query &s;tarted in the mercantile meeting, the members would have gained more cre|dit by &s;ub&s;cribing to form a fund for the relief of &s;uch &s;eamen, or the families of &s;uch &s;eamen, as might be impre&s;&s;ed while in their &s;ervice. This would have been acting like men. It would have been acting like ENGLISHMEN; for, at London or Liverpool, a pro|po&s;al of that kind would, under a &s;imilar &s;ituation, have been adopted. But, in the United States, it &s;eems that, if a merchant can only &s;ave him&s;elf, he is per|fectly indifferent, what becomes of the people in his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>A Charle&s;ton new&s;paper, of the 8th of April, 1796, contains the copy of a &s;entence pa&s;t by judge Green, of Bermuda. It is dated the 6th of Janu|ary preceding, and re&s;pected the brig Fame. In &s;ummer, 1795, the Fame &s;ailed from Charle&s;ton, for Bourdeaux. On her return &s;he was captured, and taken into Bermuda. The ve&s;&s;el and cargo were both American property. But one of the owners, who went along with her, had &s;taid be|hind, in France, to di&s;po&s;e of &s;ome remaining part of her cargo. This accident, in the eyes of Green, transformed him into a French citizen, and, on that pretence, both &s;hip and loading were confi&s;cated. Thus the Briti&s;h went on in the We&s;t-Indies, while Mr. Bayard was tran&s;mitting to Phila|delphia his important a&s;&s;urances about indemnifica|tion, and the re&s;entment of the London Court of Ad|miralty at the decrees of Green.</P>

<P>Previous to the election of a clerk for the Repre&s;entatives, in the pre&s;ent Congre&s;s, (Supra, chap. 3d,) Dr. Smith convened his party without doors, and they agreed in the nomination of a candidate to oppo&s;e Mr. Beckley. Next morning the votes were taken by ballot. The republican members had each to write the name of their candidate; but the friends of <HI>order</HI> pulled theirs ready written out of their pockets. As great part of them could know nothing of Mr. Beckley but by name, this promptitude &s;hews the exactne&s;s of their di&s;cipline, and what prai&s;e is due to the diligence of our legi&s;lative Martinet.</P>
<P>In the Senate, matters proceed &s;till more &s;traightly. For in&s;tance, a few weeks ago, five re&s;olutions were moved in that body, and it was agreed to ballot, next day, for committees upon each of them. The federal majority con&s;i&s;ted of &s;eventeen; and &s;o nicely had matters been a&s;certained without doors, that the five committees, having each three members, were elected exclu&s;ively out of the &s;eventeen. The minority have no &s;hare of influence whatever. They are debarred even from the appearance of it.</P>

<P>About the 23d of April, Captain Mercer, of the &s;loop Ambu&s;cade, arrived in this port from Bermu|da. He brought a li&s;t of eight American ve&s;&s;els with their cargoes which were condemned at that place; and of &s;even others which were libelled. One of the latter was a brig from Bo&s;ton. Captain Mercer had heard that her captain had died of

abu&s;e which he received from the prize-ma&s;ter.

<P>Jo&s;hua Whiting was a &s;eaman on board of the American brig Samuel. At Port-au-Prince, he, and four others of the crew, were pre&s;&s;ed by a Bri|ti&s;h frigate. Three of them, after eleven days, e&s;caped by &s;wimming, in the cour&s;e of which, one man had the calf of his leg bitten off by a &s;hark. Another of them was retaken, received four dozen of la&s;hes, and was put in irons. Whiting, and the cripple, e&s;caped, after lo&s;ing their whole ad|venture, be&s;ides being cruelly treated. In the Bo&s;ton Chronicle, of the 18th of April, Whiting publi&s;hed a narrative, of which the above is the &s;ub&s;tance. In&s;tead of voting money for the treaty, Congre&s;s might as well have voted &s;ome relief of the poor man who lo&s;t the calf of his leg, under that emblem of aba&s;ement, that contempt of na|tions, that nautical DETERSORIUM, the <HI>American flag!</HI></P>
<P>The brig Columbia, and the &s;chooner Unity, both of Newburyport, &s;ailed from Port Lewis, on

the 7th of March, 1796. Next day, they were brought to by the Ganges, a Briti&s;h &s;eventy-four; and a &s;chooner, attendant to the &s;hip. <Q>This &s;chooner, &s;ays the account, is one of <HI>the fif|teen pilot boats built in Virginia,</HI> not long &s;ince, which are all employed as attendants to the Bri|ti&s;h men of war.</Q> They were &s;ent into Mont|&s;errat, examined, and on the 14th, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, upon paying forty-four pounds, four &s;hillings, and ten pence, as the expence of their examination.</P>
<P>The &s;loop Dove, of New-Haven, in Connecti|cut, had gone on a voyage to the We&s;t-Indies. While lying at Antigua, &s;he was boarded by a boat's crew from the Narci&s;&s;us, who took away Benjamin Ea&s;tman. He was a native American, and as &s;uch, had a protection. On the 3d of April, 1796, the ma&s;ter and mate of the Dove made oath to this fact, at New-Haven. James Smith, ma&s;ter of the May Flower, of Norfolk, publi&s;hed a de|claration, dated the 3d of March, 1796. One of his men, an American, was impre&s;&s;ed at Port Je|remie, by the Regulus. Captain Smith, him&s;elf, was kept, for three days, a pri&s;oner, on board of the frigate, and half &s;tarved. He left about thirty or forty American &s;ailors in her. Almo&s;t the whole of them had protections, and he &s;aw &s;ome of them &s;everely puni&s;hed for attempting to e&s;cape. The new&s;papers containing the&s;e mi&s;erable details, are crammed with exulting encomiums on the number of petitioners to Congre&s;s, in favour of the Briti&s;h treaty.</P>

Their &s;eamen were on board of Briti&s;h &s;hips of war, where they were treated like &s;laves. They &s;aid that their

brethren at Algiers were not greater objects of &s;ym|pathy. The&s;e ten captains might as well have ad|dre&s;&s;ed a memorial, on the &s;ame &s;ubject, to any old woman, in any chimney corner on the conti|nent. Congre&s;s have no fleet, and they can hard|ly rai&s;e money to pay the national debt. In this <HI>unparalleled &s;tate of pro&s;perity,</HI> what would you have us to do?</P>
<P>The Aurora of June 2d, 1796, contained a long account of the capture of the Eliza, a ve&s;&s;el, Ame|rican property, by the Briti&s;h. She &s;ailed from New-York, for St. Thomas's, and had orders to touch at St. Bartholomew's. She was taken by captain Cochran, of the Thetis frigate. The &s;uper|cargo, a Dani&s;h &s;ubject, was &s;tript to the &s;kin. The &s;hip was libelled before the Vice-Admiralty Court at Bermuda, under pretence of being French proper|ty. The trunks of the &s;upercargo were &s;ealed up, and he was him&s;elf thrown pennyle&s;s out of the &s;hip, without a &s;econd &s;hirt to his back. The cap|tain and crew were put on &s;hore, de&s;titute of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence. Six or &s;even days after the &s;hip and car|go had been libelled, the cattle were &s;old at half their prime co&s;t, bought in by the agents who &s;old them, and &s;old a &s;econd time, next day, at a con|&s;iderable profit.</P>
<P>A Bo&s;ton new&s;paper, of the 26th of May, con|tains a depo&s;ition, dated at St. George's, the 27th of April, preceding. It was emitted by the &s;econd mate of the brigantine Polly, John Bo&s;&s;on, late ma&s;ter. The ve&s;&s;el was on her way from Dema|rara, to Bo&s;ton, when the Cleopatra, a Briti&s;h pri|vateer, took her. Soon after, the prize-ma&s;ter quarrelled with captain Bo&s;&s;on, and wantonly beat him in a mo&s;t &s;hocking manner. This is the &s;ub|&s;tance of the depo&s;ition. Within &s;ix days after, captain Bo&s;&s;on died of his brui&s;es. He was only in the twenty-fifth year of his age.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="031906_0204_0FEF44EB95D6A320">Such was the picture of national independence and dignity that America, during 1796, exhibited by &s;ea. At &s;ome future opportunity the narrative will, perhaps, be re&s;umed and completed. In the mean time, the&s;e in&s;tances may be compared, by an impartial citizen, with the cen&s;ure be&s;towed by Barras, on the government of the United States. He can then attempt to decide, whether Mr. Wa&s;h|ington had, la&s;t year, greater cau&s;e to complain of England, or Mr. Adams, in the pre&s;ent year, of France. We &s;hall now proceed to examine &s;ome federal tran&s;actions by land. In a work embracing &s;uch various objects, many points of importance are &s;ure of being omitted.

<P>Among the memorials pre&s;ented to Congre&s;s, in &s;pring, 1796, perhaps none de&s;erved more atten|tion, than that of the &s;nuff-makers of this city, re|&s;pecting the exci&s;e on their manufacture. On the 5th of June, 1794, an act had pa&s;t in Congre&s;s, for levying a duty of &s;ix cents per pound, upon all &s;nuff, manufactured in the United States. As this law did not an&s;wer the end propo&s;ed, it was re|pealed, and on the 3d of March, 1795, another was enacted in its room. By the l4ter, two thou|&s;and two hundred and forty dollars were to be paid for every &s;nuff mill, with &s;tampers and grind|ers, and &s;ums proportionably le&s;s, for tho&s;e of in|ferior effect. As a relief to the &s;nuff-maker, he received a drawback of &s;ix cents upon every pound of &s;nuff, exported out of the country. The fir&s;t of the&s;e two laws originated with Mr. Alexander
<PB N="197" REF="031906_0205_0FEF44EFF9AF45E0">
Hamilton, then Secretary of the Trer&s;ury. Both of them met with warm oppo&s;ition in Congre&s;s. Both were, in an eminent degree, ab&s;urd, oppre&s;|&s;ive, and impracticable. Both de&s;erve to be held in remembrance, as proofs of what &s;hocking de&s;|poti&s;m the legi&s;lature, even of a free country, may po&s;&s;ibly commit. They were &s;aid to be laws of experiment, by tho&s;e who were lea&s;t eager in their defence. But a government has no right of ma|king experiments in oppo&s;ition to probability, on the property of the public. The memorial was pre&s;ented on the 9th of February, 1796, and is in the&s;e words.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>To the Senate and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of the United States, in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled:</HI> The memorial of the &s;ub&s;cribers, manufacturers of &s;nuff in the city of Philadelphia, <HI>Re&s;pectfully repre&s;ents,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT whil&s;t the United States exhibit an univer&s;al ap|pearance of public pro&s;perity, and of private happine&s;s, the memoriali&s;ts feel deep regret and mortification upon their be|ing once more compelled to addre&s;s you in the &s;olitary lan|guage of di&s;&s;atisfaction. They have &s;ometime ago entered into a &s;truggle to &s;upport a &s;econd exci&s;e law upon their ma|nufacture. Your predece&s;&s;ors, the late Congre&s;s, gave a fair trial to the fir&s;t act, which attempted to levy a duty on &s;nuff in proportion to the pound weight. This law, as the honourable Congre&s;s well knows, operated at once like a &s;troke of annihilation. No exci&s;e could be paid, at lea&s;t in the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania; for, out of &s;even &s;nuff-mills, &s;ix were in&s;tantly &s;hut up, to the infinite injury of the manufac|turers. Their &s;tock lay dead on their hands. Their cu&s;|tomers di&s;per&s;ed, and in many ca&s;es declined to pay the out|&s;tanding debts, becau&s;e the &s;ub&s;cribers, having no power to manufacture &s;nuff, were unable to give them further credit. The buildings for carrying on their manufactories, erected at an expence of many thou&s;and dollars, were at once conver|ted into &s;epulchres of American indu&s;try; and, in the vain at|tempt
<PB N="198" REF="031906_0206_0FEF32BFD4F00FC8">
to extract a revenue, where every moral and phy&s;ical circum&s;tance rendered it impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ix months of bu&s;ine&s;s and of human life were lo&s;t. Even the &s;eventh &s;nuff-mill, which actually was entered, never paid any duty.</P>
<P>Every feature in the hi&s;tory of this fir&s;t exci&s;e upon &s;nuff, ju&s;tified the energetic pre&s;age of a gentleman, who was a member of the la&s;t, and is one in the pre&s;ent Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives of Congre&s;s. He declared in his place that the act would terminate not in revenue, but de&s;truction. The ac|curacy of his prediction hath been verified by experience, and fully acknowledged and atte&s;ted on the floor of Congre&s;s. The effects of that memorable &s;tatute were perhaps unrivalled, even in the tragical and exterminating annals of exci&s;e. Like a pe&s;tilence, or a tempe&s;t, this law bla&s;ted and &s;wept before it every blo&s;&s;om of indu&s;try, and had your memoriali&s;ts re|mained ever &s;ince entirely unmole&s;ted by exci&s;e laws, yet &s;ome years of good fortune would have been requi&s;ite for en|abling them to recover the ground which they had lo&s;t.</P>
<P>That, with the deepe&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, the memoriali&s;ts have, during the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, heard of &s;everal petitions pre&s;ented to Congre&s;s, chiefly as they believe from &s;nuff-makers in the ea&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> &s;tates, reque&s;ting the repeal of the pre&s;ent exci&s;e, in order to replace it by the former law for levying the duty by the pound weight. The&s;e petitioners have indeed hone&s;t|ly repre&s;ented many in&s;urmountable objections to the pre&s;ent law, and which your memoriali&s;ts admit, as well as they do. But it does not follow, that the pre&s;ent extremely oppre&s;&s;ive exci&s;e on &s;nuff ought to be &s;uperceded for the &s;ake of adop|ting another &s;tatute which is infinitely wor&s;e, and which has already been tried and ca&s;t a&s;ide as impracticable. The ruin|ous effects of both the&s;e laws, have been fully &s;tated in a &s;hort hi&s;tory of exci&s;e laws, drawn up at the de&s;ire and un|der the in&s;pection of a number of manufacturers in Philadel|phia, and of which a printed copy has lately been tran&s;mitted to each of the members of the two hou&s;es of Congre&s;s, and to the principal officers of the federal government.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t act for an exci&s;e upon &s;nuff, a drawback of &s;ix cents per pound has been allowed upon the exportation. This drawback was liable to various abu&s;es. If not granted at all, &s;nuff could not be exported after paying an exci&s;e, and this would tend to depre&s;s the American manufacturer. But, in order to be entitled to the drawback, it was requi&s;ite to ob|tain a certificate of the &s;nuff having been duly landed at the
<PB N="199" REF="031906_0207_0FEF44F24BC4C970">
de&s;tined port: the chief exportation was to the Briti&s;h We&s;t-Indies, where American &s;nuff is contraband, and con&s;equently it was quite impo&s;&s;ible to get the requi&s;ite certificates. But farther, nothing could be more ea&s;y than to make a preten|ded exportation of &s;nuff to &s;ome i&s;land in the We&s;t-Indies, where it was not prohibited, obtain a regular certificate of its being landed, and then &s;muggle it back to this country. Thus one barrel of &s;nuff, might receive twenty drawbacks. Such frauds are practi&s;ed every day in Britain. Many mer|chants on the river Thames &s;upport their families in &s;plendor by drawbacks, procured from their government for imagi|nary exportations. Your memoriali&s;ts have been a&s;&s;ured, that one bale of mu&s;lin, &s;uppo&s;ed to be worth five hundred guineas, received in this way a drawback of twelve and an half per cent forty times over, &s;o that this bale earned two thou&s;and five hundred guineas.</P>
<P>Tra&s;h of any kind, or even &s;and, might be exported from the United States, under the name of &s;nuff, and obtain the &s;ix cents per pound of drawback. Frauds of this kind could not be prevented without a multiplicity of in&s;pectors, who&s;e &s;alaries would &s;wallow up the revenue.</P>
<P>That the eighty-fourth and ninety-third &s;ections of the Briti&s;h tobacco exci&s;e act of 1789, fully &s;hew, to what length impo&s;tures of this &s;ort have been carried in that country. The former of the&s;e two clau&s;es, inflicts a penalty of two hundred pounds, for the mixture of cut walnut leaves, of hops, of &s;ycamore, or ony other leaves or herbs, with the leaves of tobacco. The injunctions in the ninety-third &s;ection, again&s;t mixing &s;nuff with other materials, are &s;till more pointed. The penalty of two hundred pounds is levi|ed for mixing with &s;nuff, any fu&s;tick, yellow honey, touch-wood, log-wood, red or guinea-wood, braziletto or Jamai|ca-wood, Nicaragua-wood, Saunders-wood or any other &s;ort of wood, or any walnut tree leaves, hops, &s;ycamore, or any other leaves or herbs. This &s;ingular enumeration a&s;cer|tains how far &s;uch practices have gone.</P>
<P>That there is another material objection to the pre&s;ent mode of granting a drawback. The price of different kinds of &s;nuff differs very con&s;iderably, and yet the &s;ame drawback of &s;ix cents is granted, without di&s;tinction, upon all kinds. Richard Gernon &amp; Co. in their petition, &s;tate, that the &s;nuff which they have been exporting is worth ten cents per pound, be&s;ides the &s;ix cents of drawback. Thus its value, after pay|ing
<PB N="200" REF="031906_0208_0FEF32C2B490F478">
the duty, would be about one &s;hilling and three pence per pound. The memoriali&s;ts are now &s;elling &s;nuff at two &s;hil|lings and &s;ix pence and three &s;hillings per pound, and were they to export it, a drawback of at lea&s;t twelve cents per pound would be nece&s;&s;ary to put them on a level with Ger|non &amp; Co. who receive &s;ix cents per pound drawback on an article not half &s;o valuable.</P>
<P>The memoriali&s;ts, in their publication already referred to, &s;tated the po&s;&s;ibility that the drawbacks for a &s;ingle manufac|turer might amount to &s;ixty thou&s;and dollars per annum, and if a dozen &s;uch manufacturers were to be found in the United States, that they would drain the public trea&s;ury of &s;even hun|dred and twenty thou&s;and dollars a year, a &s;um which all the ex|ci&s;es in the country could not cover. To the great a&s;toni&s;hment of the memoriali&s;ts, this prediction received a partial fulfilment almo&s;t at the in&s;tant when it was made. The revenue deri|ved from the mills, entered in the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, comes only to eight thou&s;and three hundred and eighty dollars. On the 26th January la&s;t, the drawbacks, at the port of Phi|ladelphia, &s;ince the new act began to operate, amounted to eight thou&s;and five hundred and twenty-three dollars and thirty-nine cents, which is already one hundred and forty-three dollars, and thirty-nine cents, more than the total re|venue for this &s;tate. Almo&s;t the whole of this drawback has been paid to Me&s;&s;rs. Richard Gernon &amp; Co. who have been only about four months in bu&s;ine&s;s, and within that period, have got back above five thou&s;and dollars additional, be&s;ides the two thou&s;and two hundred and forty dollars, which they paid, according to law, for entering their mill. It is not the de&s;ign of your memoriali&s;ts to ca&s;t the &s;lighte&s;t reflection on the conduct of this manufacturing company. On the contrary, if government has laid it&s;elf open by a law which defeats its own purpo&s;es, and &s;inks a revenue where it expected to rai&s;e one, the manufacturers are in com|mon ju&s;tice, entitled, to take every legal advantage of &s;uch an over&s;ight. Nay, they beg leave to &s;tate it as a matter of ab&s;olute certainty, that if this law is not repeated, a number of &s;nuff-makers will immediately enter into the bu&s;ine&s;s of exportation. They only forbear altering their mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s, and adapting them for the bu&s;ine&s;s, till they &s;ee whether Congre&s;s will adhere to the law or not; for the example of Richard Gernon &amp; Co. proves how ea&s;ily a &s;nuff-maker, with the requi&s;ite degree of capital and enterpri&s;e, may take from the public trea&s;ury in the &s;hape
<PB N="201" REF="031906_0209_0FEF44F56FE5AC48">
of drawbacks ten times as much as he pays into it. Your memoriali&s;ts cannot believe that Congre&s;s, or indeed any le|gi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly on earth, would &s;uffer the longer exi&s;tence of a law &s;o pregnant with the mo&s;t prepo&s;terous and ruinous con&s;equences. A few weeks ago, Me&s;&s;rs. Gernon &amp; Co. pre&s;ented to Congre&s;s a memorial, repre&s;enting the immen&s;e expence which they have been at in preparing their mill to grind &s;nuff for exportation. Among other details, they &s;tate their having, in the fir&s;t four months of their copartnery, pur|cha&s;ed four hundred and thirty hog&s;heads of tobacco, and that they are continuing to make large purcha&s;es of this kind. At that rate, they will, in the cour&s;e of twelve months, pur|cha&s;e, altogether, twelve hundred and ninety hog&s;heads. Your memoriali&s;ts e&s;timate, that, when grinded into &s;nuff, the drawback on this quantity will amount to about ninety thou&s;and dollars. The company will thus gain, by the pub|lic revenue, eighty-eight thou&s;and dollars, the drawback exceeding the revenue in the proportion of forty-five to one. This is a circum&s;tance perfectly novel in the hi&s;tory of tax|ation.</P>
<P>But further, if this affair is &s;uffered to go on in its pre|&s;ent way, Congre&s;s may &s;oon expect to &s;ee twenty other &s;nuff-mills working on the &s;ame plan, and to an equal ex|tent, with that of Gernon &amp; Co.</P>
<P>If the government of this country intend, &s;eriou&s;ly, and &s;teadily, to give a drawback of &s;ix cents per pound on the exportation of American &s;nuff, it is the mo&s;t acceptable and joyful intelligence that your memoriali&s;ts could ever hear of. They will immediately repair their mills, extend their pur|cha&s;es, and they have not a doubt of clearing, from the draw|back, before the end of a year, twenty or thirty times the &s;um which they are to pay into the trea&s;ury. Twenty ma|nufacturers, like Gernon &amp; Co. would each of them thus co&s;t government ninety thou&s;and dollars, or, collectively, one million eight hundred thou&s;and dollars per annum. The original object of the law was &s;aid to be a revenue of forty thou&s;and dollars; there is an equal chance, that, in &s;earch of it, forty-five times that &s;um will be &s;unk. It has been abovementioned, that the drawbacks, within this &s;tate, al|ready exceed the revenue. The fir&s;t year of this law ex|pires on the la&s;t day of March next, and, before that time, there will mo&s;t likely be a balance of &s;everal thou&s;and dollars again&s;t the revenue, at the port of Philadelphia. But if the

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their hi&s;tory of exci&s;e, the manufacturers &s;tated the prin|ciple, that all taxes ought to be levied in proportion to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">um of per&s;onal property. Since their publication took place, they have &s;een this doctrine ju&s;tified by an authority of the highe&s;t nature&punc; The new con&s;titution of France, in the &s;ixteenth article of the fir&s;t &s;ection, lays it down as a fun|damental maxim, that, "as all taxes are e&s;tabli&s;hed for the general good, they ought to be apportioned among the taxed in the ratio of their means." Under the head of finances, al|&s;o, in the &s;ame work, it is declared, "that taxes of all kinds are a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed among all tho&s;e liable to contribution according to their means."&mdash;Your memoriali&s;ts cannot deny that the word exci&s;e is to be found in the letter of the federal con|&s;titution; but they &s;trongly contend, that it is entirely ho&s;|tile to the &s;pirit of that in&s;trument. One of the principle fa|bricators of that production, was the pre&s;ent judge Wil&s;on. When the &s;ubject was debated in the convention of Penn|&s;ylvania, he argued that it was nece&s;&s;ary to give all power to government, but he was certain that an exci&s;e never would be impo&s;ed, unle&s;s in the la&s;t extremity. From the opinion which the convention of Penn&s;ylvania expre&s;&s;ed of exci&s;e, at that time, and which the a&s;&s;embly of this &s;tate have expre&s;&s;ed &s;ince, it is evident that they never would have con&s;ented to ratify &s;uch a &s;tipulation, if they had conceived that it was to become one of the fir&s;t, and favourite re&s;ources of government.</P>
<P>That your memoriali&s;ts, cannot help con&s;idering this exci&s;e on &s;nuff as coming, exactly, under the de&s;cription of an <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> law. They had no contemplation of &s;uch a bur|den, when they built their mills, and gave credit, to &s;o great an extent, to their cu&s;tomers. Their mills would not, at pre&s;ent, &s;ell for one half of the money which they originally co&s;t, and one half of them are, at this hour, &s;tanding idle. This, of it&s;elf, would be &s;ufficient to de&s;troy any &s;et of manufacturers. Your memoriali&s;ts likewi&s;e beg leave to &s;tate, as their opinion, that if the merchants and manufactu|rers of Britain had a liberty of petitioning Congre&s;s, they could not &s;olicit a more favourable mode of conduct for their own intere&s;t, than per&s;uading you to trammel, and di&s;tre&s;s, the manufacturers of America with exci&s;es, which do not pay the expence of their collection, which in one &s;tate pro|duce

bankruptcy, and in a &s;econd, rebellion. They humbly regard it as chimerical to term America independent of Bri|tain, while we are forced to &s;end to England for a coat, and to Ireland for a &s;hirt. It is this commercial chain of de|pendence in which Britain has entangled &s;o many nations, that con&s;titutes the e&s;&s;ence and &s;oul of her &s;trength, and that enables her to bully, to combat, and to rob her neighbours. It is her &s;uperiority in manufactures, which has enabled this kingdom to &s;ub&s;idize and embattle pirates and cut-throats, in every corner of the world, while &s;he her&s;elf may be termed a bucanneer of Atlantean magnitude, who&s;e gra&s;p embraces the terraqueous globe, and who&s;e &s;tature reaches from earth to heaven.</P>
<P>To conclude, your memoriali&s;ts ardently flatter them|&s;elves with a hope, that Congre&s;s will &s;ee the expediency, and even the po&s;itive and inevitable nece&s;&s;ity, for an imme|diate and complete abolition of the exci&s;e upon &s;nuff made in America. Though &s;ome ill-advi&s;ed manufacturers to the ea&s;tward have called for the re&s;toration of the act of 1794, the principal &s;nuff-makers, in that part of the union, regard it with as much abhorrence, as the memoriali&s;ts them&s;elves do. To continue the pre&s;ent exci&s;e, and withhold the drawback, would be to prohibit, in a great mea&s;ure, the manufacture of tobacco, the &s;econd &s;taple of the continent; and it has alrea|dy been demon&s;trated, that, to continue the law, and the draw|back, in their pre&s;ent &s;hape, is only to &s;quander forty-five dol|lars in a fruitle&s;s &s;earch after one.</P>
<P>Your memoriali&s;ts, therefore, earne&s;tly &s;olicit an entire re|peal of the exci&s;e upon &s;nuff, and they, as in duty bound, will ever pray, &amp;c.</P>

<P>The &s;tatute hath been &s;ince repeatedly &s;u&s;pen|ded, and, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, will never more be put into execution.</P>
<P>Some people may wonder what the Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives
<PB N="204" REF="031906_0212_0FEF4566C5B8A150">
were thinking of, when they &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively enacted &s;uch &s;elf-condemned laws. It is likely that, during the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, ten or fifteen were employed in reading new&s;papers, or in wri|ting letters. About as many more might be in pri|vate conver&s;ation, at the back of the Speaker's chair, or at the windows. General Samuel Smith, who hath &s;aved the hou&s;e from many woeful mi&s;|takes, is the gentleman alluded to, in the &s;econd paragraph of the memorial.</P>
<P>We now come to a part of the work, more de|licate, perhaps, than any other. The freedoms which the federal party have taken with tho&s;e who differ from their opinions, are univer&s;ally known. The mo&s;t impartial &s;crutiny would determine, that, in the arts of calumny and detraction, their publi|cations exceed, beyond all proportion, tho&s;e of their adver&s;aries. In the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of the fifth Con|gre&s;s, Mr. Harper has publicly declared to the Repre&s;entatives, that Mr. James Munroe, our late envoy to France, was guilty of corruption by for|eign influence. On being que&s;tioned by Mr. Giles, he has promi&s;ed, in due time and place, to bring evi|dence of his accu&s;ation. This example is only one out of hundreds which might be adduced to &s;hew that the friends of <HI>order,</HI> for &s;uch they call them|&s;elves, are re&s;olved to &s;et no limits to their rage and their vengeance. Of cour&s;e, they cannot ex|pect to meet with that tenderne&s;s which they re|fu&s;e to grant.</P>
<P>Attacks on Mr. Munroe have been frequently repeated from the &s;tock-holding pre&s;&s;es. They are cowardly, becau&s;e he is ab&s;ent. They are unju&s;t, becau&s;e his conduct will bear the &s;tricte&s;t enquiry. They are ungrateful, becau&s;e he di&s;played, on an occa&s;ion that will be mentioned immediately, the greate&s;t lenity to Mr. Alexander Hamilton, the prime
<PB N="205" REF="031906_0213_0FEF32CB888A3BC8">
mover of the federal party. When &s;ome of the papers which are now to be laid before the world, were &s;ubmitted to the &s;ecretary; when he was in|formed that they were to be communicated to Pre|&s;ident Wa&s;hington, he entreated, in the mo&s;t anx|ious tone of deprecation, that this mea&s;ure might be &s;u&s;pended. Mr. Munroe was one of the three gentlemen who agreed to a delay. They gave their con&s;ent to it, on his expre&s;s promi&s;e of a guarded behaviour in future, and becau&s;e he attached to the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e papers, a my&s;terious degree of &s;olicitude, which they, feeling no per&s;onal re&s;ent|ment again&s;t the individual, were unwilling to aug|ment.</P>
<P>The unfounded reproaches heaped on Mr. Mun|roe, form the immediate motive to the publication of the&s;e papers. They are here printed from an at|te&s;ted copy, exactly conformable to that, which, at his own de&s;ire, was delivered to Mr. Hamilton him&s;elf. Not a word has been added or altered, and the period of four years may, &s;urely, have been enough to furni&s;h the ex-&s;ecretary with mate|rials for his defence. In the letters of Camillus, the mo&s;t &s;ublime principles of action are every where inculcated. But we &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;ee this great ma&s;ter of morality, though him&s;elf the father of a family, confe&s;&s;ing that he had an illicit cor|re&s;pondence with another man's wife. If any thing can be yet le&s;s reputable, it is, that the gentlemen to whom he made that acknowledgement held it as an impo&s;ition, and found various rea&s;ons for be|lieving that Mrs. Reynolds was, in reality, guilt|le&s;s. An attentive critic will be led to enquire what has become of her hu&s;band, and why the in|dignant innocence of Mr. Hamilton, did not pro|mote the completion of public ju&s;tice again&s;t a per|&s;on, who had treated his name with &s;uch gro&s;s di&s;|re&s;pect?
<PB N="206" REF="031906_0214_0FEF456861CFD688">
What a &s;candalous imputation was it for this culprit to ca&s;t upon our &s;ecretary, that he had gained thirty thou&s;and dollars by the purcha&s;e of army certificates, that this fellow could bring him to capital puni&s;hment, &amp;c. &amp;c.? It is to be wi&s;hed that Reynolds may &s;till be found, and that, to borrow the words of his friend, Dr. William Smith, the Secretary may come out of this matter, "as fair as the pure&s;t <HI>angel in heaven!</HI>"</P>
<P>Before committing the following papers to the world, their editor mu&s;t again beg leave to re|mark, that they are nothing more nor le&s;s than ex|act copies, from atte&s;ted originals, of which Mr. Hamilton, as hereafter &s;pecified, has been, at his own de&s;ire, &s;upplied with an accurate tran&s;cript. Some expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed by the culprit, Reynolds, are har&s;h, and convey di&s;gu&s;t, without adding to conviction. The editor, from aver&s;ion to invec|tive, had, on this account, re&s;olved to leave them out, as well as &s;everal other pa&s;&s;ages, which are of little importance to the main point. But on due reflection, it has been found &s;afer, and more advi&s;eable, to publi&s;h the whole, even at the ha|zard of being tedious. This precludes all pre|tence of mutilation for unfair purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>As to the a&s;perity of &s;tyle in &s;ome parts of the <HI>precious confe&s;&s;ions</HI> of Reynolds, the painful reluc|tance of the editor, to the printing of them, has been &s;omewhat le&s;&s;ened, from the volunteer ac|knowledgment of &s;eduction, emitted by the ex-&s;ecretary him&s;elf. This appears to be about as bad, as any thing which his wretched under&s;trap|per either &s;aid again&s;t him, or could imaginably have to &s;ay. A procurer has always been regarded as in the lowe&s;t &s;cale of human character. <HI>Mutatis mutandis,</HI> the patron of &s;uch an agent can have no &s;cruple to become one.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="031906_0215_0FEF456AE92AD180">Again, the intemperate &s;tile of the convivial and confidential communications of our ex-&s;ecre|tary, prohibits him from being regarded as any peculiar object of indulgence. For in&s;tance, he has often boa&s;ted of rceieving letters from Pre&s;ident Wa&s;hington, with the word <HI>private</HI> wrote on the back of them, and a cro&s;s drawn over the &s;eal. <Q>After opening &s;uch a parcel, &s;aid Mr. Hamilton, what do you think were the contents? DEAR HAMILTON, <HI>put this into &s;tyle for me.</HI> Some &s;peech or letter has been inclo&s;ed, which I wrote over again, &s;ent it back, and then the OLD DAMNED FOOL gave it away as <HI>his own.</HI></Q> Mr. Hamilton is not &s;ingular in u&s;ing this &s;tyle to general Wa&s;h|ington. After the &s;quabble between citizen Genet, John Jay, and Rufus King, the two latter &s;ent a mo&s;t in&s;ulting letter to the Pre&s;ident. Randolph advi&s;ed him to re&s;ent it. He had once re&s;olved to do &s;o; but altered his intention, from a jealou&s;y that the writers were in concert with Hamilton, from whom he could not determine to disjoin him|&s;elf. Jay and King wanted to obtain a certificate which Mr. Jeffer&s;on had drawn up, relating to the behaviour of citizen Genet. The Pre&s;ident actual|ly gave them the certificate, but it is thought that they found it not to their purpo&s;e; for it was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, Jay and King al&s;o got back from the Pre&s;ident their impertinent letter; of which, after cooling, they began to be a&s;hamed. But a copy of it is in exi&s;tence, and &s;ome hopes remain of its being obtained for publication. The&s;e par|ticulars are derived from undoubted authority. They prove what was &s;o fully &s;tated in the Ameri|can Annual Regi&s;ter, that the federal party de&s;|pi&s;ed the late Pre&s;ident; that they took frequent opportunities of in&s;ulting him; and that they a&s;|&s;umed the popularity of his name with no view but to &s;erve their own ends.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="031906_0216_0FEF456D81E07030">To be the prompter and <HI>primum mobile</HI> of the greate&s;t man in the world, might have flattered the vanity of a more di&s;creet favourite than Mr. Ha|milton. To hear the Repre&s;entatives, as in No|vember, 1794, di&s;pute for three weeks upon the wording of an an&s;wer to a &s;pecch of his own com|po&s;ition, mu&s;t have been highly &s;oothing to the &s;elf-importance of the ex-&s;ecretary. But, as general Wa&s;hington had been, in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word, his benefactor, he ought to have concealed the imperfections of his friend. He has often com|pared his influence over the Pre&s;ident to that of the wind upon a weather cock, or of that over an au|tomaton, moved only by the hand which directs it. This &s;tyle was both imprudent and ungrateful. His power was very great, but not entirely unbounded. He wanted to be &s;ent to England as envoy to ne|gociate the treaty. The arguments of Randolph hindered the Pre&s;ident from giving his con&s;ent. That the pen of Mr. Hamilton has long a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Pre&s;ident is a &s;tory current in Europe as well as in America; and that the &s;peeches and letters of gene|neral Wa&s;hington are extremely different from his more early productions is very well known.</P>
<P>We &s;hall conclude the&s;e prefatory ob&s;ervations with an anecdote. During the late canva&s;s for the election of a Pre&s;ident, Web&s;ter, in his Minerva, gave a hint, that Mr. Hamilton would be an advi&s;|able candidate. A per&s;on in this city, who chanced to &s;ee this new&s;paper, wrote immediately to a cor|re&s;pondent in New-York. The letter de&s;ired him to put him&s;elf in Mr. Hamilton's way, and inform him that if Web&s;ter &s;hould, in future, print a &s;ingle paragraph on that head, the following papers were in&s;tantly to be laid before the world. It is believed the me&s;&s;age was delivered to Mr. Hamilton, for the Minerva became &s;ilent.</P>

<P>JACOB CLINGMAN, being a clerk in my employ|ment, (F. A.

I promi&s;ed, &s;o far as re&s;pected Clingman; but, not being particularly acquainted with Reynolds, in a great mea|&s;ure, declined &s;o far as re&s;pected him. In company with colo|nel Burr, I waited on colonel Hamilton for the purpo&s;e, and particularly recommended Clingman, who had hitherto &s;u&s;|tained a good character. Colonel Hamilton &s;ignified a wi&s;h to do all that was con&s;i&s;tent. Shortly after, I waited on the Comp|troller for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, who &s;eemed to have difficulties on the &s;ubject; and, from &s;ome information I had, in the mean time, received, I could not undertake to recommend Reynolds, as I verily believed him to be a ra&s;cal, which words I made u&s;e of to the Comptroller. On a &s;econd interview with the Comptroller, on the &s;ame &s;ubject, the latter urged the propriety of Clingman's delivering up a certain li&s;t of money due to in|dividuals, which Reynolds and Clingman were &s;aid to have in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and of his informing him, of whom, and through whom, the &s;ame was obtained from the public offices; on doing which, Clingman's reque&s;t might, perhaps, be granted with greater propriety. This, Clingman, I am informed, com|plied with, and al&s;o refunded the money or certificates, which they had improperly obtained from the trea&s;ury. After which, I under&s;tand the action again&s;t both was withdrawn, and Rey|nolds di&s;charged from impri&s;onment, without any farther inter|ference of mine whatever.</P>
<P>During the time this bu&s;ine&s;s was thus depending, and which la&s;ted upwards of three weeks, Clingman, <HI>una&s;ked,</HI> frequently dropped hints to me, that Reynolds had it in his power, <HI>very materially to injure the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury;</HI> and that Reynolds knew &s;everal very improper tran&s;actions of his. I paid little or no attention to tho&s;e hints; but, when they were frequently repeated, and it was even added, that Reynolds &s;aid,

<P>BEING informed ye&s;terday, in the morning, that a per&s;on of the name of Reynolds, from Virginia, Richmond, was con|fined in the jail, upon &s;ome criminal pro&s;ecution relative to cer|tificates, and that he had intimated, he would give &s;ome intel|ligence of &s;peculations by Mr. Hamilton, which &s;hould be known, WE immediately called on him, as well to be informed of the &s;ituation of the man, as of tho&s;e other matters, in which the public might be intere&s;ted. We found it was not the per|&s;on, we had been taught to believe, but a man of that name from New-York, and who had, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, re&s;ided in this city.

the pro&s;ecution was commenced again&s;t him, he applied to this per&s;on for coun&s;el, who advi&s;ed him to keep out of the way, for a few days; that a merchant came to him, and offered, as a volunteer, to be his bail, who, he &s;u&s;pected, had been in&s;tigated by this per&s;on; and, after being decoyed to the place, the mer|chant wi&s;hed to carry him <HI>[to],</HI> he refu&s;ed being his bail, unle&s;s he would depo&s;it a &s;um of money, to &s;ome con&s;iderable amount, which he could not do, and was, in con&s;equence, committed to pri&s;on. As well as we remember, he gave, as a rea&s;on, why he could not communicate to us, what he knew of the facts alluded to, that he was apprehen&s;ive, it might prevent his di&s;charge; but that he would certainly communicate the whole to us, at ten this morning: at which time, we were informed, he had ab&s;conded, or concealed him&s;elf.</P>

in the night. He a&s;ked her, how long Mr. Reynolds had been acquainted with colonel Hamilton? She replied, &s;ome months; that colonel Hamilton had a&s;&s;i&s;ted her hu&s;band; that &s;ometime before that, he had received upwards of eleven hundred dollars, of colonel Hamilton. Sometime after this, Clingman was at the hou&s;e of Reynolds, and &s;aw colonel Hamilton; he retired and left him there.</P>
<P>A little after Duer's failure, Reynolds told Clingman, in confidence, that if Duer had held up, three days longer, he &s;hould have made fifteen hundred pounds, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of colonel Hamilton; that colonel Hamilton had informed him, <HI>that he was connected with Duer.</HI> Mr. Reynolds al&s;o &s;aid, that colonel Hamilton had made <HI>thirty thou&s;and dollars</HI> by &s;peculation; that colonel Hamilton had &s;upplied him with money to &s;peculate. That, about June la&s;t, Reynolds told Clingman, that he had applied to colonel Hamilton for money to &s;ub&s;cribe to the turnpike-road at Lanca&s;ter, and had received a note from him, in the&s;e words, <Q>It is utterly out of my pow|er, I a&s;&s;ure you, upon my honour, to comply with your re|que&s;t. Your note is returned;</Q> which original note, ac|companying this, has been in Clingman's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion ever &s;ince. Mr. Reynolds has once or twice mentioned to Cling|man, that he had it in his power <HI>to hang colonel Hamilton;</HI> that if he wanted money, he was <HI>obliged to let him have it.</HI> That he (Clingman) has occa&s;ionally lent money to Reynolds who always told him, that he could always get it from colo|nel Hamilton, to repay it; that, on one occa&s;ion, Clingman lent him two hundred dollars; that Reynolds promi&s;ed to pay him, through the means of colonel Hamilton; that he went with him, &s;aw him go into colonel Hamilton's; that, after he came out, he paid him one hundred dollars, which, he &s;aid, was part of the &s;um, he had got; and paid the balance, in a few days; the latter &s;um paid was &s;aid to have been received from colonel Hamilton, after his return from Jer&s;ey, having made a vi&s;it to the manufacturing &s;ociety there.</P>
<P>After a warrant was i&s;&s;ued again&s;t Reynolds, upon a late pro&s;ecution, which was in&s;tituted again&s;t him, Clingman, &s;ee|ing Reynolds, a&s;ked him, why he did not apply to his friend colonel Hamilton? He &s;aid, he would go immediately, and went accordingly. He &s;aid afterwards, that colonel Hamilton advi&s;ed him to keep out of the way, a few days, and the mat|ter would be &s;ettled. That after this time, Henry Seckel,
<PB N="214" REF="031906_0222_0FEF457BF6F9D658">
went to Reynolds, and offered to be his bail, if he would go with him to Mr. Baker's office, where he had left the officer, who had the warrant in writing; that he prevailed on Rey|nolds to go with him. That after Reynolds was taken into cu&s;tody; Seckel refu&s;ed to become his bail, unle&s;s he would depo&s;it, in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, property to the value of four hundred pounds; upon which, Reynolds wrote to colonel Hamilton, and Mr. Seckel carried the note. After two or three times going, he &s;aw colonel Hamilton. Colonel Hamilton &s;aid, he knew Reynolds and his father; that his father was a good whig in the late war; that was all he could &s;ay; that it was not in his power to a&s;&s;i&s;t him; in con&s;equence of which, Seckel refu&s;ed to be his bail, and Reynolds was impri&s;oned. Mr. Reynolds al&s;o applied to Mr. Francis, who is one of the clerks in the trea&s;ury department; he &s;aid, he could not do any thing, without the con&s;ent of colonel Hamilton; that he would apply to him. He applied to Mr. Hamilton, who told him, that it would not be prudent; if he did, he mu&s;t leave the department.</P>
<P>After Reynolds was confined, Clingman a&s;ked Mrs. Rey|nolds, why &s;he did not apply to colonel Hamilton to di&s;mi&s;s him, as the money was ready to be refunded, that was receiv|ed. She replied, that &s;he had applied to him, and he had &s;ent her to Mr. Wolcot; but directed her not to let Mr. Wolcot know, that he had &s;ent her there. Notwith&s;tanding this in|junction, &s;he did let Mr. Wolcot know, by whom &s;he had been &s;ent, who appeared to be &s;urpri&s;ed at the information, but &s;aid, he would do what he could for her, and would Con&s;ult colonel Hamilton on the occa&s;ion. Colonel Hamilton advi&s;ed her, to get &s;ome per&s;ons of re&s;pectability, to intercede for her hu&s;band, and mentioned Mr. Muhlenberg.</P>
<P>Reynolds continued to be kept in cu&s;tody, for &s;ome time, during which time, Clingman had conver&s;ation with Mr. Wolcot, who &s;aid, if he would give up a li&s;t of &s;oldier's claims, which he had, he &s;hould be relea&s;ed. After this, Mrs. Rey|nolds informed Clingman, that colonel Hamilton had told her, that Clingman &s;hould write a letter to Mr. Wolcot, and a duplicate of the &s;ame to him&s;elf, promi&s;ing to give up the li&s;t, and refund the money which had been obtained on a certificate, which had been &s;aid to have been improperly obtained. Cling|man a&s;ked Mrs. Reynolds, for <HI>the letters</HI> that her hu&s;band had received from colonel Hamilton, from time to time, as he
<PB N="215" REF="031906_0223_0FEF457F1D023948">
might probably u&s;e them to obtain her hu&s;band's liberty. She replied, that colonel Hamilton had reque&s;ted her <HI>to burn all the letters, that were in his hand-writing, or that had his name to them;</HI> which &s;he had done. He pre&s;&s;ed her to exa|mine again, as &s;he might not have de&s;troyed the whole, and they would be u&s;eful. She examined, and found two or three notes, without any name, which <HI>are herewith &s;ubmitted,</HI> and which, &s;he &s;aid, were notes from colonel Hamilton.</P>
<P>Mrs. Reynolds told Clingman, that having heard, that her hu&s;band's father was, in the late war, a commi&s;&s;ary under the direction of colonel Wad&s;worth, &s;he waited on him, to get him to intercede for her hu&s;band's di&s;charge. He told her, he would give her his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;aid, <Q>now you have made me your friend, you mu&s;t apply to no per&s;on el&s;e.</Q> That on Sunday evening, Clingman went to the hou&s;e of Reynolds, and found colonel Wad&s;worth there. He was introduced to colonel Wad&s;|worth, by Mrs. Reynolds. Colonel Wad&s;worth told him, he had &s;een Mr. Wolcot; that Mr. Wolcot would do any thing for him, (Clingman), and Reynolds's family, that he could; that he had called on colonel Hamilton, but had not &s;een him; that he might tell him, Mr. Muhlenberg, that a friend of his (Clingman's) had told him, that colonel Wad&s;|worth was a countryman and &s;choolmate of Mr. Inger&s;oll, and that colonel Wad&s;worth was al&s;o intimate with the governor, and that the governor would do almo&s;t any thing, to oblige him; that his name mu&s;t not be mentioned to Mr. Muhlenberg, as telling him this; but that, if Mr. Muhlenberg could be brought to &s;peak to him fir&s;t, on the &s;ubject, he would then do any thing in his power, for them; and told him not to &s;peak to him, if he &s;hould meet him in the &s;treet; and &s;aid, if his name was mentioned, that he would do nothing. That on Wedne&s;day, Clingman &s;aw colonel Wad&s;worth, at Reynolds's hou&s;e; he did not find her at home, but left a note; but, on going out, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e met her, and &s;aid, he had &s;een every body, and done every thing.</P>
<P>Mrs. Reynolds told Clingman, that &s;he had received money from colonel Hamilton, &s;ince her hu&s;band's confinement, enclo|&s;ed in a note, which note &s;he had burned.</P>
<P>After Reynolds was di&s;charged, (which was eight or nine o'clock on Wedne&s;day evening); about twelve o'clock at night, Mr. Reynolds &s;ent a letter to colonel Hamilton by a girl; which letter, Clingman &s;aw delivered to the girl.
<PB N="216" REF="031906_0224_0FEF45828C530F50">
Reynolds followed the girl, and Clingman followed him. He &s;aw the girl go into colonel Hamilton's hou&s;e. Clingman then joined Reynolds, and they walked back and forward in the &s;treet, until the girl returned, and informed Reynolds, that he <HI>need not go out of town that night,</HI> but call on him early in the morning. In the morning, between &s;even and eight o'clock, he &s;aw Reynolds go to colonel Hamilton's hou&s;e, and go in. He has not &s;een him &s;ince, and &s;uppo&s;es, he is gone out of town.</P>
<P>Mr. Clingman further adds, that &s;ometime ago he was in|formed by Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds, that <HI>he had books contain|ing the amount of the ca&s;h due to the Virginia line at his own hou&s;e at New-York, with liberty to copy,</HI> and were obtain|ed through Mr. Duer.</P>
<P>The above contains the truth, to the be&s;t of my knowledge and recollect on, and to which I am ready to make oath.</P>

<P>Mr. Clingman informs us, that Mr. Reynolds returned to town, on Thur&s;day night, and told him, he had written him a let|ter which he then had; not having had an opportunity to &s;end it to him, and which he then tore; part of which was thrown in|to the fire. Other parts he pre&s;ented to us, and which we now have.</P>
<P>That Reynolds, at the &s;ame time, told him, he had been re|ceived by Mr. Hamilton, the morning of that day, when they parted, about &s;unri&s;e. That he was extremely agitated, <HI>walk|ing backward and forward the room, and &s;triking, alternately, his forehead and his thigh; ob&s;erving to him, that he had ene|mies at work, but was willing to meet them, on fair ground, and reque&s;ted him not to &s;tay long, le&s;t it might be noticed.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Clingman al&s;o informs us, that he received a note from Mr. Wolcot, to meet him, on Friday morning, at half pa&s;t nine (which note we have). That he attended, and had an inter|view with him, in pre&s;ence of Mr. Hamilton; when he was &s;trictly examined by both, re&s;pecting the per&s;ons, who were en|quiring into the matter, and their object; that he told Mr. Hamilton, he had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his notes to Reynolds, and
<PB N="217" REF="031906_0225_0FEF32CD12E985B0">
had given them up to the&s;e gentlemen: and to which, he re|plied, he had done very wrong. That he al&s;o told Mr. Ha|milton of the letter he had received from Reynolds, &s;ince his enlargement, mentioning that he (Mr. Hamilton) would make Francis &s;wear back what he had &s;aid; and to which Mr. Ha|milton replied, he would make him un&s;ay any fal&s;ity he had declared.</P>
<P>Mr. Hamilton &s;aid, Reynolds was a villain, a ra&s;cal, and he &s;uppo&s;ed, would &s;wear to any thing.</P>
<P>Mr. Wolcot &s;aid, that unle&s;s Clingman u&s;ed the &s;ame can|dour to him, that he had done to Clingman, he &s;hould not con|&s;ider him&s;elf bound.</P>
<P>Mr. Hamilton wanted to know, what members of Congre&s;s were concerned in the enquiry, and de&s;ired him to go into the gallery, where he would &s;ee them, and enquire their names of the by&s;tanders.</P>
<P>Mr. Hamilton ob&s;erved, he had had &s;ome tran&s;action with Reynolds, which he had before mentioned, as well as Clingman remembers, to Mr. Wolcot, and need not go into detail.</P>
<P>Clingman al&s;o informs us, that Reynolds told him, &s;ince his enlargement, that when he was about to &s;et out to Virginia, on his la&s;t trip to buy up ca&s;h-claims of the Virginia line, he told Mr. Hamilton, that Hopkins would not pay upon tho&s;e pow|ers of attorney; and to which he, (Mr. Hamilton) replied, he would write to Hopkins, on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>16th. La&s;t night we waited on colonel Hamilton, when he informed us of <HI>a particular connection with Mrs. Reynolds:</HI> the period of its commencement, and circum&s;tances attending it; his vi&s;iting her at In&s;keep's; the frequent &s;upplies of mo|ney to her and her hu&s;band, on that account; his dure&s;s by them from the fear of a di&s;clo&s;ure, and <HI>his anxiety to be relieved from it and them.</HI> To &s;upport this, he &s;hewed a great number of letters from Reynolds and her&s;elf, commencing early in 1791. He acknowledged <HI>all the letters in a di&s;gui&s;ed hand, in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to be his.</HI> We left him under an impre&s;&s;ion, our &s;u&s;picions were removed. He acknowledged our conduct to|ward him had been fair and liberal: he could not complain of it. We brought back all the papers, even his own notes, nor did he a&s;k their de&s;truction.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the pro&s;ecution again&s;t the parties, Reynolds and Clingman, had been in con&s;ideration of a &s;urren|der of a li&s;t of pay improperly obtained from his office, and by

means of a per&s;on, who had it not in his power now to injure the department, intimating he meant Duer: that he obtained this information from Reynolds; owned that he had received a note from Reynolds in the night, at the time &s;tated in Mr. Clingman's paper, and that he had likewi&s;e &s;een him in the morning following: &s;aid, he never had &s;een Reynolds be|fore he came to this place; and that the &s;tatement in Mr. Clingman's paper, in that re&s;pect, was correct.</P>

It has neither date nor addre&s;s; but mu&s;t have been written about the month of June, 1792. On what ground could Reynolds pretend to make &s;uch applications to a per&s;on &s;o far above his rank? The gentle tone of the refu&s;al, al&s;o, de&s;erves notice. It expre&s;sly im|plies a high degree of previous intimacy. The &s;imple a&s;&s;urance of inability was not enough. Mr. Hamilton declares PON HIS HONOUR, that it is not merely <HI>out of his power,</HI> but UTTERLY, &amp;c. How generous! How magnanimous this language of the ex-&s;ecretary! e&s;pecially when he wrote to a being who was in the habit of threatening to bring him to di&s;grace.

<P>Here the &s;tory comes to a cri&s;is. Reynolds, a man of a bad character, and dependent circum|&s;tances, had been ca&s;t into jail for an offence of a very deep dye, and which, as it appears, could have been fixed upon him. In&s;tead of comporting him&s;elf with
<PB N="222" REF="031906_0230_0FEF4597ED513A10">
that humility &s;uitable to a &s;ituation apparently &s;o de&s;|perate, he &s;peaks of nothing el&s;e but ruining and hanging Mr. Hamilton, who, the Pre&s;ident ex|cepted, was the mo&s;t powerful and dangerous enemy that he could have met with on the whole continent. This was not, certainly, an obvious way to get out of pri&s;on. He had been pro&s;ecuted by the Comptrol|ler, Mr. Wolcot, with whom he found no blame; but he affirmed, that it was a &s;cheme of the &s;ecre|tary to keep him <HI>low,</HI> and <HI>drive him away.</HI> Even ad|mitting that his wife was the favourite of Mr. Ha|milton, for which there appears no evidence but the word of the &s;ecretary, this conduct would have been eminently fooli&s;h. Mr. Hamilton had only to &s;ay, that he was &s;ick of his amour, and the influ|ence and hopes of Reynolds at once vani&s;hed. Our &s;ecretary was far above the reach of his revenge. The accu&s;ation of an illicit amour, though &s;ounded in notes louder than the la&s;t trumpet, could not have defamed the conjugal fidelity of Mr. Hamil|ton. It would only have been holding <HI>a farthing candle to the &s;un.</HI> On that point, the world had pre|viou&s;ly fixed its opinion. In the &s;ecretary's bucket of cha&s;tity, a drop more or le&s;s was not to be per|ceived, If Reynolds had no claim to regard but in one of the capacities of Mercury, his accu&s;ations and his threats were more than folly. They were &s;ynonimous to lunacy.</P>
<P>Grounding merely on the procuring &s;y&s;tem, the forbearance of Mr. Hamilton is equally inexplica|ble. The natural temper of our &s;ecretary, where he ventures to exert it, is vindictive and furious<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Findley and Brackenridge, <HI>pa&s;&s;im.</HI></NOTE>, combining <Q>that unu&s;ual mixture of quick feroci|ty and unrelenting vengeance,</Q> which Mr. Hume has marked out as a peculiarity in the character of

William Cobbett, in his Cen&s;or for March 1797, de&s;cribes Mr. Monroe as <Q>a traitor, who has bartered the ho|nour and intere&s;t of his country, to a perfidious and &s;avage enemy.</Q> Me&s;&s;rs. Muhlenberg, Jeffer&s;on, Swanwick, Giles, Madi&s;on, Gallatin, Mr. Tench Coxe, and others, are all &s;poken of in the &s;ame &s;curri|lous way, without the lea&s;t regard to truth or decency. What could ail this writer at Dr. Ru&s;h? That gentleman has long &s;ince quitted politics, and his philo&s;ophical works are better known and more highly re&s;pected in Europe, than tho&s;e of any writer whom the new world has produced, Franklin or Jeffer&s;on's notes excepted.</P>
<P>This man does not write at random. His enemies laughed at him for boa&s;ting of intimacy with &s;ome of the fir&s;t characters in this coun|try. He &s;poke only truth. Not long &s;ince, Mr. Li&s;ton, the Bri|ti&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, came down North Second-&s;treet, pa&s;t by the door of his &s;tore, looked carefully around him, as if to &s;ee whether he was ob&s;erved, then turned back and went in. Two days after he was in the &s;ame &s;tore: and, no doubt his excellency derives much improvement from this elegant and dignified connection.</P></NOTE>. That &s;uch a man, or indeed that any man &s;hould tamely endure this treatment is in it&s;elf highly incredible. No tran&s;ient attach|ment, &s;uch as that which the &s;ecretary alledged that he had, could have been put in the balance again&s;t his official character; and from the time that Mr. Monroe and the other gentlemen &s;aw Reynolds, his reputation was evidently at &s;take.</P>

<P>ON reflection, I deem it advi&s;eable for me to have copies of the &s;everal papers which you communicated to me in our in|terview on Saturday evening, including the notes, and the frag|ment of Mr. Reynold's letter to Mr. Clingman. I therefore reque&s;t that you will either cau&s;e copies of the&s;e papers to be furni&s;hed to me, taken by the per&s;on in who&s;e hand writing the declarations which you &s;hewed to me were, or will let me have the papers them&s;elves to be copied. It is al&s;o my wi&s;h, that all &s;uch papers as are original, may be detained from the par|ties of whom they were had, to put it out of their power to repeat the abu&s;e of them in &s;ituations which may deprive me of the advantage of explanation. Con&s;idering of how abomina|ble an attempt they have been the in&s;truments, I tru&s;t you will feel no &s;cruples about this detention.</P>

<P>The above letter, clo&s;es the collection of papers regarding this affair of Reynolds. It only remains to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations; and the&s;e demand a retro&s;pect.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the magnitude of the object be|fore them, it was highly commendable in the gen|tlemen concerned in the&s;e enquiries to trace the matter as clo&s;ely as they did. The funding of cer|tificates to the extent of perhaps thirty, or thirty-five millions of dollars, at eight times the price
<PB N="225" REF="031906_0233_0FEF459D23EF43B8">
which the holders had actually paid for them, pre|&s;ents, in it&s;elf, one of the mo&s;t egregious, the mo&s;t impudent, the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive, and the mo&s;t provo|king bubbles that ever burle&s;qued the legi&s;lative proceedings of any nation. The debt that could have been di&s;charged for ten or fifteen millions of dollars, was funded at forty millions.</P>
<P>But as the univer&s;al &s;u&s;picion and hatred which the formation of this ma&s;s had excited, might, at &s;ome future period, endanger its exi&s;tence, the a&s;&s;ump|tion act, was brought forward. This law incor|porated into the former &s;tock tho&s;e debts contrac|ted by individual &s;tates during the war. Hence each of them became, for its own &s;ake, intere&s;ted in the &s;upport of public credit which implicated a rid|dance of the debt e&s;pecially due by it&s;elf. Thus the certificate funds were in&s;eparably embodied with a powerful and popular ally, under the &s;helter of who&s;e reputation they might hope for &s;ome degree of longevity. This artful mea&s;ure was pu&s;hed through Congre&s;s by the &s;ame party, who funded the half-crown certificates at twenty &s;hillings. But, even in this project, it is entertaining to notice the blindne&s;s and precipitation of con&s;ci|ous guilt. The paper-jobbing junto were in &s;uch a hurry to &s;helter their &s;peculations under the wings of the above a&s;&s;umption law, that they acted the mea&s;ure in the mo&s;t profligate or bungling manner which can be imagined. Take notice! They pled|ged the public faith for <HI>twenty-two</HI> millions of dol|lars, in&s;tead of <HI>eleven</HI> millions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>The accounts of the union with the individual &s;tates might have been placed in the &s;ame relative &s;ituation in which they now &s;tand, by a&s;&s;uming eleven millions, in&s;tead of twenty-two.

would have &s;ettled the claims, if a rea&s;onable de|gree of time, of judgment, or of method had been employed upon it. This work was the very pin|nacle of &s;tupidity, or knavery, or probably of both. Suppo&s;e that you &s;ee a man go into a &s;tore, and buy ten &s;hillings worth of linen. He receives the cloth, flings down a guinea, and runs away without wai|ting for his change. You will infer that he is ei|ther circulcating fal&s;e money, or has de&s;erted from bedlam. Yet &s;uch is preci&s;ely the <HI>profile.</HI> view of this a&s;&s;umption act. It is natural that Dr. Smith &s;hould be fond of calling Americans the mo&s;t intel|ligent of mankind, when his party have made them &s;uch egregious dupes. Thus, the founder of &s;ome new &s;ect in religion, while cramming the ears of his di&s;ciples with vi&s;ions and miracles, a&s;&s;ures them that they are the cho&s;en people. In both in&s;tan|ces the encomia&s;t holds in his eye the very &s;ame ob|ject. As for the &s;tate of public information, it is likely that not more than one-tenth part of our ci|tizens recollect or have heard any thing of the a&s;|&s;umption act. Not one out of five thou&s;and people is acquainted with this bla&s;ting blunder, about the eleven millions being funded at twenty-two.</P>
<P>This is a profile view of the a&s;&s;umption act. But when we look &s;traight into its face, fraud, anarchy, and rebellion, are &s;een indelibly engraved on its forehead. Witne&s;s the debates of la&s;t winter in Congre&s;s, about the balance due from New-York to the union! A &s;park a thou&s;and times &s;maller, has, before now, involved half the world in conflagra|tion. This act is like an ulcer in the midriff of Ame|rican tranquillity. To paint its po&s;&s;ible effects would require the eloquence of Milton de&s;cribing the <HI>congre&s;s</HI> of <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Sin.</HI></P>

This in&s;titution, and the irre&s;i&s;tible influence which it draws after it, afford a &s;triking evidence of the da|ring and profound genius of its author. By what clau&s;e of the con&s;titution Congre&s;s thought them|&s;elves authori&s;ed to turn bankers, they have not yet informed the public. From any thing which appears on the face of that in&s;trument, they had no more warrant for erecting banks than for erecting pyramids. Their plea, that the in&s;titution was to be of national benefit, does not form a proper apology. It would have been bet|ter to tell the real motive, which was, that the lea|ders of a majority in Congre&s;s expected the &s;cheme to i&s;&s;ue in per&s;onal advantage to them&s;elves. The report of Mr. Hamilton to Congre&s;s, on this bank, promi&s;ed mighty matters which have never come to pa&s;s. But the grand point, the bracing of the funding &s;y&s;tem, has been completely &s;ecured. The city of Wa&s;hington &s;hall be ju&s;t mentioned, as a <HI>quietus</HI> to the hone&s;t credulity of the Pre&s;ident. Millions have been wor&s;e than idly &s;unk upon that &s;pot, which, if government removes to it, may be &s;afely predicted as the tomb of the federal con&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of all the&s;e mea&s;ures hath been a pub|lic debt of eighty millions, in&s;tead of thirty; a re|publican government harna&s;&s;ed in a monarchical fac|tion; a continent overwhelmed with paper money, with jobs, and bankruptcies, of a nature and &s;pecies of infamy almo&s;t unknown in Europe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See, for example, the polite corre&s;pondence between Mr. James Greenleaf and Mr. John Nichol&s;on, that hath &s;o long blockaded the new&s;papers.

<P>Farther ob&s;ervations on the corre&s;pondence between Me&s;&s;rs.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN his letter la&s;t copied, Mr. Hamilton &s;peaks of an <HI>explanation.</HI> He gave nothing meriting that name. The &s;hort way to exculpate him&s;elf was, by confronting Reynolds and his wife, who accu&s;ed him of fraud, with the gentlemen who undertook the enquiry. In&s;tead of that, he &s;ent Reynolds and his wife out of the way, to prevent any &s;uch per&s;onal exculpation. That <HI>he</HI> packed them off, there can be little doubt, &s;ince the &s;uddene&s;s of the di&s;appear|ance of Reynolds can be accounted for upon no other ground. The letter from Reynolds to Clingman mentions a promi&s;e of that kind, and Mrs. Reynolds
<PB N="229" REF="031906_0237_0FEF32B2DD4725D0">
had previou&s;ly declared, that this was a &s;cheme in contemplation. Reynolds could not fly from fear. The pro&s;ecution again&s;t him was clo&s;ed, and his chief re&s;ource for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence had been by applying to Mr. Hamilton. That he was removed, to keep him from a meeting with Mr. Monroe and his friends, bears the &s;tronge&s;t marks of probability. It may be &s;aid, that the infamous character of Reynolds made him unworthy of credit. Taken by it&s;elf, his te&s;timony was, indeed, worth little; but, when &s;upported by various circum&s;tances, it might me|rit more attention. The profligate manners of the accu&s;er afforded an additional rea&s;on why Mr. Ha|milton, if innocent, &s;hould have brought him for|ward, &s;ince it would have been proportionably a more ea&s;y ta&s;k to convince Mr. Monroe of his fal&s;e|hood. But the &s;ecretary &s;ealed the importance of the accu&s;er's te&s;timony, by forbearing to produce him to the gentlemen enquiring after him. When per&s;ons of &s;o much weight and re&s;pectability had entered upon this bu&s;ine&s;s, every principle of com|mon &s;en&s;e called for the cleare&s;t explanation. In place of that the chief evidence was con|cealed, and &s;ent off, while the ma&s;s of his corre&s;pondence with Mr. Hamilton was, by de&s;ire of the latter, abruptly committed to the flames. You will determine whether the&s;e fugitive mea&s;ures look mo&s;t like innocence, or like &s;omething el&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Hamilton, referring to Reynolds and his wife, calls this an <HI>abominable</HI> attempt. Granted. But, &s;ince the mea&s;ures of him&s;elf and his party, on the affair of certificates, had excited a very general and violent &s;u&s;picion, and &s;ince he well knew that the gentlemen who came forward, were &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the number of tho&s;e who entertained it, every motive of &s;elf-love, and of zeal for the honour of his partizans, &s;hould have prompted Mr. Hamilton to
<PB N="230" REF="031906_0238_0FEF44AF40C67C80">
tear up the la&s;t twig of jealou&s;y. In place of &s;mo|thering te&s;timony, he &s;hould have courted it. In place of burning letters, he &s;hould have <HI>printed</HI> them. Publicity was the only ba&s;is by which he could main|tain the ground that he was in danger of lo&s;ing. Yet this was the very mode of defence which he cho&s;e to avoid. When Randolph was arraigned of mi&s;conduct not more culpable than that imputed by Reynolds to Hamilton, he pur&s;ued the accu&s;er to Rhode-I&s;land, and obtained a certificate of his innocence, couched in the &s;tronge&s;t terms. Yet the federal party, with their u&s;ual fortitude of a&s;&s;ertion, and infelicity of de|mon&s;tration, have loaded him with reproaches, and the bare &s;uppo&s;ition of the po&s;&s;ibility of his innocence, has been &s;couted as the height of effrontery. Put the ca&s;e that Fauchet, when his apocrypha was in|tercepted, had been in jail, that Randolph, in&s;tead of bringing him forward had paid his debts, burnt all his remaining papers, and hurried him out of the country. Every friend to <HI>order,</HI> would have been convinced that Randolph was guilty, and had re|moved Fauchet, that <Q>the pool of corruption might putrify in peace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert Hall, on the liberty of the pre&s;s.</NOTE>.</Q> The force of moral or pre|&s;umptive te&s;timony does not augment or dimini&s;h, becau&s;e the party accu&s;ed happens to be for or a|gain&s;t the American funding &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Some years ago, the late Pre&s;ident was attacked in the new&s;papers for con&s;tantly uplifting his &s;alary, be|fore it became due. Mr. Hamilton immediately prin|ted a reply that filled nine columns of the Philadel|phia Gazette. Even the very wor&s;t which could be alledged of Mr. Wa&s;hington amounted only to this practice being irregular, improper, and &s;uper-emi|nently ridiculous from a man who pretended to do the bu&s;ine&s;s of his country for his mere hou&s;hold
<PB N="231" REF="031906_0239_0FEF44B1E3D4CA60">
expences. The charge of Reynolds wears a more &s;erious a&s;pect. If he was <HI>one</HI> agent for the pur|cha&s;e of certificates, it may well be conceived, though it cannot <HI>yet</HI> be proved, that our &s;ecretary had twenty others. Phy&s;ician! heal thy&s;elf. Before Mr. Hamilton prints any farther defences of other people, before he again arraigns one-half of his fel|low citizens as cut-throats<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See American Annual Regi&s;ter, chap. x.</NOTE>, let him tell us what has become of Reynolds. Let him ob&s;erve that this nar|rative is explicit; and that, under all the circum|&s;tances of the affair, &s;ilence will be more fatal to his character, than the mo&s;t feeble vindication.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to &s;ee why Mr. Hamilton, and his par|ty, have been permitted to reduce America to its pre&s;ent di&s;agreeable condition. When a merchant refu&s;es not only to balance his books, but vilifies tho&s;e who advi&s;e him to do &s;o, it requires no gho&s;t from the dead, to foretell for what port he is bound. In pri|vate life, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to find &s;uch a fool; but nations are &s;ometimes actuated by a degree of madne&s;s to which, in their individual concerns, it would be impracticable to drive them. Of this re|mark, America, during the &s;hort period of her po|litical career, has afforded various examples. The people of other countries are ignorant again&s;t their will. The citizens of the United States appear of|ten aver&s;e, and even ho&s;tile to information. Thus, the federal con&s;tition, highly re&s;pectable and valu|able as truth mu&s;t acknowledge it to be, was yet an in&s;trument <HI>framed in darkne&s;s.</HI> When the conven|tion who made it met at Philadelphia, they began by &s;hutting their doors. This clande&s;tine appear|ance exhibited the wor&s;t auguries imaginable of what they were going to do. Though they had to frame a con&s;titution, yet, before it could take effect
<PB N="232" REF="031906_0240_0FEF454142115F88">
it was to be &s;ubmitted, &s;eperately, to each of the thirteen &s;tates. To a&s;&s;i&s;t the citizens at large in forming their opinions, the &s;afe&s;t and faire&s;t method was to have debated with open galleries. If the arguments that &s;wayed the deci&s;ion of the delegates were well-founded, they might have had the &s;ame effect on their con&s;tituents <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have not entirely forgot the mode in which the federal con|&s;titution was crammed down the gullet of Penn&s;ylvania. When it fir&s;t appeared, the a&s;&s;embly were in &s;e&s;&s;ion. A minority declined accep|tance, becau&s;e they had no &s;pecial powers to that purpo&s;e from their electors; and, to prevent its pa&s;&s;ing, they &s;eceded from the hou&s;e. The remaining members did not form a quorum. Here they would have &s;tuck, but the friends of <HI>order,</HI> alias, a troop of ruffians, with the captain of a very modern frigate at their head, broke into the lodg|ings of &s;ome &s;eceding members, &s;eized them, dragged them through the &s;treets, with one-half of Philadelphia at their heels, and, by main force, projected them into the a&s;&s;embly. Thus a quorum was for|med, and the con&s;titution accepted, in a way which would have di&s;|graced a gang of g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es.</NOTE>. But, to immure them|&s;elves in the way in which they did, looked more like a Venetian &s;enate, a gang of &s;mugglers or coiners, than the Repre&s;entatives of a free people. The long parliament of England would never have obtained the confidence of their party, they could never have overturned royal de&s;poti&s;m, if they had kept their proceedings and debates a &s;ecret from the world. In England, a &s;tate-trial mu&s;t be carried on in pub|lic. The &s;pirit of the country would not endure the concealment of &s;uch a tran&s;action. In the cour&s;e of ordinary affairs, the pre&s;ent Hou&s;e of Com|mons do not &s;hut their doors above once in &s;everal years. But the framing of a con&s;titution is of in|finitely more importance than the u&s;ual routine of bu&s;ine&s;s; the Engli&s;h people would not, on &s;uch an emergency, &s;ubmit to exclu&s;ion. The Scots union was previou&s;ly known to be dete&s;ted by all ranks of people; and brought the country to the brink of a revolution. Yet the Scots parliament debated
<PB N="233" REF="031906_0241_0FEF44F9E4F8A538">
with open doors. The acquie&s;cence of our citizens in the Tiberian privacy of their delegates, has mar|ked a peculiarity in the American character.</P>
<P>The arrival of Jay's treaty afforded another in|&s;tance of the &s;ame kind. In London, public impa|tience would, by &s;uch a circum&s;tance, have been wounded up to the highe&s;t degree; and the proud|e&s;t mini&s;ter mu&s;t have found his popularity inte|re&s;ted in an early communication. But at Philadel|phia, there was even a parade of &s;ecrecy. The treaty reached the Pre&s;ident on the 7th of March, 1795. In&s;tead of laying it before the public, who were ultimately to bear its con&s;equences, and who could have made light break in upon every quar|ter, he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed its contents from mankind, till the meeting of the Senate. Thirty gentlemen then &s;hut them&s;elves up, like the tran&s;lators of the Sep|tuagint, as if they had been to act by in&s;piration. Without ra&s;hne&s;s it may be &s;aid, that this <HI>&s;uperior</HI> branch of government, as Mr. Fenno calls it, did not collectively know as much about commerce, and its foreign relations, as general Smith and John Swanwick. The re&s;olution of the Senate to ratify, tran&s;pired on the 24th of June 1795, three months and an half after the Pre&s;ident had got the treaty. This long &s;uppre&s;&s;ion did not excite an audible murmur. Nay, after the ratification, the federal party di&s;played &s;till more &s;trongly their manly no|tions of government. The Senate had ju&s;t one member, general Ma&s;on, of &s;ufficient civility to|wards the public, to &s;end a copy of the treaty to the new&s;papers. This violated an injunction of &s;e|cre&s;y pa&s;t by the Senate. The federal cat calls be|gan in&s;tantly to &s;queak; and, if the general had been forging bank notes, they could hardly have made much more noi&s;e. Thus the Plymouth re&s;o|lutions of the 30th of October, 1795, charged him
<PB N="234" REF="031906_0242_0FEF454D61087390">
with "a notorious breach of official confidence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Carey's Remembrancer, vol. iii. p. 311.</NOTE>." In&s;tead of this language, they &s;hould have thanked him for his intelligence. If it had been communi|cated three months more early, much of the &s;ub&s;e|quent bad con&s;equences might have been prevented. He &s;hould, al&s;o, have printed Jay's in&s;tructions, with minutes of the notable harangues about the <HI>par|tition</HI> of the United States<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">American Annual Regi&s;ter, chap. v.</NOTE>. With open doors, no &s;enator dur&s;t have broached a doctrine of &s;uch en|ormous attrocity. <HI>The ma&s;ter's eye makes a fat hor&s;e,</HI> &s;ays the proverb. In public affairs, the &s;ame ca&s;e holds good. The more that a nation knows about the mode of conducting its bu&s;ine&s;s, the better chance has that bu&s;ine&s;s of being properly conducted. This maxim appears very plain; and, in his dome&s;|tic concerns, every man approves of it. On a great national &s;cale, we are the fir&s;t free people who have rejected it, and that is one of the principal rea&s;ons why &s;ome parts of our federal admini&s;tration have &s;ucceeded &s;o very ill. Secrecy is a favourite doc|trine with our financial Mahomet; and its triumph hath en&s;ured his own.</P>
<P>In the clo&s;e of the la&s;t chapter, the word <HI>con&s;pi|rator</HI> has been employed. It &s;ounds har&s;hly, but it has been in&s;erted on the cleare&s;t evidence, and af|ter the &s;tricte&s;t con&s;ideration. To be convinced of an executive plot, for involving America in a French war, we have only to look at a report from &s;ecretary Pickering to Pre&s;ident Adams, and which, on the 22d of June, 1797, was &s;ent by the latter to Congre&s;s. The title page profe&s;&s;es to &s;tate <Q><HI>the</HI> depredations committed on the commerce of the United States &s;ince the 1&s;t of October, 1796.</Q> Con&s;i&s;tency with this profe&s;&s;ion required, that, as
<PB N="235" REF="031906_0243_0FEF45504FA64578">
much time &s;hould have been be&s;towed on the reci|tal of Briti&s;h captures, as on that of French ones. Apparently grounding on this idea, Mr. Adams, in his me&s;&s;age accompanying the papers, hath the&s;e words: <Q>I directed a collection to be made of ALL &s;uch information as &s;hould be found in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the government.</Q></P>
<P>The report and documents fill about an hundred and &s;ixty pages. The li&s;t of French captures is ta|ken from the Philadelphia and United States ga|zettes. Of the Briti&s;h, Mr. Pickering writes thus:</P>
<P><Q>Captures and lo&s;&s;es by <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> crui&s;ers, the &s;e|cretary pre&s;umes, have not been <HI>numerous;</HI> for, citizens of the United States having, the&s;e three years pa&s;t, been accu&s;tomed to look up to the go|vernment for aid in pro&s;ecuting their claims, it is not to be doubted, that generally the&s;e ca&s;es have been reported to the department of &s;tate. An ab&s;tract of &s;uch as have been communicated, is annexed.</Q> Report, p. 5. This li&s;t amounts on|ly to <HI>ten</HI> ve&s;&s;els. They are di&s;patched in <HI>two</HI> pa|ges. That of captures by the republic occupies about <HI>an hundred and forty.</HI> As an apology for this di&s;proportion of bulk, Mr. Pickering, on p. 9, gives a mo&s;t curious rea&s;on. <Q>This examination was chiefly made <HI>prior</HI> to the call of the hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives for a report on this &s;ubject, with a view to a&s;certain the number of French cap|tures, and the circum&s;tances attending them; and the re&s;ult of the whole is annexed. It is regretted, that the time did not permit a re-examination of tho&s;e papers to a&s;certain likewi&s;e the captures made by the Briti&s;h crui&s;ers.</Q> The call of the hou&s;e was dated the 10th of June. The papers were laid before the hou&s;e on the 22d, being at an interval of <HI>twelve</HI> days. As the French li&s;t had been made out beforehand, the &s;ecretary had the more
<PB N="236" REF="031906_0244_0FEF44B391308EF8">
time to compile the Briti&s;h li&s;t. Six active clerks, like tho&s;e in his own office, could, with great ea&s;e, have completed the bu&s;ine&s;s in forty-eight hours at farthe&s;t. Where was the mighty affair of turning over two files of new&s;papers for the la&s;t eight months? With &s;ome diligence, the whole might have been fini&s;hed in a &s;ingle afternoon. In a city like Philadel|phia, full of public offices, and able tran&s;cribers, the &s;ecretary, if he had been in earne&s;t, could have col|lected forty proper a&s;&s;i&s;tants, on an hour's warning; and even admitting the Briti&s;h li&s;t to be as bulky as the French one, each of the&s;e auxiliaries would hard|ly have found an hour's employment. But the &s;ecre|tary him&s;elf &s;ays, that Briti&s;h captures were not <HI>nu|merous.</HI> Be it &s;o. Then it would have taken the le&s;s time to make them out. Yet it &s;eems that, with a &s;pace of ten or twelve days before him, the &s;e|cretary could not accompli&s;h this Lilliputian ta&s;k.</P>
<P>Thus does our &s;ecretary trifle with the orders of the legi&s;lature; and Mr. Adams, by the acceptance of &s;o ab&s;urd an excu&s;e, exemplifies the proverb, <HI>like ma&s;ter, like man.</HI> But, to be plain with Mr. Picker|ing, &s;uch palpable &s;ophi&s;tication will not go down. All people know very well why the Briti&s;h li&s;t of captures was not made out. It would have coun|teract<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d his plan of inflaming us again&s;t the re|public. He proceeds thus.</P>
<P><Q>The editors of tho&s;e two gazettes agree in &s;aying, that no great attention was paid to the &s;ubject, for the purpo&s;e of in&s;erting accounts of all the captures which were publi&s;hed in the va|rious other new&s;papers; yet the number collec|ted exceeds three hundred, of which but few e&s;|cape condemnation.</Q> The Gazette of the Uni|ted States is, and long has been, as much an engine of the American executive, as that of London is to

an Engli&s;h premier<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In&s;tead of trying to turn the &s;peech of Barras into an in&s;trument for a French war, Mr. Adams might have bought a &s;et of this <HI>exe|cutive new&s;paper,</HI> and &s;ent it over as a pre&s;ent to the Directory at Paris. For every &s;yllable in the whole &s;peech of Barras, they would have found them&s;elves paid beforehand with a column of in|vective.</NOTE>. Mr. Fenno, beyond all que&s;|tion, in&s;erted every French capture that he could find. As to the Philadelphia Gazette, the pre&s;ent editor has only held it &s;ince la&s;t February; and, previous to that time, he knows not how it was conducted. When Congre&s;s wanted informa|tion, it was the duty of Mr. Pickering to have looked at a wide variety of new&s;papers. But he was well aware, that Mr. Fenno had collected about every thing of the kind. The object of Mr. Pickering is, to in&s;inuate that many French captures have e&s;caped notice. <HI>Yet the number collected ex|ceeds</HI> THREE HUNDRED. So long ago as September, 1794, a li&s;t was publi&s;hed, <HI>by authority,</HI> of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> captures. They were about three hundred and &s;ixty.</P>
<P><Q>The conduct of the public agents, &s;ays Mr. Pickering, and of the commi&s;&s;ioned crui&s;ers there, has &s;urpa&s;&s;ed <HI>all former examples</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pickering's report, p. 8.</NOTE>.</Q> They can|not be wor&s;e than the confi&s;cation of the Two Friends, and the murder of captain Bo&s;&s;on. We might add an hundred Briti&s;h piracies recited in this volume, all as atrocious as any po&s;&s;ible ca&s;e of French piracy.</P>
<P><Q>The per&s;ons al&s;o of our citizens have been beaten, in&s;ulted, and cruelly impri&s;oned; and, in the forms u&s;ed towards pri&s;oners of war, they have been exchanged with the Briti&s;h for French|men.</Q> This is very bad, but the French are only following the example that England, for above two years, had &s;et before them, and at this moment continues to give them. When complaints of im|pre&s;&s;ment
<PB N="238" REF="031906_0246_0FEF44FE9ABA6458">
were made again&s;t England, the federal party did their utmo&s;t to quell the &s;tory. In Con|gre&s;s, Mr. Tracy, and others, would gladly have de|nied that Briti&s;h impre&s;&s;ments had taken place, and Web&s;ter wondered why American printers &s;hould trouble them&s;elves about the matter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Supra, chapters v. and vi.</NOTE>. This was the uniform language of the whole party.</P>
<P><Q>There have been frequent accounts of at|tempts to effect condemnations by bribing the of|ficers and &s;eamen of our ve&s;&s;els to &s;wear fal&s;ely; but it was re&s;erved to the&s;e times, when offered bribes were refu&s;ed, and threats de&s;pi&s;ed, to en|deavour to accompli&s;h the object by <HI>torture.</HI></Q> Report p. 10. American &s;eamen have been flog|ged by dozens at a Briti&s;h gangway. This al&s;o was torture. Captain Reynolds, under the very no&s;e of admiral Murray, attacked American ve&s;&s;els. Several men were killed and wounded. This was torture. There is not the &s;malle&s;t de&s;ign to exten|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate French outrages, but merely to prove the gro&s;s partiality of our executive in &s;hewing only the rob|beries perpetrated upon one &s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>Paulo majora canamus.</HI> If Mr. Pickering has di&s;played gro&s;s partiality, Pre&s;ident Adams has not acted, in the &s;malle&s;t degree, better. On the 23d of June, 1797, general Smith was reciting in Congre&s;s the &s;teps pur&s;ued by the friends of order, for bring|ing about a French war. He &s;aid, that the execu|tive had called Congre&s;s, and had complained of the French; for the &s;peech did not contain a &s;ingle word of reference to any other nation. He next recommended the fitting out of frigates, with which he propo&s;ed to convoy American commerce. Our merchant &s;hips are to be armed, and, on arriving in a French port, the que&s;tion is put, <HI>again&s;t whom are
<PB N="239" REF="031906_0247_0FEF44BA95B13130">
you armed?</HI> The French would &s;ay, <HI>we have read your Pre&s;ident's &s;peech. By the&s;e preparations, he can only mean to fight us.</HI> Your envoys, arriving in France at the &s;ame time, are &s;ure of being turned back again. General Smith farther ob&s;erved, that Dr. Smith and Mr. Harper had avowed the de&s;ign of employing the frigates to force a trade into ports of the We&s;t-Indies which the French have ju&s;tly de|clared to be in a &s;tate of rebellion. Such was port Jeremie. General Smith affirmed, that the&s;e mea|&s;ures led directly to war. He believed that gentle|men <HI>wanted to lead us into war.</HI> The member was right; there can be no doubt of it. This a&s;toni&s;h|ing &s;e&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s hath afforded a whole dic|tionary of evidence. Sir John Brute &s;ays, <Q>every thing I &s;ee, every thing I hear, every thing I feel, and every thing I ta&s;te, methinks, has <HI>wife</HI> in it.</Q> So at pre&s;ent with the federal party, every thing has <HI>war</HI> in it. A combination more culpable, more hateful, hath not occurred &s;ince the age of Cataline or Fie&s;co.</P>
<P>Mr. Pickering complains of the French mal|treating American &s;eamen. His party have encou|raged the Briti&s;h to impre&s;s them. In proof of this, attend to general Smith, who is no violent demo|crat, for he profe&s;&s;ed in Congre&s;s great concern, when Mr. Hamilton retired from office. On the 27th of May, 1797, this gentleman &s;aid, in the hou&s;e, that members had affected to treat the law for the protection of our &s;eamen with lightne&s;s. It conferred the highe&s;t honour on Mr. Living&s;ton, who introduced it. It was oppo&s;ed in both hou&s;es by tho&s;e who are always combating for an increa&s;e of power and influence in the executive govern|ment. The Senate mutilated that law, &s;o as to de|prive it of its mo&s;t &s;alutary provi&s;ions. After all, <HI>the Senate refu&s;ed their a&s;&s;ent to a law for protecting
<PB N="240" REF="031906_0248_0FEF45522249BD90">
American &s;eamen from impre&s;&s;ment, and from being whipped on the bare back at the gang-way of a Bri|ti&s;h man of war. They refu&s;ed to adopt it, until it was &s;o much mutilated, that the executive, to render it in any &s;hape effectual, was obliged to enforce it with a &s;upplementary part.</HI> Thus far general Smith.</P>
<P>If this majority in the Senate had been &s;elected from the Divan of Algiers, they could not have more completely di&s;graced their &s;tation. At the &s;ame time, Me&s;&s;rs. Tracy and Harper, below &s;tairs, were attempting to deny the reality of Briti&s;h im|pre&s;&s;ments; and Web&s;ter and Ru&s;&s;el inveighed again&s;t every one who mentioned their exi&s;tence. The&s;e things are part of a &s;y&s;tem for degrading America into a Briti&s;h foot&s;tool. <HI>What kind of an</HI> AMERICAN <HI>Senate is that which refu&s;es its con&s;ent to a law for the protection of</HI> AMERICAN <HI>&s;eamen?</HI> The very idea looks &s;o mon&s;trous that one is apt to think him&s;elf in a dream when he endeavours to revolve it. The circum&s;tances of their refu&s;al to concur in the bill, &s;tand recorded on the journals of both hou&s;es. The full detail &s;hall &s;oon be given to the world. The journals of the Briti&s;h hou&s;e of peers afford no precedent for &s;uch horrible de|pravity. England has hitherto &s;tood upon her own legs. Her repre&s;entatives and legi&s;lators, though often extremely corrupted, have never been &s;u&s;|pected of &s;ervility to a foreign nation; and, a tri|vial in&s;tance excepted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the reign of Charles the &s;econd. See Sir John Dalrymple's Memoirs, and Hume's Hi&s;tory of England, in the late&s;t editions.</NOTE>, they have not put them|&s;elves up to auction for foreign gold. Their oppo|nents, at lea&s;t, have not alledged that they ever did &s;o; and this forms a &s;trong pre&s;umption of their innocence.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Harri&s;on Otis cants about French impre&s;&s;ments, and Mr. Harper on the cor|ruption
<PB N="241" REF="031906_0249_0FEF459FAF6B8AA8">
of Mr. Monroe, by French gold. For con|ceit and ignorance, Otis may be looked upon as the lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Samuel Dexter. As for Harper, he is &s;aid to be in embarra&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances; and, while he prattles about foreign gold, one might a&s;k him, who pays for the printing of his eternal pam|phlets<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>During the two la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ions, it is computed that this gentleman co&s;t the country at lea&s;t ten thou&s;and dollars worth of time, by ma|king &s;uperfluous motions, for the &s;ake of making u&s;ele&s;s &s;peeches about them. In the &s;e&s;&s;ion of December, 1796, he repeated one &s;peech, about augmenting the duties on imports, at four different times, in the cour&s;e of little more than a month.</P>
<P>He has a very pretty delivery, if any obliging friend would &s;up|ply him with a &s;uitable &s;tock of ideas. If he could be contented with repeating the &s;ame thoughts not oftener than five times in the cour&s;e of fifteen minutes, he would not &s;o barbarou&s;ly drive the members from their &s;eats, nor run him&s;elf into &s;o many &s;crapes with the &s;peaker, as to wandering from the que&s;tion. In an antedilu|vian Congre&s;s, when people lived to the age of a thou&s;and years, one might have found lei&s;ure for hearing him to an end. Our &s;pan of three&s;core and ten is too narrow for the torrent of his eloquence.</P></NOTE>? By land, our intere&s;t has been as gro&s;sly betrayed as by &s;ea. This appears from the di&s;cou|ragement con&s;tantly given to the defence of the Indian frontier. On that head, the following narra|tive will repay a peru&s;al.</P>
<P>On the 19th of November, 1794, Pre&s;ident Wa&s;hington, in his &s;peech to Congre&s;s, has the&s;e words. <Q>Towards none of the Indian tribes have overtures of friend&s;hip been &s;pared. The Creeks, in particular, are <HI>covered from encroachment</HI> by the interpo&s;ition of the general government, and that of Georgia.</Q> It would have been fortu|nate for the people of Tenne&s;&s;ee, if the general go|vernment had covered them from the encroachments of the Creeks. Re&s;pecting the behaviour of the Creeks, previous to the delivery of that &s;peech, in|formation for the pre&s;ent work has been derived from two &s;ources, the public new&s;papers, and a pri|vate
<PB N="242" REF="031906_0250_0FEF44BC50257028">
manu&s;cript communicated by Mr. Andrew Jack&s;on, Repre&s;entative from the &s;tate of Tenne&s;&s;ee in the fourth Congre&s;s. An examination of the&s;e details will a&s;&s;i&s;t in a&s;certaining what &s;ort of friend|&s;hip the Creeks de&s;erved, and to what &s;ide the ba|lance of protection ought to have leaned.</P>
<P>The account given in the new&s;papers amounts in &s;ub&s;tance to what follows. Continual &s;kirmi&s;hes had been taking place for a long time. In one of the&s;e, on the 13th of Augu&s;t, 1794, lieutenant M'Clellan, with thirty-&s;even men, had been attacked on the Cumberland path, eighteen miles from South-We&s;t-Point, by above an hundred Creeks. He had four men killed, and four mi&s;&s;ing. He likewi&s;e lo&s;t thirty-one hor&s;es, with &s;everal other articles. A multitude of murders by the Indians are mentioned. Of the&s;e, it would be needle&s;s here to attempt a ca|talogue. A letter from Knoxville, dated 22d of September, 1794, &s;ays, that the general a&s;&s;embly of Tenne&s;&s;ee had then been in &s;e&s;&s;ion for &s;everal weeks. They had prepared another memorial to Congre&s;s with a li&s;t of the citizens killed, wounded, or taken pri&s;oners by the Creeks and Cherokees, &s;ince the 1&s;t of March la&s;t, the date of a former &s;tatement to Congre&s;s. The number of citizens was an hun|dred and twenty-&s;even, be&s;ides which the Indians had &s;tolen four hundred and &s;eventy-four hor&s;es. The&s;e thefts and murders had been chiefly commit|ted while a party of the Lower Cherokees were at Philadelphia, giving the &s;tronge&s;t promi&s;es of peace, and while major Seagrove, an agent for Indian affairs, was making a&s;&s;urances of the friend&s;hip of the Creeks. The letter concludes with an account of &s;ome fre&s;h murders which had, at that moment, been received. They were &s;aid to have been com|mitted on the 16th of September current. Nicka|jack and Running Water were two of the mo&s;t po|pulous
<PB N="243" REF="031906_0251_0FEF45A6448420C0">
of the Lower Cherokee towns. They were &s;ituated clo&s;e on the &s;outh bank of the Tenne&s;&s;ee, below a place called the Suck. They were prin|cipal cro&s;&s;ing-places for the Creeks over the Ten|ne&s;&s;ee, when they wanted to make war on Cumber|land and Kentucky. They had co-operated with the warriors of Look-out Mountain, and Will's towns for &s;everal years pa&s;t. They boa&s;ted of per|fect &s;ecurity from their &s;ituation. They were &s;ur|rounded on three &s;ides by mountains, and protected on the north by the &s;outh branch of the Tenne&s;&s;ee. They were al&s;o formidable by their numbers.</P>
<P>On the 7th of September, major Ore marched from Na&s;hville to attack the &s;avages. He had with him five hundred and fifty militia, of whom an hundred and fifty were from Kentucky. They arri|ved on the bank of the Tenne&s;&s;ee, oppo&s;ite to Nicka|jack, and undi&s;covered, in the du&s;k of the evening. About eleven o'clock at night, a part of them cro&s;|&s;ed the river on rafts, and &s;urrounded the town, while another party lay in ambu&s;h on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river. The attack began about day break. Many of the &s;avages plunged, according to their cu&s;|tom, into the water, and having got almo&s;t to the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, the militia in re&s;erve ro&s;e from their covert, and di&s;charged a volley at the fugitives in the river. The victory was compleat. Nine &s;quaws and children were taken. About forty or forty-five warriors were killed. Accounts differ about their exact numbers. As no particular detail is offered a|bout Running Water, but barely that it was de&s;troy|ed at the &s;ame time with Nickajack, it &s;eems pro|bable that they &s;tood very near to each other. In the&s;e towns two fre&s;h &s;calps were found; and &s;e|veral others dry, that had been hung up as trophies. Many articles of property were recovered which the militia knew to have been taken from their owners
<PB N="244" REF="031906_0252_0FEF450205AD2000">
when killed by the Indians, in the cour&s;e of the pre|ceding twelve months. Among the&s;e were found a number of letters. They had been carried off when the Kentucky mail was robbed and the po&s;t murdered. In Nickajack was found a quantity of powder and lead, that had ju&s;t been received from the Spani&s;h government, as al&s;o a commi&s;&s;ion to Braeth, chief of the town, who was among the &s;lain.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oners confe&s;&s;ed that &s;ixty Creek and Che|rokee warriors had pa&s;&s;ed through Nickajack, only nine days before, on their way to make war again&s;t the United States. Two nights previous to the de|&s;truction of Running Water, a &s;calp dance was held in it. Among others, John Watts was pre&s;ent; and it was there re&s;olved to carry on the war with additional vigour. This the white people learned from the pri&s;oners. The towns were burnt, and every thing de&s;troyed. Such is the &s;ub&s;tance of the new&s;paper account. That received from Mr. Jack&s;on is to the following effect.</P>
<P>Major James Ore was, in the clo&s;e of Augu&s;t, 1794, ordered by governor Blount to march to the di&s;trict of Mero, to defend its frontier; and, on the 6th of September, was ordered, by general Ro|bert&s;on to march to the Lower Cherokee towns, and de&s;troy them.</P>
<P><Q>It is proper for me here to ob&s;erve, &s;ays Mr. Jack&s;on, that the Indians inhabiting tho&s;e towns were daily killing our citizens, and our officers, tran&s;mitting a <HI>Ro&s;trum</HI> of the captured, killed, and wounded to the &s;ecretary at war<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Henry Knox.</NOTE>; and the an&s;wers returned were, <HI>not to pur&s;ue on any ac|count acro&s;s the Indian boundary,</HI> or carry on any offen&s;ive mea&s;ures again&s;t the Indians; <HI>con&s;truing</HI> the word offen&s;ive to be an act of cro&s;&s;ing the
<PB N="245" REF="031906_0253_0FEF4542F9CBB720">
Indian boundary in the pur&s;uit of depredating parties.</Q></P>
<P>Major Ore obeyed the orders of general Robert|&s;on. He marched to Nickajack and Running Wa|ter, &s;wept them with the be&s;om of de&s;truction, and killed about thirty warriors. It is nece&s;&s;ary here to &s;tate &s;ome facts. The night before major Ore made the attack on Nickajack, the Indians held the &s;calp dance over two fre&s;h &s;calps, which they had taken on the frontier. Ore had pur&s;ued the track of this party. On the very day that he made the at|tack twenty-two Indians fell upon the &s;tation of the widow Hays, killed one man, and wounded three; and the evening before, they had burnt captain John Donel&s;on's &s;tation. At the time that general Robert&s;on i&s;&s;ued the order to Ore, he had infor|mation of an intended <HI>general</HI> attack, contemplated on that frontier. This was well &s;ub&s;tantiated, and the expedition of Ore was the only circum&s;tance which prevented it, and e&s;tabli&s;hed peace on the frontier.</P>
<P>The pay of the&s;e troops hath been &s;u&s;pended, be|cau&s;e they cro&s;&s;ed the Indian boundary, although they preci&s;ely pur&s;ued the orders given by ge|neral Robert&s;on. The mu&s;ter and pay roll's were, in the latter end of the year 1794, depo&s;ited with colonel David Henly, agent of the war de|partment at Knoxville. Governor Blount, in 1794, tran&s;mitted to Mr. Knox general Robert&s;on's or|der, authorizing and commanding the expedition, and on the 19th of December of that year this com|munication was laid before Congre&s;s. Yet though frequent applications have been made at the office of the &s;ecretary at war for payment, they have con|&s;tantly been refu&s;ed. After a delay of more than two years, Mr. Jack&s;on, in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of the fourth Congre&s;s, has applied to Mr Pickering to
<PB N="246" REF="031906_0254_0FEF4506531B4410">
recover the nece&s;&s;ary papers, that he might lay the &s;ubject before the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. <Q>I am informed by him, &s;ays Mr. Jack&s;on, that he knows <HI>nothing of the bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI></Q> Here the mat|ter &s;tood, on the 22d of February, 1797.</P>
<P>Mr. Jack&s;on further adds that this is not a &s;ingle in&s;tance. In 1794, major Thomas John&s;ton com|manded a party of Tenne&s;&s;ee militia who were or|dered to pur&s;ue a gang of Indians. The latter had murdered colonel John Montgomery, and the Tit&s;|worth family. In the pur&s;uit, they cro&s;&s;ed into the Kentucky territory. Colonel H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nly gave that rea|&s;on for &s;u&s;pending their pay. The&s;e were the on|ly two parties of Tenne&s;&s;ee militia, who&s;e arrears have not been paid up, excepting tho&s;e comprehen|ded in the appropriation act for 1797.</P>
<P>Many parts of the union lie beyond the reach of public information. The country new&s;papers are commonly very barren. To remedy this inconve|nience, &s;ome members of Congre&s;s &s;end printed circular letters to their con&s;tituents on the exi&s;ting condition of the political world. Mr. Samuel J. Cabell, of Virginia, tran&s;mitted two of &s;uch letters. One of them was dated the 11th, and the other the 23d of January, 1797. They contained nothing uncommon. They mentioned the brilliant and ir|re&s;i&s;tible progre&s;s of the French arms, the unfortu|nate chagrin which had taken place between France and the United States, and the deplorable con&s;equen|ces that would en&s;ue to this country from an actu|al rupture. Mr. Pickering's letter to Pinckney was referred to as more likely to promote than prevent a French quarrel. Mr. Cabell expre&s;&s;ed his regret at the election of Mr. Adams as Pre&s;ident, and ad|ded, as a con&s;olation, that of Mr. Jeffer&s;on.</P>
<P>On the 22d of May, 1797, judge Iredell, of the fe|deral court, delivered a charge at Richmond to the
<PB N="247" REF="031906_0255_0FEF4509432E25E0">
grand jury, for the di&s;trict of Virginia. It conveyed encomiums on the government, and a &s;trong recom|mendation of confidence in it. The jury immedi|ately gave in the following pre&s;entment.</P>
<P><Q>We, of the grand jury of the United States for the di&s;trict of Virginia, pre&s;ent, as a real evil, the circular letters of &s;everal members of the late Congre&s;s, and particularly letters with the &s;ignature of Samuel J. Cabell, endeavouring, at a time of real public danger, to di&s;&s;eminate un|founded calumnies again&s;t the happy government of the United States, and thereby to &s;eparate the people therefrom; and to increa&s;e or produce a foreign influence, ruinous to the peace, happi|ne&s;s, and independence of the&s;e United States.</Q></P>
<P>The jurors them&s;elves were evidently commit|ting calumny. The phra&s;e of <HI>&s;everal members</HI> was ca&s;ting their &s;tink-pot in the dark. As to Mr. Ca|bell, they &s;hould have &s;pecified the calumnies. When the grand jury of Chatham county, Georgia, arraigned judge Wil&s;on as a land-jobber, they con|de&s;cended on matters notoriou&s;ly true<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was upon the que&s;tionable evidence of this judge, that the pre&s;ident declared the four we&s;tern counties of Penn&s;ylvania to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> a &s;tate of in&s;urrection.</NOTE>. When a ci|tizen of Maryland cen&s;ures judge Cha&s;e, he begins with a hi&s;tory of the bankrupt law. If Mr. Cabell declared his di&s;&s;atisfaction at the election of Mr. Adams, one half of the American citizens were do|ing the &s;ame. This did not produce the &s;malle&s;t confu&s;ion or embarra&s;&s;ment on the &s;ide of govern|ment. It is unfortunate for the union, that Mr. Ca|bell had &s;o much foundation for regret. The out-&s;et of the new Pre&s;ident has been marked by an en|deavour to hurry his con&s;tituents into an unnece&s;|&s;ary war, while &s;ecretary Pickering has been wri|ting, and &s;ecretary Wolcot has been encouraging

<P>On the 31&s;t of May, 1797, Mr. Cabell &s;ent a third letter to his con&s;tituents. <Q>It has, &s;ays he, been a regular practice of the federal judges, to make political di&s;cour&s;es to the grand jurors.&mdash; They have become a band of political preachers.</Q> This is true, and their &s;ermons are often very dull.

There is a country where &s;peculators occupy, in part, the &s;u|preme bench of ju&s;tice. There, the a&s;&s;ertion of a public officer, who&s;e want of probity is proverbial, has been taken as complete evidence, that four coun|ties were in a &s;tate of rebellion. It would certain|ly be very wrong in a private citizen to conte&s;t the
<PB N="249" REF="031906_0257_0FEF450AF6B07148">
purity of &s;uch legi&s;lators. In a &s;ub&s;equent letter of June 5th, Mr. Cabell &s;ays, upon an a&s;&s;urance of the fact from general Smith, that the ju&s;t claims of America, for French depredations, do not exceed a million of dollars, and that the accuracy of his &s;tate|ment is confirmed by the pre&s;ident of the American In|&s;urance Company. In the Congre&s;s debates on Jay's treaty, dr. Ames computed Briti&s;h depredations at <HI>five</HI> millions, and the account hath &s;ince been augmented.</P>
<P>The federal party naturally wi&s;h to drive out of their way every man who dares to think for him|&s;elf. Thus Monroe was recalled from France be|cau&s;e, without orders from Mr. Wa&s;hington, he had obtained the relea&s;ement of Thomas Paine from the Luxembourg; and becau&s;e he had retained with the directory a degree of that confidence which Mr. Wa&s;hington had lo&s;t. Thus captain Montgomery, of one of the revenue cutters of this port, hath been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his office becau&s;e he voted for the Jeffer&s;on ticket.

Indeed no audible complaint has been made about it. Dr. William Smith, at the head of his regiment of forty, declined argument, and obtained a &s;ilent vote. Where any thing can be &s;aid, the doctor is not a niggard of accu&s;ation. <HI>That government who&s;e bread you have eaten,</HI> which has <HI>now ca&s;t you off.</HI> The bread was not eaten for nothing.

If government fear impediments from Mr. Beckley, their &s;ituation mu&s;t be very frail. That &s;omething is wrong will appear from what follows.</P>
<P>Alexander Hamilton calls it an <HI>abominable</HI> attempt in Reynolds to charge him with dealing in the pur|cha&s;e of certificates. Thus, by his own admi&s;&s;ion, the fact, if proved upon him, would be abomina|ble. Colonel Wad&s;worth &s;poke of it, as above quoted, exactly in the &s;ame way. But if this prac|tice was indefen&s;ible in a &s;ecretary of the trea&s;ury, it was ju&s;t as criminal in a member of Congre&s;s. There is no difference, or, if there be, the ca&s;e of the member differs for the wor&s;e. The &s;ecretary could only make a <HI>report</HI> in favour of funding the half-crown certificates at twenty &s;hillings. But the member <HI>voted</HI> for it. The one drew the &s;word; the other drove it up to the hilt. Hence, by a very &s;hort and plain proce&s;s of rea&s;oning, if one of our legi&s;lators was concerned in the&s;e &s;peculations, he committed an abominable crime. The heroes of the piece are &s;en&s;ible of this fact. Their conceal|ment of transfers at the trea&s;ury, and the bank of the United States of the names and amount of &s;tock|holders,
<PB N="252" REF="031906_0260_0FEF450E09442D58">
proves an irre&s;i&s;tible and di&s;graceful evidence of their internal condemnation. What are you to think of a per&s;on who calls him&s;elf your creditor, but refu&s;es to tell his name, or the amount of his debt? Such was the plan of the renowned leeches of the Nabob of Arcot. Bonds to an im|men&s;e &s;um were con&s;tantly produced, yet the ca|talogues of creditors con&s;tantly varied. This rule at the trea&s;ury is like the crape over a highwayman's face, or the dark lanthorn of a hou&s;e-breaker. The public creditors of England wear no &s;uch ma&s;k. Mr. Rayment printed their names to the number of an hundred and twenty-&s;even thou&s;and. When Ameri|cans begin to think upon this &s;ubject, they will re|fu&s;e to pay one cent more of intere&s;t upon the public funds, till they &s;hall have torn a&s;under the veil that &s;hrouds the &s;y&s;tem. To the great ma&s;s of the pre|&s;ent holders the di&s;covery would be indifferent or welcome. It is only the patriarchal, the congre&s;|&s;ional &s;harks of &s;tockholding, who can wi&s;h for mountains to cover them, the men who&s;e actions Me&s;&s;rs. Wad&s;worth and Hamilton, have, by the cleare&s;t implication, declared to be <HI>abominable.</HI> Mr. Adams, by the way, holds the funding &s;y&s;tem in ab|horrence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See particulars in the American Annual Regi&s;ter, chap. 6.</NOTE>, and he will put an end to it, if he can get into his French war. While Americans entru&s;t and admire &s;uch leaders, they di&s;play a <HI>temporal</HI> likene&s;s to the inhabitants of Neufchatel.

Though the number of &s;tockholding members is &s;pecified in the text, it appears, afterwards, to have been but a conjecture.

With &s;uch unexampled o&s;tentation of &s;ecrecy, there mu&s;t be &s;ome dirty &s;y&s;tem that needs concealment.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The great cry of the party is about <HI>the &s;acred na|ture of public faith,</HI> which they alledge to have con|&s;ummated by funding the dome&s;tic debt. This con&s;i&s;ted of arrears of pay due to the army, to con|tractors for &s;upplies, of loans made to government, and of the remnant of old paper money then in cir|culation. Now, we mu&s;t recollect, that, during the revolution, this country had been covered with emi&s;|&s;ions of paper. When the old Congre&s;s borrowed money, they took part of this paper back <HI>in loan,</HI> but not at the value for which they them&s;elves had i&s;&s;ued it out. They allowed credit only for what was its current price in the market. The difference was frequently as forty to one. Thus a farmer got four
<PB N="254" REF="031906_0262_0FEF4559A2AE8270">
thou&s;and dollars worth of government paper for his wheat. After the value of paper fell, he came to lend it to them, and they would only give him cre|dit for the fortieth part of its nominal value, being one hundred dollars. This &s;hocking fraud could be excu&s;ed only by the omnipotence of nece&s;&s;ity. But farther, <Q>a part of the paper remained unre|deemed at the clo&s;e of the war, and has been fun|ded at the rate of <HI>one hundred</HI> for <HI>one</HI> under the pre&s;ent government<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gallatin, p. 89.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Thus taking America for a merchant who has three creditors, one of them is paid with a fortieth, and a &s;econd with a hundredth part of the &s;um that he lent. A third receives full payment. But a debt contrac|ted ten years ago, and &s;till unpaid, is as fairly due as if it had been incurred but ye&s;terday. The cre|ditor of 1776, who was paid with one-tenth, twen|tieth, fortieth, or hundredth part of his ju&s;t claim, was quite as meritorious as the other of 1781, who&s;e debt has been bought up and funded, in the name of Theodore Sedgwick, at twenty &s;hillings in the pound. A brief con&s;ideration will convince you, that this po&s;ition agrees with the e&s;&s;ence of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>If the continent had been &s;old by an hour gla&s;s, its utmo&s;t value would perhaps have fallen &s;hort of &s;atisfaction to the hone&s;t demands of public creditors. The greater part of the United States had been &s;windled or plundered to a degree that exceeds the de&s;criptive talents of the mo&s;t powerful mind. Funds could not be had to &s;atisfy all the creditors, or even a twentieth part of them. It remains, there|fore, to be proved what was the <HI>&s;uperior</HI> merit of that cla&s;s of creditors, who&s;e claims were ultimately admitted, at their full value, as a debt on the pub|lic. The common &s;aying is, that they were <HI>old &s;ol|diers.</HI>
<PB N="255" REF="031906_0263_0FEF44C44BC06C40">
A great number of them were &s;o, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t merit. A large portion of certifi|cates was al&s;o held by contractors, and per&s;ons who had furni&s;hed various kinds of &s;upplies, but who were not in the army. The country was full of widows and orphans, who&s;e fathers and hu&s;bands had been killed in the war, and who, to this day, have received no compen&s;ation. Multi|tudes of &s;oldiers had been al&s;o di&s;charged from want of health, or from wounds, and who in equity, though not perhaps in name, were creditors to the public. Hence, if it had been po&s;&s;ible to clear off all the la&s;t cla&s;s of creditors, they were not more de&s;erving than a &s;till greater proportion of military &s;ufferers who got nothing. The whole hi&s;tory of American public credit, during the war, holds up a picture of inevitable but enormous iniquity. Three-fourths of the citizens of the United States were, in real truth, creditors to government. The lo&s;s by de|preciated paper was prodigious and next to univer|&s;al. If it could have been po&s;&s;ible to pick out all the &s;oldiers or their families, and give them a higher proportion of payment than others, it would have been well. But to give one part of them their whole demand, and nothing to the re&s;t, was not &s;trict ju&s;tice. The widow and orphan of one old &s;oldier were actually taxed to pay the wages of ano|ther. When the federal party clamour &s;o loudly on public faith, let them revolve the&s;e particulars. Let them look at the annual bundles of petitions refer|red to the committee of claims, and then they may blu&s;h at the very mention of American <HI>public faith.</HI></P>
<P>Some perhaps think that the friends of order have been treated with too little ceremony in point of of &s;tile. Ob&s;erve a few &s;pecimens of their own. Mr. Fenno's gazette, of the 26th of April, 1796, con|tains a piece wherein the members of Congre&s;s who
<PB N="256" REF="031906_0264_0FEF4517B74CB530">
oppo&s;ed the treaty, are termed the <HI>war-whoop party.</HI> If they carry their point, <Q><HI>it will</HI> murder all your li|berties, privileges and properties.</Q> Again, refer|ring to Mr. Albert Gallatin, <Q>Let the mighty Ita|lian, with his &s;tilletto and bowl of poi&s;on come on.</Q> This piece concludes with &s;aying that the Ameri|cans de&s;pi&s;e all <HI>incendiaries;</HI> and it is &s;ub&s;cribed ORDER.</P>
<P>An extract of a letter in the &s;ame new&s;paper has the following words. <Q>I want to know how Madi|&s;on has accounted for his <HI>incon&s;i&s;tency</HI> and <HI>dupli|city</HI> of conduct. How long will the people of America be <HI>duped</HI> by this man.</Q></P>
<P>The fir&s;t que&s;tion to be here a&s;ked is, whether &s;uch <HI>incon&s;i&s;tency</HI> and <HI>duplicity</HI> exi&s;t? No details are attempted, and no evidences are offered. There never was an active and di&s;tingui&s;hed member in any legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly, farther above impeachment than Mr. Madi&s;on. The marked attention which this gentleman obtained in Congre&s;s, is a tribute of e&s;teem which all parties pay not more to his abilities than his virtues, to the irreproachable tenor of a life, that, &s;ince his fir&s;t entrance on the political career, has remained without a &s;tain, and which is far above the ordure of Mr. Fenno's corre&s;pondents.</P>
<P>As for the de&s;truction of privileges and proper|ties, no party ever di&s;played greater tamene&s;s on that head than the Hamiltonians. After the Briti&s;h had, for, many months, been capturing American ve&s;&s;els without provocation, and almo&s;t without pre|tence, the Repre&s;entatives, on the 21&s;t of April, 1795, pa&s;t a re&s;olution prohibiting, from and after the 1&s;t of November then next, <Q>all commercial intercour&s;e between the United States and the &s;ub|jects of Britain, or the citizens or &s;ubjects of any other nation, &s;o far as re&s;pects articles of <HI>the growth or manufacture of Britain or Ireland.</HI></Q>
<PB N="257" REF="031906_0265_0FEF45A7E8A88DD8">
This would have been a mo&s;t effectual blow to Bri|ti&s;h commerce; and, as &s;ix months were to inter|vene before the commencement of its operation, full time would have been given for a mutual explana|tion and compromi&s;e. The Briti&s;h majority in the Se|nate of Congre&s;s rejected this propo&s;al, &s;o cheap, &s;o &s;imple, and &s;o deci&s;ive. Jay, that executioner of his country, was, at the &s;ame time, di&s;patched to Britain. He there, by a clau&s;e of the treaty, tied up the hands of America, and de&s;troyed all chance of adopting &s;uch a re&s;ource in future. The fifteenth ar|ticle has the&s;e words. <Q>Nor &s;hall any prohibition be impo&s;ed on the exportation or importation of any articles to or from the territories of the two nations re&s;pectively, which &s;hall not <HI>equally</HI> extend to all other nations.</Q> Thus we cannot prohibit the importation of Engli&s;h manufactures, without al&s;o prohibiting tho&s;e of <HI>all other nations;</HI> and that is impracticable.</P>
<P>This article has the appearance of reciprocity, but not the &s;ub&s;tance. Suppo&s;ing that England &s;hould entirely prohibit all intercour&s;e with this country, her lo&s;s would be an hundred times greater than ours. The de&s;olation of her We&s;t-In|dies would be the fir&s;t con&s;equence, and a general bankruptcy among her We&s;t-Indian merchants, and her manufacturers for the American market, would be the &s;econd. On the contrary, the inconvenience and lo&s;s to the United States would be very &s;up|portable. We &s;hould begin to manufacture more among our&s;elves. American produce would &s;oon find other markets. Other nations would learn to &s;upply our wants, while the arti&s;ts of England would croud over to this country in que&s;t of employment. More commmanding ground could not be de&s;ired. Yet Jay jumped from his eminence to waddle in the &s;lough of pretended reciprocity, to betray every principle of official tru&s;t, and to trample on every a|tom

<P>While the re&s;olution of the 21&s;t of April, 1794, was under debate, and frequently before that time, in the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ion, the gentlemen on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the que&s;tion, &s;aid that the Briti&s;h would not feel the want of our commerce, becau&s;e the three milli|ons &s;terling of exports from Britain to North-Ame|rica, formed only one-&s;ixth part of her total exports. This rea&s;oning re&s;embled that of &s;uppo&s;ing, that a per&s;on worth &s;ix thou&s;and dollars, will not regret the lo&s;s of one thou&s;and, becau&s;e he has five times that number behind; or, if you will, that a man would not feel the amputation of one of his fingers, if the other &s;even are &s;afe and &s;ound. Another circum&s;tance mu&s;t be attended to. One-half of the commerce of Britain had been de&s;troyed by the ra|vages of the French war, &s;o that the lo&s;s of Ameri|can commerce would then have been equal to the annihilation of one third or fourth part of her whole foreign trade.</P>
<P>What effect the&s;e re&s;olutions, if adopted, were likely to produce in Britain, may be perfectly a&s;cer|tained upon the authority of Dr. Adam Smith, who was, on a point of this kind, a judge above excepti|on. The pa&s;&s;age now to be quoted, is of con&s;iderable length, but it &s;erves to illu&s;trate the pre&s;ent &s;ubject

&s;o completely, that an apology would be unnece&s;&s;a|ry for its in&s;ertion. After de&s;cribing &s;ome of the numerous inconveniences which Britain met with, in attempting to monopolize the commerce of her North-American colonies, the doctor proceeds thus:</P>
<P><Q>Her commerce, in&s;tead of running in a great number of &s;mall channels, has been taught to run principally in one great channel. But the whole &s;y&s;tem of her indu&s;try and commerce has thereby been rendered le&s;s &s;ecure; the whole &s;tate of her body politic le&s;s healthful, than it otherwi&s;e would have been. In her pre&s;ent condition, Britain re&s;em|bles one of tho&s;e unwhole&s;ome bodies, in which &s;ome of the vital parts are overgrown, and which, upon that account, are liable to many dangerous di&s;orders, &s;carce incident to tho&s;e in which all the parts are more properly proportioned. A &s;mall &s;top in that great blood-ve&s;&s;el which has been artifici|ally &s;welled beyond its natural dimen&s;ions, and through which an unnatural proportion of the indu&s;try and commerce of the country has been forced to circulate, is very likely to bring on the mo&s;t dangerous di&s;orders upon the whole body politic. The expectation of <HI>a rupture with the colonies,</HI> ac|cordingly, has &s;truck the people of Britain with more terror than they ever felt <HI>for a Spani&s;h armuda, or a French inva|&s;ion.</HI> It was this terror, whether well or ill-grounded, which rendered <HI>the repeal of the &s;tamp act,</HI> among the merchants, at lea&s;t, a popular mea&s;ure. In a total exclu&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the co|lony market, was it to la&s;t only for a few years, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> greater part of our merchants u&s;ed to fancy that they fore&s;aw <HI>an en|tire &s;top to their trade;</HI> the greater part of our ma&s;ter ma|nufacturers, <HI>the entire ruin of their bu&s;ine&s;s;</HI> and the grea|ter part of our workmen, <HI>an end of their employment.</HI> A rupture with any of our neighbours upon the continent, though likely too to occa&s;ion &s;ome &s;top or interruption in the employment of &s;ome of all the&s;e different orders of peo|ple, is fore&s;een, however, without any &s;uch general emotion. The blood, of which the circulation is &s;topt in &s;ome of the &s;maller ve&s;&s;els, ea&s;ily di&s;gorges it&s;elf into the greater, with|out occa&s;ioning any dangerous di&s;order; but, when it is &s;topt in any of the greater ve&s;&s;els, convul&s;ions, apoplexy, or death, are the immediate and unavoidable con&s;equences. If but one of the&s;e overgrown manufactures, which by means either of bounties or of the monopoly of the home and colo|ny

<P>In de&s;pite of this overwhelming narrative, mem|bers of Congre&s;s could &s;tand up and make &s;peeches, by the hour, to prove, that an interruption of her commerce with America would not be &s;eriou&s;ly re|garded by Britain. If &s;he was &s;o deeply afraid of America in 1766, when victorious, and at peace with all the world, her alarm would, of cour&s;e, be va&s;tly greater in 1794, when her public debt had doubled &s;ince the former time; when her ar|mies on the continent were extirpated; when her manufacturing cla&s;&s;es were already &s;tarving by thou&s;ands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A letter from a merchant in Manche&s;ter to his friend in this city, written about that time, ob&s;erved, that, <HI>if it was not for America, they would have wanted</HI> BREAD TO THEIR MOUTHS.</NOTE>; and when her trade to the United States was computed to be at twice the amount of what it had been twenty years before. This turn of circum&s;tances went directly in favour of America. In 1766, England was more deeply alarmed than &s;he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">een by the Spani&s;h armada. In 1794, her tremor would have been ten times greater, as a man dipt up to the chin, &s;tands in more hazard of drowning, than when the &s;tream only wets his ancle.</P>
<P>The exports from Britain to America, were, in 1794, about three millions &s;terling<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">On the 18th of April, 1796, Pitt &s;aid, in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, that the total exports of Britain, amounted to twenty-four millions &s;terling; and in 1795, to twenty-&s;even millions, two hun|dred and &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds &s;terling.</NOTE>; being, as above &s;tated, equal to about a &s;ixth part of her ex|ported manufactures. Let us &s;uppo&s;e that every
<PB N="261" REF="031906_0269_0FEF44C76C9D7688">
manufacturer in Britain requires fifteen pounds &s;ter|ling per annum to &s;upport him; and that one-half of the price of the commodities exported from Bri|tain to America con&s;i&s;ts in the wages of their la|bour. Here then we have ab&s;tracted from the fund of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for the labouring part of the people of Britain, ONE MILLION AND FIVE HUNDRED THOU|SAND POUNDS STERLING. Of the&s;e manufacturers, a con&s;iderable number mu&s;t be married, and have families of children. It may &s;eem &s;trange in Ame|rica, but it is ab&s;olutely true, that in Britain, or at lea&s;t in Scotland, a journeyman manufacturer has rai&s;ed his family on &s;ix &s;hillings &s;terling a week, which is only fifteen pounds twelve &s;hillings per annum. Let us compute then that one-fourth part of the hundred thou&s;and manufacturers above &s;ta|ted, are married, and that each has three children. This e&s;timate gives us two hundred thou&s;and peo|ple reduced to beggary at a &s;ingle &s;troke. We mu&s;t likewi&s;e take into the account, that many thou&s;ands of Briti&s;h trade&s;men depend entirely for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence upon the cu&s;tom of tho&s;e two hun|dred thou&s;and people; &s;o that the whole number deprived of employment may be conjectured at two hundred and fifty thou&s;and. To this we mu&s;t add the de&s;truction of revenue, the confu&s;ion, alarm, and bankruptcy of merchants, and the fall of the &s;tocks, which mu&s;t be the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;e|quence, and then let any body &s;ay, whether the lo&s;s of the commerce of America mu&s;t not be a ve|ry &s;erious object to Britain.</P>
<P>This act, prohibiting the importation of Briti&s;h goods, was lo&s;t in the Senate, by the ca&s;ting vote of Mr. John Adams. All the advantages that it would have produced, have been thrown away, and all the mi&s;chiefs attending Jay's treaty have been ori|ginally cau&s;ed by the fatal rejection of the vice-pre&s;ident.
<PB N="262" REF="031906_0270_0FEF44C936BA8750">
The advocates again&s;t the prohibition di&s;covered a great want of information, of inte|grity, or of judgment. There cannot be a plain|er po&s;ition than that now before us. Adam Smith was, perhaps, the be&s;t informed political writer that Britain ever had. He affirmed, that an exclu|&s;ion from the United States would affright her more effectually than a Spani&s;h armada, or a French in|va&s;ion. The Adamites denied all this; and their ignorance, their factious &s;pirit, or their treachery, has co&s;t American trade at lea&s;t &s;even or eight mil|lions of dollars. The con&s;tant cry was, that the Briti&s;h would declare war. Some weeks before that time, when Madi&s;on's re&s;olutions were deba|ted, general Smith a&s;ked one of the&s;e bawlers, what made him apprehen&s;ive that England would attack us? He replied, that he had no apprehen|&s;ions of &s;uch a thing, but &s;ome of his neighbours were afraid of it, and he <HI>wanted to plea&s;e them.</HI> General Smith told this in Congre&s;s, on the 27th of May, 1797. This would be one of tho&s;e impo&s;|tors who went home and told their con&s;tituents, that Madi&s;on wanted to de&s;troy the government.</P>
<P>Among the ridiculous arguments advanced in Congre&s;s for accepting the Briti&s;h treaty, one was, that it would prevent the renewal of an Indian war. On the 29th of April, 1796, Mr. Dayton &s;aid, that, by rejecting Jay's treaty, it <Q>might be calculated upon as <HI>inevitable,</HI> and the con&s;equent expendi|ture of fourteen hundred thou&s;and dollars annu|ally; but in carrying the treaty into effect, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the (We&s;tern) po&s;ts with the troops, they &s;hould be free from any danger of a &s;erious rupture with the &s;avages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bache's Debates, vol. ii. p. 347.</NOTE>.</Q> That the We&s;tern
<PB N="263" REF="031906_0271_0FEF44CC006D3120">
po&s;ts would firmly bridle the Indians, was, at that time, a received opinion.</P>
<P>Dr. Ames took up the &s;ubject in a higher &s;train. The tories were ready to &s;pit in any man's face who did not admire his &s;peech on that occa&s;ion. On the Indian war, he &s;ets out as follows:</P>
<Q><P>On this theme, my emotions are unutterable: if I could find words for them, if my powers bore any proportion to my zeal, I would &s;well my voice to &s;uch a note of remon&s;trance, it &s;hould reach every log-hou&s;e beyond the mountains. I would &s;ay to the inhabitants, wake you from your fal&s;e &s;ecurity. Your cruel dangers, your more cru|el apprehen&s;ions are &s;oon to be renewed: the wounds, yet unhealed, are to be torn open again. In the day time, your path through the woods will be ambu&s;hed. The darkne&s;s of midnight will glitter with the blaze of your dwellings. &mdash;You are a father&mdash;the blood of your &s;ons &s;hall fatten your cornfield.&mdash;You are a mother&mdash; the war-whoop &s;hall wake the &s;leep of the cradle. On this &s;ubject, you need not &s;u&s;pect any decep|tion on your feelings. It is a &s;pectacle of horror which cannot be over drawn. If you have nature in your hearts, it will &s;peak a language compa|red with which all I have &s;aid or can &s;ay, will be poor and frigid.</P>
<P>Will it be whi&s;pered that the treaty has made me a new champion for the protection of the fron|tiers? It is known that my voice as well as vote have been uniformly given in conformity with the ideas I have expre&s;&s;ed. Protection is the right of the frontiers; it is our duty to give it.</P></Q>
<P>All this is very fine. The conclu&s;ion implies an internal doubt in the mind of the orator that he was liable to the cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge of incon&s;i&s;tency. Indeed, on the 6th of June, 1794, Dr. Ames &s;poke thus, in
<PB N="264" REF="031906_0272_0FEF45475DC3EF20">
Congre&s;s: <Q>I am not one of tho&s;e who think that there are too many Indians, any more than too many wild bea&s;ts. The one may, by &s;kilful ma|nagement, be rendered as harmle&s;s as the other.</Q> In 1794, when the doctor u&s;ed this language, he thought only of injuries that Indians have &s;uf|fered from white people. In April, 1796, he thought only of injuries that white people &s;uffer from Indians. In the latter in&s;tance, Dr. Ames proved more than he fore&s;aw. A refu&s;al to appro|priate would not have ju&s;tified England in breaking the peace of 1783; and hence her &s;timulating the &s;avages to murder, would have been an act of the blacke&s;t perfidy. The doctor looked upon this con&s;equence as certain. Jacobini&s;m can do no|thing wor&s;e. This proves the folly of thinking Frenchmen more barbarous than Britons. The doctor &s;ays, that <Q>his voice as well as vote has been <HI>uniform.</HI></Q> NO. He was an advocate for that &s;y&s;tem, which ended with refu&s;ing payment to the militia of Tenne&s;&s;ee, for having done their du|ty. Yet the capture of Nickajack was nearly as important as Wayne's victory on the banks of the Miamis. Of the former, nobody &s;peaks. For the latter, America has rung with exultation.</P>
<P>Again, if the Indians are ready to break a trea|ty, when a governor of Canada <HI>&s;hall bid them</HI> do &s;o, we have certainly <HI>too many</HI> of &s;uch neighbours, and &s;y&s;tematic treachery makes it hardly worth while to negociate with them. This picture of per&s;idy does not agree with what Dr. Ames had &s;aid only a few minutes before. <Q>I &s;ee no excep|tion to the re&s;pect that is paid among nations to the law of <HI>good faith.</HI> If there are ca&s;es in this <HI>enlightened</HI> period when it is violated, there are none where it is decried. It is the philo&s;ophy of politics, the religion of governments. It is
<PB N="265" REF="031906_0273_0FEF32B84693CEB0">
ob&s;erved by barbarians. A whiff of tobacco-&s;moke, or a &s;tring of beads, gives not merely binding force, but <HI>&s;anctity</HI> to treaties.</Q></P>
<P>By the &s;ub&s;equent account of the gentleman him|&s;elf, the beads and tobacco were both to be for|gotten at the nod of England. <HI>No exception to the re&s;pect to the law of good faith!</HI> Modern hi&s;tory is as full as it can be of the violation of good faith. The Briti&s;h orders of the 8th of June, and 6th of November, 1793, and 8th of January, 1794, were all breaches of treaty. The extravagance of the or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r's &s;tyle is too evident for detection. He then puts the &s;uppo&s;ition that England <Q>refu&s;es to ex|ecute the treaty, after we have done every thing to carry it into effect.&mdash;What would you &s;ay, or rather what would you not &s;ay?</Q> He then, in a &s;train of lofty declamation, tells what might be &s;aid! The only remark worth making would be that <HI>a blackamoor cannot ea&s;ily wa&s;h him&s;elf white;</HI> and that no man ver&s;ant in hi&s;tory would feel &s;ur|prize at &s;uch national ba&s;ene&s;s. Dr. Ames makes repeated reference to the &s;tates of Barbary, as <HI>un|&s;u&s;pected</HI> of breaking treaties. <HI>A &s;hort hi&s;tory of Algiers,</HI> printed &s;ome years ago by Mr. Mathew Carey, will give him a precious catalogue of &s;uch matters. Jay's treaty it&s;elf is regarded by the French as a violation of our treaty with them. The remarks on this &s;peech may be &s;hortened, for the treaty has <HI>de facto</HI> died. This can be proved in a few words.</P>
<P><Q>There is no po&s;ition better &s;ettled, than that the breach of <HI>any</HI> article of a treaty by one par|ty, gives the other an option to con&s;ider the <HI>whole</HI> treaty as annulled<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camillus, No. viii.</NOTE>.</Q> Now, as England is on the verge of a general bankruptcy, our merchants
<PB N="266" REF="031906_0274_0FEF324A5EDBD378">
have no chance to recover their five millions of dol|lars. This was the temptation for accepting the treaty; and, when that vi&s;ion has vani&s;hed, Con|gre&s;s, by the admi&s;&s;ion of Camillus him&s;elf, are at liberty to declare it void. They could do nothing better.</P>
<P>His maje&s;ty's mo&s;t faithful &s;ubjects in Philadel|phia toil hard to prove that England will recover her credit. The pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s hath not come of a &s;udden. In April, 1796, a committee of mer|chants waited on Mr. Pitt. At this interview it came out that the bank of England had advanced fourteen millions &s;terling for government, Sixteen millions &s;terling of ca&s;h and bullion had, within three years, been exported from the kingdom. Gambling in the funds had been excited by Pitt's exorbitant premiums to &s;uch a pitch, that twenty, thirty, and forty per cent were given for money to carry it on. Manufacturers or merchants could no longer borrow money at five per cent, &s;o that &s;o|ber trade was not to be &s;upported. All the&s;e were the &s;tronge&s;t cau&s;es and &s;ymptoms which could be conceived of approaching ruin. France hath only to re&s;t on her arms, to exclude, as &s;he hath done, Engli&s;h commerce from almo&s;t every port in Eu|rope, and then to permit England to proceed with an annual loan of twenty millions &s;terling. Hence it is of little concern whether Britain profe&s;&s;edly &s;tops payment in this year or the next. The event is certain. The delay is but like a fortnight's re&s;|pite from the gibbet. The predictions of Gerald and Palmer have not been long unfulfilled; nor have their wrongs been long unavenged.</P>
<P>Recurring to Dr. Ames, we can now an&s;wer one of his queries. <Q>The articles &s;tipulating the redre&s;s of our injuries by captures, are &s;aid to be delu&s;ive. <HI>By whom is this &s;aid?</HI></Q> By every body</P>

He was <HI>willing to fraternize with tho&s;e emigrants who might be admitted among us now,</HI> but he wi&s;hed a bar placed to further migrations, and he did not think twenty dollars too much.</Q></P>
<P>The term of <HI>wild,</HI> as here applied exclu&s;ively to Iri&s;hmen, is highly impertinent. In tho&s;e parts of Ireland where the peace and property of the &s;ubjects have formerly been protected, the ge|neral ca&s;t of manners was fully as good as that in New-England. A great body of the peo|ple were however kept in a &s;tate of ince&s;&s;ant ir|ritation by the pre&s;&s;ure of their landed ari&s;tocracy, and their blood-&s;ucking church of England hierar|chy. Of the&s;e unfortunate victims it would be un|fair to e&s;timate the morals, till they &s;hall enjoy a political &s;y&s;tem, whereby indu&s;try is encouraged, and property &s;ecured. Fortune has never &s;ported more cruelly, than by &s;ubjecting that ho&s;pitable and generous nation to the monopolizing jealou&s;y, and the &s;y&s;tematic barbarity of an Engli&s;h parlia|ment. An Iri&s;h revolution is now expected, and in its triumphant i&s;&s;ue, Ireland, &s;purning the yoke of hereditary tyrants, will a&s;&s;ume her proper rank and dignity among the powers of Europe.</P>

They wantonly de&s;troyed three hundred and forty-two che&s;ts of tea, in pre&s;ence, and with the approbation of an immen&s;e crowd of &s;pectators. The act of parliament for &s;hutting up the port of Bo&s;ton, was the natural and &s;uitable con&s;equence of that &s;hameful tran&s;action. The burning of the Ga&s;pee &s;chooner, at Providence, in Rhode-I&s;land, becau&s;e it ob&s;tructed &s;muggling, was another wan|ton outrage, that mu&s;t be reprobated by every man who is fit for living under a civilized government. The whole continent was dragged prematurely into war, to &s;ave the factious town&s;men of Bo&s;ton from a cha&s;ti&s;ement that &s;ome of them very highly de&s;erved. The friends of America in England, could no longer defend their proceedings. The cau&s;e of liberty was di&s;graced and injured by the unbecoming in&s;olence of its advocates. The town&s;|men of Belfa&s;t have invaded no man's property. The burden of actual oppre&s;&s;ion cru&s;hes them to the earth. The wrongs of America were chiefly in im|agination. She was more lightly taxed than any other country in the world. If the people of New-England had behaved with equal moderation and dignity as tho&s;e of Virginia, it is likely enough that we might &s;till have been Briti&s;h colonies, and in a happy &s;ituation, without any revolution at all. When once the conte&s;t had begun, there could be no medium between independence and &s;lavery, but that does not le&s;&s;en the extreme want of &s;en&s;e and hone&s;ty in burning the tea. It very ill becomes &s;uch people to rail at reformers in Europe. The whole &s;peech proves that Mr. Otis is unworthy even to re&s;ide in a free country, and infinitely more &s;o to re|pre&s;ent

it. Nature intended him for a keeper of the Conciergerie, or a led captain to &s;ome prince of Wales. After all, Otis only betrayed the real &s;enti|ments of his who&s;e party; and under &s;uch leaders, we cannot wonder at the contemptible and pitiable fi|gure which the United States do at pre&s;ent make.</P>
<P>The unexpected length to which &s;ome articles in this volume are found to extend, has of nece&s;&s;ity prevented the publication of others. This devia|tion from the fir&s;t de&s;ign is more fully explained in the preface. The following mi&s;cellaneous remarks have, however, been in&s;erted, as a relief to the rea|der from the &s;amene&s;s of political details. They refer to &s;ubjects of univer&s;al intere&s;t, and which, in the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive manner, demand reforma|tion.</P>
<P>On Saturday, the 12th of March, 1796, two &s;tage coaches, &s;et out at &s;ix o'clock in the morning, from Frenchtown for Newca&s;tle. The di&s;tance is only &s;eventeen miles, and yet the drivers did not reach the latter place till twelve o'clock. They took &s;ix hours to travel a &s;pace, which a healthy, ac|tive man would have walked over with ea&s;e, in four and an half. The road through which the coaches had to go, was very tole|rable. One of the drivers, when near Newca&s;tle, attempted a kind of quicker pace than u&s;ual. The wretched harne&s;&s;ing in&s;tantly gave way; the two foremo&s;t hor&s;es broke loo&s;e, and &s;et off at full gallop: one of them was near breaking his neck.</P>
<P>When the pa&s;&s;engers arrived at Newca&s;tle, the wind was fair, the tide was making, and the boat for Philadelphia was ready and waiting; yet they were detained an hour and an half. The only conceivable rea&s;on for this delay was, that <HI>the innkeeper might &s;crub the pa&s;&s;engers out of the price of a dinner.</HI></P>
<P>At la&s;t the boat got off, and with a fair wind came up within le&s;s than two miles of Glouce&s;ter point; but the wind and tide failing, the ve&s;&s;el was obliged to come to anchor. If &s;he had left Newca&s;tle but an hour more early, &s;he might have come with ea&s;e to the wharf at Che&s;nut-&s;treet, by &s;ix o'clock in the evening.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="031906_0280_0FEF455B3ABF2770">Seven or eight of the pa&s;&s;engers, who were anxious to get for|ward, were obliged to pay half-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">-dollar each to the &s;ailors to row them a&s;hore. If the owners of the&s;e boats are capable of &s;hame, which is extremely doubtful, they mu&s;t blu&s;h at &s;uch multiplied in&s;tances of negligence, in&s;olence and extortion.</P>
<P>Another tide was expected to begin about one o'clock in the morning. The ma&s;ter, who&s;e name is Mitchell, &s;ate up, drinking grog, playing at cards with &s;ome pa&s;&s;engers, and making an intolerable noi&s;e, till the hour above-mentioned; he then went to bed.

<HEAD>Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Philadelphia, to his friend in Baltimore, dated <DATE>25th of April, <HI>1796.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>In the Maryland Journal of the 28th of March la&s;t, I ob|&s;erve an account of an expedition from Frenchtown to New|ca&s;tle in the &s;tage coach, and from the latter place to Philadel|phia by the &s;tage boat. The writer complains that the coach took &s;ix hours to drive &s;eventeen miles over a tolerable road; that the boat &s;pent <HI>twenty-eight</HI> hours on a voyage up the De|laware, which might have been ended in <HI>&s;ix</HI> hours; that Mitchell, the ma&s;ter of the boat, got drunk; that his &s;ailors fleeced &s;ome of the pa&s;&s;engers, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>This malcontent mu&s;t undoubtedly be a foreigner, other|wi&s;e he never would have attempted to grumble, for two &s;olid rea&s;ons. Fir&s;t, becau&s;e, with a few exceptions, brutality, negligence and filching, are as naturally expected by people ac|cu&s;tomed to travelling in America, as a mouth, a no&s;e, and two eyes, are looked for in a man's face. Secondly, becau&s;e legal redre&s;s, and individual reformation, are equally hopele&s;s. The
<PB N="273" REF="031906_0281_0FEF4525DCD6EB58">
former would require &s;uch a wa&s;te of time and money, with &s;o extreme an uncertainty of the i&s;&s;ue, that no per&s;on of common prudence ever thinks of it. As for the &s;econd, there are excep|tions, both as to landlords and drivers, between this place and Baltimore; and others may be found in different parts of the country. But the blanks in this lottery are more numerous than the prizes; and to hope reformation or amendment of cha|racter, among the worthle&s;s, would be the mo&s;t vi&s;ionary of all vi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Thus &s;tanding the ca&s;e, this gentleman, in&s;tead of grumbling, &s;hould rather be very thankful to have rode from Frenchtown to Newca&s;tle, without getting his limbs broke, and his trunk, if he had one with him, &s;hattered to pieces, or pitched a yard deep into the mire. Mitchell, the boatman from Newca&s;tle to Philadelphia, did not endanger the lives of his pa&s;&s;engers. He only kept them about five times longer than was nece&s;&s;ary on the water. If his &s;ailors took half-a-dollar a piece for row|ing &s;ome of the pa&s;&s;engers on &s;hore, they &s;hould have been ve|ry grateful that the boat was not over&s;et. Permit me to relate &s;ome of my own trials and troubles of this nature.</P>
<P>In June 1794, I had occa&s;ion to go to New-York. Two rival coaches came near the town of Brun&s;wick, at the &s;ame time. The one in which I was, got the &s;tart of the other by a few yards; and entered the town at full gallop. I expected every moment when the coach would break down, or &s;ome of the hor&s;es fall dead under the fatigue. Mo&s;t of our pa&s;&s;engers were as fond of this triumph as the driver him&s;elf, and did every thing in their power to encourage him to break their necks. At Elizabeth-town, a young lady, well mounted, came up behind us, and attempted to ride by. Six or eight of us in&s;tantly rai&s;ed a halloo, frightened her hor&s;e, and almo&s;t un&s;eated her. On attempting to expo&s;tulate, I &s;oon found that I might pre&s;ently be treated &s;till wor&s;e than &s;he was. The whole cargo roared out, <HI>What? Suffer any body to take the road of us?</HI> They reviled the lady in the mo&s;t &s;hameful &s;tile. One of them I learned to be a merchant in New-York, and a man not of an ob&s;cure &s;ituation. A &s;econd was a quaker. I tried to ar|gue with him on the principles of his &s;ociety, on the vilene&s;s and cowardice of hazarding the life or limbs of a fellow creature for &s;uch a jockey piece of ettiquette. I had a &s;urly an&s;wer, and was at the &s;ame time, taken up &s;hort by a clergyman from the north of Ireland, who con&s;tantly kept him&s;elf in a &s;tate of elevation during the la&s;t &s;ixty miles of our journey.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="031906_0282_0FEF452774BDC908">At New-York, I was lodged with two others, in a back room, on the ground floor. This was a dirty hole about three yards and an half &s;quare.&mdash;What can be the rea&s;on for that vulgar hoggi&s;h cu&s;tom, common in America, of &s;queezing three, &s;ix, or eight beds into one room? No &s;uch thing is &s;een in the Briti&s;h i&s;lands. Among genteel or decent people, every per&s;on has not only a bed, but even a room to him&s;elf, and very frequently locks the door.</P>
<P>The back yard, into which the window of our cell opened, was about &s;ix yards wide every way. Within this &s;pace, and ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to our window &s;tood a little brick kitchen, and cheek by jowl, an edifice of the mo&s;t <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> nature. They were &s;eparated by a brick partition about &s;ix or nine inches thick. The delicacy of this arrangement mu&s;t &s;trike every per&s;on of &s;uperior ta&s;te. Having occa&s;ion to vi&s;it the temple, I found that the roof had tumbled in. It was about noon, and a very &s;ultry day, and before I could get out again, I had well nigh fainted with the mo&s;t horrible &s;tench that ever a&s;&s;ailed my no&s;trils.</P>
<P>If the continent of America were only ten miles broad, there might be &s;ome excu&s;e for jamming buildings together in &s;uch a di&s;gu&s;ting, aukward and dangerous way. I call it di&s;gu&s;ting, as the &s;cene ju&s;t de&s;cribed might turn the &s;tomach of a Hotten|tot. It is aukward, for when the&s;e receptacles of filth come to be emptied, matters are often &s;o badly laid out, that the only pa&s;&s;age to get the na&s;tine&s;s away, is through the very middle of the hou&s;e it&s;elf. Such is not univer&s;ally the mode of purga|tion, but it occurs, in too many in&s;tances. Now it is &s;urely aukward to be thus, almo&s;t in a literal &s;en&s;e, entrenched up to the teeth in human excrement; and it is the more extraordi|nary, as the Americans are highly and ju&s;tly commended for the general cleanline&s;s of their dome&s;tic economy. Can any body wonder that a city, under the fortieth degree of latitude, &s;hould be vi&s;ited by the yellow fever, when a part of its inhabi|tants are permitted to render it a centre of putrefaction? The <HI>danger</HI> of &s;queezing hou&s;es together like herrings in a barrel, is readily &s;een in ca&s;es of fire. A hou&s;e burnt down la&s;t winter in Philadelphia near the corner of Arch-&s;treet; and &s;uch was its &s;ituation that it was either almo&s;t, or entirely inacce&s;&s;ible to fire-engines. I know a city in Europe larger than Philadel|phia, that did not &s;uffer &s;o much by fire in fifteen years, as I have repeatedly &s;een the latter do in a &s;ingle evening. Ex|cu&s;e this di&s;gre&s;&s;ion. I now return to my travels.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="031906_0283_0FEF452A0033AA90">In coming back from New-York to this city, I preferred going by water.&mdash;The ma&s;ter of a &s;tage-boat, which took us over an arm of the &s;ea to New-Jer&s;ey, gave an eminent proof of attention to his duty. He &s;uffered our boat to be very nearly run down on a &s;mooth calm &s;ea, in broad day light, by a ve&s;&s;el of much larger bulk than ours, that was coming up in full &s;ail. At la&s;t, when within perhaps twenty yards of her, the &s;houting of her crew awaked him from his torpor; but after all, we mi&s;&s;ed only by a few feet, a &s;troke that ine|vitably would have &s;ent us to the bottom. Thus were the lives of twenty or thirty people brought into the mo&s;t immi|nent ri&s;k, becau&s;e the boat was entru&s;ted with a blockhead, who had not common &s;en&s;e enough to drive a dung cart.</P>
<P>At Amboy, part of our baggage was forgot, notwith&s;tan|ding the injunctions which we gave, and the a&s;&s;urances which we received, that the whole would be carefully packed. So great was the politene&s;s of the hou&s;e, that though we had paid for &s;eats over-night, the coach was on the point of &s;etting off without giving notice to five or &s;ix of us, who were in con&s;i|derable danger of being left behind.</P>
<P>In our pa&s;&s;age acro&s;s Jer&s;ey, the drivers did every thing in their power to kill the hor&s;es, by making them go at a hand gallop, for &s;ix or &s;even miles together, without &s;topping, over a deep &s;andy road, and in a very hot day. If the owners of the&s;e coaches had the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e even of their own intere&s;t, they would flog &s;uch barbarous villains, in place of paying them wages.</P>
<P>At Bordenton, we went into a &s;econd boat, where we met with very &s;orry accommodation. This was about four o'clock in the afternoon. We had about twenty miles down the De|laware to reach Philadelphia. The <HI>captain,</HI> who had a mo&s;t provoking tongue, was a boy about eighteen years of age. He, and a few companions, di&s;patched a dozen or eigh|teen bottles of porter. We ran three different times again&s;t other ve&s;&s;els that were coming up the &s;tream. The women and children lay all night on the bare boards of the cabin floor. A little boy, one of the pa&s;&s;engers from New-York, lingered at the brink of the grave, during &s;everal months, in con&s;equence of this mode of travelling. We reached Arch-&s;treet wharf, about eight o'clock on the Wedne&s;day morning, having been about &s;ixteen hours on a voyage of twenty miles. Compared to &s;uch navigators as tho&s;e two, whom I have ju&s;t given you an

account of, even poor Mitchell was an An&s;on or a Co|lumbus.</P>
<P>Print the above. The pre&s;s cannot do better than to de&s;cribe &s;cenes of inho&s;pitality and &s;windling that &s;eem to have been reduced to a national &s;y&s;tem, and that could hardly be expec|ted in a Turki&s;h caravan&s;era.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The buildings of Baltimore, New-York, and Philadelphia, contain in their con&s;truction &s;o great a proportion of wood, that if a flame has once fairly caught, nothing but the mo&s;t vigorous efforts can &s;top its progre&s;s.</P>
<P>If the ground &s;tory of one of our hou&s;es catches fire, a family re&s;iding in the &s;econd floor, may run the utmo&s;t hazard of be|ing either &s;uffocated by the &s;moke, or burnt alive in the flames. Their only &s;nift is to jump out of the windows, at the expence of breaking half their bones, unle&s;s, which does not always happen, ladders are brought to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Even in that ca&s;e, from hurry and confu&s;ion, the ri&s;k is con&s;iderable. In many places, hou&s;es are heaped together in &s;uch a manner, that in ca&s;e of a fire, either exit or acce&s;s would be almo&s;t imprac|ticable.</P>
<P>Every man who &s;ees a conflagration in an American town, mu&s;t remark the facility with which it &s;preads from one roof to another. This is one of the great and leading cau&s;es, which make our fires &s;o generally de&s;tructive. The fir&s;t rea&s;on is, that our hou&s;es are roofed with wood; and &s;econdly, a mo&s;t ab|&s;urd and &s;tupid practice among hou&s;e-carpenters, has multiplied the hazard in a ten-fold proportion.</P>
<P>When two hou&s;es of equal height are built clo&s;e together, it is very common for the planks of each roof <HI>to cro&s;s over and join with tho&s;e of the other.</HI> By this means, whenever one roof kindles, the flame, if it gets not oppo&s;ition, from a water engine, &s;preads immediately to the next. In Dublin, the hou|&s;es are roofed with &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate or tile, and each roof is &s;eparated from others by a little parapet of &s;tone, which is rai&s;ed about nine or twelve inches above the roof, being in fact, the top of the par|tition wall between the two buildings. This incombu&s;tible boundary, makes the conflagration &s;pread far more tardily than it otherwi&s;e would do.</P>
<P>When a traveller from Europe fir&s;t lands in the United States, he is amazed at the blindne&s;s and infatuation of per&s;i&s;ting in this practice of running the wooden roofs acro&s;s each other, a
<PB N="277" REF="031906_0285_0FEF44D946271A90">
practice &s;o pregnant with danger and ruin. A few years of ha|bit reconcile him to it, and if he builds a hou&s;e for him&s;elf, he is not ambitious of looking wi&s;er than other people.</P>
<P>We often hear of fires in London, and they are &s;ometimes ve|ry terrible. But London is about &s;even or eight times more populous than the five large&s;t &s;ea-port towns in America put together, &s;o that if we compare the number of buildings with the number of fires, in the&s;e different places, it will be found that tho&s;e of London are of much inferior frequency.</P>
<P>In Edinburgh, the hou&s;es are far more durably built than either in London or Dublin. In the two latter, the walls are almo&s;t univer&s;ally formed of brick, and the &s;tairs of wood. In Edinburgh the walls and &s;tairs are of &s;tone, and every &s;tair is arched quite round with &s;tone, &s;o firmly compacted, that the wooden parts of the hou&s;e might be con&s;umed twenty times over, and the &s;tair-ca&s;e it&s;elf remain without damage. No wooden roof is to be &s;een; and the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate roofs are invariably &s;eparated by a parapet wall. The re&s;ult from this &s;tyle of ar|chitecture is, that a well built hou&s;e can hardly burn to the ground, on any account. A dirty chimney may kindle, cau&s;e occa&s;ional alarm, and produce petty damage; but the burning out of a family is a very uncommon accident.</P>

all, many articles are left out, which were originally propo&s;ed for in&s;ertion. Though not al|ways in a regular &s;eries, yet a con&s;iderable part of the mo&s;t important events of the pre&s;ent year, have been related. Our maritime hi&s;tory, that is to &s;ay, an account of the French and Briti&s;h depredations, for the fir&s;t five months of 1796, have been com|piled with tolerable completene&s;s. The pre&s;ent chapter is to give a &s;ketch of the principal procee|dings in Congre&s;s, during that part of their &s;e&s;&s;ion, which began with the 1&s;t of January, 1796. Of many of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;peeches, there have already been in&s;erted large &s;pecimens.</P>
<P>The affair of Randall and Whitney belongs, mo&s;t properly, to the year 1795. A full account of it has been recently given in the American Annual Re|gi&s;ter. It is &s;ufficient here to &s;ay, that Robert Ran|dall and Charles Whitney, did, in 1795, conceive a project, in conjunction with &s;ome Briti&s;h &s;ettlers in Canada, for purcha&s;ing from Congre&s;s that &s;pa|cious penin&s;ula, which lies between lakes E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ie, Michigan, and Huron. It contains about twenty millions of acres. With this view they came to Philadelphia. Randall made &s;ome improper ad|vances to certain members of the Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives, in order to gain their intere&s;t. Having, no doubt, heard of the pilot-boat hi&s;tory, he wai|ted among others, upon Dr. William Smith. He was apprehended, brought to the bar of the hou&s;e, and for a &s;hort time confined in pri&s;on. Whitney had done nothing wrong. He was &s;ent to jail, and then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without examination. In this bu&s;i|ne&s;s, the hou&s;e acted without regularity, without judgment, and without ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>On the 19th of January, they took up the bill of appropriations for the current year. Mr. Williams moved to &s;trike out of it all the &s;ums allotted for
<PB N="279" REF="031906_0287_0FEF44E2D0970A30">
the mint. After a very hard &s;truggle, the mint pro|tracted its exi&s;tence, under the &s;evere&s;t repobation of its management from every &s;ide of the hou&s;e. The plan of this e&s;tabli&s;hment came from Mr. Ha|milton. Large &s;ums had been expended to very little purpo&s;e. One de&s;ign of it &s;eems to have been the erection of a board of &s;inecures for the &s;ake of increa&s;ing the executive influence.</P>
<P>On the 29th of January, the hou&s;e went into a committee of the whole, on a report from a com|mittee that had been appointed to find out a &s;hort hand writer who was to take down their debates at full length, and print them. A per&s;on had, for al|mo&s;t two preceding &s;e&s;&s;ions, attended the hou&s;e to take minutes of its proceedings for the Philadelphia Gazette. In this wilderne&s;s of &s;cribbling, many particulars tran&s;pired, which members were a&s;hamed to confe&s;s and afraid to deny. Four gentlemen were e&s;pecially irritated, viz. Theodore Sedgwick, Dr. William Smith, Samuel Dexter, and Robert Good|loe Harper. Me&s;&s;rs. Dexter and Sedgwick were not able to forgive the figure that they had made in the nobility debates, as well as on &s;ome other occa|&s;ions. Harper had di&s;puted with col. James White, delegate from Tenne&s;&s;ee, on the defence of the South-We&s;tern frontier; and the particulars, which were not to his advantage, had been related with unfeeling accuracy. But Dr. Smith, was by far more rancorous than the other gentlemen collectively. During the debate on Madi&s;on's re&s;olutions, Mr. Abraham Clarke of New-Jer&s;ey &s;aid, turning round to his right hand, and <HI>looking at Mr. William Smith,</HI> that a &s;tranger in the gallery might &s;uppo&s;e there was a Briti&s;h agent in the hou&s;e. The nickname of <HI>Briti&s;h agent</HI> became general. Mr. Smith was burnt in effigy at Charle&s;ton. On the ri&s;ing of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, he found it convenient to &s;hun a meeting with
<PB N="280" REF="031906_0288_0FEF44E56688E9F8">
his con&s;tituents by a tour for the en&s;uing &s;ummer, into the ea&s;tern &s;tates. The blame of this whole &s;candal was imputed to the pen of the guilty taker of minutes for the Philadelphia Gazette. Influence was employed, but in vain, to procure his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. This occurred in January, 1794.</P>
<P>But on the 2d and 3d of March, 1795, the Repre|&s;entatives met in the evening, and &s;ome of them be|ing in a &s;tate of unu&s;ual vivacity, Smith and Dex|ter aro&s;e and complained bitterly of the minutes in the Philadelphia Gazette. Neither of them &s;aid, becau&s;e neither of them dur&s;t &s;ay, that any thing of their own had been mi&s;repre&s;ented. The late Mr. Andrew Brown, knowing that mi&s;takes were unavoidable, had uniformly adverti&s;ed that he was ready to receive and print corrections. The two members clo&s;ed by propo&s;ing a re&s;olution for ap|pointing a committee to examine a &s;tenographer. It pa&s;t by twenty-eight votes again&s;t twenty-&s;ix.</P>
<P>All this was in March, 1795. On the 29th of January, 1796, Mr. Giles and Dr. Smith, who had been appointed a committee, reported in fa|vour of Mr. Robert&s;on, a Scot&s;man, from Peter&s;|burg, in Virginia. He demanded four thou&s;and dollars. Congre&s;s were to give him two thou&s;and nine hundred, and Mr. Brown undertook for the re&s;t of the &s;um. The debates were to be printed fir&s;t in his new&s;paper. This would likewi&s;e an&s;wer the object of Mr. Smith in &s;eparating Mr. Brown and his pre&s;ent reporter.</P>
<P>The plan was attacked from every part of the hou&s;e, as impracticable, if u&s;eful; and as u&s;ele&s;s if it could be practicable. Mr. Baldwin &s;aid that he had &s;een many printed &s;ketches of &s;peeches made in that hou&s;e, and which he would not wi&s;h to &s;ee bet|ter done. Mr. Swanwick had often heard of <HI>mi&s;|cellaneous compo&s;itions,</HI> but the &s;trange&s;t of all mi&s;|cellanies
<PB N="281" REF="031906_0289_0FEF32B9D839ACE8">
that he ever heard of, was for the legi&s;la|ture of a country to run &s;hares with a printer in the publication of their proceedings. Even Mr. Sedgwick, al&s;o, oppo&s;ed the plan. He hone&s;tly &s;aid, that gentlemen were apt to get into a pa&s;&s;ion, and then they were angry at &s;eeing their expre&s;&s;ions in print. Mr. Nicholas was for the appointment. He complained that a per&s;on who came often to that hou&s;e, and who had a very good &s;tyle of wri|ting, once publi&s;hed a &s;peech as his. <Q>The language was much better than I could have made,</Q> &s;aid Mr. Nicholas, and here the member was mi&s;taken. <Q>The &s;peech did not contain a &s;ingle &s;entiment that I would have di&s;owned, but &s;till the &s;peech was not mine.</Q> Mr. Harper attacked the de|bates in the Philadelphia Gazette, as di&s;graceful to the country, and full of fal&s;ehoods. He prattled away at this rate, for a con&s;iderable time. He had never complained of inaccuracy but once; and his correction was immediately adopted. Mr. Harper po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a readine&s;s of invention, and a confidence of affirmation, which the public e&s;timate at their proper value.</P>
<P>Mr. Giles &s;poke in favour of the report; but he &s;eemed to lo&s;e courage on finding that a large majority in the hou&s;e entirely di&s;approved of the plan. He expre&s;&s;ed regret at having been concern|ed in it. As an excu&s;e, he complained, for the fir&s;t time, of the inaccuracy of the debates. He had never before dropt a hint of that nature. The pre|&s;umption is, that it was now brought forward to help him out with a lame argument. He felt evi|dent chagrin at finding him&s;elf entangled in this prodigal and ab&s;urd project. The committee ro&s;e without a divi&s;ion. On the 2d of February, 1796, the &s;ubject was di&s;charged by a re&s;olution of the hou&s;e. Mr. Robert&s;on had come &s;ome hundreds
<PB N="282" REF="031906_0290_0FEF455DB080BB98">
of miles, from a lucrative employment, at the par|ticular de&s;ire of the &s;pecial committee, and had &s;taid in Philadelphia waiting on this bu&s;ine&s;s, at a con&s;iderable expence. He was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without compen&s;ation. The hou&s;e ought at lea&s;t to have paid the charges of his journey.</P>
<P>On the 8th of January, the Pre&s;ident had &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to Congre&s;s. It inclo&s;ed a memorial from the commi&s;&s;ioners appointed for in&s;pecting the buildings at the federal city. The object was, to obtain a loan of money, under the &s;anction of go|vernment, in order to complete the public build|ings at that place. The loan was to be &s;ecured on the public property in the city. The United States were to pledge them&s;elves that, in ca&s;e of the pro|perty proving inadequate for di&s;charging the loan, government was to make good the deficiency.</P>
<P>A committee was appointed to report on this me&s;&s;age. After &s;everal di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, a bill re&s;pecting it pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, on the 31&s;t of March, 1796. The Pre&s;ident was thereby au|thori&s;ed to borrow three hundred thou&s;and dollars on the plan above &s;tated. The bill went through, by &s;eventy-two votes again&s;t twenty-one. Thus a fre&s;h bli&s;ter is applied to the back of our national debt.</P>
<P>Mr. Coit, Mr. Sitgreaves, Mr. Havens, and Mr. Swanwick, did them&s;elves the honour of oppo&s;ing this <HI>annihilation</HI> of the public money; for, that the&s;e three hundred thou&s;and dollars will finally come out of the federal trea&s;ury, and never more return to it, is tolerably certain.</P>
<P>Mr. Coit &s;aid, that, between three and four hun|dred thou&s;and dollars have already been expended; and, as he conceived, to <HI>what was wor&s;e than no purpo&s;e.</HI> Ninety-&s;even thou&s;and dollars had been laid out on the Pre&s;ident's hou&s;e, and it was e&s;tima|ted
<PB N="283" REF="031906_0291_0FEF45622BC07080">
that nearly as much more would be wanted to complete it. When fini&s;hed, he conceived that a hou&s;e, which would co&s;t only <HI>fifty thou&s;and</HI> dol|lars, would better an&s;wer the purpo&s;e. About eighty thou&s;and dollars had been expended on the capitol, and yet, <HI>progre&s;s was &s;carcely made beyond the foundation.</HI> He expected many <HI>future</HI> and <HI>hea|vy</HI> applications to <HI>the public trea&s;ury</HI> for tho&s;e buil|dings, which he feared would be a la&s;ting monu|ment of the pride and folly of this country.&mdash;Nine|ty-&s;even thou&s;and dollars for a pre&s;idential palace, that is not yet <HI>more than half completed!</HI> Thus the whole building will co&s;t at lea&s;t two hundred thou|&s;and dollars. If this is not deplorable wa&s;te of mo|ney, we &s;hould be happy to learn what name it de|&s;erves? Indeed, unle&s;s among the parties immedi|ately intere&s;ted in forwarding this hou&s;e, there can hardly be two opinions about it. The ab&s;urdity is too enormous to be endured with tranquility by any man, unle&s;s his ideas are adulterated by &s;elf-intere&s;t, by prejudice, by the horror of <HI>being left in a minority,</HI> or by &s;ome other petty motive unconnec|ted with the common exerci&s;e of his under&s;tanding. The capitol is another &s;uperfluous edifice, that, as came out in the debates, has already &s;unk <HI>eighty thou&s;and dollars,</HI> and is &s;carcely rai&s;ed beyond its foundation. Such things are encouraged to go on, while our mo&s;t excellent of all governments can hardly rai&s;e money to pay the very intere&s;t of the debts which it is <HI>annually</HI> contracting. It is not a &s;ea&s;on to varni&s;h the poop, when the wind is ren|ding the &s;hrouds, when the &s;ea is bur&s;ting the &s;eams, and driving in the cabin windows.</P>
<P>Mr. Sedgwick, in the debate on the 25th of Februa|ry declared, with a convenient <HI>rotundity</HI> of a&s;&s;ertion, that accommodations are to be made for govern|ment <HI>without any expence to the public trea&s;ury.</HI> It
<PB N="284" REF="031906_0292_0FEF452BCEC15418">
is certain that they will be erected at a very enor|mous expence, which mu&s;t come in &s;ome &s;hape from the pur&s;es of the people. Every new&s;paper is occa&s;ionally filled with adverti&s;ements about the <HI>Wa&s;hington lottery.</HI> This is a tax on the public. In Europe it is univer&s;ally agreed, that a lottery is the mo&s;t ruinous of all methods for rai&s;ing money, and, at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t injurious to the morals of the people. When we hear Mr. Sedgwick &s;ay, that the&s;e public buildings are to be rai&s;ed <HI>without expence to the public,</HI> one might gue&s;s that, like the palace in an Arabian tale, they were to ri&s;e by enchantment.</P>
<P>It is amazing that any gentleman can &s;tand up in Congre&s;s, and talk in &s;uch a way. Nay, Mr. Sedg|wick went further. He &s;aid that the more magni|ficent the&s;e buildings were, &s;o much the better. If they exceeded the &s;plendour of the palaces of Eu|rope, Americans ought to be <HI>grateful.</HI> It is highly wrong for any legi&s;lature to encourage, among its citizens, a ta&s;te for gambling. The lottery for <HI>the federal city</HI> does this in a con&s;iderable degree; it ex|plains, what Mr. Coit ju&s;tly &s;aid, that between three and four hundred thou&s;and dollars have been expen|ded <HI>to what is wor&s;e than no purpo&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Sedgwick may rant as much as he plea&s;es, about the gratification that Americans mu&s;t feel in contemplating the completion, and magnificence of the&s;e buildings in the federal city. A man with cha&s;te ideas of political economy, and of national freedom, will con&s;ider them as an equal outrage on the one and the other. The pyramids of Egypt, the amphitheatre of Titus, the pillar of Trajan, and a thou&s;and other edifices of a &s;imilar de&s;crip|tion, were durable and in&s;ulting te&s;timonials of the &s;lavery of mankind, with an impre&s;&s;ion more forci|ble
<PB N="285" REF="031906_0293_0FEF44EA0145C670">
than the pen or the pencil can convey. They atte&s;ted, that the property and indu&s;try of mil|lions of people had been &s;acrificed to glut the caprice and vanity of a &s;ingle man. <HI>And who or what was this man?</HI> Some jockey king, or cut throat emperor, who, if &s;tript of <HI>a little brief authority,</HI> would, u&s;ually, have been one of the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant of his &s;pecies. But it is need|le&s;s to enter into general declarations, or appeal to the mournful evidence of Rome and Egypt. The facts admitted in Congre&s;s &s;peak with &s;ufficient di&s;|tinctne&s;s.</P>
<P>If the money had been laid out on a canal be|tween Newca&s;tle and Frenchtown, or on a high road between Philadelphia and Baltimore, or in pen&s;ions, to &s;ome of the poor old &s;oldiers, who &s;old their certificates for half a crown in the pound, there might be &s;ome con&s;olation. The ca&s;h had, to be &s;ure, been rai&s;ed in a bad way, but its expendi|ture had an&s;wered &s;ome u&s;eful end; and, though no man of &s;en&s;e would ever have been highly plea|&s;ed by &s;eeing the rapid &s;ale of lottery tickets, yet the laudable application of the money, mu&s;t have &s;erved as an emolient to the ulcer.</P>
<P>It is hard to &s;ay what was the original object of founding this federal city, or what benefit it could be &s;uppo&s;ed to an&s;wer to the country in general. The human faculties are as clear on the banks of the Delaware as on tho&s;e of the Potomac. The Pre|&s;ident had already a good hou&s;e in Philadelphia, for which his very large &s;alary, of twenty-five thou&s;and dollars, well enables him to pay a &s;uit|able rent. The apartments wherein Congre&s;s at pre&s;ent a&s;&s;emble, in the &s;ame city, are as roomy and elegant as can be de&s;ired. Philadelphia has a centrical &s;ituation, and an atmo&s;phere at lea&s;t as healthy as the intended new metropolis. We a&s;k
<PB N="286" REF="031906_0294_0FEF45B2AC4052C8">
then, what could be the u&s;e or object of the&s;e buildings? Or why did a government, encumbered with a debt of &s;eventy millions of dollars, plunge its citizens into this unfathomable pit of architec|ture and of lotteries? An old London book&s;eller u&s;ed to &s;ay, that the <HI>title page</HI> was half of the bat|tle. In like manner, the <HI>name</HI> of this city has pro|duced more than half the patience with which its expenditures have been endured.</P>
<P><HI>Endured</HI> is the proper word, for this plan has never excited popular enthu&s;ia&s;m. It hardly could. Is there not already in the union a city good enough to accommodate Congre&s;s? No other city on the continent can expect the &s;malle&s;t advantage from this removal, and every one of them feels a certain lo&s;s. <Q>On the &s;ame principle, &s;aid Mr, Swanwick, the hou&s;e might guarantee loans for all the cities in the union? Why a loan for the city of Wa&s;hington in particular? Was there any <HI>rea&s;on</HI> why the <HI>different cities</HI> in the union &s;hould be <HI>taxed for that city?</HI></Q> He might have &s;ubjoined, is there any <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> in &s;uch a tax? If Wa&s;hington becomes an eminent commercial place, Alexandria, or Norfolk, or Baltimore, will not be one farthing the better for it, but they may chance to be the wor&s;e.</P>
<P>It is highly expedient that the legi&s;lature of a nation &s;hould a&s;&s;emble to do bu&s;ine&s;s in one of the large&s;t of its cities. The rea&s;on is obvious. The eyes of the people are thus more effectually open|ed to its proceedings; and a legi&s;lature is much more &s;afely to be entru&s;ted when under &s;uch in|&s;pection.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of liberty, the penetration to di&s;cern and fortitude to re&s;i&s;t de&s;poti&s;m, have often been found to beat higher in the metropolis of a limited government than in any other place. Thus Charles
<PB N="287" REF="031906_0295_0FEF4531D93DF1D0">
the fir&s;t was blamed for calling the long parliament at London, where his tyranny was dete&s;ted, and con&s;equently where parliament were &s;ure of firm and effectual &s;upport. His friends regretted that it had not met at Oxford; the mi&s;take co&s;t his maje&s;ty the lo&s;s of his head.</P>
<P>The French revolution began at Paris. The true character of government was much better un|der&s;tood there, by the common people, than by the &s;ame cla&s;s in mo&s;t other quarters of the kingdom. At Am&s;terdam, al&s;o, oppo&s;ition to the corrupting influence of the &s;tadtholder was always &s;tronger than any where el&s;e. A very large city is, in almo&s;t every re&s;pect, a great nui&s;ance. Yet, as <HI>it is a bad wind which blows good to nobody,</HI> a &s;ubordinate ad|vantage may often be traced in the mid&s;t of a po|litical evil.</P>
<P>Such immen&s;e capitals as London, Paris, or even Am&s;terdam, cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t in America, for centuries to come, but if they did &s;o, many rea&s;ons would re|commend that the &s;eat of government &s;hould al&s;o re&s;ide in &s;uch a &s;ituation. With &s;o many ob&s;er|vers to watch its motions, and who&s;e very numbers in&s;pire them with peculiar confidence, the in&s;olence or corruption of office is more likely to be detected and expo&s;ed than on a more limited field of enquiry. The pre&s;ent trifling oppo&s;ition that the abandoned mini&s;ter of England finds in the Hou&s;e of Commons, would, by this time, have mo&s;t likely dwindled alto|gether away, if the &s;pirit of Sheridan and others had not been &s;upported by their &s;ituation in the bo|&s;om of a numerous party of the citizens of London.</P>
<P>The&s;e hints tend to point out the propriety of retaining the re&s;idence of the federal legi&s;lature in one of the larger cities of the union. On the &s;treets of New-York or Philadelphia, every member of Congre&s;s meets with fellow citizens as independent
<PB N="288" REF="031906_0296_0FEF453548B11130">
and well-informed as him&s;elf, and who, without ce|remony, will tell him what they think of his conduct. In &s;uch a place he has a thou&s;and opportunities of learning public feelings, which he never could acquire in a &s;eque&s;tered de&s;art, like the paper-built city of Wa&s;hington, even &s;uppo&s;ing that he were to read all the new&s;papers in the Uni|ted States. We have at this time about an hundred and twenty new&s;papers, if not more; and hence, that ta&s;k is, in it&s;elf, impo&s;&s;ible. It is by mix|ing with mankind that you learn how to legi&s;|late for them. <HI>In the multitude of coun&s;ellors there is &s;afety,</HI> &s;aid the wi&s;e man; and in a limited &s;en&s;e, the maxim holds good. It is only by a colli&s;ion of various &s;entiments, opinions, habits of thinking and views of life, the light of truth is finally to be &s;truck out.</P>
<P>There is a large hou&s;e in Philadelphia which the A&s;&s;embly of Penn&s;ylvania had de&s;igned for the Pre&s;i|dent. Mr. Swanwick, in a debate about this fede|ral city bill, noticed that twenty thou&s;and dollars were granted to build it; but nearly twice the &s;um had been a&s;ked for it &s;ince, and the hou&s;e is <HI>not yet fini&s;hed.</HI></P>
<P>Veterans who fought battles for America, were glad to accept, as all the world knows, of half-a-crown in the pound for the arrears of their dear-bought wages. Hundreds of petitions are, in the cour&s;e of every &s;e&s;&s;ion, pre&s;ented to Congre&s;s from mi&s;erable objects of all &s;orts, who were redu|ced to decrepitude and beggary in the continental &s;er|vice. Government cannot relieve all the&s;e people, but &s;till if they promoted lotteries for that end, the money would be more honourably be&s;towed than on a <HI>capitol,</HI> which has already co&s;t <HI>eighty thou&s;and dol|lars,</HI> though it is hardly <HI>vi&s;ible above ground!</HI></P>
<P>As for the palace of the Pre&s;ident, the plan mu&s;t
<PB N="289" REF="031906_0297_0FEF4537D3CB5260">
have originated with &s;omebody, who wanted to &s;et up a political idol. A Pre&s;ident is the very la&s;t man in the community for whom the public ought to build a hou&s;e, becau&s;e he has a &s;alary five times larger than that of any other public officer in the union; and hence can afford better than other pub|lic officer to pay the rent of his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The money expended on palaces at the federal city, is ab&s;olutely ca&s;t away. The Pre&s;ident and Congre&s;s are already as well accommodated with lodgings as they need wi&s;h to be, or de&s;erve to be. There is no u&s;e for &s;uch extravagant buildings. The rai&s;ing of money by lotteries is the mo&s;t perni|cious re&s;ource within the range of political in&s;anity. The erection of &s;uch fabrics tends to excite a tone of ari&s;tocracy and of royalty, to which mankind are already but too much addicted.</P>
<P>Dr. Samuel John&s;on &s;ays, that <Q>to build is to be <HI>robbed.</HI></Q> We cannot expect that hou&s;es rai&s;ed for a government will be carried on with more economy than tho&s;e of private per&s;ons. Mr. Coit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See debate of the 31&s;t of March, 1796.</NOTE> &s;ays, that the buildings at Wa&s;hington have been commenced on an extravagant plan, and that he hopes the commi&s;&s;ioners will be obliged to <HI>contract them.</HI> Mr. Sitgreaves, in the &s;ame debate, al&s;o declares that the eventual expence of the buil|dings is not <HI>within the reach of calculation, or even of conjecture.</HI> What a mi&s;erable pro&s;pect is yawn|ing before us!</P>
<P>Mr. Havens a&s;ked, what was meant when it was &s;aid that there exi&s;ted an obligation of going to this new city at the year 1800? If room was not to be had in it, Congre&s;s might go to Georgetown. They <HI>may ju&s;t as well &s;tay where they are.</HI> What would they be at? Poor Richard &s;ays,
<Q><PB N="290" REF="031906_0298_0FEF45B73618C528">
<L>I never &s;aw an oft removed tree,</L>
<L>Or yet an oft removed family,</L>
<L>Which throve &s;o well, as tho&s;e that &s;ettled be.</L></Q></P>
<P>Let us make a &s;uppo&s;ition that, before the end of the year 1800, only two millions of dollars are ex|pended on the federal city. The buildings, as has been already explained, are on an extravagant &s;cale. The United States could do as well without them.</P>
<P>Put two millions of dollars into any rational &s;cheme of dome&s;tic improvement in the country, &s;uch as a well contrived canal. The money will yield a clear profit of ten, twenty or thirty per cent. Take it at the lowe&s;t rate, and with ten per cent. of compound intere&s;t, a &s;um doubles it&s;elf in &s;even years, fifty-two days and an half. In fifty years, the&s;e two millions of dollars will double them&s;elves &s;even times. They will amount to two hundred and fifty-&s;ix millions. In an hundred years, they will amount to thirty-two thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixty-eight millions of dollars, which, at that aera, will be the real expence of the city, even if re&s;tric|ted only to the original two millions. This com|putation &s;hews the folly of &s;inking a capital on an object which is both unproductive and &s;uperfluous.</P>
<P>At the end of the nineteenth century, the federal <HI>quarries above ground</HI> will not be worth &s;o great a &s;um; nor indeed worth <HI>what they originally co&s;t.</HI> They cannot, like a high road, or an improved farm, pay a large intere&s;t. They are mere unproductive ma&s;&s;es of brick and lime, and wood and &s;tone, the &s;pawn of lotteries and land jobbing, for all which fine articles Mr. Theodore Sedgwick imagines it our duty to be <HI>grateful.</HI></P>
<P>This project of the federal city has been examined at &s;ome length, becau&s;e the &s;ubject is very imper|fectly under&s;tood, and becau&s;e the plan, if comple|ted,
<PB N="291" REF="031906_0299_0FEF45B8F5F98CF8">
mu&s;t end in de&s;troying the American con&s;titu|tion. The monarchical party in the convention of 1787, had the following clau&s;e thru&s;t into that paper. <Q>The Congre&s;s &s;hall have power to exerci&s;e EX|CLUSIVE <HI>legi&s;lation, in all ca&s;es what&s;oever,</HI> over &s;uch di&s;trict, not exceeding <HI>ten miles &s;quare,</HI> as may, by ce&s;&s;ion of particular &s;tates, and the ac|ceptance of Congre&s;s, become the &s;eat of govern|ment of the United States.</Q> A like clau&s;e was never heard of before in the con&s;titution, or prac|tical admini&s;tration of any government in the world.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e that, at the Engli&s;h revolution of 1688, the new parliament had declared them&s;elves exclu|&s;ive legi&s;lators over a &s;quare of ten miles, and of which St. Stephen's chapel was to be the centre. <HI>Exclu&s;ive</HI> legi&s;lation is but another term for arbi|trary power, becau&s;e it confounds the characters of judge and legi&s;lator. In &s;o &s;mall a &s;pace, where parliament were &s;ure to &s;ee every thing, magi&s;trates would have been nothing but their tools; and jobs, de&s;poti&s;m, anarchy, and revolt mu&s;t have en&s;ued. The citizens of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter would, in two or three years at the utmo&s;t, have laid the new government on its back. But it would be wrong|ing the character of the Engli&s;h nation to put the &s;uppo&s;ition that a clau&s;e &s;o ab&s;urd, &s;o fanta&s;tical, &s;o big with mi&s;chief, and confu&s;ion could ever have pa&s;t in that country. Such an originality was re|&s;erved for the fertile brain of Alexander Hamilton. In the convention of bolted doors, this bauble was part of the compromi&s;e and &s;acrifice granted by Ma|di&s;on and his friends to the royal faction. Being combined with better materials, it was without re|flection accepted by the citizens of America. As a parting appeal to their common &s;en&s;e, let us only figure this ca&s;e, that the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania had ceded to Congre&s;s a di&s;trict of ten miles, <HI>including

<P>Their ignorance, their caprice, the natural in&s;o|lence of unlimited authority, would, in a few years, have thinned the &s;treets of the city. If on the 4th of July, 1795, Congre&s;s had held exclu&s;ive legi&s;lation in Philadelphia the evening would not have clo&s;ed with a &s;hower of brick-bats. The di&s;mounting and di&s;arming of captain John Morrell, of the china ware-hou&s;e, in North Front-&s;treet, and his being &s;o ba&s;ely pitched into Frog-pond at Ken&s;ington, might have produced a general ma&s;&s;acre of the citizens. The &s;ale of his &s;word for &s;ixpence, on his declining to reclaim it, might have ea&s;ily been turned into a high crime and mi&s;demeanour. This inference be|comes very probable, when we contemplate th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bloody maxims of our American DUKE OF ALVA<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Alexander Hamilton wi&s;hed, <Q>that the people, a&s;&s;embled at Braddock's field, <HI>had burnt Pitt&s;burgh.</HI></Q> Randolph's Vindication, p. 83. <Q>One motive a&s;&s;igned in argument, for calling forth the mi|litia, has been, that a government can never be &s;aid to be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, until &s;ome SIGNAL DISPLAY has manife&s;ted its power of <HI>mili|tary coer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion.</HI> "This maxim," adds Randolph, "if indulged, would heap cur&s;es upon the government.

The maxims and wi&s;hes of Mr. Hamilton exceed any &s;entiment recorded from the hemp-crack-governor of the Netherlands. They rather approach to the comprehen&s;ive &s;ublimity of Caligula.</P>
<P>It is extremely worthy of notice, that although the Gazette of the United States has been con&s;tantly ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ling at Randolph, yet no deni|al has ever appeared as to the accuracy of the pa&s;&s;ages above quoted.

<P>On the 5th of February, 1796, the bill of ap|propriation for the current year, having gone
<PB N="293" REF="031906_0301_0FEF47922A2B2E68">
through both hou&s;es, was approved by the pre&s;i|dent. This approbation is an in&s;ignificant form. The wor&s;t laws, as well as the be&s;t ones, have, for &s;eve|ral years pa&s;t, con&s;tantly received the pre&s;ident's; affirmative. In all ca&s;es of importance, however, his will is previou&s;ly under&s;tood and &s;trictly obey|ed by a majority of the Senate. There may have been one or two exceptions to this rule, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for a con&s;iderable time. In the ca&s;e of Madi&s;on's fir&s;t re&s;olution, and of Mr. Clarke's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill for prohi|biting commercial intercour&s;e with England, the Senate were, indeed, equally divided, and the ca&s;|ting vote of Mr. Adams negatived both. But here it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, that Mr. Wa&s;hington had kept him&s;elf in &s;u&s;pence. He had only ju&s;t parted with Jeffer&s;on, and Hamilton was not yet completely fixed in the &s;addle. When the latter fact came to be known, every <HI>federal</HI> mea&s;ure was bolted through by a large majority. After all, when two legi&s;la|tive bodies have agreed to a law&punc; it is below their dignity to enquire for the opinion of any &s;ingle man. By the con&s;titution, a pre&s;ident who wi&s;hes to be trouble&s;ome, can rai&s;e con&s;iderable confu&s;ion. If he refu&s;es approbation, the law is &s;ent back to Congre&s;s; and, unle&s;s <HI>two-thirds</HI> of each hou&s;e &s;hall afterwards agree to it, the law becomes void. It is very &s;eldom that &s;o great a majority unites upon an important mea&s;ure. The Senate con&s;i&s;ts, at pre&s;ent, of thirty-two members; and, by this clau&s;e of the con&s;titution, Mr. Adams, &s;upported by eleven &s;enators, being more than one-third of the whole number, could prevent the pa&s;&s;ing of any bill which he did not like. Thus the veto of twelve per&s;ons, who are not wi&s;er or better than their neigh|bours, might in every in&s;tance overweigh the whole Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, though &s;upported by twenty-one &s;enators. This is one of the mi&s;takes
<PB N="294" REF="031906_0302_0FEF45CE926430E0">
in our con&s;titution. If the citizens of America could, like the bees, create an animal of faculties &s;u|perior to their own, this <HI>veto</HI> might be u&s;eful. But in the late and pre&s;ent mediocrity of pre&s;idential ta|lents, it is at be&s;t an expen&s;ive exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;ence.

<P><PB N="295" REF="031906_0303_0FEF45D134E8A998">On the 9th of February, was pre&s;ented the me|morial above in&s;erted from the &s;nuff-makers of Philadelphia. The act of which they complained exemplifies the remark of Montaigne, that <Q>there is nothing &s;o commonly or &s;o gro&s;sly faulty as <HI>the laws.</HI></Q> The fir&s;t of the two &s;tatutes in que&s;tion required the performance of impo&s;&s;ibilities. For in&s;tance, the &s;nuff maker was to &s;wear to a <HI>daily</HI> jour|nal of the &s;nuff grinded. To be able to do &s;o he mu&s;t have taken down his mill at the end of every day's work, and another entire day was requi&s;ite for putting it again in order. Thus between <HI>taking down</HI> and <HI>&s;etting up,</HI> the &s;nuff-maker would have &s;pent four or five days in the week in hard work, with|out grinding one ounce of &s;nuff. Mr. Thomas Lei|per, and his fellow &s;ufferers, had not logic enough to convince Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Sedgwick, and Dr. Smith, of this rule producing a hard&s;hip. Other clau&s;es were equally &s;tupid, oppre&s;&s;ive, and imprac|ticable. A ruinous exci&s;e on refined &s;ugar manu|factured in America had been blended in the &s;ame law with &s;nuff, and it &s;till remains in force. In a proof &s;heet of the <HI>&s;hort hi&s;tory of exci&s;e,</HI> it was &s;ta|ted
<PB N="296" REF="031906_0304_0FEF45D665939D18">
that, after paying the duty, there would not re|main to the refiners of &s;ugar more than a clear pro|fit of five per cent. upon the capital embarked in their bu&s;ine&s;s. This circum&s;tance was related on the authority of &s;ome of the principal manufactu|rers in Philadelphia. But, on a revi&s;al, they cho&s;e to &s;trike it out of the publication, le&s;t a di&s;clo&s;ure might alarm their corre&s;pondents, and injure the ge|neral intere&s;t of the trade. This was in the fall of 1795. Matters have certainly been improved, or el&s;e the manufacture mu&s;t have &s;topt, as that of &s;nuff actually did. The &s;ugar boilers could have got &s;ix per cent. for their money in the common rate of intere&s;t, and ten times that &s;um from an ex|porting flour merchant.</P>
<P>One would be apt to believe that the <HI>federal</HI> mem|bers of Congre&s;s wanted to de&s;troy altogether Ame|rican manufactures. The paper money &s;y&s;tem is chiefly theirs. Twenty millions of dollars, fabri|cated out of old rags, are now circulating about the continent. Of the&s;e, ten millions belong to the bank of the United States. The total dividend of all the&s;e banks, as &s;tated in Congre&s;s by Dr. Smith and Mr. Gallatin, comes to two millions of dollars per annum. The expences of management can hardly be le&s;s than five hundred thou&s;and dollars more. This enormous tax, for ju&s;t nothing at all, and the &s;cropholous abundance of money produced by the bank capitals, have tended extremely to im|pede the progre&s;s of American manufactures. Though not the &s;ole cau&s;e, they have yet been among the chief cau&s;es that rai&s;e the wages of la|bour in America &s;o extravagantly beyond its price in Europe. Some leaders of the federal party po&s;|&s;e&s;s exten&s;ive concerns in the bank of the United States. But the maturity of American manufactures never can arrive, till wages fall, and that mu&s;t
<PB N="297" REF="031906_0305_0FEF45DB2C1F22B0">
be preceded by a reduction of the ma&s;s of paper. Hence the&s;e leaders wi&s;h to encourage the importa|tion of Briti&s;h goods. The merchants who import them, al&s;o, and who, in general, dete&s;t American rival&s;hip, are in con&s;tant habits of di&s;counting at the banks, and it is of con&s;equence to favour &s;uch valuable cu&s;tomers. The&s;e obvious motives tend to make the federal commanders anxious for the clo&s;e&s;t connection with England. The &s;ame &s;cale of argument leads them to abhor the French, among whom paper currency has always been de&s;|pi&s;ed. Hence, among other rea&s;ons, we find their con&s;tant inclination to revile France<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Camden, in his hi&s;tory of Elizabeth, book iv. p. 443, has the&s;e words. <Q>The French lawyers &s;ay, that what&s;oever is once an|nexed to the crown of France, doth in&s;eparably adhere to it for|ever.</Q> This vindicates the republicans from a &s;u&s;picion of innova|tion, when they refu&s;e to re&s;tore the Low Countries to the emperor.</P>
<P>During the time of the French league, Elizabeth was advi&s;ed to attempt the conque&s;t of Picardy and Normandy. <Q>She heard it, &s;ays Camden, with regret and di&s;like, and rejected it with much indignation, &s;aying, <HI>when&s;oever the la&s;t day of the kingdom of France cometh, it will, undoubtedly, be the eve of the de&s;truction of England.</HI></Q> Ibid. p. 444.</P></NOTE>. Hence their enthu&s;ia&s;tic zeal, for the completion of Jay's treaty to which the journal of Congre&s;s hath now brought us.</P>
<P>Nothing that excited general attention occurred in Congre&s;s from the trial of Randall till the 1&s;t of March. On that day, the Pre&s;ident &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to each hou&s;e informing them that ratifications of the Briti&s;h treaty had been exchanged at London, on the 28th of October, 1795. <Q>I have <HI>directed</HI> the &s;ame to be promulgated,</Q> added the Pre&s;i|dent, <Q>and herewith tran&s;mit a copy thereof for the <HI>information</HI> of Congre&s;s.</Q> This was clearly the &s;tyle of a public officer, who con&s;idered his au|thority on this point, as independent and unque&s;|tionable.
<PB N="298" REF="031906_0306_0FEF4793D73BA990">
He had complied with every formality required by the con&s;titution. He had &s;elected an amba&s;&s;ador for England, and had given him in&s;truc|tions as a rule of conduct. The con&s;titution &s;ays <Q>he &s;hall nominate, and by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate, &s;hall appoint amba&s;&s;a|dors.</Q> The pre&s;ident had announced his nomi|nation to that body. They were mean or &s;tupid enough to acquie&s;ce in the appointment, without once a&s;king for what purpo&s;e Jay was to be &s;ent to England, or demanding a copy of his in&s;tructions. This &s;hewed that the me&s;&s;age was but an empty form, and that, in the particular details of his ne|gociation, the Pre&s;ident &s;corned to hold any prefa|tory communications with them. Here, by the way, comes out, as before ob&s;erved,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Supra chap. 3.</NOTE> an evidence of hypocri&s;y towards Genet. Mr. Wa&s;hington could not negociate with the French envoy, becau&s;e the Senate were not in &s;e&s;&s;ion. Yet, over their heads, he &s;ent an envoy to England, without letting them under&s;tand one line of his directions. This was frankly telling the republic that he rejected their advances. He could not have taken a more ungra|cious, a more ungrateful or infatuated &s;tep. After &s;uch coldne&s;s and contempt on our part, we &s;hould &s;peak with temper about the republic. Frenchmen have never been celebrated for patience; and it can lea&s;t of all be expected in the mid&s;t of a blaze of victories, which reduce Beli&s;arius and Hannibal to the rank and file of conquerors.</P>
<P>From this digre&s;&s;ion we go back to Jay. Recei|ving orders from the Pre&s;ident, and a &s;anction from the Senate, he went to England and framed a trea|ty. On its arrival here, the Senate, and Pre&s;ident, gave in due time, a ratification. They expre&s;sly
<PB N="299" REF="031906_0307_0FEF47965A16BDD0">
took the whole burden upon them&s;elves; and whe|ther Jay obeyed his in&s;tructions, or broke them, was a que&s;tion entirely between him&s;elf and the Pre&s;i|dent, from whom exclu&s;ively he accepted of them. The Senate had, beforehand, re&s;igned all right of thinking upon the &s;ubject. They po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no fu|ture title to call for the in&s;tructions. The fit time for that demand had pa&s;&s;ed away. If the treaty proved to be a good one, it was quite a frivolous enquiry, whether the in&s;tructions were right or wrong. If it was bad, the Pre&s;ident &s;tood in the gap, and they could di&s;appoint all bad effects by a rejection. They approved of the whole treaty, one article excepted. It was, thereafter, ratified by the Pre&s;ident. Here the character of the&s;e two branches, or rather of the&s;e two &s;prigs from the trunk of <HI>repre&s;entation,</HI> was completely embarked.</P>
<P>There does not appear any &s;olid rea&s;on why the Pre&s;ident, in the &s;equel, &s;ubmitted Jay's in&s;tructions to the Senate, after the treaty had been ratified. The only time for &s;uch a communication was be|fore Jay &s;ailed for England. The in&s;trument could only &s;tand or fall, not by the tenor of the in&s;truc|tions, but by its own intrin&s;ic value. The tardy production of Jay's orders re&s;embled a Chine&s;e marriage. The lover, it is &s;aid, does not &s;ee his mi&s;tre&s;s till after the wedding, but has leave to &s;end her home again, if he does not like her. The Pre|&s;ident could only &s;end this paper as a matter of ci|vility. The Senate had lo&s;t their right of calling for the in&s;tructions. They had not even a decent pretence to have challenged Jay. He acted as pri|vate agent to Mr. Wa&s;hington, and the Senate had, in plain ju&s;tice, no more to do with him, than the Pre&s;ident had with his &s;ecretary, Mr. Trumbal.</P>
<P>But farther, Jay was, upon a different ground, placed beyond the reach of per&s;onal con&s;equences&punc;
<PB N="300" REF="031906_0308_0FEF47982E0670B0">
Admitting that he acted with the wilde&s;t deviation from his orders, yet he neither did nor could do any thing final. If the Pre&s;ident di&s;approved of the treaty, &s;till he had only to refu&s;e it. He could have &s;ent Grenville a copy of his in&s;tructions to evince that Jay had entirely contradicted them. This mu&s;t have been a full apology for his negati|ving the treaty.</P>
<P>There &s;till remained one point of view in which Jay might be regarded as re&s;pon&s;ible. Suppo&s;e that, while he carried on a negociation contrary to the &s;pirit of his orders, the relative condition of the two parties had altered, that Britain had become &s;tronger, and America weaker, or that &s;ome change in the condition of a third party had produced a &s;imilar effect. In that ca&s;e, the Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives might have addre&s;&s;ed the envoy in terms like the&s;e:</P>
<P><Q>It is true that you acted as an immediate agent for the Pre&s;ident, that he had legal authority to employ you, and that he, along with the Senate, has taken upon him&s;elf the total re&s;pon&s;ibility for your conduct. In common matters an employer, by vindicating his agent, <HI>completely covers him from enquiry;</HI> but, in your affair, there is &s;ome|thing particular to be &s;aid. We <HI>believe</HI> that you di&s;obeyed your orders, that you treacherou&s;ly en|tangled the Pre&s;ident in a bargain for which you had no powers, and that you thus forfeited that impunity annexed to the character of HIS agent. He received your production with every feeling of &s;hame, of alarm, and indignation. Agreeable to law he a&s;&s;embled the Senate; and they and he &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively ratified the treaty, under the dread that if they rejected it, their perfidious and formidable enemy would pervert their refu&s;al into a pretence for declaring war. So &s;tanding the ca&s;e, we con|tend
<PB N="301" REF="031906_0309_0FEF45DD0566EB58">
that in &s;ub&s;tantial equity, you have not been the agent of Mr. Wa&s;hington, but of lord Gren|ville; and that the compul&s;ive operation created by your perfidy on the minds of the Senate and Pre&s;ident, transferred the con&s;titutional re&s;pon&s;i|bility from them to you. The charges here made again&s;t you are matters of &s;trong &s;u&s;picion, but not of certainty. We are in want of evi|dence either to &s;upport or to refute them. We can only get that evidence by re&s;orting to your in&s;tructions, for you can only be <HI>impeached</HI> on the head of having di&s;obeyed them, and of your di&s;o|dienee having thereafter &s;hackled the delibera|tions of the Pre&s;ident and Senate. For the pur|po&s;e of a&s;certaining your guilt or innocence, we are going to &s;olicit the Pre&s;ident. He has &s;ent the&s;e papers to the Senate. He cannot, therefore, in common civility, or even decency, deny our reque&s;t. Yet we have no con&s;titution|al right of demanding the paper. The power of <HI>making treaties</HI> has been exclu&s;ively and jointly ve&s;ted in the Senate and in him. No part of the con&s;titution requires that he &s;hould explain to our hou&s;e his motives, or divulge, unle&s;s by his own free will, your in&s;tructions and &s;ub&s;equent corre&s;pondence. If he withholds the&s;e means of information and impeachment, we can only grum|ble into &s;ilence, and blu&s;h at the contemptible in|cen&s;e of adulation that, for &s;even years pa&s;t, we have piled on the altar of Mount Vernon.</Q></P>
<P>The above is apprehended to contain a &s;ummary of the arguments that might have been employed in favour of impeaching Jay. The &s;tre&s;s lies on a&s;|certaining that the Pre&s;ident di&s;liked the treaty, and gave it a reluctant ratification. On this point, Ran|dolph affords a copious evidence. <Q>My opinion," &s;ays Mr. Wa&s;hington, "re&s;pecting the treaty, is
<PB N="302" REF="031906_0310_0FEF93EC9229F2B8">
the &s;ame now that it was, that is, <HI>not favourable to it,</HI> but that it is better to ratify it in the man|ner the Senate have advi&s;ed, than to &s;uffer matters to remain, as they are, un&s;ettled.&mdash;I find endea|vours are not wanting to place it in <HI>all</HI> the odious points of view of which it is &s;u&s;ceptible, and in &s;ome which it will not admit.</Q> [This is plain enough.] <Q>I have never, &s;ince I have been in the admini&s;tration of the government, &s;een a cri&s;is, which in my judgment has been &s;o pregnant of intere&s;ting events, nor one from which more is to be apprehended: whether viewed on <HI>one &s;ide or the other.</HI>&mdash;Scarcely a day pa&s;&s;ed, that he (the Pre&s;ident) did not <HI>enumerate many objections to it;</HI> objections going not only to the commercial part, but al&s;o to the Canada article,&mdash;to the omi&s;&s;ion of compen&s;ation for the negroes and property plundered, and to &s;ome other parts of le&s;s con&s;e|quence.</Q> It would be u&s;ele&s;s to heap up farther te&s;timony that the Pre&s;ident di&s;approved of Jay and his treaty, and that he agreed to it only to prevent &s;ome wor&s;e con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Having &s;ettled this point, we proceed with the journal of the Repre&s;entatives. On the 7th of March, 1796, the hou&s;e took up a re&s;olution mo|ved by Mr. Living&s;ton. It was in the&s;e words:</P>
<P><Q><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> that the Pre&s;ident of the United States be reque&s;ted to lay before this hou&s;e, a copy of the in&s;tructions to the mini&s;ter of the United States who negociated the treaty with the king of Great Britain, communicated by his me&s;&s;age of the fir&s;t of March, together with the corre&s;pondence and o|ther documents relative to the &s;aid treaty, except|ing &s;uch of &s;aid papers as any exi&s;ting negociation may render improper to be di&s;clo&s;ed.</Q> As one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Randolph, p. 35, 36, 38.</NOTE>
<PB N="303" REF="031906_0311_0FEF479C4E4820C0">
rea&s;on for this motion, Mr. Living&s;ton &s;aid that the production of the papers would determine the hou&s;e whether <Q>an impeachment would be deem|ed advi&s;eable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bache, vol. i. p. 4.</NOTE>.</Q> But his chief rea&s;on was <Q>a firm conviction that the hou&s;e were ve&s;ted with a di&s;cretionary power of carrying the treaty into effect, or refu&s;ing it their &s;anction. To guide them in an enlightened determination as to that point, the papers are nece&s;&s;ary; they would cer|tainly throw light upon the &s;ubject, and enable the hou&s;e to determine whether the treaty was <HI>&s;uch</HI> as that it ought to be carried into effect<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bache, vol. i. p. 4.</NOTE>.</Q> Mr. Living&s;ton calls the latter his <HI>principal</HI> rea&s;on. He did not &s;peak exactly what he thought. The papers called for could not be needful to guide the determination of the hou&s;e, as to whether they &s;hould &s;anction the treaty, for nothing but its indi|vidual merits could decide for or again&s;t it. But, &s;econd, if the papers were needful, the hou&s;e, be|fore this time, had virtually, though not officially &s;een them. They had been lying for &s;ome time on the table of the Senate. Many Repre&s;entatives had gone up &s;tairs and read them, and every member was acquainted with the e&s;&s;ence of their contents. Hence, they could not be wanted for the purpo&s;e of determining an opinion about the treaty, even had its fate re&s;ted on &s;uch a di&s;clo&s;ure.</P>
<P>Mr. Living&s;ton well knew that his former rea&s;on for wanting the papers was almo&s;t equally hollow. He knew, or he well might have known, that an impeachment was <HI>not</HI> advi&s;eable. The &s;equel of the debates di&s;covered the real &s;en&s;e of his party. The project of impeachment was but rarely and faintly dwelt upon. But the democratical mem|bers had other and good rea&s;ons for de&s;iring an of|ficial <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 5.</NOTE>
<PB N="304" REF="031906_0312_0FEF47A025CF88F0">
communication of the in&s;tructions. This would have fixed the perfidy of Jay in departing from them. Popular re&s;entment at his behaviour would have ri&s;en to the highe&s;t pitch. His alledged preceptor, Mr. Hamilton, would have been involved in the clamour. The treaty mu&s;t on fre&s;h grounds, have become an object of jealou&s;y and di&s;gu&s;t; and this addition to the force of its enemies was to have en&s;ured, in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, a refu&s;al of money for its fulfilment.</P>
<P>By an impeachment of Jay, nothing, in common &s;en&s;e, could be expected, but an enormous wa&s;te of time and of congre&s;&s;ional wages, a pernicious and endle&s;s delay in the routine of private bu&s;ine&s;s, and finally, a triumphant acquital of the envoy. In de|fiance of all imaginable te&s;timony, the Briti&s;h trea|ty majority in the Senate were &s;ure to have pro|nounced him guiltle&s;s. Look at their extru&s;ion of Albert Gallatin, at their fraternal embrace of Me&s;&s;. Gunn and Mar&s;hal!</P>
<P>Thus it appears that Mr. Living&s;ton could hope for nothing from an impeachment, and he as little needed the in&s;tructions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the debate of the 21&s;t of March, Mr. Williams ob&s;erved that <Q>for the &s;pace of ten weeks, any member of that hou&s;e might have &s;een them,</Q> Bache, vol i. p. 236. But the great lo&s;s was, that no member could, from &s;uch in&s;pection, venture to quote them in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. He would have been cal|led to order, and obliged to &s;it down.</NOTE> to complete his opinion of the treaty. <HI>That</HI> opinion had been long &s;ince matu|red. It is difficult to keep from &s;miling when we per|ceive an intelligent legi&s;lator &s;tanding up, and give|ing all rea&s;ons but the real one, in defence of his re|&s;olution. The debate la&s;ted, with &s;ome intervals, from the 7th of March to the 7th of April, both in|clu&s;ive; and the report occupies three hundred and eighty-&s;ix clo&s;e printed octavo pages. This is the
<PB N="305" REF="031906_0313_0FEF93F1522CB5C0">
American mode of managing legi&s;lative debates. In a Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons, the que&s;tion could hardly have been protracted beyond &s;ix o'clock on a &s;econd morning.</P>
<P>Mr. William Lyman ro&s;e next after Mr. Living|&s;ton. He defended the re&s;olution. One of his ar|guments was, that po&s;&s;ibly the papers <Q>might throw &s;uch light as to produce a very great degree of unanimity relative to that in&s;trument (viz. the treaty). Such circum&s;tances might po&s;&s;ibly be di&s;clo&s;ed as to reconcile tho&s;e now oppo&s;ed to it, and who might otherwi&s;e remain irreconcilable. If the re&s;olution tended only to this object it was effecting a valuable purpo&s;e.</Q> Mr. Lyman held the treaty in notorious dete&s;tation, &s;o that this argument was mere hypocritical canting. The <HI>unanimity</HI> which he de&s;ired and expected from a production of the papers was not <HI>for</HI> the treaty, but <HI>again&s;t</HI> it. As to impeachment, Mr. Lyman &s;poke not one word. Mr. Giles on the &s;ame &s;ide, follow|ed. He did not contemplate impeachment <Q>as the <HI>probable</HI> i&s;&s;ue, but the information might tend, perhaps, to reconcile tho&s;e now aver&s;e to the in|&s;trument.</Q> This gentleman &s;poke with as little &s;incerity as the two former. We may ob&s;erve how very &s;oon the Madi&s;onians began to file away from their impeachment.</P>
<P>Mr. Murray &s;ucceeded Mr. Giles. He oppo&s;ed the re&s;olution. He denied the right of the hou&s;e to intermeddle in treaties, unle&s;s the&s;e were alled|ged to be <HI>uncon&s;titutional.</HI> He objected the general impolicy of expo&s;ing &s;ecrets of &s;tate. Mr. Murray is a moderate and &s;en&s;ible &s;peaker; but, with all his fondne&s;s for &s;ecrecy, he would certainly have voted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the re&s;olution, if its real object had been to promote the &s;ucce&s;s of the treaty.</P>
<P>Mr. Buck, another friend to Jay, took the &s;ame &s;ide, <Q>but not from an apprehen&s;ion that the pa|pers
<PB N="306" REF="031906_0314_0FEF47A609C2E6C0">
referred to will not <HI>bear the public &s;crutiny,</HI> or from a belief that there would be the lea&s;t re|luctance on the part of the executive to <HI>deliver them.</HI></Q> Here the fir&s;t &s;entence of Mr. Buck's ha|rangue contained two direct untruths. He knew that the papers would not <HI>bear &s;crutiny</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Such as the two cards upon impre&s;&s;ment.

<P>"In all my va&s;t reading," as Dr. Wagtail &s;ays, this pamphlet, both as to &s;tile and matter, is con&s;iderably the be&s;t which has ap|peared either for Jay or again&s;t him. Candid, elegant, comprehen|&s;ive, and conci&s;e, its accuracy gratifies the mo&s;t informed, while its per&s;picuity convinces the plaine&s;t reader. Yet Mr. Dallas has a ma|terial defect. His extreme re&s;erve and delicacy are entirely ca&s;t away upon &s;uch enemies as Wilcocks, Web&s;ter, Curtius, and Camillus, on the &s;tupid malignity too frequent in Mr. Fenno's Gazette, and on the illiterate brutality of the Columbian Centinel.</P></NOTE>. He knew, and and &s;o did every per&s;on in the hou&s;e, that Mr. Wa&s;hington would be a&s;hamed and unwilling to give them up. It was for the&s;e very rea&s;ons, which Mr. Buck &s;et out with di&s;owning, that he oppo&s;ed the re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Thus the combatants went on. They interper&s;ed much extraneous matter, with pretended arguments on each &s;ide, which, as in the five ca&s;es already cited, the orator him&s;elf held in &s;overeign contempt, and which every man who heard him knew that he de|&s;pi&s;ed. Some &s;peeches de&s;erved a better character, but the limits of this volume do not permit farther critici&s;m. At a future time it may be convenient and in&s;tructive to trace the obliquities of congre&s;&s;ional di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. The pompous petulance and I&s;cariot-like malignity of Buck<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A &s;hort memoir of this gentleman, tran&s;mitted from Vermont, has, for the pre&s;ent volume, been laid a&s;ide.</NOTE>, the plau&s;ible &s;tupidity and &s;elf-important ignorance of Sedgwick, the pregnant

vacuity, and elegant loquacity of Harper, often approaching to good &s;en&s;e, yet almo&s;t never get|ting up to it, hold out prominent materials for amu|&s;ing illu&s;tration. But the number of re&s;pectable &s;peakers was greatly &s;uperior to that of &s;uch phan|toms as the&s;e. In general, a member of Congre&s;s hath &s;ufficient prudence either to hold his tongue, or to tell his &s;entiments in a way which does not make him ridiculous.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day, the 24th of March, 1796, a divi|&s;ion took place in a committee of the whole hou&s;e on this re&s;olution to call for Jay's in&s;tructions and corre&s;pondence. It pa&s;&s;ed by &s;ixty-one votes again&s;t thirty-eight. This was a majority unu&s;ual on great political que&s;tions. When &s;ome victim who has been reduced to beggary by the late war, or &s;ome French officer who neglected to call, in due time, for his arrears of pay, has the weakne&s;s to &s;olicit Congre&s;s, a negative pa&s;&s;es with unanimity, or &s;ome|thing like it. But in matters of high political im|port, the majority runs, for the mo&s;t part, very clo&s;e. The re&s;olution pa&s;t in the hou&s;e by &s;ixty-two votes again&s;t thirty-&s;even. On the 25th of March, it was pre&s;ented to the Pre&s;ident. On the 30th, he &s;ent a refu&s;al of the papers. His me&s;&s;age mi&s;quoted and perverted the reque&s;t of the hou&s;e into a po&s;itive <HI>demand,</HI> and then pretended to refu&s;e what had not been a&s;ked<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See American Annual Regi&s;ter, chap. xi.</NOTE>. Their behaviour gave Mr. Wa&s;hington rea&s;on to de&s;pi&s;e them. The de|bates that la&s;ted for eight, ten, or twenty days about an an&s;wer to his annual &s;peech di&s;honoured the whole body. His refu&s;al of the in&s;tructions was to conceal the di&s;obedience of Jay, and his own tamene&s;s in bearing it.</P>
<P>The majority of &s;ixty two ought to have received the me&s;&s;age with &s;ilent di&s;dain, and prohibited their
<PB N="308" REF="031906_0316_0FEF47AABABF90E8">
clerk from in&s;erting it on the journals. Without o&s;ten&s;ible interference they could have &s;ent to pre&s;s a copy of the in&s;tructions. The&s;e would have dar|ted through the new&s;papers with the velocity of lightning. An abortive attempt to conceal this pa|per mu&s;t have en&s;ured its univer&s;al peru&s;al. A vic|tory to the publi&s;hers was the natural con&s;equence. The people would have re&s;ented the di&s;obedience of Jay, the pu&s;illanimous acquie&s;cence of the Pre&s;i|dent, and his ill-concerted &s;cheme for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing in|formation. While they &s;ympathized with the af|fronted repre&s;entatives, a few well written e&s;&s;ays might have matured into effective &s;ervice the germ of indignation; and the treaty and its allies had &s;unk into the du&s;t.</P>
<P>But the majority po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not one man with the re&s;ources, firmne&s;s and activity of colonel Hamilton. The party &s;eemed &s;tudious to di&s;play more than their u&s;ual inferiority of addre&s;s and boldne&s;s. Ne|ver was a critical moment more mi&s;erably ca&s;t away. In&s;tead of a glowing declaration that they contem|ned the refu&s;al, in&s;tead of &s;ome &s;pirited harangues to animate their parti&s;ans without doors, their tre|mulous and trimming mea&s;ures towards a faction who&s;e animo&s;ities are immortal, betrayed their to|tal want of energy, depre&s;&s;ed their friends, encou|raged their enemies, and paved the way for their own approaching downfall. They did not perceive that the public had become tired of the&s;e de|bates, that farther haggling and wrangling would only increa&s;e that di&s;gu&s;t, and rai&s;e the me&s;&s;age to an unmerited importance, and that &s;ilent contempt was the plaine&s;t way to render it de&s;picable.</P>
<P>On the 6th of April two re&s;olutions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See them in Bache's Debates, vol. i. p. 374.</NOTE> were brought forward. The meaning of the fir&s;t was, that the majority, if they could hold them&s;elves together,
<PB N="309" REF="031906_0317_0FEF47AC50BAD258">
would refu&s;e money for fulfilling Jay's treaty. The &s;econd implied, that when the hou&s;e de&s;ired the ex|ecutive to let them have the in&s;tructions, they were not obliged to tell for what purpo&s;e the paper was wanted. Madi&s;on explained and enforced the re|&s;olutions with that &s;uperior knowledge, ingenuity, and eloquence, which have &s;o often illu&s;trated and adorned the tran&s;actions of Congre&s;s. Next day, they were pa&s;t, ayes fifty-&s;even, noes thirty-five. They were not worth one half of the trouble which they co&s;t. To illuminate and brace the minds of the people it would have been better to propo&s;e the &s;triking twenty thou&s;and dollars from the pre&s;i|dent's &s;alary. Mr. Adams, as a premium for his two Briti&s;h negatives, might have been re&s;tricted to twelve dollars per day during the &s;itting of Con|gre&s;s. This is the allowance to a &s;peaker of the repre&s;entatives, a character of more real u&s;e, and who bears more actual drudgery than the Senate and their vice-pre&s;ident put together. Such re&s;o|lutions could not have been carried, but the bare propo&s;al would have conveyed an important hint. A contra&s;t might have been run between an old &s;oldier with the pal&s;y and &s;even dollars and an half per annum, or his widow with &s;ix ragged children, and Mrs. Wa&s;hington go&s;&s;ipping for a whole evening at the national expence, with fifty or an hundred and fifty women, while &s;nuff-mills and &s;ugar-bakeries were ca&s;t idle by the <HI>approbation</HI> of her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Treaties had, within a &s;hort time, been enter|ed into by the United States with Britain, with Al|giers, with Spain, and with tho&s;e Indians whom Wayne defeated at fort Miamis. On the 13th of April, 1796, Mr. Sedgwick moved a re&s;olution that provi&s;ion &s;hould be made for carrying the&s;e treaties into effect. He meant that the hou&s;e ought to vote &s;ums of money for that end, and his view in bundling the whole four treaties into one re&s;olu|tion
<PB N="310" REF="031906_0318_0FEF47ADE25978E8">
was that they might &s;tand or fall together. This re&s;olution produced warm debates. Several amendments were &s;ugge&s;ted and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. Of the&s;e a particular detail can hardly intere&s;t an ordi|nary reader. The whole proceedings have been minutely compiled by Mr. Bache, and de&s;erve to be &s;tudied by every future candidate for a &s;eat in Congre&s;s. For this place, it is enough to &s;et in one luminous point of view the actual objects of the op|po&s;ite parties. The news of the Spani&s;h treaty had been received in America with univer&s;al exultation. It was to open the navigation of the we&s;tern waters, of which the king of Spain had hitherto been the J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ilor. The Indian and Algerine treaties were ra|ther convenient than advantageous, but as their terms gave general &s;atisfaction, no doubt was en|tertained that money would be voted to fulfil them. A refu&s;al was, of nece&s;&s;ity, to &s;ubject the union to immediate piracy and warfare. But it was, in all re&s;pects, quite otherwi&s;e with the Briti&s;h treaty. A general and violent oppo&s;ition had appeared again&s;t it. A complexity of principles was involved in its di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Hitherto, mo&s;t repre&s;entatives had pro|fe&s;&s;ed to di&s;like it, and a delay, or even a rejection, could not rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to produce war, when, by the conque&s;t of Holland, the extirpation of her armies in Europe and the We&s;t-Indies, the &s;car|city of money, and the di&s;content of her people, England was evidently &s;taggering on the brink of ruin.</P>
<P>The &s;cheme of the federal members was to blend the&s;e negociations in one ma&s;s. Their arguments and motives, when &s;tript of the loquacious ma&s;|querade common to both parties, might be expre&s;|&s;ed thus:</P>
<P><Q>We have on the table before us four treaties. Of the&s;e, three are equally acceptable to the whole hou&s;e; but you want to fulfil them, and to reject
<PB N="311" REF="031906_0319_0FEF47BE78A724B0">
the fourth. We are as de&s;irous as you can be for friend&s;hip with Spain, and for peace with Al|giers and the Indians. But our Briti&s;h treaty, that you propo&s;e to de&s;troy, is of infinitely grea|ter importance in our eyes than all the others col|lectively, and the intere&s;t and independence of our country into the bargain. Grenville has adver|ted to you, as American jacobins, and has a&s;&s;u|red the toad-eating Thomas Pinckney that a Bri|ti&s;h army &s;hall, if we reque&s;t it, be &s;ent over to cru&s;h you. But if we reject this treaty, that aid cannot be expected; and that twilight of our po|litical millenium &s;hall be forever extingui&s;hed, while &s;o &s;ignal a defeat on the floor of Congre&s;s will give a mortal blow to the power which we at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;s. Mankind will begin to think and act about us with common &s;en&s;e. They will demand <HI>a publication of the books of the trea&s;ury.</HI> They will no longer pay intere&s;t for forty mil|lions of dollars of dome&s;tic debt to creditors, till they &s;hall have learned <HI>who the&s;e people are?</HI> And whether William Smith, or Izard, or Hillhou&s;e, or Sedgwick, has waded farthe&s;t into the funds? This pro&s;pect is terrible. To avert it we &s;hall fall or conquer by the &s;ide of the treaty. If that cannot be carried, we &s;hall rejoice in blocking up the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, in whetting the tomohawk, in glutting the pirates of Barbary with the plunder of our commerce.</Q></P>
<P>The re&s;olution was negatived. The three trea|ties were agreed to. A &s;econd &s;eries of debates occur|red as to the granting of money for fulfilling Jay's treaty. This ended on the fir&s;t of May, 1796. The appropriations pa&s;t, in committee of the whole, by the ca&s;ting vote of the chairman, Mr. Muhlenberg, the votes of members being forty-eight on each &s;ide. In the hou&s;e, this appropriation pa&s;t by fifty-one
<PB N="312" REF="031906_0320_0FEF47B2A9471BB0">
votes again&s;t forty-eight. Some even of this narrow majority, declared their entire di&s;approba|tion of the treaty. The general zeal excited in its favour, and the probability that the &s;ix per cent. citadel of Connecticut would have bur&s;t into actual rebellion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Supra, chap. 2d. See al&s;o, the &s;pirit of &s;ome people in that &s;tate, in the American Annual Regi&s;ter, chap. 6th.</NOTE>, were forcible rea&s;ons in favour of adop|tion. The multitude and &s;tile of the addre&s;&s;es to Congre&s;s in its behalf were &s;ufficient to make thoughtful members doubtful as to rejecting it. Mr. Muhlenberg has been highly blamed for his vote on this que&s;tion. By an uniform tenor of conduct, &s;ince 1789, he had already offended the oppo&s;ite party beyond all hope of forgivene&s;s. But on this emergency, he preferred the &s;ecurity of internal peace, even to the approbation of his con&s;tituents. He had candidly &s;tated his ideas in &s;everal private meetings of members previous to the final vote.</P>
<P>The &s;e&s;&s;ion ro&s;e on the 1&s;t of June, 1796. Bri|ti&s;h depredations did not, as had been fondly fore|told, cea&s;e after the appropriations had pa&s;t for the treaty. As one of its con&s;equences the French be|gan &s;oon after to di&s;turb our trade. The we&s;tern po&s;ts were, however, delivered up. The general election for Congre&s;s, and that for a Pre&s;ident, the difference between the French mini&s;ter and the Ame|rican executive, were among the chief events which occurred till the next meeting of Congre&s;s, which was on the 5th of December 1796.</P>
