<P>TAKE, dear ob&s;erver of men, from the hand of your unbia&s;&s;ed friend, this te&s;timony of e&s;teem for your genius.</P>
<P>All the world know that this is no flattery; for, in an hundred things, I am not of your opinion; but, in what concerns the knowledge of mankind, we are nearer to one another than any two in ten thou&s;and.</P>
<P>What I give here is the re&s;ult of long experience, matured and confirmed by various and daily application. It will be found, I hope, an u&s;eful book for every cla&s;s of men, from the throne to the cottage. All is not, cannot be, new; but all ought to be true, u&s;eful, im|portant; and much, I tru&s;t, is new and individual.</P>
<P>I give you liberty not only to make improvements, but to omit what you think fal&s;e or unimportant.</P>
<P>The number of rules may appear large, yet it is &s;mall compared to what might have been written; in the mean time you and I, as well as our readers, may find ample employment in &s;tudying the&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IN the following collection of Aphori&s;ms the reader is not to expect a &s;et of maxims compiled from the author's own, or by him &s;elected from the works of others; but an original, meditated and compo&s;ed in the &s;eries here offered during the autumn of <HI>1787,</HI> and trar&s;mitted in the author's own manu&s;cript to the publi&s;her.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the rapidity that attended this work, (and the world know that all this author's works are affu&s;ions,) it will be found to contain what gives their value to maxims&mdash;verdicts of wi&s;dom on the reports of experience. If &s;ome are trui&s;ms, let it be con&s;idered that Sclomon and Hippocrates wrote trui&s;ms: if &s;ome are not new, they are recommended by an air of novelty: if whim &s;hould appear to have dictated others, it was the whim of humanity; and what may be deamed ra&s;h will be found to flow from the fervour of indignant hone&s;ly, or the exultations of benevolence. Acute and per&s;picuous, they are not infected by the cant of &s;ects, or circum&s;cribed by local notions, but general as the pa&s;&s;ions and feelings of the race.</P>
<P>It is the intention of the editor to add another volume of <HI>AMPHORISMS ON ART, WITH CHARACTERS AND EXAMPLES,</HI> not indeed by the &s;ame author, which the reader may expect in the cour&s;e of the year.</P>
