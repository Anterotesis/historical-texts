<P>A man that hath friends, mu&s;t &s;hew him&s;elf friendly.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>FRIENDSHIP is a natural and moral virtue; de&s;irable in every &s;ituation; and one of the neare&s;t and mo&s;t endearing relations &s;ub&s;i&s;ting a|mong mankind. It is the union and &s;ympathy of &s;ouls; and "the medicine of li&s;e." But, like ev|ery other good, it is often abu&s;ed: Hence, &s;carce any thing is more common than the profe&s;&s;ion; or more rare, than the reality of genuine friend&s;hip. "Every friend &s;aith, I am his friend al&s;o: but there is a friend who is only a friend in name."</P>
<P>Friend&s;hip, like mo&s;t other virtues, is pre&s;&s;ed in|to the &s;ervice of all the fa&s;hionable vices; and too often, is a cover for the vile&s;t actions. Such abu&s;e is, indeed, reprobated by all hone&s;t men: yet, however, the bare profe&s;&s;ion of friend&s;hip pa&s;&s;es current with mo&s;t men. <HI>"Sir, I am your friend,"</HI> is given and received, as a polite compliment, where there is no idea of obligation on the one hand; or of dependence on the other. This nominal decep|tion keeps vice in countenance, by rendering it fa|miliar.</P>
<P>Very &s;imilar to this, is that friend&s;hip, extolled by many, which con&s;i&s;ts in not taking plea&s;ure in
<PB N="4" REF="036974_0003_100B46AD0B6A41A8">the misfortune of a neighbour; or, perhaps, in contentment with his pro&s;perity, wherein it does not interfere with their own: that is, they are not di&s;po&s;ed to injure him; or to rejoice in his misfor|tune any further than it may &s;ub&s;erve their own in|tere&s;t. <HI>This,</HI> doubtle&s;s, will be received for friend|&s;hip, when bare humanity &s;hall de&s;erve that title.</P>
<P>The profe&s;&s;ion of friend&s;hip may &s;erve for many vile purpo&s;es. The wi&s;e &s;on of Sirach &s;ays, "There is a companion who rejoiceth in the pro&s;perity of a friend: he is a companion of the table: but, in the time of trouble, will be again&s;t him. Again, Some man is a friend for his own occa&s;ion, and will not abide in the day of thy trouble." Thus, many "ble&s;s their friend with a loud voice, ri&s;ing early in the morning." They have &s;ome purpo&s;es to ef|fect, perhaps, good and laudable in them&s;elves; yet, by no means for the intere&s;t of their neighbor to be engaged in. They, therefore, conceal their ends and de&s;igns from him; and by artful addre&s;s and friendly profe&s;&s;ions, engage his friend&s;hip and a&s;&s;i&s;tance: but, their purpo&s;es being effected, the poor man finds him&s;elf gulled, and the tool of a ma&s;ked villain! To call &s;uch profe&s;&s;ions, <HI>friend&s;hip,</HI> is a pro&s;titution of the term, and burle&s;quing with a witne&s;s. Let me then engage your attention for a few minutes, to the &s;ubject of <HI>real and genuine Friend&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall in the fir&s;t place endeavor, briefly, to characterize a friend&mdash;Secondly, I &s;hall make &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the advantages of having friends&mdash; and la&s;tly, mention &s;ome things, as nece&s;&s;ary to the obtaining and pre&s;erving them.</P>
<P>The character of a friend will in the fir&s;t place claim our attention.&mdash;The leading trait in &s;uch a character is, <HI>Love</HI>&mdash;an e&s;teem and re&s;pect for a|nother on a principle of real affection, ari&s;ing from &s;ome real, or &s;uppo&s;ed worth. Friend&s;hip, is more than bare civility&mdash;a &s;peaking well to, or of a per|&s;on. One who is mo&s;t indifferent, or even an ene|my,
<PB N="5" REF="036974_0004_100B46AE9EF13420">may, out of &s;elf-intere&s;t, or in concurrence with general opinion, &s;ay and do many kind things to, and for a per&s;on, whom they would rejoice to neglect, and even ruin, could they turn it equally to their own advantage. This is the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip, to hide ba&s;ene&s;s of heart. A friend has a &s;imilarity of mental ta&s;te and feeling&mdash;a &s;ympa|thy of &s;oul, which produces the exerci&s;es of ten|der affections and high e&s;teem. And, as e&s;teem implies merit in the object, &s;o the affection and e&s;|teem will be as la&s;ting as the apparent merit, and no longer; for the moment we cea&s;e to perceive merit, we &s;hall cea&s;e to e&s;teem&mdash;the fountain being dried up, the &s;treams will nece&s;&s;arily &s;top flowing.</P>
<P>This love of friend&s;hip, does not &s;uppo&s;e a <HI>com|placency</HI> in all the conduct of our friend. We may be di&s;plea&s;ed with many things, yet feel truly be|nevolent towards him: and &s;uch love will al&s;o cover amultitude of faults, and excite us to many friendly actions concerning, both, his faults and virtues.</P>
<P>This leads me to ob&s;erve, that "a friend loveth at all times"&mdash;he has a fixed principle of benevo|lence in his heart. Trifles will not move him; nor will he for&s;ake us, until we for&s;ake virtue; and even then, his hand will hold us, and his heart bleed for our return. He will not neglect us, nor be our enemy, though he find us imperfect and liable to many errors: He, al&s;o, has his faults, and expects our forbearance with them, and kind con|&s;truction of them. Notwith&s;tanding &s;ome natural, or even moral defects, he will be friendly while he finds that worth and merit which fir&s;t engaged his e&s;teem. <HI>He loveth at all times.</HI> He loveth in health and in &s;ickne&s;s; in pro&s;perity and in adver&s;ity; in our virtues and in our faults; in good and in bad repute. Such a friend, is a <HI>friend</HI> indeed. But that per&s;on who loves in pro&s;perity, and for&s;akes in adver&s;ity&mdash;who loves while he can make us his in|&s;truments of gain, reputation, or plea&s;ure; and
<PB N="6" REF="036974_0005_100B46B12085CA58">then abu&s;es or neglects us, is a <HI>vile wretch and bane of friend&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P>I ob&s;erve again; a friend is confidential&mdash;One, in whom we can cheerfully place explicit and impli|cit faith. Confidence, is the very <HI>&s;oul</HI> of friend|ly &mdash;that, without which, every other friendly qualification will be marred and of little con&s;e|quence. And for this confidence, our friend mu&s;t have good &s;en&s;e, prudence, upright intentions, truth and punctuality: without the&s;e qualifications, we can have no ju&s;tifiable confidence in him. Un|le&s;s he has &s;en&s;e to &s;ee the fitne&s;s and relation of things, and prudence, hone&s;ty, and good faith to arrange and conduct them; our confidence in him, will be <HI>as a broken tooth, or a foot out of joint.</HI></P>
<P>It is utterly impo&s;&s;ible for a fool or a knave to be a faithful friend. Nor can <HI>we</HI> put confidence in a per&s;on given to folly, fal&s;ehood, deceit, equivoca|tion and a ma&s;ked conduct. In &s;uch ca&s;es there can be no &s;afety.&mdash;Among friends there mu&s;t be plain, undi&s;gui&s;ed dealing, and a mutual confi|dence, or el&s;e a rupture. A friend, therefore, is one who ca&s;ts off di&s;gui&s;e, di&s;covers a plain, hone&s;t heart; and approves him&s;elf to be what he profe&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t not only be confidential in matters of &s;pecial privacy, but maintain a uniform probity and &s;incerity through the whole cour&s;e of friendly con|nexion. Such a friend will partake of our joys, our &s;orrows and griefs: his advice, rejoicing, con|&s;olation and reproof will be the expre&s;&s;ions of af|fection. Into the bo&s;om of &s;uch a friend, we can pour our whole heart: it increa&s;es our joys and al|leviates our &s;orrows.</P>
<P>Such was the friend&s;hip between David and Jon|athan; they opened their hearts to each other, and took &s;weet coun&s;el together and we read, that Jonathan loved David, as he loved his own &s;oul. Their mutual affection and confidence were &s;trong, &s;incere and fervent. Hence David's lamentation
<PB N="7" REF="036974_0006_100B46B32B3D8CB0">over his departed friend&mdash;"I am di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for thee my brother Jonathan: very plea&s;ant ha&s;t thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, pa&s;&s;ing the love of women."</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve, once more; a friend has a &s;incere re|gard for our intere&s;t in e&s;tate and reputation. He is not, like many, a mere friend of the table&mdash;full of profe&s;&s;ions, that he may rai&s;e a reputation, or get a living at our expen&s;e. This is pure <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s.</HI> A friend &s;eeks our good as his own&mdash;he loves us as him&s;elf&mdash;he does as he would be done by.</P>
<P>He is not contented with mere profe&s;&s;ions and u&s;ele&s;s wi&s;hes: He approves him&s;elf a friend by his deeds. He does not &s;ay, "Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled;" but does, and gives what is needful. He feels an intere&s;t in our pro&s;perity, health and good name; and endeavors to pre&s;erve and promote them.&mdash;He is always ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t us by his coun&s;els, con&s;olations and charity, as oc|ca&s;ion may require.</P>
<P>He will, al&s;o, encourage others to do us good; and con&s;tantly oppo&s;e our enemies as his own: thus, he divides with us our gain and lo&s;s&mdash;our plea&s;ures and our &s;orrows.</P>
<P>And, &s;o far as he is influenced by divine wi&s;dom and heavenly philanthropy, he will &s;eek to promote our &s;piritual and eternal happine&s;s.</P>
<P>This is a friend indeed, the mo&s;t precious of all worldly acqui&s;itions. With &s;uch a friend, adver&s;i|ty would be tolerable, and pro&s;perity happy. But no worldly good can compen&s;ate the lo&s;s of him. Riches, plea&s;ures and honors are in&s;ipid without the participation of a friend. I come now,</P>
<P>Secondly, To make &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the comforts and advantages of having friends.&mdash; "Thine own friend and thy father's friend for&s;ake not&mdash;Iron &s;harpeneth iron; &s;o a man &s;harpeneth the countenance of his friend." As rational and &s;ocial beings, we wi&s;h for friends and are plea&s;ed
<PB N="8" REF="036974_0007_100B46B4B7D4F030">with them: and truly, without them, &s;ocial life would be dreadful and intolerable! In our friend|&s;hip, we imitate the Divine Author of our holy re|ligion, who went about doing good, was a friend to all, and gave his life for the life of the world. And it is his expre&s;s command, that <HI>we love one another, as he hath loved us.</HI> The friend&s;hip of this world is never enmity to God, unle&s;s, when pre|&s;erred to him, and oppo&s;ed to a li&s;e of godline&s;s. But when formed by nature's law, Chri&s;t's exam|ple and precept, it is the will of heaven, and the benefit and comfort of every man. It is meet and &s;uitable to his &s;tate, in every circum&s;tance of life.</P>
<P>No per&s;on in the world can be comfortable with|out a friend. The high, the low, the rich, the poor, all, have frequent occa&s;ion for a friend.&mdash; Some, for labor&mdash;&s;ome, for coun&s;el&mdash;&s;ome, for rejoicing and amu&s;ement&mdash;&s;ome, for condolence&mdash; and all of us need one for &s;ociability and the vari|ous comforts of life. Indeed, the condition of a beggar on a dunghill, with a friend, is preferable to that of a king on a throne, without one.</P>
<P>Much may be &s;aid upon the advantages and com|forts of friend&s;hip, as manife&s;ted by the ab&s;ence and pre&s;ence of friends; but in &s;uch ca&s;es, our expre&s;&s;ions will not do ju&s;tice to our feelings. Let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that nature points out the nece&s;|&s;ity and plea&s;ures of friend&s;hip. Thus we ob&s;erve children, from two or three years old and upward, form their little attachments and friendly connec|tions: and the &s;orrow they feel at parting from &s;uch friends; or at the di&s;&s;olution of their attachments, very forcibly de&s;cribe the plea&s;ure they felt in them. But as we grow into riper years, our friend&s;hip is connected with other pa&s;&s;ions and other intere&s;ts; and, in many in&s;tances, becomes very advantageous and exceedingly affecting.&mdash;Our feelings, upon the lo&s;s of &s;uch dear friends, teach us the worth of them beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of &s;peech.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="036974_0008_100B71C36CE88560">
And mo&s;t certain it is, no connexion in this life, whether family, civil or religious, can be happy without friend&s;hip. Thus, if we look into family life, where the hu&s;band and wife are very di&s;&s;imilar in their mental ta&s;te, views of intere&s;t, reputation and family government, we &s;hall find confu&s;ion in mo&s;t of their affairs, and di&s;cord in their hearts.&mdash; The children catch the infection, oppo&s;e and quar|rel with each other; and when reproved by one parent, fly to the other for protection&mdash;hard words, perhaps blows, end the fray. I will not call this life hell on earth: let tho&s;e who have tried it, give it a name.</P>
<P>But let us now look into a family of friends, where the hu&s;band and wife are connected by a &s;im|ilarity of mental ta&s;te; a union of hearts; a union of intere&s;t; a union of family government&mdash;Their de&s;igns, are one&mdash;their joys, one&mdash;and their &s;orrows, one&mdash;harmony, &s;miles in all their affairs.&mdash;The children, as branches of the &s;ame &s;tock, receive the &s;ame &s;pirit of union; live in love and friend&s;hip among them&s;elves, and in obedience to their pa|rents. To this de&s;cription, let me add, <HI>vital piety,</HI> and the picture is complete: if Heaven dwells on earth, it is in &s;uch a family! Agreably to which, King David &s;ings, "Behold, how good and how plea&s;ant it is, for brethren to dwell together in uni|ty! It is like the precious ointment upon the hend, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard; that went down to the &s;kirts of his garments; as the dew of Herman, and as the dew that de&s;cended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the Lord com|manded the ble&s;&s;ing, even life for evermore."&mdash; The&s;e examples need no comment; the advanta|ges and comforts of friend&s;hip are apparent.</P>
<P>And &s;hould we turn our thoughts to civil, or re|ligious &s;ociety, &s;imilar ob&s;ervations will apply, in a certain, and intere&s;ting point of light.&mdash;Where
<PB N="10" REF="036974_0009_100B71C5D2816188">the heads and rulers of a people are in union with the body, all their public affairs are readily tran&s;|acted&mdash;peace &s;miles on the whole&mdash;pro&s;perity and increa&s;e crown their friendly endeavours&mdash;God com|mands his ble&s;&s;ing; and they are ble&s;&s;ed indeed.</P>
<P>But very different is the &s;tate of that &s;ociety, which is de&s;titute of friend&s;hip: there, is no charity, and little, or no con&s;idence. The door is open for divi&s;ion, and every evil work; every man has an intere&s;t, and de&s;ign, diver&s;e from his neighbour: Mea&s;ures are di&s;concerted&mdash;ill will ari&s;es&mdash;&s;ociety is broken up&mdash;and they are cur&s;ed in their very ble&s;&s;ings!</P>
<P>We mu&s;t al&s;o notice the bene&s;its of friend&s;hip, with relation to our &s;everal &s;tages of life.&mdash;Youth, have great occa&s;ion for faithful friends, to provide for them&mdash;to protect, in&s;truct, encourage, caution and admoni&s;h them, while entering into the bu&s;y &s;cenes of life.</P>
<P>Middle age, is a time of life, full of cares, trou|bles, and vexations. At this &s;tage, mo&s;t per&s;ons have many, and &s;ome, <HI>peculiar</HI> occa&s;ions for a friend, both in health, and in &s;ickne&s;s; in public, family and per&s;onal concerns.</P>
<P>Old age, commences a &s;econd child-hood, and &s;tands in need of its friends, to attend upon, and provide for it&mdash;to &s;ooth and comfort it, under the burdens of declining years, and the approaches of death.</P>
<P>Different characters, al&s;o, have occa&s;ion for friends. The <HI>good man,</HI> receives great comfort and benefit in the &s;ociety of pious friends: it makes him wi&s;er and better; and ripens him for the enjoyments of the heavenly world.&mdash;And the <HI>wicked man,</HI> may find infinite advantage in having a true friend: it may &s;ave him from great &s;hame and evil in this life; and, perhaps, from eternal &s;hame and mi&s;ery in the world to come.&mdash;The advantages and comforts of
<PB N="11" REF="036974_0010_100B71CC912BB0E0">friend&s;hip, being &s;o immen&s;ely great, naturally lead us to enquire,</P>
<P>Thirdly, what is nece&s;&s;ary to be done, for ob|taining and pre&s;erving friends.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t upon is, the import|ance of forming ju&s;t e&s;timates, and right opinions of our&s;elves, and others. This remark, though read|ily a&s;&s;ented to in theory; is &s;eldom &s;ufficiently re|&s;pected in practice. We are too apt to think higher and better of our&s;elves; and lower of others, than we ought to think. This ca&s;ts an in&s;uperable bar in the way of genuine and pure friend&s;hip&mdash;others can|not, or will not approach us in the character we a&s;|&s;ume; nor will they acknowledge that, which, we allot them. Thus a &s;illy pride re&s;trains our friend|&s;hip, in proper character, towards them; and at the &s;ame time, refu&s;es theirs; or, at lea&s;t, &s;o embarra&s;|&s;es the expre&s;&s;ions of it, that it is of little, or no real value to either of us.</P>
<P>So long as we think higher of our&s;elves and low|er of others than a proper e&s;timate will ju&s;tify, we cannot meet on the ground of mutual and confiden|tial friend&s;hip; for, however de&s;irable a la&s;ting friend&s;hip may be, yet, our &s;elf-conceit exalts us above their reach; and a too mean opinion of them, depre&s;&s;es them below ours. Con&s;equently, what|ever forms of friend&s;hip may take place between us, they will be governed by &s;elf-intere&s;ted motives, not by mutual e&s;teem, and &s;imilarity of ta&s;te: And &s;uch motives cea&s;ing, or being di&s;covered by the other par|ty, friend&s;hip will al&s;o cea&s;e, or, at lea&s;t, degenerate into mere formality.</P>
<P>But friend&s;hip, formed between per&s;ons of &s;imi|lar mental ta&s;tes, and on proper e&s;timates of each other, will be permanent: it is e&s;tabli&s;hed on a ju&s;t and equitable e&s;timation: And nothing can di&s;&s;olve &s;uch friend&s;hip, &s;hort of the real, or &s;uppo&s;ed lo&s;s of the ground of that e&s;timation. Would we, therefore, obtain, or keep friends, we mu&s;t careful|ly
<PB N="12" REF="036974_0011_100B71CFC138E978">form proper e&s;timates of our&s;elves, and of them and act undi&s;gui&s;edly in our e&s;timated characters.</P>
<P>This, &s;ugge&s;ts the importance of being, and feeling friendly to all men. A fair out&s;ide may pa&s;s for a &s;ea&s;on; but will &s;oon wear out, or be di&s;covered: like the way of &s;inners, it is a hard way. Would we do any thing to purpo&s;e, we mu&s;t have the <HI>reality</HI> of friend&s;hip: Love, begets love:&mdash; Friend&s;hip, begets friend&s;hip.&mdash;It is not &s;ufficient, however, that we merely love them that love us&mdash; it is pure &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. Our holy religion requires, that we have the fountain of love in our own hearts; and that we love and do good to all men, e&s;pecially, to the hou&s;ehold of faith, who, if they act in char|acter, are the be&s;t of friends; and as &s;uch, demand the fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip in us.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, notwith&s;tanding, that Chri&s;tian benevolence looks directly to the object it&s;elf; and not to the quality&mdash;the fitne&s;s and &s;uitablene&s;s of it. Complacency in an object, is no way nece&s;&s;ary, to our wi&s;hing and doing well: we can, and ought to love our enemies, and pray for them who de&s;pite|fully u&s;e us. Although we cannot be friends to &s;uch, in the full extent of complacency, intima|cy, and confidence; yet, we may be <HI>real</HI> friends&mdash; re&s;pect their per&s;ons and characters&mdash;do them good to the promotion of their health, honor, and e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Thus we can act the friendly part towards all men; and ought to be, and feel, what we profe&s;s to be. Hereby, we invite them to be our friends, yea, more, we challenge it, for "He that hath friends, mu&s;t &s;hew him&s;elf friendly." But are we &s;elfi&s;h, in&s;incere, equivocal, and di&s;gui&s;ed; merely aiming to love them who love us, and to do good to them who do good to us, we &s;hall &s;oon find our|&s;elves de&s;titute of intimate and faithful friends. Would we, therefore, have good and faithful friends, we mu&s;t maintain a principle of benevolence in our own brea&s;ts; and exerci&s;e it towards all men, in
<PB N="13" REF="036974_0012_100B4668045A0768">their &s;everal characters, &s;tations, and relations in life.</P>
<P>Nor may we forget, that pity and compa&s;&s;ion for others in their di&s;tre&s;s and afflictions, are nece&s;|&s;ary for tho&s;e who wi&s;h for friends.&mdash;This world is a world of &s;orrow: "Man is born unto trouble, as the &s;parks fly upward." We have always oc|ca&s;ion to pity and commi&s;erate our fellow creatures: and it is great comfort to a &s;ocial being, that his neighbours call on him, and &s;ympathize with him, in the days of his calamity. In many ca&s;es, it takes off half the burden; and gives renewed &s;trength to &s;upport the remaining load.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t be remembered, we often have occa|&s;ion not only for an affectionate heart, but al&s;o for an open hand. A very trifle to us, may be a great deal to a neighbour in di&s;tre&s;s. it may &s;ave his life; at lea&s;t, it may &s;ave him many pounds of intere&s;t, and days of &s;orrow. Such a commi&s;eration of our neighbour's calamity, will give us a peace&s;ul mind &mdash;open his heart to friend&s;hip&mdash;excite e&s;teem in others&mdash;and call down the divine benedictions; for to the merciful, the father of mercies will &s;how him&s;elf merciful!</P>
<P>And we may notice further, that as compa&s;&s;ion for the afflicted; &s;o re&s;pect for the good name of others, will have great influence in obtaining and keeping frends.&mdash;We &s;hould always &s;peak well of others, when and wherein, we ju&s;tly can; and nev|er evil, unnece&s;&s;arily, of any one. I &s;aid, <HI>unnece&s;|&s;arily,</HI> becau&s;e the honor of God, and good of &s;o|ciety may, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, call for our te&s;timony again&s;t their vices: but we &s;hould be &s;ilent, and ig|norant of their faults, when we can with propriety.</P>
<P>We all have faults, and are unwilling to have them blazoned abroad. Let us do as we would be done by: this, is the golden rule and the royal law. By keeping the good name of others, we make to
<PB N="14" REF="036974_0013_100B71D49DF21B70">our&s;elves friends; it is their intere&s;t to be &s;o: and a good name may be more than life. Our care to maintain it for our neighbour, will tend to engage his heart in the bonds of genuine friend&s;hip: And, indeed, will do much to mollify the obdurate heart of an enemy, humanize his &s;tubborn &s;oul, and teach him to love and admire our virtue.</P>
<P>And as the good name, &s;o the worldly intere&s;t of men, is dear to them: we mu&s;t, therefore, main|tain their intere&s;t to obtain their friend&s;hip. Very few per&s;ons will forgive, even, an attempt to de|fraud them of their ju&s;t due. They will not ea&s;ily make friend&s;hip with one, who has de&s;ignedly hurt, or attempted to hurt their intere&s;t. By whatever means their intere&s;t is attacked, whether by fal&s;e information&mdash;by oppre&s;&s;ion&mdash;by negligence in bu&s;i|ne&s;s &mdash;by taking advantage of innocence or igno|rance &mdash;by fal&s;e reckoning, weights or mea&s;ures, it will be noted down again&s;t that per&s;on; and will ever lie a heavy bar in the way of pure friend|&s;hip. We mu&s;t maintain the ju&s;t intere&s;t of our neighbour&mdash;give him his ju&s;t due&mdash;and &s;upport his ju&s;t cau&s;e; or we &s;hall neither obtain, nor keep friends.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations may be extended and applied to the &s;piritual and eternal intere&s;t of mankind; e&s;pecially, among tho&s;e who believe in a future &s;tate, and &s;eek after the heavenly inheritance. Among &s;uch, our care and concern to promote their &s;pirit|ual intere&s;t, will have great influence in making warm and la&s;ting friend&s;hips. Such were the friend|&s;hips of the Galatians toward St. Paul: He bears them record, that if it had been po&s;&s;ible, they would have plucked out their own eyes, and have given them to him. Such friend&s;hips are of the pure&s;t kind: they tend through creature comforts, to the &s;upreme good. May they abound more and more in our land!</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="036974_0014_100B71D62334BDB8">
I only ob&s;erve further, that if we wi&s;h for friends we mu&s;t con&s;ult the ea&s;e, comfort and happine&s;s of our fellow-men.&mdash;When people perceive we feel no intere&s;t in their happine&s;s, and take no pains to plea&s;e them; or avoid giving them trouble they in return will not concern them&s;elves about us nor &s;eek or e&s;teem our connexion. But when they find us friendly.&mdash;willing and ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t and oblige, as far as our circum&s;tances will admit: when they find us willing to do, as we would be done by; then, their hearts will be affected, and their love and e&s;teem will flow out towards us. They will make us the kind returns of friend&s;hip, and thus we &s;hall pa&s;s on, mutually a&s;&s;i&s;ting and mutually re|joicing, through the thorny paths of life: and he who drops fir&s;t, will receive on his grave, the friendly tear of heart-felt &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Upon what has been &s;aid, it will be very obvi|ous to remark, that tho&s;e who neglect and di&s;regard friend&s;hip, are guilty of great folly and incon&s;i&s;|tency. &mdash;Is friend&s;hip &s;uch as above de&s;eribed, very mi&s;erable mu&s;t be the condition of tho&s;e, who are de&s;titute of friends. Mankind, by nature, are ex|ceedingly wicked. The lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;t of the eye, and the pride of life, blind our minds, and hurry us into practices cruel, unju&s;t, and inhu|man! &mdash;Natural and moral evils &s;urround us.&mdash;Temp|tations, from without, and from within, a&s;&s;ail us&mdash; and innumerable infirmities of body, and of mind, con&s;tantly attend us.</P>
<P>How very mi&s;erable then is the condition of the friendle&s;s man! He is liable to pain, &s;ickne&s;s and &s;orrow&mdash;he &s;tands alone in the mid&s;t of dangers; and has no confidence in tho&s;e about him&mdash;he is ex|po&s;ed to envy, malice and revenge; and has none to defend him; nor, to give him timely informa|tion, that he may defend him&s;elf. Mankind by na|ture are &s;elfi&s;h; and care not how, or what he &s;uf|fers
<PB N="16" REF="036974_0015_100B71D898C87B80">&mdash;many will rejoice in his misfortune, and take all the advantage which an unprotected law will give them; I &s;ay, <HI>unprotected,</HI> becau&s;e, few will enforce the law in favor of the friendle&s;s man.</P>
<P>Is he de&s;titute of chri&s;tian benevolence in his own brea&s;t, his ca&s;e is &s;till wor&s;e&mdash;there is no &s;ource of comfort left. To God, he will not; and to man, he cannot go. He has no alternative, but either, to &s;ink into de&s;pair and in&s;en&s;ibility; or, to bid de|fiance to the world, &s;hame and cen&s;ure; and run with violence and &s;peed the thorny path of vice, to the goal of infamy and death.</P>
<P>Indeed, &s;uch is the &s;tate of this world, that we could not live in it for any time, unle&s;s we had friends; and the &s;hort &s;pace we might continue, would be a &s;cene of vexation and torment.&mdash;Such is the condition of the friendle&s;s man! And the condition of any man varies from it, but in propor|tion to the number, faithfulne&s;s and influence of his friends. Very ab&s;urd, therefore, are tho&s;e who di&s;regard friend&s;hip, and neglect to make to them&s;elves friends when they can. And when we further con&s;ider the comforts and advantages of having friends; and the very ea&s;y, rea&s;onable and equitable ground on which they may be obtained; we mu&s;t &s;ay, they will die as the fool dieth&mdash;with a glorious prize in their hands, and no heart to im|prove it!</P>
<P>And doubtle&s;s, &s;hould we carry our views no further than this life, it will be mo&s;t comfortable and u&s;eful to have friends; and be friendly. This is evident, from the mi&s;erable condition of the friend|le&s;s man, ju&s;t de&s;cribed: and al&s;o, from the com|forts and advantages of friend&s;hip, with regard to &s;tations, relations, ages and characters, as above.</P>
<P>The wi&s;e preacher of I&s;rael has beautifully touch|ed on both the&s;e con&s;iderations, in his ob&s;ervations on a &s;olitary life.&mdash;"Two are better than one; be|cau&s;e they have a reward for their labor: for if
<PB N="17" REF="036974_0016_100B71DBCE4B2E00">they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe, to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up. Again, if two lie to|gether, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone? And if one prevail again&s;t him, two &s;hall with&s;tand him: and a threefold cord is not quickly broken." Mutual friend&s;hip, is highly u&s;eful and comfortable, in every &s;tation and rela|tion &mdash;it is the cordial of &s;ocial life&mdash;it &s;weetens ev|ery joy, and moderates every grief.</P>
<P>And let me add: it puts us into circum&s;tances for doing and receiving more good. This will have great influence on the benevolent heart, and increa&s;e his plea&s;ures.&mdash;However friendly our&s;elves, yet the want of friends would leave us little oppor|tunity for doing good. It would &s;eldom happen, we could do a kindne&s;s in an acceptable manner: the want of friend&s;hip would bar the kindne&s;s, or charge it to &s;ini&s;ter views; and thus turn our good will into evil. But mutual friends, have always op|portunities of doing good; and that which is more, of doing it an agreeable manner. It is kindly re|ceived and kindly returned. Our friends will &s;peak well of us&mdash;frequently call upon us&mdash;and u&s;e their influence to put us in a way to be u&s;eful to our&s;elves and others. Thus, we &s;hall find an en|larged circle of receiving and of doing good.</P>
<P>In this view, friend&s;hip is not merely a &s;ocial vir|tue, but a&s;&s;umes a higher character; it is a Chri&s;|tian duty, looking forward to the day of account, and to the recompence of reward. It is the bond of union among the &s;ons of God. It excites to diligence in every path of duty: and is acceptable to the Supreme Judge. It gives a peaceful con|&s;cience, and claims alliance to divinity.</P>
<P>This reminds me, that friend&s;hip, in this high &s;en&s;e, re&s;embles Chri&s;t, who is the friend of all men. He was always plea&s;ed in doing good: it
<PB N="18" REF="036974_0017_100B71DFE0F005A8">was his meat and drink. He &s;ought opportunities to &s;how his friend&s;hip, and never avoided any, who were willing to receive it. He was a friend to &s;in|ners &mdash;a friend to his enemies, and gave his life for them. He has left his examples on record, that we &s;hould follow his &s;teps&mdash;do good to all men&mdash; and if occa&s;ion &s;o require, lay down our life for the brethren.</P>
<P>Thus our friend&s;hip will re&s;emble the Divine Ex|ample, and obey that injunction, which he has laid on all his followers, to manife&s;t their love for him, by loving one another, as he hath loved them. Friend&s;hip, in this &s;en&s;e, is the di&s;tingui&s;hing char|acteri&s;tic of all Chri&s;t's followers. In vain we talk of our religion without it. Little can be expected from our profe&s;&s;ions, unle&s;s we have a principle of divine love in our hearts.</P>
<P>There is, indeed, a friend&s;hip as above, ari&s;ing from &s;imilarity of mental ta&s;te, and various &s;ecular motives&mdash;highly u&s;eful in its kind, and altogether nece&s;&s;ary for a tolerable life in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things. But it is not that friend&s;hip which delights in doing good, for goodne&s;s &s;ake: It is at be&s;t, but an external and faint re&s;emblance of that friend|&s;hip, which was eminently in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and which it is our duty and glory to imitate in heart and life.&mdash;Friend&s;hip, in this high &s;en&s;e, expre&s;&s;es our love and obedience to him, who is eminently &s;tiled LOVE. It is the badge of our Chri&s;tian pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and a very material evidence of our title to eternal life.&mdash;May God grant that the &s;ame mind of friend&s;hip &s;hall live and abide in us, which was al&s;o in Chri&s;t Je&s;us!</P>
<P>Finally, may the con&s;ideration that friend&s;hip re|&s;embles heaven, excite all of us to a friendly con|ver&s;ation. That world is a world of love: All is peace and harmony. God is love. Chri&s;t is love. Saints and angels dwell in love: And all their wor|&s;hip and employments, are expre&s;&s;ions of love.
<PB N="19" REF="036974_0018_100B71E244580B98">No evil pa&s;&s;ions di&s;turb their minds: No cro&s;s in|tere&s;ts &mdash;no envy&mdash;no di&s;cord can ever enter into that world of peace. All are friends to God&mdash; friends to Chri&s;t&mdash;and friends to one another.</P>
<P>This is the happine&s;s, we profe&s;s to hope for. This is the heaven, we are profe&s;&s;edly met to &s;eek after. Let us &s;eek with an heavenly temper&mdash;love to God and man. We mu&s;t be friendly here, or depend upon it, my hearers, we &s;hall never meet friendly there.</P>
<P>How &s;hocking to the benevolent &s;oul, is the too frequent practice of mankind, in this re&s;pect! How do they profe&s;s a hope of a friendly meeting in heaven, and yet, go wrangling all the way there! How many expre&s;s an expectation of joining before the throne of God, in eternal hallelujahs; yet, when they meet here, acco&s;t each other in the mo&s;t uncivil, profane and opprobious language!&mdash;De|pend upon it, &s;uch tempers can never enter the peaceful man&s;ions of the God of love.</P>
<P>Let us be wi&s;e for our&s;elves and put on friend&s;hip &mdash;drop all divi&s;ions, animo&s;ities and wrangling; and live in peace and love. Would we go to heav|en, we mu&s;t put on the heavenly temper, while here; and love one another as Chri&s;t hath loved us. Thus &s;hall we grow up into a meetne&s;s for that kingdom of peace&mdash;No bitter reflections will har|row up our &s;ouls at death.&mdash;We &s;hall depart in favor with God and man.&mdash;Shall exchange a &s;tate of imperfect friend&s;hip, for a &s;tate of perfect love. &mdash;And &s;hall join the friendly &s;ociety of heaven, to celebrate in eternal prai&s;es, the friend&s;hip of our Divine Friend, who hath loved us with an everla&s;t|ing love&mdash;a <HI>love,</HI> &s;tronger than death! AMEN.</P>
