<HEAD>Mr. PRESIDENT, GENTLEMEN of the SOCIETY, GENTLEMEN, and FELLOW STUDENTS,</HEAD>
<P>I SHOULD be ungrateful indeed, did I not with Plea&s;ure, em|brace this Opportunity to commemorate the Munificence of our Royal Benefactor. For, as far as I can trace back the Scenes of Life, or recal the fleeting Ideas of my Childhood, the&s;e Walls, reared by the pious Hands of William, have &s;heltered me in my infant Studies. I am well aware, that I &s;hall &s;ink in the Attempt, but I depend on your Benignity to &s;upport me: I am con&s;cious al&s;o, that it requires an Apelles to pourtray an Alexander; but &s;hould I be fortunate enough, to drop, during this E&s;&s;ay of Youth, any Thing, worthy your Attention, I &s;hould exclaim, <GAP DESC="foreign">, with more than Aegyptian Joy, as having found my Reward in the Approbation of the Learned.</P>
<P>"Heaven," &s;ays Pope, "fir&s;t taught Letters for &s;ome Wretch's Aid, &s;ome bani&s;h'd Lover, or &s;ome captive Maid:" But &s;urely then only are they equal to their Dignity, when they "rai&s;e the Genius and mend the Heart." The Tears of the Macedonian, as he &s;tood by the Tomb of Sigeum, flowed from a Sen&s;e of his unhappy Fate, in wanting a Homer to celebrate his Actions: But how had he wept, how mi&s;erable had he been, if he had thought, that the bolde&s;t Flights of Genius, like the Leaves of the Sybil, mu&s;t have been given to be di&s;per&s;ed by the Winds? How had the Glory of Antiquity peri&s;hed in hopele&s;s Oblivion, had not Letters interpo&s;ed to perpetu|ate its Exi&s;tence? Without their Aid, in vain had the Poet &s;ung the Anger of Pelides, or Pa&s;&s;ion of Agamemnon: In vain painted the Horror of Impiety in Diomede, wounding a Divinity, or cautioned again&s;t the delu&s;ive Witchery of Fortune, by pre&s;enting Hector, now exulting over Patroclus vanqui&s;hed, now dragged in Triumph round the Trojan Wall. Without their Aid, we never had beheld Aeneas, bending under the Weight of filial Duty, Phar&s;alia had never ri&s;en to our View, to di&s;play the Havock of Ambition, nor had the di&s;&s;olute A&s;&s;yrian been prepared for Death by the written Herald of his approaching Ruin. Through them the Wi&s;dom of

Greece, of Rome, of the whole World, pa&s;&s;es before us in one con|tinued Mirrour, Ages, long elap&s;ed, reflect a &s;earching Light upon tho&s;e which are to come, and the Divine Indulgence commi&s;&s;ions us to be happy, by thus revealing the My&s;teries of Learning. Con&s;ider! Man comes into the World, a naked, helple&s;s Animal, free from Bia&s;&s;es of every Kind: Con&s;ider! He cannot remain in a State of Neutrality. He may indeed, while Vice in&s;inuates on this, and Virtue awes on that, Side, in the Intervals of He&s;itation put on the Smile of Revelry to one, and &s;ickly over his divided Looks with Melancholy to the other, but mu&s;t &s;hortly, like Herculus, determine on the Path, as each &s;u&s;pects the Influence of its Rival. Vice is daily reinforced with Millions: Even Cu&s;tom her&s;elf has enli&s;ted under its Banner. Let it but wave the Crim&s;on Standard, Fancy, with all her Train, comes fluttering around: Let it but give the Bla&s;t for the nocturnal Orgy, Intemperance, Debauch, and Lu&s;t gam|bol in the Van, while Di&s;ea&s;e and Mi&s;ery follow in the Rear. Amid &s;uch Tumult and Di&s;order, where &s;hall Virtue find a Friend? Should &s;he &s;trive to mix with the Croud, by them &s;he is pu&s;hed back with Contempt: Should &s;he retire from factious Strife, &s;he is proclaimed the chimerical Exi&s;tence of a di&s;tempered Brain. Becau&s;e &s;he al|lures them not to the Shores of Ruin, by the Songs of Guile, the Young are too apt to con&s;ider her Habitation, as the Exclu&s;ion of all Joy. But let them recur to Learning, their Prejudices will be re|moved, they will know how to prize that which is e&s;timable. Whether we be ver&s;ed in metaphy&s;ical Speculations, or contemplate the Wonders of the material World, we &s;hall reap the&s;e Advantages. If we re&s;ign our&s;elves to the former, they will teach us "to ab&s;tract, extend, and &s;piritualize our Ideas," will render us &s;uperior to the en&s;naring Nets of Sophi&s;try, will qualify us to unveil Fal&s;hood in Di&s;gui&s;e, to trace Sceptici&s;m in its Labyrinth of Subterfuges, and oppo&s;e Truth to the laboured Di&s;qui&s;itions of fal&s;e Refinement.</P>
<P>But while the Hand of Science detects to our Eye, the connecting Fibres as it were, and vital Principles of Nature, while we explore the &s;everal Properties of Matter in all its primary Forms, and artificial Combinations, we are capacitated for inhancing the Com|forts
<PB N="7" REF="012210_0005_0F8A1B46473100E0">
and Means of Life. Then, then indeed! we turn our Eyes up to the Heaven of Heavens, ha&s;te to di&s;tant Planets, and de&s;cry other Sy&s;tems. In the Laws which govern their Revolutions, we admire unbounded Goodne&s;s, in the Forces, which retain them in their Orbits, Almighty Power. Mere Sen&s;e circum&s;cribes the Views of none but the ignorant, the Terms of Space we here can never know; for to us new Firmaments now ari&s;e, new Suns now kindle up to our Imagination, in infinite Succe&s;&s;ion, "in regular Confu&s;ion, and we hail thee, O GOD,
<Q><L>"Father of all, in ev'ry Age,</L>
<L>"In ev'ry Clime ador'd,</L>
<L>"By Saint, by Savage or by Sage,</L>
<L>"Jehovah, Jove, or Lord."</L></Q></P>
<P>Yet Virtue di&s;dains no Heart which is open to her Reception. She may be found under the Cottages of Ignorance, as well as amid the buzzing Schools of Letters. Nay, I will add, that &s;he may ex|i&s;t independent of Learning, that the thoughtle&s;s Clown oftimes po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es more Probity than the &s;kilful Critic. But, when the Statuary's Chizzel has hewn off the formle&s;s Ma&s;s, that encumbered the latent Figure, when it has given Strength of Features, Elegance of Shape, and Expre&s;&s;ions of Life, how far does this poli&s;hed Marble di&s;claim all Connection with the Rudene&s;s of its kindred Quarry?</P>
<P>It is you, fair Science, who touched Confu&s;ion into Order, and &s;purred into Action "the lethargic Powers of the human Brea&s;t." Before the Days of Literature, though the Secretions of Matter had exhibited the Form of a World, the Savagene&s;s of Mankind &s;eemed to continue, the Anarchy of Chaos. Uncertain of his Den, "the &s;ad Barbarian" roved from Field to Field, "fought the fierce, tu&s;ky Boar for his Acorn Meal, and where the de&s;cending Night overtook his wearied Steps, there he laid him down, to refre&s;h him&s;elf for the Morrow's Conte&s;t. While the "mixed Tempe&s;ts" of the Winter, forbad the Chace, while the leafle&s;s Tree denied her Fruit, and the general Pul&s;e of Nature &s;eemed benumbed, whither could he betake him&s;elf for Amu&s;ement, whither fly for Su&s;tenance, how re&s;cue his
<PB N="8" REF="012210_0006_0F8A1B48145B0770">
active Limbs from motionle&s;s Torpidity? A Friend he knew not: The "tender Ties of Relation&s;hip" could not bind the boi&s;terous Soul of Licentiou&s;ne&s;s, untutored by the Precepts of Learning. He was "de&s;olate in Crouds," and how could Solitude afford him the Companion of the Scholar. Wor&s;e than the Bea&s;ts of Prey, he cared not for Futurity, and mu&s;t have &s;tarved in emaciating Penury, had he not rifled the Stores of the Brutes. But it was Di&s;cipline, which taught him to melt at another's Woe, to &s;ympathize with another's Joy, and forgive the ungenerous Robbery of his Birth|right. It was &s;he, who called out from amid the Woods, and Wilds of Nature, the uncivilized Herd of Men, changed their "blood-polluted Furr into the woolly Ve&s;tment," and united them by com|mon Intere&s;ts, and &s;ocial Laws.</P>
<P>But if the Sluggard &s;till clings to his downy Bed, if Intractibility, cannot now be &s;oothed to Application, and Folly &s;till rebels a|gain&s;t its Happine&s;s, behold! the Hand of Maje&s;ty extending the Laurel to reward, and the Trumpet to proclaim. Whither have the Monuments of Roman Glory vani&s;hed, like fanta&s;tic Vi&s;ions? Whither the Child of Ju&s;tice?&mdash;Numa is gone to "hide his dimini&s;hed Head." Whither the willing Victims to their Country's Safety? Decius, Paulus, and Curius fall a ready Prey to Oblivion. Whither the Patron of Learning?&mdash;Ha&s;t thou fled, Augu&s;tus? Indeed: And "blu&s;hing drops his Wreath" at the more illu&s;trious Name of Wil|liam. The fortuitous Title of Inheritance often &s;erves as a Ladder, upon which Demerit may climb up to Honours, and the Crown, though thrice refu&s;ed, is but a doubtful Evidence of Sincerity. Yet William challenged not the Preference under the Sanction of the Na&s;&s;au Race, but under the Protection of the Na&s;&s;au Virtues. Nor did he buy the Devoirs of a Para&s;ite to make a Parade of his Integrity, but under the Shield of Innocence defied the Shafts of Calumny. What is it to us, that no Foot&s;teps of victorious Rage were left in his Camp, no Tincture of Monarchal Pride &s;tained his Royal Purple, and, when with eager Ha&s;te he thunderedon the Foe, with eager Ha&s;te he lent the Hand of Mercy to rai&s;e him up? The
<PB N="9" REF="012210_0007_0F8A1B48C72888E8" MS="y">
Horror of Bellona &s;hocks the Solemnity of this Day, and the milder Influence of Minerva demands the Character of William, as free from the Bu&s;tle of martial Life.&mdash;It &s;hines with the Eclat of more than Roman Virtue, unclouded by Roman Vice. Nature &s;eems to have reanimated him with all the Glory of his Ance&s;try. The Ra|vages of Super&s;tition began to lo&s;e their Force and Fury, when this Prince embarked in the Cau&s;e of Religion. Numerous Con|&s;piracies were projected, numerous Snares laid again&s;t his Life: But the Favour of Heaven put forth a Star to lead him into the Path of Security, gave him Power to tread upon the young Lion, and the Adder, and look! What&s;oever he hath done, it hath pro&s;pered.</P>
<P>The Flowers, which, without his Care, had blu&s;hed un&s;een, he tran&s;planted into this his own fair Garden: The latent Gem, which &s;oon had mouldered into Du&s;t, is here prepared to glitter on the Crown: Nay, the Fount is here &s;truck out, where the Mu&s;es choo&s;e to inhabit. Cadmus in&s;tructed Greece in Letters, and Greece was grateful: Triptolemus fir&s;t opened to the a&s;toni&s;hed World the Trea|&s;ures of the teeming Field, and the a&s;toni&s;hed World demon&s;trated their Gratitude by following his Example: But can we, the Off|&s;pring of his Care, mention the Name of William, and not be en|raptured with his Prai&s;e? Dare we not, with heart-felt Joy, admire his Virtues, his amazing Virtues? Methinks I read in the Looks of this infant Throng a De&s;ire to &s;peak, methinks, they all unite their Voices, and dictate to me, what they feel. "How happy," &s;ay they, "are we under the Shadow of the Royal Wing? It matters not to us, though "the World be made for Cae&s;ar," provided we can find a Refuge in the Royal Favour. To him it is perhaps owing, that the &s;avage Indian is not now defiling this holy Spot, exulting in barbarous Triumph over his captive Fellow Creature, pinioned at the Stake of Slaughter, and panting with an impious Thir&s;t after the unhappy Victim's Blood. Even the Briti&s;h Lions felt the Great|ne&s;s of their Charge: William and Mary, the unalienable Object of his Love, were entru&s;ted to their Care. No Medean Charm could &s;tupify their Vigilance: The golden Fleece of Heaven re&s;ted in impregnable

Security. The Art of Raphael might picture the un&s;unned Snow, as an Emblem of Cha&s;tity, or paint the &s;peaking, corre&s;pondent, Glances of the Eye, as Symbols of true Affection; but Invention it&s;elf would be baffled in its Attempts, to rival her Innocence, or the tender Regard of their united Hearts, by Fable or Allu&s;ion."</P>
<P>But alas! how frail, how fickle is the State of &s;ublunary Things! how like the tran&s;ient Colours of the fleeting Bow! And yet we fooli&s;hly imagine, that Summer Scenes can bloom amid the Storms of Winter, give our&s;elves Credit for the Morrow, and with the Fal|con &s;oar in the empty Space of Hope, till the Object of our Prey eludes us. "Fair laughed the Morn:" Wrapt in plea&s;ing Fancy, we fondly thought, as Heaven had re&s;tored to us a William in a Nor|borne, &s;ome Guardian Angel would have warded off the fatal Blow. This &s;weet Deception played before our Eyes in all its fairy Mazes, led us from Scene to Scene, pictured Joy behind, Joy in endle&s;s Per|&s;pective, till at la&s;t the Enchantment cea&s;ed, when we heard the Knell of our Friend, our Pattern, our Botetourt. We beheld him pale, as afflicted Patience on a Monument. We touched the Hand, which once &s;moothed the rugged Pillow of Di&s;ea&s;e: 'Twas cold. We clo&s;ed the Eye, that once &s;hed the pitying Tear: 'Twas quenched. The Voice which once infu&s;ed Balm into the wounded Spirit, now &s;poke no more. Man! fooli&s;h Man! does thy Heart exult, &s;hould Fame herald the abroad, the Hero of thee Age, &s;hould animated Bu&s;ts be|&s;peak a pompous Parentage, or gilded Roofs receive thee, as their Lord! For a Moment &s;top thy Career, approach, where Berkley lies, approach where Berkley is intombed, and &s;ee the Vanity of human Expectations. This great Man&mdash;great let me call him&mdash;was placed on the Pinnacle of Admiration. He had Wealth, &s;ufficient to glut even Avarice it&s;elf, and Titles to lull a&s;leep the mo&s;t re&s;tle&s;s Ambition. But he coveted Riches, merely to con&s;ecrate them by a proper U&s;e, he de&s;ired Authority, only to enforce his Example, and what he wi&s;hed for he received, as the golden Cen&s;er receives its Frankincen&s;e, to "&s;pread a &s;acred Gale of Ble&s;&s;ings around on all." He kept his Eyes, &s;teadfa&s;t on the End, and Aim, of his Being:
<PB N="11" REF="012210_0009_0F8A1B4A495B91A0">
from his Piety, his Pre&s;ence, our &s;acred Chapel derived a daily Lu&s;tre, and, though his Attention to the Commands of his Maker could not di&s;arm Death of his Power, yet at lea&s;t did it di&s;arm him of his Terrors. He thought him&s;elf, as yet, but an Embryo in Exi&s;tence, and that he then only was entering on the Theatre of Life, when Fate drew up the Curtain of Futurity. "The Almighty &s;poke." The Scene is pa&s;t, and weeping Science, ab&s;orbed in Woe, pays the la&s;t Tribute of her Gratitude, a Tear. She &s;tretches forth the Laurel, but the Laurel droops: The baleful Cypre&s;s with its fu|nereal Gloom &s;addens the &s;ilent Vault. There we &s;aw him interred, there committed to the Du&s;t, and, while De&s;pondence &s;at on every Face, in the pealing Anthem, the pen&s;ive Look, the broken Sigh, you read, you heard, that Berkley was no more. But in vain do we weep for him, &s;ince
<Q><L>"The dread Path once trod,</L>
<L>"Heaven lifts its everla&s;ting Portals high,</L>
<L>"And bids the pure in Heart behold their GOD."</L></Q></P>
<P>But, my Fellow Students, how can we better &s;olace our&s;elves for the Lo&s;s of our Friend, than by endeavouring not to need him?&mdash; What avail the hidden Trea&s;ures of the Mine, if fettered Indolence di&s;&s;uade you from the Que&s;tion? What avails the yellow Harve&s;t, if the Hu&s;bandman denies his Sickle? "Bea&s;t, Bird, Air, Fire, the Heavens, the rolling Worlds, all Nature lives by Action." Nothing lies at Re&s;t, but Death, and Ruin, nothing can purcha&s;e Ea&s;e, and Quiet, but Indu&s;try, and Per&s;everance. "Who would &s;uffer the Slings, and Arrows of outrageous Fortune, who would bear the Whips, and Scorns of Time, the Oppre&s;&s;or's Wrong, the proud Man's Contumely, or groan, and &s;weat under a weary Life, but that the Hopes of an undi&s;turbed A&s;ylum for impotent Old-Age, cheered his drooping Spirits in the round of Mi&s;ery?"&mdash;"The Heart-Ache, and the thou&s;and natural Shocks, which Fle&s;h is Heir to," daily prove the In&s;ufficiency of earthly Bli&s;s, and Rea&s;on bids us crop its Plea&s;ures, as we pa&s;s through this Vale of Tears. But before we can enjoy them, we mu&s;t labour to know, where they bloom, how
<PB N="12" REF="012210_0010_0F8A1B4B05DC61A8" MS="y">
to unma&s;k the Deceit of Ruin, which bri&s;tles with its Bed of Thorns, di&s;gui&s;ed by the fal&s;e Appearance of the Ro&s;e. Con&s;ult your Brea&s;ts, and tell me, if Plea&s;ure lies in the Smiles of Beauty: Tell if the precious Moments of Mortality were intended to be &s;acrificed at the Shrine of Lu&s;t, or if Duty injoins us to tread in the Foot&s;teps of the Brutes. This cannot be your Creed, the&s;e cannot be your Wi&s;hes. You are rea&s;onable Beings, and can therefore &s;teel your&s;elves again&s;t the envenomed Dart. Envenomed indeed; for, like the deadly Pre&s;ent of Ne&s;&s;us, it burns, and burns, and will for ever burn. Whither then &s;hall we &s;eek for Plea&s;ure? In the brimming Goblet? &mdash;In the brimming Goblet &s;eek for De&s;truction: In the brimming Goblet lay down the Di&s;tinction of Humanity, and in the midnight Revel call forth the Bea&s;ts to a&s;&s;ociate with their new Relation. For, can the blu&s;hing Cup afford one cordial Drop to Remor&s;e, give an Opiate to Pain, and "&s;teep the Sen&s;es in Forgetfulne&s;s?" It may cheat us of our Remor&s;e, it may cheat us of our Pain, as we quaff the lu&s;cious Potion; yet in the End it does but di&s;&s;olve a Pearl which the combined Wealth of the World cannot repurcha&s;e, it does but open new Sources of Mi&s;ery, ru&s;hing with redoubled Force. Let us not put it to the Trial: Let not the Examples of tho&s;e, who have mi&s;carried, &s;peak with as little Credit as the Prophe&s;ies of Ca&s;&s;andra, and thus will Youth arrive at true Philo&s;ophy, real Plea&s;ure, and &s;olid Happine&s;s. Ari&s;e, renounce the Errors of your Age, and ap|prove your&s;elves worthy of Royal Patronage. If pa&s;t Hours have e&s;caped, unimproved, quit not the pre&s;ent Opportunity, but, like the holy Patriarch, cla&s;p the parting Angel to thy Bo&s;om, until he ble&s;s thee. Let future State&s;men, future Lawyers, future Divines here &s;pring up, but &s;uch State&s;men, &s;uch Lawyers, &s;uch Divines, as &s;hall &s;trive to do Honour to their Family, their Country, and this, their <HI>Alma Mater.</HI></P>
