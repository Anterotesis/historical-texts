<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have a peculiar claim to an addre&s;s from the authors of the Cri&s;is, and it &s;hall be our bu&s;ine&s;s in this paper to pre&s;erve, if po&s;&s;ible, the peri&s;hable infamy of your names.</P>
<P>The motion made by Lord Radnor, on Monday the 27th of February, concerning number III. of the Cri&s;is, was unju&s;t and villanous, the paper contains nothing but the mo&s;t &s;acred truths, and therefore could not be a fal&s;e or &s;candalous libel; the amendment of the epithet trea&s;onable, pro|po&s;ed and &s;upported by the Lords Pomfret, Suf|folk, Ap&s;ley and Sandwich, was infamous, and of a piece with every other proceeding of the pre&s;ent
<PB N="58" REF="013961_0002_0F925B1A02E84340">reign, and pre&s;ent mini&s;try. It &s;hewed, in a parti|cular manner, the bloody minded di&s;po&s;itions of pro&s;tituted Court Lords, the in&s;truments of murder and public ruin. The immaculate Lord Sandwich in&s;i&s;ted that the word trea&s;onable &s;hould &s;tand part of the motion, as a proper foundation for bringing the authors to exemplary and condign puni&s;hment. Suppo&s;e, my Lords, this infamous amendment to the Radnor motion had been car|ried, and it had &s;tood a fal&s;e, &s;candalous and trea|&s;onable libel, could the mere <HI>ip&s;e dixit</HI> of a few venal Lords make that trea&s;on, which in the lite|ral or con&s;tructive &s;en&s;e of the word was not &s;o.</P>
<P>The author of number III. is perfectly well acquainted with the &s;tatute of trea&s;ons, pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of Edward the IIId. and likewi&s;e with the various expo&s;itions and interpretations of it. He well knew, the paper was written upon the true principles of the Revolution, and that it could be ju&s;tified by the laws of the land; he well knew (though there is hardly any villany but what court &s;ycophants may do with ea&s;e) that it was not in the power of Lord Mansfield, with all his chica|nery, with all his artifice, with all his abu&s;e of the law, with all his perver&s;ion of ju&s;tice, with all the aid of fal&s;e con&s;truction, and forced inuendos, to bring it within the meaning of that &s;tatute; he well knew the di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;overeign and his mini|ons, and that nothing would, or can &s;atiate royal Scotch, or mini&s;terial revenge, but the blood of tho&s;e who oppo&s;e the pre&s;ent mo&s;t horridly cruel, and mo&s;t infamou&s;ly wicked mea&s;ures of govern|ment; and, my Lords, he well knew the &s;hocking pro&s;titution of hereditary peerage, and the bare|faced treachery and villany of a purcha&s;ed majority in the Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="013961_0003_0F925B1AB89BE9B0">
Has there not, my Lords, been innocent blood enough &s;hed in this reign, that your Lord&s;hips &s;hould &s;till thir&s;t for more. Why &s;hould your Lord&s;hips be &s;o de&s;irous of &s;topping every channel of public information, the infamy of your actions are &s;ufficiently known, and will be handed down to the late&s;t ages of time, while your names will &s;tink in the no&s;trils of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The &s;tatute of trea&s;ons, my Lords, pa&s;&s;ed in the 25th year of the reign of Edward the IIId. was an act of va&s;t importance to the public weal; for till then, there was hardly a word &s;poke, or a paper written, but what was deemed trea&s;on, and the parliament, which pa&s;&s;ed it, were called <HI>Bene|dictum Parliamentum,</HI> the Ble&s;&s;ed Parliament.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tance of this &s;tatute is branched out by my Lord Cooke into &s;ix heads, which we &s;hall here give, with &s;ome ob&s;ervations of our own, to &s;hew your Lord&s;hips, and the world, that number III. of the Cri&s;is is not within the meaning of either of the&s;e heads, and that by your amended motion you de&s;igned to lay the ground work of a pro&s;ecution, the mo&s;t cruel and infamous ever car|ried on in this country, wor&s;e than tho&s;e which, without proof or the colour of guilt, took away the lives of the great Lord Ru&s;&s;el, and Algernoon Sidney.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t head is concerning death; by compa&s;|&s;ing or imagining the death of the King, Queen, or Prince, and declaring the &s;ame by &s;ome overt deed. By killing or murdering the Chancellor, Trea&s;urer, Ju&s;tice of either Bench, Ju&s;tice in Eyre, Ju&s;tices of A&s;&s;ize, Ju&s;tices of Oyer and Terminer, in their places, during their offices.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="013961_0004_0F925B1BB5AE7268">
The &s;econd, is to violate, that is to know car|nally, the Queen, the King's elde&s;t daughter un|married, the Prince's wife. The third is levying war again&s;t the King.</P>
<P>The fourth, is adhering to the King's enemies, within the realm or without, and declaring the &s;ame by &s;ome overt act.</P>
<P>The fifth is, counterfeiting the Great, the Privy-Seal, or the King's coin.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth and la&s;t, by bringing into this realm counterfeit money, to the likene&s;s of the King's coin.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. To compa&s;s and imagine, is to contrive, de&s;ign, or intend the death of the King; but this mu&s;t be declared by &s;ome overt act, declaring by an open act a de&s;ign to depo&s;e or impri&s;on the King, is an overt act, to manife&s;t the compa&s;&s;ing his death. I believe, my Lords, the author of num|ber III. of the Cri&s;is is not under the predicament of this expo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Second. By the word King is intended, 1. A King before his coronation, as &s;oon as ever the crown de&s;cends upon him; for the coronation is but a ceremony. 2. A King <HI>de facto,</HI> and not <HI>de jure,</HI> is a King within this act, and trea&s;on again&s;t him is puni&s;hable, though the right heir get the crown.</P>
<P>Third. Note, It is very &s;trange, but in the printed &s;tature book, it is there &s;aid, <HI>probably at|tainted,</HI> which is a gro&s;s error; for the words of the record are, <HI>et de ceux provablement &s;oit attaint,</HI> and &s;hall be thereof provably attaint; and it is amazing to me that &s;o gro&s;s a mi&s;take &s;hould be &s;uffered, &s;ince my Lord Cooke has &s;o expre&s;&s;y ob|&s;erved the difference in the&s;e words following, 3.
<PB N="61" REF="013961_0005_0F925B1FD39B8030">In&s;t. fol. 12 In this branch, &s;aith he, four things are to be ob&s;erved. 1. This word <HI>(prova|blement)</HI> provably, that is upon direct and manife&s;t proof, not upon conjectural pre&s;umptions, or in|ferences, or &s;trains of wit, but upon good and &s;ufficient proof; and herein the adverb <HI>(provable|ment)</HI> provably hath great force, and &s;ignifieth a direct and plain proof; and therefore the offender mu&s;t provably be attainted, which words are as forcible as upon direct and manife&s;t proof. Note, The word is not probably, for then <HI>commune ar|gumentum</HI> might have &s;erved, but the word is pro|vably be attainted. 2. The word attaint nece&s;&s;a|rily implieth that he be proceeded with, and at|tainted according to the due cour&s;e of law, and pro|ceedings of law, and not by ab&s;olute power, or by other means, as in former times had been u&s;ed; and therefore if a man doth adhere to the enemies of the King, or be &s;lain in open war again&s;t the King, or otherwi&s;e die before the attainder of trea&s;on, he forfeiteth nothing, be|cau&s;e (as the act &s;aith) he is not attainted; where|in this act hath altered that, which before this act, in ca&s;e of trea&s;on, was taken for law. And the &s;tatute of 34 Ed. III. &s;ayes nothing to the King, but that which was in <HI>e&s;&s;e,</HI> and pertaining to the King at the making of that act. And this appear|eth by a judgment in parliament in ann. 29, H. VI. that Jack Cade, being &s;lain in open rebellion, could no ways be puni&s;hed, or forfeit any thing, and therefore was attainted by that act of high trea|&s;on. 3. Of open deed, <HI>per apertum factum,</HI> the&s;e words &s;trengthen the former expo&s;ition of <HI>(prova|blement)</HI> an overt act mu&s;t be alledged in every in|dictment upon this act, and proved compa&s;&s;ing by
<PB N="62" REF="013961_0006_0F925B2008A46ED0">bare words is not an overt act, as appears by ma|ny temporary &s;tatutes again&s;t it. But there mu&s;t be &s;ome open act, which mu&s;t be manife&s;tly proved. As if divers do con&s;pire the death of the King, and the manner how, and thereupon provide wea|pons, powder, poi&s;on, harne&s;s, &s;end letters, and the like for the execution of the con&s;pirators. If a &s;ubject con&s;pire with a foreign Prince, to invade the realm by open ho&s;tility, and prepare for the &s;ame by &s;ome overt act, this is a &s;ufficient overt act for the death of the King. 4thly, A con&s;pi|racy is had to levy war, this is no trea&s;on by this act, until it be levied, therefore it is no overt act, or manife&s;t proof of the compa&s;&s;ing the death of the King within this act, for the words are <HI>de ceo, &amp;c. thereof,</HI> that is, of the compa&s;&s;ing of the death. The wi&s;dom of the makers of this law would not make bare words to be trea&s;on, &s;eeing &s;uch variance commonly among the witne&s;&s;es, about the &s;ame, as few of them agree together.</P>
<P>In the preamble of the &s;tatute of 1 Mar. (con|cerning the repeal of certain trea&s;ons declared after this &s;tatute of 25 Edw. IIId. and before that time, and bringing all things to the mea&s;ures of this &s;ta|tute) it was agreed by the whole Parliament, that laws ju&s;tly made for the pre&s;ervation of the com|monwealth, without extreme puni&s;hment, are more often obeyed and kept than laws and &s;tatutes made with great and extreme puni&s;hments, and in &s;pecial &s;uch laws and &s;tatutes &s;o made, whereby not only the ignorant and rude unlearned people, but al&s;o learned and expert people, minding hone&s;ty, are often times trapped and &s;nared, yea many times for words only, without other fact or deed done or perpetrated. Therefore this act of the 25th
<PB N="63" REF="013961_0007_0F925B2119935148">Ed. IIId. doth provide that there mu&s;t be an overt act. 5thly, As to trea&s;on, by levying war again&s;t the King we mu&s;t note, that though con|&s;piring or compa&s;&s;ing to levy war, without a war <HI>de facto,</HI> be no trea&s;on, yet it may con&s;pire a war, and only &s;ome few actually levy it, all are guilty of the trea&s;on. Rai&s;ing a force to burn or throw down a particular inclo&s;ure is only a riot, but if it had been to have gone from town to town, to throw down all inclo&s;ures, or to change religion, or the like, it were levying of war, becau&s;e the in|tended mi&s;chief is public. Holding a fort or ca&s;tle again&s;t the King's force is levying war. 6th, Counterfeiting the Great or Privy Seal is trea|&s;on, but it mu&s;t be an actual counterfeiting there|of, compa&s;&s;ing to do it is no trea&s;on; affixing the Great Seal by the Chancellor without warrant, is no trea&s;on; fixing a new Great Seal to another pa|tent is great mi&s;pri&s;on, but no trea&s;on, being not counterfeiting within this act; but aiders and con|&s;enters are within this act. 7th, Trea&s;on concern|ing coin is counterfeiting the King's coin; and this was trea&s;on at common law, and judgment only as of petty trea&s;on; but clipping, &amp;c. being made trea&s;on by other &s;tatutes, the judgment is to be drawn, hanged and quartered. Money here extends only to the proper money of this realm. 8th, As this &s;tatute leaves all other doubt|ful matters to be declared trea&s;on in parliament, but not to be puni&s;hed as &s;uch, till &s;o declared. So in &s;ucceeding Kings reigns abundance of other matters were declared trea&s;on, which being found very grievous and dangerous by the &s;tatute 1 Mar. it is enacted, that thenceforth no act, deed or offence, being by act of parliament or &s;tatute, made trea&s;on, petty trea&s;on, or mi&s;pri&s;on of trea&s;on,
<PB N="64" REF="013961_0008_0F925B2178B0B9D0">by words, writing, cyphering, deeds otherwi&s;e however, &s;hall be taken, had, deemed or adjudged to be high trea&s;on, petty trea&s;on, or mi&s;pri&s;on of trea&s;on, but only &s;uch as be declared and expre&s;&s;ed to be trea&s;on, petty trea&s;on, or mi&s;pri&s;on of trea|&s;on, by this &s;tatute of 25 Edw. IIId.</P>
<P>Here we re&s;t the matter, my Lords, convinced the author of Number III. is not within the mean|ing of this &s;tatute, nor any expo&s;ition of it, and that the de&s;ign of your Lord&s;hips, in adding the epithet trea&s;onable, was wicked, ba&s;e and infa|mous, and will be &s;ure to &s;ecure to you the con|tempt and dete&s;tation of every hone&s;t man.</P>
