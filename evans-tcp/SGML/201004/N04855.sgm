<HEAD>A general PREFACE giving &s;ome Account of the AUTHOR, and the following Pieces.</HEAD>
<P>TO oblige the Reader, I would give a brief Ac|count of the very pious, judicious and renown|ed <HI>Author</HI> of the following Pieces, from &s;ome of the be&s;t Authorities.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> tells us, He was born at <HI>Towce&s;ter</HI> near <HI>Northampton</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> Nov. 5. 1605; went to the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Cambridge</HI> when he was 15 Years of Age; was there converted to God in 1624, and took his Degree of Ma&s;ter of Arts; afterwards engaged in the Mini&s;try; &s;et Sail from <HI>Harwich</HI> in <HI>England</HI> for <HI>New-England</HI> in the latter End of 1634, but by a great Storm was driven and forc'd to land at <HI>Yarmouth</HI> in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and liv'd the Winter at <HI>Ba&s;twick</HI> in that County; in the Spring of 1635 went up to <HI>London;</HI> in <HI>July</HI> &s;ailed from <HI>Grave&s;end;</HI> Oct. 3, arrived at <HI>Bo&s;|ton;</HI> whence in a Day or two his Friends at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> who had come before, gladly fetched him, and he be|came their Pa&s;tor till he died.</P>
<P>But at pre&s;ent, waving his Life and Character by <HI>that learned Writer;</HI> I &s;hall now rather give the Reader a &s;horter Hi&s;tory drawn by tho&s;e Rev. and famous Men, Mr. <HI>William Greenhill</HI> of <HI>London</HI> and Mr. <HI>Samuel Mather</HI> of <HI>Dublin;</HI> (the latter at our <HI>Cambridge</HI> having lived divers Years under his Mini&s;try) in their <HI>Preface</HI> to Mr. <HI>Shepard</HI>'s Sermons of <HI>Ineffectual hearing the Word,</HI> and <HI>Subjection to Chri&s;t in all his Ordinances,</HI> publi&s;hed at <HI>London</HI> in 1657, as follows&mdash;</P>
<Q><PB REF="006067_0003_10274FD851184C08">
<P>Concerning the <HI>Author;</HI> it were worth the while to write the Story of his Life.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to &s;peak in his Commendation: <HI>His Works prai&s;e him in the Gates.</HI> They that knew him, knew he had as real Apprehen&s;ions of the Things of God, and lived as much with God and with his own Heart, and more, than the mo&s;t of Chri&s;tians do.</P>
<P>He had his Education at <HI>Emmanuel College</HI> in <HI>Cam|bridge</HI> [in <HI>England.</HI>] The Conver&s;ion and Change of his Heart was wrought betimes when he lived in the Univer&s;ity, and enjoyed Dr. <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI>'s Mini&s;try: Whereby God had the very be&s;t and Strength of his Parts and Years for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When he was fir&s;t awakened to look after Religion, having before &s;wam quietly in the Stream of the Times, he was utterly at a Lo&s;s which Way to take; being much mole&s;ted with Sugge&s;tions of <HI>Athei&s;m</HI> (in the Depths whereof <HI>Junius</HI> was quite lo&s;t for a Time) and moved and tempted to the Ways of <HI>Famili&s;m</HI> al&s;o. He read the Books of <HI>H N</HI> among the re&s;t; where meeting with this Pa&s;&s;age, <Q>That a Chri&s;tian is &s;o &s;wallowed up in the Spirit, that what Action &s;oever the Spirit moves Him to, &s;uppo&s;e Whore|dom, he may do it, and it is no Sin to him;</Q>&mdash; <HI>This was enough:</HI> For being again&s;t the Light of natural Con&s;cience, it bred in him an utter Abhor|rency of tho&s;e loo&s;e and vile Ways and Principles e|ver after. This Advantage he al&s;o had, that Doctor <HI>Tuckney</HI> was then his Tutor; whom he acquainted with his Condition, and had his Direction and Help in tho&s;e mi&s;erable Fluctuations and Straits of his Soul. Happy is the Man who&s;e Doubtings end in E&s;tabli&s;h|ments: <HI>(Nil tam certum quam quod de Dubio certum)</HI> But when Men arrive in <HI>Sceptici&s;m</HI> as the la&s;t I&s;&s;ue of all their Debates and Thoughts of Heart about Re|ligion, it had been good for &s;uch if they had never been born.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="006067_0004_102750271B8CDB40">
After his Heart was changed, it was ob&s;erved, that his Abilities of Mind were al&s;o much enlarged; <HI>Di|vinity,</HI> though it be chiefly the Art and Rule of the <HI>Will</HI> yet rai&s;ing and perfecting the <HI>Under&s;tanding</HI> al&s;o: Which we conceive came to pa&s;s by this Means, that the Fear of God fixed him and made him &s;erious, and taught him to <HI>meditate,</HI> which is the main Im|provement of the Under&s;tanding. Therefore &s;uch as came to him for Direction about their Studies, he would often advi&s;e <HI>to be much in</HI> MEDITATION: Profe&s;&s;ing, <HI>that having &s;pent &s;ome Time in Meditation every Day in his Beginning-Times, and written down his Thoughts, he &s;aw Cau&s;e now to ble&s;s God for it.</HI></P>
<P>He was a&s;&s;igned to the Work of the Mini&s;try at a &s;olemn Meeting and Conference of &s;undry godly Mini&s;ters about it: There were to the Number of <HI>Twelve</HI> at the Meeting, who&s;e &s;olemn Advice was, that he &s;hould <HI>&s;erve the Lord in the Go&s;pel of his Son;</HI> wherein they have been the Salvation of many a Soul: For upon this he addre&s;t him&s;elf to the Work with that Reality and Seriou&s;ne&s;s in wooing and winning Souls, that his Word made deep Impre&s;&s;ions, and &s;el|dom or never fell to the Ground.</P>
<P>He was <HI>Lecturer</HI> a while at <HI>Earles-cone</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> which we take it was the fir&s;t Place of his Mini&s;try: where he did much Good: And the People there, though now it is long &s;ince and many are gone, yet have a very precious and deep Remembrance of him, of the mighty Power of God by him to this Day. [i. e. 1657] But [Dr.] <HI>W. Laud</HI> then Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lon|don</HI> &s;oon &s;topt his Mouth and drove him away, as he did many other godly Mini&s;ters from <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> at the &s;ame Time. After this he lived at <HI>Butterchrome</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> at Sir <HI>Richard Darley</HI>'s Hou&s;e, till the In|iquity of tho&s;e Times hunted him thence al&s;o. Then he went to <HI>Northumberland,</HI> 'till &s;ilenced there al&s;o.</P>
<P>And being thus mole&s;ted and cha&s;ed up and down
<PB N="4" REF="006067_0005_10274FDC31E7D930">
at <HI>Home,</HI> he fled to <HI>New-England;</HI> and after &s;ome Difficulties and Delays by great Storms and Di&s;a&s;ters at Sea upon the Sands and Coa&s;ts of <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> which retarded his Voyage till another Year, he arrived there at la&s;t; where he was Pa&s;tor to a precious Flock at <HI>Cambridge</HI> about <HI>Fourteen Years.</HI></P>
<P>His Manner of Preaching was clo&s;e and &s;earching, and with Abundance of Affection and Compa&s;&s;ion to his Hearers. He took great Pains in his Prepa|rations for his Publick Labours; accounting it a cur&s;|ed Thing to do the Work of the Lord negligently: And therefore &s;pending u&s;ually <HI>Two</HI> or <HI>Three whole Days</HI> in preparing for the Work of the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> had his Sermons fini&s;hed u&s;ually on <HI>Saturday</HI> by Two of the Clock. He hath &s;ometime expre&s;t him&s;elf thus in publick;&mdash; <Q><HI>God will cur&s;e that Man's Labours that lumbers up and down in the World all the Week, and then upon</HI> Saturday <HI>in the</HI> Afternoon <HI>goes to his Study; when as God knows that Time were little en|ough to pray and weep in, and to get his Heart in Frame,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> He affected <HI>Plainne&s;s</HI> together with <HI>Power</HI> in Preaching; not &s;eeking Ab&s;tru&s;ities, nor liking to hover and &s;oar aloft in dark Expre&s;&s;ions, and &s;o &s;hoot his Arrows, as many Preachers do, over the Heads of his Hearers.</P>
<P>It is a wretched Stumbling-Block to &s;ome, that his Sermons are &s;omewhat &s;trict, and as they term it le|gal. Some Souls can reli&s;h none but meal-mouth'd Preachers, who come with &s;oft and &s;mooth and tooth|le&s;s Words: <HI>(By&s;&s;ina verba by&s;&s;inis viris:)</HI> But the&s;e Times need <HI>humbling Mini&s;tries,</HI> and ble&s;&s;ed be God that there are any: For where there are no <HI>Law-Sermons,</HI> there will be few <HI>Go&s;pel-Lives;</HI> and were there more <HI>Law-Preaching</HI> by the Men of Gifts, there would be more <HI>Go&s;pel-Walking</HI> both by them&s;elves and the People. To preach the <HI>Law,</HI> not in a forc'd affected Manner, but wi&s;ely and powerfully, together
<PB N="5" REF="006067_0006_10275029EE3C8858">
with the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> as Chri&s;t him&s;elf was won't to do; (<HI>Mat.</HI> v. and el&s;ewhere) is the Way to carry on <HI>all Three together;</HI> [viz.] <HI>Sen&s;e of Mi&s;ery,</HI> the <HI>Application of the Remedy,</HI> and the <HI>Returns of Thankfulne&s;s and Duty.</HI> Nor is any Doctrine more comforting than this humbling Way of God, if rightly managed.</P>
<P>His Sickne&s;s began with a &s;ore Throat, and then a Quin&s;y, and then a Fever, whereof he died, <HI>Aug.</HI> 25. 1649. This was one Thing he &s;aid upon his Death-Bed; "LORD, <HI>I am vile, but thou art righteous:</HI>" And to tho&s;e that were about him, he bid them; <HI>Love</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>dearly; That little Part that I have in him, is no &s;mall Comfort to me now.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Thus far tho&s;e Rev. and Eminent Men, Mr. <HI>William Greenhill</HI> and Mr. <HI>Samuel Mather</HI> in 1657. By Mi&s;take indeed they &s;uppo&s;e Mr. <HI>Shepard</HI> was 46 or 47 Years old when he died: For preci&s;ely &s;peaking, he was but 43 Years, 8 Months, and 20 Days. So great a Pro|gre&s;s did he make in Sanctity and divine Knowledge; and in the mid&s;t of many Mole&s;tations and abundant mini&s;terial Labours, he compo&s;ed and did &s;o much, and grew in &s;uch E&s;teem and pious Fame, in &s;o &s;hort a Time; that I cannot but reckon him one of the ad|mirable Men of his Age.</P>
<P>On this Occa&s;ion, I would recite a Paragraph in the Life of the very Rev. Mr. <HI>James Fra&s;er</HI> of <HI>Brea</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> publi&s;hed at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> in 1738; as follows&mdash; <Q>The Lord hath ble&s;&s;ed the Reading of <HI>Practical Writings</HI> to me; and thereby my Heart hath been put into Frame, and much Strength and Light got|ten: Such as <HI>I&s;aac Ambro&s;e, Goodwin,</HI> Mr. <HI>Gray,</HI> and very much by <HI>Rutherford</HI>'s above others: But mo&s;t of all by Mr. <HI>Thomas Shepard</HI> of <HI>New-England</HI> his Works; he hath by the Lord been made the <HI>Interpreter one of a Thou&s;and;</HI> &s;o that under CHRIST I have been obliged to his Writings as much and more than to any Mean whatever, for wakening,
<PB N="6" REF="006067_0007_10274FE05951C408">
&s;trengthening and enlightening my Soul; the Lord made him a Well of Water to me in all my Wilder|ne&s;s Straits.</Q></P>
<P>Both the <HI>Two former</HI> of the following Pieces, viz. The <HI>Fir&s;t Principles</HI> and <HI>Select Ca&s;es,</HI> were publi&s;hed together in one Book, fir&s;t at <HI>London</HI> and then at <HI>Endin|burgh</HI> in 1648. They have been al&s;o printed &s;ince at divers Times in both tho&s;e Cities, and always went to|gether. But all have many Mi&s;takes, both in <HI>Figures, Words,</HI> and e&s;pecially <HI>Pointings</HI> that much ob&s;cure the Sen&s;e and puzzle the Reader: All which, from the two fir&s;t Editions mentioned, with two others both at <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> upon comparing them together, I have &s;o corrected; that <HI>this,</HI> which as far as I find, is the fir&s;t in <HI>America,</HI> is the mo&s;t correct Edition extant. But in the <HI>Letter</HI> containing the <HI>Ca&s;es,</HI> for the Reader's clearer View, I have taken the Liberty to in&s;ert the <HI>Titles of the &s;everal Ca&s;es and Que&s;tions,</HI> as they here appear in <HI>Italica</HI> at the Heads of their &s;everal Subjects. In the <HI>Title-Pages</HI> of the two fir&s;t Editions, the <HI>Letter;</HI> is &s;aid to be &s;ent from <HI>New-England</HI> to a Friend in <HI>Eng|land:</HI> Yet by &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages at the Beginning and End, which I have <HI>italica'd,</HI> compared with the Ac|counts above, it plainly appears, 'twas wrote in <HI>England</HI> a little before his coming away, and probably at <HI>Ba&s;t|wick</HI> in the Spring of 1635.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Diary</HI> &s;ucceeding&mdash;That it is the genuine Compo&s;ure of this excellent Divine, appears from an old <HI>Manu&s;cript</HI> found at <HI>Cambridge</HI> above <HI>Thirty Years</HI> ago, and a&s;cribed to him as in the <HI>Title-Page:</HI> As al&s;o from this further Evidence, that the Sentiments, the Spirit, the Stile and Manner of Expre&s;&s;ion are intirely Mr. <HI>Shepard</HI>'s; and whoever will take the Pains to compare this with his Sermons on the <HI>Parable of the Ten Virgins</HI> and other Writings, will clearly &s;ee their exact Similitude: And above all yet, that Dr. <HI>Cotton Mather,</HI> in drawing Mr. <HI>Shepard</HI>'s Life, about <HI>Fifty
<PB N="7" REF="006067_0008_1027502D1BD52AF8">
Years</HI> ago, had this Part at lea&s;t of the Diary before him, from whence he has tran&s;cribed &s;everal Para|graphs: As of <HI>Dec.</HI> 1. 1640; <HI>Mar.</HI> 19, <HI>April</HI> 10, <HI>July</HI> 10, <HI>Aug.</HI> 15, <HI>Oct.</HI> 10, and <HI>Nov.</HI> 3, 1641. But the Re&s;t were never publi&s;hed 'till now.</P>
<P>And here it is an Act of <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> to con&s;ider, that the Rev. Author penning the&s;e <HI>retired Meditations</HI> only for <HI>his own private U&s;e;</HI> we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, he did not write with &s;o much Guard and Correctne&s;s of Expre&s;|&s;ion as if he were preparing for the publick View: or he would no Doubt have rectified &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages and rendered them more clear and accurate. Yea tis likely they would have appeared more correct and clear, if we could have found the <HI>Author's Manu&s;cript.</HI> The <HI>equitable</HI> and much more the <HI>candid</HI> Reader will there|fore make ju&s;t and kind Allowances. And the very Name of Mr. <HI>Shepard</HI> is enough to recommend the&s;e his <HI>private Thoughts</HI> to tho&s;e who have read his Writ|ings, are &s;eriou&s;ly concerned for their Salvation, and a|fraid of being deceived in Matters of eternal Moment.</P>
<P>As for a further Account of the <HI>Diary;</HI> &s;ee the ex|cellent <HI>Preface</HI> immediately before it. And though the Rev. <HI>Writer,</HI> from his &s;ingular Mode&s;ty, forbid his Name to be &s;ub&s;cribed; yet being now decea&s;ed, I may take the Freedom to tell the Reader, it was that extraordinary Per&s;on, Mr. <HI>David Brainard;</HI> who died the 9th <HI>Current,</HI> in the 30th Year of his Age, to the great Grief of tho&s;e who knew him, both among the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI></P>

<P>THIS holy Letter of that ready <HI>Scribe</HI> of Chri&s;t's Kingdom, [Mr. <HI>Shepard</HI> of <HI>New-England</HI>] is &s;o full of Grace and Truth, that it needs no other Epi&s;tle commendatory than it &s;elf.</P>

Coun&s;ellor, to give you the &s;pirit of revela|tion; and that after you have &s;uffered, a while by the&s;e outward temptations, doubts, fears, de&s;ertions, di&s;tractions, which the Letter men|tions, he would make you perfect, &s;tabli&s;h, &s;trengthen, and &s;ettle you. And this I verily think will be the unexpected, yet happy, joy|ful and mo&s;t glorious end of them: For &s;ince I have ob&s;erved and &s;een the lamentable ruins of the &s;oul, and &s;eeming graces of many men, by being rock'd a&s;leep in a quiet &s;till calm, ea&s;y performance of duties; without &s;uch a|waking temptations and tumults within, which it &s;elf complains of: I &s;ay &s;ince I have ob|&s;erved what a deal of mud is in the bottom of &s;uch &s;tanding Pools, and what a deal of filth is in &s;uch Motes, which are inwardly at ea&s;e, and not emptied from ve&s;&s;el to ve&s;&s;el; next unto the donation of the Lord Je&s;us to a man, I have accounted &s;uch tumultuous heart-&s;torms and uproars, together with the fruitful &s;trange effects of them, the &s;econd mercy.

<HEAD><HI>CASE I.</HI> Of ordering the Thoughts in Civil Employments.</HEAD>
<P>Your <HI>fir&s;t Trouble</HI> is, concerning your <HI>di&s;|turbances in Civil affairs,</HI> by the &s;ecret injection of <HI>religious thoughts;</HI> &s;o that you know not how to follow the one, without hazard of grieving the &s;pirit, and breaking your peace, in not maintaining and nouri&s;hing at the &s;ame time the other: and hence being drawn to go two ways at the &s;ame time, which you cannot well do, your heart is di&s;quieted, and your peace much interrupted.</P>
<P>This of yours, puts me in mind of the com|plaint of an hone&s;t, yet plain man, to an able Mini&s;ter once, who in bewailing his condi|tion to him, among other mi&s;eries, this was not the lea&s;t; <HI>(viz)</HI> that he was exceedingly troubled with good thoughts, &s;o that he could not follow his place, unle&s;s very oft he did &s;tand &s;till and pray, for fear of grieving the Spi|rit, (as he thought) and lo&s;ing his &s;ea&s;on of being heard in heaven: For &s;aid Con&s;cience oft unto him, How do&s;t thou know but this may be thy accepted time, and if thou do&s;t not take it, it may be thou &s;halt never have it again? I have forgot the Mini&s;ter's an&s;wer; but I am &s;ure in the&s;e complaints you go not alone: I have lately known one very able, wi&s;e, and godly, put upon the Rack in the&s;e kind of thoughts, by him, that envying God's people's peace, knows how to change him&s;elf
<PB N="4" REF="006067_0018_10274FED6299A2B0">
into an Angel of light. For it being his u&s;ual cour&s;e in the time of his health, to make a Diary of his hourly life, and finding much be|nefit by it, he was in con&s;cience pre&s;t by the power and delu&s;ion of Satan, to make and take the &s;ame daily &s;urvey of his life in the time of his &s;ickne&s;s; by means of which, he &s;pent his enfeebled &s;pirits, ca&s;t on fuel to fire his &s;ickne&s;s: and had not a friend of his covin|ced him of his erroneous con&s;cience, mi&s;lead|ing him at that time, he had murderd his body, out of con&s;cience to &s;ave his &s;oul, and to pre&s;erve his grace. And do you think the&s;e were the motions of God's &s;pirit, which like tho&s;e <HI>Locu&s;ts, Rev.</HI> 9.9, 10, had faces like men, but had tails like Scorpions, and &s;tings in their tails.</P>
<P>Your thoughts I know, are not likely to produce the &s;ame effects; although you have the &s;ame efficient: and becau&s;e you &s;ay your peace is hereby di&s;turbed by ignorance, as not knowing what to do in the mid&s;t of the&s;e civil actions and the&s;e religious thoughts; I conceive that <HI>two</HI> things are to be &s;adly con&s;idered of, for the cure of them.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> how to know <HI>when &s;uch religious pious thoughts come from God's &s;pirit,</HI> and when from the Devil transforming him&s;elf into an Angel of light; or from a well-melted &s;tirring con&s;cience, yet blind. For when you know they come from God's &s;pirit, you are bound to nouri&s;h them; but when not, you are not bound to embrace nor comply with them. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Learn <HI>how your &s;oul is
<PB N="5" REF="006067_0019_10275040CD503FB8">
to behave and carry it &s;elf in Civil employments:</HI> For when you &s;ee how you do, and may ho|nour God in following them, your &s;pirit will not be &s;o unquiet, if at any time you embrace not the &s;ugge&s;tions of the other.</P>
<P N="1">I. For the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> briefly; all good motions and thoughts are not the &s;pirit's motions: as may thus appear.</P>
<P>There be <HI>three</HI> things chiefly by which we may di&s;cern the motions, &s;ugge&s;tions, and thot's which come from God's &s;pirit: all which concur|ring together in a good action, or thought, or word (not one alone) will make di&s;covery whether they are from God's &s;pirit or not.</P>
<P N="1">1. If it be &s;ugge&s;ted for God's ends, its from God's &s;pirit: to act &s;o high as for a &s;uper|natural end, mu&s;t ari&s;e from a &s;upernatural prin|ciple, which only is God's &s;pirit. Phari&s;aical actions were for a double &s;elfi&s;h end, and hence not from God's &s;pirit, but nature, and their own &s;pirit, 1. To be &s;een of men, 2. If they did any of them abhor this, yet it was to purcha&s;e and gender in their own minds an opinion of holine&s;s before God: and hence Chri&s;t gives them this Item, in giving Alms, that they &s;hould not let their right hand know what their left hand doth: for many men will do good acts, lea&s;t they &s;hould by the neg|lect of them, think them&s;elves hypocrites, and &s;o be troubled for them. Chri&s;t would have us not to take notice of what we do for &s;uch an end.</P>
<P N="2">2. If they be animated and quickned from
<PB N="6" REF="006067_0020_10274FF193C971E8">
God's command, for the higher mea&s;ure of holine&s;s, for glorious ends, without a warrant from the Word, is the more &s;ordid &s;uper&s;ti|tion. Chri&s;t healed the leper: when he char|ged him with anger to tell no man; he, no que&s;tion for a good end, publi&s;hed the mira|cle the more: this was a good motion, but it was &s;inful in him, being cro&s;s to Chri&s;t's command. When Chri&s;t would have wa&s;hed <HI>Peter</HI>'s feet, he had many thoughts that came into his head, concerning his own vilen&s;s, and Chri&s;t's glory; and had a good end and meaning in his an&s;wers; yet his humility cro&s;&s;ing Chri&s;t's command, the Lord profe&s;&s;eth again&s;t it and him for it, that he had no part in him, if he &s;hould go on in it.</P>
<P N="3">3. God's Spirit &s;ets a man on work in due &s;ea&s;on: For let the duty be commanded and rightly directed, yet if it be not done in &s;ea|&s;on, it is not from God's Spirit: Hence P&s;al. 1. <HI>The righteous bring forth fruit in its &s;ea&s;on:</HI> and hence <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;peaks of <HI>words &s;poken in &s;ea&s;on, are as apples of Gold:</HI> and hence we read in Eccle&s;ia&s;tes, of <HI>a time and &s;ea&s;on for every thing under the Sun.</HI> And therefore when there is a &s;ea&s;on of God's appointing for civil things or bu&s;ine&s;s; it is not &s;ea&s;on now to be mole&s;ted or perplexed in it, by the injection and evocation of tho&s;e thoughts which we think to proceed from the Spirit of GOD. I know indeed, that the Spirit of God doth enable a man to do whatever good he doth; but as Grace makes Nature &s;ometimes to &s;erve, &s;o &s;in|ful
<PB N="7" REF="006067_0021_102750425682C970">
Nature brings Grace into captivity, (which <HI>Paul</HI> complains of, Rom. 7.) and makes Grace to &s;erve it. To exhort and reprove another for &s;in, is from God's &s;pirit that it is done; but to reprove at an un&s;ea&s;onable time, its from &s;inful corruption, abu&s;ing God's grace, and ma|king <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> to grind. Its from the excel|lency of a knife to cut well; but to cut my finger with it when I &s;hould be cutting my meat with it ari&s;eth not from the end of the knife, nor from the intention of him that made it; &s;o to think of good things, it is from the &s;pirit, I grant; but to think of them in &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on that God &s;ets you a work to mind and follow other occa&s;ions, its from the ene|my of God's &s;pirit, and your own peace. For as it is a &s;in to nouri&s;h worldly thoughts when God &s;ets you a work in &s;piritual heavenly em|ployments; &s;o it is, in &s;ome re&s;pects, as great a &s;in to &s;uffer your &s;elf to be di&s;tracted by &s;pi|ritual thoughts, when God &s;ets you on work in civil, yet lawful, employments: &s;uch thoughts, I conceive, are but the leaven of Monki&s;h holine&s;s, if they divert you from your lawful affairs, when the Lord calls you to fol|low them. For the Lord never calls you to two divers employments at the &s;ame time, un|le&s;s you make the one to be a means to fur|ther the good of the other; which &s;uch pious thoughts in &s;ome civil employments do; it be|ing no piece of Chri&s;tian wi&s;dom or hone&s;ty to turn round in wordly employments &s;o long till by giddine&s;s we fall down, but by &s;ecret
<PB N="8" REF="006067_0022_10274FF34019C990">
&s;teps, ever and anon to look up to heaven and to behold the face of God, to whom only therein we are to approve our &s;elves. But yet it &s;eems your thoughts are &s;o far from being &s;ub&s;ervient the one to the other, that you are di&s;tracted and mole&s;ted, and your piece interrupted, and your Chri&s;tian cour&s;e made trouble&s;ome, and an heavy burthen; which &s;urely cannot be by the yoke of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: therefore you mu&s;t fir&s;t bring your troubles in this particular to this i&s;&s;ue; either you may follow your Civil affairs, and nouri&s;h the&s;e thoughts as helps to main|tain your peace, and make you heavenly minded in them, (and if they &s;erve &s;ufficiently to &s;uch an end, why are you troubled with them?) or el&s;e you cannot follow God comfortably in civil actions, unle&s;s you bani&s;h from your thoughts which do &s;o mi&s;erably di&s;tract you; and then why do you fear you &s;hall grieve God's &s;pirit, if at the &s;ame time you do not give entertainment to them, the un&s;ea&s;on|ablene&s;s of which, &s;peaks plainly they came not from the &s;pirit's &s;ugge&s;tions; be&s;ides their hindrance of comfortably walking with God, which the Employments them&s;elves can never hinder.</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay, when is the <HI>&s;ea&s;on</HI> of nou|ri&s;hing &s;uch thoughts?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, Entertain tho&s;e thoughts as, it may be, you have done &s;ome friends, who came to you at that time you had bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;trangers, whom you love not &s;o well as your friends; you have de&s;ired them to &s;tay a
<PB N="9" REF="006067_0023_10275046CB8C8330">
while, until you have done with the other, and then you have returned to your friends, and when the other hath been &s;hut out of the doors, the other hath had the welcome, and hath lodged with you all night; and thus you have grieved neither, but plea&s;ed both. It is &s;o in this ca&s;e, Worldly employments are our &s;trangers, yet they mu&s;t be &s;poke with: Reli|gious thoughts and practices are our friends, the&s;e come unto us while God calls us to parley with the other, you cannot &s;peak with both at one time, in one place, without much perlexity: take therefore this cour&s;e, make much of the good thoughts, but parley not with them till your bu&s;ine&s;s is done with &s;trangers; and to|wards evening, which is your &s;ea&s;on, &s;et &s;ome time apart every day for meditation, and then make them welcome; then con&s;ider and ponder well what was &s;ugge&s;ted to you in the day time, and &s;ift every good thought to the bran, for then is your &s;ea&s;on, and after that let them &s;up and lodge with you all night, and keep the hou&s;e with you every day. And &s;urely when the Lord Je&s;us &s;hall &s;ee what a friend you &s;hall make of his Spirit thus, and how wi&s;ely you walk therein, you &s;hall not need to fear any grieving of it, at un&s;ea&s;onable times: nay (I &s;ay) you will mo&s;t fearfully grieve his Spirit, if you parley with the con|ceived &s;ugge&s;tions of it at un&s;ea&s;onable times. <HI>What thou do&s;t, do it with all thine heart,</HI> &s;aith <HI>Solomon.</HI> Eccle&s;. 9.</P>
<P>Therefore when you are to pray, confer, or
<PB N="10" REF="006067_0024_10274FFA4691C340">
meditate, do it with all your mind, and all your thoughts, and all your &s;trength. So when God calls you to worldly employments, do them with all your mind and might; and when the &s;ea&s;on of <HI>meditation</HI> comes, take it: which glorious ordinance of God, although many chri&s;tians u&s;e it occa&s;ionally, and again&s;t &s;ome good time, or when they have lei&s;ure meeting with them, yet to &s;et &s;ome time apart for it in a &s;olemn manner every day, and that in con&s;cience as we do for prayer generally, where is the man to be found that does thus? Tho&s;e men that thus neglect their &s;ea&s;on of mu&s;ing and entring into parley with God's &s;pi|rit daily, may be well &s;aid to grieve the &s;pi|rit: through the neglect of which Ordinance, God's &s;pirit is as much grieved by profe&s;&s;ors in <HI>England,</HI> as by any cour&s;e I know. The Lord awaken us: but I have run too far al|ready in this fir&s;t part of my an&s;wer.</P>
<P>For the <HI>&s;econd</HI> means, <HI>viz. How the &s;oul is to carry it &s;elf in civil employments,</HI> that &s;o you may not think you do for better, when you li&s;ten to good thoughts as you mention.</P>
<P>I &s;ay but <HI>two</HI> things;</P>
<P N="1">1. Learn to follow them out of an aw|ful re&s;pect to the eye, pre&s;ence, and command of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: and to do what you do in civil bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, as the work of Chri&s;t: When you are riding, or making up breaches between man and man, and then think I am now a|bout the work of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. Seeing your &s;elf thus working in worldly
<PB N="11" REF="006067_0025_10275049A84733F8">
employments for him, you may ea&s;ily apprehend that for that time God calls you to them, and you attend upon the work of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in them; that you honour God as much, nay more by the meane&s;t &s;ervile worldly act, than if you &s;hould have &s;pent all that time in medi|tation, prayer, or any other &s;piritual employ|ment, to which you had no call at that time. It is noted therefore by &s;ome of <HI>Peter</HI>'s wives mother, that when Chri&s;t had healed her of her fever, &s;he &s;ate not down at table with Chri&s;t in communion with him, which, no que&s;tion, was &s;weet; but mini&s;tred at the ta|ble, and ran too and fro, and &s;o &s;erved him, and acted for him; wherein &s;he &s;hewed more love, and gave him more honour, <HI>viz.</HI> in that mean &s;ervice, and in acting for him, than in having communion with him. Now if the Lord would out of his abundant goodne&s;s, &s;et the &s;oul in &s;uch an acting frame for him, and if it could do its worldly employments, as the work of Chri&s;t, and &s;ee how greatly it honours Chri&s;t in attending on him; Oh what peace &s;hould a chri&s;tian enjoy, notwith&s;tanding all his di&s;tractions every day! and how ea&s;ily would &s;uch devout thoughts you &s;peak of, be repell'd like darkne&s;s before the light? For the noble|ne&s;s of tho&s;e good thoughts you &s;peak of pre|&s;enting them&s;elves again&s;t the mean and ba&s;e out&s;ides of civil affairs, makes you ready to honour the one, when you are call'd to &s;erve the other: but now, by &s;eeing you do the work of Chri&s;t Je&s;us in them, you &s;hall hereby
<PB N="12" REF="006067_0026_10274FFC033BBE58">
&s;ee a glory in the meane&s;t &s;ervice you perform in civil affairs, and this will make you cleave unto them. But I have &s;aid too much about repelling of good thoughts in the&s;e times, where|in men have &s;o few; though, it may be, little enough to &s;atisfy you.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CASE II.</HI> Of being humbled for &s;inful Di&s;tractions.</HEAD>
<P>Your &s;econd trouble is this, <HI>viz.</HI> That your heart is kept from being <HI>humbled for &s;inful di&s;tractions,</HI> that hinder and interrupt the &s;piritual performance of holy duties, and that for <HI>two</HI> rea&s;ons: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e they be volun|tary and accidental. <HI>Secondly,</HI> becau&s;e they can|not break the covenant between GOD and your Soul, being but infirmities.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> For the latter clau&s;e concerning breach of covenant, together with the other.</P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;ay, not only infirmities do not, but the greate&s;t &s;ins cannot make a breach of co|venant between GOD and the &s;oul that is once really (not nominally) wrapt up in the cove|nant of grace. Indeed gro&s;s &s;candalous &s;ins, nay infirmities, when they are given way to, and not re&s;i&s;ted, may keep the &s;oul from the fruition, for a time, of God's covenant, but never from the eternal <HI>jus</HI> and right unto it.

And hence by the acting and venting of &s;ome &s;ins, wherein there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> the neglect of the ex|erci&s;e of grace, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> that is really in covenant with God, may be deprived of the fruition of it; yet &s;eeing the &s;eed of God, and the ha|bit of grace ever remains, he cannot by any &s;in break his covenant: For the covenant of grace is ab&s;olute, wherein the Lord doth not only promi&s;e the good, but to begin, and per|fect, and fulfil the condition ab&s;olutely, with|out re&s;pect of &s;in; <HI>ex parte creaturae.</HI> Indeed if God's covenant of grace did (as that of works) depend upon man to fulfil the condi|tion, having &s;ufficient grace to fulfil it, then gro&s;s &s;in might well break the covenant: but &s;eeing GOD hath undertaken to fulfil the co|venant ab&s;olutely, notwith&s;tanding all the evils and &s;ins of the &s;oul, no &s;in can po&s;&s;ibly break that knot and covenant, which &s;o firm and re|&s;olute love hath once knit. And therefore, if this be a good argument, infirmities cannot break covenant: What cau&s;e have I to be hum|bled for them? &s;o as to &s;ay, It is thy mercy Lord that I am not con&s;umed for them, (as you write;) you may upon the &s;ame ground &s;ay &s;o, If the Lord &s;hould de&s;ert you, or you for&s;ake the Lord, and &s;o fall into the foule&s;t &s;in, which I &s;uppo&s;e corrupt con&s;cience dares not be &s;o bold as to think or allow of.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> I an&s;wer, every believer has a <HI>double being or &s;tanding,</HI> and &s;o there may be put upon him a double re&s;pect.</P>
<P N="1">1. Fir&s;t, he may be con&s;idered as united to, and having a <HI>&s;piritual being on Chri&s;t;</HI> and &s;o it is true, he is under Grace, and the cove|nant of Grace, and not under the Law, nor the covenant of works; and hence not being under the Law, nor bound to keep it as a covenant of life (though it be <HI>a rule of life</HI>) no &s;in can condemn him, there being <HI>no con|demnation to them that are Chri&s;t Je&s;us, Rom.</HI> 8.1. But as Chri&s;t is above condemnation, and law, and death, and cur&s;e, &s;o is he. And this truly under&s;tood, is the foundation of a Chri&s;tian's joy and peace, and glory, every day; yet &s;o, as tho' &s;in doth not condemn him, yet he has good rea&s;on to &s;ay, it is mercy, and meer mercy, Lord, that I am not con&s;umed, that I am not condemned. For &s;in is the &s;ame; nay grace and God's love aggravates &s;in; for to &s;in again&s;t the law, de&s;erves death without recovery; but to &s;in when grace has received me, and loved me; when the blood of Chri&s;t has been &s;hed abundantly, to deliver me from &s;in; Oh this makes the mo&s;t &s;ecret &s;ilent &s;in a crying one! So that if you do con&s;ider this well, you may &s;ee what little cau&s;e there is to have your

heart ri&s;ing again&s;t the deepe&s;t humiliation for the lea&s;t &s;in, though you be in Chri&s;t, and under grace: For as <HI>Daniel,</HI> when he was put into the Lions den, had not he cau&s;e to won|der that he was not torn in pieces by them? and why? becau&s;e it was not from any defect on their parts to tear him in pieces, but from the omnipotent power, and mercy, and grace of his God, that muzzel'd their mouths; &s;o though no Lion can tear, though no &s;ins can hurt or condemn a Chri&s;tian, as he is con&s;i|dered in Chri&s;t, yet, has not he cau&s;e to con|fe&s;s and wonder, and &s;ay, Lord, it is thy meer grace and mercy that it is not &s;o? Which is the act of humiliation your letter &s;aith you can hardly come unto; and why? not becau&s;e God's grace puts any le&s;s evil in &s;in, but be|cau&s;e it is meerly grace that keeps it from &s;pitting that venom which otherwi&s;e it would.</P>
<P N="2">2. Secondly, A Chri&s;tian may be con&s;idered in re&s;pect of his <HI>natural being in him&s;elf;</HI> and thus he is ever under the Law, and as oft as he &s;inneth, under the &s;entence of death, and as the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks, <HI>by nature</HI> even <HI>we</HI> (ju&s;tified, quickned) <HI>are the children of wrath as well as others.</HI> And thus after the lea&s;t involuntary accidental &s;in, you may ea&s;ily &s;ee what cau&s;e you have to lie down deeply humbled, mourn|ing under the &s;entence of death, and God's eternal cur&s;e, as a condemned man going to execution, to feel that fire that &s;hall never go out; looking upon your &s;elf as you are in your &s;elf, a forlorn ca&s;t-away every moment; and

this truly under&s;tood is the foundation of a Chri|&s;tian's &s;orrow, &s;hame, and confu&s;ion of face, &s;elf-loathing, &s;elf-forgetting, &s;elf-for&s;aking, and condemning every day. And, believe it Sir, it is no &s;mall Piece of a Chri&s;tian's &s;kill and work, to put a difference between him&s;elf and him&s;elf; him&s;elf as he is in Chri&s;t, and &s;o to joy and triumph; and him&s;elf as he is grow|ing on his fir&s;t root, and &s;o to &s;orrow, and loath, and condemn him&s;elf: &s;o that, to wind up all that I have &s;aid, look upon your &s;elf as in Chri&s;t, you may &s;ay the&s;e involuntary in|firmities do not, &s;hall not, condemn me.</P>
<P>But Lord it is Grace, Grace that it is not &s;o, and this is Evangelical humiliation. Look again upon your &s;elf, as you &s;tand on your own bottom, and live in your own nature, and &s;o you may &s;ay after the lea&s;t infirmity, I have now broken a mo&s;t holy and righteous Law, and therefore I am already condemned: O woe is me, I have already undone my &s;elf by mine iniquity: and this is Legal humiliation, which &s;erves for mortification, as the fir&s;t for vification. I know it is very difficult to bring the heart to acknowledge freely it de&s;erves death after &s;o &s;mall an involuntary offence. But when the Lord reveals two things, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> him&s;elf in his glory, <HI>Secondly,</HI> how the lea&s;t &s;in &s;trikes him; I per&s;wade my &s;elf, the vile&s;t heart can|not but be forced to confe&s;s how ju&s;t God &s;hould be in his &s;evere&s;t proceedings again&s;t him.

it is, and the more natural, the more horrible; as to be a natural Thief is far wor&s;e than to be a deliberate thief, who &s;ometimes &s;teals: and therefore, good Sir, take heed of looking no deeper, nor &s;eeing no further than the bare act, and unvoluntarine&s;s and accidentalne&s;s, and &s;uddenne&s;s of your infirmities: for if you do, you look through the wrong end of the gla&s;s, and they will appear &s;o &s;mall, that you will find it a very tough work to bring your heart con&s;entively, to &s;ay, (if I may &s;ay and u&s;e your own phra&s;e) It is thy mercy Lord that I am not con&s;umed for them: But look upon them as indeed they are, in re&s;pect of that in|finite glory you &s;trike, doing the greate&s;t mi&s;|chiefs to God by them, and (which makes them the viler) as they are &s;o &s;trong you can|not remove them, and &s;o horrible as that it is natural to you to commit them, &amp;c; and &s;urely you will not through grace, find &s;uch thoughts haunt you long: Not but that they will be, haply, ri&s;ing and tempting, but never alway vexing and prevailing.

<HEAD><HI>CASE. III.</HI> Of conceiving aright of the Holy Trinity.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> thing that troubles you, is the <HI>di&s;-ranking of the Per&s;ons in the Trinity:</HI> For though you think the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> is <HI>God,</HI> yet you have not &s;o high a repute of him, as of the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>Son</HI> ad|dre&s;&s;eth him&s;elf to God the <HI>Father</HI> in all his prayers and acknowledgments, in a more im|mediate manner than unto the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> and therefore you would know if the word <HI>Father</HI> (as in <HI>the Lord</HI>'s <HI>Prayer</HI>) includes not the <HI>Unity</HI> in <HI>Trinity.</HI></P>
<P>To this briefly con&s;ider <HI>three</HI> things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Without all que&s;tion, the &s;ame God which lies under that relative property of <HI>Father,</HI> is the &s;ame God with the God-head of the Son, and the God-head of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> there be|ing not three Gods: and therefore the God-head of the <HI>Son</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> are not excluded, but included in the God-head of the <HI>Father,</HI> when we look upon the <HI>Father</HI> as God, in <HI>the Lord</HI>'s <HI>Prayer,</HI> or any where el&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. But &s;econdly, the <HI>Father</HI> as Father, is never taken for the &s;ame <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> in Scripture; nor the <HI>Son</HI> as Son, is taken for the <HI>Father;</HI> nor the Holy Gho&s;t as Holy Gho&s;t, is at any time taken for the Son: For it is a rule in Theologie, though the <HI>res &s;ub&s;trata,</HI> the thing that lies under the Relative property (<HI>viz.</HI> the God-head) of every per&s;on, be common and
<PB N="20" REF="006067_0034_1027500778F43B10">
communicated; yet the &s;ame God-head con&s;i|dered as clothed with his Relative property (as <HI>Father, Son</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI>) it is not common, but peculiar. For the God-head of the <HI>Father</HI> as Father, is not the God-head of the <HI>Son</HI> as Son, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence it follows, that when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> addre&s;|&s;eth him&s;elf to the <HI>Father</HI> as Father in Scrip|ture, it is not becau&s;e <HI>He</HI> is either a diver&s;e or greater God than the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> but it is for <HI>two</HI> other rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e the <HI>Father</HI> as Father, received primarily the wrong that &s;in did again&s;t his work of creation: For the <HI>Father</HI> being the fir&s;t per&s;on in order and creation, the fir&s;t tran&s;cient act as (<HI>election</HI> and <HI>reprobation</HI> were the fir&s;t immanent); hence this work is atri|buted chiefly to God the <HI>Father,</HI> in re&s;pect of our orderly apprehen&s;ion: and hence man &s;in|ning then when he was only made, this is chiefly attributed to be again&s;t the <HI>Father,</HI> be|cau&s;e his work appeared to be chiefly there; and not again&s;t the <HI>Son,</HI> for his work chiefly appears in <HI>redemption,</HI> he being the &s;econd Per&s;on, and this the &s;econd main and wonder|ful work; neither again&s;t the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> for his work chiefly appears to us in <HI>application,</HI> being the third Per&s;on, and this the third main act that ever God will do, or &s;how forth to the world in this life. Hence God the <HI>Fa|ther</HI> receiving to our apprehen&s;ion, the wrong in creation by &s;in, <HI>He</HI> is the Per&s;on that is to be &s;atisfied, and not the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> And
<PB N="21" REF="006067_0035_10275056998F0F70">
hence <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> in all his prayers has a mo&s;t &s;pecial eye to <HI>Him,</HI> and not to the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> (as Holy Gho&s;t) becau&s;e <HI>He</HI> came into the world, by his death, and interce&s;&s;ion, and &s;trong cries to &s;atisfie God the <HI>Father,</HI> and not God the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> as a third Per&s;on. And hence it is &s;aid, 1. John 2.1, 2. <HI>If any &s;in, we have an Advocate with God the Father,</HI> (not God the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI>) becau&s;e He was, to our apprehen|&s;ion, the Per&s;on wronged: and hence we are, after &s;ins committed, chiefly to eye the <HI>Father</HI> in our prayers, and to go to him for pardon with <HI>our Advocate</HI> with us; becau&s;e to whom of|fence is chiefly offered, from him chiefly par|don and reconciliation is to be expected.</P>
<P N="2">2. Therefore <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> addre&s;&s;eth him&s;elf chiefly in his prayers to God the <HI>Father,</HI> becau&s;e he is the original and fir&s;t cau&s;e of all good; becau&s;e he is the fir&s;t Per&s;on in order of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, and therefore fir&s;t too in the manner of conveying. I know the God-head is the original of all good: but con&s;ider the Per&s;ons one with ano|ther, and &s;o the <HI>Father,</HI> is ever the fir&s;t in ope|ration, as the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> is the la&s;t in con|&s;ummation; for all good comes from the <HI>Father, James</HI> 1.17, through the <HI>Son</HI> by the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> And hence in all our prayers we are to look for all good from the <HI>Father,</HI> for his <HI>Son</HI>'s &s;ake, to be conveyed us by the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t:</HI> and hence it is &s;aid, <HI>John</HI> 6.10. <HI>No man comes to me but whom the Father draws:</HI> Why? It is the im|mediate office and work of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> to draw and apply the &s;oul unto <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> why then
<PB N="22" REF="006067_0036_1027500BBA70A5C8">
is it &s;aid, <HI>Unle&s;s the Father draw?</HI> The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e that which was perfected and con|&s;ummated by the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> was intentionally and by way of purpo&s;e and decree begun originally by the <HI>Father:</HI> and this is that which Chri&s;t's words have chiefly reference unto, <HI>viz,</HI> the <HI>Father</HI> through the <HI>Son</HI> by the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> draws.</P>
<P>But I have waded too far in this Divinity, the clear knowledge of which is re&s;erved for us in heaven: But thus much to &s;atisfie you. Yet the word <HI>Father</HI> in <HI>the Lord's Prayer,</HI> I conceive under correction, as it doth not exclude any per&s;on of the God-head, &s;o its chiefly &s;et down there, not &s;o much to denote the <HI>Per&s;on</HI> of the Father, as the <HI>Affection</HI> of <HI>God</HI> as a Fa|ther to us his Sons by Chri&s;t: which we are to believe in our fir&s;t approaching to our prayers, to be as, nay to tran&s;cend the affection of any Father to his Son; when we come to call upon him for tho&s;e <HI>&s;ix</HI> things which the Petitions &s;et down for tho&s;e <HI>three</HI> ends, Kingdom, Power, and Glory, which the Prayer concludes withal.</P>

as it appears in many other, &s;o in this ca&s;e you put. Look as it is with every man when God awakens him effectually, he fir&s;t &s;eeks to his kitchin phy&s;ick to &s;ave him&s;elf by his duties, praying, mourning, reforming, endeavouring, re|penting, working, before he will &s;eek out to the Phy&s;ician, and to Chri&s;t to &s;ave him: Be|cau&s;e it was natural to <HI>Adam</HI> to &s;eek to live by his working, it is natural to every Son and branch of that root, to &s;eek to &s;ave him&s;elf by doing as well as he can, or as God gives him the &s;trength and grace: So it is here. It was natural to <HI>Adam</HI> to depend upon, and go to God immediately, as a creature to a Creator, as a Son to go nakedly to God as a Father: Chri&s;t was not then known nor &s;een: &s;o it is natural to every man when rectified Nature is &s;tirred up, to go immediately to God. It is grace in the <HI>&s;econd Covenant</HI> that reveals and draws to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to God by Chri&s;t, <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.25.</P>
<P>For cure of this di&s;temper, ponder but the&s;e <HI>three</HI> things.</P>

ubt there, being <HI>the brightne&s;s of his glory, and the expre&s;s Image of his Per&s;on, Heb.</HI> 1.3. And as he is <HI>man,</HI> the very heart of God, both in re&s;pect of Affection, and Will is to be &s;een; So that in and through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, e&s;pecially his hu|man nature, the glory of the great God breaks out like the Sun through the clouds mo&s;t bright|ly, in re&s;pect of us; and therefore in and through his human nature we are only to behold God, in whom all that a Chri&s;tian de&s;ires to know, is to be &s;een, which is the Face and Heart of &s;o dear a Friend, 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.6. <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.9, 10. For we know by too lamentable experience, how the whole world vani&s;hing in their &s;moaky thoughts of the glory of God, as he is con&s;idered in him|&s;elf, and not able to conceive or retain the know|ledge of him; did hence invent and &s;et up Ima|ges as fit objects for their drunken &s;taggering under&s;tanding to fa&s;ten upon, and to be limited with; and hence adored God before the&s;e, (as our Popi&s;h Hypocrites do before the Altar) and in the&s;e and at the&s;e, as Papi&s;ts do in re&s;pect of their Images. Hence the Lord to cure this inveterate natural malady, hath in the <HI>&s;econd Per|&s;on,</HI> united him&s;elf to man Chri&s;t Je&s;us; through whom we are both able to our everla&s;ting won|derment to &s;ee him, and al&s;o here bound only to behold him; who as he is a fit handle for our faith, &s;o he is a fit object for our weak minds to behold the glory of the mo&s;t high God in.

<HEAD><HI>CASE V.</HI> Of applying the ab&s;olute Promi&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>Your <HI>fifth</HI> trouble is, you know not <HI>how to apply ab&s;olute Promi&s;es</HI> to your &s;elf, as in <HI>Heb.</HI> 8, becau&s;e they are made indefinitely without condition. Conditional Promi&s;es you &s;ay you can, if you can find the qualification that gives you right to the good of the promi&s;e within you.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> This u&s;eful fruitful que&s;tion, how to ap|ply ab&s;olute promi&s;es to ones particular, de&s;erves a larger time and an&s;wer, than now in the mid&s;t of perplexities, I am able, yet willing, to give. For when the Lord &s;aith ab&s;olutely without con|dition, that he will take away the &s;tony heart, and he will put his fear into his people's hearts, &amp;c, and the&s;e kind of promi&s;es are made to &s;ome, not to all, to tho&s;e only whom the Lord will, and in general to his people; Hereupon the Souls of many Chri&s;tians, e&s;pecially &s;uch as que&s;tion God's love towards them, are mo&s;t in &s;u&s;pence: and therefore when they complain of the vile|ne&s;s of their hearts and &s;trength of their lu&s;ts, let any man tell them that the Lord has under|taken in the <HI>Second covenant,</HI> to heal their back|&s;lidings, and to &s;ubdue their iniquities; they will hereupon reply, it is true, he has promi&s;ed indeed to do thus for &s;ome ab&s;olutely, though they have no good in them, but I that feel &s;o vile a heart, &s;o rebellious a nature, will he do this for me, or no? And thus the Soul floats above water, yet fears it &s;hall &s;ink at la&s;t, notwith&s;tanding all that God

has &s;aid. I will an&s;wer therefore briefly the&s;e <HI>two</HI> things in general.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. I &s;hall &s;hew you <HI>to what end, and for what u&s;e</HI> and purpo&s;e God has made ab&s;olute promi&s;es, not only to them that be for the pre&s;ent his peo|ple, but to them that in re&s;pect of their e&s;tates and condition are not.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. I &s;hall &s;hew you <HI>how every Chri&s;tian is to make u&s;e of them,</HI> and how and when he ought to apply them. For the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">I. Fir&s;t, I conceive, that as in re&s;pect of <HI>God</HI> him&s;elf, there are many ends which I &s;hall not mention, as being needle&s;s; &s;o in re&s;pect of <HI>man</HI> there are principally the&s;e <HI>two ends</HI> for which the Lord has made ab&s;olute promi&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">1. To rai&s;e up the Soul of a helple&s;s, &s;inful, cur&s;ed, lo&s;t &s;inner in his own eyes, to &s;ome hope, at lea&s;t, of mercy and help from the Lord. For thus u&s;ually every man's Soul is wrought, to whom the Lord doth intend grace and mercy; he fir&s;t turns his eyes inward, and makes him to &s;ee he is &s;tark naught, and that he has not one dram of grace in him, who thought him&s;elf rich, and wanting nothing before; and con&s;e|quently, that he is under the cur&s;e and wrath of God for the pre&s;ent, and that if the Lord &s;hould but &s;top his breath, and cover his face, and take him away, which he may ea&s;ily do, and this to be feared he will, that he is undone forever. Hereupon the Soul is awakened and falls to his kitchen phy&s;ick, as I &s;pake before, prays, and hears, and amends, and &s;trives to grow better, and to &s;top up every hole, and to amend it &s;elf of
<PB N="29" REF="006067_0043_10275012F98D6DD0">
every &s;in; but finding it &s;elf to grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e, and perceiving thereby that he doth but &s;tir, and not clean&s;e the puddle, and that it is not amending of nature that he mu&s;t attain to, but he mu&s;t believe, and make a long arm to Hea|ven, and apprehend the Lord Je&s;us, (which &s;o few know, or ever &s;hall enjoy) and hereby quench the wrath of God; I &s;ay, finding he cannot do thus, no, nor no means of them&s;elves can help him to this, hereupon he is for&s;aken of all his &s;elf-wi&s;dom and of all his vain hopes, and now &s;its down like a de&s;olate widow, comfortle&s;s, and &s;orrowful, and thinks there is no way but death and hell, and the wrath of a di&s;plea&s;ed God to be expected. And if any come and tell this Soul, of God's mercy and pity to &s;inners; Ay, &s;aith he, it's true, he is even infinitely merciful unto them who are rent from their &s;ins, and that can believe; but that I cannot do, and am &s;ure &s;hall never be able for to do; and therefore what cau&s;e have I but to lie down in my &s;orrow, and to expect my fatal &s;troke every moment? Reply again upon this Soul, and tell him, that though he cannot believe, or loo&s;en his heart from &s;ir, yet that the Lord has promi&s;ed to do it, that he will &s;ubdue all his iniquity, and he will pardon all his &s;in, and that he will cau&s;e men to walk in his ways, &amp;c; True, &s;aith the Soul again, he will do thus for his own people, and for them he has cho&s;en, but I never had dram of grace in my heart, and there is no evidence that the Lord is mine own, or that I am his: Here again the Soul lies down, until the Lord di&s;covers to the
<PB N="30" REF="006067_0044_1027501B802110D8">
Soul that he will do the&s;e things for &s;ome that have no grace, or never had grace; for the&s;e pro|mi&s;es were made to &s;uch.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Soul thinks thus; The&s;e promi|&s;es are made for &s;ome that are filthy; for why &s;hould God pour clean water upon them? for &s;ome that be hard-hearted; for why &s;hould he promi&s;e to take away the &s;tony heart from them? &amp;c: and if unto &s;ome &s;uch, and I being &s;uch a one, why may not the Lord po&s;&s;ibly intend and include me, &s;eeing he has not by his promi&s;e ex|cluded nor &s;hut me out? Indeed I dare not &s;ay he will, but yet how do I, or men, or Angels know, but yet I may be one? Hereupon Hope is rai&s;ed to life again: &s;eeing God has undertaken the work for the vile&s;t, it is po&s;&s;ible he may do it for me, now when I am vile and can do nothing for my &s;elf. And thus you may &s;ee the <HI>fir&s;t end</HI> and u&s;e of ab&s;olute promi&s;es, to be as it were, twigs to uphold the &s;inking Spirits of hopele&s;s, helple&s;s, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Souls.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Second end and u&s;e</HI> of them is this; To create and draw out faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the promi&s;es. For as the Law begets Terror, &s;o the promi&s;es beget Faith. Now no conditional promi&s;e fir&s;tly begets Faith; becau&s;e he that is under any condition of the Go&s;pel, in that man there is a pre&s;uppo&s;ed faith. It's God's ab&s;olute promi&s;e that fir&s;tly begets faith; for <HI>Faith is not a&s;&s;urance, but the coming of the whole Soul to Chri&s;t in a Promi&s;e, John</HI> 6.35: And then the Soul believes in Chri&s;t, when it comes to Chri&s;t: Now this God works in the Go&s;pel. (1) The Soul is
<PB N="31" REF="006067_0045_102750634DEDEB00">
rai&s;ed up by Hope: And being rai&s;ed, it (2) comes to Chri&s;t, which is Faith, by vehement unutterable de&s;ire: And being come to him it (3) Embraceth Chri&s;t by Love: and thus the match is made, and the everla&s;ting knot is tied.</P>
<P>Now as you have heard, the ab&s;olute promi&s;e works hope of relief from Chri&s;t: and if it works hope, it al&s;o works a de&s;ire, or coming to Chri&s;t by de&s;ire. Oh! that thou Lord would&s;t honour thy grace, thy power, thy love, thy promi&s;e, in helping me a poor ca&s;t-away! And thus Faith is created, as it were, by this ab&s;olute promi&s;e: for it cannot but move the heart of any one that ever felt his want, to cry mightily to the Lord for help, if he has any hope, &s;eeing the Lord has pro|mi&s;ed to do it for &s;ome. Oh &s;aith the Soul, that thou would&s;t do it for me! And &s;urely, were it not for this ab&s;olute promi&s;e of God, no Soul would de&s;ire, becau&s;e he would have no hope to be &s;aved, or to &s;eek for any thing as from the hands of God. And thus you &s;ee <HI>to what end</HI> God makes and <HI>to what u&s;e</HI> a Chri&s;tian may put the&s;e ab&s;olute Promi&s;es.</P>
<P N="2">II. For the <HI>&s;econd</HI> thing, <HI>viz. How and when a Chri&s;tian may apply the&s;e Promi&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>I <HI>an&s;wer,</HI> every Chri&s;tian is either,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Within Covenant with God, and knows it; or</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Within covenant with God, and knows it not; or</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Out of covenant indeed, for his pre&s;ent &s;tate and condition, yet he is in <HI>fieri,</HI> or making towards it.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="32" REF="006067_0046_1027501D0CD87F78">
1. If he be in <HI>Covenant, and knows it,</HI> then you may ea&s;ily perceive how and when he ought to apply promi&s;es unto him&s;elf: For he may boldly conclude; If God be his God, then all the Promi&s;es of God &s;hall be made good unto him; if he be a Son of God he may boldly chal|lenge at all times at the hands of God, (nay, in &s;ome re&s;pects, at the hands of Ju&s;tice it &s;elf) the fulfilling of God the Father's will delivered in the &s;everal Legacies of the promi&s;e bought by the blood, and &s;ealed by the &s;ame blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that they may and &s;hall be made good unto him: that is clear.</P>
<P N="2">2. If he be <HI>in Covenant, and knows it not,</HI> and que&s;tions hence whether God is his or not, and con&s;equently, whether the promi&s;es belong unto him; then this rule is to be ob&s;erved: let him &s;o &s;ue and &s;eek for the good of the ab&s;olute pro|mi&s;e until by reflecting upon his own acts, herein he perceive him&s;elf adorned and dignified with the qualification of &s;ome conditional promi&s;e; and then if he can find the condition or quali|fication within him&s;elf, then as you judge and write, he may conclude, that the conditional promi&s;e belongs to him; and if one promi&s;e, then all God's promi&s;es, and therefore that ab&s;o|lute promi&s;es are his own, becau&s;e at lea&s;t one conditional promi&s;e is. For no unregenerate man is within the compa&s;s of any one conditional promi&s;e of grace, unle&s;s you will &s;ay he is under the everla&s;ting love of God; the Promi&s;es of grace being but the mid-way between the eternal purpo&s;e and decree of love, and the glorious cer|tain

execution of that love in time. The pro|mi&s;e being the break-day of God's mo&s;t glorious love, which mu&s;t &s;hine out in time.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But here you will &s;ay is the difficulty, <HI>viz,</HI> how I &s;hould &s;o &s;eek for the good of ab&s;o|lute promi&s;es, as therein to find my &s;elf within the compa&s;s of &s;ome conditional one?</P>
<P>I <HI>an&s;wer,</HI> It is done chiefly by <HI>three acts.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. By being <HI>humbly contented,</HI> that &s;eeing the Lord has ab&s;olutely Promi&s;ed, to work and do all for the Soul he intends to &s;ave, even when it can do nothing for it &s;elf, and that he has taken the work into his own hands, &s;o that it is his pro|mi&s;e, offer, office and honour to do all; that therefore you <HI>lie down,</HI> not &s;luggi&s;hly, but <HI>hum|bly at the feet of God, and contented to have him to be your God,</HI> and for ever to be di&s;po&s;ed of in any thing by God, if he will fulfil his cove|nant in you; contented to part with any &s;in, if he will rend it from you; contented to know any truth, if he will reveal it to you; contented to do any duty, if he will enable you; contented to &s;hine bright with all his glorious graces, if he will create and maintain them in you; contented to bear any evil, if he will lay his hand under your head, and thereunto &s;trengthen you; and &s;o &s;ee|ing the Lord promi&s;ed to undertake the work for &s;ome, put out the work, and put over your Soul, to him, that he would fulfil the good that his covenant promi&s;eth in your &s;elf. Now when you do thus, which, no que&s;tion, you and many a Soul doth, many times reflect upon this act, and &s;ee if you cannot or may not find your &s;elf by
<PB N="34" REF="006067_0048_102750B95BEADDA8">
it under the condition of &s;ome conditional pro|mi&s;e; and if you do, then are you bound to be|lieve all God's promi&s;es are and will be <HI>Yea</HI> and <HI>Amen</HI> unto you. Now that you do &s;o by this act, it &s;elf &s;peaks plainly: For how many condi|tional promi&s;es are made to the meek? <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the meek, Mat.</HI> 5; and to the humble, whom God will rai&s;e up? For this is not <HI>&s;aving Meek|ne&s;s,</HI> to be quietly contented to be or to do, or to bear any thing that the Lord will have me from mine own &s;trength and feeling; but to be, to do, or to bear any thing that the Lord will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> me, if the Lord enable me. Many a &s;tout heart would gladly have Chri&s;t; but if he cannot have him in his own terms, <HI>viz,</HI> Chri&s;t and his lu&s;ts, Chri&s;t and the world too, or by his own &s;trength and power; he will have none of him, but de&s;perately ca&s;ts him away, and &s;aith, what &s;hall I look after him any more? I cannot pray, I cannot believe, I cannot break this vile and un|ruly will, this &s;tony adamant heart: thus the pride of a man's heart works. Now he that is truly meekned and humbled, he is contented gladly to have God his God, and Chri&s;t his Re|deemer, and that upon Je&s;us Chri&s;t, his own terms. Fir&s;t, <HI>on his own covenant:</HI> now what is that? why it is this, I will give you the good, and work in you the condition too; I will give you my &s;elf, and therefore will not &s;tick to give you an eye to &s;ee, and a heart to receive too. This is the covenant: now hereupon a hum|bled Soul accepts of Chri&s;t according to his co|venant, on his own terms thus, <HI>viz,</HI> Upon the
<PB N="35" REF="006067_0049_102750682D5116E8">
condition Lord, that thou wilt humble me, teach me, per&s;wade me, cau&s;e me to believe, and in every thing to honour thee; Lord, I am con|tented gladly and joyfully to have thee; do there|fore what thou wilt with me. Ju&s;t as a &s;ick man tells his Phy&s;ician, who comes not to him on the&s;e terms, If you will make your &s;elf half whole, then I will cure you, and do the re&s;t for you; but being utterly unable to cure, or to know how to cure him&s;elf, he tells his Phy&s;ici|an; I am content you &s;hould begin and perfect the cure, and &s;o honour your &s;kill and love in me, to be contented to take any thing if you will give it me, and if I offer to re&s;i&s;t that, you &s;hould bind me, and &s;o do any thing with me.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>&s;econd act</HI> is, <HI>earne&s;tly to long and come to Chri&s;t, to cleave unto Je&s;us Chri&s;t by fervent and ardent de&s;ire,</HI> that he would make good tho&s;e ab|&s;olute promi&s;es to you, &s;eeing that they are made to &s;ome, and that they do not exclude you. For when you ponder well, and &s;ee what won|derful great things the Lord promi&s;eth to &s;ome, who&s;e heart cannot but be &s;tirred up to &s;ay, as that woman in another ca&s;e, <HI>Lord, give me of that water to drink!</HI> and as they in the fifth of John, <HI>Lord evermore give us that bread!</HI> Now doing this, reflect upon this <HI>Second</HI> act, and &s;ee if unto it no conditional promi&s;e belongs, and you &s;hall find an affirmative an&s;wer from the word. For what is this longing after the good, not of <HI>&s;ome</HI> (which many hypocrites do) but of <HI>all</HI> the promi&s;es, but that which the Scripture calls <HI>Thir&s;ting?</HI> who are commanded to <HI>come
<PB N="36" REF="006067_0050_102750BD9D1E0290">
and drink of the waters of life freely,</HI> I&s;a. 55.1, 2; and <HI>Hungring?</HI> to which all good things are promi&s;ed, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.6; and <HI>Coming</HI> to Chri&s;t, as I &s;pake even now? who has given this as the fir&s;t fruit of eternal election, and which kind of peo|ple he will never ca&s;t away, <HI>John</HI> 6.37. Now when you &s;ee the&s;e promi&s;es belonging unto you, why dare you not conclude but that all the&s;e ab|&s;olute ones are your's al&s;o?</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>third act</HI> is this; Seeing God hath promi&s;ed ab&s;olutely &s;uch good things in the Se|cond Covenant, but hath not &s;et down the time when, or how much grace he will give, and &s;ee|ing only he can help; therefore <HI>look up, and wait upon the Lord in the u&s;e of all known means, until he makes good what he hath promi&s;ed to do, and perform, and work for you.</HI> Say, as beggars that have but one door to go to for bread, if none hear, or hearing help not, lay them&s;elves down at the door, and &s;ay; I will wait here, I am &s;ure I peri&s;h if I go away, or quarrel with them in the hou&s;e becau&s;e they help me not &s;o &s;oon as I would; and therefore I will wait, for it may be their compa&s;&s;ions may move them as they pa&s;s by to help me. So do you. Many a Soul comes and longs for the good of the Promi&s;es; but if the Lord do not &s;peedily help him, he goes with di&s;couragements, fears, and di&s;contents, or de&s;pair, or &s;in away, and &s;aith one of the&s;e two things, either I &s;hall never have help, or I come not truly, and hence I feel no help. Oh remem|ber that bread is only to be had at the door, to be di&s;tributed when the Lord &s;eeth need, not
<PB N="37" REF="006067_0051_1027506C51956760">
when we would, or think we have need; and therefore wait here and &s;ay, if I peri&s;h here, I will at the feet of God, and at the feet of the promi&s;es and covenant of God, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now reflect upon this act, and &s;ee if you may not find &s;ome conditional promi&s;e annexed unto it; which &s;urely you may, and I will name you but two, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 40.29, 30, 31; and <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 64.4. And if the conditional promi&s;e belongs to &s;uch a Soul, you may ea&s;ily conclude the ab&s;olute pro|mi&s;es are your own: and the chiefe&s;t u&s;e you are to make of them when you know them that they are your own, is to pre&s;s God to make them good daily to you; and to believe as verily and really, as if you had the performance of them, that they &s;hall. It may be you will a&s;k me, <HI>How &s;hall I know whether I have the&s;e conditions truly in me?</HI> I <HI>an&s;wer,</HI> &s;incerity is a very wit|ne&s;&s;ing grace; the frequent meditation of the Scripture will give you much light, to judge of the &s;incerity of them, and that which Saint <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaks, 1. Cor. 2.12, I &s;ay unto you, <HI>We have not received the &s;pirit of the World, but of God, whereby we know,</HI> (or may know) <HI>the things that are freely given to us of God.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. If he be <HI>out of the covenant, but yet God be|gins to work with &s;ome common work of his grace upon him;</HI> all that I would &s;ay to him, and all the u&s;e he can make of &s;uch ab&s;olute promi&s;es, con&s;i&s;ts in the&s;e things;</P>
<P N="1">1. Let him con&s;ider the <HI>Freene&s;s</HI> of God's promi&s;e, whereby he may be &s;tirred up to con|ceive &s;ome hope it may be made good to him in
<PB N="38" REF="006067_0052_102750BF271708C8">
time. For the promi&s;e is very free and large, ex|cluding none (except tho&s;e that &s;in unpardonably) be their &s;ins and natures never &s;o vile before God; and yet not including any by name, for that is in the conditional promi&s;e: And hence &s;uch an one is to make this u&s;e of it; Who knows but the Lord may have pity upon me in time? and &s;o hang thy hope upon him.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let him con&s;ider the <HI>Worth</HI> and <HI>Price</HI> of God's promi&s;e, bought by blood, and for which &s;ome men would give a thou&s;and worlds for the benefit and comfort of; and hereby rai&s;e up his heart, as by the <HI>Freene&s;s</HI> of it to hope, &s;o by the <HI>Price</HI> of it to e&s;teem of the thing promi&s;ed, above pearls, and all the honour and pomp of the world.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let him con&s;ider the <HI>Fulne&s;s</HI> of the pro|mi&s;e, which is a plai&s;ter as big as his &s;ore, ju&s;t an&s;werable to all his wants, nay infinitely more large than his wants. And &s;urely <HI>the&s;e three</HI> things will draw his heart to long for the pro|mi&s;e; and then you know what is conditionally promi&s;ed and bequeathed to them that <HI>thir&s;t:</HI> For &s;imilitude is the ground of love. Now when the Fulne&s;s of the Promi&s;e is &s;een, there will appear &s;uch a &s;utablene&s;s and fitne&s;s of the pro|mi&s;e to his &s;oul, that he cannot but long for it.</P>

<P>Your <HI>&s;ixth</HI> trouble &s;et down in <HI>two</HI> heads, put into <HI>one</HI> for brevity, <HI>viz</HI> &s;ecret <HI>unwillingne&s;s</HI> to <HI>&s;eek God</HI> in the <HI>&s;tricte&s;t &s;olemn &s;ervices,</HI> before you enter into them; <HI>wearine&s;s</HI> of them while they la&s;t; and <HI>gladne&s;s</HI> when they are gone: the rea&s;ons which you mention are, partly fear of not u&s;ing them aright, together with melancholy, and la&s;tly, the &s;trictne&s;s of them.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> It is very true, there is abundance of wildne&s;s in our hearts, which naturally &s;eek to have their liberty abroad, and cannot endure to be pent in the narrow room of holy performances, extraordinary duties, &amp;c, no more than children can be pent up from their play. And hence we are weary of them, and glad to think of their departures and ends. And truly it is one of the mo&s;t grievous mi&s;eries that a holy heart can feel, and I be&s;eech the Lord of heaven and earth to keep you, and me, and all his for ever, while we are here in our valley, under the &s;en&s;e of &s;uch di&s;tempers, as our greate&s;t mi&s;ery. And there|fore me thought it was a &s;olemn &s;weet &s;peech of an hone&s;t man to his friend; who &s;eeing him oppre&s;&s;ed with &s;uch di&s;tempers as you mention, and perceiving him to droop under them, he came chearfully to him, and &s;uddenly &s;aid unto him; <Q>I can tell you good news, the be&s;t that ever you heard, <HI>viz,</HI> A&s;&s;oon as ever you are in Hea|ven,
<PB N="40" REF="006067_0054_102750C2498FE810">
you &s;hall &s;erve Chri&s;t without wearine&s;s:</Q> Which words well thought on, revived the man. That which I would &s;peak, with as much tender|ne&s;s of compa&s;&s;ion as I am able, to you, I refer to the&s;e things.</P>
<P N="1">1. That a child of God is never u&s;ually weary of the duty, but rather of his vile heart, to think of, and to look upon; that in the duty <HI>Chri&s;t's yoke is ea&s;ie, and his burthen light,</HI> to him that takes it on his neck and puts his Soul under it. The duty nakedly con&s;idered in it &s;elf, is glorious in his eyes, and &s;weet to his Soul; and hence &s;ometimes never well, but when he con&s;iders his dead, blind, barren, and &s;en&s;ele&s;s heart, that he is to carry to the duty, and that he fears, and has felt will abide with him in the duty: Oh! this grieves, here the Soul pincheth. An Hypo|crite is weary of the duty: a child of God re|joiceth in it; but he is weary of his &s;in, and un&s;avourine&s;s and wearine&s;s in the duty. I per|&s;wade my &s;elf Sir, that you may &s;oon mi&s;take your &s;pirit herein; you think you are unwilling to come to the duty; and are weary of it, when indeed, it is your glory, joy, and love; but it is becau&s;e you fear you can do it no better, that troubles you, that you have &s;uch a vile heart in it. And if your trouble be from hence, the good Lord increa&s;e it in you daily: and withal, ble&s;s the Lord, and &s;ay, <Q>Lord though I am weary of my vile heart, in the&s;e days of humiliation, in the&s;e Sabbaths; yet I ble&s;s thee, the days and duties them&s;elves thou knowe&s;t are dear unto me; It is not Lord becau&s;e I am weary
<PB N="41" REF="006067_0055_10275070B3B42138">
of thy word, but becau&s;e I can do it no better, I am weary of my &s;elf, and this vile heart:</Q> Here is much love in &s;uch a &s;pirit to the Lord. And believe it, Sir, your love wants not it's re|compences; and remember that the Lord re&s;pects you not according to your duties done, but ac|cording to your love in them, and to them. And therefore tho&s;e duties you are a&s;hamed to own, the Lord will not be a&s;hamed to crown.</P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider you mu&s;t and &s;hall be baited with the&s;e di&s;tempers of heart, &s;ometimes more, and &s;ometimes le&s;s, as long as you live. It is part of <HI>Paul</HI>'s body of death which he mu&s;t carry with him, till he come to bury him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Tho&s;e means</HI> which may help you to be freed from them (a little at lea&s;t) are the&s;e among many.</P>
<P N="1">1. Be but truly and really, not by fits and dark|ly, &s;en&s;ible of them: men in deep mi&s;eries, are not unwilling to be helped out.</P>
<P N="2">2. Judge ye not rigorou&s;ly of God, as though he were a bloody au&s;tere God; as he did of his ma&s;ter, who&s;e talent he had, and hence never improved it: but look upon God as having a Fa|ther's heart and affection towards you in the meane&s;t and greate&s;t performances; which is double, either to give you &s;trength to do what you cannot, <HI>(I can do all things through Chri&s;t;)</HI> or having come to him for it, to accept of what you would do for him, as if it were done: And this will make you joy in the poore&s;t performance, that though it be never &s;o full of vilene&s;s, yet the Lord out of his fatherly love, accepts of it as glo|rious.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="42" REF="006067_0056_102750C52355B338">
3. Renew <HI>morning</HI> and <HI>evening</HI> by &s;ad and <HI>&s;olemn meditation,</HI> the &s;en&s;e of God's love to you in Chri&s;t, and in every duty that he &s;ets you about; and love will love and like the yoke, and make the commandments that they &s;hall not be grievous to you.</P>
<P>Thus I have <HI>briefly done</HI> with <HI>your new troubles;</HI> which you mention, you &s;ay, becau&s;e you may not have the like opportunity of writing again. It may be &s;o, and therefore I have de&s;ired to &s;atisfie you, which I be&s;eech the Lord him&s;elf to do.</P>
<P><HI>Next</HI> you come to <HI>reply</HI> to <HI>my fir&s;t Letter,</HI> of which I have kept no copy, as I never did of any, and hence may and do forget what I writ then unto you. So much light as your Letter lends me to bring things to mind, I will gladly take, and be more brief in an&s;wer.</P>
<P>QUESTION I. <HI>Strength of Grace how obtained?</HI></P>
<P>You find the <HI>&s;trength of grace</HI> to be got in you rather by <HI>argumentation,</HI> than <HI>inward communica|tion and influence</HI> ari&s;ing from the union to Chri&s;t: And this troubles you.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> To which I an&s;wer the&s;e three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. That as the old &s;inful nature is communi|cated from <HI>Adam</HI> the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> to us, without any argumentation; &s;o the new nature, which is the food, foundation, and plot of all grace, is dif|fu&s;ed
<PB N="43" REF="006067_0057_10275074F5C39878">
into us by the <HI>&s;econd Adam</HI> when we are united to him, without argumentation. It is only by divine operation. The Lord leave not me, nor any friend I have, to a naked <HI>Arminian</HI> Illumination and Per&s;wa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">2. That to the increa&s;e of tho&s;e habits, and drawing out the acts of the new creature, the Lord is plea&s;ed to u&s;e moral and rational per&s;wa|&s;ions; as in the in&s;tance you gave, Chri&s;t died for us, then hence the love of Chri&s;t con&s;trains: But remember withal, it is not the bare medi|tation, or &s;trength of rea&s;on or per&s;wa&s;ion, that elicits &s;uch divine and noble acts in the heart and affection; but it is the blood of Chri&s;t &s;prinkling the&s;e &s;erious mediations, that makes them work &s;uch graces in the &s;oul; which I might &s;hew at large: which blood is the &s;alve, though argumen|tation is the cloth or leather to which it &s;ticks, and by which it is applied; but from &s;uch lea|ther comes no vertue, all of it is from the blood of Chri&s;t, which by argumentation heals the Soul. For if it were nakedly in the argumentation to &s;tir your heart, and to work &s;trength of grace; what &s;hould be the rea&s;on that &s;ometimes you are no more moved by all your argumentations, than a mountain of bra&s;s is by the winds? why &s;hould the &s;ame truth affect you at one time, and not at another, when you are as fitly di&s;po&s;ed to be affected as at the fir&s;t? Therefore con&s;ider it is not your rea&s;on and argumentation, but Chri&s;t's blood that doth all, by as admirable, and yet &s;ecret operation.</P>
<P N="3">3. Your union to Chri&s;t on your part in begun,
<PB N="44" REF="006067_0058_102750C9499D9410">
and partly wrought by the under&s;tanding: and hence the good that you get by it at any time, it is from your union, or part of it at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>QUESTION II. <HI>Of &s;piritual Union.</HI></P>
<P>Again you a&s;k me, whether <HI>Calvin</HI> doth not expre&s;s fully my thoughts about our <HI>Spiritual Union</HI> in his <HI>lib.</HI> 4. <HI>cap.</HI> 17.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> I an&s;wer, I have forgot what he has writ, and my &s;elf have read long &s;ince out of him; and for the pre&s;ent I have no books about me where I am; and therefore cannot &s;atisfie you in this: neither know I when I &s;hall &s;eek to find out the book and place: If I have lei&s;ure, I will either write to you, or tell &s;ome of your friends <HI>before I am gone,</HI> what he hath &s;aid or writ that way, &amp;c.</P>
<P>QUESTION III. <HI>Of the Cure of Athei&s;tical Thoughts.</HI></P>
<P>Again <HI>thirdly,</HI> You de&s;ire me to tell you <HI>how</HI> my &s;elf <HI>came to the Cure of Athei&s;tical Thoughts?</HI> and whether they did wear out, or whether they were rationally overthrown? &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. At fir&s;t they did wear out, meeting with fruitle&s;s and dead-hearted company, which was at the Univer&s;ity.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="45" REF="006067_0059_10275077D7F24F60">
2. The Lord awakened me again, and bid me beware le&s;t an old &s;ore brake out again: And this I found, that &s;trength of rea&s;on would commonly convince my under&s;tanding that there was a God; but I felt it utterly in&s;ufficient to per|&s;wade my will of it, unle&s;s it was by fits, whenas I thought God's Spirit moved upon the Chaos of tho&s;e horrible thoughts: and this I think will be found a truth.</P>
<P N="3">3. I did groan under the bondage of tho&s;e un|believing thoughts, looking up, and &s;ighing to the Lord, that if he were, as his works and word declared him to be, he would be plea&s;ed to reveal him&s;elf by his own beams, and per&s;wade my Heart by his own Spirit of his E&s;&s;ence and Be|ing; which if he would do, I &s;hould account it the greate&s;t mercy that ever he &s;hewed me. And after grievous and heavy perplexities, when I was by them almo&s;t forced to make an end of my&s;elf and &s;inful life, and to be mine own Execu|tioner; the Lord came between the bridge and the water, and &s;et me out of angui&s;h of &s;pirit, (as &s;he prayed for a child) to pray unto him for light in the mid&s;t of &s;o great darkne&s;s: In which time he revealed him&s;elf, manife&s;ted his love, &s;tilled all tho&s;e raging thoughts, gave return in great mea|&s;ure of them; &s;o that though I could not read the Scripture without bla&s;phemous thoughts be|fore, now I &s;aw a glory, a maje&s;ty, a my&s;tery, a depth in it, which fully per&s;waded: and which light (I de&s;ire to &s;peak it to the glory of his free grace, &s;eeing you call me to it) is not wholly put out, but remains, while I de&s;ire to walk clo&s;ely
<PB N="46" REF="006067_0060_102750CDA8ACFE90">
with him, unto this day. And thus the Lord opened mine eyes, and cured me of this mi&s;ery; and if any &s;uch ba&s;e thoughts come (like Beg|gars to my door,) to my mind, and put the&s;e &s;cruples to me, I u&s;e to &s;end them away with this an&s;wer; <HI>Why &s;hall I que&s;tion that Truth, which I have both known and &s;een?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But you &s;ay this remedy is good, <HI>viz,</HI> of <HI>Prayer;</HI> but that you cannot u&s;e it, e&s;peci|ally becau&s;e you que&s;tion the truth of God.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Yet, dear Sir, give not over this Trade; you will doubtle&s;s find it gainful, when it may be God hath laden you more with the&s;e thoughts, and made you loath your &s;elf for them. But the thing &s;eems &s;trange to me, if I mi&s;take you not, <HI>viz,</HI> that your heart will not be per&s;waded, but that you mu&s;t re&s;olve your doubts concerning the Perfection of Scripture, not by &s;eeking to har|monize tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages that &s;eem to cro&s;s one ano|ther, but by a&s;cribing &s;ome humanity or error, (if I may interpret you) to the penmen; &s;eeing St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith, <HI>We Prophe&s;ie but in part,</HI> and &s;ee|ing <HI>one</HI> of the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> leaves out the doxology in the Lord's prayer.</P>
<P>Sir, if you take the&s;e thoughts, ari&s;ing from the&s;e and the like grounds, as your burden, I do not blame you, but pity you in that re&s;pect; but if your judgment indeed think &s;o, I am &s;orry you &s;hould harbour &s;uch thoughts one hour with|in doors: for you know that <HI>holy men writ the Scriptures</HI> (but &s;o far they might err, but it is added) <HI>as they were in&s;pired,</HI> or as the Original has it, <HI>as they were moved or carried in the arms
<PB N="47" REF="006067_0061_1027507960CF5290">
of the Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> and &s;o how could they err? how could God lie? It is true, <HI>Paul</HI> did pro|phe&s;ie but in part; and is this an argument, be|cau&s;e he did not prophe&s;ie fully, therefore in &s;ome things he did not prophe&s;ie truly? I am per|&s;waded you will &s;ay, there are many things my poor thoughts have &s;ugge&s;ted to you, as true; and yet I am per&s;waded I do in them prophe&s;ie, if I may &s;o &s;ay, but in part. The Spirit of God directed the four Evangeli&s;ts to write; yet &s;o, as they did not all write what another writ, but in great wi&s;dom left &s;ome things doubtful and &s;hort in one, which are more clear and full in another: and hence the Doxologie is fully &s;et down in one, and not in another; and many rea&s;ons I could &s;et you down why, but that is needle&s;s. I grant you ought not to put up all with a charitable opinion of Scripture; but if you can, by rea&s;on, reading, and comparing, help your heart to a full per&s;wa&s;ion, this is Scrip|ture: But many things you cannot get &s;atisfac|tion for, by that way and means, but &s;till your Spirit will be left dark and doubtful; What cour&s;e will you here take for re&s;olution, <HI>which is Scripture?</HI> The Papi&s;ts &s;ay it is &s;o, becau&s;e the Church has chri&s;tened it for Scripture; you &s;ay you will &s;ee rea&s;on for it that it is &s;o, or el&s;e you cannot be &s;atisfied; then I fear you will ne|ver be &s;atisfied. I think, In this ca&s;e therefore <HI>the&s;e two</HI> things you are to do.</P>
<P N="1">1. To go to God by Prayer, to give you a re|&s;olution of all your doubts, and by &s;ome means or other, &s;ome light to &s;ee whether this is his word
<PB N="48" REF="006067_0062_102750CFE5757E28">
or not. 2. If this be his word, that he would per&s;wade your heart of it, that it is &s;o: For the lea&s;t re&s;olution which <HI>is</HI> Scripture, and which is <HI>not,</HI> is made by the &s;ame per&s;wa&s;ion, and &s;ole per&s;wa&s;ion of the &s;ame Spirit that writ the Scripture.</P>
<P>Concerning the <HI>Angels</HI> that appeared to <HI>Ma|ry,</HI> &s;ee <HI>Gerard;</HI> and he briefly, I think, will &s;a|tisfie you, in your an&s;wer to the particular &s;cru|ples about the Scripture &s;en&s;e, and the di&s;&s;onancy of them. Only this I will add to the la&s;t clau&s;e about the&s;e things, that if the Scripture be in&s;pired by the Holy Gho&s;t, and that not only in the &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of it, but in every word and &s;entence of it, which I think you will not doubt of, when you have con&s;idered it; then I think it will un|deniably follow, that the &s;ame Spirit of truth is al&s;o a Spirit of order; and hence the method of various penning of it, is from the Spirit too, which you &s;ay you &s;tick at.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 2. Again, to the <HI>latter part</HI> of your <HI>third</HI> complaint concerning your &s;pirit being bur|thened with <HI>involuntary infirmities,</HI> as <HI>burdens,</HI> but not as <HI>&s;ins;</HI> I &s;ay nothing now, becau&s;e I perceive by one part of your reply that the Lord has done you &s;ome good by the fir&s;t an&s;wer; only it is your grief you cannot fear them, nor condemn your&s;elf for them, as damning &s;ins. For &s;atis|faction of which, I hope this reply to your <HI>&s;e|cond</HI> trouble will give you &s;ome &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="006067_0063_102750809AC6A128">
QUESTION IV. <HI>How to know the Movings of the Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>Again to your <HI>fourth</HI> que&s;tion, to know whe|ther the&s;e changes you have &s;ometimes, and <HI>the&s;e movings of your Spirit,</HI> are not of <HI>natural temper,</HI> or <HI>God</HI>'s <HI>Spirit.</HI> It &s;eems I did a little mi&s;take the meaning; becau&s;e you meant not the main work of grace, but occa&s;ional &s;tirrings and mov|ings of the heart; as by reading &s;ome pathetical Letter, your Spirit is moved with joy or &s;orrow, which it may be will not be &s;tirred at &s;ome o|ther time; as by drinking a cup of wine, the &s;pi|rit is made more chearful and lively, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> I an&s;wer the&s;e <HI>three</HI> things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Fir&s;t, That it is very u&s;ual for natural af|fections to be rai&s;ed by a natural temper, as by drinking, eating, noveltine&s;s of the Go&s;pel. <HI>John</HI>'s candle-flies were ravi&s;hed with the Go&s;pel: Peo|ple are naturally moved &s;ometimes by a thundring Mini&s;ter, yet never a whit the more grace, &amp;c. And it is a good &s;peech of Doctor <HI>Ames: Armi|nian univer&s;al grace</HI> (as they de&s;cribe it) may be the effect of a good dinner &s;ometimes.</P>
<P N="2">2. That though the <HI>Being</HI> of grace depends not upon the temper of the body, yet the <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> of grace, and <HI>many gifts</HI> of grace, together with the <HI>feeling</HI> of it, doth. And hence a good din|ner, and &s;ometimes wine, to a &s;ad melancholy (if gracious) heart, may remove <HI>rem prohibentem</HI> that may keep grace, as joy and thankfulne&s;s, from working; and &s;o take the grace and draw it out,
<PB N="50" REF="006067_0064_102750D6D8FA5D08">
not create and diffu&s;e the grace. The Prophet called, you know, for a Mini&s;tril; which &s;ome think, and that upon good grounds, was to rai&s;e up his heavy heart, and make him chear|ful and fit to &s;peak: the body is the in&s;trument, which if it be broken, the be&s;t graces will hardly &s;ound; but if whole, then they will.</P>
<P N="3">3. If you would know when the&s;e things only draw out grace, or make a thing like unto grace in the Soul? I an&s;wer, by <HI>the&s;e two</HI> things chiefly.</P>
<P N="1">1. If it be true grace, it ever makes you <HI>more humble</HI> and vile in your own eyes, and &s;ay; Lord, why do&s;t thou give me any de&s;ire to thee, any chearfulne&s;s in &s;erving thee?</P>
<P N="2">2. It makes you <HI>more thankful,</HI> and to ble&s;s the Lord that he thus remembers you: For this is a <HI>&s;tanding rule,</HI> <Q>What ever comes from nature, and a Man's &s;elf, it ever builds up it &s;elf, and returns to &s;elf again; what ever grace comes from Chri&s;t, it drives a man out of him&s;elf, by making him <HI>humble</HI> and draws him unto Chri&s;t that &s;ent him, by making him <HI>thankful</HI></Q>. I think all graces, and &s;tirrings, and movings that have not this double effect in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, are to be &s;u&s;pected; and if they have, it is dangerous to doubt whether they are true or no.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="006067_0065_102750822883EED8">
<HI>QUESTION V.</HI> Of &s;eeing a Po&s;itive Providence.</P>
<P>Again, Your <HI>fifth</HI> thing about <HI>Providence;</HI> you &s;ay you cannot &s;ee a <HI>po&s;itive</HI> providence, al|though you do &s;ee a <HI>negative</HI> providence in all your occa&s;ions, and comforts, and cro&s;&s;es, you meet withal; as namely, you can thank God for not taking away your life, &amp;c, but you cannot &s;ee God giving it.</P>
<P>I <HI>an&s;wer,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Con&s;ider what I writ to you at fir&s;t about this que&s;tion in general.</P>
<P N="2">2. Ponder &s;adly whether any creature or ap|purtenance to it, has its <HI>Being</HI> from it &s;elf, or from the will and word of God; <HI>viz,</HI> I will have &s;uch a man to be, and &s;uch a memory to be, &amp;c. I think you will &s;ay nothing can make it &s;elf; therefore here is a <HI>po&s;itive</HI> providence in having life, liberty, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. Con&s;ider whether the &s;ame will and word that gives it a <HI>Being,</HI> together with all the ap|purtenances to it, doth not al&s;o give it <HI>Act</HI> and <HI>Motion.</HI> That it is &s;o, I thus demon&s;trate; (1) Every creature is made for an <HI>end;</HI> for no wi&s;e efficient, but works for &s;ome wi&s;e end: (2) That no creature can lead it &s;elf to its end, if &s;inful or irrational: (3) God mu&s;t and doth lead it by its &s;everal acts and movings to that end: Hence (4) Every <HI>act</HI> is determined by God.</P>
<P>And although I grant &s;ome creatures move freely, &s;ome nece&s;&s;arily; yet it is from a <HI>po&s;itive</HI>

will and providence that they move, act and &s;ee. Therefore you &s;ee what cau&s;e there is to &s;ee a <HI>po&s;itive</HI> providence in every thing.</P>
<P>Concerning <HI>the re&s;t of your letter;</HI> Oh that I had time and heart to write more; yet I hope I have writ enough for this time, and the Lord knows whether ever more or no. However I thank you heartily for improving me this way of writing, <HI>who have my mouth &s;topt from &s;peak|ing.</HI> I wi&s;h I had more &s;uch friends to deal thus with me, and my &s;elf more time, and a more fruit|ful head and heart to improve my &s;elf this, or any other like way for them: For who knows what breathings of God's Spirit are lo&s;t for want of writing, e&s;pecially when there is no &s;ea&s;on of &s;peaking? Truly Sir, I meet with few that are much troubled in that manner as your &s;elf; but they go on in an ea&s;ie, quiet, and very dangerous way: Which troubles, I per&s;wade my &s;elf, keep you awaking, when other virgins are &s;lumbring; and after which, I am per&s;waded, the Lord in|tends to u&s;e you for more than common &s;ervice, if you wade well through them. However as I &s;aid before, be not di&s;couraged, or too much perplexed in &s;orrow for them: For &s;urely, as far as I can gue&s;s, the Lord is preparing you for him|&s;elf by them I &s;hall not forget you, though I never &s;ee you: And I be&s;eech you, if you have any &s;park of affection toward me kindl'd by the&s;e few lines, remember when you are be&s;t able to pray for your &s;elf, <HI>to look after me and mine, and all that go with me on the mighty waters;</HI> and then

to look up and &s;igh to Heaven for me, <HI>that the Lord would out of his free grace but bring me to that good land, and tho&s;e glorious Ordinances;</HI> and <HI>that there I may but behold the face of the Lord in his Temple,</HI> though he never delight to u&s;e me there, though I and mine &s;hould po&s;&s;ibly beg there; and that if the Lord &s;hould call me to my &s;olemn work and &s;ervice for the good of <HI>his Church and People, and company that go with me, or are gone before me,</HI> that then the Lord Je&s;us would reveal his &s;ecrets to me, and enable me the little time I have to live, to be fruitful to him, and to have larger heart than ever for him. As for your &s;elf, I &s;hall de&s;ire the Lord to keep you blamele&s;s and un&s;potted in an evil world; and that as he has begun, &s;o he would perfect, and crown his divine graces and work in you; and that you may be pre&s;erved from national &s;ins, which &s;hortly bring national and mo&s;t heavy plagues; and that the pre&s;ence of the Lord may abide with you, and in you, until the Lord call for you. Remember my kind love to your Father, who&s;e name I have forgot, and by whom I could not &s;end the&s;e lines, being then hindred by bu&s;ine&s;s. Now the peace of Je&s;us Chri&s;t be with you, and keep you upright and blamele&s;s till death. And if I never &s;ee you more till the la&s;t and great day, then Farewel, Farewel.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> Three:</P>

<P>Q <HI>If every Per&s;on be God, how can they be di&s;tinct Per&s;ons, and not di&s;tinct GOD's?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, Becau&s;e one and the &s;ame thing may have many relative properties, and re&s;pects of be|ing, which in the God-head make di&s;tinct Per|&s;ons.

<P>Q. <HI>If the&s;e three Per&s;ons be but one GOD, what follows from hence?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That all the three Per&s;ons are Co-equal, Coeternal, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in, not &s;eparating from each other, and therefore delighting in each other, glorifying each other. <HI>Prov.</HI> 8.30.</P>

Q. <HI>What is Gods omnipotency?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is his almighty power, whereby he is able to bring to pa&s;s all that he doth will, or whatever he can will or decree. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 20.6. <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.21. <HI>Mat.</HI> 3.9. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 115.7.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What is GOD's Decree?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is his Eternal and determinate purpo&s;e, concerning the effecting of all things by his mighty power, according to his coun&s;el. <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.11.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What attributes or glory of GOD appear in his Decree?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A. Fir&s;t,</HI> His Con&s;tancy, whereby his Decree remains unchangeable. <HI>Numb.</HI> 23.19.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> His Truth, whereby he delivereth no|thing but what he hath decreed. <HI>Jer.</HI> 10.10.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> His deliberation, as it were for the be&s;t effecting of every thing according to his Wi&s;dom. <HI>Acts</HI> 4.24. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 104.24.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What is GOD's Wi&s;dom?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is the Idaea or perfect platform of all things in the mind of God, which either can be known, or &s;hall be done, according to the good plea&s;ure of his will. <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.3. <HI>Prov.</HI> 8.12, 13.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What is the good Plea&s;ure of GOD's will?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is the mo&s;t free Act of his Will, whereby he willeth him&s;elf directly, as the greate&s;t good, and all other things for him&s;elf, according to

his good plea&s;ure. <HI>Matth.</HI> 11.25. <HI>Prov.</HI> 16.4.</P>

<P>Q. <HI>What is the Co-operation of the three Per|&s;ons in GOD's Efficiency?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Whereby they work the &s;ame thing to|gether un&s;eparably. <HI>John</HI> 5.17, 19. and 16.13, 14.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>If they work the &s;ame thing together, How is it that &s;ome works are attributed to GOD the Father? as Creation; &s;ome to the Son, as Redemp|tion; &s;ome to the Holy Spirit, as Application?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This is not becau&s;e the &s;ame work is not common to all the three Per&s;ons, but becau&s;e that work is principally attributed in Scripture to that per&s;on who&s;e di&s;tinct manner of working appears chiefly in the work.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What is GOD the Fathers di&s;tinct manner of working?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> His working is from Him&s;elf by the Son, and through the holy Gho&s;t: <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 33.6. <HI>John</HI> 1.3: and hence the beginning, and &s;o the Crea|tion of all things is attributed to him.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What is GOD the Sons manner of work|ing?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> His working is from the Father, by the holy Gho&s;t; <HI>John</HI> 14.16: and hence the Di&s;|pen&s;ation of all things, and &s;o Redemption is at|tributed unto him.</P>

<HI>A.</HI> His working is from the Father and the Son; <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.26: and hence the Con&s;umma|tion of all things, and &s;o Application is attributed unto him.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS always a Matter of the highe&s;t Importance both with Regard to the Honour of God and the Intere&s;ts of the Souls of Men, that <HI>true Religi|on</HI> be <HI>ju&s;tly delineated;</HI> that it appear in its own native Excellency, Worth, and Beauty, with all its Goodne&s;s and Virtue; as that which conforms the <HI>Soul</HI> to the Image of the ble&s;&s;ed God, the <HI>Conver&s;ation</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> to the Rules of his Word, and the Example of Chri&s;t; and qualifies the Man for the glorious Employ|ments and Entertainments of the heavenly State, as well as for a faithful Di&s;charge of the Duties a&s;&s;ign'd him by Divine Providence in this pre&s;ent World.</P>
<P>When the Nature, the Properties and Effects of this <HI>divine Religion,</HI> which our <HI>LORD</HI> has taught and ex|emplified to us, are thus clearly opened and duly repre&s;ent|ed, this tends to rectify the <HI>Mi&s;takes</HI> of many Per&s;ons in religious Matters; to prevent and remove many <HI>Preju|dices</HI> Per&s;ons are di&s;po&s;ed to receive and entertain again&s;t Religion, through Mi&s;takes, either in them&s;elves or others; (altho' twill &s;till remain a &s;ad Truth, that Men's Hearts are naturally aver&s;e to the Power of Religion, though re|pre&s;ented in the mo&s;t agreeable Light.) It likewi&s;e tends to convince rational and thinking Per&s;ons, who are not given up to Vice and Prejudice, (e&s;pecially if withall they &s;ee it duely exemplified, in the Lives of tho&s;e who profe&s;s it) that <HI>of a Truth GOD</HI> is in this Religion. By this Means al&s;o the fal&s;e <HI>Hopes</HI> of <HI>Hypocrites</HI> are like to be detected and di&s;covered to their View; and thereby an Opportunity given them to e&s;cape out of the Snare, that would otherwi&s;e have proved fatal to their Souls. Nor
<PB N="ii" REF="006067_0101_102750FD5ED543C8">
can it fail of affording <HI>Comfort</HI> to tho&s;e who are truly <HI>Godly</HI> to find their own Religion exactly de&s;crib'd, and prov'd to be the Religion of God's Word. Hereby &s;ome of that Number, who are under grievous Doubts about their own &s;piritual State, and ready to reckon them&s;elves among the mo&s;t poor and mi&s;erable, may be brought to &s;ee them|&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of <HI>the Pearl of great Price.</HI></P>
<P>And as it is <HI>always</HI> a Matter of the highe&s;t Importance to have <HI>true Religion ju&s;tly repre&s;ented</HI> and de&s;cribed; &s;o there are <HI>&s;ome Times</HI> in &s;pecial, wherein <HI>tho&s;e Means</HI> that have the greate&s;t Tendency to give Per&s;ons right No|tions of it and &s;hew them wherein it's <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> does indeed con&s;i&s;t, in Di&s;tinction from all <HI>delu&s;ive Appearances,</HI> are in a peculiar Manner &s;ea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Such are the Times wherein a Diver&s;ity of Sentiments in Religion greatly prevails among the Profe&s;&s;ors of it; when many are di&s;po&s;ed to lay the Stre&s;s of Religion on tho&s;e Things which <HI>the Word of God</HI> makes little or no Account of, or perhaps wholly rejects, and to neglect and wholly pa&s;s by tho&s;e Things wherein the Soul and E&s;&s;ence of it is really contain'd.</P>
<P>How far this is the pre&s;ent State of Religian in &s;ome Places, and how much Stre&s;s is laid by many upon &s;ome Things, as being Effects and Evidences of exalted Degrees of Religion, when they are &s;o far from being of any Impor|tance in it, that they are really irreligious, a Mixture of &s;elf Love, Imagination and &s;piritual Pride, or perhaps the Influence of Satan <HI>transformed into an Angel of Light;</HI> I &s;ay, how much Stre&s;s is laid upon the&s;e Things by many I &s;hall not undertake to determine. But 'tis much to be fear'd, that while God was carrying on a glorious Work of Grace, and undoubtedly gathering an Harve&s;t of Souls to him&s;elf; (which we &s;hould always remember with Thankfulne&s;s.) Numbers of others have at the &s;ame Time been fatally deluded by the Devices of Satan and their own corrupt Hearts.</P>
<Q><P>It is to be feared that the <HI>Conver&s;ions of &s;ome</HI> have <HI>no
<PB N="iii" REF="006067_0102_1027514FF8381AE8">
better</HI> Foundation than this, viz. That after they have been under &s;ome Concern for their Souls a while, and it may be <HI>manife&s;ted</HI> &s;ome very great and uncommon Di&s;tre&s;s and Agonies, they have on a &s;udden, imagined they &s;aw <HI>CHRIST</HI> in &s;ome <HI>Po&s;ture</HI> or other, perhaps on the <HI>Cro&s;s bleeding and dying</HI> for their Sins; or it may be <HI>&s;miling on them</HI> and thereby &s;ignifying <HI>his Love to them.</HI> And that the&s;e and the like Things tho' mere Ima|ginations, which have nothing &s;piritual in them, have in|&s;tantly removed all their Fears and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, fill'd them with Raptures of Joy, and made them imagine they lov'd Chri&s;t with all their Hearts; when the Bottom of all was nothing but <HI>Self Love.</HI> For when they imagin'd that Chri&s;t had been &s;o good to them as to &s;ave them and as it were to &s;ingle them out of all the World; they could not but feel &s;ome Kind of <HI>natural Gratitude</HI> to him although they never had any <HI>&s;piritual View</HI> of his Di|vine Glory, Excellency and Beauty, and con&s;equently ne|ver had any Love to him for <HI>Him&s;elf.</HI>&mdash;Or that, in|&s;tead of having &s;ome &s;uch imaginary <HI>View</HI> of Chri&s;t as has been mentioned; in Order to remove their Di&s;tre&s;s and give them Joy, <HI>&s;ome</HI> having had a Pa&s;&s;age or per|haps many <HI>Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture</HI> brought to their Minds with Power, (as they expre&s;s it) &s;uch as that, <HI>Son be of good Cheer thy Sins be forgiven thee,</HI> and the like; they have immediately apply'd the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages to them&s;elves, &s;uppo&s;ing that God hereby manife&s;ted his peculiar Favour to <HI>them</HI> as if mentioned by Name: never con&s;idering that they are now giving Heed to new Revelations; there being no &s;uch Thing revealed in the Word of God as that <HI>this</HI> or <HI>that</HI> particular Per&s;on has, or ever &s;hall have his Sins forgiven: nor yet remembring that <HI>Satan</HI> can with a great Deal of &s;eeming Pertinency (and per|haps al&s;o with con&s;iderable Power) bring Scripture to the Minds of Men as he did to Chri&s;t him&s;elf. And thus <HI>the&s;e</HI> rejoice upon having &s;ome Scripture &s;uddenly &s;ugge&s;ted to them, or impre&s;s'd upon their Minds; &s;up|po&s;ing they are now the Children of God; ju&s;t as did

<P>And as is the <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> of this Sort of Per|&s;ons, &s;o are their <HI>after Experiences;</HI> the whole be|ing built upon Imagination, &s;trong Impre&s;&s;ions and &s;ud|den Sugge&s;tions made to their Minds: whence they are u&s;ually extreamly confident (as if immediately inform'd from God) not only of the Goodne&s;s of their own State, but of their infallible Knowledge and ab&s;olute Certainty of the Truth of every Thing they pretend to, under the Notion of Religion: and thus all Rea&s;on|ing with &s;ome of them is utterly excluded.</P>
<P>But 'tis remarkable of the&s;e that they are ex|tremely <HI>deficient</HI> in Regard of <HI>true Poverty of Spirit, Sen&s;e of exceeding Vilene&s;s in them&s;elves,</HI> &s;uch as frequently makes truly gracious Souls <HI>to groan being burden'd;</HI> as al&s;o in Regard of <HI>Meekne&s;s, Love</HI> and <HI>Gentlene&s;s toward Mankind, Tenderne&s;s of Con&s;ci|ence in their ordinary Affairs and Dealings</HI> in the World; and 'tis rare to &s;ee them deeply concern'd about the <HI>Principles</HI> and <HI>Ends</HI> of their <HI>Actions,</HI> and under Fears le&s;t they &s;hould not eye the <HI>Glory of God</HI> chiefly, but live to them&s;elves; or this at lea&s;t is the Ca&s;e in their ordinary Conduct whether civil or religious. But if any one of their peculiar No|tions which their Zeal has e&s;pou&s;ed be attack'd, they are then &s;o con&s;ciencious they mu&s;t burn if call'd to it, for the Defence of it. Yet at the &s;ame Time when they are &s;o extremely deficient in Regard of the&s;e precious

<P>Now as all proper Means are to be u&s;ed to cure the Er|rors of Men's Minds, e&s;pecially in Things of Religion, and as &s;omething of this Nature may therefore &s;eem pe|culiarly needful e&s;pecially in &s;ome Places; &s;o 'tis hopeful that the Publication of the following &s;mall Piece of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Shepard's</HI> will be made in &s;ome Mea&s;ure &s;er|viceable in that Re&s;pect.

<HEAD>MEDITATIONS AND Spiritual Experiences OF Mr. THOMAS SHEPARD.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 25. 1640. I Found <HI>my Heart and Mouth &s;traitned</HI> on the <HI>Lecture-Day,</HI> and for want of En|largement much troubled. Hence I e&s;&s;ayed to humble my Soul before God, which the Lord helped me to do in this Manner:</P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;aw the Vanity of Honour, and therefore, why &s;hould I be troubled for the Lo&s;s of it by the Want of Enlargements?</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) Becau&s;e it was but a Conceit in Men's Minds, of it &s;elf.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2) Becau&s;e it was naturally mo&s;t dear, and &s;o &s;tood between me and Chri&s;t.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="2">2. I &s;aw how fit it was, that the Will of Chri&s;t &s;hould be done, as well in denying, as in giving En|largements; though he &s;hould &s;trip me naked of them and all other Things.</P>
<P N="3">3. When my Heart objected, can you be content that Chri&s;t &s;hould lo&s;e his Honour, and his Ordinance be blemi&s;hed by your Straitning? I then &s;aw, I was
<PB N="2" REF="006067_0107_102751078942E920">
to be content to want them in Regard of my own Unworthine&s;s; and &s;o,
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) To be vile in my own Eyes for my Sin, that moves the Lord to deny.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2) To mourn that he &s;hould not glorify him&s;elf by me.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3) Then to pray him the more earne&s;tly to glorify him&s;elf by doing for me by his own Hand.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(4) I &s;aw therefore that I &s;hould leave my &s;elf with the Lord for that End, with him who all <HI>had,</HI> and only <HI>did</HI> all.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 29. In Prayer, I &s;aw my Heart very vile, fill'd with Nothing but Evil; nay Mind and Mouth and Life, and all void of God. Hence I prayed to the Lord to po&s;&s;e&s;s me again (1) Becau&s;e he only was good, (2) Becau&s;e he only was worthy.</P>
<P><HI>Decemb.</HI> 1. A <HI>&s;mall Thing troubled me.</HI> Hence I &s;aw, that though the Lord had made me that Night attain to that Part of Humiliation, to &s;ee that I de|&s;erved nothing but Mi&s;ery; yet I fell &s;hort in this other Part, viz. to &s;ubmit to God in any cro&s;&s;ing Providence or Command, but had a Spirit &s;oon touch|ed and provoked. I &s;aw al&s;o, that the Lord let Sin, and Satan prevail there, that I might &s;ee my Sin, and be more humbled by it, and &s;o get Strength again&s;t it.</P>
<P><HI>Decemb.</HI> 16. I &s;aw my&s;elf <HI>very mi&s;erable:</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e by my Sin I had &s;eparated my &s;elf from God, and turned far from him.</P>
<P N="2">2. That he was turned in his Face from me.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) I had no Sen&s;e of his Maje&s;ty, Power, Mercy, Being.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2) No Sen&s;e of his Love.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="3">3. I &s;aw Sin had &s;hut him from me, and my Un|belief, when he came to me, &s;hut him out of me. Hence I &s;aw a Need of a Mediator between us, and mourned.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="006067_0108_1027515B00FF3FC0">
I had a Glimp&s;e of the Fulne&s;s of Grace in Chri&s;t in Meditation on <HI>John</HI> 1.14, like a Fountain over-flowing and above all my Conceiving to poor Sin|ners which come to him. And hence my Heart began to be filled with lively Hope and A&s;&s;urance.</P>
<P><HI>Decemb.</HI> 26. In reading the 12th of <HI>Hebrews,</HI> That <HI>Things &s;haken and made mu&s;t be removed, that Things unmoveable may &s;tand;</HI> I &s;aw hence three Things:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That only Chri&s;t and his Word &s;hall remain and &s;tand un&s;haken.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That it's the &s;weete&s;t Thing to for&s;ake all Creatures, and there to abide as the Stone on the Foundation.
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) Tis born up with it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2) It re&s;ts there.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. I &s;aw how good it was to depart out of this World and to be with God, perfectly near Him, where no more &s;haking is, or &s;hall be.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>Decemb.</HI> 28. I <HI>de&s;iring to be led by the Truth,</HI> it was &s;ugge&s;ted, Follow it in your Practi&s;e, and prize it dearly, and I will go before you, and lead you into all Truth. But I &s;aw how little I loved the Truths and Ways of God; either practical or &s;pecu|lative Truth.</P>
<P>I &s;aw this Morning, how <HI>all my Mercies came from Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) He had plotted them,</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2) Purcha&s;ed them,</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3) Promi&s;ed them,</ITEM>
<ITEM>(4) Effected them.&mdash;And mine Heart was drawn near to the Lord with the&s;e Thoughts.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>Jan.</HI> 2. I &s;aw (1) <HI>Chri&s;t was unmoveable</HI> (2) That they which tru&s;t in Him are &s;o. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">25. <HI>like Mount Sion</HI> (3) I &s;aw that true Tru&s;t was that which <HI>David</HI> &s;peaks of P&s;al. 39. <HI>And now, Lord, what Wait I for? my Hope is in thee.</HI> His Heart a&s;ked him, Do&s;t thou hope for God? What do I,
<PB N="4" REF="006067_0109_1027510A61533830">
&s;aid he, hope for el&s;e? Hence I &s;aw, (1) That true Hope hath other Affections of De&s;ire and Love mixed with it. (2) That he that hopes for nothing but God, and for all Things only from God, hopes truly.&mdash;But I found a Temptation and a Stop.&mdash;Did I hope for all Things from God and only God's Things? Do I hope and long to be out of the World to be perfectly free from all Sin, and fill'd with all Grace? Here I &s;aw, this I could not do, 'till I did feel the infinite Vilene&s;s of Sin, and ta&s;ted a Happine&s;s in Ho|line&s;s, and placed all my Happine&s;s there; which I felt a Want of. And hence I bewailed my Condi|tion before the Lord in this Re&s;pect, and purpo&s;ed to make up the Breach herein, thorow his Grace; ble&s;&s;ing God, I &s;aw the wor&s;t of my Heart, as well as the Good of it.</P>
<P><HI>Jan.</HI> 6. I &s;aw I could have no Peace at Death, nor Hope that I &s;hould go to Chri&s;t, unle&s;s I did in|tend to <HI>do Chri&s;t's Work</HI> while I lived. Hereupon I con&s;idered, If I love him, my Soul will &s;eek him: So I con&s;idered, that I mu&s;t keep alive my Love to him in my Heart for this End. And why &s;hould I love him? Becau&s;e none was good, or could do me Good, but he. My Self, Sins, Child, could do neither me nor them&s;elves any Good; but only he. Then I con&s;i|dered, Shall I love him only becau&s;e he is only good to me?&mdash;I then reflected upon my &s;elf, and &s;aw my own Vilene&s;s and Selfi&s;hne&s;s; and how fit it was the Lord &s;hould never regard me on that Account; yet I re&s;olved to &s;eek him.</P>
<P>This Morning, in Meditation and Prayer; I was <HI>tempted</HI> to think, no Promi&s;e, no nor Command of God to &s;eek the Lord and &s;ubmit to him, was di|rected to me; but rather, that he had in Ju&s;tice for|&s;aken me, and &s;o let me do what I plea&s;e. But when I con&s;idered the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> how that they did but ma|nife&s;t that <HI>acting Will</HI> of a living God, revealing that
<PB N="5" REF="006067_0110_1027515F517E1A88" MS="y">
<HI>&s;ecret Will,</HI> which is ever &s;o &s;et as the Word reveals; my Soul was quieted, and I loved the Scriptures the more.</P>
<P><HI>Jan.</HI> 9. As I was walking in my Study, mu&s;ing on my Sermon in Q. 10. That God's <HI>Mercy</HI> was him&s;elf, as his <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> al&s;o was; the one to the Men that come to Chri&s;t; and to tho&s;e that are out of Chri&s;t, the other: Hence I con&s;idered, when I come to Chri&s;t there is no Wrath or Ju&s;tice to devour, but &s;weet Love: Wrath there is for refu&s;ing him, not el&s;e. It was then objected, But it is to the Elect only. The Lord let me then &s;ee, I had nothing to do with that, but to look on his Truth, which is to them that come to him, that he would &s;tand as a Rock between the &s;corching Sun and their Souls. Hence my Heart was &s;weetly ravi&s;hed, and began to long to die, and think of being with him. And my Heart &s;aid, Remem|ber to comfort your &s;elf thus, when you come to lie on your Sick Bed, to lie under this Rock, as in a hot Day. If one &s;aw a Rock in a hot Day, &s;hould he Say, That Rock will cool me if I be elected to it, and God has purpo&s;ed it; &s;o keep off in Fears? No, God has purpo&s;ed thus to be a Rock to all that come to him, and are drawn by his Love.</P>
<P><HI>Jan.</HI> 11. In the Morning, the Lord pre&s;ented to me the <HI>&s;ad State of the Church;</HI> which put me upon a Spirit of Sorrow for my Sins, as one Cau&s;e, and to re&s;olve in Sea&s;on to go vi&s;it all Families. But fir&s;t to begin with my Self, and go to Chri&s;t, that he may begin to pour his Ointment on me; and then to my Wife, and then to my Family, and then to my Bre|thren &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Jan.</HI> 12. On <HI>Lecture-Day</HI> Morning I began to feel my Heart &s;light and vilify what I was to deliver. But the Lord put it into my Mind, that though the Truth is a poor, mean Thing in it &s;elf, as every Ordi|nance al&s;o is; yet very glorious, as it is appointed and
<PB N="6" REF="006067_0111_1027510E8D680990">
&s;eparated of God for his own Ends. Hence I came to &s;ee the Glory of God's Ordinances, where it did lie; and that was, not in them&s;elves, but in God's &s;anctifying them for mo&s;t &s;weet Ends to communicate his Pre&s;ence and his lovely Plea&s;antne&s;s, and this Love operating with Power.</P>
<P><HI>Jan.</HI> 19. I &s;aw <HI>my loo&s;e Walking without God:</HI> and &s;o was put to a Stand, what to &s;ay of my &s;elf. I &s;aw that Hypocrites are far from humbling, becau&s;e far from Conviction: they hope &s;omething there is in them. But I brought my Heart to con&s;ider thus, If my State is good, then there is Cau&s;e of deeper Mourning for abu&s;ing the Lord, &s;o good; or my State is not good, and then there is Cau&s;e of Breaking be|cau&s;e I am &s;o wretched &s;till; and &s;o I went to Prayer.</P>
<P><HI>Jan.</HI> 21. I &s;aw <HI>God's Wrath</HI> kindled again&s;t <HI>Sin;</HI> and hence I &s;aw, and mourned for, the Evil of Sin, &s;o bitter to Him.</P>
<P>I was on the 26th of <HI>January much affected with the Lord's Goodne&s;s, and brought near to him.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t I found many Lets &s;tanding between me and the Lord in Prayer; as the Hiding of his Face, my own Heart turned from him. But then I &s;aw Chri&s;t, and his Command to come Hand in Hand with him to the Father. So that metho't I was with God and in his Pre&s;ence. And then this Truth came in, That if ever I got Good from the Lord in any Ordinance, I mu&s;t fir&s;t come into the Pre&s;ence of God, and &s;et him before me, as <HI>Cornelius</HI> and his Company did, and as in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 84.&mdash;And when I was here, methought it was &s;o &s;weet to pray and make my Moan to the Lord, as a God that could and was willing to pity. And &s;o I was &s;o knit to God that I intended never to depart from him again. (1) I &s;aw God was my Re&s;t; and hence, why &s;hould I depart from him to any other Thing, in Regard of his Goodne&s;s? (2) I &s;aw the Riches of his Mercy: Hence I came to get
<PB N="7" REF="006067_0112_10275160D9D1C978">
my Con&s;cience at Re&s;t, and to believe he would hear me, and be with me. (3.) I &s;aw his Glory: and hence &s;aw my whole Life &s;hould Re&s;t there, in acting for, and honouring of him, who alone was worthy.</P>
<P><HI>Jan.</HI> 28. I con&s;idered, being in his Pre&s;ence, <HI>what I did want?</HI> And it came in thus: (1) I did want <HI>Light,</HI> even &s;o much as to make me believe &s;tedfa&s;tly. (2) So much <HI>Faith</HI> as to make me cleave to God con&s;tantly. (3) For Want of this I departed from God. (4) By departing, all Woe came a main upon me; both Sin and Mi&s;ery. And &s;o I under&s;tood, better than before, how Unbelief was the Cau&s;e of all Woe.</P>
<P><HI>Jan.</HI> 30. When I was in Meditation, I &s;aw, <HI>When Chri&s;t was pre&s;ent, all Ble&s;&s;ings were pre&s;ent;</HI> as where any were without Chri&s;t pre&s;ent, there all Sorrows were. Hence I &s;aw how little of Chri&s;t was pre&s;ent in me. I &s;aw I did not cea&s;e to be and live of my &s;elf, that Chri&s;t might be and live in me. I &s;aw that Chri&s;t was to do, coun&s;el, direct, and that I &s;hould be wholly diffident of my &s;elf, and careful for this that he might be all to me. Hence I ble&s;&s;ed Chri&s;t for &s;hewing me this, and mourned for the Want of it.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame Time <HI>I &s;aw his Will,</HI> and <HI>how it was my Sin &s;o to pray, as to think to bring God's Will to mine,</HI> with a &s;ecret Murmuring, or thinking, 'Tis in vain to &s;eek, if the Lord do not &s;o. For what is this but Pride, and to command Chri&s;t, and to be above him, as if I were wi&s;er than he? But I &s;aw the Work of Prayer was, to bring my Will to his. And this gave me much Light, and &s;et my Heart in a &s;weet Frame. And hence I under&s;tood that Place, <HI>What&s;oever we a&s;k according to his Will, he heareth us.</HI> And this, not only when we pray according to his Will of Pre|cept and Promi&s;e, but when we have done, to bring our Wills to his &s;weet Sovereign Will, let him do with me what he plea&s;e; which is his Will of Sovereignty.
<PB N="8" REF="006067_0113_10275112BAD72BE0">
Now in the Time of Prayer, I con&s;idered, Why the Lord &s;hould command me to a&s;k Pardon, Peace, Brokenne&s;s of Heart &amp;c? And I con&s;idered, that it mu&s;t needs be that he, might give me the thing pormi&s;ed: (1) Becau&s;e his commanding Will is ever attended with a Promi&s;e. (2) Becau&s;e it was for his Glory, as well as my Good, that I &s;hould a&s;k. And hence he would give certainly, when I did a&s;k, e&s;pecially being &s;et on by his Command. Hence my Heart was much moved and melted, to con&s;ider of my Unbelief pa&s;t, and how much I had di&s;honoured Chri&s;t, thus to think of him, and to maintain hard Thoughts of him, that he will not hear. And &s;o began, that <HI>Day of Fa&s;t,</HI> to be|lieve &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 1. When I was on my Bed a <HI>Monday Morning,</HI> the Lord let me &s;ee, <HI>I was nothing el&s;e but a Ma&s;s of Sin, and that all I did was very vile.</HI>&mdash;Which when my Heart was &s;omewhat touched with, imme|diately the Lord revealed him&s;elf to me in <HI>his Fulne&s;s of Goodne&s;s</HI> with much &s;weet Affection. The Lord &s;uddenly appeared, and let me &s;ee, there was Strength in him to &s;uccour me, Wi&s;dom to guide, Mercy in him to quicken, Chri&s;t to &s;atisfie: And &s;o I &s;aw all my Good was there, as all Evil was in my &s;elf. Here|upon I began to entertain Thoughts of the Glory of this Mercy, if the Lord would become mine; &s;o that I &s;hould be &s;trong with God's Strength, and live by God's Life, and be guided by God's Wi&s;|dom &amp;c. And &s;hould become his, for him to take Care for me and love me, and I to pitch my Thought and Heart on him. I con&s;idered, this would be an Exchange of wonderful Love, for me to have God and not my &s;elf, and God to have me and give me him&s;elf.&mdash;</P>
<P>I aro&s;e with the&s;e Thoughts, and had &s;ome Pur|po&s;es to con&s;ider more of them. And on <HI>Monday Night,</HI> the &s;ame Day in Prayer and Meditation,
<PB N="9" REF="006067_0114_1027516263550B40">
the&s;e Thoughts came in from the Experience which I found then; viz.
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) I &s;aw <HI>all Fulne&s;s in God of all the Good I did need;</HI> and &s;o all my Good, or what might be good for me, there: And &s;o con&s;i|der'd, that the fir&s;t Thing the Lord reveals to draw the Soul to him&s;elf, is the Fulne&s;s of Grace in him|&s;elf.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2) Being doubting, Is this mine or no? I then con|&s;idered, that the Lord did invite me to come to him, becau&s;e I &s;aw that his Word did not bid me depart from him. And methought, in con&s;idering this, the Lord's Word, Come poor Creature, was &s;o &s;weet, that I came to him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3) Being thus come I con&s;idered, I mu&s;t cleave to him, and be knit to him. And then the Remem|brance of this, that all my Good, All was in him, made me &s;o to do, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, with dear Af|fections.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(4) Cleaving thus to him, I con&s;idered, whether he was become mine now, and I his? And here I &s;tuck a while, being loth to fancy &s;uch a Thing, and becau&s;e he did not cleave to me, as I could feel. But the <HI>Night after,</HI> God returned <HI>this An&s;wer.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>(1) That he had applied him&s;elf to me, becau&s;e he had drawn me to him&s;elf, who el&s;e could never have come. And hence, if he pitied me when far from, much more being now near to him. (2) Becau&s;e of the Riches and Fulne&s;s of his tender Grace, being come he would let it out. (3) Becau&s;e of his Pro|mi&s;e, <HI>Him that cometh I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out;</HI> and <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 14.4, 5.</P>
<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 9. I con&s;idered, <HI>When I could not bring Chri&s;t's Will to mine, I was to bring mine to his.</HI> But then it mu&s;t be thus. (1) That if ever he gives my De&s;ire it will be infinite Mercy, and &s;o his Will is good. (2) If he doth not, yet that I de&s;erved to be cro&s;s'd, and to feel nothing but Extremity.</P>

<HI>Feb.</HI> 14. When there was a <HI>Church Meeting</HI> to be re&s;olved <HI>about our Going away</HI> [viz. to <HI>Matabe&s;eck.</HI>] I looked on my &s;elf as poor, and as unable to re&s;olve my Self, or to guide others, or my Self in any Ac|tion, as a Bea&s;t: And I &s;aw my &s;elf, in Re&s;pect of Chri&s;t, as bruiti&s;h, as a Brute is in Re&s;pect of Man: And hence, (1) I left my &s;elf on Chri&s;t's Wi&s;dom. (2) I under&s;tood the Meaning of <HI>Prov.</HI> 30. That, tho' <HI>Agur</HI> knew he had Wi&s;dom, yet in Re&s;pect of Chri&s;t he was <HI>bruti&s;h;</HI> and al&s;o in Re&s;pect of Man. As it is &s;aid, <HI>There is none Good but God;</HI> and when <HI>God</HI> is called <HI>only wi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 15. I was in Prayer, and in the Beginning of it, that Promi&s;e came in, <HI>Seek me and you &s;hall live, Hag.</HI> 1.</P>
<P>Hereupon I &s;aw, I had Cau&s;e to &s;eek him only, alway; becau&s;e there was nothing el&s;e good, and becau&s;e he was alway good. And my Heart made choice of GOD alone, and he was a &s;weet Portion to me. And I began to &s;ee how well I could be without all other Things with him; and &s;o learnt to live by Faith. On|ly it came in, Why did I not de&s;ire to live with him alone in Heaven? And I &s;aw my Heart very apt to comfort it &s;elf in other Things be&s;ides him.</P>
<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 16. I &s;aw my Heart was <HI>not prepared to die, becau&s;e I had not &s;tudied to wean my Heart from the World;</HI> but I &s;aw, and &s;ought (1) The Glory of it. (2) The Re&s;t and Peace of it. (3) The Joy of it. When the Truth is, I &s;hould (1) &s;ee a greater Glory and Ho|nour of the Father in Heaven and be weaned from that. (2) I &s;hould &s;eek Re&s;t there only. (3) I &s;hould joy with that Joy only. O Lord, help me &s;o to do, and to pray for it, and &s;tudy it daily! For what is the Glory, Peace, Re&s;t, Joy of the World, a Creature, a peri&s;hing Thing to that of a God?</P>

<HI>Feb.</HI> 23. On Bed I con&s;ider'd, how &s;weetly the Lord was &s;ometimes with me, and &s;o how I &s;hould pre&s;erve that Spirit and go forward: But I &s;aw that any little Bu&s;ine&s;s, a little Forgetfulne&s;s &s;et Chri&s;t's Work backward again; Which was &s;ad to me.</P>
<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 23. At <HI>Night,</HI> after <HI>Lecture,</HI> I &s;aw <HI>my Vilene&s;s,</HI> and &s;aw, I was <HI>not to &s;eek my &s;elf in Prayer.</HI> And hence the Lord made me &s;ee nothing but Shame to belong to me. And hence praying for the Church, I a&s;ked my Soul, whether tho&s;e Prayers could be heard? And I found an An&s;wer, <HI>The Lord will hear the Prayer of the humble, will not de&s;pi&s;e their Cry.</HI> Which did &s;weetly chear my Heart, to &s;ee my Soul built on &s;uch Promi&s;es as <HI>David</HI> did u&s;ually comfort him&s;elf withal: For <HI>I Cry,</HI> For <HI>I tru&s;t in thee,</HI> For <HI>I am de&s;titute, He will hear the Cry of the Humble.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 24. I &s;aw <HI>how apt I was to think my&s;elf &s;omething.</HI> And the Lord put me on humbling Work, to &s;ee I was Wor&s;e than nothing, and to &s;eek no other Ad|vancement or Honour, but Mercy, if I might find that; which I thought was a great, yet holy Am|bition.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 2. I was ca&s;t down with the <HI>Sight of our Unworthine&s;s</HI> in this Church, de&s;erving to be utterly wa&s;ted. But the Lord filled my Heart with a Spirit of Prayer, not only to de&s;ire &s;mall Things, but with an holy Boldne&s;s to de&s;ire great Things for God's People here, and for my &s;elf; viz. That I might live to &s;ee all Breaches made up, and the Glory of the Lord upon us; and that I might not die, but live to &s;hew forth God's Glory to this and the Children of the next Generation. And &s;o I aro&s;e from Prayer with &s;ome Confidence of an An&s;wer. (1) Becau&s;e I &s;aw Chri&s;t put it into my Heart to a&s;k.&mdash;(2) Becau&s;e he was true to hear all Prayer.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 13. I purpo&s;ed to walk daily more clo&s;ely with God, according to the Rule.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="006067_0117_10275118F65AA470">
<HI>March</HI> 15. The Lord let in much Light. Many &s;weet Truths I wrote down. He made me al&s;o ca&s;t the Church on Chri&s;t's Care and Love, as being his Charge. I re&s;olved to hang fa&s;t about Chri&s;t, and to love him dearly, becau&s;e of his Goodne&s;s, as knowing none like him.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 17. I began to que&s;tion, <HI>whether Chri&s;tians generally were &s;o good as they &s;eem'd to be?</HI> I thought, [1] They were not &s;o good as the Lord would have them to be, from two Arguments. (1) From the Want of A&s;&s;urance generally among Men. Which argues God is angry, when he doth not appear ac|cording as he doth u&s;e to do to them who love his Name. (2) Becau&s;e Men are better generally under the Rod, than under Mercy. We &s;ee what an ad|mirable Spirit there is under &s;ore Afflictions, which Men cannot attain to, or keep, but then. Now [2dly] I thought that Men were not &s;o good as they appeared to be, (1) Becau&s;e very few are recovered to that Frame before Death, which God will bring them to, that get A&s;&s;urance. Few recover Holine&s;s by Mercy, or feel the eternal Good of &s;ore Afflicti|ons. (2) Becau&s;e many eminent Profe&s;&s;ors fall off and fall away. If they continue long, by &s;ome Trial or other they are made tran&s;parent. (3) Becau&s;e, though others of le&s;s Holine&s;s may be upright; yet for us that have more Means, not to be more holy and hum|ble, nay not &s;o humble and holy as tho&s;e that want Means, cannot &s;tand with Uprightne&s;s, generally. My Coun&s;el therefore is, <HI>Let all take Heed</HI> of being led by Example of Men, and thinking, We are good becau&s;e we are like them that be &s;o.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 18. I &s;aw, if <HI>my Mind</HI> acted, it &s;pun no|thing but <HI>Deceit and Delu&s;ion.</HI> If my <HI>Will and Affec|tions</HI> acted, there was nothing but <HI>dead Works.</HI> Oh! how do I need Chri&s;t to live in me? Yet I &s;aw, If a Man hath Eyes and Light, he will not lean to ano|ther
<PB N="13" REF="006067_0118_1027516AC6230F68">
to lead him and carry him, as when he wants both. So here, I &s;aw the Lord made me live by <HI>Faith,</HI> by making me feel a <HI>Want</HI> of both, to di&s;tru&s;t my&s;elf and tru&s;t more unto the Lord.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 19. <HI>After a Day of Fa&s;t.</HI> As I &s;aw in the Day, that I had <HI>Cau&s;e to weep exceedingly for my Sin,</HI> becau&s;e it did lie &s;o heavy, not only on the Father, but upon the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that they were &s;o wroth with me, that they hid their Faces: and hence I &s;aw that Sin lay heavy on their Hearts, and that therefore they were not only angry, but left me to my Sin, which cau&s;ed &s;ome Sorrow. So after the Day, I &s;aw and &s;aid, As <HI>Pride</HI> was <HI>my Sin,</HI> &s;o <HI>Shame</HI> &s;hould be <HI>my Portion.</HI> And many Fears I had of <HI>Eli</HI>'s Puni&s;hment for not reproving Sin in Mr. <HI>E.</HI> when I &s;aw it, and that &s;harply.&mdash;And here I &s;aw that God may, and doth &s;ometimes, make &s;ome one godly Man a Terror and dreadful Example of outward Mi&s;e|ries; that all others may fear that be godly, le&s;t his Com|mands &s;hould be &s;lighted, as he did by <HI>Eli.</HI> And &s;o I &s;aw, the Lord might ju&s;tly never let my Sins be purged away by Sacrifice.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 20. My Heart was much affected with the <HI>Riches of God's Mercy,</HI> in reading <HI>Jer.</HI> 36.3. That the very Threatning of God to de&s;troy, is to make Men return and pray, and &s;o live: Which is deep and dear Mercy. And that the Lord deals thus with &s;uch as are almo&s;t hopele&s;s. Yet if there be any Hope, the Lord pitieth; It may be they will return. Which made me, that Morning, in Prayer to pour out my Heart in true and plain Confe&s;&s;ion of my Vilene&s;s, which I knew, with Groans for Grace.</P>
<P>1641. <HI>April</HI> 2d and 3d. I was earne&s;t in Prayer for God's Favour and Love, and doubting of it for my &s;elf and others, becau&s;e I looked to God's &s;ecret Decree; at la&s;t I &s;aw it was God's Decree in the Go&s;pel, and his Will, that who&s;oever comes to Chri&s;t
<PB N="14" REF="006067_0119_1027511BD2B33370">
&s;hould have Life and Favour, and &s;o An&s;wer to all Prayers for him&s;elf and others; which gave me &s;ome &s;weet A&s;&s;urance!</P>
<P>After this, I &s;aw the Lord might deny all our Prayers for outward Things. I begg'd therefore for Mercy: And that being granted, I had an End of all my Suits and Reque&s;ts for my&s;elf and others: And there my Heart &s;tayed.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 4. and 5. On <HI>Sabbath-Morning (April 4) I &s;aw the Lord frowning on me in &s;everal Provi|dences.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That he was hid from me, who&s;e Face el&s;e would &s;hine brighter on me, than ten Thou&s;and Suns.</P>
<P N="2">2. That he was angry with my Prayers, and had been, and is &s;till, angry.</P>
<P N="3">3. Nothing I did, nay none under my Shadow pro&s;pered.</P>
<P N="4">4. I &s;aw I wanted Wi&s;dom for my Place, to guide others.</P>
<P N="5">5. I &s;aw I wanted a Spirit of Life within to make me exemplary without.</P>
<P N="6">6. I &s;aw I wanted the Power of the Holy Gho&s;t, and that I was not mighty in Word and Spirit and in Admini&s;trations.</P>
<P N="7">7. I &s;aw a &s;ecret Eye I had to my Name in all I did; for which I judged my &s;elf worthy of Death, but I did not grow weaned from all created Glory, from Honour, Wi&s;dom, E&s;teem of others &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 5. I &s;aw I did not remember the Sins of my Youth; nay the Sins of one Day I forgot the next Day; and &s;o I &s;pent my Time.</P>
<P>I was on my Bed praying this Morning, and the Lord helped me to pour out my Heart before him. And I &s;aw, <HI>I could plead nothing in my &s;elf in regard of any Worthine&s;s and Grace, or any Thing in Regard of God's Providence, or Promi&s;e; but only his good

Plea&s;ure.</HI> I &s;aw it was not, if I will, but if he will, then I &s;hould &s;ee and believe and live. And here I hung, pleading, how good, how pitiful and tender, how free this Will was. I &s;aw it &s;tood immoveable, till it moved it &s;elf toward me. I &s;aw God's Will was, that I &s;hould come; but I was afraid of mine own Activity and Working; and hence pleaded, Lord turn me, draw me, and I &s;hall come!&mdash;And &s;o I beg|ged for my Wife, Child, Friends, Church, with Earne&s;tne&s;s, that the Lord would give us but <HI>Mercy,</HI> and not &s;uffer his Name to be polluted by us and by our Debts, though he &s;hould not honour him&s;elf by us! And if <HI>Mercy</HI> would make us poor and vile, ble&s;&s;ed be it.&mdash;And if it would lead us and carry us to &s;ome other Place, and cover and over-&s;hadow us, ble&s;&s;ed be it. And I had &s;ecret Hints, that the&s;e Prayers from our Wants were but Preparations for future Mercies; and that we &s;hould &s;ee his Glory in the Land of the Living.&mdash; Then I began to ari&s;e after Prayer, without Faith as I thought, yet leaving all to his Grace. But the Lord &s;hewed me, how he had come to me and &s;tirred up Prayers, (1) according to his own Will; (2) For his own Ends. For though I &s;ought my &s;elf, yet &s;eeing this, I entreated the Lord to glorify him&s;elf, and make us like unto his. And then I &s;aw, how great a Sin it was to make <HI>Feeling</HI> a Ground and cau&s;e of my <HI>Faith.</HI> And I al&s;o tho't, how exceedingly I &s;hould honour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, if I did <HI>believe,</HI> before I <HI>felt;</HI> How I &s;hould honour the Truth of Chri&s;t who hath &s;aid, he is one <HI>that hears Prayers.</HI>&mdash;I &s;aw al&s;o a &s;ecret Di&s;temper of my Heart, how I grew faint in Prayer, contrary to the Rule, <HI>Luk.</HI> 18. viz. not only by Di&s;couragement but al&s;o by Encouragement, and Enlargement and Affections in Prayer.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 10. I had many Thoughts which came in to pre&s;s me <HI>to give my &s;elf to Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> which was
<PB N="16" REF="006067_0121_1027511D5B003370">
the dear be&s;t Thing I had. And I &s;aw, If when I gave my &s;elf to Chri&s;t, He would give him&s;elf to me again, that it would be a wonderful Change: to have the bottomle&s;s Fountain of all Good communicated to me. Thus two or three Days I was exerci&s;ed about this. And at la&s;t, (which was the Day before I fell &s;ick on the <HI>Sabbath</HI>) in my Study, I was put to a double <HI>Que&s;tion.</HI> (1) Whether Chri&s;t would take me, if I gave my &s;elf to him? (2) Whether I might take him again upon it? And I re&s;olved to &s;eek an <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to both from God, in Meditation. So after Dinner on the <HI>Saturday,</HI></P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 11. <HI>I gave my &s;elf up to the Lord thus;</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. I acknowledged, all I had or was, was his own; (as <HI>David</HI> &s;pake of their Offerings) and &s;o I acknow|ledged him the Owner.</P>
<P N="2">2. I re&s;igned not only my Goods and E&s;tate, but Child, Wife, Church and Self unto the Lord, out of Love, as being the be&s;t and deare&s;t Things which I have.</P>
<P N="3">3. I prized it as the greate&s;t Mercy, if the Lord would take them, and &s;o de&s;ired the Lord to do it.</P>
<P N="4">4. I de&s;ired him to take all for a threefold End, (1) To do with me what he would, (2) To love me, (3) To honour him&s;elf by me and by all mine.</P>
<P N="5">5. Becau&s;e there is apt to be a &s;ecret Re&s;ervation in our &s;eeming De&s;ires, That the Lord &s;hould do all; and the Soul gives up it &s;elf to the Lord, but 'tis that the Lord may plea&s;e my Will, and love me; and if he doth not plea&s;e me, then the Heart dies: Hence I gave up <HI>my Will</HI> al&s;o into the Lord's Hand, to do with it what he plea&s;e.</P>

<P N="7">7. That he would keep me al&s;o from all Sin and Evil.</P>

<P>But then I did que&s;tion, <HI>Will the Lord receive me, and take me to do me good everla&s;tingly?</HI> Becau&s;e I gave up my Friends, and the whole Church to the Lord al&s;o, as I did my &s;elf: <HI>And will the Lord take all them?</HI></P>

<P><HI>April</HI> 28. I <HI>finding my Heart re&s;t on Chri&s;t</HI> and peaceably quieted there; hence, when I &s;aw the out|ward good Things which others did enjoy, I was &s;weetly comforted with this, <Q>yet I have Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;t is mine, others have other Things.</Q></P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 29. I &s;aw this Di&s;temper (when I &s;aw <HI>my &s;udden Anger</HI>) viz. That I was troubled at that which cro&s;&s;ed <HI>me,</HI> not <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and plea&s;ed only with that which plea&s;ed <HI>my &s;elf,</HI> and not <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> For [1] in all Wrongs and Cro&s;&s;es there is a double Cro&s;s.

<P><HI>April</HI> 30. I que&s;tioned, <HI>whether any Sin was a greater Evil than Unbelief?</HI> And I &s;aw that <HI>Union to Chri&s;t</HI> was <HI>my greate&s;t Good:</HI> Hence Unbelief is a greater Sin than any other Sin. And here I &s;aw God's rich Grace that had not only made <HI>my Di&s;union from Chri&s;t</HI> by Unbelief a Mi&s;ery, but al&s;o the greate&s;t Sin, as being cro&s;s to his Command: And hereby

my Heart was affected. And I &s;aw that whatever my Sin was, yet now there was no Sin like Di&s;union from Chri&s;t by Unbelief; and that I ought not to commit the greate&s;t Sin in departing from Chri&s;t, be|cau&s;e of le&s;s Sins again&s;t the Law. For it was an <HI>un&s;peakable Mercy</HI> to make <HI>my Union to Chri&s;t the greate&s;t Good, my greate&s;t Good.</HI> 1. Becau&s;e I can never in this Life perfectly obey and cleave to the Will of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e if that be Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, then once ble&s;&s;ed, always ble&s;&s;ed: So once united ever united. So I &s;aw the Go&s;pel, in commanding me <HI>to believe,</HI> did com|mand me to partake of the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; and who would not be glad of that? <HI>Adam</HI>'s Happine&s;s was, to <HI>do God's Will;</HI> but <HI>ours</HI> to <HI>cleave to God in Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 5. I &s;aw <HI>I was without all Sen&s;e, as well as Sight of God, e&s;tranged from the Life of God:</HI> For I &s;aw I re&s;pected <HI>Man</HI> more than <HI>God,</HI> to plea&s;e him rather than God. And why &s;o? Becau&s;e I was &s;en|&s;ible of the Pre&s;ence of Man. So if I had commit|ted any Sin again&s;t Man, I &s;hould be a&s;hamed; but I blu&s;h not before God. I was not &s;en&s;ible of his Glory, Maje&s;ty, Beauty and Love. And hence I had no Sen&s;e of Sin, becau&s;e I had no Sen&s;e of God. &mdash;And hence with Sadne&s;s I &s;aw my Widow-like Separation and Di&s;union from my Hu&s;band and my God, and that we two were now parted, who had been nearer together once. And I &s;aw, (though not deeply) what my Iniquities are, to preferr the Creature above the Creator ble&s;&s;ed for ever? And as the Life is, the Sen&s;e is.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 6. <HI>The Lord Je&s;us</HI> revealed him&s;elf thus to me viz. That as he was <HI>Mercy and Love to all meek, hum|bled believing Sinners that came to him;</HI> &s;o he was <HI>Fire and Wrath again&s;t all ob&s;tinate Sinners, that would not bow to him: but go on in their Sin.</HI> And &s;o I &s;atisfied that Doubt; when my Heart &s;aid, Why &s;hall I be

troubled for Sin, &s;eeing God in Chri&s;t takes it not much to Heart, but forgives, bears, pardons and he was all Love and no Wrath in him? I replied again, He is &s;o to all meek ones, that &s;top, &s;toop and yield: But he takes the lea&s;t Sin exceedingly to Heart and very ill, when Men will go on in it. My Heart was much comforted with the Knowledge of this, and wrought to &s;ome more Fear and Love to him, and re&s;olved to give up my &s;elf to Him.&mdash;I &s;aw al&s;o <HI>the Greatne&s;s of Sin,</HI> to &s;trike him by it, who is the Glory, of Heaven and Earth, and who takes it ex|ceeding ill at my Hands, if I do, or e&s;pecially per|&s;i&s;t in it. The Lord al&s;o pre&s;s'd my Spirit to plea&s;e Chri&s;t in <HI>every</HI> Thing; not in &s;ome Things only, but to be <HI>ever</HI> plea&s;ing him&mdash;I &s;aw al&s;o, that I was not in good earne&s;t de&s;irous that Chri&s;t would take away Sin by the Lo&s;s of Name or Goods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 7. I &s;aw in Prayer, that <HI>before I,</HI> or any other <HI>could &s;eek or &s;erve the Lord, I was to &s;et up the Lord in the Throne of my Mind and Heart,</HI> both in his <HI>Greatne&s;s,</HI> and in his <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> to me. And the Lord gave me &s;ome Glimp&s;e of both that Morning; yet I &s;aw that all was little enough to make me &s;eek him and &s;erve him. For I &s;aw my Heart aver&s;e from his Will, and that the Lord mu&s;t be exceeding great and dear in my Heart, or el&s;e it would never &s;eek and &s;erve him. And &s;o I con|&s;idered, If it be &s;o hard to &s;eek the Lord when he is &s;et up, how difficult to &s;eek or &s;erve him when he is ca&s;t down? Surely if there be any Services or Seekings without &s;etting up the Lord, they are Hypocri&s;ies.</P>
<P>I &s;aw al&s;o, <HI>how great my Sin would be, not to be acquainted and grow familiar with the Lord;</HI> when he hath humbled him&s;elf into my Fle&s;h for that End, and to make a near Conjunction between him&s;elf and me. For we are joined to Man, who is Fle&s;h of our Fle&s;h, &s;ooner, than with an Angel, or with God.
<PB N="22" REF="006067_0127_102751290C0F0558">
When the Devil comes to make a Covenant, he a&s;|&s;umes the Shape of a Man. And here I &s;aw that our Union is fir&s;t to the humane Nature, and &s;o to the Divine: Becau&s;e the Divine Nature comes down into the humane, that it may be a Mean of Con|junction of the Soul to God, and of God to the Soul.&mdash;And I &s;aw, that as we are &s;ooner conjoined to Man; &s;o God in Man is &s;ooner conjoined, or he more ea&s;ily conjoins him&s;elf to us, who is filled with real humane Bowels for that End, and hath &s;uffered that no Ju&s;tice might &s;top him in his Work.&mdash;</P>
<P>I con&s;idered, that <HI>when Prayer is vehement for a Ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> and <HI>our Humiliation and Breaking, from Sin is &s;uitable to our Affection, God ever an&s;wers them.</HI> Hence, let Men ob&s;erve, if they are earne&s;t for any outward Ble&s;&s;ing, and their Hearts are &s;tirred up &s;o as to believe they &s;hall have it, let them &s;ee if their <HI>Humiliation</HI> was proportionable. Hence al&s;o 'tis, that when the Lord denies us, 'tis ever to humble us, which is Mercy; and we &s;hall &s;ee that we have mo&s;t need of that. And hence al&s;o when humbled, we may reap the Fruit of Prayers made many Years before.</P>
<P>On <HI>Saturday</HI> [May 8] at Night <HI>I &s;aw Union to God to be the greate&s;t Good; and my Sin in not cleaving wholly to him with all my Heart, the Height of all Sin,</HI> from <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 10.1. Hence in Prayer I &s;aw Sin my greate&s;t Evil. 1. Becau&s;e it had &s;eparated me from the greate&s;t Good. 2. Becau&s;e it kept my Heart with a &s;ecret Love to it from returning again to him, as my greate&s;t Good.&mdash;3. Nay I &s;aw that it made me make my Death my Life; viz Neglect of living and acting for God my very Life; and my War with GOD, my Peace; and my Damnation my Salvation: Hence I mourned.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 12. <HI>When I was &s;tirred up to give Thanks for Mercys,</HI> I was put to a &s;tand, <HI>Why not for Evils as well?</HI> Seeing both were from God's Will. And the Lord
<PB N="23" REF="006067_0128_1027517ADD47E150">
put it into my Heart to &s;ee that it is becau&s;e God's chiefe&s;t, deare&s;t Attribute is honoured more that Way. And &s;o I &s;aw I was not to be thankful becau&s;e the Ble&s;&s;ing &s;uited me, but becau&s;e God's deare&s;t and mo&s;t beloved Attribute of Grace and Mercy was glorified hereby&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;aw al&s;o, <HI>how one Sin begat another</HI> in this Coun|try, and we did not cea&s;e to increa&s;e therein. And hence I &s;aw, what ju&s;t Cau&s;e the Lord had to &s;trike us with &s;ore and great Wants, and yet how, if Sin were repented of by preaching again&s;t it, the Lord would return. So I &s;aw it my Duty to preach again&s;t them.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 18. In Prayer I was a&s;hamed that I &s;hould not &s;erve the Lord, as I had done my Lu&s;t and my Sin.</P>
<P>I &s;aw al&s;o that <HI>God was beforehand with Men.</HI> (1) In that he had reconciled the World to him&s;elf. (2) That he did be&s;eech them to be reconciled. Now I &s;aw that all the Work did lie upon Man. For if the Party offended fir&s;t &s;eek to be Friends, I need not call in Que&s;tion his Willingne&s;s, but my own wicked Ma|liciou&s;ne&s;s. Here I &s;aw, that if it be &s;o with Man, and he do not come in to him that &s;eeks for Favour, 'tis either (1) from Contempt; or (2) Anger, quar|relling at his Dealing; or (3) Malice, yet the Lord wraps up all in one Word, <HI>Enmity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 21. In Prayer I de&s;ired two Things (1) That God only might be &s;weet, (2) That his Will might be mine. At which Time it came into my Heart, If you &s;incerely de&s;ire <HI>the&s;e two,</HI> you will de&s;ire to be in Heaven, where the&s;e two are fully perfected. For I &s;aw though Death was naturally terrible, yet I &s;ecretly rejoiced to think of that infinite Mercy, when God alone &s;hall fill my Soul with his immediate Infi|nitene&s;s.</P>
<P>On the <HI>Sabbath, May</HI> 23. I came to a &s;erious

And I &s;aw he would have me, becau&s;e he had given me an Heart frameable to his Will therein; and it did much refre&s;h me to think, that the Lord &s;hould de&s;ire me to live thus, as if he took Delight in my &s;inful Prayers. And &s;o I con|&s;idered, <HI>how I might live by Prayer?</HI> And I &s;aw (1) I &s;hould &s;ee what Evils accompany every Thing I go about, (2) what Good I need to have conveyed by every Thing. There are &s;pecial Evils of Sin to be avoided, and &s;pecial Good Things to be con|veyed. And I a&s;ked, <HI>why I was to live by Prayer?</HI> And I thought, (1) Becau&s;e it did honour God, (2) kept me from many unknown Evils which el&s;e would befal me: (3) Becau&s;e el&s;e I could not have A&s;&s;u|rance any other Prayers &s;hould be heard, which were not my Life. To pray by Fits is not the Way to find Help in Time of Trouble.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 7. When I was at Meeting to receive in Mem|bers, I con&s;idered of <HI>the Rea&s;on why the Lord helped me to pray, and yet did not an&s;wer me;</HI> nay Things did not &s;tir nor move, but rather Things in Church and el&s;e-where in Men's Spirits went wor&s;e and wor&s;e. So I &s;aw hereby, what need I had of all the Prayers of others, and to get their Prayers with Fa&s;tings with
<PB N="30" REF="006067_0135_10275134BB79CCB0">
me for tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings which come hardly from the Lord. Yet I &s;aw the Lord could an&s;wer ea&s;ily and &s;uddenly, but he would not: And the Rea&s;on was, (1) Becau&s;e he did delight in my Prayers, and hence he kept me (Mu&s;ician-like) a&s;king; (2) Becau&s;e he delighted in the Prayers of many together; (3) Be|cau&s;e he would let me &s;ee I did need the Prayers of others, as well as my own. And I &s;aw al&s;o that all Prayers of Faith are heard in&s;tantly in Heaven, but many Times they are not heard from Heaven until many Shoulders are &s;et to the Work.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 7. I &s;aw that notwith&s;tanding all my Sins, I &s;hould &s;ee there was no Condemnation to me, nor &s;hould I fear it; (1) being in Chri&s;t by Faith; (2) Walking after the Spirit, becau&s;e I re&s;i&s;ted and mourned under the Fle&s;h and Body of Death, as <HI>Paul</HI> did. Yet I &s;aw, I &s;hould look upon all my Sins with an Eye of Lamentation, as being, (1) cro&s;s to God, (2) &s;o contrary to the Life of Chri&s;t in me. For I &s;aw that I made a Difference of &s;ome Sins in a Chri&s;tian; (1) Some did cau&s;e God's fatherly Anger, and were more wilful, and Con&s;cience upbraided me for them; (2) Others were Weakne&s;&s;es, for which Chri&s;t pitied me. And here my Heart began to think, What need of &s;uch bitter Mourning for them? Now I &s;aw, the Apo&s;tle (<HI>Rom.</HI> 7.) mourned alike for all. He feared none for Condemnation; he mourned for all with bitter Lamentation. So I was &s;weetly en|lightned, and purpo&s;ed, thus to walk; and not to mourn only for &s;uch Sins, as did hide the Face of my God, but for Sin in General, which goes again&s;t his Life, yea is contrary to the End of Chri&s;t's Death, and cro&s;s to the Will of God. And I &s;aw it my Duty to mourn, and that bitterly with unutterable daily Sighings under the&punc;</P>

Wilderne&s;s among &s;o many Snares. Yet con&s;idering, that through God's Providence we were fallen here; I &s;aw it was my Duty, and purpo&s;ed it &s;hould be my Work to do all that I could, and be the more earne&s;t with God in Prayer, and to <HI>fingere Fortunam,</HI> make the be&s;t of what is, becau&s;e bad, at be&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;aw al&s;o, how &s;ome godly Men and Friends, who, though they were &s;incere, yet were very weak, and could not go thorow the pre&s;ent Temptations of the Place of Wants, &amp;c, with that Contentedne&s;s and Sweetne&s;s of Spirit, as was meet. And when I &s;aw that po&s;&s;ibly it might not come from Want, but Weakne&s;s of Grace only; my Bowels yearned towards Chri&s;t's weak ones, and I was &s;ecretly rai&s;ed up with Hopes, that the Lord Je&s;us would pity them, be|cau&s;e they were weak and faint, and would lead tho&s;e gently who were with Young. And it was &s;pecial Ground of Faith and Prayer for them.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 9. Being &s;uddenly &s;urprized by a Sin before the Sacrament, my Con&s;cience was awakened, and my Heart checkt me for it. Yet the Lord turned the Meditation of the Evil of this Sin to great Good to me; viz, Not only to &s;et my Heart again&s;t it and all other Sins, but the Lord thereby let in a mo&s;t glorious Light (as I thought) of his Go&s;pel and of the Way of Believing for Pardon, more than ever I had: which was this;</P>
<P>I &s;aw that the Nature and Practice of a Man awak|ened with Sin was this, viz. when Con&s;cience &s;mites him with the Fear and Terror of God, <Q>Do&s;t think God loves thee, or hath &s;anctified thee, who do&s;t ru&s;h upon &s;uch Evils again and again? No, he is angry with thee for thy Sin.</Q> Hereupon the Heart being de&s;irous of Favour thinks <HI>&s;ecretly</HI> thus; As Sin hath provoked God's Anger, &s;o, he being merciful, I hope the leaving off my Sin and turning from my Sin will pacify and plea&s;e the Lord again; and &s;o doth
<PB N="32" REF="006067_0137_10275137978001A8">
<HI>&s;ecretly</HI> think to plea&s;e God and pacify God, and &s;o indeed to &s;atisfie God for that Sin, and &s;o for&s;akes Sin. And now in Time of Sickne&s;s, or Horror thinks, that the Lord is pacified and pleas'd with this, according as &s;ome Scriptures <HI>&s;eem</HI> to &s;peak. Or el&s;e it &s;ecretly thinks, Faith in Chri&s;t's Blood and Turning from Sin al&s;o, both together do plea&s;e, and that now all is quiet. Hereupon, remembring that Chri&s;t's Blood appre|hended by Faith was the only Atonement, I con|ceived this was not the Way that I &s;hould walk in; but rather this:</P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;aw that when the lea&s;t Sin, as well as the greate&s;t, was committed, my fir&s;t Work was to &s;ee that I (in my &s;elf con&s;idered) mu&s;t die eternally for that Sin, and &s;o &s;hould pa&s;s Sentence upon my Self for it. And here I &s;aw that by this the Elect did, and that I &s;hould, &s;ee how cro&s;s and contrary and grievous Sin is to God, who is &s;o incen&s;ed by it, as he will be the Death of a Sinner for it. And &s;o I &s;aw that hereby my Soul &s;hould be humbled aright, feeling Sin by this Means, not only as bringing eternal Death on me, but as being cro&s;s and provoking to God. And this I &s;aw was to be done, not only at fir&s;t Conver&s;ion, but all my Life; <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.20. that &s;o hereby the Soul might increa&s;e in Humiliation and in an high E&s;teem of the Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. I &s;aw, that next to this I was to fly to Chri&s;t's Blood and Righteou&s;ne&s; for Satisfaction and Peace. And here I &s;aw three Things (1) That this was Faith, to fly to Chri&s;t's Death in Sen&s;e of my own Death&punc; (2) That this Act was exceeding plea&s;ing to God, even after all Sins: nay that it did pacify God, not becau&s;e of the Merit of the Act, but becau&s;e of the Worth of the Object, which is the Satisfaction of Chri&s;t's Death it apprehends, and that this doth plea&s;e him, becau&s;e of his good Plea&s;ure and Purpo&s;e of Grace, and becau&s;e he will be &s;o plea&s;ed: (3) That this
<PB N="33" REF="006067_0138_1027518804A6A898">
Satisfaction alone thus apprehended, did perfectly and without any Holine&s;s or Reformation of mine pacify and plea&s;e the Father; or el&s;e I &s;aw, that Chri&s;t's Death and Merits were imperfect and in&s;ufficient. And if &s;o, If this alone pleas'd him, then the Condition of the Go&s;pel was not thus, viz. If you be|lieve in Chri&s;t's Death for Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Pacification and Life, and if you be &s;anctified and obey the Will of Chri&s;t, you &s;hall then live, and God the Father will be pacified toward you by both the&s;e Means, but if you believe in Chri&s;t Je&s;us and his Death, by this <HI>only</HI> you &s;hall plea&s;e God for whatever Sin you have committed. I &s;aw the Con&s;cience of a Sinner could never be quieted until it did re&s;t on this Te&s;ti|mony only, in &s;eeing God plea&s;ed that Moment wherein it flies out of &s;elf to the Death of Chri&s;t&mdash; Now becau&s;e I knew the Lord required Obedience and Sanctification, hence a Third Thing came clearly to mind.&mdash;</P>
<P N="3">3. I &s;aw, that re&s;ting thus on Chri&s;t, my Con&s;cience &s;hould be quieted, that God was now pacified, and that I did now plea&s;e him fully in Point of Satisfaction, yet I &s;aw I was now required to do the whole Will of God, and to conform thereunto, not in Way of Satis|faction, to pacify God's eternal Anger, but in Way of Thankfulne&s;s for this the Lord's Love in being plea&s;ed with me, and that wherein I fell &s;hort of it, I &s;hould be deeply humbled with <HI>Paul, Romans</HI> 7. but where|in I did any Thing according thereto, to be thankful for it, as <HI>Paul</HI> al&s;o was, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7. when he was glad that in his Mind he &s;erved the Law of God&mdash;Now becau&s;e I &s;aw I could do nothing, my Will being de&s;perately aver&s;e from Chri&s;t's Will; Hence I &s;aw (1) If Chri&s;t had pacified the Father and plea&s;ed Divine Ju&s;tice for my Sin, that he would al&s;o by his Death deliver me from my Sins. (2) I &s;aw that Chri&s;t did not require me now ju&s;tified to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in my &s;elf, and to be Self-confi|dent,
<PB N="34" REF="006067_0139_1027513E9AD487C0">
and to do with and from my own Strength, but that he would give me the Law of the Spirit of Life, which would enable me; and that the Obedience he would accept, as a Token of Thankfulne&s;s, was this, (1) That I &s;hould re&s;t and rely upon his Death for the Spirit of Life, and on his Spirit for the Power of it to enable me to do his Will continually. (2) That if the Lord did enable me, I &s;hould be exceeding thank|ful for it, if not, that I &s;hould be exceedingly humbled daily under it, and &s;o &s;till forget Things which be behind, and reach to Things that be before. Relying on Chri&s;t for his Spirit I &s;aw did and doth come and ari&s;e in all the Saints from the Law writ in the Heart, after it feels God pacified, and the Law of God without, which being reconciled together, and the Soul feeling it's own Weakne&s;s to plea&s;e it, hence it relies on the Spi|rit of Chri&s;t Je&s;us and thereby finds Help; the Spirit within us living on the Spirit without us, as the elemen|tary Bodies, on the Elements in other Bodies. So I &s;aw, that by Faith in Chri&s;t's Death I plea&s;ed the provoked Ju&s;tice and pacified the Anger of God; by the Law of God writ in my Heart and Obedience of the Spirit, I was plea&s;ed and did now plea&s;e the Law of God, as now given to me by Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>Now when the Lord did &s;hew me all this, I did ble&s;s him with my Soul for it, and I was taught how to walk more orderly. I &s;aw (1) This was the right Way of Believing and finding Favour, becau&s;e it car|ried the Soul humbly from the Beginning to the End and exalted God's Grace. (2) I &s;aw that hereby the Saints came to mourn more for Sin (which Famili&s;ts do not) than any other Men. For when I &s;ee I mu&s;t die for Sin, that makes me mourn; when I &s;ee how cro&s;s it is to God, that makes me mourn &s;till; when I believe and &s;ee, only Chri&s;t's Death can pacify, and that I being come to it, it &s;hall pacify, this makes me mourn more, and that bitterly, which no gracele&s;s Heart
<PB N="35" REF="006067_0140_1027518DC656B228">
can do, or hath Cau&s;e to do. (3) I &s;aw, that in preaching Duties of Obedience to the Saints, I &s;hould be careful how I &s;et them a Mea&s;ure, or &s;et them to do them either to pacify Anger, or to perform them in their own Strength, or to make Doing of them an Evidence of Grace, without in&s;erting, <HI>Unle&s;s they go to Chri&s;t and rely on him for his Grace,</HI> enabling them thereunto; and to preach them to <HI>them</HI> only as Duties of Thankfulne&s;s; to <HI>others</HI> as Hand-writings of Death. (4) Hereby I &s;aw how Sanctification was an Evidence of Reconciliation. (1) I &s;aw, where it was not, there was no Reconciliation. (2) That where it was, there was Reconciliation. (3) That mediately it was an Evi|dence, and I was to take it as an Evidence of Re|conciliation, <HI>Mediately,</HI> I &s;ay, becau&s;e Faith in Chri&s;t's Blood doth <HI>immediately</HI> a&s;&s;ure me of it. But this, (viz. Sanctification) a&s;&s;ures me that my Faith hath truly apprehended Chri&s;t Je&s;us. 4. I &s;aw that Faith did im|mediately evidence Reconciliation. (1) Becau&s;e Faith is required in the Go&s;pel as the only Condition; Sanc|tification is required to come after it, is wrought after it, and commanded after it. (2) Becau&s;e I &s;aw the Apo&s;tles had their Reconciliation by this Evidence. <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.1. <HI>Being ju&s;tified by Faith, we have Peace with God.</HI> (3) I &s;aw that Sanctification was not to come in to Pacification of God's Anger and Di&s;plea|&s;ure, and therefore not immediately to the Pacification of Con&s;cience. For Con&s;cience being &s;mitten with Sen&s;e of eternal Death, nothing can pacify Con&s;cience, but that which can pacify Ju&s;tice, and that is the Death of Chri&s;t Je&s;us apprehended by Faith. Con&s;ci|ence only hath Quiet in Chri&s;t's Death, my Peace is only in it; but Faith only is that by which I came by it; becau&s;e Faith makes it mine own, brings it near me, and now it quiets me. It is not by an immediate Te&s;timony, that <HI>Chri&s;t's Death is mine:</HI> for that may be a Delu&s;ion, being without the Word;
<PB N="36" REF="006067_0141_1027514025321070">
but Chri&s;t's Death apprehended by me, and &s;o te&s;tified by the Word and Spirit; the Word &s;peaking, Every Believer &s;hall live; the Spirit of Adoption (enabling the Soul to &s;ee the Work of Faith in it&s;elf) &s;peaking, Thou, Believer &s;halt live. Which Spirit is given im|mediately after my Ju&s;tification by Faith, viz. in my Adoption to Son&s;hip.</P>
<P>Now having Peace by Faith, my Con&s;cience will que&s;tion, Is thy Faith right? Now my Sanctification bears witne&s;s to <HI>that</HI> and &s;o <HI>mediately</HI> &s;hews me, that my Peace is right. In a Word,</P>
<P>The Matter of my Peace, or that wherein I have Peace, is Chri&s;t's Death. The Means of this my Peace is Faith only. The <HI>immediate</HI> Evidence of my Peace and Pacification is Faith apprehending Chri&s;t's Death. The Evidences being (1) the Word of the Go&s;pel, (2) the Spirit of Adoption di&s;covering the Work of Faith in the Heart. The Evidence of the Truth of Faith, and &s;o of my Peace is Sanctification. This only I que&s;tion, whether Faith &s;aith, My Peace is made, and Sanctification &s;aith, Thy Faith is good. Only I add, it's po&s;&s;ible for &s;ome &s;incere Chri&s;tians fir&s;t to &s;ee their Sanctification and Holine&s;s, and &s;o their Faith and Peace. But the Que&s;tion is, Whether they &s;hould not fir&s;t &s;ee their Faith and Peace, and &s;o their Sanctification ari&s;ing from thence? And &s;o as Mr. <HI>Culverwell</HI> notes, not build their Faith upon their Life but their life upon their Faith, and their Faith upon God's free Grace.</P>
<P N="5">(5) I &s;aw that the Rea&s;on why Faith in Chri&s;t's Blood, and not &s;imply in Chri&s;t did ju&s;tify and pacify, was becau&s;e an humbled Sinner ever feels and &s;ees <HI>Death</HI> before him; and hence the Lord, according to his Need, opens Chri&s;t and pre&s;ents him <HI>thus</HI> to him. As al&s;o, why <HI>Paul</HI> called Sin a Body of Death. (1) Becau&s;e he &s;aw he mu&s;t die for it; the Remnants of Sin were Death. (2) Becau&s;e they were cro&s;s to the
<PB N="37" REF="006067_0142_102751922BB83320">
Life of Chri&s;t in him. All this was the Day before the Sacrament <HI>July</HI> 10. 1641. And I thought now I felt &s;ome Growth, which I came for in other Sacra|ments.</P>
<P>On the Evening of this Day before the Sacrament, I &s;aw it my Duty to &s;eque&s;ter my &s;elf from all other Things for the Lord the next Day. And (1) I &s;aw, I was to pitch on the right End, (2) on the Means, all Things to lead me to that End. I &s;aw mine own Ends were, to procure Honour, Plea&s;ure, Gain to my &s;elf and not the Lord: and I &s;aw how impo&s;&s;ible it was for me to attain tho&s;e Ends I &s;hould attain, viz. To &s;eek the Lord for him&s;elf, to lay up all my Honour, Plea&s;ure &amp;c. in him. Or if I did, it was for my&s;elf, becau&s;e good unto me. So the Lord helped me thus. To &s;ee,</P>
<P N="1">(1) If Honour, Plea&s;ure was good; Oh, how good was he who gave them, and could have cut me &s;hort of them? And &s;o my Heart was rai&s;ed up a little unto God.</P>
<P N="2">(2) I &s;aw <HI>my Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s</HI> did not chiefly lie in receiv|ing Good and Comfort from God, and in God; but in <HI>holding forth the Glory of God and his Virtues.</HI> For 'tis, I &s;aw, an amazing, glorious Object, to &s;ee God in a Creature; GOD &s;peak, GOD act: The Deity not being the Creature, and turned into it, but filling of it, &s;hining thorow it: To be covered with God, as with a Cloud; or as a Gla&s;s Lantern, to have his Beams penetrate thorow it. Nothing is good but God; and I am no further good, than as I hold forth God. The Devil overcame <HI>Eve</HI> to damn her Self by telling her, &s;he &s;hould be like God. O that's a glorious Thing! And &s;hould not I be holy, and &s;o be like him indeed?</P>
<P>Hereupon I found my Heart more &s;weetly drawn to clo&s;e with God, thus as my End, and to place my Happine&s;s in it: And al&s;o I &s;aw, it was my Mi&s;ery to
<PB N="38" REF="006067_0143_10275141F5E7E188">
hold forth Sin and Satan and Self in my Cour&s;e: And I &s;aw one of tho&s;e two Things I mu&s;t do. Now be|cau&s;e my Soul wanted Plea&s;ure, I purpo&s;ed thus to hold forth God, and did hope it &s;hould be my Plea|&s;ure &s;o to do, as it would be my Pain to do other|wi&s;e.</P>
<P>I al&s;o con&s;idered of the <HI>Nature of a Sacrament;</HI> and I thought <HI>if Chri&s;t was here pre&s;ent to prepare and ble&s;s the Ordinance, I &s;hould believe.</HI> But I &s;aw (1) Should I not believe, Chri&s;t did give me Meat, un|le&s;s every Day he did lay the Cloath? (2) I &s;aw, Should not I believe the Word by Mini&s;ters, becau&s;e Chri&s;t doth not &s;peak it with his own Mouth? (3) I &s;aw, Chri&s;t did command his Mini&s;ters to do this in Remembrance of him; and if for Chri&s;t's Sake that he might be remembred and loved they do ble&s;s it, then he is faithful to make his Body and Blood pre&s;ent there, and &s;o to make the Elements, <HI>Seals.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;aw al&s;o that the Elements were not only Seals to a&s;&s;ure me that Chri&s;t's Word &s;hould be made good to me believing; but al&s;o that Chri&s;t by &s;acramental Union was given to me. I &s;aw al&s;o, that my Heart did &s;ay and conclude, I &s;hall fall from Chri&s;t after this Sacrament, and have no more Strength again&s;t my Sins or Weakne&s;&s;es than heretofore, nor Ability to live to him. Then I &s;aw that the Sacrament was a <HI>Pledge</HI> that certainly I &s;hould have Strength; and al&s;o that this that I &s;hould have was a mo&s;t &s;weet Thing, viz. <HI>The Life of Chri&s;t now begun and perfected here|after.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;aw al&s;o that the Sacrament was made to confirm <HI>this main Promi&s;e of the Covenant,</HI> That he will give him&s;elf away to all that will but only take him thank|fully and gladly. And I &s;aw, that it was my Duty every Sacrament to fa&s;ten that Promi&s;e and repeat it again, that &s;o it might be of Power and U&s;e to God's People in due Time.</P>

<P>As I was riding to the Sermon that Day, my Heart began to be much di&s;quieted by &s;eeing almo&s;t all Men's Souls and E&s;tates out of Order, and many Evils in Mens Hearts, Lives, Cour&s;es.

<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 1. On <HI>Sabbath-Day</HI> when the Lord had gi|ven me &s;ome comfortable Enlargements, I &s;earcht my Heart to &s;ee my Sin. And I &s;aw,</P>
<P N="1">1. There was &s;ome poor little Eye in Seeking <HI>the Name and Glory of Chri&s;t:</HI> But I &s;aw it was but little, and that there was not &s;uch a burning De&s;ire to ad|vance it, as there &s;hould be. And hence I &s;aw, I was to be humbled for this.</P>
<P N="2">2. I &s;aw, that though I did &s;eek Chri&s;t's Glory, yet I &s;ought it not only, but <HI>my own Glory</HI> too. And hereupon thinking, whether a Man might not have &s;ome Re&s;pect to his own Glory; The Lord taught me, that in meerly humane Acts, I might have &s;ome Re&s;pect unto it; but in the Mini&s;try and that kind of Work, and &s;o in all Work whereby I draw nigh unto him, this was &s;uch Work above me, and &s;o wholly di|vine and God's Work, that I &s;hould here have no Re|&s;pect to my &s;elf together with God. For I &s;aw, God might have left me on the Dunghill, and not have betru&s;ted me with only &s;uch Work as this is.

<HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 2. In Prayer my Heart was very de&s;irous of having the <HI>Generation to come</HI> know, love and fear the Lord; and my Heart was hereupon much enlarg|ed to &s;et upon <HI>Catechi&s;ing.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;aw al&s;o what a &s;weet Thing it was, not only to have <HI>Sinners converted,</HI> but to have the <HI>Saints edified,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t's Work go forward in them;</HI> that if it did &s;o, all Things would pro&s;per, even outward Things; whereas el&s;e I did fear all our Woes are yet behind.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 13. I &s;aw [1] that I was <HI>worthy to be left to my &s;elf</HI> and in my Mi&s;ery and Sin, (1) Not only be|cau&s;e I had &s;inned; but (2) Becau&s;e of my very De|&s;ires to come out of it. For I &s;aw they did ari&s;e from Pride; that when I &s;aw how God did not pro&s;per me nor any that did come under my Shadow; and that he left me in the Dark, and hid his Face and Secrets from me; then, when God had ca&s;t me down, I would take hold on the Lord and &s;eek to climb up on him, that he might exalt me, and that I might be exalted by being lifted up by him. Whereas I &s;aw it was my Duty, when I was low (1) To be afflicted and mourn, and learn the Bitterne&s;s of Sin, and my own Unworthi|ne&s;s. <HI>James</HI> 4. (2) To be de&s;irous to come out only in Regard of the Lord, that he may be exalted in me and by me. And I did think the Lord &s;et my Heart in &s;uch a Frame at that Time.

<P N="2">[2] I &s;aw <HI>my Heart very ready to neglect Prayer</HI> for two Cau&s;es; (1) From thinking, that I had prayed enough, when I had prayed earne&s;tly and had no more Argu|ments to u&s;e.

<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 15. I &s;aw on the <HI>Sabbath</HI> four Evils that at|tend me in my Mini&s;try.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Devil either treads me down by <HI>Di&s;courage|ment and Shame:</HI> (1) from the Sen&s;e of the Mean|ne&s;s of what I have provided in private Meditations; and to this I &s;aw al&s;o an An&s;wer, viz. That every Thing &s;anctified to do Good, it's Glory is not &s;een in it's &s;elf, but in the Lord's &s;anctifying of it. Or (2) from an Apprehen&s;ion of the Un&s;avorine&s;s of Men's Spirits, and their Unreadine&s;s to hear in hot or cold Sea&s;ons. But here I &s;aw, I ought not to be as a Reed &s;haken with the Wind.</P>
<P N="2">2. Or <HI>Carele&s;&s;ne&s;s</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth me: ari&s;ing (1) Be|cau&s;e I have done well and been enlarged, and have been re&s;pected formerly, and hence 'tis no &s;uch Matter though I be not always alike. (2) A natural Dulne&s;s and Cloudine&s;s of Spirit which doth often prevail.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Infirmities and Weakne&s;s:</HI> (1) Want of Light, (2) Want of Life, (3) Want of a Spirit of Power to deliver what I am affected with for Chri&s;t. And hence I &s;aw many Souls not &s;et forward, nor God <HI>felt</HI> in my Mini&s;try.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Want of Succe&s;s</HI> when I have done my be&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;aw the&s;e and that I was to be humbled for the&s;e, I &s;aw al&s;o many other Sins, and how the Lord might be angry. And this Day, in mu&s;ing thus I &s;aw, that when I &s;aw God angry, I &s;ought to pacify him by ab|&s;taining from all Sin for Time to come: But then I remembred (1) That my Righteou&s;ne&s;s could not &s;a|tisfie, and that this was re&s;ting on my own Righteou&s;|ne&s;s: (2) I &s;aw I could not do it. (3) I &s;aw, Only Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s ready made and already fini&s;hed, fit for that Purpo&s;e&mdash;And I &s;aw that God's afflicting me for my Sin was, not that I &s;hould go and &s;atisfie by Reforming, but only that I might be humbled and
<PB N="43" REF="006067_0148_1027519C0B028EC8">
afflicted for and &s;eparated from Sin, being reconciled and made righteous by Faith on Chri&s;t, which I &s;aw a little of that Night.</P>
<P>This Day al&s;o I found <HI>my Heart very untoward and &s;ad, and heavy by mu&s;ing on many Evils to come.</HI> But I &s;aw if I carried four Things in my Mind alway, I &s;hould be comforted.</P>
<P N="1">1. That in my &s;elf I am a dying condemned Wretch; but by Chri&s;t I am reconciled and live.</P>
<P N="2">2. In my &s;elf, and all Creatures, finding In&s;ufficiency and no Re&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. Feeble and unable to do any Thing my &s;elf; but in Chri&s;t able to be efficient and to do all Things.</P>
<P N="4">4. Though I enjoyed all the&s;e but in Part in this World; yet I &s;hould have them all perfectly, &s;hortly in Heaven; where God will &s;hew him&s;elf fully recon|ciled, be alone &s;ufficient and efficient and aboli&s;h all Sin, and live in me perfectly.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 17. I &s;aw <HI>my Neglect of my &s;elf, Family and others.</HI> And I &s;aw the Rea&s;on of it was, becau&s;e the Lord did me Good without <HI>Prayer</HI> and ble&s;s'd all Things to me without it. Hence I &s;aw how ju&s;t and righteous it was for the Lord to take every outward ordinary Ble&s;&s;ing from me, becau&s;e I might then be obliged to get them and keep them by Prayer; And that the Lord &s;hould continually exerci&s;e me with great Affliction, that I might hereby pray. And I &s;aw that it was Wi&s;dom for me to pray for all I had, as all Things were taken from me; and to pray for them out of Duty, willingly and not of Nece&s;&s;ity to bring God's Purpo&s;es to pa&s;s by Prayer.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 21. On <HI>Saturday</HI> at Even I was praying, and the Lord made him&s;elf very precious to me, becau&s;e I might come to him, have <HI>Acce&s;s in Prayer</HI> (1) At any Time, (2) might lay open all my Wants with Plea|&s;ing to him, (3) with Certainty of &s;peeding. And when I &s;aw that my great Sin did lie in not keeping
<PB N="44" REF="006067_0149_102751D96FC9FA70">
the Savour (at lea&s;t) of the Lord and his Ways, I did thereupon &s;ee, (1) that the Remembrance of this Truth would be one Means to maintain it, as it gave it; (2) I &s;aw there is no Wrath like this to be go|verned by my own Lu&s;ts for my own Ends.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 24. I &s;aw [1] that the Means of being im|moveable was Sen&s;e of God's Sufficiency and Efficiency by Faith. [2] I &s;aw that I was not made immove|able by re&s;ting on my Faith, and the Re&s;t of Faith which &s;ometimes I felt; but by re&s;ting on God as only able to &s;upport my Faith, and me by it. [3] I &s;aw how exceeding &s;hort I fell of that Holine&s;s God re|quires. And hence I &s;aw the Rea&s;on why Men &s;eek after no more Holine&s;s, nor are more holy, is (1) be|cau&s;e they think, they are holy as God would have them, and as other Chri&s;tians be: They &s;et up their Pitch: Or (2) becau&s;e of their Impotency and Weak|ne&s;s, and they could do no more than they did. [4] I &s;aw there is great Matter of Humbling, that I am not &s;o holy as I <HI>&s;hould</HI> be; but am infinitely &s;hort; but much more, that I am not &s;o holy as I <HI>might</HI> be through Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 28, 29. <HI>When I came from Preaching,</HI> I &s;aw <HI>my own Weakne&s;s</HI> (1) of Body to &s;peak (2) of Light and Affection within, and Enlargement there; and that my weak Mind, Heart and Tongue moved with|out GOD's &s;pecial Help. (3) I &s;aw my Weakne&s;s to ble&s;s what I did. Hereupon I que&s;tioned, whether the Lord would ever ble&s;s one &s;o impotent, that did my Work without his Power, and &s;inned &s;o much with &s;uch dead, heartle&s;s, blind Work: And I feared he would not. But then I con&s;idered (1) That God doth &s;hew his Power by the <HI>Much-ado</HI> of our Weakne&s;s to do any Thing. God works not by &s;trong, but <HI>weak Things.</HI> 1 Cor. 1.21. He makes <HI>fooli&s;h Things</HI> and <HI>weak Things</HI> and <HI>Things that are not,</HI> to do his Work; <HI>that no Fle&s;h might glory.</HI> (2) I &s;aw that if he did &s;o,
<PB N="45" REF="006067_0150_1027519D943391E0">
then the more weak I was, the more fit was I to be u&s;ed; and that he could ble&s;s his own Ordinance by me. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.9. His Power pitcheth his Tents in Weakne&s;s. (3) I &s;aw that the Lord (as weak as I am) had ble&s;&s;ed my poor Labours; and if he &s;hould do it &s;till, Oh how &s;hould I give the Glory to him! So my Heart was much affected and did give the Glory of all was ever done by me to God. And I thought I did now begin to do, what I &s;hould do for ever in Heaven. And I &s;eeing that by this Way God &s;hould be glorified, I began to <HI>rejoice,</HI> with <HI>Paul,</HI> in <HI>my In|firmities,</HI> and my Heart began to be rai&s;ed up from &s;inking under them: Becau&s;e I thought I was bound to rejoice in God, that by my Weakne&s;s he would glorify him&s;elf. And I began to &s;ee how good it was to acknowledge and not be a&s;hamed of my Weakne&s;&s;es before others, that they might &s;ee the more clearly the Glory of God: Nor to be di&s;couraged with them before, nor after my Work.</P>
<P>Yet here was left one Scruple, How that the Apo|&s;tle's were filled with the Spirit of Power and Strength in their Work, and &s;o God ble&s;s'd as 1 The&s;&s;. 1.4? I thought the Apo&s;tle's were weak <HI>before</HI> their Work; but were they &s;o <HI>in</HI> their Work? Did the Lord by weak Work in and upon them do any Good? So I mourned. For a little before this Time, I ob&s;erved, <HI>Weakne&s;s to do Chri&s;t's Work, and Shame ever went to|gether;</HI> and that Weakne&s;s of Body, and Neglect of Duty went together.</P>
<P>So I prayed that Evening immediately, that the Lord would accept me in Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and make me &s;trong and zealous for him and his Name; nay, that Chri&s;t him&s;elf would be zealous to get him|&s;elf a Name by me, who was but a worthle&s;s In&s;tru|ment in his Hand; and &s;o I re&s;ted with &s;ome Hope, that he would. And re&s;olved to walk in Sen&s;e of my Weakne&s;s and Vilene&s;s daily before him.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="006067_0151_102751DB3549FBA8">
<HI>September</HI> 5. I was on <HI>Sabbath-Day Night</HI> &s;ecretly <HI>&s;welling again&s;t God, that he did not ble&s;s my Mini&s;try.</HI> But then, remembring my Sins, how I de&s;erved Death eternally, I was &s;oon quieted; and I ble&s;&s;ed God ex|ceedingly for my Life, and that the Lord was not yet gone out of Hearing, but that I might come to him privately, and in extraordinary Duties and pray. So I prayed earne&s;tly for Favour and Love of Chri&s;t and God in Chri&s;t, and for a Multitude of Mercies. And I prayed &s;o long, until my Heart was made &s;uitable unto Mercy; &s;o as I prized nothing el&s;e, but God's Favour, &s;o as my Heart did find Re&s;t there, and was quiet with it; which gave me &s;ome &s;weet Peace. And I began to believe, Mercy was mine, becau&s;e my Heart was confined to it, and filled with it, and did re&s;t on it, and with it. For I con&s;i|dered, the Heart of all ungodly Men is ravi&s;hed and runs out to Creatures and finds Re&s;t there only. And &s;o I fell to ble&s;&s;ing God and praying for the Fruits of God's reconciled Love; and among other Things to ble&s;s my Mini&s;try. And in doing this a De&s;ire came in, viz. That the Lord would not ble&s;s <HI>my</HI> Words, but <HI>his own</HI> Word, becau&s;e 'tis his own. Becau&s;e I am &s;ure he will ble&s;s his own Children and make them Ble&s;&s;ings; &s;o I was &s;ure the Lord would ble&s;s his own Word, becau&s;e it is his own.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 5. I &s;aw in Prayer, that there was none almo&s;t that did make Con&s;cience to grow nearer to God one Day than another Day; but left that to God, without much Care.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 8. I &s;aw the Rea&s;on why I did walk no more humbly and holily was, becau&s;e <HI>I did make the Creature &s;omething, and did not make God all Things.</HI> God is all; He that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth him, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth &s;omething, yea all Things. So long as the Creature is &s;omething, that &s;omething will &s;tand betwixt God and me, that I &s;hall not walk only in his Sight. This therefore is manify|ing

of God, to make him <HI>All,</HI> the Fountain of all Goodne&s;s and Excellency!</P>
<P>I &s;aw in my Sleep that Night, that a Chri&s;tian was to act not only from a natural Power of Grace, which doth act with all its Might where it is; but by a Power &s;upernatural, whereby he attempts Things above his own Might, and bears Evils above his Might. So that now I &s;ee a Chri&s;tian &s;hould act for Chri&s;t with all his Might and beyond his Might, having the &s;u|pernatural Power of Chri&s;t to help him thereunto.</P>

<P>I &s;aw on the <HI>Fa&s;t-Day</HI> al&s;o, that (1) every Way I looked, there was Matter of Sorrow, in me, about me, Sin again&s;t God in Heaven, nay again&s;t Chri&s;t, nay cro&s;s to his Will, his Love, nay his Life: Hence I &s;hould mourn. (2) I &s;aw I had no Comforter to go to, when I had thus &s;inned again&s;t the Lord, no Crea|ture.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 13. In my Meditations at Night, I found <HI>my Heart de&s;irous to live in this World and do Good here, and not to die.</HI> Hence I a&s;ked my Heart the Rea&s;on why I &s;hould not be de&s;irous to die? And in mu&s;ing on it I &s;aw that Chri&s;t was a&s;cended up to <HI>Heaven;</HI> that &s;o not <HI>here,</HI> but <HI>there</HI> all his Elect might one Day be|hold his Glory and love him and glorify him for ever. And I &s;aw that this was God's main Plot and the End of all, to make Chri&s;t very glorious, and &s;o beloved in Heaven for ever, where that which I de&s;ired mo&s;t in this World (<HI>viz.</HI> that Chri&s;t might not only be pre|cious, but very dear and precious) &s;hould be perfectly accompli&s;hed: and hereupon I &s;ecretly de&s;ired this Mercy and de&s;ired it for my Child and Brethren and all the Churches; That, though we were blind here, and knew him not, loved him little, yet that this might

Then I enquired, <HI>what is the great Thing I &s;hould de&s;ire in this World?</HI> And I &s;aw it was the Be|ginning of that which &s;hould be perfected in Heaven; viz. (1) To &s;ee and know CHRIST, though ob&s;curely. (2) To take Chri&s;t and receive him, and po&s;&s;e&s;s him. (3) To love him. (4) To ble&s;s him in my Heart, with my Mouth, by my Life. And in this la&s;t Clau&s;e I &s;aw, that I &s;hould &s;tudy and &s;tand for <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> and <HI>all the Ways of Wor&s;hip</HI> out of <HI>Love</HI> to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> viz.

<P>Now I &s;aw that Night (1) That all Sin was in me, and all Shame did belong to me. (2) I &s;aw all Good in Chri&s;t, and all Glory belonging to him. Here|upon I was comforted, and hoped the Lord had &s;hewed me his Glory. And I &s;aw an Error in my Heart; for I thought that then Chri&s;t appears in his Glory, when he affects the Heart with Wonderment at his Per&s;on by &s;ome &s;trange Light, and &s;o filled the Soul with glorious Activities of Grace: Whenas I &s;aw, that was the true&s;t &s;weete&s;t Revelation of Chri&s;t's Glory, which did eclip&s;e all my Glory, and laid a

And &s;eeing the Glory of this Mercy, the Lord &s;tirred up my Heart to de&s;ire the Ble&s;&s;ing and Pre&s;ence of his <HI>Ordinances</HI> in this Place, and the Continuance of his poor <HI>Churches</HI> among us, looking on them as Means to pre&s;erve and propagate the Go&s;pel.

Hereupon I &s;aw <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> near me, next unto me, becau&s;e he comes in as <HI>Mediator</HI> between <HI>God</HI> and my Soul.

Chri&s;t between God and me that were di&s;tant, the Word between Chri&s;t and me, and Faith clo&s;ing with the Word, between the Word and me: the Word on Chri&s;t's Part, Faith on our Part. <HI>The Word is nigh thee, Rom.</HI> 10. which is the Word of Faith. And hence oppo&s;e the Word, and you oppo&s;e the Lord where he is, and wherein he is mo&s;t near. Hence receive the Word and you receive the Lord, wherein he is mo&s;t near.</P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 10. When I &s;aw <HI>the Gifts and the Honour at|tending them in another,</HI> viz. T.

And &s;o the Lord made me thankful in &s;eeing it, and put me in Mind to watch again&s;t it.</P>

give away all to pay our Debts. Hereupon the <HI>Lord</HI> &s;et me upon prizing of <HI>his Love,</HI> and the Lord made my Heart content with it: (1) His Love, though he denied me all Ble&s;&s;ings, (2) Hence I de&s;ired to know it, (3) To con&s;train my Heart by it (4) That I might not abu&s;e but Honour it. And there I left my &s;elf, and beg'd this Portion for my &s;elf, and for my Child, and for the Church; and &s;o left them in the Lord's Bowels.&mdash;Now &s;uch was the Goodne&s;s of Chri&s;t, that when I came to hear <HI>my Father</HI> preach at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> the <HI>Day after,</HI> my Soul was &s;ettled on the &s;ame Way again, when he preached about Contentedne&s;s: And &s;o I was confirmed in the Faith: and &s;o I learned how a Chri&s;tian is confirmed, (1) When he hears the &s;ame Thing preached at one Time, or by one Man, confirmed again by another Man, or at another Time; (2) When he learns &s;omething privately, and then he hears the &s;ame again publickly.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 9. On <HI>Saturday Morning,</HI> I was <HI>much affected for my Life;</HI> that I might live &s;till to &s;eek, that &s;o I might &s;ee God, and make known God before my Death. And then I &s;aw, If there was &s;uch Thank|fulne&s;s for Deliverance from <HI>Mi&s;ery,</HI> would it not be a greater Mercy to be delivered and redeemed from Sin? And I &s;aw that this was a greater Mercy. And hence I &s;aw the Love of Chri&s;t in afflicting and trying me with Wants; becau&s;e by the&s;e Trials I came to &s;ee <HI>my Sin</HI> and to have a Heart &s;evered from my Sin. And &s;o I &s;aw, there was no Anger, but Love, nay the greate&s;t Love in this, viz. his redeeming Love from my Sin. Hereupon I learnt three Things; (1) That Soul which felt Sin the greate&s;t Evil, he would be willing, nay glad, if the Lord would redeem him out of it, though by any Mi&s;ery, Wants, Sorrows, Temp|tations; (2) When he was delivered, he would be as much thankful as for redeeming him from Hell: (3) He would account this the highe&s;t Te&s;timony of God's
<PB N="52" REF="006067_0157_102751E8215399D8">
Love, by redeeming him out of the greate&s;t Woe. And hence they that take Sanctification as no Sign of Ju&s;|tification, never truly felt the Evil of Sin.&mdash;While I was thus mu&s;ing in Prayer, I &s;aw, that then my Soul was &s;evered from Sin, indeed, when CHRIST JESUS came to be in my Soul in the Room of <HI>my Sin;</HI> when he was dear as Sin had been dear; when he did rule as Sin had once ruled me. And I thought this was &s;weet, if God would do &s;o; and rea&s;onable al&s;o, that it &s;hould be &s;o; and I began to make the Lord &s;o indeed unto me. And &s;o I learnt <HI>this Rule,</HI> viz, <HI>That if ever I would have any Sin &s;ubdued, do not labour to get the Sin &s;ubdued only; but get Chri&s;t to come in the Room of it;</HI> that his Sweetne&s;s may be there, Power there, Life there, and to &s;eek then for the contrary Grace from Chri&s;t. For (1) It may be long before Chri&s;t will come and give the Grace, and &s;o the Soul may lie mi&s;erable; but Chri&s;t my be then had. (2) At Vocation Chri&s;t is given fir&s;t, and then Sanctification. So in the renewed Conver&s;ions of the Saints, 'tis to be &s;o again. (3) El&s;e I &s;eek for Chri&s;t's Virtues without Chri&s;t:&mdash;And cur&s;ed be that Soul that is loth to have Chri&s;t to be in the Room of a ba&s;e Lu&s;t, to make Chri&s;t that to him which a vile Lu&s;t once was.</P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 16. The Day before the Sacrament, the Lord helped me to call to mind (1) <HI>my Neglects,</HI> (2) <HI>My Wants.</HI> [1] <HI>My Neglects;</HI> (1) Of Du|ties in private toward my &s;elf (2) To my Wife, Child, Family, Church, Companions abroad; not in&s;tructing, exhorting, quickning, being an Exam|ple to them. And the Lord let me &s;ee the Cau&s;e of all this to be (1) Ignorance; I know not how to &s;peak to them, nor about what. (2) Un&s;avorine&s;s; not delighting in, but loathing &s;uch Ways. (3) Pride; Becau&s;e I could not do &s;o well as I would, I would not &s;peak what I could. (4) Lukewarmne&s;s; in
<PB N="53" REF="006067_0158_102751AACBF86078">
not being carried out for God's Glory. (5) Idlene&s;s and Sluggi&s;hne&s;s, loth to &s;tir. (6) Love of Study. (7) Want of tender Love. (8) Apprehen&s;ion of Unfruit|fulne&s;s; in Ca&s;e I &s;hould attempt, I &s;hould do no Good, and hence would not &s;ow Seed upon Rocks. And I thought, If this latter &s;hould hinder me, why &s;hould it not di&s;courage the Lord him&s;elf, who had &s;o oft ca&s;t his precious Seed upon my Rocks, and lo&s;t all? And here I &s;aw, I was ignorant when to &s;peak and how to do, and how much; Yet I &s;aw this, that &s;up|po&s;e I had done right, yet that the&s;e Principles cau&s;ing this Neglect were to be lamented, and not indulged, for which End I came to the Lord in the Sacrament. For I &s;aw that good Duties might be done, and &s;ome|times lawfully omitted, and yet both out of <HI>ill Principles.</HI> And when the ill Principles are healed, I &s;hall then &s;ee whether it is my Duty, and how far my Duty reacheth. And this I &s;aw was <HI>a Rule of &s;ingular U&s;e</HI> to know when the Thing was evil, which I think is right and good. I &s;ay it is lawful; Be it &s;o; but &s;ee if this lawful Thing comes not from an ill Principle. Cure that, and then other Things will follow. So a Man &s;trives for upper Place, and who &s;hall be the greate&s;t: A Man thinks U&s;ury is lawful: Now, &s;ay I, mind <HI>the Principle</HI> whence the&s;e come.</P>
<P N="2">[2] I &s;aw <HI>my Wants.</HI> (1) I did want Knowledge of the Truth and Glory of God's Will in the Scrip|tures (2) Wi&s;dom to guide others (3) Daily Repen|tance: The Want of which made the Lord not to pity me, nor to come to me. (4) I was exerci&s;ed with Horrors and Fears, being in the Dark, and the Lord hid|ing his Face. (5) Want of a Spirit of Prayer di&s;tre&s;s'd me; having Words without Affection, which I &s;aw the Perfection of all Mi&s;ery.&mdash;(6) Want of Zeal for God's Glory; but affecting mine own Glory and mine own Excellency, nay the Excellencies of God for that End.

<P>I meditated this Night upon CHRIST, and &s;aw (1) That there was a nece&s;&s;ity of a <HI>Mediator</HI> in Regard of God's Truth and Holine&s;s. (2) That this was the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> by the Witne&s;&s;es given of him. (3) I &s;aw not that he was mine, becau&s;e I &s;aw no Promi&s;e ab&s;olute of it. But the Lord graciou&s;ly cleared up to me <HI>John</HI> 1.12. That they who receive Chri&s;t were Sons. (Chri&s;t him&s;elf, though they had no Promi&s;e.) Now to receive Chri&s;t I &s;aw was contrary to them that did not own him when he came to his own. (1) They did not acknowledge, <HI>This is he.</HI> (2) They did not &s;ee any Glory in him. (3) They did not embrace him with all their Hearts to be that to them for which End he came; viz. To be King, Prophet and Prie&s;t. So I &s;aw what it was to receive him. And upon a fre&s;h Per&s;wa&s;ion that this Me&s;&s;iah is he, the Lord gave me to embrace me him with my Affections, as if pre&s;ent; viz. To guide me as a Prophet, to rule me as a King, to take away Sin and Death as a Prie&s;t.&mdash;Now here I &s;aw two Things, [1] That <HI>true Faith</HI> was not to guide one's Self, rule and conquer Sin, and obey one's Self; (for this is to make our &s;elves our own Saviours;) But to cleave to Chri&s;t that will do all this, nay that he would draw out our Faith of embracing him for this. And hence I &s;aw <HI>Neglect of Duty</HI> as vile a Sin as <HI>actual Sin;</HI> becau&s;e Chri&s;t is not &s;o much offended with us for actual Sin, as for not coming to him and cla&s;ping about him to take the&s;e away. The one, viz. to do the thing is his Work; but to cleave to him is our chief Work.&mdash;And I was confirmed, that this is the right Act of Faith; (1) Becau&s;e Faith is a bare Re|ceiver; (2) From <HI>John</HI> 4.10. If thou would&s;t a&s;k, he would give. [2] I &s;aw Faith weak and divided, and many Sins would be &s;till in me; that with this Faith there was a Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>daily Repentance.</HI> This
<PB N="55" REF="006067_0160_102751B06414EC58">
Repentance, I &s;aw, con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in mourning for the Sin which Chri&s;t by Faith had not yet removed. Now I &s;aw I was to mourn; (1) For not going to Chri&s;t to take away my Sin, which I daily forget; (2) For the Evil of my Sin, (and it's Cro&s;&s;ne&s;s to him) which he takes not away; (3) For his not taking it away, that I give him Cau&s;e to leave me; &s;o (4) As having crucified him. And here I &s;aw I had no Rea&s;on to continue in Sin; (1) Becau&s;e it had wounded Chri&s;t; (2) Becau&s;e Chri&s;t died that it might die and not live. And thus my Soul was &s;weetly &s;tayed upon Chri&s;t by Faith this Day, and much comforted.&mdash;Yet I &s;aw there might be a <HI>Deceit</HI> in <HI>one Thing,</HI> viz. in Rea&s;oning and bringing my Heart to do a Duty by the Power of that; (1) To believe a Truth, not only by Means of Rea&s;on, but only upon that Ground, becau&s;e it agrees to right Rea&s;on: as that Chri&s;t mu&s;t &s;uffer, becau&s;e el&s;e God mu&s;t be fal&s;e and his Word not true; (2) To do a Duty from the Per&s;wa&s;ion of Rea&s;on, becau&s;e it plea&s;eth me, not becau&s;e it plea&s;eth the LORD.</P>
<P>And here I &s;aw, if it was from <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> the Power of Rea&s;on would never carry me again&s;t my own Will and my own Ends.</P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 18. On <HI>Monday Morning, my Child was born.</HI> And when my Wife was in Travail, the Lord made me pray that &s;he might be delivered, and the Child given in Mercy, having had &s;ome Sen&s;e of Mercy the Day before at the Sacrament; and the Lord &s;tayed my Heart there. But I began to think, What if it &s;hould not be &s;o, and her Pains be long, and the Lord remember my Sin? and I began to imagine and trouble my Heart with Fear of the wor&s;t. And I un|der&s;tood at that Time, that my Child had been born, and my Wife delivered in Mercy already. Hereupon I &s;aw the Lord's Mercy and my own Folly, to di&s;|quiet my Heart with Fear of what never &s;hall be, nor will be; and not rather to &s;ubmit to the Lord's Will;
<PB N="56" REF="006067_0161_102751F238260218">
and come what can come, to be quiet there. When it was born, I was much affected, and my Heart clave to the Lord who gave it. And Thoughts came in, that this was the Beginning of more Mercy for Time to come. But I que&s;tioned, Will the Lord provide for it? And I &s;aw that the Lord had made Man to great Glory, to prai&s;e him, and hence would take Care of him. Though &s;ometimes the Lord &s;eemed to make all Men for nought, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 89. Which Place I thus under&s;tood: God hath made Man for the Glory of him&s;elf, and hence to great Glory; (though he made many for Nought) e&s;pecially the <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>their Po&s;terity</HI> did the Lord make for Glory: And if God did not glorify them, then he &s;eemed indeed to make all Men for Nought; and that when Men are not In|&s;truments of his Glory, 'tis for Nought.&mdash;And I &s;aw God had Ble&s;&s;ings for all my Children; and hence I turned them over to God.</P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 29. I was <HI>much troubled about the Poverty of the Churches;</HI> and I &s;aw it was &s;uch a Mi&s;ery as I could not well di&s;cern the Cau&s;e of, nor &s;ee any Way out: Yet I &s;aw we might find out the Cau&s;e of any Evil by the Lord's Stroke. Now he &s;truck us in out|ward Ble&s;&s;ings, and hence 'tis a Sign there was our Evil; (1) In not acknowledging all we have from God, <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 2.8. (2) In not &s;erving God in the having of them, (3) In making our&s;elves &s;ecure and hard|hearted: For lawful Ble&s;&s;ings are the &s;ecret Idols, and do mo&s;t Hurt: And 'tis then a Sign our greate&s;t Hunt lies in Having, and that the greate&s;t Good lies in God's taking them away from us. Whereupon I con&s;idering this, did &s;weetly content my &s;elf that the Lord &s;hould take all from us, if it might be not in Wrath, but in Love, viz. hereby to glorify him&s;elf the more, and to take away the Fuel of our Sin. I &s;aw that if God's People could be joyfully content to part with all to the Lord, prizing the Gain of a little Holine&s;s

<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 31. On <HI>Sabbath-Day</HI> after Sermon, on my Bed, I &s;aw (1) that my own weak Spirit would not carry me along in my Work. (2) I &s;eeing I wanted Light and Life and Affection, and that I was not a burning and &s;hining Light; I &s;aw this came from the Want of the Spirit of Light and Life. And &s;o I &s;aw I was &s;en&s;ual, wanting the Spirit. Hereupon I did que&s;tion whether the Lord would accept of &s;uch Services. For I read not in Scripture of any Mini&s;ter, but it was better with him: He was filled with Light, Af|fection, Per&s;wa&s;ion, &amp;c.&mdash;I con&s;idered hereupon this; [1] The Lord might reject my Services, if they were as good as I could wi&s;h; and [2] if therefore he ac|cepted the&s;e of mine, (1) I &s;hould magnifie his Grace the more, (2) There would be the more Grace &s;hewn. But I had &s;ome Que&s;tionings, that the Lord would not honour his Grace on any &s;o vile, but that he would make the Offering more plea&s;ant to him fri&s;t. And I &s;aw, if I had never &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions, yet if I had not Light and Life within whence they came, (1) It was a Sign the Spirit of Chri&s;t was far from me, (2) Far, hereupon, from God's People; which began to afflict my Heart. And hereupon I thought to lie down in Sen&s;e of my Vilene&s;s, and condemn my &s;elf and others for &s;uch Hypocri&s;y, and wait for the Spirit, the Comforter which God is able to give &amp;c.</P>
<P>Only I con&s;idered, that Sincerity of a Duty lies as much in Mortification, &s;eeing the Evil of it, as Vivifi|cation, doing it with Life.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 3. On a <HI>Fa&s;t-Day</HI> at Night, in <HI>Preparation for the Duty,</HI> the Lord made me &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e Sins in the Churches; (1) Ignorance of them&s;elves, becau&s;e of &s;ecret Evils; (2) Ignorance of God, becau&s;e mo&s;t Men were full of dark and doubtful Con&s;ciences; (3) Not cleaving to Chri&s;t dearly, only; (4) Neglect of

Duties, becau&s;e of our Place of Security; (5) Standing again&s;t all Means, becau&s;e we grow not better; (6) Earthline&s;s, becau&s;e we long not to be with Chri&s;t. And I &s;aw Sin as my greate&s;t Evil; ***** I was vile, but God was good only, whom my Sins did cro&s;s. And I &s;aw what Cau&s;e I had to loath my &s;elf, and not to &s;eek Honour to my &s;elf. Will any de&s;ire his Dung|hill to be commended? Will he be grieved if it be not? So my Heart began to fall off from &s;eeking Ho|nour.&mdash;The Lord al&s;o gave me &s;ome Glimp&s;e of my &s;elf: and a good Day and Time it was to me.</P>
<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 4. On the End of the Fa&s;t I (1) went to God, and re&s;ted on him as <HI>&s;ufficient;</HI> (2) waited on him as <HI>efficient,</HI> and &s;aid, <Q>Now, Lord, do for thy Churches, and help in Mercy.</Q></P>
<P>In the Beginning of this Day I began to con&s;ider, whether all the Country did not fare the wor&s;e for my Sins; and I &s;aw it was &s;o.

The <HI>An&s;wer</HI> would be, They that think their Sins &s;o &s;mall, as that God is not angry with them at all.</P>

<PB N="59" REF="006067_0164_102751B4CEAE8F68">
Strength and Power of external Nece&s;&s;ity; the Work mu&s;t be done, and hence I went upon this; (3) The Strength of external Encouragement; as Acceptance with others, and Favour from others; (4) The Strength of &s;piritual Affection &s;ome time, and received Grace; and hence I have &s;ought for it: (5) The Strength of Faith if &s;elf, or re&s;ting to my Hold of Chri&s;t, rather than on his Hold of me. And here I &s;aw three Things; (1) That if I did thus, God would cur&s;e me, becau&s;e now I made Fle&s;h my Arm, <HI>Jer.</HI> 17.6. And this affected me. Grace if &s;elf was but Fle&s;h in Re&s;pect of God: (2) Here I &s;aw the common and great Sin of all Men in their Ways and Acts: They do tru&s;t to them&s;elves, and &s;tay in them&s;elves, and have &s;ome Bottom to &s;tand upon be&s;ide God, when they come to act: (3) I &s;aw the admirable &s;trange Operation of Faith, that nullifies all Things, even it &s;elf, that God may act. It's a Faith under, or &s;tirring under Faith, that doth the Deed. A Chri&s;tian by it goes, not only out of him&s;elf; but out of his Faith: (4) Hence I &s;aw, how near to God Faith made a Chri&s;tian; rai&s;ing it above Man, out of Man, out of him&s;elf, to God: That the Deity doth as it were im|mediately act upon the Soul, when it is thus elevated and lift out of it &s;elf.&mdash;Now here aro&s;e a Que&s;tion [1] <HI>What of God doth Faith rai&s;e it to?</HI> I &s;aw it was (1) To God as <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> (1) In Father (2) In Son (3) In Holy Gho&s;t; And there Faith &s;tays: [2] To God as <HI>efficient.</HI> And on &s;uch a God, and &s;uch Strength of a God it &s;tays. A [2d.] Que&s;tion was; <HI>Whether Faith re&s;ts on the Lord's Efficiency immediately, or medi|ately?</HI> I an&s;wered both Ways. But (1) <HI>mediately</HI> (1) To God in a Command.

to re&s;t on: Now it looks to him, that he may look to it, and do for it abundantly&mdash;And be&s;ide, there needs immediate, omnipotent Efficacy in God's Command and Promi&s;e: And hence it mu&s;t re&s;t on this, el&s;e they are u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 10. I kept <HI>a private Fa&s;t</HI> for Light to &s;ee the Glory of God's Truth and Faith, an infu&s;ed Faith, and a Spirit of Prayer, and for Conque&s;t of Pride; and for A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Aceptance and Guidance, (whether I &s;hould &s;et up Lecture again) and for Succe&s;s and Ble&s;&s;ing in my poor Mini&s;try, that &s;o I might declare and manife&s;t God's Name, and leave his Truth and &s;o him&s;elf, and &s;o his Mercy in the <HI>Country;</HI> As al&s;o for outward Supplies for <HI>the Country.</HI> And I &s;aw no par|ticular Man could be comfortably provided for, but by &s;ome &s;pecial Mercy to the <HI>Common State.</HI> And hence I &s;aw God called for Prayer, not &s;o much for our &s;elves, as <HI>the Common.</HI> And I &s;aw the common State of the Country did lie upon me and every one in particular, to &s;eek God for, viz. That he would build up our Zion and pro&s;per the Vine his own Hand hath planted; and that in this New World we might find the New Heavens and the New Earth; as al&s;o for Pardon.</P>
<P>Over Night I did que&s;tion, <HI>whether the Lord did call me to Him in &s;uch a Day?</HI> And I &s;aw, the Lord cal|led upon Scorners to turn at Wi&s;dom's Reproof, and to dig for Wi&s;dom. And on the Morning betimes in Prayer, the Lord let me &s;ee, he called me unto him: "Come and &s;eek and &s;eek with all thy Heart." And this came fre&s;h and clear to me, and did much affect my Heart, to think that the Lord &s;hould call unto me, as he did call <HI>Abraham</HI> to follow him. And here I began to have &s;ome Light let in about <HI>effect|ual Calling;</HI> And I &s;aw the&s;e Things about it: [1] I &s;aw the fir&s;t Act of Calling was by the Com|mand of God in his Word: [2] That it was by the Word of the Go&s;pel, or Command of the Go&s;pel,

[3] I &s;aw the Lord did this effectually; (1) By letting in a Light, clearly to &s;ee that he called me in particular, (2) By letting in the Goodne&s;s and Sweetne&s;s of the Com|mand, as well as the Truth of it: [4] This Goodne&s;s and Sweetne&s;s of the Command I &s;aw in two Things! (1) In Regard of the great Love of God in the Com|mand, for a poor Sinner, thinking God cares not for it, and hence would not have it come to him, being &s;o vile: O, the Command, which &s;aith, Yet return, and &s;eek, and come, is exceeding &s;weet Love; (2) In Re|gard of the End of the Command, which was Fellow|&s;hip with him&s;elf, that he may be all and do all: This was &s;weet: [5] I &s;aw, this was not only by a Com|mand, though fir&s;tly, &s;o, but nextly by his Promi&s;e: And this Promi&s;e I &s;aw was not to be &s;een but in the Word: And I &s;aw all Things promi&s;ed to &s;uch a one as comes. And hence I &s;aw, I had no need of &s;earch|ing God's Election as I did begin to do in the Morning, whether he loves me, or no: For I &s;aw (1) God the Father's Favour promi&s;ed; <HI>"Re|turn, and I'll return to you!</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 32. (2) I &s;aw Chri&s;t promi&s;ed; for we are called to his Fellow&s;hip, and are bid to take him: <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 55.1, 2.

<P>In the Beginning of the 2d Prayer I &s;aw there was a God, for I &s;aw Things had a Being; hence they mu&s;t have this Being from them&s;elves, or &s;omething el&s;e: But tho&s;e poor Creatures the Moon and Stars could not give Being to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I &s;aw al&s;o, <HI>how I had embraced the Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h, the Lu&s;t of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life, a long Time.</HI> And hence I &s;aw it was not only ju&s;t and righteous that

the Lord &s;hould deny to hear my Prayers, but that it was Mercy he would do &s;o: For what greater Judgment, than to plea&s;e a Lu&s;t, and leave me to it?</P>
<P>I &s;aw al&s;o <HI>the Pride of my Heart in one Thing more, I &s;aw not before;</HI> viz. in &s;etting upon Preaching out of an Apprehen&s;ion of the Excellency of what I de|livered above others, and that the&s;e Truths that came from me were choice and excellent and to be received with high E&s;teem. For, were it not for &s;uch a fooli&s;h Conceit, I &s;hould think my Mini&s;try le&s;s and wor&s;e than any Man's el&s;e, and &s;hould hang down my Head in a Hole and not lift it up to &s;peak; which did hum|ble me, and &s;hew me my Vanity, and that my Duty was to be carried on, not by &s;uch a Principle: But (1) Becau&s;e it was God's &s;weet Truth I did deliver: (2) Becau&s;e it was God's Command I &s;hould deliver it: (3) That it was for the &s;ake of the Lord and his Name, wherefore I did &s;o. And here I &s;aw the Lord begin as it were to refine me.</P>
<P>I concluded this Day [1] with &s;ome Mea&s;ure of <HI>Faith;</HI> for after Prayer, I left all I pray'd for unto God's rich free Grace. And hence I &s;aw (1) That the Lord did take Plea&s;ure in &s;uch as hope in his Mer|cy; (2) That what&s;oever I, or any had pray'd for, God had promi&s;ed, and therefore purpo&s;ed to give; and thence I might quiet my Heart about God's &s;e|cret Purpo&s;e: [2] With <HI>Re&s;olution;</HI> (1) Whatever God &s;hould give me, to attribute it unto Grace; (2) To walk in a Way of Holine&s;s for the Future.</P>
<P>I &s;aw al&s;o that <HI>my Heart was ready to think, I have prayed enough after &s;uch a Day and &s;uch Hopes.</HI> But I &s;aw (1) That though God purpo&s;eth Mercy, yet he withal intendeth the Decree &s;hall bring forth by Pray|er: (2) He will therefore have us pray till the Thing be granted: (3) When the Decree hath begun to bring forth, I &s;aw that all the Degrees of Mercy ari&s;e by &s;everal Degrees of Prayer: As when Faith is begun,

<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 13. I was <HI>con&s;idering the State of the Country by Rea&s;on of its Poverty.</HI> I had two Arguments &s;ug|ge&s;ted to make me hope the Lord would relieve us&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e, if the Lord had given him&s;elf for his People to redeem them from the greate&s;t Sin of the World; then from out of tho&s;e Sins by which our Di&s;tre&s;&s;es are occa&s;ioned now: (2) Becau&s;e we are a poor afflicted People, ca&s;t out of our own Country from our Friends and Comforts there; and all our Sorrows and Suffering here are in Part by Rea&s;on of their Cru|elty and Per&s;ecution; and that therefore the Lord will deliver, if we &s;ought. O Lord, remember my Sighs!</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 13. I <HI>&s;aw a little of God, and &s;aw that it was my Duty to make him &s;uperior, and &s;et him up in his Highne&s;s above all others in my Mind and Eye:</HI> and I &s;aw I had (1) Cau&s;e of Wondring at my Carriage to|ward him, that he being &s;o high, I &s;hould neglect him; (2) I &s;aw I had therefore &s;inned again&s;t him, becau&s;e I had &s;et up my Self, or Sin, or Men above the Lord: (3) I &s;aw, that in this did appear one &s;pecial Branch of the Evil of Sin, becau&s;e the Breach of God's Law did ever ari&s;e from the Contempt of the Lord's Per&s;on and De&s;pi&s;ing of him and his Glory, in preferring vile Things in Compari&s;on before him; and hence I &s;light|ed his Will: (4) I &s;aw I had Rea&s;on to re&s;olve that as I had de&s;pi&s;ed God and &s;et up other Things and &s;er|ved them; &s;o to de&s;pi&s;e my &s;elf and the Pre&s;ence of all Men in compari&s;on of him: (5) The Lord made me that Night lie down and be humbled in my &s;elf, and exalt the Lord with &s;ome De&s;ires.</P>

<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 15. On my Bed in the Morning I tried my Heart, and a&s;ked, What would bear it out, if the Lord &s;hould call me to preach at the Lecture Sea&s;on again? And I found three Things; (1) My End was to honour Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and leave his Truth behind me: (2) My Principle was Chri&s;t, in whom I tru&s;ted: For this com|forted me again&s;t the Feeling of my Inability; I &s;aw there was an unknown Fulne&s;s of the Spirit and Strength in Chri&s;t, and that I was not to go out in the Strength of my own Abilities though received from Chri&s;t, but in the Strength and Help of Chri&s;t him&s;elf: (3) Though what I &s;hould do thus from Chri&s;t, for Chri&s;t, was mean and poor; yet it &s;hould quiet me that it was the Mea&s;ure the Lord &s;aw mo&s;t meet for me, and if I could do better, I would: (4) That if the Lord did not give Succe&s;s to me, yet I would mourn for God's People and my own Unworthine&s;s, and quiet my &s;elf, that I did my Duty.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 16. I <HI>felt my Heart very un&s;avoury, and I &s;aw my Soul nothing but Sin and Sorrow, Death and Darkne&s;s,</HI> and in a Manner, as good as in Hell.

But I &s;aw it is the Plea&s;ure of God's Grace to help all that pray'd for it and came for it to Grace. And I &s;aw herein was Part of God's good Plea&s;ure, to hear every Prayer, and I &s;hould look upon no other Secrets but this revealed Will of Chri&s;t: And &s;o I purpo&s;ed ever to lie here.

<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 18. As I was going down my Stairs, I thought, If <HI>Paul</HI> did &s;o de&s;ire the Good of the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI>

And &s;o I left them to God's free Grace to provide for them. And at Night I had Doubts, whe|ther the Lord would regard them, or no, though I did re&s;ign them up to him. But it came to my Mind, that if God was an Idol God, then I might give them to him in vain; but it was not &s;o. And hence I had very &s;weet Per&s;wa&s;ion that Night, that my Work herein was not de&s;pi&s;ed of the Lord.</P>
<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 21. On <HI>Sabbath Day</HI> after Preaching, <HI>I con&s;idered my Vilene&s;s,</HI> that I did not &s;ee Things by the Lord's Light, nor was per&s;waded by the Lord's Faith, not quickned nor &s;trengthened by the Lord's Life and Strength. So I demanded a Rea&s;on, why the Lord Je&s;us did not only, not outwardly help, but not in|wardly act? I &s;aw the Lord was not in me, hence did not work in me. I a&s;ked then, Why he was not in me? I &s;aw my Sin had &s;eparated him from me: Yet I &s;aw no Sin could &s;eparate if Unbelief was not ad|ded. If I returned by Faith, he would return to me. Then being ready to come, and yet &s;eeing God's Grace only could draw me; I demanded, Whether I &s;hould put this Honour on God's Grace to draw me, or take it to my &s;elf, in coming by my own Strength? So I left my Soul with God's free Grace. Yet I &s;aw that though Chri&s;t did not act in me in the &s;ame Mea|&s;ure as in <HI>Paul,</HI> who &s;aid <HI>Chri&s;t did live in him:</HI> yet I &s;aw he did act in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, though little: (1) Becau&s;e I did de&s;ire the Lord to act all (2) Becau&s;e I mourned for want of this, and loathed my &s;elf for what I did: (3) Becau&s;e I did rejoice if the Lord would act me. And the next Morning I &s;aw the Truth of this in <HI>Paul</HI>'s Example, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. by <HI>the Thorn in the Fle&s;h,</HI> to whom the Lord &s;aid, <HI>My Grace,</HI> in pardoning,

I &s;aw the Lord, and <HI>by Faith did ap|prehend Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> and did &s;ee that I was to make U&s;e of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s apprehended by Faith, not only for Satisfaction to Ju&s;tice, but al&s;o to take it as an Evidence, un&s;potted, of the Lord's Love towards me, to beget Peace in me. I &s;aw I had a long Time made u&s;e of it for <HI>Satisfaction,</HI> but not for <HI>Evidence,</HI> and &s;o for <HI>Peace.</HI> For I &s;aw when I had done, and the Lord had enabled me to do this and do that, then my Con&s;cience was at Peace, and got Peace in that? But when I wanted that, and appre|hended Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s by Faith, all that which he hath done perfectly, I did not there find Peace to my Con&s;cience, as having an Evidence of the Lord's Favour and Acceptance. Whenas I &s;aw that if any Thing I did by the Help of the Spirit might give me Evidence; then much more all that which Chri&s;t did, and had done perfectly ought to give me Peace, and be an Evidence, not only of God's Favour to me, but of that Grace I want; (the want of which made me doubt of the Lord's Love) becau&s;e all that Faith and Holine&s;s in Chri&s;t is by Faith made mine; and it is as if I had done it. For I &s;aw, if I had perfect Ho|line&s;s in me, I &s;hould not doubt of the Lord's Love to me; Why now, when I &s;ee I have it in Chri&s;t by Faith? So I &s;aw <HI>a threefold U&s;e of Faith in Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. For Satisfaction to Divine Ju&s;tice, and making me righteous;</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. For Evidence of God's Favour to me;</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. For the Honour of God, becau&s;e by that I honour God infinitely.</ITEM>

<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 24. I felt over Night <HI>much Darkne&s;s and Unbelief;</HI> and &s;aw, that if Satan had once made us begin to doubt, he would hold us with Doubts con|tinually,
<PB N="67" REF="006067_0172_102751C4AAB78C00">
about the Being of God and Truth of the Scriptures. And I &s;aw the next Morning this Error; viz. That I did believe what the Lord &s;pake, becau&s;e I &s;aw it agreeable to my Rea&s;on, and &s;o made that my la&s;t Re&s;olution of all Doubts. And I began to think, how it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e? So I &s;aw I was in|deed to &s;ee the Things God &s;pake, in the Reality of them, and in their Agreement with Rea&s;on, but not to make this the la&s;t Re&s;olution of Doubts, though a Re&s;olution. But then, when I had &s;een Things &s;o a|greeable to Rea&s;on, yet to look upon <HI>God's Te&s;timony of them in Scripture</HI> as the la&s;t and chief Light and Ground of Settlement; and not to believe the&s;e Things are true, becau&s;e I &s;ee they are true, but to believe, the Lord &s;ees them more clearly than I: and he knowing them to be &s;o, I &s;ee them &s;o, and believe them upon his Te&s;timony, much more: For if I be|lieve any Thing to be true, becau&s;e I &s;ee it &s;o; much more becau&s;e God &s;aith it, who &s;ees it better, and who&s;e Word &s;takes me down, and confirms me in it.</P>

<P>(1) By withdrawing the Spirit of Light, to give me a greater Mea&s;ure of it than ever I have had before; to give me a greater Fulne&s;s by praying for more; (2) To humble me for my Confidence in my Light and Knowledge pa&s;t; and in &s;peaking &s;o much with &s;o little Light, who knew &s;o little; (3) To heal this Wound of &s;ecret Athei&s;m and Unbelief, which was but &s;kin'd over before. I &s;aw all this was infinite Love and Mercy: Yet I &s;aw this Condition was a deep and deadly Mi&s;ery; and I &s;aw, I &s;hould be vile indeed, if I did not mourn bitterly under it: For if I was on|ly under the Mi&s;ery of Affliction, the Lord would be di&s;plea&s;ed and count him&s;elf neglected, if I did not cry;

much more if I &s;hould not cry under the Power of my Sins.&mdash;This was on <HI>Saturday Night.</HI></P>
<P>I al&s;o &s;aw <HI>a va&s;t Difference between knowing Things</HI> by <HI>Rea&s;on and Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> and by <HI>Faith,</HI> or <HI>the Spirit of Faith.</HI> For by Di&s;cour&s;e, (1) I &s;aw that a Thing was &s;o. A Man's Di&s;cour&s;e about &s;piritual Things is like a Philo&s;opher's Di&s;cour&s;e about the inward Forms of Things, which they &s;ee not, yet &s;ee that they be; but by the Light of the Spirit of Faith I &s;ee the Thing pre|&s;ented, as it is. I have &s;een a God by Rea&s;on, and never been amazed at God thus apprehended; But I have &s;een God him&s;elf, and been ravi&s;hed to behold him. And here I &s;aw, what the Meaning of Chri&s;t's Speech is <HI>John.</HI> 14. <HI>The World knows not the Spirit,</HI> and hence <HI>cannot receive him;</HI> viz. That 'tis &s;uch a Spirit, as gives &s;uch Glimp&s;es of God's Glory, and of Chri&s;t, as though it departs, yet they know it &s;o good, as that they long for it again, becau&s;e they know it. And here I &s;aw the Meaning of that in <HI>Job, There is a Spirit in Man,</HI> that is, Rea&s;on; <HI>but the In&s;piration of the Almighty gives Under&s;tanding,</HI> that is, this Spirit of Faith.</P>
<P><HI>Decemb.</HI> 9. On <HI>Thur&s;day Morning</HI> in my Bed, after my <HI>Wedne&s;day's Sermon,</HI> (1) <HI>I &s;aw the Pride of my Heart acting thus;</HI> That when I had done publick Work, my Heart would pre&s;ently look out and enquire wherein I had done well or ill. And I &s;aw, I rejoiced in that as well done, which plea&s;ed Man; and that as done ami&s;s, which might not be &s;o glorious in the Eyes of Man. Hereupon I &s;aw my Vilene&s;s, to make Men's Opinions my Rule; but then I &s;aw <HI>my Rule to be this,</HI> viz. To &s;ee what good I had done, and give the Lord the Glory; and to con&s;ider, what Sin I had commit|ted, and to mourn for that. (2) <HI>Here I &s;aw a De|ceipt;</HI> viz. To preach and pray, to &s;tir up &s;piritual Affections, becau&s;e I &s;aw it did beget Commendations; hence preach'd Terror and Comfort (though fal&s;e) to beget Affection.

<P><HI>Decemb.</HI> 10. I <HI>began to be troubled for my Sin of Pa&s;|&s;ion:</HI> but I &s;aw my Heart did work thus; (1) It was troubled for the Shame and Horror of Sin; (2) purpo&s;|ed; (3) went to Chri&s;t for Strength that I might do &s;o no more, and &s;o was quieted. Whereas I &s;aw it was my Duty, (1) To get my Soul deeply loaden with the Sin, as Sin; (2) To come unto Chri&s;t, and get his Blood to give me Peace un&s;peakable. Now in mu&s;ing on this, I &s;aw how little Repentance there was in the World, and how many Sins I had &s;till to repent of. For I &s;aw that mo&s;t Men had their Peace after Sin, either by Forgetfulne&s;s of it wholly, and &s;o had their Sorrows now and then; or el&s;e they did but &s;kin over their Wound with &s;ome general Hope of Mercy and Grace, without &s;weet Peace in Chri&s;t's Blood. And hence my Heart was very glad for this Light, in &s;ee|ing this general Wound.</P>
<P>I &s;aw here al&s;o <HI>the Rea&s;on why Men given to Pa&s;&s;ion are &s;o frequently overcome by it;</HI> becau&s;e of all other Sins they have many &s;ecret Excu&s;es and Extenuations for it; as the Suddenne&s;s of it, and 'tis that I delight not in, and my Heart is &s;ad for it afterward, and godly Men may fall into it.</P>
<P>I &s;aw al&s;o, there was all <HI>Rea&s;on why I &s;hould cleave to the Lord:</HI> 1. Becau&s;e all my Good was from him in Times of Peace: 2.

<HI>Decemb.</HI> 11. On <HI>Saturday</HI> at <HI>Night,</HI> I was <HI>&s;tirr'd up to pray for the Spirit:</HI> Not only for particular Graces of it, but for the Spirit it &s;elf. <HI>The Ground of this my Prayer was;</HI></P>
<P>(1) Becau&s;e I felt an Ab&s;ence of the Spirit exceeding much. I found I was &s;en&s;ual and carnal, and carried and acted by my own Spirit in every Thing, However I felt a little of God's Spirit &s;moaking forth in &s;ome weak De&s;ires after it; I felt not the Power of it, accord|ing as <HI>Paul</HI> did <HI>bound by</HI> it, <HI>led with</HI> it. <HI>Acts</HI> 1. <HI>Power from on high:</HI> (2) Becau&s;e I &s;aw this the next and &s;ure&s;t Way to have all the Graces of the Spirit; to have all the Impre&s;&s;ions of this Seal, by having the Seal it &s;elf. Whereas, if I wrought for one particular Grace without this, it was far about: (3) Becau&s;e the Spirit can heal, help, quicken, humble, &s;uddenly, and ea&s;ily; Whereas otherwi&s;e I may be long before I can &s;ee: (4) Becau&s;e it works Grace and Life effectually. My own Spirit, and Light, and Affection may deceive me when they act; but this cannot: (5) Becau&s;e it works Grace eternally, as it &s;elf is eternal.</P>
<P>I al&s;o here &s;aw <HI>two great Hindrances</HI> for me in getting this Spirit: (1) I contented my &s;elf with a little Mea|&s;ure of it, and &s;o &s;et down: (2) I thought God would not give more, and hence I ought to re&s;t without &s;eeking after more.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o fell in <HI>two Que&s;tions.</HI> [1] <HI>Que&s;t.</HI> Whether, when a Chri&s;tian feels a Want of the Light of Life and Faith of the Spirit; he &s;hould only humble him&s;elf for the Want of them, and do nothing in way of Meditation and &s;tirring up his Heart to &s;ee and do, or &s;tir up that Ability he had to &s;ee and live and do? For I &s;aw this, that when a Man finds a Lo&s;s of God, either he is wholly in the Dark and cannot &s;ee him; or el&s;e Satan and his own natural Abilities will be working and ca&s;ting in Light, that &s;o a Man might be contented with that and &s;eek no farther for the Spirit of Light, nor feel
<PB N="71" REF="006067_0176_102751C95E6B4310">
&s;uch a Need of it: Satan and Nature by their Work will prevent the Lord's.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> To this I &s;aw (1) that the Scripture bids me meditate and u&s;e all Means for the Spirit, and therefore not to confine my &s;elf to that one Means only, of being humbled for the Want of the Spirit: (2) That the <HI>Rule here is;</HI> We mu&s;t u&s;e all Means, but tru&s;t to the Spirit to give a Ble&s;&s;ing by them, depend only, and wait only for the Light of God in the U&s;e of Means.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Que&s;t.</HI> Whether it was a Duty, or an Error, to pray and look for the Fulne&s;s of the Spirit in me, with|out coming by Faith out of my &s;elf, and &s;o finding and feeling the Fulne&s;s of the Spirit out of me in Chri&s;t? And whether I might not be mi&s;taken, and think I was empty of the Spirit, becau&s;e I did not feel it in me, when haply of the Time when I am mo&s;t empty, I might be mo&s;t full, by Faith in Chri&s;t? And whether the Fulne&s;s of the Spirit in the Apo&s;tles was not chiefly a Power of the Spirit, giving them a Sub&s;i&s;tence out of them&s;elves in Chri&s;t, in whom their Life and Joy was; &s;eeing that <HI>Paul</HI> oft complains of his Sin and In&s;ufficiency and Ina|bility to think or &s;peak?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Here I &s;aw the&s;e Things; (1) That Chri&s;t had all Fulne&s;s, and &s;o all Fulne&s;s of the Spirit: (2) That all that Fulne&s;s which I did want in my &s;elf was in Chri&s;t, for his People, not for him&s;elf. He had per|fect Knowledge and Grace and Righteou&s;ne&s;s; not only that by it he might vertually make me &s;ee and be righteous; but that it might be mine: (3) I &s;aw it my Duty therefore, out of Sen&s;e of my Emptine&s;s, to go unto Chri&s;t and po&s;&s;e&s;s and enjoy all that Fulne&s;s that is in him, as mine own; and to be as much filled with that, and to rejoice as much in that, as if I had it in my &s;elf, becau&s;e it is for me in Chri&s;t, and my own there: (4) I &s;aw when I did thus, then I was full of the Spirit: and that I was now as a Fi&s;h that is got from the Shore to the Sea, where it hath all Fulne&s;s

of Waters to move in: And &s;o I &s;aw, <HI>Faith did</HI> fir&s;t fill me, and <HI>&s;hould</HI> fir&s;t fill me: When I was mo&s;t empty, then by Faith I was mo&s;t full: (5) I &s;aw this was the Way to be filled with the Spirit, to my feeling within me. <HI>Stephen</HI> was full of Faith, and then of the Holy Gho&s;t: (1) Becau&s;e this made me mo&s;t empty, and &s;o mo&s;t fit for the Spirit to work in: (2) Becau&s;e this Finding of the Trea&s;ure of all Grace in this Field of Chri&s;t did be|get Strength, Joy, Glory, and &s;o made Graces alive: (3) Becau&s;e I &s;hould glory more in what I receive from Chri&s;t, than in that Fulne&s;s which is in Chri&s;t, the Foun|tain of all his Glory and my Good and Glory, if I &s;hould fir&s;t receive the Spirit from him, without finding, and filling and drinking in of that Spirit which is in him: (6) I &s;aw a Need for the Lord to this End to do two Things; (1) To &s;tabli&s;h me in Chri&s;t, and &s;ettle me there, and give me a Being there; (2) To give me a Certainty, that all this was mine; for I &s;aw, this only would fill my Heart and Soul.</P>
<P>The <HI>Conclu&s;ion of all</HI> was, I was re&s;olved to pray for the Spirit, and not to give the Lord over for it.</P>
<P><HI>Dec.</HI> 18. I &s;aw it my Duty &s;o to lament my Sin, as that my Sorrow &s;hould &s;wallow up all the Joy I took in any Thing in this World. And here I remembred what it was to afflict one's Soul; viz. To make Sin as bitter as Affliction, and to make it my Affliction.</P>
<P><HI>Dec.</HI> 20. I &s;aw my Evil, (1) That I had much ado to &s;ee my Sin; (2) But much more difficult was it to mourn for it, as my Death, and to be in Travail with it, and in Pangs and Sorrows for it, that I might be de|livered out of it.</P>
<P>I &s;aw al&s;o on the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> viz. the Day before, <HI>Dec.</HI> 20, How my Heart gathered Evil in every Place, as <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 57. And it gathered, either, (1) Carnal Con|tent, or (2) Di&s;content, by &s;triking upon external Objects.</P>
<P><HI>Dec.</HI> 21. I &s;aw that Man was an infinite kind of Evil,

when he is cro&s;s'd; as in Hell, there he bla&s;phemes be|cau&s;e cro&s;s'd. And hence Men's Sins lie hid, becau&s;e not cro&s;s'd.</P>
<P>I &s;aw al&s;o the Deceit of Man's Heart; which when it is very bad, then it begins to &s;eek to be very good; if it have and feel any Good, it grows full and lifted up and loo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Dec.</HI> 27. God humbled me in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, (1) Making me &s;ee, how I de&s;erved Death, and nothing but eternal Death; and that it belonged to me as my Due, which made me wonder I had any Mercy; (2) Making me de&s;irous to feel Sin the greate&s;t Evil, and to prize deliverance from it, as out of Hell.</P>
<P>I &s;aw al&s;o, (1) How mi&s;erable I was, If I had no Favour; (2) How precious his Favour was; (3) How exceeding precious Chri&s;t was, by whom I came to have all Favour; and how precious his Blood was, &s;o as I de&s;ired to rejoice in nothing, but in Chri&s;t.</P>
