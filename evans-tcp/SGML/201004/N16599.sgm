<HEAD TYPE="sub">The <HI>ADDRESS</HI> and <HI>REASONS</HI> of <HI>DISSENT</HI> of the <HI>MINO|RITY</HI> of the <HI>CONVENTION</HI> of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania to their Con&s;tituents.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not until after the termination of the late glorious conte&s;t, which made the people of the United States an indedendent nation, that any defect was di&s;|covered in the pre&s;ent confederation. It was form|ed by &s;ome of the able&s;t patriots in America. It carried us &s;ucce&s;sfully through the war; and the virtue and patrioti&s;m of the people, with their di&s;po&s;ition to pro|mote the common cau&s;e, &s;upplied the want of power in Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>The requi&s;ition of Congre&s;s for the five per cent. im|po&s;t was made before the peace, &s;o early as the fir&s;t of February, 1781, but was prevented taking effect by the refu&s;al of one &s;tate; yet it is probable every &s;tate in the union would have agreed to this mea&s;ure, at that pe|riod, had it not been for the extravagant terms in which it was demanded. The requi&s;ition was new moulded in the year 1783, and accompanied with an additional de|mand of certain &s;upplementary funds for twenty-five years. Peace had now taken place, and the United States found them&s;elves labouring under a con&s;iderable foreign and dome&s;tic debt, incurred during the war. The requi&s;ition of 1783, was commen&s;urate with the intere&s;t of the debt, as it was then calculated; but it has been more accurately a&s;certaine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> that time. The dome&s;tic debt has been fou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to fall &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|lio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of the calculation, and it has late|ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed by large &s;ales of the we&s;tern lands. The &s;tates have been called on by Con|gre&s;s annually for &s;upplies, until the general &s;y&s;tem of finance, propo&s;ed in 1783, &s;hould take place.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="021344_0004_0FB31F02CE420640">It was at this time that the want of an efficient fede|ral government was fir&s;t complained of, and that the powers ve&s;ted in Congre&s;s were found to be inadequate to the procuring of the benefits that &s;hould re&s;ult from the union. The impo&s;t was granted by mo&s;t of the &s;tates, but many refu&s;ed the &s;upplementary funds; the annual requi&s;itions were &s;et at nought by &s;ome of the &s;tates, while others complied with them by legi&s;lative acts, but were tardy in their payments, and Congre&s;s found them&s;elves incapable of complying with their engagements, and &s;upporting the federal government. It was found, that our national character was &s;inking in the opinion of foreign nations. The Congre&s;s could make treaties of commerce, but could not enforce the ob&s;ervance of them. We were &s;uffering from the re|&s;trictions of foreign nations, who had &s;hackled our com|merce, while we were unable to retaliate: and all now agreed that it would be advantageous to the union to enlarge the powers of Congre&s;s; that they &s;hould be enabled in the ample&s;t manner to regulate commerce, and to lay and collect duties on the imports throughout tho United States. With this view a convention was fir&s;t propo&s;ed by Virginia, and finally recommended by Congre&s;s for the different &s;tates to appoint deputies to meet in convention, "for the purpo&s;e of revi&s;ing and amending the pre&s;ent articles of confederation, &s;o as to make them adequate to the exigencies of the union." This recommendation the legi&s;latures of twelve &s;tates complied with &s;o ha&s;tily as not to con&s;ult their con&s;ti|tuents on the &s;ubject; and though the different legi&s;la|tures had no authority from their con&s;tituents for the purpo&s;e, they probably apprehended the nece&s;&s;ity would ju&s;tify the mea&s;ure; and none of them extended their ideas, at that time, further than "revi&s;ing and amend|ing the pre&s;ent articles of confederation." Penn&s;ylva|nia, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> appointing deputies, expre&s;sly confined their powers to this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> though it is probable that &s;ome of the members of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tate, had at that time in contemplation to annihilate the pre|&s;ent confederation, as well as the con&s;titution of Penn|&s;ylvania, yet the plan was not &s;ufficiently matured to communicate it to the public.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="021344_0005_0FB31F04EA2615B8">The majority of the legi&s;lature of this commonwealth were at that time under the influence of the members from the city of Philadelphia. They agreed, that the deputies &s;ent by them to convention, &s;hould have no compen&s;ation for their &s;ervices, which determination was calculated to prevent the election of any member who re&s;ided at a di&s;tance from the city. It was in vain for the minority to attempt electing delegates to the convention, who under&s;tood the circum&s;tances and the feelings of the people, and had a common intere&s;t with them. They found a di&s;po&s;ition in the leaders of the majority of the hou&s;e to choo&s;e them&s;elves and &s;ome of their depend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nts. The minority attempted to prevent this by agreeing to vote for &s;ome of the leading mem|bers, who they knew had influence enough to be ap|pointed at any rate, in hopes of carring with them &s;ome re&s;pectable citizens of Philadelphia, in who&s;e prin|ciples and integrity they could have more confidence; but even in this they were di&s;appointed, except in one member: the eighth member was added at a &s;ub&s;equent &s;e&s;&s;ion of the a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>The continental convention met in the city of Phila|delphia at the time appointed. It was compo&s;ed of &s;ome men of excellent characters; of others, who were more remarkable for their ambition and cunning, than their patrioti&s;m; and of &s;ome who had been opponents to the con&s;titution of this commonwealth. The con|vention &s;at upwards of four months. The doors were kept &s;hut, and the members brought under the mo&s;t &s;olemn engagements of &s;ecrecy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The journals of the conclave are &s;till cancealed.</NOTE> Some of tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed their going &s;o far beyond their powers, retired, hopele&s;s, from the convention; others had the firm|ne&s;s to refu&s;e &s;igning the plan altogether; and many who did &s;ign it, did it not as a &s;y&s;tem they wholly ap|proved, but as the be&s;t that could be the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> obtained, and notwith&s;tanding the time &s;pent on this &s;ubject, it is agreed on all hands to be a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of ha&s;te and accom|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="8 letters">.</P>

were bu&s;ily employed in alarming the fears of the peo|ple with dangers which did not exi&s;t, and exciting their hopes of greater advantages from the expected plan than even the be&s;t government on earth can produce.</P>
<P>The propo&s;ed plan had not many hours i&s;&s;ued forth, from the womb of &s;u&s;picious &s;ecrecy, until &s;uch as were prepared for the purpo&s;e, were carrying about pe|titions for people to &s;ign, &s;ignifying their approbation of the &s;y&s;tem, and reque&s;ting the legi&s;lature to call a convention. While every mea&s;ure was taken to inti|midate the people again&s;t oppo&s;ing it, the public papers teemed with the mo&s;t violent threats again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould dare to think for them&s;elves, and tar and feathers were liberally promi&s;ed to all tho&s;e who would not im|mediately join in &s;upporting the propo&s;ed government, be it what it would. Under &s;uch circum&s;tances, peti|tions in favour of calling a convention, were &s;igned by great numbers in and about the city, before they had lei&s;ure to read and examine the &s;y&s;tem, many of whom, now they are better acquainted with it, and have had time to inve&s;tigate its principles, are heartily oppo&s;ed to it. The petitions were &s;peedily handed in to the le|gi&s;lature.</P>
<P>Affairs were in this &s;ituation, when on the 28th of September la&s;t, a re&s;olution was propo&s;ed to the a&s;&s;em|bly by a member of the hou&s;e who had been al&s;o a member of the federal convention, for calling a &s;tate convention, to be elected within ten days, for the pur|po&s;e of examining and adopting the propo&s;ed con&s;titu|tion of the united &s;tates, though at this time the hou&s;e had not received it from Congre&s;s. This attempt was oppo&s;ed by a minority, who, after offering every argu|ment in their power to prevent the precipitate mea&s;ure, without effect, ab&s;ented them&s;elves from the hou&s;e, as the only alternative left them, to prevent the mea&s;ures <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">king pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> previous to their con&s;tituents being ac|quainted with the bu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> That violence and outrage which had been often threatened, was now p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">&s;ed; &s;ome of the members were &s;eized the next day by a mob, collected for the purpo&s;e, and forcibly dragged to the hou&s;e, and there detained by force, while the quorum of the legi&s;lature &s;o formed, completed their re&s;olution.
<PB N="7" REF="021344_0007_0FB31F07502C32A0">
We &s;hall dwell no longer on this &s;ubject, the people of Penn&s;ylvania have been already acquainted therewith. We would only further ob&s;erve, that every member of the legi&s;lature, previou&s;ly to taking his &s;eat, by &s;olemn oath or affirmation, declares, "that they will not do or con&s;ent to any act or thing whatever that &s;hall have a tendency to le&s;&s;en or abridge their rights and privi|leges, as declared in the con&s;titution of this &s;tate." And that con&s;titution which they are &s;o &s;olemnly &s;worn to &s;upport, cannot legally be altered but by a recommen|dation of the council of cen&s;ors, who alone are autho|ri&s;ed to propo&s;e alterations and amendments, and even the&s;e mu&s;t be publi&s;hed at lea&s;t &s;ix months, for the con|&s;ideration of the people. The propo&s;ed &s;y&s;tem of go|vernment for the United States, if adopted, will alter, and may annihilate the con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania; and therefore the legi&s;lature had no authority whatever to recommend the calling a convention for that purpo&s;e. This proceeding could not be con&s;idered as binding on the people of this commonwealth. The hou&s;e was formed by violence, &s;ome of the members compo&s;ing it were detained by force, which alone would have vitiated any proceedings, to which they were otherwi&s;e compe|tent; but had the legi&s;lature been legally formed, this bu&s;ine&s;s was ab&s;olutely without their power.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation of affairs were the &s;ub&s;cribers elected members of the convention of Penn&s;ylvania. A con|vention called by a legi&s;lature in direct violation of their duty, and compo&s;ed in part of members, who were com|pelled to attend for that purpo&s;e, to con&s;ider of a con|&s;titution propo&s;ed by a convention of the United States, who were not appointed for the porpo&s;e of framing a new form of government, but who&s;e powers were ex|pre&s;sly confined to altering and amending the pre&s;ent articles of confederation. Therefore the members of the <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The continental convention, in direct violation of the 13th article of confederation, have declared, "that the ratification of nine &s;tates &s;hall be &s;ufficient for the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of this con&s;titution, between the &s;tates &s;o ratify|ing the &s;ame." Thus has the plighted faith of the &s;tates been &s;ported with! they had &s;olemnly engaged that the con|federation now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting &s;hould be inviolably pre&s;erved by each of them, and the union thereby formed &s;hould be per|petual, unle&s;s the &s;ame &s;hould be altered by mutual con&s;ent.</NOTE>

continental convention, in propo&s;ing the plan, acted as individuals, and not as deputies from Penn&s;ylvania &dagger;&mdash; the a&s;&s;embly who called the &s;tate convention acted as individuals, and not as the legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania; nor could they, or the convention cho&s;en on their re|commendation, have authority to do any act or thing, that can alter or annihilate the con&s;titution of Penn&s;yl|vania (both of which will be done by the new con&s;titu|tion) nor are their proceedings, in our opinion, at all binding upon the people.</P>
<P>The election for members of the convention was held at &s;o early a period, and the want of information was &s;o great, that &s;ome of us did not know of it until after it was over, and we have rea&s;on to believe, that great numbers of the people of Penn&s;ylvania have not yet had an opportunity of &s;ufficiently examining the propo&s;ed con&s;titution. We apprehend that no change can take place that will affect the internal government or con&s;ti|tution of this commonwealth, unle&s;s a majority of the people &s;hould evidence a wi&s;h for &s;uch a change; but on examining the number of votes given for members of the pre&s;ent &s;tate convention, we find, that of upwards of &s;eventy thou&s;and freemen who are entitled to vote in Penn&s;ylvania, the whole convention has been elected by about thirteen thou&s;and voters, and though two-thirds of the members of the convention have thought proper to ratify the propo&s;ed con&s;titution, yet tho&s;e two-thirds were elected by the votes of only &s;ix thou&s;and and eight hundred freemen.</P>
<P>In the city of Philadelphia, and &s;ome of the ea&s;tern counties, the junto that took the lead in the bu&s;ine&s;s agreed to vote for none but &s;uch as would &s;olemnly pro|mi&s;e to adopt the &s;y&s;tem <HI>in toto,</HI> without exerci&s;ing their judgment.

bound by the call of a &s;et of men who a&s;&s;embled at the &s;tate-hou&s;e in Philadelphia, and a&s;&s;umed the name of the legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania; and &s;ome were pre|vented from voting by the violence of the party who were determined at all events to force down the mea&s;ure. To &s;uch lengths did the tools of de&s;poti&s;m carry their outrage, that in the night of the election for members of convention in the city of Philadelphia, &s;everal of the &s;ub&s;cribers (being then in the city to tran&s;act your bu|&s;ine&s;s) were gro&s;sly abu&s;ed and in&s;ulted, while they were quiet in their lodgings; though they did not inter|fere, nor had any thing to do with &s;aid election; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut, as they apprehend, becau&s;e they were &s;uppo&s;ed to be ad|ver&s;e to the propo&s;ed con&s;titution, and would not came|ly &s;urren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r tho&s;e &s;acred rights which you have com|mitted to their charge.</P>
<P>The convention met, and the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition was &s;oon manife&s;ted in con&s;idering the propo&s;ed con&s;titu|tion, that had been exhibited in every other &s;tage of the bu&s;ine&s;s. We were prohibited by an expre&s;s vote of the convention, from taking any que&s;tion on the &s;epa|rate articles of the plan, and reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of adopting or rejecting <HI>in toto.</HI> It is true the majority permitted us to debate on each article, but re&s;trained us from propo&s;ing amendments. They al&s;o determined not to permit us to enter on the minutes our rea&s;ons of di&s;&s;ent again&s;t the whole. Thus &s;ituated we entered on the examination of the propo&s;ed &s;y&s;tem of government, and found it to be &s;uch as we could not adopt, without, as we conceived, &s;urrendering up your deare&s;t rights. We offered our objections to the convention, and oppo&s;ed tho&s;e parts of the plan, which, in our opinion, would be injurious to you, in the be&s;t manner we were able; and clo&s;ed our arguments by offering the following propo|&s;itions to the convention:</P>

<P>After reading the&s;e propo&s;itions, we declared our willingne&s;s to agree to the plan, provided it was &s;o amended as to meet tho&s;e propo&s;itions, or &s;omething &s;imilar to them: and finally moved the convention do adjourn, to give the people of Penn&s;ylvania time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o con&s;ider the &s;ubject, and determine for them&s;elves; but the&s;e were all rej<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cted, and the final vote was taken, when our duty to you induced us to vote again&s;t the propo&s;ed plan, and to decline &s;igning the ratification of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>During the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, we met with many in&s;ults, and &s;ome per&s;onal abu&s;e; we were not even treated with decency, during the &s;itting of the convention, by the per&s;ons in the gallery of the hou&s;e&punc; however, we flatter our<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elves, that in contending for the pre&s;ervation of tho&s;e invaluable rights you have thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">roper to commit to our charge, we acted with a &s;pirit becoming freemen, and being de&s;irous tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you might know the principles which actuated our conduct, and being pro|hibited from infering our rea&s;ons of di&s;&s;ent on the mi|nutes of the convention, we have &s;ubjoined them for your con&s;ideration, as to you alone we are accountable. It remains with you, whether you will think tho&s;e in|e&s;timable privileges, which you have &s;o ably contended for, &s;hould be &s;acrificed at the &s;hrine of de&s;poti&s;m, or

whether you mean to contend for them with the &s;ame &s;pirit that has &s;o often baffled the attempts of an ari&s;|tocratic faction, to rivet the &s;hackles of &s;lavery on you, and you unborn po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Our objections are compri&s;ed under three general heads of di&s;&s;ent, viz.</P>
<P>WE DISSENT, Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e it is the opinion of the mo&s;t celebrated writers on government, and con|firmed by uniform experience, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a very exten&s;ive ter|ritory cannot be governed on the principles of freedom otherwi&s;e than by a confederation of republics, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ing all the powers of internal governments; but united in the management of their general and foreign con|cerns.</P>
<P>If any doubt could have been entertained of the truth of the foregoing principle, it has been fully re|moved by the conce&s;&s;ion of Mr. Wil&s;on, one of the majority on this que&s;tion, and who was one of the de|puties in the late general convention. In ju&s;tice to him we will give his own words; they are as follows, viz. "The extent of country for which the new con&s;titution was required, produced another difficulty in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the federal convention. It is the opinion of &s;ome celebrated writers, that to a &s;mall territory, the demo|cratical; to a middling territory (as Monte&s;quieu has termed it) the monarchial; and to an exten&s;ive terri|tory, the de&s;potic form of government, is be&s;t adapted. Regarding, then, the wide and almo&s;t unbounded juri&s;|diction of the United States, at fir&s;t view, the hand of de&s;poti&s;m &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to controul, connect, and protect it; and hence the chief embarra&s;&s;ment ro&s;e. For we knew, that, although our con&s;tituents would cheerfully &s;ubmit to the legi&s;lative re&s;traints of a free go|vernment, they would &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urn at every a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tempt to &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cle them with de&s;potic power." And again, in another part of his &s;peech, he continues, "Is it probable that the di&s;|&s;olution of the &s;tate governments, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of one con&s;olidated empire, would be eligible in its na|ture, and &s;atisfactory to the people in its admini&s;tration? I think not, as I have given rea&s;ons to &s;hew, that &s;o ex|ten&s;ive a territory could not be governed, connected, and pre&s;erved, but by the &s;upremacy of de&s;potic power.

All the exertions of the mo&s;t potent emperors of Rome were not capable of keeping that empire together, which in extent was far inferior to the dominion of America."</P>
<P>We di&s;&s;ent, &s;econdly, becau&s;e the powers ve&s;ted in Congre&s;s by this con&s;titution, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily annihi|late and ab&s;orb the legi&s;lative, executive, and judicial powers of the &s;everal &s;tates, and produce from their ruins one con&s;olidated government, which, from the nature of things, will be an iron-handed de&s;poti&s;m, as nothing &s;hort of the &s;upremacy of de&s;potic &s;way could connect and govern the&s;e United States under one go|vernment.</P>
<P>As the truth of this po&s;ition is of &s;uch deci&s;ive im|portance, it ought to be fully inve&s;tigated, and if it is founded, to be clearly a&s;certained; for, &s;hould it be de|mon&s;trated, that the powers ve&s;ted by this con&s;titution in Congre&s;s, will have &s;uch an effect, as nece&s;&s;arily to produce one con&s;olidated government, the que&s;tion then will be reduced to this &s;hort i&s;&s;ue, viz. whether &s;atiated with the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty; whether repenting of the folly of &s;o recently a&s;&s;erting their unalienable rights, again&s;t foreign de&s;pots, at the expence of &s;o much blood and trea&s;ure, and &s;uch painful and arduous &s;truggles, the people of America are now willing to re&s;ign every privilege of freemen, and &s;ubmit to the domination of an ab&s;olute government, that will embrace all America in one chain of de&s;poti&s;m; or whether they will, with virtuous indignation, &s;purn at the &s;hackles prepared for them, and confirm their liberties by a conduct be|coming freemen?</P>
<P>That the new government will not be a confedera|cy of &s;tates, as it ought, but one con&s;olidated govern|ment, founded upon the de&s;truction of the &s;everal go|vernments of the &s;tates, we &s;hall now &s;hew.</P>
<P><HI>The powers of Congre&s;s, under the new con&s;titution, are complete and unlimited over the pur&s;e and the &s;word, and are perfectly independent of, and &s;upreme over, the &s;tate governments, who&s;e intervention in the&s;e great points is entirely de&s;troyed. By virtue of their power of taxati|on, Congre&s;s may command the whole, or any part of the property of the people. They may impo&s;e what impo&s;ts

"The Congre&s;s &s;hall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, impo&s;ts, and exci&s;es, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States."</HI></P>
<P><HI>As there is no one article of taxation re&s;erved to the &s;tate governments, the Congre&s;s may monopolite every &s;ource of revenue, and thus indirectly demoli&s;h the &s;tate governments, for without funds they could not exi&s;t; the taxes, duties, and exci&s;es impo&s;ed by Congre&s;s may be &s;o high as to render it impracticable to levy any further &s;ums on the &s;ame articles; but whether this &s;hould be the ca&s;e or not, if the &s;tate governments &s;hould pre&s;ume to impo&s;e taxes, duties, or exci&s;es, on the &s;ame articles with Congre&s;s, the latter may abrogate and repeal the laws whereby they are impo&s;ed, upon the allegation that they interfere with the due collection of their taxes, duties, or exci&s;es, by virtue of the following clau&s;e, part of &s;ection 8th, article 1&s;t, viz. "To make all laws which &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers ve&s;ted by this con&s;titution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof."</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Congre&s;s might glo&s;s over this conduct by con&s;truing every purpo&s;e for which the &s;tate legi&s;latures now lay taxes to be for the "general welfare," and therefore of their juri&s;diction.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And the &s;upremacy of the laws of the United States, is e&s;tabli&s;hed by article</HI> 6th, <HI>viz. "That this con&s;titution and the laws of the United States, which &s;hall be made in pur&s;uance thereof, and all treaties made, or which &s;hall be made, under the authority of the United States, &s;hall be the &s;upreme law of the land; and the judges in every &s;tate &s;hall be bound thereby, any thing in the con&s;titution or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of any &s;tate to the contrary notwith&s;tanding." It has been alledged, that the words "pur&s;uant to the con&s;ti|tution," are a re&s;triction upon the authority of Congre&s;s; but when it is con&s;idered, that by other &s;ections they are inve&s;ted with every efficient power of government, and

which may be exerci&s;ed to the ab&s;olute de&s;truction of the &s;tate governments, without any violation of even the forms of the con&s;titution, this &s;eeming re&s;triction, as well as every other re&s;triction in it appears to us to be nugatory and delu&s;ive, and only introduced as a blind upon the real na|ture of the government. In our opinion, "pur&s;uant to the con&s;titution." will be co-exten&s;ive with the will and plea&s;ure of Congre&s;s, which, indeed, will be the only limi|tation of their powers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We apprehend, that two co-ordinate &s;overeignties would be a &s;oleci&s;m in politics. That therefore, as there is no line of di&s;tinction drawn between the general, and &s;tate governments; as the &s;phere of their juri&s;diction is unde|fined, it would be contrary to the nature of things, that both &s;hould exi&s;t together, one or the other would nece&s;&s;a|rily triumph in the fullne&s;s of dominion. However, the conte&s;t could not be of long continuance, as the &s;tate go|vernments are dive&s;ted of every me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of defence, and will be obliged, by "the &s;upreme law of the land," to yield at di&s;cretion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It has been objected to this total de&s;truction of the &s;tate governments, that the exi&s;tence of their legi&s;latures is made e&s;&s;ential to the organization of Congre&s;s; that they mu&s;t a&s;&s;emble for the appointment of the &s;enators and pre|&s;ident general of the United States.

<P>The celebrated Monte&s;quien, in his Spirit of Laws, vol. I. p. 12, &s;ays, "that in a democracy, there can be no exerci&s;e of &s;overeignty, but by the &s;uffrages of the people, which are their will: now the &s;overeign's will is the &s;overeign him&s;elf: the laws, therefore, which e&s;ta|bli&s;h the right of &s;uffrage, are fundamental to this go|vernment.

recited &s;ections, is &s;o unlimited in its nature, may be &s;o comprehen&s;ive and boundle&s;s in its exerci&s;e, that this alone would be amply &s;ufficient to annihilate the &s;tate governments, and &s;wallow them up in the grand vortex of general empire.</P>
<P>The judicial powers, ve&s;ted in Congre&s;s, are al&s;o &s;o various and exten&s;ive, that by legal ingenuity they may be extended to every ca&s;e, and thus ab&s;orb the &s;tate ju|diciaries: and when we con&s;ider the deci&s;ive influence that a general judiciary would have over the civil polity of the &s;everal &s;tates, we do not he&s;itate to pronounce, that this power, unaided by the legi&s;lative, would effect a con&s;olidation of the &s;tates under one government.</P>
<P>The powers of a court of equity, ve&s;ted by this con|&s;titution in the tribunals of Congre&s;s&mdash;powers which do not exi&s;t in the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, unle&s;s &s;o far as they can be incorporated with jury trial&mdash;would, in this &s;tate, greatly contribute to this event. The rich and wealthy &s;uitor would eagerly lay hold of the infinite mazes, perplexities, and delays, which a court of chan|cery, with the appellate powers of the &s;upreme court, in fact, as well as law, would furni&s;h him with, and thus the poor man, being plunged in the bottomle&s;s pit of legal di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, would drop his demand in de&s;pair.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, con&s;olidation pervades the whole con&s;titution. It begins with an annunciation that &s;uch was the inten|tion. The main pillars of the fabric corre&s;pond with it: and the concluding paragraph is a confirmation of it. The preamble begins with the words, "We the people of the United States," which is the &s;tyle of a compact between individuals entering into a &s;tate of &s;o|ciety, and not that of a confederation of &s;tates. The other features of con&s;olidation, we have before noticed.</P>
<P>Thus we have fully e&s;tabli&s;hed the po&s;ition, that the powers ve&s;ted by this con&s;titution in Congre&s;s, will ef|fect a con&s;olidation of the &s;tates under one government, which even the advocates of this con&s;titution admit, could not be done without the &s;acrifice of all liberty.</P>
<P>We di&s;&s;ent, thirdly, becau&s;e, if it were practicable to govern &s;o exten&s;ive a territory as the&s;e United States in|clude, on the plan of a con&s;olidated government, con|&s;i&s;tent with the principles of liberty and the happine&s;s
<PB N="19" REF="021344_0019_0FB31F1CDC23EB20">
of the people, yet the con&s;truction of this con&s;titution is not calculated to attain the object; for, independent of the nature of the ca&s;e, it would of it&s;elf, nece&s;&s;arily produce a de&s;poti&s;m, and that not by the u&s;ual grada|tions, but with the celerity that has hitherto only at|tended revolutions effected by the &s;word.</P>
<P>To e&s;tabli&s;h the truth of this po&s;ition, a cur&s;ory inve&s;|tigation of the principles and form of this con&s;titution will &s;uffice.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t con&s;ideration that this review &s;ugge&s;ts, is the omi&s;&s;ion of a bill of rights, a&s;certaining and fundamen|tally e&s;tabli&s;hing tho&s;e inalienable and per&s;onal rights of men, without the full, free, and &s;ecure enjoyment of which, there can be no liberty, and over which it is not nece&s;&s;ary for a good government to have the controul. The principal of which are, the rights of con&s;cience, per&s;onal liberty, by the clear and unequivocal e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the writ of habeas corpus, jury trial in criminal and civil ca&s;es, by an impartial jury of the vicinage or county, with the common law proceedings, for the &s;afe|ty of the accu&s;ed in criminal pro&s;ecutions, and the liber|ty of the pre&s;s, that &s;courge of tyrants, and the grand bulwark of every other liberty and privilege. The &s;ti|pulations heretofore made in favour of them, in the &s;tate con&s;titutions, are entirely &s;uper&s;eded by this con|&s;titution.</P>
<P>The legi&s;lature of a free country &s;hould be &s;o formed as to have a competent knowledge of its con&s;tituents, and enjoy their confidence. To produce the&s;e e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ites, the repre&s;entation ought to be fair, equal, and &s;ufficiently numerous to po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame intere&s;ts, feel|ings, opinions, and views, which the people them&s;elves would po&s;&s;e&s;s, were they all a&s;&s;embled; and &s;o numerous as to prevent bribery and undue influence; and &s;o re|&s;pon&s;ible to the people by frequent and fair elections, as to prevent their neglecting or &s;acrificing the views and intere&s;ts of their con&s;tituents, to their own pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>We will now bring the legi&s;lature, under this con&s;ti|tution, to the te&s;t of the foregoing principles, which will demon&s;trate, that it is deficient in every e&s;&s;ential qua|lity of a ju&s;t and &s;afe repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives is to con&s;i&s;t of &s;ixty-fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e

members; that is, one for about every fifty thou&s;and inhabitants, to be cho&s;en every two years. Thirty-three members will form a quorum for doing bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;eventeen of the&s;e, being the majority, determine the &s;en&s;e of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;enate, the other con&s;tituent branch of the legi&s;|lature, con&s;i&s;ts of twenty-&s;ix members, being two from each &s;tate, appointed by their legi&s;latures every &s;ix years; fourteen &s;enators make a quorum; the majority of whom, eight, determines the &s;en&s;e of that body: except in judging on impeachments, or in making treaties, or in expelling a member, when two thirds of the &s;enators pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent, mu&s;t concur.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident is to have the controul over the enact|ing of laws, &s;o far as to make the concurrence of two thirds of the repre&s;entatives and &s;enators pre&s;ent nece&s;|&s;ary, if he &s;hould object to the laws.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that the liberties, happine&s;s, intere&s;ts, and great concerns of the whole United States, may be dependent upon the integrity, virtue, wi&s;dom, and know|ledge of twenty-five or twenty-&s;ix men. How inade|quate and un&s;afe a repre&s;entation! inadequate, becau&s;e the &s;en&s;e and views of three or four millions of people, diffu&s;ed over &s;o exten&s;ive a territory, compri&s;ing &s;uch va|rious climates, products, habits, intere&s;ts, and opinions, cannot be collected in &s;o &s;mall a body; and be&s;ides, it is not a fair and equal repre&s;entation of the people, even in proportion to its number: for the &s;malle&s;t &s;tate has as much weight in the &s;enate as the large&s;t; and from the &s;mallne&s;s of the number to be cho&s;en for both branches of the legi&s;lature; and from the mode of election and appointment, which is under the controul of Congre&s;s; and from the nature of the thing, men of the mo&s;t ele|vated rank in life, will alone be cho&s;en. The other orders in &s;ociety, &s;uch as farmers, traders, and mechanics, who all ought to have a competent number of their be&s;t in|formed then in the legi&s;lature, will be totally unrepre|&s;ented.</P>
<P>The repre&s;entation is un&s;afe, becau&s;e in the exerci&s;e of &s;uch great powers and tru&s;ts, it is &s;o expo&s;ed to cor|ruption and undue influence, by the gift of the numer|ous places of honour and emolument, at the di&s;po&s;al of

<P>The repre&s;entation is moreover inadequate and un|&s;afe, becau&s;e of the long terms for which it is appointed, and the mode of its appointment, by which Congre&s;s may not only controul the choice of the people, but may &s;o manage as to dive&s;t the people of this funda|mental right, and become &s;elf-elected.</P>
<P>The number of members in the hou&s;e of repre&s;enta|tives may be increa&s;ed to one for every thirty thou&s;and inhabitants. But when we con&s;ider, that this cannot be done without the con&s;ent of the &s;enate, who, from their &s;hare in the legi&s;lative, in the executive, and judi|cial departments, and permanency of appointment, will be the great efficient body in this government, and who&s;e weight and predominancy would be abridged by an increa&s;e of the repre&s;entatives, we are per&s;uaded that this is a circum&s;tance that cannot be expected. On the contrary, the number of repre&s;entatives will probably be continued at &s;ixty-five, although the population of the country may &s;well to treble what it now is; unle&s;s a revolution &s;hould effect a change.</P>
<P>We have before noticed the judicial power, as it would effect a con&s;olidation of the &s;tates into one go|vernment. We will now examine it, as it would affect the liberties and welfare of the people, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch a government were practicable and proper.</P>
<P>The judicial power, under the propo&s;ed con&s;titution, is founded on the well known principles of the civil law, by which the judge determines both on law and fact, and appeals are allowed from the inferior tribunals to the &s;uperior, upon the whole que&s;tion; &s;o that facts, as well as law, would be re-examined, and even new facts brought forward in the court of appeals; and to u&s;e the words of a very eminent civilian, "The cau&s;e is many times another thing before the court of appeals, than what it was at the time of the fir&s;t &s;entence."</P>
<P>That this mode of proceeding is the one which mu&s;t be adopted under this con&s;titution, is evident from the following circum&s;tances: Fir&s;t, that the trial by jury, which is the grand characteri&s;tic of the common law, is &s;ecured by the con&s;titution, only in criminal ca&s;es,
<PB N="22" REF="021344_0022_0FB31F2210B05AA8">
Secondly, that the appeal both from law and fact is expre&s;sly e&s;tabli&s;hed, which is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the principles of the common law, and trials by jury. The only mode in which an appeal from law and fact can be e&s;tabli&s;hed, is, by adopting the principles and practice of the civil law; unle&s;s the United States &s;hould be drawn into the ab&s;urdity of calling and &s;wearing juries, merely for the purpo&s;e of contradicting their ver|dicts, which would render juries contemptible, and wor&s;e than u&s;ele&s;s. Thirdly, that the courts to be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, would decide on all ca&s;es of law and equity, which is a well known characteri&s;tic of the civil law, and the&s;e courts would have conu&s;ance not only of the laws of the United States, and of treaties, and of ca&s;es af|fecting amba&s;&s;adors, but of all ca&s;es of admiralty and maritime juri&s;diction, which la&s;t are matters belonging exclu&s;ively to the civil law, in every nation in Chri&s;ten|dom.</P>
<P>Not to enlarge upon the lo&s;s of the invaluable right of trial by an unbia&s;&s;ed jury, &s;o dear to every friend of liberty, the mon&s;trous expence and inconveniencies of the mode of proceed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">g to be adopted, are &s;uch, as will prove intolerable to the people of this country. The lengthy proceedings of the civil law courts in the chan|cery of England, and in the courts of Scotland and France, are &s;uch, that few men of moderate fortunes can endure the expence of: the poor man mu&s;t, therefore, &s;ubmit to the wealthy. Length of pur&s;e will too often prevail again&s;t right and ju&s;tice. For in&s;tance, we are told by the learned judge Black&s;tone, that a que&s;tion only on the property of an ox, of the value of three guineas, originating under the civil law proceedings in Scotland, after many interlocutory orders and &s;entences below, was carried at length from the court of &s;e&s;&s;ions, the highe&s;t court in that part of Great-Britain, by way of appeal, to the hou&s;e of lords, where the que&s;tion of law and fact was finally determined. He adds, that no pique or &s;pirit could, in the court of king's bench, or common pleas, at We&s;tmin&s;ter, have given countenance to &s;uch a cau&s;e for a tenth part of the time, nor co&s;t a twentieth part of the expence. Yet the co&s;ts, in the courts of king's bench, and common pleas, in England,
<PB N="23" REF="021344_0023_0FB31F2319F635B0">
are infinitely greater than tho&s;e which the people of this country have ever experienced.</P>
<P>We abhor the idea of lo&s;ing the tran&s;cendent privi|lege of trial by jury, with the lo&s;s of which, it is remark|ed by the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me learned author, that in Sweden the li|berties of the commons were extingui&s;hed by an ari&s;to|cratic &s;enate: and that trial by jury, and the liberty of the people, went out together. At the &s;ame time, we regret the intolerable delay, the enormous expences, and infinite vexation, to which the people of this country will be expo&s;ed, from the voluminous proceedings of the courts of civil law, and e&s;pecially from the appellate ju|ri&s;diction, by means of which, a man may be drawn from the utmo&s;t boundaries of this exten&s;ive country, to the &s;eat of the &s;upreme court of the nation, to contend, perhaps, with a wealthy and powerful adver&s;a|ry. The con&s;equence of this e&s;tabli&s;hment will be, an ab&s;olute confirmation of the power of ari&s;tocratical in|fluence in the courts of ju&s;tice: for the common people will not be able to contend or &s;truggle again&s;t it.</P>
<P><HI>Trial by jury, in criminal ca&s;es, may al&s;o be excluded, by declaring that the libeller, for in&s;tance, &s;hall be liable to an action of debt for a &s;pecified &s;um, thus evading the common law pro&s;ecution by indictment and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ial by jury. And the common cour&s;e of proceeding again&s;t a &s;hip for breach of revenue laws, by information (which will be cla&s;&s;ed among civil cau&s;es,) will, at the civil law, be cla&s;&s;ed within the re&s;ort of a court where no jury inter|venes. Be&s;ides, the benefit of jury trial in ca&s;es of a criminal nature, which cannot be evaded, will be render|ed of little value, by calling the accu&s;ed to an&s;wer far from home, there being no provi&s;ion that the trial be by a jury of the neighbourhood or country. Thus, an inhabi|tant of Pitt&s;burgh, on a charge of a crime committed on the banks of the Ohio, may be obliged to defend him&s;elf at the &s;ide of the Delaware, and &s;o vice ver&s;a.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To conclude this head: we ob&s;erve, that the judges of the courts of Congre&s;s would not be independent, as they are not debarred from holding other offices, during the plea&s;ure of the pre&s;ident and &s;enate, and as they may de|rive their &s;upport, in part, from fees, alterable by the le|gi&s;lature.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="021344_0024_0FB31F2623082B90"><HI>The next con&s;ideration that the con&s;titution pre&s;ents, is the undue and dangerous mixture of the powers of govern|ment: the &s;ame body po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing legi&s;lative, executive, and judicial powers. The &s;enate is a con&s;tituent branch of the legi&s;lature; it has judicial power in judging on im|peachments, and in this ca&s;e unites in &s;ome mea&s;ure the characters of judge and party, as all the principal officers are appointed by the pre&s;ident-general, with the concur|rence of the &s;enate, and therefore they derive their offices in part from the &s;enate. This may bins the judgments of the &s;enators, and tend to &s;creen great delinquents f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> puni&s;hment. And the &s;enate has, moreover, various <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> great executive powers, viz. in concurrence with the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">+&s;ident-general, they form treaties with foreign nations, that they may controul and abrogate the con&s;titutions and laws of the &s;everal &s;tates. Indeed, there is no power, pri|vilege, or liberty of the &s;tate-governments, or of the people, but what may be affected by virtue of this power: for all treaties made by them, are to be the "&s;upreme law of the land, any thing in the con&s;titution or laws of any &s;tate notwith&s;tanding."</HI></P>
<P><HI>And this great power may be exerci&s;ed by the pre&s;ident and ten &s;enators, being two thirds of fourteen, which is a quorum of that body. What an inducement would this offer to the mini&s;ters of foreign powers to compa&s;s, by bribery, &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions as could not otherwi&s;e be obtain|ed? It is the unvaried u&s;age of all free &s;tates, whenever treaties interfere with the po&s;itive laws of the land, to make the intervention of the legi&s;lature nece&s;&s;ary to give them operation. This became nece&s;&s;ary, and was afforded by the parliament of Great-Britain, in con&s;equence o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the late commercial treaty between that kingdom and France. As the &s;enate judges on impeachments, who is to try the members of the &s;enate, for the abu&s;e of this power? And none of the great appointments to office can be made without the con&s;ent of the &s;enate.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Such various, exten&s;ive, and important powers, com|bined in one body of men, are incon&s;i&s;tent with all freedom. The celebrated Monte&s;quien tells us, that "when the le|gi&s;lative and executive powers are united in the &s;ame per&s;on, or in the &s;ame body of magi&s;trates, there can be no liberty, becau&s;e apprehen&s;ions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay ari&s;e, le&s;t the &s;ame
<PB N="25" REF="021344_0025_0FB31F278B7B7BD0">
monarch or &s;enate &s;hould enact tyrannical laws, or execute them in a tyrannical manner."</HI></P>
<P>Again, "there is no liberty, if the powers of judg|ing be not &s;eparated from the legi&s;lative and executive powers. Were it joined with the legi&s;lative, the life and liberty of the &s;ubject would be expo&s;ed to arbitrary con|troul: for the judge would then be legi&s;lator. Were it joined to the executive power, the judge might behave with all the violence of an oppre&s;&s;or. There would be an end of every thing, were the &s;ame man, or the &s;ame body of the nobles, or of the people, to exerci&s;e tho&s;e three powers; that of enacting laws; that of executing the public re&s;olutions; and that of judging the crimes or differences of individuals."</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident-general is dangerou&s;ly connected with the &s;enate. His coincidence with the views of the ruling junto in that body, is made e&s;&s;ential to his weight and importance in the government, which will de&s;troy all in|dependency and purity in the executive department; and having the power of pardoning, without the concur|rence of a council, he may &s;creen from puni&s;hment the mo&s;t trea&s;onable attempts that may be made on the li|berties of the people, when in&s;tigated by his coadjutors in the &s;enate. In&s;tead of this dangerous and improper mixture of the executive with the legi&s;lative and judi|cial, the &s;upreme executive powers ought to have been placed in the pre&s;ident, with a &s;mall independent coun|cil, made per&s;onally re&s;pon&s;ible for every appointment to office, or other act, by having their opinions recorded; and that without the concurrence of the majority of the quorum of this council, the pre&s;ident &s;hould not be capable of taking any &s;tep.</P>
<P>We have before con&s;idered internal taxation, as it would affect the de&s;truction of the &s;tate governments, and produce one con&s;olidated government. We will now con&s;ider that &s;ubject as it affects the per&s;onal con|cerns of the people.</P>
<P>The power of direct taxation applies to every indi|vidual: as Congre&s;s, under this new government, is expre&s;sly ve&s;ted with the authority of laying a capita|tion or poll-tax upon every per&s;on, to any amount. This is a tax, that, however oppre&s;&s;ive in its nature, and
<PB N="26" REF="021344_0026_0FB31F2AB45C4430">
unequal in its operation, is certain as to its produce, and &s;imple in its collection. It cannot be evaded, like the objects of impo&s;t or exci&s;e; and will be paid, be|cau&s;e all that a man hath, will he give for his head. This tax is &s;o congenial to the nature of de&s;poti&s;m, that it has ever been a favourite under &s;uch governments. Some of tho&s;e who were in the late general convention, from this &s;tate, have long laboured to introduce a poll|tax among us.</P>
<P>The power of direct taxation will further apply to every individual: as Congre&s;s may tax land, cattle, trades, occupations, &amp;c. to any amount; and every ob|ject of internal taxation is of that nature, that, however oppre&s;&s;ive, the people will have but this alternative, either to pay the tax, or let their property be taken, for all re&s;i&s;tence will be vain. The &s;tanding army and &s;e|lect militia would enforce the collection.</P>
<P>For the moderate exerci&s;e of this power, there is no controul left in the &s;tate-governments, whole interven|tion is de&s;troyed. No relief or redre&s;s of grievances can be extended, as heretofore, by them. There is not even a declaration of rights, to which the people may appeal for the vindication of their wrongs, in the courts of ju&s;tice. They mu&s;t, therefore, implicitly obey the mo&s;t arbitrary laws: as the wor&s;t of them will be pur|&s;uant to the principles and form of the con&s;titution: and that &s;tronge&s;t of all checks upon the conduct of ad|mini&s;tration, re&s;pon&s;ibility to the people, will not exi&s;t in this government. The permanency of the appoint|ments of &s;enators and repre&s;entatives, and the controul the Congre&s;s have over their election, will place them independent of the &s;entiments and re&s;entment of the people: and the admini&s;tration having a greater intere&s;t in the government, than in the community, there will be no con&s;ideration to re&s;train them from oppre&s;&s;ion and tyranny. In the government of this &s;tate, under the old confederation, the members of the legi&s;lature are taken from among the people: and their intere&s;ts and welfare are &s;o in&s;eparably connected with tho&s;e of their con&s;tituents, that they can derive no advantage from oppre&s;&s;ive laws and taxes: for they would &s;uffer in common with their fellow citizens; would partici|pate
<PB N="27" REF="021344_0027_0FB31F2C6C91D210">
in the burdens they impo&s;e on the community, as they mu&s;t return to the common level after a &s;hort period; and, notwith&s;tanding every exertion of influ|ence, every means of corruption, a nece&s;&s;ary rotation ex|cludes them from permanency in the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>This large &s;tate is to have but ten members in that Congre&s;s, which is to have the liberty, propert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and deare&s;t concerns of every individual in this va&s;t country, at ab&s;olute command: and even the&s;e ten per&s;ons, who are to be our only guardians&mdash;who are to &s;uper&s;ede the legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania&mdash;will not be of the choice of the people, nor amenable to them. From the mode of their election and appointment, they will con&s;i&s;t of the lordly and high minded&mdash;of men who will have no congenial feelings with the people, but a perfect indif|ference for, and contempt of them. They will con&s;i&s;t of tho&s;e harpies of power, that prey upon the very vitals&mdash;that riot on the mi&s;eries of the community.

To attain this, the majority of the deputies of the twelve other &s;tates in Congre&s;s mu&s;t be alike well di&s;po&s;ed&mdash;mu&s;t alike forego the &s;weets of power&mdash;and relinqui&s;h the pur&s;uits of ambition, which, from the nature of things, is not to be expected. If the people part with a re&s;pon&s;ible repre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">entation in the le|gi&s;lature, founded upon fair, certain, and frequent elections, they have nothing left they can call their own.

<P>THE con&s;titution, which I enclo&s;ed to the general a&s;&s;embly in a late official letter, appears without

my &s;ignature. This circum&s;tance, although trivial in its own nature, has been re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dered rather important to my|&s;elf at lea&s;t, by being mi&s;under&s;tood by &s;ome, and mi&s;|repre&s;ented by o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hers.&mdash;As I di&s;dain to conceal the rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ons for witholding my &s;ub&s;cription, I have always been, &s;till am, and ever &s;hall be, ready to proclaim them to the world. To the legi&s;lature, therefore, by whom I was deputed to the federal convention, I beg leave now to addre&s;s them: aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cting no indifference to pub|lic opinion, but re&s;olved not to court it by an unmanly &s;acrifice of my own judgment.</P>
<P>As this explanation with involve a &s;ummary, but ge|neral review of our federal &s;ituation, you will p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rdon me, I tru&s;t, although I &s;hould tran&s;gre&s;s the u&s;ual bounds of a letter.</P>
<P><HI>Before my departure for the convention, I believed, that the confederation was not &s;o emin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntly defective, as it had been &s;uppo&s;ed. But after I had entered into a free com|munication with tho&s;e who were be&s;t informed of the con|dition and intere&s;t of each &s;tate; after I had compared the intelligence derived from them, with the properties which ought to characteri&s;e the government of our union, I became per&s;uaded, that the confederation was di&s;titute of every energy, which a con&s;titution of the United States ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For the objects propo&s;ed by its in&s;titution were, that it &s;hould be a &s;hield again&s;t foreign ho&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lity, and a firm re|&s;ort again&s;t dome&s;tic commotion; that it &s;hould cheri&s;h trade, and promote the pro&s;perity of the &s;tates under its care.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But the&s;e are not among the attributes of our pre&s;ent union. Severe experience under the pre&s;&s;ure of war&mdash; a ruinous weakne&s;s manife&s;ted &s;ince the return of peace; and the contemplation of tho&s;e dangers, which darken the fu|ture pro&s;pect, have condemned the hope of grandeur and of &s;afety under the au&s;pices of the confederation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In the exigencies of war, indeed, the hi&s;tory of its ef|fects is but &s;hort; the final ratification having been de|layed until the beginning of the year</HI> 1781. <HI>But however &s;hort, this period is di&s;tingui&s;hed by melancholy te&s;timonies of its inability to maintain in harmony, the &s;ocial inter|cour&s;e of the &s;tates, to defend Congre&s;s again&s;t encroach|ments
<PB N="32" REF="021344_0032_0FB31F369A572DE8">
on their rights, and to obtain, by requi&s;itions, &s;up|plies to the federal trea&s;ury, or recruits to the federal ar|mies. I &s;hall not attempt an enumeration of the particu|lar in&s;tances; but leave to your own remembrance and the records of Congre&s;s, the &s;upport of the a&s;&s;ertions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In the &s;ea&s;on of peace too, not many years have elap&s;ed; and yet each of them has produced fatal examples of delin|quency, and &s;ometimes of pointed oppo&s;ition to federal du|ties. To the various remon&s;trances of Congre&s;s, I ap|peal, for a gloomy, but unexaggerated narrative of the in|juries which our faith, honor, and happine&s;s, have &s;u&s;tain|ed by the failure of the &s;tates.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But the&s;e evils are pa&s;t; and &s;ome may be led by an hone&s;t zeal to conclude that they cannot be repeated. Yes &s;ir, they will be repeated as long as the confederation ex|i&s;ts, and will bring with them other mi&s;chiefs, &s;pringing from the &s;ame &s;ource, which cannot be yet fore&s;een in their full array of terror.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If we examine the con&s;titution and laws of the &s;everal &s;tates, it is immediately di&s;covered that the law of nations is unprovided with &s;anctions in many ca&s;es, which deeply affect public dignity and public ju&s;tice. The letter however of the confederation does not permit Congre&s;s to remedy the&s;e defects, and &s;uch an authority, although evidently deducible from its &s;pirit, cannot, without violation of the &s;econd article, be a&s;&s;umed. Is it not a political phoenome|non, that the head of the confederacy &s;hould be doomed to be plunged into war, from its wretched impotency to check offences again&s;t this law; and &s;entenced to witne&s;s in un|avaling angui&s;h the infraction of their engagements to fo|reign &s;overeigns?</HI></P>
<P><HI>And yet this is not the only grievous point of weakne&s;s. After a war &s;hall be inevitable, the requi&s;itions of Congre&s;s for quotas of men or money, will again prove unproductive, and fallacious. Two cau&s;es will always con&s;pire to this baneful con&s;equence.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>No&punc; government can be &s;table, which hangs on hu|man inclination alone, unbia&s;&s;ed by the coercion; and</HI> 2, <HI>from the very connection between &s;tates bound to proportion|ate contributions, jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;picions naturally ari&s;e, which at lea&s;t chill the ardour, if they do not excite the murmurs of the whole. I do not forget indeed, that by
<PB N="33" REF="021344_0033_0FB31F380EF164C8">
one &s;udden impul&s;e our part of the American continent has been thrown into a military po&s;ture, and that in the earlier annals of the war, our armies marched to the field on the mere recommendations of Congre&s;s. But ought we to argue from a conte&s;t, thus &s;ignalized by the magnitude of its &s;take, that as often as a flame &s;hall be hereafter kindled, the &s;ame enthu&s;ia&s;m will fill our legions, or renew them, as they may be filled by lo&s;&s;es?</HI></P>
<P>If not, where &s;hall we find protection? Impre&s;&s;ions, like tho&s;e, which prevent a compliance with requi&s;itions of regular forces, will deprive the American republic of the &s;ervices of militia. But let us &s;uppo&s;e, that they are attainable, and acknowledge, as I always &s;hall, that they are the natural &s;upport of a free government. When it is remembered, that in their ab&s;ence agricul|ture mu&s;t langui&s;h; that they are not habituated to mi|litary expo&s;ures and the rigour of military di&s;cipline, and that the nece&s;&s;ity of holding in readine&s;s &s;ucce&s;&s;ive detachments, carries the expence far beyond that of en|li&s;tments&mdash;this re&s;ource ought to be adopted with caution.</P>
<P>As &s;trongly too am I per&s;uaded, that the requi&s;itions for money will not be more cordially received. For be&s;ides the di&s;tru&s;t, which would prevail with re&s;pect to them al&s;o; be&s;ides the opinion, entertained by each &s;tate of its own liberality and un&s;atisfied demands again&s;t the United States, there is another con&s;ideration, not le&s;s worthy of attention. The fir&s;t rule for determin|ing each quota the value of all lands granted or &s;ur|veyed, and of the buildings and improvements thereon. It is no longer doubted, that an equitable, uniform mode of e&s;timating that value, is impracticable; and there|fore twelve &s;tates have &s;ub&s;tituted the number of inha|bitants under certain limitations, as the &s;tandard acc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d|ing to which money is to be furni&s;hed. But under the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting articles of the union, the a&s;&s;ent of the thir|teenth &s;tate is nece&s;&s;ary, and has not yet been given. This does of it&s;elf le&s;&s;en the hope of procuring a reven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e for federal u&s;es; and the mi&s;carriage of the impo&s;t al|mo&s;t rivets our de&s;pondency.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the&s;e di&s;appointments, it would afford &s;ome con&s;olation, if when rebellion &s;hall threaten any &s;tate,
<PB N="34" REF="021344_0034_0FB31F39CC2C7098">
an ultimate a&s;ylum could be found under the wing of Congre&s;s. But it is at lea&s;t equivocal whether they can intrude forces into a &s;tate, rent a&s;under by civil di&s;cord, even with the pure&s;t &s;olicitude for our federal welfare, and on the mo&s;t urgent entreaties of the &s;tate it&s;elf. Nay the very allowance of this power would be pageantry alone, from the want of money and of men.</P>
<P>To the&s;e defects of congre&s;&s;ional power, the hi&s;tory of man has &s;ubjoined others, not le&s;s alarming. I earne&s;tly pray, that the recollection of common &s;uffer|ings, which terminated in common glory, may check the &s;allies of violence, and perpetuate mutual friend&s;hip between the &s;tates. But I cannot pre&s;ume, that we are &s;uperior to tho&s;e un&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions, which under like circum&s;tances have infe&s;ted more ancient nations. I cannot pre&s;ume, that through all time, in the daily mixture of American citizens with each other, in the conflicts for commercial advantages, in the di&s;contents which the neighbourhood of territory has been &s;een to engender in other quarters of the globe, and in the efforts of fac|tion and intrigue&mdash;thirteen di&s;tinct communities under no effective &s;uperintending controul (as the United States confe&s;&s;edly now are, notwith&s;tanding the bold terms of the confederation) will avoid a hatred to each other deep and deadly.</P>
<P>In the pro&s;ecution of this enquiry, we &s;hall find the general pro&s;perity to decline under a &s;y&s;tem thus un|nerved. No &s;ooner is the merchant prepared for fo|reign ports, with the trea&s;ures which this new world kindly offers to his acceptance, than it is announced to him, that they are &s;hut again&s;t American &s;hipping, or opened under oppre&s;&s;ive regulations. He urges Con|gre&s;s to a counter-policy, and is an&s;wered only by a condolance on the general misfortune. He is immedi|ately &s;truck with the conviction, that until exclu&s;ion &s;hall be oppo&s;ed to exclu&s;ion, and re&s;triction to re&s;triction, the American flag will be di&s;graced. For who can con|ceive, that thirteen legi&s;latures, viewing commerce un|der different regulations, and fancying them&s;elves di&s;|charged from every obligation to concede the &s;malle&s;t of their commercial advantages for the benefit of the whole, will be wrought into a concert of action and

defiance of every prejudice? Nor is this all: Let the great improvements be recounted, which have enriched and illu&s;trated Europe: Let it be noted, how few tho&s;e are, which will be ab&s;olutely denied to the United States, comprehending within their boundaries the choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ings of climate, &s;oil, and navigable waters; then let the mo&s;t &s;anguine patriot bani&s;h if he can, the mortifying belief, that all the&s;e mu&s;t &s;leep, until they &s;hall be rou&s;ed by the vigour of a national govern|ment.</P>
<P>I have not exemplified the preceding remarks by mi|nute details; becau&s;e they are evidently fortified by truth, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the United States of America. I &s;hall, therefore, no longer deplore the un|fitne&s;s of the confederation to &s;ecure our peace; but procced, with a truly unaffected di&s;tru&s;t of my own opinions, to examine what order of powers the govern|ment of the United States ought to enjoy? How they ought to be defended again&s;t encroachments? Whe|ther they can be interwoven in the confederation, with|out an alteration of its very e&s;&s;ence, or mu&s;t be lodged in new hands? Shewing at the &s;ame time the convul|&s;ions, which &s;eem to await us, from a di&s;&s;olution of the union or partial confederacies.</P>
<P>To mark the kind and degree of authority, which ought to be confided to the government of the United States, is no more than to rever&s;e the de&s;cription which I have already given, of the defects of the confede|ration.</P>
<P>From thence it will follow, that the operations of peace and war will be clogged without regular advances of money, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t the&s;e will be &s;low indeed, if depen|dent on &s;upplication alone. For what better name do requi&s;itions de&s;erve, which may be evaded or oppo&s;ed without the fear of coercion? But although coercion is an indi&s;pen&s;able ingredient, it ought not to be direct|ed again&s;t a &s;tate, as a &s;tate; it being impo&s;&s;ible to at|tempt it except by blockading the trade of the delin|quent, or carrying war into its bowels. Even if the&s;e violent &s;chemes were eligible, in other re&s;pects, both of them might perhaps be defeated by the &s;cantine&s;s of the public che&s;t; would be tardy in their complete ef|fect,
<PB N="36" REF="021344_0036_0FB31F3D91D300E8">
as the expence of the land and naval equipments mu&s;t be fir&s;t reimbur&s;ed; and might drive the pro&s;crib|ed &s;tate into the de&s;perate re&s;olve of inviting foreign al|liances. Again&s;t each of them lie &s;eparate unconquer|able objections. A blockade is not equally applicable to all the &s;tates, they being differently circum&s;tanced in commerce and in ports; nay, an excommunication form the privilege of the union would be vain, becau&s;e every regulation or prohibition may be ea&s;ily eluded under the rights of American citizen&s;hip, or of foreign nations. But how &s;hall we &s;peak of the intru&s;ion of troops? Shall we arm citizens again&s;t citizens, and habituate them to &s;hed kindred blood? Shall we ri&s;que the inflicting of wounds which will generate a rancour never to be &s;ub|dued? Would there be no room to fear, that an army accu&s;tomed to fight, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of authority, would &s;alute an Emperor of their own? Let us not bring the&s;e things into jeopardy. Let us rather &s;ub|&s;titute the &s;ame proce&s;s by which individuals are com|pelled to contribute to the government of their own &s;tates. In&s;tead of making requi&s;itions to the legi&s;latures it would appear more proper, that taxes &s;hould be im|po&s;ed by the federal head, under due modifications and guards; that the collectors &s;hould demand from the citizens their re&s;pective quotas, and be &s;upported as in the collection of ordinary taxes.</P>
<P>It follows too, that, as the general government will be re&s;pon&s;ible to foreign nations, it ought to be able to annul any offen&s;ive mea&s;ure, or enforce any public right. Perhaps among the topics on which they may be ag|grieved or complain, the commercial intercour&s;e, and the manner in which contracts are di&s;charged, may con|&s;titute the principal articles of clamour.</P>
<P>It follows too, that the general government ought to be the &s;upreme arbiter, for adju&s;ting every contention among the &s;tates. In all their connections, therefore, with each other, and particularly in commerce, which will probably create the greate&s;t di&s;cord, it ought to hold the reins.</P>
<P>It follows too, that the general government ought to protect each &s;tate again&s;t dome&s;tic as well as external violence.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="021344_0037_0FB31F3ED4517638">And la&s;tly, it follows, that through the general go|vernment alone, can we ever a&s;&s;ume the rank to which we are entitled by our re&s;ources and &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Should the people of America &s;urrender the&s;e powers, they can be paramount to the con&s;titutions and ordi|nary acts of legi&s;lation, only by being delegated by them. I do not pretend to affirm, but I venture to believe, that if the confederation had been &s;olemnly que&s;tioned in oppo&s;ition to our con&s;titution, or even to one of our laws, po&s;terior to it, it mu&s;t have given way. For never did it obtain a higher ratification, than a re&s;olution of a&s;&s;embly in the daily form.</P>
<P>This will be one &s;ecurity again&s;t encroachment. But another not le&s;s effectual is, to exclude the individual &s;tates from any agency in the national government, as far as it may be &s;afe, and their interpo&s;ition may not be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>But now, Sir, permit me to declare, that in my hum|ble judgment, the powers by which alone the ble&s;&s;ings of a general government can be accompli&s;hed, cannot be interwoven in the confederation, without a change in its very e&s;&s;ence, or, in other words, that the confedera|tion mu&s;t be thrown a&s;ide. This is almo&s;t demon&s;tra|ble, from the inefficacy of requi&s;itions, and from the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of converting them into acts of authority. My &s;uffrage, as a citizen, is al&s;o for additional powers. But to whom &s;hall we commit the&s;e acts of authority, the&s;e additional powers? To Congre&s;s? When I formerly lamented the defects in the juri&s;diction of Congre&s;s, I had no view to indicate any other opinion, than that the federal head ought not to be &s;o circum&s;cribed. For free as I am at all times to profe&s;s my reverence for that body, and the individuals who compo&s;e it, I am yet equally free to make known my aver&s;ion to repo&s;e &s;uch a tru&s;t in a tribunal &s;o con&s;tituted. My objections are not the vi&s;ions of theory, but the re&s;ult of my own ob&s;er|vations in America, and of the experience of others abroad. 1. The legi&s;lative and executive are concentred in the &s;ame per&s;ons. This, where real power exi&s;ts, mu&s;t even|tuate in tyranny. 2. The repre&s;entation of the &s;tates bears no proportion to their importance. This is an unrea&s;onable &s;ubjection of the will of the majority to
<PB N="38" REF="021344_0038_0FB31F404E1C51E8">
that of the minority. 3. The mode of election, and the liability <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f being recalled, may too often render the de|legates rather partizans of their own &s;tates than repre|&s;entatives of the Union. 4. Cabal and intrigue mu&s;t con&s;equently gain an a&s;cendency in a cour&s;e of years. 5. A &s;ingle hou&s;e of legi&s;lation, will &s;ometimes be pre|cipitate, perhaps pa&s;&s;ionate. 6. As long as &s;even &s;tates are required for the &s;malle&s;t, and nine for the greate&s;t votes, may not &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eign influence at &s;ome future day in|&s;inuate it&s;elf, &s;o as to interrupt every active exertion? 7. To crown the whole, it is &s;carce within the verge of po&s;&s;ibility, that &s;o numerous an a&s;&s;embly &s;hould acquire that &s;ecrecy, di&s;patch, and vigour, which ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the te&s;t of excellence in the executive department.</P>
<P>My inference from the&s;e facts and principles, is, that the new powers mu&s;t be depo&s;ited in a new body, grow|ing out of a con&s;olidation of the union, as far as the circum&s;tances of the &s;tates will allow. Perhaps, how|ever, &s;ome may mediate its di&s;&s;olution, and others, par|tial confederacies.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is an idea awful indeed, and irreconcileable with a very early, and hitherto uniform conviction, that without union, we mu&s;t be undone. For, before the voice of war was heard, the pul&s;e of the then colonies was tried, and &s;ound to beat in uni&s;on. The unremit|ted labour of our enemies was to divide, and the policy of every Congre&s;s, to bind us together. But in no ex|ample was this truth more clearly di&s;played, than in the prudence with which independence was unfolded to the &s;ight, and in the forbearance to declare it, until America almo&s;t unanimou&s;ly called for it. After we had thus launched into troubles, never before explored, and in the hour of heavy di&s;tre&s;s, the remembrance of our &s;ocial &s;trength, not only forbade de&s;pair, but drew from Congre&s;s the mo&s;t illu&s;trious repetition of their &s;ettled purpo&s;e to de&s;pi&s;e all terms, &s;hort of indepen|dence.</P>
<P>Behold, then, how &s;ucce&s;sful and glorious we have been, while we acted in fraternal concord. But let us di&s;card the illu&s;ion, that by this &s;ucce&s;s, and this glory, the cre&s;t of danger has irrecoverably fallen. Our go|vernments are yet too youthful to have acquired &s;ta|bility
<PB N="39" REF="021344_0039_0FB31F425330B458">
from habit. Our very quiet depends upon the duration of the union. Among the upright and intel|ligent, few can read without emotion the future <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate of the &s;tates, if &s;evered from each other. Then &s;hall we learn the full weight of foreign intrigue. Then &s;hall we hear of partitions of our country. If a prince, in|flamed by the lu&s;t of conque&s;t, &s;hould u&s;e one &s;tate as the in&s;trument of en&s;laving others&mdash;if every &s;tate is to be wearied by perpetual alarms, and compelled to main|tain large military e&s;tabli&s;hments&mdash;if all que&s;tions are to be decided by an appeal to arms, where a difference of opinion cannot be removed by negociation&mdash;in a word, if all the direful misfortunes which haunt the peace of rival nations, are to triumph over the land, for what have we to contend? why have we exhau&s;ted our wealth? why have we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ely betrayed the heroic martyrs of the federal cau&s;e?</P>
<P>But dreadful as the total di&s;&s;olution of the union is to my mind, I entertain no le&s;s horror at the thought of partial confederacies. I have not the lea&s;t ground for &s;uppo&s;ing, that an overture of this kind would be li&s;tened to by a &s;ingle &s;tate, and the pre&s;umption is, that the politics of the greater part of the &s;tates, flow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rom the warme&s;t attachment to an union of the whole. If, however, a le&s;&s;er confederacy could be obtained by Virginia, let me conjure my countrymen, well to weigh the probable con&s;equences, before they attempt to form it.</P>
<P>On &s;uch an event, the &s;trength of the union would be divided in two, or perhaps three parts. Has it &s;o increa&s;ed &s;ince the war as to be divi&s;ible&mdash;and yet re|main &s;ufficient for our happine&s;s?</P>
<P>The utmo&s;t limit of any partial confederacy, which Virginia could expect to form, would comprehend the three &s;outhern &s;tates, and her nearne&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> neigh|bour. But they, like our&s;elves, are dimin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> in their real force, by the mixture of an unhappy &s;pecies of po|pulation.</P>
<P>Again may I a&s;k, whether the oppul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce of the United States has been augmented &s;ince the wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">? This is an&s;wered in the negative, by a load of debt, and the declen&s;ion of trade.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="021344_0040_0FB31F43589ACC30">At all times mu&s;t a &s;outhern confederacy &s;upport &s;hips of war, and &s;oldiery? As &s;oon would a navy move from the fore&s;t, and an army &s;pring from the earth, as &s;uch a confederacy, indebted, impoveri&s;hed, in its com|merce, and de&s;titute of men, could, for &s;ome years at lea&s;t, provide an ample defence for it&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Let it not be forgotten, that nations, which can enforce their rights, have large claims again&s;t the United States, and that the creditor may in&s;i&s;t on payment from any of them. Which of them would probably be the victim? The mo&s;t productive, and the mo&s;t expo&s;ed. When vexe&s;t by re|pri&s;als or war, the &s;outhern &s;tates will &s;ue for alliance on this continent or beyond &s;ea. If for the former, the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of an union of the whole is decided; if for the lat|ter, America will, I fear, re-act the &s;cenes of confu&s;ion and blood&s;hed, exhibited among mo&s;t of tho&s;e nations, which have, too late, repented the folly of relying on auxilia|ries.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Two or more confederacies cannot but be competitors for power. The ancient friend&s;hip between the citizens of America, being thus cut off, bitterne&s;s and ho&s;tility will &s;ucceed in its place; in order to prepare again&s;t &s;urround|ing danger, we &s;hall be compelled to ve&s;t &s;ome where or other power approaching near to military government.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The annals of the world have abounded &s;o much with in&s;tances of a divided people being a prey to foreign in|fluence, that I &s;hall not re&s;train my apprehen&s;ions of it, &s;hould our union be torn a&s;under. The opportunity of in|&s;inuating it, will be multiplied in proportion to the parts into which we may be broken.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In &s;hort, Sir, I am fatigued with &s;ummoning up to my imagination the mi&s;eries which will harra&s;s the United States, if torn from each other, and which will not end until they are &s;uper&s;eded by fre&s;h mi&s;chiefs under the yoke of a tyrant.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I come, therefore, to the la&s;t, and perhaps only refuge in our difficulties, a con&s;olidation of the union, as far as cir|cum&s;tances will permit. To fulfil this de&s;irable object, the con&s;titution was framed by the federal convention. A quorum of eleven &s;tates, and the only member from a twelfth have &s;ub&s;cribed it; Mr Ma&s;on of Virginia, Mr. Gerry of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and my&s;elf having refu&s;ed to &s;ub|&s;cribe.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="021344_0041_0FB31F466E008CE0"><HI>Why I refu&s;ed, will, I hope, be &s;olved to the &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e who know me, by &s;aying, that a &s;en&s;e of duty com|manded me thus to act. It commanded me, Sir for believe me, that no event of my life ever occupied more of my reflection. To &s;ub&s;cribe, &s;eemed to offer no incon&s;iderable gratification, &s;ince it would have pre&s;ented me to the world as a fellow-labourer with the learned and zealous &s;tate&s;men of Ame|rica.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But it was far more intere&s;ting to my feelings, that I was about to differ from three of my colleagues, one of whom is to the honor of the country which he has &s;aved, embo&s;&s;omed in their affections, and can receive no prai&s;e from the highe&s;t de&s;ire of language; the other two of whom have been long e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">led among the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t lovers of the commonwealth; and the un&s;haken and intimate friend&s;hip of all of whom I have ever prized, and &s;till do prize, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s among the happie&s;t of all acqui&s;itions. I was no &s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nger to the reigning partiality for the members who compo&s;ed the convention, and had not the &s;malle&s;t doubt, that from this cau&s;e, and from the ardor for a reform of government, the fir&s;t applau&s;es at lea&s;t would be loud and profu&s;e. I &s;u&s;pected, too, that there was &s;omething in the human brea&s;t which for a time would be apt to con&s;true a temper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tere&s;s in politics, into an enmity to the union.

But the&s;e con&s;iderations, how &s;educing &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ver, were feeble opponents to the &s;ugge&s;tions of my con&s;cience. I was &s;ent to exerci&s;e my judgment, and to exerci&s;e it was my fixed determination; being in&s;tructed by even an im|perfect acquaintance with mankind, that &s;elf-approbation is the only true reward which a political career can be|&s;tow, and that popularity would have been but another name for perfidy, if to &s;ecure it, I had given up the freedom of thinking for my&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It would have been a peculiar plea&s;ure to me to have a&s;certained before I left Virginia, the temper and genius of my fellow citizens, con&s;idered relatively to a govern|ment, &s;o &s;ub&s;tantially differing from the confederation as that which is now &s;ubmitted. But this was, for many obvious rea&s;ons, impo&s;&s;ible; and I was thereby deprived of what I thought the nece&s;&s;ary guides.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="021344_0042_0FB31F4840B36D98"><HI>I &s;aw, however, that the confederation was tottering from its own weakne&s;s, and that the &s;itting of the conven|tion was a &s;ignal of its total in&s;ufficiency. I was therefore ready to a&s;&s;ent to a &s;cheme of government, which was pro|po&s;ed, and which went beyond the limits of the confedera|tion, believing, that without being too exten&s;ive it would h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve pre&s;erved our tranquility, until that temper and that genius &s;hould be collected.</HI></P>
<P>But when the plan which is now before the general a&s;&s;embly, was on its pa&s;&s;age through the convention, I moved, that the &s;tate conventions &s;hould be at liber|ty to amend, and that a &s;econd general convention &s;hould be holden, to di&s;cu&s;s the amendments, which &s;hould be &s;ugge&s;ted by them. This motion was in &s;ome mea&s;ure ju&s;tified by the manner in which the confederation was forwarded originally, by congre&s;s to the &s;tate legi&s;la|tures, in many of which amendments were propo&s;ed, and tho&s;e amendments were afterwards examined in Congre&s;s. Such a motion was doubly expedient here as the delegation of &s;o much more power was &s;ought for. But it was negatived. I then expre&s;&s;ed my un|willingne&s;s to &s;ign. My rea&s;ons were the following:</P>
<P N="1">1. It is &s;aid in the re&s;olutions which accompany the con&s;titution, that it is to be &s;ubmitted to a convention of delegates cho&s;en in each &s;tate by the people thereof, for their a&s;&s;ent and ratification. The meaning of the&s;e terms is allowed univer&s;ally to be, that the convention mu&s;t either adopt the con&s;titution in the whole, or reject it in the whole, and is po&s;itively forbidden to amend. If therefore, I had &s;igned, I &s;hould have felt my&s;elf bound to be &s;ilent as to amendments, and to endeavor to &s;up|port the con&s;titution without the correction of a letter. With this con&s;equence before my eyes, and with a de|termination to attempt an amendment, I was taught, by a regard for con&s;i&s;tency, not to &s;ign.</P>
<P N="2">2. My opinion always was, and &s;till is, that every citizen of America, let the cri&s;is be what it may, ought to have a full opportunity to propo&s;e, through his re|pre&s;entatives, any amendment which, in his apprehen|&s;ion, tends to the public welfare. By &s;igning, I &s;hould have contradicted this &s;entiment.</P>
<P N="3">3. A con&s;titution ought to have the hearts of the
<PB N="43" REF="021344_0043_0FB31F494CA58C80">
people on its &s;ide. But if at a future day it &s;hould be burthen&s;ome after having been adopted in the whole, and they &s;hould in&s;inuate that it was in &s;ome mea&s;ure forced upon them, by being confined to the &s;ingle al|ternative of taking or rejecting it altogether, under my impre&s;&s;ions, and with my opinions, I &s;hould not be able to ju&s;tify my&s;elf had I &s;igned.</P>
<P N="4">4. I was always &s;atisfied, as I have now experienced, that this great &s;ubject would be placed in new lights and attitudes by the critici&s;m of the world, and that no man can a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf how a con&s;titution will work for a cour&s;e of years, until at lea&s;t he &s;hall have heard the ob&s;ervations of the people at large. I al&s;o fear more from inaccuracies in a co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;titution, than from gro&s;s er|rors in any other compo&s;ition; becau&s;e our deare&s;t in|tere&s;ts are to be regulated by it; and power, if loo&s;ely given, e&s;pecially where it will be interpreted with great latitude, may bring &s;orrow in its execution. Had I &s;igned with the&s;e ideas, I &s;hould have virtually &s;hut my ears again&s;t the information which I ardently de&s;ired.</P>
<P N="5">5. I was afraid, that if the con&s;titution was to be &s;ubmitted to the people, to be wholly adopted or wholly rejected by them, they would not only reject it, but bid a la&s;ting farwel to the union. This formidable event I wi&s;hed to avert, by keeping my&s;elf free to propo&s;e amendmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and thus, if po&s;&s;ible, to remove the ob&s;ta|cles to an effectual government. But it will be a&s;ked, whether all the&s;e arguments were not well weighed in convention. They were, Sir, with great candor. Nay, when I called to mind the re&s;pectability of tho&s;e, with whom I was a&s;&s;ociated, I almo&s;t lo&s;t confidence in the&s;e principles. On other occa&s;ions, I &s;hould chearfully have yielded to a majority; on this, the &s;ate of thou&s;ands, yet unborn, enjoined me not to yield until I was con|vinced.</P>
<P>Again, may I be a&s;ked, why the mode pointed out in the con&s;titution for its amendment, may not be a &s;uffici|ent &s;ecurity again&s;t its imperfections, without now arre&s;t|ing it in its progre&s;s? My an&s;wers are, 1. That it is better to amend, while we have the con&s;titution in our power, while the pa&s;&s;ions of de&s;igning men are not yet enlifted, and while a bare majority of the &s;tates may
<PB N="44" REF="021344_0044_0FB31F4E67310908">
amend, than to wait for the uncertain a&s;&s;ent of three fourths of the &s;tates. 2. That a bad feature in go|vernment, becomes more and more fixed every day. 3. That frequent changes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f a con&s;titution, even if practicable, ought not to be wi&s;hed, but avoided as much as po&s;&s;ible. And 4 That in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, it may be que&s;tionable, whether, after the particular advan|tages of its operation &s;hall be di&s;cerned, three fourths of the &s;tates can be induced to amend.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, that it is no ea&s;y ta&s;k, to devi&s;e a &s;cheme which &s;hall be &s;uitable to the views of all. Many ex|pedients have occured to me, but none of them appear le&s;s exceptionable than this; that if our convention &s;hould chu&s;e to amend, another federal convention be recommended: that in that federal convention the a|mendments propo&s;ed by this or any other &s;tate be di&s;cu&s;s|ed; and it incorporated in the con&s;titution or rejected, or if a proper number of the other &s;tates &s;hould be un|willing to accede to a &s;econd convention, the con&s;titu|tion be again laid before the &s;ame &s;tate conventions, which &s;hall again a&s;&s;emble on the &s;ummons of the exe|cutives, and it &s;hall be either wholly adopted, or wholly rejected, without a further power of amendment. I count &s;uch a delay as nothing, in compari&s;on with &s;o grand an object; e&s;pecially too as the privilege of amending mu&s;t terminate after the u&s;e of it once.</P>
<P>I &s;hould now conclude this letter, which is already too long, were it not incumbent on me, from having con|tended for amendments, to &s;et forth the particulars, which I conceive to require correction. I undertake this with reluctance: becau&s;e it is remote from my inten|tions to catch the prejudices or prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of any man. But as I mean only to manife&s;t that I have not been actuated by caprice, and now to explain every ob|jection at full length would be an immen&s;e labour, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with enumerating certain heads, in which the con&s;titution is mo&s;t repugnant to my wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t points are the equality of &s;uffrage in the &s;enate, and the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of commerce to a mere majority in the legi&s;lature, with no other check than the revi&s;ion of the pre&s;ident. I conjecture that neither of the&s;e things can be corrected; and particularly the
<PB N="45" REF="021344_0045_0FB31F538CF517C8">
former, without which we mu&s;t have ri&s;en perhaps in di&s;order.</P>
<P>But I am &s;anguine in hoping that in every other ju&s;t|ly obnoxious cau&s;e, Virginia will be &s;econded by a majority of the &s;tates. I hope that &s;he will be &s;econded, 1. In cau&s;ing all ambiguities of expre&s;&s;ion to be pre|ci&s;ely explained. 2. In rendering the pre&s;ident ineligi|ble after a given number of years. 3. In taking from him the power of nominating to the judiciary officers, or of filling up vacancies which there may happen dur|ing the rece&s;s of the &s;enate, by granting commi&s;&s;ions which &s;hall expire at the end of their next &s;e&s;&s;ions. 4. In taking from him the power of pardoning for trea&s;on at lea&s;t before conviction. 5. In drawing a line be|tween the powers of Congre&s;s and individual &s;tates; and in defining the former, &s;o as to leave no cla&s;hing of juri&s;dictions nor dangerous di&s;putes; and to prevent the one from being &s;wallowed up by the other, under cover of general words, and implication. 6. In abridg|ing the power of the &s;enate to make treaties &s;upreme laws of the land. 8. In incapacitating the Congre&s;s to determine their own &s;alaries. And 9. In limiting and defining the judicial power.</P>
<P>The proper remedy mu&s;t be con&s;igned to the wi&s;dom of the convention; and the final &s;tep which Virginia &s;hall pur&s;ue, if her overtures &s;hall be di&s;carded, mu&s;t al&s;o re&s;t with them.</P>
<P>You will excu&s;e me, Sir, for having been thus tedi|ous. My feelings and duty demanded this expo&s;ition; for through no other channel could I re&s;cue my omi&s;&s;ion to &s;ign from mi&s;repre&s;entation, and no more effectual way could I exhibit to the general a&s;&s;embly an unre|&s;erved hi&s;tory of my conduct.</P>

<P>The late convention have &s;ubmitted to your con&s;ider|ation a plan of a new federal government. The &s;ubject is highly intere&s;ting to your future welfare. Whether it be calculated to promote the great ends of civil &s;ocie|ty, viz. the happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of the communi|ty; it behoves you well to con&s;ider, uninfluenced by the authority of names. In&s;tead of that frenzy of enthu&s;ia&s;m, that has actuated the citizens of Penn&s;ylvania, in their approbation of the propo&s;ed plan, before it was po&s;&s;ible that it could be the re&s;ult of a rational inve&s;tigation in|to its principles: it ought to be di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately and de|liberately examined, and its own intrin&s;ic merit, the only criterion of your patronage. If ever free and unbia&s;&s;ed di&s;cu&s;&s;ion was proper or nece&s;&s;ary, it is on &s;uch an occa|&s;ion. All the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty and the deare&s;t privi|leges of freemen, are now at &s;take and dependent on your pre&s;ent conduct. Tho&s;e who are competent to the ta&s;k of developing the principles of governmnnt, ought to be encouraged to come forward, and thereby the better enable the people to make a proper judgment; for the &s;cience of government is &s;o ab&s;trute, that few are able to judge for them&s;elves, without &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance the people are too apt to yield an implicit a&s;&s;ent to the opi|nions of tho&s;e characters, who&s;e abilities are held in the highe&s;t e&s;teem, and to tho&s;e in who&s;e integrity and pa|trioti&s;m they can confide; not con&s;idering that the love of domination is generally in proportion to talents, a|bilities, and &s;uperior acquirements; and that the men of the greate&s;t purity of intention may be made in&s;truments of de&s;poti&s;m in the hands of the artful and de&s;igning. If it were not for the &s;tability and attachment which time and habit gives to forms of government, it would be in the power of the enlightened and a&s;piring few, if they &s;hould combine, at any time to de&s;troy the be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hments, and even make the people the in&s;truments of their own &s;ubjugation.</P>

that there exi&s;ts not that great reluctance to inno|vation, &s;o remarkable in old communities, which accords with rea&s;on, for the mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive mind cannot for&s;ee the full operation of material changes on civil polity; it is the genius of the common law to re&s;i&s;t innovation.</P>
<P><HI>The wealthy and ambitious, who in every community think they have a right to lord it over their fellow crea|tures, have availed them&s;elves, very &s;ucce&s;sfully, of this favourable di&s;po&s;ition; for the people thus un&s;ettled in their &s;entiments, have been prepared to accede to any extreme of government; all the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and difficulties they experi|ence, preceeding from various cau&s;es, have been a&s;cribed to the impotency of the pre&s;ent confederation, and thence they have been led to expect full relief from the adoption of the propo&s;ed &s;y&s;tem of government; and in the other event, immediate ruin an annihilation as a nation.

I would be very far from in&s;inuating, that the two illu&s;trious per&s;onages alluded to, have not the welfare of their country at heart; but that the un&s;u&s;pecting goodne&s;s and zeal of the one has been impo&s;ed on in a &s;ubject of which he mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;arily inexperienced, from his other arduous engagements; and that the weakne&s;s and inde|ci&s;ion attendant on old age, has been practi&s;ed on in the other.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I am fearful that the principles of government incul|cated in Mr. Adams's treati&s;e, and enforced in the nume|rous e&s;&s;ays and paragraphs in the new&s;papers, have mi&s;led &s;ome well de&s;igning members of the late convention. But it will appear in the &s;equel, that the con&s;truction of the propo&s;ed plan of government is infinitely more extrava|gant.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I have been anxiou&s;ly expecting that &s;ome enlightened patriot would, ere this, have taken up the pen to expo&s;e the &s;utility, and counteract the baneful tendency of &s;uch principles. Mr. Adams's</HI> fine qua non <HI>of a good govern|ment is three balancing powers, who&s;e repelling qualities
<PB N="49" REF="021344_0049_0FB31F5BC763B940">
are to produce an equilibrium of intere&s;ts, and thereby pro|mote the happine&s;s of the whole community. He a&s;&s;erts, that the admini&s;trators of every government, will ever be actuated by views of private intere&s;t and ambition, to the prejudice of the public good; that therefore the only effectu|al method to &s;ecure the rights of the people and promote their welfare, is to create an oppo&s;ition of intere&s;ts between the members of two di&s;tinct bodies, in the exerci&s;e of the powers of government, and balanced by tho&s;e of a third. This hypothe&s;is &s;uppo&s;es human wi&s;dom competent to the ta&s;k of in&s;tituting three co-equal orders in government, and a corre&s;ponding weight in the community to enable them re&s;pectively to exerci&s;e their &s;everal parts, and who&s;e views and intere&s;ts &s;hould be &s;o di&s;tinct as to prevent a coalition of any two of them for the de&s;truction of the third. Mr. Adams, although he has traced the con&s;titution of every form of government that ever exi&s;ted, as far as hi&s;to|ry affords materials, has not been able to adduce a &s;ingle in&s;tance of &s;uch a government; he indeed &s;ays, that the Briti&s;h con&s;titution is &s;uch in theory, but this is rather a confirmation that his principles are chimerical and not to be reduced to practice. If &s;uch an organization of power were practicable, how long would it continue? not a day, for there is &s;o great a di&s;parity in the talents, wi&s;dom, and indu&s;try of mankind, that the &s;cale would pre&s;ently prepon|derate to one or the other body, and with every acce&s;&s;ion of power the means of further increa&s;e would be greatly ex|tended. The &s;tate of &s;ociety in England is much more fa|vourable to &s;uch a &s;cheme of government than that of Ame|rica. There they have a powerful hereditary nobility, and real di&s;tinctions of rank and intere&s;ts; but even there, for want of that perfect equality of power and di&s;tinction of intere&s;ts, in the three orders of government, they exi&s;t but in name; the only operative and efficient check, upon the conduct of admini&s;tration, is the &s;en&s;e of the people at large.</HI></P>
<P>Suppo&s;e a government could be formed and &s;upport|ed on &s;uch principles, would it an&s;wer the great pur|po&s;es of civil &s;ociety? if the admini&s;trators of every go|vernment are actuated by views of private intere&s;ts and ambition, how is the welfare and happine&s;s of the com+munity to be the re&s;ult of &s;uch jarring adver&s;e intere&s;ts</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="021344_0050_0FB31F5F4B778FE8">Therefore, as different orders in government will not produce the good of the whole, we mu&s;t recur to other principles. I believe it will be found that the form of government, which holds tho&s;e intru&s;ted with power, in the greate&s;t re&s;pon&s;ibility to their con&s;tituents, the be&s;t calculated for freemen. A republican or free go|vernment, can only exi&s;t where the body of the people are virtuous, and where property is equally divided; in &s;uch a government the people are the &s;overeign, and their &s;en&s;e or opinion is the criterion of every public mea&s;ure; for when this cea&s;es to be the ca&s;e, the nature of the government is changed, and an ari&s;tocracy, mo|narchy, or de&s;poti&s;m will ri&s;e on its ruin. The high|e&s;t re&s;pon&s;ibility is to be attained, in a &s;imple &s;truction of government; for the great body of the people never &s;teadily attend to the operations of government, and for want of due information are liable to be impo&s;ed on.&mdash; If you complicate the plan by various orders, the people will be perplexed and divided in their &s;entiments about the &s;ource of abu&s;es or mi&s;conduct: &s;ome will impute it to the &s;enate, others to the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, and &s;o on, that the interpo&s;ition of the people may be rendered imperfect or perhaps wholly abortive. But if, imitating the con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania, you ve&s;t all the legi&s;lative power in one body of men (&s;eparating the executive and judicial) elected for a &s;hort period, and ne|ce&s;&s;arily excluded by rotation from permanency, and guarded from precipitancy and &s;urpri&s;e by delays im|po&s;ed on its proceedings, you will create the mo&s;t per|fect re&s;pon&s;ibility, for then, whenever the people feel a grievance, they cannot mi&s;take the authors, and will ap|ply the remedy with certainty and effect, di&s;cardin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them at the next election.

<P>Having premi&s;ed thus much, I &s;hall now proceed to the examination of the propo&s;ed plan of government; and I tru&s;t &s;hall make it appear to the meane&s;t capacity, that it has none of the e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ites of a free go|vernment; that it is neither founded on tho&s;e ballancing re&s;training powers, recommended by Mr. Adams and attempted in the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of

<P>It will not be controverted that the legi&s;lative is the highe&s;t delegated power in government, and that all others are &s;ubordinate to i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

Now what can be more comprehen&s;ive than the&s;e words; not content by other &s;ections of this plan, to grant all the great executive powers of a confederation, and a <HI>&s;tanding army in time of peace,</HI> that grand engine of oppre&s;&s;ion, and moreover the ab&s;olute controul over the commerce of the United States, and all external objects of revenue, &s;uch as unlimited impo&s;ts upon imports, &amp;c. they are to be ve&s;ted with every &s;pecies of <HI>internal</HI> taxation: what|ever taxes, duties, and exci&s;es that they may deem re|qui&s;ite for the <HI>general welfare&punc;</HI> may be impo&s;ed on the citizens of the&s;e &s;tates, levied by the officer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Con|gre&s;s, di&s;tributed through every di&s;trict in America, and the collection would be enforced by the &s;tanding army, however grievous or improper they may be.

<P>The judicial power, by 1&s;t &s;ection of article 3d, &s;hall extend to all ca&s;es, in law, and equity, ari&s;ing under this con&s;titution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which &s;hall be made under their au|thority, and to all ca&s;es affecting amba&s;&s;adors, other public mini&s;ters, and con&s;uls; to all ca&s;es of admiralty

<P>The judicial power to be ve&s;ted in one &s;upreme court, and in &s;uch inferior courts as the Congre&s;s may from time to time ordain and e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>The objects of juri&s;diction recited above, are &s;o nu|merous, and the &s;hades of di&s;tinction between civil cau&s;es are oftentimes &s;o &s;light, that it is more than probable that the &s;tate judicatories would be wholly &s;uperceded; for in conte&s;ts about juri&s;diction, the federal court, as the mo&s;t powerful, would ever prevail. Every per&s;on acquainted with the hi&s;tory of the courts in England, knows by what ingenious &s;ophi&s;ms they have, at differ|ent periods, extended the &s;phere of their juri&s;diction over objects out of the line of their in&s;titution, and con|trary to their very nature, courts of a criminal juri&s;|diction obtaining cognizance in civil cau&s;es.</P>
<P>To put the omnipotency of Congre&s;s over the &s;tate government and judicatories out of all doubt, the 6th article ordains, that "this con&s;titution and the laws of the United States, which &s;hall be made in pur&s;uance thereof, and all treaties made or which &s;hall be made under the authority of the United States, &s;hall be the &s;upreme law of the land, and the judges in every &s;tate &s;hall be bound thereby, any thing in the con&s;titution or laws of any &s;tate to the contrary notwith&s;tand|ing."</P>

to remain, as a blind. By &s;ection 4th of the 1&s;t art.

<P>If the foregoing be a ju&s;t comment&mdash;if the United States are to be melted down into one empire, it be|comes you to con&s;ider whether &s;uch a government, however con&s;tructed, would be eligible in &s;o extended a territory; and whether it would be practicable, con|&s;i&s;tent with freedom? It is the opinion of the greate&s;t writers, that a very exten&s;ive country cannot be govern|ed on democratical principles, on any other plan, than a confederation of a number of &s;mall republics, po&s;&s;e&s;s|ing all the powers of internal government, but united in the management of their foreign and general con|cerns.</P>
<P>It would not be difficult to prove, that any thing &s;hort of de&s;poti&s;m, could not bind &s;o great a country under one government; and that whatever plan you might, at the fir&s;t &s;etting out, e&s;tabli&s;h, it would i&s;&s;ue in a de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>If one general government could be in&s;tituted, and maintained on principles of freedom, it would not be &s;o competent to attend to the various local concerns and wants of every particular di&s;trict; as well as the pecu|liar governments, who are near the &s;cene, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uperior means of information: be&s;ides, if the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the <HI>whole</HI> union is to be managed by one govern|ment, there would not be time. Do we not already &s;ee, that the inhabitants in a number of larger &s;tates, who are remote from the &s;eat of government, are loudly complaining of the inconveniencies and di&s;advantages they are &s;ubjected to, on this account, and that, to en|joy the comforts of local government, they are &s;eparat|ing into &s;maller divi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Having taken a review of the powers, I &s;hall now ex|amine
<PB N="54" REF="021344_0054_0FB31F6B5892BDB0">
the con&s;truction of the propo&s;ed general govern|ment.</P>
<P>Art. 1, &s;ect. 1. "All legi&s;lative powers herein grant|ed, &s;hall be ve&s;ted in a Congre&s;s of the United States, which &s;hall con&s;i&s;t of a &s;enate and hou&s;e of repre&s;enta|tives." By an other &s;ection, the pre&s;ident (the principal executive officer) has a conditional controul over their proceedings.</P>
<P>Sect. 2. "The hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives &s;hall be com|po&s;ed of members cho&s;en every &s;econd year, by the people of the &s;everal &s;tates. The number of repre&s;en|tatives &s;hall not exceed one for every 30,000 inhabi|tants.</P>
<P>The &s;enate, the other con&s;tituent branch of the legi&s;|lature, is formed by the legi&s;lature of each &s;tate, appoint|ing two &s;enators, for the term of &s;ix years.</P>
<P>The executive power, by Art. 2, &s;ect. 1, is to be ve&s;t|ed in a pre&s;ident of the United States of America, elect|ed for four years: &s;ection 2, gives him "power, by and with the con&s;ent of the &s;enate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the &s;enators pre&s;ent concur; and he &s;hall nominate, and by and with the advice and con|&s;ent of the &s;enate, &s;hall appoint amba&s;&s;adors, other pub|lic mini&s;ters and con&s;uls, judges of the &s;upreme court, and all other officers of the United States, who&s;e ap|pointments are not herein otherwi&s;e provided for, and which &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, &amp;c. And by another &s;ection he has the ab&s;olute power of granting reprieves and pardons for trea&s;on, and all other high crimes and mi&s;demeanors, except in ca&s;es of impeachment.</P>
<P>The foregoing is the outlines of the plan.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives are, on the part of the people, to balance the &s;enate, who I &s;uppo&s;e will be compo&s;ed of the <HI>better &s;ort,</HI> the <HI>well born,</HI> &amp;c. The number of the repre&s;entatives (being only one for every 30,000) appears to be too few, either to commu|nicate the requi&s;ite information, of the wants, local cir|cum&s;tances and &s;entiments of &s;o exten&s;ive an empire, or to prevent corruption and undue influence in the exer|ci&s;e of &s;uch great powers; the term for which they are to be cho&s;en, too long to pre&s;erve a due dependence and accountability to their con&s;tituents; and the mode and places of their election not &s;ufficiently a&s;certained;
<PB N="55" REF="021344_0055_0FB31F6E089B1C18">
for as Congre&s;s have the controul over both, they may govern the choice, by ordering the <HI>repre&s;entatives</HI> of a <HI>whole</HI> &s;tate to be <HI>elected</HI> in <HI>one</HI> place, and that too may be the mo&s;t <HI>inconvenient.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;enate, the great efficient body in this plan of go|vernment, is con&s;tituted on the mo&s;t unequal principles. The &s;malle&s;t &s;tate in the union has equal weight with the great &s;tates of Virginia, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, or Penn&s;yl|vania. The &s;enate, be&s;ides its legi&s;lative functions, has a very con&s;iderable &s;hare in the executive; none of the principal appointments to office can be made without its advice and con&s;ent. The term and mode of its ap|pointment, will lead to permanency; the members are cho&s;en for &s;ix years, the mode is under the controul of Congre&s;s, and as there is no exclu&s;ion by rotation, they may be continued for life, which from their exten&s;ive means of influence, would follow of cour&s;e. The pre&s;i|dent, who would be a mere pageant of &s;tate, unle&s;s he coincides with the views of the &s;enate, would either be|come the head of the ari&s;tocratic junto in that body, or its minion; be&s;ides, their influence being the mo&s;t pre|dominant, could the be&s;t &s;ecure his re-election to of|fice.</P>
<P>And from his power of granting pardons, he might &s;kreen from puni&s;hment the mo&s;t trea&s;onable attempts on the liberties of the people, when in&s;tigated by the &s;enate.</P>
<P>From this inve&s;tigation into the organization of this government, it appears, that it is devoid of all re&s;pon&s;i|bility or accountability to the great body of the people, and that &s;o far from being a regular balanced govern|ment, it would be, in practice, a <HI>permanent</HI> ARISTO|CRACY.</P>
<P><HI>The framers of it, actuated by the true &s;pirit of &s;uch a government, which ever abominates and &s;uppre&s;&s;es all free enquiry, and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, have made no provi&s;ion for the</HI> li|berty of the pre&s;s, <HI>that grand</HI> palladium of freedom, <HI>and</HI> &s;courge of tyrants; <HI>but ob&s;erved a total &s;ilence on that head.

<P><HI>The injunction of &s;ecrecy impo&s;ed on the members of the late Convention during their deliberation, was obviou&s;ly dictated by the genius of ari&s;tocracy; it was deemed im|politic to unfold the principles of the intended government to the people, as this would have fru&s;trated the object in view.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The projectors of the new plan, &s;uppo&s;ed that an ex par|te di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject, was more likely to obtain unani|mity in the Convention; which would give it &s;uch a &s;anction

<P><HI>The greate&s;t minds are forcibly impre&s;&s;ed by the immedi|ate circum&s;tances with which they are connected; the par|ticular &s;phere men move in, the prevailing &s;entiments of tho&s;e they conver&s;e with, have an in&s;en&s;ible and irre&s;i&s;tible influence on the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of mankind, &s;o that when we con&s;ider the abilities, talents, ingenuity, and con&s;um|mate addre&s;s of a number of the members of the late con|vention, who&s;e principles are de&s;potic, can we be &s;urpri&s;ed that men of the be&s;t intentions have been mi&s;led in the dif|ficult &s;cience of government?

His quibble upon the term <HI>cor|poration,</HI> as &s;ometimes equivalent to communities which po&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;overeignty, is unworthy of him. The &s;ame compari&s;on in the ca&s;e of the Briti&s;h parliament a&s;&s;um|ing to tax the colonies, is made in the Xth of the Far|mer's Letters, and was not mi&s;under&s;tood in 1768 by any. He &s;ays, that the exi&s;tence of the propo&s;ed federal plan depends on the exi&s;tence of the &s;tate governments, as the &s;enators are to be appointed by the &s;everal legi&s;la|tures, who are al&s;o to nominate the electors who choo&s;e the pre&s;ident of the United States; and that hence all fears of the &s;everal &s;tates being melted down into one empire, are groundle&s;s and imaginary. But who is &s;o dull as not to comprehend, that the <HI>&s;emblance</HI> and <HI>forms</HI> of an ancient e&s;tabli&s;hment, may rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in, after the <HI>reality</HI> is gone. <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> by the aid of a great army, a&s;&s;umed de&s;potic power, and notwith&s;tanding this, we find even under Tiberius, Caligula, and Nero, princes who di&s;|graced human nature by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir exce&s;&s;es, the &s;hadows of the ancient con&s;titution held up to amu&s;e the people. The &s;enate &s;at as formerly; con&s;uls, tribunes, of the peo|ple, cen&s;ors and other officers, were annually cho&s;en as before, and the forms of republican government con|tinued.

Every <HI>&s;enatus con&s;ultum</HI> was dictated by him or his mini&s;ters, and every Roman found him&s;elf con&s;trained to &s;ubmit in all things to the de&s;pot.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> a&s;ks, What controul can proceed from the federal government to &s;hackle or de&s;troy that <HI>&s;acred pal|ladium</HI> of national freedom, the <HI>liberty of the pre&s;s?</HI>" What? cannot Congre&s;s, when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the immen&s;e authority, propo&s;ed to be devolved, re&s;train the printers, and put them under regulation. Recollect that the omnipotence of the federal legi&s;lature over the &s;tate e&s;ta|bli&s;hments is recognized by a &s;pecial article, viz. "that this con&s;titution and the laws of the United States which &s;hall be made in pur&s;uance thereof, and all treaties made,
<PB N="61" REF="021344_0061_0FB31F79C9238DC8">
or which &s;hall be made, under the authority of the United States, &s;hall be the <HI>&s;upreme law</HI> of the land; and the judges in every &s;tate &s;hall be bound thereby, any thing in the <HI>con&s;titutions</HI> or laws of any &s;tate to the contrary notwith&s;tanding." After &s;uch a declaration, what &s;ecu|rity does the <HI>con&s;titutions</HI> of the &s;everal &s;tates afford for <HI>the liberty of the pre&s;s, and other invaluable per&s;onal rights,</HI> not provided for by the new plan? Does not this &s;weep|ing clau&s;e &s;ubject every thing to the controul of Congre&s;s?</P>
<P>In the plan of confederation of 1778, now exi&s;ting, it was thought proper by article the 2d, to declare, that "each &s;tate retains its &s;overeignty, freedom and inde|pendence, and every power, juri&s;diction and right, which is not by this confederation expre&s;sly delegated to the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled." <HI>Po&s;itive</HI> grant was not <HI>then</HI> thought &s;ufficiently de&s;criptive and re&s;train|ing upon Congre&s;s, and the omi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a declara|tion <HI>now,</HI> when &s;uch great devolutions of power are propo&s;ed, manife&s;ts the de&s;ign of reducing the &s;everal &s;tates to &s;hadows. But Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> tells you that every right and power not &s;pecially granted to Congre&s;s is con&s;idered as withheld. How does this appear? Is this principle e&s;tabli&s;hed by the proper authority? Has the convention made &s;uch a &s;tipulation? By no means. Quite the rever&s;e; the laws of Congre&s;s are to be "the <HI>&s;upreme law</HI> of the land, any thing in the <HI>con&s;titutions</HI> or laws of any &s;tate to the contrary notwith&s;tanding," and con&s;equently, would be <HI>paramount</HI> to all &s;tate au|thorities. The lu&s;t of power is &s;o univer&s;al, that a &s;pe|culative una&s;certained rule of con&s;truction would be a <HI>poor</HI> &s;ecurity for the liberties of the people.</P>
<P>Such a body as the intended Congre&s;s, unle&s;s parti|cularly inhibited and re&s;trained, mu&s;t gra&s;p at omnipo|tence, and before long &s;wallow up the legi&s;lative, the executive, and the judicial powers of the &s;everal &s;tates.</P>
<P>In addition to the re&s;pectable authorities quoted in my fir&s;t number, to &s;hew that the right of <HI>taxation</HI> in|cludes all the powers of government, I beg leave to ad|duce the Farmer's Letters, &s;ee particularly letter 9th, in which Mr. Dicken&s;on has clearly proved, that if the Briti&s;h parliament a&s;&s;umed the power of taxing the co|lonies, <HI>internally,</HI> as well as <HI>externally,</HI> and it &s;hould be
<PB N="62" REF="021344_0062_0FB31F7AC9A17058">
&s;ubmitted to, the &s;everal colony legi&s;latures would &s;oon become contemptible, and before long fall into di&s;u&s;e. Nothing, &s;ays he, would be left for them to do, higher than to frame bye-laws for empounding of cattle, or the yoking of hogs.</P>
<P>By the propo&s;ed plan, there are divers ca&s;es of judi|cial authority to be given to the courts of the United States, be&s;ides the two mentioned by Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on.</HI> In maritime cau&s;es about property, jury trial has not been u&s;ual; but in &s;uits in <HI>equity,</HI> with all due deference to Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on's</HI> profe&s;&s;ional abilities (which he calls to his aid) jury trial, as to facts, is in full exerci&s;e. Will this ju|ri&s;peritus &s;ay, that if the que&s;tion in equity &s;hould be, did <HI>John Doe</HI> make a will, that the chancellor of England would decide upon it? He well knows, that in this ca&s;e, there being no mode of jury trial before the chancellor, the que&s;tion would be referred to the court of king's bench for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion according to the common law, and when the judge in equity &s;hould receive the verdict, the fact &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed, could never be re-examined or controverted. Maritime cau&s;es, and tho&s;e appertaining to a court of equity, are, however, but <HI>two</HI> of the many and exten|&s;ive &s;ubjects of federal cognizance mentioned in the plan. This juri&s;diction will embrace all &s;uits ari&s;ing under the laws of impo&s;t, exci&s;e, and other revenue of the United States. In England, if goods be &s;eized, if a &s;hip be pro&s;ecuted for non-compliance with, or breach of the laws of the cu&s;toms, or tho&s;e for regulating trade, in the court of exchequer, the claimant is &s;ecured of the tran&s;cendant privilege of Engli&s;hmen, <HI>trial by a jury of his peers.</HI> Why not in the United States of America? This juri&s;diction al&s;o goes to all ca&s;es under the laws of the United States, that is to &s;ay, under all &s;tatutes and ordinances of Congre&s;s. How far this may extend, it is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee; for upon the decay of the &s;tate pow|ers of legi&s;lation, in con&s;equence of the lo&s;s of the <HI>pur&s;e &s;trings,</HI> it will be found nece&s;&s;ary for the federal legi&s;la|ture to make laws upon every &s;ubject of legi&s;lation.&mdash; Hence the &s;tate courts of ju&s;tice, like the barony and hundred courts of England, will be eclip&s;ed, and gra|dually fall into di&s;u&s;e.</P>
<P>The juri&s;diction of the federal court goes, likewi&s;e, to
<PB N="63" REF="021344_0063_0FB31F865F2DAC98">
the laws to be created by treaties made by the pre&s;ident and &s;enate (a &s;pecies of legi&s;lation) with other nations; 'to all ca&s;es affecting foreign mini&s;ters and con&s;uls; to controver&s;ies wherein the United States &s;hall be a party; to controver&s;ies between citizens of different &s;tates," as when an inhabitant of <HI>New-York</HI> has a demand on an inhabitant of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey.</HI> This la&s;t is a very invidious juri&s;diction, implying an improper di&s;tru&s;t of the impar|tiality and ju&s;tice of the tribunals of the &s;tates. It will include all legal debates between foreigners in Britain or el&s;ewhere, and the people of this country. A rea|&s;on hath been a&s;&s;igned for it, viz. "That large tracts of land, in neighbouring &s;tates, are claimed under royal or other grants, di&s;puted by the &s;tates where the lands lie, &s;o that ju&s;tice cannot be expected from the &s;tate tribu|nals." Suppo&s;e it were proper indeed to provide for &s;uch ca&s;e, why include all ca&s;es, and for all time to come? Demands as to lands for 21 years would have &s;atisfied this. A London merchant &s;hall come to Ame|rica, and &s;ue for his &s;uppo&s;ed debt, and the citizen of this country &s;hall be deprived of jury trial, and &s;ubjected to an appeal (though nothing but the <HI>fact</HI> is di&s;puted) to a court 500 or 1000 miles from home; when if this American has a claim upon an inhabitant of England, his adver&s;ary is &s;ecured of the privilege of jury trial. This juri&s;diction goes al&s;o to controver&s;ies between any &s;tate and its citizens, which though probably not intend|ed, may hereafter be &s;et up as a ground to dive&s;t the &s;tates, &s;everally, of the trial of criminals; ina&s;much as every charge of felony and mi&s;demeanour, is a contro|ver&s;y between a &s;tate and the citizens of the &s;ame: that is to &s;ay, the &s;tate is plaintiff, and the party accu&s;ed is defendant in the pro&s;ecution. In all debts about juri&s;|prudence, as was ob&s;erved before, the paramount courts of Congre&s;s will decide, and the judges of the &s;tate, be|ing <HI>&s;ub graviore lege,</HI> under the paramount law, mu&s;t acquie&s;ce.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> &s;ays, that it would have been impractica|ble to have made a general rule for jury trial in the civil ca&s;es a&s;&s;igned to the federal judiciary, becau&s;e of the want of uniformity in the mode of jury trial as practi&s;ed by the &s;everal &s;tates. This objection proves
<PB N="64" REF="021344_0064_0FB31F8937BE7260">
too much, and therefore amounts to nothing. If it precludes the mode of common law in civil ca&s;es, it certainly does in criminal. Yet in the&s;e we are told, "the oppre&s;&s;ion of government is effectually barred, by declaring, that in all criminal ca&s;es <HI>trial by jury</HI> &s;hall be pre&s;erved." A&s;toni&s;hing, that provi&s;ion could not be made for a jury in civil controver&s;ies, of 12 men, who&s;e verdict &s;hould be unanimous, <HI>to be taken from the vicinage;</HI> a precaution which is omitted as to trial of crimes, which may be any where in the &s;tate within which they have been committed. So that an inhabi|tant of <HI>Kentucky</HI> may be tried for trea&s;on at <HI>Richmond.</HI></P>
<P>The abolition of jury trial in civil ca&s;es, is the more con&s;iderable, as at length the courts of Congre&s;s will &s;uper&s;ede the &s;tate courts, when &s;uch mode of trial will fall into di&s;u&s;e among the people of the United States.</P>
<P>The northern nations of the European continent, have all lo&s;t this invaluable privilege: <HI>Sweden,</HI> the la&s;t of them, by the artifices of the <HI>ari&s;tocratic</HI> &s;enate, which depre&s;&s;ed the king, and reduced the hou&s;e of commons to in&s;ignificance. But the nation, a few years ago, pre|ferring the ab&s;olute authority of a monarch to the <HI>vexa|tious</HI> domination of the <HI>well-born</HI> few, an end was &s;ud|denly put to their power</P>
<P>"The policy of this right of juries (&s;ays judge Black-&s;tone) to decide upon <HI>fact,</HI> is founded on this: that if the power of judging were entirely tru&s;ted with the ma|gi&s;trates, or any &s;elect body of men named by the exe|cutive authority, their deci&s;ions, in &s;pite of their own natural integrity, would have a bias towards tho&s;e of their own rank and dignity; for it is not to be expected, that the <HI>few</HI> &s;hould be attentive to the rights of the many. This, therefore, pre&s;erves in the hands of the people, that &s;hare which they ought to have in the ad|mini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, and prevents the encroachments of the more powerful and wealthy citizens."</P>
<P>The attempt of governor <HI>Colden,</HI> of New-York, be|fore the revolution, to re-examine the <HI>facts,</HI> and to re-con&s;ider the <HI>damages,</HI> in the ca&s;e of <HI>For&s;ey</HI> again&s;t <HI>Cun|ningham,</HI> produced, about the year 1764, a flame of pa|triotic and &s;ucce&s;sful oppo&s;ition, that will not be ea&s;ily forgotten</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="021344_0065_0FB31F8B00BED778">To manage the various and exten&s;ive judicial autho|rity, propo&s;ed to be ve&s;ted in Congre&s;s, there will be one or more inferior courts immediately requi&s;ite in each &s;tate; and laws and regulations mu&s;t be forthwith pro|vided to direct the judges; here is a wide door for in|convenience to enter. Contracts made under the acts of the &s;tates re&s;pectively, will come before courts acting under new laws and new modes of proceeding, not thought of when they were entered into. An inhabi|tant of Penn&s;ylvania, re&s;iding at Pittsburgh, finds the goods of his debtor, who re&s;ides in Virginia, within the reach of his attachment; but no writ can be had to authori&s;e the mar&s;hal, &s;heriff, or other officer of Con|gre&s;s to &s;eize the property about to be removed, nearer than 200 miles: &s;uppo&s;e that at Carli&s;le, for in&s;tance, &s;uch a writ may be had, mean while the object e&s;capes.

<P>Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> &s;kips very lightly over the danger appre|hended from the &s;tanding army allowed by the new plan. This grand machine of power and oppre&s;&s;ion may be made a fatal in&s;trument to overturn the public liberties, e&s;pecially as the funds to &s;upport the troops may be granted for <HI>two</HI> years, whereas in Britain, the grants ever &s;ince the revolution in 1688, have been <HI>from year to year.</HI> A &s;tanding army with regular pro|vi&s;ion of pay and contingencies, would afford a &s;trong temptation to &s;ome ambitious man to &s;tep up into the throne, and to &s;eize ab&s;olute power.

of a &s;tanding army. They are a mere occa&s;ional ar|mament for the purpo&s;e of re&s;training divers ho&s;tile tribes of &s;avages. It is contended, that under the pre|&s;ent confederation, Congre&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of rai&s;|ing armies at plea&s;ure; but the opportunity which the &s;tates &s;everally have of withholding the &s;upplies nece&s;|&s;ary to keep the&s;e armies on foot, is a &s;ufficient check on the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> a&s;&s;erts, that never was charge made with le&s;s rea&s;on, than that which predicts the in&s;titution of a <HI>baneful ari&s;tocracy</HI> in the federal &s;enate. In my fir&s;t number, I &s;tated, that this body would be a very un|equal repre&s;entation of the &s;everal &s;tates, that the mem|bers being appointed for the long term of &s;ix years, and there being no exclu&s;ion by rotation, they might be continued for life, which would follow of cour&s;e from their exten&s;ive means of influence, and that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a con&s;iderable &s;hare in the <HI>executive</HI> as well as <HI>legi&s;lative,</HI> it would become a <HI>paramount ari&s;tocracy,</HI> and &s;wallow up the other orders in the government.</P>
<P>That the&s;e fears are not imaginary, a knowledge of the hi&s;tory of other nations, where the powers of go|vernment have been injudiciou&s;ly placed, will fully de|mon&s;trate. Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> &s;ays, "the &s;enate branches into two characters; the one legi&s;lative and the other execu|tive. In its legi&s;lative character it can effect no purpo&s;e without the co-operation of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, and in its executive character it can accompli&s;h no ob|ject without the concurrence of the pre&s;ident. Thus fettered, I do not know any act which the &s;enate can of it&s;elf perform, and &s;uch dependence nece&s;&s;arily precludes every idea of influence and &s;uperiority." This I con|fe&s;s is very &s;pecious, but experience demon&s;trates, that checks in government, unle&s;s accompanied with <HI>ade|quate</HI> power, and <HI>independently</HI> placed, prove <HI>merely no|minal,</HI> and will be <HI>inoperative.</HI> Is it probable, that the pre&s;ident of the United States, limited as he is in power, and dependent on the will of the &s;enate, in appointments to office, will either have the firmne&s;s or inclination to exerci&s;e his prerogative of a conditional controul upon the proceedings of that body, however injurious they may be to the public welfare: it will be his intere&s;t to

coincide with the views of the &s;enate, and thus become the head of the ari&s;tocratic junto. The king of England is a con&s;tituent part of the legi&s;lature, but although an hereditary monarch, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole executive power, including the unre&s;trained appointment to of|fices, and an immen&s;e revenue, enjoys but in <HI>name</HI> the prerogative of a negative upon the parliament. Even the king of England, circum&s;tanced as he is, has not dared to exerci&s;e it for near a century pa&s;t. The check of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives upon the &s;enate will likewi&s;e be rendered nugatory for want of due weight in the democratic branch, and from their con&s;titution, <HI>they</HI> may become &s;o <HI>independent</HI> of the <HI>people</HI> as to be indifferent of its intere&s;ts: nay, as Congre&s;s would have the controul over the mode and place of their election, by ordering the repre&s;entatives of a <HI>whole</HI> &s;tate to be elected at <HI>one</HI> place, and that too the mo&s;t <HI>incon|venient,</HI> the ruling power may govern the <HI>choice,</HI> and thus the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives may be compo&s;ed of the <HI>creatures</HI> of the &s;enate. Still the <HI>&s;emblance</HI> of checks, may remain, but without <HI>operation.</HI></P>
<P>This mixture of the legi&s;lative and executive more|over highly tends to corruption. The chief improve|ment in government, in modern times, has been the complete &s;eparation of the great di&s;tinctions of power; placing the <HI>legi&s;lative</HI> in different hands from tho&s;e which hold the <HI>executive;</HI> and again &s;evering the <HI>judi|cial</HI> part from the ordinary <HI>admini&s;trative.</HI> "When the legi&s;lative and executive powers (&s;ays Monte&s;quieu) are united in the &s;ame per&s;on, or in the &s;ame body of magi&s;trates, there can be no liberty."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> confe&s;&s;es him&s;elf nor &s;atisfied with the or|ganization of the federal &s;enate, and apologizes for it, by alledging a &s;ort of compromi&s;e. It is well known that &s;ome members of convention, apprized of the mi&s;|chiefs of &s;uch a compound of authority, propo&s;ed to a&s;|&s;ign the &s;upreme executive powers to the pre&s;ident and a &s;mall council, made per&s;onally re&s;pon&s;ible for every appointment to office, or other act by having their opin|ions recorded; and that without the concurrence of the majority of the quorum of this council, the pre&s;ident &s;hould not be capable of taking any &s;tep. Such a check
<PB N="68" REF="021344_0068_0FB31F9443A891B8">
upon the chief magi&s;trate would admirably &s;ecure the power of pardoning, now propo&s;ed to be exerci&s;ed by the pre&s;ident alone, from abu&s;e. For as it is placed, he may &s;helter the traitors whom he him&s;elf, or his co|adjutors in the &s;enate, have excited to plot again&s;t the liberties of the nation.</P>
<P>The delegation of the power of taxation to Congre&s;s as far as duties on imported commodities, has not been objected to. But to extend this to exci&s;es, and every &s;pecies to internal taxation, would nece&s;&s;arily require &s;o many ordinances of Congre&s;s, affecting the body of the people, as would perpetually interfere with the &s;tate laws and per&s;onal concerns of the people. This alone would directly tend to annihilate the particular govern|ments; for the people, fatigued with the operations of two ma&s;ters, would be apt to rid them&s;elves of the weak|er. But we are cautioned again&s;t being alarmed with imaginary evils, for Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> has predicted that the great revenue of the United States, will be rai&s;ed by im|po&s;t. Is there any ground for this? Will the impo&s;ts &s;upply the &s;ums nece&s;&s;ary to pay the intere&s;t and prin|cipal of the foreign loan, to defray the great additional expence of the new con&s;titution; for the policy of the new government will lead it to in&s;titute numerous and lucrative civil offices, to extend its influenee and pro|vide for the &s;warms of expectants, the people having in fact no controul upon their disbur&s;ements, and to af|ford pay and &s;upport the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;tanding army, that darling and long wi&s;hed for object of the <HI>well born</HI> of A|merica; and which, if we may judge from the principles of the intended government, will be no trifling e&s;tab|li&s;hment, for cantonments of troops in every di&s;trict of America, will be nece&s;&s;ary to compel the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the people to the arbitrary dictates of the ruling pow|ers? I &s;ay will the impo&s;t be adequate? By no means. To an&s;wer the&s;e there mu&s;t be exci&s;es and other indi|rect duties impo&s;ed, and as land taxes will operate too unequally to be agreeable to the wealthy ari&s;trocracy in the &s;enate who will be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the government, <HI>poll taxes</HI> will be &s;ub&s;tituted as provided for in the new plan for the doctrine then will be, <HI>that &s;laves ought to pay for wearing their heads.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="021344_0069_0FB31F95184EE680">As the taxes nece&s;&s;ary for the&s;e purpo&s;es, will drain your pockets of every penny, what is to become of that virtuous and meritorious cla&s;s of citizens the public creditors.

<P>From the foregoing illu&s;tration of the powers to be de|volved to Congre&s;s, it is evident that the general go|vernment would nece&s;&s;arily annihilate the particular governments, and that the &s;ecurity of the per&s;onal rights of the people by the &s;tate con&s;titutions is &s;uperceded and de&s;troyed; hence re&s;ults the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch &s;ecurity being provided for by a bill of rights to be in&s;erted in the new plan of federal government.

monopolies in trade or arts, other than to authors of books or inventors of u&s;eful arts, for a rea&s;onable time, ought not to be &s;uffered; that the right of the people to a&s;&s;emble peaceably for the purpo&s;e of con&s;ult|ing about public matters, and petitioning or remon|&s;trating to the federal legi&s;lature ought not to be pre|vented; that <HI>the liberty of the pre&s;s be holden &s;acred;</HI> that the people have a right to hold them&s;elves, their hou|&s;es, papers, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, free from &s;earch or &s;eized; and that therefore warrants, without oaths or affirmations fir&s;t made, affording a &s;ufficient foundation for them, and whereby any officer or me&s;&s;enger may be command|ed or required to &s;earch &s;u&s;pected places, or to &s;eize any per&s;on or his property, not particularly de&s;cribed, are contrary to that right and ought not to be grant|ed; and that &s;tanding armies in time of peace are dan|gerous to liberty, and ought not to be permitted but when ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; all which is omitted to be done in the propo&s;ed government.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> &s;ays, the new plan does not arrogate perfection, for it provides a mode of alteration and cor|rection, if found nece&s;&s;ary. This is one among the nu|merous deceptions attempted on this occa&s;ion. True there is a mode pre&s;cribed for this purpo&s;e. But it is barely po&s;&s;ible that amendments may be made. The fa&s;cination of power mu&s;t fir&s;t cea&s;e, the nature of man|kind undergo a revolution, that is not to be expected on this &s;ide of eternity. For to effect this (Art. 9.) it is provided, that if <HI>two thirds</HI> of both hou&s;es of the federal legi&s;lature &s;hall propo&s;e them; or when two thirds of the &s;everal &s;tates, by their legi&s;latures, &s;hall apply for them the federal a&s;&s;embly &s;hall call a convention for propo&s;ing amendments, which when ratified by three-fourths of the &s;tate legi&s;latures, or conventions, as Congre&s;s &s;hal &s;ee be&s;t, &s;hall controul and alter the propo&s;ed confede+ration. Does hi&s;tory abound with examples of a volun|tary relinqui&s;hment of power, however injurious to the community? No; it would require a general and &s;uc|ce&s;sful ri&s;ing of the people to effect any thing of this nature.&mdash;This provi&s;ion therefore is more &s;ound.</P>
<P>The oppo&s;ition of the new plan (&s;ays Mr. <HI>Wi&s;on</HI>) pro|ceeds from intere&s;ted men, viz. the officers of the &s;tate

governments. He had before denied that the propo&s;ed tranfer of powers to Congre&s;s would annihilate the &s;tate governments. But he here lays a&s;ide the ma&s;que and avows the fact. For, the truth of the charge again&s;t them mu&s;t entirely re&s;t on &s;uch con&s;equence of the new plan. For if the &s;tate e&s;tabli&s;hments are to remain un|impaired, why &s;hould officers, peculiarly connected with them, be intere&s;ted to oppo&s;e the adoption of the new plan. Except the collector of the impo&s;t, judge of the admiralty and the collector of exci&s;e (none of whom have been reckoned of the oppo&s;ition) they would other|wi&s;e have nothing to apprehend.

<P><HI>The oppo&s;ition is not &s;o partial and intere&s;ted as Mr.</HI> Wil&s;on <HI>a&s;&s;erts.

In every government, who&s;e object is the public welfare, the laws are &s;ubjected to repeated revi&s;ions, in &s;ome by different orders in the government, in others by an ap|peal to the judgments of the people, and deliberative forms of procedure. A knowledge of this, as well as of other &s;tates, will &s;hew, that if every in&s;tance where a law has been pa&s;&s;ed without the u&s;ual precautions, it has been productive of great inconvenience and evils, and frequently has not an&s;wered the end in view, a &s;up|plement becoming nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply its deficiencies.</P>

<P>THAT the pre&s;ent confederation is inadequate to the objects of the union, &s;eems to be univer&s;ally allowed. The only que&s;tion is, what additional powers are wanting to give due energy to the federal govern|ment? We &s;hould, however, be careful in forming our opinions on this &s;ubject, not to impute the temporary and extraordinary difficulties that have hitherto impeded the execution of the confederation, to defects in the &s;y&s;tem it&s;elf. Taxation is, in every government, a very delicate and difficult &s;ubject; hence it has been the policy of all wi&s;e &s;tate&s;men, as far as circum&s;tances permitted, to lead the people by &s;mall beginnings, and almo&s;t imper|ceptible degrees; into the habits of taxation; where the contrary conduct has been pur&s;ued, it has ever fail|ed of full &s;ucce&s;s, not unfrequently proving the ruin of the projectors.

of the public re&s;ources, by emitting hills of credit, and thus po&s;tponed the nece&s;&s;ity of taxation for &s;everal years; this means was pur&s;ued to a mo&s;t ruin|ous length: but about the year 1780 or 1781, it was wholly exhau&s;ted; commerce had been &s;u&s;pended for near &s;ix years; the hu&s;bandman, for want of a market, limited his crops to his own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; the frequent calls of the militia, and long continuance in actual &s;er|vice, the deva&s;tations of the enemy, the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of our own armies, the evils of the depreciation of the paper money, which fell chiefly upon the patriotic and virtu|ous part of the community, had all concurred to pro|duce great di&s;tre&s;s throughout America. In this &s;itua|tion of affairs, we &s;till had the &s;ame powerful enemy to contend with, who had even more numerous and better appointed armies in the field, than at any former time. Our allies were applied to in this exigence, but the pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance that we could procure from them, was &s;oon exhau&s;ted; the only re&s;ource now re|maining, was to obtain by direct taxation, the monies nece&s;&s;ary for our defence; the hi&s;tory of mankind does not furni&s;h a &s;imilar in&s;tance of an attempt to levy &s;uch enormous taxes at once, of a people &s;o wholly unpre|pared and u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inured to them&mdash;the lamp of &s;acred liber|ty mu&s;t indeed have burned with un&s;ullied lu&s;tre, every &s;ordid principle of the mind mu&s;t have been then extinct, when the people not only &s;ubmitted to the grievous im|po&s;itions, but chearfully exerted them&s;elves to comply with the calls of their country; their abilities, however, were not equal to furni&s;h the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ums&mdash;indeed the requi&s;ition of the year 1782, amounted to the whole income of their farms and other property, in|cluding the means of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; perhaps the &s;trained exertions of two years, would not have &s;ufficed to the di&s;charge of this requi&s;ition; to whom then, can we impute the difficulties of the people to a due compliance with the requi&s;itions of Congre&s;s to a de|fect in the confederation, for any government, however energetic, in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, would have experi|enced the &s;ame fate. If we review the proceedings of the &s;tates, we &s;hall find that they gave every &s;anction and authority to the requi&s;itions of Congre&s;s, that their

<P>It is a maxim, that a government ought to be cau|tious not to govern over much, for when the cord of power is drawn too tight, it generally proves its de&s;truc|tion; the impracticability of complying with the requi|&s;itions of Congre&s;s has le&s;&s;ened the &s;en&s;e of obligation and duty in the people, and thus weakened the ties of the union; the opinion of power in a free government is much more efficacious than the exerci&s;e of it; it re|quires the maturity of time and repeated practice to give it due energy and certainty to the operations of government, e&s;pecially to &s;uch as affect the pur&s;es of the people.</P>
<P>The thirteen Swi&s;s Cantons confederated by more ge|neral and weaker ties than the&s;e United States are by the pre&s;ent articles of confederation, have not experi|enced the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;trengthening their union by ve&s;t|ing their general diet with further or greater powers; this national body has only the management of their foreign concerns, and in ca&s;e of a war can onl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> call by requi&s;ition on the &s;everal Cantons for the nece&s;&s;ary &s;up|plies, who are &s;overeign and independent in every in|ternal and local exerci&s;e of government; and yet this rope of &s;and, as our confederation has been termed, which is &s;o &s;imilar to that, has held together for ages without any apparent chain.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded, that a due con&s;ideration will evince, that the pre&s;ent inefficacy of the requi&s;itions of Congre&s;s is not owing to a defect in the confederation, but the peculiar circum&s;tances of the times.</P>
<P>The wheels of the general government having been thus clogged, and the arrearages of taxes &s;till accumu|lating, it may be a&s;ked what pro&s;pect is there of the go|vernment re&s;uming its proper tone, unle&s;s more com|pul&s;ory powers are granted? To this it may be an&s;wer|ed, that the produce of impo&s;ts on commerce which all agree to ve&s;t in Congre&s;s, together with the immen&s;e tracts of land at their di&s;po&s;al, will rapidly le&s;&s;en and eventually di&s;charge the pre&s;ent incumbrances; when

<P>By the&s;e regulations too we were limited in markets for our produce, our ve&s;&s;els were excluded from their We&s;t-India i&s;lands, many of our &s;taple commodities were denied entrance in Britain; hence the hu&s;b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndmen were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the demand for their crops being le&s;|&s;ened, and their prices reduced. This is the &s;ource to which may be traced every evil we experience, that can be relieved by a more energetic government. Recollect the language of complaint for years pa&s;t, compare the recommendations of Congre&s;s founded on &s;uch com|plaints, pointing out the remedy; examine the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned by the different &s;tates for appointing delegates to the late convention, view the powers ve&s;ted in that body; they all harmonize in one &s;entiment, that the due regulation of trade and navigation was the anxious wi&s;h of every cla&s;s of citizens, was the great object of calling the convention.</P>

<P>MR. WILSON, in a &s;peech delivered in our con|vention on Saturday the 24th in&s;tant, has con|ceded, nay forceably proved, that one con&s;olidated go|vernment will not an&s;wer for &s;o exten&s;ive a territory as the United States includes, that &s;lavery would be the

nece&s;&s;ary fate of the people under &s;uch a government<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, his words are &s;o remarkable, that I cannot forbear re|citing them; they are as follows, viz. "The extent of country for which the new con&s;titution was required, produced another difficulty in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the federal convention. It is the opinion of &s;ome celebrated wri|ters, that to a &s;mall territory, the democratical, to a middling territory, as Monte&s;quien has termed it, the monarchical, and, to an exten&s;ive territory, the de&s;potic form of government is the be&s;t adapted. Regarding, then, the wide and almo&s;t unbounded juri&s;diction of the States, at fir&s;t view the hand of de&s;poti&s;m &s;eemed ne|ce&s;&s;ary to controul, connect, and protect it; and hence the chief embarra&s;&s;ment aro&s;e. For, we knew, that al|though our con&s;tituents would chearfu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly &s;ubmit to the legi&s;lative re&s;traints of a free government, they would &s;purn at every attempt to &s;hackle them with de&s;potic power." See page five of the printed &s;peech. And again in page &s;even, he &s;ays, "Is it probable, that the di&s;&s;olution of the &s;tate governments, and the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of one con&s;olidated empire, would be eligible in its nature, and &s;atisfactory to the people in its admini|&s;tration? I think not, as I have given rea&s;ons to &s;hew, that &s;o exten&s;ive a territory could not be governed, connected, and pre&s;erved, but by the &s;upremacy of de&s;|potic power. All the exertions of the mo&s;t potent em|perors of Rome, were not capable of keeping that em|pire together, which, in extent, was far inferior to the dominion of America."</P>
<P>This great point having been now confirmed by the conce&s;&s;ion of Mr Wil&s;on, though indeed it was &s;elf evident before, and the writers again&s;t the propo&s;ed plan of government, having proved to demon&s;tration, that the powers propo&s;ed to be ve&s;ted in Congre&s;s, will nece&s;&s;arily annihilate and ab&s;orb the legi&s;latures and judiciaries, and produce from their wreck one con&s;oli|dated government, the que&s;tion is determined. Every man therefore who has the welfare of his country at heart, every man who values his own liberty and hap|pine&s;s, in &s;hort, every de&s;cription of per&s;ons, except tho&s;e a&s;piring de&s;pots who hope to benefit by the mi&s;ery and va&s;&s;alage of their countrymen, mu&s;t now concur in

The anniver&s;ary of this great e&s;cape from the fangs of de&s;poti&s;m, ought to be celebrated as long as liberty &s;hall continue to be dear to the citizens of Ame|rica.</P>
<P>I will repeat &s;ome of my principal arguments, and add &s;ome further remarks, on the &s;ubject of con&s;oli|dation.</P>
<P>The legi&s;lative is the highe&s;t delegated power in go|vernment; all other are &s;ubordinate to it. The cele|brated Monte&s;quie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tabli&s;hes it as a maxim, that legi&s;|lation nece&s;&s;arily follows the power of taxation. By the 8th <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ection of article the fir&s;t of the propo&s;ed go|vernm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t, "the Congre&s;s are to have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, impo&s;ts, and exci&s;es, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States." Now, what can be more comprehen&s;ive than the&s;e words? Every &s;pecies of taxation, whether external or internal, are included. Whatever taxes, duties, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d exci&s;es, that the Congre&s;s may deem nece&s;&s;ary to the general welfare, may be im|po&s;ed on the citizens of the&s;e &s;tates and levied by their officers. The Congre&s;s are to be the ab&s;olute judges of the propriety of &s;uch taxes, in &s;hort they may con&s;true every purpo&s;e for which the &s;tate legi&s;latures now lay taxes, to be for the general welfare, they may &s;eize up|on every &s;ource of taxation, and thus make it impractica|ble for the &s;tates to have the &s;malle&s;t revenue; and if a &s;tate &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ld pre&s;ume to impo&s;e a tax or exci&s;e, that would interfere with the federal tax or exci&s;e, Congre&s;s may &s;oon terminate the contention, by repealing the &s;tate law, by virtue of the following &s;ection; "To make all laws which &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other pow|ers ve&s;ted by this con&s;titution in the government of the United States, or in any department thereof." Indeed every law of the &s;tates may be controuled by this pow|er. The legi&s;lative power granted by the&s;e &s;ections, is &s;o unlimited in its nature, may be &s;o comprehen&s;ive and boundle&s;s in its exerci&s;e, that this alone would be amply &s;ufficient to carry the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> grace to the &s;tate go|vernments,
<PB N="92" REF="021344_0092_0FB31D6EEBE3DAE8">
to &s;wallow them up in the grand vortex of general empire. But the legi&s;lative has an able auxilia|ry in the judicial department, for a reference to my &s;econd number will &s;hew, that this may be made greatly in&s;trumental in effecting a con&s;olidation; as the federal judiciary would ab&s;orb all others. Le&s;t the foregoing powers &s;hould not &s;uffice to con&s;olidate the United States into one empire, the convention, as if determined to prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt, as if to prevent all cla&s;hing by the oppo&s;ition of &s;tate powers, as if to pre|clude all &s;truggle for &s;tate importance, as if to level all ob&s;tacles to the &s;upremacy of univer&s;al &s;way, which in &s;o exten&s;ive a territory would be an iron handed de&s;|poti&s;m, have ordained by article the 6th, <HI>"That this con&s;titution, and the laws of the United States, which &s;hall be made in pur&s;uance thereof, and all treaties made, or which &s;hall be made, under the authority of the United States, &s;hall be the &s;upreme law of the land; and the judges in every &s;tate &s;hall be bound thereby, any thing in the con&s;titution or laws of any &s;tate to the contrary not|with&s;tanding."</HI></P>
<P>The words, <HI>"pur&s;uant to the con&s;titution,"</HI> will be no re&s;triction to the authority of Congre&s;s; for the fore|going &s;ections give them unlimited legi&s;lation; their un|bounded power of taxation does alone include all others, as whoever has the pur&s;e &s;trings will have full dominion. But the convention has &s;uperadded another power, by which the Congre&s;s may &s;tamp with the &s;anc|tion of the con&s;titution every po&s;&s;ible law; it is contain|ed in the following clau&s;e: "To make all laws which &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers ve&s;ted by this con&s;titution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof." Whatever law Congre&s;s may deem nece&s;&s;ary and proper for carrying into execution any of the powers ve&s;ted in them, may be enacted; and by virtue of this clau&s;e, they may con|troul and abrogate any and every of the laws of the &s;tate governments, on the allegation that they inter|fere with the execution of any of their powers; and yet the&s;e laws will <HI>"be made in pur&s;uance of the con&s;ti|tution,"</HI> and of cour&s;e will <HI>"be the &s;upreme law of the

land, and the judges in every &s;tate &s;hall be bound thereby, any thing in the con&s;titution or laws of any &s;tate, to the contrary notwith&s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P>There is no re&s;ervation made in the whole of this plan in favour of the rights of the &s;eparate &s;tates. In the pre&s;ent plan of confederation made in the year 1778, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary by article the 2d to declare, that <HI>each &s;tate retains its &s;overeignty, freedom, and inde|pendence, and every power, juri&s;diction, and right, which is not by this confederation expre&s;sly delegated to the Unit|ed States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled.</HI> Po&s;itive grant was not thought &s;ufficiently de&s;criptive and re&s;trictive upon Con|gre&s;s, and the omi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a declaration now, when &s;uch great devolutions of power are propo&s;ed, manife&s;ts the de&s;ign of con&s;olidating the &s;tates.</P>
<P>What re&s;triction does Mr. Wil&s;on pretend there is in the new con&s;titution to the &s;upremacy of de&s;potic &s;way over the United States? What barrier does he a&s;&s;ign for the &s;ecurity of the &s;tate governments? Why truly a mere cobweb of a limit! By interpo&s;ing the &s;hield of what will become mere form, to check the reality of pow|er. He &s;ays, that the exi&s;tence of the &s;tate governments are e&s;&s;ential to the organization of Congre&s;s, that the former is made the nece&s;&s;ary ba&s;is of the latter, for the federal &s;enators and pre&s;ident are to be appointed by the &s;tate legi&s;latures; and that hence all fears of a con&s;oli|dation are groundle&s;s and imaginary. It mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, as rea&s;on and argument would have been foreign to the defence of the propo&s;ed plan of government, Mr. Wil&s;on has di&s;played much ingenuity on this occa&s;ion; he has involved the &s;ubject in all the mazes of &s;ophi&s;try, and by &s;ubtil di&s;tinctions he has e&s;tabli&s;hed principles and po&s;itions, that exi&s;t only in his own fertile imagina|tion. It is a &s;oleci&s;m in politics for two co-ordinate &s;o|vereignties to exi&s;t together; you mu&s;t &s;eparate the &s;phere of their juri&s;diction, or after running the race of dominion for &s;ome time, one would nece&s;&s;arily triumph over the other; but in the mean time the &s;ubjects of it would be harra&s;&s;ed with double impo&s;itions to &s;upport the contention; however, the &s;trife between Congre&s;s and the &s;tates could not be of long continuance, for the former has a deci&s;ive &s;uperiority in the out&s;et, and has
<PB N="94" REF="021344_0094_0FB31D7315DF26D0">
moreover the power by the very con&s;titution it&s;elf to terminate it when expedient.</P>
<P>As this nece&s;&s;ary connexion, as it has been termed, between the &s;tate governments and the general govern|ment, has been made a point of great magnitude by the advocates of the new plan, as it is the only ob&s;tacle alledged by them again&s;t a con&s;olidation, it ought to be well con&s;idered. It is declared by the propo&s;ed plan, that the federal &s;enators, and the electors who choo&s;e the pre&s;ident of the United States, &s;hall be appointed by the &s;tate legi&s;latures for the long period of &s;ix and four years re&s;pectively; how will this connexion prevent the &s;tate legi&s;latures being dive&s;ted of every important, eve|ry efficient power? may not they, will not they dwindle into mere boards of appointment, as has ever happened in other nations to public bodies, who in &s;imilar circum|&s;tances have been &s;o weak as to part with the e&s;&s;entials of power? does not hi&s;tory abound with &s;uch in&s;tances? And this may be the mighty amount of this in&s;eparable connexion which is &s;o much dwelt upon as the &s;ecurity of the &s;tate governments. Yet even this &s;hadow of a limit again&s;t con&s;olidation may be annihilated by the imperial fiat, without any violation of even the forms of the con&s;titution; &s;ection 4th of article 1&s;t has made a provi&s;ion for this, when the people are &s;ufficiently fa|tigued with the u&s;ele&s;s expence of maintaining the forms of departed power and &s;ecurity, and when they &s;hall pray to be relieved from the impo&s;ition. This &s;ection cannot be too often repeated, as it gives &s;uch a latitude to the de&s;igning, as it revokes every other part of the con&s;titution that may be tolerable, and as it may enable the admini&s;tration under it to complete the &s;y&s;tem of de&s;poti&s;m: It is in the following words, viz. "The times, places, and manner of holding elections for &s;ena|tors and repre&s;entatives, &s;hall be pre&s;cribed in each &s;tate by the legi&s;lature thereof; but the Congre&s;s may by law at any time make or alter &s;uch regulations, except as to the place of choo&s;ing &s;enators." The only appa|rant re&s;triction in this clau&s;e is, as to the place of ap|pointing &s;enators, but even this may be rendered of no avail; for as the Congre&s;s have the controul over the time of appointment of both &s;enators and repre&s;entatives,
<PB N="95" REF="021344_0095_0FB31D75CE0F9430">
they may, under the pretence of an apprehen&s;ion of in|va&s;ion, upon the pretence of the turbulence of what they may &s;tile a faction, and indeed pretences are never wanting to the de&s;igning, they may po&s;tpone the time of the election of the &s;enators and the repre&s;entatives from period to period to perpetuity: Thus they may, and if they may they certainly will, from the lu&s;t of do|minion &s;o inherent in the mind of man, relieve the peo|ple from the trouble of attending elections by conde|&s;cending to create them&s;elves. Has not Mr. Wil&s;on a|vowed it in fact?

<P>The advocates of the propo&s;ed government mu&s;t be hard driven, when they repre&s;ent, that becau&s;e the le|gi&s;latures of this and the other &s;tates have exceeded the due bounds of power, notwith&s;tanding every guard pro|vided by their con&s;titutions; that becau&s;e the lu&s;t of ar|bitrary &s;way is &s;o powerful as &s;ometimes to get the bet|ter of every ob&s;tacle, that therefore we &s;hould give full &s;cope to it, for that all re&s;triction would be u&s;ele&s;s and nugatory. And further, when they tell you that a good admini&s;tration will atone for all the defects in the go|vernment, which, &s;ay they, you mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have; for how can it be otherwi&s;e, your rulers are to be taken from among your&s;elves. My fellow citizens, the&s;e a&s;|piring de&s;pots mu&s;t indeed have a great contempt for your under&s;tandings, when they hope to gull you out of your liberties by &s;uch rea&s;oning; for what is the pri|mary object of government, but to check and controul the ambitious and de&s;igning: How then can moderation and virtue be expected from men who will be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of ab&s;olute &s;way, who will have the United States at their di&s;po&s;al? They would be more than men who could re&s;i&s;t &s;uch temptation! Their being taken from among the people would be no &s;ecurity, tyrants are of native growth in all countries; the greate&s;t ba&s;haw in Turkey has been one of the people, as Mr. Wil&s;on tells

A golden phantom held out to them by the crafty and a&s;piring de&s;pots among them&s;elves, is alluring them into the &s;angs of arbitrary power; and &s;o great is their infatuation, that it &s;eems as if nothing &s;hort of the reality of mi&s;ery, nece&s;&s;arily attendant on &s;lavery, will rou&s;e them from their fal&s;e confidence, or convince them of the direful deception; but then, alas I it will be too late, the chains of de&s;poti&s;m will be fa&s;t rivetted, and all e&s;cape pre|cluded.</HI></P>

it is that lu&s;t of dominion that is inherent in every mind, in a greater or le&s;s degree; this is &s;o univer&s;al and ever active a pa&s;&s;ion as to influence all our ance&s;tors; the dif|ferent &s;ituation and qualifications of men only modifies and varies the complexion and operation of it.</P>
<P>For this darling pre-eminence and &s;uperiority, the merchant, already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a competency, adven|tures his all in the pur&s;uit of greater wealth; it is for this, that men of all de&s;criptions, after having ama&s;&s;ed fortunes, &s;till per&s;evere in the toils of labour; in &s;hort, this is the great principle of exertion in the votaries of riches, learning, and &s;ame.</P>
<P>In a &s;avage &s;tate, pre-eminence is the re&s;ult of bodily &s;trength and intrepidity, which compels &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion from all &s;uch as have the misfortune to be le&s;s able; there|fore the great end of civil government is, to protect the weak from the oppre&s;&s;ion of the powerful, to put every man upon the level of equal liberty; but here again the &s;ame lu&s;t of dominion by different means fru&s;trates al|mo&s;t always this &s;alutary intention. In a poli&s;hed &s;tate of &s;ociety, wealth, talents, addre&s;s and intrigue are the qualities that attain &s;uperiority in the great &s;phere of government.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;triking illu&s;tration of the prevalence of this lu&s;t of dominion is, that the mo&s;t &s;trenuous a&s;&s;ertors of liberty in all ages, after &s;ucce&s;sfully triumphing over tyranny, have them&s;elves become tyrants, when the un|&s;u&s;picious confidence of an admiring people have en|tru&s;ted them with unchecked power: Rare are the in|&s;tances of &s;elf-denial, or con&s;i&s;tency of conduct in the votaries of liberty, when they have become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the reins of authority; it has been the peculiar felicity of this country, that her <HI>great deliverer</HI> did not prove a <HI>Cromwell,</HI> nor a <HI>Monk.</HI></P>
<P>Compare the declarations of the mo&s;t zealous a&s;&s;ert|ors of religious liberty, whil&s;t under the la&s;h of per&s;ecu|tion, with their conduct when in power; you will find that even the benevolence and humility inculcated in the go&s;pels, prove no re&s;traint upon this love of domi|nation.

How tran&s;itory are the ble&s;&s;ings of this life! Scarcely have four years elap&s;|ed &s;ince the&s;e United States, re&s;cuced from the domi|nation of foreign de&s;pots, by the unexampled heroi&s;m

and per&s;everance of its citizens, at &s;uch great expence of blood and trea&s;ure, when they are about to fall a prey to the machinations of a profligate junto at home, who, &s;eizing the favourable moment, when the tempo|rary and extraordinary difficulties of the people have thrown them off their guard, and lulled that jealou&s;y of power &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ervation of freedom, have been too &s;ucce&s;sful in the &s;acrilegious attempt; however I am confident that this formidable con&s;piracy will end in the confu&s;ion and infamy of its authors; that, if ne|ce&s;&s;ary, the avenging &s;word of an abu&s;ed people will humble the&s;e a&s;piring de&s;pots to the du&s;t, and that their fate, like that of Charles the Fir&s;t of England, will de|ter &s;uch attempts in future, and prove the confirmation of the liberties of America until time &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>One would imagine, by the in&s;olent conduct of tho&s;e harpies of power, they had already triumphed over the liberties of the people; that the chains were rivetted, and tyranny e&s;tabli&s;hed. They tell us all farther oppo|&s;ition will be in vain, as this &s;tate has pa&s;&s;ed the Rubi|con. Do they imagine the freemen of Penn&s;ylvania will be thus trepanned out of their liberties; that they will &s;ubmit without a &s;truggle? They mu&s;t indeed be inebriated with the lu&s;t of dominion, to indulge &s;uch chimerical ideas. Will the act of one &s;ixth of the peo|ple, and this too, founded on deception and &s;urpri&s;e, bind the community. Is it thus that the altar of liberty &s;o recently crim&s;oned with the blood of our worthies, is it to be pro&s;trated, and de&s;poti&s;m reared on its ruins? Certainly not. The &s;olemn mummery that has been acting in the name of the people of Penn&s;ylvania, will be treated with the de&s;erved contempt, it has &s;erved, indeed, to expo&s;e the principles of the men concerned, and to draw a line of di&s;crimination between the real and affected patriots.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with an high opinion of the under&s;tanding and &s;pirit of my fellow citizens, I have in no &s;tage of this bu&s;ine&s;s entertained a doubt of its eventual defeat; the momentary delu&s;ion, ari&s;ing from an unre&s;erved confidence placed in &s;ome of the characters who&s;e names &s;anctioned this &s;cheme of power, did not di&s;courage me: I fore&s;aw that this blind admiration would di&s;cover it, native deformity.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="021344_0102_0FB31D85CE8A61B0">Already the enlightened pen of patrioti&s;m, aided by an able public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, has di&s;pelled the mi&s;t of de|ception, and the great body of the people are awaken|ed to a due &s;en&s;e of their danger, and are determined to a&s;&s;ert their liberty, if nece&s;&s;ary, by the &s;word, but this mean need not to be recurred to, for who are their enemies?

of arbitrary power, expands every faculty: as the field to fame and riches is open to all, it &s;timulates univer&s;al exertion and exhibits a lively picture of emulation, in|du&s;try and happine&s;s.

<P>But as it is by compari&s;on only, that men e&s;timate the value of any good, they are not &s;en&s;ible of the worth of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings they enjoy until they are deprived of them; hence, from ignorance of the horrors of &s;lavery, nations that have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that rare&s;t of ble&s;|&s;ings, liberty, have &s;o ea&s;ily parted with it: When groaning under the yoke of tyranny, what perils would they not encounter, what con&s;ideration would they not give to regain the ine&s;timable jewel they had lo&s;t; but the jealou&s;y of de&s;poti&s;m guards every avenue to free|dom, and confirms its empire at the expence of the de|voted people, who&s;e property is made in&s;trumental to their mi&s;ery; for the rapacious hand of power &s;eizes up|on every thing, de&s;pair pre&s;ently &s;ucceeds, and every noble faculty of the mind being depre&s;&s;ed, and all mo|tive to indu&s;try and exertion being removed, the people are adapted to the nature of the government, and drag out a li&s;tle&s;s exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>If ever America &s;hould be en&s;laved, it will be from this cau&s;e, that they are not &s;en&s;ible of their peculiar felicity, that they are not aware of the value of the hea|venly boon committed to their care and protection; and if the pre&s;ent con&s;piracy fails, as I have no doubt will be the ca&s;e, it will be the triumph of rea&s;on and philo|&s;ophy, as the&s;e united &s;tates have never felt the iron hand of power, or experienced the wretchedne&s;s of &s;la|very.</P>
<P>The con&s;pirators again&s;t our liberties have pre&s;umed too much on the maxim, that nations do not take the alarm, until they feel oppre&s;&s;ion.

I congratulate my fellow citizens, that the infatuated confidence of their enemies has &s;o blinded their ambition, that their defeat mu&s;t be certain and ea&s;y; if imitating the refined policy of &s;ucce&s;sful de&s;pots, they had attacked the cita|del of liberty by &s;ap, and gradually undermined its out|works, they would have &s;tood a fairer chance of effect|ing their de&s;ign; but in this enlightened age thus ra&s;h|ly to attempt to carry the fortre&s;s by &s;torm, is folly in|deed. They have even expo&s;ed &s;ome of their batteries prematurely, and thereby unfolded every latent view; for the unlimited power of taxation would alone have been amply &s;ufficient for every purpo&s;e; by a proper application of this, the will and plea&s;ure of the rulers would of cour&s;e have become the &s;upreme law of the land; therefore there was no u&s;e in pourtraying the ulti|mate object, by &s;uperadding the form to the reality of &s;upremacy in the following clau&s;es, viz. that which im|powers the new congre&s;s to make all laws that, may be nece&s;&s;ary and proper for carrying into execution any of their powers by virtue of which every po&s;&s;ible law will be con&s;titutional, as they are to be the &s;ole judges of the propriety of &s;uch laws; that which ordains that their acts &s;hall be the &s;upreme law of the land, any thing in the laws or con&s;titution of any &s;tate to the contrary not|with&s;tanding; that which gives congre&s;s the ab&s;olute controul over the time and mode of its appointment and election, whereby, independent of any other means; they may e&s;tabli&s;h hereditary de&s;poti&s;m; that which autho|ri&s;es

<P>So flagrant, &s;o audacious a con&s;piracy again&s;t the li|berties of a free people, is without precedent; mankind in the darke&s;t ages, have never been &s;o in&s;ulted&mdash;even then tyrants found it nece&s;&s;ary to pay &s;ome re&s;pect to the habits and feelings of the people; and nothing but the name of a Wa&s;hington could have occa&s;ioned a moment's he&s;itation about the nature of the new plan, or &s;aved its authors from the execration and vengeance of the people, which eventually will prove an aggrava|tion of their trea&s;on, for America will re&s;ent the impo|&s;ition practi&s;ed upon the un&s;u&s;picious zeal of her <HI>illu&s;tri|ous deliverer,</HI> and vindicate her character from the a&s;|per&s;ions of the&s;e enemies of her happine&s;s and fame.</P>
<P>The advocates of this plan have artfully attempted to veil over the true nature and principles of it, with the names of tho&s;e re&s;pectable characters that by con|&s;ummate cunning and addre&s;s they have prevailed upon to &s;ign it, and what ought to convince the people of the deception and excite their apprehen&s;ions, is, that with every advantage which education, the &s;cience of government, and of law, the knowledge of hi&s;tory, and &s;uperior talents and endowments furni&s;h the authors and advocates of this plan, they have, from its publication, exerted all their power and influence to prevent all di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject, and when this could not be pre|vented, they have con&s;tantly avoided the ground of ar|gument, and recurred to declamation, &s;ophi&s;try, and per&s;onal abu&s;e, but principally relied upon the magic of names. Would this have been their conduct, if their cau&s;e had been a good one? No: they would have in|vited ve&s;tigation, and convinced the under&s;tandings of the people.</P>
<P>But &s;uch policy indicates great ignorance of the good &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit of the people; for if the &s;anction of every convention throughout the union was obtained by the means the&s;e men are practi&s;ing, yet their triumph would be momentary, the favorite object would &s;till

However, the complexion of &s;everal of the more con&s;i|derable &s;tates does not promi&s;e even this point of &s;uc|ce&s;s.

<P>The merchant, immer&s;ed in &s;chemes of wealth, &s;el|dom extends his view beyond the immediate obje<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of gain; he blindly pur&s;ues his &s;eeming intere&s;t, and &s;ees not the latent mi&s;chief; therefore it is, that he is the la&s;t to take the alarm, when public liberty is threatened. This may account for the infatuation of &s;ome of our merchants, who, elated with the imaginary pro&s;pect of an improved commerce under the new government, overlook all danger; they do not con&s;ider that com|merce is the handmaid of liberty, a plant of free growth that withers under the hand of de&s;poti&s;m, that every concern of individuals will be &s;acrificed to the gratifica|tion of men in power, who will in&s;titute injurious mo|nopolies, and &s;hackle commerce with every device of avarice; and that property of every &s;pecies will be held at the <HI>will and plea&s;ure</HI> of rulers.</P>

mind. If you were &s;ufficiently impre&s;&s;ed with your pre|&s;ent favored &s;ituation, I &s;hould have no doubt of a pro|per deci&s;ion of the que&s;tion in di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The highe&s;t illu&s;tration of the excellence of the con|&s;titution of this commonwealth, is, that from its fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, the ambitious and profligate have been united in a con&s;tant con&s;piracy to de&s;troy it; &s;o &s;en&s;i|ble are they that it is their great enemy, that it is the great palladium of equal liberty, and the property of the people from the rapacious hand of power: the annals of mankind do not furni&s;h a more glorious in&s;tance of the triumph of patrioti&s;m over the lu&s;t of ambition, aided by mo&s;t of the wealth of the &s;tate. The few general|ly prevail over the many by uniformity of council, un|remitted and per&s;evering exertion, and &s;uperior inform|ation and addre&s;s; but in Penn&s;ylvania, the rever&s;e has happened; here the <HI>well-born</HI> have been baffled in all their efforts to pro&s;trate the altar of liberty for the pur|po&s;e of &s;ub&s;tit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting their own in&s;olent &s;way, that would degrade the freemen of this &s;tate into &s;ervile dependence upon the <HI>lordly</HI> and <HI>great:</HI> however, it is not the nature of ambition to be di&s;couraged; it is ever ready to im|prove the fir&s;t opportunity to rear its baneful head, and with irritated fury to wreak its vengeance on the vota|ries of liberty.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent con&s;piracy is a continental exertion of the <HI>well-born</HI> of America to obtain that darling domi|nation, which they have not been able to accompli&s;h in their re&s;pective &s;tates. Of what complexion were the deputies of this &s;tate in the general convention? Six out of eight were the inveterate enemies of our ine&s;timable con&s;titution, and the principles of that faction that for ten years pa&s;t have kept the people in continual alarm for their liberties. Who are the advocates of the new con&s;titution in this &s;tate? They con&s;i&s;t of the &s;ame facti|on, with the addition of a few deluded well-meaning men, but who&s;e number is daily le&s;&s;ening.</P>
<P>The con&s;pirators have come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rward at a mo&s;t favor|able conjuncture, when the &s;tate of public affairs has lulled all jealou&s;y o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> power: emboldened by the &s;anction of the augu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l name of a <HI>Wa&s;hington</HI> that they have pro&s;ti|tuted their purpo&s;e, they have pre&s;umed to overleap the

u&s;ual gradations to ab&s;olute power, and have attempted to &s;eize at once upon the &s;upremacy of dominion. The new in&s;trument of government does indeed make a &s;al|lacious parade of &s;ome remaining privileges, and in&s;ults the under&s;tandings of the people with the &s;emblance of liberty in &s;ome of its artful and deceptive clau&s;es, which form but a flim&s;y veil over the reality of tyranny, &s;o weakly endeavoured to be concealed from the eye of freedom. For, of what avail are the few inadequate &s;tipulations in favor of the rights of the people, when they may be effectually counteracted and de&s;troyed by virtue of other clau&s;es; when the&s;e enable the rulers to renounce all dependence on their con&s;tituents, and ren|der the latter tenants at will of every concern? The new con&s;titution is in fact a <HI>carte blanche,</HI> a &s;urrender at di&s;cretion to the will and plea&s;ure of our rulers; as this has been demon&s;trated to be the ca&s;e, by the inve&s;|tigation and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion that have taken place, I tru&s;t the &s;ame good &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit which have hitherto enabled the people to triumph over the wiles of ambition, will be again exerted for their &s;alvation. The accounts from various parts of the country corre&s;pond with my warm|e&s;t hopes, and ju&s;tify my early predictions of the eventual defeat of this &s;cheme of power and office making.</P>
<P>The genius of liberty has &s;ounded the alarm, and the dormant &s;pirit of her votaries is reviving with enthu&s;i|a&s;tic ardor; the like unanimity which formerly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them in their conflict with foreign de&s;pots, pro|mi&s;e to crown their virtuous oppo&s;ition on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, with &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;s. The &s;tructure of de&s;po|ti&s;m that has been reared in this &s;tate, upon deception and &s;urpri&s;e, will vani&s;h like the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a dream, and leave not a trace behind.</P>
<P>The pera&s;ites and tools of power in Northampton county ought to take warning from the fate of the Car|li&s;le junto, le&s;t like them, they experience the re&s;entment of an injured people. I would advi&s;e them not to repeat the impo&s;ition of a &s;et of fallacious re&s;olutions as the &s;en&s;e of that county, when in fact, it was the act of a de&s;picable few, with Alexander Patter&s;on at their head, who&s;e atchievements at Wyoming, as the meaner in&s;tru|ment of unfeeling avarice, have rendered in&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nou&s;ly no|torious;

but yet, like the election of a Mr. Sedgwick for the little town of Stockbridge, which has been adduced as evidence of the unanimity of the we&s;tern counties of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts &s;tate in favour of the new con&s;titution, when the fact is far otherwi&s;e, this act of a few individu|als will be founded forth over the continent as a te&s;ti|mony of the zealous attachment of the county of North|ampton to the new con&s;titution. By &s;uch wretched and momentary deceptions do the&s;e harpies of power endea|vour to give the complexion of &s;trength to their cau&s;e. To prevent the detection of &s;uch impo&s;itions, to prevent the reflection of the rays of light from &s;tate to &s;tate, which producing general illumination, would di&s;&s;ipate the mi&s;t of deception, and thereby prove fatal to the new con&s;titution, all intercour&s;e between the patriots of A|merica is as far as po&s;&s;ible cut off; whil&s;t on the other hand, the con&s;pirators have the mo&s;t exact information, a common concert is every where evident, they move in uni&s;on. There is &s;o much my&s;tery in the conduct of the&s;e men, &s;uch &s;y&s;tematic de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ption, and fraud, cha|racteri&s;es all their mea&s;ures, &s;uch extraordinary &s;olici|tude &s;hewn by them to precipitate and &s;urpri&s;e the peo|ple into a blind and implicit adoption of this government that it ought to excite the mo&s;t alarming apprehen&s;ions in the minds of all tho&s;e who think their privileges, pro|perty and welfare, worth &s;ecuring.</P>
<P>It is a fact that can be e&s;tabli&s;hed, that during almo&s;t the whole of the time that the late convention of this &s;tate were a&s;&s;embled, the new&s;-papers publi&s;hed in New-York, by Mr. Greenleaf, which contain the e&s;&s;ays writ|ten there again&s;t the new government, &s;uch as the pa|triotic ones of Brutus, Cincinnatus, Cato, &amp;c. &s;ent as u&s;ual by the printer of that place, to the printers of this city, mi&s;carried in their conveyance, which prevented the re-publication in this &s;tate, of many of the&s;e pieces, and &s;ince that period great irregularity prevails; and I &s;tand informed, that the printers in New-York complain that the free and independent new&s;papers of this city do not come to hand; whil&s;t on the contrary, we find the devoted vehicles of de&s;poti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m pa&s;s uninterrupted. I would a&s;k what is the meaning of the new arrangement at the po&s;t-office, which abridges the circulation of new&s;-papers

at this momentous cri&s;is, when our every concern is dependent upon a proper deci&s;ion of the &s;ubject in di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion. No trivial excu&s;e will be admitted; the Centi|nel will, as from the fir&s;t approach of de&s;poti&s;m, warn his countrymen of the in&s;idious and ba&s;e &s;tratagems that are practi&s;ing to hoodwink them out of their liberties.</P>
<P>The more I con&s;ider the manoeuvres that are practi&s;ing, the more am I alarmed&mdash;fore&s;eeing that the juggle can|not long be concealed, and that the &s;pirit of the people will not brook the impo&s;ition, they have guarded, as they &s;uppo&s;e, again&s;t any danger ari&s;ing from the oppo|&s;ition of the people, and rendered their &s;truggles for li|berty impotent and ridiculous. What otherwi&s;e is the meaning of di&s;arming the militia, for the purpo&s;e, as it is &s;aid, of repairing their mu&s;quets at &s;uch a particular period? Does not the timeing of the mea&s;ure determine the intention. I was ever jealous of the &s;elect militia, con&s;i&s;ting of infantry and troops of hor&s;e, in&s;tituted in this city, and in &s;ome of the counties, without the fanc|tion of law, and officered principally by the devoted in|&s;truments of the well born, although the illu&s;trious pa|trioti&s;m of one of them, has not corre&s;ponded with the intention of appointing him.
