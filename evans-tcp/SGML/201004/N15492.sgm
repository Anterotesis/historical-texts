<HEAD>THE DOCTRINE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ubject to be con&s;idered is the Doc|trine of Laying on of Hands, as exhi+bited in the xxxi chapter of our Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith; part of which we will tran&s;cribe, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>We believe that Laying on of Hands, with prayer, upon baptized believers, as &s;uch, is an ordinance of Chri&s;t, and ought to be &s;ubmitted unto by all &s;uch per&s;ons, that are admitted to partake of the Lord's Supper; and that the end of this ordinance is not for the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, but for a farther reception of the Holy Spirit of promi&s;e; or for the addition of the graces of the Spirit and the influences thereof, to confirm, &s;trengthen, and com|fort them in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; it being ratified and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit in the primitive times,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It is granted, that an article of faith em|braced by a church doth not make it truth in it&s;elf; but we mu&s;t conceive that it con|tains the meaning in which the church re|ceive the Scripture on that &s;ubject. It mu&s;t therefore argue a degree of precipitance in a&s;&s;ociated members belonging to indepen|dent
<PB N="3" REF="019738_0003_0FACA6F463797390">churches, to re&s;olve that to be a matter of <HI>indifference,</HI> which, at the &s;ame time, &s;tands exhibited to the world, as an anticle of their faith. By this example, a future a&s;&s;ociation might re&s;olve another article away as no bar of communion, till, at la&s;t, it would be im|po&s;&s;ible to know what is the faith and prac|tice of a regular Bapti&s;t church.</P>
<P>It is with great reluctance we appear in vin|dication of one of our articles of faith; but the per&s;evering imprudence of &s;ome of our young mini&s;tring brethren, renders it nece&s;&s;ary to inve&s;tigate the &s;ubject, and either explode it, or maintain it with that zeal which becomes the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t. If it cannot be &s;up|ported by &s;cripture, let us drop it; if it can, let us unanimou&s;ly practi&s;e it: for all other expedients will be only healing the hurt of the daughter of Zion &s;lightly, crying <HI>Peace, peace, when there is</HI> none.</P>
<P>The article under con&s;ideration contains the following propo&s;itions, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That the regular Bapti&s;t churches be|longing to the Philadelphian A&s;&s;ociation believe that laying on of hands on bap|tized believers, as &s;uch, is an ordinance in&s;tituted by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That none ought to be admitted to re|ceive the Lord's Supper, without &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to the &s;ame.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="4" REF="019738_0004_0FACA6F5222C6DA8">
III. That it was not in&s;tituted, nor ever u&s;ed to confer the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. That the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, which did &s;ometimes attend it, afford an argument to prove it an ordi|nance of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. That one end of this holy in&s;titution was to comfort, confirm, and &s;trengthen true believers, by additional mea&s;ures and gifts of the Holy Spirit.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The&s;e five propo&s;itions contain the prin|cipal points to be inve&s;tigated on this &s;ubject, and if the&s;e appear, by fair &s;criptural argu|ments, we hope to &s;ee once more unity of faith in our churches. It is wi&s;hed that the reader would endeavour to remove prejudices for or again&s;t the in&s;titution, that the point may be examined impartially, comparing &s;piritual things with &s;piritual.</P>
<P>After our ble&s;&s;ed Lord ro&s;e from the dead, he was &s;een by the apo&s;tles &s;orty days, con|ver&s;ing with them, and in&s;tructing them in the <HI>things pertaining to the kingdom of God,</HI> Acts i. 3. What he taught them, we mu&s;t learn from their doctrine and practice. We know it was his po&s;itive command, to <HI>teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t; teaching them to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever he had command|ed them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="019738_0005_0FACA6F5E1BBF4B0">
If we find the apo&s;tles, by their example, teaching the Laying on of Hands on bap|tized believers, as &s;uch, then we mu&s;t con|clude, that our redeemer taught them &s;o to do; con&s;equently, we need not be &s;urpri&s;ed to find the in&s;titution called the Doctrine of Chri&s;t, becau&s;e he taught it to the apo|&s;tles him&s;elf.</P>
<P>We are now naturally led to read the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, where we find exam|ples to bear witne&s;s to the ordinance. The fir&s;t is recorded in Acts viii. 14&mdash;17. As we &s;hall have occa&s;ion frequently to refer to this pa&s;&s;age, we will now tran&s;cribe it, <HI>viz. Now when the apo&s;tles which were at Jeru|&s;alem, beard that Samaria bad received the word of God, they &s;ent unto them Peter and John. Who when they were come down, pray|ed for them that they might receive the Holy Gho&s;t. (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Je&s;us.) Then laid they their bands on them, and they received the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The reader will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, who the per&s;ons were, on whom the apo&s;tles laid their hands; and the plain reading will &s;hew that they were the men and women, who believed and were baptized by Philip.</P>
<P>A man mu&s;t be &s;trangely infatuated with his own fancy, who would pre&s;ume to a&s;&s;ert that the apo&s;tles laid hands only on &s;ome per|&s;ons
<PB N="6" REF="019738_0006_0FACA6F6A18106C0">at Samaria, who were thereby ordained as officers, when the word <HI>them</HI> plainly re|fers to the men and women, who believed and were baptized.</P>
<P>We proceed to con&s;ider the example of the apo&s;tle Paul, Acts xix. 1,&mdash;6. To a&s;&s;i&s;t the reader's memory, we will tran&s;cribe the ver&s;es, <HI>viz. Paul having pa&s;&s;ed through the upper coa&s;ts, came to Ephe&s;us: and finding certain di&s;ciples, he &s;aid unto them, have ye received the Holy Gho&s;t &s;ince ye believed? And they &s;aid unto him, we have not &s;o much as heard whether there be any Holy Gho&s;t. And he &s;aid unto them, unto what then were ye baptized? and they &s;aid, unto John's bapti&s;m. Then &s;aid Paul, John verily baptized with the bapti&s;m of repentance, &s;aying unto the people, that they &s;hould believe on him, who &s;hould come after him, that is, on Chri&s;t Je&s;us. When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Je&s;us. And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Gho&s;t came on them; and they &s;pake with tongues, and pro|phe&s;ied, and all the men were about twelve.</HI></P>
<P>Here we have a plain hi&s;tory of facts, <HI>viz.</HI> Paul met &s;ome di&s;ciples at Ephe&s;us&mdash;he a&s;k|ed them whether they had received the Holy Spirit.&mdash;They appeared &s;trangers to the &s;ub|ject. &mdash;Paul knowing that the Holy Gho&s;t, in the <HI>capacity of a comforter,</HI> was promi&s;ed to all go&s;pel believers, and that they were bap|tized
<PB N="7" REF="019738_0007_0FACA6F772C7D508">in the name of the Holy Gho&s;t, as well as in the name of the Father and Son; a&s;ks them unto what were they baptized? they told him, unto John's bapti&s;m.&mdash;Paul ex|plains that, and points out what John taught re&s;pecting him, who was to come after him, that is, Chri&s;t.&mdash;When the&s;e di&s;ciples heard the matter explained, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Je&s;us. Then Paul proceeds, and Laid his Hands on them, as the next ordinance following bapti&s;m; and, no doubt, he then con&s;tituted them into a church.&mdash;La&s;tly, the Holy Gho&s;t came on them, not only in the gifts and graces be|longing to go&s;pel believers; but al&s;o the ex|traordinary gifts attended this holy in&s;titu|tion at this time, tho' it was not the apo&s;tles de&s;ign in Laying his Hands upon them, which we hope to prove, when we come to con&s;ider that head. Neither can we &s;up|po&s;e, that he ordained them all officers, for their circum&s;tances could not require it.&mdash; We know what our opponents &s;ay on this pa&s;&s;age, but we beg the reader to &s;u&s;pend his judgment till he hears what may be &s;aid.</P>
<P>We will now follow the apo&s;tle to his Epi&s;tle to the Hebrews, chap. vi. 1, 2. <HI>Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Chri&s;t, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith towards God, of the doc|trine
<PB N="8" REF="019738_0008_0FACA6F837E5A1A0">of bapti&s;ms, and of Laying on of Hands, and of re&s;urrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</HI></P>
<P>All the old fathers and divines, which I have &s;een, agree that this text proves the Laying on of Hands on believers, as &s;uch, to be in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t him&s;elf; and there|fore it is mentioned with the important chri|&s;tian doctrines, or doctrine of Chri&s;t, who is the head of the church, and lawgiver of his people.</P>
<P>Such evidence of this truth appeared at the reformation, that the church of England retained the ordinance, under the name of confirmation; but a very learned divine in England, would per&s;uade us that the pa&s;&s;age refers to the old di&s;pen&s;ation, and therefore the Laying on of Hands refers to the prie&s;ts laying on their hands on the &s;acrifices. As we are forbid to call any man father or ma|&s;ter in religion, we mu&s;t beg leave to &s;ee with our own eyes, and di&s;&s;ent from him, and believe great and good men are but men, and what is hid &s;ometimes from the wi&s;e and prudent, is revealed to babes. Tho' we would pay the greate&s;t regard to the doc|tor's judgment, yet it is &s;o ordered that no one man &s;hould excel in all things.</P>
<P>Finding &s;ome of my brethren rea&s;oning on the &s;ubject agreeable to the doctor's expo|&s;ition; it induced me to read the Epi&s;tle
<PB N="9" REF="019738_0009_0FACA6F8E24E64F8">twice over; but in&s;tead of being convinced of my mi&s;take, it e&s;tabli&s;hed me in the firm belief that the &s;entiment was a groundle&s;s fancy, probably generated by Rabinical no|tions, of which he only too much abounds.</P>
<P>We will give our rea&s;ons why we believe the pa&s;&s;age doth not refer to the Mo&s;ai|cal di&s;pen&s;ation. (1.) There is no mention made in all the epi&s;tle, concerning the prie&s;ts laying their hands on the &s;acrifice; nor any thing plainly referring to that practice.&mdash; (2.) The Mo&s;aical rites are in no part of &s;cripture called the doctrines of Chri&s;t; but go&s;pel truths are called &s;o; therefore com|paring &s;piritual things with &s;piritual, we mu&s;t conclude the apo&s;tle means the doc|trines of the New-Te&s;tament, by the doc|trines of Chri&s;t. Let us attend to what the apo&s;tle John &s;ays, in his &s;econd epi&s;tle and 9th ver&s;e. <HI>Who&s;oever tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth, and a|bideth not in the doctrines of Chri&s;t, hath not God: he that abideth in the</HI> doctrine <HI>of Chri&s;t, hath both the Father and the Son.</HI> Other texts might be quoted to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; but we di&s;mi&s;s the pa&s;&s;age for the pre&s;ent, tho' we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to con&s;ider it again. And we come to the Second pro|po&s;ition.</P>
<P N="2">II. Which was, That none &s;hould be ad|mitted to receive the Lord's Supper without &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to this ordinance.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="019738_0010_0FACA6F9A1F45E18">
Before we inve&s;tigate the &s;ubject, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e a few particulars relative to the Lord's &s;upper, and a go&s;pel church.</P>
<P N="1">1. We conceive the Lord's &s;upper to be a church ordinance. Preaching the go&s;pel and bapti&s;m cannot be properly called church or|dinances, becau&s;e they nece&s;&s;arily precede the very exi&s;tence of a church. The Lord's &s;up|per was fir&s;t celebrated by our Redeemer among his apo&s;tles, and where no church ex|i&s;ts, it cannot be properly admini&s;tered, be|cau&s;e there can be no di&s;cipline without con|federation; it follows, therefore, if a thou|&s;and believers met together, they could not orderly admini&s;ter the Lord's &s;upper, before they entered into confederation, or a volun|tary compact, by which they take on them the laws of Chri&s;t, and engage &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his authority on earth. I am not to be un|der&s;tood that they &s;hould always meet in the &s;ame place; no, this is left to their di&s;cre|tion, they may break bread from hou&s;e to hou&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. Though we read not in what manner the apo&s;tles con&s;tituted a church of Chri&s;t, yet we read of many churches, and &s;ome for|mality or voluntary act, mu&s;t have made them &s;uch.</P>
<P>We proceed now to inve&s;tigate the pro|po&s;ition; and from every circum&s;tance, it &s;eems very probable, that Peter and John
<PB N="11" REF="019738_0011_0FACA6FA62D45DD8">were &s;ent to Samaria for the very purpo&s;e of con&s;tituting them into a go&s;pel church. We find Barnabas &s;ent to Antioch on a &s;imilar oc|ca&s;ion, and immediately we read of a church there, with whom he and Paul a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>One end of Laying on of Hands might be to devote them to God as an hou&s;e to dwell in, and as the Lord's building, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Gho&s;t as a <HI>comforter,</HI> and be filled with his precious gifts and graces, to enable them to bear witne&s;s for Chri&s;t, to confirm and &s;trengthen them to grow up to the fulne&s;s of the &s;tature of a man in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the twelve men, whom Paul baptized at Ephe&s;us, Acts xix. for we conclude the holy apo&s;tle taught them to ob&s;erve all things commanded by Chri&s;t; he therefore devotes them to the Lord by Lay|ing his Hands on them; but with no view, that they &s;hould thereby receive the extraor|dinary gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t, for this would be taking the office of the Spirit on him&s;elf, for it is the Spirit that di&s;tributes the gifts &s;everally as he will. We will illu&s;trate this point, when we come to &s;peak on that head.</P>
<P>If we grant there was a church con&s;tituted at Samaria, and another at Ephe&s;us, in which the Lord's-&s;upper was admini&s;tered, then we mu&s;t conclude, Laying on of Hands pre|ceded the reception of the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="019738_0012_0FACA6FB22D1ECD8">
Before we proceed further on the &s;ubject, we would give &s;ome rea&s;ons, why we believe that Laying on of Hands was u&s;ed, as an external act in devoting a per&s;on or per&s;ons to God and his &s;ervice. The &s;criptures &s;hew it was an antient cu&s;tom, under the legal di&s;|pen&s;ation; and tho' now it is a go&s;pel ordi|nance, we may learn &s;ome things relative to it, by ob&s;erving on what occa&s;ions it was formerly u&s;ed. It was the external act, by which the Levites were devoted to God and his &s;ervice. Numbers viii. 10. <HI>And thou &s;halt bring the Levites before the Lord, and the children of I&s;rael &s;hall put their hands up|on the Levites.</HI> Ver&s;e 14. <HI>Thus &s;halt thou &s;eparate the Levites from among the children of I&s;rael: and the Levites &s;hall be mine.</HI> The third and fourth chap. of Leviticus prove that it was a fixed &s;tatute in offering all &s;a|crifices for &s;in: whoever brought an animal to a prie&s;t to be offered a &s;acrifice, he laid his hands on it, thereby, not only transfer|ring his &s;in figuratively, but al&s;o devoting it to God; and this &s;etting of the creature apart for a holy u&s;e, is called &s;anctifying it, as it was wholly given to God. It was u&s;ed for|merly on &s;ome other occa&s;ions, not nece&s;&s;ary to mention at pre&s;ent. We are now con&s;i|dering it as a New-Te&s;tament in&s;titution, and &s;ee, by a parity of rea&s;oning, one thing taught by it is, when hands are laid on bap|tized
<PB N="13" REF="019738_0013_0FACA6FBE219B898">believers, as &s;uch, that the per&s;on, like the Levites, is devoted to God and his &s;er|vice; he is a living &s;acrifice, &s;eparated from the &s;ervices of &s;in, as the temple of the Holy Gho&s;t to dwell in, to offer up &s;piritual &s;acri|fices, holy and acceptable to God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</P>
<P>Much has been &s;aid about the ordination of officers in the church; but taking the Lay|ing on of Hands in this point of view, we &s;ee it means no more than an external act, by which the per&s;on is publicly devoted to God in that office, and as this precedes his au|thority to admini&s;ter other holy ordinances, &s;o on baptized believers, as &s;uch, it precedes their admittance to the Lord's &s;upper. It would be as regular, to allow a per&s;on to baptize, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> before ordination, as to admit any to the Lord's &s;upper before &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Laying on of Hands.</P>
<P>The objections, which ari&s;e again&s;t the one, will certainly militate again&s;t the other, equally &s;trong, if impartially examined. Be|fore we pa&s;s from this propo&s;ition, we will make &s;ome further remarks on Heb. vi. 1, 2.</P>
<P>Here you &s;ee &s;ix articles mentioned of the chri&s;tian faith, and they are called the prin|ciples of the doctrine of Chri&s;t, which im|plies they mean &s;omething embraced, pro|fe&s;&s;ed and performed in the beginning of a chri&s;tian life. 2. They are called foundation
<PB N="14" REF="019738_0014_0FACA6FCA1B7B2D8">principles, "not laying again the founda|tion." Some rea&s;ons have been already a&s;|&s;igned, why we cannot believe this pa&s;&s;age refers to the prie&s;ts Laying their Hands on the &s;acrifices; but the groundle&s;&s;ne&s;s of the conjecture, will more fully appear, by mak|ing &s;ome remarks on the&s;e principles. Let us con&s;ider them as they &s;tand&mdash;</P>
<P>The words &s;eem to be figurative, referring to a mechanic, who fir&s;t lays a foundation, and proceeds to fini&s;h the building; or in other words, brings it to perfection, "Not laying again the foundation." Whatever may be the true meaning of the&s;e &s;ix princi|ples, we &s;ee, they are called a foundation.</P>
<P>We cannot &s;uppo&s;e them to be the foun|dation of our &s;alvation, for Chri&s;t is that, and other foundation, in that point of view, can on man lay; we &s;hall therefore conclude them to be the foundation or beginning of the chri&s;tian life. In this &s;en&s;e, let us con&s;ider them di&s;tinctly. 1. Repentance from dead works, is a phra&s;e agreeing to New-Te&s;ta|ment language; here we are repre&s;ented to be dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, and our works, in that &s;tate, bring forth fruit unto death. No man truly &s;ets out in a new or chri&s;tian life, while he willingly retains one &s;in. A right eye mu&s;t be plucked out, for we can|not &s;erve God and mammon. The love of &s;in in the heart, mu&s;t be removed; and it is
<PB N="15" REF="019738_0015_0FACA6FD61FC1A90">truly &s;o, when that precious word is accom|pli&s;hed, <HI>viz. A new heart will I give you, and a new &s;pirit will I put within you,</HI> Ezek. xxxvi. 26. Moreover, repentance from dead works is never repeated, becau&s;e the &s;oul that is made alive in Chri&s;t, never falls into a &s;tate of death. Repentance, as a back&s;lider or &s;inful child, may be often repeated, but repentance from dead works remains as a foundation, or beginning to live in newne&s;s of life.</P>
<P N="2">2. "Faith towards God," tho' on &s;ome accounts it might be applied to the legal di&s;pen&s;ation, yet it is much plainer to the mind of God revealed in the go&s;pel, where we are &s;o often called upon to believe the te&s;timony or record given of his &s;on. It is repre&s;ented by our Lord as the principal work plea&s;ing to God. <HI>This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath &s;ent,</HI> John vi. 29. and the apo&s;tle John &s;ays, <HI>This is his commandment, that ye &s;hould believe on the name of his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> 1 John iii. 23. The &s;ame apo&s;tle repre&s;ents all who have not this faith towards God, as practi|cally making him a liar, 1 John v. 10. Faith towards God includes in it, a firm be|lief of the whole revelation, which he hath made; and, in particular, credit of the re|cord which he hath given of his Son. This faith is the beginning of a go&s;pel life, in
<PB N="16" REF="019738_0016_0FACA6FE216A7D38">which we live a life of faith on the Son of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. The doctrine of bapti&s;ms &s;tands agree|able to the go&s;pel order, in which repentance and faith precede it. Bapti&s;m is a beginning, foundation principle of newne&s;s of life, and therefore is never repeated, becau&s;e we are once dead with Chri&s;t&mdash;once buried with him in bapti&s;m&mdash;once rai&s;ed up to walk in new|ne&s;s of life.</P>
<P>Bapti&s;m is here in the plural number, be|cau&s;e more things than one is meant by it. Not only immer&s;ion in water and the extra|ordinary effu&s;ions of the Spirit; but per&s;ecu|tions and &s;ufferings for Chri&s;t's &s;ake. Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord taught us, that if any man would come after him, he mu&s;t deny him&s;elf and take up his cro&s;s and follow him. And in another place, he &s;ays, <HI>In the world, ye &s;hall have tribulation.</HI> The apo&s;tle Paul taught the &s;ame doctrine, when he &s;aid, <HI>That we mu&s;t through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>The 4th principle is Laying on of Hands. This is performed at our fir&s;t embracing chri&s;tianity, and, as it is never repeated, it is therefore a beginning of a new life. We are once made partakers of the Holy Gho&s;t as a comforter, and once devoted to God as his temple to dwell in. If a per&s;on is ordained to an office in the church, it is repeated as
<PB N="17" REF="019738_0017_0FACA6FEE56040A8" MS="y">an external act devoting the per&s;on to God in that office; hence we read of Timothy fir&s;t having the hands of Paul laid on him, as a believer, and afterwards, the hands of the pre&s;bytery were laid on him, when he was ordained an officer in the church.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the two remaining principles, it is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that they &s;tand in the very language of the New-Te&s;t|ament; and it requires a wi&s;dom, which is not from above, to apply the words to the Old Te&s;tament; tho' it is acknowledged the doctrine is contained therein, but the apo&s;tle in this epi&s;tle has not treated of &s;uch pa&s;&s;a|ges in the Old Te&s;tament as refer to the &s;ub|ject. Whoever reads the New-Te&s;tament, mu&s;t be convinced, that the re&s;urrection of the dead, and eternal judgment, are &s;ub|jects frequently in&s;i&s;ted on in a very peculiar manner. We &s;hall ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that we are baptized in hopes of the re&s;urrection from the dead, and we wait for the coming of Chri&s;t to judge the world, when he will change our vile body, that it may be fa&s;hioned like unto his glorious body.</P>
<P>From what was been &s;aid, we hope it doth appear, that this pa&s;&s;age in the Hebrews re|fers to the New-Te&s;tament di&s;pen&s;ation; and if &s;o, it follows, that when the Hebrews were con&s;tituted into a church, they &s;ubmitted to this holy ordinance, as the external mini&s;tra|tion
<PB N="18" REF="019738_0018_0FACA6FFA39A5D58">of the Spirit; and by which, they were devoted as an habitation for God to dwell in. And if, at the fir&s;t con&s;titution of the church, it was u&s;ed, it follows, that when any join the church, they ought to follow the exam|ple &s;et before them.</P>
<P N="3">III. We come now to con&s;ider the Third propo&s;ition, which was, That Laying on of Hands was not in&s;tituted, nor ever u&s;ed, to confer the extraordinary gifts of the holy Spirit.</P>
<P>Why any per&s;on &s;hould conclude that the extraodinary gifts of the Spirit, was the end of the in&s;titution, we know not, except they argue that as the&s;e gifts attended the admini|&s;tration, they were therefore the end. The ab&s;urdity of this way of rea&s;oning will ap|pear, before we di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject. Had this been the end, we might rea&s;onably ex|pect, that the apo&s;tles would have given &s;ome intimation of the &s;ame; but as there is none on record, we infer, it was not the de&s;ign.</P>
<P>We will examine the pa&s;&s;ages, where it is &s;uppo&s;ed the apo&s;tles u&s;ed it to confer the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit; and if it appears, that it was not their de&s;ign in the admini&s;tration of this ordinance, then we hope, the point will be given up, and we &s;hall truly unite in the apo&s;tles practice.</P>
<P>We will review the ver&s;es already tran&s;cri|bed, <HI>viz.</HI> Acts viii. 14&mdash;17. and we find
<PB N="19" REF="019738_0019_0FACA70063662240">the matters of fact are the following, 1. Peter and John were &s;ent from Jeru&s;alem to Sama|ria. 2. When they came, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Gho&s;t. 3. They laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Gho&s;t. Not one word of the extraordinary gifts, <HI>"They received the Holy Gho&s;t."</HI> The &s;cripture doth not &s;ay, that the apo&s;tles even prayed for any particular gift, ordinary, or extraordinary; but that they might receive the Holy Gho&s;t HIMSELF. Ob&s;erve that, ver&s;e 15. If it is thought, by receiving the Holy Gho&s;t, the extraordinary gifts are meant, and none have them gifts now, it follows, that none have the Spirit now, which is po&s;itively contrary to the pro|mi&s;e of Chri&s;t, who &s;ays, the comforter &s;hall abide with us ever, John xiv. 16. Now, if we are not obliged to believe that by receiv|ing the Holy Gho&s;t, the extraordinary gifts are meant, then nothing is proved again&s;t us from this pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Not one word is &s;aid about &s;peaking with tongues, or working miracles; and if the&s;e effects had followed, it would not prove it was the de&s;ign of the act, but an attendant of it, for the ratification of the &s;ame, as will appear hereafter. We will not di&s;pute but the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit attended the admini&s;tration of the ordinance; but the&s;e gifts were di&s;tributed, when, where, and in
<PB N="20" REF="019738_0020_0FACA70122560DE8">what manner, the Holy Gho&s;t him&s;elf willed. The&s;e gifts are in his hands, and not in the hands of man, or &s;ubject to his will. More|over, if hands were laid on per&s;ons to confer the extraordinary gifts, then we would a&s;k, was this always the end? If it is an&s;wered in the affirmative, then it follows, that the or|dinance &s;hould not be u&s;ed now, at the ordi|nation of mini&s;ters, becau&s;e formerly a gift attended it, 1 Tim. iv. 14.</P>
<P>We have no rea&s;on to believe that the extra|ordinary gifts always attended, this ordinance in the apo&s;tles days, becau&s;e, had this been the ca&s;e, there could have been no room for this que&s;tion. <HI>Do all &s;peak with tongues?</HI> 1 Cor. xii. 30. We would recommend to our reader to open his Bible, and read to the 12th ver&s;e of this chapter, and he will plainly &s;ee that all the gifts were in the hands of the Spirit, and di&s;tributed according to his own will.</P>
<P>The proceedings of Peter and John at Sa|maria agree to this doctrine, when they pray|ed for them that they might receive the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> And here an important que&s;tion ari&s;|es, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether the apo&s;tles meant the ex|traordinary gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t? or whe|ther they meant the receiving the Holy Gho&s;t, in his office <HI>as the comforter</HI> and &s;pirit of con|&s;olation? In the latter &s;en&s;e, he is promi&s;ed to dwell in his people, to the end of the
<PB N="21" REF="019738_0021_0FACA701E2783030">world, and this meaning we prefer; becau&s;e the extraordinary gifts are not promi&s;ed to all true believers in Chri&s;t, con&s;equently, the the apo&s;tles could not pray for them in faith; but the Holy Spirit, as a <HI>comforter,</HI> is a le|gacy promi&s;ed to all that truly believe, to the end of the world; therefore in this capa|city they prayed for him. <HI>And I will pray the Father, and he &s;hall give you another com|forter, that he may abide with you forever; even the Spirit of truth,</HI> John xiv. 16, 17. Moreover, the apo&s;tles were &s;ent to Samaria for the comfort of true believers, but the extraordinary gifts were for a &s;ign to them that believe not, con&s;equently not prayed for in this place. This way of rea&s;oning agrees with peter's conduct, when his hear|ers a&s;ked what &s;hall we do? His an&s;wer was, <HI>Repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, and ye &s;hall receive the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t. For the promi&s;e is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God &s;hall call,</HI> Acts ii. 37&mdash;39. This promi&s;e mu&s;t be ful|filled to all, whom the Lord our God &s;hall call; but the extraordinary gifts are not con|ferred on any, in our days, and never were conferred on all in the apo&s;tles days, con&s;e|quently, the Holy Gho&s;t in his office as a comforter, mu&s;t be meant.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="019738_0022_0FACA702A352EC48">
It is granted that the extraordinary gifts did attend the admini&s;tration of this ordi|nance, Acts xix. 6. But this doth not prove that Paul laid his hands on them for that end. And this will appear by making &s;ome re|marks on the pa&s;&s;age. 1. Paul finds di&s;ci|ples at Ephe&s;us, and a&s;ks them, <HI>Have ye received the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;ince ye believed?</HI> where note, the very que&s;tion implies that the Holy Gho&s;t is the common privilege of all the children of God, and is enjoyed, in a greater or le&s;&s;er mea&s;ure, by every true believer; but the extraordinary gifts were never either promi&s;ed or enjoyed by every &s;aint, therefore could not be meant by the apo&s;tle. 2. The que&s;tion &s;hews, that agree|able to the apo&s;tle's meaning, every believer receives the Spirit <HI>after believing,</HI> and not before, which mu&s;t mean receiving him in his office as a comforter. Hence we read, <HI>After ye believed, ye were &s;ealed with that holy Spirit of promi&s;e.</HI> 3. If the extraordi|nary gifts had been meant, it would have been as natural for the apo&s;tle to have a&s;ked, "Do ye &s;peak with tongues, or work mi|racles?" Nay, the extraordinary gifts were &s;o vi&s;ible, that he might have &s;een them without a&s;king. 4. He &s;peaks of the Holy Gho&s;t as that which all might expect, who truly believed and were baptized in the name of the trinity, <HI>Unto what then were ye bap|tized?</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="019738_0023_0FACA7036174E548">They told him, it was unto John's bapti&s;m. Paul explains the nature of that, and of bapti&s;m after Chri&s;t's a&s;cen&s;ion, which would lead him to &s;peak of the Spirit as a promi&s;ed comforter. When they were in|&s;tructed, he baptized them in the name of the Lord Je&s;us; and then proceeds accord|ing to go&s;pel order, and Lays his Hands on them, and the Holy Gho&s;t came on them; and they &s;pake with tongues and prophe&s;ied. From no circum&s;tance can we infer, that Paul laid his hands on them, to confer the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit.</P>
<P>It is true, that here the extraordinary gifts <HI>attended</HI> and followed the Laying on of Hands, and &s;o did they attend and follow preaching, praying and meeting; will any one &s;ay, this was the end of the&s;e divine in|&s;titutions? By no means, the gifts of God are be&s;towed when and where he plea&s;eth. We are in hopes, that we have proved to a demon&s;tration, and full &s;atisfaction of all, who wi&s;h to know the mind of the Lord, that hands were laid on none with any view of conferring the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit; but, on the other hand, the apo&s;tles u&s;ed this holy in&s;titution as the external act, by which the Holy Gho&s;t was given to true believers, in the character and capacity of a comforter, or a &s;pirit of con&s;olation. And although God hath not confined him&s;elf to
<PB N="24" REF="019738_0024_0FACA70427BE58D0">any means, yet he hath confined us in our waiting on him; and this is called in&s;tituted wor&s;hip. This point might be further illu|&s;trated, but we come to the Fourth propo&s;i|tion, which was</P>
<P N="4">IV. That the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit, which at fir&s;t attended the Lay|ing on of Hands, afford an argument to prove the continuance of the ordinance.</P>
<P>The glorious go&s;pel contained my&s;teries &s;o far tran&s;cending the human under&s;tanding, that God was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to attend its fir&s;t promulgation, with &s;uch marks of his maje&s;ty and power, that every objection might be &s;ilenced, and the opponents remain without excu&s;e. It could never be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the &s;upreme would impo&s;e on his crea|tures, by &s;uch exertions of his divinity as were di&s;played, by rai&s;ing the dead, re&s;tor|ing &s;ight to the blind, ca&s;ting out devils, curing complaints of body without medi|cines, &s;peaking with tougues never learned, foretelling exactly future events. When the&s;e things attended the go&s;pel, they were certain proofs that it was of God; hence the apo&s;tle tells us, that God confirmed the go&s;pel, <HI>with &s;igns and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t, according to his own will,</HI> Heb. ii. 4.</P>
<P>By reading the &s;criptures, we &s;ee, in what manner God confirmed his own in&s;titutions,
<PB N="25" REF="019738_0025_0FACA704E2739480">by the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit; yet this is never u&s;ed as an argument again&s;t the continuance of other ordinances; and why it is advanced again&s;t the Laying on of Hands, we know not, excepting it is the ca&s;e, that we are only too great &s;trangers to the Spirit, in the capacity of a comforter. To illu&s;trate the propo&s;ition a little more, we will con&s;i|der a few pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture; and the fir&s;t we would pre&s;ent is Acts ii. 1&mdash;4.</P>
<P>Here we read of no other duty performed only a&s;&s;embling together in one place, when the extraordinary gifts were di&s;tributed.&mdash; Shall we rea&s;on from hence, becau&s;e the&s;e gifts do not attend our a&s;&s;embling together now, therefore, it is no duty? or &s;hall we not &s;ay, it was thereby confirmed as a duty? 2. When Peter and John prayed, the place where they were a&s;&s;embled was &s;haken; and they were all filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, Acts iv. 31. But &s;uch power and gifts of the Spirit do not now attend praying, &s;hall we therefore pray no more? hath it cea&s;ed to be a duty? 3. When Peter preached at the hou&s;e of Cornelius, the Holy Gho&s;t fell on all his hearers, and they &s;pake with tongues, Acts x. 44&mdash;46. But no &s;uch gifts now at|tend preaching, mu&s;t it therefore cea&s;e? If our brethren rea&s;on con&s;i&s;tently and are right, a&s;&s;embling, preaching, and praying are no longer to be performed, becau&s;e the extra|ordinary gifts do not attend them.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="019738_0026_0FACA705A1C8C208">
Perhaps &s;ome will object, that this was not the end propo&s;ed in the examples pro|duced. We grant it is the truth; and con|&s;tantly affirm, that the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit was not the end of Laying on of Hands in the in&s;tances produced; and there|fore the extraordinary gifts are an equally forcible argument for the continuance of it. Why do our brethren lay hands on mi|ni&s;ters at their ordination? There was a gift attended Timothy's ordination, 1 Tim. iv. 14. but none attends it now, mu&s;t it there|fore be performed no more? By no means, becau&s;e, almo&s;t all the divine in&s;titutions were at fir&s;t confirmed by &s;igns and won|ders, and divers gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t. Therefore, while meeting, preaching, pray|ing and ordination continue in the church, we mu&s;t conclude, from &s;imilar rea&s;oning, that Laying on of Hands &s;hould likewi&s;e continue, being confirmed by the extraor|dinary gifts of the Spirit.</P>
<P N="5">V. We come now to the la&s;t propo&s;ition, which was, That one end of this holy ordi|nance was to comfort, confirm and &s;trengthen true believers, by additional mea&s;ures and gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>From what has been already &s;aid, the read|er will &s;ee, that we con&s;ider the Holy Spirit in different points of view, bearing different appellations according to his work and rela|tion
<PB N="27" REF="019738_0027_0FACA706626E4520">to us. The Spirit of God doth regene|rate us, and therefore we are &s;aid to be born of the Spirit, John iii. 6. In this &s;piritual birth, he doth not act in the capacity of a comforter; but as a &s;pirit of &s;anctification and holine&s;s. This nece&s;&s;arily precedes his operations as a comforter. Perhaps, one rea&s;on of difficulties in the mind of &s;ome, may be for want of this di&s;tinction, re&s;pect|ing the Spirit of God; yet it is nece&s;&s;ary to be pre&s;erved, or we cannot under&s;tand what is meant by the Spirit's coming after the a&s;|cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and not before.</P>
<P>We are not to think, that God hath bound him&s;elf to any ordinance or duty, in &s;uch a manner, that when one is performed by us, the other mu&s;t be performed by him; he &s;till remains a &s;overeign, and may work, when, where, and in what manner he plea&s;|eth, yet he hath ordained in what manner we are to wait on him. And we are encou|raged, by his gracious promi&s;e, that they who wait on him, <HI>&s;hall renew their &s;trength,</HI> I&s;aiah xl. 31. Our attendance on all the divine in&s;titutions, is waiting on the Lord, and tho' we do not feel our &s;trength renew|ed, yet it is our duty to wait on him in his own appointments.</P>
<P>The Holy Gho&s;t, as a teacher and com|forter, is promi&s;ed by Chri&s;t, to all true be|lievers under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, John
<PB N="28" REF="019738_0028_0FACA707221C3168">xiv. 15, 16, 26. In this capacity, we re|ceive him. In this capacity, we may expect him in Laying on of Hands. In this capa|city, we believe, he &s;hall remain with his people to the end of the world; for in this capacity they need him, &s;eeing that no man can call Je&s;us Lord, but by the Holy Gho&s;t. The apo&s;tles were born of God long before Chri&s;t's a&s;cen&s;ion, yet they received not the Spirit, in his work and office as a comforter, till the day of Penteco&s;t.</P>
<P>We pre&s;ume no con&s;iderate chri&s;tian will &s;ay, that they received <HI>only</HI> the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, when the promi&s;e con|tained what is incomparably more excellent, even the Spirit of God him&s;elf in his office as a comforter. In this capacity, he increa&s;es every grace implanted in us as a Spirit of holine&s;s, till we grow up to the fulne&s;s of the &s;tature of a man in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid of the Ephe&s;ians, after that they believed, they were <HI>&s;ealed with that holy Spi|rit of promi&s;e,</HI> Eph. i. 13. mark the expre&s;|&s;ion, "after you believed," <HI>&amp;c.</HI> not before. The Holy Gho&s;t as a Spirit of &s;anctification works faith in us, and implants every grace in our hearts: the&s;e graces are increa&s;ed in us afterwards, by the power of the Holy Gho&s;t, hence we are &s;aid to grow in grace. Where he begins a good work, he carries it on to perfection, in the u&s;e of all the means ap|pointed
<PB N="29" REF="019738_0029_0FACA707E263AE30">by the head of the church; hence it is, that we wait on the Lord in the ordinance of Laying on of Hands, as well as others, for our growth of grace and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;ome may think, they have as much of the Spirit as tho&s;e, who &s;ubmit to the Laying on of Hands, and therefore it is not nece&s;&s;ary. Whoever rea&s;ons after this manner, &s;peaks not like a &s;ervant of the Lord, but rather a&s;&s;umes to be his ma&s;ter, who would dictate unto him. If any would choo&s;e to &s;hew their faith by di&s;obedience, we think it be&s;t to &s;hew our faith by obedi|ence. Peter's hearers received the bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t, neverthele&s;s they were baptized in the name of the Lord, and by the expre&s;s command of Peter.</P>
<P>Some people de&s;pi&s;e bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper, under pretence that they have all that is meant by tho&s;e outward things; &s;hall we conclude, that they &s;peak as chri&s;tians? or mu&s;t we not conclude that their language and conduct is unbecoming the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t? becau&s;e he hath appointed all his ordinances for our growth in grace. The apo&s;tle enumerates the graces implanted in the &s;oul, when it is born of God, which are the&s;e, <HI>viz. Love, joy, peace, long-&s;uffering, gentlene&s;s, goodne&s;s, faith, meekne&s;s, and tem|perance,</HI> Gal. v. 22, 23. Now the holy Spi|rit
<PB N="30" REF="019738_0030_0FACA708A28ADD70">as our comforter increa&s;es the&s;e graces, till we come to the fulne&s;s of the &s;tature of a man in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Verily, there is no|thing more wanted in all our churches, than greater mea&s;ures of the holy Spirit.</P>
<P>Here is cau&s;e of lamentation, that any di&s;|turbance hath been made, by the imprudent conduct of &s;ome of our brethren in the mini|&s;try. We are afraid they have not con&s;idered the con&s;equences of their conduct, for we are thereby in great danger of confu&s;ion in our churches, which will &s;oon end in a &s;eparation. The blame mu&s;t lie at their door, who admit members into the church without Laying on of Hands, for we are bound in con&s;cence to keep the ordinances as we received them; and are obliged to withdraw from every brother, who walketh di&s;orderly. I &s;hall conclude with a &s;hort addre&s;s to the churches.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dearly beloved in the Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"YE have now con&s;idered the arguments for the continuance of this holy ordinance. Whether they appear of force to you or not, they have confirmed me abundantly. By in|ve&s;tigating the &s;ubject, the objections again&s;t the in&s;titution appear groundle&s;s, and have had their ri&s;e chiefly from not con&s;idering the holy Spirit in his office as a comforter. The apo&s;tle exhorts us to content earne&s;tly for the faith once delivered to the &s;aints, and to be
<PB N="31" REF="019738_0031_0FACA70962DD00C8">perfectly joined together in the &s;ame mind, and in the &s;ame judgment, keeping the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. Beware of innovations.&mdash;Mark them who cau&s;e divi|&s;ions contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned. Study di&s;cipline. No article of faith &s;hould be left to vote either in a church, or an a&s;&s;ociation, for by following this ex|ample every truth may be voted away. Some di&s;pute the doctrine of prede&s;tination and election; was it left to vote, it would be ex|cluded from our Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, <HI>provi|ded</HI> the majority were <HI>Arminians.</HI> Let the word of Chri&s;t dwell richly in you, and pray for greater mea&s;ures of the holy Spirit; for it is the Spirit that can lead you into all truth, and &s;eal you to the day of redemption.</P>
<P>"We hope the &s;ubject has been &s;o explain|ed, that ye &s;ee plainly the apo&s;tles u&s;ed the Laying on of Hands, on believers, as &s;uch, and that it never was performed with any view of conferring the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit; the&s;e were di&s;tributed, when and where it plea&s;ed the holy Spirit, but no ordi|nance was in&s;tituted for that purpo&s;e. Some|times, they attended meeting, preaching, and praying, and &s;ometimes, they did not, even in the apo&s;tles days. No argument, worthy of notice, can be advanced from &s;uch di&s;tri|butions of the Spirit. One thing is certain, which is this, that once it was in practice,
<PB N="32" REF="019738_0032_0FACA70A229B3120">and none can be &s;ure, it &s;hould cea&s;e. Why &s;hould the peace of Zion be di&s;turbed for an uncertainty? If it cea&s;es to be adminiftered on believers, as &s;uch, you &s;ee, by &s;imilar rea|&s;oning, it &s;hould not be u&s;ed in the ordina|tion of mini&s;ters; therefore if any practi&s;e the one, and refu&s;e the other, we mu&s;t ac|cu&s;e them of incon&s;i&s;tency and partiality. Finally, beloved brethren, ye &s;ee your &s;itu|ation, ye are the temple of the Holy Gho&s;t. Grieve not the holy Spirit, whereby ye are &s;ealed to the day of redemption. Defile not the temple of the holy Spirit. Pray that your mini&s;ters may be filled with the Spirit, to &s;peak the word with clearne&s;s and bold|ne&s;s, and that ye your&s;elves may hear in the Spirit. The grace of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Gho&s;t, be with you all. <HI>Amen.</HI>"</P>
