It was on &s;uch a Day as this that the en&s;uing Di&s;cour|&s;es were delivered by our dear Brother to the People of his own Charge: and are now at the urgent De&s;ire of many of them made public from the Pre&s;s. The Reverend Author was peculiarly induc'd to this E&s;&s;ay from the melancholly Ob&s;ervation there is had of Chri&s;tians defectivene&s;s in their attending on Fa&s;t Solemnities.

<P>&mdash; Did ye at all Fa&s;t unto me, even to me?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE ble&s;&s;ed God did not leave the World to the Guidance of natural Light and Rea&s;on, that they might find him purely by his Works of Creation; but be&s;towed upon them the ine&s;timable Ble&s;&s;ing of &s;upernatural Revelation, thereby to bring Mankind to a more di&s;tinct and full Knowledge of their Duty. But it is ob&s;ervable, that the Revelation which God was pleas'd to make of his Mind, was gradual and various. He di&s;|cover'd his Will unto the Fathers at &s;undry times, before the De|luge by <HI>Enoch</HI> and <HI>Noah:</HI> After the Flood by <HI>Abraham, Jacob, Mo&s;es</HI> and all the Prophets; and in divers manners; &s;ometimes by immediate In&s;piration; &s;ometimes by a lively Voice; &s;ometimes by Signs and Wonders from Heaven, &s;ometimes by Dreams which are the Images or Re&s;emblances of things pre&s;ented to the Fancy in Sleep; and frequently by Vi&s;ions, which (as they &s;tand in Con|tra-di&s;tinction to Dreams) are the Repre&s;entations of things made to the open and waking Eye; for this Rea&s;on it is tho't the Pro|phets in old time us'd to be &s;tiled SEERS. In this la&s;t &s;en&s;e Al|mighty God revealed much of his Will to the Jewi&s;h Nation and People by the Prophet <HI>Zechariah:</HI> He was a Man authoriz'd, and commi&s;&s;ionated by Heaven, to call them to Repentance, and agre|able to the Power he was ve&s;ted with, and the true notation of his Name which is one mindful of the Lord, he was very ob&s;ervant of what he had received of the Lord to be delivered unto them.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003756_0006_100256956CD30960">
Hence, we find him in the beginning of this Book exhorting the Jews to return to God, a&s;&s;uring them (in his Name and Fear) that If they did &s;o the Lord of Ho&s;ts would return to them, but (it &s;eems) they were ob&s;tinate in their evil Cour&s;es, and refu&s;ed to return.

<P><PB N="3" REF="003756_0007_10025698F898D4A0">
Here's not only a Declaration of their In&s;incerity and Hypo|cri&s;y in their Fa&s;ting, but a mo&s;t &s;evere Reprimand given them by God him&s;elf for their profe&s;&s;ing to engage in a Bu&s;ine&s;s which they were not hearty in, that is to &s;ay, for fa&s;ting but not unto God. The Que&s;tion <HI>(Did ye at all fa&s;t? &mdash;)</HI> carries as much in it, and by the Repetition <HI>(unto me, even to me)</HI> is plainly &s;een what a va&s;t Stre&s;s God laid upon it; and therefore for their Non-ob&s;ervance of their Duty they ju&s;tly merited a Reproof from him.</P>
<P>Now &s;ince what&s;oever Things were written aforetime, were written for our In&s;truction and Admonition, who live in the la&s;t Ages of the World, the Rebuke in our Text may be of Service to us on this Day; which is con&s;ecrated and &s;et apart for religious Fa&s;ting and Prayer. Agreably,</P>
<P>In handling the&s;e Words I &s;hall ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>That &s;uch People as don't fa&s;t in a religious and &s;olemn Manner, certainly fall under the Rebuke of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>There are &s;ome People that don't fa&s;t in a &s;olemn and re|ligious Manner.</HI></P>
<P>They fa&s;t but not unto God. The Jews (it &s;eems) were noto|riou&s;ly guilty in this Point; and (it may be) there are &s;ome Pro|fe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity that are not entirely clear,</P>
<P>But here I mu&s;t Enquire &mdash;</P>
<P>Enq. <HI>When may a People be &s;aid to fa&s;t, but not in a &s;olemn and religious Manner?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>When they are only external and &s;uperficial in their Fa&s;ting.</HI></P>
<P>When they per&s;onate the Saints, put on a Vizard as it were only to act a part of Piety. There were &s;ome &s;uch People in the Days of our Saviour, as we read Matth. 6.16. <HI>Moreover, when ye fa&s;t, be not as the Hypocrites of a &s;ad Countenance: for they disfigure their Faces, that they may appear unto Men to fa&s;t: Verily I &s;ay unto you they have their Reward.</HI> And long before this, we have a very ju&s;t and natural de&s;cription of them by the evangelical Prophet, I&s;ai. 58.5. <HI>Is it &s;uch a Fa&s;t that I have cho&s;en, a Day for a Man to afflict his Soul?</HI> (a plain Allu&s;ion to Lev. 16.29. <HI>And this &s;hall be a Statute for ever unto you, that in the &s;eventh Month in the tenth Day of the Month, ye &s;hall afflict your Souls. &mdash;) Is it to bow down his Head as a Bulru&s;h, and to &s;pread Sackcloth, and A&s;hes und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r his Feet; wilt thou call this an acceptable Day to the Lord?</HI> q. d. Certainly ye
<PB N="4" REF="003756_0008_1002569A88D50450">can never have the Face to do it; for you know in your own Con|&s;ciences it is not &s;o. And yet it is to be feared, there are &s;ome to be found in our Day, and Age of the World; that &s;eem to wear a demure and unplea&s;ant Countenance; affect a &s;ad, and &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ournful Way of Speaking; or an indecent Garb, Ge&s;ture &amp;c. Indeed it is true, it is highly un&s;utable to the Solemnity of Fa&s;ting, to &s;ee People full of Mirth and Chearfulne&s;s, even as at other Times. Hence is that of the Prophet, I&s;ai. 22.12.13. <HI>Ard in that D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> did the Lord God of Ho&s;ts, call to Weeping, and to Mourning, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Baldn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s, and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> girding with Sackcloth, and behold Joy and Gladne&s;s, &s;taying O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n, ard kiling S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eep, eating Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h and dri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">king Wine.

As it was &s;poken to the Jews in the ver&s;e immediately following our Text, ver. 6. <HI>And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did ye not eat to your &s;elves, and drink to your &s;elves?</HI> Or be not ye they that do &s;o? You did it to an&s;wer your own Purpo&s;es, and not with an Intention to &s;erve and honour God. See Ho&s;ea 7.16. <HI>They return but not to the mo&s;t high: They are like a deceitful Bow.</HI></P>

<P>Some People there are when they pretend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fa&s;t, will freely ac|knowledge them&s;elves to be Sinners, and it may be Sinners before the Lord exceedingly, but it is meer Lip-&s;ervice, and does not pro|ceed from the Heart. It is not becau&s;e they have any real Sen&s;e of the infinite Malignity of Sin, as it di&s;parages the Excellencies of God; deba&s;es and degrades their Natures, as it defiles their own Souls, and terminates in their everla&s;ting Ruin; but &s;uch People do it becau&s;e it is cu&s;tomary to do it; they don't like to be &s;ingular, and out of the Mode of the Country, but would join with others in their devout and humble Acknowledgements at &s;uch a Time. &mdash;</P>

<P>People's Religion is not uniform and regular.

<P>The Jewi&s;h Nation and People were extremely formal and ce|remonious in their Wor&s;hip, but their Heart was wanting; I&s;ai. 29.13. <HI>Wherefore the Lord &s;aid, Fora&s;much as this People draw near me with their Mouths, and with their Lips do honour me, but have removed their Heart f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> from me, and their Fear towards me is taught by the Precept of Men.</HI> This our ble&s;&s;ed Lord ob&s;erved to the Jews in his Day, Matth. 15.7, 8, 9. <HI>Ye Hypocrites, well did E&s;aias prophe&s;y of you, &s;aying, This People draw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th nigh unto me with their Mouth, and honoureth me with their Lips, but their Heart is far from me. But in vein they do wor&s;hip me, teaching for doctrine the Commandments of Men.</HI> And it is to be feared the&s;e Words are awfully verified in Chri&s;ti|an Profe&s;&s;ors at this Day. God is near in their Mouth but far from their Reins. Their Heart is not right with God, neither are they &s;ound in his Statutes. They are not unhinged from them&s;elves. It is true what they do is required by God, and per|haps they will comply with a con&s;iderable Part of their Duty; but yet it is not from right Principles and for right Ends. They don't repent and turn to God in the Way which he has pre&s;crib'd: They don't repent in a Way of Humility, Faith, and Prayer. They don't turn to God with the whole Heart, and Soul; in Obedience to his Precept; and with a pure Aim, and Intention of advancing his Glory<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> In a Word, SELF is the prevailing Princi|ple in their Brea&s;ts.</P>
<P>Now it is for ever the Way and Manner of doing a thing in Religion that &s;tamps a Value on it, and gives it the Denomina|tion of virtuous or vicious; &s;o that without doubt People may re|pent (nay perform every Duty in Chri&s;tianity) as to the external Part, and yet for Want of doing it in a proper Manner, it is of no Significance or avail. Agreably we find God in&s;i&s;ting much
<PB N="7" REF="003756_0011_100256A308646060">on this in the &s;acred Oracles. Deut. 26.16. <HI>This Day the Lord thy God hath commanded thee to do the&s;e Statutes, and Judgments: thou &s;halt therefore keep and do them.</HI> How? It follows, <HI>with all thine Heart and with all thy Soul.</HI> Parallel to this is that Text, Prov. 23.26. <HI>My Son give me thine Heart,</HI> &mdash; and the true Rea&s;on we have a&s;&s;igned in 1 Sam. 16.7. &mdash; <HI>For the Lord &s;eeth not as Man &s;eeth; for Man looketh on the outward Appearance, but the Lord looketh on the Heart.</HI> For the Lord &s;earcheth all Hearts, and un|der&s;tandeth all the Imaginations of the Thoughts: If we therefore &s;eek him with our Heart, he will be found of us, but if that be wanting he will ca&s;t us off for ever. This is the Life and Soul in every Duty.</P>
<P>Some People there are, that will &s;eem to confe&s;s their Sins to Almighty God very freely, (it may be with Tears in their Eyes) They will bitterly lament their Pride, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, their Uncha|ritablene&s;s, their Malice, Envy, &amp;c. and if a Judgment were to be pronounc'd according to pre&s;ent outward Appearance, one would think them to be hone&s;t and &s;incere in the&s;e Things; but alas! how &s;oon do we &s;ee their Practi&s;es run counter to all their Pray|ers, Fa&s;ting and Humiliation? This is a Lamentation, and &s;hall be for a Lamentation &mdash; e&s;pecially con&s;idering what admirable Helps and Advantages we are all under to lead holy Lives.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>When their Repentance is only tran&s;ient and temporary.</HI></P>
<P>Repentance (whatever &s;ome may think of it) is not a &s;light Action; the Work of a Day that is pre&s;ently over; but it is a very great Work, the Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Per&s;on's whole Life: The Rea&s;on is mo&s;t plain and obvious to every one's Under&s;tanding; becau&s;e we are contracting new Guilt and Defilement every Day that we live; and therefore there is need of daily Repentance; neverthele&s;s it is to be feared that &s;ome People are ready to &s;atisfy them&s;elves with a general Repentance; They are for di&s;patching the Work at once; their Goodne&s;s is of very &s;hort Duration and Continuance. Thus we read concerning <HI>Ephraim</HI> of old, Ho&s;ea 6.4. <HI>O Ephraim, what &s;hall I do unto thee? O Judah what &s;hall I do unto thee? for your Goodne&s;s is as a morning Cloud, and as the early Dew it goeth away.</HI> It vani&s;hes almo&s;t as &s;oon as it appears.</P>
<P>To day po&s;&s;ibly they will be extremely religious, &s;ober, and de|vout, to morrow we &s;hall &s;ee them pur&s;uing their former evil Ways: To day perhaps they will not be per&s;waded to eat any thing or drink any thing &s;ave ju&s;t to &s;upply the Nece&s;&s;ities of Na|ture; anon we &s;hall find them drowned in &s;en&s;ual Exce&s;&s;es: To day grave, and mortify'd in their A&s;pect, and Deportment to a very great Degree; to morrow ju&s;t the Rever&s;e; full of Levity and Vanity.

To &s;peak in plain Language; Such People as the&s;e do only fa&s;t for a while; that they may return to their Sins with greater Loo&s;ene&s;s and Extravagance; ju&s;t like a Cour&s;e of Water that has been &s;top'd for &s;ome time, it becomes more rapid and violent when the Dam is taken away; &s;o the&s;e return with greater Greedi|ne&s;s after the Re&s;traint which was laid on them is off. <HI>But thus it is happened to them according to the true Proverb; as a Dog returneth to his Vomit, &s;o a Fool returneth to his Folly,</HI> (or as the Margin has it, <HI>Iterateth,</HI> i. e. repeateth his Fooli&s;hne&s;s) Which the Apo&s;tle cites from the wi&s;e Man, with &s;ome Addition and Enlargement; 2 Pet. 2.22. &mdash; <HI>The Dog is turned to his own Vomit again; and the Sow that was wa&s;hed to her wallowing in the Mire.</HI> What was &s;po|ken to the Jewi&s;h People, may with great Pertinency be applied to them; I&s;ai. 58.4. <HI>Behold, ye fa&s;t for Strife and Debate, and to &s;mite with the Fi&s;t of Wickedne&s;s; Ye &s;hall not fa&s;t as ye do this Day,</HI> (or as it might perhaps be better rendred, <HI>Ye fa&s;t not, at this Day: Ye fa&s;t not at all</HI>) <HI>to make your Voice to be beard on high.</HI></P>

<P>&mdash; Did ye at all Fa&s;t unto me, even to me?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_HAVING in the former part of this Day endeavour'd to &s;how when a People may be &s;aid to fa&s;t, but not in a religious and &s;olemn Manner, it is very proper and requi&s;ite that I pa&s;s now to make Enquiry.</P>
<P>Enq. <HI>When may a People be &s;aid to fa&s;t in a reli|gious and &s;olemn Manner?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>When there is a very deep Humiliation and Contrition of Soul for Sin.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed there may be &s;ome &s;ort of Shame and Humiliation, even in carnal and un&s;anctify'd People, wro't by the common Opera|tions of the divine Spirit, whereby they are made &s;orry, not after a godly but a worldly &s;ort, for they only fear the doleful Effects of God's Vengeance. They are not humbled for Sin as it is a|gain&s;t the great GOD; a Violation of his holy Law, and as it is exceeding &s;inful in it's very Nature, but only as it is de&s;tructive of their Happine&s;s. Now this Sorrow is entirely legal, and in the Language of Divinity, it is called ATTRITION: Thus <HI>Ahab, Judas,</HI> &amp;c. have been humbled; but where Humiliation is evan|gelical; &s;incere and acceptable to God, it will be inward, real and very powerful, it will proceed from a &s;trong and &s;en&s;ible Convic|tion of the evil Nature and Demerit of all Sin; and of their ba&s;e Ingratitude towards God, as well as a mo&s;t bloody Cruelty to their
<PB N="10" REF="003756_0014_100256A6E227D9C8">own precious Souls. Hence when they come to make Reflections on them&s;elves for their Sins, they will be deeply &s;orrowful there|for; They will not only expre&s;s their Concern in a few external <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gns of Grief and Sorrow, by Sights, Tears, or Gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns; but they will feel their Hearts burdened with Sin, and oppre&s;&s;ed with the heavy Load of Guilt lying on them, their Spirits will be wounded. How doleful tho&s;e Accents? P&s;al. 38.2 &mdash; 6 <HI>For thine Arrows &s;tick fa&s;t in me: and thy hand pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;eth me &s;ore. There is no Soundne&s;s in my Fle&s;h, becau&s;e of thine Anger: neither is there any Re&s;t in my Bones becau&s;e of my Sin. For mine Iniquities are ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e over mine Head: as an heaty Burden they are too heavy for me. My Wounds &s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k and are corrupt, becau&s;e of my Fooli&s;hne&s;s. I am troubled, I am bowed down greatly, I go mourning all the day long.</HI></P>
<P>Thus they will weep &s;orely; weep with all bitterne&s;s of Heart; mourn like a Dove; and chatter as a Swallow as did <HI>Hezekiah.</HI> Their Sorrow will be a mo&s;t pungent, afflictive Sorrow; &s;uch a Sorrow as hares the Sin &s;o much, that they now prefer Death to the Embraces of Lu&s;t. Behold, and &s;ee if there be any Sorrow like unto their Sorrow! &mdash;</P>
<P>Now &s;uch People as are thus &s;orrowfully affected, and moved with a Sen&s;e of Sin, may be &s;aid to fa&s;t in a &s;acred Manner. They certainly pre&s;ent Sacrifices well plea&s;ing to Heaven. P&s;alm 51.16, 17. <HI>For thou de&s;ire&s;t not Sacrifice, el&s;e would I give it: thou de|lighte&s;t not in Burnt-Offering. The Sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit: a broken and a contrite Heart, O God, thou wilt not de&s;pi&s;e.</HI> For thus &s;aith the high and lofty one, that inhabiteth Eternity, who&s;e Name is holy, I dwell in the high and holy Place; with him al&s;o that is of an humble and contrite Spirit, to revive the Spirit of the humble and the Heart of the contrite ones. To this Man will I look, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite Spirit, and that trembleth at my Word.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>When there is an earne&s;t &s;eeking Reconciliation with an offended Maje&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>And if we are duly humbled for Sin, this will nece&s;&s;arily en|&s;ue; we can't help imploring a &s;peedy Reconciliation with God whom we have offended. Now in order to this, we mu&s;t review our Conduct; carefully examine into our pa&s;t Life and Actions; &s;earch and try our Ways; ingenuou&s;ly, and freely acknowledge our Offences; manife&s;t our Hatred of them; judge and condemn our &s;elves before God on the Account of them. We mu&s;t like|wi&s;e renew our Friend&s;hip with the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t by a true Faith, grounding our entire Hopes of obtaining divine Mercy in the Merits of his mo&s;t precious Blood and Sacrifice; and to all this we mu&s;t oblige our &s;elves by the mo&s;t &s;trict Obligations to
<PB N="11" REF="003756_0015_100256AA70AFCE60">depart from Iniquity; to deny ungodline&s;s and every worldly Lu&s;t, and to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly; adorning the Doctrine of God our Saviour in all Things for the future. <HI>Sure|ly it is meet to be &s;aid unto God,</HI> as in Job 34 31. &mdash; <HI>I will not of|fend any more; If I have done Iniquity, I will do no more.</HI> What have I to do any more with Idols?</P>
<P>Now &s;uch People as earne&s;tly &s;eek a thorough Reconciliation with God in this Way may be &s;aid to fi&s;t in a religious and &s;o|lemn Manner. Indeed it is true, we ought every day to &s;eek Reconciliation, with God thro' his dear Son (for who can under|&s;tand his Errors?) but it is requi&s;ite in a &s;pecial Manner when we keep a Day to Fa&s;t, and pray to the Lord; then to make Reno|vation of our Friend&s;hip and Peace which we have violated in a great Variety of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;tances. This is very agreable to God, proper and &s;uitable to the Occa&s;ion of the Day, and an Evidence of our Heartine&s;s in what we are engaged in.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>When there is a &s;olemn Renewal of Covenant with God.</HI></P>
<P>We find this practi&s;ed in ancient times, 2 Kings 23.2, 3. <HI>And the King went up into the Hou&s;e of the Lord, and all the Men of Judah, and all the Inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem with him, and the Prie&s;ts, and the Prophets, and all the People, both &s;mall and great: and he read in their Ears all the Words of the Book of the Covenant which was found in the Hou&s;e of the Lord. And the King &s;tood by a Pillar and made a Cove|nant before the Lord to walk after the Lord, and to keep his Command|ments, and his Te&s;timonies, and his Statutes, with all their Heart, and with all their Soul, to perform the Words of this Covenant that were written in this Book: And all the People</HI> STOOD TO THE COVENANT. They &s;aid Amen to it; and con&s;ented to the Conditions of it. And &s;o we read, 2 Chron. 34.30, 31, 32. <HI>And the King went up into the Hou&s;e of the Lord and all the Men of Judah, and the Inhabi|tants of Jeru&s;alem, and the Prie&s;ts, and the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vites, &amp; the People great and &s;mall: And he read in their Ears all the Words of the Book of the Co|venant, that was found in the Hou&s;e of the Lord And the King &s;tood in his Place, and made a Covenant before the Lord, to walk after the Lord, and to keep his Commandments, and his Te&s;timonies, and his Sta|tutes, with all their Heart, and with all their Soul, to perform the Words the Covenant which were written in this Book. And he cau&s;ed all that were pre&s;ent in Benjamin and Jeru&s;alem, to &s;tand to it, and the inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem,</HI> DID ACCORDING TO THE COVENANT OF GOD, <HI>the God of their Fathers.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it was the good old Way to renew Covenant with God; and this was regi&s;tred undoubtedly for our Imitation. We mu&s;t remember that the Word is gone out of our Mouth: We have &s;worn to be true and faithful to the King of Heaven; and we can|not
<PB N="12" REF="003756_0016_100256ACE3924708">go back unle&s;s we draw back unto Perdition. When we vow a Vow unto God we mu&s;t not defer to pay it, for he has no Plea|&s;ure in Fools, therefore we ought to pay that which we have vow|ed. Better is it that we &s;hould not vow, than that we &s;hould vow and not pay. Now in order to a due and regular Di&s;charge of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Part of our Duty, we mu&s;t be unfeignedly &s;orry, and grieved for our Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s and Ba&s;ene&s;s: Pricked at the Heart becau&s;e we have &s;o frequently, and &s;hamefully broken Covenant with God. We mu&s;t bind our &s;elves more &s;trictly to fulfil the va&s;t Bonds and Engagements which we have laid our &s;elves under. We mu&s;t un|re&s;ervedly, and chearfully acquie&s;ce in the Di&s;po&s;e of our &s;elves; and &s;ubmit to the Terms of the Covenant which we have entred into with God and one another. And how weighty and &s;olemn a Tran&s;action is this?&mdash;It &s;eems therefore this is one Way to &s;anctify a Fa&s;t and ob&s;erve it in an holy Manner.</P>
<P>Agreably (as I am inform'd) &s;ome Churches in the Country make it a Practice to have the Church Covenant read and renew|ed in Publick on Fa&s;t-Days, that &s;o People may &s;ee their manifold Defects; be humbled for them; and led to reform what has been ami&s;s in any of their Conduct and Conver&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion; and I can't but think it would be well if this Cu&s;tom univer&s;ally obtained in our Churches. Certainly we have &s;ufficient Precedent for it; and it might (by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God) be one happy Expedient for pro|moting a glorious REFORMATION. &mdash; A Thing long wi&s;h'd and pray'd for! &mdash; Thus I believed, therefore have I &s;poken.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>When actual Repentance and Reformation follow on our Days of F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ting and Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>Whether we were &s;incere and hearty in our Fa&s;t Solemnities can be known only by our after-Life and Conver&s;e in the World. It is a mo&s;t infallible Rule, by their Fruits ye &s;hall know them. When People appear to be extraordinary zealous and devour, free <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o exclaim again&s;t all Sin and Immorality, on Fa&s;t-Days, and yet run in the&s;e very Irregularities a while after again&s;t which they &s;o lately cried out; what can any one judge but that their Fa&s;ting was only in &s;hew and appearance; therefore if after the Fa&s;t-Day is over the good Fruits of it are vi&s;ible in our Lives and Practices, then we fa&s;t to &s;ome Purpo&s;e. If our Fa&s;ting be a means to cre|ate in us a greater Hatred of all Sin, and in&s;pire us with a more ordent Love to God, his Ways, Wor&s;hip, and Ordinances; If our Fa&s;ting inclines and di&s;po&s;es us to be more humble, more patient, more charitable, more holy and heavenly minded; if we are henceforward the more fruitful in Works of Piety and Vertue; it demon&s;trates to all about us that we fa&s;ted in a religious and divine Manner.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="003756_0017_100256AE88B3FB48">
In fine,</P>
<P>When we turn from all tho&s;e Ways of Hypocri&s;y and Wick|edne&s;s in which we have hitherto indulged our &s;elves; and labour to attend all Duty that we have hitherto lived in the Omi&s;&s;ion of; and &s;uch Duties as we have ob&s;erved, to be more accurate and con&s;cientious in the Di&s;charge of them for the time to come: Such as we have performed well to endeavour to di&s;charge better: Then we keep a Day to the Lord our God; and &s;hall be owned and accepted by him. If we do well &s;hall we not be accepted? Ve|rily, When our Fa&s;ting and Devotion is fini&s;hed, the Work is not done; but indeed &s;o far is it from that, that the mo&s;t difficult and nece&s;&s;ary Part does then begin, which is to &s;ee that we regu|late our &s;elves wi&s;ely; and that all our Actions be corre&s;pondent to our &s;olemn Con&s;ecration of our &s;elves unto God, and Preten&s;ions to Piety. This is intirely con&s;onant to the Account of this Matter as it is laid down in the in&s;pired Writings. I&s;ai 58.6, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>Is not this the Fa&s;t that I have cho&s;en? to loo&s;e the Bands of Wickedne&s;s, to undo the heavy Burdens, and to let the oppre&s;&s;ed go free, and that ye break eve|ry Yoke.

<P>And now. What do'n the Lord our God require of us (to prove the Sincerity of our Fa&s;ting) but to do ju&s;tly, to love Mer|cy, and walk humbly with our God. This for the fir&s;t Propo|&s;ition.</P>

<P>This will appear by con&s;idering the Nature of an hypocritical Fa&s;ting.</P>
<P>Now, this is no other than a mo&s;t horrible Attempt to impo&s;e on God who cannot be deceived, and will by no means be mock|ed. It is no &s;mall Di&s;paragement to the glorious Perfections of the divine Nature; e&s;pecially the Attribute of God's Omni&s;cience. Certainly if we have any ju&s;t and &s;utable Apprehen&s;ions of the &s;upreme Being, we mu&s;t needs conclude that if we pretend to fa&s;t in a religious Manner, but don't do it, we play the Hypocrite with God; act in di&s;gui&s;e, and expo&s;e our &s;elves to his &s;evere Di&s;plea|&s;ure</P>

This is likewi&s;e evident by remembring the &s;ad Providences of God that many times befall &s;uch in the pretent Life, as are not &s;in|cere and hearty in their Fa&s;ting.

Now, whenever it is thus they may expect that the&s;e terrible Judgments that have been inflict|ed on others will come upon them likewi&s;e, the pre&s;ent State being the only State to puni&s;h them in, as they are a People. Shall not God vi&s;it &s;uch a People as are equally guilty with a like Puni&s;hment even in this Life? Shall not his Soul be avenged on &s;uch a Nation?</P>
<P>To add no more;</P>
<P>The ble&s;&s;ed God has been plea&s;ed to &s;ignify his Re&s;entment of People's hypocritical Managements in his HOLY WORD. Parti|cularly we may turn to that Text, I&s;ai. 1.11, &mdash; 15. <HI>To what purpo&s;e is the Multitude of your Sacrifices unto me? &s;aith the Lord: I am full of the burnt offerings of Rams, and the Fat of fed Bea&s;ts and I delight not in the Blood of Bull<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cks, or of He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">goats.

<P N="1">1. <HI>What we have heard &s;erves to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow to us or when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Rebuke is like to fall.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis on tho&s;e that fa&s;t in Word and Tongue only, not indeed and in Truth; that make great outward Pretences of Sanctity and Holine&s;s, but don't take Care to li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e amirerably thereunto; that confe&s;s their Sins over and over again, but don't u&s;e their be&s;t En|deavours to for&s;ake them; or that relinqui&s;h &s;ome particular Vices that are po&s;&s;ibly di&s;agre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble to their natural Humour, and Incli|nation; and oppo&s;ite to their &s;ecular Intere&s;t, (and to give the fi|ni&s;hing Stroke in their Character) their Goodne&s;s is very tran&s;i|ent and uncertain.</P>
<P>Now &s;uch as the&s;e are vertuous (if indeed they may be &s;o de|nominated) to invert the Apo&s;tle's Words, nor willingly, but by Con&s;traint, and they &s;hall &s;urely fall under the Wrath and Anger of Almighty God. If they are &s;pared and forborn, we are not to imagine it is becau&s;e he in the lea&s;t likes, or approves their Acti|ons, but it is only to fill up the Mea&s;ure of their Iniquiries and ripen them for the mo&s;t di&s;mal Puni&s;hment. See Lev. 26.21&mdash;24. <HI>And if ye wale contrary unto me, and will not bearken unto me; I will bring &s;even times more Plagues upon you according to your Sins,</HI> &amp;c. God will &s;et his Face again&s;t &s;uch a People for Evil. The Wrath of God will burn again&s;t them like Fire till they are utterly con|&s;umed.

<P>For certainly if God is highly di&s;plea&s;ed with &s;uch as fa&s;t, but not in a religious and &s;olemn Manner, then we may conclude he will commend and applaud tho&s;e that are found in the contrary Practice; &s;uch as rent their Hearts in pieces for their Sins, that are filled with the mo&s;t bitter Remor&s;e and Confu&s;ion at the Remem|brance of their pa&s;t Guilt; that humble them&s;elves before God, and repent in Du&s;t and A&s;he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, who&s;e Fa&s;ting &s;ets a keener Edge on their Devotions, turns to the Nouri&s;hment of their Souls, and growth in Grace; the Mortification of who&s;e Spirit is joined with that of the Fle&s;h, and (to compleat all) who&s;e Reformation i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> uniform, univer&s;al, and darable.

<P N="3">III. <HI>What we have heard &s;hould put us upon the mo&s;t impartial Ex|amination of our &s;elves this Day.</HI></P>
<P>Self-Examination is a Duty always incumbent on us, but e&s;peci|ally on Fa&s;t-Days. This is a Sea&s;on wherein it is mo&s;t beautiful. Let us all therefore retire within our own Bo&s;oms, and &s;oberly ask our &s;elves, <Q>What have we been doing the&s;e many Years that God has &s;pared us in the World? We have had a &s;pace for Re|pentance and many &s;olemn Warnings again&s;t our evil Cour&s;es, and loud Calls to a thorough Repentance and Amendment of our Lives, but may it not be &s;aid concerning us, I gave them a &s;pace to repent, and they repented not: They are not humbled even unto this Day! We have 'tis true fa&s;ted many a time, and pre|tended to humble our Souls before God but to what good Effect? Can we &s;ay that we are more circum&s;pect and unblameable in our Conduct as to God and Man? Do we reap any &s;piritual and &s;aving Benefit by all our Fa&s;ting and Prayers? Can we find that our Souls grow the more healthy and pro&s;perous? In all this time have we fa&s;ted unto God, even unto God?</Q> Certainly &s;uch Queries as the&s;e put to our Con&s;ciences and a comfortable Re&s;o|lution of them are of the greate&s;t Importance in the whole World.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>What we have heard &s;hould therefore prevail with us to fa&s;t in a &s;ared and religious Manner.</HI></P>
<P>The Words of the in&s;pired Apo&s;tle de&s;erves a &s;pecial Remark on this Occa&s;ion, Rom. 14 6. <HI>He that regardeth the Day, regardeth it to the Lord; and be that regardeth not the Day to the Lord, he doth not regard it.</HI> &mdash; If we don't an&s;wer the De&s;ign of our Fa&s;ting to what Purpo&s;e is it to fa&s;t? Verily, It is a meer piece of Mockery, hardens us in our vicious Courtes; gives Satan (our avowed Ad|ver&s;ary) a mighty Advantage again&s;t us, and is di&s;ta&s;tful both to God and Man.</P>
<P>What Arguments &s;hall I u&s;e to urge and per&s;wade us to a due Sanctification of a Fa&s;t? Two only I &s;hall mention at this time.&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>God is exceeding de&s;irous of it.</HI></P>
<P>He waits upon us that he may &s;ee us a humble, holy and re|formed People; a peculiar People zealous of all good Works. His Bounty (in the various Expre&s;&s;ions of it) is de&s;igned to lead us to unfeig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed Repentance. God earne&s;tly be&s;eeches and wi&s;hes our Reformation, his Bowels yern towards us, and he is extremely loth
<PB N="17" REF="003756_0021_100256B845214738">to abandon us to our own fooli&s;h Choice, i. e. to final De&s;truction. How pathetic that Language? Jer. 13.27.&mdash;<HI>Wilt thou not be made clean? When &s;hall it once be?</HI> Agreable hereto is that in Ho&s;ea 11 8, 9. <HI>How &s;hall I give thee up, Ephraim? How &s;hall I deliver thee, I&s;rael? How &s;hall I make thee as Adma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">? and &s;et thee as Zebo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m? Mine Heart is turned within me, my Repentings are kindled together. I will not exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ute the Fiercene&s;s of mine Anger, I will not return to de&s;troy Ep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">aim; for I am God, and not Man, the holy One in the mid&s;t of thee, and I will not enter into the City.</HI> Mo&s;t woundrous Words the&s;e! The Almighty &s;eems to be at a &s;tand (as it were) how to manage.</P>
<P>And now &s;han't we all &s;trive to gratify God, who is continually doing Good to us, e&s;pecially when we do hereby &s;o very much con|&s;ult our own greate&s;t Intere&s;t, and Felicity. Certainly if we have the lea&s;t Spark of Gratitude or Ingenuity in our Brea&s;ts, or any true Love to our &s;elves, we &s;hall pre&s;ent our Souls and Bodies to him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Our own Circum&s;tances at the pre&s;ent Day require this at our Hands.</HI></P>
<P>The Face of Affairs looks black and di&s;mal whither&s;oever we ca&s;t our Eyes, whither on Nations, Kingdoms, Cities, Towns, par|ticular Societies, or Churches. How melancholly to take a &s;ur|vey? &mdash; What Feuds, Animo&s;ities, Di&s;&s;entions, &amp;c are almo&s;t every where? &mdash; Surely not a little of our GLORY is departed from us! And none can tell what Changes are in the right hand of the mo&s;t High. Truly the Pro&s;pect is mo&s;t dull and cloudy! If we turn our Tho'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s on our &s;elves and remember our Mi&s;carri|ages, we have rea&s;on to fear our Pro&s;perity won't continue a great while, but that Thunder, and Earthquake, and great Noi&s;e with Storm and Tempe&s;t, and the Flame of devouring Fire do await us, that Drought and Sickne&s;s, and the doleful Alarms of War are not far off. &mdash; Happy they who are prepared to meet God in the Way of his terrible Judgments! &mdash; Now all the&s;e Cala|mities (which we feel or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">r) are procured by our Wickedne&s;s, and hence we can rationally expect to have them removed or pre|vented, and the Marks of divine Favour vouch&s;afed us unle&s;s we &s;peedily and heartily turn to the Lord our God. Shan't we all therefore learn Wi&s;dom, at lea&s;t for this time, and readily fall in with that mo&s;t gracious Invitation? Ho&s;ea 6.1. <HI>Come and let us re|turn unto the Lord: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath &s;mit|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, and he will bind us up.</HI> Of the &s;ame Tenor is that in Chap. 10.12. <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w to your &s;elves in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, reap in Mercy: break <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> your fallow Gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d: for it is time to &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k the Lord, till be come and rain down Righteou&s;ne&s;s upon you.</HI> O let it not be &s;aid concerning any one Soul of us, as concerning tho&s;e in Ver&s; 11, 12. of the Chap|ter before as. <HI>But they refu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> away the Shoul|der,

<P>And now to clo&s;e all &mdash;</P>
<P>O Lord God of <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac,</HI> and <HI>I&s;rael</HI> our Fathers, keep the&s;e Things for ever, in the Imagination of the Hearts of thy People, and prepare their Hearts unto thee! AMEN.</P>
