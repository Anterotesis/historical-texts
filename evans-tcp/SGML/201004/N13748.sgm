<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>FEW characters among the nobility of this age and nation are better known than that of the late ingenious and witty EARL of CHESTERFIELD; who was alike di&s;tingui&s;hed in the polite, the political, and the learned circles. With a great portion of good &s;en&s;e, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a perfect know|ledge of mankind; he was a complete gen|tleman, and a delightful companion. Ble&s;t with &s;uch rare talents and amiable qualities, no man &s;urely was ever more happily quali|fied to a&s;&s;ume the PRECEPTOR, and to dic|tate A SYSTEM OF EDUCATION.</P>
<P>In this character, however, it is more than probable his Lord&s;hip would never have appeared, had he not, luckily for po&s;terity, had a NATURAL SON, (by one MADAME DU BOUCHET, a French Lady), whom he loved, and cheri&s;hed, with all the fondne&s;s of a father, and who&s;e education was for many years the chief engagement of his life.</P>
<P>The following &s;heets contain his Lord|&s;hip's ADVICE to that SON, whom he meant to form, what he was him&s;elf, an all-ac|compli&s;hed man; and in which the Reader is pre&s;ented with a &s;election of his Lord|&s;hip's mo&s;t beautiful thoughts on various &s;ubjects; his judicious Remarks on MEN and MANNERS, and u&s;eful Ob&s;ervations to form the MAN of VIRTUE, TASTE, and FASHION.</P>

<HEAD>LORD CHESTERFIELD's ADVICE TO HIS SON.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ABSENCE OF MIND.</HEAD>
<P>AN ab&s;ent Man is generally either a ve|ry weak, or a very affected man; he is, however, a very di&s;agreeable man in com|pany. He is defective in all the common of|fices of civility; he does not enter into the general conver&s;ation, but breaks into it from time to time, with &s;ome &s;tarts of his own, as if he waked from a dream. He &s;eems wrap|ped up in thought, and po&s;&s;ibly does not think at all: he does not know his mo&s;t inti|mate acquaintance by &s;ight, or an&s;wers them
<PB N="2" REF="017372_0009_0FA110C00A2AFF30">as if he were at cro&s;s purpo&s;es. He leaves his hat in one room, his cane in another, and would probably leave his &s;hoes in a third, if his buckles though awry, did not &s;ave them. This is a &s;ure indication, either of a mind &s;o weak that it cannot bear above one object at a time; or &s;o affected, that it would be &s;up|po&s;ed to be wholly ingro&s;&s;ed, by &s;ome very great and important objects. Sir I&s;aac New|ton, Mr. Locke, and perhaps five or &s;ix more &s;ince the creation, may have had a right to ab&s;ence, from the inten&s;e thought their in|ve&s;tigations required.</P>
<P>No man is, in any degree, fit for either bu&s;ine&s;s or conver&s;ation, who does not com|mand his attention to the pre&s;ent object he what it will. When I &s;ee a man ab&s;ent in mind, I choo&s;e to be ab&s;ent in body; for it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for me to &s;tay in the room, as I cannot &s;tand inattention and awkward|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I would rather be in company with a dead man, than with an ab&s;ent one; for if the dead man affords me no plea&s;ure at lea&s;t he &s;hows me no contempt; whereas the ab&s;ent man very plainly, though &s;ilently, tells me that he does not think me worth his attenti|on. Be&s;ides, an ab&s;ent man can never make any ob&s;ervations upon the characters, cu&s;toms and manners of the company. He may be in the be&s;t companies all his life-time, (if
<PB N="3" REF="017372_0010_0FA110C10B2EC718">they will admit him) and never become the wi&s;er: we may as well conver&s;e with a deaf man, as an ab&s;ent man. It is indeed a prac|tical blunder to addre&s;s our&s;elves to a man, who we plainly perceive neither hears, minds, nor under&s;tands us.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ATTENTION.</HEAD>
<P>A MAN is fit for neither bu&s;ine&s;s nor plea|&s;ure, who either cannot, or does not, command and direct his attention to the pre|&s;ent object, and in &s;ome degree, bani&s;h, for that time, all other objects from his thoughts. If at a ball, a &s;upper, or a party of plea&s;ure, a man were to be &s;olving, in his own mind, a problem in Euclid, he would be a very bad companion, and make a poor figure in that company; or if, in &s;tudying a problem in his clo&s;et, he were to think of a minuet, I am apt to believe that he would make a very poor mathematician.</P>
<P>There is time enough for every thing, in the cour&s;e of the day, if you do but one thing at once; but there is not time enough in the year, if you will do two things at a time.</P>
<P>This &s;teady and undi&s;&s;ipated attention to one object is a &s;ure mark of a &s;uperior geni|ns;
<PB N="4" REF="017372_0011_0FA110C185459048">as hurry, bu&s;tle and agitation, are the never-failing &s;ymptoms of a weak and frivo|lous mind.</P>
<P>Indeed, without attention nothing is to be done: want of attention, which is really want of thought, is either folly or madne&s;s. You &s;hould not only have attention to every thing, but a quickne&s;s of attention, &s;o as to ob&s;erve at once, all the people in the room; their motions, their looks, and their words; and yet without &s;taring at them, and &s;eeming to be an ob&s;erver. This quick and unob&s;erved ob&s;ervation is of infinite advantage in life, and is to be acquired with care; and, on the contrary, what is called ab&s;ence, which is a thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s and want of attention about what is doing, makes a man &s;o like either a fool or a madman, that, for my part, I &s;ee no real difference. A fool never has thought; a madman has loft it; and an ab&s;ent man is, for the time, without it.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the mo&s;t material knowledge of all, I mean the knowledge of the world, is never to be acquired without great attention; and I know many old people, who, though they have lived long in the world, are but children &s;till as to the knowledge of it, from their levity, and inattention. Certain forms, which all people comply with, and certain arts, which all people aim at, hide, in &s;ome degree, the truth, and give a general exterior
<PB N="5" REF="017372_0012_0FA110C6194256D0">re&s;emblence to almo&s;t every body. Attenti|on and &s;agacity mu&s;t &s;ee thro' that veil, and di&s;cover the natural character.</P>
<P>Add to this, there are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> attentions which are infinitely engaging, and which &s;en&s;ibly affect that degr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of pride and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olf love which is in&s;eparable from human nature; as they are unque&s;tionable proofs of the regard and con|&s;ideration which we have for the per&s;ons to whom we pay them. As for example<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Sup|po&s;e you invited any body to dine or &s;up with you, you ought to recollect if you had ob&s;erv|ed that they had any favourite di&s;h, and tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> care to provided it for them, and when it came, you &s;hould &s;ay, <Q>You &s;eemed to me, at &s;uch and &s;uch a place, to give this di&s;h pre|ference, and therefore ordered it. This is the wine that I ob&s;erved you like, and therefore I procured &s;ome.</Q> Again: Mo&s;t people have their weakne&s;&s;es; they have their aver&s;ions or their likings to &s;uch or &s;uch things. If we were to laugh at a man for his aver&s;ion to a cat or chee&s;e (which are common antipa|thies,) or by inattention or negligence, to let them come in his way where we could pre|vent it; he would in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, think him|&s;elf in&s;ulted; and in the &s;econd &s;lighted; and would remember both. But, on the other hand, our care to procure for him what he likes, and to remove from him what he di&s;|likes,
<PB N="6" REF="017372_0013_0FA110C7C60B93B0">&s;hews him that he is at lea&s;t an object of our attention, flatters his vanity, and per|haps makes him more your friend, than a more important &s;ervice would have done. The more trifling the&s;e things are, the more they prove your attention for the per&s;on, and are con&s;equently the more engaging. Con&s;ult your own brea&s;t, and recollect how the&s;e little attentions, when &s;hewn you by others, flatter that degree of &s;elf-love and vanity from which no man living is free. Reflect how they in|cline and attract you to that per&s;on, and how you are propitiated afterwards to all which that per&s;on &s;ays or does. The &s;ame cau&s;es will have the &s;ame effects in your favour.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>AWKWARDNESS OF DIF|FERENT KINDS.</HEAD>
<P>MANY very worthy and &s;en&s;ible peo|ple have certain odd tricks, ill habits, and awkwardne&s;s in their behaviour, which excite a di&s;gu&s;t to and di&s;like of their per|&s;ons, that cannot be removed or overcome by any other valuable endowment or merit which they may po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>Now, awkwardne&s;s can proceed but from too cau&s;es; either from not having kept good company, or from not having attended to it.</P>
<P>When an awkward fellow fir&s;t comes into
<PB N="7" REF="017372_0014_0FA110C91A812FD0">a room, it is highly probable, that his &s;word gets between his legs, and throws him down, or makes him &s;tumble, at lea&s;t; when he has recovered this accident, he goes and places him|&s;elf in the very place of the whole room where he &s;hould not; there he &s;oon lets his hat fall down, and, in taking it up again, throws down his cane; in recovering his cane, his hat falls a &s;econd time: &s;o that he is a quarter of an hour before he is in order again. If he drinks tea or coffee, he certainly &s;calds his mouth, and lets either the cup or the &s;au|cer fall, and &s;pills the tea or coffee in his breeches. At dinner, his awkwardne&s;s di&s;tin|gui&s;hes it&s;elf particularly, as he has more to do: there be holds his knife, fork and &s;poon, differently from other people; eats with his knife to the great danger of his mouth, picks his teeth with his fork, and puts his &s;poon, which has been in his throat twenty times, into the di&s;hes again. If he is to carve, can never hit the joint; but in his vain efforts to cut through the bone, &s;catters the &s;auce in every body's face. He generally daubs him|&s;elf with &s;oup and grea&s;e, though his napkin is commonly &s;tuck through a button hole, and tickles his chin. When he drinks, he infallibly coughs in his gla&s;s, and be&s;prinkles the company. Be&s;ides all this he has &s;trange tricks and ge&s;tures; &s;uch as &s;nuffing up his
<PB N="8" REF="017372_0015_0FA110C9D510D280">no&s;e, or blowing it, and looking afterwards in his handkerchief, &s;o as to make the com|pany &s;ick. His hands are trouble&s;ome to him when he has not &s;omething in them, and he does not know where to put them: but they are in perpetual motion between his bo&s;om and his breeches: he does not wear his clothes, and in &s;hort, does nothing like other people. All this, I own, is not in any degree criminal; but it is highly di&s;|agreeable and ridiculous in company, and ought mo&s;t carefully to be avoided by who|ever de&s;ires to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>From this account of what you &s;hould not do, you may ea&s;ily judge what you &s;hould do, and a due attention to the manners of people of fa&s;hion, and who have &s;een the world, will make it habitual and familiar to you.</P>
<P>There is, likewi&s;e, an awkwardne&s;s of ex|pre&s;&s;ion and words mo&s;t carefull to be avoided; &s;uch as fal&s;e Engli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, bad pro|nunciation, old &s;ayings, and common pro|verbs; which are &s;o many pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fs of having kept bad and low company. For example: if, in&s;tead of &s;aying that <Q>ta&s;tes are dif|ferent, and that every man has his own peculiar one,</Q> you &s;hould let off a proverb, and &s;ay, that <Q>what is one man's meat is another man's porion:</Q> or el&s;e, <Q>every one as they like, as the good man &s;aid when he ki&s;&s;ed his cow,</Q> every body
<PB N="9" REF="017372_0016_0FA110CA87EC9C38">would be per&s;uaded that you had never kept company with any body above footmen and hou&s;e maids.</P>
<P>There is likewi&s;e an awkwardne&s;s of the mind, that ought to be, and with care may be, avoided: as for in&s;tance: to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;take or forget names; to &s;peak of Mr. What-d'ye-call-him, or Mrs. Thingum, or How d'ye-call her, is exce&s;&s;ively awkward and ordinary. To call people by improper titles and appel|lations is &s;o too; as my Lord, for Sir; and Sir, for my Lord. To begin a &s;tory or a narration when you are not perfect in it, and cannot go through with it, but are forced, po&s;&s;ibly to &s;ay, in the middle of it, "I have forgot the re&s;t," is very unplea&s;ant and bungling. One mu&s;t be extremely exact, clear, and per&s;picuous in every thing one &s;ays; otherwi&s;e, in&s;tead of entertaining or in|forming others, one only tires and puzzles them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>BASHFULNESS.</HEAD>
<P>BASHFULNESS is the di&s;tingui&s;hing character of an Engli&s;h booby, who appears freightened out of his wits if people of fa&s;hion &s;peak to him, and blu&s;hes and &s;tammers without being able to give a proper
<PB N="10" REF="017372_0017_0FA110CB47522928">an&s;wer; by which means he becomes truly ridiculous from the groundle&s;s fear of being laughed at.</P>
<P>There is a very material difference between mode&s;ty and awkward ba&s;hfulne&s;s, which is as ridiculous as true mode&s;ty is commendable: it is as ab&s;urd to be a &s;impleton as to be an impudent fellow; and we make our&s;elves contemptible, if we cannot come into a room and &s;peak to people without being out of countenance, or without embarra&s;&s;ment. A man who is really diffident, timid, and ba&s;h|ful, be his merit what it will, never can pu&s;h him&s;elf in the world, his de&s;pondency throws him into inaction, and the forward, the bu&s;tling, and the petulent will always pre|cede him. The manner makes the whole difference. What would be impudence in one man, is only a proper and decent a&s;|&s;urance in another. A man of &s;en&s;e, and of knowledge of the world, will a&s;&s;ert his own rights, and pur&s;ue his own objects as &s;teadily and intrepidly as the mo&s;t impudent man living, and commonly more &s;o; but then he has art enough to give an outward air of mode&s;ty to all he does. This engages and prevails, whil&s;t the very &s;ame things &s;hock and fail, from the over-bearing or im|pudent manner only of doing them.</P>
<P>Engli&s;hmen, in general, are a&s;hamed of going into company, when we avoid &s;ingu|larity,
<PB N="11" REF="017372_0018_0FA110CC1C948B28">what &s;hould we be a&s;hamed of? And why &s;hould not we go into a mixed company, with as much ea&s;e, and as little concern, as we would go into our own room? Vice and ignorance are the only things we ought to be a&s;hamed of: while we keep clear of them, we may venture any where without fear or concern. Nothing &s;inks a young man into low company &s;o &s;urely as ba&s;hfulne&s;s. If he thinks that he &s;hall not, he mo&s;t &s;urely will not plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Some, indeed, from feeling the pain and inconveniencies of Ba&s;hfulne&s;s, have ru&s;hed into the other extreme, and turned impudent, as cowards &s;ometimes grow de&s;perate from exce&s;s of danger: but this is equally to be avoided, there being nothing more generally &s;hocking than impudence. The medium be|tween the&s;e two extremes points out the well-bred man, who always feels him&s;elf firm and ea&s;y in all companies: who is mode&s;t without being ba&s;hful, and &s;teady without being impudent.</P>

A well bred man will conver&s;e with his inferiors without in&s;olence, and with his &s;uperiors with re&s;pect, and with ea&s;e. Add to this, that a man of a gentleman-like be|haviour, though of inferior parts, is better received than a man of &s;uperior abilities, who is unacquainted with the world. Mode&s;ty, and a polite, ea&s;y a&s;&s;urance, &s;hould be united.</P>

<HEAD>COMPANY.</HEAD>
<P>TO keep good company, e&s;pecially at our fir&s;t &s;etting out, is the way to re|ceive good impre&s;&s;ions. Good company is not what re&s;pective &s;etts of good company are plea&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ither to call or think them&s;elves. It con&s;i&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hiefly (though not wholly) of peo|ple of con&s;iderable birth, rank, and cha|racter; for people of neither birth nor rank are frequently and very ju&s;tly admitted into it, if di&s;tingui&s;hed by any peculiar merit, or eminency in any liberal art or &s;cience. So motely a thing is good company, that many people, without birth, rank, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> me it, intrude
<PB N="13" REF="017372_0020_0FA110D0604F4938">into it by their own forwardne&s;s, and others get into it by the protection of &s;ome con&s;i|derable per&s;on. In this fa&s;hionable good company, the be&s;t manners and the pure&s;t language are mo&s;t unque&s;tionably to be learnt: for they e&s;tabli&s;h and give the <HI>ton</HI> to both, which are called the language and manners of good company; neither of them being a&s;certained by any legal tribunal.</P>
<P>A company of people of the fir&s;t quality cannot be called good company, in the com|mon acceptation of the phra&s;e, unle&s;s they are the fa&s;hionable and accredited company of the place; for people of the fir&s;t quality can be as &s;illy, as ill bred, and as worthle&s;s as people of the meane&s;t degree. And a company, con&s;i&s;ting wholly of people of a very low condition, whatever their merit or talents may be, can never be called good company; and therefore &s;hould not be much frequented, tho' by no means de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>A company wholly compo&s;ed of learned men, though greatly to be re&s;pected, is not meant by the words GOOD COMPANY: they cannot have the ea&s;y and poli&s;hed manner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the world, as they do not live in it. If we can bear our parts well in &s;uch a company, it will be proper to be in it &s;ometimes, and we &s;hall be more e&s;teemed in other companies for having a place in that.</P>
<P>A company con&s;i&s;ting wholly of profe&s;&s;ed
<PB N="14" REF="017372_0021_0FA110D182884508">wits and poets, is very inviting to young men, who are plea&s;ed with it if they have wit them&s;elves; and if they have none, are fool|i&s;hly proud of being one of it. But &s;uch companies &s;hould be frequented with modera|tion and judgment. A wit is a very unpo|pular denomination, as it carries terror along with it; and people are as much afraid of a wit in company, as a woman is of a gun, which &s;he &s;uppo&s;es may go off of it&s;elf, and do her a mi&s;chief. Their acquaintance, however, is worth &s;eeking, and their com|pany worth frequenting; but not exclu&s;ively of others, nor to &s;uch a degree as to be con&s;i|dered only of one of that particular &s;ett.</P>
<P>Above all things, endeavour to keep com|pany with people above you; for there you ri&s;e, as much as you &s;ink with people below. When I &s;ay company above you, I do not mean with regard to their birth; but with regard to their merit, and the light in which the world con&s;iders them.</P>
<P>There are two &s;orts of good company; one, which is called BEAU MONDE, and con&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e people which have the lead in courts, and in the gay part of life; the other con|&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e who are di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ome particular merit, or who excel in &s;ome par|ticular and valuable arts or &s;cience.</P>
<P>Be equally careful to avoid that low com|pany, which, in every &s;en&s;e of the word, is
<PB N="15" REF="017372_0022_0FA110D21A1F7448">low indeed; low in rank, low in its parts, low in manners, and low in merit. Vanity, that &s;ource of many of our follies, and of &s;ome of our crimes, has &s;unk many a man into company in every light infinitely below him, for the &s;ake of being the fir&s;t man in it. There he dictates, is applauded, and admir|ed: bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he &s;oon di&s;graces him&s;elf, and di&s;|qualifies him&s;elf for any better company.</P>
<P>Having thus pointed out what company you &s;hould avoid, and what company you &s;hould a&s;&s;ociate with, I &s;hall next lay down a few
<LB>RULES FOR BEHAVIOUR IN COMPANY.</P>
<P>When a young man, new in the world, fir&s;t gets into company, he determines to conform to and imitate it. But he too often mi&s;takes the object of his imitation. He has frequently heard the ab&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m of genteel and fa&s;hionable vices. He there ob&s;erves &s;ome people who &s;hine and who in gene|ral are admired and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;teemed; and perceives that the&s;e people are rakes, drunkards, or game&s;ters; he therefore adopts their vices, mi&s;taking their defects for their perfections, and imagining that they owe their fa&s;hion and their lu&s;tre to the&s;e g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">el vice. But it is exactly the rever&s;e; for the&s;e people have ac|quired the reputation by their parts, their learn|ing,
<PB N="16" REF="017372_0023_0FA110D2CD4D9038">their good breeding, and other real ac|compli&s;hments; and are only blemi&s;hed and lowered in the opinions of all rea&s;onable peo|ple, by the&s;e general and fa&s;hionable vices. It is therefore plain, that in the&s;e mixed cha|racters, the good part only makes people for|give but not approve the bad.</P>
<P>If a man &s;hould unfortunately have any vices, he ought at lea&s;t to be content with his own, and not adopt other people's. The a|doption of vice has ruined ten times more young men than natural inclinations.</P>
<P>Let us imitate the real perfections of the good company into which we may get; copy their politene&s;s, their carriage, their addre&s;s, and the ea&s;y and well-bred turn of their conver|&s;ation; but we &s;hould remember, that, let them &s;hine ever &s;o bright, their vices, if they have any, are &s;o many blemi&s;hes, which we would no more endeavour to imitate, than we would make artificial warts upon our faces becau&s;e &s;ome very hand&s;ome man had the misfortune to have a natural one upon his. We &s;hould, on the contrary, think how much hand&s;omer he would have been without it.</P>

<HEAD>FRIENDSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>YOUNG per&s;ons have commonly an unguarded frankne&s;s about them, which makes them the ea&s;y prey and bubbles of the artful and the experienced: they look upon every knave, or fool, who tells them that he is their friend, to be really &s;o; and pay that profe&s;&s;ion of &s;imulated friend&s;hip with an indi&s;creet and unbounded confi|dence, always to their lo&s;s, often to their ruin. Beware of the&s;e proffered friend&s;hips. Re|ceive
<PB N="33" REF="017372_0040_0FA110E711F82C88">them with great civility, but with great incredulity too; and pay them with compli|ments, but not with confidence. Do not &s;uppo&s;e that people become friends at fir&s;t &s;ight, or even upon a &s;hort acquaintance. Real friend&s;hip is a &s;low grower; and never thrives, unle&s;s ingrafted upon a &s;tock of known and reciprocal merit.</P>
<P>There is another kind of nominal friend|&s;hip among young people, which is warm for the time, but luckily of &s;hort duration. This friend&s;hip is ha&s;tily produced, by their being accidentally thrown together, and pur|&s;uing the &s;ame cour&s;e of riot and debauchery. A fine friend&s;hip, truly! and well cemented with drunkenne&s;s and lewdne&s;s. It &s;hould rather be called a con&s;piracy again&s;t morals and good manners, and be puni&s;hed as &s;uch by the civil magi&s;trate.

<HEAD>GOOD-BREEDING.</HEAD>
<P>GOOD-BREEDING has been very ju&s;tly defined to be <Q>the re&s;ult of much good &s;en&s;e, &s;ome good-nature, and a little &s;elf|denial for the &s;ake of others, and with a view to obtain the &s;ame indulgence from them.</Q></P>
<P>Good-breeding alone can prepo&s;&s;e&s;s people in our favour at fir&s;t &s;ight; more time being nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cover greater talents. Good-breeding, however, does not con&s;i&s;t in low bows, and formal ceremony, but in an ea&s;y, civil, and re&s;pectable behaviour.</P>
<P>Indeed, good &s;en&s;e, in many ca&s;es, mu&s;t determine good-breeding; for what would be civil at one time, and to one per&s;on, would be rude at another time, and to another per|&s;on: there are, however, &s;ome general rules of good-breeding. As for example: To an|&s;wer only yes, or no, to any per&s;on, without adding Sir, My Lord, or Madam (as it may happen) is always extremely rude; and it is
<PB N="36" REF="017372_0043_0FA110E995AB6CA0">equally &s;o not to give proper attention and a civil an&s;wer, when &s;poken to: &s;uch behavi|our convinces the per&s;on who is &s;peaking to us, that we de&s;pi&s;e him, and do not think him worthy of our attention, or an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>A well-bred per&s;on will take care to an|&s;wer with complai&s;ance when he is &s;poken to; will place him&s;elf at the lower end of the ta|ble, unle&s;s bid to go higher; will fir&s;t drink to the lady of the hou&s;e, and then to the ma&s;|ter; he will not eat awkwardly or dirtily, nor &s;it when others &s;tand; and he will do all this with an air of complai&s;ance, and not with a grave ill-natured look, as if he did it all un|willingly.</P>
<P>There is nothing more difficult to attain, or &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to po&s;&s;e&s;s, as perfect good-breeding; which is equally incon&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tiff formality, an impertinent forwardne&s;s, and an awkward ba&s;hfulne&s;s. A little cere|mony is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary, a certain de|gree of firmne&s;s is ab&s;olutely &s;o: and an awkward mode&s;ty is extremely becoming.</P>
<P>Virtue and learning, like gold, have their intrin&s;ic value; but if they are not poli&s;hed, they certainly lo&s;e a great deal of their lu&s;tre: and even poli&s;hed bra&s;s will pa&s;s upon more people than rough gold. What a num|ber of fins does the chearful, ea&s;y, good-breeding of the French frequently cover!</P>
<P>My Lord Bacon &s;ays, <Q>That a plea&s;ing
<PB N="37" REF="017372_0044_0FA110EB66002A28">figure is a perpetual letter of recommenda|tion.</Q> It is certainly an agreeable fore|runner of merit, and &s;mooths the way for it.</P>
<P>A man of good-breeding &s;hould be ac|quainted with the forms and particular cu&s;toms of Courts. At Vienna, men always make curt&s;ies in&s;tead of bows, to the Emperor; in France, nobody bows to the King, or ki&s;&s;es his hand; but, in Spain and England, bows are made, and hands are ki&s;&s;ed. Thus every Court has &s;ome peculiarity, which tho&s;e who vi&s;it them ought previou&s;ly to inform them|&s;elves of, to avoid blunders and awkward|ne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Very few, &s;carcely any, are wanting in the re&s;pect which they &s;hould &s;how to tho&s;e whom they acknowledge to be infinitely their &s;upe|riors. The man of fa&s;hion, and of the world, expre&s;&s;es it in its fulle&s;t extent; but naturally ea&s;ily, and without concern: whereas a man, who is not u&s;ed to keep-good company, ex|pre&s;&s;es it awkwardly: one &s;ees that he is not u&s;ed to, and that it co&s;ts him a great deal: but I never &s;aw the wor&s;t-bred man living, guilty of lolling, whi&s;tling, &s;cratching his head, and &s;uch-like indecencies, in company that he re&s;pected. In &s;uch companies, there|fore, the only point to be attended to is, to &s;how that re&s;pect, which every body means to &s;how, in an ea&s;y, unembarra&s;&s;ed, and graceful manner.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="017372_0045_0FA110EC05BC8568">
In mixed companies, whoever is admitted to make part of them, is, for the time at lea&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ed to be upon a footing of equality with the re&s;t; and, con&s;equently, every one claims, and very ju&s;tly, every mark of civility and good-breeding. Ea&s;e is allowed, but care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s and negligence are &s;trictly forbidden. If a man acco&s;ts you, and talks to you ever &s;o dully or frivolou&s;ly; it is wor&s;e than rude|ne&s;s, it is brutality, to &s;how him, by a ma|nife&s;t inattention to what he &s;ays, that you think him a fool or a blockhead, and not worth hearing. It is much more &s;o with regard to women; who, of whatever rank they are, are entitled, in con&s;ideration of their &s;ex, not only to an attentive, but an officious good-breeding from men. Their little wants, likings, di&s;likes, preferences, antipathies, fancies, whims, and even impertinencies, mu&s;t be officiou&s;ly attended to, flattered, and, if po&s;&s;ible, gue&s;&s;ed at and anticipated, by a well-bred man. You mu&s;t never u&s;urp to your&s;elf tho&s;e conveniencies and <HI>agremens</HI> which are of common right: &s;uch as the be&s;t places, the be&s;t di&s;hes, &amp;c. but, on the con|trary, always decline them your&s;elf, and of|fer them to others; who, in their turns, will offer them to you; &s;o that, upon the whole you will, in your turn, enjoy your &s;hare of common right.</P>
<P>The third &s;ort of good-breeding is local,
<PB N="39" REF="017372_0046_0FA110F14FB81410">and is variou&s;ly modified, in not only differ|ent countries, but in different towns of the &s;ame country. But it mu&s;t be founded upon the two former &s;orts; they are the matter; to which, in this ca&s;e, Fa&s;hion and Cu&s;tom only give the different &s;hapes and impre&s;&s;ions. Whoever has the two fir&s;t &s;orts, will ea&s;ily acquire this third &s;ort of good-breeding, which depends &s;ingly upon attention and ob|&s;ervation. It is properly the poli&s;h, the lu&s;tre, the la&s;t fini&s;hing &s;trokes of good-breeding. A man of &s;en&s;e therefore carefully attends to the local manners of the re&s;pective places where he is, and takes for his models tho&s;e per&s;ons whom he ob&s;erves to be at the head of the fa&s;hion and good-breeding. He watches how they addre&s;s them&s;elves to their &s;uperi|ors, how they acco&s;t their equals, and how they treat their inferiors; and lets none of tho&s;e little niceties e&s;cape him; which are to good-breeding, what the la&s;t delicate and ma&s;terly touches are to a good picture: and which the vulgar have no notion of, but by which good judges di&s;tingui&s;h the ma&s;ter. He attends even to their air, dre&s;s and mo|tions, and imitates them liberally, and not &s;ervilely; he copies, but does not mimic. The&s;e per&s;onal graces are of very great con|&s;equence. They anticipate the &s;entiments, before merit engage the under&s;tanding; they
<PB N="40" REF="017372_0047_0FA110F59BAA32F8">captivate the heart and give ri&s;e, I believe, to the extravagant notions of Charms and Philters. Their effects were &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing, that they were reckoned &s;upernatural.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, as it is nece&s;&s;ary to po&s;&s;e&s;s learn|ing, honour, and virtue, to gain the e&s;teem and admiration of mankind, &s;o politene&s;s and good-breeding are equally nece&s;&s;ary to render us agreeable in conver&s;ation, and common life. Great talents are above the generality of the world; who neither po&s;&s;e&s;s them them&s;elves, nor are competent judges of them in others: but all are judges of the le&s;&s;er talents, &s;uch as civility, affability, and an agreeable addre&s;s and manner; becau&s;e they feel the good effects of them, as making &s;ociety ea&s;y and agreeable.</P>
<P>To conclude; be a&s;&s;ured that the pro|founde&s;t learning, without good-breeding, is unwelcome and tire&s;ome pedantry, that a man who is not perfectly well bred, is unfit for good-company, and unwelcome in it; and that a man, who is not well-bred, is full as unfit for bu&s;ine&s;s as for company.</P>
<P>Make, then, good breeding, the great ob|ject of your thoughts and actions.

<P>The graces of the per&s;on, the countenance, and the way of &s;peaking, are e&s;&s;ential things; the very &s;ame thing, &s;aid by a genteel per&s;on, in an engaging way, and gracefully and di&s;|tinctly &s;poken, would plea&s;e: which would &s;hock if muttered out by an awkward figure, with a &s;ullen &s;erious countenance.

<P>If we examine our&s;elves &s;eriou&s;ly, why particular people plea&s;e and engage us, more than others of equal merit; we &s;hall always find that it is becau&s;e the former have the graces, and the latter not. I have known many a woman, with an exact &s;hape, and a &s;ymetrical a&s;&s;emblage of beautiful features, plea&s;e nobody; while others, with very mo|derate &s;hapes and features have charmed every body. It is certain that Venus will not charm &s;o much without her attendant Graces, as they will without her. Among men, how often has the mo&s;t &s;olid merit been neglected, un|welcome,

<HEAD>Dre&s;s and dancing.</HEAD>
<P>Dre&s;s is one of the various in|gredients that contribute to the art of plea&s;ing, and therefore an object of &s;ome attention; for we cannot help forming &s;ome opinion of a man's &s;en&s;e and character from his dre&s;s. All af|fectation in dre&s;s, implies a flaw in the un|der&s;tanding. Men of &s;en&s;e carefully avoid any particular character in their dre&s;s; they are accurately clean for their own &s;ake, but all the re&s;t is for the &s;ake of other people. A man &s;hould dre&s;s as well, and in the &s;ame manner, as the people of &s;en&s;e and fa&s;hion of the place where he is: if he dre&s;&s;es more than they, he is a fop; if he dre&s;&s;es le&s;s, he is unpardonably negligent: but, of the two,
<PB N="49" REF="017372_0056_0FA10E530CD6D5B0">a young fellow &s;hould be rather too much than too little dre&s;&s;ed; the exce&s;s of that &s;ide will wear off, with a little age and re|flection.</P>
<P>The difference in dre&s;s between a man and a fop, is, that the fop values him&s;elf upon his dre&s;s; and the man of &s;en&s;e laughs at it, at the &s;ame time that he knows that he mu&s;t not neglect it: there are a thou&s;and fooli&s;h cu&s;toms of this kind, which, as they are not criminal, mu&s;t be complied with, and even chearfully, by men of &s;en&s;e. Diogenes the Cynic was a wi&s;e man for de&s;pi&s;ing them, but a fool for &s;hewing it.</P>
<P>We &s;hould not attempt to rival, or to excel a fop in dre&s;s, but it is nece&s;&s;ary to dre&s;s to avoid &s;ingularity, and ridicule. Great care &s;hould be taken to be always dre&s;&s;ed like the rea&s;onable people of our own age in the place where we are, who&s;e dre&s;s is never &s;poken of one way or another, as neither too negligent, or too much &s;tudied.</P>
<P>Awkwardne&s;s of carriage is very alienating, and a total negligence of dre&s;s and air, an im|pertinent in&s;ult upon cu&s;tom and fa&s;hion. Women have great influence as to a man's fa&s;hionable character; and an awkward man will never have their votes, which are very numerous, and oftener counted than weighed.</P>
<P>When we are once well-dre&s;&s;ed for a day, we &s;hould think no more of it afterwards;
<PB N="50" REF="017372_0057_0FA10E53EE4C3BE0">and, without any &s;tiffne&s;s for fear of di&s;com|po&s;ing that dre&s;s we &s;hould be as ea&s;y and natural as if we had no clothes on at all.</P>

<P>In dancing, the motion of the arms &s;hould be particularly attended to, as the&s;e decide a man's being genteel or otherwi&s;e, more than any other part of the body. A twi&s;t or &s;tiff|ne&s;s in the wri&s;t will make a man look awk|ward. If a man dances well from the wai&s;t upwards, wears his hat well, and moves his head properly, he dances well. Coming into a room, and pre&s;enting your&s;elf to a com|pany &s;hould be al&s;o attended to, as this al|ways gives the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, which is often indelible. Tho&s;e who pre&s;ent them&s;elves well, have a certain dignity in their air which, without the lea&s;t &s;eeming mixture of pride, at once engages and is re&s;pected.</P>

<HEAD>Vulgar ex|pre&s;&s;ions.</HEAD>
<P>Vulgari&s;m in language is a cer|tain characteri&s;tic of bad company, and a bad education. Proverbial expe&s;&s;ions, and trite &s;ayings, are the flowers of the rhetoric of a vulgar man. Would he &s;ay, that men differ in their ta&s;tes; he both &s;upports and adorns that opinion, by the good old &s;aying, as he re&s;pectfully calls it, "What is one man's meat, is another man's poi&s;on." If any body attempts being <HI>&s;mart,</HI> as he calls it, upon him, he gives them <HI>tit for tat,</HI> aye, that he does. He has always &s;ome favourite word for the time being; which for the &s;ake of u&s;ing often, he commonly abu&s;es: &s;uch as <HI>va&s;tly</HI> angry, <HI>va&s;tly</HI> kind, <HI>va&s;tly</HI> hand&s;ome, and <HI>va&s;tly</HI> ugly. Even this pronunciation of pro|per
<PB N="58" REF="017372_0065_0FA10E5B604AA9A0">words, carries the mark of the bea&s;t along with it. He calls the earth <HI>yearth:</HI> He is <HI>obleiged,</HI> not <HI>obliged</HI> to you. He goes <HI>to wards</HI> and not <HI>towards</HI> &s;uch a place. He &s;ometimes affects hard words, by way of or|nament, which he always mangles like a learned woman. A man of fa&s;hion never has recour&s;e to proverbs, and vulgar apho|ri&s;ms; u&s;es neither favourite words, nor hard words: but takes great care to &s;peak very correctly and grammatically, and to pro|nounce properly; that is, according to the u&s;age of the be&s;t companies.</P>

<HEAD>Cautions again&s;t &s;undry odd ba|bits.</HEAD>
<P>Humming a tune within our&s;elves, drumming with our &s;ingers, making a noi&s;e with your feet, and &s;uch awkward habits being all breaches of good manners, are therefore in|dications of our contempt for the per&s;ons pre&s;ent, and con&s;equently &s;hould not be prac|ti&s;ed.</P>
<P>Lating very quick, or very &s;low, is cha|racteri&s;tic of vulgarity; the former infers poverty; the latter, if abroad, that you are di&s;gu&s;ted with your entertainment; and if at home, that you are rude enough to give your friends what you cannot eat your&s;elf. Eating &s;oup with your no&s;e in the plate, is al&s;o vul|gar. So likewi&s;e is &s;melling to the meat while on the fork, before you put it in your

<P>Spitting on the floor or carpet is a filthy practice, and which, were it to become ge|neral, would render it as nece&s;&s;ary to change the carpets as the table-cloths. Not to add, it will induce our acquaintance to &s;uppo&s;e that we have not been u&s;ed to genteel furni|ture; for which rea&s;on alone, if for no other, a man of liberal education &s;hould avoid it.</P>
<P>To conclude this article: Never walk fa&s;t in the &s;treets, which is a mark of vulgarity, ill-befitting the character of a gentleman or a man of fa&s;hion, though it may be tolerable in a trade&s;man.</P>
<P>To &s;tare any per&s;on full in the face, whom you may chance to meet, is an act al&s;o of ill-breeding; it would &s;eem to be&s;peak as if you &s;aw &s;omething wonderful in his appear|ance, and is therefore a tacit reprehen&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hould endeavour to hoard up, while we are young, a great &s;tock of know|ledge: for though during that time of di&s;&s;i|pation, we may not have occa&s;ion to &s;pend much of it, yet a time will come when we &s;hall want it to maintain us.</P>
<P>The knowledge of the world is only to be acquired in the world, and not in a clo&s;et. Books alone will never teach it you; but they will &s;ugge&s;t many things to your ob|&s;ervation, which might otherwi&s;e e&s;cape you; and your own ob&s;ervations upon mankind, when compared with tho&s;e which you will find in books, will help you to fix the true point.</P>
<P>To know mankind well, requires full as much attention and application as to know books, and, it may be, more &s;agacity and di&s;cernment. I am, at this time, acquainted with many elderly people, who have all pa&s;&s;|ed their whole lives in the great world, but with &s;uch levity and inattention, that they know no more of it now than they did at fifteen. Do not flatter your&s;elf, therefore, with the
<PB N="61" REF="017372_0068_0FA10E60876E2920">thoughts that you can acquire this knowledge in the frivolous chit-chat of idle companies; no, you mu&s;t go much deeper than that. You mu&s;t look into people, as well as at them. Search therefore, with the greate&s;t care, into the characters of all tho&s;e whom you conver&s;e with; endeavour to di&s;cover their predominant pa&s;&s;ions, their prevailing weakne&s;&s;es, their vanities, their follies, and their humours; with all the right and wrong, wi&s;e and &s;illy &s;prings of human actions, which make &s;uch incon&s;i&s;tent and whim&s;ical beings of us rational creatures.</P>
<P>There are no per&s;ons &s;o in&s;ignificant and incon&s;iderable, but may, &s;ome time or other, and in &s;ome thing or other, have it in their power to be of u&s;e to you; which they cer|tainly will not, if you have once &s;hown them contempt. Wrongs are often forgiven, but contempt never is. Our pride remembers it forever. Remember therefore, mo&s;t carefully to conceal your contempt, however ju&s;t, wherever you would not make an implacable enemy. Men are much more unwilling to have their weakne&s;&s;es and their imperfections known, than their crimes; and if you hint to a man that you think him filly, ignorant, or even ill-bred or awkward, he will hate you more, and longer than if you tell him, plain|ly, that you think him a rogue.</P>

A con&s;tant attention to plea&s;e, is a mo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary ingredient in the art of plea&s;ing; it flatters the &s;elf-love of tho&s;e to whom it is &s;hewn; it engages and captivates, more than things of much greater importance. Every man is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, obliged to di&s;charge the &s;ocial duties of life; but the&s;e attentions are voluntary acts, the free-will offerings of good-breeding and good-nature: they are received, remembered, and returned as &s;uch.

<P>We &s;hould never yield to that temptation, which to mo&s;t young men is very &s;trong, of expo&s;ing other people's weakne&s;&s;es and infir|mities, for the &s;ake either of diverting the company, or of &s;hewing our own &s;uperiority.

<P>There are many inoffen&s;ive arts which are nece&s;&s;ary in the cour&s;e of the world, and which he who practi&s;es the earlie&s;t, will plea&s;e the mo&s;t, and ri&s;e the &s;oone&s;t. The &s;pirits and vivacity of youth are apt to neglect them as u&s;ele&s;s, or reject them as trouble&s;ome; but &s;ub&s;equent knowledge and experience of the world remind us of their importance com|monly when it is too late. The principal of the&s;e things, is the ma&s;tery of one's temper, and that coolne&s;s of mind and &s;erenity of coun|tenance, which hinders us from di&s;covering, by words, actions, or even looks, tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions or &s;entiments by which we are inwardly moved or agitated; and the di&s;covery of which gives cooler and abler people &s;uch in|finite advantages over us, not only in great bu&s;ine&s;s, but in all the mo&s;t common occur|rences of life.

<P>If you find your&s;elf &s;ubject to &s;udden &s;tarts of pa&s;&s;ion, or madne&s;s, (for I &s;ee no difference between them, but in their duration) re&s;olve, within your&s;elf, at lea&s;t, never to &s;peak one word while you feel that emotion within you.</P>

In any point, which prudence bids you pur&s;ue and which a mani|fe&s;t utility attends, let difficulties only ani|mate your indu&s;try, not deter you from the pur&s;uit.

For my own part, though I would by no means give up any point to a competitor, yet I would pique my&s;elf upon &s;howing him rather more civility than to another man.

There would be no living in the world, if one could not conceal and even di&s;&s;emble the ju&s;t cau&s;es of re&s;ent|ment which one meets with every day in ac|tive and bu&s;y life. Whoever cannot ma&s;ter his humour, &s;hould leave the world, and re|tire to &s;ome hermitage in an unfrequented de|fart.

If you would particularly gain the affection and friend&s;hip of particular people, whether men or women, endeavour to find our their predominant excellency, if they have one, and their prevailing weakne&s;s, which every body has; and do ju&s;tice to the one, and &s;omething more than ju&s;tice to the other.

As for example: Cardinal Richlieu, who was undoubtedly the able&s;t &s;tate&s;man of his time, or perhaps of any other, had the idle vanity of being thought the be&s;t poet too; he envied the great Corneille his reputation, and ordered a critici&s;m to be written upon the CID.

<P>Women have, in general, but one object, which is their beauty; upon which &s;carce any flattery is too gro&s;s for them to &s;wallow.

If they are both bad, &s;he comforts her&s;elf, that &s;he has graces; a certain manner; IE NE SCAIS QUOI, &s;till more engaging than beauty. This truth is evident, from the &s;tudied and elaborate dre&s;s of the uglie&s;t women in the world. An undoubted, unconte&s;ted, con&s;ci|ous Beauty, is, of all women, the lea&s;t &s;en|&s;ible of flattery upon that head: &s;he knows it is her due, and is therefore obliged to no|body for giving it her.

Civility, which is a dipo&s;ition to accommodate and oblige others, is e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame in every country; but good-breeding, as it is called, which is the manner of exerting that di&s;po&s;i|tion, is different in almo&s;t every country, and merely local; and every man of &s;en&s;e imitates and conforms to that local good-breeding of the place which he is at.&mdash;A conformity and flexibility of manners is nece&s;&s;ary in the cour&s;e of the world; that is, with regard to all things which are not wrong in them&s;elves.

<P>Young men are apt to think that every thing is to be carried by &s;pirit and vigour; that art is meanne&s;s, and that ver&s;atility and complai|&s;ance are the refuge of pu&s;illanimity and weakne&s;s. This mo&s;t mi&s;taken opinion gives an indelicacy, an abruptne&s;s, and a rough|ne&s;s to the manners.

<P>But unfortunately, young men are as apt to think them&s;elves wi&s;e enough, as drunken men are to think them&s;elves &s;ober enough.

<HEAD>LYING.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is more criminal, mean, or ridiculous, than Lying. It is the pro|duction either of malice or cowardice, or va|nity; but it generally mi&s;&s;es of its aim in every one of the&s;e views; for lies are always detect|ed &s;ooner or later. If we advance a malicious lye, in order to affect any man's fortune or character, we may, indeed, injure him for &s;ome time, but we &s;hall certainly be the great|e&s;t &s;ufferers in the end; for as &s;oon as we are detected, we are bla&s;ted for the infamous at|tempt: and whatever is &s;aid afterwards to the di&s;advantage of that per&s;on, however true, pa&s;|&s;es for calumny. To lie, or to equivocate, (which is the &s;ame thing) to excu&s;e our&s;elves

To remove a pre|&s;ent danger, by equivocating, evading, or &s;huffling, is &s;omething &s;o de&s;picable, and be|trays &s;o much fear, that whoever practi&s;es them de&s;erves to be cha&s;ti&s;ed.</P>
<P>There are people who indulge them&s;elves in another &s;ort of lying, which they reckon innocent, and which in one &s;en&s;e is &s;o; for it hurts nobody but them&s;elves.

<HEAD>DIGNITY OF MANNERS.</HEAD>
<P>A CERTAIN dignity of manners is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to make even the mo&s;t valuable character either re&s;pected or re|&s;pectable in the world.</P>
<P>Hor&s;e-play, romping, frequent and loud fits of laughter, jokes, waggery, and indi&s;|criminate familiarity, will &s;ink both merit and knowledge into a degree of contempt. They compo&s;e at mo&s;t a merry fellow, and a merry fellow was never yet a re&s;pectable man. In|di&s;criminate familiarity either offends your &s;uperiors, or el&s;e dubbs you their dependent, and led captain. It gives your inferiors ju&s;t, but trouble&s;ome and improper claims of equa|lity. A joker is near akin to a buffoon; and neither of them is the lea&s;t related to wit. Whoever is admitted or &s;ought for, in com|pany, upon any other account than that of his merit and manners, is never re&s;pected there, but only made u&s;e of. We will have &s;uch a one, for he &s;ings prettily; we will in|vite &s;uch a one to a ball, for he dances well; we will have &s;uch a one to &s;upper, for he is always joking and laughing; we will a&s;k ano|ther, becau&s;e he plays deep at all games, or becau&s;e he can drink a great deal. The&s;e are all vilifying di&s;tinctions, mortifying pre|ferences, and exclude all ideas of e&s;teem and regard. Whoever <HI>is had</HI> (as it is called (in
<PB N="83" REF="017372_0090_0FA10EE48A50A3E8">company, for the &s;ake of any one thing &s;ing|ly, is &s;ingly that thing, and will never be con&s;idered in any other light; and con&s;e|quently never re&s;pected, let his merits be what they will.</P>
<P>Dignity of manners is not only as different from pride, as true courage is from blu&s;ter|ing, or true wit from joking; but is ab&s;olute|ly incon&s;i&s;tent with it; for nothing vilifies and degrades more than pride. The pre|ten&s;ions of the poor man are oftener treated with &s;heer and contempt, than with indigna|tion; as we offer ridiculou&s;ly too little to a trade&s;man, who a&s;ks ridiculou&s;ly too much for his goods: but we do not haggle with one who only a&s;ks a ju&s;t and rea&s;onable price.</P>
<P>Abject flattery and indi&s;criminate a&s;&s;enta|tion degrade, as much as indi&s;criminate con|tradiction and noi&s;y debate di&s;gu&s;t. But a mode&s;t a&s;&s;ertion of one's own opinion, and a complai&s;ant acquie&s;cence to other people's, pre&s;erve dignity.</P>
<P>Vulgar, low expre&s;&s;ions, awkward motions and addre&s;s, vilify as they imply either a very low turn of mind, or low education and low company.</P>
<P>Frivolous curio&s;ity about trifles, and a la|borious attention to little objects, which nei|ther require nor de&s;erve a moment's thought, lower a man; who from thence is thought (and not unju&s;tly) incapable of greater matters.

<P>A certain degree of exterior &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s in looks and motions, gives dignity without excluding it and decent chearfulne&s;s, which are always &s;erious them&s;elves. A con&s;tant &s;mirk upon the face, and a whiffling acti|vity of the body, are &s;trong indications of futility. Whoever is in a hurry, &s;hews that the thing he is about is too big for him. Ha&s;te and hurry are very different things.</P>
<P>To conclude: A man who has patiently been kicked, may as well pretend to courage, as a man, bla&s;ted by vices and crimes, may to dignity of any kind. But an exterior de|cency and dignity of manners, will even keep &s;uch a man longer from &s;inking, than other|wi&s;e he would be.

The warm, choleric man, with &s;trong animal &s;pirits, de&s;pi&s;es the fir&s;t, and thinks to carry all before him by the la&s;t. He may, po&s;&s;ibly, by great accident, now and then &s;ucceed, when he has only weak and timid to deal with; but his general fate will be, to &s;hock, offend, be hated, and fall. On the other hand, the cunning, crafty man, thinks to gain all his ends by gentlene&s;s of manners only: <HI>he becomes all things to all men:</HI> he &s;eems to have no opinion of his own, and &s;ervilely adopts the pre&s;ent opinion of the pre&s;ent per&s;on; he in&s;inuates him&s;elf only into the e&s;teem of fools, but is &s;oon detected, and &s;urely de&s;pi&s;ed by every body el&s;e. The wi&s;e man (who differs as much from the cun|ning, as from the choleric man) alone joins foftne&s;s of manners with firmne&s;s of mind.</P>
<P>The advantages ari&s;ing from an union of the&s;e quali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies, are equally &s;triking and ob|vious. For example: If you are in authority, and have a right to command, your com|mands delivered with mildne&s;s and gentlene&s;s, will be willingly, chearfully, and con&s;equent|ly well obeyed: whereas, if given brutally,
<PB N="86" REF="017372_0093_0FA10EEA502F6AD8">they will rather be interpreted than executed. For a cool &s;teady re&s;olution &s;hould &s;how, that where you have a right to command, you will be obeyed; but at the &s;ame time, a gentlene&s;s in the manner of enforcing that obedience, &s;hould make it a cheerful one, and &s;often, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the mortify|ing con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of inferiority.</P>
<P>If you are to a&s;k a favour, or even to &s;oli|cit your due, you mu&s;t do it with a GRACE, or you will give tho&s;e, who have a mind to refu&s;e you either, a pretence to do it, by re|&s;enting the manner; but on the other hand, you mu&s;t, by a &s;teady per&s;everance and de|cent tenaciou&s;ne&s;s &s;hew firmne&s;s and re&s;oluti|on. The right motives are &s;eldom the true ones of men's actions, e&s;pecially of people in high &s;tations; who often give to impor|tunity and fear, what they would refu&s;e to ju&s;tice or to merit. By gentlene&s;s and &s;oft|ne&s;s engage their hearts if you can; at lea&s;t, prevent the pretence of offence; but take care to &s;how re&s;olution and firmne&s;s enough to extort from their love of ea&s;e, or their fear, what you might in vain hope for from their ju&s;tice or good-nature. People in high life are hardened to the wants and di&s;tre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es of mankind as &s;urgeons are to their bodily pains; they &s;ee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hear of them all day long, and even of &s;o many &s;imulated ones, that they do not know which are real, and which
<PB N="87" REF="017372_0094_0FA10EEC0AAC6C00">not. Other &s;entiments are therefore to be appli|ed to, than tho&s;e of mere ju&s;tice and humanity; their favour mu&s;t be captivated by the graces; their love of ea&s;e di&s;turbed by unwearied im|portunity, or their fears wrought upon by a decent intimation of implacable, cool re&s;ent|ment. This precept is the only way I know in the world, of being loved without being de&s;pi&s;ed, and feared without being hated. It con&s;titutes the dignity of character, which every wi&s;e man mu&s;t endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>To conclude: If you find that you have a ha&s;tine&s;s in your temper, which unguard|edly breaks out into indi&s;creet &s;allies, or rough expre&s;&s;ions, to either your &s;uperiors, your equals, or your inferiors, watch it nar|rowly, check it carefully, and call the Graces to your a&s;&s;i&s;tance: at the fir&s;t impul&s;e of pa&s;|&s;ion, be &s;ilent, till you can be &s;oft. Labour even to get the command of your countenance &s;o well, that tho&s;e emotions may not be read in it: a mo&s;t un&s;peakable advantage in bu|fine&s;s!

The bu&s;ine&s;s of oratory is to per&s;uade; and to plea&s;e, is the mo&s;t effectual &s;tep towards per&s;uading.

<P>It is certain, that by &s;tudy and application, every man may make him&s;elf a tolerable good orator, eloquence depending upon ob&s;erva|tion and care. Every man may, if he plea&s;es, make choice of good in&s;tead of bad words and phra&s;es, may &s;peak with propriety in&s;tead of impropriety, and may be clear and per&s;picuous in his recitals, in&s;tead of dark and unintelligible: he may have grace in&s;tead of awkwardne&s;s in his ge&s;tures and deport|ment.

<HEAD>PEDANTRY.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY excellency, and every virtue, has its kindred vice or weakne&s;s; and, if carried beyond certain bounds, &s;inks into the one or the other.

But virtue is, in it&s;elf, &s;o beautiful, that it charms us at fir&s;t &s;ight; engages us more and more, upon further ac|quaintance; and, as with other beauties, we think exce&s;s impo&s;&s;ible; it is here that judg|ment is nece&s;&s;ary, to moderate and direct the effects of an excellent cau&s;e. In the &s;ame

<P>Some learned men, proud of their know|ledge, only &s;peak to decide, and give judg|ment without appeal. The con&s;equence of which is, that mankind, provoked by the in|&s;ult, and injured by the oppre&s;&s;ion, revolt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and, in order to &s;hake off the tyranny, even call the lawful authority in que&s;tion.

Even where you are &s;ure, &s;eem rather doubtful: repre&s;ent, but do not pronounce: and, if you would convince others, &s;eem open to conviction your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Others, to &s;how their learning, or often from the prejudices of a &s;chool education, where they hear of nothing el&s;e, are always talking of the Ancients as &s;omething more than men, and of the Moderns as &s;omething le&s;s.

<P>Some great &s;cholars, mo&s;t ab&s;urdly draw all their maxims, both for public and private life, from what they call parallel ca&s;es in the ancient authors; without con&s;idering, that, in the fir&s;t place, there never were, &s;ince the Creation of the World, two ca&s;es exactly parallel: and, in the next place, that there never was a ca&s;e &s;tated, or even known, by any hi&s;torian with every one of its circum|&s;tances, which, however, ought to be known in order to be rea&s;oned from.

<P>There is another &s;pecies of learned men, who, though le&s;s dogmatical and &s;upercilious, are not le&s;s impertinent. The&s;e are the com|municative and &s;hining pedants, who adorn their conver&s;ation, even with women, by happy quotations of Greek and Latin, and who have contracted &s;uch a familiarity with the Greek and Roman authors, that they call

<HEAD>EMPLOYMENT OF TIME.</HEAD>
<P>HOW little do we reflect on the u&s;e and value of time! It is in every body's mouth, but in few people's practice. Every fool, who &s;latterns away his whole time in nothings, frequently utters &s;ome trite com|mon-place &s;entence to prove, at once, the value and the fleetne&s;s of time. The &s;un dials, all over Europe, have &s;ome ingenious in&s;crip|tion to that effect: &s;o that nobody &s;quanders away their time without frequently hearing and &s;eeing how nece&s;&s;ary it is to employ it well; and how irrecoverable it is if lo&s;t. Young
<PB N="107" REF="017372_0112_0FA10EFFC7E122B8">people are apt to think they have &s;o much time before them, that they may &s;quander what they plea&s;e of it, and yet have enough left; as great fortunes have frequently &s;edu|ced people to a ruinous profu&s;ion. But all the&s;e admonitions are u&s;ele&s;s, where there is not a fund of good &s;en&s;e, and rea&s;on to &s;ug|ge&s;t rather than receive them.</P>
<P>Time is precious, life &s;hort, and con&s;e|quently not a &s;ingle moment &s;hould be lo&s;t. Sen&s;ible men know how to make the mo&s;t of time, and put out their whole &s;um either to intere&s;t or plea&s;ure: they are never idle, but continually employed either in amu&s;ements or &s;tudy. It is a univer&s;al maxim, That idle|ne&s;s is the mother of vice. It is, however, certain, that lazine&s;s is the inheritance of fools, and nothing can be &s;o de&s;picable as a &s;luggard. Cato the Cen&s;or, a wi&s;e and virtuous Roman, u&s;ed to &s;ay, there were but three actions of his life that he regretted. The fir&s;t was, the having revealed a &s;ecret to his wife; the &s;econd, that he had once gone by &s;ea when he might have gone by land; and the third, the having pa&s;&s;ed one day without <HI>doing any good.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Take care of the pence, for the pounds will take care of them&s;elves.</Q> was a very ju&s;t and &s;en&s;ible reflection of old Mr. Lown|des, the famous Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, under William III. Anne, and George I. I
<PB N="108" REF="017372_0113_0FA10F0136672B78">therefore recommed to you to take care of minutes, for hours will take care of them&s;elves. Be doing &s;omething or other all day long; and not neglect half-hours and quarters of hours, which, at the year's end, amount to a great &s;um. For in&s;tance: There are many &s;hort intervals in the day, between &s;tudies and plea&s;ures; in&s;tead of &s;itting idle and yawn|ing, in tho&s;e intervals, &s;natch up &s;ome valu|able book, and continue the reading of that book till you have got through it; never bur|den your mind with more than one thing at a time: and, in reading this book, do not run over it &s;uperficially, but read every pa&s;&s;|age twice over, at lea&s;t do not pa&s;s on to a &s;econd, till you thoroughly under&s;tand the fir&s;t, nor quit the book till you are ma&s;ter of the &s;ubject; for unle&s;s you do this, you may read it through, and not remember the contents of it for a week. The books I would par|ticularly recommend, among others, are the <HI>Marchione&s;s Lambert's advice to her &s;on and daughter, Cardinal Retz's Maxims, Rochfou|cault's Moral Reflections, Bruyere's Characters, Fontenelle's Plurality of Worlds, Sir Jo&s;iah Child on Trade, Bolingbroke's Works;</HI> for &s;tyle, his <HI>Remarks on the Hi&s;tory of England,</HI> under the name of Sir John Oldca&s;tle; <HI>Puffendorff's Jus Gentium,</HI> and <HI>Grotius de Jure Belli et Pa|cis:</HI> the la&s;t two are well tran&s;lated by Bar|berac. For occa&s;ional half-hours or le&s;s, read
<PB N="109" REF="017372_0114_0FA10F01C53DEB40">works of invention, wit and humour; but never wa&s;te your minutes on trifling authors, either ancient or modern.</P>
<P>Nor are plea&s;ure, idlene&s;s, or time lo&s;t, provided they are the plea&s;ures of a rational being; on the contrary, a certain portion of time employed in tho&s;e plea&s;ures, is very u&s;efully employed.</P>
<P>Whatever bu&s;ine&s;s you have, do it the fir&s;t moment you can; never by halves but fini&s;h it without interruption, if po&s;&s;ible. Bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t not be &s;auntered and trifled with; and you mu&s;t not &s;ay to it as Felix did to Paul, "at a more convenient &s;ea&s;on I will &s;peak to thee." The mo&s;t convenient &s;ea&s;on for bu&s;i|ne&s;s is the fir&s;t; but &s;tudy and bu&s;ine&s;s in &s;ome mea&s;ure, point out their own times, to a man of &s;en&s;e; time is much oftener &s;quan|dered away in the wrong choice and impro|per methods of amu&s;ement and plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Di&s;patch is the &s;oul of bu&s;ine&s;s; and no|thing contributes more to di&s;patch than me|thod. Lay down a method for every thing, and &s;tick to it inviolable, as far as unexpected incidents may allow. Fix one certain hour and day in the week for your accounts, and keep them together in their proper order; by which means they will require very little time, and you can never be much cheated. Whatever letters and papers you keep, docket
<PB N="110" REF="017372_0115_0FA10F0561A119B0">and tie them up in their re&s;pective cla&s;&s;es, &s;o that you may in&s;tantly have recour&s;e to any one. Lay down a method al&s;o for your reading, for which you allot a certain &s;hare of your mornings; let it be a con&s;i&s;tent and con&s;ecutive cour&s;e, and not in that de&s;ultory and immethodical manner, in which many people read &s;craps of different authors upon different &s;ubjects. Keep a u&s;eful and &s;hort common place book of what you read, to help your memory only, and not for pedantic quotations. Never read Hi&s;tory without having maps, and a chronological book, or tables, lying by you, and con&s;tantly recurred to; without which, Hi&s;tory is only a con|fu&s;ed heap of facts.</P>
<P>You will &s;ay, it may be, as many young people would, that all this order and method is very trouble&s;ome, only fit for dull people, and a di&s;agreeable re&s;traint upon the noble fire of Youth. I deny it; and a&s;&s;ert on the contrary, that it will procure you both more time and more ta&s;te for your plea&s;ures; and, &s;o far from being trouble&s;ome to you, that, after you have pur&s;ued it a month, it would be trouble&s;ome to you to lay it a&s;ide. Bu&s;i|ne&s;s whets the appetite, and gives a ta&s;te to plea&s;ures, as exerci&s;e does to food: and bu&s;i|ne&s;s can never be done without method: it rai&s;es the &s;pirits for plea&s;ures; and a <HI>&s;pectacle,</HI> a ball, an a&s;&s;embly, will much more &s;en&s;ibly
<PB N="111" REF="017372_0116_0FA10F070599C6E0">affect a man who has employed, than a man who has lo&s;t the preceding part of the day; nay, I will venture to &s;ay, that a fine lady will &s;eem to have more charms to a man of &s;tudy or bu&s;ine&s;s, than to a &s;aunterer. The &s;ame li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s runs through his whole con|duct, and he is as in&s;ipid in his plea&s;ures, as inefficient in every thing el&s;e</P>
<P>I hope you earn your plea&s;ures, and con&s;e|quently ta&s;te them: for by the way, I know a great many men who call them&s;elves Men of plea&s;ure, but who, in truth, have none. They adopt other people's indi&s;criminately, but without any ta&s;te of their own. I have known them often inflict exce&s;&s;es upon them|&s;elves, becau&s;e they thought them genteel; though they &s;at as aukwardly upon them as other people's clothes would have done. Have no plea&s;ures but your own, and then you will &s;hine in them.</P>
<P>Many people think that they are in plea|&s;ures, provided they are neither in &s;tudy nor in bu&s;ine&s;s. Nothing like it: they are doing nothing, and might ju&s;t as well be a&s;leep. They contract habitudes from lazine&s;s, and they only frequent tho&s;e places where they are free from all re&s;traints and attentions. Be upon your guard again&s;t this idle profu&s;i|on of time; and let every place you go to be either the &s;cene of quick and lively plea|&s;ures,
<PB N="112" REF="017372_0117_0FA10F070E3ADA50">or the &s;chool of your improvements: let every company you go into, either gratify your &s;en&s;es, extend your knowledge, or re|fine your manners.</P>
<P>If, by accident, two or three hours are &s;ometimes wanting for &s;ome u&s;eful purpo&s;e, borrow them from your &s;leep. Six or at mo&s;t &s;even hours &s;leep is, for a con&s;tancy, as much as you or any body can want: more is only lazine&s;s and dozing; and is both unwhol&s;ome and &s;tupifying. If, by chance, your bu&s;ine&s;s or your plea&s;ures, &s;hould keep you up till four or five o'clock in the morning ri&s;e exact|ly at your u&s;ual time, that you may not lo&s;e the precious morning hours; and that the want of &s;leep may force you to go to bed earlier the next night.</P>
<P>Above all things, guard again&s;t frivolou&s;|ne&s;s. The frivolous mind is always bu&s;ied but to little purpo&s;e; it takes little objects for great ones, and throws away upon trifles that time and attention which only important things de&s;erve. Nicknacks, butterflies, &s;hells, in&s;ects, &amp;c. are the objects of their mo&s;t &s;e|ries re&s;earches. They contemplate the dre&s;s, not the characters, of the company they keep. They attend more to the decorations of a play, than to the &s;en&s;e of it; and to the ce|remonies of a court, more than to its politics. Such an employment of time is ab&s;olute lo&s;s of it.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="017372_0118_0FA10F07EB98EB50">
To conclude this &s;ubject: Sloth, indolence, and effeminacy, are pernicious and unbecom|ing a young fellow; let them be your <HI>re|&s;ource</HI> forty years hence at &s;oone&s;t. Deter|mine at all events, and however di&s;agreeable it may be to you in &s;ome re&s;pects, and for &s;ome time, to keep the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed and fa&s;hionable company of the place you are at, either for their rank, or for their learning, or <HI>le bel e&s;prit et le gout.</HI> This gives you cre|dentials to the be&s;t companies, where-ever you go afterwards.</P>
<P>Know the true value of time; &s;natch, &s;eize, and enjoy every moment of it. No idlene&s;s, no lazine&s;s, no procra&s;tination; never put off till to-morrow what you can do to-day. That was the rule of the famous and unfortunate Pen&s;ionary De Witt; who, by &s;trictly following it, found time not only to do the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the Republic, but to pa&s;s his evenings at a&s;&s;emblies and &s;uppers, as if he had had nothing el&s;e to do or think of.</P>

<HEAD>VANITY.</HEAD>
<P>BE extremely on your guard again&s;t vani|ty, the common failing of inexperienced youth; but particularly again&s;t that kind of
<PB N="114" REF="017372_0119_0FA10F089201B9D8">vanity that dubbs a man a coxcomb; a cha|racter which once acquired, is more indelible than that of the prie&s;thood. It is not to be imagined by how many different ways vanity defeats its own purpo&s;es. One man decides peremptorily upon every &s;ubject, betrays his ignorance upon many, and &s;hews a di&s;gu&s;ting pre&s;umption upon the re&s;t: another de&s;ires to appear &s;ucce&s;sful among the women; he hints at the encouragement he has received from tho&s;e of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed rank and beauty, and intimates a particular connection with &s;ome one: if it is true, it is ungene|rous; if fal&s;e, it is infamous: but in either ca&s;e he de&s;troys the reputation he wants to get. Some flatter their vanity, by little ex|traneous objects, which have not the lea&s;t re|lation to them&s;elves; &s;uch as being de&s;cended from, related to, or acquainted with people of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit, and eminent charac|ters. They talk perpetually of their grand|father &s;uch a-one, their uncle, and their inti|mate friend, Mr. &s;uch-a one, whom po&s;&s;ibly, they are hardly acquainted with. But ad|mitting it a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l to be as they would have it, what then? Have they the more merit for tho&s;e accidents? Certainly not. On the con|trary&punc; their taking up adventitious, proves want of intrin&s;ic merit; a rich man never borrows. Take this rule for granted, as a never falling one, That you mu&s;t never &s;eem
<PB N="115" REF="017372_0120_0FA10F0A43A8B8C8">to affect the character in which you have a mind to &s;hine. Mode&s;ty is the only &s;ure bait, when you angle for prai&s;e.

By this mode&s;ty I do not mean timi|dity, but awkward ba&s;hfulne&s;s. On the con|trary, be inwardly firm and &s;teady, know your own value, whatever it may be, and act upon that principle; but take great care to let nobody di&s;cover that you do know your own value.

<HEAD>VIRTUE.</HEAD>
<P>VIRTUE is a &s;ubject which de&s;erves your and every man's attention. It con&s;i&s;ts in doing good, and in &s;peaking truth; the effects of it therefore, are advantageous to all mankind, and to one's &s;elf in particular; virtue makes us pity and relieve the mis|fortunes of mankind; it makes us pro|mote ju&s;tice and good order in &s;ociety; and, in general, contributes to whatever tends to the real good of mankind. To
<PB N="116" REF="017372_0121_0FA10F0AF2B88EE0">our&s;elves it gives inward comfort and &s;a|tisfaction, which nothing el&s;e can do, and which nothing can rob us of. All other ad|vantages depend upon others, as much as upon our&s;elves. Riches, power, and great|ne&s;s, may be taken away from us, by the vio|lence and inju&s;tice of others, or by inevitable accidents; but virtue depends only upon our|&s;elves, and nobody can take it away from us. Sickne&s;s may deprive us of all the plea&s;ures of the body; but it cannot deprive us of our virtue, nor of the &s;atisfaction which we feel from it. A virtuous man, under all the misfortunes of life, &s;till finds inward comfort and &s;atisfaction, which makes him happier, than any wicked man can be with all the other advantages of life. If a man has ac|quired great power and riches by fal&s;ehood, inju&s;tice, and oppre&s;&s;ion, he cannot enjoy them, becau&s;e his con&s;cience will torment him, and con&s;tantly reproach him with the means by which he got them. The &s;tings of his con&s;cience will not even let him &s;leep quietly; but he will dream of his crimes: and in the day-time, when alone, and when he has time to think, he will be unea&s;y and melancholy. He is afraid of every thing; for, as he knows mankind mu&s;t hate him, he has rea&s;on to think they will hurt him if they can. Whereas if a virtuous man be ever &s;o poor or unfortunate in the world, &s;till his
<PB N="117" REF="017372_0122_0FA10F0B899DFD88">virtue is its own reward, and will comfort him under all afflictions. The quiet and &s;ati&s;|faction of his con&s;cience make him chearful by day, and &s;leep &s;ound by nights; he can be alone with plea&s;ure, and is not afraid of his own thoughts. Virtue forces her way, and &s;hines through the ob&s;curity of a retired life; and, &s;ooner or later, it always is rewarded.</P>
<P>To conclude:&mdash;Lord Shaft&s;bury &s;ays, that he would be virtuous for his own &s;ake, though nobody were to know it; as he would be clean for his own &s;ake, though nobody were to &s;ee him.</P>

<HEAD>USEFUL MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS ON MEN AND MANNERS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Selected from Lord <HI>Che&s;terfield</HI>'s LETTERS.</HEAD>
<P>A MAN who does not &s;olidly e&s;tabli&s;h, and really de&s;erve, a character of truth, probity, good manners, and good morals, at his fir&s;t &s;etting out in the world, may impo&s;e, and &s;hine like a meteor for a very &s;hort time, but will very &s;oon vani&s;h, and be extingui&s;h|ed with contempt. People ea&s;ily pardon, in young men, the common irregularities of the &s;en&s;es; but they do not forgive the lea&s;t vice of the heart.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t favours may be done &s;o awk|wardly and bunglingly as to offend; and di&s;|agreeable things may be done &s;o di&s;agreeably as almo&s;t to oblige.</P>
<P>There are very few Captains of foot, who are not much better company than ever De|&s;cartes or Sir I&s;aac Newton were. I honour
<PB N="120" REF="017372_0124_0FA10F0D086788F8">and re&s;pect &s;uch &s;uperior geniu&s;es; but I de|&s;ire to conver&s;e with people of this world, who bring into company their &s;hare, at lea&s;t, of chearfulne&s;s, good-breeding, and know|ledge of mankind. In common life, one much oftener wants &s;mall money, and &s;ilver, than gold. Give me a man who has ready ca&s;h about him for pre&s;ent expences; &s;ix|pences, &s;hillings, half-crowns, and crowns, which circulate ea&s;ily: but a man who has only an ingot of gold about him, is much above common purpo&s;es, and his riches are not handy nor convenient. Have as much gold as you plea&s;e in one pocket, but take care always to keep change in the other: for you will much oftener have occa&s;ion for a &s;hilling than a guinea.</P>
<P>Advice is &s;eldom welcome, and tho&s;e who want it the mo&s;t, always like it the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>Envy is one of the meane&s;t and mo&s;t tor|menting of all pa&s;&s;ions, as there is hardly a per&s;on exi&s;ting that has not given unea&s;ine&s;s to an envious brea&s;t; for the envious man cannot be happy, while he beholds others &s;o.</P>
<P>A great action will always meet with the approbation of mankind, and the inward plea&s;ure which it produces, is not to be ex|pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Humanity is the particular characteri&s;tic of great minds; little vicious minds abound with anger and revenge, and are incapable
<PB N="121" REF="017372_0125_0FA10F0DCC3CDFA0">of feeling the exalted plea&s;ure of forgiving their enemies.</P>
<P>The ignorant and the weak only are idle, tho&s;e who have acquired a good &s;tock of knowledge, always de&s;ire to increa&s;e it. Knowledge is like power in this re&s;pect, that tho&s;e who have the mo&s;t, are mo&s;t de&s;irous of having more. Idlene&s;s is only the refuge of weak minds, and the holiday of fools.</P>
<P>Every man has a natural right to his liber|ty; and whoever endeavours to ravi&s;h it from him, de&s;erves death more than the robber who attacks us for our money on the high|way.</P>
<P>Mode&s;ty is a commendable quality, and generally accompanies true merit; it engages and captivates the minds of people; for no|thing is more &s;hocking and di&s;gu&s;tful than pre&s;umption and impudence. A man is de|&s;pi&s;ed who is always commending him&s;elf, and who is the hero of his own &s;tory.</P>
<P>Not to perform our promi&s;e is a folly, a di&s;honour, and a crime. It is a folly, be|cau&s;e no one will rely on us afterwards; and it is a di&s;honour, and a crime, becau&s;e truth is the fir&s;t duty of religion and morality; and whoever is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of truth, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have any one good quality, and mu&s;t be held in dete&s;tation by all good men.</P>
<P>Wit may create many admirers, but makes few friends. It &s;hines and dazzles like the
<PB N="122" REF="017372_0126_0FA10F0E8662D3A0">noon-day &s;un, but, like that too, is very apt to &s;corch; and therefore is always feared. The milder morning and evening light and heat of that planet, &s;oothe and calm our minds. Never &s;eek for wit: if it pre&s;ents it&s;elf, well and good; but even in that ca&s;e, let your judgment interpo&s;e: and take care that it be not at the expence of any body.

<P>A proper &s;ecrecy is the only my&s;tery of able men; my&s;tery is the only &s;ecrecy of weak and cunning ones.</P>
<P>To tell my friend, wife, or mi&s;tre&s;s, any &s;ecret with which they have nothing to do, is di&s;covering to them &s;uch an unretentive weakne&s;s, as mu&s;t convince them that you will tell it to twenty others, and con&s;equently that they may reveal it without the ri&s;k of being di&s;covered. But a &s;ecret properly com|municated, only to tho&s;e who are to be con|cerned in the que&s;tion, will probably be kept by them, though they &s;hould be a good

<P>A man who tells nothing, or who tells all, will equally have nothing told him.</P>
<P>If a fool knows a &s;ecret, he tells it be|cau&s;e he is a fool: if a knave knows one, he tells it wherever it is his intere&s;t to tell it. But women, and young men, are very apt to tell what &s;ecrete they know, from the vanity of having been tru&s;ted. Tru&s;t none of the&s;e, wherever you can help it.</P>
<P>In your friend&s;hips, and in your enmities, let your confidence and your ho&s;tilities have certain bounds: make not the former dan|gerous, nor the latter irreconcilable. There are &s;trange vici&s;&s;itudes in bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Smooth your way to the head through the heart. The way of rea&s;on is a good one: but it is commonly &s;omething longer, and perhaps not &s;o &s;ure.</P>
<P>Spirit is now a very fa&s;hionable word: to act with &s;pirit, means only, to act ra&s;hly, and to talk indi&s;creetly. An able man &s;hows his &s;pirit, by gentle words and re&s;olute ac|tions: he is neither hot nor timid.</P>
<P>Patience is a mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary qualification for bu&s;ine&s;s: Many a man would rather you heard his &s;tory, than granted his reque&s;t. One mu&s;t &s;eem to hear the unrea&s;onable demands of the petulant, unmoved; and the tedious details
<PB N="124" REF="017372_0128_0FA10F103787DDB8">of the dull, untired. That is, the lea&s;t price that a man mu&s;t pay for a high &s;tation.</P>
<P>It is always right to detect a fraud, and to perceive a folly; but it is often very wrong to expo&s;e either. A man of bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould always have his eyes open, but mu&s;t often &s;eem to have them &s;hut.</P>
<P>In courts (and every where el&s;e) ba&s;hfulne&s;s and timidity are as prejudicial on one hand, as impudence and ra&s;hne&s;s are on the other. A &s;teady a&s;&s;urance and a cool intrepidity, with an exterior mode&s;ty, are the true and nece&s;|&s;ary medium.</P>
<P>Never apply for what you &s;ee very little pro|bability of obtaining; for you will, by a&s;king improper and unattainable things, accu&s;tom the mini&s;ters to refu&s;e you &s;o often, that they will find it ea&s;y to refu&s;e you the propere&s;t and mo&s;t rea&s;onable ones. It is a common, but a mo&s;t mi&s;taken rule at court, to a&s;k for every thing in order to get &s;omething: you do get &s;omething by it, it is true; but that &s;omething is refu&s;als and ridicule.&mdash;This maxim, like the former, is of general application.</P>
<P>A chearful ea&s;y countenance and behaviour are very u&s;eful: they make fools think you a good-natured man; and they make de&s;igning men think you an unde&s;igning one.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome occa&s;ions in which a man mu&s;t tell half his &s;ecret, in order to conceal the re&s;t; but there is &s;eldom one in which a man
<PB N="125" REF="017372_0129_0FA10F1625616D70">&s;hould tell it all. Great &s;kill is nece&s;&s;ary to know how far to go, and where to &s;top.</P>
<P>Ceremony is nece&s;&s;ary, as the out work and defence of manners.</P>
<P>A man's own good-breeding is his be&s;t &s;ecurity again&s;t other people's ill manners.</P>
<P>Good-breeding carries along with it a dig|nity, that is re&s;pected by the mo&s;t petulant. Ill breeding invites and authorizes the fami|liarity of the mo&s;t timid. No man ever &s;aid a pert thing to the Duke of Marlborough. No man ever &s;aid a civil one (though many a flat|tering one) to Sir Robert Walpole.</P>
<P>Knowledge may give weight, but accom|pli&s;hments only give lu&s;tre; and many more people &s;ee than weigh.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t arts require long &s;tudy and applica|tion; but the mo&s;t u&s;eful art of all, that of plea|&s;ing, requires only the de&s;ire.</P>
<P>It is to be pre&s;umed that a man of common &s;en&s;e, who does not de&s;ire to plea&s;e, de&s;ires nothing at all; &s;ince he mu&s;t know that he cannot obtain any thing without it.</P>
<P>A &s;kilful negociator will mo&s;t carefully di&s;tingui&s;h between the little and the great objects of his bu&s;ine&s;s, and will be as frank and open in the former, as he will be &s;ecret and pertinacious in the latter&mdash;This maxim holds equally true in common life.</P>
<P>The Duc de Sully ob&s;erves very ju&s;tly, in his Memoirs, that nothing contributed more
<PB N="126" REF="017372_0130_0FA10F17CF6B28A8">to his ri&s;e than that prudent economy which he had ob&s;erved from his youth; and by which he had always a &s;um of money before hand, in ca&s;e of emergencies.</P>
<P>It is very difficult to fix the particular point of economy: the be&s;t error of the two, is on the par&s;imonious &s;ide. That may be correct|ed, the other cannot.</P>
<P>The reputation of genero&s;ity is to be pur|cha&s;ed pretty cheap; it does not depend &s;o much upon a man's general expence, as it does upon his giving hand&s;omely where it is proper to give at all. A man, for in&s;tance, who &s;hould give a &s;ervant four &s;hillings, would pa&s;s for covetous&punc; while he who gave him a crown would be reckoned generous; &s;o that the difference of tho&s;e two oppo&s;ite cha|racters turns upon one &s;hilling. A man's cha|racter, in that particular depends a great deal upon the report of his own &s;ervants; a mere trifle above common wages makes their re|port &s;avourable.</P>
<P>Take care always to form your e&s;tabli&s;h|ment &s;o much within your income, as to leave a &s;ufficient fund for unexpected contingencies, and a prudent liberality. There is hardly a year, in any man's life, in which a &s;mall &s;um of ready money may not be employed to great advantage.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>THE POLITE PHILOSOPHER was print|ed originally at Edinburgh
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the year 1734.</NOTE>, and part of the edition &s;ent up to London. The no|velty of the title, and, to &s;ay truth, of the performance it&s;elf, for it is written in a man|ner never before made u&s;e of in our language, recommended it to &s;ome, and prejudiced it in the opinion of others. But Time, which is the touch&s;tone of &s;uch productions, did ju&s;tice to this work, and at la&s;t procured it an e&s;teem, not only here, but abroad. This, together with my great e&s;teem for its ingeni|ous AUTHOR, who is now in Italy, and who is allowed by all who knew him to be truly a POL<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">TE PHILOSOPHER, occa&s;ioned my &s;end|ing this &s;econd edition into the world.</P>
<P>The intent of the author (for I very well knew his intent) was, to make men a&s;hamed of their vices, by &s;hewing them how ridicu|lous they were made by them, and how im|po&s;&s;ible it was for a bad man to be polite. It may be, graver books have been written
<PB N="iv" REF="017372_0132_0FA10F1ADF276720">on this &s;ubject, but few more to the point; its author being equally &s;killed in books and in men, in the dead languages and the liv|ing: I pre&s;ume, therefore, that his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b&s;er|vations will be generally found true, and his maxims ju&s;t.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t &s;ight, it may &s;eem that this book is calculated only for a few; but I beg leave to ob&s;erve, that in truth there are but few to whom it may not be u&s;eful. As every man in his &s;tation ought to be hone&s;t, &s;o every man in his behaviour may be polite; nay, he ought to be &s;o, becau&s;e he will be &s;ure to find his account in it; &s;ince it is a quality ea&s;ier di&s;cerned, and of con&s;equence &s;ooner rewarded, than the former. We mu&s;t know and conver&s;e with a man, to be con|vinced of his probity; whereas we perceive at fir&s;t &s;ight whether he has good manners; by this we are prejudiced in his favour: and who then would not &s;trive to learn an art at once &s;o ea&s;y, and &s;o exten&s;ive in its u&s;e?</P>
<P>But, if it be beneficial to all, it is pecu|liarly nece&s;&s;ary to YOUTH. It is at once a remedy for ba&s;hfulne&s;s, and a pre&s;ervative again&s;t the contrary vice. A polite per&s;on &s;tands in the middle, between a &s;heepi&s;h mode&s;ty and a di&s;ta&s;teful boldne&s;s It is the habit which adds the la&s;t poli&s;h to educati|on, brightens the man of letters, and &s;preads a glo&s;s over that &s;ort of learning which would
<PB N="v" REF="017372_0133_0FA10F1B45BFAA18">otherwi&s;e appear pedantic. The polite man may not only under&s;tand Latin and Greek, but may al&s;o introduce them into di&s;cour&s;e, provided it be before proper company, and on a proper occa&s;ion. The unpoli&s;hed &s;cho|lar lugs them in whenever they occur; quotes OVID to his mi&s;tre&s;s, and repeats a pa&s;&s;age from POLYAENEUS to a captain of the guards. To your youth therefore I beg leave to recommend thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> conci&s;e manual, which will co&s;t them but little time to read, and no great pains to practi&s;e.</P>
