<P>AS it &s;eem, it has not been thought either indecent or unfair to renew the attacks upon Mr. Littlepage's character, <HI>in his ab&s;ence,</HI> it is become nece&s;&s;ary, to make a general collection of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive publication of that gentleman.

<P>To that letter Mr. Littlepage received no an&s;wer, and although he after|wards repeatedly &s;aw Mr. Jay, nothing further pa&s;&s;ed upon the &s;ubject; the only conclu&s;ion which he could draw from that conduct, was, that Mr. Jay was &s;atisfied with the a&s;&s;urances he had received, or did not think <HI>per&s;onal engagements</HI> from Mr. Littlepage nece&s;&s;ary; &s;uch, if reque&s;ted, he was rea|dy and willing to take, as both his <HI>time</HI> and <HI>circum&s;tances then permitted.</HI></P>

On the 25th November, Mr. Littlepage &s;ent to Mr. Jay, in quality of Se|cretary for foreign affairs, a letter of recommendation in his favor from his CATHOLIC MAJESTY, addre&s;&s;ed to his Excellency the <HI>Pre&s;ident of Congre&s;s;</HI> accompanied by &s;everal other letters from different Generals in the &s;ervice of Spain and France.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Mini&s;ter of his Catholic Maje&s;ty will deliver to you differ|ent letters of recommendation in my favor, which I reque&s;t may be laid before Congre&s;s, and the originals, or atte&s;ted copies of them, returned to me.

<P>The character of a CITIZEN of AMERICA, I con&s;ider as the fir&s;t of ti|tles; to &s;erve my country is my highe&s;t ambition, to merit her e&s;teem would be my noble&s;t recompence; but as America has happily no farther occa&s;ion for the exertions of military zeal, Congre&s;s, I hope, will not think my conduct incon&s;i&s;tent with the duty of a citizen of the United States, when I inform them that my intention is to return to Europe, where &s;ome years of my future life will be devoted to the &s;ervice of a monarch. The name of the KING of POLAND reflects &s;ufficient honor upon all who boa&s;t his patronage: Of his e&s;teem, at lea&s;t, I &s;hould think my&s;elf a&s;&s;ured, under the &s;anction of a recom|mendation from Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Permit me then, Sir, to reque&s;t, that you will officially notify to Congre&s;s that, <HI>if not incompatible with the principles of the con&s;titution, or their re|&s;olutions,</HI> I humbly petition them to honor me with <HI>a letter of recommendati|on,</HI> addre&s;&s;ed to his POLISH MAJESTY.

<P>Congre&s;s having referred the above-mentioned letters to the Secretary for foreign affairs to report, Mr. Littlepage earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed him to termi|nate the affair, as he could, for no con&s;ideration, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> his return to Europe by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> packet, which would &s;ail on the 6th December.

<P>Mr. Jay pre&s;ents his compliments to Mr. Littlepage, and reque&s;ts to be informed whether his Catholic Maje&s;ty conferred upon him any <HI>commi&s;&s;ion</HI> or <HI>other reward</HI> for his &s;ervices; and al&s;o, whether Mr. Littlepage holds <HI>any,</HI> and <HI>what military commi&s;&s;ion.</HI>&mdash;As Mr. Littlepage's letter and tho&s;e which accompanied it are referred to Mr. Jay to report, he wi&s;hes to have accurate information upon the&s;e points.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Only the demand re&s;pecting <HI>any reward</HI> from the Catholic King, could be either proper or nece&s;&s;ary;&mdash;and upon that point Mr. Jay &s;tood in need of <HI>no information;</HI>&mdash;Mr. Littlepage, however, returned an explicit and &s;a|tisfactory an&s;wer to the whole: His unea&s;ine&s;s having been increa&s;ed at being informed that an adjournment of Congre&s;s would take place in two days time, from that ab&s;ence of &s;ome of the members, he wrote to Mr. Jay, informing him of that circum&s;tance, intreating him to con&s;ider the emergency of his affairs and re-iterating his &s;olicitations for him to &s;end in his report to Congre&s;s immediately.</P>
<P>In the evening of the 2d December Mr. Littlepage was informed that the adjournment of Congre&s;s had <HI>that day</HI> taken place, and nothing had been done in his bu&s;ine&s;s!!!</P>
<P>He then began to penetrate into the my&s;tery of Mr. Jay's conduct; but, however &s;hocked at a &s;imilar pro&s;titution of <HI>public duty</HI> to <HI>private animo&s;ity,</HI> he confined his expo&s;tulations to a letter, reque&s;ting Mr. Jay "to <HI>return him, if po&s;&s;ible, the papers in que&s;tion,</HI> as he was &s;till under the nece&s;&s;ity of not po&s;tponing his voyage to Europe, where the lo&s;s of them might be infinitely prejudicial to him." He concluded by intreating Mr. Jay to remember, <HI>"that tho&s;e honorable atte&s;tations of his conduct were his only reward for &s;ome &s;evere &s;ervice, and, at lea&s;t, a di&s;intere&s;ted zeal in the cau&s;e of his country:&mdash;It could not &s;urely be con&s;i&s;tent with the INTENTIONS OF CON|GRESS,</HI> or, <HI>he hoped, with Mr. Jay's feelings, that he &s;hould be DEPRIVED OF EVEN THEM."</HI></P>
<P>The day following he received an an&s;wer, informing him that the letters had been &s;ent to Congre&s;s, and could not be returned without <HI>their</HI> order.&mdash; The an&s;wer was on <HI>Saturday;</HI>&mdash;the packet was to &s;ail on <HI>Monday;</HI>&mdash;Con|gre&s;s no longer exi&s;ted as a body;&mdash;the cruel alternative to which Mr. Lit|tlepage was then reduced is too obvious to need farther explanation.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of his affairs in Europe would not, however, as yet permit him to he&s;itate upon the choice he had to make; but immediately after a new mine was &s;prung again&s;t him: the <HI>&s;ame day,</HI> without the <HI>lea&s;t previous no|tice,</HI> or even a <HI>demand having ever been made upon him,</HI> Mr. Littlepage
<PB N="4" REF="020462_0006_0FAF10D241E8B948">was arre&s;ted in his lodging, at the &s;uit of Mr. Jay, for the &s;um due to him by Bon. Lewis, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> late guardian to Mr. Littlepage.</P>
<P>Such an in&s;ult to any gentleman would have loudly called for vengeance and reparation; but in that in&s;tance it was attended with many aggravating cir|cum&s;tances: &mdash;Mr. Littlepage was informed that the mo&s;t malicious in&s;inua|tions again&s;t him had been infu&s;ed into the minds of all di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten to them: in a word, that the whole of Mr. Jay's proceedings was the re&s;ult of a <HI>deelared enmity</HI> and <HI>premeditated de&s;ign</HI> to <HI>injure,</HI> and, if po&s;&s;ible, <HI>di&s;|grace</HI> him in the eyes of the public.</P>
<P>Thus per&s;ecuted, in&s;ulted, and ju&s;tly exa&s;perated, Mr. Littlepage at la&s;t re&s;olved, notwith&s;tanding the public character of his enemy, to call him to a &s;evere account; in con&s;equence he &s;ent him a challenge, which was refu&s;ed: he then re&s;olved to appeal to the public, but by the mediation of a worthy friend to both parties, he was induced to demand once more an explanation: in con&s;equence he wrote the following letter to Mr. Jay:</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>War&s;aw,</HI> <DATE><HI>1&s;t June,</HI> 1786.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>A PAMPHLET, containing my private corre&s;pondence with John Jay, E&s;quire, and publi&s;hed &s;ince my departure from America, has been tran&s;mitted to me.</P>
<P>Confidence in the ju&s;tice and impartiality of my country fir&s;t induced me to appeal to her &s;olemn tribunal; malice, per&s;ecution and in&s;ult, united in ren|dering recrimination on my part but a ju&s;t defence, and I have &s;till more, the &s;atisfaction to think that I have given an u&s;eful le&s;&s;on to the world, by un|masking a character, which hypocri&s;y and di&s;&s;imulation had &s;o long concealed. The &s;hafts of calumny, I dare hope, have been long blunted again&s;t my fame; and I &s;hould think my&s;elf degraded by entering into a further juftification, was it not to convince my fellow-citizens, that no &s;ituation in the European world can dimini&s;h the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and re&s;pect which I &s;hall ever pay to their judgment: To merit their e&s;teem will ever be my highe&s;t ambition; my fir&s;t duty is, to leave on un&s;potted name among&s;t them.</P>
<P>Had the publication of my corre&s;pondence with Mr. Jay been un&s;oiled by his ob&s;ervations, I &s;hould have thought it needed on my part neither comment
<PB N="8" REF="020462_0009_0FAF10D4837C2A88">nor defence. It commences at an age, when few inferences are to be drawn from either opinion or conduct, which can ju&s;tly affect the heart or morals. If, in&s;tead of the effu&s;ions of a warm and grateful mind, that zeal for my country, that ardour for military fame, and enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;en&s;e of honor, which even my connexion with Mr. Jay could not extingui&s;h, mine had been replete with the imprudent &s;allies and <HI>incon&s;equential</HI> errors &s;o common to my age; &s;urely the voice of candour would &s;till he&s;itate to decide, until <HI>maturity</HI> &s;hould either <HI>fix</HI> or <HI>obliterate</HI> the &s;tain, which only at a <HI>certain period</HI> becomes <HI>inde|lible.</HI> If it was intended to prove that I <HI>once</HI> thought differently of Mr. Jay, I entreat the Public to ob&s;erve that I have never cea&s;ed to avow it; at an age of error I certainly e&s;teemed him.</P>
<P>The &s;econd part approaches nearer to manhood. It contains &s;ome ripened ideas upon Mr. Jay, joined to &s;ome warm expo&s;tulations with him for his con|duct towards me, dictated by &s;entiments as void of art as the expre&s;&s;ions which convey them. But there, too, his malignity has been baffled to point out one line which can be ju&s;tly con&s;trued into a breach of honor, and &s;till le&s;s of pro|bity, Even the pitiful &s;ubterfuge which he at la&s;t found, may be con&s;idered as no light encomium upon my character. I am accu&s;ed, it &s;eems, of having dared to reproach him with inju&s;tice and cruelty, during a &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to my &s;ituation in <HI>Minorca,</HI> and my letters to him in con&s;e|quence.</NOTE> which will for ever remain engraved in my memory. Does he from thence, too, pretend a fre&s;h claim to my gratitude? Would not his conduct, on the contrary, have even ju&s;tified me, in con&s;idering every <HI>pa&s;t obligation as cancelled,</HI> and might I not here appeal to the &s;ympathy and indignation of the world?</P>
<P>Upon another occa&s;ion, I recollect, he has in&s;inuated that I acted the part of <HI>an incendiary, to pay court to him, and render his advances more liberal.</HI> He will hardly deny, that at the period alluded to, I &s;tood in infinitely more need of his liberality, and &s;till the public has &s;een that I proved, at be&s;t, but a <HI>&s;narling courtier.</HI> I confe&s;s I am even at a lo&s;s to conceive his motives for laying that part of our corre&s;pondence before the public; was it to prove his <HI>genero&s;ity,</HI> or PATRIOTISM? In the fir&s;t in&s;tance, a youth of no unpromi&s;ing di&s;po&s;itions, confided to his care and friend&s;hip, who had been guilty of no di&s;honorable, or even imprudent act,&mdash;at who&s;e reputation, on the contrary, he him&s;elf rejoiced;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide his fir&s;t letter to me at Mahon, No. 27 of his pamphlet. <HI>"You are well &s;poken of, and I rejoice to hear it."</HI> That letter was written <HI>after</HI> he had <HI>prote&s;ted my bill</HI> in favor of Mr. Harri&s;on; although <HI>without even ac|quainting me</HI> with that circum&s;tance.</NOTE>&mdash;ought &s;urely to have had &s;ome claim to the common rights of <HI>humanity,</HI> if not to <HI>friend&s;hip</HI> and <HI>indulgence.</HI></P>

The conclu&s;ion re&s;ulting from the &s;econd &s;tate of the que&s;tion is infinitely more &s;erious: in that I am to be con&s;idered only in the character of a <HI>citizen of America;&mdash;the fir&s;t</HI> ever <HI>recognized</HI> as &s;uch by the court of Spain, at a mo&s;t critical aera in politics;&mdash;the fir&s;t Prote&s;tant who was ever publicly au|thori&s;ed to &s;erve in the army of the Catholic King:&mdash;In a word, placed in a &s;ituation which, in&s;ignificant as I was, had attracted the attention of part of Europe upon me:&mdash;at a juncture like that, did it become A MINISTER OF THE UNITED STATES, after having him&s;elf &s;olicited my admi&s;&s;ion into the family of the commander in chief, both from the mini&s;ter of &s;tate,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide his letter to the court of Florida-Blanca, of the 17th, and to the Count de Montmorin, of the 24th of June, <HI>1781,</HI> contained in No. <HI>14.</HI></NOTE> and the amba&s;&s;ador of France; after acknowledging the &s;ervice,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide his letter to Benjamin Lewis, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> No, <HI>14,</HI> "Gentlemen of weight and di&s;tinction advi&s;ed me to con&s;ent to his going," and adding <HI>"that it would &s;erve the American cau&s;e,"</HI> and ju&s;t before, "&s;o popular did his application &s;oon promi&s;e, and indeed begin to be, that &s;ome, on who&s; attachment he had no great rea&s;on to rely, &amp;c. &amp;c." alluding, I &s;uppo&s;e to Mr. Carmichael.</NOTE> which I rendered to my country; did it become him, I again repeat, to abandon me, deprive me of all credit and re&s;ources, and reduce me to the hard nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>rearing,</HI> in the mid&s;t of the campaign, or derogating from my <HI>own honor</HI> and the <HI>dignity of my country,</HI> by imploring the charity of &s;trangers?&mdash; The&s;e con&s;iderations were &s;o obvious that the only citizen of America at hand, although per&s;onally almo&s;t a &s;tranger to me, nobly exerted him&s;elf in what <HI>had then</HI> become a <HI>public cau&s;e;</HI> whil&s;t the <HI>repre&s;entative of Congre&s;s,</HI> with the trifling &s;alary of 2,500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling per annum, held back, and af|fected to cavil <HI>at expre&s;&s;ions,</HI> until finding the campaign drawing towards a conclu&s;ion, and him&s;elf in want of a private &s;ecretary, he conde&s;cended to forgive my complaints, and, by an unheard of effort of genero&s;ity, made me a remittance of 20 guineas.</P>
<P>For my own part, although I regard the campaign in Minorca as the &s;e|vere&s;t trial of my youth, I &s;hall ever look back to it with the plea&s;ing &s;en&s;a|tions of a mind uncon&s;cious of reproach, and even elate with triumph. At that cri&s;is, I confe&s;s, I con&s;idered my&s;elf as much a repre&s;entative of my country as her well-paid mini&s;ter;&mdash;That idea alone added enthu&s;ia&s;m to ambition;&mdash;the latter may lead to glory, but the fir&s;t urges to martyrdom. Perhaps, I may add, con&s;idering my &s;ituation, the motives which animated me, and the difficulties I had to encounter, my countrymen may conceive ideas of my principles and character very different from tho&s;e which my adver&s;ary has long laboured to infu&s;e.

<P><PB N="11" REF="020462_0012_0FAF10D6DB345B00">
That he may not, however, be again led into an error, which has already proved fatal to him, of relying too much upon his &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>invi&s;ibility</HI> in &s;i|milar tran&s;actions, I &s;hall once more conde&s;cend to an&s;wer his arguments upon that letter.</P>
<P>The paragraph which he has &s;elected from the re&s;t to di&s;play his logic, is that in which I mention that "attempts were made to render me di&s;contented with him, and at the &s;ame time to &s;educe me into pur&s;uits which would tend to prejudice me in his opinion."

But to return once more to the point in que&s;tion: Whatever might have been Mr. Carmichael's views in his in&s;inuations to me, I confe&s;s I never thought I had rea&s;on to complain of Mr. Jay in that particular. The univer|&s;al di&s;gu&s;t which that able negociator had &s;ound means to in&s;pire into all ranks of Spaniards, had reduced him to almo&s;t a &s;tate of &s;olitude in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t ho&s;pitable capital of Europe. Even that circum&s;tance contributed to in&s;lame his jealou&s;y and re&s;entment again&s;t Mr. Carmichael, to who&s;e in|trigues he imputed it; and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed the per&s;onal addre&s;s, and in|&s;inuating talents of the latter, formed a mo&s;t &s;triking contra&s;t with his own aukward dignity and natural phlegm. Never, I cannot forbear ob&s;erving, was a negociation conducted with &s;uch frivolous, and &s;ometimes ridiculous circum&s;tances, as that which Mr. Jay at la&s;t terminated, like the defence of his character, in, literally, NOTHING. Sy&s;tems adopted and changed&mdash;plots, counter-plots, and machinations of every kind employed;&mdash;in &s;hort, every wheel of political machinery put in motion&mdash;not to penetrate the Spani&s;h mi|ni&s;try, but <HI>his own &s;ecretary!!!</HI> The object, after all, &s;eldom extended be|yond conjectures upon a <HI>conver&s;ation,</HI> or conclu&s;ions from a <HI>vi&s;it.</HI> The lat|ter, particularly, were deemed of &s;uch importance, that one would have thought the treaty between America and Spain depended more upon <HI>vi&s;iting-cards</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In one of Mr. Jay's &s;horte&s;t letters to Congre&s;s, of <HI>80</HI> pages in folio, I remember he dwells particularly upon the important circum&s;tance of his hav|ing <HI>"drank a di&s;h of chocolate"</HI> with D.

<P>But, after having &s;o greatly contributed to the amu&s;ement and edification of the public by this di&s;play of his character and eloquence, in his di&s;&s;ertation upon <HI>one</HI> part of my letter, why has he pa&s;&s;ed over the <HI>remainder</HI> in &s;ilence? The paragraph which follows is no le&s;s worthy of attention: "<HI>The mo&s;t in|famous fal&s;ehoods have been reported even to your&s;elf by the</HI> SAME PERFI|DIOUS AND CRUEL AUTHOR." How did I come to the knowledge of the&s;e <HI>fal&s;ehoods</HI> reported to <HI>him&s;elf?</HI> He has quoted an anecdote, related in terms as ambiguous and ob&s;cure as the rece&s;&s;es of his &s;oul: For my part, I re|collect nothing of it; but even admitting the fact to have been &s;uch as he has &s;ta|ted, it is <HI>one</HI> in&s;tance; I &s;peak in the <HI>plural</HI> number: Did he ever object to this &s;evere and direct accu&s;ation, for which, at lea&s;t, I could have no other au|thority than his <HI>information?</HI> Did he ever <HI>blame,</HI> or reque&s;t me to <HI>mitigate</HI>

<P><HI>Frown, frown!&mdash;for blu&s;h thou can&s;t not!</HI></P>
<P>After all, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I might have found &s;ome difficulty in extricating my&s;elf from this &s;nare without the authority of his letter of the 29th Dec. 1781, * part of which I have quoted in my former publication. His de|fence of that letter, it &s;eams, is confined to <HI>one &s;hort negative a&s;&s;ertion,</HI> viz. That the facts alledged in it can only be con&s;idered as re&s;ulting<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>p. 76,</HI> "They &s;ay nothing of Mr. Carmichael, but what &s;prung from the letter in que&s;tion.</NOTE> from my letter of the 15th June.</P>
<P>I have been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to the <HI>miraculous</HI> in Mr. Jay's character, that nothing on his part can appear to me either novel or a&s;toni&s;hing. The public, perhaps, may be differently affected: What then, this man, acknow|ledged to be great in all little things; this &s;tate&s;man formed from the chaos of law and politics, this <HI>poi&s;onous worm of Machiavellian excrement;</HI> entangled in the &s;nares of his own duplicity, is at length obliged to &s;acrifice his vanity to the opinion of the world, and would willingly confe&s;s him&s;elf to have been the <HI>dupe of a boy, a beardle&s;s boy!! Ri&s;um teneatis, amici?</HI></P>
<P>Once more I mu&s;t intreat the public to attend to the words of that letter of the 29th Dec. 1781. It will be ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h between what had reference to mine, and what was <HI>foreign,</HI> and even <HI>antecedent</HI> to it: For example, in the very fir&s;t line of my quotation he &s;ays, <HI>The &s;econd in&s;tance you adduce is, that I</HI> EXPRESSED MY APPREHENSIONS TO YOU ONE DAY, <HI>that a</HI> CERTAIN GENTLEMAN <HI>would be glad to have a handle again&s;t me,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide No. <HI>26</HI> of his pamphlet.</NOTE>
<PB N="14" REF="020462_0015_0FAF10DA86D9A1B0">&amp;c. He adds, <HI>"I remember this circum&s;tance, and you have &s;tated it right."</HI> Has this referrence to my letter, or to any thing from me?&mdash;does not he con|fe&s;s the conver&s;ation to have been <HI>&s;pontaneous</HI> on his part, and the <HI>commu|nications made directly to me.</HI> Again, "AS EXPERIENCE &dagger; <HI>had taught me to expect little</HI> FAIR <HI>or</HI> FRIENDLY <HI>from the gentleman in que&s;tion</HI> I DID APPRREHEND," &amp;c. a little further he expre&s;sly &s;ays, "<HI>though</HI> I DO NOT REMEMBER TO HAVE EXPLAINED THIS TO YOU, <HI>yet I was not without &s;u&s;picions,</HI>" &amp;c. Surely my <HI>information</HI> could not have extended to facts or &s;u&s;picions which he had not even explained to me.</P>
<P>Throughout the whole of his letter he never once appeals either to <HI>mine</HI> of the 15th <HI>June,</HI> or to my <HI>knowledge</HI> of the facts alledged. On the contrary, he even communicates to me a circum&s;tance which <HI>per&s;onally</HI> affects me, and could only tend to in&s;lame my re&s;entment again&s;t Mr. Carmichael: "<HI>that</HI> SAME GENTLEMAN <HI>perceiving that the</HI> SPANIARDS (<HI>among whom he had</HI> AGAINST HIS BETTER KNOWLEDGE, AND NOT FOR THE BEST PUR|POSES, <HI>repre&s;ented you,</HI>") &amp;c. &amp;c. In &s;hort, the misfortune of my adver&s;ary, upon this, as well as &s;imilar points, &s;eem to be his confounding his principle in common life, with the habitual practice of his profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;he defends him|&s;elf upon the point of honor, as he would at the bar, and thinks reputa|tion, like a bad cau&s;e, may be &s;aved by a <HI>quibble.</HI></P>
<P>Even &s;uppo&s;ing for a moment no proof to have exi&s;ted on either part, but a&s;&s;ertions and negatives, notwith&s;tanding his mode&s;t exordium in the intro|duction to his pamphlet, the American public, I pre&s;ume, would hardly &s;u&s;pend their judgment <HI>upon a que&s;tion of duplicity</HI> between a <HI>young &s;oldier</HI> and a <HI>veteran lawyer.</HI></P>
<P>As another proof of his principles in argument as well as politics, I beg leave to in&s;tance one of his late quotations, intended to prove that I advanced, upon my <HI>own knowledge,</HI> facts to the prejudice of Mr. Carmichael:&mdash;the pa|ragraph is taken from my letter to him of the 1&s;t February, 1782, from Ma|hon. In his quotations, page 67.69, of his pamphlet, it runs thus, <HI>"On the contrary, political rea&s;ons &s;eemed to point out another line of conduct; had I de&s;i&s;ted, Carmichael would have had a handle again&s;t one of us,"</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. Here is no le&s;s than an <HI>entire paragraph omitted</HI> and which, it will be &s;een, changes the &s;en&s;e of the whole: it is as fallows: <HI>On the contrary,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fir&s;t coolne&s;s between Mr. Jay and Carmichael, aro&s;e, as the fir&s;t informed me, on board of the frigate in which they &s;ailed from America; <HI>twelve months</HI> before I ever had the honor of an acquaintance with either of tho&s;e gentlemen: As this affair alluded to is in &s;ome degree of a public na|ture, I have never thought my&s;elf authori&s;ed to enter into a detail of it.</NOTE>

<P>With re&s;pect to his &s;y&s;tem of detaining me in Madrid, after the &s;iege of Mahon, and upon which he is al&s;o <HI>negative,</HI> the public will reflect, that certain combinations of circum&s;tances &s;ometimes render conclu&s;ions inevita|ble, and literal proofs unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>He him&s;elf, upon that point, has quitted his common methodical road, and recurs to preceding and &s;ub&s;equent facts, from which he only draws an inference of probability: upon this ground I meet him: he begins, rather unfortunate, by denying the <HI>term</HI> of my re&s;idence with him at the period alluded to:&mdash;he affirms that I could not have arrived in Madrid <HI>"early in April"</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide page <HI>73.</HI> "His la&s;t letter before his return to Madrid is dated 25th March at Mahon; con&s;equently his return to Madrid could not have been early in that month."</NOTE> becau&s;e my la&s;t letter to him from Minorca is dated on the 25th <HI>March.</HI> His ignorance of geography &s;eems to have led him into this mi&s;take, as, I pre&s;ume, he calculated upon the month which the fleet had employed in their pa&s;&s;age from Cadiz to Minorca: that I&s;land, any map will inform him, is only &s;ixty leagues di&s;tant from the coa&s;t of Catalonia, where I landed on my return. My journal for 1782 &s;ays, "On the 27th March failed, with the Duke de Crillon, from Mahon, landed at Barcelona on the 29th, and <HI>reached Madrid on the 9th April.</HI>"</P>
<P>The interim from thence to the time of his departure for Paris, I think, can be little &s;hort of &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P>I never &s;aw Dr. Franklin's letter, &s;ummoning him to France, nor do I know the preci&s;e time of its reception; but I again affirm, that previous to that event, <HI>he had prevailed upon me to renounce my military views and direct my hopes to the diplomatic line.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">I de&s;ire it may be under&s;tood, that I never con&s;idered, or repre&s;ented my&s;elf as &s;erving in quality of Mr. Jay's private &s;ecretary&mdash;I never &s;olicited either &s;alary or reward for my &s;ervices, and even &s;hould have thought my&s;elf off ended by a propo&s;al of the kind from him.

Was it to confirm me by his <HI>per&s;onal</HI> remon&s;trances, in a re&s;olution which I had <HI>already</HI> taken of <HI>returning to America,</HI> that, in&s;tead of letting me em|bark at once from Minorca for Cadiz, and <HI>from thence to America,</HI> Mr. Jay ad|vi&s;ed me to <HI>pa&s;s by Madrid,</HI> which nece&s;&s;arily obliged me to undertake a jour|ney <HI>by land through the whole kingdom of Spain in its greate&s;t extent?</HI> and yet <HI>&s;ecure under his Vulcanian &s;hield of impudence,</HI> without alledging one often|&s;ible motive for either <HI>his conduct or my own,</HI> he a&s;&s;erts that, contrary to his mo&s;t <HI>&s;trenuous remon&s;trances,</HI> I urged him <HI>to con&s;ent to my remaining at Madrid!</HI> This enigma has been amply explained in my publication of the 7th December la&s;t.</P>
<P>As a corroborating proof of what I have there advanced, with re&s;pect to the arrangements which took place between Mr Jay and my&s;elf, in the <HI>interim</HI> from my arrival, until the time of his being &s;ummoned to Paris, I &s;hall in&s;ert the following extract from a letter which I wrote to Ben. Lewis, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> in date of the 25th April, 1782; that is near three weeks antecedent to the one which Mr. Jay has cau&s;ed to be publi&s;hed. The words are as follow:</P>
<P>"After the campaign in Minorca, I had formed the de&s;ign of <HI>returning to America,</HI> in the hopes of obtaining a genteel employment in the army, but the pre&s;ent pacific appearance of affairs points out a political line as far more eligible for me. The reputation of having re&s;ided &s;ome time at a foreign court, in the family of a mini&s;ter, may probably recommend me to Congre&s;s as an object worthy their attention; for this end the efforts of my friends will not, I hope, be wanting; <HI>on Mr. Jay, at lea&s;t, I can rely; he</HI> ADVISES <HI>me to remain at Madrid</HI> UNTIL SOMETHING OF THE KIND MAY HAPPEN, <HI>and will continue to &s;upply me,</HI>" &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to my &s;econd letter to Mr. Lewis, of the 15th May following, it will be found upon examination to contain nothing contradictory to my for|mer or pre&s;ent a&s;&s;ertions: It was intended to &s;timulate him to make every ef|fort in his power to relieve me from the pain of my &s;ituation with re&s;pect to
<PB N="18" REF="020462_0019_0FAF10DEA8D32048">Mr. Jay; <HI>recent experience</HI> had taught me what I had to apprehend from him in pecuniary affairs; con&s;equently my de&s;ign was to paint, in the mo&s;t bril|liant colours, the objects which induced me to prolong my re&s;idence in Europe, and the inconveniences to which I &s;hould be expo&s;ed if I did not receive &s;up|plies by a <HI>given time.</HI> The delicacy and caution which I ob&s;erve upon every point re&s;pecting Mr. Jay, would be &s;ufficiently accounted for from the cir|cum&s;tance alone of his being entru&s;ted with the letter; how far my &s;u&s;picions were ju&s;t is proved by the event: <HI>he examined the letter, found the contents might be of u&s;e, kept it in his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and has &s;ince cau&s;ed it to be printed.</HI> I am really curious to know upon what principle he pretends to ju&s;tify that act of treachery. He has &s;aid in one of his publications, that I gave him a <HI>number of copies</HI> to be forwarded to America: Admitting the fact, it by no means authori&s;ed him to <HI>keep one of them,</HI> and &s;till le&s;s to <HI>publi&s;h it;</HI> but even the excu&s;e is a fal&s;ehood: I mention indeed in the letter, that I &s;hall &s;end twelve copies of it to America; but I perfectly recollect that I never made more than <HI>three, two</HI> of which Mr. Jay took charge of, the <HI>other</HI> I en|clo&s;ed to Mr. Harri&s;on at Cadiz. The public may not find that anecdote un|worthy of attention.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I am at a lo&s;s to di&s;cover what imputation he aims to fix upon me by the publication of my letters to him, <HI>after</HI> his departure from Spain?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His an&s;wer to my letter of 23d May, <HI>1782,</HI> as printed in No. <HI>37</HI> of his pamphlet, I never received, and have &s;ome rea&s;on to believe it is of a much later date.</NOTE> He affects <HI>&s;urpri&s;e,</HI> it is true, in his note upon that of the 10th June, 1782,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide his note upon No. <HI>38,</HI> page <HI>57.</HI></NOTE> that <HI>if I con&s;idered my&s;elf as left by him in the character of a &s;py upon Mr. Carmichael, I did not allude to it, by way of obviating that objection to my leaving Madrid.</HI> Has the weakne&s;s of his nerves affected his intellects? is it the impotence of de&s;pairing guilt, or in deri&s;ion of the public, that he has ventured that ob&s;ervation?

I have repeatedly ob&s;erved, that my explanation with that gentleman did not take place until <HI>the year following,</HI> after Mr. Jay's departure from Madrid: how then was I to <HI>retract</HI> what I <HI>&s;till believed?</HI>&mdash;Was Mr. Car|michael to appear more e&s;timable, becau&s;e I began to di&s;cover the bad qua|lities of Mr. Jay?&mdash;or does he &s;o far wrong him&s;elf as to &s;uppo&s;e that the fir&s;t ray of &s;u&s;picion could penetrate into the dark aby&s;s of his character;&mdash; could di&s;cern at once a complication of vices, which even perplexes the un|der&s;tanding, when guided by experience and demon&s;tration?</P>
<P>In &s;hort, this continued &s;train of low artifice and eva&s;ion&mdash;mi&s;interpreting &s;ome parts of my letters and affecting not to under&s;tand others, can only be compared to the proverbial &s;tupidity of a certain animal, who, when in dan|ger, &s;huts his own eyes, and thinks him&s;elf concealed from view.</P>
<P>In &s;everal of his notes and ob&s;ervations, he endeavours to prove an <HI>incon|&s;i&s;tency</HI> in my conduct for continuing to write to him, after, I confe&s;s, I had <HI>cea&s;ed to e&s;teem him.</HI> But <HI>politene&s;s</HI> is as different from <HI>e&s;teem</HI> as <HI>re&s;pect</HI> from <HI>&s;ervility.</HI> Be&s;ides, my &s;ituation with re&s;pect to him was &s;till delicate: having been placed in a manner under his direction, I thought it incumbent upon me to pre&s;erve an appearance of regard and deference towards him, both for my own ju&s;tification to my friends and to avoid giving him a handle of mi&s;repre&s;entation again&s;t me.</P>
<P>Further ob&s;ervations upon that point would be &s;uperfluous, as few per&s;ons can be at a lo&s;s to conceive my motives and &s;ituation.</P>

I had not for a &s;eries of time even heard from my friends in America, but having by &s;ome favorable circum&s;tances acquired an exten&s;ive credit upon my <HI>own account,</HI> I endeavoured from motives of delicacy to acquit both my friends and my&s;elf towards Mr Jay, to whom, of all mankind, I did not wi&s;h to have obligations of any nature.</NOTE> a debt contracted under &s;uch circum&s;tances, and for which I did not con&s;ider my&s;elf as <HI>per&s;onally re&s;pon&s;ible,</HI> I &s;hould think might rather afford matter for eulogy than reproach: May greater crimes never be imputed to me, nor &s;upported by more re&s;pectable accu&s;ers!</P>
<P>I come at la&s;t to his narrative of the affair of Pa&s;&s;y, and which I always ex|pected he would re&s;erve for a trans-atlantic di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. He begins by in&s;inua|ting

<P>At the conclu&s;ion of peace, the honorable Major-General Marquis De la Fayette, with whom I then &s;erved in the combined armies a&s;&s;embled at Ca|diz, reque&s;ted me to accompany him upon public bu&s;ine&s;s to Madrid. The letter which I had the honor to deliver from that di&s;tingui&s;hed character to Congre&s;s, in December la&s;t, will prove how far he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;atisfied with my &s;ervices upon that occa&s;ion. He afterwards prevailed upon me to pur&s;ue my journey with him to Paris, where he &s;eemed confident by his in|tere&s;t with the commi&s;&s;ioners of the United States to have me nominated to carry the definitive treaty to Congre&s;s.

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Paris,</HI> <DATE><HI>5th Sept.</HI> 1783.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear General,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE affair of the treaty is at length decided in favor of Mr. Adams's &s;ecre|tary, and, <HI>what will doubtle&s;s &s;urprize you,</HI> Mr. Jay gave the ca&s;ting vote again&s;t me. As his conduct upon this occa&s;ion has produced &s;ome &s;evere crimination between us, I think it proper to give you a recital of it in the mo&s;t <HI>minute</HI> and <HI>circum&s;tantial manner.</HI></P>
<P>The day after your departure, I waited upon him at <HI>Pa&s;&s;y,</HI> in company with Col. Ogden. He immediately informed me that my preten&s;ions to being &s;ent with the definitive treaty to Congre&s;s, were <HI>inadmi&s;&s;ible,</HI> as Dr. Frank|lin had acquie&s;ced in Mr. Adams's application in behalf of his &s;ecretary. I was mortified, but had in fact no rea&s;on to complain of the Doctor's deci&s;ion, as he was under no po&s;itive engagement to me.</P>
<P>I appeal to your own feelings, my dear general, to judge what mu&s;t have been my &s;urprize and re&s;entment, when in a conver&s;ation with Dr. Franklin, <HI>a moment after,</HI> he ab&s;olutely denied having any predilection in fa|vor of Mr. <HI>Adams's clerk,</HI> and in the mo&s;t friendly manner a&s;&s;ured me that he was happy in an occa&s;ion of &s;hewing his deference to <HI>your reque&s;t</HI> and his per&s;onal regard for me.</P>
<P>I immediately reported his an&s;wer to Mr. Jay, who <HI>then</HI> in &s;ome <HI>con|fu&s;ion,</HI> confe&s;&s;ed "that he had engaged to give his vote for Mr. Adams's &s;e|cretary." I then took leave of him, and the next morning wrote him a letter, expo&s;ing his ungenerous and unmanly conduct towards me for a long time pa&s;t; reproaching him for his <HI>want of candour in having always given both you</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a letter to me &s;ome time before the Marquis mentions, as to your car|rying the treaty, I have had tho&s;e gentlemen &s;ounded, and it appears Mr. <HI>Adams is the ONLY ONE</HI> who has a friend to &s;end.</NOTE> <HI>and
<PB N="22" REF="020462_0023_0FAF10E36A89F808">me to under&s;tand that he would be far from oppo&s;ing any ob&s;tacle to my elec|tion;</HI> and, la&s;tly, his <HI>infamous duplicity</HI> with re&s;pect to Dr. Franklin: I con|cluded with reque&s;ting him to appoint an hour when we might adju&s;t all dif|ferences and animo&s;ities, by an <HI>ultimate appeal to arms.</HI> As he did not think proper to honor me with an an&s;wer, I took the liberty to call upon him in the evening, and found him with <HI>Mr. Adams in con&s;ultation upon my letter.</HI> After &s;everal repeated and vain &s;olicitations for him to favor me with a con|ference in <HI>my way,</HI> Mr. Adams declared that <HI>he had informed Mr. Jay of Dr. Franklin's having acquie&s;ced in his application, con&s;equently Mr. Jay had been guilty of no deception in what he had &s;aid to me.</HI></P>
<P>Although I &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected the veracity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is by no means intended as an affront to Mr. Adams. I ever con|&s;idered his conduct upon that occa&s;ion as only calculated to <HI>extricate Mr. Jay</HI> from the <HI>di&s;agreeable dilemma</HI> to which he had reduced him&s;elf.</NOTE> of this declaration, it deprived me all pretext for in&s;i&s;ting upon Mr Jay's compliance with my demand; and after a &s;uperfluous di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of his former conduct, by Mr. Adams's mediati|on, I con&s;ented that the affair &s;hould be <HI>buried in oblivion.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>If the public will compare this recital, written only the <HI>third day</HI> after the tran&s;action, with that compo&s;ed by Mr. Jay the <HI>third year</HI> after, it will mo&s;t certainly appear that they do not <HI>"run parallel."</HI> In &s;upport of the facts preceding our la&s;t interview, I appeal to the te&s;timony of Col. Ogden. For what pa&s;&s;ed afterwards, if Mr. Adams recollects it, I rely too much upon his candour to fear his atte&s;tation. That an accommodation took place be|tween Mr. Jay and my&s;elf, as far as related to the affair in que&s;tion, is an un|doubted fact; as al&s;o that I apologized for having in <HI>direct terms taxed him with fal&s;ehood,</HI> after Mr. Adams had &s;tepped forward to exculpate from that charge, by attributing the mi&s;under&s;tanding to him&s;elf. To have pre&s;&s;ed the matter further, would have been an implied doubt of the veracity of that gen|tleman, which, not only decency, but infinite con&s;iderations, oppo&s;ed. My motives for <HI>cea&s;ing</HI> the enquiry are as obvious as tho&s;e which induced me to <HI>begin</HI> it.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I mu&s;t take the liberty to ob&s;erve, that if in my former publications I have avoided entering into any details upon this affair, it was only from a principle of delicacy; as I did not chu&s;e to call upon the te&s;timony of gen|tlemen by no means intere&s;ted, and who might not wi&s;h to be meddled in a conte&s;t of this nature. But this is not the fir&s;t time that Mr. Jay, by <HI>mi&s;taking</HI> my motives, has provoked me to his own lo&s;s.</NOTE></P>
<P>As to Mr. Jay's ob&s;ervation that I did not expre&s;s re&s;entment at his per&s;e|vering in his oppo&s;ition again&s;t me, I only reply that I &s;hould never con&s;ider
<PB N="23" REF="020462_0024_0FAF10E4302A6DD8">my&s;elf as ju&s;ti&s;iable in cutting any man's throat for <HI>voting again&s;t me.</HI> My challenge to him was founded upon a <HI>charge of fal&s;ehood; that ground re|moved,</HI> every thing returned of cour&s;e to its primitive &s;tate. But as his <HI>cou|rage,</HI> like his <HI>rea&s;oning,</HI> is always <HI>po&s;terior to the point in que&s;tion;</HI> he was offended, it &s;eems, at being told that I had <HI>&s;poken of the affair,</HI> and had even hinted that he had made certain admi&s;&s;ions; but, in&s;tead of ri&s;ing into anger, he &s;ays he mo&s;t heroically <HI>"avoided all intercour&s;e with me afterwards.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>p. 62.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>After this candid expo&s;ition of the principles which have actuated my con|duct, and the con&s;equences which have re&s;ulted from it, from the earlie&s;t to the pre&s;ent period of my life, the public will pronounce, <HI>for the la&s;t time,</HI> I hope, upon both. It is certain I have been too nearly connected with <HI>dark characters;</HI> but in&s;tead of ca&s;ting a &s;hade upon mine, I flatter my&s;elf they have &s;erved but to illu&s;trate it; at lea&s;t I &s;hall ever enjoy a con&s;cious &s;atisfac|tion in reflecting that the mo&s;t minute words and actions of my life, cho&s;en at an age of error, imprudence and pa&s;&s;ion, although &s;crutinized and tortured by the malice of a JAY, have afforded nothing which can be con&s;trued into a &s;tain upon honor, or a breach of the mo&s;t rigid principles of probity.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now recur once more to the mo&s;t painful part of my defence, that which re&s;pects Mr. Carmichael. A remark contained in one of Mr. Jay's notes, I confe&s;s, occa&s;ions me &s;ome unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations. He de&s;ires the public to ob&s;erve that <HI>not one of the letter which I have quoted from Mr. Carmi|chael, is of a date po&s;terior to the time of my departure from Paris in</HI> 1784. The fact is mo&s;t certainly true, and his allu&s;ion to it, I confe&s;s has excited a doubt in my brea&s;t, which, for the honor of friend&s;hip and philanthropy, I could wi&s;h had been forever a &s;tranger to it! It is true, I repeat, from the time of my departure from Paris at the time alluded to, I have never received one line from Mr. Carmichael! I was &s;o far, however, from imputing the cau&s;e of his &s;ilence to any other motive than the con&s;equences re&s;ulting from my own &s;ituation,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I was then upon a tour through mo&s;t of the ea&s;tern, and great part of the northern &s;tates of Europe; from which I never returned nearer to France than Hambourg, where I embarked for America. Mr. Carmichael was in <HI>Spain.</HI></NOTE> that I continued to write to him in the &s;ame friendly and affectionate manner. The &s;u&s;picion is, however, at pre&s;ent, but too well founded, of his having acted in <HI>collu&s;ion with Mr. Jay;</HI> in con&s;equence I think it prudent to make &s;uch a preparatory defence as is become nece&s;&s;ary for my own ju&s;tification, and at the &s;ame time cannot be injurious to Mr. Carmichael, unle&s;s he &s;hould indeed prove an apo&s;tate from honor.</P>

In Mr. Jay's publication of the 7th December, 1785, are the&s;e words, to which he has al&s;o adhered in his late pamphlet: "I neither <HI>&s;hewed</HI> not <HI>men|tioned to him</HI> (Mr. Carmichael) <HI>Mr. Littlepage's letter, nor any of its con|tents.</HI> In the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation HE <HI>mentioned him, and intimated</HI> HE <HI>had good rea&s;on to believe that Mr. Littlepage had played a</HI> DOUBLE GAME <HI>between us."</HI> Here Mr. Jay is entirely pa&s;&s;ive;&mdash;Mr. Carmichael, without <HI>object</HI> or <HI>&s;timulative, introduces my name,</HI> &s;tained by the mo&s;t poi&s;onous breath of calumny:&mdash;Without further calling in que&s;tion the verity of Mr. Jay's allegation, I &s;hall proceed to an&s;wer directly to the charge:</P>
<P>The words attributed to Mr. Carmichael fix the date of his accu&s;ation again&s;t me at the expre&s;s period of Mr. Jay's departure from Madrid in 1782: he <HI>"then received me into his hou&s;e, advanced me money, and in return I revealed Mr. Jay's &s;ecrets."</HI> Such is the &s;ub&s;tance of the 'charge; for a moment admitting it, what follows?&mdash;If Mr. Carmichael does not confe&s;s him&s;elf lo&s;t to every manly virtue, and even deaf to the voice of prudence, he ought at lea&s;t to have regarded me as a dangerous confident, and in future to have avoided any connexion or intimacy between us. Even admiting that policy would have ju&s;tified him in <HI>tempori&s;ing</HI> &s;ome time longer with me, views of that nature could not &s;urely have extended his &s;entiments to "the <HI>prudence</HI> of a <HI>guardian</HI> and the <HI>warmth</HI> of a <HI>brother."</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His own words, which I have quoted on a former occa&s;ion.</NOTE> POLICY might have induced him to advance me money to &s;erve a campaign, where he thought the honor of the <HI>American name</HI> intere&s;ted: but will that account for the expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>friend&s;hip</HI> and <HI>affection,</HI> with which his <HI>letters</HI> conti|nually abound?&mdash;One moment he pours forth the mo&s;t <HI>virulent complaints again&s;t Mr. Jay,</HI> congratulates me upon my being no longer connected with him, as I &s;hould certainly, at la&s;t, have <HI>experienced the fate of Living&s;ton and him&s;elf:</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide my publication of the 7th December.</NOTE> and, <HI>without the mo&s;t di&s;tant allu&s;ion to the point in que&s;|tion,</HI> often conjure me, <HI>"to defend him if ever he is attacked."</HI> In another in&s;tance he becomes the champion of my own honor, and on the 21&s;t of Jan. 1783, writes to me, "<HI>Per&s;evere</HI> in the <HI>&s;ame line</HI> of conduct which has ac|quired you the e&s;teem of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed characters, and <HI>make your&s;elf ea&s;y</HI> on account of any <HI>in&s;inuations which may be infu&s;ed into your friends</HI> to your prejudice. Mr. Adams knows me too well not to be per|&s;uaded, that I <HI>would never advi&s;e you</HI> to pur&s;uits which are either impru|dent or <HI>di&s;honorable.</HI>"</P>
<P>The la&s;t word might have been &s;pared, according to the opinion which, <HI>he tells Mr. Jay,</HI> he had <HI>long before</HI> conceived of me. But admitting him
<PB N="25" REF="020462_0026_0FAF10E7458E0EE0">to have been influenced by POLICY alone during the whole time of my re&s;i|dence in <HI>Spain;</HI>&mdash;he continues the <HI>&s;ame &s;tile</HI> for more than a <HI>year</HI> after my arrival in <HI>Paris.</HI> In the fir&s;t letter which I received from him in that capital, he &s;ays, "I hope the plea&s;ures of Paris will not ab&s;orb you &s;o entirely as to make you forget your friends here, and particularly <HI>one who loves you as much as I do.</HI>" In the &s;ame letter he ob&s;erves, "I am curious to know how you have been received by your <HI>quondam friends.</HI> Continue to conduct your&s;elf with the <HI>&s;ame di&s;cretion,</HI> that you have <HI>hitherto</HI> done, and you will avoid any <HI>handle of mi&s;repre&s;entation to your di&s;advantage.</HI>" In another letter to me of the 30th March, 1783, are the&s;e words: "I hope your <HI>friend|&s;hip</HI> will induce you to communicate to me whatever you may learn which <HI>intere&s;ts me per&s;onally.</HI> It is unnece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that not even your friend|&s;hip for another can ju&s;tify the <HI>&s;malle&s;t breach of confidence." That,</HI> it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, would have been a &s;evere piece of &s;atire upon a per&s;on who&s;e fir&s;t connexion with him had been founded upon a <HI>&s;imilar</HI> act of trea|chery. In a letter of the 18th Augu&s;t, 1783, he mentions to me a de&s;ign of coming to Paris: "I had &s;ome thoughts of coming to Paris, if reflections upon the <HI>nature of my &s;ituation,</HI> and the advice and repre&s;eatations of *** had not decided me to remain here. This voyage would have been u&s;eful to my health, and highly agreeable to me on many accounts, particu|larly in <HI>affording me the occa&s;ion of removing any prejudices which may have been conceived again&s;t me by per&s;ons whom I e&s;teem.</HI>"</P>
<P>Far was I from fore&s;eeing that the object of his journey would at la&s;t be to <HI>purcha&s;e an accommodation</HI> with <HI>our common enemy</HI> at the price of <HI>my honor.</HI></P>
<P>Further remarks upon our corre&s;pondence would at pre&s;ent be unnece&s;&s;ary; the whole of it will probably be laid before the public; at lea&s;t, if Mr. Car|michael thinks it proper, I &s;hall be far from objecting to the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Although I ardently wi&s;h that he may <HI>&s;till</HI> appear <HI>worthy</HI> of the public and my own <HI>e&s;teem,</HI> I mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time declare, that I have nothing to apprehend from his <HI>enmity.</HI> Whether he may be induced by policy to <HI>avow,</HI> or by a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame to <HI>deny,</HI> the accu&s;ation again&s;t me, which Mr. Jay attributes to him, his &s;ituation will be embarra&s;&s;ing. All that I have to ask of him, is to take at once a <HI>decided</HI> part;&mdash;I have fought too long in the dark; let me &s;ee my enemy and I can never fear him in a cau&s;e like this.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent I &s;hall not trouble the public further upon his account, than by in&s;erting the following letter, which I wrote to him immediately after my late arrival in Europe, and upon which his <HI>&s;ilence,</HI> more than all the re&s;t, appears <HI>problematical.</HI></P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB N="26" REF="020462_0027_0FAF10E84C999DD0">
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Paris,</HI> <DATE><HI>20th January,</HI> 1786.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This letter, it will be ea&s;ily &s;een, was never intended for the public: it was written at a time when I would have pledged my honor and life upon Mr. Carmichael's friend&s;hip for me; his indignation at what Mr. Jay has thrown upon him, I was confident, would have equalled my own; but a &s;ilence of more than four months has given ri&s;e to conjectures of a different na|ture.</NOTE>I HAVE now to communicate an affair of a different nature to you:&mdash; lately took place between Jay and my&s;elf, and in which you are equally in|tere&s;ted.</P>
<P>For my own part, there is nothing in that bu&s;ine&s;s of which I either repent or have need to be a&s;hamed: <HI>in&s;ulted,</HI> almo&s;t <HI>di&s;honored</HI> in the eyes of the world, expo&s;ed to the malicious in&s;inuations of a wretch, who&s;e every wi&s;h and effort has for a &s;eries of time been to injure and di&s;tre&s;s me in every noble pur&s;uit; denied the &s;atisfaction of a man of honor, an appeal to the public was the only re&s;ource which remained to me, to vindicate my own character, and was perhaps at the &s;ame time no &s;light revenge upon a man who&s;e exi&s;tence depends upon his popularity, and who&s;e malice had furni&s;h|ed me with &s;uch ample materials again&s;t him.</P>
<P>How far the <HI>origin</HI> of our conte&s;t <HI>had reference to your&s;elf,</HI> you will ea&s;ily perceive, as well, I pre&s;ume, as <HI>Jay's motives in turning the di&s;pute upon you.</HI></P>
<P>As to the letter which he had quoted from me to your di&s;advantage, you can be little &s;urpri&s;ed at it; both my &s;ituation and your own, at that time, rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for any explanation to take place between us, and as I only knew you from <HI>Jay's report</HI> and <HI>repre&s;entation,</HI> I certainly beheld you in a <HI>mo&s;t unfavourable point of view.</HI> That, however, I have an&s;wered to the public, and had previou&s;ly explained, to <HI>your intire ju&s;tification,</HI> to my friends in Virginia; to your&s;elf I never could have mentioned it, under <HI>any other circum&s;tances than the pre&s;ent,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">After my rupture with Mr. Jay at Pa&s;&s;y, I more than once had it in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> to demand that letter of the 15th June, from him, or in&s;i&s;t upon the li|berty of communicating its contents to Mr. Carmichael: but the apparent improbability of his ever attempting to make u&s;e of it to the di&s;advantage of that gentleman, after my <HI>known connexion with him,</HI> prevented me from executing that de&s;ign. As to that letter's being turned again&s;t <HI>me,</HI> I confe&s;s it was a &s;troke of <HI>Jayitical artifice</HI> and <HI>impudence,</HI> which I never expected.</NOTE> without a breach of confidence, from whence I &s;hould ju&s;tly have incurred a di&s;honor which my enemy has gene|rou&s;ly taken upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="020462_0028_0FAF10E8AAD03868">
From you I have now to demand a more &s;erious eclairci&s;&s;ement: YOUR NAME <HI>has been u&s;ed to traduce and vilify my character,</HI> at the very moment in which every effort was made on my part that could in the lea&s;t contribute to your &s;ervice;&mdash;while, glowing with the warmth of friend&s;hip, <HI>my heart</HI> and <HI>confidence were open to you;</HI>&mdash;is it po&s;&s;ible that you could have &s;acrificed <HI>my fame</HI> for the <HI>contemptible object of</HI> PAYING COURT <HI>to a man whom you knew to be your</HI> MORTAL ENEMY, <HI>and who&s;e implacable enmi|ty I had incurred</HI> ONLY <HI>upon</HI> YOUR ACCOUNT?&mdash;<HI>The accu&s;ation again&s;t me</HI> YOU BEST KNOW <HI>to be a mo&s;t</HI> ATROCIOUS <HI>and</HI> INFAMOUS FALSE|HOOD. During the whole time of my re&s;idence in Spain, after Jay's departure, I <HI>never gave you the mo&s;t</HI> DISTANT HINT OF HIS DESIGN IN LEAVING ME AT MADRID, <HI>nor did you ever &s;ee his cypher or one line of the corre&s;pondence between him and me during or previous to the &s;iege of Mahon.</HI> I well remember, that after the open rupture which took place between us in Paris in 1783, I no longer made a &s;ecret of <HI>that,</HI> or any other circum&s;tance relative to either him&s;elf or me. One of my charges again&s;t him in the challenge which I &s;ent to him at Pa&s;&s;y, was <HI>"his infamous inten|tion of employing me as a &s;py upon you."</HI> That letter had been &s;een by &s;e|veral per&s;ons; &mdash;was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by Jay and my&s;elf, in pre&s;ence of Mr. Adams, and, in &s;hort, the <HI>whole contents of it no longer a &s;ecret.</HI> Of all this I have, at different periods <HI>&s;ince,</HI> mo&s;t certainly informed both <HI>you and others;</HI> but <HI>your</HI> &s;ituation and <HI>my own</HI> was then entirely changed, and the communica|tions which I <HI>afterwards</HI> made to you, very different from the charge brought again&s;t me, <HI>upon your authority,</HI> viz. "that after Jay's departure from Madrid, you had received me into your hou&s;e and lent me money, and that in con&s;equence I had betrayed his confidence."</P>
<P>This, &s;ir, you mu&s;t an&s;wer to me, to the world, and to your own con|&s;cience.</P>
<P>I e&s;teem you too much to &s;uppo&s;e that your ju&s;tification will not be &s;a|tisfactory, but, <HI>until that takes place,</HI> you will excu&s;e me for ob&s;erving, that all corre&s;pondence mu&s;t cea&s;e between us.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Meaning the friendly corre&s;pondence which formerly &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us, and which could not be re&s;umed until Mr. Carmichael had ju&s;tified me to the public.

<TRAILER><HI>The Hon. Wm. Carmichael,</HI> &amp;c.</TRAILER>
</LETTER>
<P>I mu&s;t now add, that I expect his an&s;wer from the pre&s;s: To the awful tri|bunal of the public I refer him; there let him an&s;wer to his charges. I &s;hall conclude by one LAST APPEAL to his <HI>honor and veracity;</HI> nay more, by <HI>warning him to remember,</HI> that although I may have been THE DUPE OF ARTIFICE, I tru&s;t I &s;hall never become THE VICTIM OF TREACHERY.</P>
<P>As I have the vanity to think that I &s;hall live for &s;ome time in Mr. Jay's memory, I &s;hall once more de&s;cend to addre&s;s a &s;hort apo&s;trophe to him, which I hope will clo&s;e our corre&s;pondence for ever.</P>
<P>TO YOU, SIR, However degraded in the public and your own opinion; although reduced &s;o low, that even revenge has lo&s;t its edge, and puni&s;hment becomes a cruelty;&mdash;TO YOU I once more addre&s;s my&s;elf. A di&s;tance of near two thou&s;and leagues now &s;eparates us;&mdash;read then with as little emotion as the &s;tings of con&s;cience will permit you.</P>
<P>After having exhau&s;ted every &s;haft of calumny and malice; after having &s;a|crificed your reputation in one in&s;tance, your probity in another, and your vanity in all; in what light do you now appear before the tribunal of your country? You have been proved to have <HI>denied facts,</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;erted fal&s;ehoods;</HI> your name is become a &s;atire upon honor, and would di&s;credit even truth: What, after all, was your object? To cru&s;h an enemy, who&s;e tender age, even &s;uppo&s;ing it had afforded you the advantage over him, which you ex|pected, would have rendered your conduct <HI>odious,</HI> and your victory <HI>unmanly:</HI> But to have failed in the attempt, has &s;ubjected you at once to contempt and ri|dicule! You have &s;uffered your&s;elf to be guided by a principle of malice, un|&s;upported by courage &s;ufficient to &s;ave you from di&s;grace: I am even willing to believe that &s;ome of your ill qualities proceed from this inherent <HI>weakne&s;s of mind;</HI> and it may not appear the only paradox in your character to ob|&s;erve, that if nature had endued you with a greater portion of courage, &s;he would have rendered you a <HI>more noble,</HI> and perhaps, <HI>le&s;s formidable</HI> enemy. In a word, you po&s;&s;e&s;s all the qualities of a bad man without firmne&s;s enough to dignify guilt: One ingredient more in your mental compo&s;ition would have qualified you to act the part of a <HI>Cataline;</HI> the want of it has left you a JAY. Vindictive from principle, an hypocrite from &s;y&s;tem, and a coward from con|&s;titution, you lead the life of a <HI>Bevot,</HI> with the principles of an <HI>Athei&s;t,</HI> and perhaps may be at la&s;t compelled to die the death of a <HI>Martyr,</HI> without the reputation of &s;anctity or courage.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="020462_0030_0FAF10EA5122E2F8">
As to what has happened, without affecting moderation, or betraying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, believe me, I never wi&s;hed to bring it forward: A &s;tate of war could never be de&s;irable with you, where revenge is almo&s;t di&s;honor, and triumph becomes humiliation.</P>
<P>Profit at lea&s;t from the bitter con&s;equences of your own imprudence, nor, like an ob&s;tinate &s;lave, become hardened by the &s;courge.</P>
<P>Be &s;atisfied with the contempt, and do not provoke the execration of the public; to avoid it, &s;ink to your <HI>primitive ob&s;curity;</HI> render, at la&s;t, one <HI>real</HI> &s;ervice to your country, by retiring from a po&s;t, which, eminent as it is, can never be honorable while filled by you; <HI>you may then de&s;erve to be for|gotten.</HI></P>
<P>Scorched by the rays of truth, fly for &s;helter to the &s;hade of oblivion; and beware how in future you excite the breath of rumour upon a character which only <HI>rots</HI> when <HI>undi&s;turbed,</HI> but <HI>falls to pieces if agitated.</HI></P>
