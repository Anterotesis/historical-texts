<HEAD>TO THE INHABITANTS OF KIDDERMINSTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF either I or my labours have any thing of public u&s;e or worth, it is wholly (though not only) yours. And I am convinced by Provi|dence, that it is the will of <HI>GOD</HI> it &s;hould be &s;o. This I clearly di&s;cerned in my fir&s;t coming to you, in my former abode with you, and in the time of my forced ab&s;ence from you. When I was &s;epa|rated by the mi&s;eries of the late unhappy war, I dur&s;t not &s;ix in any other congregation, but lived in a military unplea&s;ing &s;tate, le&s;t I &s;hould fore&s;tal my return to you. The offers of greater worldly accommodations were no temptatied to me once to que&s;tion whether I &s;hould have you: your free invitation of my return, your ceedi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> to my doctrine, the &s;trong affection which I have yet towards you above all people, and the gene|ral hearly return of love which I find from you, do all per&s;uade me, that I was &s;ent into the world e&s;pecially for the &s;ervice of your &s;end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="iv" REF="022331_0003_0FB7F48C1501BF20">and that even when I am dead, I might be yet a help to your &s;alvation, the <HI>LORD</HI> hath forced me, quite be&s;ide my own re&s;olution, to write thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> treati&s;e, and leave it in your hands. It was far from my thoughts ever to have become thus pub|lic, and burdened the world with any writing of mine: therefore have I often re&s;i&s;ted the reque&s;t of my reverend brethren, and &s;ome &s;uperiors, who might el&s;e have commanded much more at my hands. But &s;ee how <HI>GOD</HI> over-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">leth and cro&s;&s;eth our re&s;olutions!</P>
<P>Being in my quarters far from home, ca&s;t into extreme langui&s;hing (by the &s;udden lo&s;s of about a gallon of blood, after many years fore|going weakne&s;s) and having no acquaintance about me, nor any book but my Bible, and living in continual expectation of death, I bent my thoughts on my everla&s;ting re&s;t: and becau&s;e my memory, through extreme weakne&s;s, was imper|fect, I took my pen, and began to draw up my own funeral &s;ermon, or &s;ome help for my own meditations of heaven, to &s;weeten both the re&s;t of my life, and my death. In this condition <HI>GOD</HI> was plea&s;ed to continue me about five months from home; where being able for nothing el&s;e, I went on with this work, which lengthened to this which you here &s;ee. It is no wonder therefore if I be too abrupt in the beginning, &s;eeing I then
<PB N="v" REF="022331_0004_0FB7F48DB2CC5560">intended but the length of a &s;ermon or two. Much le&s;s may you wonder if the whole be very imperfect, &s;eeing it was written as it were with one foot in the grave, by a man that was betwixt the living and dead, that wanted &s;trength of na|ture to quicken invention or affection, and had no book but his Bible, while the chief part was fini&s;hed. But how &s;weet is this Providence now to my review, which &s;o happily forced me to that work of meditation, which I had formerly found &s;o profitable to my &s;oul! and &s;hewed me more mercy in depriving me of other helps, than I was aware of! and hath cau&s;ed my thoughts to feed on this heavenly &s;ubject, which hath more bene|fited me than all the &s;tudies of my life.</P>
<P>And now, dear friends, &s;uch as it is, I here offer it you; and upon the knees of my &s;oul, I offer up my thanks to the merciful <HI>GOD,</HI> who hath fetched up both me and it, as from the grave for your &s;ervice: who rever&s;ed the &s;entence of pre|&s;ent death, which by the able&s;t phy&s;icians was pa&s;t upon me! who interrupted my public labours for a time, that he might trace me to do you a more la&s;ting &s;ervice, which el&s;e I had never been like to have attempted! That <HI>GOD</HI> do I heartily ble&s;s and magnify, who hath re&s;ened me from the many dangers of four years war, and after &s;o many tedious nights and days, and &s;o many doleful
<PB N="vi" REF="022331_0005_0FB7F48FD6FFCD58">&s;ights and tidings, hath returned me, and many of your&s;elves, and reprieved us now to &s;erve him in peace! And though men be ungrateful, and my body ruined beyond hope of recovery; yet he hath made up all in the comforts I have in you. To the <HI>GOD</HI> of mercy I do here offer up my mo&s;t hearty thanks, who hath not rejected my prayers, but hath by a wonder delivered me in the mid&s;t of my duties: and hath &s;upported me the&s;e four|teen years in a langui&s;hing &s;tate, wherein I have &s;carce had a waking hour free from pain; who hath above twenty &s;everal times delivered me when I was near death. And though he hath made me &s;pend my days in groans and tears, and in a con&s;tant expectation of my change, yet he hath not wholly di&s;abled me for his &s;ervice; and here|by hath more effectually &s;ubdued my pride, and made this world contemptible to me, and forced my dull heart to more importunate reque&s;ts, and occa&s;ioned more rare di&s;coveries of his mercy than ever I could have expected in a pro&s;perous &s;tate.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> This Re&s;t defined.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not only our intere&s;t in GOD, and actual fruition of him, which was lo&s;t in <HI>Adam</HI>'s fall; but all &s;piritual knowledge of him, and true di&s;po&s;i|tion towards &s;uch a felicity. Man hath now an heart too &s;uitable to his e&s;tate; a low &s;tate, and a low &s;pirit. As the poor man that would not believe that any one man had &s;uch a &s;um as an hundred pounds, it was &s;o far above what he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: &s;o man will hardly now believe, that there is &s;uch an happine&s;s as once he had, much le&s;s as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath now procured.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle be&s;tows mo&s;t of this epi&s;tle in proving to the <HI>Jews,</HI> that the end of all ceremonies and &s;ha|dows, is to direct them to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> the &s;ub&s;tance; and that the re&s;t of &s;abbaths, and <HI>Canaan,</HI> &s;hould teach them to look for a future re&s;t. My text is his conclu&s;ion after divers arguments to that end; a con|clu&s;ion
<PB N="8" REF="022331_0007_0FB7F493E95B3438">&s;o u&s;eful to a believer, as containing the ground of all his comforts, the end of all his duty and &s;uffer|ings, that you may ea&s;ily be &s;atisfied, why I have made in the &s;ubject of my pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e. What more welcome to men under afflictions, than re&s;t? What more welcome news to men under public calamities? Hearers, I pray GOD your entertainment of it, be but half an&s;werable to the excellency of the &s;ubject; and then you will have cau&s;e to ble&s;s GOD, while you live, that ever you heard it, as I have that ever I &s;tu|died it.</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. What this re&s;t is.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. What the&s;e people of GOD, and why &s;o called.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The truth of this from other &s;cripture-arguments.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Why this re&s;t mu&s;t yet remain.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Why only to the people of GOD.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. What u&s;e to make of it.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And though the &s;en&s;e of the text includes in the word <HI>re&s;t,</HI> all that ea&s;e and &s;afety which a &s;oul, wea|ried with the burden of &s;in and &s;uffering, and pur&s;ued by law, wrath and con&s;cience, hath with <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in this life, the re&s;t of grace: yet becau&s;e it chiefly intends the re&s;t of eternal glory, I &s;hall con&s;ine my di&s;cour&s;e to this.</P>
<P>The re&s;t here in que&s;tion, is, the mo&s;t happy e&s;tate of a chri&s;tian, having obtained the end of his cour&s;e; or, it is the perfect endle&s;s fruition of GOD by the per|fected &s;aints, according to the mea&s;ure of their capa|city, to which their &s;ouls arrive at death: and both &s;oul and body mo&s;t fully after the re&s;urrection and final judgment.</P>
<P N="1">1. I call it the e&s;tate of a chri&s;tian, to note both the active and pa&s;&s;ive fruition, wherein a chri&s;tian's ble&s;&s;edne&s;s lies, and the e&s;tabli&s;hed continuance of both. Our title will be perfect, and perfectly clear|ed;
<PB N="9" REF="022331_0008_0FB7F4955E56C4F8">our&s;elves, and &s;o our capacity perfected; our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and &s;ecurity for its perpetuity perfect; our reception from GOD perfect; and therefore our fru|ition of him, and con&s;equently our happine&s;s, will then be perfect. And this is the e&s;tate which we now briefly mention, and &s;hall afterwards more fully de|&s;cribe.</P>
<P N="2">2. I call it the mo&s;t happy e&s;tate, to difference it not only from all &s;eeming happine&s;s which is to be found in the enjoyment of creatures, but al&s;o from all tho&s;e beginnings, foreta&s;tes, and imperfect degrees which we have in this life.</P>
<P N="3">3. I call it the e&s;tate of a chri&s;tian, where I mean only the &s;incere, regenerate, &s;anctified chri&s;tian, who&s;e &s;oul having di&s;covered that excellency in GOD through <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> clo&s;eth with him, and is cordially &s;et upon him.</P>
<P N="4">4. I add, That this happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in obtaining the end, where I mean the ultimate and principal end, not any &s;ubordinate or le&s;s principal end. O how much doth our everla&s;ting &s;tate depend on our right judgment and e&s;timation of our end!</P>
<P>But it is a doubt with many, whether the attain|ment of this glory may be our end? Nay, concluded, that it is mercenary: yea, that to make &s;alvation the end of duty, is to be a Legali&s;t, and act under a co|venant of works, who&s;e tenor is, <HI>Do this and live.</HI> And mony that think it may be our end, yet think it may not be our ultimate end; for that &s;hould be only the glory of GOD. I &s;hall an&s;wer the&s;e briefly.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is properly called mercenary, when we expect it as wages for work done; and &s;o we may not make it our end. Otherwi&s;e it is only &s;uch a mercinarine&s;s as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> commandeth. For con&s;ider what this end
<PB N="10" REF="022331_0009_0FB7F4968BD870B0">is; it is the fruition of GOD in <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> and if &s;eek|ing <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> be mercenary, I de&s;ire to be &s;o mercenary.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is not a note of a Legali&s;t neither. It hath been the ground of a multitude of late mi&s;takes in divinity, to think, that <HI>Do this and live,</HI> is only the language of the covenant of works. It is true, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e it is; but in other, not. The law of works only &s;aith, <HI>Do this</HI> (that is, perfectly fulfil the whole law) <HI>and live,</HI> (that is, for &s;o doing): But the law of grace &s;aith, <HI>Do this and live,</HI> too: that is, believe in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;eek him, obey him &s;incerely, as thy LORD and King: for&s;ake all, &s;uffer all things, and overcome, and by &s;o doing, or in &s;o doing, you &s;hall live. If you &s;et up the abrogated duties of the law again, you are a Le|gali&s;t: if you &s;et up the duties of the go&s;pel in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s &s;tead, in whole or in part, you err &s;till. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath his place and work; duty hath its place and work too: &s;et it but in its own place, and expect from it but its own part, and you go right: yea, more, (how un&s;a|voury &s;oever the phra&s;e may &s;eem) you may, &s;o far as this comes to, tru&s;t to your duty and works; that is, for their own part: and many mi&s;carry in expecting nothing from them, (as to pray, and to expect nothing the more) that is, from <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in a way of duty. For if duty have no &s;hare, why may we not tru&s;t <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as well in a way of di&s;obedience as duty? In a word, you mu&s;t both u&s;e and tru&s;t duty in &s;ubordination to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> but neither u&s;e them nor tru&s;t them in co-or|dination with him. So that this derogates nothing from <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> for he hath done, and will do all his work perfectly, and enableth his people to do theirs: yet he is not properly &s;aid to do it him&s;elf; he believes not, repents not, but worketh the&s;e in them; that is, enableth and exciteth them to it. No man mu&s;t look for more from duty than GOD hath laid upon it; and &s;o much we may and mu&s;t.</P>

2. If I &s;hould quote all the &s;criptures that plainly prove this, I &s;hould tran&s;cribe a great part of the bi|ble: I will therefore only de&s;ire you to &s;tudy what to|lerable interpretation can be given of the following places, which will not prove that life and &s;alvation may be, yea, mu&s;t be the end of duty. <HI>John</HI> v. 40. <HI>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</HI> Matt. xi. 12. <HI>The kingdom of heaven &s;uffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</HI> Matt. vii. 13. Luke xiii. 24. <HI>Strive to enter in at the &s;trait gate.</HI> Phil. ii. 12. <HI>Work out your &s;alvation with fear and trembling.</HI> Rom. ii. 7, 10. <HI>To them who by patient continuance in well|doing, &s;eek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eter|nal life. Glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good.</HI> 1 Cor. ix. 24. <HI>So run that ye may obtain.</HI> 2 Tim. ii. 12. <HI>If we &s;uffer with him, we &s;hall reign with him.</HI> 1 Tim. vi. 12. <HI>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life.</HI> 1 Tim. vi. 18, 19. <HI>That they do good works, laying up a good foundation again&s;t the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</HI> Rev. xxii. 14. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and enter in by the gates into the city.</HI> Matt. xxv. 34, 35, 36. <HI>Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>For I was an hungred, and ye,</HI> &amp;c. Luke xi. 28. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they that hear the word of</HI> GOD, <HI>and keep it.</HI> Yea, the e&s;caping of hell is a right end of duty to a believer. Heb. iv. 1. <HI>Let us fear, left a promi&s;e being left us of entering into his re&s;t, any of you &s;hould come &s;hort of it.</HI> Luke xii. 5. <HI>Fear him that is able to de&s;troy both &s;oul and body in hell; yea,</HI> (what&s;oever others &s;ay) <HI>I &s;ay unto you, fear him.</HI> 1 Cor. ix. 27. <HI>I keep under my body, and bring it into &s;ubjection; le&s;t, when I have preached to others, I my&s;elf &s;hould he a ca&s;t-away.</HI> Multitudes of &s;criptures and &s;cripture-arguments might be brought, but the&s;e may &s;uffice to any that believe &s;cripture.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="12" REF="022331_0011_0FB7F49B606390A0">
3. For tho&s;e that think this re&s;t may be our end, but not our ultimate end, that mu&s;t be GOD's glory only: I will not gain&s;ay them. Only let them con|&s;ider, <HI>What</HI> GOD <HI>hath joined, man mu&s;t not &s;eparate.</HI> The glorifying him&s;elf, and the &s;aving of his people, (as I judge) are not two ends with GOD, but one; to glorify his mercy in their falvation: &s;o I think they &s;hould be with us together intended: we &s;hould aim at the glory of GOD (not alone con&s;idered, with|out our &s;alvation, but) in our &s;alvation. Therefore I know no warrant for putting &s;uch a que&s;tion to our|&s;elves, as &s;ome do, whether we could be content to be damned, &s;o GOD were glorified? <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath put no &s;uch que&s;tions to us, nor bid us put &s;uch to our|&s;elves. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> had rather that men would enquire af|ter their true willingne&s;s to be &s;aved than their wil|lingne&s;s to be damned. Sure I am, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf is offered to faith, in terms for the mo&s;t part re&s;pecting the welfare of the &s;inner, more than his own ab&s;tract|ed glory. He would be received as a Saviour, medi|ator, redeemer, reconciler, and interce&s;&s;or. And all the precepts of &s;cripture being backed with &s;o many promi&s;es and threatnings, every one intended of GOD, as a motive to us, imply as much.</P>
<P N="4">4. I call a chri&s;tian's happine&s;s, the end of his cour&s;e, thereby meaning, as <HI>Paul.</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. 7. the whole &s;cope of his life. For &s;alvation may and mu&s;t be our end; and not only the end of our faith, (tho' that principally) but of all our actions: For as what|&s;oever we do, mu&s;t be done to the glory of GOD, &s;o mu&s;t they all be done to our &s;alvation.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> I make happine&s;s to con&s;i&s;t in this end obtained; for it is not the mere promi&s;e of it that immediately makes perfectly happy, nor <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s mere purcha&s;e, nor our mere &s;eeking, but the apprehend|ing and obtaining, which &s;ets the crown on the &s;aint's head.</P>

<ITEM>(2.) Some things contained in it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3.) Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the&s;e things are pre-&s;uppo&s;ed to this re&s;t.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. A per&s;on in motion, &s;eeking re&s;t. This is man here in the way: angels have it already; and the de|vils are pa&s;t hope.</P>
<P N="2">2. An end towards which he m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">th for re&s;t. This can be only GOD. He that taketh any thing el&s;e for happine&s;s, is out of the way the fir&s;t &s;tep. The prin|cipal damning &s;in, is, to make any thing be&s;ides GOD our end or re&s;t. And the fir&s;t true &s;aving act, is, to choo&s;e GOD only for our end and happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. A di&s;tance is pre-&s;uppo&s;ed from this end, el&s;e there can be no motion towards it. This &s;ad di&s;tance is the ca&s;e of all mankind &s;ince the fall: it was our GOD that we principally lo&s;t, and were &s;hut out of his gracious pre&s;ence; and &s;ince are &s;aid to be <HI>with|out him in the world:</HI> nay, in all men, at age, here is &s;uppo&s;ed, not only a di&s;tance, but al&s;o a contrary motion. When <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> comes with regenerating, &s;av|ing grace, he finds no man &s;itting &s;till, but all po&s;t|ing to eternal ruin; till, by conviction, he fir&s;t brings them to a &s;tand, and by conver&s;ion, turns fir&s;t their hearts, and then their lives, to him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="14" REF="022331_0013_0FB7F4ADA43AA880">
4. Here is pre-&s;uppo&s;ed the knowledge of the true ultimate end, and its excellency; and a &s;erious in|tending it. For &s;o the motion of the rational crea|ture proceedeth: an unknown end, is no end; it is a contradiction. We cannot make that our end, which we know not; nor that our chief end which we know not, or judge not to be the chief good. Therefore where this is not known, that GOD is this end; there is no obtaining re&s;t in any ordinary way, what&s;oever may be in ways that by GOD are kept &s;ecret.</P>
<P N="5">5. Here is pre-&s;uppo&s;ed, not only a di&s;tance from this re&s;t, but al&s;o the true knowledge of this di&s;tance. If a man have lo&s;t his way, and know it not, he &s;eeks not to return: therefore they that never knew they were without GOD, never yet enjoyed him; and they that never knew they were actually in the way to hell, did never yet know the way to heaven: nay, there will not only be a knowledge of this di&s;tance, and lo&s;t e&s;tate, but affections an&s;werable. Can a man find him&s;elf on the brink of hell, and not tremble? Or find he hath lo&s;t his GOD, and his &s;oul, and not cry out, <HI>I am undone!</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Here is al&s;o pre-&s;uppo&s;ed, a &s;uperior moving cau&s;e, el&s;e &s;hould we all &s;tand &s;till, and not move a &s;tep forward toward our re&s;t; no more than the infe|rior wheels in the watch would &s;tir, if you take away the &s;pring, or the fir&s;t mover. This is GOD. If GOD move us not, we cannot move. Therefore it is a mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary part of our chri&s;tian wi&s;dom, to keep our &s;ubordination to GOD, and dependance on him; to be &s;till in the path where he walks, and in that way where his Spirit doth mo&s;t u&s;ually move.</P>
<P N="7">7. Here is pre-&s;uppo&s;ed, an internal principle of life in the per&s;on. GOD moves not man like a &s;tone, but by enduing him fir&s;t with life, (not to enable him
<PB N="15" REF="022331_0014_0FB7F4AE99B84A20">to move without GOD, but) thereby to qualify him to move him&s;elf, in &s;ubordination to GOD, the fir&s;t mover.</P>
<P N="8">8. Here is pre-&s;uppo&s;ed al&s;o, &s;uch a motion as is rightly ordered and directed toward the end. Not all motion or labour brings to re&s;t. Every way leads not to this end; but he who&s;e goodne&s;s hath appointed the end, hath in his wi&s;dom, and by his &s;overeign authority, appointed the way. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is the door, the only way to this re&s;t. Some will allow nothing el&s;e to be called the way, le&s;t it derogate from <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> The truth is, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is the only way to the Father: yet faith is the way to <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and go&s;pel-obedience, or faith and works, the way for tho&s;e to walk in, that are in <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. There is &s;uppo&s;ed al&s;o, a &s;trong and con&s;tant motion, which may reach the end.

They that have been mo&s;t holy, watchful, painful to get to heaven, find, when they come to die, all too little: we &s;ee daily the be&s;t chri&s;tians, when dying, repent their negligence: I never knew any then repent his holine&s;s and diligence. It would grieve a man's &s;oul to &s;ee a multitude of mi&s;taken &s;inners lay out their care and pains for a thing of nought, and think to have eternal &s;alvation with a wi&s;h. If the way to heaven be not far harder than the world imagines. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his apo&s;tles knew not the way: for they have told us, <HI>That the kingdom of heaven &s;uffereth vio|lence; that the gate is &s;trait, and the way nar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">w; and we mu&s;t &s;trive, if we will enter; for many &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;eek to enter, and not be able,</HI> (which implies, the faintne&s;s of their &s;eeking, and that they put not &s;trength to the work;) and <HI>that the righteous them&s;elves are &s;carcely &s;aved.</HI></P>

He hath purcha&s;ed the crown to be&s;tow, only on condition of believing, denying all for him, &s;uffering with him, per&s;evering and overcoming. He hath purcha&s;ed ju&s;|tification to be&s;tow, only on condition of believing, yea, repenting and believing: though it is <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> that enableth al&s;o to perform the condition.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> What this Re&s;t containeth.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THERE is contained in this Re&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. A ce&s;&s;ation from motion or action. Not from all action, but of that which implies the ab&s;ence of the end. When we have obtained the haven, we have done &s;ailing: when we are at our journey's end, we have done with the way. Therefore prophe&s;ying cea&s;eth, tongues fail, and knowledge &s;hall be done away; that is, &s;o far as it was imperfect. There &s;hall be no more prayer, becau&s;e no more nece&s;&s;ity, but the full enjoyment of what we prayed for. Neither &s;hall we need to fa&s;t, and weep and watch any more, be|ing out of the reach of &s;in and temptations. Nor will there be u&s;e for in&s;tructions and exhortations: preach|ing is done: the mini&s;try of man cea&s;eth: &s;acraments u&s;ele&s;s: the labourers called in, becau&s;e the harve&s;t is gathered: the unregenerate pa&s;t hope, the &s;aints pa&s;t fear, for-ever. Much le&s;s &s;hall there be any need of labouring for inferior ends, as here we do; &s;eeing they &s;hall all devolve them&s;elves into the ocean of the ultimate end, and the le&s;&s;er good be &s;wallowed up in the greate&s;t.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="18" REF="022331_0017_0FB7F4B40E014FD8">
2. This re&s;t containeth a perfect freedom from all the evils that accompany us through our cour&s;e, and which nece&s;&s;arily follow our ab&s;ence from the chief good: be&s;ides our freedom from tho&s;e eternal flames, which the neglecters of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> mu&s;t endure. There is no &s;uch a thing as grief and &s;orrow known there: nor is there &s;uch a thing as a pale face, a languid bo|dy, feeble joints, unable infancy, decripid age, pec|cant humours, painful &s;ickne&s;s, griping fears, con|&s;uming care, nor what&s;oever de&s;erves the name of evil. Indeed a gale of groans and &s;ighs, a &s;tream of tears, accompanied us to the very gates, and there bid us farewell for-ever. <HI>We did weep and lament, when the world did rejoice; but our &s;orrow is turned into joy, and our joy &s;hall no man take from us.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. This re&s;t containeth the highe&s;t degree of per|fection, both of &s;oul and body. This qualifies them to enjoy the glory, and thoroughly to partake the &s;weetne&s;s of it. Were the glory never &s;o great, and them&s;elves not made capable of it, it would be little to them. But the more perfect the appetite, the &s;weet|er the food. The more mu&s;ical the ear, the more plea&s;ant the melody. The more perfect the &s;oul, the more joyous tho&s;e joys, and the more glorious is that glory. Nor is it only &s;inful imperfection that is re|moved, nor only that which is the fruit of &s;in, but that which adhered to us in our pure nature. There is far more procured by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> than was lo&s;t by <HI>Adam.</HI> It is the mi&s;ery of wicked men here, that all without them is mercy, but within them an heart full of &s;in, &s;huts the door again&s;t all, and makes them but the more mi&s;erable. When all is well within, then all is well indeed. Therefore will GOD, as a &s;pecial part of his &s;aints happine&s;s, perfect them&s;elves as well as their condition.</P>

4. This re&s;t containeth, as the principal part, our neare&s;t fruition of GOD. As all good what&s;oever is compri&s;ed in GOD, and all in the creature are but drops of this ocean; &s;o all the glory of the ble&s;&s;ed is compri&s;ed in their enjoyment of GOD: and if there be any mediate joys there, they are but drops from this. If men and angels &s;hould &s;tudy to &s;peak the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the e&s;tate, in one word, what can they &s;ay beyond this, That it is the neare&s;t enjoyment of GOD? Say, They have GOD; and you &s;ay, they have all that is worth the having. O the full joys offered to a believer in that one &s;entence of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s! I would not for all the world that ver&s;e had been left out of the bible; <HI>Father, I will, that tho&s;e whom thou ha&s;t given Me, be with Me where I am, that they may be|hold my glory, which thou ha&s;t given me,</HI> John xvii. 24. Every word is full of life and joy.

<P N="5">5. This re&s;t containeth a &s;weet and con&s;tant action of all the powers of the &s;oul and body in this fruition of GOD. But great will the change of our bodies and &s;en&s;es be; even &s;o great, as now we cannot conceive.

We may then &s;ay much more, This is not the body I had, and the&s;e are not the &s;en&s;es I had. Yet becau&s;e we have no other name for them, let us call them &s;en&s;es; call them eyes and ears, &s;eeing and hearing: but conceive, that as
<PB N="20" REF="022331_0019_0FB7F4C018EAFF70">much as a body &s;piritual, above the &s;un in glory, ex|ceedeth the&s;e frail, noi&s;ome, di&s;ea&s;ed lumps of fle&s;h, that we now carry about us; &s;o far &s;hall our &s;en&s;es of &s;eeing and hearing exceed the&s;e we now po&s;&s;e&s;s: for the change of the &s;en&s;es mu&s;t be conceived proportion|able to the change of the body. And doubtle&s;s as GOD advanceth our &s;en&s;e, and enlargeth our capacity; &s;o will He advance the happine&s;s of tho&s;e &s;en&s;es, and fill up with him&s;elf all that capacity. And certainly the body &s;hould not be rai&s;ed up, if it &s;hould not &s;hare in the glory: for as it hath &s;hared in the obe|dience and &s;ufferings, &s;o &s;hall it al&s;o do in the ble&s;|&s;edne&s;s: and as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> bought the whole man, &s;o &s;hall the whole partake of the everla&s;ting benefits of the purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>And if the body &s;hall be thus employed, O how &s;hall the &s;oul be taken up! As its powers and capa|cities are greate&s;t, &s;o its actions are &s;tronge&s;t, and its enjoyments &s;weete&s;t. As the bodily &s;en&s;es have their proper aptitude and action, whereby they receive and enjoy their objects; &s;o doth the &s;oul in its own acti|on, enjoy its own object: by knowing, by thinking, and remembering, by loving, and by delightful joy|ing: by the&s;e eyes it &s;ees, and by the&s;e arms it em|braceth. If it might be &s;aid of the di&s;ciples with <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> on earth, much more that behold him in his glory, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the eyes that &s;ee the things that you &s;ee, and the ears that hear the things that you hear: for many princes and great ones have d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ired (and hoped) to &s;ee the things that you &s;ee, and have not &s;een them, &amp;c.</HI> Matt. xiii. 16, 17.</P>

And that my dull, ob&s;cure notions of them, were but quick and clear? O what then would I not perform, or part with, to enjoy a clear and true apprehen&s;ion of the mo&s;t true GOD! How noble a faculty of the &s;oul is the under|&s;tanding! It can compa&s;s the earth; it can mea&s;ure the &s;un, moon, &s;tars, and heaven; it can foreknow each eclip&s;e to a minute, many years before: yea, but this is the top of all its excellency, it can know GOD, who is infinite, who made all the&s;e; a little here, and much more hereafter. O the wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s of our ble&s;&s;ed LORD! he hath created the under|&s;tanding with a natural bias to truth, and its object; and to the prime truth as its prime object: and le&s;t we &s;hould turn a&s;ide to any creature, he hath kept this as his own divine prerogative, not communicable to any creature, <HI>viz.</HI> to be the prime truth.</P>
<P>Did&s;t thou never look &s;o long upon the Son of God, till thine eyes were dazzled with his a&s;toni&s;hing glo|ry? and did not the &s;plendor of it make all things below &s;eem black and dark to thee, when thou look|ed&s;t down again, e&s;pecially in thy day of &s;uffering for <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> (when he u&s;ually appears mo&s;t manife&s;tly to his people?) did&s;t thou never &s;ee <HI>one wol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing in the mid&s;t of the fiery furnace with thee, like the Son of God?</HI> If thou know him, value him as thy life, and follow on to know him; and thou &s;halt know incomparably more than this.

<P>And if this were all, what a high favour, that GOD will give us leave to love him! that he will vouch&s;afe to be embraced by &s;uch arms that have embraced &s;in before him! But this is not all, he returneth love for love; nay, a thou&s;and times more, as perfect as we &s;hall be, we cannot reach his mea&s;ure of love: chri&s;|tian thou wilt then be brimful of love; yet love as much as thou can&s;t, thou &s;halt be ten thou&s;and times more beloved.

<P>And it &s;eems the &s;aints joy &s;hall be greater than the damned's torment: for their torment is the torment of creatures <HI>prepared for the devil and his angels:</HI> but our joy is <HI>the joy of our</HI> LORD, even our LORD'S own joy &s;hall we enter. <HI>And the &s;ame glory which the Fa|ther giveth him, doth the Son give them,</HI> John xvii. 22. <HI>And to &s;it down with him in his throne, even as he is &s;et down in his Father's throne,</HI> Rev. iii. 21.

<P>And in the meantime walk carefully, watch con|&s;tantly, and then let GOD mea&s;ure out thy times and degrees of joy. It may be he keeps them till thou ha&s;t more need: thou may&s;t better lo&s;e thy comfort, than thy &s;afety: as the joy of the hypocrite, &s;o the fears of the upright, are but for a moment. <HI>Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.</HI> O ble&s;&s;ed morning!

<P>And it is not thy joy only: it is a mutual joy, as well as mutual love: is there &s;uch joy in heaven at thy conver&s;ion, and will there be none at thy glorifi|cation?

This is indeed a happy meeting; but nothing to the joy of that la&s;t and great meeting.</P>
<P>And now look back upon all this: I &s;ay to thee as the angel to <HI>John, What ha&s;t thou &s;een?</HI> Or if vet thou perceive not, draw nearer, come up higher, <HI>Come and &s;ee:</HI> do&s;t thou fear thou ha&s;t been all this while in a dream?

<P>But pardon, O LORD, thy &s;ervant's &s;in: I have not pried into unrevealed things, nor curiou&s;ly &s;earch|ed into thy coun&s;els; but indeed I have di&s;honoured thy holine&s;s, wronged thine excellency, di&s;graced thy &s;aints glory, by my di&s;proportionable pourtraying: I will bewail from my heart that my apprehen&s;ions are &s;o dull, my thoughts &s;o mean, my affections &s;o &s;tupid, and my expre&s;&s;ions &s;o low.

<P N="1">1. And well may the coming of CHRIST be reck|oned with tho&s;e ingredients that compound this pre|cious re&s;t: for to this end it is intended; and to this end it is of apparent nece&s;&s;ity. For his people's &s;ake he &s;anctified him&s;elf to his office: for their &s;ake he came into the world, &s;uffered, died, ro&s;e, a&s;cended: and for their &s;ake it is that he will return. To this end will CHRIST come again to receive his people to him&s;elf, <HI>That where he is, they may be al&s;o.</HI> John xiv. 3. He that would come to &s;uffer, will &s;urely come to triumph: and he that would come to purcha&s;e, will &s;urely come to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>But why &s;tayed he not with his people while he was here? Why? mu&s;t not the Comforter be &s;ent? Was not the work on earth done? Mu&s;t he not re|ceive the recompen&s;e of reward, and enter into his glory? Mu&s;t he not take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in our behalf? Mu&s;t he not go to prepare a place for us? Mu&s;t he not intercede with the Father, and plead his &s;ufferings, and be filled with the &s;pirit to &s;end it forth, and re|ceive authority to &s;ubdue his enemies? Our abode here is &s;hort: if he had &s;tayed on earth, what would it have been to enjoy him for a few days, and then die? But he hath more in heaven to dwell among; even the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t of many generations, there made perfect. O what a day will that be! when we who have been kept pri&s;oners by the grave, &s;hall be fetched out by the LORD him&s;elf; when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hall come from heaven to plead with his enemies, and &s;et his captives free? It will not be &s;uch a coming as his fir&s;t was, in meanne&s;s, and poverty, and contempt: he will not come to be &s;pit upon, and buffeted, and &s;corned, and crucified again: he will not come, O carele&s;s world! to be &s;lighted by you any more. And yet that coming which was in infirmity and reproach
<PB N="33" REF="022331_0032_0FB7F4F1E17D1AD8">for our &s;akes, wanted not its glory. If the angels of heaven mu&s;t be the me&s;&s;engers of that coming, as be|ing <HI>Tidings of joy to all people:</HI> and the heavenly ho&s;t mu&s;t accompany his nativity, and mu&s;t prai&s;e GOD with that &s;olemnity: O with what &s;houtings will an|gels and &s;aints at that day proclaim, <HI>Glory to</HI> GOD, <HI>and peace and good-will towards men!</HI> If the &s;tars of heaven mu&s;t lead men to come to wor&s;hip a child in a manger, how will the glory of his next appearing con&s;train all the world to acknowledge his &s;overeign|ty! If when he was in the form of a &s;ervant, they cry out, <HI>What manner of man is this, that both wind and &s;ea obey him!</HI> What &s;hall they &s;ay when they &s;hall &s;ee him coming in his glory, and the heavens and earth obey him? <HI>Then &s;hall appear the &s;ign of the Son of man in heaven, and then &s;hall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they &s;hall &s;ee the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great-glory.</HI></P>
<P>This coming of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is frequently mentioned in the prophets, as the great &s;upport of his people's &s;pirits till then. And whenever the apo&s;tles would quicken to duty, or encourage to patient waiting, they u&s;ual|ly do it by mentioning <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s coming. Why then do we not u&s;e more this cordial con&s;ideration, when|ever we want &s;upport and comfort? Shall the wicked with inconceivable horror behold him, and cry out, Yonder is he who&s;e blood we neglected, who&s;e grace we re&s;i&s;ted, who&s;e coun&s;els we refu&s;ed, who&s;e go|vernment we ca&s;t off! And &s;hall not the &s;aints, with inconceivable gladne&s;s, cry out, Yonder is he who&s;e blood redeemed us, who&s;e &s;pirit clean&s;ed us! Yonder comes he in whom we tru&s;ted, and now we &s;ee he hath not deceived our tru&s;t: he for whom we long waited, and now we &s;ee we have not waited in vain! O how &s;hould it then be the character of a chri&s;tian, <HI>To wait for the Son of</HI> GOD <HI>from heaven, whom he rai&s;ed from the dead, even</HI> JESUS <HI>which delivered us from the

And &s;eeing his coming is of purpo&s;e <HI>to be glorified in his &s;aints, and admired in all them that believe;</HI> what thought &s;hould glad our hearts more than the thought of that day?

And while we daily gaze and look up to hea|ven after him, let us remember what the angel &s;aid, <HI>This &s;ome</HI> JESUS <HI>which is taken up from you into heaven, &s;hall &s;o come in like manner, as ye have &s;een him go into heaven.</HI> Let every chri&s;tian that heareth and readeth, &s;ay, <HI>Come;</HI> and our LORD him&s;elf &s;aith, <HI>Surely I come quickly, amen, even &s;o come</HI> LORD JESUS.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;tream that leadeth to paradi&s;e, is that great work of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> in rai&s;ing our bodies from the du&s;t, uniting them again unto the &s;oul.

<P>Come then, fellow-chri&s;tians, let us commit the&s;e carca&s;es to the du&s;t: that pri&s;on &s;hall not long contain them. Let us lie down in peace and take our re&s;t: it will not be an everla&s;ting night, or endle&s;s &s;leep.

The time was, &s;inner, when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> would, and you would not; and now, fain would you, and he will not.

<ITEM>1. Let not the names of men draw thee one way or other, nor make thee partial in &s;earching for the truth: di&s;like the men for their un&s;ound doctrine; but call not doctrine un&s;ound, becau&s;e it is theirs: nor &s;ound becau&s;e of the repute of the writer.</ITEM>

Our giving to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> more of the work than &s;cripture doth, or rather our a&s;cribing it to him out of the &s;cripture-way, doth but di&s;honour, and not honour him; and depre&s;s, but not exalt his free grace: while we deny the inward &s;anctifying work of his &s;pirit, and extol his free ju&s;tification, which are equal fruits of his merit, we make him an imperfect Sa|viour.</ITEM>

<P>Yet under&s;tand this rightly: not that this highe&s;t glory was in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e purcha&s;ed, &s;o as that it was the mo&s;t immediate effect of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s death; we mu&s;t take heed that we conceive not of GOD as a ty|rant, who &s;o delighteth in cruelty, as to exchange mercies for &s;tripes. GOD was never &s;o plea&s;ed with the &s;ufferings of the innocent, much le&s;s of his Son, us to &s;ell his mercy properly for their &s;ufferings. But the &s;ufferings of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> were primarily and immediate|ly to &s;atisfy ju&s;tice, and to bear what was due to the &s;inner, and &s;o to re&s;tore him to the life he lo&s;t, and the happine&s;s he &s;ell from: but this dignity, which &s;urpa&s;&s;eth the fir&s;t, is as it were, from the redundancy of his merit, or a &s;econdary fruit of his death. The work of his redemption &s;o well plea&s;ed the Father, that he gave him power to advance his cho&s;en to a higher dignity than they fell from; and to give them
<PB N="47" REF="022331_0046_0FB7F525D5A7A7C8">the glory which was given to him&s;elf; and all this according to the good plea&s;ure of his own will.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;econd <HI>pearl in the &s;aint's diadem,</HI> is, that it is free. This &s;eemeth as <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s <HI>&s;econd kine, to de|vour the former.</HI> But the &s;eeming di&s;cord, is but a plea&s;ing diver&s;ity which con&s;titutes the melody. The&s;e two attributes purcha&s;ed and free, are the two chains of gold, which make up the wreath for the heads of the pillars in the temple of GOD. It was dear to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> but free to us. When <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was to buy, &s;il|ver and gold were nothing worth; prayers and tears could not &s;uffice; nor any thing below his blood; but when we come to buy, our buying is but receiv|ing: we have it freely, <HI>without money and without price.</HI> Nor do the go&s;pel-conditions make it the le&s;s free; if the go&s;pel-conditions had been &s;uch as are the laws, or payment of the debt required at our hands; the freene&s;s then were more que&s;tionable. Yea, if GOD had &s;aid to us, <HI>Sinners, if you will &s;atisfy my ju&s;tice for one of your &s;ins, I will forgive you all the re&s;t,</HI> it would have been a hard condition on our part, and the grace of the covenant not &s;o free, as our di&s;|ability doth require. But if all the condition be our cordial acceptation, &s;urely we de&s;erve not the name of purcha&s;ers. Thankful accepting of a free acquit|tance, is no paying of the debt. If life be offered to a condemned man, upon condition that he &s;hall not refu&s;e the offer, the favour is neverthele&s;s free. Nay, though the condition were, that he &s;hould beg, and wait before he have his pardon, and take him for his LORD who hath thus redeemed him, this is no &s;atis|fying the ju&s;tice of the law: e&s;pecially when the con|dition is al&s;o given by GOD; &s;urely then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e is all free: if the Father freely give the Son, and the Son freely pay the debt; and if GOD freely accept that way of payment, when he might have required it of the principal; and if both Father and Son freely offer
<PB N="48" REF="022331_0047_0FB7F528485D3470">us the purcha&s;ed life upon tho&s;e fair conditions; and if they al&s;o freely &s;end the &s;pirit to enable us to perform tho&s;e conditions, then what is here, that is not free? O the everla&s;ting admiration that mu&s;t needs &s;urpri&s;e the &s;aints to think of this freene&s;s! What did the LORD &s;ee in me, that he &s;hould judge me meet for &s;uch a &s;tate? that I who was but a poor, de&s;pi&s;ed wretch, &s;hould be clad in the brightne&s;s of this glory? that I, a &s;illy, creeping worm, &s;hould be advanced to this high dignity? He that dur&s;t not lift up his eyes to heaven, but &s;tood afar off &s;miting his brea&s;t, and crying, LORD, <HI>be merciful to me a &s;inner!</HI> now to be lifted up to heaven him&s;elf! He who was wont to write his name in <HI>Bradford</HI>'s &s;tyle, <HI>the unthankful, the hard-hearted, the unworthy &s;inner!</HI> and was wont to admire that patience could bear &s;o long, and ju&s;tice &s;uffer him to live: &s;ure he will admire at this altera|tion, when he &s;hall find by experience, that unworthi|ne&s;s could not hinder his &s;alvation, which he thought would have bereaved him of every mercy. Ah! chri&s;tian, there is no talk of our worthine&s;s or un|worthine&s;s. If worthine&s;s were our condition for ad|mittance, we might &s;it down with St. <HI>John,</HI> and weep, <HI>Becau&s;e none in heaven or on earth is found worthy. But the lion of the tribe of</HI> Judah <HI>is worthy, and hath pre|vailed; and by that title mu&s;t we hold the inheritance.</HI> We &s;hall offer there the offering that <HI>David</HI> refu&s;ed, <HI>even prai&s;e for that which co&s;t us nothing.</HI> Here our commi&s;&s;ion runs, <HI>freely ye have received, freely give.</HI> But <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath dearly received, yet freely gives. Yet this is not all. If it were only for nothing, and with|out our merit, the wonder were great: but it is more|over again&s;t our merit, and again&s;t our long endea|vouring our own ruin.

What an a&s;toni&s;hing thought it will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to think of the unmea&s;urable difference between our de&s;ervings, and our receivings! between the &s;tate we
<PB N="49" REF="022331_0048_0FB7F52987927DE8">&s;hould have been in, and the &s;tate we are in! to look down upon hell, and &s;ee the va&s;t difference that free grace hath made betwixt us and them! to &s;ee the in|heritance there, which we were born to, &s;o different from that which we are adopted to! Oh! what pangs of love will it cau&s;e within us, to think, yonder was the place that &s;in would have brought me to; but this is it that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath brought me to! Yonder death was the wages of my &s;in; but this <HI>eternal life is the gift of</HI> GOD, <HI>through</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>my</HI> LORD. Doubtle&s;s this will be our everla&s;ting admiration, that &s;o rich a crown &s;hould &s;it the head of &s;o vile a &s;inner! that &s;uch high advancement, and &s;uch long unfruitfulne&s;s and unkindne&s;s can be the &s;tate of the &s;ame per&s;ons! and that &s;uch vile rebellions can con|clude in &s;uch mo&s;t precious joys! But no thanks to us; nor to any of our duties and labours, much le&s;s to our neglects and lazine&s;s; we know to whom the prai&s;e is due, and mu&s;t be given for-ever. And in|deed to this very end it was, that infinite wi&s;dom did ca&s;t the whole de&s;ign of man's &s;alvation into the mould of PURCHASE and FREENESS, that the love and joy of man might be perfected, and the ho|nour of grace mo&s;t highly advanced: that the thought of merit might neither cloud the one, nor ob&s;truct the other; and that on the&s;e two hinges the gates of hea|ven might turn. So then let [DESERVED] be written on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hell, but on the door of hea|ven and life, [THE FREE GIFT.]</P>
<P>A third comfortable adjunct of this re&s;t is, that it is the fellow&s;hip of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;aints and angels of GOD. Not &s;o &s;ingular will the chri&s;tian be, as to be &s;olitary. Though it be proper to the &s;aints only, yet is it common to all the &s;aints. For what is it, but an a&s;&s;ociation of ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirits in GOD? A corpora|tion of perfected &s;aints, whereof <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is the head? The communion of &s;aints completed? For tho&s;e that
<PB N="50" REF="022331_0049_0FB7F52C5E6E7378">have prayed and fa&s;ted, and wept, and watched, and waited together; now to enjoy, and prai&s;e together, methinks &s;hould much advance their plea&s;ure. He who mentioneth the qualifications of our happine&s;s, of purpo&s;e that our joy may be full, and maketh &s;o oft mention of our conjunction in his prai&s;es, &s;ure doth hereby intimate to us, that this will be &s;ome ad|vantage to our joys. Certain I am of this, fellow-chri&s;tians, that as we have been together in labour, duty, danger and di&s;tre&s;s, &s;o &s;hall we be in the great recompen&s;e; and as we have been &s;corned and de&s;pi&s;ed, &s;o &s;hall we be crowned and honoured together; and we who have gone through the day of &s;adne&s;s, &s;hall enjoy together that day of gladne&s;s. And tho&s;e who have been with us in per&s;ecution and pri&s;on, &s;hall be with us al&s;o in that place of con&s;olation. When I look in the faces of the people of GOD, and believ|ingly think of this day, what a refre&s;hing thought is it? Shall we not there remember our fellow&s;hip in duty, and in &s;ufferings? How oft our groans made as it were one &s;ound, our tears but one &s;tream, and our de&s;ires but one prayer? And now all our prai&s;es &s;hall make up one melody; and all our churches one church; and all our&s;elves but one body: for we &s;hall be one in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> even as he and the Father are one. It is true, we mu&s;t be very careful that we look not for that in the &s;aints, which is alone in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and that we give them not his prerogative; nor expect too great a part of our comfort in the fruition of them: we are prone enough to this kind of idolatry. But yet he who commands us &s;o to love them now, will give us leave in the &s;ame &s;ubordination to him&s;elf to love them then, when him&s;elf hath made them much more lovely. And if we may love them, we &s;hall &s;urely rejoice in them; for love cannot &s;tand without an an&s;werable joy. If the forethought of &s;itting down with <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac, Jacob,</HI> and all the prophets in the kingdom of GOD, may be our lawful joy; then
<PB N="51" REF="022331_0050_0FB7F5325CD90E38">how much more that real &s;ight, and actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion? It cannot choo&s;e but be comfortable to me to think of that day, when I &s;hall join with <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in his &s;ong, with <HI>David</HI> in his p&s;alms of prai&s;e, and with all the redeemed in the <HI>&s;ong of the Lamb for-ever.</HI> When we &s;hall &s;ee <HI>Enoch</HI> walking with GOD; <HI>Noah</HI> enjoying the end of his &s;ingularity; <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> of his integrity; <HI>Job</HI> of his patience; <HI>Hezekiah</HI> of his uprightne&s;s: and all the &s;aints the end of their faith. O happy day, when I &s;hall depart out of this crowd and &s;ink, and go to that &s;ame council of &s;ouls! I know that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is All in All, and that it is the pre&s;ence of GOD that maketh heaven to be heaven. But yet it much &s;weet|eneth the thoughts of that place to me, to remember that there are &s;uch a multitude of my mo&s;t dear and precious friends in <HI>Chri&s;t: with whom I took &s;weet coun&s;el, and with whom I went up to the hou&s;e of</HI> GOD, <HI>who walked with me in the fear of</HI> GOD, <HI>and integrity of their hearts:</HI> In the face of who&s;e conver&s;ation there was written the name of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> who&s;e &s;en&s;ible mention of his excellencies hath made my heart to burn within me. To think &s;uch a friend that died at &s;uch a time, and &s;uch a one at another time, and that all the&s;e are entered into re&s;t; and we &s;hall &s;ure|ly go to them. It is a que&s;tion with &s;ome, Whether we &s;hall know each other in heaven or no? Surely, there &s;hall no knowledge cea&s;e which now we have; but only that which implieth our imperfection. And what imperfection can this imply? Nay our pre&s;ent knowledge &s;hall be increa&s;ed beyond belief: it &s;hall in|deed be done away, but as the light of the &s;tars is done away by the ri&s;ing of the &s;un; which is more proper|ly doing away of our ignorance than our knowledge; indeed we &s;hall not know each other after the fle&s;h; but by the image of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and &s;piritual relation, and former faithfulne&s;s in improving our talents, be|yond doubt, we &s;hall know and be known. Nor is it only our old acquaintance, but all the &s;aints of all
<PB N="52" REF="022331_0051_0FB7F53409AEA340">ages, who&s;e faces in the fle&s;h, we never &s;aw, whom we &s;hall there both know and comfortably enjoy. Yea, and angels as well as &s;aints will be our ble&s;&s;ed acquaintance. The&s;e who now are willingly mini|&s;terial &s;pirits for our good, will willingly then be our companions in joy for the perfecting of our good: and they who had &s;uch joy in heaven for our conver&s;ion, will gladly rejoice with us in our glorification. I think, chri&s;tian, this will be a more honourable a&s;&s;em|bly than ever you have beheld; and a more happy &s;ociety than you were ever of before. Then we &s;hall truly &s;ay as <HI>David, I am a companion of all them that fear thee: when we are come to mount</HI> Sion, <HI>and to the city of the living</HI> GOD, <HI>the heavenly</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>and to an innumerable company of angels; to the general a&s;&s;em|bly, and church of the fir&s;t-born, which are written in heaven, and to</HI> GOD <HI>the judge of all, and to the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect, and to</HI> Je&s;us <HI>the mediator of the new covenant.</HI> So then I conclude: This is one &s;ingular excellency of the re&s;t of heaven, <HI>That we are fellow-citizens with the &s;aints, and of the hou&s;ehold of</HI> GOD.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another excellent property of our re&s;t will be, that the joys of it are immediately from GOD. <HI>We &s;hall &s;ee</HI> GOD <HI>face to face:</HI> and &s;tand continually in his pre&s;ence; and con&s;equently derive our life and com|fort immediately from him. Whether GOD will make u&s;e of any creatures for our &s;ervice then; or if any, of what creatures, and what u&s;e; is more than I yet know: but it is certain, that at lea&s;t, our great|e&s;t joys will be immediate, if not all. Now we have nothing at all immediately, but at the &s;econd or third hand, or how many who knows? From the earth, from man, from the &s;un and moon, from the influ|ence of the planets, from the mini&s;tration of angels, and from the &s;pirit of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and doubtle&s;s, the fur|ther the &s;tream runs from the fountain, the more im|pure
<PB N="53" REF="022331_0052_0FB7F535CC44EA38">it is. It gathers &s;ome defilement from every un|clean channel it pa&s;&s;eth through. Though it &s;avours not in the hand of angels, of the imperfection of &s;in|ners, yet it doth of the imperfection of creatures; and as it comes from man, it &s;avours of both. How quick and piercing is the word it it&s;elf? Yet many times it never enters, being managed by a feeble arm. O what weight and worth is there in every pa&s;&s;age of the ble&s;&s;ed go&s;pel! enough, one would think, to en|ter and force the dulle&s;t &s;oul, and wholly po&s;&s;e&s;s its thoughts and affections: and yet how oft doth it drop as water upon a &s;tone? The things of GOD which we handle, are divine: but our manner of handling is human: and there is little or none that ever we touch, but we leave the print of our fingers behind us; but of GOD &s;hould &s;peak this word him&s;elf, it would be a piercing melting word indeed.</P>
<P>If an angel from heaven &s;hould preach the go&s;pel, yet could he not deliver it according to its glo|ry; much le&s;s we who never &s;aw what they have &s;een, and keep this trea&s;ure in earthen ve&s;&s;els. The comforts that flow through &s;ermons, &s;acraments, read|ing, conference, and creatures, are but half comforts; in compari&s;on of tho&s;e which the Almighty &s;hall &s;peak with his own mouth, and reach forth with his own hand. The chri&s;tian knows by experience now, that his mo&s;t immediate joys are his &s;weete&s;t joys; which have lea&s;t of man, and are mo&s;t directly from the &s;pi|rit. That is one rea&s;on, I conceive, why chri&s;tians who are much in &s;ecret prayer and meditation, are men of greate&s;t life; becau&s;e they are nearer the well-head, and have all more immediately from GOD him|&s;elf. And that I conceive the only rea&s;on, why we are more indi&s;po&s;ed to tho&s;e &s;ecret duties, and can ea&s;ier bring our hearts to hear and read, than to &s;e|cret prayer, &s;elf-examination and meditation; becau&s;e in the former is more of man, and in the&s;e we ap|proach
<PB N="54" REF="022331_0053_0FB7F53A0E8C9048">the LORD alone, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d our natures draw back from the mo&s;t &s;piritual duties. Not that we &s;hould therefore ca&s;t off the other, and neglect any ordinance of GOD: to live above them while we u&s;e them, is the way of a chri&s;tian. But to live above ordinances, as to live without them, is to live without the go|vernment of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> It is then we &s;hall have light without a candle; and a perpetual day without the &s;un: <HI>For the city hath no need of the &s;un, neither of the moon to &s;hine in it: for the glory of</HI> GOD <HI>doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof,</HI> Rev. xxi. 23. Nay, <HI>There &s;hall be no night there, and they need no candle, nor light of the &s;un, for the</HI> LORD GOD <HI>giveth them light, and they &s;hall reign for-ever and ever.</HI> We &s;hall then have re&s;t without &s;leep, and be kept from cold without our cloathing, and need no fig-leaves to hide our &s;hame: for GOD will be our re&s;t, and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> our cloathing, and &s;hame and &s;in will cea&s;e together. We &s;hall then have health without phy&s;ic, and &s;trength without the u&s;e of food; for the LORD GOD will be our &s;trength, and the light of his countenance will be health to our &s;ouls, and marrow to our bones. We &s;hall then (and never till then) have enlightened under|&s;tandings without &s;cripture, and be governed with|out a written law. For the LORD will perfect his law in our hearts, and we &s;hall be all perfectly taught of GOD; his own will &s;hall be our law, and his own face &s;hall be our light for-ever. We &s;hall then have communion without &s;acraments, when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hall drink with us of the fruit of the vine new, that is, re|fre&s;h us with the comforting wine of immediate fru|ition in the kingdom of his Father.</P>
<P N="5">5. A further excellency of this re&s;t is this; it will be a &s;uitable re&s;t: &s;uited,

1. To our natures. If &s;uitablene&s;s concur not with excelleney, the be&s;t things may be bad to us: for it is not that which makes things good in them&s;elves, to be good to us. In our choice of friends, we oft pa&s;s by the more excellent, to choo&s;e the more &s;uita|ble; every good agrees not with every nature. The choice&s;t dainties which we feed upon our&s;elves, would be to our bea&s;ts, as an unplea&s;ing, &s;o an in&s;ufficient &s;u&s;tenance.</P>
<P>Now here is &s;uitablene&s;s and excellency conjoined. The new nature of the &s;aints doth &s;uit their &s;pirits to this re&s;t: and indeed their holine&s;s is nothing el&s;e but a &s;park taken from this element, and by the &s;pirit of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> kindled in their hearts, the flame whereof, as mindful of its divine original, doth ever mount aloft, and tend to the place from whence it comes. Gold and earthly glory, temporal crowns and kingdoms, could not make a re&s;t for &s;aints. As they were not redeem|ed with &s;o low a price, &s;o neither are they endued with &s;o low a nature. As GOD will have from them a &s;piritual wor&s;hip, &s;uitable to his own &s;piritual be|ing; &s;o will he provide them a &s;piritual re&s;t, &s;uitable to his people's &s;piritual nature.</P>
<P>A heaven of the knowledge of GOD, and his <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and a delightful complacency in that mutual love, and everla&s;ting rejoicing in the fruition of our GOD, a perpetual &s;inging of his high prai&s;es: this is a heaven for a &s;aint: a &s;piritual re&s;t, &s;uitable to a &s;piritual na|ture. Then we &s;hall live in our element. We are now as the fi&s;h in &s;ome &s;mall ve&s;&s;el of water, that hath only &s;o much as will keep him alive: but what is that to the full ocean? We have a little air let into us to afford us breathing: but what is that to the &s;weet and fre&s;h gales upon mount <HI>Sion?</HI> We have a beam of the &s;un to lighten our darkne&s;s, and a warm
<PB N="56" REF="022331_0055_0FB7F53DC8F51358">ray to keep us from freezing: but then we &s;hall live in its light, and be revived by its heat for-ever.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is &s;uitable to the de&s;ires of the &s;aints: for &s;uch as is their nature, &s;uch are their de&s;ires; and &s;uch as their de&s;ires, &s;uch will be their re&s;t. Indeed we have now a mixed nature; and from contrary prin|ciples, ari&s;e contrary de&s;ires. But it is the de&s;ires of our renewed nature, which this re&s;t is &s;uited to. Whil&s;t our de&s;ires remain corrupt and mi&s;guided, it is a far greater mercy to deny, yea, to de&s;troy them, than to &s;atisfy them: but tho&s;e which are &s;piritual, are of his own planting, and he will &s;urely water them, and give the increa&s;e. He quickened our hun|ger and thir&s;t for righteou&s;ne&s;s, that he might make us happy in a full &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tian, this is a re&s;t after thy own heart; it con|taineth all that thy heart can wi&s;h, that which thou longe&s;t for, praye&s;t for, laboure&s;t for, there thou &s;halt find it all. Thou had&s;t rather have GOD in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> than all the world; why there thou &s;halt have him. De&s;ire what thou can&s;t, and a&s;k what thou wilt, as a chri&s;tian, and it &s;hall be given thee; not only to half of the kingdom, but to the enjoyment of both king|dom and king. This is a life of de&s;ire and prayer; but that is a life of &s;atisfaction and enjoyment.</P>
<P N="3">3. This re&s;t is &s;uitable to the &s;aints nece&s;&s;ities al&s;o, as well as to their natures and de&s;ires. It contains what&s;oever they truly wanted; not &s;upplying them with gro&s;s created comforts, which, like <HI>Saul</HI>'s ar|mour on <HI>David,</HI> are more burden than benefit: but they &s;hall there have the benefit without the burden; and the pure &s;pirits extracted (as it were) &s;hall make up their cordial, without the mixture of any dro&s;&s;y or earthly &s;ub&s;tance. It was <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and perfect holi|ne&s;s, which they mo&s;t needed, and with the&s;e &s;hall they be &s;upplied.</P>

If revelation &s;hould rai&s;e us up to the third heaven, the me&s;&s;enger of Satan mu&s;t pre&s;ently buffet us: but there is none of this incon&s;tancy in heaven. It perfect love ca&s;t out fear; then perfect joy mu&s;t needs ca&s;t out &s;or|row, and perfect happine&s;s exclude all the relicks of mi&s;ery. There will be an univer&s;al perfecting of all our parts and powers, and an univer&s;al removal of all our evils. And though the po&s;itive part be the &s;weet|e&s;t, and that which draws the other after it, even as the ri&s;ing of the &s;un excludes the darkne&s;s; yet is not the negative part to be &s;lighted, even our freedom from &s;o many and great calamities. Let us therefore look over the&s;e more punctually, and &s;ee what it is we &s;hall there re&s;t from. In general, it is from all evil.

<PB N="58" REF="022331_0057_0FB7F548A2635840">of hell, will never admit it into the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of heaven. Therefore, chri&s;tian, never fear this: if thou be once in heaven, thou &s;halt &s;in no more. Is not this glad news to thee, who ha&s;t prayed, and watched, and laboured again&s;t it &s;o long? I know, if it were offered to thy choice, thou would&s;t rather choo&s;e to be freed from &s;in, than to be made heir of the world. Thou &s;halt have thy de&s;ire: that hard heart, tho&s;e vile thoughts, which thou could&s;t no more leave behind thee, than leave thy&s;elf behind thee, &s;hall be now left behind for-ever. If they ac|company thee to death, they cannot proceed a &s;tep further. Thy under&s;tanding &s;hall never more be trou|bled with darkne&s;s: ignorance and error are incon|&s;i&s;tent with this light. Now thou walke&s;t like a man in the twilight, ever afraid of being out of the way: but then will all darkne&s;s be di&s;pelled, and our blind under&s;tandings fully opened.</P>
<P>O what would we give to know clearly all the pro|found my&s;teries in the doctrine of redemption, of ju|&s;tification, of the nature of grace, of the divine at|tributes! What would we give to &s;ee all dark &s;crip|tures made plain; to &s;ee all &s;eeming contradictions reconciled! Why, when glory hath taken away the veil from our eyes, all this will be known in a mo|ment; we &s;hall then &s;ee clearly into all the contro|ver&s;ies about doctrine or di&s;cipline that now perplex us. The poore&s;t chri&s;tian is pre&s;ently there a more perfect divine, than any is here. We are now through our ignorance &s;ubject to &s;uch mutability, that in points not fundamental, we change as the moon: but when once our ignorance is perfectly healed, then &s;hall we be &s;ettled, re&s;olved men; then &s;hall our reproach be taken from us, and we &s;hall never change our judgment more. Our ignorance now doth lead us into error, to the grief of our more knowing brethren, to the di&s;turbing the church's quiet, to the &s;canda|lizing
<PB N="59" REF="022331_0058_0FB7F549DA8AA5B0">of others, and weakening our&s;elves. How many a faithful &s;oul is &s;educed into error! Loth they are to err, GOD knows; and therefore read and pray, and yet err &s;till. And in le&s;&s;er and more difficult points, how can it be otherwi&s;e?</P>
<P>Can it be expected, that men void of learning and &s;trength of parts, un&s;tudied and untaught, &s;hould at the fir&s;t on&s;et know tho&s;e truths, which they are al|mo&s;t incapable of knowing at all? When the greate&s;t divines of cleare&s;t judgment acknowledge &s;o much difficulty, that they could almo&s;t find in their hearts, &s;ometimes to profe&s;s them quite beyond their reach. But O that happy approaching day, when error &s;hall vani&s;h away for-ever, when our under&s;tanding &s;hall be filled with GOD him&s;elf, who&s;e light will leave no darkne&s;s in us! His face &s;hall be the &s;cripture, where we &s;hall read the truth: and him&s;elf in&s;tead of teach|ers and coun&s;ellors, to perfect our under&s;tandings, and acquaint us with him&s;elf. No more error, no more &s;candal to others, no more di&s;quiet to our own &s;pirits, no more mi&s;taken zeal for fal&s;ehood. Many a good man hath here in his mi&s;taken zeal, been a means to deceive and pervert his brethren; and when he &s;ees his own error, cannot again tell how to unde|ceive them: but there we &s;hall all con&s;pire in one truth, as being one in him who is the truth.</P>
<P>And as we &s;hall re&s;t from all the &s;in of our under|&s;tandings, &s;o of our wills, affection and conver&s;ation. We &s;hall no more retain this rebelling principle, which is &s;till withdrawing us from GOD.

<P>Brethren, you that now can attempt no work of GOD without re&s;i&s;tance, and find you mu&s;t either lo&s;e the love of the world, and your outward comforts, or el&s;e the love of GOD, and your eternal &s;alvation; con&s;ider you &s;hall in heaven have no di&s;couraging company, nor any but who will further your work, and gladly join heart and voice with you in your everla&s;ting joy and prai&s;es.

So we may &s;ay of multitudes in heaven now all of one mind, one heart, and one employment, you lived not on earth in &s;o &s;weet familiarity.

<P N="5">5. We &s;hall then re&s;t from all which we now un|dergo, by participating with our brethren in their calamities.

<P>HAVING thus performed my fir&s;t ta&s;k of de&s;cri|bing the &s;aints re&s;t: it remains that now I pro|ceed to the &s;econd, and &s;hew you what the&s;e people of GOD are, and why &s;o called; for whom this ble&s;|&s;ed re&s;t remaineth.</P>
<P>Regeneration is the fir&s;t and great qualification of the people of GOD. To be the people of GOD with|out regeneration, is as impo&s;&s;ible as to be the children of men without generation; &s;eeing we are are born
<PB N="72" REF="022331_0071_0FB7F573F5EB2960">GOD'S enemies, we mu&s;t be new-born his &s;ons, or el&s;e remain his enemies &s;till.</P>
<P><HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath &s;poken it with his mouth, <HI>That except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of</HI> GOD. The greate&s;t reformation of life, without this new life wrought in the &s;oul, may procure our fur|ther delu&s;ion, but never our &s;alvation.</P>
<P>But by what acts doth this new life di&s;cover it&s;elf?</P>
<P>The fir&s;t work I call conviction, which compre|hends the knowledge of what the &s;cripture &s;peaks again&s;t &s;in and &s;inners; and that this &s;cripture which &s;peaks &s;o, is the word of GOD him&s;elf. It compre|hends al&s;o, &s;ome knowledge of our&s;elves, and our own guilt, and an acknowledgment of the verity of tho&s;e con&s;equences, which, from the practice of &s;in in us, and threats in &s;cripture, conclude us mi&s;er|able.</P>
<P N="2">2. As there mu&s;t be conviction, &s;o al&s;o &s;en&s;ibility. GOD works on the heart, as well as the head: both were corrupted, and out of order. The principle of new life doth quicken both. All true &s;piritual know|ledge doth pa&s;s into affections. The great things of &s;in, of grace, and <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and eternity, which are of weight, one would think to move a rock; yet &s;hake not the heart of the carnal profe&s;&s;or, nor pierce his &s;oul to the quick: though he &s;hould be a con&s;tant preacher of them to others, yet they little affect him|&s;elf: when he is pre&s;&s;ing them upon the hearts of others, you would little think how in&s;en&s;ible is his own &s;oul: his invention precureth him zealous and moving expre&s;&s;ions, but they cannot procure him an|&s;werable affections.</P>
<P>The things that the &s;oul is thus convinced and &s;en|&s;ible of, are e&s;pecially the&s;e:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="73" REF="022331_0072_0FB7F57D9813AA70" MS="y">
1. The evil of &s;in. The &s;inner is made to know and feel, that the &s;in, which was his delight, is a more loath&s;ome thing than toads or &s;erpents, and a greater evil than plague or famine, or any other calamities: it being a breach of the righteous law of the mo&s;t high GOD, di&s;honourable to him, and de|&s;tructive to the &s;inner.</P>
<P>Now the &s;inner reads and hears the reproofs of &s;in, as words of cour&s;e; but when you mention his &s;in, he feels you &s;peak at his very heart, and yet is contented you &s;hould &s;hew him the wor&s;t: he was wont to marvel, what made men keep &s;uch a &s;tir again&s;t &s;in, what harm it was for a man to take a little plea&s;ure; he &s;aw no &s;uch heinou&s;ne&s;s in it. But now the ca&s;e is altered; GOD hath opened his eyes to &s;ee its inex|pre&s;&s;ible vilene&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;oul in this great work is convinced and &s;en&s;ible, as of the evil of &s;in, &s;o of its own mi&s;ery by rea&s;on of &s;in. They who before read the threats of GOD's law, as men do the &s;tories of foreign wars; now find it is their own &s;tory, and perceive they read their own doom, as if they found their names written in the cur&s;e, or heard the law &s;ay, as <HI>Nathan, thou art the man.</HI> The wrath of GOD &s;eemed to him but as a &s;torm to a man in a dry hou&s;e: but now he finds the di&s;ea&s;e is his own, and feels the pains in his own bowels. In a word, he finds him&s;elf a condemned man, dead and damned in point of law, and that no|thing is wanting but mere execution to make him ab&s;olutely and irrecoverably mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>Whether you will call this a work of the law or go&s;pel, it is a work of the Spirit wrought in &s;ome mea|&s;ure in all the regenerate: And though &s;ome judge it unnece&s;&s;ary bondage, yet it is beyond my conceiving, how he &s;hould come to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for pardon, that fir&s;t
<PB N="74" REF="022331_0073_0FB7F57F0F3B5E48">found not him&s;elf guilty and condemned: <HI>The whole need not the phy&s;ician, but they that are &s;ick.</HI> Yet I de|ny not, but the di&s;covery of the remedy as &s;oon as the mi&s;ery, may prevent a great part of the trouble, and the di&s;tinct effect on the &s;oul, to be with much more difficulty di&s;cerned: nay, the actings of the &s;oul are &s;o quick, and oft &s;o confu&s;ed, that the di&s;tinct order of the&s;e workings may not be apprehended or remem|bered at all: and perhaps the joyful apprehen&s;ions of mercy may make the &s;en&s;e of mi&s;ery the &s;ooner for|gotten.</P>
<P N="3">3. So doth the &s;pirit al&s;o convince the &s;oul, of the creature's vanity and in&s;ufficiency. Every man natu|rally is a flat idolater, our hearts were turned from GOD in our fir&s;t fall; and ever &s;ince the creature hath been our GOD: this is the grand &s;in of nature: when we &s;et up to our&s;elves a wrong end, we mu&s;t needs err in all the means. The creature is to every unre|generate man his GOD: he a&s;cribeth to it the divine prerogatives, and alloweth it the highe&s;t room in his &s;oul, or if ever he come to be convinced of mi&s;ery, he fleeth to it as his Saviour. Indeed GOD and his <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> have u&s;ually the name; but the real expecta|tion is from the creature, and the work of GOD is laid upon it. His plea&s;ure, his profit, and his honour, is the natural man's trinity; and his &s;elf, that is the&s;e in unity: indeed, it is that fle&s;h that is the principal idol; the other three are deified in their relation to our&s;elves. It was our fir&s;t &s;in, to a&s;pire to be as gods; and it is the greate&s;t &s;in that runs in our blood, and is propagated in our nature from generation to generation.</P>
<P>When GOD &s;hould guide us, we guide cur&s;elves; when he &s;hould be our &s;overeign, we rule our&s;elves. The laws which he gives us, we find fault with; and if we had had the making of them, we would have
<PB N="75" REF="022331_0074_0FB7F580907C0438" MS="y">made them otherwi&s;e: when he &s;hould take care of us, (and mu&s;t, or we peri&s;h) we will care for our|&s;elves; when we &s;hould depend on him daily, we had rather keep our &s;tock our&s;elves, and have our portion in our own hands; when we &s;hould &s;tand at his di&s;po|&s;al, we would be at our own; and when we &s;hould &s;ubmit to his Providence, we u&s;ually quarrel at it; as if we knew better what is good for us than he, or how to di&s;po&s;e all things more wi&s;ely. This is the language of a carnal heart, though it doth not always &s;peak out. When we &s;hould &s;tudy GOD, we &s;tudy our&s;elves; when we &s;hould mind GOD, we mind our|&s;elves; when we &s;hould love GOD, we love our&s;elves; when we &s;hould tru&s;t GOD, we tru&s;t our&s;elves; when we &s;hould honour GOD, we honour our&s;elves; when we &s;hould a&s;cribe to GOD and admire him, we a&s;cribe to, and admire our&s;elves: and in&s;tead of GOD, we would have all mens eyes and dependence on us, and all mens thanks returned to us, and would gladly be the only men on earth extolled and admired by all.</P>
<P>And thus we are naturally our own idols: but down falls this <HI>Dagon,</HI> when GOD does once renew the &s;oul: it is the great bu&s;ine&s;s of that great work to bring the heart back to GOD. He convinceth the &s;inner,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the creature can neither be his GOD, to make him;</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Nor yet his <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> to recover him from his mi&s;ery, to re&s;tore him to GOD, who is his happine&s;s.</ITEM>
</LIST>
This GOD doth not only by preaching, but by Pro|vidence a &s;o; becau&s;e words will hardly take off the raging &s;en&s;es, therefore doth GOD make his rod to &s;peak, and continue &s;peaking, till the &s;inner hear, and hath learned this great le&s;&s;on.</P>
<P>This is the great rea&s;on why affliction doth &s;o or|dinarily concur in the work of conver&s;ion; the&s;e real arguments which &s;peak to the quick, will force a hearing when the mo&s;t powerful words are &s;lighted.
<PB N="76" REF="022331_0075_0FB7F58385AB3F88">When a &s;inner made his credit his GOD, and GOD &s;hall ca&s;t him into the lowe&s;t di&s;grace; or bring him that idolized his riches, into a condition wherein they cannot help him, or cau&s;e them to take wings and fly away; what a help is here to this work of conviction? When a man that made his plea&s;ure his GOD, whe|ther ea&s;e, or &s;ports, or mirth, or company, or glut|tony, or drunkenne&s;s, or cloathing, or buildings: or what&s;oever a ranging eye, a curious ear, a raging appetite, or a lu&s;tful heart could de&s;ire, and GOD &s;hall take the&s;e from him, or give him their &s;ting and cur&s;e with them, and turn them all into gall and wormwood, what a help is here to conviction? When GOD &s;hall ca&s;t a man into a langui&s;hing &s;ickne&s;s, and inflict wounds and angui&s;h on his heart, and &s;tir up again&s;t him his own con&s;cience, and then as it were take him by the hand, and lead him to credit, to riches, to plea&s;ure, to company, to &s;ports, or what|&s;oever was deare&s;t to him, and &s;ay, now try if the&s;e can help you; can the&s;e heal thy wounded con&s;cience? Can they now &s;upport thy tottering cottage? Can they keep thy departing &s;oul in thy body? Or &s;ave thee from mine everla&s;ting wrath? Will they prove to thee eternal plea&s;ures? Or redeem thy &s;oul from the eternal flames? Cry aloud to them, and &s;ee now whether the&s;e will be in&s;tead of GOD and his <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> unto thee. O how this works with the &s;inner! when &s;en&s;e it&s;elf acknowledgeth the truth, and even the fle&s;h is convinced of the creature's vanity.</P>
<P N="4">4. The fourth thing that the &s;oul is convinced and &s;en&s;ible of, is the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, the full &s;ufficien|cy, and perfect excellency of JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>This conviction is not by mere argumentation, as a man is convinced of &s;ome unconcerning con&s;equence by di&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te: but al&s;o by the &s;en&s;e of our de&s;perate mi&s;ery, as a man in a famine of the nece&s;&s;ity of food;
<PB N="77" REF="022331_0076_0FB7F58986C31440">or a man that had read, or heard his condemnation, is convinced of the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of a pardon. Now the &s;inner finds him&s;elf in another ca&s;e than ever he was aware of: he feels an in&s;upportable burden upon him, and &s;ees there is none but <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> can take it off: he perceives that he is under the wrath of GOD, and that the law proclaims him a rebel and out-law, and none but <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> can make his peace: he is as a man pur&s;ued by a lion, that mu&s;t peri&s;h if he find not pre&s;ent &s;anctuary: he feels the cur&s;e doth lie upon him, and upon all he hath, for his &s;ake, and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> alone can make him ble&s;&s;ed: he is now brought to this dilemma, either he mu&s;t have <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to ju&s;tify him, or be eternally condemned; he mu&s;t have <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to &s;ave him, or burn in hell for-ever: he mu&s;t have <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to bring him again to GOD, or be &s;hut out of his pre&s;ence everla&s;tingly. And no wonder, if he cry, as the martyr <HI>Lambert, none but</HI> Chri&s;t; <HI>none but</HI> Chri&s;t. It is not gold but bread, that will &s;atisfy the hungry: nor any thing but pardon, that will comfort the con|demned. <HI>All things are now but dro&s;s and dung;</HI> and <HI>what he counted gain, is now but lo&s;s in compari&s;on of</HI> Chri&s;t: for as the &s;inner feeth his utter mi&s;ery, and the di&s;ability of him&s;elf, and all things to relieve him; &s;o he doth perceive, that there is no &s;aving mer|cy out of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> There is none found in heaven or on earth that can open the &s;ealed book &s;ave the Lamb; without his blood there is no remi&s;&s;ion, and without remi&s;&s;ion there is no &s;alvation. Could the &s;inner now make any &s;hift without <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or could any thing el&s;e &s;upply his wants, and &s;ave his &s;oul, then might <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> be di&s;regarded: but now he is convinced, that there is no other name, and the nece&s;&s;ity is ab&s;olute.</P>
<P N="2">2. And as the &s;oul is thus convinced of the nece&s;&s;i|ty of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;o al&s;o of his full &s;ufficiency: he &s;ees, though the creature cannot, and him&s;elf cannot, yet <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> can. Though the fig-leaves of our own un|righteous
<PB N="78" REF="022331_0077_0FB7F5917419E7E8">righteous righteou&s;ne&s;s are too &s;hort to cover our nak|edne&s;s, yet the righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is large enough: ours is di&s;proportionable to the ju&s;tice of the law, but <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s doth extend to every tittle: his &s;ufferings be|ing a perfect &s;atisfaction to the law, and <HI>all power in heaven and earth being given to him,</HI> he is now able to &s;upply every of our wants, and <HI>to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t all that come to him.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;oul is al&s;o here convinced of the perfect excellency of JESUS CHRIST, both as he is con&s;ider|ed in him&s;elf, and as con&s;idered in relation to us; both as he is the only way to the Father, and as he is the end, being one with the Father. Before he knew <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s excellency, as a blind man knows the light of the &s;un; but now, as one that beholdeth his glory.</P>
<P>And thus doth the Spirit convince the &s;oul.</P>
<P N="4">4. After this &s;en&s;ible conviction, the will di&s;cover|eth al&s;o its change; and that in regard of all the fore|mentioned objects.</P>
<P N="1">1. The &s;in which the under&s;tanding pronounceth evil, the will doth turn from with abhorrency. Not that the &s;en&s;itive appetite is changed, or any way made to abhor its object; but when it would carry us to &s;in again&s;t GOD; this di&s;order and evil the will abhorreth.</P>
<P N="2">2. The mi&s;ery al&s;o which &s;in hath procured, as he di&s;cerneth, &s;o he bewaileth. It is impo&s;&s;ible that the &s;oul now living, &s;hould look either on its tre&s;pa&s;s a|gain&s;t GOD, or its own &s;elf procured calamity, with|out &s;ome compunction. He that truly di&s;cerneth, that he hath killed <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and killed him&s;elf, will &s;urely in &s;ome mea&s;ure be pricked to the heart. If
<PB N="79" REF="022331_0078_0FB7F596F670FB30">he cannot weep, he can heartily groan; and his heart &mdash; feels what his under&s;tanding &s;ees.</P>
<P N="3">3. The creature he now renounceth as vain, and turneth it out of his heart with di&s;dain. Not that he undervalueth it or di&s;claimeth its u&s;e; but its idola|trous abu&s;e, and its unju&s;t u&s;urpation.</P>
<P>There is a two-fold error very common in the de|&s;criptions of the work of conver&s;ion. The one, of tho&s;e who only mention the &s;inner's turning from &s;in to GOD, without mentioning the receiving <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> by faith. The other, of tho&s;e who only mention a &s;in|ner's believing, and then think they have &s;aid all: nay, they blame them as Legali&s;ts, who make any thing but the bare believing of the love of GOD in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to us, to be part of the work; and would per|&s;uade poor &s;ouls to que&s;tion all their former comforts, and conclude the work to have been only legal, be|cau&s;e they have made their change of heart and turn|ing from &s;in, part of it; and have taken up part of their comfort from the reviewing of the&s;e.</P>
<P>Indeed, &s;hould they take up here without <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or take &s;uch a change in&s;tead of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> in whole or in part, the reprehen&s;ion were ju&s;t. But can <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> be the way, where the creature is the end; is he not the only way to the Father? Can we &s;eek to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to reconcile us to GOD, while in our hearts we prefer the creature before him? In the &s;oul of every unre|generate man, the creature is both GOD and <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Can <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> be believed in, where our own righteou&s;|ne&s;s, or any other thing, is tru&s;ted as our Saviour?</P>
<P>The truth is: as turning from the creature to GOD, and not by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> is no true turning; &s;o believing in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> while the creature hath our hearts, is no true believing. And therefore in the work of &s;elf-exa|mination,
<PB N="80" REF="022331_0079_0FB7F5980D1C1440">whoever would find in him&s;elf a thorough &s;incere work, mu&s;t find an entire work; even the one of the&s;e as well as the other.</P>
<P>In the review of which entire work, there is no doubt but his &s;oul may take comfort. And it is not to be made &s;o light of, as mo&s;t do, that &s;cripture doth &s;o ordinarily put repentance before faith, and make them jointly conditions of the go&s;pel: which repent|ance contains tho&s;e acts of the will before expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is true, if we take faith in the large&s;t &s;en&s;e, then it contains repentance in it: but if we take it &s;trict|ly, no doubt there are &s;ome acts of it go before re|pentance, and &s;ome follow after.</P>
<P N="4">4. And as the will is thus averted from the fore|mentioned objects; &s;o at the &s;ame time doth it cleave to GOD the Father, and to <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Its fir&s;t acting con&s;i&s;ts e&s;pecially in intending and de&s;iring GOD for his portion and chief good; having before been con|vinced, that nothing e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e can be his happine&s;s, he now finds it in GOD; and therefore looks towards it. But it is yet rather with de&s;ire than hope. For alas, the &s;inner hath already found him&s;elf to be a &s;tranger and an enemy to GOD, under the guilt of &s;in and cur&s;e of the law, and knows there is no coming to him in peace till his ca&s;e be altered; and therefore having before been convinced al&s;o, that only <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is able and willing to do this, and having heard this mercy in the go&s;pel freely offered; his next act is, to accept of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as his Saviour and Lord.</P>
<P>Therefore both mi&s;take: they who only mention our turning to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and they who only mention our turning to GOD, in this work of conver&s;ion. St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s preaching was <HI>repentance towards</HI> GOD, <HI>and faith toward our</HI> Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And <HI>life eternal
<PB N="81" REF="022331_0080_0FB7F59A1E2C0F60">con&s;i&s;ts, fir&s;t in knowing the only true</HI> GOD, and then <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom he hath &s;ent,</HI> John xvii. 3. The former is the natural part of the covenant, to take the LORD only for our GOD. The latter is the &s;uper|natural part, to take <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> only for our Redeemer. The former is fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, and implied in the latter.</P>
<P>Though repentance and good works are required to our full ju&s;tification at judgment, as &s;ub&s;ervient to; or concurrent with faith; yet is the nature of this ju&s;tifying faith it&s;elf contained, in accepting of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for Saviour and Lord. I call it accepting, it being principally an act of the will; but yet al&s;o of the whole &s;oul. This accepting being that which the go&s;pel pre&s;&s;eth to, and calleth the receiving or ac|cepting <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> I call it an affectionate accepting, though love &s;eem di&s;tinct from faith, yet I take it as e&s;&s;ential to that faith that ju&s;tifies. To accept <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> without love, is not ju&s;tifying faith. Nor doth love follow as a fruit, but immediately concur; as e&s;&s;en|tial to a true accepting.</P>
<P>It is an accepting him for our Saviour and Lord. For in both relations will he be received, or not at all. It is not only to acknowledge his &s;ufferings, and ac|cept of pardon and glory, but to acknowledge his &s;o|vereignty, and &s;ubmit to his government and way of &s;aving.</P>
<P>The work (which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> thus accepted of, is to perform) is, to bring the &s;inners to GOD, that they may be happy in him; and this both really by his Spirit, and relatively in reconciling them, and making them &s;ons; and to pre&s;ent them perfect before him at la&s;t, and to po&s;&s;e&s;s them of the kingdom. The ob|taining of the&s;e are the &s;inner's lawful ends in receiv|ing <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and to the&s;e u&s;es doth he offer him&s;elf to us.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="82" REF="022331_0081_0FB7F59B94512048" MS="y">
5. To this end doth the &s;inner now enter into a cordial covenant with <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> But he was never &s;trictly, nor comfortably in covenant with <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> till now. He is &s;ure <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> doth con&s;ent, and now doth he cordially con&s;ent him&s;elf; and &s;o the agreement is fully made.</P>
<P N="6">6. With this covenant concurs, a mutual delivery; <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> delivereth him&s;elf in all comfortable relations to the &s;inner, and the &s;inner delivereth up him&s;elf to be &s;aved and ruled by <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Now doth the &s;oul re|&s;olvedly conclude, I have been blindly led by the fle&s;h, the world, and the devil, too long, almo&s;t to my de&s;truction: I will now be wholly at the di&s;po&s;al of my LORD, who hath bought me with his blood, and will bring me to his glory.

<P>Thus you have a naked enumeration of the e&s;&s;en|tials of this people of GOD: not a full portraiture of them in all their excellencies, nor all the notes where|by they be di&s;cerned. And though it will be part of the following application, to put you upon trial: yet becau&s;e the de&s;cription is now before your eyes, and the&s;e evidencing works are fre&s;h in your memory, it will not be un&s;ea&s;onable, to take an account of your own e&s;tates, and to view your&s;elves exactly in this gla&s;s, before you pa&s;s. And I be&s;eech thee, reader, as thou ha&s;t the hope of a chri&s;tian, yea, or the rea|&s;on of a man, to deal throughly, and &s;earch carefully, and judge thy&s;elf as one that mu&s;t &s;hortly be judged by the righteous GOD: and faithfully an&s;wer to the&s;e few que&s;tions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE been hitherto pre&s;enting to your under|&s;tandings, the excellency of the Re&s;t of the Saints. Let your hearts now cheerfully embrace it, and im|prove it, and I &s;hall pre&s;ent it to you, in its re&s;pec|tive u&s;es.</P>

<P><HI>The inconceivable mi&s;ery of the ungodly in their lo&s;s of this Re&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>And fir&s;t, if this re&s;t be for none but the people of GOD, what tidings is this to the ungodly world? That there is &s;o much glory, but none for them: &s;o great joys for the &s;aints of GOD, while they mu&s;t
<PB N="86" REF="022331_0085_0FB7F5A711496E28">con&s;ume in perpetual &s;orrows! If thou who reade&s;t the&s;e words, art a &s;tranger to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and to the holy nature and life of his people, and &s;halt live and die in the condition thou art now in; I am a me&s;&s;enger of the &s;adde&s;t tidings to thee, that ever yet thy ears did hear: that thou &s;halt never partake of the joys of hea|ven, nor have the lea&s;t ta&s;te of the &s;aints eternal re&s;t. I may &s;ay to thee, as <HI>Ehud</HI> to <HI>Egl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n;</HI> I have a me&s;&s;age to thee from GOD: but it is a mortal me&s;&s;age, that as &s;ure as the word of GOD is true, thou &s;halt never &s;ee the face of GOD with comfort. This &s;entence I am commanded to pa&s;s upon thee! Take it as thou wilt, and e&s;cape it if thou can&s;t. I know, if thy heart and life were throughly changed, thy relation to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and eternity, would be changed al&s;o; he would then acknowledge thee for one of his people, and give thee a portion in the inheritance of his cho|&s;en. But if thou end thy days in thy pre&s;ent condi|tion, as &s;ure as the heavens are over thy head, and the earth under thy feet; as &s;ure as thou live&s;t and breathe&s;t in this air, &s;o &s;ure &s;halt thou be &s;hut out of this re&s;t of the &s;aints, and receive thy portion in everla&s;ting &s;ire. I expect that thou &s;hould&s;t in the pride of thy heart, turn upon me, and &s;ay, and when did GOD &s;hew you the book of life, or tell you who they are that &s;hall be &s;aved, and who &s;hut out?</P>
<P>I will not an&s;wer thee according to thy folly; but plainly di&s;cover this thy folly to thy&s;elf, that if there be yet any hope, thou may&s;t recover thy under&s;tand|ing, and return to GOD and live: Fir&s;t, I do not name thee, nor any other; I only conclude of the unregenerate in general, and of thee conditionally, if thou be &s;uch an one. Secondly, I do not go about to determine who &s;hall repent, and who &s;hall not, much le&s;s, that thou &s;halt never repent, and come to <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> The&s;e things are unknown to me; I had far rather &s;hew thee what hopes thou ha&s;t before thee, if thou
<PB N="87" REF="022331_0086_0FB7F5A905E78150">wilt not &s;it &s;till and lo&s;e them: and I would far ra|ther per&s;uade thee to hearken in time, before the door is &s;hut again&s;t thee, that &s;o thy &s;oul may return and live, than tell thee that there is no hope of thy re|penting and returning. But if the foregoing de&s;crip|tion of the people of GOD do not agree with the &s;tate of thy &s;oul; it is then a hard que&s;tion, whether thou &s;halt ever be &s;aved? Even as hard a que&s;tion, as whe|ther GOD be true? Do I need to a&s;cend up into hea|ven, to know, <HI>That without holine&s;s none &s;hall &s;ee</HI> GOD? or, <HI>That only the pure in heart &s;hall &s;ee</HI> GOD? or, <HI>That except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of</HI> GOD? Cannot the&s;e be known without &s;earching into GOD's councils? And yet do&s;t thou a&s;k me, how I know who &s;hall be &s;aved? What need I go up to heaven to enquire that of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which he came down to earth to tell us? and &s;ent his Spirit in his prophets and apo&s;tles to tell us? and hath left upon record to all the world? And though I do not know the &s;ecrets of thy heart, and therefore cannot tell thee by name, whether it be thy &s;tate, or no; yet if thou art but willing or diligent, thou may&s;t know thy&s;elf, whether thou art an heir of heaven, or not. And that is the main thing that I de&s;ire, that if thou be yet mi&s;erable, thou may&s;t di&s;cern it, and e&s;cape it. But can&s;t thou e&s;cape, if thou neglect <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and &s;al|vation? <HI>If thou love father, mother, wife, children, hou&s;es, lands, or thine own life better than Chri&s;t; if &s;o, thou can&s;t not be his di&s;ciple.</HI> And con&s;equently can&s;t never be &s;aved by him. Is it not as impo&s;&s;ible for thee to be &s;aved, <HI>except thou be born again,</HI> as it is for the devils them&s;elves to be &s;aved? Nay, GOD hath more plainly and frequently &s;poken it in the &s;cripture, that &s;uch &s;inners as thou &s;hall never be &s;aved, than he hath done, that the devils &s;hall never be &s;aved. And do not the&s;e tidings go cold to thy heart? Methinks, but that there is yet life and hope before thee, and thou ha&s;t yet time and means to have thy &s;oul reco|vered.
<PB N="88" REF="022331_0087_0FB7F5AD2B33E020">the &s;ight of thy ca&s;e &s;hould even &s;trike thee dead with amazement.

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The ungodly in their lo&s;s of heaven, lo&s;e all that glorious per&s;onal perfection, which the peo|ple of GOD there enjoy.

Though even the bodies of the wicked will be rai&s;ed incorruptible, yet that will be &s;o far from be|ing happine&s;s to them, that it only makes them capa|ble of the more exqui&s;ite torments. They would be glad then, if every member were a dead member, that it might not feel the puni&s;hment inflicted on it; and the whole body were a rotten carca&s;e, or might again lie down in du&s;t and darkne&s;s. Much more do they want that moral perfection which the ble&s;&s;ed partake of; tho&s;e holy di&s;po&s;itions; that ble&s;&s;ed conformity to the holine&s;s of GOD; that cheerful readine&s;s to do his will; that perfect rectitude of all their actions: in&s;tead of the&s;e, they have their old ulcerous deform|ed &s;ouls, that perver&s;ene&s;s of will, that di&s;order in their faculties, that loathing of good, that love to evil, that violence of pa&s;&s;ion, which they had on earth. It is true, their under&s;tandings will be much cleared, both by the cea&s;ing of temptation and deluding ob|jects, and by the &s;ad experience which they will have in hell, of the fal&s;ehood of their former conceits and delu&s;ions. But the evil di&s;po&s;ition is never the more changed; they have the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions &s;till, and &s;ain would commit the &s;ame &s;ins, if they could; they want but opportunity; certainly they &s;hall have none of the glorious perfections of the faints, either in &s;oul or body. There will be a greater difference be|tween

<P>But the great lo&s;s of the damned, will be their lo&s;s of GOD, they &s;hall have no comfortable relation to him: nor communion with him.

He will never admit them to the inheritance of his &s;aints, nor endure them to &s;tand among&s;t them in his pre&s;ence: but bid them, <HI>depart from Me, ye work|ers of iniquity, I know ye not.</HI> Now the&s;e men dare bely the Lord, if not bla&s;pheme, in calling him by the title of their Father; how boldly and confidently do they daily approach him with their lips, and indeed reproach him in their formal prayers, with that appel|lation? As if GOD would father the devil's children; or, as if the &s;lighters of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the friends of the world, the haters of godline&s;s, or any that delight in iniquity, were the offspring of heaven! They are ready now, to lay confident claims to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as if they were &s;in|cere believers. But when that time is come, and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> will &s;eparate his followers from his foes, and his faithful friends from his deceived flatterers, where then will be their pre&s;umptuous claim? Then they &s;hall find that GOD is not their father, but their foe, becau&s;e they would not be his people. And as they would not con&s;ent that GOD &s;hould by his Spirit dwell in them, &s;o &s;hall not the&s;e evil-doers dwell with him; the tabernacles of wickedne&s;s &s;hall have no fellow&s;hip with him: nor the wicked inhabit the city of GOD; <HI>for without are dogs, &s;orcerers, whore mongers, murderers, idolaters, and what&s;oev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r loveth and maketh a lie.</HI> GOD is fir&s;t enjoyed in part on earth, before he be fully en|joyed in heaven.

And as the enjoying of GOD is the enjoying of all; &s;o the lo&s;s of GOD is the lo&s;s of all.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> As they lo&s;e GOD: &s;o they lo&s;e all tho&s;e delightful affections and actions, by which the ble&s;&s;ed feed on GOD; tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tran&s;porting knowledge: tho&s;e ravi&s;hing views of his glorious face: the inconceiva|ble plea&s;ure of loving GOD: the apprehen&s;ions of his infinite love to us: the con&s;tant joys which his &s;aints are taken up with, and the rivers of con&s;olation wherewith he doth &s;atisfy them. Is it nothing to lo&s;e all this? The employment of a king in ruling a king|dom, doth not &s;o far exceed the employment of the vile&s;t &s;lave, as this heavenly employment exceedeth his.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> They &s;hall be depri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;o|ciety of angels and glorified &s;aints. In&s;tead of being companions of tho&s;e happy &s;pirits, and numbered with tho&s;e joyful and triumphing kings, they mu&s;t now be members of the corporation of hell, where they &s;hall have companions of a far different nature. While they lived on earth, they loathed the &s;aints, they im|pri&s;oned, bani&s;hed them, and ca&s;t them out of their &s;ocieties, or at lea&s;t they would not be their compa|nions in labour, and in &s;ufferings; and therefore they &s;hall not now be their companions in their glory. Now you are &s;hut out of that company, from which you fir&s;t &s;hut out your&s;elves; and are &s;eparated from them whom you would not be joined with. You could not endure them in your hou&s;es, nor in your

When they were dead or bani&s;hed, you were glad they were gone; and thought the country was well rid of them. They mole&s;ted you with their faithful reproving your &s;in: their holy conver&s;ation troubled you. You &s;carce ever heard them pray or &s;ing prai&s;es in their families, but it was a vexation to you; and you envied their liberty of wor&s;hipping GOD. And is it then any wonder if you be &s;eparated from them hereafter? The day is near when they will trouble you no more; betwixt them and you will be a great gulf &s;et, that tho&s;e that would pa&s;s from thence to you (if any had a de|&s;ire to ea&s;e you with a drop of water) cannot, neither can they pa&s;s to them, who would go from you.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> The Aggravation of the Lo&s;s of Heaven to the Ungodly.</HEAD>
<P>I KNOW many will be ready to think, if this be all, they do not much care: what care they for lo&s;ing the perfections above? What care they for lo&s;ing GOD, his favour, or his pre&s;ence? They lived mer|rily without him on earth, and why &s;hould it be &s;o grievous to be without him hereafter? and what care they for being deprived of that love, and joy, and prai&s;ing of GOD. They never ta&s;ted &s;weetne&s;s in the things of that nature; or what care they for being de|prived of the fellow&s;hip of angels and &s;aints? They could &s;pare their company in this world well enough,
<PB N="92" REF="022331_0091_0FB7F5B8F0720DC8">and why may they not be without it in the world to come? To make the&s;e men therefore under&s;tand the truth of their future condition, I will here annex the&s;e two things:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. I will &s;hew you why this lo&s;s will be intolera|ble, and mo&s;t tormenting then, though it &s;eem as no|thing now.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. I will &s;hew you what other lo&s;&s;es will accompa|ny the&s;e; which, though they are le&s;s in them&s;elves, yet will now be more &s;en&s;ibly apprehended.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">1. Then, That this lo&s;s of heaven will be mo&s;t tor|menting, may appear by the&s;e con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. The under&s;tandings of the ungodly will be then cleared, to know the worth of that which they have lo&s;t. Now they lament not their lo&s;s of GOD, becau&s;e they never knew his excellency, nor the lo&s;s of that holy employment and &s;ociety, for they were never &s;en&s;ible what they were worth. A man that hath lo&s;t a jewel, and took it but for a common &s;tone, is never troubled at his lo&s;s; but when he comes to know what he has lo&s;t, then he lamenteth it.</P>
<P>Though the under&s;tandings of the damned will not then be &s;anctified; yet will they be cleared from a multitude of errors. They think now that their ho|nour, their e&s;tates, their plea&s;ures, their health and life, are better worth their labour, than the things of another world; but when the&s;e things which had their hearts, have left them in mi&s;ery, when they know by experience, the things which before they did but read and heard of, they w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> be quite in another mind. They would not believe that water would drown, till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> were in the &s;ea; nor that the fire would burn, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> were ca&s;t into it; but when they &s;eel it, they
<PB N="93" REF="022331_0092_0FB7F5BCA7CC89A0">will ea&s;ily believe. All that error of their mind, which made them &s;et light by GOD, and abhor his wor&s;hip, and vilify his people, will then be removed by experience; their knowledge &s;hall be increa&s;ed, that their &s;orrows may be increa&s;ed. Doubtle&s;s tho&s;e poor &s;ouls would be comparatively happy, if their under&s;tandings were wholly taken from them, if they had no more knowledge than idiots, or brute bea&s;ts; or if they knew no more in hell, than they did upon earth, their lo&s;s and mi&s;ery would then le&s;s trouble them.</P>
<P>How happy would they now think them&s;elves, if they did not know there is &s;uch a place as heaven! Now when their knowledge would help to prevent their mi&s;ery, they will not know: but then when their knowledge will but feed their con&s;uming fire, they &s;hall know whether they will or no.</P>
<P N="2">2. The lo&s;s of heaven will more torment them then, becau&s;e, as the under&s;tanding will be cleared, &s;o it will be more enlarged, and made more capacious, to conceive of the worth of that glory which they have lo&s;t. The &s;trength of their apprehen&s;ions, as well as the truth of them, will then be increa&s;ed. What deep apprehen&s;ions of the wrath of GOD, of the mad|ne&s;s of &s;inning, of the mi&s;ery of &s;inners, have the&s;e &s;ouls that now endure this mi&s;ery, in compari&s;on of tho&s;e on earth that do but hear of it? What &s;en&s;ible apprehen&s;ions of the worth of life, hath the condem|ned, man that is going to be executed, in compari&s;on of what he was wont to have in the time of his pro&s;|perity? Much more will the actual deprivation of eternal ble&s;&s;edne&s;s make the damned exceeding appre|hen&s;ive of the greatne&s;s of their lo&s;s: and as a large ve&s;&s;el will hold more water than a &s;hell, &s;o will their more enlarged under&s;tandings contain more matter to feed their torment, than now their &s;hallow capacity can do.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="94" REF="022331_0093_0FB7F5BF2D959DE0">
3. And as the damned will have deeper apprehen|&s;ions of the happine&s;s they have lo&s;t, &s;o will they have a clo&s;er application of this doctrine to them&s;elves, which will exceedingly tend to increa&s;e their torment. It will then be no hard matter to them to &s;ay, this is my lo&s;s, and this is my everla&s;ting mi&s;ery. The want of this is the main cau&s;e why they are now &s;o little troubled at their condition; they are hardly brought to believe that there is &s;uch a &s;tate of mi&s;ery, but more hardly to believe that it is like to be their own. This makes &s;o many &s;ermons to be lo&s;t, and all threatenings and warnings prove in vain. Let a mini&s;ter of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hew them their mi&s;ery never &s;o plainly, they will not be per&s;uaded that they are &s;o mi&s;erable. Let him tell them of the glory they mu&s;t lo&s;e, and the &s;ufferings they mu&s;t feel, and they think it is not they whom he means. We find in all our preaching, by &s;ad experience, that it is one of the harde&s;t things in the world to bring a wicked man to know that he is wicked; a man who is in the way to hell, to know that he is in that way; or to make a man &s;ee him&s;elf in a &s;tate of wrath and condemnation: how &s;eldom do we hear men, after the plaine&s;t di&s;co|very of their condemned &s;tate, cry out, <HI>I am the man!</HI> or to acknowledge, that if they die in their pre&s;ent condition, they are undone for-ever.</P>
<P>There is no per&s;uading men of their mi&s;ery till they fell it, except the Spirit of the Almighty per|&s;uade them.</P>
<P>Oh, but when they find them&s;elves &s;uddenly in the land of darkne&s;s, perceive by the execution of the &s;entence that they were indeed condemned, and feel them&s;elves in the &s;corching flames, and &s;ee that they are &s;hut out of the pre&s;ence of GOD for-ever, it will then be no &s;uch difficult matter to convince them of their mi&s;ery: this particular application of GOD'S anger to them|&s;elves,
<PB N="95" REF="022331_0094_0FB7F5C150772A08">will then be the ea&s;ie&s;t matter in the world; then they cannot choo&s;e but know and apply it, whe|ther they will or no.</P>
<P N="4">4. Again, as the under&s;tandings and con&s;ciences of &s;inners will be &s;trengthened, &s;o will their affections be more lively and enlarged: as judgment will be no longer blinded, nor con&s;cience &s;tifled, &s;o the affecti|ons will be no longer &s;tupified. A hard heart now makes heaven and hell &s;eem but trifles: and when we have &s;hewed them everla&s;ting glory and mi&s;ery, they are as men half a&s;leep, they &s;carce take notice what we &s;ay, our words are ca&s;t as &s;tones again&s;t a hard wall, which fly back in the face of him that ca&s;teth them. We talk of terrible a&s;toni&s;hing things, but it is to dead men that cannot apprehend it: we &s;peak to rocks rather than to men; the earth will as &s;oon tremble as they. But when the&s;e dead wretches are revived, what pa&s;&s;ionate &s;en&s;ibility! what working affections! what pangs of horror! what depth of &s;or|row will there then be! How violently will they fly in their own faces! How will they rage again&s;t their former madne&s;s! The lamentations of the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;i|onate wife for the lo&s;s of her hu&s;band, or of the ten|dere&s;t mother for the lo&s;s of her children, will be no|thing to theirs for the lo&s;s of heaven. Oh, the &s;elf|accu&s;ing, and &s;elf-tormenting fury of tho&s;e forlorn wretches! How they will even tear their own hearts, and be GOD'S executioners upon them&s;elves! I am per&s;uaded, as it was none but them&s;elves that com|mitted the &s;in, and them&s;elves that were the merito|rious cau&s;e of their &s;ufferings, &s;o them&s;elves will be the chief executioners of tho&s;e &s;ufferings; GOD will have it &s;o for the clearing of his ju&s;tice: even Satan him|&s;elf, as he was not &s;o great a cau&s;e of their &s;inning as them&s;elves, &s;o will he not be &s;o great an in&s;trument of their torment. How happy would you think your|&s;elves then, if you were turned into rocks, or any
<PB N="96" REF="022331_0095_0FB7F5C5673FDA00">thing that had neither pa&s;&s;ion or &s;en&s;e! How happy were you, if you could now feel, as lightly as you were wont to hear! And if you could &s;leep out the time of execution, as you did the time of the &s;ermons that warned you of it! But your &s;tupidity is gone, it will not be.</P>
<P N="5">5. Moreover, it will much increa&s;e the torment of the damned, that their memories will be as large and &s;trong as their under&s;tandings and affections. Were their lo&s;s never &s;o great, and their &s;en&s;e of it never &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate, yet if they could but lo&s;e the u&s;e of their memory, tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions would die, and that lo&s;s, be|ing forgotten, would little trouble them. But as they cannot lay by their life and being, &s;o neither can they lay a&s;ide any part of that being. Under|&s;tanding, con&s;cience, affections, memory, mu&s;t all live to torment them, which &s;hould have helped to their happine&s;s. And as by the&s;e they &s;hould have fed upon the love of GOD, and drawn forth perpetu|ally the joys of his pre&s;ence; &s;o by the&s;e mu&s;t they now feed upon the wrath of GOD, and draw forth continually the pains of his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>And yet the&s;e men would never be brought to con|&s;ider; but in the latter days (&s;aith the LORD) they &s;hall perfectly con&s;ider it: when they are en&s;nared in the work of their own hands: when GOD hath arre&s;t|ed them, and judgment is pa&s;&s;ed upon them, and ven|geance is poured out upon them to the full, then they cannot choo&s;e but con&s;ider it whether they will or no. Now they have no lei&s;ure to con&s;ider, nor any room in their memories for the things of another life. But then they &s;hall have lei&s;ure enough, they &s;hall be where they have nothing el&s;e to do; their memories &s;hall have no other employment, it &s;hall be engraven upon the tables of their hearts. GOD would have had the doctrine of their eternal &s;tate to have been
<PB N="97" REF="022331_0096_0FB7F5C649F7F8B0">written on the po&s;ts of their doors, on their hou&s;es, on their hands, and on their hearts: and &s;eeing they rejected this coun&s;el of the LORD, therefore &s;hall it be written always before them in the place of their thraldom, that which way &s;oever they look, they may &s;till behold it.</P>
<P>I will briefly lay down &s;ome of tho&s;e con&s;iderati|ons, which will thus feed the angui&s;h of the&s;e damned wretches.</P>
<P N="1">1. It will torment them to think of the greatne&s;s of the glory which they have lo&s;t. Oh if it had been that which they could have &s;pared, it had been a &s;mall matter: Or, if it had been a lo&s;s reparable with any thing el&s;e; if it had been health, or wealth, or friends, or life, it had been nothing; but to lo&s;e <HI>that exceed|ing eternal weight of glory!</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2. It will torment them to think of the po&s;&s;ibility that once they were in of obtaining it. Then they will remember, the time was, when I was in as fair a po&s;&s;ibility of the kingdom as others; I was &s;et upon the &s;tage of the world; if I had played my part wi&s;e|ly and faithfully, now I might have had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the inheritance; I might have been among&s;t yonder ble&s;&s;ed &s;aints, who am now tormented with the&s;e damned fiends! The Lord did &s;et before me life and death, and having cho&s;en death, I de&s;erve to &s;uffer it: the prize was once held out before me; if I bad run well, I might have obtained it: if I had &s;triven, I might have had the ma&s;tery: if I had fought valiantly, I had been crowned.</P>
<P N="3">3. It will yet more torment them to remember, not only the po&s;&s;ibility, but the great probability that once they were in, to obtain the crown. It will then wound them, to think: why, I had once the gales
<PB N="98" REF="022331_0097_0FB7F5C8EBDE8B88">of the Spirit ready to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted me. I was fully purpo&s;ed to have been another man, to have cleaved to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and to have for&s;ook the world; I was al|mo&s;t re&s;olved to have been wholly for GOD: I had even ca&s;t off my old companions, and yet I turned back, and lo&s;t my hold, and broke my promi&s;es, and &s;lacked my purpo&s;es; almo&s;t GOD had per&s;uaded me to be a real chri&s;tian, and yet I conquered tho&s;e per|&s;ua&s;ions. What workings were in my heart! when a faithful mini&s;ter pre&s;&s;ed home the truth. O how fair was I once for heaven! I had almo&s;t had i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and yet I have lo&s;t it; if I had but followed on to &s;eek the LORD, and blown up the &s;parks of de&s;ire which were kindled in me, I had now been ble&s;&s;ed among the &s;aints.</P>
<P N="4">4. Yet further, it will much add to their torment to remember that GOD him&s;elf did conde&s;cend to en|treat them: how long he did wait, how freely he did offer, how lovingly he did invite, and how impor|tunately he did &s;olicit them! how the Spirit did con|tinue &s;triving with their hearts, as if he were loth to take a denial: how <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;tood knocking at the door of their hearts, &s;ermon after &s;ermon, and one &s;abbath after another; crying out, open, &s;inner, open thy heart to the Saviour, and <HI>I will come in and &s;up with thee and thou with me.</HI> Why do&s;t thou thus delay? What do&s;t thou mean, that thou do&s;t not open to me? How long &s;hall it be till thou attain to innocency? <HI>How long &s;hall thy vain thoughts ledge within thee?</HI> Wo to thee, Oh unworthy &s;inner! Wilt thou not be made clean? Wilt thou not be pardoned and &s;anctified, and made happy? When &s;hall it once be? Oh that thou would&s;t hearken to my word, and obey my go&s;pel! <HI>Then &s;hould thy peace be as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and thy righteou&s;|ne&s;s as the waves of the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a: though thy &s;ins were as red as crim&s;on, I would mak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them as white as the &s;now: O that thou were but wi&s;e to con&s;ider this! and that thou

Shall the GOD of all the world be&s;eech thee to be happy, and be&s;eech thee to have pity upon thine own &s;oul, and wilt thou not regard him? Why did he make thy ears but to hear his voice? Why did he make thy under&s;tanding, but to con&s;ider? Or thy heart, but to entertain the Son in love? <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts, con&s;ider thy ways.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Oh how all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ionate pleadings of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> will pa&s;&s;ionately tran&s;port the damned with &s;elf-indigna|tion! That they will be ready to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear out their own hearts! How fre&s;h will the remembrance of them be &s;till in their minds, lancing their &s;ouls with renewed torments! What &s;elf-condemning pangs will it rai&s;e within them, to remember how oft <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> would have gathered them to him&s;elf <HI>even as the hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but they would not?</HI> Then will they cry out again&s;t them&s;elves, how ju&s;tly is all this befallen me! Mu&s;t I tire out the patience of <HI>Chri&s;t?</HI> Mu&s;t I make the GOD of heaven to follow me in vain, till I had wearied him with crying to me, <HI>re|pent, return?</HI> Mu&s;t the LORD of all the world thus wait upon me, and all in vain? O how ju&s;tly is that patience now turned into fury, which falls upon my &s;oul with irre&s;i&s;tible violence! when the LORD cried out to me in his word, <HI>How long will it be before thou wilt be made clean and holy?</HI> My heart, or at lea&s;t my practice an&s;wered, <HI>never;</HI> I will never be &s;o preci&s;e: and now when I cry out, how long will it be till I be freed from this torment, and &s;aved with the &s;aints! how ju&s;tly do I receive the an&s;wer! <HI>never, never.</HI>&mdash;Oh &s;inner, I be&s;eech thee for thy own &s;ake, think of this while the voice of mercy &s;oundeth in thine ears! Yet patience continueth waiting upon thee:

Yet the offers of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and life are made to thee in the go&s;pel, and the hand of GOD is &s;tretched out to thee: but will it &s;till be thus? The Spirit hath not yet done &s;triving with thy heart: but do&s;t thou know how &s;oon he may turn away, and give thee over to a reprobate mind?

<P N="5">5. Again, it will be a mo&s;t cutting con&s;ideration to the&s;e, to remember on what ea&s;y terms they might have e&s;caped their mi&s;ery. If their work had been to remove mountains, to conquer kingdoms, then the impo&s;&s;ibility would &s;omewhat a&s;&s;uage the rage of their &s;elf-accu&s;ing con&s;cience. If their conditions for hea|ven had been, the &s;atisfying of ju&s;tice for all their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, the &s;uffering of all the law did lay up|on them, or bearing the burden which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was fain to bear; this were nothing but to &s;uffer hell to e&s;cape hell. But their conditions were of another nature. The yoke was light and the burden was ea&s;y, which JESUS CHRIST would have laid upon them; his com|mandments were not grievous. It was but to repent, and accept him as their Saviour; to &s;tudy his will, and &s;eek his face; to renounce all other happine&s;s, but that which he procureth us, and to take the LORD alone for our &s;upreme good; to renounce the govern|ment of the world and the fle&s;h, and to &s;ubmit to his meek and gracious government; to for&s;ake the ways of our own devi&s;ing, and to walk in his holy delightful way; to engage our&s;elves to this by cove|nant

<P>The&s;e were the terms on which they might ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> joyed the kingdom.

<P>When the poor wretch &s;hall look back upon the&s;e ea&s;y terms which he refu&s;ed, and compare the labour of them with the pains and lo&s;s which he there &s;u&s;tain|eth, it cannot be now conceived how it will rent his very heart! Ah, thinks he, how ju&s;tly do I &s;uffer all this, who would not be at &s;o &s;mall pains to avoid it? Where was my under&s;tanding when I neglected thy gracious offer; when I called the LORD a hard ma&s;ter? and thought his plea&s;ant &s;ervice to be a bondage, and the &s;ervice of the devil and my fle&s;h to be the only freedom?

7. Yet much more will it add unto their torment, when they con&s;ider that all this was their own doings, and that they wilfully procured their own de&s;truction: had they been forced to &s;in, it would much abate the rage of their con&s;ciences, or if they were puni&s;hed for another man's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions: or if any other had been the chief author of their ruin: but to think, that it was the choice of their own wills, and that GOD had &s;et them in &s;o free a condition, that none in the world could have forced them to &s;in again&s;t their wills, this will be a griping thought. What (thinks this wretched creature) had I not enemies enough in the world, but I mu&s;t be an enemy to my|&s;elf? GOD would neither give the devil, nor the world, &s;o much power over me, as to force me to commit the lea&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. If I had not con&s;ent|ed, their temptations had been in vain; they could but entice me, it was my&s;elf that yielded, and did the evil; and I mu&s;t needs lay hands upon my own &s;oul, and imbrue my hands in my own blood. Who &s;hould pity me, who pitied not my&s;elf, and who brought all this upon mine own head? Never did GOD do me any good, or offer me any for the welfare of my &s;oul, but I re&s;i&s;ted him: he hath heaped mercy upon me, and renewed one deliverance after another, to entice my heart to him, and yet was I never heartily willing to &s;erve him: he hath gently cha&s;ti&s;ed me, and made me groan under the fruit of my di&s;obedience, and yet, though I promi&s;ed largely in my affliction, I was never unfeignedly willing to obey him.</P>
<P>Thus will it gnaw the hearts of the&s;e wretches, to remember that they were the cau&s;e of their undoing; and that they wilfully and ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in their rebellion, and were mere volunteers in the &s;ervice of the devil. They would venture, they would go on, they would not hear him that &s;poke again&s;t it: GOD called to them to hear and &s;tay, but they would

All this they did take upon them and perform. What a num|ber of &s;ins did they manage at once! What difficulties did they &s;et upon! Even the conquering the power of rea&s;on it&s;elf. What dangers did they adventure on! Though they walked in continual danger of the wrath of GOD, and knew he could lay them in the du&s;t in a moment; though they knew they lived in danger of eternal perdition, yet would they run upon all this. What did they for&s;ake for the &s;ervice of Satan, and the plea&s;ures of &s;in? They for&s;ook their GOD, their con&s;cience, their be&s;t friends, their hopes of &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Oh the labour that it co&s;teth poor wretches to be damned! Sobriety they might have at a cheaper rate, and a great deal of health and ea&s;e too; and yet they will rather have gluttony and drunkenne&s;s, with po|verty and &s;hame and &s;ickne&s;s, with the out-cries and lamentations of wife and children, and con&s;cience it|&s;elf. Contentedne&s;s they might have with ea&s;e and delight; yet will they rather have covetou&s;ne&s;s and ambition; though it co&s;t them &s;tudy, and cares, and fears, and labour of body and mind, and continual unquietne&s;s and di&s;traction of &s;pirit. Though their

<P>O how the reviews of this will feed the flames in hell! With what rage will the&s;e damned wretches cur&s;e them&s;elves, and &s;ay, was damnation worth all this co&s;t and pains? Was it not enough that I peri&s;h|ed enough my negligence, and that I &s;at &s;till while <HI>Satan</HI> played his game, but I mu&s;t &s;eek &s;o diligently my own perdition? Might I not have been damned on free co&s;t, but I mu&s;t purcha&s;e it &s;o dearly? I thought I could have been &s;aved without &s;o much ado: and could I not have been de&s;troyed without &s;o much ado? How well is all my care, and pains, and vio|lence now requited? Mu&s;t I work out &s;o laboriou&s;ly my own damnation, when GOD commanded me to work out my &s;alvation? O if I had done as much for heaven as I did for hell, I had &s;urely had it. I cried out of the tedious way of godline&s;s; and yet I could be at more pains for <HI>Satan,</HI> and for death. If I had loved <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as &s;trongly as I did my plea&s;ures, and profits, and honours, and thought on him as of|ten, and &s;ought him as painfully, O how happy had I now been! But ju&s;tly do I &s;uffer the flames of hell, who would rather buy them &s;o dear, than have hea|ven when it was purcha&s;ed to my hands.</P>
<P>Thus I have &s;hewed you &s;ome of tho&s;e thoughts which will aggravate the mi&s;ery of the&s;e wretches for|ever. O that GOD would per&s;uade thee, who read|e&s;t the&s;e words, to take up the&s;e thoughts now, for the preventing that inconceivable calamity, &s;o that thou maye&s;t not take them up in hell as thy own tormentor.</P>

<P>HAVING &s;hewed you tho&s;e con&s;iderations which will then aggravate their mi&s;ery, I am next to &s;hew you their additional lo&s;&s;es, which will aggravate it. For as <HI>godline&s;s hath the promi&s;e both of this life, and that which is to come;</HI> and as GOD hath &s;aid, <HI>That if we fir&s;t &s;eek his kingdom and righteou&s;ne&s;s, all things el&s;e &s;hall be added to us:</HI> &s;o al&s;o are the ungodly threat|ened with the lo&s;s both of &s;piritual and of corporal ble&s;&s;ings; and becau&s;e they &s;ought not fir&s;t <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s kingdom and righteou&s;ne&s;s, therefore &s;hall they lo&s;e both it, and that which they did &s;eek, and there &s;hall be taken from them even that little which they have. If they could but have kept their pre&s;ent enjoyments, they would not have much cared for the lo&s;s of hea|ven: but catching at the &s;hadow for the &s;ub&s;tance, they now find they have lo&s;t both; and that when they rejected <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> they rejected all things. If they had lo&s;t and for&s;aken all for <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> they would have found all again in him; for he would have been all in all to them: but now they have for&s;aken <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for other things, they &s;hall lo&s;e <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and that al&s;o for which they did for&s;ake him.</P>
<P>But I will particularly open to you &s;ome of their other lo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">1. They &s;hall lo&s;e their pre&s;ent conceit of their in|tere&s;t in GOD, and of his favour towards them, and of their part in the merits and &s;ufferings of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> This fal&s;e belief doth now &s;upport their &s;pirits, and defend them from the terrors that would el&s;e &s;eize up|on
<PB N="107" REF="022331_0106_0FB7F26C5BB3CFE8">on them: but what will ea&s;e their trouble when this is gone? When they can believe no longer, they will be quiet no longer. If a man conceit that he is in &s;afety, his conceit may make him cheerful till his mi&s;ery comes, and then both his conceit and com|forts vani&s;h.</P>
<P>There is none of this believing in hell; nor any per&s;ua&s;ion of pardon or happine&s;s, nor any boa&s;ting of their hone&s;ty, nor ju&s;tifying them&s;elves. This was but <HI>Satan</HI>'s &s;tratagem, that, being blindfold, they might follow him the more boldly; but then he will uncover their eyes, and they &s;hall &s;ee where they are.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another addition to the mi&s;ery of the damned will be this: that with the lo&s;s of heaven, they &s;hall lo&s;e all their hopes. In this life, though they were threatened with the wrath of GOD, yet their hope of e&s;caping it did bear up their hearts. We can now &s;carce &s;peak with the vile&s;t drunkard, or &s;wearer, or &s;corner, but he hopes to be &s;aved for all this. O happy world, if &s;alvation were as common as this hope; even tho&s;e who&s;e helli&s;h nature is written in the face of their conver&s;ation, who&s;e tongues plead the cau&s;e of the devil, and &s;peak the language of hell; yet &s;trongly hope for heaven, though the GOD of heaven hath told them no &s;uch &s;hall ever come there. Nay, &s;o &s;trong are men's hopes, that they will di&s;pute the cau&s;e with <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf at judgment, and plead <HI>their eating and drinking in his pre&s;ence, their preaching in his name, and ca&s;ting out devils,</HI> (and the&s;e are more probable arguments than our bapti&s;m, and common profe&s;&s;ion, and name of chri&s;tians) they will &s;tiffly de|ny that ever they <HI>neglected Chri&s;t in hunger, nakedne&s;s, pri&s;on,</HI> till <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> confute them with the &s;entence of their condemnation. Though the heart of their hopes will be broken at their death; yet, it &s;eems, they would fain plead for &s;uch hope at the general judg|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="022331_0107_0FB7F26DDDA67FF8">
But, O the &s;ad &s;tate of the&s;e men, when they mu&s;t bid farewell to all their hopes! When their hopes &s;hall all peri&s;h with them! <HI>The eyes of the wicked &s;hall fail, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir hope &s;hall be as the giving up of the gho&s;t.</HI> The giving up of the gho&s;t is a fit, but terrible re|&s;emblance of a wicked man's giving up his hopes.</P>
<P>For <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> as the &s;oul departeth not from the body without the greate&s;t pain, &s;o doth the hope of the wicked depart. O the pangs that &s;eize upon the &s;oul of the &s;inner at death and judgment, when he is parting with all his hopes!</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The &s;oul departeth from the body &s;udden|ly, in a moment, which hath there delightfully con|tinued &s;o many years: ju&s;t &s;o doth the hope of the wicked depart.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The &s;oul which then departeth, will never return to live with the body in this world any more; and the hope of the wicked, when it departeth, tak|eth an everla&s;ting farewell of his &s;oul. A miracle of re&s;urrection &s;hall again conjoin the &s;oul and body, but there &s;hall be no &s;uch miraculous re&s;urrection of the damned's hope.</P>
<P>Methinks it is the mo&s;t doleful &s;pectacle that this world affords, to &s;ee an ungodly per&s;on dying; his &s;oul and hopes departing together! With what a &s;ad change he appears in another world! Then if a man could but &s;peak with that hopele&s;s &s;oul, and a&s;k it, are you now as confident of &s;alvation as you were wont to be? Do you now hope to be &s;aved as &s;oon as the mo&s;t godly? O what a &s;ad an&s;wer would he return!</P>
<P>O that carele&s;s &s;inners would be awakened to think of this in time! If thou be one of them, who art reading the&s;e lines, I do here, as a friend, advi&s;e thee,

Re&s;t not till thou can&s;t give a rea&s;on of all thy hopes; till thou can&s;t prove, that they are the hopes which grace and not nature, hath wrought; that they are ground|ed upon &s;cripture-promi&s;es; that they purify thy heart; that they quicken, and not cool thy endea|vours in godline&s;s; that the more thou hope&s;t, the le&s;s thou &s;inne&s;t, and the more painful thou art in fol|lowing on the work, and not grown more loo&s;e and carele&s;s by the increa&s;ing of thy hopes; that thou art willing to have them tried, and fearful of being de|ceived; that they &s;tir up thy de&s;ires of enjoying what thou hope&s;t for, and the deferring thereof is the trouble of thy heart.</P>
<P>There is a hope which is a &s;ingular grace and du|ty; and there is a hope which is a notorious, dange|rous &s;in: &s;o con&s;equently there is a de&s;pair which is a grievous &s;in; and there is a de&s;pair which is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to thy &s;alvation.</P>

<P>The&s;e things I would have thee de&s;pair of, and whatever el&s;e GOD hath told thee &s;hall never come to pa&s;s.

<P>Con&s;ider, if a man be quite out of his way, what mu&s;t be the fir&s;t means to bring him in again? Why a de&s;pair of ever coming to his journey's end in the way that he is in. If his home be ea&s;tward, and he be going we&s;tward, as long as he hopes he is in the right, he will go on: and as long as he goes on hop|ing, he goes further ami&s;s. Therefore when he meets with &s;omebody that a&s;&s;ures him that he is clean out of his way, and brings him to de&s;pair of coming home except he turn back again; then he wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l return, and then he may hope.</P>
<P>Why, &s;inner, ju&s;t &s;o it is with thy &s;oul; thou art out of the way to heaven, and in that way thou ha&s;t proceeded many a year; yet thou goe&s;t on quietly, and hope&s;t to be &s;aved, becau&s;e thou art not &s;o bad as many others.

Who will turn out of his way while he hopes he is right? Remember what I &s;ay; till thou feel GOD convincing thee, that the way which thou ha&s;t lived in will not &s;erve thy turn, and &s;o break down thy former hopes, there is yet no &s;aving work wrought upon thee, how well &s;oever thou may&s;t hope

<P N="3">3. Another additional lo&s;s, aggravating their lo&s;s of heaven, is this, they &s;hall lo&s;e all their carnal mirth; they will &s;ay to them&s;elves (as <HI>Solomon</HI> doth) <HI>of their laughter, thou art mad; and of their mirth, what did&s;t thou?</HI> Eccle&s;. ii. 2.

Come, as we have &s;inned together, let us pray together be|fore we &s;tir, that GOD would pardon us; and let us enter into a promi&s;e with one another that we will do thus no more, but will meet together in the wor&s;hip of GOD, and help one another towards heaven, as

<P N="1">1. From the principal author of them, which is GOD him&s;elf: as it was no le&s;s than GOD whom the &s;inners had offended, &s;o it is no le&s;s than GOD that will puni&s;h them for their offences. He hath prepared tho&s;e torments for his enemies. His continued anger will &s;till be devouring them. His breath of indigna|tion will kindle the flames. His wrath will be an intolerable burden to their &s;ouls. If it were but a creature that they had to do with, they might better
<PB N="114" REF="022331_0113_0FB7F28281675830">bear it. But wo to him that falls under the &s;trokes of the Almighty! They &s;hall feel to their &s;orrow, <HI>That it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living</HI> GOD. It were nothing in compari&s;on to this, if all the world were again&s;t them, or if the &s;trength of all the creatures were united in one to inflict their penalty. What a con&s;uming fire is his wrath? <HI>If it he kindled here, and that but a little,</HI> how do we wither before it, <HI>as the gra&s;s that it cut down before the &s;un?</HI> How &s;oon doth our &s;trength decay, and turn to weak|ne&s;s, and our beauty to deformity! The flames do not &s;o ea&s;ily run through the dry &s;tubble, as the wrath of GOD will feed upon the&s;e wretches. Oh, they that could not bear a pri&s;on, or a gibbet, for <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;carce a few &s;corns, how will they now bear the de|vouring fire?</P>
<P N="2">2. The place or &s;tate of torment, is purpo&s;ely or|dained for the glorifying GOD's ju&s;tice. As all the works of GOD are great and wonderful, &s;o tho&s;e above all, which are &s;pecially intended for the eminent ad|vancing of &s;ome of his attributes. When he will glo|rify his power, he makes the worlds. The comely order of all, and &s;ingular creatures, declare his wi&s;|dom. His providence is &s;hewn, in &s;u&s;taining all things and maintaining order, and attending his ex|cellet ends, among&s;t the confu&s;ed, perver&s;e, tumultu|ous agitations of a world of wicked, fooli&s;h &s;elf-de|&s;troying mi&s;creants. When a &s;park of his wrath doth kindle upon the earth, the whole world, &s;ave only eight per&s;ons, are drowned, <HI>Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah</HI> and <HI>Zeboim,</HI> are burnt with fire from heaven to a&s;hes. The &s;ea &s;huts her mouth upon &s;ome. The earth doth open and &s;wallow others. The pe&s;tilence de&s;troyeth them by thou&s;ands. The pre&s;ent deplorable &s;tate of the Jews may fully te&s;tify this to the world. And yet the glorifying of the two great attributes, of mer|cy and ju&s;tice, is intended mo&s;t eminently for the life
<PB N="115" REF="022331_0114_0FB7F287664E6198">to come. As therefore when GOD will purpo&s;ely glo|rify his mercy, he will do it in a way that is now be|yond the comprehen&s;ion of the &s;aints that mu&s;t enjoy it; &s;o that the blood of his Son, and the enjoyment of him&s;elf immediately in glory, &s;hall not be thought too high an honour for them: &s;o al&s;o, when the time comes that he will purpo&s;ely manife&s;t his ju&s;tice, it &s;hall appear to be indeed the ju&s;tice of GOD. The everla&s;ting flames of hell will not be thought too hot for the rebellious; and when they have there burned through millions of ages, he will not repent him of the evil which is befallen them. Oh, wo to the &s;oul that is thus &s;et up for a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t, for the wrath of the Al|mighty to &s;hoot at! and for a bu&s;h that mu&s;t burn in the flames of his jealou&s;ly, and never be con&s;umed!</P>
<P N="3">3. Con&s;ider who &s;hall be GOD's executioners of their torment; and that is, fir&s;t, <HI>Satan.</HI> Secondly, them&s;elves. Fir&s;t, he that was here &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in drawing them from <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> will then be the in&s;trument of their puni&s;hment, for yielding to his temptations. It was a pityful fight to &s;ee the man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, that was bound with chains, and lived among tombs; and that other that would be ca&s;t into the fire and into the wa|ter; but alas! that was nothing to the torment that <HI>Satan</HI> puts them to in hell: that is the reward he will give them for all their &s;ervice; for their rejecting the commands of GOD, and for&s;aking <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and neglect|ing their &s;ouls at his per&s;ua&s;ion. Ah, if they had &s;erved <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as faithfully as they did <HI>Satan,</HI> he would have given them a better reward. 2. And it is mo&s;t ju&s;t al&s;o, that they &s;hould there be their own torment|ers, that they may &s;ee that their whole de&s;truction is of them&s;elves; and they who were wilfully the meri|torious cau&s;e, &s;hould al&s;o be the efficient in their own &s;ufferings; and then who can they complain of but them&s;elves?</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="116" REF="022331_0115_0FB7F289CB1134C8">
4. Con&s;ider al&s;o that their torment will be univer|&s;al, not upon one part alone, while the re&s;t are free; but as all have joined in the &s;in, &s;o mu&s;t all partake of the torment. The &s;oul, as it was the chief in &s;inning, &s;hall be the chief in &s;uffering; and as it is of a more &s;piritual and excellent nature than bodies are, &s;o will its torments far exceed bodily &s;ufferings. And as the joys of the &s;oul far &s;urpa&s;s all &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, &s;o the pains of the &s;oul &s;urpa&s;s corporal pains.</P>
<P>And it is not only a &s;oul, but a &s;inful &s;oul that mu&s;t &s;uffer: the guilt which &s;till remains upon it, will make it fit for the wrath of GOD to work upon: as fire will not burn, except the fuel be combu&s;tible; but if the wood be dry, how fiercely will it burn then! The guilt of their &s;ins will be as tinder to gunpowder to the damned &s;oul, to make the flames of hell take hold up|on them with fury.</P>
<P>And as the &s;oul, &s;o al&s;o the body mu&s;t bear its part. That body that mu&s;t needs be plea&s;ed, what&s;oever be|came of its eternal &s;afety, &s;hall now be paid for its unlawful plea&s;ures. That body which was &s;o care|fully looked to, &s;o tenderly cheri&s;hed&mdash;That body which could not endure heat or cold, or an ill &s;mell, or a loath&s;ome &s;ight: Oh what mu&s;t it now endure! how are its haughty looks now taken down! how lit|tle will tho&s;e flames regard its comeline&s;s and beauty! but as death did not regard it, nor the worms regard it, but as freely feed upon the face of the proud and lu&s;tful dames, and the heart of the mo&s;t ambitious lords or princes, as if they had been but beggars; &s;o will their tormenters then as little pity their tender|ne&s;s, or reverence their lordline&s;s. Tho&s;e eyes which were wont to be delighted with curious &s;ights, mu&s;t then &s;ee nothing, but what &s;hall amaze and terrify them; an angry GOD above them, and tho&s;e &s;aints whom they &s;corned, enjoying the glory which they have
<PB N="117" REF="022331_0116_0FB7F28C1438B648">lo&s;t; and about them will be only devils and damned &s;ouls; ah! then how &s;adly will they look back and &s;ay, are all our fea&s;ts, our games and revels come to this! Then tho&s;e ears which were wont to be delighted with mu&s;ic, &s;hall hear the &s;hrieks and cries of their damned companions; children crying out again&s;t their parents, that gave them encouragement and example in evil; hu&s;bands crying out upon their wives, and wives upon their hu&s;bands; ma&s;ters and &s;ervants cur&s;ing each other; mini&s;ters and people; magi&s;trates and &s;ubjects, charging their mi&s;ery upon one ano|ther, for di&s;couraging in duty, conniving at &s;in, and being &s;ilent or formal when they &s;hould have plainly told one another of their mi&s;ery, and fore-warned them of their danger. Thus will &s;oul and body be compa|nions in calamity.</P>
<P N="5">5. And the greater by far will their torments be, becau&s;e they &s;hall have no comfort le&s;t to mitigate them. In this life when a mini&s;ter told them of hell, or con&s;cience began to trouble their peace, they had comforts enough at hand to relieve them: their carnal friends were all ready to comfort them, but now they have not a word of comfort either for him or them|&s;elves. Formerly they had their bu&s;ine&s;s, their com|pany, their mirth, to drive away their fears; they could drink away their &s;orrows, or play them away, or &s;leep them away, or at lea&s;t, time did wear them away; but now all the&s;e remedies are vani&s;hed. They had a hard, a pre&s;umptuous unbelieving heart, which was a wall to defend them again&s;t troubles of mind; but now their experience bath bani&s;hed the&s;e, and le&s;t them naked to the fury of tho&s;e flames. Yea, for|merly <HI>Satan</HI> him&s;elf was their comforter, and would un&s;ay all that the mini&s;ter &s;aid again&s;t them, as he did to our fir&s;t mother. <HI>Hath</HI> GOD <HI>&s;aid, Ye &s;hall not eal? Ye &s;hall not &s;urely die.</HI> So doth he now: doth GOD tell you that you &s;hall lie in hell? it is no &s;uch mat|ter;
<PB N="118" REF="022331_0117_0FB7F28D5BA99AA0">GOD is more merciful: he doth but tell you &s;o to fright you from &s;inning: or if there be a hell, what need you fear it? are not you chri&s;tians? and &s;hall you not be &s;aved by <HI>Chri&s;t?</HI> was not his blood &s;hed for you? Mini&s;ters may tell you what they plea&s;e, they would make men believe that they &s;hall all be damned except they will fit them&s;elves to their humour.&mdash;Thus as the Spirit of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is the comforter of the &s;aints, &s;o <HI>Satan</HI> is the comforter of the wicked; for he knows if he &s;hould now di&s;quiet them, they would no longer &s;erve him; or if fears or doubts &s;hould trouble them, they would bethink them&s;elves of their danger. Ne|ver was a thief more careful le&s;t he &s;hould awake the people, when he is robbing the hou&s;e, than <HI>Satan</HI> is, not to awaken a &s;inner. But when the &s;inner is dead, and he hath his prey, then he hath done flattering and comforting them. While the &s;ight of &s;in and mi&s;ery might have helped to &s;ave them, he took all the pains he could to hide it from their eyes; but when it is too late, and there is no hope left, he will make them &s;ee and feel to the utmo&s;t. Oh, which way will the for|lorn &s;inner then look for comfort! They that drew him into the &s;nare, and promi&s;ed him &s;afety, now for|&s;ake him, and are for&s;aken them&s;elves. His ancient comforts are taken from him, and the righteous GOD, who&s;e fore-warning he made light of, will now make good his word again&s;t him to the lea&s;t tittle.</P>
<P N="6">6. But the great aggravation of this mi&s;ery, will be its eternity. That when a thou&s;and millions of ages are pa&s;t, their torments are as fre&s;h to begin as at the fir&s;t day. If there were any hope of an end, it would ea&s;e them to fore&s;ee it; but when it mu&s;t be for-ever &s;o, that thought is intolerable: much more will the mi&s;ery it&s;elf be. They never heartily repent|ed of their &s;in, and GOD will never repent him of their &s;uffering. They broke the laws of the eternal GOD, and therefore &s;hall &s;uffer eternal puni&s;hment.
<PB N="119" REF="022331_0118_0FB7F28F2E8F3468">They knew it was an everla&s;ting kingdom which they refu&s;ed; and therefore what wonder if they be ever|la&s;tingly &s;hut out of it? It was their immortal &s;ouls that were guilty of the tre&s;pa&s;s, and therefore mu&s;t immortally &s;uffer the pains. What happy men would they think them&s;elves, if they might have lain &s;till in their graves, or continued du&s;t, or &s;uffered no wor&s;e than the gnawing of tho&s;e worms! Oh that they might but there lie down again! What a mercy now would it be to die? And how will they call and cry out for it? Oh death! whither art thou gone? Now come and cut off this doleful life. O that the&s;e pains would break my heart, and end my being! O that I might once die at la&s;t! O that I had never had a being!&mdash; The&s;e groans will the thoughts of eternity wring from their hearts. They were wont to think the &s;ermon long, and prayer long; how long then will they think the&s;e endle&s;s torments? What difference is there be|twixt the length of their plea&s;ures and of their pains? The one continued but a moment, the other endureth through all eternity. Oh that &s;inners would lay this thought to heart! Remember how time is almo&s;t gone. Thou art &s;tanding all this while at the door of eternity; and death is waiting to open the door, and put thee in. Go &s;leep out but a few more nights, and &s;tir up and down on earth a few more days, and then thy nights and days &s;hall end; thy thoughts, and cares, and plea&s;ures, and all &s;hall be devoured by eternity; thou mu&s;t enter upon the &s;tate which &s;hall never be changed. As the joys of heaven are beyond our conceiving, &s;o al&s;o are the pains of hell. Everla&s;ting torment is inconceivable torment.</P>
<P>But methinks I perceive the ob&s;tinate &s;inner de&s;pe|rately re&s;olving, if I mu&s;t be damned, there is no re|medy; rather than I will live &s;o preci&s;ely, I will put it to the venture; I &s;hall e&s;cape as well as the re&s;t of my neighbours, and we will even bear it as well as
<PB N="120" REF="022331_0119_0FB7F293454F6000">we can.&mdash;Alas, poor creature! would thou did&s;t but know what it is that hou do&s;t &s;o boldly venture on: I dare &s;ay thou would&s;t &s;leep this night but very unquietly. Wilt thou leave thy&s;elf no room for hope? Art thou &s;uch an implacable enemy to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and thy own &s;oul? And do&s;t thou think indeed, that thou can&s;t bear the wrath of GOD, and go away &s;o ea&s;ily with the&s;e eternal torments? Yet let me beg this of thee, that before thou do&s;t &s;o flatly re&s;olve, thou would&s;t lend thine attention to the&s;e few que&s;tions.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Who art thou that thou &s;hould&s;t bear the wrath of GOD? Art thou a God; or art thou a man? What is thy &s;trength to undergo &s;o much? is it not as the &s;trength of wax or &s;tubble to re&s;i&s;t the fire? or as chaff to the wind; or as du&s;t before the whirlwind? Was he not as &s;tout a man as thy&s;elf, who cried to GOD, <HI>Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? And wilt thou pur&s;ue the dry &s;tubble?</HI> If thy &s;trength were as iron, and thy bones as bra&s;s, thou could&s;t not bear. If thy foundation were as the earth, and thy power as the heavens, yet &s;hould&s;t thou peri&s;h at the breath of his indignation. How much more when thou art but a little, creeping, breathing clay, kept a few days from &s;tinking, and from being eaten with worms, by the mere &s;upport and favour of him whom then thus re&s;i&s;te&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> If thou be &s;o &s;trong, and thy heart &s;o &s;tout, why do tho&s;e &s;mall &s;ufferings &s;o di&s;may thee? If thou have but a &s;it of the gout or &s;tone, what groans do&s;t thou utter? The hou&s;e is filled with thy complaints. If thou &s;hould&s;t but lo&s;e a leg or an arm, thou would&s;t make a great matter of it. If thou lo&s;e thine e&s;tate, and fall into poverty and di&s;grace; how heavily would&s;t thou bear any one of the&s;e? And yet all the&s;e laid together, will be one day accounted a happy &s;tate, in compari&s;on of that which is &s;uffered
<PB N="121" REF="022331_0120_0FB7F29918DA07B0">in hell. Let me &s;ee thee make as light of convul&s;ive, gouty, rheumatic pains, when they &s;eize upon thee, and then the &s;trength of thy &s;pirit will appear.

And when GOD hath but let out a little of his wrath, that <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> who be|fore a&s;ked, <HI>Who is the Lord?</HI> hath cried, <HI>I have &s;inned.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> If all this be nothing, go try thy &s;trength by &s;ome corporal torment; as <HI>Bilney</HI> before he went to the &s;take, would fir&s;t try his finger in the candle; &s;o do thou: hold thy &s;inger awhile in the fire, and feel there whether thou can&s;t endure the fire of hell. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> mentioneth a cha&s;te chri&s;tian woman, who be|ing tempted to uncleanne&s;s by a lewd ruffian, &s;he de|&s;ired him for her &s;ake to hold his finger one hour in the &s;ire; he an&s;wered, it is an unrea&s;onable reque&s;t: how much more unrea&s;onable is it (&s;aid &s;he) that I &s;hould burn in hell for the &s;atisfying your lu&s;t? So &s;ay I to thee; if it be an intolerable thing to &s;uffer the heat of the are for a year, or a day, or an hour, what will it be to &s;uffer ten thou&s;and times more for ever? What if thou wert to &s;uffer <HI>Lawrence</HI>'s death, to be roa&s;ted upon a grid-iron; or to be &s;craped or pricked to death, as other martyrs were? If thou could&s;t not endure &s;uch things as the&s;e, how wilt thou endure the eternal flames?</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> If thou be &s;o fearle&s;s of that eternal mi|&s;ery, why is the lea&s;t foreta&s;te of it &s;o terrible? Did&s;t thou never feel &s;uch a thing as tormenting con&s;ci|ence?

<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Let me a&s;k thee, if the wrath of GOD be to be made &s;o light of, why did the Son of GOD him&s;elf make &s;o great a matter of it?

<P>There are few preachers &s;o &s;imple, but they know that this kind of preaching is the ready way to be
<PB N="124" REF="022331_0123_0FB7F29F58C723C0">hated of their hearers: and the de&s;ire of the &s;avour of men is &s;o natural, that few delight in &s;uch a di&s;|plea&s;ing way. But I be&s;eech thee con&s;ider, are the&s;e things true, or are they not? If they were not true, I would heartily join with thee again&s;t any mini&s;ter that &s;hould offer to preach them, and to affright poor people when there is no cau&s;e. But if the&s;e threat|enings be the words of GOD, what a wretch art thou that would&s;t not hear it, or con&s;ider it. Why, what is the matter? If thou be &s;ure that thou art one of the people of GOD, this doctrine will be a comfort to thee: but if thou be yet unregenerate, methinks thou &s;hould&s;t be as fearful to hear of heaven as of hell, except the bare name of heaven or &s;alvation be &s;ufficient. Sure there is no doctrine concerning hea|ven in all the &s;cripture that can give thee any com|fort, but upon the &s;uppo&s;al of thy conver&s;ion; what comfort is it to thee, to hear that there is a re&s;t remain|ing to the people of GOD, except thou be one of them? Nay, what more terrible, than to read of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and &s;al|vation for others, when thou mu&s;t be &s;hut out? There|fore, except thou would&s;t have a mini&s;ter to preach a lie, it is all one to thee, for any comfort thou ha&s;t in it, whether he preach of heaven or hell to thee. His preaching heaven and mercy to thee, can be no|thing el&s;e but to intreat thee to &s;eek them; but he can make thee no promi&s;e of it, but upon condition of thy obeying the go&s;pel; and his preaching hell, is but to per&s;uade thee to avoid it. And is not this doctrine fit for thee to hear? Indeed if thou wert quite pa&s;t hope of e&s;caping it, then it were in vain to tell thee of hell, but rather let thee take a few mer|ry hours whil&s;t thou may&s;t; but as long as thou art alive, there is hope of thy recovery, and therefore all means mu&s;t be u&s;ed to awake thee from thy le|thargy.</P>

Oh that &s;ome &s;on of thunder, who could &s;peak as <HI>Paul,</HI> till the hearers tremble, were now to preach this doctrine to thee!

What in&s;atiable pur&s;uit of fle&s;hly plea&s;ures, whil&s;t they look upon the prai&s;es of GOD, which is the joy of angels, as a burden! What unwearied diligence is there in rai&s;ing their po&s;terity, enlarging their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, gathering a little &s;ilver or gold?

How early do they rou&s;e up their &s;ervants to their labour? [Up, come away to work, we have this to do, and that to do;] but how &s;eldom do they call them [Up, you have your &s;oul to look to, you have everla&s;ting life to provide for; up to prayer, to the reading of the &s;cripture.]</P>
<P>What a gadding up and down the world is here, like a company of ants upon a hillock, taking ince&s;|&s;ant pains to gather a trea&s;ure, which death will &s;purn abroad, as if it were &s;uch an excellent thing to die in the mid&s;t of wealth and honours! Or as if it would be &s;uch a comfort to a man in another world, to think that he was a lord, or a knight, or a gentleman, or a rich man on earth! What hath this world done for its lovers and friends, that it is &s;o eagerly followed, and painfully &s;ought after, while <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and heaven &s;tand by, and few regard them? Or what will the world do for them for the time to come? The com|mon entrance into it is through angui&s;h and &s;orrrow. The pa&s;&s;age through it is with continual care and la|bour. The pa&s;&s;age out of it is with the greate&s;t &s;harp|ne&s;s and &s;adne&s;s of all. What then doth cau&s;e men &s;o much to follow and affect it? O unrea&s;onable bewitch|ed men! Will mirth and plea&s;ure &s;tick clo&s;e to you? Will gold and worldly glory prove fa&s;t friends to you in the time of your greate&s;t need? Will they hear your cries in the day of your calamity?

Why then did &s;o rich a man want a drop of water to cool his tongue? Or are the &s;weet mor&s;els of pre&s;ent delight and honour of more worth than eternal re&s;t? and will they recompen&s;e the lo&s;s of that enduring trea&s;ure?

Is it only a room for our dead bodies that we are &s;o much beholden to the world for? Why this is the la&s;t and longe&s;t courte&s;y that we &s;hall receive from it. But we &s;hall have this whether we &s;erve it or no; and even that homely, du&s;ty dwel|ling it will not afford us always neither; it &s;hall po&s;|&s;e&s;s our du&s;t but till the re&s;urrection. How then doth the world de&s;erve &s;o well at men's hands, that they &s;hould part with <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and their &s;alvation to be its fol|lowers?

And yet &s;ucceeding &s;inners will take no warning.</P>
<P>So this is the fir&s;t &s;ort of neglecters of heaven which fall under this reproof.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;econd &s;ort here to be reproved, are the profane, ungodly, pre&s;umptuous multitude, who will not be per&s;uaded to be at &s;o much pains for &s;alvation, as to perform the common outward duties of religion. Yea, though they are convinced that the&s;e duties are commanded, yet will they not be brought to the com|mon practice of them. If they have the go&s;pel preach|ed in the town where they dwell, it may be they will give the hearing to it one part of the day, and &s;tay at home the other; or if the ma&s;ter come to the congre|gation, yet part of his family mu&s;t &s;tay at home. If they want the plain and powerful preaching of the go&s;|pel, how &s;ew are there in a whole town who will tra|vel
<PB N="129" REF="022331_0128_0FB7F2ABA95E4178">a mile or two to hear abroad, though they will go many miles to the market for their bodies.</P>
<P>And though they know the &s;cripture is the law of GOD, by which they mu&s;t be acquitted or condemn|ed in judgment; and that it is the property of every ble&s;&s;ed man to delight i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this law, and to meditate in it day and night, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> they not be at the pains to read a chapter once a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> nor to acquaint their fa|milies with this doctrin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of &s;alvation. But if they carry a bible to church, and let it lie by them all the week, this is the mo&s;t u&s;e that they make of it. And though they are commanded to <HI>pray without cea&s;ing;</HI> and to <HI>pray always and not to faint;</HI> to <HI>continue in pray|er, and watch in the &s;ame with thank&s;giving;</HI> yet will they not pray con&s;tantly with their families, or in &s;e|cret. You may hear in their hou&s;es two oaths for one prayer. Or if they do any thing this way, it is u&s;ually but a running over a few formal words which they have got on their tongues' end, as if they came on purpo&s;e to make a je&s;t of prayer, and to mock GOD and their own &s;ouls.</P>
<P>Alas, he that only reads in a book that he is mi|&s;erable, and what his foul &s;tands in need of, but never felt him&s;elf mi&s;erable, or felt his &s;everal wants, no wonder if be mu&s;t al&s;o fetch his prayer from his book only, or at farthe&s;t from the &s;trength of his memory. <HI>Solomon</HI>'s reque&s;t to GOD was, that <HI>what prayer or &s;up|plication &s;oever &s;hould be made by any man, or by all the people, when every man &s;hall know his own &s;ore, and his own grief, and &s;hall &s;pread &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">is hands before</HI> GOD, <HI>that</HI> GOD <HI>would then hear and forgive,</HI> 2 Chron. vi. 29, 30. If the&s;e men did thus know and feel every man the &s;ore, and the grief of his own &s;oul, we &s;hould neither need &s;o much to urge them to prayer, nor to teach them how to perform it. Whereas now they invite GOD to be backward in giving, by their
<PB N="130" REF="022331_0129_0FB7F2ACDBDF73C8">backwardne&s;s in a&s;king; and to be weary of relieving them by their own being weary of begging; and to be &s;eldom and &s;hort in his favours, as they are in their prayers; and to give them but common and outward favours, as they put up but common and out&s;ide re|que&s;ts. Yea, their cold and heartle&s;s prayers invite GOD to a flat denial: for among men it is taken for granted, that he who a&s;ks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t &s;lightly and &s;eldom, cares not much for what he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ks. Do not the&s;e men judge them&s;elves unworthy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> heaven, who think it not worth their more con&s;tant and earne&s;t reque&s;ts? If it be not worth a&s;king for, it is worth nothing. And yet if one &s;hould go from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, thro' town and pari&s;h, and enquire at every hou&s;e as you go, whether they do morning and evening call their family together, and earne&s;tly &s;eek the LORD in pray|er; how few would you find that con&s;tantly and con|&s;cientiou&s;ly practi&s;e this duty? If every door were marked where they do not thus call upon the name of GOD, that his wrath might be poured out upon that family, our towns would be as places overthrown by the plague, the people being dead within, and the mark of judgment without. I fear where one hou&s;e would e&s;cape, ten would be marked out for death; then they might teach their doors to pray, LORD <HI>have mercy upon us;</HI> becau&s;e the people would not pray them&s;elves. But e&s;pecially if you could &s;ee what men do in their &s;ecret chambers, how few &s;hould you find in a whole town that &s;pend one quarter of an hour, morning and night in earne&s;t &s;upplication to GOD for their &s;ouls? Oh how little do the&s;e men &s;et by eternal re&s;t!</P>
<P>Thus do they &s;lothfully neglect all endeavours for their own welfare, except &s;ome public duty in the congregation, which cu&s;tom or credit doth engage them to. Per&s;uade them to read good books, and they will not be at &s;o much pains. Per&s;uade them to learn
<PB N="131" REF="022331_0130_0FB7F2AFCD575050">the grounds of religion in &s;ome catechi&s;m, and they think it toil&s;ome &s;lavery, fit for &s;chool-boys. Per|&s;uade them to &s;anctify the Lord's-day, and to &s;pend it wholly in hearing the word, and repeating it with their families, and prayer and meditation, and to for|bear all their worldly thoughts and &s;peeches; and what a tedious life do they take this to be; and how long may you preach to them, before they will be brought to it As if they thought heaven were not worth all this ado.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third &s;ort that fall under this reproof, are tho&s;e &s;elf-cozening, formal, lazy profe&s;&s;ors of religi|on, who will be brought to any outward duty, but to the inward work they will never be per&s;uaded. They will preach, or hear, or read, or talk of heaven, or pray cu&s;tomar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly or con&s;tantly in their families, and take part with the per&s;ons and cau&s;es that are good, and de&s;ire to be e&s;teemed among the godly, but you can never bring them to the more &s;piritual duties; as to be con&s;tant and fervent in &s;ecret prayer; to be con&s;cientious in the duty of &s;elf-examination, to be con&s;tant in meditation, to be heavenly-minded, to watch con&s;tantly over their heart, and words and ways, to deny their bodily &s;en&s;es and their delights, to mor|tify the fle&s;h, and not make provi&s;ion for it, to fulfil its lu&s;ts; to love and heartily forgive an enemy, and to prefer their brethren heartily before them&s;elves. The out&s;ide hypocrites will never be per&s;uaded to any of the&s;e. Above all other, two &s;orts there are of the&s;e hypocrites.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The &s;uperficial, opinionative hypocrite.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The worldly hypocrite.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The former entertaineth the doctrine of the go&s;pel with joy; but it is only in the &s;urface of his &s;oul,
<PB N="132" REF="022331_0131_0FB7F2B230562540">he never gives the &s;eed any depth of earth. He changeth his opinion, and thereupon enga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eth for religion, as the right way, but it never melted and new-moulded his heart, nor &s;et up <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> there in full power and authority: as his religion is but opinion, &s;o is his &s;tudy, and conference, and chief bu&s;ine&s;s all about opinion. He is u&s;ually an ignorant, proud, bold enquirer and babler about controver&s;ies, rather than an humble embracer of the known truth, with love and &s;ubjection: you may conjecture by his bold and forward tongue, and conceitedne&s;s in his own opinions, and &s;lighting the judgments and per&s;ons of others, and &s;eldom talking of the great things of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and humitlity&mdash;that his religi|on dwelleth in the brain, and not in his heart; where the wind of temptation a&s;&s;aults him, he ea&s;ily yield|eth, and it carrieth him away as a feather, becau&s;e his heart is empty, and not balanced and e&s;tabli&s;hed with <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and grace. If this man's judgment lead him in the ceremonious way, then doth he employ his chief zeal for ceremonies. If his judgement be again&s;t ce|remonies, then his &s;tronge&s;t zeal is employed in &s;tudy|ing, talking, di&s;puting again&s;t them, and cen&s;uring the u&s;ers of them. For, n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> having the e&s;&s;entials of chri&s;tianity, he hath only the mint and cummin, the &s;maller matters of the law, to lay out his zeal upon. You &s;hall never hear any humble and hearty bewail|ings of his &s;oul's imperfections, or any heart-bleeding acknowledgments of his unkindne&s;&s;es to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> of any pantings and longings after him, from this man; but that he is of &s;uch a judgment, or &s;uch a religion, or &s;ociety, or a member of &s;uch a church: herein doth he gather his greate&s;t comforts; but the inward and &s;piritual labours of a chri&s;tian he will not be brought to.</P>
<P>The like may be &s;aid of the worldly hypocrite, who choaketh the doctrine of the go&s;pel with the
<PB N="133" REF="022331_0132_0FB7F2B986957C60">thorns of worldly cares and de&s;ires. His judgment is convinced that he mu&s;t be religious, or he cannot be &s;aved; and therefore he reads, and hears, and prays, and for&s;akes his former company and cour&s;es; but becau&s;e his belief of the go&s;pel-doctrine is but waver|ing and &s;hallow, he re&s;olves to keep his hold of pre|&s;ent things; and yet to be religious, that &s;o he may have heaven, when he can keep the world no longer. This man's judgment may &s;ay, GOD is the chief good, but his heart and affections never &s;aid &s;o, but looked upon GOD as to be tolerated rather than the flames of hell, but not de&s;ired before the felicity on earth. In a word, the world hath more of his affections than GOD, and therefore is his god. This he might ea&s;ily know and feel, if he would judge impartially, and were but faithful to him&s;elf. And though this man does not gad after novelties in religion, as the former, yet will he &s;et his &s;ails to the wind of worldly advan|tage. And as a man who&s;e &s;pirits are &s;eized on by &s;ome pe&s;tilential malignity, is feeble and faint, and heartle&s;s in all that he does; &s;o this man's &s;pirits be|ing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the plague of this malignant, world|ly di&s;po&s;ition, how faint is he in &s;ecret prayer! How &s;uperficial in examination and meditation! How fee|ble in heart-watchings, and humbling, mortifying endeavours! How nothing at all in loving and walk|ing with GOD, rejoicing in him, or de&s;iring him! So that both the&s;e, and many other &s;orts of lazy hy|pocrites there are, who though they will trudge on with you in the ea&s;y out&s;ide of religion, yet will never be at the pains of inward and &s;piritual duties.</P>
<P N="4">4. And even good men them&s;elves de&s;erve this re|proof, for being too lazy &s;eekers of everla&s;ting re&s;t. Alas, what a di&s;proportion is there between our light and our heat! our profe&s;&s;ions and pro&s;ecution! Who makes that ha&s;te, as if it were for heaven? How &s;till we &s;tand! How idly we work! How we talk, and
<PB N="134" REF="022331_0133_0FB7F2BE9FAD96B0">je&s;t, and trifle away our time! How deceitfully we do the work of GOD! How we hear, as if we heard not; and pray, as if we prayed not; and confer, and examine, and meditate, and reprove &s;in, as if we did it not; and u&s;e the ordinances, as if we u&s;ed them not; and enjoy <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as if we enjoyed him not; as if we had learned to u&s;e the things of heaven, as the apo&s;tle teacheth us to u&s;e the world! Who would think that &s;tood by us, and heard us pray in private or public, that we were praying for no le&s;s than ever|la&s;ting glory? Should heaven be &s;ought no more ear|ne&s;tly than thus? Methinks we are none of us all in good &s;adne&s;s for our &s;ouls. We do but dally with the work of GOD, and play with <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as children play with their meat when they &s;hould eat it; we hang upon ordinances from day to day, but we &s;tir not our|&s;elves to &s;eek the LORD.</P>
<P>I &s;ee a great many very con&s;tant in hearing and praying, but they do not hear and pray as if it were for their lives. Oh, what a frozen &s;tupidity hath be|numbed us! The plague of <HI>Lot</HI>'s wife is upon us, as if we were changed into lifele&s;s and immoveable pil|lars: we are dying, and we know it, and yet we &s;tir not; we are at the door of eternal happine&s;s or mi|&s;ery, and yet we perceive it not: death knocks, and we hear it not: <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> calls and knocks, and we hear not: GOD cries to us, <HI>to-day if you will hear my voice, harden not your hearts. Work while it is day, for the night cometh when none can work.</HI> Now ply your bu|&s;ine&s;s, now labour for your lives; now lay out all your &s;trength. Now or never; and yet we &s;tir no more than if we were half a&s;leep. What ha&s;te do death and judgment make! How fa&s;t do they come on! They are almo&s;t at us, and yet what little ha&s;te make we! The &s;pur of GOD is in our &s;ide, we bleed, we groan, and yet we do not mend our pace. LORD, what a &s;en&s;ele&s;s, &s;otti&s;h, earthly, helli&s;h thing is a hard heart!
<PB N="135" REF="022331_0134_0FB7F2C1AF1DF748">That we will not go roundly and cheerfully toward heaven without all this ado! No, nor with it neither?

<P>To be plain with you, I think nothing undoes men &s;o much as complimenting and je&s;ting in religion. Oh, if I were not &s;ick my&s;elf of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, with what tears &s;hould I mix this ink; and with what groans &s;hould I expre&s;s the&s;e &s;ad complaints; and with what heart's grief &s;hould I mourn over this univer&s;al deadne&s;s! Do the magi&s;trates among us &s;eriou&s;ly per|form their portion of the work? are they zealous for Gon? do they build up his hou&s;e? are they tender of his honour? do they &s;econd the word? encourage the good? relieve the oppre&s;&s;ed? compa&s;&s;ionate the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed? and fly at the face of &s;in and &s;inners, as being the di&s;turbers of our peace, and the only cau&s;e of all our mi&s;eries? do they &s;tudy how to do the ut|mo&s;t they can for GOD? to improve their power and parts, and wealth and honour, and all their intere&s;t for the greate&s;t advantage to the kingdom of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as men that mu&s;t &s;hortly give an account of their &s;teward&s;hip? Or do they build their own hou&s;es, and &s;eek their advancements, and conte&s;t for their own ho|nours, and do no more for <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> than needs they mu&s;t, or than lies in their way, or than is put by others into their hands, or than &s;tands with the plea&s;ing of their friends, or with their worldly intere&s;t?</P>
<P>And how thin are tho&s;e mini&s;ters that are &s;erious in their work! Nay, how mightily do the very be&s;t fail in this! Do we cry out of men's di&s;obedience to the go&s;pel, in the evidence and power of the Spirit, and deal with &s;in, as that which is the fire in our towns
<PB N="136" REF="022331_0135_0FB7F2C2F5A8F428">and hou&s;es; and by force pull men out of this fire? Do we per&s;uade our people, as tho&s;e that know the terrors of the LORD &s;hould do? Do we pre&s;s <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and regeneration, and faith, and holine&s;s, as men that believe indeed, that without the&s;e they &s;hall never have life? Do our bowels yearn over the ignorant, and the carele&s;s, and the ob&s;tinate multitude, as men that believe their own doctrine? When we look them in the face, do our hearts melt over them, le&s;t we &s;hould never &s;ee their faces in re&s;t? Do we, as <HI>Paul,</HI> tell them weeping, of their fle&s;hly and earthly di&s;po|&s;ition? And teach them publicly, and from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, night and day with tears? And do we entreat them, as if it were indeed for their lives? That when we &s;peak of the joys and mi&s;eries of another world, our people may &s;ee us affected accordingly, and per|ceive that we mean as we &s;peak? Or rather, do we not &s;tudy words? As if a mini&s;ter's bu&s;ine&s;s were but to tell them a &s;mooth tale of an hour long, and &s;o look no more after them till the next &s;ermon.</P>
<P>Oh the formal, frozen, lifele&s;s &s;ermons which we daily hear preached upon the mo&s;t weighty, piercing &s;ubjects in the world! How gently do we handle tho&s;e &s;ins, which will handle &s;o cruelly our people's &s;ouls! And how tenderly do we deal with their carele&s;s hearts, not &s;peaking to them as men that mu&s;t be awakened or damned! We tell them of heaven and hell in &s;uch a &s;leepy tone, and &s;light way, as if we were but act|ing a part in a play; &s;o that we u&s;ually preach our people a&s;leep with tho&s;e &s;ubjects, which one would think &s;hould rather endanger the driving &s;ome be&s;ide them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In a word, our want of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s about the things of heaven, doth charm the &s;ouls of men into forma|lity, and hath brought them to this cu&s;tomary, care|le&s;s hearing, which undoes them. The LORD par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on

<P>I HOPE, reader, by this time thou art &s;omewhat &s;en&s;ible, what a de&s;perate thing it is to tri&s;te about eternal re&s;t; and how deeply thou ha&s;t been guil|ty of this thy&s;elf.

O fall to work then &s;peedily, and &s;e|riou&s;ly, and ble&s;s GOD that thou ha&s;t yet time to do it: and though that which is pa&s;t cannot be recalled, yet redeem the time now by doubling thy diligence.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e thou &s;halt &s;ee I urge thee not without cau&s;e, I will here adjoin a multitude of con&s;iderati|ons to move thee: their intent and u&s;e is, to drive thee from delaying, and from loitering in &s;eeking re&s;t.

<P N="1">1. Con&s;ider, our affections and actions &s;hould be an&s;werable to the greatne&s;s of the ends to which they are intended. Now the ends of a chri&s;tian's de&s;ires and endeavours are &s;o great, that no human under|&s;tanding on earth can comprehend them; whether you re&s;pect their proper excellency, their exceeding im|portance, or their ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>The&s;e ends are, the glorifying of GOD, the &s;alva|tion of our own and other men's &s;ouls, in e&s;caping the
<PB N="140" REF="022331_0139_0FB7F2C8987AD880">torments of hell, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the glory of heaven. And can a man be too much affected with things of &s;uch moment? Can he de&s;ire them too earne&s;tly, or love them too violently, or labour for them too dili|gently? When we know that if our prayers prevail not, and our labour &s;ucceeds not, we are undone for ever, I think it concerns us to &s;eek and labour to the purpo&s;e. When it is put to the que&s;tion, whether we &s;hall live for ever in heaven or in hell? and the que&s;ti|on mu&s;t be re&s;olved upon our obeying the go&s;pel, or di&s;obeying it, upon the painfulne&s;s or the &s;lothful|ne&s;s of our pre&s;ent endeavours; I think it is time for us to be&s;tir our&s;elves, and to leave our tri&s;ling and complimenting with GOD.</P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider, our diligence &s;hould be an&s;werable to the greatne&s;s of the work which we have to do, as well as to the ends of it.</P>
<P>Now, the works of a chri&s;tian here are very many, and very great: the &s;oul mu&s;t be renewed; many and great corruptions mortified; cu&s;tom, temptations and worldly intere&s;t mu&s;t be conquered; fle&s;h mu&s;t be ma&s;tered; life and friends, and credit, and all mu&s;t be &s;lighted; con&s;cience mu&s;t be upon good grounds qui|eted; a&s;&s;urance of pardon and &s;alvation mu&s;t be at|tained. And though it is GOD that mu&s;t give us the&s;e, and that freely, without our own merits; yet will he not give them without our earne&s;t &s;eeking and labour.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, there is a deal of knowledge to be got, for the guiding our&s;elves, for defending the truth, for the direction of others, and a deal of &s;kill for the right managing of our parts: many ordinances are to be u&s;ed, and duties to be performed, ordinary and ex|traordinary; every age, and year, and day, doth re|quire fre&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of duty; every place we come
<PB N="141" REF="022331_0140_0FB7F2CBA40661B0">in, every per&s;on we have to deal with, every change of our condition, doth &s;till require the renewing our labour, and bringing duty along with it: wives, children, &s;ervants, neighbours, friends, enemies, all of them call for duty from us. and all this of great importance too; &s;o that for the mo&s;t, if we mi&s;carry in it, it would prove our undoing.</P>
<P>Judge then your&s;elves, whether men that have &s;o much bu&s;ine&s;s lying upon their hands, &s;hould not be|&s;tir them? And whether it be their wi&s;dom either to delay, or to loiter?</P>
<P N="3">3. Con&s;ider, our diligence &s;hould be quickened, be|cau&s;e of the &s;hortne&s;s and uncertainty of the time allot|ted us for the performing of all this work, and the many and great impediments which we meet with. Yet a few days, and we &s;hall be here no more. Time pa&s;|&s;eth on: many di&s;ea&s;es are ready to a&s;&s;ault us; we that now are preaching, and hearing, and talking, and walking, mu&s;t very &s;hortly be carried, and laid in the du&s;t, and there left to the worms in darkne&s;s and cor|ruption; we are almo&s;t there already; it is but a few days, or months, or years, and what is that when once they are pa&s;t? We know not whether we &s;hall have another &s;ermon, or &s;abbath, or hour. How then &s;hould tho&s;e be&s;tir them for their everla&s;ting re&s;t, who know they have &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace for &s;o great a work? Be&s;ides, every &s;tep in the way hath its difficulties; <HI>the gate is &s;trait, and the way narrow: the righteous them|&s;elves are &s;carcely &s;aved.</HI> Scandals and di&s;couragements will be &s;till ca&s;t before us; and can all the&s;e be over|come by &s;lothful endeavours?</P>
<P N="4">4. Moreover, our diligence &s;hould be an&s;werable to the diligence of our enemies in &s;eeking our de&s;tructi|on. For if we &s;it &s;till while they are plotting and la|bouring; or if we be lazy in our defence, while they
<PB N="142" REF="022331_0141_0FB7F2CD077B0618">are diligent in a&s;&s;aulting us, you may ea&s;ily conceive how we are likely to &s;peed. How diligent is <HI>Satan</HI> in all kinds of temptations? Therefore, <HI>be &s;ober and vigi|lant, becau&s;e your adver&s;ary, the devil, as a roaring lion walketh about, &s;eeking whom he may devour.</HI> How diligent are all the mini&s;ters of <HI>Satan?</HI> Fal&s;e teach|ers, &s;corners at godline&s;s, malicious per&s;ecutors, all unwearied; and our inward corruption the mo&s;t bu&s;y and diligent of all: whatever we are about; it is &s;till refi&s;ting us; depraving our duties, perverting our thoughts, dulling our affections to good, exciting them to evil: and will a feeble re&s;i&s;tance &s;erve our turn? Should we not be more active for our own pre|&s;ervation, than our enemies for our ruin?</P>
<P N="5">5. Our affections and endeavours &s;hould bear &s;ome proportion with the talents we have received, and means we have enjoyed.</P>
<P>It may well be expected that a hor&s;eman &s;hould go fa&s;ter than a footman; and he that hath a &s;wift hor&s;e, fa&s;ter than he that hath a &s;low one. More work will be expected from a &s;ound man, than from the fick; and from a man at age, than from a child: and to whom men commit much, from them they will ex|pect the more.</P>
<P>Now the talents which we have received are many and great: the means which we have enjoyed are ve|ry many, and very precious. What people breathing on earth, have had plainer in&s;tructions, or more forci|ble per&s;ua&s;ions, or con&s;tant admonitions, in &s;ea&s;on and out of &s;ea&s;on? Sermons, till we have been weary of them: and &s;abbaths, till we profaned them! Excel|lent books in &s;uch plenty, that we knew not which to read! What people have had GOD &s;o near them as we have had? Or have &s;een <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as it were, cruci|fied before their eyes, as we have done? What people
<PB N="143" REF="022331_0142_0FB7F2D0065F31F0">have had heaven and hell, as it were, opened unto them, as we? Scarce a day wherein we have not had &s;ome &s;pur to put us on. What &s;peed then &s;hould &s;uch a people make for heaven? How &s;hould they fly that are thus winged? And how &s;wiftly &s;hould they &s;ail that have wind and tide to help them? Believe it, brethren, GOD looks for more from <HI>England,</HI> than from mo&s;t nations in the world; and for more from you that enjoy the&s;e helps, than from the dark un|taught congregations of the land. A &s;mall mea&s;ure of grace be&s;eems not &s;uch a people; nor will an ordi|nary diligence in the work of GOD, excu&s;e them.</P>
<P N="6">6. vigour of our affections and actions &s;hould be an&s;werable to the great co&s;t be&s;towed upon us, and to the deep engaging mercies which we have receiv|ed from GOD. Surely we owe more &s;ervice to our ma&s;ter, from whom we have our maintenance, than we do to a &s;tranger, to whom we were never be|holden.</P>
<P>O the co&s;t that GOD hath been at for our &s;akes? The riches of &s;ea and land, of heaven and earth, hath he poured out unto us. All our lives have been filled up with mercies: we cannot look back upon one hour of it, or one pa&s;&s;age in it, but we may behold mercy. We feed upon mercy, we wear mercy upon our backs, we tread upon mercy; mercy within us, mercy without us for this life, and for that to come. O the rate deliverances that we have partaken of, both national and per&s;onal! How oft, how &s;ea&s;ona|bly, how fully have our prayers been heard, and our fears removed? What large catalogues of particular mercies can every chri&s;tian rehear&s;e? To offer to number them would be as endle&s;s a ta&s;k, as to number the &s;tars, or the &s;ands of the &s;hore.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="022331_0143_0FB7F2D42E012D08">
If there be any difference betwixt hell, (where we &s;hould have been) and earth, (where we now are) yea, or heaven, (which is offered to us) then certainly we have received mercy: yea, if the blood of the Son of GOD be mercy, then are we engaged to GOD by mer|cy; for &s;o much did it co&s;t him to recover us to him|&s;elf. And &s;hould a people of &s;uch deep engagements be lazy in their returns? Shall GOD think nothing too much nor too good for us; and &s;hall we think all too much that we do for him? Thou that art an ob|&s;erving &s;en&s;ible man, who knowe&s;t how much thou art beholden to GOD, I appeal to thee, is not a loitering performance of a few heartle&s;s duties, an unworthy requital of &s;uch admirable kindne&s;s? For my own part, when I compare my &s;low and unpro|fitable life, with the frequent and wonderful mercies received, it &s;hames me, it &s;ilenceth me, and leaves me inexcu&s;able.</P>
<P N="7">7. Con&s;ider, all the relations which we &s;tand in toward GOD, call upon us for our utmo&s;t diligence. Should not the pot be wholly at the &s;ervice of the potter, and the creature at the &s;ervice of his Creator? Are we his children, and do we not owe him our mo&s;t tender affections, and dutiful obedience? Are we the &s;pou&s;e of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and do we not owe him our ob&s;ervance, and our love? <HI>If he be our father, where is his honour? and if he be our ma&s;ter, where is his fear? We call him Lord and Ma&s;ter, and we do well:</HI> but if our indu&s;try be not an&s;werable to our relations, we condemn our&s;elves in &s;aying, we are his children, or his &s;ervants. How will the hard labour and daily toil that &s;ervants undergo to plea&s;e their ma&s;ters&punc; judge and condemn tho&s;e men who will not labour &s;o hard for their great ma&s;ter? Surely there is none have a more honourable ma&s;ter than we, nor can expect &s;uch fruit of their labours.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="145" REF="022331_0144_0FB7F2DB48378400">
8. How clo&s;e &s;hould they ply their work, who have &s;uch attendants as we have? All the world are our &s;ervants, that we may be the &s;ervants of GOD. The &s;un, and moon, and &s;tars, attend us with their light and influence: the earth, with all its furniture, is at our &s;ervice: how many thou&s;and plants, and flowers, and fruits, and birds, and bea&s;ts, do all at|tend us? The &s;ea with its inhabitants, the air, the wind, the fro&s;t and &s;now, the heat and fire, the clouds and rain, all wait upon us while we do our work: yea, <HI>the angels are mini&s;tering &s;pirits for us.</HI> And is it not an intolerable crime for us to trifle, while all the&s;e are employed to a&s;&s;i&s;t us? Nay more; the pa|tience of GOD doth wait upon us: the LORD JESUS CHRIST waiteth, in the offers of his blood; the holy Spirit waiteth, in &s;triving with our backward hearts: be&s;ides, all his &s;ervants, the mini&s;ters of his go&s;pel, who &s;tudy and wait, and preach and wait, and pray and wait upon carele&s;s &s;inners: and &s;hall an|gels and men, yea the LORD him&s;elf, &s;tand by and look on, while thou do&s;t nothing?</P>
<P>O chri&s;tians, I be&s;eech you, whenever you are on your knees in prayer, or reproving the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, or exhorting the ob&s;tinate, or upon any duty, do but remember what attendants you have for this work; and then judge how it behoves you to perform it.</P>
<P N="9">9. How forward and painful &s;hould we be in that work, where we are &s;ure we can never do enough? If there were any danger in over-doing, then it might well cau&s;e men to moderate their endeavours: but we know, <HI>that if we could do all, we were but unprofita|ble &s;ervants;</HI> much more when we fail in all.</P>
<P>It is true, a man may po&s;&s;ibly preach too much, or hear too much, (though I have known few that did &s;o) but yet no man can obey or &s;erve GOD too much:
<PB N="146" REF="022331_0145_0FB7F2DF03395140">one duty may be &s;aid to be too long, when it &s;huts out another; and then it cea&s;eth indeed to be a duty.

<P>If the world were not mad with malice, they could never be &s;o blind in this point as they are: to think that diligence for <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> is folly and &s;ingularity: and that they who &s;et them&s;elves wholly to &s;eek eternal life, are but preci&s;e <HI>Puritans!</HI> The time is near, when they will ea&s;ily confe&s;s, that GOD could not be loved or &s;erved too much, and that no man can be too bu&s;y to &s;ave his &s;oul: for the world you may ea&s;ily do too much, but herein (in GOD'S way) you cannot.</P>
<P N="10">10. Con&s;ider, they that trifle in the way to heaven, lo&s;e all their labour. If two be running in a race, he that runs &s;lowe&s;t, had as good never run at all: for he lo&s;eth the prize, and his labour both.

With &s;ome of us our childhood and youth is gone; with &s;ome al&s;o their middle age, and the time before us is very uncertain. What a deal of time have we &s;lept away, and talked away, and played away? What a deal have we &s;pent in worldly thoughts and labours, or in mere idlene&s;s? Though in likelihood the mo&s;t of our time is &s;pent, yet how little of our work is done? And is it not time to be&s;tir our&s;elves in the evening of our days? The time which we ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> lo&s;t can never be recalled; &s;hould we not then redeem it by improving the little which remaineth?

We may &s;ay of all our labours, as <HI>Paul</HI> of his &s;ufferings, <HI>I reckon that the &s;ufferings</HI> (and labours) <HI>of this pre&s;ent time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory that &s;hall be reveal|ed.</HI> We labour but for a moment, but we &s;hall re&s;t for-ever.

<P>Oh, what is the duty and &s;ufferings for a &s;hort life, in re&s;pect of endle&s;s joys with GOD?

<P N="13">13. Con&s;ider, violence and laborious &s;triving for &s;alvation, is the way that the wi&s;dom of GOD hath directed us to, as be&s;t, and his &s;overeign authority appointed us as nece&s;&s;ary. Who knows the way to heaven better than the GOD of heaven? When men tell us that we are too &s;trict, whom do they accu&s;e, GOD, or us? If we do no more than what we are commanded, nor &s;o much neither; they may as well &s;ay, GOD hath made laws which are too &s;trict. Sure if it were a &s;ault, it would lie in him that commands, and not in us who obey. And dare the&s;e men think that they are wi&s;er than GOD? Do they know better than he, what men mu&s;t do to be &s;aved? The&s;e are the men that a&s;k us, whether we are wi&s;er than all the world be&s;ides? and yet they will pretend to be wi&s;er than GOD. What do they le&s;s, when GOD bids us take the mo&s;t diligent cour&s;e, and they tell us, it is more ado than needs? Mark well the language of GOD, and &s;ee how you can reconcile it with the lan|guage

Con&s;cience, when it reprehends ju&s;tly, is the me&s;&s;en|ger of GOD: ungodly revilers are the voice of the devil.

Only as we do by our friends when they are dead; and our words and acti|ons can do them no good, yet to te&s;tify our affections we weep and mourn for them: &s;o will I al&s;o do for the&s;e &s;ouls.

Or had they done for you more than I had done? Try now whether they will &s;ave you, or whether they will recompen&s;e you for the lo&s;s of heaven; or whether they will be as good to you as I would have been? O! what will the wretched &s;inner an&s;wer for any of this!

<P><PB N="163" REF="022331_0162_0FB7F307A139EF88">
Are the&s;e men alive or dead? Are they waking, or a&s;leep? What do they think on? Where are their hearts?

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. I wonder how thou can&s;t either think or &s;peak of the dreadful GOD without exceeding terror and a&s;toni&s;hment, as long as thou art uncertain whether he be thy father or thy enemy, and knowe&s;t not but all his attributes may be employed again&s;t thee.

<ITEM>3. How can&s;t thou open the bible and read a chap|ter, or hear a chapter read but it &s;hould terrify thee? Methinks every leaf &s;hould be to thee as <HI>Bel&s;hazzar</HI>'s writing on the wall, except only that which draws thee to try and reform: If thou read the promi&s;es, thou knowe&s;t not whether ever they &s;hall be fulfilled to thee, becau&s;e thou art uncertain of thy perform|ance of the condition. If thou read the threatenings, for any thing thou knowe&s;t, thou do&s;t read thy own &s;entence. I do not wonder if thou art an enemy to plain preaching, and if thou &s;ay of it, and of the mini&s;ter and &s;cripture it&s;elf, as <HI>Ahab</HI> of the prophet, <HI>I hate him for he doth not prophe&s;y good concerning me, but evil.</HI></ITEM>

Then he will look after the&s;e comforts of life, and not before: for he knows if he mu&s;t die the next day, it will be &s;mall comfort to die rich or honourable. Even when thou lie&s;t down to take thy re&s;t, methinks the uncertainty of thy &s;alvation &s;hould keep thee waking, or amaze thee in thy dreams, and trouble thy &s;leep; and thou &s;hould&s;t &s;ay, as <HI>Job</HI> in a &s;maller di&s;tre&s;s than thine, <HI>Job</HI> vii. 13, 14. <HI>When I &s;ay, my bed &s;hall comfort me,

If the keepers trembled, and became as dead men, when they did but &s;ee the angels, <HI>Matt.</HI> xxviii. 3, 4. how can&s;t thou think of living in hell with devils, till thou ha&s;t got &s;ome &s;ound a&s;&s;urance that thou &s;halt e&s;cape it? Or if thou &s;eldom think of the&s;e things, the wonder is as great, what &s;hift thou make&s;t to keep tho&s;e thoughts from thy heart?

<P>The 2d. thing I promi&s;ed, is, to &s;hew you what are the hinderances which keep men from examination and a&s;&s;urance. I &s;hall,

</LIST></P>
<P>And, 1. we cannot doubt but <HI>Satan</HI> will do his part, to hinder us from &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ary duty as this: if all the power he hath can do it, or all the means and in|&s;truments which he can rai&s;e up. He is loth the god|ly &s;hould have that a&s;&s;urance, and advantage again&s;t corruption, which faithful &s;elf-examination would procure them; and for the ungodly he knows, if they &s;hould once fall clo&s;e to this they would find out his deceits, and their own danger. If they did but faith|fully perform this duty, he were likely to lo&s;e mo&s;t of his &s;ubjects. If the &s;nare be not hid, the bird will e&s;cape it: Satan knows how to angle for &s;ouls, bet|ter than to &s;hew them the hook or line, and to fright them away with a noi&s;e, or with his own appear|ance.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="022331_0169_0FB7F312CC2131B0">
Therefore he labours to keep them from a &s;earch|ing mini&s;try; or to keep the mini&s;ter from helping them to &s;earch: or to take off the edge of the word, that it may not pierce, or to turn away their thoughts, or po&s;&s;e&s;s them with prejudice: Satan is acquainted with all the preparations of the mini&s;ter; he knows when he hath provided a &s;earching &s;ermon, fitted to the &s;tate and nece&s;&s;ity of an hearer; and therefore he will keep him away that day, if it be po&s;&s;ible, or el&s;e ca&s;t him a&s;leep, or &s;teal away the word by the cares and talk of the world, or &s;ome way prevent its ope|ration.</P>
<P>This is the fir&s;t hinderance.</P>
<P>Wicked men al&s;o are great impediments to poor &s;inners when they &s;hould examine and di&s;cover their e&s;tates.</P>
<P N="1">1. Their examples hinder much. When an ignorant &s;inner &s;eeth all his friends and neighbours do as he doth, yea, the rich and learned as well as others, this is an exceeding great temptation to proceed in his &s;ecurity.</P>
<P N="2">2. The merry company, and di&s;cour&s;e of the&s;e men do take away the thoughts of his &s;piritual &s;tate, and make the under&s;tanding drunk: &s;o that if the Spirit had before put into them any jealou&s;y of them|&s;elves, or any purpo&s;e to try them&s;elves, the&s;e do &s;oon quench all.</P>
<P N="3">3. Al&s;o their continual di&s;cour&s;e of matters of the world, doth damp all the&s;e purpo&s;es.</P>
<P N="4">4. Their railings al&s;o, and &s;corning at godly per|&s;ons, is a very great impediment to multitudes of &s;ouls, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth them with &s;uch a prejudice and
<PB N="171" REF="022331_0170_0FB7F3190F0B6120">di&s;like of the way to heaven, that they &s;ettle in the way they are in.</P>
<P N="5">5. Their con&s;tant per&s;ua&s;ions, allurements, threats, hinder much. GOD doth &s;carce ever open the eyes of a poor &s;inner, to &s;ee that his way is wrong, but pre&s;ently there is a multitude of Satan's apo&s;tles rea|dy to flatter him, and daub, and deceive, and &s;ettle him again in the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his former ma&s;|ter. What, &s;ay they, do you make a doubt of your &s;alvation, who have lived &s;o well, and done no body harm? GOD is merciful: and if &s;uch as you &s;hall not be &s;aved, GOD help a great many: what do you think is become of all your fore-fathers? And what will become of all your friends and neighbours that live as you do? Will they all be damned? Shall none be &s;aved think you, but a few &s;trict ones? Come, come, if ye hearken to the&s;e books or preachers, they will drive you to de&s;pair, or drive you out of your wits: thus do they follow the &s;oul that is e&s;caping from Satan, with re&s;tle&s;s cries, till they have brought him back: Oh, how many thou&s;ands have &s;uch charms kept a&s;leep in &s;ecurity, till death and hell have awakened and better informed them! The LORD calls to the &s;inner, and tells him, <HI>The gate is &s;trait, the way is narrow, and few find it: try and examine whe|ther thou be in the faith or no: give all diligence to make &s;ure in Time.</HI>&mdash;And the world cries out clean the con|trary, never doubt, never trouble your&s;elves with the&s;e thoughts:&mdash;I entreat the &s;inner that is in this &s;trait, to con&s;ider, that it is <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and not their fathers, or mothers, or neighbours, or friends that mu&s;t judge them: and if <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> condemn them, the&s;e cannot fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e them: and therefore common rea&s;on may tell them, that it is n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> from the words of ignorant men, but from the word of GOD that they mu&s;t fetch their hopes of &s;alvation.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="022331_0171_0FB7F31D5A7C6540">
When <HI>Ahab</HI> would enquire among the multitudes of flattering prophets, it was his death. They can flatter men into the &s;nare, but they cannot bring them out. Oh, take the coun&s;el of the Holy Gho&s;t, <HI>Eph.</HI> v. 6, 7. <HI>Let no ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> deceive you with vain words: for becau&s;e of the&s;e things cometh the wrath of</HI> GOD <HI>upon the children of di&s;obedience: be not ye therefore partak|ers with them: but &s;ave your&s;elves from this untoward generation.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. But the greate&s;t hinderances are in men's own hearts.</P>
<P N="1">1. Some are &s;o ignorant that they know not what &s;elf-examination is, nor what a mini&s;ter means when he per&s;uadeth them to try them&s;elves; or they know not that there is any nece&s;&s;ity of it: but think every man is bound to believe that GOD is his father, and that his &s;ins are pardoned whether it be true or fal&s;e; and that it were a great fault to make any que&s;|tion of it: or they do not think that a&s;&s;urance can be attained: or that there is any &s;uch great difference be|twixt one man and another: but that we are all chri&s;|tians, and therefore need not trouble our&s;elves any further: or at lea&s;t they know not wherein the differ|ence lies; nor how to &s;et upon this &s;earching of their hearts. They have as gro&s;s conceits of that regene|ration, which they mu&s;t &s;earch for, as <HI>Nicodemus</HI> had; they are like tho&s;e in <HI>Acts</HI> xix. 2. that <HI>know not whe|ther there were a Holy Gho&s;t to be received or no.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Some are &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;elf-love and pride, that they will not &s;o much as &s;u&s;pect any danger to them&s;elves. Like a pround trade&s;man who &s;corns the motion when his friends de&s;ire him to ca&s;t up his books, becau&s;e they are afraid he will break. As &s;ome fond parents that have an over-weaning conceit of their own children, and therefore will not believe
<PB N="173" REF="022331_0172_0FB7F320A264B000">or hear any evil of them: &s;uch a fond &s;elf-love doth hinder men from &s;u&s;pecting and trying their &s;tates.</P>
<P N="3">3. Some are &s;o guilty that they dare not try: they are &s;o fearful that they &s;hould find their e&s;tates un|&s;ound, that they dare not &s;earch into them. And yet they dare venture them to a more dreadful trial.</P>
<P N="4">4. Some are &s;o in love with their &s;in, and &s;o in di&s;|like with the way of GOD, that they dare not fall on the trial of their ways, le&s;t they be forced from the cour&s;e which they love.</P>
<P N="5">5. Some are &s;o re&s;olved already never to change their pre&s;ent &s;tate, that they neglect examination as a u&s;ele&s;s thing: before they will turn &s;o preci&s;e and &s;eek a new way, when they have lived &s;o long, and gone &s;o far, they will put their eternal &s;tate to the venture, come of it what will. And when a man is fully re&s;olved to hold to his way, and not to turn back, be it right or wrong, to what end &s;hould he enquire whether he be right or no?</P>
<P N="6">6. Mo&s;t men are &s;o taken up with their worldly affairs, and are &s;o bu&s;y in providing for the fle&s;h, that they cannot &s;et them&s;elves to the trying of their title to heaven: they have another kind of happine&s;s in their eye, which will not &s;uffer them to make &s;ure of heaven.</P>
<P N="7">7. But the mo&s;t common impediment is that fal&s;e faith and hope commonly called pre&s;umption: which bears up the hearts of mo&s;t of the world, and &s;o keeps them from &s;u&s;pecting their danger.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee what abundance of difficulties mu&s;t be overcome before a man clo&s;ely &s;ets upon the exa|mining of his heart.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="022331_0173_0FB7F3228A8BEBB0">
And if a man break through all the&s;e impediments, and &s;et upon the duty, yet, of tho&s;e few who enquire after means of a&s;&s;urance, divers are deceived and mi&s;|carry, e&s;pecially through the&s;e following cau&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is &s;uch confu&s;ion and darkne&s;s in the &s;oul of man, e&s;pecially of an unregenerate man, that he can &s;carcely tell what he doth, or what is in him. As one can hardly find any thing in an hou&s;e where nothing keeps its place, but all is ca&s;t on an heap together; &s;o is it in the heart where all things are in di&s;order, e&s;pecially when darkne&s;s is added to this di&s;order: &s;o that the heart is like an ob&s;cure dungeon, where there is but a little crevice of light, and a man mu&s;t rather grope than &s;ee, no wonder if men mi&s;take in &s;earch|ing &s;uch an heart, and &s;o mi&s;carry in judging their e&s;tates.</P>
<P N="2">2. Be&s;ides, many are re&s;olved what to judge before they try: they u&s;e the duty but to &s;trengthen their pre&s;ent conceits of them&s;elves, and not to find out the truth of their condition: like a bribed judge, who examines each party as if he would judge uprightly, when he is re&s;olved which way the cau&s;e &s;hall go be|fore-hand. Ju&s;t &s;o do men examine their hearts.</P>
<P N="3">3. Al&s;o men try them&s;elves by fal&s;e marks and rules: not knowing wherein the truth of chri&s;tianity doth con&s;i&s;t: &s;ome looking beyond, and &s;ome &s;hort of the &s;cripture-&s;tandard.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, Men frequently mi&s;carry in this work, by &s;etting on it in their own &s;trength. As &s;ome expect the Spirit &s;hould do it without them, &s;o others at|tempt it them&s;elves without &s;eeking or expecting the help of the Spirit: both the&s;e will certainly mi&s;carry in their a&s;&s;urance.</P>

<PB N="175" REF="022331_0174_0FB7F32409414728">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Further Cau&s;es of doubting among Chri&s;tians.</HEAD>
<P>BECAUSE the comfort of a chri&s;tian's life doth &s;o much con&s;i&s;t in his a&s;&s;urance of GOD's &s;pecial love, and becau&s;e the right way of obtaining it is &s;o much controverted, I will here proceed a little fur|ther in opening to you &s;ome other hinderances which keep us chri&s;tians from comfortable certainty.</P>
<P N="1">1. One great cau&s;e of doubting and uncertainty, is, the weakne&s;s of our grace. A little grace is next to none. Small things are hardly di&s;cerned. Mo&s;t con|tent them&s;elves with a &s;mall mea&s;ure of grace, and do not follow on to &s;piritual &s;trength and manhood. They believe &s;o weakly, and love GOD &s;o little, that they can &s;carce find whether they believe and love at all. Like a man in a &s;woon, who&s;e pul&s;e and breathing is &s;o weak, that they can hardly be perceived whether they move at all, and con&s;equently whether the man be alive or dead.</P>
<P>The chief remedy for &s;uch would be, to follow on their duty, till their graces be increa&s;ed: ply your work: wait upon GOD in the u&s;e of his pre&s;cribed means, and he will undoubtedly ble&s;s you with in|crea&s;e. Oh that chri&s;tians would be&s;tow mo&s;t of that time in getting more grace, which they be&s;tow in anxi|ous doubtings whether they have any or none; and that they would lay out tho&s;e &s;erious affections in praying, and &s;eeking to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for more grace, which they be&s;tow in fruitle&s;s complaints! I be&s;eech thee, take this advice as from GOD! and then, when thou believe&s;t &s;trongly, and love&s;t &s;ervently, thou can&s;t not doubt whether thou believe and love or not; no more
<PB N="176" REF="022331_0175_0FB7F3265ACB2D38">than a man that is burning hot can doubt whether he be warm: or a man that is &s;trong and lu&s;ty can doubt whether he be alive.</P>
<P N="2">2. Many a &s;oul lieth long under doubting, through the imperfection of their very rea&s;on, and exceeding weakne&s;s of their natural parts. Grace doth u&s;ual|ly rather employ our faculties on better objects, than add to the degree of their natural &s;trength. Many hone&s;t hearts have &s;uch weak heads, that they know not how to perform the work of &s;elf-trial: they are not able to argue the ca&s;e; they will acknowledge the premi&s;es, and yet deny the apparent conclu&s;ion. Or if they be brought to acknowledge the conclu&s;ion, yet they do but &s;tragger in their conce&s;&s;ion, and hold it &s;o weakly, that every a&s;&s;ault may take it from them. If GOD do not &s;ome other way &s;upply to the&s;e men the defect of their rea&s;on, I &s;ee not how they &s;hould have clear and &s;ettled peace.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another common cau&s;e of doubting and di&s;com|fort, is, the &s;ecret maintaining &s;ome known &s;in.</P>
<P>When a man liveth in &s;ome unwarrantable practice, and GOD hath oft touched him for it, and yet he con|tinueth it; it is no wonder if this per&s;on want both a&s;&s;urance and comfort. One would think that a &s;oul that is &s;o tender as to tremble, &s;hould be as tender of &s;inning: and yet &s;ad experience telleth us that it is frequently otherwi&s;e: I have known too many &s;uch, that would complain and yet &s;in, and accu&s;e them|&s;elves, and yet &s;in &s;till, yea and de&s;pair, and yet pro|ceed in &s;inning: and all arguments and means could not keep them from the wilful committing of that &s;in again and again, which yet they them&s;elves did think would prove their de&s;truction. Yea, &s;ome will be carried away with tho&s;e &s;ins that &s;eem mo&s;t contrary to their dejected temper. I have known them that
<PB N="177" REF="022331_0176_0FB7F328E7615068">would fill men's ears with the con&s;tant lamentations of their mi&s;erable &s;tate, and accu&s;ations again&s;t them|&s;elves, as if they had been the mo&s;t humble people in the world; and yet be as pa&s;&s;ionate in the maintaining their innocency when another accu&s;eth them, and as intolerably peevi&s;h, and tender of their reputation in any thing they are blamed for, as if they were the proude&s;t per&s;ons on earth.</P>
<P>This cheri&s;hing &s;in doth hinder a&s;&s;urance the&s;e four ways.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. It doth abate the degree of our graces, and &s;o makes them undi&s;cernible.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. It ob&s;cureth that which it de&s;troyeth not; for it beareth &s;uch &s;way, that grace is not &s;een to &s;tir, nor &s;care heard &s;peak for the noi&s;e of this corruption.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. It putteth out, or darkeneth the eye of the &s;oul, and it benumeth and &s;tupifieth it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. But e&s;pecially it provoketh GOD to withdraw him&s;elf, his comforts and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spirit, without which we may &s;earch long enough before we have a&s;&s;urance. GOD hath made a &s;eparation betwixt &s;in and peace. As long as thou do&s;t cheri&s;h thy pride, thy love of the world, the de&s;ires of the fle&s;h, or any unchri&s;tian practice, thou expecte&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">urance and com|fort in vain. GOD will not encourage thee by his precious gifts in a cour&s;e of &s;inning. This worm will be gnawing upon thy con&s;cience: It will be a devouring canker to thy con&s;olations. Thou may&s;t &s;teal a &s;park of fal&s;e comfort from thy worldly pro&s;|perity or delight: or thou may&s;t have it from &s;ome fal&s;e opinions, or from the delu&s;ions of Satan; but from GOD thou wilt have no comfort. However an <HI>Antinomian</HI> may tell thee, that thy comforts have no de|pendance
<PB N="178" REF="022331_0177_0FB7F32A15C97BF0">upon thy obedience, nor thy di&s;comforts up|on thy di&s;obedience: and therefore may &s;peak peace to thee in the cour&s;e of thy &s;inning; yet thou &s;halt find by experience that GOD will not. If any man &s;et up his idols in his heart, and put the &s;tumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a mini&s;ter, or to GOD, to enquire for a&s;&s;urance and comfort, GOD will an&s;wer that man by him&s;elf, and in&s;tead of comforting him, he will &s;et his face again&s;t him, <HI>he will an&s;wer him according to the multitude of his idols.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Another common cau&s;e of want of a&s;&s;urance and comfort, is, when men grow lazy in the &s;piritual part of duty. As Dr. <HI>Sibbs</HI> &s;aith truly, "it is the lazy chri&s;tian commonly that lacketh a&s;&s;urance." The way of painful duty, is the way of fulle&s;t comfort. <HI>Chir&s;t</HI> carrieth all our comforts in his hand: if we are out of that way where <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is to be met, we are out of the way where comfort is to be had.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The&s;e two ways doth this lazine&s;s debar us of our comforts.</P>
<P N="1">1. By &s;topping the fountain, and cau&s;ing <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to withhold this ble&s;&s;ing from us. Parents u&s;e not to &s;mile upon children in their neglects and di&s;obedience. So far as the Spirit is grieved, he will &s;u&s;pend his con|&s;olations. A&s;&s;urance and peace are <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s great en|couragements to faithfulne&s;s and obedience: and there|fore (though our obedience do not merit them, yet) they u&s;ually ri&s;e and fall with our diligence in duty.

<PB N="179" REF="022331_0178_0FB7F32BACF91F60">other parts of our obedience. He that will &s;ay to us in that triumphing day, <HI>Well done, good and faithful &s;ervant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord;</HI> will al&s;o comfort his &s;ervants in their mo&s;t affectionate and &s;pi|ritual duties, and &s;ay, <HI>Well done, good and faithful &s;ervant, take this foreta&s;te of thy everla&s;ting joy.</HI> It thou grow &s;eldom and cu&s;tomary, and cold in duty, e&s;pe|cially in thy &s;ecret prayers to GOD, and yet finde&s;t no abatement in thy joys, I cannot but fear that thy joys are either carnal or diabolical.</P>
<P N="2">2. The action of the &s;oul upon &s;uch excellent ob|jects doth naturally bring con&s;olation with it. The very act of loving GOD in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> doth bring inexpre&s;|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble &s;weetne&s;s into the &s;oul. The &s;oul that is be&s;t furni&s;hed with grace, when it is not in action, is like a lute well &s;tringed and tuned, which while it lieth &s;till, doth make no more mu&s;ic than a common piece of wood: but when it is taken up and handled by a &s;kilful luti&s;t, the melody is delightful. Some degree of comfort follows every good action, as heat accom|panies fire, and as beams and influence i&s;&s;ue from the &s;un: which is &s;o true, that the very heathens upon the di&s;charge of a good con&s;cience have found comfort and peace an&s;werable. This is <HI>praemium ante praemi|um:</HI> a reward before the reward.</P>
<P>As a man therefore that is cold &s;hould not &s;tand &s;till and &s;ay. I am &s;o cold that I have no mind to labour, but labour till his coldne&s;s be gone, and heat excited; &s;o he that wants the comfort of a&s;&s;urance, mu&s;t not &s;tand &s;till, and &s;ay, I am &s;o doubtful and uncomfort|able that I have no mind for duty; but ply his duty, and exerci&s;e his graces, till he finds his doubts and di&s;comforts vani&s;h.</P>
<P>And thus I have &s;hewn you the chief cau&s;es, why &s;o many chri&s;tians enjoy &s;o little a&s;&s;urance and con|&s;olation.</P>

<P>I WILL not &s;tand here to lay down the directions nece&s;&s;ary for preparation to this duty, becau&s;e you may gather them from what is &s;aid concerning the hinderances: for the contraries of tho&s;e hinderances will be the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary helps. Only before you &s;et upon it, I advi&s;e you to the ob&s;ervation of the&s;e rules.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Come not with too peremptory conclu&s;ions of your&s;elves before-hand. Do not judge too confident|ly before you try.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Be &s;ure to be &s;o well acquainted with the &s;crip|ture, as to know what is the tenor of the covenant of grace, and what are the conditions of ju&s;tification and glorification, and con&s;equently what are &s;ound marks to try thy&s;elf by.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Be a con&s;tant ob&s;erver of the temper and moti|ons of thy heart: mo&s;t of the difficulty of the work doth lie in true and clear di&s;cerning of it. Be watch|ful in ob&s;erving the actings both of grace and cor|ruption, and the circum&s;tances of their actings: as, how frequent? how violent? how &s;trong or weak were the outward incitements? how great or &s;mall the impediments? what delight, or loathing, or fear, or reluctancy did go with tho&s;e acts?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">1. Empty thy mind of all of all thy other cares and thoughts, that they do not di&s;tract or divide thy mind: this work will be enough at once of it&s;elf, without joining others with it.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="181" REF="022331_0180_0FB7F3305AEF0CD0">
2. Then fall down before GOD, and in hearty prayer de&s;ire the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Spirit, to di&s;cover to thee the plain truth of thy condition, and to en|lighten thee in the whole progre&s;s of the work.</P>
<P>I will not digre&s;s to warn you here of the fal&s;e rules and marks of trial of which you mu&s;t beware. But I will briefly adjoin &s;ome marks to try your title to this re&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. Every &s;oul that hath a title to this re&s;t, doth place his happine&s;s in it, and make it the ultimate end of his &s;oul. This is the fir&s;t mark; which is &s;o plain a truth, that I need not &s;tand to prove it. For this re&s;t con&s;i&s;teth in the full and glorious enjoyment of GOD: and he that maketh not GOD his ultimate end, is in heart a pagan and vile idolater.</P>
<P>Let me a&s;k then; do&s;t thou truly account it thy chief happine&s;s to enjoy the LORD in glory, or do&s;t thou not? Can&s;t thou &s;ay with <HI>David, The Lord is my portion?</HI> And <HI>whom have I in heaven, but thee? And whom in earth that I de&s;ire in compari&s;on of thee?</HI> If thou be an heir of re&s;t, it is thus with thee. Tho' the fle&s;h will be pleading for its own delights, and the world will be creeping into thine affection, yet in thy ordinary, &s;ettled, prevailing judgment and affec|tions, thou preferre&s;t GOD before all things in the world.</P>
<P N="1">1. Thou make&s;t him the end of thy de&s;ires and en|deavours: the very rea&s;on why thou heare&s;t and pray|e&s;t, why thou de&s;ire&s;t to live and breathe on earth, is this, that thou may&s;t &s;eek the LORD. Thou &s;eeke&s;t fir&s;t the kingdom of GOD and its righteou&s;ne&s;s: tho' thou do&s;t not &s;eek it &s;o zealou&s;ly as thou &s;hould&s;t; yet hath it the chief of thy de&s;ires and endeavours: and nothing el&s;e de&s;ired or preferred before it.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="182" REF="022331_0181_0FB7F331B1B288C0">
2. Thou wilt think no labour or &s;uffering too great to obtain it. And though the fle&s;h may &s;ome|times &s;hrink, yet art thou re&s;olved and content to go through all.</P>
<P N="3">3. If thou be an heir of re&s;t, thy valuation of it will be &s;o high, and thy affection to it &s;o great, that thou would&s;t not exchange thy title to it, and hopes of it, for any worldly good what&s;oever. If GOD would &s;et before thee an eternity of earthly plea&s;ure on one hand, and the re&s;t of the &s;aints on the other, and bid thee take thy choice; thou would&s;t refu&s;e the world, and choo&s;e this re&s;t.</P>
<P>But if thou be yet in the fle&s;h, then it is clean con|trary with thee: then do&s;t thou in thy heart prefer thy worldly happine&s;s before GOD; and though thy tongue may &s;ay, that GOD is the chief good, yet thy heart doth not &s;o e&s;teem him. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. The world is the chief end of thy de&s;ires and endeavour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; thy very heart is &s;et upon it; thy great|e&s;t care and labour is to maintain thy e&s;tate, or credit, or fle&s;hly delights. But the life to come hath little of thy care or labour. Thou did&s;t never perceive &s;o much excellency in the un&s;een glory as to draw thy heart &s;o after it; but that little pains which thou be|&s;towe&s;t that way, it is but in the &s;econd place. GOD hath but the world's leaving, and that time and la|bour which thou can&s;t &s;pare from the world, or tho&s;e few cold and carele&s;s thoughts which follow thy con|&s;tant, earne&s;t, and delightful thoughts of earthly things: neither would&s;t thou do any thing at all for heaven, if thou knewe&s;t how to keep the world: but le&s;t thou &s;hould&s;t be turned into hell, when thou can&s;t keep the world no longer, therefore thou wilt do &s;omething.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="183" REF="022331_0182_0FB7F3330A93DED8">
2. Therefore it is that thou thinke&s;t the way of GOD too &s;trict, and wilt not be per&s;uaded to the con|&s;tant labour of walking according to the go&s;pel-rule: and when it comes to trial, that thou mu&s;t for&s;ake <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> or thy worldly happine&s;s, and the wind which was in thy back doth turn in thy face, then thou wilt venture heaven rather than earth, and (as de&s;perate re|bels u&s;e to &s;ay) thou wilt rather tru&s;t GOD's mercy for thy &s;oul, than man's for thy body; and &s;o deny thy obedience to GOD.</P>
<P N="3">3. And certainly if GOD would but give thee leave to live in health and wealth for-ever on earth, thou woul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t think it a better &s;late than re&s;t: let them &s;eek for heaven that would, thou would&s;t think this thy chiefe&s;t happine&s;s. This is thy ca&s;e if thou be yet an unregenerate per&s;on, and ha&s;t no title to the &s;aints re&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;econd mark which I &s;hall give thee, to try whether thou be an heir of re&s;t, is this:</P>
<P>As thou take&s;t GOD for thy chief good, &s;o, Thou do&s;t heartily accept of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for thy only Saviour and Lord to bring thee to this re&s;t. The former mark was the &s;um of the fir&s;t and great command of the law of nature, <HI>[Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God.]</HI> This &s;econd mark is the &s;um of the come and or condition of the go&s;pel, <HI>[Believe in the Lord Je&s;us, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved.]</HI> And the performance of the&s;e two is the whole &s;um or e&s;&s;ence of godline&s;s and chri&s;tianity. Ob&s;erve therefore the parts of this mark, which is but a definition of faith.</P>
<P N="1">1. Do&s;t thou find that thou art naturally a lo&s;t, con|demned man, for thy breach of the fir&s;t covenant? And believe that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is the mediator who hath made a &s;ufficient &s;atisfaction to the law? And hear|ing in the go&s;pel that he is offered without exception
<PB N="184" REF="022331_0183_0FB7F335505AEF78">unto all, do&s;t thou heartily con&s;ent that he alone &s;hall be thy Saviour? And no further tru&s;t to thy duties and works, than as conditions required by him, and means appointed in &s;ubordination to him? Not look|ing at them as in the lea&s;t mea&s;ure able to &s;atisfy the cour&s;e of the law, or as a legal righteou&s;ne&s;s, nor any part of it? But art content to tru&s;t thy &s;alvation on the redemption made by <HI>Chri&s;t?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Art thou al&s;o content to take him for thy only Lord and King, to govern and guide thee by his laws and Spirit? And to obey him even when he com|mandeth the harde&s;t duties, and tho&s;e which mo&s;t cro&s;s the de&s;ires of the fle&s;h? Is it thy &s;orrow when thou breake&s;t thy re&s;olution herein? And thy joy when thou keepe&s;t clo&s;e&s;t in obedience to him? Woulde&s;t thou not change thy Lord and Ma&s;ter for all the world? Thus it is with every true chri&s;tian. But if thou be an unbeliever it is far otherwi&s;e. Thou may&s;t call <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> thy Lord and thy Saviour: but thou never &s;ounde&s;t thy&s;elf &s;o lo&s;t without him, as to drive thee to tru&s;t him, and lay thy &s;alvation on him alone: or at lea&s;t thou did&s;t never heartily con&s;ent that he &s;hould govern thee as thy Lord; nor re&s;ign up thy &s;oul and life to be ruled by him; nor take his word for the law of thy thoughts and actions. It is like thou art content to be &s;aved from hell by <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> when thou die&s;t: but in the mean-time he &s;hall command thee n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> further than will &s;tand with thy credit, or plea&s;ure, or worldly e&s;tate and ends. And if he would give thee leave, thou had&s;t far rather live after the world and fle&s;h, than after the word and Spirit. And though thou may&s;t now and then have a motion or purpo&s;e to the contrary; yet this that I have menti|oned, is the ordinary de&s;ire and choice of thine heart: and &s;o thou art no true believer in <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> for though thou confe&s;s him in words, yet in works thou d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i deny him, <HI>being di&s;obedient, and to every good work a

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> The Rea&s;on of the Saints Afflictions here.</HEAD>
<P>A Further u&s;e which we mu&s;t make of the pre&s;ent doctrine is, To inform us why the people of GOD &s;uffer &s;o much in this life. What wonder? when you &s;ee their re&s;t doth yet remain: they are not yet come to their re&s;ting place. We would all fain have continual pro&s;perity, becau&s;e it is plea&s;ing to the fle&s;h; but we con&s;ider not the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of &s;uch de&s;ires. We are like children, who if they &s;ee any thing which their appetite de&s;ireth, cry for it: and if you tell them that it is unwhole&s;ome, or hurtful for them, they are never the more quieted; or if you go about to heal any &s;ore that they have, they will notendure you to hurt them, though you tell them, that they cannot otherwi&s;e be healed; their &s;en&s;e is too &s;trong for their rea&s;on, and therefore rea&s;on doth lit|tle per&s;uade them. Even &s;o it is with us when GOD is affticting us: he giveth us rea&s;ons why we mu&s;t bear it, &s;o that our rea&s;on is oft convinced and &s;ati&s;|fied, and yet we cry and complain &s;till: it is not rea|&s;on, but ea&s;e that we mu&s;t have: &s;piritual remedies may cure the &s;pirit's maladies; but that will not con|tent the fle&s;h.</P>
<P>But methinks chri&s;tians &s;hould have another palate than that of the fle&s;h, to try and reli&s;h providences by: GOD hath given them the Spirit to &s;ubdue the fle&s;h. And therefore I &s;hall here give them &s;ome rea&s;ons of GOD'S dealing in their pre&s;ent &s;ufferings, whereby the
<PB N="186" REF="022331_0185_0FB7F33908476668">equity and mercy therein may appear: and they &s;hall be only &s;uch as are drawn from the reference that the&s;e afflictions have to our re&s;t; which being a chri&s;tian's happine&s;s, and ultimate end, will direct him in judg|ing of all e&s;tates and means.</P>
<P N="1">1. Con&s;ider then, That labour and trouble are the common way to re&s;t, both in the cour&s;e of nature and of grace. Can there po&s;&s;ibly be re&s;t without motion and wearine&s;s? Do you not travel and toil fir&s;t, and then re&s;t afterwards? The day for labour goes fir&s;t, and then the night for re&s;t doth follow. Why &s;hould we de&s;ire the cour&s;e of grace to be perverted, any more than we would do the cour&s;e of nature? GOD did once dry up the &s;ea to make a pa&s;&s;age for his people; and once made the &s;un in the firmament to &s;tand &s;till: but mu&s;t he do &s;o always? Or as oft as we would have him? It is his e&s;tabli&s;hed decree, <HI>That through many tribulations we mu&s;t enter into the kingdom of heaven,</HI> Acts xiv. 22. And <HI>that if we &s;uffer with him, we &s;hall al&s;o be glorified with him,</HI> 2 Tim. ii. 12. And what are we, that GOD'S &s;tatutes &s;hould be rever&s;ed for our plea&s;ure? As <HI>Bildad</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Job,</HI> Chap. xviii. 4. <HI>Shall the earth be for&s;aken for thee? or the rock be removed out of his place?</HI> So, <HI>mu&s;t God pervert his e&s;tabli&s;hed order for thee?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider al&s;o, That afflictions are exceeding u&s;e|ful to us, to keep us from mi&s;taking our re&s;ting place, and &s;o taking up &s;hort of it. A chri&s;tian's motion heaven-wards is voluntary, and not con&s;trained. Tho&s;e means therefore are mo&s;t pro&s;itable to him, which help his under&s;tanding and will in this pro&s;ecution. The mo&s;t dangerous mi&s;take that our &s;ouls are capable of, is, to take the creature for GOD, and earth for heaven. And yet, alas, how common is this! Though we are a&s;hamed to &s;peak &s;o much with our tongues, yet how oft do our hearts &s;ay, <HI>It is be&s;t being here!</HI> And how
<PB N="187" REF="022331_0186_0FB7F33AFAA6C158">contented are we with an earthly portion! So that I fear, GOD would di&s;plea&s;e mo&s;t of us more to afflict us here, and promi&s;e us re&s;t hereafter, than to give us our hearts de&s;ire on earth, though he had never made us a promi&s;e of heaven. As if the creature without GOD, were better than GOD without the creature. Alas, how apt are we, like fooli&s;h children, when we are bu&s;y at our &s;ports and worldly employments, to forget both our father and our home! Therefore it is a hard thing for a rich man to enter into heaven, be|cau&s;e it is hard for him to value it more than earth, and not think he is well already. Come to a man that hath the world at will, and tell him, This is not your happine&s;s, you have higher things to look after; and how little will he regard you? But when affliction comes, it &s;peaks convincingly, and will be heard when preachers cannot.</P>
<P>Sometimes a &s;incere man begins to be lifted up with applau&s;e; and &s;ometimes being in health and pro&s;pe|rity, he hath lo&s;t his reli&s;h of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and the joys above; till GOD break in upon his riches, and &s;eatter them abroad, or upon his children, or upon his con&s;ci|ence, or upon the health of his body, and break down his mount which he thought &s;o &s;trong: and then when he lieth in <HI>Mana&s;&s;ah</HI>'s fetters, or is fa&s;tened to his bed with pining &s;ickne&s;s, O what an opportunity hath the Spirit to plead with his &s;oul! When the world is worth nothing, then heaven is worth &s;omething.</P>
<P>How oft have I been ready to think my&s;elf at home, till &s;ickne&s;s hath roundly told me, I was mi&s;taken! And how apt yet to fall into the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, which prevaileth till it be removed by the &s;ame cure! If our dear Lord did not put the&s;e thorns into our bed, we &s;hould &s;leep out our lives, and lo&s;e our glory.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="188" REF="022331_0187_0FB7F34363A438C8">
3. Con&s;ider, afflictions are GOD'S mo&s;t effectual means, to keep us from &s;traggling out of the way to our re&s;t. If he had not &s;et a hedge of thor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s on the right hand, and on the left, we &s;hould hardly keep the way to heaven: if there be but one gap open without the&s;e thorns, how ready are we to turn out at it? But when we cannot go a&s;tray, but the&s;e thorns will prick us, perhaps we will be content to hold the way. When we grow wanton, or worldly, or proud; what a nota|ble means is &s;ickne&s;s, or other affliction, to reduce us? It is every chri&s;tian, as well as <HI>Luther,</HI> that may call affliction one of his be&s;t &s;chool-ma&s;ters. Many a one, as well as <HI>David,</HI> may &s;ay by experience, <HI>Before I was afflicted I went a&s;tray, but now have I kept thy precepts.</HI> Many a thou&s;and poor recovered &s;inners may cry, O healthful &s;ickne&s;s! O comfortable &s;orrows! O gainful lo&s;&s;es! O enriching poverty! O ble&s;&s;ed day, that ever I was afflicted! It is not only <HI>the plea&s;ant &s;treams, and the green pa&s;tures, but his rod and &s;taff al|&s;o that are our comfort.</HI> Though I know it is the word and Spirit that do the work; yet certainly the time of &s;uffering is &s;o opportune a &s;ea&s;on, that the &s;ame word will take them then, which before was &s;carce ob&s;erved: it doth &s;o unbolt the door of the heart, that a mini&s;ter or a friend may then be heard, and the word may have ea&s;ier entrance to the affections.</P>
<P N="4">4. Con&s;ider, afflictions are GOD'S mo&s;t effectual means, to make us mend our pace in the way to our re&s;t. They are his rod, and his &s;pur: what &s;luggard will not awake and &s;tir when he feeleth them? It were well if mere love would prevail with us, and that we were rather drawn to heaven, than driven: but &s;ee|ing our hearts are &s;o bad, that mercy will not do it; it is better we be put on with the &s;harpe&s;t &s;courge, than loiter out our time till the doors are &s;hut.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="022331_0188_0FB7F349D6DD9F58">
O what a difference is there betwixt our prayers in health and in &s;ickne&s;s! betwixt our pro&s;perity and ad|ver&s;ity-repentings! He that before had not a tear to &s;hed, or a groan to utter, now can &s;ob, and &s;igh, and weep: he that was wont to lie like a block in prayer, and &s;carce minded what he &s;aid to GOD: now afflicti|on pre&s;&s;eth him down, how earne&s;tly can he beg! How doth he mingle his prayers and his tears! And cry out, what a per&s;on he will be, If GOD will but hear him, and deliver him! Alas! if we did not &s;ometimes feel the &s;pur, what a &s;low pace would mo&s;t of us hold toward heaven!</P>
<P>Seeing then what our vile natures require, why &s;hould we be unwilling GOD &s;hould do us good by a &s;harp means? Sure that is the be&s;t dealing for us which &s;ure&s;t and &s;oone&s;t doth further us for heaven. I leave thee, chri&s;tian, to judge by thy own experience, whe|ther thou do&s;t not go more watchfully, and lively, and &s;peedily in thy way to re&s;t, in thy &s;ufferings, than thou do&s;t in thy more plea&s;ing and pro&s;perous &s;tate.</P>
<P>La&s;tly con&s;ider, GOD doth &s;eldom give his people &s;o &s;weet a fore-ta&s;te of their future re&s;t, as in their deep afflictions. He keepeth his mo&s;t precious cordi|als for the time of our greate&s;t faintings and dangers. GOD is not &s;o lavi&s;h of his choice favours as to be|&s;tow them un&s;ea&s;onably: he gives them at &s;o fit a time, when he knoweth they are needful, and will be valued; and when he is &s;ure to be thanked for them, and his people rejoiced by them. E&s;pecially, when our &s;ufferings are more directly for his cau&s;e, then doth be &s;eldom fail of &s;weetening the bitter cup. Therefore have the martyrs been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the high|e&s;t joys, and therefore were they &s;o ambitious of mar|tyrdom. I do not think that <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> did ever &s;ing more joyfully, than when they were &s;ore with
<PB N="190" REF="022331_0189_0FB7F34E0FDE5120">&s;courgings, and fa&s;t in the inner pri&s;on, with their feet in the &s;tocks. When did <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> preach &s;uch com|forts to his di&s;ciples, and a&s;&s;ure them of his provid|ing them man&s;ions with him&s;elf, but when he was ready to leave them, and their hearts were &s;orrowful becau&s;e of his departure? When did he appear among them, and &s;ay, <HI>peace be unto you,</HI> but when they were &s;hut up together for fear of the per&s;ecuting <HI>Jews?</HI> When did <HI>Stephen</HI> &s;ee heaven opened, but when he was giving up his life for the te&s;timony of <HI>Je&s;us?</HI> And though we be never put to the &s;uffering of mar|tyrdom, yet GOD knoweth that in our natural &s;uffer|ings we need &s;upport.</P>
<P>Seeing then that the time of affliction, is the time of our mo&s;t pure, &s;piritual, and heavenly joy, for the mo&s;t part; why &s;hould a chri&s;tian think it &s;o bad a time? Is not that our be&s;t e&s;tate, wherein we have mo&s;t of GOD? Why el&s;e do we de&s;ire to come to heaven? If we look for a heaven of fle&s;hly delights, we &s;hall find our&s;elves mi&s;taken. Conclude then, that affliction is not &s;o bad a &s;tate in our way to re&s;t, as the fle&s;h would make it. Are we wi&s;er than GOD? Doth not he know what is good for us better than we? Or is he not as careful of our good, as we are of our own? Ah wo to us if he were not much more! And if he did not love us better than we love either him or our&s;elves!</P>
<P>But let us hear a little what it is that we can object.</P>
<P N="1">1. Oh, &s;aith one, I could bear any other affliction &s;ave this: if GOD had touched me in any thing el&s;e, I could have undergone it patiently; but it is my deare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t friend, or child, or wife, or my health it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer it &s;eemeth GOD hath hit the right vein, where thy mo&s;t in&s;tamed, di&s;tempered blood did lie:
<PB N="191" REF="022331_0190_0FB7F3504C938F08">it is his con&s;tant cour&s;e to pull down men's idols, and take away that which is dearer to them than him&s;elf. There it is that his jealou&s;y is kindled; and there it is that the &s;oul is mo&s;t endangered. If GOD &s;hould have taken from thee that which thou can&s;t let go for him, and not that which thou can&s;t not; or have af|flicted thee where thou can&s;t bear it, and not where thou can&s;t not; thy idol would neither have been di&s;|covered nor removed; this would neither have been a &s;ufficient trial to thee, nor a cure, but have con|firmed thee in thy idolatry.</P>

Object. 3. Oh, but &s;aith another, if my affliction did not di&s;able me for duty, I could bear it; but it maketh me u&s;ele&s;s and utterly unprofitable.</P>
<P>An&s;w. 1. For that duty which tendeth to thy own benefit, it doth not di&s;able thee; but is the greate&s;t help that thou can&s;t expect. Thou u&s;e&s;t to complain of coldne&s;s, and dulne&s;s, and worldline&s;s, and &s;ecuri|ty: if affliction will not help thee again&s;t all the&s;e, by warning, quickening, rouzing thy &s;pirit, I know not what will.

<P N="2">2. As for duty to others, and &s;ervice to the church, it is not thy dety when GOD doth di&s;able thee. He may call thee out of the vineyard in this re&s;pect, even before he call thee by death. If he lay thee in the grave, and put others in thy place, is this any wrong to thee? So if he call thee out before thy death, and &s;et others to do the work, &s;hould&s;t thou not be as well content? Mu&s;t GOD do all the work by thee? Hath he not many others as dear to him, and as fit for the employment? But alas, what deceitfulne&s;s lieth in the&s;e hearts! When we have time, and health, and opportunity to work, then we loiter, and do our Ma&s;ter but poor &s;ervice: but when he layeth afflicti|on upon us, then we complain that he di&s;ableth us for his work, and yet perhaps we are &s;till negligent in that part of the work which we can do. So, when we are in health and pro&s;perity, we forget the public, and are carele&s;s of other men's mi&s;eries and wants, and mind almo&s;t nothing but our&s;elves; but when GOD afflict<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th us, though he excite us more to duty for our|&s;elves, yet we complain that he di&s;ableth us for our duty to others: as if on a &s;udden we were grown &s;o charitable, that we regard other men's &s;ouls more man our own! But is not the hand of fle&s;h in all this di&s;|&s;imulation,
<PB N="193" REF="022331_0192_0FB7F35712119088">pleading its own cau&s;e? What pride of heart is this, to think that other men cannot do the work as well as we! Or that GOD cannot &s;ee to his church, and provide for his people, without us!</P>
<P>Object. 4. Oh, but &s;aith another, it is my friends that are my afflicters: they di&s;claim me, and will &s;carce look at me; they cen&s;ure me, and backbite me, and &s;lander me, and look upon me with a di&s;dainful eye; if it were others, I could bear it, I look for no better from them: but when tho&s;e that are my delight, and that I looked for comfort and refre&s;hing from, when tho&s;e are as thorns in my &s;ides, who can bear it?</P>
<P>An&s;w. 1. Whoever is the in&s;trument, the affliction is from GOD, and the provoking cau&s;e from thy&s;elf: and were it not fitter that thou look more to GOD and thy&s;elf?</P>
<P N="2">2. Do&s;t thou not know, that good men are &s;till &s;in|ful in part? and that their hearts are naturally deceit|ful, and de&s;perately wicked, as well as others? Learn therefore a better le&s;&s;on from the prophet, <HI>Mich.</HI> vii. 5, 6, 7. <HI>Tru&s;t not</HI> (too much) <HI>in a friend, nor put confi|dence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bo&s;om: but look rather for the</HI> LORD, <HI>and wait for the</HI> GOD <HI>of thy &s;alvation.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. It is likely thou ha&s;t given that love and tru&s;t to men, which was due only to GOD; or which thou ha&s;t denied him: and then no wonder if he cha&s;ti&s;e thee by them. If we would u&s;e our friends as friends, GOD would make them our helps and comforts: but when once we make them our gods, by exce&s;&s;ive love and tru&s;t, then he &s;uffers them to be our accu&s;ers and tormentors: it is more &s;afe to me to have any crea|ture a &s;atan than a god: to be tormented by them than to idolize them.

<P>An&s;w. 1. The more you &s;uffer for righteou&s;ne&s;s-&s;ake, the more of this ble&s;&s;ing you may expect; and the more you &s;uffer for your own evil-doing, the longer you mu&s;t look to &s;tay till that &s;weetne&s;s come. When we have by our folly provoked GOD to cha&s;ti&s;e us, &s;hall we pre&s;ently look that he &s;hould fill us with comfort? <Q>That were (as Mr. <HI>Paul Bayn</HI> &s;aith) to make affliction to be no affliction.</Q> What good would the bitterne&s;s do us, if it be pre&s;ently drowned in that &s;weetne&s;s? It is well in &s;uch &s;ufferings, if you have but &s;upporting grace; and if your &s;ufferings are &s;anctified to work out your &s;in.</P>
<P N="2">2. Do you not neglect or re&s;i&s;t the comforts which you de&s;ire? GOD hath filled precepts and promi&s;es, and other of his providences, with matter of comfort: if you overlook all the&s;e, and ob&s;erve one cro&s;s more than a thou&s;and mercies, who maketh you uncomfort|able but your&s;elves?

<P N="3">3. Have your afflictions wrought kindly with you, and fitted you for comfort? Have they humbled you, and brought you to a faithful confe&s;&s;ion and reforma|tion of your beloved &s;in? and made you &s;et clo&s;e to your neglected duties? and weaned your hearts from their former idols? and brought them unfeignedly to take GOD for their portion and their re&s;t?

<P N="1">1. It is not to invade the office of the mini&s;try, and every man to turn a public preacher.

The time that &s;hould be employed in drawing men's &s;ouls from &s;in to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> is employed in drawing them to opinions and parties: when men are fallen in love with their own conceits, and think them&s;elves the wi&s;e&s;t, how diligently do they labour to get them followers? as if to make a man a pro&s;elyte to their opinions, were as happy a work as to convert him to <HI>Chri&s;t!</HI> and when they fall among the lighter, ignorant &s;ort of men, who&s;e reli|gion is all in the brain, and on their tongue, they

<P N="3">3. Nor do I per&s;uade you to &s;peak again&s;t men's faults behind their backs, and be &s;ilent before their faces, as the common cu&s;tom of the world is.

To whi&s;per men's faults to others, as it cometh not from love, or from an hone&s;t principle, &s;o u&s;ually doth it produce no good effect: for if the party hear not of it, it cannot better him; if he do, he will take it but as the reproach of an enemy, and not as the faithful coun&s;el of a friend, and as that which is &s;poken to make him odious, and not to make him virtuous; it tend|eth not to provoke to godline&s;s, but to rai&s;e conten|tion; for <HI>a whi&s;perer &s;eparateth chief friends.</HI> And how few &s;hall we find that make con&s;cience of this horrible &s;in? or that will confe&s;s it, and bewail it, when they are reprehended for it? e&s;pecially if men are &s;peaking of their enemies, or tho&s;e that have wronged them; or whom they &s;uppo&s;e to have wronged them, or if it be of one that eclip&s;eth their glory, or that &s;tandeth in the way of their gain or e&s;teem: or if it be one that differeth from them in judgment; or of one that is commonly &s;poke again&s;t by others; who is it that maketh any con&s;cience of back biting &s;uch as the&s;e? And you &s;hall ever ob&s;erve, that the forwarder they are to back biting, the more backward always to faithful admoni&s;hing; and none &s;peak le&s;s of a

<P>So far am I from per&s;uading therefore to this pre|po&s;terous cour&s;e, that I would advi&s;e you to oppo&s;e it wherever you meet with it. See that you never hear a man &s;peaking again&s;t his neighbour behind his back (without &s;ome &s;pecial cau&s;e or call) but pre&s;ently re|buke him: a&s;k him, whether he hath &s;poke tho&s;e things in a way of love to his face? if he hath not, a&s;k him, how he dare to pervert GOD'S pre&s;cribed or|der, who commandeth to rebuke our neighbour plain|ly, and to tell him his fault fir&s;t in private, and then before witne&s;s, till he &s;ee whether he will be won, or not? And how he dare do as he would not be done by?</P>
<P>The duty therefore that I would pre&s;s you to is of another nature, and it con&s;i&s;teth in the&s;e things fol|lowing:</P>

<P>But becau&s;e in all works the manner of doing them is of greate&s;t moment, and the right performance doth much further the &s;ucce&s;s; I will here adjoin a few di|rections, which you mu&s;t be &s;ure to ob&s;erve in this work of exhortation; for it is not every advice that u&s;eth to &s;ucceed, nor any manner of doing it that will &s;erve the turn. Ob&s;erve therefore the&s;e rules:</P>
<P N="1">1. Set upon the work &s;incerely, and with right in|tentions. Let thy end be the glory of GOD in the party's &s;alvation. Do it not to get a name or e&s;teem to thy&s;elf; or to bring men to depend upon thee; or to get thee many followers: do not as many pa|rents and ma&s;ters will do, <HI>viz.</HI> rebuke their children and &s;ervants for tho&s;e &s;ins that di&s;plea&s;e them, and are again&s;t their profit or their humours, as di&s;obedience, unthriftine&s;s, unmannerline&s;s; but never &s;eek in the right way that GOD hath appointed to &s;ave their &s;ouls. But be &s;ure, the main end be to recover them from mi&s;ery, and bring them into the way of eter|nal re&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. Do it &s;peedily: as you would not have them de|lay their return, &s;o do not thou delay to &s;eek their re|turn. You are purpo&s;ing long to &s;peak to &s;uch an ignorant neighbour, and to deal with &s;uch a &s;canda|lous
<PB N="202" REF="022331_0201_0FB7EFFAD2F4E3D8">&s;inner, and yet you have never done it. Alas, he runs on the &s;core all this while; he goes deeper in debt; wrath is heaping up; &s;in taketh rooting: cu&s;|tom doth more fa&s;ten him; engagements to &s;in grow &s;tronger and more numerous; con&s;cience grows &s;ear|ed; the heart grows hardened; while you delay, the devil rules and rejoiceth; <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is &s;hut out; the Spi|rit is repul&s;ed; GOD is daily di&s;honoured; his law is violated; he is without a &s;ervant, and that &s;ervice from him which he &s;hould have; time runs on; the day of vi&s;itation ha&s;teth; death and judgment are at the door: and what if the man die and mi&s;s of hea|ven, while you are purpo&s;ing to teach him and help him to it? If in ca&s;e of his bodly di&s;tre&s;s, you mu&s;t not bid him go and come again to-morrow, when you have it by you; how much le&s;s may you delay the &s;uccour of his &s;oul? if once death &s;natch him away he is then out of the reach of your charity. That phy&s;ician is no better than a murderer, that negligent|ly delayeth, till his patient be dead or pa&s;t cure. De|lay in duty is a great degree of di&s;obedience, though you afterwards perform it. It &s;hews an ill heart that is undi&s;po&s;ed to the work. O how many a poor &s;in|ner peri&s;heth or grows rooted, and next to incurable in &s;in, while we are purpo&s;ing to &s;eek their recovery! Opportunities la&s;t not always. When thou heare&s;t that the &s;inner is dead, or removed, or grown ob&s;ti|nate; will not con&s;cience &s;ay to thee, how knowe&s;t thou but thou mighte&s;t have prevented the damnation of a &s;oul? Lay by excu&s;es then, and all le&s;&s;er bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and obey GOD'S command, <HI>exhort one another daily, while it is called to-day, le&s;t any be hardined through the decei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fulne&s;s of &s;in.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Let thy exhortation proceed from compa&s;&s;ion and love, and let the manner of it clearly &s;hew the per&s;on thou deale&s;t with, that it does. It is not jeer|ing, or &s;corning, or reproaching a man for his fault,

Lay by your pa&s;&s;ion therefore, and go to poor &s;inners with tears in your eyes, that they may &s;ee you indeed believe them to be mi&s;erable; and that you un|feignedly pity their ca&s;e: deal with them with earn|e&s;t humble entreatings. Let them &s;ee that your very bowels yearn over them, and that it is the very de&s;ire of your hearts to do them good: let them perceive that you have no other end but the procuring their everla&s;ting happine&s;s; and that it is your &s;en&s;e of their danger, and your love to their &s;ouls that forces you to &s;peak; even becau&s;e you know the terrors of the LORD, and for fear le&s;t you &s;hould &s;ee them in eternal torments. Say to them, Why, friend, you know it is no advantage of my own that I &s;eek. The way to plea&s;e you, and to keep your friend&s;hip, were to &s;ooth you in your own way, or to let you alone; but love will not &s;uffer me to &s;ee you peri&s;h, and be &s;i|lent; I &s;eek nothing at your hands, but that which is nece&s;&s;ary to your own happine&s;s.

<P>I am a&s;hamed to hear &s;ome lazy hypocritical wretches revile their poor ignorant neighbours, and &s;eparate from their company, and judge them unfit for their &s;ociety, before ever they once tried them with this compa&s;&s;ionate exhortation! O you little know what a prevailing cour&s;e this were like to prove! And how few of the vile&s;t drunkards or &s;wear|ers would prove &s;o ob&s;tinate, as wholly to reject or de&s;pi&s;e the exhortations of love! I know it mu&s;t be
<PB N="204" REF="022331_0203_0FB7EFFFA9AE70D0">GOD that mu&s;t change men's hearts! but I know al&s;o that GOD worketh by means, and when he meaneth to prevail with men, he u&s;ually fitteth the means ac|cordingly, and &s;tirreth up men to plead with them in a prevailing way, and &s;o &s;etteth in with his grace, and maketh it &s;ucce&s;sful. Certainly, tho&s;e that have tried can tell you by experience, that there is no way &s;o prevailing with men, as the way of compa&s;&s;ion and love. So much of the&s;e as they di&s;cern in your ex|hortation, u&s;ually &s;o much doth it &s;ucceed with their hearts; and therefore I be&s;eech tho&s;e that are faith|ful, to practi&s;e this cour&s;e. Alas, we &s;ee mo&s;t peo|ple among us, yea tho&s;e that would &s;eem godly, can|not bear a reproof that comes not in meekne&s;s and love! if there be the lea&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, or reli&s;h of di&s;grace in it, they are ready to &s;pit in your face.

<P N="4">4. Another direction I would give you, is this: do it with all po&s;&s;ible plainne&s;s and faithfulne&s;s. Do not dally with men, and hide from them their mi&s;ery or danger, or any part of it. Do not make their &s;ins le&s;s than they are; nor &s;peak of them in extenuating language. Do not encourage them in a fal&s;e hope, no more than you would di&s;courage the found hopes of the righteous. If you &s;ee his ca&s;e dangerous, tell him plainly of it: Neighbour, I am afraid GOD hath not yet renewed your &s;oul; and that it is yet a &s;tran|ger
<PB N="205" REF="022331_0204_0FB7F00352700820">to the great work of regeneration and &s;anctifica|tion: I doubt you are not yet recovered from the power of Satan to GOD, nor brought out of the &s;tate of wrath which you were born in, and have lived in: I doubt you have not cho&s;en <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> above all, nor &s;et your heart upon him, nor unfeignedly taken him for your &s;overeign Lord. If you had, &s;ure you dur&s;t not &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;obey him: you could not &s;o neglect him and his wor&s;hip in your family and in public: you could not &s;o eagerly follow the world, and talk of al|mo&s;t nothing but the things of this world, while <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is &s;eldom mentioned by you. If you were in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> you would become a new creature; old things would be pa&s;&s;ed away, and all things would become new: you would have new thoughts, and new talk, and new company, and new endeavours, and a new conver&s;a|tion: certainly without the&s;e you can never be &s;aved: you may think otherwi&s;e, and hope better as long as you will, but your hopes will deceive you, and pe|ri&s;h with you. Alas! it is not as you will, nor as I will, who &s;hall be &s;aved, but it is a GOD will; and GOD hath told us, that <HI>without holine&s;s none &s;hall &s;ee him:</HI> and <HI>except we be born again, we cannot enter into his kingdom.</HI> And <HI>that all that would not have Chri&s;t to reign over them, &s;hall be brought forth and de&s;troyed before him:</HI> O therefore look to your &s;tate in time.</P>
<P>Thus mu&s;t you deal roundly and faithfully with men, if ever you intend to do them good. It is not hovering at a di&s;tance in a general di&s;cour&s;e that will &s;erve the turn: it is not in curing men's &s;ouls, as in curing their bodies, where they mu&s;t not know their danger, le&s;t it &s;adden them, and hinder the cure. They are here agents in their own cure, and if they know not their mi&s;ery, they will never bewail it, nor know how much need they have of a Saviour: if they know not the wor&s;t, they will not labour to prevent it; but will &s;it &s;till or loiter till they drop into per|dition,
<PB N="206" REF="022331_0205_0FB7F005EA0D4240">and will trifle out their time till it be too late: and therefore &s;peak to men, as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to the Phari&s;ees, till they knew that he meant them. Deal plainly, or you do but deceive and de&s;troy them.</P>
<P N="5">5. And as you mu&s;t do it plainly, &s;o al&s;o &s;eriou&s;ly, zealou&s;ly, and effectually. The exceeding &s;tupidity and deadne&s;s of men's hearts is &s;uch, that no other dealing will ordinarily work. You mu&s;t call loud to awake a man in a &s;woon or lethargy. If you &s;peak to the common &s;ort of men, of the evil of their &s;in, of their need of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> of the danger of their &s;ouls, and of the nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration, they will wearily and unwillingly give you the hearing, and put off all with a &s;igh, or a few good wi&s;hes, and &s;ay, GOD <HI>forgive us, we are all &s;inners,</HI> and there is an end. If ever you will do them good therefore, you mu&s;t &s;harp|en your exhortation, and &s;et it home, and follow it, till you have rouzed them up, and made them begin to look about them. Let them know that thou &s;peak|e&s;t not to them of indifferent things, nor about chil|dren's games, or matters of a few days or years con|tinuance, nor yet about matters of uncertainty, which may never come to pa&s;s: but it is about the &s;aving and damning of their &s;ouls and bodies; and whether they &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed with <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or tormented with devils, and that for-ever and ever; it is, how to &s;tand before GOD in judgment, and what an&s;wer to give, and how they are like to &s;peed; and this judgment and eternal &s;tate they &s;hall very &s;hortly &s;ee, they are almo&s;t at it; yet a few more nights and days, and they &s;hall be at that la&s;t day: a few more breaths, they have to breathe, and they &s;hall breathe their la&s;t; and then as certainly &s;hall they &s;ee that mighty change, as the heaven is over their heads, and the earth under their feet. O labour to make men know, that it is mad je&s;ting about &s;alvation or damnation; and that heaven and hell are not matters to be played with, or

It is mo&s;t certain that one of the&s;e days thou &s;halt be either in everla&s;ting, unchangeable joy or torment; and doth it not awake thee? Are there &s;o few that find the way of death? Is it &s;o hard to e&s;cape? &s;o ea&s;y to mi&s;carry? And that wile we fear nothing, but think all is well? And yet you &s;it &s;till and trifle! Why, what do you mean? What do you think on? The world is pa&s;&s;ing away: its plea&s;ures are fading: its honours are leav|ing you: its profits will prove unprofitable to you: heaven or hell are a little before you: GOD is ju&s;t, and jealous; his threatenings are true: the great day of his judgment will be terrible: your time runs on: your lives are uncertain: you are far behind hand: you have loitered long: your ca&s;e is dangerous: your &s;ouls are far gone in &s;in: you are &s;trange to GOD: you are hardened in evil cu&s;toms: you have no a&s;&s;urance of comfort to &s;hew: if you die to-mor|row, how unready a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> you! And with what terror will your &s;ouls go out of your bodies! And do you yet loiter?

What! had you rather lo&s;e heaven than your profits or plea&s;ures? Had you rather burn in hell, than repent on earth? Had you rather howl and roar there, than pray day and night for mercy here? Or have devils your tormentors, than <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> your gover|nor? Will you renounce your part in GOD and glory, rather than renounce your &s;ins? Do you think a holy life too much for heaven: or too dear a cour&s;e to pre|vent endle&s;s mi&s;ery? Oh friends, what do you think
<PB N="208" REF="022331_0207_0FB7F00A9ACD4848">of the&s;e things? GOD hath made you men, and en|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed you with rea&s;on: do you renounce your rea&s;on where you &s;hould chiefly u&s;e it? In this manner you mu&s;t deal roundly and &s;eriou&s;ly with men. Alas! it is not a few dull words between je&s;t and earne&s;t, be|tween &s;leep and waking, as it were, that will waken an ignorant dead-hearted &s;inner. When a dull hearer, and a dull &s;peaker meet together, a dead heart, and a dead exhortation; it is unlike to have a lively effect. If a man fall down in a &s;woon, you will not &s;tand trifling with him, but lay hands on him pre&s;ently, and &s;natch him up, and rub him, and call aloud to him: if a hou&s;e be on fire, you will not in a cold &s;train go to tell your neighbour of it, or make an oration of the nature and danger of fire; but you will run out and cry, fire, fire: matters of moment mu&s;t be &s;eriou&s;|ly dealt with. To tell a man of his &s;ins &s;o &s;oftly as <HI>Eli</HI> did his &s;ons, or reprove him &s;o gently as <HI>Jeho&s;ha|phat</HI> did <HI>Ahab, Let not the king &s;ay &s;o,</HI> doth u&s;ually as much harm as good. I am per&s;uaded the very man|ner of &s;ome men's reproof and exhortation, hath hard|ened many a &s;inner in the way of de&s;truction. To tell them of &s;in, or of heaven or hell, in a dull, ea&s;y, carele&s;s language, doth make men think you are not in good earne&s;t; but &s;carce think your&s;elves &s;uch things are true. O &s;irs, deal with &s;in as &s;in, and &s;peak of heaven and hell as they are, and not as if you were in je&s;t. I confe&s;s I have failed much in this my&s;elf, the LORD lay it not to my charge! Lothne&s;s to di&s;|plea&s;e men, makes us undo them.</P>
<P N="6">6. Yet le&s;t you run into extremes, I advi&s;e you to do it with di&s;cretion. Be as &s;erious as you can; but yet with wi&s;dom. And e&s;pecially you mu&s;t be wi&s;e in the&s;e things following:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. In choo&s;ing the fitte&s;t &s;ea&s;on for your exhortati|on; not to deal with men when they are in a pa&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="209" REF="022331_0208_0FB7F00C11819910">or where they will take it for a di&s;grace. Men &s;hould ob&s;erve, when &s;inners are fitte&s;t to hear in&s;tructions. Phy&s;ic mu&s;t not be given at all times, but in &s;ea&s;on. It is an excellent example that <HI>Paul</HI> giveth us, <HI>Gal.</HI> ii. 2. He communicated the go&s;pel to them, yet privately to them of reputation, le&s;t he &s;hould run in vain. Some men would take this to be a &s;inful complying with their corruption, to yield &s;o far to their pride and ba&s;hfulne&s;s, as to teach them only in private, be|cau&s;e they would be a&s;hamed to own the truth in pub|lic: but <HI>Paul</HI> knew how great a hinderance men's re|putation is to their entertaining of the truth, and that the remedy mu&s;t not only be fitted to the di&s;ea&s;e, but al&s;o to the &s;trength of the patient, and that in &s;o do|ing, the phy&s;ician is not guilty of favouring the di&s;ea&s;e, but is prai&s;e-worthy for taking the right way to cure. Means will work ea&s;ily if you take the op|portunity; when the earth is &s;oft, the plough will en|ter. Take a man when he is under affliction, or in the hou&s;e of mourning, or newly &s;tirred by &s;ome moving &s;ermon, and then &s;et it home, and you may do him &s;ome good. Chri&s;tian faithfulne&s;s doth re|quire us, not only to do good when it falls in our way, but to watch for opportunities.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Be wi&s;e al&s;o in &s;uiting your exhortation to the quality and temper of the per&s;on. All meats are not for all &s;tomachs: one man will vomit that up which another will dige&s;t.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. If it be a learned, or ingeni|ous rational man, you mu&s;t deal more by convincing arguments, and le&s;s by pa&s;&s;ionate per&s;ua&s;ions.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. If it be one that is both ignorant and &s;tupid, there is need of both.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. If one that is convinced, but not converted, you mu&s;t u&s;e mo&s;t tho&s;e means that roa&s;e the affections.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. If they be ob&s;tinate and &s;ecure, you mu&s;t reprove them &s;harply.</ITEM>

<ITEM>3. You mu&s;t be wi&s;e al&s;o in u&s;ing the apte&s;t expre&s;&s;i|ons. Many a mini&s;ter doth deliver mo&s;t excellent mat|ter in &s;uch har&s;h and un&s;eeming language, that it makes the hearers loath the food that they &s;hould live by, and laugh at a &s;ermon that might make them quake: e&s;pe|cially if they be men of curious ears, and carnal hearts, and have more wit and parts than the &s;peaker. And &s;o it is in private <HI>exhortation</HI> as well as public: if you clothe the mo&s;t amiable truth in the &s;ordid rags of un|be&s;eeming language, you will make men di&s;dain it, though it be the offspring of GOD, and of the highe&s;t nature.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Let all your reproofs and exhortations be backed with the authority of GOD. Let the &s;inner be con|vinced that you &s;peak not from your&s;elves or of your own head. Shew them the very words of &s;cripture for what you &s;ay: pre&s;s them with the truth and autho|rity of GOD; a&s;k them, Whether they believe that this is his word, and that his word is true. So much of GOD as appeareth in our words, &s;o much will they take. The voice of man is contemptible: but the voice of GOD is awful and terrible. Be &s;ure therefore to make them know, that you &s;peak nothing but what GOD hath &s;poken fir&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. You mu&s;t al&s;o be frequent with men in this du|ty of <HI>exhortation;</HI> it is not once or twice that u&s;ually will prevail. If GOD him&s;elf mu&s;t be con&s;tan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly &s;o|licited, as if importunity could prevail with him when nothing el&s;e can; and therefore requires us <HI>always to fray, and not to &s;aint:</HI> the &s;ame cour&s;e, no doubt, will be mo&s;t provailing with men. Therefore we are commanded, <HI>to exhort one another daily,</HI> and <HI>with all long-&s;uffering: the fire is not always brought out of
<PB N="211" REF="022331_0210_0FB7F00FE363A1A0">the flint at one &s;troke: nor men's affections kindled at the fir&s;t exhortation.</HI> And if they were, yet if they be not followed, they will &s;oon grow cold again. Weary out &s;inners with your loving and earne&s;t entreaties; follow them, and give them no re&s;t in their &s;in. This is true charity, and this is the way to &s;ave men's &s;ouls; and a cour&s;e that will afford you comfort upon a re|view.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Strive to bring all your exhortations to an i&s;&s;ue; &s;tick not in the work done, but look after the &s;ucce&s;s. I have long ob&s;erved it in mini&s;ters and private men, that if they &s;peak never &s;o convincing words, and yet all their care is over when they have done their &s;peech, pretending that having done their duty, they leave the i&s;&s;ue to GOD: the&s;e men &s;eldom pro&s;per in their la|bours: but tho&s;e who&s;e very heart is &s;et upon the work, and that long to &s;ee it take for the hearers con|ver&s;ion, and u&s;e to enquire how it &s;peeds, GOD u&s;u|ally ble&s;&s;eth their labours, though more weak. La|bour therefore to drive all your &s;peeches to the de&s;ired i&s;&s;ue. If you are reproving &s;in, cea&s;e not till (if it may be) you have got the &s;inner to promi&s;e you to leave it, and to avoid the occa&s;ions of it: if you are exhorting to a duty, urge the party to promi&s;e you pre&s;ently to &s;et upon it. If you would draw them to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> leave not, till you have made them confe&s;s, that their pre&s;ent &s;tate is mi&s;erable, and not to be re&s;ted in: and till they have &s;ub&s;cribed to the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of a change; and promi&s;ed you to fall clo&s;e to the u&s;e of means. O that all chri&s;tians would be per|&s;uaded to take this cour&s;e with all their neighbours that are yet en&s;laved to &s;in, and &s;trangers to <HI>Chri&s;t!</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>7. La&s;tly, Be &s;ure your example exhort as well as your words. Let them &s;ee you con&s;tant in all the duties you per&s;uade them to: let them &s;ee in your lives that excellency above the world, which you per|&s;uade

</LIST>
<P>And thus I have opened to you the fir&s;t and great part of this duty, con&s;i&s;ting in private exhortation, for the helping of poor &s;ouls to this re&s;t, that have yet no title to it; and I have &s;hewed you al&s;o the manner how to perform it. I will now &s;peak a little of the next part.</P>
<P N="1">1. Be&s;ides the duty of private admonition, you mu&s;t do your utmo&s;t endeavours to help men to profit by the public ordinances. And to that end, Fir&s;t, do your endeavours for the procuring of faithful mini&s;ters where they are wanting. This is GOD'S ordinary means of converting and &s;aving. <HI>How &s;hall they hear without a preacher?</HI> Not only for your own &s;akes herefore, but for the poor mi&s;erable ones about you, do all you can to bring this to pa&s;s. Improve all your intere&s;t and diligence to this end. Ride, and go, and &s;eek, and make friends till you prevail. Who knoweth how many &s;ouls may ble&s;s you, who have been converted by the mini&s;try which you have procured? It is an higher and nobler work of charity, than if you gave all that you have to relieve their bodies.</P>
<P>How &s;mall a matter were it (and yet how excellent a work) for every gentleman of means in <HI>England,</HI> to cull out &s;ome one or two, or more poor boys in the country &s;chools, who are the choice&s;t wits, and of the mo&s;t pious di&s;po&s;itions, who are poor and unable to proceed in learning; and to maintain them till they are &s;it for the mini&s;try? It were but keeping a few &s;uperfluous attendants the le&s;s, if they had hearts to it, it were ea&s;ily &s;pared out of their rich apparel, or &s;uperfluous diet, I dare &s;ay, they would not be &s;orry for it when they come to their reckoning: one &s;ump|tuous
<PB N="213" REF="022331_0212_0FB7F013D9EC1008">fea&s;t, or one co&s;tly &s;uit of apparel, would maintain a poor boy a year or two at the univer&s;ity, who perhaps might come to have more true worth in him, than many a glittering lord, and to do GOD more &s;ervice in his church, than ever they did with all their e&s;tates and power.</P>
<P N="2">2. And when you enjoy the ble&s;&s;ing of the go&s;pel, you mu&s;t yet u&s;e your utmo&s;t diligence to help poor &s;ould to receive the fruit of it. To which end you mu&s;t draw them con&s;tantly to hear and attend it: mind them often of what they have heard: draw them if it be po&s;&s;ible, to repeat it in their families; if that cannot be, then draw them to come to others that do repeat it; that &s;o it may not die in the hearing. The very drawing of men into the company and acquaint|a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of the good man, be&s;ides the benefit they have by their endeavours, is of &s;ingular u&s;e to the recove|ry of their &s;ouls. It is a means to take off prejudice, by confuting the world's &s;landers of the ways and people of GOD.

<P N="3">3. One thing more I advi&s;e you: if you would have &s;ouls &s;aved by the ordinances, labour &s;till to keep
<PB N="214" REF="022331_0213_0FB7F0152B57B400">the ordinances and mini&s;try in e&s;teem, No man will be much wrought on by that which he de&s;pi&s;eth. I &s;hall confirm you herein, not in my own words, but in his that I know you dare not di&s;regard, 1 The&s;. v. 11, 12, 13. <HI>Wherefore comfort your&s;elves together, and edify one another, even as ye al&s;o do: and we be&s;eech you brethren to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admoni&s;h you, and to e&s;teem them very highly in love for their work's &s;ake; and be at peace among your&s;elves. Obey them that have the rule ever you, and &s;ubmit your&s;elves; for they watch for your &s;ouls, as tho&s;e that mu&s;t give an account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you,</HI> Heb. xiii. 17.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee part of your duty for the &s;alvation of others.</P>
<P>But where &s;hall we find the man, that &s;etteth him|&s;elf to it with all his might, and that hath &s;et his heart upon the &s;ouls of his brethren, that they may be &s;aved.</P>
<P>Let us here a little enquire, what may be the cau&s;es of the gro&s;s neglect of this duty, that the hinderan|ces being di&s;covered, may the more ea&s;ily be over|come.</P>
<P N="1">1. One hinderance, is, men's own &s;infulne&s;s and guiltine&s;s. They have not been ravi&s;hed them&s;elves with the heavenly delights: how then &s;hould they draw others to &s;eek them? They have not felt the wickedne&s;s of their own nature, nor their loft con|dition, nor their need of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> nor felt the renew|ing work of the Spirit: how then can they di&s;cover the&s;e to others? Ah that this were not the ca&s;e of many a learned preacher in <HI>England!</HI> And the cau&s;e why they preach &s;o frozenly! Men al&s;o are guilty
<PB N="215" REF="022331_0214_0FB7F016AE4542B8">them&s;elves of the &s;ins they &s;hould reprove; and this &s;tops their mouths, and maketh them a&s;hamed to re|prove.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another hinderance, is, a &s;ecret infidelity pre|vailing in men's hearts: Alas, &s;irs, we do not &s;ure believe men's mi&s;ery; we do not believe &s;ure the threatenings of GOD are true. Did we verily believe that all the uregenerate and unholy &s;hall be eternally tormented, oh how could we hold our tongues when we are among the unregenerate: how could we cho&s;e but bur&s;t out into tears when we look them in the face, as the prophet did when he looked upon <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">za|el?</HI> E&s;pecially when they are our kindred or friends that are near and dear to us? Thus doth &s;ecret unbe|lief con&s;ume the vigour of each grace and duty. Oh chri&s;tians, if you did verily believe that your poor neighbour, or wife, or hu&s;band, or child, &s;hould cer|tainly lie for-ever in the flames of hell, except they be thoroughly changed, before death doth &s;natch them hence, would not this make you ca&s;t off all di&s;cou|ragements, and lie at them day and night till they were per&s;uaded? How could you hold your tongue, or let them alone another day, if this were &s;oundly be|lieved? If you were &s;ure that any of your dear friends that are dead, were now in hell, and per&s;uading to repentance would get him out again, would not you per&s;uade him day and night if he were in hearing? And why &s;hould you not do as much then to prevent it, while he is in your hearing, but that you do not believe GOD'S word that &s;peaks the danger? Oh were it not for this cur&s;ed unbelief, our own &s;ouls and our neighbour's would gain more by us than they do.</P>
<P N="3">3. This faithful dealing with men for their &s;alva|tion, is much hindered al&s;o by our want of compa&s;&s;ion to men's &s;ouls. We are hard-hearted and cruel to|ward the mi&s;erable; and therefore (as the prie&s;t and
<PB N="216" REF="022331_0215_0FB7F01808421320">the Levite did by the wounded man) we look on them and pa&s;s by. O what tender hearts could endure to look upon a poor, blind, forlorn &s;inner, wounded by &s;in and captivated by Satan, and never once open their mouths for his recovery! What though he be &s;ilent, and do not de&s;ire thy help? yet his mi&s;ery cries aloud; mi&s;ery is the mo&s;t effectual &s;uitor to one that is com|pa&s;&s;ionate: if GOD had not heard the cry of our mi&s;e|ries before he heard the cry of our prayers, and been moved by his own pity, before he was moved by our importunity, we might have long enough continued the &s;laves of Satan. Alas, what pitiful &s;ights do we daily &s;ee! The ignorant, the profane, the neglecters of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and their &s;ouls: their &s;ores are open and vi&s;i|ble to all; and yet we do not pity them. You will pray to GOD for them, in cu&s;tomary duties, that GOD would open the eyes, and turn the hearts of your friends and neighbours: and why do you not en|deavour their conver&s;ion if you de&s;ire it? and if you do not de&s;ire it, why do you a&s;k it? Doth not your negligence convince you of hypocri&s;y in your prayers, and of abu&s;ing the mo&s;t high GOD with your deceit|ful words? Your neighbours are near you, your friends are in the hou&s;e with you, you eat, and drink, and work, and walk, and talk with them, and yet you &s;ay little or nothing to them. Why do you not pray them to con&s;ider and return, as well as pray GOD to convert and turn them? Have you as oft begged of them to think on their ways, and to reform, as you have taken on you to beg of GOD that they may &s;o do? What if you &s;hould &s;ee your neighbour fallen into a pit, and you &s;hould pre&s;ently fall down on your knees, and pray GOD to help him out, but would neither put forth your hand to help him, nor once per&s;uade or direct him to help him&s;elf, would not any man cen&s;ure you to be cruel and hypocritical? What the Holy Gho&s;t &s;aith of men's bodily mi&s;eries, I may &s;ay much more of the mi&s;ery of their &s;ouls; <HI>If any man
<PB N="217" REF="022331_0216_0FB7F01BD82C04D0">&s;eeth his brother in need, and &s;hutteth up his compa&s;&s;ion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</HI> Or what love hath he to his brother's &s;oul? The charity of our ignorant fore-fathers may ri&s;e up in judgment again&s;t us, and condemn us: they would give all their e&s;tates almo&s;t, for &s;o many ma&s;&s;es or pardons, to deliver the &s;ouls of their friends from a feigned purgatory: and we will not as much as admoni&s;h and entreat them, to &s;ave them from the certain flames of hell.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another hinderance, is, a ba&s;e man-plea&s;ing di&s;|po&s;ition that is in us. We are &s;o loth to di&s;plea&s;e men, and &s;o de&s;irous to keep in credit and favour with them, that it makes us neglect our own duty. A fooli&s;h phy&s;ician he is, and a mo&s;t unfaithfal friend, that will let a &s;ick man die for fear of troubling him. And cruel wretches are we to our friends that will rather &s;uffer them to go quickly to hell, than we will anger them, or hazard our reputation with them. If they did but fall in a &s;woon, we would rub them and pinch them, and never &s;tick at hurting them. If they were di&s;tracted, we would bind them with chains, and we would plea&s;e them in nothing that tended to their hurt. And yet when they are be&s;ide them&s;elves in point of &s;alvation, and in their madne&s;s po&s;ting on to damnation, we will not &s;top them, for fear of di&s;plea&s;ing them. <HI>How can the&s;e men be chri&s;tians, that love the prai&s;e and favour of men, more than the &s;avour of God?</HI> John xii. 43. <HI>For if they yet &s;eek to plea&s;e m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, they are no longer the &s;ervants of Chri&s;t,</HI> Gal. i. 10. To win them indeed they mu&s;t become all things to all men: but to plea&s;e them to their de|&s;truction, and let them peri&s;h, that we may keep our credit with them, is a cour&s;e &s;o ba&s;e and barba|rou&s;ly cruel, that he that hath the face of a chri&s;tian &s;hould abhor it.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="218" REF="022331_0217_0FB7F01E55C7D610">
5. Another common hinderance, is, a &s;inful ba&s;h|fulne&s;s. When we &s;hould labour to make men a&s;ham|ed of their &s;ins, we are our&s;elves a&s;hamed of our du|ties. May not the&s;e &s;inners condemn us, when they will not blu&s;h to &s;wear or be drunk, and we blu&s;h to tell them of it, and per&s;uade them from it? Sinners will boa&s;t of their &s;ins, and &s;hew them in the open &s;treets: and &s;hall not we be as bold in drawing them from &s;in? Not that I would have inferiors forget their di&s;tance in admoni&s;hing their &s;uperiors; but do it with all humility, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and re&s;pect. But yet I would much le&s;s have them forget their duty to GOD and their friends, be they never &s;o much their &s;uperiors: it is a thing that mu&s;t be done. Ba&s;hful|ne&s;s is un&s;eemly in ca&s;es of flat nece&s;&s;ity. And in|deed it is not a work to be a&s;hamed of; to obey GOD in per&s;uading men from their &s;ins to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and help|ing to &s;ave their &s;ouls, is not a bu&s;ine&s;s for a man to blu&s;h at. Yet, alas, what abundance of &s;ouls have been neglected through the prevailing of this &s;in! Even the mo&s;t of us are heinou&s;ly guilty in this point. Reader! is not this thy own ca&s;e? Hath not thy con|&s;cience told thee of thy duty many a time, and put thee on to &s;peak to poor &s;inners, le&s;t they peri&s;h? And yet thou ha&s;t been a&s;hamed to open thy mouth to them, and &s;o let them alone to &s;ink or &s;wim; be|lieve me thou wilt ere long be a&s;hamed of this &s;hame: O read tho&s;e words of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and tremble: <HI>He that is a&s;hamed of me and of my words, before this adulterous generation, of him will the Son of Man be a&s;hamed be|fore his Father and the angels.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. With many al&s;o pride is a great impediment. If it were to &s;peak to a great man, they would do it, &s;o it would not di&s;plea&s;e him. But to go among a company of ignorant beggars, or mean per&s;ons, and to &s;it with them in a &s;moaky na&s;ly cottage, and there to exhort them from day to day; where is the per&s;on
<PB N="219" REF="022331_0218_0FB7F020486B3660">that will do it? Many will much rejoice if they have been in&s;truments of converting a gentleman (and they have good cau&s;e) but for the common multitude, they look not after them: as if GOD were a re&s;pecter of the per&s;ons of the rich, or the &s;ouls of all were not alike to him. Alas, the&s;e men little con&s;ider how long <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did &s;toop to us! When the GOD of glo|ry comes down in fle&s;h to worms, and goeth preach|ing up and down among them from city to city. Not the &s;illie&s;t women that he thought too low to confer with: few rich, and noble, and wi&s;e are called. It is the poor that receive the glad tidings of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Object. O but, &s;aith one, I am of &s;o weak parts, that I am unable to manage an exhortation; e&s;peci|ally to men of &s;trong parts and under&s;tanding.</P>
<P><HI>I an&s;wer,</HI> 1. Set tho&s;e upon the work who are more able. 2. Yet do not think that thou art &s;o ex|cu&s;ed thy&s;elf, but u&s;e faithfully that ability which thou ha&s;t; not in teaching tho&s;e of whom thou &s;hould&s;t learn, but in in&s;tructing tho&s;e that are more ignorant than thy&s;elf, and in exhorting tho&s;e that are negli|gent in the things which they do know. If you can|not &s;peak well your&s;elf, yet you can tell them what GOD &s;peaketh in his word. It is not the excellency of &s;peech that winneth the &s;ouls; but the authority of GOD manife&s;ted by that &s;peech, and the power of his word in the mouth of the in&s;tructor. A weak wo|man may tell what GOD &s;aith in the plain pa&s;&s;ages of the word, as well as a learned man. If you cannot preach to them, yet you can &s;ay. Thus it is written. One of mean parts may remember the wi&s;e&s;t of their duty when they forget it.</P>
<P>Object. It is my &s;uperior: and is it &s;it for me to teach or reprove my betters? Mu&s;t the wife teach the hu&s;band, of whom the &s;cripture biddeth them learn?
<PB N="220" REF="022331_0219_0FB7F0254E704230">Or mu&s;t the child teach the parents, who&s;e duty it is to teach them?</P>
<P><HI>I an&s;wer,</HI> 1. It is &s;it that hu&s;bands &s;hould be able to touch their wives, and parents to teach their children; and GOD expecteth they &s;hould be &s;o, and therefore commandeth the in&s;eriors to learn of them. But if they through their negligence di&s;able them&s;elves, or through their wickedne&s;s bring their &s;ouls into &s;uch mi&s;ery, then it is them&s;elves, and not you, that break GOD's order, by bringing them&s;elves into di&s;ability and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Matter of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers and manners mu&s;t be di&s;pen|&s;ed with in ca&s;es of &s;lat nece&s;&s;ity. Though it were your mini&s;ter, you mu&s;t teach him in &s;uch a ca&s;e. It is the part of parents to provide for their children, and not children for their parents: and yet if the parents fall into want, mu&s;t not the children relieve them? It is the part of the hu&s;band to di&s;po&s;e of the affairs of the family and e&s;tate: and yet if he be &s;ick and be&s;ide him&s;elf, mu&s;t not the wi&s;e do it? The rich &s;hould relieve the poor: but if the rich fall into beggary, they mu&s;t be relieved them&s;elves. It is the work of a phy&s;ician to look to the health of others: and, yet if he fall &s;ick, &s;ome body mu&s;t help him. So mu&s;t the meane&s;t &s;ervant admoni&s;h his ma&s;ter, and the child his parent, and the wi&s;e her hu&s;band, and the people their mini&s;ters, in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity. Yet &s;econdly, let me give you the&s;e two cautions here.</P>
<P N="1">1. That you do not pretend nece&s;&s;ity when there is none, out of a mere de&s;ire of teaching. There is &s;carce a more certain di&s;covery of a proud heart, than to be more de&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">us to teach, than to learn; e&s;pecially to|ward tho&s;e that are fitter to teach us.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="221" REF="022331_0220_0FB7F0270C40A478">
2. And when the nece&s;&s;ity of your &s;uperiors doth call for your advice, yet do it with all po&s;&s;ible humi|lity, mode&s;ty, and meekne&s;s. Let them di&s;cern your reverence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in the humble manner of your addre&s;&s;es to them. Let them perceive that you do it not out of a mere teaching humour, or proud &s;elf-con|ceitedne&s;s. If a wife &s;hould tell her hu&s;band of &s;in in a ma&s;terly railing language; or if a &s;ervant reprove his ma&s;ter, or a child his father in a &s;aucy way, what good could be expected from &s;uch reproof? But if they &s;hould meekly and humbly open to him his &s;in and danger, and entreat him to bear with them in what GOD commandeth, and if they could by tears te&s;tify their &s;en&s;e of his ca&s;e: what father, or ma&s;ter, or hu&s;band could take this ill?</P>
<P>Object. But &s;ome may &s;ay, this will make all as preachers, and cau&s;e all to break over the bounds of their callings.</P>
<P><HI>I an&s;wer,</HI> 1. This is not taking a pa&s;toral charge of &s;ouls, nor making an office or calling of it, as preachers do.</P>
<P N="2">2. And in the way of our callings, every good chri&s;tian is a teacher, and hath a charge of his neigh|bour's &s;oul. Let it be only the voice of a <HI>Cain</HI> to &s;ay, <HI>Am I my brother's keeper?</HI> I would one of the&s;e men, that are &s;o loth that private men &s;hould teach them, to tell me, what if a man fall down in a &s;woon in the &s;treets, though it be your father or &s;uperior, would you not take him up pre&s;ently, and u&s;e all means to recover him? Or would you let him lie and die, and &s;ay, it is the work of the phy&s;ician, and not mine: I will not invade the phy&s;ician's calling. In two ca&s;es every man is a phy&s;ician; fir&s;t, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, and when a phy&s;ician cannot be had: and &s;econdly, in ca&s;e the hurt be &s;o &s;mall, that every man can do as
<PB N="222" REF="022331_0221_0FB7F028909D5390">well as the phy&s;ician. And in the &s;ame two ca&s;es, every man mu&s;t be a teacher.</P>
<P>Object. Some will further object, to put off this du|ty, that the party is &s;o ignorant, or &s;tupid, or care|le&s;s, or rooted in &s;in, and hath been &s;o oft exhorted in vain, that there is no hope.</P>
<P><HI>I an&s;wer,</HI> How know you when there is no hope? Cannot GOD yet cure him? And have not many as far gone been cured? Should not a merciful phy&s;ici|an u&s;e means while there is life? and is it not inhuman cruelty in you to give up your friend to the devil as hopele&s;s, upon mere backwardne&s;s to your duty, or upon groundle&s;s di&s;couragements? What if you had been &s;o given up your&s;elf when you were ignorant?</P>
<P>Object. <HI>But we mu&s;t not ca&s;t pearls before &s;wine, nor give that which is holy to dogs.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I an&s;wer,</HI> That is but a favourable di&s;pen&s;ation of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for your own &s;afety. When you are in danger of being torn in pieces, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> would have you for|bear: but what is that to you that are in no &s;uch danger? As long as they will hear, you have encou|ragement to &s;peak, and may not ca&s;t them off as con|temptuous &s;wine.</P>
<P>Object. O but it is a friend that I have all my de|pendence on; and by telling him of his &s;in and mi&s;ery, I may lo&s;e his love, and &s;o be undone.</P>
<P><HI>I an&s;wer,</HI> Sure no man that hath the face of a chri&s;tian, will for &s;hame own &s;uch an objection as this. Yet. I doubt, it oft prevaileth in the heart. Is his love more to be valued than his &s;afety? Or thy own benefit by him than the &s;alvation of his &s;oul? Or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lt thou connive at his damnation, becau&s;e he is
<PB N="223" REF="022331_0222_0FB7F02ACEE53798">thy friend? Is that thy be&s;t requital of his friend&s;hip? Had&s;t thou rather he &s;hould burn for-ever in hell, than thou &s;hould&s;t lo&s;e his favour, or the maintenance thou ha&s;t from him?</P>
<P>To conclude this u&s;e, that I may prevail with every &s;oul that feareth GOD, to u&s;e their utmo&s;t diligence to help all about them to this ble&s;&s;ed re&s;t, let me en|treat you to con&s;ider the&s;e following motives:</P>
<P N="1">1. Con&s;ider, nature teacheth the communicating of good, and grace doth e&s;pecially di&s;po&s;e the &s;oul thereto; the neglect therefore of this work, is a &s;in both again&s;t nature and grace.</P>
<P>Would you not think that man or woman unnatural, that would let their children or neighbours fami&s;h in the &s;treets, while they have provi&s;ion at hand? And is not he more unnatural, that will let his children or neighbours peri&s;h eternally, and will not open his mouth to &s;ave them? Certainly this is mo&s;t barbarous cruelty. We account an unmerciful, cruel man, a ve|ry mon&s;ter, to be abhorred of all. Many vicious men are too much loved in the world, but a cruel man is abhorred of all. Now that it may appear to you what a cruel thing this neglect of &s;ouls is, do but con&s;ider the&s;e two things. Fir&s;t, how great a work it is. Secondly, how &s;mall a matter it is that thou refu&s;e&s;t to do for the accompli&s;hing &s;o great a work. Fir&s;t, it is to &s;ave thy brother from eternal flames, that he may not there lie roaring in endle&s;s remedile&s;s tor|ments. It is to bring him to the everla&s;ting re&s;t, where he may live in inconceivable happine&s;s with GOD. Secondly, and what is it that you &s;hould do to help him herein? Why, it is to per&s;uade him, and lay open to him his &s;in, and his duty, his mi&s;ery, and the remedy, till you have made him willing to yield to the offers and commands of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> And is this &s;o
<PB N="224" REF="022331_0223_0FB7F02EDB1238B8">great a matter for to do, to the attaining &s;uch a ble&s;|&s;ed end? Is not the &s;oul of a hu&s;band, or wife, or child, or neighbour, worth a few words? It is worth this, or it is worth nothing. If they lay dying in the &s;treets, and a few words would &s;ave their lives, would not every man &s;ay, he was a cruel wretch that would let them peri&s;h rather than &s;peak to them? Even the covetous hypocrite, that <HI>James</HI> reproveth, would give a few words to the poor, and &s;ay, <HI>Go and be warmed, and be clothed.</HI> What a barbarous, unmerciful wretch then art thou, that wilt not vouch&s;afe a few words of &s;erious, &s;ober admonition, to &s;ave the &s;oul of thy neighbour or friend? Cruelty and unmercifulne&s;s to men's bodies, is a mo&s;t damnable &s;in; but to their &s;ouls much more, as the &s;oul is of greater worth than the body, and as eternity is of greater moment than this &s;hort time.</P>
<P>Alas! you do not &s;ee or feel what ca&s;e their &s;ouls are in, when they are in hell, for want of your faith|ful admonition. Little know you what many a &s;oul may now be feeling, who have been your neighbours and acquaintance, and died in their &s;ins, on whom you never be&s;towed one hour's &s;ober advice for pre|venting their unhappine&s;s. If you knew their mi&s;ery, you would now do more to bring them out of hell: but, alas! it is too late, you &s;hould have done it while they were with you; it is now too late. As one &s;aid of phy&s;icians, <Q>That they were the mo&s;t happy men, becau&s;e all their good deeds and cures were &s;een above ground to their prai&s;e, but all their mi&s;takes and neglects were buried out of &s;ight.</Q> So I may &s;ay to you, many a neglect of yours to the &s;ouls about you, may be now buried with tho&s;e &s;ouls in hell, out of your &s;ight, and therefore now it doth not much trouble you; but alas! they feel it, though you feel it not. <HI>Jeremiah</HI> cried out, <HI>My bowels, my bow|els, I cannot hold my peace,</HI> becau&s;e of a temporal de|&s;truction
<PB N="225" REF="022331_0224_0FB7F0304BF29FD0">of his people: and do not our bowels yearn? And can we hold our peace at men's eternal de&s;truc|tion?</P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider, What a rate <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did value &s;ouls at, and what he hath done towards the &s;aving of them: he thought them worth his blood, and &s;hall not we think them worth the breath of our mouths? Will you not do a little, where he hath done &s;o much?</P>
<P N="3">3. Con&s;ider, What a deal of guilt this neglect doth lay upon thy &s;oul. Fir&s;t, thou art guilty of the murder and damnation of all tho&s;e &s;ouls whom thou do&s;t neglect. He that &s;tandeth by, and &s;eeth a man in a pit, and will not pull him out if he can, doth drown him. And he that &s;tandeth by while thieves rob him, or murderers kill him, and will not help him if he can, is acce&s;&s;ary to the fact. And &s;o he that will &s;ilently &s;uffer men to damn their &s;ouls, or will let Satan and the world deceive them, and not offer to help them, will certainly be judged guilty of damn|ing them. And is not this a mo&s;t dreadful con&s;idera|tion? O &s;irs, how many &s;ouls then have every one of us been guilty of damning! What a number of our neighbours and acquaintance are dead, in whom we di&s;cerned no &s;igns of &s;anctification, and we never once plainly told them of it, or how to be recovered! If you had been the cau&s;e but of burning a man's hou&s;e through your negligence, or of undoing him, or de|&s;troying his body, how would it trouble you as long as you lived? If you had but killed a man unadvi&s;ed|ly, it would much di&s;quiet you. We have known tho&s;e that have been guilty of murder, that could ne|ver &s;leep quietly after, nor have one comfortable day, their own con&s;ciences did &s;o vex and torment them. O what a heart mu&s;t thou have, that ha&s;t been guilty of murdering &s;uch a multitude of precious &s;ouls! Re|member this, when thou looke&s;t thy friend or carnal
<PB N="226" REF="022331_0225_0FB7F0318B8C5450">neighbour in the face; and think with thy&s;elf, can I find in my heart, through my &s;ilence and negligence, to be guilty of his everla&s;ting burning in hell? Me|thinks &s;uch a thought &s;hould even untie the tongue of the dumb.</P>
<P N="2">2. And as you are guilty of their peri&s;hing, &s;o are you of every &s;in which in the mean-time they com|mit. If they were converted, they would break off their cour&s;e of &s;inning: and if you did your duty, you know not but they might be converted. As he that is guilty of a man's drunkenne&s;s, is guilty of all the &s;ins which that drunkenne&s;s doth cau&s;e him to commit: &s;o he that is guilty of a man's continuing unregenerate, is al&s;o guilty of the &s;ins of his unrege|neracy. How many cur&s;es and oaths, and other &s;ins of a mo&s;t heinous nature are many of you guilty of, that little think of it? You that take much pains for your own &s;ouls, and &s;eem fearful of &s;inning, would take it ill of one that &s;hould tell you, that you are guilty of weekly, or daily whoredoms, and drunken|ne&s;s, and &s;wearing, and lying. And yet it is too true, even beyond all denial, by your neglect of helping tho&s;e who do commit them.</P>
<P N="3">3. You are guilty al&s;o of all tho&s;e judgments, which tho&s;e men's &s;ins bring upon the town or country where they live. I know, you are not &s;uch athei&s;ts, but you believe it is GOD that &s;endeth &s;ickne&s;s, and fa|mine, and war; and al&s;o that it is only &s;in that mov|eth him to this indignation. What doubt then is there, but you are the cau&s;e of judgments, who do not &s;trive again&s;t tho&s;e &s;ins which cau&s;e them? GOD hath &s;taid long in patience, to &s;ee if any would deal plainly with the &s;inners of the times, and &s;o free their own &s;ouls from the guilt: but when he &s;eeth that there is none, but all become guilty; no wonder then if he lay the judgment upon all. We have all &s;een
<PB N="227" REF="022331_0226_0FB7F033CD2478B0">the drunkards, and heard the &s;wearers, in our &s;treets, and we would not &s;peak to them: we have all lived in the mid&s;t of an ignorant, worldly, unholy people; and we have not &s;poke to them with earne&s;tne&s;s, plain|ne&s;s, and love; no wonder then if GOD &s;peak in his wrath both to them and us. <HI>Eli</HI> did not commit the &s;in him&s;elf, and yet he &s;peaketh &s;o coldly again&s;t it, that he mu&s;t bear the puni&s;hment. GOD locketh up the clouds, becau&s;e we have &s;hut up our mouths. The earth is grown as hard as iron to us, becau&s;e we have hardened our hearts again&s;t our mi&s;erable neighbours. The cries of the poor for bread are loud, becau&s;e our cries again&s;t &s;in have been &s;o low. Sickne&s;&s;es run a pace from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, and &s;weep away the poor unprepared inhabitants, becau&s;e we &s;wept not out the &s;in that breedeth them. As <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;aid in another ca&s;e, <HI>Luke</HI> xix. 40. <HI>If the&s;e &s;hould hold their peace, the &s;tones would &s;peak:</HI> &s;o, becau&s;e we held our peace at the ignorance, ungodline&s;s, and wickedne&s;s of our places, therefore do the&s;e plagues and judgments &s;peak.</P>
<P N="4">4. Con&s;ider, What a thing it will be, to look up|on your poor friends in tho&s;e flames, and to think that your neglect was a great cau&s;e of it! And that there was a time when you might have done much to prevent it. If you &s;hould there peri&s;h with them, it would be no &s;mall aggravation of your torment; if you be in heaven, it would &s;ure be a &s;ad thought, were it po&s;&s;ible that any &s;orrow could dwell there, to hear a multitude of poor &s;ouls there to cry out for|ever. O if you would but have told me plainly of my &s;in and danger, and dealt roundly with me. I might have e&s;caped all this torment, and been now in re&s;t! O what a &s;ad voice will this be!</P>
<P N="5">5. Con&s;ider, How diligent are the enemies of the&s;e poor &s;ouls to draw them to hell. And if no body be diligent in helping them to heaven, what is like to
<PB N="228" REF="022331_0227_0FB7F0354E9C6310">become of them? The devil is tempting them day and night: their inward lu&s;ts are &s;till working and withdrawing them: the fle&s;h is &s;till pleading for its delights and profits: their old companions are ready to entice them to &s;in, and to di&s;grace GOD'S ways and people to them, and to contradict the doctrine of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> that &s;hould &s;ave them, and to increa&s;e their di&s;|like of holine&s;s. Seducing teachers are exceeding diligent in &s;owing tares, and in drawing off the un|&s;table from the way to life: and &s;hall a &s;educer be &s;o unwearied in pro&s;elyting poor ungrounded &s;ouls to his fancies? And &s;hall not a &s;ound chri&s;tian be much more unwearied in labouring to win men to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and life?</P>
<P N="6">6. Con&s;ider, The neglect of this doth very deeply wound when con&s;cience is awakened. When a man comes to die, con&s;cience will a&s;k him, What good ha&s;t thou done in thy life-time? The &s;aving of &s;ouls is the greate&s;t good; What ha&s;t thou done towards this? How many ha&s;t thou dealt faithfully with? I have oft ob&s;erved, that the con&s;ciences of dying men, very much wound them for this omi&s;&s;ion. For my own part (to tell you my experience) when ever I have been near death, my con&s;cience hath accu&s;ed me more for this than for any &s;in: it would bring every ignorant, profane neighbour to my remembrance, to whom I never made known their danger: it would tell me, thou &s;hould&s;t have gone to them in private, and told them plainly of their de&s;perate danger, with|out ba&s;hfulne&s;s or daubing, though it had been when thou &s;hould&s;t have eaten or &s;lept, if thou had&s;t no other time: con&s;cience would remember me, how at &s;uch a time, or &s;uch a time. I was in company with the ig|norant, or was riding by the way with a wilful &s;inner, and had a fit opportunity to have dealt with him, but did not: or at lea&s;t did it by halves, and to little pur|po&s;e. The LORD grant I may better obey con&s;cience
<PB N="229" REF="022331_0228_0FB7F03793FA8080">hereafter while I live and have time, that it may have le&s;s to accu&s;e me of at death!</P>
<P N="7">7. Con&s;ider, la&s;tly, the happy con&s;equences of this work, where it is faithfully done: to name &s;ome:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. You may be in&s;trumental in that ble&s;&s;ed work of &s;aving &s;ouls, a work that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> came down and died for, a work that the angels of GOD rejoice in; for, &s;aith the Holy Gho&s;t, <HI>If any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him, let him know, that he which converteth the &s;inner from the error of his way, &s;hall &s;ave a &s;oul from death, and &s;hall hide a multitude of &s;ins.</HI> James v. 19, 20. And how can GOD more highly honour you, than to make you in&s;truments in &s;o great a work?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Such &s;ouls will ble&s;s you here and hereafter. They may be angry with you at fir&s;t; but if your words &s;ucceed, they will ble&s;s the day that ever they knew you, and ble&s;s GOD that &s;ent you to &s;peak to them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. It bringeth much advantage to your&s;elves: fir&s;t, it will increa&s;e your graces, both as it is a cour&s;e that GOD will ble&s;s, and as it is an acting of them in this per&s;uading of others: he that will not let you lo&s;e a cup of water which is given for him, will not let you lo&s;e the&s;e greater works of charity; be&s;ides, tho&s;e that have practi&s;ed this duty, mu&s;t find by experience, that they never go on more pro&s;perou&s;ly towards heaven, than when they do mo&s;t to help others thither with them: it is not here as with worldly trea&s;ure, the more you give away, the le&s;s you have: but the more you give, the more you have: the &s;etting forth <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in his fulne&s;s to others, will warm your own hearts; the opening the evil and danger of &s;in to others, will increa&s;e your hatred of it. Secondly, it will in|crea&s;e
<PB N="230" REF="022331_0229_0FB7F0390B718120">your glory as well as your grace, both as a du|ty which GOD will reward, (<HI>For they that convert ma|ny to righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall &s;hine as the &s;tars for-ever and ever.</HI> Dan. xii. 3.) and al&s;o as we &s;hall there behold them in heaven, and be their a&s;&s;ociates in ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, whom GOD made us here the in&s;truments to convert. Third|ly, however, it will give us much peace of con&s;ci|ence, whether we &s;ucceed or not, to think that we were faithful, and did our be&s;t to &s;ave them, and that we are clear from the blood of all men. Fourthly, be|&s;ides, that is a work, that if it &s;ucceed doth exceed|ingly rejoice an hone&s;t heart: he that hath any &s;en&s;e of GOD's honour, or the lea&s;t affection to the &s;oul of his brother, mu&s;t needs rejoice much at his conver&s;ion, who&s;oever be the in&s;trument, but e&s;pecially when GOD maketh our&s;elves the means of &s;o ble&s;&s;ed a work.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>For my own part, it is an un&s;peakable comfort to me, that GOD hath made me an in&s;trument for the recovering of &s;o many from bodily di&s;ea&s;es, and &s;aving their natural lives; but all this is nothing to the comfort I have in the &s;ucce&s;s of my labours, in the conver&s;ion and comfirmation of &s;ouls; it is &s;o great a joy to me, that it drowneth the painfulne&s;s of my daily duties, and the trouble of my daily langui&s;hing and bodily griefs. And maketh all the&s;e, with all op|po&s;itions and difficulties in my work, to be ea&s;y: and of all the per&s;onal mercies that ever I received, next to his love in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to my &s;oul, I mo&s;t joyfully ble&s;s him for the plenteous &s;ucce&s;s of my endeavours upon others: O what fruits then might I have &s;een, if I had been more faithful, and plied the work in pri|vate and public as I ought! I know we have need to be very jealous of our deceitful hearts in this point, le&s;t our rejoicing &s;hould come from our pride. Na|turally we would every man, be in the place of GOD, and have the prai&s;e of every good work a&s;cribed to our&s;elves: but yet to imitate our Father in goodne&s;s,
<PB N="231" REF="022331_0230_0FB7F03B8B361630">and to rejoice in that degree we attain to, is the part of every child of GOD. I tell you therefore, to per|&s;uade you from my own experience, that if you did but know what a joyful thing it is to be an in&s;tru|ment for the &s;aving of &s;ouls, you would &s;et upon it pre&s;ently, and follow it night and day through the greate&s;t di&s;couragements and re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>And thus I have &s;hewed you what &s;hould per&s;uade you to this duty. Let me now conclude with a word of entreaty: fir&s;t, to all the godly in general. Second|ly, to &s;ome above others in particular.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> An Advice to &s;ome more particularly to help others to this Re&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>UP then every man that hath a tongue, and is a &s;ervant of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and do &s;omething of this your Ma&s;ter's work: Why hath he given you a tongue but to &s;peak in his &s;ervice? And how can you &s;erve him more eminently, than in the &s;aving of &s;ouls? He that will pronounce you ble&s;&s;ed at the la&s;t day, and &s;entence you to the kingdom prepared for you, becau&s;e you fed him, and clothed him, and vi&s;ited him, in his mem|bers, will &s;urely pronounce you ble&s;&s;ed for &s;o great a work as the bringing over of &s;ouls to his kingdom. He that &s;aith, <HI>The poor you have always with you,</HI> hath left the ungodly always with you, that you might &s;till have matter to exerci&s;e you charity upon. O if you have the hearts of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> or of men in you, let them yearn towards your poor, ignorant, ungodly and neighbours! Alas, there is but a &s;tep betwixt them, and death, and hell; many hundred di&s;ea&s;es are wait|ing
<PB N="232" REF="022331_0231_0FB7F03DA8EDEBA8">ready to &s;eize them, and if they die unregenerate, they are lo&s;t for-ever. Have you hearts of rock, that cannot pity men in &s;uch a ca&s;e? If you believe not the word of GOD, how are you chri&s;tians your&s;elves? If you do but believe it, why do you not be&s;tir you to help others? Do you not care who is damned, &s;o you be &s;aved? If &s;o, you have as much cau&s;e to pity your own&s;elves; for it is a frame of &s;pirit incon&s;i&s;tent with grace: &s;hould you not rather &s;ay, as the lepers of <HI>Samaria,</HI> is it not a day of glad tidings, and we &s;it &s;till, and hold our peace? Hath GOD had &s;o much mer|cy on you, and will you have no mercy on your poor neighbours? You need not go far to find objects for your pity: look but into the &s;treets, or into the next hou&s;e to you, and you will probably find &s;ome. Have you not a neighbour that &s;ets his heart below, and neglecteth eternity? What ble&s;&s;ed place do you live in, where there is none &s;uch? If there be not &s;ome of them in thine own family, it is well; and yet art thou &s;ilent? Do&s;t thou live clo&s;e by them, or meet them in the &s;treets, or labour with them, or travel with them, or &s;it &s;till and talk with them, and &s;ay nothing to them of their &s;ouls, or the life to come? If their hou&s;es were on fire, thou would&s;t run and help them; and wilt thou not help them when their &s;ouls are al|mo&s;t at the fire of hell? If thou knowe&s;t but a remedy for their di&s;ea&s;es thou would&s;t tell it them, or el&s;e thou would&s;t judge thy&s;elf guilty of their death. <HI>Cardan</HI> &s;peaks of one that had a receipt that would di&s;&s;olve the &s;tone in the bladder, and he makes no doubt but that man is in hell, becau&s;e he never revealed it to any be|fore he died: what &s;hall we &s;ay then of them that know the remedy for curing &s;ouls, and do not reveal it; nor per&s;uade men to make u&s;e of it? Is it not hy|pocrify to pray <HI>that God</HI>'s <HI>name may be hallowed,</HI> and never endeavour to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring men to <HI>hallow</HI> it? And can you pray, <HI>Let thy kingdom come;</HI> and yet never labour for the coming or increa&s;e of that kingdom? Is it not
<PB N="233" REF="022331_0232_0FB7F03FC8B92B68">grief to your hearts to &s;ee the kingdom of Satan flou|ri&s;h, and to &s;ee him lead captive &s;uch a multitude of &s;ouls? you &s;ay you are &s;oldiers of <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> and will you do nothing again&s;t his prevailing enemies? You pray al&s;o daily, <HI>That his will may be done;</HI> and &s;hould you not daily then per&s;uade men to do it? You pray, <HI>That God would forgive them th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir &s;ins, and that he would not lead them into temptation, but deliver them from evil.</HI> And yet will you not help them again&s;t temptations, nor help to deliver them from the great|e&s;t evil? Nor help them to repent and believe, that they may be forgiven? Alas, that your prayers and your practice &s;hould &s;o much di&s;agree! Look about you therefore, chri&s;tians, with an eye of compa&s;&s;ion on the &s;inners about you; be not like the Prie&s;t or Levite that &s;aw the man wounded, and pa&s;&s;ed by: GOD did not &s;o pa&s;s by you, when it was your own ca&s;e. Are not the &s;ouls of your neighbours fallen into the hands of Satan? Doth not their mi&s;ery cry out to you, help, help! As you have any compa&s;&s;ion towards men in the greate&s;t mi&s;ery, help! As you have the hearts of men, and not of tygers in you, help!</P>
<P>But as this duty lieth upon all in general, &s;o upon &s;ome more e&s;pecially, according as GOD hath called or qualified them thereto. To them therefore more particularly I will addre&s;s my exhortation: whether they be &s;uch as have more opportunity and advanta|ges for this work, or &s;uch as have better abilities to perform it.</P>
<P N="1">1. All you that GOD hath given more learning and knowledge to, or endued with better utterance than your neigbours; GOD expecteth this duty e&s;pecially at your hand. The &s;trong are made to help the weak, and tho&s;e that &s;ee mu&s;t direct the blind. GOD look|eth for this faithful improvement of your parts and gifts, which if you neglect, it were better for you that
<PB N="234" REF="022331_0233_0FB7F043439F5670">you never had received them: for they will but fur|ther your condemnation, and be as u&s;ele&s;s to your own &s;alvation as they were to others.</P>
<P N="2">2. All tho&s;e that have e&s;pecially familiarity with &s;ome ungodly men, and that have intere&s;t in them, GOD looks for this duty at their hands. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him|&s;elf did eat and drink with the publicans and &s;inners, but it was only to be their phy&s;ician, and not their companion. GOD might give you intere&s;t in them to this end, that you might be a means of their re|covery. They that will not regard the words of ano|ther, will regard a brother, or &s;i&s;ter, or hu&s;band, or wife, or near friend: be&s;ides that the bond of friend|&s;hip doth engage you to more kindne&s;s and compa&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P N="3">3. Phy&s;icians that are much about dying men, &s;hould in a &s;pecial manner make a con&s;cience of this duty: they have a treble advantage. Fir&s;t, they are at hand. Secondly, they are with men in &s;ickne&s;s and dangers, when the ear is more open, and the heart le&s;s &s;tubborn than in time of health. He that made a &s;corn of godline&s;s before, will hear coun&s;el then, if ever he will hear it. Thirdly, be&s;ides, they look upon their phy&s;ician as a man in who&s;e hand is their life: or who at lea&s;t may do much to &s;ave them, and therefore they will the more regard his advice. Therefore you that are of this honourable profe&s;&s;ion, do not think this a work be&s;ides your calling, as if it belonged to none but mini&s;ters; except you think it be&s;ides your cal|ling to be compa&s;&s;ionate, or to be chri&s;tians. Help to fit your patients for heaven, and whether you &s;ee they are for life or death, teach them both how to live and how to die, and give them &s;ome phy&s;ic for their &s;ouls, as you do for their bodies. Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD that very many of the chief phy&s;icians of this age have, by
<PB N="235" REF="022331_0234_0FB7F045CEA3F0A8">their eminent piety, vindicated their profe&s;&s;ion from the common imputation of athei&s;m and profanene&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another &s;ort that have excellent advantage for this duty, are men that have wealth and authority, and are of great place or command in the world, e&s;pecially that have many who live in dependance on them. O what a world of good might gentlemen and lords do, that have a great many tenants, and that are the leaders of the country, if they had but hearts to improve their intere&s;t and advantage! Little do you that are &s;uch, think of the duty that lies up|on you in this. Have you not all honour and riches from GOD? Is it not evident then, that you mu&s;t employ them for the advantage of his &s;ervice? Do you not know who hath &s;aid, <HI>That to whom men com|mit much, from them they will expect the more?</HI></P>
<P>You have the greate&s;t opportunities to do good, of mo&s;t men in the world. Your tenants dare not con|tradict you, le&s;t you di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them or their children of their habitations: they fear you more, than the threatenings of the &s;criptures; they will &s;ooner obey you than GOD. If you &s;peak to them of GOD. and their &s;ouls, you may be regarded, when even a mi|ni&s;ter &s;hall be de&s;pi&s;ed. O therefore as you value the honour of GOD, your own comfort, and the &s;alvati|on of &s;ouls, improve your intere&s;t to the utmo&s;t for GOD. Go vi&s;it your tenants' and neighbours' hou&s;es, and &s;ee whether they wor&s;hip GOD in their families, and take all opportunities to pre&s;s them to their du|ties. Do not de&s;pi&s;e them, becau&s;e they are poor or &s;imple. Remember, GOD is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons; your fle&s;h is of no better metal than theirs; nor will the worms &s;pare your faces or hearts any more than theirs; nor will your bones or du&s;t bear the badge of your gentility; you mu&s;t be all equals when you &s;tand in judgment; and therefore help the &s;oul of a
<PB N="236" REF="022331_0235_0FB7F04851003FC8">poor man, as well as if he were a gentleman: and let men &s;ee that you excell others as much in piety, hea|venline&s;s, compa&s;&s;ion and diligence in GOD'S work, as you do in riches and honour.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s you are like to be &s;ingular if you take this cour&s;e; but then remember, you &s;hall be &s;ingular in glory, for <HI>few great, and mighty, and noble are called.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Another &s;ort that have &s;pecial opportunity to help others to heaven, are the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel: as they have, or &s;hould have more ability than others, &s;o it is the very work of their calling; and every one expecteth it at their hands, and will better &s;ub|mit to their teachers, than to others. I intend not the&s;e in&s;tructions &s;o much to teachers, as to others, and therefore I &s;hall &s;ay but little to them; and if all, or mo&s;t mini&s;ters among us were as faithful and dili|gent as &s;ome, I would &s;ay nothing. But becau&s;e it is otherwi&s;e, let me give the&s;e two or three words of advice to my brethren in this office.</P>
<P N="1">1. Be &s;ure that the recovering and &s;aving &s;ouls, be the main end of your &s;tudies and preaching. O do not propound any low and ba&s;e ends to your&s;elves. This is the end of your calling, let it be al&s;o the end of your endeavours. GOD forbid that you &s;hould &s;pend a week's &s;tudy to plea&s;e the people, or to &s;eek the advancing your own reputations. Dare you appear in the pulpit on &s;uch a bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;peak for your&s;elves, when you are &s;ent and pretend to &s;peak for <HI>Chri&s;t?</HI> Set out the work of GOD as &s;kilfully as you can; but &s;till let the winning of &s;ouls be your end, and al|ways judge that the be&s;t means, that mo&s;t conduceth to the end. Do not think that GOD is be&s;t &s;erved by a neat, &s;tarched oration: but that he is the able, &s;kil|ful mini&s;ter, that is be&s;t &s;killed in the art of in&s;truct|ing,
<PB N="237" REF="022331_0236_0FB7F0499373F718">convincing, per&s;uading, and that is the be&s;t &s;er|mon that is be&s;t in the&s;e. Let the vigor al&s;o of your per&s;ua&s;ions &s;hew, that you are &s;en&s;ible on how weigh|ty a bu&s;ine&s;s you are &s;ent. Preach with that &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s and fervour as men that believe their own doc|trine, and know their hearers mu&s;t either be prevail|ed with, or be damned. What you would do to &s;ave them from everla&s;ting burning, that do while you have the opportunity and price in your hand, that people may di&s;cern you mean as you &s;peak; and that you are not &s;tage-players, but preachers of the doc|trine of &s;alvation. Remember what <HI>Cicero</HI> faith, <Q>That if the matter be never &s;o combu&s;tible, yet if you put not fire to it, it will not burn.</Q> And what <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> &s;aith. <Q>That an hot iron will pierce, when a cold one will not.</Q> And if the wi&s;e men of the world account you mad, &s;ay as <HI>Paul, If we are be&s;ide our&s;elves, it is to God:</HI> and remember that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was &s;o bu&s;y in doing of good, that his friends them&s;elves begun to lay hands on him, thinking he had been be&s;ide him&s;elf, <HI>Mark</HI> iii.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;econd and chief word of advice that I would give you, is this: do not think that all your work is in &s;tudies, and in the pulpit. I confe&s;s that is great; but, alas! it is but a &s;mall part of your ta&s;k. You are &s;hepherds and mu&s;t know every &s;heep, and what is their di&s;ea&s;e, and mark their &s;trayings, and help to cure them, and fetch them home.</P>
<P>O learn of <HI>Paul, Acts</HI> xx. 19, 20.31. to preach publicly, and from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, night and day with tears. Let there not be a &s;oul in your charge that &s;hall not be particularly in&s;tructed and watched over. Go from hou&s;e to hou&s;e daily, and enquire how they grow in knowledge and holine&s;s, and on what grounds they build their hopes of &s;alvation; and whether they talk uprightly and perform the du|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es
<PB N="238" REF="022331_0237_0FB7F04B0A84EEA0">of their &s;everal relations, and u&s;e the means to increa&s;e their abilities. See whether they daily wor|&s;hip GOD in their families, and &s;et them in a way, and teach them how to do it: confer with them about the doctrines and practice of religion, and how they receive and profit by public teaching, and an&s;wer all their carnal objections; keep in familiarity with them that you may maintain your intere&s;t in them, and improve all your intere&s;t for GOD. See that no &s;e|ducers creep in among&s;t them, or if they do, be dili|gent to countermine them, and pre&s;erve your people from the infection of here&s;ies and &s;chi&s;ms; or if they be infected, be diligent to procure their recovery; not with pa&s;&s;ion and lordline&s;s, but with patience and conde&s;cen&s;ion: as <HI>Ma&s;culus</HI> did by the <HI>Anabapti&s;ts,</HI> vi&s;iting them in pri&s;on, where the magi&s;trate had ca&s;t them, and there in&s;tructing and relieving them; and though they reviled him when he came, and called him a fal&s;e prophet and antichri&s;tian &s;educer that thir&s;ted for their blood, yet he would not &s;o leave them, till at la&s;t by his meekne&s;s and love he had overcome them, and recovered many to the truth, and to unity with the church.</P>
<P>If any be <HI>weak in the faith, receive him, but not to doubtful di&s;putations.</HI> If any be too carele&s;s of their duties, and too little &s;avour the things of the Spirit, let them be pitied, and not neglected: if any walk &s;candalou&s;ly and di&s;orderly, deal with them for their recovery, with all diligence and patience, and &s;et be|fore them the heinou&s;ne&s;s and danger of their &s;in: if they prove ob&s;tinate, after all, then avoid them, and ca&s;t them off: if they be ignorant, it may be your fault as well as theirs; but however, they are fitter to be in&s;tructed than rejected, except they ab&s;olutely re&s;u&s;e to be taught. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> will give you no thanks for keeping, or putting out &s;uch from his &s;chool that are unlearned, when their de&s;ire or will is to be
<PB N="239" REF="022331_0238_0FB7F04C8C9442B8">taught. I confe&s;s it is ea&s;ier to &s;hut out the igno|rant, than to be&s;tow our pains night and day in teach|ing them; but wo to &s;uch &s;lothful, unfaithful &s;er|vants. Who then is a faithful and a wi&s;e &s;ervant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his hou&s;ehold, to give them their meat in due &s;ea&s;on, according to every one's age and capacity? <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is that &s;ervant whom his Lord, when he cometh, &s;hall find &s;o doing.</HI> O be not a&s;leep while the wolf is waking! Let your eye be quick in ob&s;erving the dangers and &s;trayings of your people. If jealou&s;ies, heart-burnings, or con|tentions ari&s;e among them, quench them before they break out into raging, irre&s;i&s;tible flames. As &s;oon as you di&s;cern any to turn worldly, or proud, or fac|tious, or &s;elf-conceited, or di&s;obedient, or cold, and &s;lothful in his duty; delay not, but pre&s;ently make out for his recovery: remember how many are lo&s;ers in the lo&s;s of a &s;oul.</P>
<P N="3">3. Do not daub, or deal &s;lightly with any; &s;ome will not tell their people plainly of their &s;ins, becau&s;e they are great men; as if none but the poor &s;hould plainly be dealt with: do not you &s;o, but reprove them &s;harply, (though differently and with wi&s;dom) that they may be &s;ound in faith. GOD doth &s;uffici|ently engage us to deal plainly; he hath bid us &s;peak and fear not: he hath promi&s;ed to &s;tand by us; and he will be our &s;ecurity. I had rather hear from the mouth of <HI>Balak,</HI> GOD <HI>hath kept thee from honour;</HI> or from <HI>Ahab, feed him with the bread and water of af|fliction;</HI> than to hear con&s;cience &s;ay, <HI>Thou ha&s;t be|trayed &s;ouls to damnation by thy cowardice and &s;ilence;</HI> or to hear GOD &s;ay, <HI>Their blood will I require at thy hands;</HI> or to hear from <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the judge, <HI>Ca&s;t the un|profitable &s;ervant into outer darkne&s;s, where &s;hall be weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth;</HI> yea, or to hear the&s;e &s;inners cry out again&s;t me in eternal fire, and with implacable rage to charge me with their undoing.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="022331_0239_0FB7F04F011DCC10">
And as you mu&s;t be plain and &s;erious, &s;o labour to be &s;kilful and di&s;creet, that the manner may &s;ome|what an&s;wer the excellency of the matter. How oft have I heard a &s;tammering tongue, with ridiculous expre&s;&s;ions, vain repetitions, tedious circumlocutions, and un&s;eemly pronunciation, &s;poil mo&s;t precious doc|trine, and make the hearers either loath it, or laugh at it! How common are the&s;e extremes, while one &s;poils the food of life by affectation, and new-fa&s;hion|ed mincing, and pedantic toys, either &s;etting forth a little and mean matter with a great deal of froth, and gaudy dre&s;&s;ing; or hiding excellent truths in a heap of vain rhetoric on the other &s;ide! How many by their &s;lovenly dre&s;&s;ing, make men loath the food of life, and ca&s;t up that which &s;houl nouri&s;h them! Such novices are admitted into the &s;acred function, to the hardening of the wicked, and the di&s;grace of the work of the LORD; and tho&s;e that are not able to &s;peak &s;en&s;e or rea&s;on, are made the amba&s;&s;adors of the mo&s;t high GOD.</P>
<P>O therefore let me be&s;peak you my brethren, in the name of the LORD, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are more young and weak, that you tremble at the greatne&s;s of this holy employment, and run not up into a pul|pit as boldly as into the market-place: &s;tudy and pray, pray and &s;tudy, till you are become workmen that need not be a&s;hamed, rightly dividing the word of truth, that your people may not be a&s;hamed, or weary to hear you: but that be&s;ides your clear unfolding the doctrine of the go&s;pel, you may al&s;o be ma&s;ters of your people's affections. It is a work that requir|eth your mo&s;t &s;erious &s;earching thoughts: running, ha&s;ty, ea&s;y &s;tudies, bring forth blind births. When you are the mo&s;t renowned doctors in the church of GOD, alas, how little is it that you know, in com|pari&s;on of all that which you are ignorant of!</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="241" REF="022331_0240_0FB7F050582964F0">
4. Be &s;ure that your conver&s;ation be teaching as well as your doctrine. Do not confute your doctrine by your practice. Be as forward in an holy and hea|venly life, as you are in pre&s;&s;ing it on others. Let your di&s;cour&s;e be as edifying and &s;piritual, as you teach them theirs mu&s;t be: for evil language give them good; and ble&s;&s;ing for their cur&s;ing. Suffer any thing, rather than the go&s;pel and men's &s;ouls &s;hould &s;uffer: <HI>Become all things</HI> (lawful) <HI>to all men, if by any means you may win &s;ome.</HI> Let men &s;ee that you u&s;e not the mini&s;try only for a trade to live by; but that your hearts are &s;et upon the welfare of their &s;ouls. What&s;oever meekne&s;s, humility, conde&s;cen&s;ion, or &s;elf-denial you teach them from the go&s;pel, O teach it them al&s;o by your undi&s;&s;embled example. This is to be guides, and pilots, and governors of the church indeed.</P>
<P>What an odious &s;ight is it, to &s;ee pride and ambi|tion preach humility! and an earthly-minded man preach for an heavenly conver&s;ation!</P>
<P>Do I need to tell you that are teachers of others, that we have but a little while longer to preach? And but a few more breaths to breathe? And then we mu&s;t come down, and be accountable for our work? Do I need to tell you, that we mu&s;t die, and be judged as well as our people? Or that ju&s;tice is mo&s;t &s;evere about the &s;anctuary? And <HI>judgment beginneth at the hou&s;e of</HI> GOD?</P>
<P N="5">5. The la&s;t whom I would per&s;uade to this great work of helping others to the heavenly re&s;t, is pa|rents, and ma&s;ters of families. All you that GOD hath intru&s;ted with children or &s;ervants, con&s;ider what duty lieth on you for furthering their &s;alvation. That this exhortation may be the more effectual with
<PB N="242" REF="022331_0241_0FB7F051CC2D3000">you, I will lay down &s;everal con&s;iderations for you &s;eriou&s;ly to think on.</P>
<P N="1">1. What plain and pre&s;&s;ing commands of GOD are there, that require this great duty at your hand! <HI>Deut.</HI> vi. 6, 7, 8. <HI>And the&s;e words which I command thee this day &s;hall be in thy heart, and thou &s;halt teach them diligently to thy children, &s;peaking of them when thou &s;itte&s;t in thy hou&s;e, and when thou walke&s;t by the way, and when thou li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t down, and when thou ri&s;e&s;t up.</HI> And how well is GOD plea&s;ed with this in <HI>Abra|ham, Gen.</HI> xviii. 17.19. <HI>Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do? For I know him, that he will command his children, and his hou&s;ehold after him, that they &s;hall keep the way of the</HI> LORD. <HI>Prov.</HI> xxii. 6. <HI>Train up a child in the way he &s;hould go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</HI> So that you &s;ee it is a work that the LORD of heaven and earth hath laid upon you; and how then dare you neglect it?</P>
<P N="2">2. You will el&s;e be witne&s;&s;es again&s;t your own &s;ouls: your great care and pains, and co&s;t for their bodies, will condemn you for your neglect of their precious &s;ouls: you can &s;pend your&s;elves in toiling and caring for their bodies, and even neglect your own &s;ouls, and venture them &s;ometimes upon un|warrantable cour&s;es, and all to provide for your po|&s;terity: and have you not as much rea&s;on to provide for their &s;ouls? Do you not believe that your chil|dren mu&s;t be everla&s;tingly happy or mi&s;erable? And &s;hould not that be fore-thought in the fir&s;t place?</P>
<P N="3">3. Con&s;ider, GOD hath made your children to be your charge; yea, and your &s;ervants too: every one will con&s;e&s;s they are the mini&s;ter's charge, and what a dreadful thing is it for them to neglect them, when GOD hath told them, That if they tell not the wick|ed
<PB N="243" REF="022331_0242_0FB7F055CF710890">of their &s;in and danger, their blood &s;hall be re|quired at that mini&s;ter's hands! and is not your charge as great and as dreadful as theirs? Have not you a greater charge of your own families than any mini|&s;ter hath? Yea, doubtle&s;s, and your duty it is to teach, and admoni&s;h, and reprove them, and watch over them, at your hands el&s;e will GOD require the blood of their &s;ouls. The greate&s;t charge it is, that ever you were intru&s;ted with, and wo to you if you prove unfaithful, and betray your tru&s;t, and &s;uffer them to be ignorant for want of your teaching, or wicked for want of your admonition or correction.</P>
<P N="4">4. Look into the di&s;po&s;itions and lives of your children, and &s;ee what a work there is for you to do. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is not one &s;in that you mu&s;t help them again&s;t, but thou&s;ands; their name is legion, for they are many: it is not one weed that mu&s;t be pulled up, but the field is over&s;pread with them. <HI>Secondly,</HI> and how hard is it to prevail again&s;t any one of them! They are hereditary di&s;ea&s;es, bred in their natures: they are as near them as the very heart; and how tenacious are all things of that which is natural! How hard to teach a hare not to be afraid, or a lion or tyger not to be fierce! Be&s;ides, the things you mu&s;t teach them, are quite above them; yea, and clean contrary to the intere&s;t and de&s;ires of their fle&s;h: how hard is it to teach a man to be willing to be poor and de&s;pi&s;ed for <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> to deny them&s;elves, and di&s;plea&s;e the fle&s;h; to forgive an enemy; to love tho&s;e that hate us; to watch again&s;t temptations; to avoid occa&s;ions and appearances of evil; to believe in a crucified Sa|viour; to rejoice in tribulation; to make GOD their delight and love; and to have their hearts in heaven, while they live on earth! I think none of this is ea&s;y, they that think otherwi&s;e, let them try and judge; yet all this mu&s;t be learned, or they are undone for|ever. If you help them not to &s;ome trade, they can|not
<PB N="244" REF="022331_0243_0FB7F0570BFC67B8">live in the world; but if they be de&s;titute of the&s;e things they &s;hall not live in heaven. If the mariner be not &s;kilful, he may be drowned; and if the &s;oldier be not &s;kilful, he may be &s;lain: but they that cannot do the things above-mentioned, will pe|ri&s;h for-ever; <HI>For without holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee God.</HI> O that the LORD would make all you that are parents &s;en&s;ible what a work and charge doth lie upon you! You that neglect this important work, and talk to your families of nothing but the world, I tell you the blood of &s;ouls lies on you: make as light of it as you will, if you repent not and amend, the LORD will &s;hortly call you to an account for the guilt of your children's everla&s;ting undoing.</P>
<P N="5">5. Think with your&s;elves, what a world of com|fort you may have if you be faithful in this duty: if you &s;hould not &s;ucceed, yet you have freed your own &s;ouls; and though it be &s;ad, yet you may have peace in your own con&s;ciences: but if you do &s;ucceed, the comfort is inexpre&s;&s;ible. For,

<ITEM>1. Good children will be truly loving to their parents; when a little matter will make ungodly children ca&s;t off their very natural affection.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Good children will be mo&s;t obedient to you; they dare not di&s;obey you, becau&s;e of the command of GOD, except you &s;hould command them that which is unlawful, and then they mu&s;t obey GOD rather than men.</ITEM>

6. Con&s;ider further, that the very welfare of church and &s;tate lieth mainly on this duty of well-educating children; and without this, all other means are like to be far le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful. I &s;eriou&s;ly profe&s;s to you, that I verily think all the &s;ins and mi&s;eries of the land may acknowledge this &s;in for their nur&s;e. It is not good laws and orders that will reform us, if the men be not good, and reformation begin not at home; when children go wicked from the hands of their pa|rents, in every profe&s;&s;ion they bring this fruit of their education with them. I tell you &s;eriou&s;ly, this is the cau&s;e of all our mi&s;eries in church and &s;tate, even the want of a holy education of children. Many lay the blame on this neglect, and that; but there is none hath &s;o great a hand in it as this.</P>
<P N="7">7. I entreat you that are parents, to con&s;ider what excellent advantages you have above all others for the &s;aving of your children.</P>
<P N="1">1. They are under your hands while they are young, and tender, and flexible; but they come to mini&s;ters when they are grown older, and &s;lif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er, and &s;ettled in their ways, and think them&s;elves too good to be catechi&s;ed. You have a twig to bend, and we an oak: you have the young plants of &s;in to pluck up, and we the deep-rooted vices. The con&s;ciences of children are not &s;o &s;eared with a cu&s;tom of &s;inning, and long re&s;i&s;ting grace, as others. You have the &s;oft and tender earth to plough in, and we have the hard and &s;tony ways, that have been trodden on by many years practice of evil. We have a double ta&s;k, fir&s;t to unteach them, and then to teach them better; but you have but one. We mu&s;t unteach them all that the world, and the fle&s;h, and wicked company, and the devil have been diligently teaching them in many years. You have them before they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with prejudice again&s;t the truth; but we have them
<PB N="246" REF="022331_0245_0FB7F05B8865A498">to teach, when they have many years lived among tho&s;e that have taught them to think GOD'S ways to be fooli&s;h. Doth not the experience of all the world &s;hew you the power of education? What el&s;e makes all the children of the <HI>Jews</HI> to be <HI>Jews?</HI> And all the children of the <HI>Turks</HI> to be <HI>Mahometans?</HI> And of chri&s;tians to be in profe&s;&s;ion chri&s;tians? And of each &s;ect or party in religion to follow their parents? Now what an advantage have you to u&s;e all this for the furtherance of their happine&s;s!</P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider al&s;o, that you have the affections of your children more than any others: none in the world hath that intere&s;t in their hearts as you. You will receive that coun&s;el from an undoubted friend, that you would not do from an enemy, or a &s;tranger. Now, your children know you are their friends, and advi&s;e them in love; and they cannot but love you again. Nature hath almo&s;t nece&s;&s;itated them to love you. O therefore improve this your intere&s;t in them for their good!</P>
<P N="3">3. You have al&s;o the greate&s;t authority over them. You may command them, and they dare not di&s;obey you, or el&s;e it is your own fault, for the mo&s;t part; for you can make them obey you in your bu&s;ine&s;s; yea, you may correct them to enforce obedience. Your authority al&s;o is the mo&s;t unque&s;tionable autho|rity in the world. The authority of kings and par|liaments have been di&s;puted, but yours is pa&s;t di&s;pute. And therefore if you u&s;e it not to bring them to GOD, you are without excu&s;e.</P>
<P N="4">4. Be&s;ides, their dependance is on you for their maintenance. They know you can either give them, or deny them what you have, and &s;o puni&s;h and re|ward them at your lea&s;ure. But on mini&s;ters or neighbours they have no &s;uch dependance.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="247" REF="022331_0246_0FB7F06072ECF108">
5. Moreover, you that are parents know the tem|per and inclinations of your children, what vices they are mo&s;t inclined to, and what in&s;truction or reproof they mo&s;t need: but mini&s;ters cannot &s;o well know this.</P>
<P N="6">6. Above all, you are ever with them, and &s;o have opportunity, as you know their faults, &s;o to apply the remedy. You may be &s;till talking to them of the word of GOD, and minding them of their &s;tate and duty, and may follow and &s;et home every word of advice, as they are in the hou&s;e with you, or in the &s;hop, or in the field. O what an excellent advantage is this, if you have hearts to u&s;e it! E&s;pecially you mothers, remember this; you are more with your children while they are little ones than their fathers: be you therefore &s;till teaching them as &s;oon as ever they are capable of learning: you cannot do GOD &s;uch eminent &s;ervice your&s;elves as men; but you may train up children that may do it, and then you will have part of the comfort and honour. What a deal of pains are you at with the bodies of your children more than the fathers? And what do you &s;uffer to bring them into the world; and will not you be at as much pains for the &s;aving of their &s;ouls? You are naturally of more tender affections than men; and will it not move you to think that your children &s;hould peri&s;h for-ever? Therefore I be&s;eech you, for the &s;ake of the children of your bowels, teach them, ad|moni&s;h them, watch over them, and give them no re&s;t till you have brought them to <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>And thus I have &s;hewed you rea&s;on enough to make you diligent in teaching your children.</P>
<P>Let us next hear what is u&s;ually objected again&s;t this by negligent men.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="022331_0247_0FB7F0624C5A8D48">
Object. 1. We do not &s;ee but tho&s;e children prove as bad as others, that are taught the &s;criptures, and brought up &s;o holily; and tho&s;e prove as hone&s;t men, that have none of this ado with them.</P>
<P>An&s;w. Who art thou, O man, that di&s;pute&s;t again&s;t GOD? Hath GOD charged <HI>you to teach your children diligently his word, &s;peaking of it as you &s;it at home, and as you walk abroad, as you lie down, and as you ri&s;e up;</HI> and dare you reply, that it is as good let it alone? Why, this is to &s;et GOD at defiance; and as it were to &s;pit in his face, and give him the lie. Will you take it well at your &s;ervants, if when you command them to do a thing, they &s;hould return you an an|&s;wer, that they do not &s;ee but it were as good let it alone? Wretched worm! dare&s;t thou thus lift up thy head again&s;t the Lord that made thee, and mu&s;t judge thee? Is it not he that commandeth thee? If thou believe that this is the word of GOD, how dare&s;t thou &s;ay, It is as good di&s;obey it? This is devili&s;h pride indeed, when &s;uch &s;otti&s;h, &s;inful du&s;t &s;hall think them&s;elves wi&s;er than the living GOD.</P>
<P N="2">2. But what if &s;ome prove bad that are well brought up? It is not the generality of them. Will you &s;ay that <HI>Noah</HI>'s family was no better than the drowned world, becau&s;e there was one <HI>Ham</HI> in it? Nor <HI>Da|vid</HI>'s, becau&s;e there was one <HI>Ab&s;alom?</HI> Nor <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s, becau&s;e there was one <HI>Judas?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. But what if it were &s;o? Have men need of the le&s;s teaching, or the more? You have more wit in the matters of this world. You will not &s;ay, I &s;ee many labour hard, and yet are poor, and therefore it is as good never to labour at all: You will not &s;ay, many that go to &s;chool learn nothing, and therefore they may learn as much though they never go; or many that are great trade&s;men break, and therefore
<PB N="249" REF="022331_0248_0FB7F063D2D90AF0">it is as good never to trade at all; or many plough and &s;ow, and have nothing come up, and therefore it is as good never to plough more. What a fool were he that &s;hould rea&s;on thus! And is not he a thou&s;and times wor&s;e, that &s;hall rea&s;on thus for men's &s;ouls? <HI>Peter</HI> rea&s;ons the clean contrary way, <HI>If the righteous &s;carcely be &s;aved, where &s;hall the ungodly and &s;inner ap|pear,</HI> 1 Pet. iv. 18. And &s;o doth <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> Luke xiii. 24. <HI>Strive to enter in at the &s;trait gate; for many &s;hall &s;eek to enter, and not be able.</HI> Other men's mi&s;carri|ages &s;hould quicken our diligence, and not make us ca&s;t away all. What &s;hould you think of that man that &s;hould look over into his neighbour's garden, and becau&s;e he &s;ees here and there a nettle or weed among much better &s;tuff, &s;hould &s;ay, Why, you may &s;ee the&s;e men that be&s;tow &s;o much pains in digging and weeding, have weeds in their garden as well as I that do nothing, and therefore who would be at &s;o much pains? Ju&s;t thus doth the mad world talk. You may &s;ee now that tho&s;e that pray, and read, and fol|low &s;ermons, have their faults as well as we, and have wicked per&s;ons among them as well as we: yea, but that is not the whole garden, as yours is; it is but here and there a weed, and as &s;oon as they &s;py it, they pluck it up, and ca&s;t it away.</P>
<P>Object. 2. Some further object, it is the work of mini&s;ters to teach both us and our children, and there|fore we may be excu&s;ed.</P>
<P>An&s;wer 1. It is fir&s;t your duty, and then the mini|&s;ter's. It will be no excu&s;e for you, becau&s;e it is their work, except you could prove it were only theirs. Magi&s;trates mu&s;t govern both you and your children: doth it therefore follow that you mu&s;t not govern them? It belongs to the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">lma&s;ter to correct them, and doth it not belong al&s;o to you? There mu&s;t go many hands to this great work; as to the building of
<PB N="250" REF="022331_0249_0FB7F06791764E70">an hou&s;e there mu&s;t be many workmen, one to one part, and another to another, and one mu&s;t not leave their part, and &s;ay it belongs to the other: &s;o it is here in the in&s;tructing of your children; fir&s;t, you mu&s;t do your work, and then the mini&s;ter mu&s;t do his: you mu&s;t be doing it privately, night and day; the mini|&s;ter mu&s;t do it publicly and privately, as oft as he can.</P>
<P N="2">2. But as the ca&s;e now &s;tands with mini&s;ters, they are di&s;abled from doing that which belongs to their office, and therefore you cannot now ca&s;t your work on them. I will in&s;tance but in two things.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It belongs to their office to govern the church, and to teach with authority; and great and &s;mall are commanded to obey them, <HI>Heb.</HI> xiii. 7.17. But this is unknown, and hearers look on them&s;elves as free-men, that may obey or not, at their own plea|&s;ure. People think we have authority to &s;peak to them when they plea&s;e to hear, and no more. Nay, few of the godly them&s;elves under&s;tand the authority that their teachers have over them from <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> they know how to value a mini&s;ter's gifts, but not how they are bound to obey him becau&s;e of his office: not that they &s;hould obey him in evil, nor that he &s;hould be a final decider of all controver&s;ies, nor &s;hould exerci&s;e his au|thority in things of no moment; but as a &s;choolma&s;ter may command his &s;cholars when to come to &s;chool, and what book to read, and what form to be of, and as they ought to obey him, and learn of him, and not to &s;et their wits again&s;t his, but to take his word, and believe him as their teacher, till they under&s;tand as well as he, and are ready to leave his &s;chool; ju&s;t &s;o are the people bound to obey and learn of their teach|ers. Now this mini&s;terial authority is unknown, and &s;o mini&s;ters are the le&s;s capable of doing their work, which comes to pa&s;s,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. From the pride of man's na|ture,
<PB N="251" REF="022331_0250_0FB7F069E7947240">e&s;pecially novices, which makes men impatient of the reins of guidance and command:</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. From the Popi&s;h error of implicit faith; to avoid which we are driven as far into the contrary extreme: and</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. From the mode&s;ty of mini&s;ters, that are loth to &s;hew their commi&s;&s;ion, and make known their authority, le&s;t they &s;hould be thought proud: as if a pilot &s;hould let the &s;eamen run the &s;hip whither they will, for fear of being thought proud in exerci&s;ing his authority.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> A far greater clog than this doth lie upon mini&s;ters, which few take notice of; and that is, the fewne&s;s of mini&s;ters, and the greatne&s;s of congregati|ons. In the apo&s;tles time every church had a multi|tude of mini&s;ters, and &s;o it mu&s;t be again, or we &s;hall never come near that primitive pattern; and then they could preach publicly, and from hou&s;e to hou&s;e: but now, when there is but one or two mini&s;ters to many thou&s;and &s;ouls, we cannot teach them one by one. So that you &s;ee, you have lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le rea&s;on to ca&s;t your work on the mini&s;ters, but &s;hould the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">e help them by your diligence in your &s;everal fam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, becau&s;e they are already &s;o over-burdened.</P>
<P>Object. 3. But &s;ome will &s;ay, We a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> men and mu&s;t labour for our living, and &s;o mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ildren; we cannot have time to teach them the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">es, we have &s;omewhat el&s;e for them to do.</P>
<P>An&s;wer, And are not poor men &s;ubject <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> GOD, as well as rich? And are they not chri&s;tians? And mu&s;t they not give account of their ways? And have not your children &s;ouls to &s;ave or lo&s;e, as well as the rich? Cannot you find time to &s;peak to them as they are at their work? Have you not time to in&s;truct them on the Lord's day? You can find time to talk idly, as poor as you are; and can you find no time to talk of the way to life? You can find time on the Lord's day
<PB N="252" REF="022331_0251_0FB7F06E52A65A60">for your children to play, or walk or talk in the &s;treets, but no time to mind the life to come. Me|thinks you &s;hould rather &s;ay to your children, I have no lands to leave you; you have no hope of great mat|ters here; be &s;ure therefore to make the LORD your portion, that you may be happy hereafter; if you could get riches, they would &s;hortly leave you, but the riches of grace and glory will be everla&s;ting. Me|thinks you &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>As Peter, &s;ilver and gold I have none, but &s;uch as I have, I give you.</HI> The kingdoms of the world cannot be had by beggars, but the king|dom of heaven may.</P>
<P>O what a terrible reckoning will many poor men have, when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hall plead his cau&s;e, and judge them! May not he &s;ay, I made the way to worldly honours inac|ce&s;&s;ible to you, that you might not look after it for your&s;elves, or your children: but heaven I &s;et open, that you might have nothing to di&s;courage you: I confined riches and honours to a few; but my blood and &s;alva|tion I offered to all, that none might &s;ay, I was not invited: I tendered heaven to the poor, as well as the rich: I made no exception again&s;t the meane&s;t beggar; why then did you not come your&s;elves, and bring your children, and teach them the way to the eternal inhe|ritance? Do you &s;ay you were poor? Why, I did not &s;et heaven to &s;ale for money; I called tho&s;e that had nothing, to take it freely; only on condition they would take me for their Saviour and LORD, and give up them&s;elves to me in obedience and love.</P>
<P>What can you an&s;wer <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> when he &s;hall thus con|vince you? Is it not enough that your children are poor and mi&s;erable here, but you would have them be wor&s;e for everla&s;ting? If your children were beggars, yet if they were &s;uch beggars as <HI>Lazarus,</HI> they may be con|veyed by angels into the pre&s;ence of GOD. But be|lieve it, as GOD will &s;ave no man becau&s;e he is a gen|tleman,
<PB N="253" REF="022331_0252_0FB7F06FD6425D40">&s;o will he &s;ave no man becau&s;e he is a beg|gar. GOD hath &s;o ordered it in his providence, that riches are common occa&s;ions of men's damnation, and will you think poverty a &s;ufficient excu&s;e? The harde&s;t point in all our work is to be weaned from the world, and in love with heaven; and if you will not be weaned from it, that have nothing in it but labour and &s;orrow, you have no excu&s;e. The poor cannot have time, and the rich will not have time, or they are a&s;hamed to be &s;o forward: the young think it too &s;oon, and the old too late; and thus mo&s;t men in&s;tead of be|ing &s;aved, have &s;omewhat to &s;ay again&s;t their &s;alva|tion; and when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;endeth to invite them, they &s;ay, <HI>I pray thee have me excu&s;ed.</HI> O unworthy gue&s;ts of &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ed fea&s;t, and worthy to be turned into everla&s;ting burnings!</P>
<P>Object. 4. But &s;ome will object, we have been brought up in ignorance our&s;elves, and therefore we are unable to teach our children.</P>
<P>An&s;w. Indeed this is the very &s;ore of the land: but is it not a pity that men &s;hould &s;o receive their de&s;truction by tradition? Would you have this cour&s;e to go on thus &s;till? Your parents did not teach you, and therefore you cannot teach your children, and therefore they cannot teach theirs: by this cour&s;e the knowledge of GOD would be bani&s;hed out of the world, and never be recovered. But if your parents did not teach you, why did not you learn when you came to age? The truth is, you had no hearts for it; for be that hath not knowledge, cannot value it, or love it. But yet, though you have greatly &s;inned, it is not too late, if you will but follow my faithful advice in the&s;e four points.</P>
<P N="1">1. Get your hearts deeply &s;en&s;ible of your own &s;in and mi&s;ery, becau&s;e of this long time which you
<PB N="254" REF="022331_0253_0FB7F0762984FF70">have &s;pent in ignorance and neglect. Bethink your|&s;elves when you are alone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> did not GOD make you, and &s;u&s;tai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you for his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">? Should not he have had the youth and &s;trong<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of your &s;pirits? Did you live all this time at the door of eternity? What if you had died in ignorance, where had you been? What a deal of time have you &s;pent to little purpo&s;e? Your life is near done, and your work all undone. You are ready to die, before you have learned to live. Should not GOD have had a better &s;hare of your lives, and your &s;ouls been more regarded and provided for? In the mid&s;t of the&s;e thoughts, ca&s;t down your&s;elves in &s;orrow, as at the feet of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> bewail your felly, and beg pardon and recovering grace.</P>
<P N="2">2. Then think as &s;adly how you have wronged your children. If an unthrift that hath &s;old all his lands, will lament it for his children's &s;ake, as well as his own, much more &s;hould you.</P>
<P N="3">3. Next &s;et pre&s;ently to work, and learn your&s;elves. If you can read, do; if you cannot, get &s;ome that can; and be much among the&s;e that will in&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ct you: be not a&s;hamed to be &s;een among learners, but be a&s;hamed that you had not learned &s;ooner. GOD for|bid you &s;hould be &s;o mad, as to &s;ay, I am now too old to learn; except you be too old to &s;erve GOD, and be &s;aved, how can you be too old to learn to be &s;aved? Why not rather, I am too old to &s;erve the devil and the world, I have tried them too long to tru&s;t them any more. What if your parents had not taught you any trade to live by? Would not you have &s;et your&s;elves to learn, when you had come to age? Remember that you have &s;ouls to care for, as well as your children, and therefore fir&s;t begin with your&s;elves.</P>
<P N="4">4. While you are learning your&s;elves, teach your children what you do know; and what you cannot
<PB N="255" REF="022331_0254_0FB7F07753F1CA08">teach them your&s;elves, put them to learn of others that can: per&s;uade them into the company of tho&s;e who will be glad to in&s;truct them. Have you no neigh|bours that will be helpful to you herein? O do not keep your&s;elves &s;trange to them, but go among them, and de&s;ire their help, and be thankful to them, that they will entertain you in their company. GOD for|bid that you &s;hould be like tho&s;e that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;peaks of, <HI>Luke</HI> xi. 52. <HI>that would neither enter into the kingdom of God them&s;elves, nor &s;uffer tho&s;e that would to enter.</HI> GOD forbid you &s;hould be &s;uch barbarous wretches, as to hinder your children from being godly, and to teach them to be wicked! If any thing that walks in fle&s;h may be called a devil, I think it is a parent that hin|dereth his children from &s;alvation: nay, I will &s;ay more, I verily think that in this they are far wor&s;e than the devil. GOD is a righteous judge, and will not make the devil him&s;elf wor&s;e than he is: I pray you be patient while you con&s;ider it, and then judge your&s;elves. They are the parents of their children, and &s;o is not the devil: do you think then that it is as great a fault in him to &s;eek their de&s;truction, as in them? Is it as great a fault for the wolf to kill the lambs, as for their own dams to do it? Is it &s;o hor|rid a fault for an enemy in war to kill a child, or for a bear or a mad dog to kill it, as for the mother to da&s;h its brains again&s;t a wall? You know it is not: do you think then that it is &s;o hateful a thing in Satan to entice your children to fin and hell, and to di&s;courage and di&s;&s;uade them from holine&s;s, as it is in you? You are bound to love them by nature, more than Satan is. O then, what people are tho&s;e that will teach their children, in&s;tead of holine&s;s, to cur&s;e, and &s;wear, and rail, and back-bite, to be proud and revengeful, to break the Lord's day, and to de&s;pi&s;e his ways, to &s;peak wantonly and filthily, to &s;corn at holine&s;s, and glory in &s;in! O when GOD &s;hall a&s;k the&s;e children, where learned you this language and practice? and they &s;hall
<PB N="256" REF="022331_0255_0FB7F07992325340">&s;ay, I learned it of my father or mother: I would not be in the ca&s;e of tho&s;e parents for all the world! Alas, is it a work that is worth the teaching, to undo them|&s;elves for-ever? Or can they not without teaching learn it too ea&s;ily of them&s;elves? Do you need to teach a &s;erpent to &s;ting, or a lion to be fierce? Do you need to &s;ow weeds in your garden? Will they not grow of them&s;elves? To build an hou&s;e requires &s;kill and teaching, but a little may &s;erve to &s;et a town on fire: to heal the wounded or the &s;ick, requireth &s;kill; but to make a man &s;ick, or to kill him, requireth but lit|tle. You may &s;ooner teach your children to &s;wear, than to pray; and to mock at godline&s;s, than to be truly godly. If the&s;e parents were &s;worn enemies to their children, and &s;hould &s;tudy &s;even years how to do them the greate&s;t mi&s;chief, they could not po&s;&s;ibly find out a &s;urer way, than by drawing them to &s;in, and withdrawing them from GOD.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore conclude with this earne&s;t reque&s;t to all chri&s;tian parents that read the&s;e lines, that they would have compa&s;&s;ion on the &s;ouls of their poor chil|dren, and be faithful to the great tru&s;t GOD hath put on them. O &s;irs! If you cannot do what you would do for them, yet do what you can. Both church and &s;tate, city and country, groan under the neglect of this weighty duty; your children know not GOD, nor his laws; but take his name in vain, and &s;light his wor&s;hip: and you do neither in&s;truct them, nor correct them, and therefore GOD doth correct both them and you. You are &s;o tender of them, that GOD is the le&s;s tender both of them and you. Wonder not if GOD make you &s;mart for your childrens &s;ins; for you are guilty of all they commit, by your neglect of doing your duty to re&s;orm them; even as he that maketh a man drunk, is guilty of all the &s;in that he committeth in his drunkenne&s;s. Will you re|&s;olve therefore to &s;et upon this duty, and neglect it no longer? Remember <HI>Eli:</HI> your children are like

<P>You have heard that the GOD of heaven doth flatly command it; I charge every one of you therefore, up|on your allegiance to him, as you will very &s;hortly an&s;wer the contrary at your peril, that you will nei|ther refu&s;e or neglect this mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary work.

<P N="1">1. Teach them by your own example, as well as by your words. Be your&s;elves &s;uch as you would have them be: practice is the mo&s;t effectual teaching of children, who are addicted to imitation, e&s;pecially of their parents. Lead them the way to prayer, and reading, and other duties. Be not like ba&s;e com|manders, that will put on their &s;oldiers, but not go on them&s;elves. Can you expect your children &s;hould be wi&s;er or better than you? Let them not hear tho&s;e words out of your mouths, nor &s;ee tho&s;e practices in your lives, which you reprove in them. Who &s;hould lead the way in holine&s;s, but the father and ma&s;ter of the family?

<ITEM>6. That man broke this law, and &s;o forfeited his welfare, and became guilty of death as to him&s;elf, and all his po&s;terity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. That <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> the Son of GOD did here interpo&s;e, and pre|vent the full execution, undertaking to die in&s;tead of

<ITEM>8. That <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hereupon did make with man a better covenant, which pro|claimed pardon of &s;in to all that did but repent, and believe, and obey &s;incerely.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. That he revealed this covenant and mercy to the world by degrees: Fir&s;t, in darker promi&s;es, prophe&s;ies, and &s;acrifices; then in many ceremonious types; and then by more plain foretelling by the prophets.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. That in the fulne&s;s of time <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> came and took our nature into union with his Godhead, being conceived by the Holy Gho&s;t, and born of the virgin <HI>Mary.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>11. That while he was on earth, he lived a life of &s;orrows, was crowned with thorns, and bore the pains that our &s;ins de&s;erved; at la&s;t being crucified to death, and buried, &s;o &s;atisfied the ju&s;tice of GOD.</ITEM>
<ITEM>12. That he al&s;o preached to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and by con&s;tant miracles prov|ed the truth of his doctrines before thou&s;ands of wit|ne&s;&s;es: that he revealed more fully his new covenant, That who&s;oever will believe in him, and accept him for their Saviour and Lord, &s;hall be pardoned and &s;aved, and have a far greater glory than they lo&s;t; and they that will not, &s;hall lie under the cur&s;e and guilt, and be condemned to the everla&s;ting fire of hell.</ITEM>
<ITEM>13. That he ro&s;e again from the dead, having conquered death, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his do|minion over all, and &s;o a&s;cended up into heaven, and there reigneth in glory.</ITEM>
<ITEM>14. That before his a&s;|cen&s;ion he gave charge to his apo&s;tles to preach the go&s;pel to all nations and per&s;ons, and to offer <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and mercy, and life, to every one without excepti|on, and to entreat and per&s;uade them to receive him, and that he gave them authority to &s;end forth others on the &s;ame me&s;&s;age, and to baptize, and to gather churches, and confirm, and order them, and &s;ettle a cour&s;e for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of mini&s;ters and ordinances to the end of the world.</ITEM>
<ITEM>15. That he al&s;o gave them power to work frequent and evident miracles for the confirmation of their doctrine; and to annex their
<PB N="260" REF="022331_0259_0FB7F081087BD448">writings to the re&s;t of the &s;criptures, and &s;o to fini&s;h and &s;eal them up, and deliver them to the world as his infallible word, which none mu&s;t dare to alter, and which all mu&s;t ob&s;erve.</ITEM>
<ITEM>16. That for all his free grace is offered to the world, yet the heart is by na|ture &s;o de&s;perately wicked, that no man will believe and entertain <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;incerely, except by an almighty power he be changed and born again; and therefore doth <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;end forth his &s;pirit with his word, which worketh holine&s;s in our hearts, drawing us to GOD and the Redeemer.</ITEM>
<ITEM>17. That the means by which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> worketh and pre&s;erveth this grace, is the word read and preached, together with frequent fervent prayer, meditation, &s;acraments, and gracious confer|ence; and it is much furthered al&s;o by &s;pecial provi|dences keeping us from temptation; &s;itting occurren|ces to our advantage, drawing us by mercies, and driving us by afflictions; and therefore it mu&s;t be the great and daily care of every chri&s;tian to u&s;e faithful|ly all the ordinances, and improve all providences.</ITEM>
<ITEM>18. That though the new law or covenant be an ea|&s;y yoke, and there is nothing grievous in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s commands, yet &s;o bad are our hearts, and &s;o &s;trong our temptations, and &s;o diligent our enemies, that who&s;oever will be &s;aved, mu&s;t &s;trive, and watch, and be&s;tow his utmo&s;t care and pains, and deny his fle&s;h, and for&s;ake all that would draw him from <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and herein continue to the end, and overcome: and be|cau&s;e this cannot be done without continual &s;upplies of grace, whereof <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is the only fountain, there|fore we mu&s;t live in continual dependance on him by faith, and know <HI>that our life is hid with God in him.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>19. That <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> will thus by his word and &s;pirit ga|ther him a church our of all the world, which is his body, and &s;pou&s;e, and he their head and hu&s;band, and will be tender of them as the apple of his eyes, and pre&s;erve them from danger, and continue among them his pre&s;ence and ordinances; and that the members of

<ITEM>20 That when the full number of the&s;e are called home, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> will come down from heaven again, and rai&s;e all the dead, and &s;et them before him to be judged; and all that have loved GOD, and believed in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> been willing that he &s;hould reign over them, and have improved their mercies in the day of grace, them he will ju&s;ti|fy, and &s;entence them to inherit everla&s;ting glory; and tho&s;e that were not &s;uch, he will condemn to everlasting fire: both which &s;entences &s;hall be then executed accordingly.</ITEM>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Reproving our Expectations of Re&s;t on Earth.</HEAD>
<P>DOTH this re&s;t remain? How great then is our &s;in and folly to &s;eek and expect it here! Where &s;hall we find the chri&s;tian that de&s;erves not this re|proof? Surely we may all cry guilty to this. We know not how to enjoy convenient hou&s;es, goods, lands, and revenues, but we &s;eek re&s;t in the&s;e enjoy|ments. We &s;eldom, I fear, have &s;uch &s;weet and con|tenting thoughts of GOD and glory, as we have of our earthly delights. How much re&s;t do we &s;eek in build|ings, walks, apparel, ea&s;e, recreation, &s;leep, plea&s;ing meats and drinks, company, health and &s;trength, and long life? Nay, we can &s;carce enjoy the nece&s;&s;ary means that GOD hath appointed for our &s;piritual good, but we are &s;eeking re&s;t in them. Our books, our preachers, &s;ermons, friends, abilities for duty, do not our hearts quiet them&s;elves in them, even more than in GOD? Indeed, in words we di&s;claim,
<PB N="264" REF="022331_0263_0FB7F09851282E70">and GOD hath u&s;ually the pre-eminence in our tongues and profe&s;&s;ions: but do we not de&s;ire the&s;e more vi|olently when we want them, than we do the LORD him&s;elf? Do we not cry out more &s;en&s;ibly, O my friend, my goods, my health! than, O my GOD! Do we not mi&s;s mini&s;try and means more pa&s;&s;ionately than we mi&s;s our GOD? Do we not be&s;tir our&s;elves more to obtain and enjoy the&s;e, than we do to reco|ver our communion with GOD? Do we not delight more in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e, than we do in the fru|ition of GOD him&s;elf? Nay, are not tho&s;e mercies and duties more plea&s;ant to us, wherein we &s;tand at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from GOD? We can read, and &s;tudy, and confer, preach and hear, day after day, without much wearine&s;s; becau&s;e in the&s;e we have to do with in&s;truments and creatures: but in &s;ecret pray|er and conver&s;ing with GOD immediately, where no creature interpo&s;eth, how dull, how heartle&s;s and weary are we! And if we lo&s;e creatures or means, doth it not trouble us more than our lo&s;s of GOD? If we lo&s;e but a friend, or health, all the town will hear of it: but we can mi&s;s our GOD and &s;carce be|moan our mi&s;ery. Thus it is apparent, we make the creature our re&s;t. It is not enough, that they are re|fre&s;hing helps in our way to heaven; but they mu&s;t al&s;o be made our heaven it&s;elf. Reader, I would as willingly make thee &s;en&s;ible of this &s;in, as of any &s;in in the world; for the LORD'S greate&s;t quarrel with us is in this point. Therefore I mo&s;t carne&s;tly be&s;eech thee to pre&s;s upon thine own con&s;cience the&s;e follow|ing con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is gro&s;s idolatry to make any creature or means our re&s;t: to &s;ettle the &s;oul upon it, and &s;ay, now I am well, upon the bare enjoyment of the crea|ture: what is this, but to make it our God? Cer|tainly, to be the &s;oul's re&s;t is GOD'S own prerogative. And as it is palpable idolatry to place our re&s;t in
<PB N="265" REF="022331_0264_0FB7F09AAF97A3B8">riches and honours; &s;o it is but a more refined idola|try to take up our re&s;t in excellent means, in the church's pro&s;perity, and in its reformation. When we would have all that out of GOD, which is to be had only in GOD; what is this but to run away from him to the creature, and in our hearts to deny him? When we fetch more of our comfort from the thoughts of pro&s;perity, and tho&s;e mercies which we have at a di&s;tance from GOD, than from the fore-thoughts of our everla&s;ting ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in him. Are we chri&s;tians in judgment, and pagans in affection? Do we give our &s;en&s;es leave to be the choo&s;ers of our happine&s;s, while rea&s;on and faith &s;tand by? O how ill mu&s;t our dear LORD needs take it, when we give him cau&s;e to complain, as &s;ometime he did of our fellow-idolaters, <HI>Jer.</HI> l. 6. that we have been lo&s;t &s;heep, and have for|gotten our re&s;ting-place! When we give him cau&s;e to &s;ay, my people can find re&s;t in any thing rather than in me! They can find delight in one another, but none in me; they can rejoice in my creatures and or|dinances, but not in me; yea, in their very labours and duty they &s;eek for re&s;t, but not in me; they had rather be any where than be with me: are the&s;e their gods? Have the&s;e delivered and redeemed them? Will the&s;e be better to them than I have been, or than I would be? If your&s;elves have but a wife, a hu&s;band, a &s;on, that had rather be any where than in your company, and is never &s;o merry as when fur|the&s;t from you, would you not take it ill your&s;elves? Why &s;o mu&s;t our GOD needs do. For what do we but lay the&s;e things in one end of the balance, and GOD in the other, and fooli&s;hly prefer them before him? As <HI>Elkanah</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Hannah, Am not I better to thee than ten &s;ons?</HI> So when we are longing after crea|tures, we may hear GOD &s;ay, am not I better than all the creatures to thee?</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="266" REF="022331_0265_0FB7F09C55497680">
2. Con&s;ider how thou contradicte&s;t the end of GOD in giving the&s;e things. He gave them to help thee to him, and do&s;t thou take up with them in his &s;tead? He gave them that they might be refre&s;hments in thy journey; and would&s;t thou now dwell in thy inn, and go no further? Thou do&s;t not only contra|dict GOD herein, but lo&s;e&s;t that benefit which thou mighte&s;t receive by them, yea, and make&s;t them thy great hurt and hinderance. Surely, it may be &s;aid of all our comforts and all ordinances, and the ble&s;&s;ede&s;t enjoyments in the church on earth, as GOD &s;aid to the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> of his ark, <HI>Numb.</HI> x. 33. <HI>The ark of the covenant went before them, to &s;earch out for them a re&s;t|ing-place.</HI> So do all GOD'S mercies here. They are not that re&s;t, (as <HI>John</HI> profe&s;&s;eth he was not the <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>) but they are voices crying in this wilderne&s;s, to bid us prepare; for the kingdom of GOD, our true re&s;t, is at hand. Therefore to re&s;t here, were to turn all mercies clean contrary to their own ends, and our own advantages, and to de&s;troy our&s;elves with that which &s;hould help us.</P>
<P N="3">3. Con&s;ider, whether it be not the mo&s;t probable way, to cau&s;e GOD, either, fir&s;t, to deny tho&s;e mer|cies which we de&s;ire; or, &s;econdly, to take from us the&s;e which we enjoy; or, thirdly, to imbitter them, or cur&s;e them to us? Certainly, GOD is no where &s;o jealous as here: if you had a &s;ervant whom your wife loved better than &s;he did your&s;elf, would you not take it ill of &s;uch a wife, and rid your hou&s;e of &s;uch a &s;ervant? Why &s;o, if the LORD &s;ee you begin to &s;ettle in the world, and &s;ay, here I will re&s;t, no wonder if he &s;oon in his jealou&s;y un&s;ettle you. If he love you, no wonder if he take that from you wherewith he &s;ees you about to de&s;troy your&s;elves.</P>
<P>It hath been long my ob&s;ervation of many, that when they have attempted great works, and have ju&s;t
<PB N="267" REF="022331_0266_0FB7F0A08E059980">fini&s;hed them; or have aimed at great things in the world, and have ju&s;t obtained them; or have lived in much trouble, and ju&s;t come to begin with &s;ome content to look upon their condition, and re&s;t in it, they are near to death and ruin. When a man is once at this language, <HI>Soul, take thy ea&s;e;</HI> the next news u&s;ually is, <HI>Thou fool, this night,</HI> or this month, or this year, <HI>&s;hall thy &s;oul be required of thee, and then who&s;e &s;hall the&s;e things be?</HI> O what hou&s;e is there where this fool dwelleth not? Let you and I con&s;ider, whether this be not our own ca&s;e. Have not I after &s;uch an un&s;ettled life, and after &s;o many longings and prayers for the&s;e days! Have not I thought of them with too much content, and been ready to &s;ay, <HI>Soul, take thy re&s;t?</HI> Have not I comforted my&s;elf more in the fore-thoughts of enjoying the&s;e, than of com|ing to heaven, and enjoying GOD? What wonder then if GOD cut me off, when I am ju&s;t &s;itting down in this &s;uppo&s;ed re&s;t? And hath not the like been your condition? Many of you have been &s;oldiers, driven from hou&s;e and home, endured a life of trou|ble and blood, been deprived of mini&s;try and means: did you not reckon up all the comforts you &s;hould have at your return; and glad your hearts with &s;uch thoughts, more than with the thoughts of your com|ing to heaven? Why, what wonder if GOD now cro&s;s you, and turn &s;ome of your joy into &s;adne&s;s? Many a &s;ervant of GOD hath been de&s;troyed from the earth, by being over-valued and over-loved. I pray GOD you may take warning for the time to come, that you rob not your&s;elves of all your mercies. I am per|&s;uaded, our di&s;contents and murmurings are not &s;o provoking to GOD, nor &s;o de&s;tructive to the &s;inner, as our too &s;weet enjoying, and re&s;t of &s;pirit, in a plea&s;ing &s;tate. If GOD hath cro&s;&s;e any of you in wife, children, goods, friends, either by taking them from you, or the comfort of them: try whether this be not the cau&s;e; for where&s;oever your de&s;ires &s;top,
<PB N="268" REF="022331_0267_0FB7F0A213020B08">and you &s;ay, now I am well; that condition you make your god, and engage the jealou&s;y of GOD again&s;t it. Whether you be friends to GOD or ene|mies, you can never expect that GOD &s;hould &s;uffer you quietly to enjoy your idols.</P>
<P N="4">4. Con&s;ider, if GOD &s;hould &s;uffer thee thus to take up thy re&s;t here, it were one of the greate&s;t cur&s;es that could befal thee: it were better for thee if thou never haf&s;t a day of ea&s;e in the world; for then wearine&s;s might make thee &s;eek after true re&s;t. But if he &s;hould &s;uffer thee to &s;it down and re&s;t here, where were thy re&s;t when this deceives thee? A re&s;tle&s;s wretch thou would&s;t be through all eternity. To have their good things on the earth, is the lot of the mo&s;t mi&s;erable peri&s;hing &s;inners. Doth it become chri&s;tians then to expect &s;o much here? Our re&s;t is our heaven; and where we take our re&s;t, there we make our heaven: and would&s;t thou have but &s;uch a heaven as this? It will be but a handful of waters to a man that is drowning, which will help to de&s;troy, but not to &s;ave him.</P>
<P N="5">5. Con&s;ider, thou &s;eeke&s;t re&s;t where it is not to be found, and &s;o wilt lo&s;e all thy labour. I think I &s;hall ea&s;ily evince this by the&s;e clear demon&s;trations following:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Our re&s;t is only in the full obtaining our ulti|mate end; but that is not to be expected in this life. Is GOD to be enjoyed in the be&s;t reformed church here, as he is in heaven? You confe&s;s he is not; how little of GOD, (not only) the multitude of the blind world, but &s;ometimes the &s;aints them&s;elves enjoy! And how poor comforters are the be&s;t ordinances and enjoyments without GOD! Should a traveller take up his re&s;t in the way? No, becau&s;e his home is his jour|ney's en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. When you have all that creatures and means
<PB N="269" REF="022331_0268_0FB7F0A722161EB8">can afford, have you that you &s;ought for? Have you that you believe, pray, &s;uffer for? I think you dare not &s;ay &s;o. Why then do we once dream of re&s;ting here? We are like little children &s;trayed from home; and GOD is now fetching us home; and we are readly to turn into any hou&s;e, &s;tay and play with every thing in our way, and &s;it down on every green bank, and much ado there is to get us home.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As we have not yet obtained our end, &s;o are we in the mid&s;t of labours and dangers; and is there any re&s;ting here? What painful work doth lie upon our hands! Look to our brethren, to our &s;ouls, to GOD; and what a deal of work in re&s;pect of each of the&s;e, doth lie before us! And can we re&s;t in our labours? Indeed we may ea&s;e our&s;elves &s;ometimes in our troubles; but that is not the re&s;t we are now &s;peaking of; we may re&s;t on earth, as the ark is &s;aid to re&s;t in the mid&s;t of <HI>Jordan, J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h.</HI> iii. 13. Or as the angels of heaven are de&s;ired to turn in, and re&s;t them on earth. <HI>Gen.</HI> xviii. 4. They would have been loth to have taken up their dwelling there. Should <HI>I&s;rael</HI> have &s;ettled his re&s;t in the wilderne&s;s, among &s;erpents, and enemies, and wearine&s;s and famine? Should <HI>Noah</HI> have made the ark his home, and been loth to come forth when the waters were fallen? Should the mariner choo&s;e his dwelling on the &s;ea. and &s;ettle his re&s;t in the mid&s;t of rocks, and &s;ands, and tempe&s;ts? Though he may adventure through all the&s;e, for a commodity of worth: yet I think he takes it not for his re&s;t. Should a &s;oldier re&s;t in the mid&s;t of fight, when he is in the very thicke&s;t of his enemies? And are not chri&s;tians &s;uch travellers, &s;uch mariners, &s;uch &s;oldiers?

<P>WE have now by the guidance of the word of the LORD, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Spirit, &s;hewed you the nature of the re&s;t of the &s;aints; and acquainted you with &s;ome duties in relation thereto: We come now to the clo&s;e of all, to pre&s;s you to the great duty which I chiefly intended when I begun this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Is there a re&s;t, and &s;uch a re&s;t remaining for us? Why then are our thoughts no more upon it? Why are not our hearts continually there? Why dwell we not there in con&s;tant contemplation? A&s;k your hearts in good earne&s;t, What is the cau&s;e of this neglect? Hath the eternal GOD provided us &s;uch a glory, and promi&s;ed to take us up to dwell with him&s;elf? And is not this worth the thinking on? Should not the &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ge&s;t de&s;ires of our hearts be after it; and the daily delights of our &s;ouls be there? Can we forget and neglect it? What is the matter? Will not GOD give us leave to approach this light? Or will he not &s;uffer our &s;ouls to ta&s;te and &s;ee it? Then what mean all his earne&s;t invitations? Why doth he &s;o condemn our earthly-mindedne&s;s, and command us to &s;et our af|fections above? If the fore-thoughts of glory were forbidden fruits, perhaps we &s;hould be &s;ooner drawn unto them. Sure I am, where GOD hath forbidden us to place our thoughts and our delights, thither it is ea&s;y enough to draw them. If he &s;ay, love not the world, nor the things of the world, we doat up|on it neverthele&s;s. How unweariedly can we think of vanity, and day after day employ our minds about it! And have we no thoughts of this our re&s;t? How
<PB N="276" REF="022331_0275_0FB7F0BA36CFE7F8">freely and how frequently can we think of our plea|&s;ures, our friends, our labours, our fle&s;h, our &s;tudies, our news; yea, our very mi&s;eries, our wrongs, our &s;ufferings, and our fears! But where is the chri&s;tian who&s;e heart is on this re&s;t? What is the matter? Why are we not taken up with the views of glory, and our &s;ouls more accu&s;tomed to the&s;e delightful medita|tions? Are we &s;o full of joy that we need no more; or is there no matter in heaven for our joyous thoughts; or rather, are not our hearts carnal and blocki&s;h? Earth will tend to earth. Had we more &s;pirit, it would be otherwi&s;e with us. As St. <HI>Augu&s;tin</HI> ca&s;t by <HI>Cicero</HI>'s writings, becau&s;e they contained not the name of <HI>Je&s;us;</HI> &s;o let us humble and ca&s;t down the&s;e &s;en|&s;ual hearts, that have in them no more of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and glory. As we &s;hould not own our duties any further than &s;omewhat of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is in them, &s;o &s;hould we no further own our hearts: and as we &s;hould delight in the creatures no longer than they have reference to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and eternity, &s;o no further &s;hould we approve of our own hearts. Why did <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> pronounce his di&s;ciples eyes and ears ble&s;&s;ed, but as they were the doors to let in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> by his works and words into their heart? Ble&s;&s;ed are the eyes that &s;o &s;ee, and the ears that &s;o hear, that the heart is thereby rai&s;ed to this heavenly frame. Sirs, &s;o much of your hearts as is empty of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and heaven, let it be filled with &s;hame and &s;orrow, and not with ea&s;e.</P>
<P>But let me turn my reprehen&s;ion to exhortation, that you would turn this conviction into reformation. And I have the more hope, becau&s;e I here addre&s;s my&s;elf to men of con&s;cience, that dare not wilfully di&s;obey GOD; yea, becau&s;e to men who&s;e portion is there, who&s;e hopes are ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd who have for&s;aken all that they may enjoy this glory; and &s;hall I be di&s;|couraged from per&s;uading &s;uch to be heavenly-mind|ed?

<PB N="278" REF="022331_0277_0FB7F0C165C459A8">the temptations and hinderances will be many and great, and therefore I fear all the&s;e per&s;ua&s;ions are lit|tle enough: &s;ay not, We are unable to &s;et our own hearts on heaven, this mu&s;t be the work of GOD: therefore all your exhortation is in vain. I tell you, though GOD be the chief di&s;po&s;er of your hearts, yet next under him you have the greate&s;t command of them your&s;elves, and a great power in the ordering of your own thoughts, and determining your own wills: though without <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> you can do nothing, yet under him you may do much, and mu&s;t do much, or el&s;e you will be undone through your neglect: do your own parts, and you have no cau&s;e to di&s;tru&s;t whether <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> will do his.</P>
<P>I will here lay down &s;ome con&s;iderations, which if you will but deliberately weigh with an impartial judgment, I doubt not will prove effectual with your hearts, and make you re&s;olve upon this excellent duty.</P>
<P N="1">1. Con&s;ider, a heart &s;et upon heaven, will be one of the mo&s;t unque&s;tionable evidences of a true work of &s;aving grace upon thy &s;oul. Would you have a &s;ign infallible, not from me, or from the mouth of any man, but from the mouth of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf, which all the enemies of the u&s;e of marks can lay no exceptions again&s;t? Why here is &s;uch a one, <HI>Ma&s;t.</HI> vi. 21. <HI>Where your trea&s;ure is, there will your heart be al&s;o.</HI> Know once a&s;&s;uredly where your heart is, and you may ea&s;ily know that your trea&s;ure is there. GOD is the &s;aints trea&s;ure and happine&s;s: heaven is the place where they fully enjoy him: a heart there|fore &s;et upon heaven, is no more but a heart &s;et upon GOD, de&s;iring this full enjoyment: and &s;urely a heart &s;et upon GOD through <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> is the true&s;t evi|dence of &s;aving grace. External actions are the ea&s;ie&s;t di&s;covered; but tho&s;e of the heart are the &s;ure&s;t evidences. When thy learning will be no good proof
<PB N="279" REF="022331_0278_0FB7F0C3DFDC1508">of thy grace; when thy knowledge, thy duties, and thy gifts will fail thee, when arguments from thy tongue and thy hand may be confuted; then will this argument from the bent of thy heart prove thee &s;in|cere. Take a poor chri&s;tian that can &s;carce &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> about religion, that hath a weak under&s;tand|ing, a failing memory, a &s;tammering tongue, yet his heart is &s;et on GOD, he hath cho&s;en him for his por|tion, his thoughts are on eternity, his de&s;ires there, his dwelling there; he cries out, O that I were there! he takes that day for a time of impri&s;onment, where|in he hath not taken one refre&s;hing view of eternity. I had rather die in this man's condition, than in the ca&s;e of him that hath the mo&s;t eminent gifts, and is mo&s;t admired for parts and duty, who&s;e heart is not taken up with GOD. The man that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> will find out at the la&s;t day, and condemn for want of a wed|ding-garment, will he be that wants this frame of heart. The que&s;tion will not then he, how much you have known or talked? but, how much have you loved, and where was your heart? Why then, as you would have a &s;ure te&s;timony of the love of GOD, and a &s;ure proof of your title to glory, labour to get your hearts above. GOD will acknowledge you love him, when he &s;ees your hearts are &s;et upon him. Get but your hearts once truly in heaven, and without all que&s;tion your&s;elves will follow. If &s;in and &s;atan keep not thence your affections, they will never be able to keep away your per&s;ons.</P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider, a heavenly mind is a joyful mind: this is the neare&s;t and the true&s;t way to comfort; and without this you mu&s;t needs be uncomfortable. Can a man be at the fire, and not be warm? or in the &s;un&s;hine, and not have light? Can your heart be in heaven, and not have comfort? What could make &s;uch frozen uncomfortable chri&s;tians, but living &s;o far as they do from heaven? And what makes others &s;o
<PB N="280" REF="022331_0279_0FB7F0C61BC94BE8">warm in comforts, but their frequent acce&s;s &s;o near to GOD? When the &s;un in the &s;pring draws near our part of the earth, how do all things congratulate its approach! The earth looks green and ca&s;teth off her mourning habit; the trees &s;hoot forth; the plants revive; the birds &s;ing; the face of all things &s;miles upon us, and all the creatures below rejoice. If we would but keep the&s;e hearts above, what a &s;pring would be within us; and all our graces be fre&s;h and green! How would the face of our &s;ouls be changed, and all that is within us rejoice! How &s;hould we forget our winter-&s;orrows, and withdraw our &s;ouls from our &s;ad retirements! How early &s;hould we ri&s;e (as the&s;e birds in the &s;pring) to &s;ing the prai&s;e of our great Creator! O chri&s;tian! get above; believe it, that region is warmer than this below. Tho&s;e that have been there have found it &s;o, and tho&s;e that have come thence have told us &s;o; and I doubt not but thou ha&s;t &s;ometimes tried it thy&s;elf. I dare appeal to thy own experience: when is it that you have large&s;t comforts? Is it not after &s;uch an exerci&s;e as this, when thou ha&s;t got up thy heart, and conver&s;ed with GOD, and talked with the inhabitants of the higher world, and viewed the man&s;ions of the &s;aints and an|gels, and filled thy &s;oul with the fore-thoughts of glory? If thou knowe&s;t by experience what this prac|tice is, I dare &s;ay thou knowe&s;t what &s;piritual joy is. If it be the countenance of GOD that fills us with joy, then they that mo&s;t behold it, mu&s;t be ful e&s;t of the&s;e joys. If you never tried this, nor lived this life of heavenly contemplation, I never wonder that you walk uncomfortably, and know not what the joy of the &s;aints means: can you have comforts from GOD, and never think of him? Can heaven rejoice you when you do not remember it? Doth any thing in the world glad you, when you think not on it? Whom &s;hould we blame then, that we are &s;o void of con&s;olation, but our own negligent un&s;kilful hearts?
<PB N="281" REF="022331_0280_0FB7F0C78E487E80">GOD hath provided us a crown of glory, and pro|mi&s;ed to &s;et it &s;hortly on our heads, and we will not &s;o much as think of it: he holdeth it out to us, and biddeth us behold and rejoice; and we will not &s;o much as look at it. What a perver&s;e cour&s;e is this, both again&s;t GOD and our own joys!</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, though in fle&s;hly things the pre&s;enting a comforting object is &s;ufficient to produce an an&s;wera|ble delight, yet in &s;pirituals we are more di&s;abled: GOD mu&s;t give the joy it&s;elf, as well as afford us matter for joy: but yet withal, it mu&s;t be remem|bered, that GOD doth work upon us as men, and in a rational way doth rai&s;e our comforts: he enableth and exciteth us to mind the&s;e delightful objects, and from thence to gather our own comforts; therefore he that is mo&s;t &s;kilful and painful in this gathering art, is u&s;ually the fulle&s;t of the &s;piritual &s;weetne&s;s. It is by believing that we are filled with joy and peace; and no longer than we continue our believing. It is in hope that the &s;aints rejoice, yea, in this hope of the glory of GOD; and no longer than they continue hoping. And here let me warm you of a dangerous &s;nare, an opinion which will rob you of all your com|fort: &s;ome think, if they &s;hould thus fetch in their own by believing and hoping, and work it out of &s;cripture-promi&s;es by their own thinking and &s;tudy|ing, then it would be a comfort only of their own hammering out (as they &s;ay) and not the genuine joy of the Holy Gho&s;t. A de&s;perate mi&s;take, rai&s;ed up|on a ground that would overthrow almo&s;t all duty, as well as this; which is their &s;etting the workings of GOD'S &s;pirit and their own &s;pirits in oppo&s;ition, when their &s;pirits mu&s;t &s;tand in &s;ubordination to GOD'S: they are conjunct cau&s;es, co-operating to the produc|ing of one and the &s;ame effect. GOD'S &s;pirit work|eth our comforts by &s;etting our own &s;pirits at work upon the promi&s;es, and rai&s;ing our thoughts to the
<PB N="282" REF="022331_0281_0FB7F0C910094D08">place of our comforts. As you would delight a co|vetous man by &s;hewing him money, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a voluptuous man with fle&s;hly delights; &s;o GOD u&s;eth to delight his people, by taking them as it were by the hand, and leading them into heaven, and &s;hewing them him&s;elf, and their re&s;t with him. GOD u&s;eth not to ca&s;t in our joys while we are idle, or taken up with other things. It is true, he &s;ometimes doth it &s;ud|denly, but u&s;ually in the afore&s;aid order: and his &s;ometimes &s;udden, extraordinary ca&s;ting of comfort|ing thoughts in our hearts, &s;hould be &s;o far from hin|dering endeavours in a meditating way, that it &s;hould be a &s;ingular motive to quicken us to it; even as a ta&s;te given us of &s;ome cordial, will make us de&s;ire and &s;eek the re&s;t. GOD feedeth not &s;aints as birds do their young, bringing it to them, and putting it in their mouth, while they lie &s;till in the ne&s;t, and only gape to receive it: but as he giveth to man the fruits of the earth, the increa&s;e of our land in corn and wine, while we plough and &s;ow, and weed, and wa|ter, and dung, and dre&s;s, and then with patience ex|pect his ble&s;&s;ing; &s;o doth he give the joys of the &s;oul. Yet I deny not, that if any &s;hould think to work out his own comforts by meditation, as to attempt the work in his own &s;trength, the work would prove to be like the workman, and the comfort he would gather would be like both; even mere vanity; even as the hu&s;bandman's labour without the &s;un, and rain, and ble&s;&s;ing of GOD.</P>
<P>So then you may ea&s;ily &s;ee, that clo&s;e meditation on the matter and cau&s;e of your joy, is GOD'S way to procure &s;olid joy. For my part, if I &s;hould find my joy of another kind, I &s;hould be very prone to doubt of its &s;incerity. If I find a great deal of com|fort, and know not how it came, nor upon what ra|tional ground it was rai&s;ed, nor what con&s;iderations feed and continue it, I &s;hould be ready to que&s;tion
<PB N="283" REF="022331_0282_0FB7F0CCD42B0278">whether this be from GOD. Our love to GOD &s;hould not be like that of fond lovers, who love violently, but they know not why. I think a chri&s;tian's joy &s;hould be rational joy, and not to rejoice and know not why. In &s;ome extraordinary ca&s;e, GOD may ca&s;t in &s;uch an extraordinary kind of joy; yet it is not his u&s;ual way. And if you ob&s;erve the &s;pirit of mo&s;t un|comfortable chri&s;tians, you will find the rea&s;on to be their expectation of &s;uch kind of joys; and according|ly are their &s;pirits variou&s;ly to&s;&s;ed, and incon&s;tantly tempered: when they meet with &s;uch joys, then the&s;e are cheerful and lifted up; but becau&s;e the&s;e are u&s;u|ally &s;hort-lived, therefore they are &s;traight as low as hell. And thus they are to&s;&s;ed as a ve&s;&s;el at &s;ea, up and down, but &s;till in extremes; whereas alas, GOD is mo&s;t con&s;tant, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> the &s;ame, heaven the &s;ame, and the promi&s;e the &s;ame; and if we took the right cour&s;e for fetching in our comfort from the&s;e, &s;ure our comforts would be more &s;ettled and con&s;tant, tho' not always the &s;ame. Whoever thou art therefore that reade&s;t the&s;e lines, I entreat thee in the name of the LORD, and as thou value&s;t the life of con&s;tant joy, and that good con&s;cience which is a continual fea&s;t, that thou would&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly &s;et upon this work, and learn the art of heavenly-mindedne&s;s, and thou &s;halt find the increa&s;e an hundred fold, and the benefit abundantly exceed thy labour.</P>
<P N="3">3. Con&s;ider, a heart in heaven will be a mo&s;t ex|cellent pre&s;ervative again&s;t temptations, and a power|ful means to &s;ave the con&s;cience from the wounds of &s;in: GOD can prevent our &s;inning, though we be carele&s;s, and &s;ometimes doth; but this is not his u&s;u|al cour&s;e; nor is this our &s;afe&s;t way to e&s;cape. When the mind is either idle, or ill employed, the devil needs not a greater advantage: if he find but the mind empty, there is room for any thing that he will bring in; but when he finds the heart in heaven, what
<PB N="284" REF="022331_0283_0FB7F0CE763D3930">hope that his motions &s;hould take? Let him entice to any forbidden cour&s;e, the &s;oul will return <HI>Nehe|miah</HI>'s an&s;wer, <HI>I am doing a great work, and cannot come,</HI> Neh. vi. 3. Several ways will this pre&s;erve us again&s;t temptation. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By keeping the heart em|ployed. <HI>Secondly,</HI> By clearing the under&s;tanding, and confirming the will. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> By pre-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the affections. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> By keeping us in the way of GOD's ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, By keeping the heart employed: when we are idle, we tempt the devil to tempt us; as it is an encouragement to a thief, to &s;ee your doors open, and nobody within; and as we u&s;e to &s;ay, <Q>Carele&s;s per|&s;ons make thieves;</Q> &s;o it will encourage Satan, to find your hearts idle: but when the heart is taken up with GOD, it cannot have time to hearken to tempta|tions: it cannot have time to be lu&s;tful and wanton, ambitious or worldly.</P>
<P>If you were but bu&s;ied in your lawful callings, you would not be &s;o ready to hearken to temptations: much le&s;s if you were bu&s;ied above with GOD: will you leave your plough and harve&s;t in the field? Or leave the quenching of a fire in your hou&s;es, to run hunting of butterflies? Would a judge ri&s;e, when he is &s;itting upon life and death, to go and play among the boys in the &s;treets? No more will a chri&s;tian, when he is bu&s;y with GOD, give ear to the alluring charms of Satan. The love of GOD is never idle; it worketh great things where it truly is; and when it will not work, it is not love. Therefore being &s;till thus working, it is &s;till pre&s;erving.</P>
<P>Secondly, A heavenly mind is free&s;t from &s;in, be|cau&s;e it is of cleare&s;t under&s;tanding in &s;piritual mat|ters. A man that is much in conver&s;ing above, hath truer and livelier apprehen&s;ions of things concerning
<PB N="285" REF="022331_0284_0FB7F0CFC9890270">GOD and his &s;oul, than any reading or learning can beget: though perhaps he may be ignorant in divers controver&s;ies, and matters that le&s;s concern &s;alvation; yet tho&s;e truths which mu&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h his &s;oul, and pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;erve him from temptation, he knows far better than the greate&s;t &s;cholars; he hath &s;o deep an in&s;ight into the evil of &s;in, the vanity of the creature, the bruti&s;hne&s;s of &s;en&s;ual delights, that temptations have little power on him; for the&s;e earthly vanities are Sa|tan's baits, which with the clear-&s;ighted have lo&s;t their force. <HI>In vain</HI> (&s;aith <HI>Solomon) the net is &s;pread in the &s;ight of any bird.</HI> And in vain doth Satan lay his &s;nares to ontrap the &s;oul that plainly &s;ees them. When the heavenly mind is above with GOD, he may from thence di&s;cern every danger that lies below: nay, if he did not di&s;cover the &s;nare, yet were he likelier far to e&s;cape it than any others. A net or bait that is laid on the ground, is unlikely to catch the bird that flies in the air; while &s;he keeps above, &s;he is out of the danger, and the higher the &s;afer; &s;o it is with us. Satan's temptations are laid on the earth, earth is the place, and earth is the ordinary bait: how &s;hall the&s;e en&s;nare the chri&s;tian, who hath left the earth and walks with GOD?</P>
<P>Do you not &s;en&s;ibly perceive, that when your hearts are &s;eriou&s;ly fixed on heaven, you become wi&s;er than before? Are not your under&s;tandings more &s;olid; and your thoughts more &s;ober? Have you not truer appre|hen&s;ions of things than you had? For my own part, if ever I be wi&s;e, it is when I have been much above, and &s;eriou&s;ly &s;tudied the life to come: methinks I find my under&s;tanding after &s;uch contemplations, as much to differ from what it was before, as I before differed from a fool or an idiot: when my under&s;tanding is weakened and befooled with common employment, and with conver&s;ing long with the vanities below, me|thinks a few &s;ober thoughts of my Father's hou&s;e, and
<PB N="286" REF="022331_0285_0FB7F0D16D78D2C8">the ble&s;&s;ed provi&s;ion of his family in heaven, doth make me (with the prodigal) to come to my&s;elf again. Surely, when a chri&s;tian withdraws him&s;elf from his earthly thoughts, and begins to conver&s;e with GOD in heaven, he is as <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> taken from the bea&s;ts of the field to the throne, and his under&s;tanding returneth to him again. O when a chri&s;tian hath had but a glimp&s;e of eternity, and then looks down on the world again, how doth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;ay to his laughter, <HI>Thou art mad!</HI> And to his vain mirth, <HI>What d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t thou?</HI> How could he even tear his fle&s;h, and take revenge on him&s;elf for his folly! How verily doth he think that there is no man in <HI>Bedlam</HI> &s;o mad, as wilful &s;inners, and lazy betrayers of their own &s;ouls, and unworthy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ighters of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and glory!</P>
<P>Do you not think (except men are &s;tark devils) that it would be a harder matter to entice a man to &s;in, when he lies a dying, than it was bef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re? If the de|vil, or his in&s;truments, &s;hould then tell him of a cup of &s;ack, of merry company, or of a &s;tage-play, do you think he would then be &s;o taken with the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion? If he &s;hould then tell him of riches, or honours, or &s;hew him cards, or dice, or a whore, would the tempta|tion (think you) be as &s;trong as before? Would he not an&s;wer, Alas! what is all this to me, who mu&s;t pre&s;ently appear before GOD, and give account of all my life, and &s;traightways be in another world? Why, if the apprehen&s;ion of the nearne&s;s of etern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty will work &s;uch &s;trange effects upon the ungodly, and make them wi&s;er than to be deceived &s;o ea&s;ily, as they were wont to be in time of health; what effects would it work in thee, if thou could&s;t always dwell in the views of GOD, and in lively thoughts of thine everla&s;ting &s;tate? Surely, a believer, if he improve his faith, may have truer apprehen&s;ions of the life to come, in the time of his health, than an unbeliever hath at the hour of his death.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="022331_0286_0FB7F0D5B8574378">
Thirdly, a heavenly mind is fortified again&s;t tempta|tions, becau&s;e the affections are pre-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the delights of another world. When the &s;oul is not af|fected with good, though the under&s;tanding never &s;o clearly apprehend the truth, it is ea&s;y for Satan to en|tice that &s;oul. Mere &s;peculations (be they never &s;o true) which &s;ink not into the affections, are poor pre|&s;ervatives again&s;t temptations. He that loves mo&s;t, and not he that knows mo&s;t, will ea&s;ie&s;t re&s;i&s;t the mo|tions of &s;in. There is in a chri&s;tian a kind of &s;piritu|al ta&s;te, whereby he knows the&s;e things, be&s;ides his mere rea&s;oning power: the will doth as &s;weetly reli&s;h goodne&s;s, as the under&s;tanding doth truth; and here lies much of a chri&s;tian's &s;trength. If you &s;hould di&s;|pute with a &s;imple man, and labour to per&s;uade him that &s;ugar is not &s;weet, or that wormwood is not bit|ter; perhaps you might by &s;ophi&s;try over-argue his mere rea&s;on, but yet you could not per&s;uade him again&s;t his &s;en&s;e; whereas a man that hath lo&s;t his ta&s;te, is ea|&s;ier deceived for all his rea&s;on. So it is here. When thou ha&s;t had a fre&s;h delightful ta&s;te of heaven, thou wilt not be &s;o ea&s;ily per&s;uaded from it: you cannot per&s;uade a very child to part with his apple, while the ta&s;te of its &s;weetne&s;s is yet in its mouth.</P>
<P>O that you would be per&s;uaded to be much in feed|ing on the hidden manna, and to be frequently ta&s;ting the delights of heaven! It is true, it is a great way off from our &s;en&s;e, but faith can reach as far as that. How would this rai&s;e thy re&s;olutions, and make thee laugh at the fooleries of the world, and &s;corn to be cheated with &s;uch childi&s;h toys! What if the devil had &s;et upon <HI>Paul</HI> when he was in the third heaven? Could he then have per&s;uaded his heart to the plea&s;ures, or profits, or honours of the world? Though the <HI>I&s;|raelites</HI> below may be enticed to idolatry, and from eating and drinking to ri&s;e up to play; yet <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the mount with GOD will not do &s;o: and if they had
<PB N="288" REF="022331_0287_0FB7F0D688C5F0F0">been where he was, and had but &s;een what he there &s;aw, perhaps they would not &s;o ea&s;ily have &s;inned. O if we could keep our &s;ouls continually delighted with the &s;weetne&s;s above, with what di&s;dain &s;hould we &s;pit out the baits of &s;in!</P>
<P>Fourthly, Whil&s;t the heart is &s;et on heaven, a man is under GOD's protection; and therefore if Satan then a&s;&s;ault him, GOD is more engaged for his de|fence.</P>
<P>Let me entreat thee then, if thou be a man that is haunted with temptation (as doubtle&s;s thou art, if thou be a man) if thou perceive thy danger, and would&s;t fain e&s;cape it; u&s;e much this powerful remedy, keep clo&s;e with GOD by a heavenly mind; and when the temptation comes, go &s;traight to heaven, and turn thy thoughts to higher things; thou &s;halt find this a &s;urer help than any other. Follow your bu&s;ine&s;s above with <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and keep your thoughts to their heavenly em|ployment, and you &s;ooner will this way vanqui&s;h the temptation, than if you argued or talked it out with the tempter.</P>
<P N="4">4. Con&s;ider, the diligent keeping of your hearts on heaven, will pre&s;erve the vigour of all your graces, and put life into your duties. It is the heavenly chri&s;tian, that is the lively chri&s;tian: it is our &s;trange|ne&s;s to heaven that makes us &s;o dull: it is the end that quickens all the means; and the more frequently and clearly this end is beheld, the more vigorous will all our motions be. How doth it make men unweari|edly labour, and fearle&s;sly venture, when they do but think of the gainful prize! How will the &s;oldier hazard his life, and the mariner pa&s;s through &s;torms and waves! How cheerfully do they compa&s;s &s;ea and land, when they think of an uncertain peri&s;hing trea&s;ure! O what life then would it put into a chri&s;tian's en|deavours,
<PB N="289" REF="022331_0288_0FB7F0D98E1D8298">if he would frequently think of his everla&s;t|ing trea&s;ure! We run &s;o &s;lowly, and &s;trive &s;o lazily, becau&s;e we &s;o little mind the prize. When a chri&s;tian hath been ta&s;ting the hidden manna, and drinking of the &s;treams of the paradi&s;e of GOD, what life doth this put into him! How &s;ervent will his &s;pirit be in prayer, when he con&s;iders that he prays for no le&s;s than heaven!</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve but the man who is much in heaven, and you &s;hall &s;ee he is not like others; there is &s;omewhat of that which he hath &s;een above, appeareth in all his duty and conver&s;ation: nay, take but the &s;ame man immediately when he is returned from the&s;e views of bli&s;s, and you may ea&s;ily perceive he excels him&s;elf. If he be a preacher, how heavenly are his &s;ermons! What clear de&s;criptions, what high expre&s;&s;ions hath he of that re&s;t! If he be a private chri&s;tian, what heavenly conference, what heavenly prayers, what an heavenly carriage hath he! May you not even hear in a preacher's &s;ermons, or in the private duties of another, when they have been mo&s;t above? When <HI>Mo|&s;es</HI> had been with GOD in the mount, it made his face &s;hine, that the people could not behold him. If you would but &s;et upon this employment, even &s;o it would be with you: men would &s;ee the face of your conver|&s;ation &s;hine, and &s;ay, <HI>Surely he hath been with God!</HI></P>
<P>It is true, a heavenly nature goes before this hea|venly employment; but yet the work will make it more heavenly: there mu&s;t be life, before we can feed; but our life is continued and increa&s;ed by feeding. Therefore, let me inform thee, if thou lie complain|ing of deadne&s;s and dulne&s;s, that thou can&s;t not love <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> nor rejoice in his love; that thou ha&s;t no life in prayer, nor any other duty, and yet never tried&s;t this quickening cour&s;e, or at lea&s;t art carele&s;s and incon|&s;tant in it; thou art the cau&s;e of thy own complaints;

<PB N="292" REF="022331_0291_0FB7F0ED0A4476B8">this way to heaven, and derives it daily from the pure fountain, &s;hall have his &s;oul revived with the water of life, and enjoy that quickening which is the &s;aint's peculiar: by this faith thou may&s;t offer <HI>Abel</HI>'s &s;acri|fice, more excellent than that of common men, and by it obtain witne&s;s that thou art righteous, GOD te&s;tifying of thy gifts, <HI>Heb.</HI> xi. 4. When others are ready, as <HI>Baal</HI>'s prie&s;ts, to beat them&s;elves, and cut their fle&s;h, becau&s;e their &s;acrifices will not burn: then if thou can&s;t get but the &s;pirit of <HI>Elias,</HI> and in the chariot of contemplation &s;oar aloft, till thou ap|proache&s;t near to the quickening &s;pirit, thy &s;oul and &s;acrifice will gloriou&s;ly flame, though the fle&s;h and the world &s;hould ca&s;t upon them the water of all their en|mity. Say not now, how &s;hall we get &s;o high? Or how can mortals a&s;cend to heaven? For faith hath wings, and meditation is its chariot; its office is to make ab&s;ent things as pre&s;ent. Do you not &s;ee how a little piece of gla&s;s, if it do but rightly face the &s;un, will &s;o contract its beams and heat, as to &s;et on fire that which is behind it, which without it would have received but little warmth? Why thy faith is as the burning gla&s;s to thy &s;acrifice, and meditation &s;ets it to face the &s;un; only take it not away too &s;oon, but hold it there a while, and thy &s;oul will feel the happy effect.</P>
<P>If we could get into the holy of holies, and bring thence the name and image of GOD, and get it clo&s;|ed up in our hearts, this would enable us to work wonders; every duty we performed would be a won|der; and they that heard would be ready to &s;ay, Ne|ver man &s;pake as this man &s;peaketh. The Spirit would po&s;&s;e&s;s us, as tho&s;e flaming tongues, and make us eve|ry one &s;peak (not in the variety of the confounded languages, but) in the primitive pure language of <HI>Canaan,</HI> the wonderful works of GOD. We &s;hould then be in every duty, whether prayer, exhortation,
<PB N="293" REF="022331_0292_0FB7F0EEAEF39B88">or brotherly reproof, as <HI>Paul</HI> was at <HI>Athens,</HI> his &s;pi|rit was &s;tirred within him; and &s;hould be ready to &s;ay, as <HI>Jeremiah</HI> did, <HI>Jer.</HI> xx. 9. <HI>His word was in my heart as a burning fire &s;hut up in my bones; and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not &s;tay.</HI></P>
<P>Chri&s;tian reader, art thou not thinking when thou &s;ee&s;t a lively believer, and heare&s;t his melting pray|ers, and ravi&s;hing di&s;cour&s;e; O how happy a man is this! O that my &s;oul were in his &s;tate! Why, I here direct and advi&s;e thee from GOD. Try this cour&s;e, and &s;et thy &s;oul to this work, and thou &s;halt be in as good a ca&s;e. Wa&s;h thee frequently in this <HI>Jordan,</HI> and thy dead &s;oul &s;hall revive, and thou &s;halt know there is a GOD in <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> and that thou may&s;t live a vigorous and joyous life, if thou neglect not thine own mercies. If thou truly value this &s;trong and ac|tive frame of &s;pirit, &s;hew it by thy pre&s;ent attempting this heavenly exerci&s;e. Thou ha&s;t heard the way to obtain this life in thy &s;oul, and in thy duties; if thou wilt yet neglect it blame thy&s;elf.</P>
<P>But alas, the multitude of profe&s;&s;ors come to a mini&s;ter, ju&s;t as <HI>Naaman</HI> came to <HI>Elias;</HI> they a&s;k us, how &s;hall I overcome a hard heart, and get &s;trength and life of grace? But they expect that &s;ome ea&s;y means &s;hould do it; and think we &s;hould cure them with the very an&s;wer to their que&s;tion, and teach them a way to be quickly well: but when they hear of a daily trading in heaven, and con&s;tant meditation on the joys above; this is a greater ta&s;k than they ex|pected, and they turn their backs, as <HI>Naaman</HI> to <HI>Elias,</HI> or the young man on <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Will not preaching, and praying, and conference &s;erve (&s;ay they) without this dwelling &s;till in heaven? I entreat thee, reader, be|ware of this folly; fall to the work: the comfort of &s;piritual health will countervail all the trouble. It is but the fle&s;h that repines, which thou knowe&s;t was
<PB N="294" REF="022331_0293_0FB7F0F0CE36DAE0">never a friend to thy &s;oul. If GOD had &s;et thee on &s;ome grievous work, &s;hould&s;t thou not have done it for the life of thy &s;oul? How much more when he doth but invite thee to him&s;elf?</P>

<ITEM>3. To &s;trengthen our re&s;olutions, that we for&s;ake not <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for fear of trouble.</ITEM>
</LIST>
A man will more quietly endure the lancing of his &s;ores, when he thinks on the ea&s;e that will follow. What then will not a believer en|dure, when he thinks of the re&s;t to which it tendeth? What if the way be never &s;o rough, can it be tedious if it lead to heaven? O &s;weet &s;ickne&s;s, &s;weet reproach|es, impri&s;onments, or death, which is accompanied with the&s;e ta&s;tes of our future re&s;t! Believe it, thou wilt &s;uffer heavily, thou wilt die mo&s;t &s;adly, if thou ha&s;t not at hand the foreta&s;tes of this re&s;t. Therefore as thou wilt then be ready with <HI>David</HI> to pray, <HI>Be not far from me, for trouble is near:</HI> &s;o let it be thy chief care not to be far from GOD and heaven, when trou|ble is near, and <HI>thou wilt find him a very pre&s;ent help in trouble.</HI></P>
<P>All &s;ufferings are nothing to us, &s;o far as we have the fore&s;ight of this &s;alvation. No bolts, nor bars, nor di&s;tance of place can &s;hut out the&s;e &s;upporting joys, becau&s;e they cannot confine our faith and thoughts, although they may confine our fle&s;h. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and faith are &s;piritual, and therefore pri&s;ons and ba|ni&s;hments cannot hinder their intercour&s;e. Even when per&s;ecution and fear hath &s;hut the doors, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> can come in, and &s;tand in the mid&s;t, and &s;ay, <HI>Peace be unto you.</HI> It is not the place that gives the re&s;t, but the pre&s;ence and beholding of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in it. If the Son of GOD will walk with us in it, we may walk &s;afely

What made <HI>Mo&s;es choo&s;e affliction with the people of God, rather than enjoy the plea&s;ures of &s;in for a &s;ea&s;on? He had re&s;pect to the recompen&s;e of reward.</HI> Yea, our LORD him&s;elf did fetch his encouragements to &s;ufferings from the fore|&s;ight of his glory: <HI>for to this end he both died and ro&s;e, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living, Rom.</HI> xiv. 9. <HI>Even Je&s;us, the author and fini&s;her of our faith, for the joy that was &s;et before him, endured the cro&s;s, de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;hame, and is &s;et down at the right hand of the throne of God.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Con&s;ider, It is he that hath his conver&s;ation in heaven, who is the profitable chri&s;tian to all about him: with him you may take &s;weet coun&s;el, and go up to the cele&s;tial hou&s;e of GOD. When a man is in a &s;trange country, far from home, how glad is he of the company of one of his own nation! How delight|ful is it to them to talk of their country, of their ac|quaintance, and the affairs of their home! Why, with a heavenly chri&s;tian thou may&s;t have &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e; for he hath been there in the &s;pirit, and can tell thee of the glory and re&s;t above. To di&s;cour&s;e with able men, of clear under&s;tandings, about the difficulties of religion, yea, about languages and &s;ciences, is both plea&s;ant and profitable; but nothing to this heavenly di&s;cour&s;e of a believer. O how refre&s;hing are his ex|pre&s;&s;ions! How his words pierce the heart! How they transform the hearers! <HI>How doth his doctrine drop as the rain, and his &s;peech di&s;til as the dew, as the &s;mall rain upon the tender herb, and as the &s;howers upon the gra&s;s; while his tongue is expre&s;&s;ing the name of the Lord, and a&s;cribing greatne&s;s to his God!</HI> This is the man who is as <HI>Job, when the candle of God did &s;hine upon his head, and when by his light he walked through darkne&s;s: when
<PB N="296" REF="022331_0295_0FB7F0F489B15E78">the &s;ecret of God was upon his tabernacle, and when the Almighty was yet with him: then the ear that heard him, did ble&s;s him; and the eye that &s;aw him, give witne&s;s to him,</HI> Job xxix. 3, 4, 5, 11. Happy the people that have an heavenly mini&s;ter: happy the children and &s;er|vants that have an heavenly father or ma&s;ter; happy the man that hath heavenly a&s;&s;ociates; if they have but hearts to know their happine&s;s. This is the com|panion, who will watch over thy ways, who will &s;trengthen thee when thou art weak; who will cheer thee when thou art drooping, and comfort thee with the &s;ame comforts, wherewith he hath been &s;o often comforted him&s;elf. This is he that will be blowing the &s;park of thy &s;piritual life, and always drawing thy &s;oul to GOD, and will be &s;aying to thee, as the <HI>Sama|ritan</HI> woman, <HI>Come and &s;ee one that hath told me all that ever I did,</HI> one that hath ravi&s;hed my heart with his beauty, one that hath loved our &s;ouls to the death: is not this the <HI>Chri&s;t?</HI> Is not the knowledge of GOD and him eternal life? Is it not the glory of the &s;aints to &s;ee his glory? If thou travel with this man on the way, he will be directing and quickening thee in thy journey to heaven: if thou be buying or &s;elling, or trading with him in the world, he will be coun&s;elling thee to lay out for the ine&s;timable trea&s;ure: if thou wrong him, he can pardon thee, remembering that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath not only pardoned great offences to him, but will al&s;o give him this invaluable portion. This is the chri&s;tian of the right &s;tamp; this is the &s;ervant that is like his LORD; the&s;e be the innocent that &s;ave the i&s;land, and all about them are the better where they dwell.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP.III.</HI> Containing &s;ome Hinderances of Heavenly-mindedne&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>AS thou value&s;t the comforts of a heavenly con|ver&s;ation, I here charge thee from GOD, to beware mo&s;t carefully of the&s;e impediments.</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t is, the living in a known &s;in. Ob&s;erve this. What havoc will this make in thy &s;oul! O the joys that this hath de&s;troyed! The ble&s;&s;ed communi|on with GOD, that this hath interrupted! The ruins it hath made among&s;t men's graces! The duties that it hath hindered! And above all others, it is an ene|my to this great duty.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire thee in the fear of GOD, &s;tay here a little, and &s;earch thy heart. Art thou one that hath u&s;ed violence with thy con&s;cience? Art thou a wilful ne|glecter of known duties, either public or private? Art thou a &s;lave to thine appetite, in eating or drink|ing, or to any other commanding &s;en&s;e? Art thou a &s;eeker of thine own e&s;teem, and a man that mu&s;t needs have men's good opinion? Art thou a peevi&s;h or pa&s;&s;ionate per&s;on, ready to take fire at every word, or every &s;uppo&s;ed &s;light? Art thou a deceiver of others in thy dealing; or one that hath &s;et thy&s;elf to ri&s;e in the world? Not to &s;peak of greater &s;ins, which all take notice of. If this be thy ca&s;e, I dare &s;ay, heaven and thy &s;oul are very great &s;trangers; I dare &s;ay, thou art &s;eldom with GOD, and there is little hope it &s;hould be better, as long as thou continue&s;t in the&s;e tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions: the&s;e beams in thine eyes will not &s;uffer thee to look to heaven; the&s;e will be a cloud between thee and GOD. How &s;hould&s;t thou take
<PB N="298" REF="022331_0297_0FB7F1018898FD20">comfort from heaven, who taketh &s;o much plea&s;ure in the lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h? Every wilful &s;in will be to thy comforts as water to fire; when thou thinke&s;t to quicken them, this will quench them; when thy heart begins to draw near to GOD, this will pre&s;ent|ly fill thee with doubting. Be&s;ides it doth utterly in|di&s;po&s;e thee, and di&s;able thee to this work; when thou &s;hould&s;t wind up thy heart to heaven, it is bia&s;|&s;ed another way; it is entangled, and can no more a&s;cend in divine meditation, than the bird can fly who&s;e wings are clipt, or that is taken in the &s;nare. Sin doth cut the very &s;inews of the &s;oul; therefore I &s;ay of this heavenly life, as Mr. <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lton</HI> &s;aith of pray|er, <Q>Either it will make thee leave &s;inning, or &s;in will make thee leave it,</Q> and that quickly too: for the&s;e cannot continue together. If heaven and hell can meet together, then may&s;t thou live in thy &s;in, and in the ta&s;tes of glory. If therefore thou find thy&s;elf guilty, never doubt but this is the cau&s;e that e&s;trangeth thee from heaven; and take heed le&s;t it keep out thee, as it keeps out thy heart. Yea, if thou be a man that hitherto ha&s;t e&s;caped, and know|e&s;t no reigning &s;in in thy &s;oul, yet let this warning move thee to prevention, and &s;tir up a dread of this danger in thy &s;pirit, e&s;pecially re&s;olve to keep from the occa&s;ions of &s;in, and, as much as po&s;&s;ible, out of the way of temptations.</P>
<P N="2">2. A &s;econd hinderance carefully to be avoided, is, an earthly mind: for you may ea&s;ily conceive, that this cannot &s;tand with an heavenly mind. GOD and mammon, earth and heaven. cannot both have the delight of thy heart. This makes thee like <HI>An&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lm</HI>'s bird, with a &s;tone tied to the foot, which as oft as &s;he took flight, did pluck her to the earth again. If thou be a man that ha&s;t fancied to thy&s;elf, &s;ome hap|pine&s;s t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e found on earth, and beginne&s;t to ta&s;te a &s;weetne&s;s in gain, and to a&s;pire after an higher e&s;tate,
<PB N="299" REF="022331_0298_0FB7F1072021B158">and art driving on thy de&s;ign; believe it, thou art marching with thy back upon <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and art po&s;ting apace from this heavenly life. Hath not the world that from thee, which GOD hath from the believer? When he is ble&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in GOD, and rejoicing in hope of the glory to come; then thou art ble&s;&s;ing thy&s;elf in thy pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>It may be thou holde&s;t on thy cour&s;e of duty, and praye&s;t as oft as thou did&s;t before; it may be thou keepe&s;t in with good mini&s;ters, and with good men, and &s;eeme&s;t as forward in religion as ever: but what is all this to the purpo&s;e? Mock not thy &s;oul, man; for GOD will not be mocked. Thine earthly mind may con&s;i&s;t with thy common duties; but it cannot con&s;i&s;t with this heavenly duty. I need not tell thee this, if thou would&s;t not be a traitor to thy own &s;oul: thou knowe&s;t thy&s;elf how &s;eldom and cold, how cur&s;ory and &s;trange thy thoughts have been of the joys hereafter, ever &s;ince thou did&s;t trade &s;o eager|ly for the world.</P>
<P>Methinks I even perceive thy con&s;cience &s;tir now, and tell thee plainly, that this is thy ca&s;e: hear it, man! O hear it now; le&s;t thou hear it in another manner when thou would&s;t be full loth. O the cur&s;ed madne&s;s of many that &s;eem to be religious! who thru&s;t them&s;elves into the multitude of employments, and think they can never have bu&s;ine&s;s enough, till they are &s;o loaded with labours, and clogged with cares, that their &s;ouls are as unfit to con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er&s;e with GOD, as a man to walk with a mountain on his back. And when all is done, and they have lo&s;t that heaven they might have had upon earth, they take up a few rotten arguments to prove it lawful, and then they think that they have &s;alved all. They mi&s;s not the plea&s;ures of this heavenly life, if they can but quiet
<PB N="300" REF="022331_0299_0FB7EDB94B507818">their con&s;ciences, while they fa&s;ten upon lower and ba&s;er plea&s;ures:</P>
<P>For thee, O chri&s;tian! who ha&s;t ta&s;ted of the&s;e plea&s;ures, I advi&s;e thee, as thou value&s;t their enjoy|ment, as ever thou would&s;t ta&s;te of them any more, take heed of this gulph of an earthly mind: For if once thou come&s;t to this, <HI>that thou wilt be rich, thou falle&s;t into temptation, and a &s;nare, and into divers fool|i&s;h and hurtful lu&s;ts.</HI> Keep the&s;e things as thy upper garments &s;till loo&s;e about thee, that thou may&s;t lay them by whenever there is cau&s;e: but let GOD and glory be next thy heart, yea, as the very blood and &s;pirit by which thou live&s;t: &s;till remember that of the Spirit, <HI>The friend&s;hip of the world is enmity with God: who&s;oever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God.</HI> And, <HI>love not the world, nor the things in the world: if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</HI> This is plain dealing; and happy he that faithfully receives it.</P>
<P N="3">3. A third hinderance which I mu&s;t advi&s;e thee to beware, is, the company of ungodly and &s;en&s;ual men. Not that I would di&s;&s;uade thee from nece&s;&s;ary conver&s;e, or from doing them any office of love: nor would I have thee conclude them to be dogs and &s;wine, that &s;o thou maye&s;t evade the duty of reproof; nor yet to judge them &s;uch at all, before thou art certain they are &s;uch indeed.</P>
<P>But it is the unnece&s;&s;ary &s;ociety of ungodly men, and familiarity with unprofitable companions, though they be not &s;o apparently ungodly, that I di&s;&s;uade you from. It is not only the open profane, the &s;wearer, the drunkard, that will prove hurtful to us; but dead-hearted formali&s;ts, or per&s;ons merely civil and moral, or who&s;e conference is empty, un&s;avoury, and barren, may much divert our thought from heaven.
<PB N="301" REF="022331_0300_0FB7EDBBE88F2208">As mere idlene&s;s, and forgetting GOD, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eep a &s;oul as certainly from heaven, as a profane, li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tious, fle&s;hly life: &s;o al&s;o will u&s;ele&s;s company a &s;urely keep our hearts from heaven, as the company of men more di&s;&s;olute and profane. Alas! our dulne&s;s and backwardne&s;s is &s;uch, that we have need of the mo&s;t con&s;tant and powerful helps: a clod, or a &s;tone that lies on the earth, is as prone to ari&s;e and fly in the air, as our hearts are to move towards heaven. You need not hold them from flying up to the &s;kies; it is &s;ufficient that you do not help them. If our &s;pirits have not great a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they may ea&s;ily be kept from flying aloft, though they never &s;hould meet with the lea&s;t impediment. O think of this in the choice of your company: when your &s;pirits need no help to lift them up, but as the flames, you are al|ways mounting upward, and carrying with you all that is in your way, then you may indeed be le&s;s careful of your company; but till then be careful therein. As it is reported of a lord that was near his death, and the doctor that prayed with him read over the litany, <HI>For all wom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n labouring with child, for all &s;ick per&s;ons, and young children,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>From lightning and tempe&s;t; from plague, pe&s;tilence, and famine; from battle and murder, and from &s;udden death.</HI> Alas! &s;aith he, what is this to me, who mu&s;t pre&s;ently die? So may&s;t thou &s;ay of &s;uch men's conference; alas! what is this to me, who mu&s;t &s;hortly be in re&s;t? What will it advantage thee to a life with GOD, to hear where the fair is &s;uch a day, or how the market goes, or what weather it is, or is like to be, or when the moon changed, or what news is &s;tirring? What will it conduce to the rai&s;ing thy heart Godward, to hear that this is an able mini&s;ter, or that an able chri&s;tian, or that this was an excellent &s;ermon, or that is an excellent book; to hear a di&s;cour&s;e of bapti&s;ms, ce|remonies, the order of GOD'S decrees, or other &s;uch controver&s;ies of great difficulty, and le&s;s importance?
<PB N="302" REF="022331_0301_0FB7EDC36A319AF0">Yet this, for the mo&s;t part, is the &s;weete&s;t di&s;cour&s;e that you are likely to have of a formal dead-hearted profe&s;&s;or. If thou had&s;t newly been warming thy heart with the joys above, would not this di&s;cour&s;e quickly freeze it again? I appeal to the judgment of any man that hath tried it, and maketh ob&s;ervations on the frame of his &s;pirit.</P>
<P N="4">4. A fourth hinderance to heavenly conver&s;ation, is, di&s;putes about le&s;&s;er truths, and e&s;pecially when a man's religion lies only in his opinions; a &s;ure &s;ign of an un&s;anctified &s;oul. If &s;ad examples be regarded, I need &s;ay the le&s;s upon this. It is legibly written in the faces of thou&s;ands; it is vi&s;ible in the com|plexion of our decea&s;ed nation. They are men lea&s;t acquainted with a heavenly life, who are the violent di&s;puters about the circum&s;tantials of religion: he who&s;e religion is all in his opinions, will be mo&s;t frequently and zealou&s;ly &s;peaking his opinions: and he who&s;e religion lies in the knowledge and love of GOD in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> of that time when he &s;hall enjoy GOD and <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> As the body doth langui&s;h in con|&s;uming fevers, when the native heat abates within, and an unnatural heat inflaming the external parts &s;ucceeds; &s;o when the zeal of a chri&s;tian doth leave the internals of religion, and fly to externals, or in|ferior things, the &s;oul mu&s;t need con&s;ume and lan|gui&s;h. Yea, though you were &s;ure your opinions were true, yet when the chief of your zeal is turned thither, and the chief of your conference there laid out, the life of grace decays within.</P>
<P>Therefore let me advi&s;e you that a&s;pire after this joyous life, &s;pend not your thoughts, your time, your zeal, or your &s;peeches upon quarrels that le&s;s concern your &s;ouls: but when others are feeding on hu&s;ks or &s;hells, or on this heated food which will burn their lips, far &s;ooner than warm and &s;trengthen their hearts;
<PB N="303" REF="022331_0302_0FB7EDC70A65F8D8">then do you feed on the joys above. I could wi&s;h you were all under&s;tanding men, able to defend every truth of GOD; but &s;till I would have the chief to be chiefly &s;tudied, and none to &s;houlder out your thoughts of eternity: the lea&s;t controverted points are u&s;ually mo&s;t weighty, and of mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e to our &s;ouls.</P>
<P N="5">5. As you value the comforts or a heavenly life, take heed of a proud and lofty &s;pirit. There is &s;uch an antipathy between this &s;in and GOD, that thou wilt never get thy heart near him, as long as this prevail|eth in it. If it ca&s;t the angels from heaven that were in it, it mu&s;t needs keep thy heart e&s;tranged from it. If it ca&s;t our fir&s;t parents out of paradi&s;e, and &s;eparat|ed between the LORD and us, it mu&s;t needs keep our hearts from paradi&s;e, and increa&s;e the cur&s;ed &s;eparation from our GOD. The delight of GOD is an humble &s;oul, even him that is contrite, and trembleth at his word: and the delight of an humble &s;oul is in GOD: and &s;ure where there is mutual delight, there will be free&s;t admittance, and heartie&s;t welcome, and mo&s;t frequent conver&s;e. Well then, art thou a man of worth in thine own eyes? And very tender of thine e&s;teem with others? Art thou one that much value&s;t applau&s;e and feele&s;t delight when thou heare&s;t of thy great e&s;teem with men; and art dejected when thou heare&s;t that men &s;light thee? Do&s;t thou love tho&s;e mo&s;t who be&s;t honour thee; and doth thy heart bear a grudge at tho&s;e that thou thinke&s;t undervalue thee? Wilt thou not be brought to &s;hame thy&s;elf, by hum|ble confe&s;&s;ion when thou ha&s;t &s;inned again&s;t GOD, or injured thy brother? Art thou one that honoure&s;t the rich? and thinke&s;t thy&s;elf &s;omebody if they value and own thee? but looke&s;t &s;trangely at the poor, and art almo&s;t a&s;hamed to be their companion? Art thou unacquainted with the deceitfulne&s;s and wickedne&s;s of thy heart? Or knowe&s;t thy&s;elf to be vile only by reading, not by feeling thy vilene&s;s? Art thou readi|er
<PB N="304" REF="022331_0303_0FB7EDC850A8F808">to defend thy&s;elf and maintain thine innocency, than to accu&s;e thy&s;elf, or confe&s;s thy fault? Can&s;t thou hardly hear a clo&s;e reproof, or plain-dealing without difficulty and di&s;ta&s;te? Art thou readier in thy di&s;|cour&s;e to teach than to learn; and to dictate to others, than to hearken to their in&s;tructions? Art thou bold and confident of thy own opinions, and little &s;u&s;pi|cious of the weakne&s;s of thy under&s;tanding? but a &s;lighter of the judgment of all that are again&s;t thee? Is thy &s;pirit more di&s;po&s;ed to command than to obey? Art thou ready to cen&s;ure the doctrine of thy teachers, the actions of thy rulers, and the per&s;ons of thy bre|thren? And to think, if thou wert a judge, thou would&s;t be more ju&s;t; or if thou wert a mini&s;ter, thou would&s;t be more fruitful and more faithful? If the&s;e &s;ymptoms be in thy heart, beyond doubt thou art a proud per&s;on. Thou art abominably proud; there is too much of hell abiding in thee, for thee to have any acquaintance at heaven: thy &s;ould is too like the de|vil, to have any familiarity with GOD.</P>
<P>I entreat you be very jealous of your &s;ouls in this point: there is nothing will more e&s;trange you from GOD: I &s;peak the more of it, becau&s;e it is the mo&s;t common and dangerous &s;in, and mo&s;t promoting the great &s;in of infidelity: you would little think what humble carriage, what exclaiming again&s;t pride, what &s;elf-accu&s;ing may &s;tand with this devili&s;h &s;in of pride. O chri&s;tian, if thou would&s;t live continually in the pre&s;ence of thy LORD, and lie in the du&s;t, he would thence take thee up; de&s;cend fir&s;t with him into the grave, and thence thou may&s;t a&s;cend with him to glo|ry. Learn of him to be meek and lowly, and then thou may&s;t ta&s;te of this re&s;t to thy &s;oul.

6. Another impediment to this heavenly life is, lazi|ne&s;s, and &s;lothfulne&s;s of &s;pirit: and I verily think for knowing men, there is nothing hinders more than this. If it were only the exerci&s;e of the body, the moving of the lips, the bending of the knee; then men would as commoly &s;tep to heaven, as they go a few miles to vi&s;it a friend; yea, if it were to &s;pend our days in numbering beads, and repeating certain words and prayers, or in the outward parts of duties commanded by GOD, yet it were comparatively ea&s;y: further, if it were only in the exerci&s;e of parts and gifts, it were ea&s;ier to be heavenly-minded. But it is a work more difficult than all this: to &s;eparate our thoughts and af|fections from the world; to draw forth all our graces in their order, and exerci&s;e each on its proper object, to hold them to this, till the work doth thrive and pro&s;per in their hands; this is the difficult ta&s;k. Heaven is above thee, the way is upwards; do&s;t thou think, who art a feeble &s;inner, to travel daily this &s;teep a&s;cent without a great deal of labour and re&s;olution? Can&s;t thou get that earthly heart to heaven, and bring that backward mind to GOD, while thou lie&s;t &s;till, and take&s;t thine ea&s;e? If lying down at the foot of the hill, and looking toward the top, and wi&s;hing we were there, would &s;erve the turn, then we &s;hould have dai|ly travellers for heaven. But the <HI>kingdom of heaven &s;uffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</HI> There mu&s;t be violence u&s;ed to get the fir&s;t-fruits, as well as to get the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Do&s;t thou not feel it &s;o, though I &s;hould not tell thee? Will thy heart get up|wards except thou drive it? Do&s;t thou find it ea&s;y to dwell in the delights above? It is true, the work is &s;weet, and no condition on earth &s;o de&s;irable; but therefore it is that our hearts are &s;o backward, e&s;pe|cially in the beginning, till we are acquainted with it. O how many who can ea&s;ily bring their hearts to ordinary duties, as reading, hearing, praying, con|ferring, could never yet in all their lives, bring them,
<PB N="306" REF="022331_0305_0FB7EDCD1CFBC8D8">and keep them to an heavenly contemplation one half hour together! Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, here, reader, as before the LORD, whether this be not thine own ca&s;e. Thou ha&s;t known that heaven is all thy hopes; thou knowe&s;t thou mu&s;t &s;hortly be turned hence, and that nothing below can yield thee re&s;t; thou knowe&s;t al&s;o that a &s;trange heart, a &s;eldom and carele&s;s thinking of heaven, can fetch but little comfort thence: and do&s;t thou yet for all this let &s;lip thy opportunities, when thou &s;hould&s;t walk above, and live with GOD? Do&s;t thou commend the &s;weetne&s;s of an heavenly life, and yet did&s;t never once try it thy&s;elf? But as the &s;luggard that &s;tretched him&s;elf on his bed, and cried, O that this were working! So do&s;t thou live at thy ca&s;e, and &s;ay, O that I could get my heart to heaven! How many read books, and hear &s;ermons, in expectation to hear of &s;ome ea&s;y cour&s;e, or to meet with a &s;horter cut to comforts, than ever they are like to find? And if they can hear of none from the preachers of truth, they will &s;natch it with rejoicing from the teachers of fal&s;ehood; and pre&s;ently applaud the excellency of the doctrine, becau&s;e it hath fitted their lazy temper; and think there is no other doctrine will comfort the &s;oul, becau&s;e it will not comfort it with hearing and look|ing on. And while they pretend enmity only to the law, they oppo&s;e the ea&s;ier conditions of the go&s;pel, and ca&s;t off the burden which all mu&s;t bear that find re&s;t to their &s;ouls: the LORD of light and &s;pirit of comfort, &s;hew the&s;e men in time, a &s;urer way for la&s;t|ing comfort. It was an e&s;tabli&s;hed law among the <HI>Ar|gi,</HI> That if a man were perceived to be idle and lazy, he mu&s;t give an account before the magi&s;t rate, how he came by his victuals and maintenance: and &s;ure, when I &s;ee the&s;e men lazy in the u&s;e of GOD'S appoint|ed means for comfort, I cannot but que&s;tion how they come by their comforts: I would they would ex|amine it throughly them&s;elves; for GOD will re|quire an account of it from them. Idlene&s;s, and not
<PB N="307" REF="022331_0306_0FB7EDCE52B8BD68">improving the truth in painful duty, is the com|mon cau&s;e of men's &s;eeking comfort from error: even as the people of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> when they had no comfortable an&s;wer from GOD, becau&s;e of their own &s;in and ne|glect, would run to &s;eek it from the idols of the hea|thens: &s;o when men are fal&s;e-hearted, and the Spirit of truth denies them comfort, becau&s;e they deny him obedience, they will &s;eek it from a lying &s;pirit.</P>
<P>My advice to &s;uch a lazy &s;inner, is this: as thou art convicted that this work is nece&s;&s;ary to thy comfort, &s;o re&s;olvedly &s;et upon it: if thy heart draw back, and be undi&s;po&s;ed, force it on with the command of rea|&s;on; and if thy rea&s;on begin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o di&s;pute the work, force it with producing the command of GOD; and quicken it with the con&s;ideration of thy nece&s;&s;ity, and the other motives before propounded: and let the inforcements that brought thee to the work, be &s;till in thy mind to quicken thee in it. Do not let &s;uch an incomparable trea&s;ure lie before thee, while thou lie&s;t &s;till with thy hand in thy bo&s;om: let not thy life be a continual vex|ation, which might be a continual fea&s;t, and all be|cau&s;e thou wilt not be at the pains. When thou ha&s;t once ta&s;ted the &s;weetne&s;s of it, and a little u&s;ed thy heart to the work, thou wilt find the pains thou take&s;t abundantly recompen&s;ed. Only &s;it not &s;till with a di&s;|con&s;olate &s;pirit, while comforts grow before thine eyes. Neither is it a few formal, lazy, running thoughts, that will fetch thee this con&s;olation from above: no more than a few lazy formal words will prevail with GOD in&s;tead of fervent prayer. I know <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is the fountain, and I know this, as every other gift, is of GOD: but yet if thou a&s;k my advice, how to obtain the&s;e waters of con&s;olation; I mu&s;t tell thee, there is &s;omething al&s;o for thee to do: the go&s;pel hath its con|ditions, and works, though not &s;uch impo&s;&s;ible ones, as the law; <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath his yoke and his burden, though ea&s;y, and thou mu&s;t take it up, or thou wilt never
<PB N="308" REF="022331_0307_0FB7EDD4B9CA9228">find re&s;t to thy &s;oul. I know &s;o far as you are &s;pi|ritual, you need not all this &s;triving and violence, but that is but in part, and in part you are carnal; and as long as it is &s;o, there is no talk of ea&s;e. It was the <HI>Parthians</HI> cu&s;tom, that none mu&s;t give their children any meat in the morning, before they &s;aw the &s;weat on their faces; and you &s;hall find this to be GOD'S mo&s;t u&s;ual cour&s;e, not to give his children the ta&s;te of his delights, till they begin to &s;weat in &s;eeking af|ter them. Therefore lay them both together, and judge whether an heavenly life, or thy ca&s;e be bet|ter; and make the choice accordingly. Yet this let me &s;ay, thou neede&s;t not expend thy thoughts more than now thou do&s;t; it is but only to employ them better: I pre&s;s thee not to bu&s;y thy mind much more than thou do&s;t; but to bu&s;y it upon better and more plea&s;ant objects. Employ but &s;o many &s;erious thoughts every day, upon the excellent glory of the life to come, as thou now employe&s;t on the affairs in the world: nay, as thou daily lo&s;e&s;t on vanities, and thy heart will be at heaven in a &s;hort &s;pace.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is al&s;o a dangerous hinderance, to content our&s;elves with the mere preparatives to this heavenly life, while we are &s;trangers to the life it&s;elf: when we take up with the mere &s;tudies of heavenly things, and the notions and thoughts of them in our brain, or the talking of them with one another, as if this were all that makes us heavenly people. There is none in more danger of this &s;nare, than tho&s;e that are much in public duty, e&s;pecially preachers of the go&s;|pel. O how ea&s;ily may they be deceived here, while they do nothing more than read of heaven, and &s;tudy of heaven, and preach of heaven, and pray, and talk that GOD would reveal to our hearts the danger of this &s;nare! Alas, all this is but mere preparation: this is not the life we &s;peak of, though it is a help
<PB N="309" REF="022331_0308_0FB7EDD80CEADAB0">thereto. I entreat every one of my brethren in the mini&s;try, that they &s;earch and watch again&s;t this temp|tation: this is but gathering the materials, and not the erecting the building: this is but gathering man|na for others, not eating and dige&s;ting our&s;elves; as he that &s;its at home may &s;tudy geography, and draw mo&s;t exact de&s;criptions of countries, and yet never &s;ee them, nor travel toward them: &s;o may you de|&s;cribe to others the joys of heaven, and yet never come near it in your own hearts: if you &s;hould &s;tudy of nothing but heaven while you lived, and preach of nothing but heaven to your people, yet might your own hearts be &s;trangers to it: we are under a more &s;ubtle temptation than other men, to draw us from this heavenly life: if our employments lay at a great|er di&s;tance from heaven, we &s;hould not he &s;o apt to be thus deluded: but when we find our&s;elves employ|ed upon nothing el&s;e, we are ea&s;ier drawn to take up here. Studying and preaching of heaven is liker to an heavenly life, than thinking and talking of the world is, and the likene&s;s it is that may deceive us: this is to die the mo&s;t mi&s;erable death, even to fami&s;h our&s;elves, becau&s;e we have bread on our tables, and to die for thir&s;t while we draw water for others: thinking it enough that we have daily to do with it, though we never drink it.</P>

<P>HAVING thus &s;hewed thee what hinderances will re&s;i&s;t thee in the work. I &s;hall now lay down &s;ome po&s;itive helps. But fir&s;t, I expect that thou re|&s;olve again&s;t the fore-mentioned impediments, that
<PB N="310" REF="022331_0309_0FB7EDE73354EE20">thou read them &s;eriou&s;ly, and avoid them faithfully, or el&s;e thy labour will be all in vain; thou do&s;t but go about to reconcile light and darkne&s;s, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and <HI>Belial,</HI> heaven and hell in thy &s;pirit; I mu&s;t tell thee al&s;o, that I expect thy promi&s;e, faithfully to &s;et upon the helps which I pre&s;cribe thee; and that the read|ing of them will not bring heaven into thy heart, but in their con&s;tant practice the Spirit will do it.</P>
<P>As thou value&s;t then the&s;e fore-ta&s;tes of heaven, make con&s;cience of performing the&s;e following duties.</P>
<P N="1">1. Know heaven to be the only trea&s;ure, and la|bour to know what a trea&s;ure it is; be convinced that thou ha&s;t no other happine&s;s, and be convinced what happine&s;s is there: if thou do&s;t not &s;oundly be|lieve it to be the chief good, thou wilt never &s;et thy heart upon it; and this conviction mu&s;t fink into thy affections: for if it be only a notion, it will have lit|tle operation.</P>
<P N="2">2. Labour as to know heaven to be the only hap|pine&s;s, &s;o al&s;o to be thy happine&s;s. Though the knowledge of excellency and &s;uitablene&s;s may &s;tir up that love which worketh by de&s;ire, yet there mu&s;t be the knowledge of our intere&s;t or propriety, to the &s;etting at work our love of complacency. We may confe&s;s heaven to be the be&s;t condition, though we de&s;pair of enjoying it; and we may de&s;ire and &s;eek it, if we &s;ee the obtainment to be but probable; but we can never delightfully rejoice in it, till we are per&s;uaded of our title to it. What comfort is it to a man that is naked, to &s;ee the rich attire of others? Or, to a man that hath not a bit to put in his mouth, to &s;ee a fea&s;t which he mu&s;t not ta&s;te of? What de|light hath a man that hath not a hou&s;e to put his head in, to &s;ee the &s;umptuous buildings of others? Would not all this rather increa&s;e his angui&s;h, and make him
<PB N="311" REF="022331_0310_0FB7EDEA201B3918">more &s;en&s;ible of his mi&s;ery? So, for a man to know the excellencies of heaven, and not to know whether he &s;hall ever enjoy them, may well rai&s;e de&s;ire to &s;eek it, but it will rai&s;e but little joy and content.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another help to the fore-ta&s;te of re&s;t is this: la|bour to apprehend how near it is; think &s;eriou&s;ly of its &s;peedy approach. That which we think is near at hand, we are more &s;en&s;ible of than that which we behold a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a di&s;tance. When we hear of war or famine in another country, it troubleth us not &s;o much; or if we hear it prophe&s;ied of a long time hence, &s;o if we hear of plenty a great way off, or of a golden age that &s;hall fall out, who knows when, this never re|joiceth us. But if judgments or mercies draw near, then they affect us. This makes men think on hea|ven &s;o in&s;en&s;ibly, becau&s;e they conceit it at a great di&s;tance: they look on it as twenty, or thirty, or forty years off; and this it is that dulls their &s;en&s;e. As wicked men are fearle&s;s and &s;en&s;ele&s;s of judgment, becau&s;e the &s;entence is not &s;peedily executed; &s;o are the good deceived of their comforts, by &s;uppo&s;ing them further off than they are. How much better were it to receive the &s;entence of death in our&s;elves, and to look on eternity as near at hand? Surely, reader, thou &s;tande&s;t at the door, and hundreds of di&s;|ea&s;es are ready waiting to open the door and let thee in. Are not the thirty or forty years of thy life that are pa&s;t, quickly gone? Are they not a very little time when thou looke&s;t back on them? And will not all the re&s;t be &s;hortly &s;o too? Do not days and nights come very thick? Do&s;t thou not feel that building of fle&s;h to &s;hake, and perceive thy hou&s;e of clay to tot|ter? Look on thy gla&s;s, &s;ee how it runs: look on thy watch, how fa&s;t it getteth; what a &s;hort moment is between us and our re&s;t; what a &s;tep is it from hence to everla&s;tingne&s;s! While I am thinking and writing of it, it ha&s;teth near, and I am even entering into it
<PB N="312" REF="022331_0311_0FB7EDEBA7BB7A70">before I am aware. While thou art reading this, it po&s;teth on, and thy life will be gone as a tale that is told. May&s;t thou not ea&s;ily fore&s;ee thy dying time, and look upon thy&s;elf as ready to depart? It is but a few days till thy friends &s;hall lay thee in the grave, and others do the like for them. If you verily be|lieved you &s;hould die to-morrow, how &s;eriou&s;ly would you think of heaven to-night! The true apprehen&s;i|ons of the nearne&s;s of eternity, doth make men's thoughts of it quick and piercing; put life into their fears and &s;orrows, if they be unfit: and into their de&s;ires and joys, if they have a&s;&s;urance of its glory.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another help to this is, to be much in &s;erious di&s;cour&s;ing of it, e&s;pecially with tho&s;e that can &s;peak from their hearts. It is pity (&s;aith Mr. <HI>Bolton</HI>) that chri&s;tians &s;hould ever meet together, without &s;ome talk of their meeting in heaven: it is pity &s;o much precious time is &s;pent in vain di&s;cour&s;es and u&s;ele&s;s di&s;putes, and not a &s;ober word of heaven. Methinks we &s;hould meet together on purpo&s;e to warm our &s;pirits with di&s;cour&s;ing of our re&s;t. To hear a mi|ni&s;ter or private chri&s;tian &s;et forth that glorious &s;tate, with power and life from the promi&s;es of the go&s;pel, methinks &s;hould make us &s;ay, as the two di&s;ciples, <HI>Did not our hearts burn within us, while he was opening to us the &s;cripture?</HI> While he was opening to us the windows of heaven? Get then together fellow-chri&s;ti|ans, and talk of the affairs of your country and king|dom, and comfort one another with &s;uch words. This may make our hearts revive within us, as it did <HI>Jacob</HI>'s to hear the me&s;&s;age that called him to <HI>Ca&s;hen,</HI> and to &s;ee the chariots that &s;hould bring him to <HI>Jo&s;eph.</HI> O that we were furni&s;hed with &s;kill and re&s;olution to turn the &s;tream of men's common di&s;cour&s;e to the&s;e more &s;ub|lime and precious things! And when men begin to talk of things unprofitable, that we could tell how to put in a word for heaven.</P>

5. Another help is this, make it thy bu&s;ine&s;s in every duty, to wind up thy affections nearer heaven. A man's attainments from GOD are an&s;werable to his own de&s;ires and ends: that which he &s;incerely &s;eeks he finds; GOD'S end in the in&s;titution of his ordinan|ces was, that they be as &s;o many &s;tepping-&s;tones to our re&s;t, and as the &s;tairs by which (in &s;ubordination to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>) we may daily a&s;cend unto it in our affecti|ons: let this be thy end in u&s;ing them, as it was GOD'S end in ordaining them; and doubtle&s;s they will not be un&s;ucce&s;sful. Men that are &s;eparated by &s;ea and land, can yet by letters carry on great trades, even to the value of their whole e&s;tate: and may not a chri&s;tian in the wi&s;e improvement of duties, drive on this happy trade for re&s;t? Come not therefore with any lower ands to duties: renounce formality, cu&s;|tomarine&s;s and applau&s;e.

<P N="6">6. Another help is this: make an advantage of every object thou &s;ee&s;t, and of every pa&s;&s;age of Divine Providence, and of every thing that befa's in thy labour and calling, to mind thy &s;oul of its approach|ing re&s;t. As all providences an creatures are means to our re&s;t, &s;o do they point us to that as their end. Every creature hath the name of GOD and of our final re&s;t written upon it, which a con&s;iderate believer may as truly di&s;cern, as he can read upon a hand in a cro&s;s|way the name of the town or city it points to. This &s;piritual u&s;e of creatures and providences is GOD'S great end in be&s;towing them on man; and he that over|looks this end, mu&s;t needs rob GOD of his chief prai&s;e, and deny him the greate&s;t part of his thanks. This relation that our pre&s;ent mercies have to our great eternal mercies, is the very quinte&s;&s;ence and &s;pirit of all the&s;e mercies; therefore do they lo&s;e the very &s;pi|rit of all their mercies, and take nothing but the hu&s;ks, who overlook this relation, and draw not forth the &s;weetne&s;s of it in their contemplations. GOD's &s;weet|e&s;t dealings with us would not be half &s;o &s;weet as they are, if they did not intimate &s;ome further &s;weetne&s;s. As our&s;elves have a fle&s;hly and &s;piritual u&s;e, and are fitted to the nouri&s;hing of both our parts. He that receives the carnal part and no more, may have his body comforted by them, but not his &s;oul. O there|fore that chri&s;tians were &s;killed in this art! You can open your bibles, and read there of GOD and of glory: O learn to open the creatures, and the &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of Providence, to read of GOD and glory there. Cer|tainly

<P>If thou pro&s;per in the world, let it make thee more &s;en&s;ible of thy perpetual pro&s;perity: if thou be weary of thy labours, let it make thy thoughts of re&s;t more &s;weet: if things go cro&s;s with thee, let it make thee more carne&s;tly de&s;ire that day, when all thy &s;ufferings and &s;orrows &s;hall cea&s;e.

<P N="7">7. Another &s;ingular help is this: be much in that angelical work of prai&s;e. As the mo&s;t heavenly &s;pi|rits will have the mo&s;t heavenly employment, &s;o the more heavenly the employment, the more will it make the &s;pirit heavenly: though the heart be the fountain of all our actions, yet do tho&s;e actions, by a kind of reflection, work much on the heart from whence they &s;pring: the like al&s;o may be &s;aid of our &s;peeches. So
<PB N="316" REF="022331_0315_0FB7EDF68B4200F8">that the work of prai&s;ing GOD, being the mo&s;t heaven|ly work, is likely to rai&s;e us to the mo&s;t heavenly temper. This is the work of tho&s;e &s;aints and angels, and this will be our own everla&s;ting work: if we were more taken up in this employment now, we &s;hould be liker to what we &s;hall be then.

The livelie&s;t emblem of heaven that I know upon earth is, when the people of GOD in the deep &s;en&s;e of his excellency and bounty, from hearts abounding with love and joy, join together both in heart and voice, in the cheerful and melodious &s;inging of his prai&s;es. Tho&s;e that de|ny the u&s;e of &s;inging, di&s;clo&s;e their unheavenly unex|perienced hearts, as well as their ignorant under&s;tand|ings.

<P>Little do we know how we wrong our&s;elves, by &s;hutting out of our prayers the prai&s;es of GOD, or allowing them &s;o narrow a room as we u&s;ually do. Reader, I entreat thee, remember this: let prai&s;es have a larger room in thy duties: keep ready at hand matter to feed thy prai&s;e, as well as matter for con|fe&s;&s;ion and petition. To this end &s;tudy the excellen|cies and goodne&s;s of the LORD, as frequently as thy own nece&s;&s;ities and vilene&s;s; &s;tudy the mercies which thou ha&s;t received, and which are pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ed; both their own worth and their aggravating circum&s;tances, as often as thou &s;tudie&s;t the &s;ins thou ha&s;t committed.

<P>I confe&s;s, to a man of a langui&s;hing body, where the heart faints, and the &s;pirits are feeble, the cheer|ful prai&s;ing of GOD is more difficult; becau&s;e the bo|dy is the &s;oul's in&s;trument, and when it lies un&s;tring|ed, or untuned, the mu&s;ic is likely to be according|ly. Yet a &s;piritual cheerfulne&s;s there may be with|in, and the heart may prai&s;e, if not the voice. But where the body is &s;trong, the &s;pirits lively, and the heart cheerful, and the voice at command, what ad|vantage have &s;uch for this heavenly work? With what alacrity may they &s;ing forth prai&s;es? O the madne&s;s of healthful youth that lay out this vigour of body and mind upon vain delights, which is &s;o &s;it for the noble&s;t work of men! And O the &s;inful folly of ma|ny who drench their &s;pirits in continual &s;adne&s;s, and

<P N="8">8.

O then grieve not thy guide, quench not thy life: if thou do&s;t, no wonder if thy &s;oul be at a lo&s;s; you little think how much the life of all your graces depends upon your ready and cor|dial obedience to the Spirit: when the Spirit urgeth thee to &s;ecret prayer, and thou refu&s;e&s;t obedience; when he forbids thee a known tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and yet thou wilt go on; when he telleth thee which is the way, and which not, and thou wilt not regard, no wonder if heaven and thy &s;oul be &s;trange: if thou wilt not follow the Spirit while it would draw thee to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and to duty; how &s;hould it lead thee to heaven, and bring thy heart into the pre&s;ence of GOD?

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> A De&s;cription of heavenly Contemplation.</HEAD>
<P>THE main thing intended is yet behind, and that which I aimed at when I &s;et upon this work. All that I have &s;aid is but the preparation to this. I once more entreat thee therefore, as thou art a man that make&s;t con&s;cience of a revealed duty, and that dare&s;t not wilfully re&s;i&s;t the Spirit, as thou value&s;t the high delights of a &s;aint, and as thou art faithful to the peace and pro&s;perity of thine own &s;oul, that thou diligently &s;tudy the directions following; and that thou &s;peedily and faithfully put them in practice: I pray thee therefore, re&s;olve before thou reade&s;t any further, and promi&s;e here as before the LORD, that if the following advice be whole&s;ome to thy &s;oul, thou wilt &s;eriou&s;ly &s;et thy&s;elf to the work, and that no lazine&s;s of &s;pirit &s;hall take thee off, nor le&s;&s;er bu|&s;ine&s;s interrupt thy cour&s;e, but that thou wilt approve thy&s;elf a doer of this word, and not an idle hearer only. Is this thy promi&s;e, and wilt thou &s;tand to it? Re&s;olve, man, and then I &s;hall be encouraged to give
<PB N="320" REF="022331_0319_0FB7EE020E7AB9E0">thee my advice; only try it throughly, and then judge: if in the faithful following of this cour&s;e thou do&s;t not find an increa&s;e of all thy graces, and art not made more &s;erviceable in thy place; if thy &s;oul en|joy not more fellow&s;hip with GOD, and thy life be not fuller of plea&s;ure, and thou have not comfort rea|dier by thee at a dying hour, and when thou ha&s;t greate&s;t need; then throw the&s;e directions back in my face, and exclaim again&s;t me as a deceiver for-ever: except GOD &s;hould leave thee uncomfortable for a little &s;ea&s;on, for the more glorious manife&s;tation of his attributes, and thy integrity; and &s;ingle thee out as he did <HI>Job,</HI> for an example of con&s;tancy and pati|ence, which would be but a preparative for thy ful|ler comfort. Certainly GOD will not for&s;ake this his own ordinance, but will be found of tho&s;e that thus diligently &s;eek him. GOD hath, as it were, appoint|ed to meet thee in this way: do not thou fail to give him the meeting, and thou &s;halt find by experience that he will not fail.</P>
<P>The duty which I pre&s;s upon thee &s;o earne&s;tly, I &s;hall now de&s;cribe: it is the &s;et and &s;olemn acting of all the powers of the &s;oul upon this mo&s;t perfect ob|ject (re&s;t) by meditation.</P>
<P>I will a little more fully explain the meaning of this de&s;cription, that &s;o the duty may lie plain before thee. 1. The general title that I give this duty is (meditation): not as it is preci&s;ely di&s;tingui&s;hed from cogitation, con&s;ideration, and contemplation; but as it is taken in the larger and u&s;ual &s;en&s;e for cogi|tation on things &s;piritual, and &s;o comprehending con&s;ideration and contemplation.</P>
<P>That meditation is a duty of GOD'S ordaining, not only in his written law, but al&s;o in nature it&s;elf, I never met with the man that would deny: but that
<PB N="321" REF="022331_0320_0FB7EE03B0AF4990">it is a duty con&s;tantly practi&s;ed, I mu&s;t, with &s;orrow, deny: it is in word confe&s;&s;ed to be a duty by all, but by the con&s;tant neglect denied by mo&s;t: and (I know not by what fatal &s;ecurity it comes to pa&s;s, that) men that are very tender con&s;cienced towards mo&s;t other duties, yet as ea&s;ily over&s;lip this, as if they knew it not to be a duty at all; they that are pre&s;ently trou|bled if they omit a &s;ermon, a fa&s;t, a prayer in pub|lic or private, yet were never troubled that they have omitted meditation, perhaps all their life-time to this very day: though it be that duty by which all other duties are improved, and by which the &s;oul dige&s;teth truths, and draweth forth their &s;trength for its nou|ri&s;hment. Certainly, I think, that as a man is but half an hour taking into his &s;tomach that meat which he mu&s;t have &s;even or eight hours to dige&s;t; &s;o a man may take into his under&s;tanding and memory more truth in one hour, than he is able well to dige&s;t in many. Therefore GOD commanded <HI>Ju&s;hua, That the book of the law &s;hould not depart out of his mouth, but that he &s;hould meditate therein day and night: that he might ob&s;erve to do according to that which is written therein.</HI> As dige&s;tion is the turning of the food into chyle and blood, and &s;pirits and fle&s;h; &s;o meditation rightly managed, turneth the truths received and re|membered into warm affection, rai&s;ed re&s;olution, and holy conver&s;ation. Therefore what good tho&s;e men are likely to get by &s;ermons or providences, who are unaccu&s;tomed to meditation, you may ea&s;ily judge. And why &s;o much preaching is lo&s;t among us, and men can run from &s;ermon to &s;ermon, and yet have &s;uch langui&s;hing &s;tarved &s;ouls, I know no truer cau&s;e than their neglect of meditation. If men heard one hour and meditated &s;even; if they did as con&s;tantly dige&s;t their &s;ermons as they hear them, they would find another kind of benefit by &s;ermons, than the or|dinary &s;ort of chri&s;tians do.</P>

But becau&s;e meditation is a general word, and it is not all meditation that I here intend, I &s;hall there|fore lay down the difference whereby this I am urg|ing is di&s;cerned from all other &s;orts of meditation. And the difference is taken from the act, and from the object of it.</P>
<P>From the act, which I call the &s;et and &s;olemn act|ing of all the powers of the &s;oul.</P>

<ITEM>1.

It is a work of the living, and not of the dead: it is a work or all other the mo&s;t &s;piritual, and therefore not to be well per|formed by a heart that is merely carnal.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. I call this meditation the acting of the powers of the &s;oul, meaning the &s;oul as rational. It is the work of the &s;oul; for bodily exerci&s;e doth here pro|fit but little. The &s;oul hath its labour and its ea&s;e, its bu&s;ine&s;s and its idlene&s;s, as well as the body; and diligent &s;tudents are u&s;ually as &s;en&s;ible of the labour and wearine&s;s of their &s;pirits, as they are of that of the members of the body. This action of the &s;oul is it I per&s;uade thee to.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. I call it the acting of ALL the powers of the &s;oul, to difference it from the common meditation of &s;tudents, which is u&s;ually the mere employment of the brain. It is not a bare thinking that I mean, nor the mere u&s;e of invention or memory, but a bu&s;ine&s;s of a higher and more excellent nature.</ITEM>

The under&s;tanding is not the whole &s;oul, and therefore cannot do the whole work: as GOD hath made &s;everal parts in man, to perform their &s;everal offices for his nouri&s;hment and life; &s;o hath he or|dained the faculties of the &s;oul to perform their &s;eve|ral offices for his &s;piritual life: &s;o the under&s;tanding mu&s;t take in truths, and prepare them for the will, and it mu&s;t received them, and commend them to the affections: the be&s;t dige&s;tion is in the bottom of the &s;tomach; the affections are as it were the bottom of the &s;oul, and therefore the be&s;t dige&s;tion is there: while truth is but a &s;peculation &s;wimming in the brain, the &s;oul hath not taken fa&s;t hold of it; <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and heaven have various excellencies, and therefore GOD hath formed the &s;oul with a power of divers ways of apprehending, that &s;o we might be capable of enjoying tho&s;e excellencies.</P>
<P>What good could all the glory of heaven have done us? or what plea&s;ure &s;hould we have had in the goodne&s;s of GOD him&s;elf, if we had been without the affections of love and joy, whereby we are capa|ble of being delighted in that goodne&s;s? So al&s;o, what &s;trength or &s;weetne&s;s can&s;t thou receive by thy meditations on eternity, while thou do&s;t not exerci&s;e tho&s;e affections which are the &s;en&s;es of the &s;oul, by which it mu&s;t receive this &s;trength and &s;weetne&s;s?</P>
<P>This is it that hath deceived chri&s;tians in this bu&s;ine&s;s: they have thought meditation is nothing but the bare thinking on truths, and the rolling of them in the under&s;tanding and memory, when every &s;chool|boy can do this.</P>
<P>Therefore this is the great ta&s;k in hand, and this is the work that I would &s;et thee on; to get the&s;e truths from thy head to thy heart; that all the &s;er|mons which thou ha&s;t heard of heaven, and all the
<PB N="324" REF="022331_0323_0FB7EE17463222C8">notions thou ha&s;t conceived of this re&s;t, may be turned into the blood and &s;pirit of affection, and thou may&s;t feel them revive thee, and warm thee at the heart, and may&s;t &s;o think of heaven, as heaven &s;hould be thought on.</P>
<P>If thou &s;hould&s;t &s;tudy nothing but heaven while thou live&s;t, and &s;hould&s;t have thy thoughts at com|mand, to turn them hither on every occa&s;ion, and yet &s;hould&s;t proceed no further than this; this were not the meditation that I intended: as it is thy whole &s;oul that mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s GOD hereafter, &s;o mu&s;t the whole in a lower manner, po&s;&s;e&s;s him here. I have &s;hewn you in the beginning of this treati&s;e, how the &s;oul mu&s;t enjoy the LORD in glory, to wit, by knowing, by loving, by joying in him: why, the very &s;ame way mu&s;t thou begin thy enjoyment here.</P>
<P>So much as thy under&s;tanding and affections are &s;incerely acted upon GOD, &s;o much do&s;t thou enjoy him: and this is the happy work of this meditation. So that you &s;ee here is &s;omewhat more to be done, than barely to remember and think of heaven: as run|ning, and &s;uch like labours, do not only &s;tir a hand or foot, but &s;train and exerci&s;e the whole body; &s;o doth meditation the whole &s;oul.</P>

<PB N="325" REF="022331_0324_0FB7EE1A2A1479E8">him, for aught I know thy book is as much a chri&s;ti|an as thou.</P>
<P>I call this meditation &s;et and &s;olemn, to difference it from that which is occa&s;ional. As there is prayer which is &s;olemn, when we &s;et our&s;elves wholly to the duty; and prayer which is &s;udden and &s;hort, com|monly called ejaculations, when a man in the mid&s;t of other bu&s;ine&s;s, doth &s;end up &s;ome brief reque&s;t to GOD: &s;o al&s;o there is meditation &s;olemn, when we apply our&s;elves only to that work; and there is me|ditation which is &s;hort and cur&s;ory, when in the mid&s;t of our bu&s;ine&s;s we have &s;ome good thoughts of GOD in our minds. And as &s;olemn prayer is either fir&s;t &s;et, when a chri&s;tian ob&s;erving it as a &s;tanding duty, doth re&s;olvedly practi&s;e it in a con&s;tant cour&s;e; or &s;econd|ly, occa&s;ional, when &s;ome unu&s;ual occa&s;ion doth put us upon it at a &s;ea&s;on extraordinary: &s;o al&s;o medita|tion.</P>
<P>Now, though I would per&s;uade you to that medi|tation which is mixed with your common labours, and to that which &s;pecial occa&s;ions direct you to; yet the&s;e are not the main things which I here intend: but that you would make it a con&s;tant &s;tanding duty, as you do hearing, and praying, and reading the &s;cripture, and that you would &s;olemnly &s;et your&s;elves about it, and make it for that time your whole work, and intermix other matters no more with it, than you would do with praying, or other duties. Thus you &s;ee, what kind of meditation it is that we &s;peak of, <HI>wiz.</HI> the &s;et and &s;olemn acting of all the powers of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>The &s;econd part of the difference is drawn from its object, which is re&s;t, or the mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed e&s;tate of man in his everla&s;ting enjoyment of GOD in heaven. Me|ditation hath a large field to walk in, and hath as ma|ny
<PB N="326" REF="022331_0325_0FB7EE1AD4A4B6B8">objects to work upon, as there are matters, and lines, and words in the &s;criptures, as there are known creatures in the whole creation, and as there are par|ticular di&s;cernable pa&s;&s;ages of Providence in the go|vernment of per&s;ons and actions through the world: but the meditation that I now direct you in, is only of the end of all the&s;e, and of the&s;e as they refer to that end: it is not a walk from mountains to valleys, from &s;ea to land, from kingdom to kingdom, from planet to planet; but it is a walk from mountains and valleys to the holy mount <HI>Sion;</HI> from &s;ea and land to the land of the living; from the kingdoms of this world, to the kingdom of &s;aints; from earth to hea|ven; from time to eternity. It is a walking upon the &s;un, and moon, and &s;tars; it is a walk in the garden and paradi&s;e of GOD. It may &s;eem far off; but &s;pirits are quick: whether in the body, or out of the body, their motion is &s;wift; they are not &s;o heavy or dull as the&s;e earthly lumps, nor &s;o &s;low of motion as the&s;e clods of fle&s;h. I would not have you ca&s;t off your other me|ditations; but &s;urely as heaven hath the pre-eminence in perfection, &s;o &s;hould it have the pre-eminence al&s;o in our meditation: that which will make us mo&s;t hap|py when we po&s;&s;e&s;s it, will make us mo&s;t joyful when we meditate upon it; e&s;pecially when that meditation is a degree of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, if it be &s;uch affecting medi|tation as I here de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>You need not here be troubled with fear, le&s;t &s;tu|dying &s;o much on the&s;e high matters &s;hould make you mad. If I &s;et you to meditate as much on &s;in and wrath, and to &s;tudy nothing but judgment and dam|nation, then you might fear &s;uch an i&s;&s;ue: but it is heaven, and not hell, that I would per&s;uade you to walk in; it is joy, and not &s;orrow, that I per&s;uade you to exerci&s;e.

<P>And 1. for the time, I advi&s;e thee that as much as may be, it be &s;et and con&s;tant. Proportion out &s;uch a part of thy time to the work.</P>
<P>Stick not at their &s;cruple, who que&s;tion the &s;tating of times as &s;uper&s;titious: if thou &s;uit out thy time to the advantage of the work, and place no religion in the time it&s;elf; thou neede&s;t not to fear le&s;t this be &s;uper&s;tition. As a workman in his &s;hop will have a &s;et place for every one of his tools, or el&s;e when be &s;hould u&s;e it, it may be to &s;eek; &s;o a chri&s;tian &s;hould have a &s;et time for every ordinary duty, or el&s;e when he &s;hould practi&s;e it, it is ten to one but he will be put by it. Stated time is a hedge to duty, and de|fends it again&s;t many temptations to omi&s;&s;ion. GOD hath &s;tated none but the LORD'S day him&s;elf; but he hath left it to be &s;tated by our&s;elves, according to every man's condition and occa&s;ions, le&s;t otherwi&s;e his law &s;hould have been a burden or a &s;nare. Yet hath he left us general rules, which by the u&s;e of rea|&s;on, and chri&s;tian prudence, may help us to deter|mine the fitte&s;t times.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="022331_0328_0FB7EE2BCC7BA9D8">
It is as ridiculous a que&s;tion of them that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Where &s;cripture commands to pray &s;o oft, or at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hours? as if they a&s;ked, Where the &s;cripture com|mands that the church &s;tand in &s;uch a place? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> pulpit in &s;uch a place? or my &s;eat in &s;uch a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> or where it commands a man to read the &s;criptures with a pair of &s;pectacles?</P>
<P>Mo&s;t that I have known to argue again&s;t a &s;tated time, have at la&s;t grown carele&s;s of the duty it&s;elf, and &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wed more di&s;like again&s;t the work than be time. If GOD gave me &s;o much money or wealth, and tell me not how much in &s;cripture &s;uch a poor man mu&s;t have, nor how much my family, nor how much in clothes, and how much in expences: is it not lawful, yea, and nece&s;&s;ary, that I make the di|vi&s;ion my&s;elf, and allow to each the due portion? So if GOD doth be&s;tow on me a day or week of time, and give me &s;uch and &s;uch work to do in this time, and tell me not how much I &s;hall allot to each work; certainly I mu&s;t make the divi&s;ion my&s;elf, and pro|portion it wi&s;ely and carefully too. Though GOD hath not told you at what hour you &s;hall ri&s;e in the morning, or at what hours you &s;hall eat and drink; yet your own rea&s;on, and experience will tell you, that ordinarily you &s;hould ob&s;erve a &s;tated time. Neither let the fear of cu&s;tomarine&s;s and formality deter you from this. This argument hath brought the LORD'S &s;upper from once a week to once a quar|ter, or once a year; and it hath brought family du|ties with too many of late, from twice a day to once a week, or once a month.</P>
<P>I advi&s;e thee therefore, if well thou may&s;t, to al|low this duty a &s;tated time, and be as con&s;tant in it, as in hearing and praying: yet be cautious in under|&s;tanding this. I know this will not prove ever, man's duty: &s;ome have not them&s;elves and their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> com|mand,
<PB N="330" REF="022331_0329_0FB7EE2CE5FF2858">and therefore cannot &s;et their hours; &s;uch are, mo&s;t &s;ervants, and many children of poor parents; and many are &s;o poor, that the nece&s;&s;ity of their families will deny them this freedom. I do not think it the duty of &s;uch to leave their labours for this work ju&s;t at certain &s;et times, no nor for prayer. Of two du|ties we mu&s;t choo&s;e the greater, though of two &s;ins we mu&s;t choo&s;e neither. I think &s;uch per&s;ons were be&s;t to be watchful, to redeem time as much as they can, and take their vacant opportunities as they fall, and e&s;pecially to join meditation and prayer, as much as they can, with the labours of their callings. There is no &s;uch enmity between labouring, and meditating or praying in the &s;pirit, but that both may be done together; yet I &s;ay, as <HI>Paul</HI> in another ca&s;e, <HI>if thou can&s;t be free, u&s;e it rather.</HI> Tho&s;e that have more &s;pare time, I &s;till advi&s;e, that they keep this duty to a &s;tated time. And indeed it were no ill hu&s;bandry, nor point of folly, if we did &s;o by all other duties; if we con&s;idered the ordinary works of the day, and &s;uited out a fit &s;ea&s;on and proportion of time to every work, and fixed this in our memory and re&s;olution, or wrote it in a table, and kept it in our clo&s;ets, and never broke it but upon unexpected and extraordinary cau&s;es: if every work of the day had thus its appoint|ed time, we &s;hould be better &s;killed, both in redeem|ing time, and performing duty.</P>
<P N="2">2. I advi&s;e thee al&s;o, concerning thy time for this duty, that as it be &s;tated, &s;o it be frequent: ju&s;t how oft it &s;hould be, I cannot determine, becau&s;e men's conditions may vary it: but in general, that it be fre|quent, the &s;cripture requireth, when it mentioneth meditating continually, and day and night. Circum|&s;tances of our condition, may much vary the circum|&s;tance of our duties. It may be one man's duty to hear or pray oftener than another, and &s;o it may be in this of meditation: but for tho&s;e that can conve|niently
<PB N="331" REF="022331_0330_0FB7EE304A1C6CB8">omit other bu&s;ine&s;s, I advi&s;e, that it be once a day at lea&s;t. Though &s;cripture tells us not how oft in a day we &s;hould eat or drink; yet prudence and experience will direct us twice or thrice a day.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that think they &s;hould not tie them&s;elves to order and number of duties; but &s;hould then only me|ditate or pray, when they find the Spirit provoking them to it, go upon uncertain and unchri&s;tian grounds. I am &s;ure, the &s;cripture provokes us to frequency, and our nece&s;&s;ity &s;econdeth the voice of &s;cripture; and if through my own neglect, or re&s;i&s;ting the Spirit, I do not find it &s;o excite me, I dare not therefore di&s;obey the &s;cripture, nor neglect the nece&s;&s;ities of my own &s;oul. I &s;hould &s;u&s;pect that &s;pirit which would turn my &s;oul from con&s;tancy in duty: if the Spirit in &s;crip|ture bid me meditate or pray, I dare not forbear it, becau&s;e I find not the &s;pirit within me to &s;econd the command: if I find not incitation to duty before, yet I may find a&s;&s;i&s;tance while I wait in performance. I am afraid of laying my corruptions upon the Spirit, or blaming the want of the Spirit's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, when I &s;hould blame the backwardne&s;s of my own heart; nor dare I make one corruption a plea for another; nor urge the inward rebellion of my nature, as a rea|&s;on for the outward di&s;obedience of my life; and for the healing of my nature's backwardne&s;s, I more ex|pect that the Spirit of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hould do it in a way of duty, than in a way of di&s;obedience and neglect of du|ty. Men that fall on duty according to the frame of their &s;pirit only, are like our ignorant vulgar, who think their appetite &s;hould be the only rule of their eating; when a wi&s;e man judgeth by rea&s;on and ex|perience, le&s;t when his appetite is depraved, he &s;hould either &s;urfeit or fami&s;h. Our appetite is no &s;ure rule for our times of duty; but the word of GOD in gene|ral, and our &s;piritual rea&s;on, experience, nece&s;&s;ity, and convenience in particular, may truly direct us.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="022331_0331_0FB7EE314F4F76D0">
Three rea&s;ons e&s;pecially &s;hould per&s;uade thee to frequency in this meditation on heaven.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Becau&s;e &s;eldom conver&s;ing with him will breed a &s;trangene&s;s betwixt thy &s;oul and GOD: frequent &s;ociety breeds familiarity, and familiarity increa&s;eth love and delight, and maketh us bold and confident in our addre&s;&s;es. This is the main end of this duty, that thou may&s;t have acquaintance and fellow&s;hip with GOD therein; therefore if thou come but &s;el|dom to it, thou wilt keep thy&s;elf a &s;tranger &s;till, and &s;o mi&s;s of the end of the work.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Seldomne&s;s will make thee un&s;kilful in the work, and &s;trange to the duty, as well as to GOD. How clum&s;ily do men &s;et their hands to a work they are &s;eldom employed in! whereas frequency will habitu|ate thy heart to the work, and thou wilt better know the way in which thou daily walke&s;t, yea, and it will be more ea&s;y and delightful al&s;o: the hill which made thee pant and blow at the fir&s;t going up, thou may&s;t run up ea&s;ily when thou art once accu&s;tomed to it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. And la&s;tly, Thou wilt lo&s;e that heat and life by long intermi&s;&s;ions, which with much ado thou did&s;t obtain in duty. If thou eat but a meal in two or three days, thou wilt lo&s;e thy &s;trength as fa&s;t as thou gette&s;t it: if in holy meditation thou get near to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and warm thy heart with the fire of love, if thou then turn away, and come but &s;eldom, thou wilt &s;oon return to thy former coldne&s;s.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>It is true, the intermixed u&s;e of other duties may do much to the keeping thy heart above, e&s;pecially &s;ecret prayer: but meditation is the life of mo&s;t other duties; and the view of heaven is the life of meditation.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="333" REF="022331_0332_0FB7EE32E4B18248">
3. Concerning the time of this duty, I advi&s;e thee, that thou choo&s;e the mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable time. All things are beautiful in their &s;ea&s;on. Un&s;ea&s;onablene&s;s may lo&s;e thee the fruit of thy labour; it may rai&s;e di&s;turb|ances and difficulties in the work; yea, it may turn a duty to &s;in; when the &s;ea&s;onablene&s;s of a duty doth make it ea&s;y, doth remove impediments, doth em|bolden us to the undertaking, and ripen its fruit.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;ons of this duty are either, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> ordinary: or, <HI>Secondly,</HI> extraordinary.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The ordinary &s;ea&s;on of your daily perform|ance cannot be particularly determined, otherwi&s;e GOD would have determined in his word. Men's conditions of employment, and freedom, and bodily temper, are &s;o various, that the &s;ame may be a &s;ea|&s;onable hour to one, which may be un&s;ea&s;onable to another. If thou be a &s;ervant, or an hard labourer, that thou ha&s;t not thy time at command, thou mu&s;t take that &s;ea&s;on which thy bu&s;ine&s;s will be&s;t afford: either as thou &s;itte&s;t in the &s;hop at thy work, or as thou travelle&s;t on the way, or as thou lie&s;t waking in the night. Every man be&s;t knows his own time, even when he hath the lea&s;t to hinder him in the world: but for tho&s;e who&s;e nece&s;&s;ities tie them not &s;o clo&s;e, but that they may choo&s;e what time of the day they will, my advice to &s;uch is, that they care|fully ob&s;erve the temper of their body and mind, and mark when they find their &s;pirits mo&s;t active and fit for contemplation, and pitch upon that as the &s;tated time. Some men are free&s;t for duties when they are fa&s;ting, and &s;ome are then unfitte&s;t of all. Every man is the meete&s;t judge for him&s;elf. The time I have always found fitte&s;t for my&s;elf, is, the evening, from &s;un-&s;etting to the twilight; and &s;ometime in the night when it is warm and clear.</P>

<P><PB N="335" REF="022331_0334_0FB7EE41948FEE68">
<HI>Secondly,</HI> For the extraordinary performance, the&s;e following are &s;ea&s;onable times.</P>
<P N="1">1. When GOD doth extraordinarily revive thy &s;pi|rit. When GOD hath enkindled thy &s;pirit with fire from above, it is that it may mount aloft more free|ly. It is a choice part of a chri&s;tian's &s;kill, to ob&s;erve the temper of his own &s;pirit, and to ob&s;erve the gales of grace, and how the Spirit of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> doth move up|on his. <HI>Without Chri&s;t we can do nothing:</HI> therefore let us be doing when he is doing; and be &s;ure not to be out of the way, nor a&s;leep when he comes. A lit|tle labour will &s;et thy heart a going at &s;uch a time, when another time thou may&s;t take pains to little pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. When thou art ca&s;t into troubles of mind, through &s;ufferings, or fear, or care, or temptations, then it is &s;ea&s;onable to addre&s;s thy&s;elf to this duty. When &s;hould we take our cordials, but in our times of faint|ing? When is it more &s;ea&s;onable to walk to heaven, than when we know not in what corner on earth to live with comfort? Or when &s;hould our thoughts con|ver&s;e above, but when they have nothing but grief to conver&s;e with below?</P>
<P>Another fit &s;ea&s;on for this heavenly duty, is, when the me&s;&s;engers of GOD &s;ummon us to die; when either our grey hairs, or our langui&s;hing bodies, or &s;ome &s;uch fore-runners of death, tell us that our change can|not be far off; when &s;hould we more frequently &s;weet|en our &s;ouls with the believing thoughts of another life, than when we find that this is almo&s;t ended and when fle&s;h is rai&s;ing fears and terrors? Surely no m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n have greater need of &s;upporting joys than dying men; and tho&s;e joys mu&s;t be fetched from our eternal joy.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="022331_0335_0FB7EE47CB42B890">
It now follows that I &s;peak a word of the fitte&s;t place. Though GOD is every where to be found, yet &s;ome places are more convenient than others.</P>
<P N="1">1. As this is a private and &s;piritual duty, &s;o it is mo&s;t convenient that thou retire to &s;ome private place; our &s;pirits had need of every help, and to be freed from every hinderance in the work. For occa&s;ional meditation I give thee not this advice; but for &s;et and &s;olemn duty, I advi&s;e, that thou withdraw thy&s;elf from all &s;ociety, that thou may&s;t awhile enjoy the &s;o|ciety of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>And as I advi&s;e thee to a place of retiredne&s;s; &s;o al&s;o that thou ob&s;erve more particularly, what place or po&s;ture be&s;t agreeth with thy &s;pirit; whether with|in door, or without; whether &s;itting &s;till, or walking. I believe <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s example in this al&s;o, will direct us to the place and po&s;ture which will be&s;t &s;uit with mo&s;t, as it doth with me, <HI>viz. His walking forth to meditate in the field at the even-tide.</HI> And <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s own example gives us the like direction. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was u&s;ed to a &s;o|litary garden; and though he took his di&s;ciples thi|ther with him, yet did he &s;eparate him&s;elf from them for more &s;ecret devotions.</P>
<P>I am next to advi&s;e thee &s;omewhat concerning the preparations of thy heart. The &s;ucce&s;s of the work doth much depend on the frame of thy heart. When man's heart had nothing in it that might grieve the Spirit, then was it the delightful habitation of his Maker. GOD did not quit his re&s;idence there, till man did repel him by unworthy provocations. There grew no &s;trangene&s;s, till the heart grew &s;inful, and too loath&s;ome a dungeon for GOD to delight in. And were this &s;oul re&s;tored to its former innocency, GOD would quickly return to his former habitation: yea, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> far as it is renewed and repaired by the Spirit, the
<PB N="337" REF="022331_0336_0FB7EE4AF21A2C00">LORD will yet acknowledge it his own, and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> will manife&s;t him&s;elf unto it, and the Spirit will take it for its temple and re&s;idence. So far as the &s;oul is qualified for conver&s;ing with GOD, &s;o far it doth ac|tually enjoy him. Therefore <HI>keep thy heart with all diligence, for from thence are the i&s;&s;ues of life.</HI></P>
<P>More particularly, when thou &s;ette&s;t on this duty, 1. Get thy heart as clear from the world as thou can&s;t; wholly lay by the thoughts of thy bu&s;ine&s;s, of thy troubles, of thy enjoyments, and of every thing that may take up any room in thy &s;oul. Get thy &s;oul as empty as po&s;&s;ibly thou can&s;t, that &s;o it may be the more capable of being filled with GOD. It is a work that will require all the powers of thy &s;oul, if they were a thou&s;and times more capacious and active than they are, and therefore you have need to lay by all other thoughts and affections while you are bu&s;i|ed here.</P>
<P N="2">2. Be &s;ure thou &s;et upon this work with the great|e&s;t &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s that po&s;&s;ibly thou can&s;t. Cu&s;tomarine&s;s here is a killing &s;in. There is no trifling in holy things; GOD will be &s;anctified of all that draw near him. The&s;e &s;piritual duties are the mo&s;t dangerous, if we mi&s;carry in them, of all. The more they ad|vance the &s;oul, being well u&s;ed, the more they de|&s;troy it, being u&s;ed unfaithfully; as the be&s;t meats corrupted are the wor&s;t.</P>
<P>To help thee therefore to be &s;erious when thou &s;et|te&s;t on this work; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> labour to have the deepe&s;t apprehen&s;ions of the pre&s;ence of GOD, and of the in|comprehen&s;ible greatne&s;s of the maje&s;ty which thou appreache&s;t. Think with what reverence thou &s;hould&s;t approach thy Maker: think thou art addre&s;|&s;ing thy&s;elf to him, <HI>that made the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lds with the
<PB N="338" REF="022331_0337_0FB7EE4C4EF5C9C8">word of his mouth; that upholds the earth as in the palm of his hand; that keeps the &s;un, and moon, and heaven in their cour&s;es; that bounds the raging &s;ea with the &s;ands, and &s;aith, Hitherto go, and no further:</HI> thou art going to conver&s;e with him, before whom the earth will quake, and devils tremble; before who&s;e bar thou mu&s;t &s;hortly &s;tand, and all the world with thee, to re|ceive their doom. O think, I &s;hall then have lively apprehen&s;ions of his maje&s;ty: my drow&s;y &s;pirits will then be wakened: why &s;hould I not now be rou&s;ed with the &s;en&s;e of his greatne&s;s, and the dread of his name po&s;&s;e&s;s my &s;oul.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Labour to apprehend the greatne&s;s of the work which thou attempte&s;t, and to be deeply &s;en&s;ible both of its weight and height. If thou wert pleading for thy life at the bar of a judge, thou would&s;t be &s;erious; and yet that were but a trifle to this: if thou were engaged in &s;uch a work as <HI>David</HI> was again&s;t <HI>Goliah,</HI> whereon the kingdom's deliverance depended, in it&s;eif con&s;idered, it were nothing to this. Suppo&s;e thou wert going to &s;uch a wre&s;tling as <HI>Ja|cob</HI>'s; &s;uppo&s;e thou wert going to &s;ee the &s;ight which the three di&s;ciples &s;aw in the mount; how &s;eriou&s;ly, how reverently would&s;t thou both approach and be|hold! If &s;ome angel from heaven &s;hould but appoint to meet thee, at the time and place of thy contem|plation, how apprehen&s;ively would&s;t thou go to meet him! Why, con&s;ider then with what a &s;pirit thou &s;hould&s;t meet the LORD, and with what &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and dread thou &s;hould&s;t daily conver&s;e with him.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider al&s;o the ble&s;&s;ed i&s;&s;ue of the work. If it &s;ucceed, it will be an admi&s;&s;ion of thee into the pre|&s;ence of GOD, a beginning of thy eternal glory on earth; a means to make thee live above the rate of other men, and admit thee into the next room to the

<P>TO draw the heart nearer the work; the next thing to be di&s;covered, is, What powers of the &s;oul mu&s;t here be acted, what affections excited, what con&s;iderations are nece&s;&s;ary thereto, and in what or|der we mu&s;t proceed.</P>
<P N="1">1. You mu&s;t go to the memory, which is the ma|gazine or trea&s;ury of the under&s;tanding, thence you mu&s;t take forth tho&s;e heavenly doctrines which you intend to make the &s;ubject of your meditation. For the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, you may look over any promi&s;e of eternal life in the go&s;pel; any de&s;cription of the glory of the &s;aints, of the re&s;urrection of the body, and life everla&s;ting: &s;ome one &s;entence concerning tho&s;e eternal joys, may afford you matter for many years meditation; yet it will be a point of wi&s;dom here, to have always a &s;tock of matter in your me|mory, that &s;o when we &s;hould u&s;e it, we may bring forth out of our trea&s;ury things new and old. If we took things in order, and ob&s;erved &s;ome method in re&s;pect of the matter, and did meditate fir&s;t on one truth concerning eternity, and then another, it would not be ami&s;s. And if any &s;hould be barren of matter through weakne&s;s of memory, they may have notes or books of this &s;ubject for their furtherance.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="340" REF="022331_0339_0FB7EE5A82D90100">
2. When you have fetched from your memory the matter of your meditation, your next work is to pre|&s;ent it to your judgment: open there the ca&s;e as fully as thou can&s;t, &s;et forth the &s;everal ornaments of the crown, the &s;everal dignities belonging to the kingdom, as they are partly laid open in the begin|ning of this book: let judgment deliberately view them over, and take as exact a &s;urvey as it can; then put the que&s;tion, and require a determination. Is there happine&s;s in all this, or not? Is not here enough to make me ble&s;&s;ed? Can he want any thing, who fully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth GOD? Is there any thing higher for a creature to attain? Thus urge thy judgment to pa&s;s an upright &s;entence, and compel it to &s;ub&s;cribe to the perfection of thy cele&s;tial happine&s;s, and to lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e this &s;entence as under its hand upon record.</P>
<P>Thus exerci&s;e thy judgment in the contemplation of thy re&s;t; thus magnify and advance the LORD in thy heart, till an holy admiration hath po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed thy &s;oul.</P>
<P N="3">3. But the great work, which you may either pre|mi&s;e, or &s;ubjoin to this as you plea&s;e, is, to exerci&s;e thy belief of the truth of thy re&s;t; and that both in re&s;pect of the truth of the promi&s;e, and al&s;o the truth of thy own intere&s;t and title.

<P>Therefore let this be a chief part of thy bu&s;ine&s;s in meditation. Read over the promi&s;es: &s;tady all con|firming providences. Call forth thine own experien|ces: remember the &s;criptures already fulfilled both to the church and &s;aints in the former ages, and emi|nently to both in this pre&s;ent age, and tho&s;e that have been fulfilled particularly to thee.</P>
<P>Set before your faith, the freene&s;s and the univer|&s;ality of the promi&s;e: con&s;ider GOD'S offer, and urge it upon all, that he hath accepted from the conditi|onal covenant no man in the worl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, nor will exclude any from heaven, who will accept of his offer. Stu|dy al&s;o the gracious di&s;po&s;ition of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and his rea|dine&s;s to welcome all that will come: &s;tudy all the evidences of his love, which appeared in his &s;uffer|ings, in his preaching the go&s;pel, in his conde&s;cen|&s;ion to &s;inners, in his ea&s;y conditions, in his exceed|ing patience, and in his urgent invitations: do not all the&s;e di&s;cover his readine&s;s to &s;ave? Did he ever manife&s;t him&s;elf unwilling? Remember al&s;o his faith|fulne&s;s to perform his engagements. Study al&s;o the evidences of his love in thy&s;elf; look over the works of his grace in thy &s;oul: if thou do&s;t not find the
<PB N="342" REF="022331_0341_0FB7EE5CECEDF7E8">degree which thou de&s;ire&s;t, yet deny not that degree which thou finde&s;t. Remember what di&s;coveries of thy &s;tate thou ha&s;t made formerly in the work of &s;elf-examination. Remember all the former te&s;timonies of the Spirit; and all the &s;weet feelings of the fa|vour of GOD: and all the prayers that he hath heard and granted; and all the pre&s;ervations and deliver|ances; and all the progre&s;s of his Spirit, in his work|ings on thy &s;oul, and the di&s;po&s;als of Providence, conducing to thy good; and vouch&s;afing of means, the directing thee to them, the directing of mini&s;ters to meet with thy &s;tate, the re&s;traint of tho&s;e &s;ins that thy nature was mo&s;t prone to. Lay the&s;e all together, and then think with thy&s;elf, whether all the&s;e do not te&s;tify the good will of the LORD concerning thy &s;al|vation? And whether thou may&s;t not conclude with <HI>Samp&s;on</HI>'s mother, when her hu&s;band thought they &s;hould &s;urely die, <HI>If the Lord were plea&s;ed to kill us, be would not have received an offering at our hands, neither would he have &s;hewed us all the&s;e things; nor would, as at this time, have told us &s;uch things as the&s;e,</HI> Judges xiii. 22, 23.</P>
<P N="2">2. When the meditation hath thus proceeded about the truth of thy happine&s;s the next part of the work is to meditate of its goodne&s;s; that when the judg|ment hath determined, and faith hath apprehended, it may then pa&s;s on to rai&s;e the affections.</P>

<P N="4">4. The la&s;t affection to be acted, is joy. This is the end of all the re&s;t; love, de&s;ire, hope, tend to the rai&s;ing of our joy. And is it nothing to have a deed of gift from GOD? Are his infallible promi&s;es no ground of joy? Is it nothing to live in daily ex|pectation of entering into the kingdom? Is not my a&s;&s;urance of being glorified one day, a &s;ufficient ground for inexpre&s;&s;ible joy?

<P>THE next part of this directory, is to &s;hew you what advantages you &s;hould take, and what helps you &s;hould u&s;e, to make your meditations of heaven more quickening, and to make you ta&s;te the &s;weetne&s;s that is therein. For this is the main work, that you may not &s;tick in a bare thinking, but may have the lively &s;en&s;e of all upon your hearts: and this you will find to be the mo&s;t difficult part of the work. It is ea&s;ier to think of heaven a whole day, than to be lively and affectionate in tho&s;e thoughts one quar|ter of an hour. Therefore let us yet a little further con&s;ider what may be done, to make your thoughts of heaven piercing, affecting thoughts.</P>
<P>It will be a point of &s;piritual prudence, and a &s;in|gular help to the furthering of faith, to call in our &s;en&s;es to its a&s;&s;i&s;tance: if we can make us friends of tho&s;e u&s;ual enemies, and make them in&s;truments of rai&s;ing us to GOD, which are the u&s;ual means of drawing us from GOD, we &s;hall perform a very ex|cellent work. Sure it is both po&s;&s;ible and lawful to do &s;omething in this kind; for GOD would not have given us either &s;en&s;es them&s;elves, or their u&s;ual ob|jects,
<PB N="355" REF="022331_0354_0FB7EE879A38EBD0">if they might not have been &s;erviceable to his own prai&s;e, and helps to rai&s;e us to the apprehen&s;ion of higher things: and it is very con&s;iderable, how the Holy Gho&s;t doth conde&s;cend, in the phra&s;e of &s;cripture, in bringing things down to the reach of &s;en&s;e; how he &s;ets forth the excellencies of &s;piritual things in words that are borrowed from the objects of &s;en&s;e. Doubtle&s;s, if &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions had not been be&s;t, and to us nece&s;&s;ary, the Holy Gho&s;t would not have &s;o frequently u&s;ed them: he that will &s;peak to man's under&s;tanding, mu&s;t &s;peak in man's language, and &s;peak that which he is capable to conceive.</P>
<P N="1">1. Go to then; when thou &s;ette&s;t thy&s;elf to medi|tate on the joys above, think on them boldly as &s;crip|ture hath expre&s;&s;ed them: bring down thy conceivings to the reach of &s;en&s;e. Excellency withou familiari|ty, doth more amaze than delight us; but love and joy are promoted by familiar acquaintance: when we go about to think of GOD and glory without the&s;e &s;pectacles, we are lo&s;t, and have nothing to fix our thoughts upon; we &s;et GOD and heaven &s;o far from us, that our thoughts are &s;trange, and we look at them as things beyond our reach, and are ready to &s;ay, that which is above is nothing to us: to conceive no more of GOD and glory, but that we cannot con|ceive them; and to apprehend no more, but that they are pa&s;t apprehen&s;ion, will produce no more love but this, to acknowledge that they are &s;o far above us that we cannot love them, and no more joy but this, that they are above our rejoicing. And therefore put <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> no further from you, than he hath put him&s;elf, le&s;t the divine nature be again inacce&s;&s;ible. Think of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as in our own nature glorified; think of our follow-&s;aints as men there perfected; think of the ci|ty and &s;tate as the Spirit hath expre&s;&s;ed it, only with caution.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> How to manage and watch over the Heart through the whole Work.</HEAD>
<P>THE la&s;t part of this directory, is, to guide you in managing your hearts through this work, and to &s;hew you wherein you had need to be exceeding watchful. I have &s;hewed before, what mu&s;t be done with your hearts in your preparations to the work, and in your &s;etting upon it: I &s;hall new &s;hew it you, in re&s;pect of the time of the performance. Our chief work will here be, to di&s;cover to you the danger, and that will direct you to the remedy. Let me therefore acquaint you before-hand, that whenever you &s;et upon this heavenly employment, you &s;hall find your own hearts your greate&s;t hinderer, and they will prove fal&s;e to you in one or all of the&s;e &s;our degrees. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> they will hold off, that you will hardly get them to the work; or el&s;e they will betray you by their idle|ne&s;s in the work, pretending to do it, when they do it not; or they will interrupt the work, by their fre|quent
<PB N="370" REF="022331_0369_0FB7EEB2D44E3E00">excur&s;ions, and turning a&s;ide to every object; or they will &s;poil the work by cutting it &s;hort, and be gone before you have done any good at it. There|fore I forewarn you, as you value the invaluable comfort of this work, faithfully re&s;i&s;t the&s;e four dan|gerous evils.</P>
<P N="1">1. Thou &s;halt find thy heart as backward to this, as to any work in the world. O what excu&s;es it will make! what eva&s;ions it will find out! and what de|lays, when it is never &s;o much convinced! Either it will que&s;tion, whether it be a duty or not; or, if it be &s;o to others, yet whether it be &s;o to thee? It will take up any thing like rea&s;on to plead again&s;t it; or, if thy heart have nothing again&s;t the work, then it will trifle away the time in delays, and promi&s;e this day and the next, but &s;till keep off; or la&s;tly, if thou wilt not be &s;o baffled with excu&s;es or delays, thy heart will give thee a flat denial, and oppo&s;e its own unwillingne&s;s to thy rea&s;on; thou &s;halt find it draw back with all the &s;trength it hath. I &s;peak all this of the heart &s;o far as it is carnal; for &s;o far as it is &s;piritual, it will judge this work the &s;weete&s;t in the world.</P>
<P>But take up the authority which GOD hath given thee, command thy heart; if it rebel, u&s;e violence with it; if thou be too weak, call in the Spirit of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to thine a&s;&s;i&s;tance; he is never backward to &s;o good a work, nor will deny his help in &s;o ju&s;t a cau&s;e: GOD will be ready to help thee, if thou be not unwilling to help thy&s;elf. Say unto him, "LORD, thou gave&s;t my rea&s;on the command of my thoughts and affecti|ons; the authority I have received over them, is from thee, and now, behold they refu&s;e to obey thine autho|rity; thou commande&s;t me to &s;et them to the work of heavenly meditation, but they rebel and &s;tubbornly refu&s;e the duty; wilt thou not a&s;&s;i&s;t me to execute
<PB N="371" REF="022331_0370_0FB7EEB48C8AE060">that authority which thou ha&s;t given me? O &s;end down thy Spirit and power, that I may enforce thy commands, and effectually compel them to obey thy will."</P>
<P>And thus doing, thou &s;halt &s;ee thy heart will &s;ub|mit; its re&s;i&s;tance will be brought under; and its back|wardne&s;s will be turned to compliance.</P>
<P N="2">2. When thou ha&s;t got thy heart to the work, be|ware le&s;t it delude thee by a loitering formality; le&s;t it &s;ay, I go, and go not; le&s;t it trifle out the time, while it &s;hould be effectually meditating. When thou ha&s;t perhaps but an hour's time for meditation, the time will be &s;pent before thy heart will be &s;erious. This doing of duty, as if we did it not, doth undo as many as the flat omi&s;&s;ion of it. To rub out the hour in a ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e lazy th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nking of heaven, is but to lo&s;e that hour, and delude thy&s;elf. What is to be done in this ca&s;e? Why, do here al&s;o as you do by a loitering &s;ervant; keep thine eye always upon thy heart; look not &s;o much to the time it &s;pendeth in the duty, as to the work that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> done: you can tell by his work, whe|ther your &s;ervant hath been painful: a&s;k, what affecti|ons have yet been acted? How much am I yet got nearer heaven? Verily many a man's heart mu&s;t be followed as clo&s;e in this duty of meditation, as an ox at the plough, that will go no longer than you are call|ing or &s;courging; if you cea&s;e driving but a moment, the heart will &s;tand &s;till.</P>
<P>I would not have thee of the judgment of tho&s;e who think that while they are &s;o backward, it is better let it alone; and that if mere love will not bring them to the duty, the &s;ervice is wor&s;e than the omi&s;&s;ion: the&s;e men un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er&s;tand not, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> that this argument would certainly ca&s;hier all &s;piritual obedience; nor do they under&s;tand well the corruptne&s;s of their own
<PB N="372" REF="022331_0371_0FB7EEB72A4ED750">natures; nor that their &s;inful undi&s;po&s;edne&s;s will not &s;u&s;pend the commands of God; not one &s;in excu&s;e another; e&s;pecially they little know the way of GOD to excite their affections; and that the love which &s;hould compel them, mu&s;t it&s;elf be fir&s;t compelled, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e as it is &s;aid to compel: love I know is a mo&s;t precious grace, and &s;hould have the chief in|tere&s;t in all our duties; but there are means appointed by GOD to procure this love; and &s;hall I not u&s;e tho&s;e means, till I can u&s;e them from love? that were to neglect the means, till I have the end. Mu&s;t I not &s;eek to procure love, till I have it already? There are means al&s;o for the increa&s;ing of love where it is be|gun, and means for exciting it where it lieth dull; and mu&s;t I not u&s;e the&s;e means, till it is increa&s;ed and excited? Fall upon the work, till thou art con&s;train|ed to love; and then love will con&s;train thee to fur|ther duty.</P>
<P N="3">3. As thy heart will be loitering, &s;o will it be di|verting. It will be turning a&s;ide like a carele&s;s &s;er|vant, to talk with every one that pa&s;&s;eth by: when there &s;hould be nothing in thy mind, but the work in hand; it will be thinking of thy calling, or of thy afflictions, or of every bird, or tree, or place thou &s;ec&s;t, or of any impertinency, rather than of heaven. The cure here is the &s;ame with that before; to u&s;e watch|fulne&s;s and violence with your own imaginations, and as &s;oon as they &s;tep out, to chide them in. Drive away the&s;e birds of prey from thy &s;acrifice, and &s;trict|ly keep thy heart to the work thou art upon.</P>
<P N="4">4. La&s;tly, Be &s;ure al&s;o to look to thy heart in this, that it cut not off the work before the time, and run not away through wearine&s;s, before it have leave. Thou &s;halt find it exceeding prone to this. Thou may&s;t ea&s;ily perceive it in other duties: if in &s;ecret thou &s;et thy&s;elf to pray, is not thy heart urging thee
<PB N="373" REF="022331_0372_0FB7EEB9DD5B32A0">&s;till to cut it &s;hort? Do&s;t thou not frequently find a motion to have done? Art thou not ready to be up, as &s;oon almo&s;t as thou art down on thy knees? So it will be al&s;o in thy contemplations of heaven; as fa&s;t as thou gette&s;t up thy heart, it will be down again; it will be weary of the work; it will be minding thee of other bu&s;ine&s;s to be done, and &s;top thy hea|venly walk, before thou art well warm. What is to be done in this ca&s;e al&s;o? Why the &s;ame authority and re&s;olution which brought it to the work, and ob&s;erved it in the work, mu&s;t hold it to it, till the work be done. Stick to the work till thy graces be acted, thy affections rai&s;ed, and thy &s;oul refre&s;hed with the delights above; or if thou can&s;t not obtain the&s;e ends at once, ply it the clo&s;er the next time, and let it not go till thou feel the ble&s;&s;ing. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is that &s;ervant, whom his Lord, when he comes, &s;hall find &s;o doing.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have directed you in this work of heavenly contemplation, and led you into the path where you may walk with GOD. But becau&s;e I would bring it down to the capacity of the meane&s;t, and help their memories who are apt to let &s;lip the former particu|lars, I &s;hall he e contract the whole, and lay it before you in a narrower compa&s;s. But &s;till I wi&s;h thee to remember, it is the practice of a duty that I am di|recting thee in, and therefore if thou wilt not prac|ti&s;e it, do not read it.</P>
<P>The &s;um is this, as thou make&s;t con&s;cience of pray|ing daily, &s;o do thou of meditation; and more e&s;pe|cially on the joys of heaven. To this end, &s;et apart one hour or half hour every day, wherein thou may&s;t lay a&s;ide all worldly thoughts, and with all po&s;&s;ible &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and reverence, as if thou wert to &s;peak with GOD him&s;elf, or to have a &s;ight of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or of that ble&s;&s;ed place; &s;o withdraw thy&s;elf into &s;ome
<PB N="374" REF="022331_0373_0FB7EEBC1F5024D0">&s;ecret place, and &s;et thy&s;elf wholly to the following work: if thou can&s;t, take <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s time and place, who <HI>went forth into the field in the evening to meditate:</HI> but if thou be a &s;ervant or poor man that cannot have that lei&s;ure, take the fitte&s;t time and place that thou can&s;t, though it be when thou art private about thy labours.</P>
<P>When thou &s;ette&s;t to the work <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ok up toward heaven, let thine eye lead thee as near as it can; re|member that there is thine everla&s;ting re&s;t; &s;tudy its excellency, &s;tudy its reality, till thy unbelief be &s;i|lenced, and thy faith prevail: if thy judgment be not yet drawn to admiration, u&s;e tho&s;e &s;en&s;ible helps and advantages which were even now laid down. Compare thy heavenly joys with the choice&s;t on earth, and &s;o ri&s;e up from &s;en&s;e to faith; if this mere con|&s;ideration prevail not, then plead the ca&s;e with thy hearts preach upon this text of heaven to thy&s;elf; convince, inform, confute, in&s;truct, reprove, examine, admoni&s;h, encourage, and comfort thy own &s;oul from this cele&s;tial doctrine; draw forth tho&s;e &s;everal con|&s;iderations of thy re&s;t, on which thy &s;everal affections may work, e&s;pecially that affection or grace which thou intende&s;t to act. If it be love which thou would&s;t act, &s;hew it the loveline&s;s of heaven, and how &s;uita|ble it is to thy condition: if it be de&s;ire, con&s;ider thy ab&s;ence from this lovely object: if it be hope, con&s;ider the po&s;&s;ibility and probability of obtaining it: if it be courage, con&s;ider the &s;ingular a&s;&s;i&s;tance and encouragements which thou may&s;t receive from GOD, the weakne&s;s of the enemy, and the nece&s;&s;ity of prevailing: if it be joy, con&s;ider its excellent, ra|vi&s;hing glory, thy intere&s;t in it, and its certainty, and the nearne&s;s of the time when thou maye&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s it. Urge the&s;e con&s;iderations home to thy heart; whet them with all po&s;&s;ible &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s upon each af|fection: if thy heart draw back, force it to the work;
<PB N="375" REF="022331_0374_0FB7EEBD9E9C97F8">if it loiter, &s;pur it on; if it &s;tep a&s;ide, command it in again; if it would &s;lip away, and leave the work, u&s;e thine authority; keep it clo&s;e to the bu&s;ine&s;s, till thou ha&s;t obtained thine end; &s;tir not away, if it may be, till thy love flame, till thy joy be rai&s;ed, or till thy de&s;ire or other graces be lively. Call in a&s;&s;i&s;tance al&s;o from GOD, mix ejaculations with thy &s;oliloquies; till having &s;eriou&s;ly pleaded the ca&s;e with thy heart, and reverently pleaded the ca&s;e with GOD, thou ha&s;t pleaded thy&s;elf from a clod to a flame, from a forget|ful &s;inner to a mindful lover: from a lover of the world, to a thir&s;ter after GOD; from a fearful cow|ard, to a re&s;olved chri&s;tian. In a word, what will not be done one day, do it the next, till thou ha&s;t pleaded thy heart from earth to heaven; from con|ver&s;ing below, to a walking with GOD; and till thou can&s;t lay thy heart to re&s;t, as in the bo&s;om of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> in this meditation of thy full and everla&s;ting re&s;t.</P>

The eternal GOD of truth hath given me his pro|mi&s;e, his &s;eal, and his oath to a&s;&s;ure me, that <HI>believing in Chri&s;t I &s;hall not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life:</HI> thither &s;hall my &s;oul be &s;peedily removed and my bo|dy &s;hortly follow.

Ah faith! how do I perceive thy weakne&s;s? ah unbelief! if I had never known it be|fore, how &s;en&s;ibly do I now perceive thy malicious tyranny? But were it not for thee, what abundance might I have? The light of heaven would &s;hine into my heart, and I might be as familiar there as I am on earth.</P>
<P>Come away my &s;oul then, &s;tand not looking on that grave, nor turning tho&s;e bones, not reading thy le&s;&s;on in the du&s;t: tho&s;e lines will &s;oon be wiped out: but lift up thy head and look to heaven, and read thy in&s;tructions in tho&s;e fixed &s;tars: or yet look higher than tho&s;e eyes can &s;ee, into that foundation which &s;tandeth &s;ure, and &s;ee thy name written in the books

<P>What delight have I found in my private &s;tudies, e&s;pecially when they have pro&s;pered to the increa&s;e of knowledge!

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THUS, reader, I have given thee my be&s;t advice for the attaining and maintaining an heavenly conver&s;ation. The manner is imperfect, and too much my own; but for the main matter, I received it from GOD. From him I deliver it thee, and his charge I lay upon thee, that thou entertain and prac|ti&s;e it. If thou can&s;t not do it fully, do it as thou can&s;t; only be &s;ure thou do it &s;eriou&s;ly and frequent|ly. If thou wilt believe a man that hath made &s;ome &s;mall trial of it, thou &s;halt find it will make thee another man, and elevate thy &s;oul, and clear thy un|der&s;tanding, and leave a plea&s;ant &s;avour upon thy heart; &s;o that thy own experience will make thee confe&s;s, that one hour thus &s;pent will more effectually
<PB N="395" REF="022331_0394_0FB7EF0468FC5710">revive thee, than many in bare external duties; and a day in the&s;e contemplations will afford thee truer content, than all the glory and riches of the earth. Be acquainted with this work, and thou wilt be ac|quainted with GOD: thy joys will be &s;piritual and la&s;ting; thou wilt have comfort in life, and comfort in death: when thou ha&s;t neither wealth nor health, nor the plea&s;ures of this world, yet wilt thou have comfort: comfort without the pre&s;ence or help of any friend, without a mini&s;ter, without a book, when all means are denied thee, or taken from thee, yet may&s;t thou have vigorous, real comfort. Thy gra|ces will be active and victorious; and the daily joy which is thus fetched from heaven, will be thy &s;trength: thou wilt be as one that &s;tandeth on the top of an exceeding high mountain; he looks down on the world as if it were quite below him; how &s;mall do the fields, and woods, and countries &s;eem to him? cities and towns &s;eem but little &s;pots. Thus de&s;picably wilt thou look on all things here below: the greate&s;t princes will &s;eem but as gra&s;hoppers, and the bu&s;y, contentious, covetous world, but as heaps of ants. Men's threatenings will be no terror to thee; nor the honours of this world any &s;trong en|ticement; temptations will be harmle&s;s, as having lo&s;t their &s;trength; and afflictions le&s;s grievous, as having lo&s;t their &s;ting; and every mercy will be better known and reli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Reader, it is (under GOD) in thy own choice now, whether thou wilt live this ble&s;&s;ed life or not; and whether all this pains which I have taken for thee, &s;mall pro&s;per or be lo&s;t. If it be lo&s;t through thy la|zine&s;s. (which GOD forbid) thou wilt prove the great|e&s;t lo&s;er thy&s;elf.</P>
<P>O man, what ha&s;t thou to mind, but GOD and heaven? art thou not almo&s;t out of this world alrea|dy?
<PB N="396" REF="022331_0395_0FB7EF0633EE7AB8">do&s;t thou not look every day, when one di&s;ea&s;e or other will let out thy &s;oul? doth not the bier &s;tand ready to carry thee to the grave? and the worms wait to feed upon thy face and heart? what if thy pul&s;e mu&s;t beat a few &s;trokes more? and what if thou ha&s;t a &s;ew more breaths to fetch, before thou breathe thy la&s;t? and what if thou ha&s;t a few more nights to &s;leep, before thou &s;leep in the du&s;t? Alas, what will this be, when it is gone? and is it not almo&s;t gone alrea|dy? Shortly thou wilt &s;ee thy gla&s;s run out, and &s;ay thy&s;elf, my life is done! my time is gone! there is nothing now, but heaven or hell: where then &s;hould thy heart be now, but in heaven? Did&s;t thou but know what a dreadful thing it is to have a doubt of heaven, when a man lies dying, it would rou&s;e thee up.</P>
<P>O what a life might men live, if they were but willing and diligent! GOD would have our joys to be far more than our &s;orrows; yea, he would have us to have no &s;orrow, but what tendeth to joy: and no more than our &s;ins have made nece&s;&s;ary for our good. How much do tho&s;e chri&s;tians wrong GOD and them|&s;elves, that either make their thoughts of GOD the inlet of their &s;orrows, or let the&s;e offered joys He by, as neglected or forgotten! Some there be that &s;ay, it is not worth to much time and trouble, to think of the greatne&s;s of the joys above. But as the&s;e men obey not the command of GOD, which requireth them to have their affections on things above; &s;o do they wil|fully make their own lives mi&s;erable, by refu&s;ing the delights that GOD hath &s;et before them. And yet if this were all, it were a &s;maller matter; if it were but lo&s;s of their comforts, I would not &s;ay much: but &s;ee what abundance of other mi&s;chiefs follow the ab&s;ence of the&s;e heavenly delights.</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="022331_0321_0FB7EE0D0B78DBF0">
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It will damp, if not de&s;troy, our very love to GOD: &s;o deeply as we apprehend his exceeding love to us, and his purpo&s;e to make us eternally hap|py, &s;o much will it rai&s;e our love: love to GOD and delight in him, are &s;till conjunct. They that conceive of GOD as one that de&s;ireth their blood and damna|tion, cannot heartily love him.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It will make us have rare and unplea&s;ing thoughts of GOD; for our thoughts will follow our love and delight. Did we more delight in GOD than in any thing below, our thoughts would as freely run after him, as they now run from him.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> And it will make men have as rare and unplea&s;ing &s;peech of GOD; for who will care for talking of that which he hath no delight in? What makes men &s;till talking of worldline&s;s or wickedne&s;s, but that the&s;e are more plea&s;ant to them than GOD?</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Men will have no delight in the &s;ervice of GOD, when they have no delight in GOD, nor any &s;weet thoughts of heaven, which is the end of their &s;ervices. No wonder if &s;uch chri&s;tians com|plain, that they are &s;till backward to duty; that they have no delight in prayer, in &s;acraments, or in &s;crip|ture it&s;elf: if thou could&s;t once delight in GOD, thou would&s;t ea&s;ily delight in duty; e&s;pecially that which bringeth thee into the neare&s;t conver&s;e with him; but till then, no wonder if thou be weary of all.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> This want of heavenly delight will leave men under the power of every affliction; they will have nothing to comfort them, and ea&s;e them in their &s;ufferings, but the empty, ineffectual plea&s;ures of the fle&s;h; and when that is gone, where then is their de|light?</P>
<P><PB N="398" REF="022331_0397_0FB7EF13CC812FE8">
<HI>Sixthly,</HI> It will make them fearful and unwilling to die: for who would go to a GOD, or a place that he hath no delight in? Or who would leave his plea|&s;ure here, except it were to go to better? But if men take delight in GOD whil&s;t they live, they will not tremble at the tidings of death.</P>
<P>If GOD would per&s;uade you now to make con|&s;cience of this duty, and help you in it by the ble&s;|&s;ed influence of his Spirit, you would not change your lives with the greate&s;t prince on earth. But I am afraid, if I may judge of your hearts by the back|wardne&s;s of my own, that it will prove a hard thing to per&s;uade you to the work. Pardon my jealou&s;y; it is rai&s;ed upon too many and &s;ad experiments. What &s;ay you? Do you re&s;olve on this heavenly cour&s;e or no? Will you let go all your &s;inful plea&s;ures, and daily &s;eek the&s;e higher delights? I pray thee, reader, con&s;ider of it, and re&s;olve on the work before thou goe&s;t further. Let thy family perceive, let thy neighbours perceive, let thy con&s;cience perceive, yea, let GOD perceive it, that thou art a man that ha&s;t thy conver&s;ation in heaven. GOD hath now offered to be thy daily delight; thy neglect is thy refu&s;al. Take heed what thou do&s;t: refu&s;e this, and refu&s;e all: thou mu&s;t have heavenly delights, or none that are la&s;ting. GOD is willing thou &s;hould&s;t daily walk with him, and fetch in con&s;olation from the everla&s;t|ing fountain: if thou be unwilling, bear the lo&s;s; and when thou lie&s;t dying, then &s;eek for comfort where thou can&s;t. O how is the un&s;een GOD neglect|ed, and the un&s;een glory forgotten! and all for want of that <HI>faith which is the &s;ub&s;tance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things that are not &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en.</HI></P>
<P>But for you who&s;e hearts GOD hath weaned from all things here below, I hope you will fetch one walk daily in the new <HI>Jeru&s;alem!</HI> GOD is your love, and
<PB N="399" REF="022331_0398_0FB7EF17156445C8">your de&s;ire; and I know you would fain be more ac|quainted with your Saviour, and I know it is your grief that your hearts are not more near him; and that they do no more pa&s;&s;ionately love and delight in him. As ever you would enjoy your de&s;ires, try this life of meditation on your everla&s;ting re&s;t.</P>
<P>O thou, the merciful Father of &s;pirits, the attractive of love, and ocean of delights, draw up the&s;e dro&s;&s;y hearts unto thy&s;elf, and keep them there till they are &s;piritualized and refined, and &s;econd the&s;e thy &s;ervant's weak endeavours, and per&s;uade tho&s;e that read the&s;e lines, to the practice of this delightful, heavenly work. O &s;uffer not the &s;oul of thy mo&s;t unworthy &s;ervant to be a &s;tranger to tho&s;e joys which he unfoldeth to thy people, or to be &s;eldom in that way which he hath mark|ed out to others; but O keep me while I tarry on this earth, in daily, &s;erious breathings after thee, and in a believing, affectionate walking with thee; and when thou come&s;t, O let me be found &s;o doing, not hiding my talent, nor &s;erving my fle&s;h, nor yet a&s;leep with my lamp unfurni&s;hed, but waiting and longing for my LORD'S return: that tho&s;e who &s;hall read the&s;e direc|tions, may not reap only the fruit of my &s;tudies, but the breathings of my active hope and love: that if my heart were open to their view, they might there read the &s;ame mo&s;t deeply engraven with a beam from the face of the Son of GOD; and not find vanity or lu&s;t, or pride within, where the words of life appear without; that &s;o the&s;e lines may not witne&s;s again&s;t me; but proceeding from the heart of the writer, may be effectual through thy grace upon the heart of the reader, and &s;o be the &s;avour of life to both.</P>
<P>GLORY <HI>be to</HI> GOD <HI>in the highe&s;t: on earth peace: good-will towards men.</HI></P>
