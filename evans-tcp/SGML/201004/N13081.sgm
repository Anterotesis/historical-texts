<P>"THAT man was born to delude and be deluded; to believe whatever is taught, and bear what&s;oever is impo&s;ed;" are political dogmas which have long af|forded matter for exultation and &s;ecurity to dignified villains, from the powergra&s;ping monarch, to the lowe&s;t minion of office. But however ju&s;tified they may have been, and now are, by the pa&s;&s;ive conduct of the greate&s;t part of mankind, you, my fellow-citizens, thank God, you are an exception to their truth. The numerous, the re&s;pectable a&s;&s;embly which now croud this hallowed temple, prove you an exalted exception to maxims as di&s;|graceful as they are general. Ever vigilantly attentive to the &s;acred, unalienable rights of man; equally &s;tudious in the glorious princi|ples

<P>SIMILAR cau&s;es will forever operate like effects in the political and moral, as well as in the phy&s;ical world: Tho&s;e vices which ruined the illu&s;trious republics of Greece, and the mighty common
<PB N="7" REF="016550_0006_0F9C905B578E3A48">wealth of Rome; which are now with rapid progre&s;&s;ion ruining Great-Britain, &s;o late the fir&s;t Kingdom of Europe, mu&s;t eventually ruin every State, where their deleterious influence is &s;uffered to pre|vail. Need I add that luxury, corruption, and &s;tanding armies are tho&s;e de&s;tructive efficients?</P>
<P>LUXURY, that &s;yren luxury, who&s;e treacherous &s;ong ever charms her deluded votaries to de&s;truction, or to infamy, no &s;ooner finds admittance into a State than &s;he becomes the parent of innumerable evils, public and dome&s;tic; her contagious influence is &s;oon felt in &s;ociety, her baneful effects di&s;covered by a general di&s;&s;ipation of manners and a declen&s;ion of private virtue, which begets effeminate habits, and by a natural gradation a ba&s;e pliability of &s;pirit.</P>
<P>LUXURY is ever the foe of independance, for at the &s;ame time that it creates

It fir&s;t un&s;its men for patriotic energies, and &s;oon teaches them to con&s;ider <HI>public virtue as a public je&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>AT &s;uch a period, corruption finds an ea&s;y acce&s;s to men's hearts. To the promotion of intere&s;ted pur&s;uits, and the gratification of voluptuous wi&s;hes, a ready &s;acrifice is made of the general good at the &s;hrine of power. Then &s;lumbers that virtuous jealou&s;y of public men and public mea&s;ures, which was wont to &s;crutinize not
<PB N="8" REF="016550_0007_0F9C905EB5A94248">only actions but motives: Then nods that active zeal, which, with eagle-eye watched, and with nervous arm defended the con&s;titution. Every day new inroads are made upon public liberty, while in|croachments like temptations, grow more frequent and more dange|rous in proportion as the power of re&s;i&s;tance decrea&s;es. Thus before a nation is completely deprived of freedom, &s;he mu&s;t be fitted for &s;lavery by her vices.</P>
<P>GENERALLY, but not always, for we have known a people ruled by a de&s;pot, who from a private &s;tation ro&s;e to uncontroled dominion, at a time when they were &s;ternly virtuous. And this mode of introducing bondage is ever to be apprehended at the clo&s;e of a &s;ucce&s;sful &s;truggle for liberty, when a triumphant army, elated with victories, and headed by a popular General, may become more formidable than the tyrant that has been expelled. Witne&s;s the la&s;t century in the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory. Witne&s;s the a&s;piring CROMWELL!</P>

With the&s;e mercenary a&s;&s;ociates at his heels, he appeared in the Synod of the State, and dared with force, di&s;place the mo&s;t glorious band of patriots that ever led a tyrant from his throne to a &s;caffold. Not content with this enormous outrage upon the con|&s;titution, this annihilating &s;troke upon the tottering liberties of his country, for a time to keep up the form of a popular goverment, he convened an Hou&s;e of Commons, con&s;tituted entirely of his own creatures. They met, and in a few months di&s;covered that they were utterly unequal to the po&s;ts they were rai&s;ed to, they therefore petitioned their ma&s;ter to di&s;&s;olve them. Cromwell granted their reque&s;t&mdash;and became &s;ole tyrant of three kingdoms.&mdash;Tyrant&mdash;for of what con&s;equence is it by what &s;tyle or under what modification de&s;poti&s;m operates to the public mi&s;ery&mdash;Dictator, King, Protec|tor,&mdash;it is not the appellation we reprobate, though even that we &s;hould guard again&s;t&mdash;but the thing.

<HEAD>The King of Sweeden's &s;peech to the States on the 1&s;t of June, 1772.</HEAD>
<P>You are this day a&s;&s;embled, in order to confirm in the manner of your ance&s;tors, the band of union which ties you to me, and me to you, and both to the whole com|monwealth; we mu&s;t therefore remember, with the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible gratitude, the benevolence of the almighty, who has order'd things &s;o, that this very ancient kingdom of the Sweeds and Goths is &s;till exi&s;ting, after &s;o many foreign, as well as national &s;hocks, and that I, in the throne of my ance&s;tors, can yet addre&s;s free and independent States.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;ured of your hearts, mo&s;t &s;incerely propo&s;ing to merit them, and to fix my throne upon your love and felicity, the public engagement which you are going to enter into, would, in my opinion, be needle&s;s, if ancient cu&s;tom and the law of Swee|den did not require it of you. Unhappy the King who wants the tie of oaths to &s;ecure him&s;elf on the throne, and who, not a&s;&s;ured of the hearts of his &s;ubjects, is con&s;train'd to reign only by the force of laws, when he cannot by the love of his &s;ubjects!</P>
<P>I need not put you in mind of the weightine&s;s of the engagement you are going to take; the States of Sweeden know be&s;t the extent of their duty to them&s;elves and the commonwealth; may concord and harmony ever unite your hearts; may foreign views and private gain ever be &s;acrificed to public intere&s;t; may this a|lone be a perpetual bond of union among&s;t you; and may the ambition of any part of you, never rai&s;e any &s;uch di&s;turbances as may endanger the freedom and independency of the whole commonwealth!</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Nobles,</P>
<P>Pre&s;erve always the honour and intrepidity of your ance&s;tors; be an example to your fellow-citizens; and, as you are the fir&s;t order of the kingdom, be al&s;o the fir&s;t in virtue and love of your country.</P>
<P>Good Men of the Reverend Order of Clergy,</P>
<P>May mutual friend&s;hip and peace, obedience to the laws, reverence to God and the King, bear witne&s;s to me and the country, of your zeal in the execution of the &s;acred office with which you are intru&s;ted!</P>
<P>Good Men of the re&s;pectable Order of Burghers,</P>
<P>Strive always with your fellow &s;ubjects who &s;hall contribute the mo&s;t to the pub|lic good; may the fruits of the exten&s;ive &s;hare which belongs to you, be general credit and confidence, u&s;eful in&s;titutions, frugal living, and moderate gain, which lead to &s;ure and certain wealth!</P>
<P>Good Men of the worthy Order of Pea&s;ants,</P>
<P>May piety, diligence, temperance, and old Sweedi&s;h faith and mode&s;ty, be the &s;tronge&s;t confirmation of the honour always due to that order which gives &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance to all the others; an honour which the Sweedi&s;h pea&s;ants have at all times attain'd.</P>
<P>This is all I a&s;k of you, when you ob&s;erve this, you perform in the be&s;t manner, that duty to me and your country, which according to the Sweedi&s;h laws, I now call upon you to confirm by oath.</P>
