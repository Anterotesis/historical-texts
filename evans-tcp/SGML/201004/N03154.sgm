<P>YOU are now met here for the Service of this City and County, and in order that you may be better enabled to perform this Service, and di&s;charge the Duty inc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">bent on you, I &s;hall &s;ay &s;omething to you of the Oath you have taken, to declare the Nature of it, and what is required thereby, at your hands, and then I &s;hall proceed to mention and explain to you &s;ome of the Offences that are to be the &s;ubject of your Enquiries.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003812_0002_10025F78D9282B98">Before I enter into the Particulars of your Oath, it may not, I think, be improper to &s;ay &s;omething, in the fir&s;t place, of the Nature of <HI>Oath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> in general.</P>
<P>An <HI>Oath</HI> then is a Religious A&s;&s;everation, by which we either Re|nounce the Mercy, or imprecate the Vengeance of Heaven, if we &s;peak not the Truth. This appears from the form of words in which it is expre&s;&s;ed, to wit, <HI>So help you God.</HI> This is look'd upon as the mo&s;t Sacred Tye, the &s;tronge&s;t Band on Mens Minds, the &s;ure&s;t and be&s;t means to find out and di&s;cover the Truth; for it is not to be imagined, though &s;ome few may po&s;&s;ibly be found &s;o hardned in &s;in, that Men in general will be &s;o daring as to appeal to the GOD of Infinite Knowledge and Power, for the Truth of what they &s;ay, and yet Corruptly and Will|fully Perjure them&s;elves. Gods Infinite Knowledge mu&s;t di&s;cern the Crime, and by his Power he will certainly puni&s;h the Breach o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his expre&s;s Command which he has given, <HI>Ye &s;hall not Swear Fal&s;ly by my Name, Neither shalt thou Profane the Name of thy God,</HI>&mdash;He that Sweareth unto his Neighbour, and di&s;appointeth him not, though it were to his own Hindrance, is part of the Character of a <HI>Ju&s;t Man, and one who should dwell in the Tabernacle of the Lord,</HI> &mdash; Even the Heathens have abhorred <HI>Perjury</HI> as an Odious Crime, looking on it as the greate&s;t Impiety towards their Gods, and a Di&s;&s;olution of the &s;tronge&s;t Band of Human Society, of which many In&s;tances might be given; but I rather chu&s;e to exhort you to your <HI>Duty</HI> by Motives drawn <HI>from the Precepts of the Law of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>NOW, as to your <HI>OATH,</HI> the fir&s;t Things required in it, are <HI>Diligence</HI> in your <HI>Enquiries,</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> in your <HI>Pre&s;entments. You shall Diligently Enquire, and True Pre&s;entment make. Diligence</HI> is to &s;pur you on in finding out <HI>Offenders,</HI> that their <HI>Crimes</HI> may be <HI>Detected,</HI> and that they may be brought to <HI>Condign Punishment,</HI> according to their Demerits, and <HI>Truth</HI> is to be your <HI>Guide,</HI> the <HI>Compa&s;s</HI> you are to &s;teer by, that the <HI>Innocent</HI> be not called into <HI>Judgment,</HI> and that the <HI>Guilty</HI> e&s;cape Not.</P>
<P>AND this <HI>Enquiry</HI> is to be of all &s;uch Matters as &s;hall be given you in <HI>Charge,</HI> or &s;hall come to your <HI>Knowledge;</HI> for as you are cho&s;en from the different Parts of this City, it is to be pre&s;umed, that you mu&s;t have heard of mo&s;t Things which happen within it.</P>
<P>NEXT follows, <HI>The King's Coun&s;el, your Fellows and your Own, you &s;hall keep Secret.</HI> By the <HI>King's Coun&s;el</HI> is to be under&s;tood the <HI>Evidence</HI> of the <HI>Witne&s;&s;es</HI> who are brought before you, which ought not to be di&s;clo&s;ed by any of you, but is to be kept Secret, and concealed from the Party concerned, and all others. For, tho' po&s;&s;ibly at this time there may not be &s;ufficient Evidence again&s;t an <HI>Offender,</HI> yet upon a farther Enquiry and Examination, a &s;ucceeding <HI>Grand Jury</HI> may find Matter enough again&s;t him to ground an <HI>Indictment</HI> on; and therefore the Par|ticulars ought to be kept Secret, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t the Di&s;covery prove an Occa&s;ion of the <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> e&s;caping.</HI> As you are to keep the <HI>King's Coun&s;el,</HI> &s;o are you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ellows</HI> and <HI>your Own to keep Secret.</HI> You are Not to

Reveal, for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons, what has been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> or Advi&s;ed among <HI>your Selves;</HI> for be&s;ides the <HI>Obligation</HI> of your <HI>Oath,</HI> it is an <HI>Offence</HI> puni&s;hable by <HI>Fine</HI> and <HI>Impri&s;onment,</HI> for any of the <HI>Grand Jury</HI> to di&s;clo&s;e the <HI>Per&s;ons Indicted,</HI> or the <HI>Evidence again&s;t them.</HI></P>
<P>THE Next thing con&s;iderable in your <HI>Oath</HI> is, <HI>The Temper of Mind you ought to bear in all your Enquiries.</HI> You are not to &s;uffer <HI>Malice</HI> or <HI>Ill-Will</HI> &s;o far to prevail with you, as, without ju&s;t Cau&s;e, to <HI>Pre&s;ent</HI> an <HI>Innocent Per&s;on,</HI> neither ought <HI>Love, Fear, Favour, Affection, Reward</HI> or <HI>Hopes</HI> thereof, &s;way you to leave any thing <HI>Unpre&s;ented;</HI> for your <HI>Oath</HI> ought to out-weigh any Con&s;iderations: And you ought to <HI>Pre&s;ent</HI> things Truly, as they come to your Knowledge. <HI>Truth</HI> is the <HI>Rule</HI> you are to walk by, and is the mo&s;t E&s;&s;ential part of your <HI>Duty,</HI> and if of &s;o much Con&s;ideration in the Service to which you are now cho&s;en, that it forms the Beginning and Conclu&s;ion of the Oath you have taken. And all this that is required of you, is to be performed accor|ding to the be&s;t of your <HI>Skill</HI> and <HI>Knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>Now as &s;ome general Notion of what the Law declares to be <HI>Offences,</HI> is requi&s;ite to this End, it is the Office of Us who &s;it here, to a&s;&s;i&s;t and direct you. And this leads me to mention &s;ome Particulars.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen;</HI></P>
<P>We commonly divide <HI>Offences</HI> as they relate to the Per&s;ons again&s;t whom they are committed; and they are &s;aid to be either again&s;t the <HI>Supreme Being, GOD,</HI> or again&s;t <HI>MAN.</HI> As to Offences again&s;t <HI>God,</HI> they may be con&s;idered under <HI>Two Heads.</HI> They are either &s;uch as, although in them&s;elves they are <HI>Crimes</HI> of the <HI>deepe&s;t Dye,</HI> yet as they have not &s;o direct a tendency, as &s;ome others, to <HI>Subvert Civil Society,</HI> our Laws have not provided Puni&s;hments &s;uitable to them, but they are left to that <HI>Tribunal</HI> at which they are mo&s;t properly Cognizable, and to that <HI>Judge</HI> to whom <HI>Vengeance</HI> belongeth. Or, <HI>Secondly,</HI> They are &s;uch as at the &s;ame time that they are <HI>high Offences</HI> again&s;t <HI>God</HI> have al&s;o an immediate and manife&s;t tendency to <HI>Overthrow the Peace</HI> and <HI>De&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> the Well-being of every Community.</HI> The latter <HI>(Gentlemen)</HI> are the <HI>Object of Human Laws;</HI> Not that the&s;e can add any weight or Authority to the <HI>Divine Law,</HI> but becau&s;e <HI>Temporal Punishments</HI> being nearer in view, are apt to work more &s;trongly on weak and incon&s;iderate Minds than the di&s;tant, though far <HI>greater Punishments of another Life.</HI> Under this Head I think it not improper to place <HI>Perjury,</HI> or <HI>Breach of Oath,</HI> which I touched before. This is a <HI>Crime</HI> of a <HI>mo&s;t Odious</HI> and <HI>Dete&s;table Nature;</HI> it is the <HI>highe&s;t Indignity</HI> and <HI>Affront to God,</HI> and it <HI>loo&s;ens</HI> and <HI>di&s;&s;olves</HI> the <HI>Bands of Society;</HI> for if Men lay a&s;ide all re&s;pect to the <HI>Obligation of an Oath,</HI> there mu&s;t be an end of all <HI>Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of Judi|cature:</HI> We have no other Mean to judge of <HI>Right</HI> or <HI>Wrong, Truth</HI> or <HI>Falshood;</HI> nor any Security left for our <HI>Lives, Liberties</HI> and <HI>Properties;</HI> All mu&s;t run into Confu&s;ion, when the <HI>Reverence</HI> for this <HI>Solemn Appeal</HI> to <HI>Almighty God</HI> is once <HI>extinguished</HI> in Mens Minds. This cannot be too often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nculcated, and requires your utmo&s;t Diligence.</P>

<P><HI>Ar&s;on</HI> is another <HI>Felony</HI> again&s;t the Habitation of a Man. If any do voluntarily and maliciou&s;ly burn the Dwelling-hou&s;e of another, this is called <HI>Ar&s;on,</HI> and is <HI>Felony.</HI> One <HI>Maliciou&s;ly burns</HI> his own Hou&s;e to the intent to burn another's, if his own be only burnt, then it is a <HI>high Mi&s;de|meanor;</HI> if the others al&s;o, then it is <HI>Felony.</HI></P>
<P>The next <HI>Felony</HI> I &s;hall mention, is <HI>Robbery,</HI> which is a <HI>Violent</HI> and <HI>Fe|lonious</HI> taking away from the Per&s;on of another, Money or Goods, to any Value, <HI>putting him in fear.</HI> If a Thief, with or without a Weapon drawn, bid me deliver my Pur&s;e, and I do it, it is a Taking &s;ufficient to make it a <HI>Rob|bery.</HI> If a man &s;eeking to make his e&s;cape, ca&s;t his Pur&s;e into a Bu&s;h, or let his Hat fall off, the Thief takes them up, it is <HI>Robbery.</HI> Taking in the Pre&s;ence of the Party, is, in Law, a Taking from the Per&s;on. If &s;everal come in Company together to Rob, the one only actually does it, and the others are at &s;ome di&s;tance, yet all are guilty of the Robbery.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Felonies</HI> that I have mentioned, are called <HI>Mix'd Larcenies. Simple Larceny</HI> is the <HI>Felonious</HI> and <HI>Fraudulent</HI> taking away by any Per&s;on, of the the meer Per&s;onal Goods of another, not from his Per&s;on, nor out of his Hou&s;e; if this be above the Value of <HI>Twelve Pence,</HI> it is <HI>grand Larceny,</HI> if under, <HI>petty Larceny,</HI> for which the <HI>offender</HI> &s;hall be <HI>whipt.</HI> If two &s;teal G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ds to the Value of <HI>Thirteen Pence,</HI> this is <HI>grand Larceny</HI> in both. If one Per&s;on at &s;everal times, at one time &s;teals <HI>four Pence,</HI> at another <HI>&s;ix Pence,</HI> at ano|ther <HI>three Pence,</HI> from one Per&s;on, in all amounting to above <HI>twelve pence,</HI> it is &s;aid, all the&s;e put together in one Indictment, amount to <HI>grand Larceny,</HI> and Judgment of <HI>Death</HI> mu&s;t be given, unle&s;s in ca&s;es where Clergy is not taken away.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the&s;e Offences that I have mentioned are <HI>Capital.</HI> I &s;hall only take Notice of one or two which are not Capital, and then di&s;mi&s;s you

And <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> of Offences which amount to an actual <HI>Breach of the Peace,</HI> they any of two kinds, 1&s;t, Such as may be commited by one or two Per&s;ons. 2dly, Such as require a greater Number.

to be the better Opinion, That he who fir&s;t writes a <HI>Libel,</HI> dictated by another, is thereby guilty of making it, and con&s;equently puni&s;hable for the bare Writing; for it was no <HI>Libel</HI> till it was reduced to Writing.</Q></P>

<P>You mu&s;t have heard of two <HI>Scandalous Songs</HI> that are handed about, it is your Duty to enquire the Author, Printer and Publi&s;her of them.
