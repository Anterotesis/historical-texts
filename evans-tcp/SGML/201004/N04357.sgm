<HEAD>AN ESSAY on <HI>COMETS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>'TIS an admirable Work of our GOD, that the many <HI>Globes</HI> in the Univer&s;e are placed at &s;uch Di&s;tances, as to avoid all violent Shocks upon one another, and every thing wherein they might prove a prejudice to one another.</P>
<P>Even <HI>Comets</HI> too, move &s;o as to &s;erve the Holy Ends of their Creator! COMETS, which are commonly called <HI>Blazing Stars,</HI> ap|pear unto later Ob&s;ervations to be a &s;ort of <HI>Excentrical Planets,</HI> that move periodically about the <HI>Sun.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> from whom 'tis a difficult thing to di&s;&s;ent in any thing that belongs to <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> concludes, that the Bodies of <HI>Comets</HI> are &s;olid compact, fixed, and durable even like tho&s;e of the other <HI>Planets.</HI></P>
<P>He has a very critical Thought upon the <HI>Heat,</HI> which the&s;e <HI>Bodies</HI> may &s;uffer in their Tran&s;its near the <HI>Sun.</HI> A famous one, in the Year 1680, pa&s;&s;ed &s;o near the <HI>Sun,</HI> that the <HI>Heat</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> in it mu&s;t be twenty-eight thou&s;and time as inten&s;e as it is in <HI>England</HI> at Mid&s;ummer; where|as the Heat of boiling Water, as he tried, is but little more than the dry Earth of that I&s;land, expo&s;ed unto the Mid&s;ummer-Sun: and the <HI>Heat</HI> of <HI>red-hot Iron</HI> he takes to be three or four times as great as that of <HI>boil|ing Water.</HI> Wherefore the <HI>Heat</HI> of that <HI>Comet</HI> in its <HI>Perihelion</HI> was near two thou&s;and times as great as that of <HI>red-hot Iron.</HI> If it had been an Aggregate of nothing but Exhalations, the <HI>Sun</HI> would have render'd it invi&s;ible. A Globe of <HI>red-hot Iron,</HI> of the Dimen&s;ions of our Earth, would &s;carce be cool, by his Computation, in <HI>Fifty Thou&s;and Years.</HI> If then this <HI>Comet</HI> cooled an hundred times as fa&s;t as <HI>red-hot Iron,</HI> yet, &s;ince his Heat was <HI>Two Thou&s;and</HI> times greater than that of <HI>red-hot Iron,</HI> if you &s;uppo&s;e his Body no greater than that of this Earth, he will not be cool in a Million of Years.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="005389_0003_10182BE868A65B58">
The <HI>Tails</HI> of <HI>Comets,</HI> which are longe&s;t and large&s;t ju&s;t after their <HI>Pe|rihelions,</HI> he takes to be a long and very thin Smoke, or a mighty Train of Vapours, which the ignited <HI>Nucleus,</HI> or the Head of the <HI>Comet,</HI> emits from it. And he ea&s;ily and thoroughly confounds the &s;illy Notion of their being only the <HI>Beams of the Sun,</HI> &s;hining thro' the Head of the <HI>Star.</HI></P>
<P>The Phaenomena of the <HI>Tails of Comets</HI> depend upon the Motion of their <HI>Heads,</HI> and have their Matter &s;upplied from thence.</P>
<P>There may ari&s;e from the Atmo&s;phere of <HI>Comets,</HI> Vapours enough to take up &s;uch immen&s;e Spaces as we &s;ee they do. Computations made of and from the Rarity of our <HI>Air,</HI> which by and by i&s;&s;ue in A&s;toni&s;hments, will render this Matter evident.</P>
<P>That the Tails of <HI>Comets</HI> are extremely rare, is apparent from this; the <HI>Fixed Stars</HI> appearing &s;o plainly thro' them.</P>
<P>The Atmo&s;phere of <HI>Comets,</HI> as they de&s;cend towards the <HI>Sun,</HI> is very &s;en&s;ibly dimini&s;hed by their va&s;t running out, that they may afford Mat|ter to produce the <HI>Blaze. Hevelius</HI> has ob&s;erved, that their Atmo&s;phere is enlarged, when they do not &s;o much run out into <HI>Tail.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> has an Apprehen&s;ion, which is a little &s;urprizing, That tho&s;e Vapours which are dilated, and go off in the <HI>Blazes</HI> of <HI>Comets,</HI> and are diffu&s;ed thro' all the Cele&s;tial Regions, may by little and little, by their own proper <HI>Gravity,</HI> be attracted into the <HI>Planets,</HI> and become intermin|gled with their Atmo&s;pheres. As to the Con&s;titution of &s;uch an <HI>Earth</HI> as ours, it is nece&s;&s;ary there &s;hould be <HI>Seas;</HI> thus, for the Con&s;ervation of the <HI>Seas,</HI> and Moi&s;ture of the Planets, there may be a nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Comets,</HI> from who&s;e conden&s;ed Vapours, all that <HI>Moi&s;ture,</HI> which is con&s;umed in Vegetations and Putrefactions, and &s;o turned into dry Earth, may by de|grees be continually &s;upplied, repaired, and recruited. Yea, he has a &s;u&s;|picion, that the Spirit, which is the fine&s;t, the mo&s;t &s;ubtle, and the very be&s;t part of our <HI>Air,</HI> and which is nece&s;&s;arily requi&s;ite unto the Life and Being of all Things, comes chiefly from <HI>Comets.</HI> If this be &s;o, the Ap|pearance of <HI>Comets</HI> is not &s;o dreadful a thing, as the <HI>Cometomantia,</HI> gene|rally prevailing, has repre&s;ented it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> will thus far allow bad Pre&s;ages to <HI>Comets,</HI> That if the Tail of a <HI>Comet</HI> &s;hould be too much intermingled with our <HI>Atmo&s;phere,</HI> or if the Matter of it &s;hould, by its <HI>Gravity,</HI> fall down upon the Earth; it may induce tho&s;e Changes in in our <HI>Air,</HI> whereof we &s;hould be very &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P><HI>Bernoulli,</HI> in his <HI>Sy&s;tema Cometarum,</HI> &s;uppo&s;es, That there is a <HI>Primary Planet,</HI> revolving round the <HI>Sun</HI> in the &s;pace of four Years and 157 Days; and at the Di&s;tance of 2,583 Semidiameters of the <HI>Or|bis Magnus.</HI> This <HI>Primary Planet,</HI> he &s;uppo&s;es, either from his mighty
<PB N="4" REF="005389_0004_10182BEAF0AAFC00"><HI>Di&s;tance,</HI> or his minute <HI>Smallne&s;s,</HI> to be not vi&s;ible unto us; to have &s;everal <HI>Satellits</HI> moving round him, tho' none de&s;cending &s;o low as the Orbit of <HI>Saturn;</HI> and that the&s;e becoming vi&s;ible to us, when in their <HI>Perigaeon,</HI> are what we call <HI>Comets.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Seneca</HI>'s Prediction, That a Time &s;hould come, when our My&s;teries of <HI>Comets</HI> &s;hould be unfolded, &s;eems almo&s;t accompli&s;hed. However <HI>Seneca</HI> has not obliged us with the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> ob&s;erved by him, which en|couraged this Prediction.</P>
<P>No Hi&s;tories of <HI>Comets</HI> were of &s;ervice to the Theory of them, until <HI>Nicephoras Gregoras,</HI> a <HI>Con&s;tantinopolitan</HI> A&s;tronomer, de&s;cribed the Path of a Comet in 1337.</P>
<P>All that con&s;idered <HI>Comets</HI> until <HI>Tycho Brabe,</HI> con&s;ider'd them as no o|ther than Vapours below the <HI>Moon.</HI></P>
<P>Anon, the &s;agacious <HI>Kepler</HI> improving on <HI>Tycho</HI>'s Di&s;coveries, came at a true Sy&s;tem of <HI>Comets,</HI> and found, that they moved freely through the Planetary Orbs, with a Motion that is not much different from a <HI>Rectilinear</HI> one.</P>
<P>The incomparable <HI>Hevelius</HI> went on, and tho' he embraced the <HI>Keplerian</HI> Hypothe&s;is, of the <HI>Rectilinear Motion of Comets,</HI> yet he was aware, <HI>That the Path of a Comet was bent into a curve Line towards the Sun.</HI></P>
<P>At la&s;t the illu&s;trious Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> arrives with Demon&s;trations, That all the Phaenomena of <HI>Comets</HI> would naturally follow from the <HI>Keplerian</HI> Principles. He &s;hewed a Method of delineating the <HI>Orbits</HI> of <HI>Comets</HI> geometrically; which cau&s;ed Admiration in all that con&s;idered it, and comprehended it.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t ingenious Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> has made Calculations, upon which he ventures to foretell the <HI>Return</HI> of <HI>Comets;</HI> but he ob&s;erves, that &s;ome of them have their <HI>Nodes</HI> pretty near the annual Orb of the Earth. I will tran&s;cribe the Words he concludes with: 'What may be the <HI>Con&s;equences</HI> of &s;o near an <HI>Appul&s;e,</HI> or of a <HI>Contact,</HI> or la&s;tly of a <HI>Shock</HI> of the Cele&s;tial Bodies, (which is by no means impo&s;&s;ible to come to pa&s;s) I leave to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by the Studious of Phy&s;ical Matters.'</P>
<P>The Sentiments of &s;o acute a Philo&s;opher as Dr. <HI>Cheyne</HI> upon <HI>Comets,</HI> de&s;erve to be tran&s;cribed. Says he,</P>
<P>There is a <HI>Species</HI> of Heavenly Bodies, call'd COMETS, which re|volve about the <HI>Sun;</HI> in very Oblong <HI>Elliptick Orbits,</HI> approaching to <HI>Parabolick Curves.</HI> The Times of their <HI>Periodical</HI> Revolutions are very long, &s;ince in three or four Thou&s;and Years, we have not po&s;itively de|termin'd the Returns of above one or two; however, its certain, that like our <HI>Planets,</HI> they do move in a recurring <HI>Orbit,</HI> that the <HI>Sun</HI> is in one of the <HI>Foci</HI> of this <HI>Orbit,</HI> that by a Ray from the <HI>Sun,</HI> they de&s;cribe e|qual
<PB N="5" REF="005389_0005_10180F5B62D63298"><HI>Area</HI>'s in equal Times, that the &s;ame <HI>Law of Gravitation</HI> obtains in them, which does in the <HI>Planets;</HI> that their <HI>Peroidical</HI> Times are cer|tain and invariable, and that their Motions are regular, only their Cour&s;e in their <HI>Orbits</HI> is not determin'd one way, but in differently &s;ome of 'em move one way, others another: They are al&s;o about the &s;ame Bulk with the <HI>Planets,</HI> generally &s;peaking; and like them are compact &s;olid Bodies, but &s;urrounded with a va&s;tly large thin Fluid, intermixt with &s;everal gro&s;|&s;er Particles, and compo&s;ing an irregular unequally di&s;pos'd and uncer|tainly agitated Ma&s;s; which is call'd its <HI>Atmo&s;phere,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Diameter,</HI> is ten or fifteen Times as long as that of its Body. Be&s;ides which, it has a long lucid <HI>Train,</HI> which is rais'd in its Approach to the <HI>Sun,</HI> by the Heat thereof, and extends &s;ometimes to four hundred Thou&s;and Miles above its Body. It is always oppo&s;ite to the <HI>Sun,</HI> becau&s;e it is the thiner part of its <HI>Atmo&s;phere,</HI> extremely rarified by his Rays; and &s;o rare that the <HI>Stars</HI> may be &s;een through it. This <HI>Tail</HI> accompanies it through its Cour&s;e overall the <HI>Planetary Regions,</HI> encrea&s;ing in its Approach to the <HI>Sun,</HI> and le&s;&s;en|ing in its Rece&s;s. The&s;e <HI>Comets</HI> &s;ometimes come &s;o near the <HI>Sun,</HI> as to be heated to &s;uch a Degree that they cannot become cool again, in many Thou&s;ands of Years. This with its violent Motion in a <HI>Curve,</HI> which comes near to a &s;treight Line, after it has pa&s;s'd its <HI>Perihelium,</HI> and the irregular Di&s;po&s;ition of the confus'd Ma&s;s of its <HI>Atmo&s;phere,</HI> makes it an un|fit Habitation for Animals, that are not in a State of Puni&s;hment, &s;o far as we can conceive of the Nature of Animals. And therefore &s;ome have tho't it de&s;ign'd, to &s;upply the Expence of Fluids in the <HI>Sun</HI> and the <HI>Planets.</HI> But as I have before hinted, this does not &s;eem &s;o very probable, becau&s;e Nature always &s;upplies con&s;tant and regular Expences after a con&s;tant and regular Manner. Now the Returns of the&s;e Bodies are &s;o irregular and uncertain, and we &s;o little feel the Effects of the&s;e Returns (which of Nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t be felt, if the&s;e frightful Bodies made the <HI>Reimbur&s;e|ment</HI> mentioned, &s;ince the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Planets</HI> as recruited all at once, or in a very &s;hort time, of all the lo&s;s they have &s;uffer'd in their Fluids for many Years before,) that I am afraid no &s;uch benign Influences, are to be expected from them. I readily grant, that there may be &s;ome Clouds of Vapours &s;weep'd off the <HI>Tails</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Comets,</HI> by the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Planets</HI> as they approach them. But then it is uncertain of what Nature the&s;e Vapours are, for every Vapour will not become a Fluid, unle&s;s its Parts be of &s;uch a determin'd <HI>Figure</HI> and <HI>Size</HI> as the Nature of Fluids require. Now it's certain, that Heat will rai&s;e any Body into a Vapour, provided it be &s;ufficient to di&s;&s;olve the Union of its Parts, and increa&s;e their Bulk to a nece&s;&s;ary Dimen&s;ion: Moreover its hardly accountable how the <HI>Sun</HI> &s;hou'd draw from thence only the Fluid of Light, the Earth, that of Wa|ter,
<PB N="6" REF="005389_0006_10182BF02CB947A0">the other <HI>Planets</HI> their proper Fluids; or if they were &s;uppos'd to draw all <HI>promi&s;cuou&s;ly,</HI> how the&s;e Effects can an&s;wer the De&s;ign, &s;ince Wa|ter in the <HI>Sun,</HI> which wanted only more of the Fluid of Light, wou'd be as improper a Gue&s;t, as Fire on the Earth which wanted only more Water. I think it is more probable, that the&s;e frightful Bodies are the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Divine Ju&s;tice,</HI> and in their Vi&s;its, lend us <HI>Benign</HI> or <HI>Noxious</HI> Vapours, according to the De&s;igns of Providence: that they may have brought, and may &s;till bring about, the great <HI>Cata&s;trophes</HI> of our <HI>Sy&s;tem,</HI> by rai&s;ing of <HI>Tides,</HI> changing the Figures, and the Po&s;itions of the <HI>Planets,</HI> and the very Nature of the <HI>Orbits</HI> them&s;elves: and that they may be the Habi|tation of <HI>Animals</HI> in a &s;tate of Puni&s;hment; which, if it did not look too <HI>national,</HI> there are many Arguments to render not improbable. But as for the Diminution of the Quantity of Fluids in the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Planets,</HI> it is certainly &s;o &s;mall and &s;o incon&s;iderable (tho' &s;till it be &s;ometing) that it will never be &s;en&s;ible in any finite Number of Years, and &s;o needs not &s;o magnificent of Light, I do believe it may be demon&s;trated, that if all the Fluid which the <HI>Sun</HI> lo&s;es in a Year were brought into a &s;olid Form, it would not equal a Grain of Sand. Now what is that to the va&s;t Body of the <HI>Sun?</HI> And as for the Fluids on <HI>our Globe,</HI> tho' &s;ome of them be reduc'd into a &s;olid Form, yet upon Examination it will be found that mo&s;t of the &s;ame is again di&s;&s;olv'd into a Fluid; for in all <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> the Matter is plain; and as for <HI>Minerals</HI> and <HI>Metals,</HI> I doubt much, whether there be very many new Productions or Generations of that kind, &s;ince their fir&s;t Production. So that though there be &s;ome lo&s;s of Fluids on <HI>our Globe,</HI> yet there is &s;tore enough to &s;upply all the U&s;es of Life and Vegetation, for any finite number of Years; and by the Frame, and Make of this our <HI>Sy&s;tem,</HI> it does not &s;eem de&s;ign'd to la&s;t for ever, without &s;ome con&s;iderable Changes.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Comets,</HI> I have little more to &s;ay about them, than what I have already &s;aid, their <HI>Nature, Orbits, Motions</HI> and <HI>Situations,</HI> have been &s;o lately determin'd, (indeed it is but of late, that the <HI>A&s;tronomy</HI> of the <HI>Planets</HI> them&s;elves, and their <HI>Satellits</HI> has been brought to any toler|able Perfection, and much later &s;ince final Cau&s;es have been cultivated, with that Care becoming &s;o noble and about 'em extant, &s;o few of 'em, that we know of, have vi&s;ited us twice, that we have &s;carce any &s;olid Foundation to build our Rea&s;oning upon. Only, as I have before hint|ed, the&s;e <HI>blazing Stars</HI> &s;eem not de&s;ign'd for the Habitation of <HI>Animals</HI> in a State of Happine&s;s, nay even &s;carce of <HI>Animals</HI> not under a State of Puni&s;hment; they may be the fir&s;t <HI>Rudiments of Planets,</HI> not as
<PB N="7" REF="005389_0007_10182BF33A9FA8F0">yet brought into our <HI>Sy&s;tem,</HI> or rather the <HI>Ruins</HI> of &s;ome bani&s;h'd thence, to wander in the&s;e long <HI>Eccentrick Orbits,</HI> through the World. But mo&s;t likely they are the <HI>Mini&s;ters of Divine Ju&s;tice,</HI> &s;ending baneful Steams, from their long Trains, upon the <HI>Planets,</HI> they come nigh; and if what is commonly &s;aid of 'em by <HI>A&s;trologers</HI> be true, they &s;eldom vi&s;it us without &s;ome &s;uch direful Salutation. However, from them we may learn that the <HI>Divine Vengeance,</HI> may find a Seat for the Puni&s;hment of his di&s;obedient Creatures, without being put to the Expen&s;e of a new Creation.'</P>
<P>When I &s;ee a va&s;t Comet, blazing and rolling about the unmea&s;ura|ble <HI>Aether,</HI> I will think;</P>
<P>'Who can tell, but I now &s;ee a wicked World <HI>made a fiery Oven in the Time of the Anger of GOD! The Lord &s;wallowing them up in his Wrath and the Fire devouring them!</HI></P>
<P>What prodigious Mi&s;chief and Ruin might &s;uch a <HI>Ball of Confu&s;ion</HI> bring upon our &s;inful <HI>Globe,</HI> if the Great GOD order its Approach unto us.</P>
<P>How happy they, that are in the Favour and Friend&s;hip of that Glori|ous Lord, who <HI>knows how to deliver the Pious</HI> out of Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and <HI>re&s;erve the Unju&s;t for a Puni&s;hment of a Day of Judgment.</HI></P>
