<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>MY Reverend Brother, Mr. <HI>Beach,</HI> hath &s;o exhau&s;ted the Subject in this Controver&s;y, and what he hath done is &s;o well adapted to defend me as well as him&s;elf, that I &s;hall give my &s;elf no further Trouble than a &s;hort Preface, to remark upon a few Things that may &s;eem yet to demand &s;omething to be &s;aid in my Vindication.&mdash; And I would begin with &s;aying, I am heartily &s;orry for the Depar|ture of our decea&s;ed Antagoni&s;t, and am particularly grieved that he &s;hould be called out of the World in the Heat of this Controver&s;y; for (as Arch-Bi&s;hop <HI>Tillu&s;on</HI> &s;ays, [Pref. to Serm. Jo&s;h. xxiv. 15.] in this Ca&s;e) <Q>Methinks a Man mu&s;t be not a little out of Countenance to find him&s;elf in this [di&s;putacious] Temper, tran&s;lated into the calm and peaceable Regions of the Ble&s;&s;ed, &amp;c.</Q>&mdash;I could wi&s;h he might have had Oppor|tunity to cool after &s;o great a Part of his Life &s;pent in wrang|ling again&s;t the Church in one Shape or other; and that, as far as I could ever &s;ee, without any ju&s;t Argument or fair Rea|&s;oning; not can I &s;ee any Thing more like fair Arguing in this la&s;t Piece, than in any of the former, and &s;till &s;hould wonder that he could think it &s;uch, if it were worth the while to won|der at any Thing.&mdash; I know indeed great Allowances mu&s;t be made for human Frailty, and the unaccountable Prejudices ari&s;ing from Temper, Cu&s;tom, Vogue, Education or &s;ome unto|ward A&s;&s;ociation of Ideas which may &s;trangely warp our Minds and bia&s;s the Train of our Thoughts, though I &s;hould &s;carce think it po&s;&s;ible were it not frequent undeniable Fact, that any One's Mind &s;hould be &s;o perverted, as to be zealous to the la&s;t Ga&s;p, for Doctrines, as fundamental, which evidently appear to me directly contrary even to &s;trict Demon&s;tration.&mdash;But as I know I need great Allowances to be made for my &s;elf, &s;o I am willing to entertain the mo&s;t candid and charitable Opinion po&s;|&s;ible of Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on,</HI> and could only wi&s;h for the unbia&s;&s;ed Sentence of a good Judge that is perfectly di&s;intere&s;ted in the Controver&s;y between us.&mdash;Indeed there is &s;uch a Judge before
<PB N="vi" REF="006094_0004_10278420A15D7160">whom he hath now appeared, and with whom I hope and tru&s;t he hath obtained Forgivene&s;s and Acceptance, as <HI>Job</HI>'s Friends did after their groundle&s;s Di&s;putes with him; but I can't but think it mu&s;t have been attended with &s;ome &s;uch a Remark upon the Cau&s;e he has been pleading again&s;t Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> as GOD makes on them. <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have not &s;poken of me the thing that is right at my Servant</HI> Job <HI>hath;</HI> tho' doubtle&s;s much of human Frailty hath attended this Di&s;pute on both Sides as well as that.&mdash;And would to GOD we might all learn to write and &s;peak both of him and one another, as it might be &s;uppo&s;ed we &s;hould if we knew it were the la&s;t we &s;hould ever &s;peak or write.</P>
<P>I was particularly grieved when I came to his la&s;t Words, p. 120, which he wrote in Defence of Dr. <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">,</HI> again&s;t what I had alledged from him, who&s;e Notion I take to be the mo&s;t di&s;|honourable to the be&s;t of Beings that can well be imagined; and after all he has &s;aid, upon reviewing it, I cannot &s;ee it to be at all mended: The more I examine it the wor&s;e it appears; and I could wi&s;h my Readers to examine and con&s;ider carefully that <HI>fir&s;t Digre&s;&s;ion</HI> of his <HI>&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nd Book</HI> in which he labours the Matter to prove, <HI>"That it is indeed better to be eternally mi&s;era|ble than not to be, and that GOD may, con&s;i&s;tent with his Attri|butes inflict expul&s;ive and eternal Mi&s;ery, even upon innocent Crea|tures."</HI>&mdash;I know very well the Dr. pretended to an&s;wer <HI>Ar|minius,</HI> without needing to come to this Extremity; but I mu&s;t think after all his Attempts, he has not done it; and that whoever will read him with Care and Impartiality, will be &s;en|&s;ible that his Talk is meer Quibble, and that he would not have undertaken to e&s;tabli&s;h the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> two Points &s;o elaborately, if he had not been &s;en&s;ible of the Deficiency of his Cau&s;e without them; and indeed every one that is capable of thinking and will think, mu&s;t &s;ee that the&s;e Points are, as I &s;aid, fundamental to the <HI>Su|pralap&s;arian</HI> Scheme, and that the <HI>Sublap&s;arian</HI> Way, which Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> preferred, is evidently but a meer Chimera, and only keeps the Difficulty aloof and a little out of Sight, but comes to nothing without going to the Bottom of Things in the <HI>Supra|lap&s;arian</HI> Way, which being founded on tho&s;e Principles is infi|nitely wor&s;e than nothing.&mdash;And whereas he pretends I di&s;gui&s;|ed the Dr's Sentiments, by in&s;erting an Expre&s;&s;ion of my own by Way of Explication. I am content to leave the whole I&s;&s;ue with any indifferent Per&s;on that &s;hall read the Digre&s;&s;ion, and compare it with the Account I gave of it. The idle Di&s;tinction of <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> and <HI>ordinate</HI> Power will nothing help it, and all
<PB N="vii" REF="006094_0005_10278429DFAC7988">Endeavours to mend the Matter will be found to be only at|tempting to wa&s;h the Blackamore white.</P>
<P>I was al&s;o grieved to find Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> &s;pending &s;ome of his la&s;t Hours in the &s;everal Pages before tho&s;e la&s;t mentioned, in writing over and over again what he had &s;aid and I had an&s;|wered, about Nece&s;&s;ity. &amp;c. I only de&s;ire any one that would be impartial to read over again what I &s;aid, and I believe he will &s;ee in it a &s;ufficient An&s;wer to what he has here repeated, and I leave it to any indifferent Per&s;on to judge upon compa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ing us together, whether, what he writes, does not mainly con|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> meer Quibble and look too much like a &s;tudied Endea|vour to di&s;gui&s;e Things, and &s;eem to &s;ay &s;omething, without &s;ay|ing any Thing to the Purpo&s;e.&mdash; It was obvious enough, when I &s;aid, there were Thou&s;ands of Things that GOD could not will or decree in any Sen&s;e, I meant the Sins of Men, and after all the Bu&s;tle he makes about this Expre&s;&s;ion, has he proved the contrary?&mdash; By no Means: For to permit and over-rule them does not at all imply the willing them. And one would think it impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould be in earne&s;t in pretending that my Doc|trine led to Fatali&s;m, becau&s;e I allow GOD's Foreknowledge, which, he argues, mu&s;t according to my Doctrine, depend on his Will, or el&s;e "&s;ome fatal De&s;tiny independent on GOD or Man has counteracted his Purpo&s;es and produced tho&s;e E|vents." P. 117.&mdash;Strange! when he knew I had maintained, as the Truth is, that they depend immediately, not on the Will of GOD, nor on Fate, but on the free Wills of wicked Men, and all that God could will was only to permit his Creatures to act freely, but this does by no Means imply, that he mu&s;t will their Wickedne&s;s, it being &s;olely owing to their own Wills. &mdash;As to all he &s;ays here of Foreknowledge, it is abundantly an|&s;wered by Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> in that large Pa&s;&s;age you will &s;ee cited by Mr. <HI>Beach.</HI> And as to his Di&s;tinction of Nece&s;&s;ity into Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of <HI>Coertion</HI> and of <HI>Con&s;equence,</HI> it only &s;till confounds <HI>Ne|ce&s;&s;ity</HI> with <HI>Certainty,</HI> which is all in Effect that the latter can mean, &s;o that I cannot &s;ee that it at all clears the Difficulty. &mdash; Though I freely walk rather than fly, I am under as fatal a Nece&s;&s;ity not to fly as I &s;hould be if I was bound down under a Thou&s;and Weight of Lead; and &s;o is the Wicked not to be good, if GOD never put it any more into his Power to be good, than to fly above the Moon or to breath at the Bottom of the Sea. &mdash;As for my Definition of <HI>Contingency</HI> which he finds Fault with, it is in Effect the &s;ame with Dr. <HI>Watts</HI>'s in Philo&s;. E&s;&s;ays
<PB N="viii" REF="006094_0006_1027842CE948B1F0">page. 334.&mdash;There is another Di&s;tinction of Nece&s;&s;ity which may be of &s;ome U&s;e in this Controver&s;y, i. e. into <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>moral.</HI> I am under a natural Nece&s;&s;ity of weighing towards the Ground, and under a moral Nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;&s;enting to &s;elf evident Truth: The one is a Nece&s;&s;ity of the Body, the other of the Mind, and in both I am pa&s;&s;ive; my Body to the Force of Gravity, and my Mind to the Force of Truth; and in my Opinion, in both Ca&s;es to the ince&s;&s;ant Exertion of the Deity him&s;elf, who in neither of them leaves us at Liberty. &mdash; It may indeed be figuratively &s;aid, that I freely a&s;&s;ent to evident Truth, as I free|ly &s;uffer the Force of Gravity, or the Impre&s;&s;ion of Light on my Eyes, and as it is figuratively &s;aid we are <HI>drawn by the Fa|ther,</HI> and the <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e of Chri&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.</HI> But who &s;ees not that this is nothing to the Ca&s;e in hand? &mdash; This indeed has been one of the chief Occa&s;ions of all the Mi&s;takes and Di&s;putes in Religion: viz. the building Doctrines on metaphorical and other figurative Expre&s;&s;ions. &mdash; I mu&s;t therefore &s;till maintain that in a &s;trict philo&s;ophical Sen&s;e, Will and Action is free and under no Con&s;traint. Be my Mind ever &s;o much nece&s;&s;itated to a&s;&s;ent to evident Truth, I am neverthele&s;s free to chu&s;e or re|fu&s;e, to act or not to act, in Con&s;equence of this A&s;&s;ent; for Action according to the Frame, of our Nature, ever &s;prings from a &s;elf exerting Power. &mdash; Thus it evidently appears to me, and without this, Virtue and Vice, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, Reward and P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;hment, can have no Meaning, but are empty Names.

<P>And now as to your Piece Mr. <HI>M. D.</HI> I have two or three Remarks, I would make on that. The fir&s;t relates to <HI>Origi|nal Sin.</HI> &mdash; And here the main Thing I &s;hall take notice of, is, the ridiculous Light you endeavour to put me in by repre&s;ent|ing me a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> preaching a Sermon according to my Doctrine in this Letter, and then u&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Office of Bap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i&s;m directly after, which you &s;uppo&s;e would appear utterly in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;i&s;tant with the Doctrine of my Sermon, p. 128. &mdash; To which I an&s;wer; It is what I have often done, and yet nobody ever imagined any &s;uch In|con&s;i&s;tency: Nor indeed is there any more Incon&s;i&s;tency be|tween our Office and my Sermon, than there is in the Office it &s;elf, which is none at all.

And there|fore the Church, by <HI>Original Sin</HI> inherent, which &s;he calls the <HI>Birth Sin,</HI> could mean only what was then called <HI>material Sin,</HI> meaning any Want of perfect Conformity to the perfect Law of original Righteou&s;ne&s;s, however unknown or involuntary, in the animal Appetites and Pa&s;&s;ions, which can be only materially &s;inful; hence &s;he &s;ays Lu&s;t or <HI>Concupi&s;cence hath the Nature of Sin,</HI> i. e. the <HI>material</HI> not the <HI>formal</HI> Nature of it, for it cannot be <HI>formal Sin</HI> till &s;ome Years after, when it comes to be in|dulged in Oppo&s;ition to a known Law of GOD.&mdash; And as to <HI>Original Guilt;</HI> all the Church means by it is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">according to the then received &s;chola&s;tic Definition of <HI>Guile) and Obligation to &s;uffer the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">ment,</HI> ju&s;tly inflicted by the Wrath of GOD, for the Sin of our fir&s;t Parents, we being all born under the Cur&s;e then in&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ted, and therefore are figuratively &s;aid to the born <HI>Children of Wrath,</HI> from which Cur&s;e we are federally deliver|ed by Bapti&s;m, taking us out of the fir&s;t, <HI>Adam</HI> and grafting us into Chri&s;t.&mdash; All this we ever allow and preach, and this, as I take it, is all the Church ever meant in the&s;e publick Offices: And how va&s;tly &s;hort is this of the &s;trong Expre&s;&s;ions I object|ed to in your larger Catechi&s;m?&mdash;And as to that Expre&s;&s;ion of St. <HI>Paul</HI> in <HI>Rom.</HI> v. of many being <HI>made Sinners,</HI> who &s;ees not that it is a figurative Expre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame Nature with that of Chri&s;t being <HI>made Sin</HI> for us who knew no Sin?&mdash; You

And as for your Brother <HI>Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">'s</HI> Performance, which is much of a Piece with Your's and which he calls a <HI>Vindication of Go&s;pel Truth,</HI> pretending to &s;hew <HI>dangerous Errors</HI> in my Letter, I mu&s;t think it &s;hould rather be called a Di&s;pu|tation again&s;t the Go&s;pel, &s;hewing the dangerous Doctrines im|plied in tho&s;e Promi&s;es, <HI>a&s;k and ye &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;eek and ye &s;hall find</HI> &amp;c. &mdash; Not that I need to concern my &s;elf much with him according to his own Conce&s;&s;ion; For he &s;ays p. 10. <Q>The Que&s;ti|on is, not whether there are Conditional Promi&s;es to Sinners? Nor whether the Sinner's Encouragement to hope for the Suc|ce&s;s of his Endeavours, (which he allows to be great and pre|cious,)
<PB N="xii" REF="006094_0010_102784367AE00580">ri&s;es in Proportion to his Diligence in the u&s;e of ap|pointed Means?</Q>&mdash;whereas the&s;e are, in effect, all the Que&s;|tions that I know of on this Head, between us; and in allowing the&s;e he grants all I contend for.&mdash;And all his Talk again&s;t the&s;e Encouragements being called Promi&s;es is plainly built on a mi&s;|under&s;tanding of tho&s;e Texts, <HI>Not by Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s which we have done,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Who made thee to differ?</HI> &amp;. <HI>Where then is boa&s;ting?</HI> &amp;c. and the Oppo&s;ition <HI>of Grace and Works</HI> [on all which &s;ee <HI>Whitby.</HI>] And this Mi&s;under&s;tanding of the&s;e and many other Texts, &s;till evidently appear to me to be owing to the want of ju&s;t Critici&s;m, and to that old Schola&s;tical Philo&s;ophy of the Roman Catholics, which perverted the Plainne&s;s and Simplicity of the Go&s;pel, being a Sy&s;tem of many Centuries later Date than the Go&s;pel it &s;elf, and was not at once purged away by the Reformation&mdash;Nor did I mean, nor ought he, as in his lamen|table Outcry, p. 32, to have charged me with, the lea&s;t Cen&s;o|riou&s;ne&s;s or Uncharitablene&s;s towards any Chri&s;tians, in the Cen|&s;ure I pa&s;&s;ed on that <HI>vain Philo&s;ophy,</HI> which, when I know how Things have gone, I con&s;ider rather as their Unhappine&s;s than their Fault.</P>
<P>I never imagined but the&s;e Promi&s;es, <HI>A&s;k and ye &s;hall receive,</HI> &amp;c. were made to the Regenerate, to engage them to labour and a&s;k for further Mea&s;ures of Grace and Favours which they had not yet attained, as well as to the Unregenerate to engage them to labour and &s;eek for that which may be called the lowe&s;t De|gree of a State of Grace.&mdash;And it is evident to me that as God (who con&s;iders all Things as being what they really are) loves, or hates, approves or di&s;approves his Creatures in various Degrees, according to their real moral Qualities, (among which I com|prehend Faith and Unbelief) &s;o there mu&s;t be a great Difference between his Di&s;po&s;itions towards the Ob&s;tinate relentle&s;s Sinner and him that is &s;eriou&s;ly concerned and heartily labours to reform, though not yet throughly reclaimed, who mu&s;t, in the Nature of the Thing, be &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;ome Degrees of Sincerity and Faith, though not yet to be numbered among tho&s;e that are intirely <HI>the Faithful.</HI> And accordingly, all the Notion I can have of the Promi&s;es and the whole Purport of re|vealed Religion; (and I leave it to any Per&s;on of plain common Sen&s;e, not debauched with Schola&s;tici&s;m, to judge who carefully reads the Bible; whether it be not right?) I &s;ay all the Notion I can have of the Promi&s;es, &amp;c. is, That they are an A&s;&s;urance given us in the Name of GOD, by his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and

<P><HI>And had be not Rea&s;on to be angry, for your "wilful fal&s;e Citations of his Words?</HI> P. 9. <HI>You &s;ay to him, that the Contro|ver&s;y betwixt us is not whether our Salvation be owing to the free rich and &s;overeign Grace of GOD; but whether GOD does re|quire any Thing at all of us, in Order to our Salvation, or as a Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ition of our entering into Heaven, this you tell him he denies.

<P>You have now repeated his Charge again&s;t me for <HI>wilful fal&s;e Citations.</HI> And pray tell me uprightly, when you read his heavy Complaints again&s;t me, did not your Brea&s;t &s;well with Indignation?

<P><HI>I can't deny, but that when I read Mr.</HI> Dickin&s;on<HI>'s Accu|&s;ation again&s;t you, I felt my Heart ri&s;e again&s;t you with Abhor|rence and Dete&s;tation. And I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, the Ca&s;e is much the &s;ame with all other Readers: For all Men hate a Liar.

<P>May I then have the Liberty to vindicate my &s;elf, and prove, that every one of the&s;e Things are to be found in his Book, in the Pages refer'd to, which he &s;ays are not one of them to be found in his Book?

<P><HI>I think, no innocent Man &s;hould contentedly re&s;t under &s;o hea|vy a Calumny. There is certainly mo&s;t impudent and barefaced Fal&s;hood on one Side or the other.

<P>May I not be &s;evere towards my &s;elf, and expre&s;s my &s;elf thus, "If what Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> has laid to my Charge be true, then I am as impudent a Liar as ever lived; but if what he has &s;aid be not true, then he was under a &s;mall Mi&s;take?

<P>I declare &s;olemnly, and as I expect to meet my departed Friend before Chri&s;t's Judgment-Seat, I can't find in my own Heart that I had any Inclination or Temptation to cite him fal&s;ly. I found (as I thought) &s;o many &s;hocking Ab&s;urdities in his Performance, that I had no Manner of Occa&s;ion to invent any, and father them on him. And upon a Review of Facts, I don't find that. I have mi&s;s'd in any Citation, even &s;o much as one Syllable, as he did by me even in that Moment he was charging it upon me. But I &s;corn to in&s;i&s;t upon &s;uch a Mi&s;|take; much le&s;s &s;ay it was a wilful Fal&s;hood: For this looks too much like a furious unbridled Pa&s;&s;ion: However, I de&s;ire not to clear my &s;elf by Prote&s;tations; let me be tried by the Facts; They will not lie; but &s;hew whether I am guilty, or not guilty.

<P>This is no Citation at all, and therefore can't be a <HI>fal&s;e Citation.</HI> I was then &s;tating the Que&s;tion as I under&s;tood it, and as I apprehended this to be the Ca&s;e, &s;o I refer'd the Reader to P. 47. that he might judge, whether I had a right Un|rde&s;tanding of it, or not.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I did not wrong him in &s;aying this. For may I not judge of a Man's Opinion by his Words, when he pretends &s;e|riou&s;ly to declare and defend his Sentiments? I would not catch at an unguarded Expre&s;&s;ion, but I learn'd Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI>'s Opi|nion of in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ced he had any &s;ettled Opinion in this Point from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enor of his Di&s;cour&s;e, and his &s;umming it up in the End, P. 47.&mdash; And pray, tell me, does not Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> undertake to prove, that the Grace of GOD in converting us, does not de|pend upon our Concurrence, in Order to its being effectual; and that GOD converts us irre&s;i&s;tibly; and that he requires nothing of us as a Condition of Conver&s;ion upon our performing of which we &s;hall be converted; but without which we &s;hall not be converted?</P>

<P><HI>This was certainly his Sentiment, otherwi&s;e he would not have oppo&s;ed you, for a&s;&s;erting, that the Grace of GOD in con|verting us depends on our Concurrence, as a Condition without which it will not be effectual.</HI></P>

<SP>

<P><HI>This is true.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>If then Conver&s;ion is Salvation; and there is no Condi|tion of Conver&s;ion, but it is the <HI>&s;ole Re&s;ult of &s;overeign Grace,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="006094_0016_1027844838F888A0">as he a&s;&s;erts; Is it not mo&s;t evident, that he denied that there is any Condition of Salvation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I can't deny it.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I can prove this more directly. For whereas I had &s;aid in my Sermon <Q>Grace &s;aves us in no other Way than by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou obeying the Go&s;pel." To this Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> reply'd, I would enquire of Mr. <HI>Beach,</HI> whether if GOD has pro|mi&s;ed to &s;ave us by our Obedience, he is not indebted to us, to make that Promi&s;e good, upon our performing of that Obedience, whatever Proportion there may be, be|tween the Work and the promi&s;ed Reward? And if the Condition be Works, of whatever Value the Works be, is not the Fulfilment of the Obligation due to him who has done the Work, and perform'd the Condition?</Q> Now I ap|peal to every Reader, if there can be any other Sen&s;e put upon the&s;e Words fairly, but only this? That is, If GOD had re|quired any even the lea&s;t Thing to be done by us as a Condition of Salvation, then when we have done that Work and fulfilled that Condition, GOD would be obliged, and indebted to us, to &s;ave us; but that GOD &s;hould be obliged and indebted to &s;ave us, is mo&s;t ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e: Therefore he has not re|quired the lea&s;t Work to be done by us, as the Condition of Sal|vation. This is the true Meaning of this Pa&s;&s;age. And I am &s;atisfied, he meant it in this Sen&s;e: otherwi&s;e he would have tried to put ano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her Glo&s;s upon it, after I had &s;hewed the mon&s;trous Ab&s;urdity of it: But alas it mu&s;t &s;hift for it &s;elf not|with&s;tanding any Thing its Author would do for it. And now he declares he never did deny, that GOD required &s;ome Thing (Work) to be done by us as a Condition of Salvation, and in &s;o doing he has given up his Cau&s;e. For that was one principal Point for which he began the Contention. &mdash; But enough of this. Now plea&s;e to read my <HI>fourth wilful fal&s;e Citation.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>You tell him that he</HI> <Q><HI>denies that Vertue is in any Sen&s;e or Degree the Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it of our Choice and Pains, even when we are a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></Q> P. 10. <HI>Now what &s;ay you to this?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t ob&s;erve, I had a&s;&s;erted in my Sermon, that though Faith and every other Virtue be the Fruits of the Spirit of GOD, yet it is not &s;o to be under&s;tood, as though they were not likewi&s;e the Effect of our Choice and Pains. This Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> was plea&s;ed to deny. See Page 18. Where as &s;ure as I have Eyes I now read the&s;e Works, viz. <Q>That Faith
<PB N="20" REF="006094_0017_1027844BD0FB7D08">and every other Virtue are not the EFFECT of our own Choice and Pains&mdash; appears mo&s;t evident from the following Texts.</Q> There he cites no le&s;s Number than Nine Texts to prove it.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had ob&s;erved in my sermon, that how much &s;oever we magnify Grace we mu&s;t not imagine, that "Grace will &s;ave us in any other Way than by our obeying the Go&s;pel." Or that in other Words, all the rich Grace of the Go&s;pel will not &s;ave us unle&s;s in Heart and Life we be conform'd to the Go&s;pel. I never dreamt that any but a di&s;tracted Man would deny this. But to my great Surprize Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> contradicted it with the utmo&s;t Zeal, as overthrowing and &s;ubverting the whole Go&s;pel. What he of|fer'd again&s;t it I &s;et in its genuine contemptible Light; for which he complains bitterly, that I have made him the Song of the Drunkard. But I appeal to all impartial Men, whether it was I, or he him&s;elf that made him ridiculous? But now being a little a&s;hamed of it, he denies that ever he &s;aid it; and charges me with wilful Fal&s;hood. Now I was &s;o weak. I confe&s;s, as to think that when he brought &s;everal Arguments and Texts to prove that Grace don't &s;ave us in the Way of Go&s;pel Obedience, and attempted to prove that it was not only contrary to the holy Scripture, but to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and to all the Prote&s;|tant Churches in the World, I was I &s;ay, &s;o weak as to think, that this vehement denying that Grace does &s;ave us in the Way of Go&s;pel Obedience, was the &s;ame as to affirm, that Grace does not &s;ave us in the Way of Go&s;pel Obedience. Pray what do you think of it? Is it not the &s;ame Thing to affirm that Light is not Light, as to deny that Light is Light? Ju&s;t &s;o much Differ|ence there is betwixt what Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> really &s;aid, and what I affirm'd, he &s;aid. And pray was this a wilful Lie in me?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>The true State of the Ca&s;e is this, in my Sermon I had Occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that <Q>as in the Marriage Fea&s;t, the Sup|per was a free Gift, the Invitation free, and no Man p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d any Thing for his Admi&s;&s;ion, yet when the King came in and found there a Man who had not on a Wedding Gar|ment he ordered him to be bound Hand and Foot and to be ca&s;t into outer Darkne&s;s: Now this Wedding Garment is a Temper of Mind and a Life agreeable to the Go&s;pel, which like an Ornament or Wedding Garment to the Soul, makes it fit to appear before GOD, in the Company of Saints and Angels.</Q> By which I meant, that notwith&s;tanding all GOD's Mercies and Chri&s;t's Merits, (of which I had &s;poken before) yet unle&s;s we in our own Per&s;ons became holy, and in Heart and Practice did conform to the Go&s;pel, we &s;hould never &s;ee the Lord. Upon this whole&s;ome and in the&s;e Times mo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary Doctrine, Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> falls with great Severity, and &s;ays, <HI>P.</HI> 46. Let them (the&s;e foregoing Words) <HI>let them be taken in what Sen&s;e he plea&s;es, this Doctrine is &s;ubver&s;ive of the whole Tenor of the Go&s;pel, and of Method of Reconciliation therein propo&s;ed.</HI> Is not this a&s;toni&s;hing! He &s;eems as if he never could be &s;atisfied with la&s;hing me for it. He repeats it even to Nau&s;eou&s;ne&s;s. He puts that little Word FIT in great Ca|pitals as if it were the <HI>Trojan</HI> Hor&s;e, full of mon&s;terous Here|&s;ies ready to over&s;pread the Land. And now to make me &s;ome Amends for the great Injuries he has done me he charges me with wilful Fal&s;hood, for nothing el&s;e, but putting him in Mind of it. This I think is very hard Treatment indeed, to be a&s;&s;aulted and abu&s;ed without giving the lea&s;t Provocation, and then to be charged with impudent Lying, becau&s;e I pre&s;umed to &s;peak of it.</P>

But at the &s;ame Time I was con&s;cientiou&s;ly careful, not to add, or dimini&s;h, nor alter his Sen&s;e, but took more Pains rightly to under&s;tand him, than to an&s;wer him. Be|&s;ides, I ever directed the Reader to the Page, where he might &s;ee the whole Sentence with its Connection, and the whole Re|tinue of Repetitions attending it.

<P>This Accu&s;ation is perfectly groundle&s;s, I have indeed &s;hewed, that his Doctrine repre&s;ents the ever ble&s;&s;ed GOD as the Author of Sin, of Cruelty and In&s;incerity. But pray how
<PB N="24" REF="006094_0021_1027845B24F0B210">is this a Violation of the third Commandment? Doth not the holy Scripture &s;peak reverently of GOD?

<P>Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's Words are fulfill'd, <HI>With what Mea|&s;ure you mete, it &s;hall be mea&s;ured to you again.</HI> When Men treat others with Candor, they are intitled to the &s;ame kind Treatment again.

The Truth is, the Sermon which has occa&s;ion'd all this Clamor and tragical Outcry, was a &s;hort plain practical Di&s;cour&s;e, had nothing in it that could give the lea&s;t Grounds of Su&s;picion; and was publi&s;hed with no wor&s;er De&s;ign than to excite Man to Gratitude towards GOD for his free Grace, and to work out their own Salvation; from this Con&s;ideration that the Grace of GOD would not &s;ave them without their own Care and Pains: And for this being furiou&s;ly a&s;&s;aulted and &s;cornfully in&s;ulted, in Return I have weighed my Adver&s;ary's Arguments in the Bal|lance of common Sen&s;e and found them to be wanting.&mdash; He who can't bear to be contemned, &s;hould not be forward to make him&s;elf contemptible, and at the &s;ame Time to contemn others.</P>

<P>Did he then believe a conditional Decree, that is, that GOD fore&s;eeing who would comply with his Mercy, elected them; but reprobated or determined to puni&s;h tho&s;e whom he knew would remain impenitent?</P>

<P>I have pa&s;t my Trial for Lying; and hope &s;hall be ac|quitted, my Enemies being Judges.

And I &s;hall u&s;e no other Evidence, than that which ray Accu&s;er hath brought a|gain&s;t me. For I can't wi&s;h for any more full in my Favour. Fir&s;t, As to <HI>Pelagius</HI>'s own Words, GOD (&s;ays he) helps us&mdash; But how? By the internal Operations of his Holy Spirit? No. But <HI>by his Doctrine and Revelation.</HI> What can be more evident than that, he believed nothing of the internal Operations of the Holy Gho&s;t upon our Hearts&punc; He talks of divine Grace in|deed; but then he explains him&s;elf, and tells us expre&s;ly that this divine Grace which illuminates us, and rai&s;es us to the De|&s;ire of GOD, is his Doctrine and Revelation, i. e. the holy Scripture. External Grace he acknowledged; but not in|ternal. And he that can't perceive this is not qualified to &s;it Judge in &s;uch weighty Trials as that of Here&s;y. In this Evi|dence there is not one Word of the Nece&s;&s;ity of the internal Operation of the Spirit upon the Soul of Man: Whereas I have a&s;&s;erted and proved that the internal Operation of the Holy Gho&s;t upon our Souls is as nece&s;&s;ary, as the external Re|demption of Chri&s;t. &mdash; It is a&s;toni&s;hing to me, that my Adver&s;ary could imagine, that this Pa&s;&s;age, di&s;covered that
<PB N="29" REF="006094_0026_10278468D7069B88"><HI>Pelagius</HI> believed the Nece&s;&s;ity of the internal Operation of the Spirit, but only demed the Nece&s;&s;ity of irre&s;i&s;table Grace. I can attribute this to nothing el&s;e, but his being &s;o exce&s;&s;ively fierce and eager to prove me an Heretick, that it cau&s;ed him to be|come &s;tark blind with Charity towards <HI>Pelagius.</HI> So I knew an ill natured Man, who lived betwixt two Neighbours, with each of which he was forever quarrelling alternately; but was always careful when he was in a Fit of Railing at the one, to be exce&s;&s;ive kind to the other.</P>
<P>His other Evidence is <HI>Vo&s;&s;ius,</HI> who &s;ummed up the <HI>Pelagian</HI> Here&s;y thus, <Q><HI>Pelagius</HI> believed, that our Will can by its own Strength alone chu&s;e what Good it will: Or if it wants di|vine Help, (which he did not believe) yet it is at all Times equally ready and wholly in our own Power:</Q> Both which Notions I oppos'd (and as I thinks with unan&s;werable Rea&s;ons in my Sermon. The Account which I gave of the <HI>Pelgian</HI> Here&s;y was exactly the &s;ame with this of <HI>Vo&s;&s;ius,</HI> for I &s;aid that <HI>Pelagius's</HI> Here&s;y lay in this, that he believed that Man was able by his own Strength alone to convert him&s;elf. One Thing more I would ob&s;erve, Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> in tran&s;lating <HI>Vo&s;&s;ius</HI>'s Evi|dence, has omitted that Word ALONE, which while it remains, makes the Evidence as full and as &s;trong as it is po&s;&s;ible in my Favour; and for what Rea&s;on he has been tampering with the Evidence, let the Impartial judge. I have now only improved his own Evidence.

And therefore other Men define Free Will in this wi&s;e, Free-Will in a Power and Rea&s;on of Will by which Good is cho&s;en by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Grace, as Evil is cho&s;en without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Howbeit the State and Condition of Free-Will was other|wi&s;e in our fir&s;t Parents, before they &s;inned, than it was either in them or their Po&s;terity after they had &s;inned. For our fir&s;t Parents <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> until they wounded and overthrew them&s;elves by Sin, had &s;o in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the &s;aid Power of Free-Will by the mo&s;t liberal Gift and Grace of GOD their Maker, that not only they might e&s;chew all manner of Sin, but al&s;o know GOD, and love him, and fulfill all Things pertaining to your Felicity and Welfare. For they were made righteous, and to the Image and Si|militude of GOD, having Power of Free Will (as <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> &s;aith) to obey or di&s;obey, &s;o that by Obedience they might live, and by Di&s;obedience they &s;hould worthily de&s;erve to die. For the wi&s;e Man affirmeth of them, that the State of them was of this &s;ort in the Beginning, &s;aying, <HI>God in the Beginning did create Man and le&s;t him in the Hands of his own Coun&s;el, he gave unto him his Precepts and Commandments, &s;aying, if thou wilt keep the&s;e Commandments, they &s;hall pre&s;erve thee; He hath &s;et before thee Fire and Water, put forth thy Hand to whether thou wilt, before Man is Life and Death, Good and Evil, what him li&s;teth that &s;hall he have.</HI> From this mo&s;t happy E&s;tate our fir&s;t Parents falling by Di&s;obedience, mo&s;t grievou&s;ly hurted them&s;elves, and their Po&s;terity, for be&s;ides many other Evils that came by that Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, the high Power of Man's Rea&s;on and Freedom of Will were wounded and corrupted, and all Men thereby bro't into &s;uch Blindne&s;s and Infirmity, that they cannot e&s;chew Sin except they be made free and illuminated by an e&s;pe|cial Grace, that is to &s;ay, by a &s;upernatural Help, and working of the Holy Gho&s;t, which although the Goodne&s;s
<PB N="33" REF="006094_0030_10278478AE340890">of GOD offers to all Men, yet they only enjoy it, which by their Free-Will do accept and embrace the &s;ame.&mdash; Nor they al&s;o that be holpen by the &s;aid Grace can ac|compli&s;h and perform Things that be for their Wealth, but with much Labour and Endeavour; &s;o great is in our Nature the Corruption of the fir&s;t Sin, and the hea|vy Burthen bearing us down to Evil. For truly albeit the Light of Rea&s;on doth abide, yet it is much darkened, and with much Difficulty doth di&s;cern the Things that be inferior, and pertain to this pre&s;ent Life, but to under&s;tand and perceive the Things that be &s;piritual, and pertain to that everla&s;ting Life, it is of it&s;elf unable. And &s;o likewi&s;e there remaineth a certain Freedom of the Will in tho&s;e Things which do pertain unto the De&s;ires and Works of this pre&s;ent Life; yet to perform &s;piritual and heavenly Things Free-Will of it &s;elf is un&s;ufficient, and therefore the Power of Man's Free Will being thus wounded and decaved hath need of a Phy&s;ician to heal it, and one help to repair it, that it may receive Light and Strength, whereby it may be &s;o, and have Power to do tho&s;e godly and &s;piritual Things, which before the Fall of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> it was able and might have done. To this Blind|ne&s;s &amp; Infirmity of Man's Nature, proceeding of Original Sin, the Prophet <HI>David</HI> hath regard when he de&s;ired his Eyes to be lightned of Almighty GOD that he might con&s;ider the marvellous Things that be in his Law. And al&s;o the Pro|phet <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&punc;</HI> &s;aying&punc; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> while. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> al&s;o plainly declareth the &s;ame, &s;aying, we conclude that Free Will is in Man after his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, which Thing who&s;o denieth, is not a catholic Man&punc; but in &s;piritual De&s;ires and Works to plea&s;e GOD, it is &s;o weak and feeble, that it cannot either begin or perform them, unle&s;s by the Grace and Holy of GOD it be prevented and holpen. And hereby it appeareth, that Man's Strength and Will in all Things which be helpful to the Soul, and &s;hall plea&s;e GOD, hath need of the Graces of the Holy Gho&s;t, by which &s;uch Things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e in&s;pired to Men, and Strength and Con&s;tancy given to perform them, if they do not wilfully refu&s;e the &s;aid Grace offered to them. And likewi&s;e as many Things be in the Scripture which do &s;hew Free Will to be in Man, &s;o there be no fewer Places in Scripture which declare the Grace of God to be &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that if by it Free-Will be not prevented and holpen, it neither can do, nor will
<PB N="34" REF="006094_0031_1027847A3683B040">any Thing good and godly, of which &s;ort be the&s;e Scrip|tures following, <HI>without me you can do nothing.

And being &s;o made able may from thence forth work together with Grace; and by the &s;ame &s;u&s;tained, holpen and maintained, may both accompli&s;h good Works, and avoid Sin, and per&s;evere al&s;o, and increa&s;e in Grace. It is true of the Grace of God only, that fir&s;t we are in|&s;pired and moved to any good Things. But to re&s;i&s;t Temp|tations, and to per&s;i&s;t in Goodne&s;s and to go forward, it is both of the Grace of GOD and our Free Will and Endea|vour. And finally, after we have per&s;evered unto the End, to be crowned with Glory therefore, is the Gift and Mercy of GOD, who of his bountiful Goodne&s;s hath or|dained that Reward to be given after this Life according to &s;uch good Works as be done in this Life by his Grace. Therefore Men ought with much Diligence and Gratitude of Mind to con&s;ider and regard the In&s;piration and whole|&s;ome Motions of the Holy Gho&s;t, and to embrace the Grace of GOD which is offered unto them in Chri&s;t, and moveth them to work good Things. And furthermore, to go about by all Means to &s;hew them&s;elves &s;uch as unto whom the Grace of GOD is not given in vain. And when they do &s;ettle, that notwith&s;tanding their Diligence, yet through their Infirmity they be not able to do that they de&s;ire, then they ought earne&s;tly and with a fervent Devotion and &s;ted|fa&s;t Faith to ask of him which giveth the Beginning, that he would vouch&s;afe to perform it. Which Thing GOD will undoubtedly grant, according to his Promi&s;e, to &s;uch as per|&s;evere in calling upon him. For he is naturally good, and willeth all Men to be &s;aved, and careth for them, and pro|videth all Things by which they may be &s;aved, except by their own Malice they will be evil, and &s;o by the righteous Judgment of GOD peri&s;h and be lo&s;t. For truly Men be to them&s;elves the Author of Sin and Damnation. GOD is neither the Author of Sin, nor the Cau&s;e of Damnation, and yet doth he mo&s;t righteou&s;ly damn tho&s;e
<PB N="35" REF="006094_0032_1027847E5991AB68">Men that do with Vices corrupt their Nature which he made good, and do abu&s;e the &s;ame to evil De&s;ires, again&s;t his mo&s;t holy Will. Wherefore Men be to be warned that they do not impute to GOD their Vice or their Damnation, but to them&s;elves who by Free-Will have abu&s;ed the Grace and Benefits of God. All Men be al&s;o to be admoni&s;hed and chiefly Preachers, that in this high Matter they look on both Sides, &s;o temper and moderate them&s;elves, that neither they &s;o preach the Grace of GOD as to take away thereby Free-Will, nor on the other Side &s;o extol Free-Will, that Injuiry be done to the Grace of GOD.</P></Q>
<P>This Doctrine of the Concurrence of Free-Grace and Free-Will was the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England</HI> 200 Years ago, at the Dawning of the Reformation; and has ever been the &s;ame. Let tho&s;e Calumniators who are perpetually accu&s;ing us of for&s;aking the fir&s;t Doctrines of our Church, look upon this, and exert their utmo&s;t Skill; and I am &s;ure they will not be able to di&s;cover that we now vary from it, &s;o much as one Hair's Breadth. For my Part I could not po&s;&s;ibly expre&s;s the Sentiments of my own Soul, both with Regard to Origi|nal Sin, Free-Grace and Free-Will, more exactly than they are here expre&s;t.

<P>The Rea&s;on why any are not con|verted and &s;aved, is becau&s;e they don't concur and co-ope|rate with divine Grace.

<P>All Men are bro't into &s;uch Blindne&s;s and Infirmity, that they cannot e&s;chew Sin except they be made free and illu|minated by an e&s;pe|cial Grace, that is to &s;ay, by a &s;uper|natural Help and Working of the Holy Gho&s;t, which although the Good|ne&s;s of GOD offers to all Men, yet they only enjoy it, which by their Free-Will do accept and em|brace the &s;ame.</P>

<P>He agrees with me in a&s;&s;erting, that Chri&s;t died for all Men, P. 21. and &s;o has renounced his Catechi&s;m both &s;horter and larger, unle&s;s Chri&s;t died for tho&s;e whom he never re|deemed; as I ob&s;erv'd before. All the Calvini&s;ts I ever con|ver&s;ed with, were wont to &s;ay, that Chri&s;t only for the <HI>Elect,</HI> and no other <HI>are redeem'd by him.</HI> And whereas the holy Bible informs us, that Chri&s;t died for all Men; they tell us it means, only &s;ome of all Sorts, <HI>viz.</HI> the Elect. But Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> con|tradicts them, and joyns with me, in a&s;&s;erting that he died for every Individual of the human Race.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Now tell me wherein he differs from you: and how be &s;tates the Que&s;tion.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>He &s;tates it thus; <Q><HI>The true Que&s;tion, &s;ays he, is whether our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, who has wrought out &s;uch a &s;ufficient Redemption for all the World&mdash; Has not de&s;igned a di&s;tingui&s;hing Application of this Redemption to &s;ome, in effectual Calling, be|yond what he has de&s;igned for others: and whether he has not undertaken, not only to purcha&s;e for the&s;e the Privilege, that they &s;hall be &s;aved in ca&s;e they believe, but al&s;o to purcha&s;e for them and before upon them the Spirit of Grace, to put within them that Principle of Faith, whereby they certainly will believe and be &s;aved? &mdash; And whether the ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer has under|taken to be&s;tow the&s;e Benefits and Privileges upon all the re&s;t of Mankind, in the &s;ame manner as upon the Elect of GOD?</HI></Q> P. 51, 52. &mdash; Now to take no Notice of the Propriety and Elegance of this Language, viz. Chri&s;t dying for Men to be&s;tow upon them Privileges, and <HI>put within them a Principle of Faith;</HI> what I would ob&s;erve is, that he a&s;&s;erts that Chri&s;t has wrought out a <HI>&s;ufficient Redemption</HI> for all the World. Now this is all I de&s;ire: I have nothing more to contend for. I never taught univer&s;al Redemption in any other Sen&s;e; or in &s;tronger Terms. Only admit (as he does) that Chri&s;t's Redemption is &s;ufficient for all; and the Controver&s;y is at an End. For if the Redemption be &s;ufficient for all, then it mu&s;t be a Purcha&s;e of every Thing nece&s;&s;a|ry on GOD's Part for the Salvation of all. Then are all put into
<PB N="39" REF="006094_0036_1027848C46BEBEE0">a &s;alvable Condition; &s;o that they may be &s;aved if they will do what they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. And indeed if the Redemption of Chri&s;t don't contain &s;o much as this, it can be neither &s;ufficient, nor indeed any eternal Redemption at all. In a Word, that Redemption which is not &s;ufficient to &s;ave from Hell, is none of Chri&s;t's Re|demption. He never did his Work by the Halves. So that Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> has decided the Controver&s;y in our Favour, by &s;tating the Que&s;tion according to his own Mind.</P>
<P>Further I ob&s;erve, when he &s;ays, <Q><HI>Our Lord has not, in like Manner, undertaken to apply his &s;aving Benefits to all the re&s;t of the World,</HI></Q> P. 53. he means that Chri&s;t doth not apply it to them at all. No, nor never intended to apply it to them; as he goes on to argue; <Q><HI>For</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>if he had undertaken for all the World that they &s;hould come to him&mdash;he would certainly accompli&s;h his Undertaking&mdash;they would all be &s;anctified here, and glorified hereafter.</HI></Q> P. 53. You &s;ee then that he a&s;&s;erts that the&s;e Reprobates Chri&s;t never intended apply his Redemption to them. And is it po&s;&s;ible then for them ever to be the better for it? They can't apply it to them&s;elves, and Chri&s;t never intended to apply it to them; he &s;ays, and thinks he proves.</P>

<P><HI>I grant, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ny but the Elect to enjoy any Advantage by the Redemption of Chri&s;t, if what Mr.</HI> Dick|in&s;on <HI>has &s;aid be true, that Chri&s;t never de&s;igned, nor does he make Application of his Redemption to them.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore when Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> &s;ays, that Chri&s;t died for all in &s;uch a Sen&s;e, that they may be &s;aved if they will believe, but it is impo&s;&s;ible for them to believe unle&s;s he gives them Faith, and that he never de&s;igned, never purchas'd for them, nor does he be&s;tow it upon them: if this his Notion be ju&s;t, then it is certain Chri&s;t died not at all for them, or for their Sal|vation, no more than for the Salvation of all the Devils:&mdash; As Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, in the&s;e Words, <Q>Wherefore to force the&s;e Men to come over to us, or to lay a&s;ide their vain Pretences, and mere Di&s;gui&s;es of their real Sentiments. I demand, when they &s;ay, Chri&s;t died for all, &s;o far as to procure Pardon and Salvation for them if they will believe and repent, whether he did procure Pardon and Salvation on a Condition which it was po&s;&s;ible upon that A&s;&s;i&s;tance which he would vouch&s;afe them, to perform? Or only upon a Condition which to them was impo&s;&s;ible, for want of Grace &s;ufficient for them to perform?&mdash;If the latter only, it is
<PB N="40" REF="006094_0037_1027848F56829A90">certain that he died not at all them; for what is only done upon an impo&s;&s;ible Suppo&s;ition, is not done at all. It being the &s;ame Thing not to die at all for their Benefit, as to do it only on a Condition they cannot po&s;&s;ibly perform. But if he died to procure Pardon and Salvation for them, on a Condition, which by that Grace, which he was ready to vouch&s;afe to them, as well as to the Elect, they might be able to perform, then he died intentionally, and on his Part effectually, to procure Pardon and Salvation to them, as well as to the Elect, and &s;o all Mankind may be &s;aved, and them Chri&s;t mu&s;t have died for the Salvation of them all.</Q></P>

<P><HI>Well, but what &s;ay you to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e clo&s;e Que&s;tions he puts to you,</HI> viz <Q><HI>Did not be (Chri&s;t) originally intend the Redemption ju&s;t in the &s;ame Latitude and Extent with the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ual Applica|tion of it?&mdash;You won't venture to &s;uppo&s;e that he has chang'd his De&s;igns, or failed of Succe&s;s in his Intentions.&mdash;Pray, Sir, &s;peak out full and plain to the Purpo&s;e.</HI></Q> P. 55.</P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, that I will with all my Heart For I am never better pleas'd than when I can find out what my Antagoni&s;t would be at, that I may meet him full in the Face. Truth will never dodge and hide in ambiguous Terms.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve then in the fir&s;t Place, the&s;e Que&s;tions are founded upon one poor Fallacy and mi&s;erable Mi&s;take, that is, that the Application of Chri&s;t's Redemption to our Souls is &s;o entirely the Work of GOD, as that it don't at all depend upon the Free-Will of Man, whether it &s;hall be effectual to us, or not. This I &s;ay is a meer Fallacy and poor begging the Que&s;tion. For though Chri&s;t has fully redeemed every one of us, and &s;incere|ly tenders and applies this Salvation to us, both outwardly by his Word, and inwardly by his Spirit: yet may we either em|brace, or reject the offer'd Salvation. And as we do either, &s;o are we happy or mi&s;erable. Chri&s;t has done his Part both he purcha&s;ing and in applying his Salvation to Millions who are never actually &s;aved, becau&s;e they practically counted them&s;elves unworthy of eternal Life. In the Application of Chri&s;t's Re|demption, Man's wicked Will to peri&s;h often prevails again&s;t Chri&s;t's &s;incere Will of their Salvation. This is plain Scripture Matth. 23.37.

For I pre&s;ume, no Man will &s;ay that Chri&s;t di&s;&s;embled when he &s;pake the&s;e Words with Tears in his Eyes: and &s;aid, <HI>he would, and they would not.

P&s;al. 81.12. And dare any Man &s;ay, that GOD was not &s;erious in the&s;e Wi&s;hes? And yet this Will of GOD never took Effect, becau&s;e they were not willing to comply with GOD's Will. And if you don't al|low that GOD does not really will any Thing but what does come to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s which is Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI>'s Opinion con&s;ider what horrible Con&s;equences will follow. Then GOD is not willing that Men &s;hould obey him, when they di&s;obey; then GOD is not willing any more &s;hould repent and be &s;aved than are eventually &s;aved; then GOD's Will is as truly done while Men &s;in, as when they repent. And can any Man be &s;o unrea&s;on|able as to believe it? Thus having cleared the Way, I will give a full and plain An&s;wer to that clo&s;e Que&s;tion, <HI>viz. Did not Chri&s;t originally intend his Redemption ju&s;t in the &s;ame Latitude, and Extent with the actual Appplication of it?</HI> If by this you mean, did Chri&s;t originally intend to do more for the Conver|&s;ion of Mankind by applying his Redemption to them, than he has actually done, I an&s;wer No. For he has done all that was nece&s;&s;ary on his Part for the Application of his Salva|tion to every human Creature, even every Pagan on Earth would have the Opportunity to hear the Go&s;pel, if Chri&s;tians did what, it was the original Will and Intention of Chri&s;t, that they &s;hould do, i. e. preach the Go&s;pel to every Creature.</P>
<P>But then if by this trying Que&s;tion you mean, was it Chri&s;t's original De&s;ign and Will that more Men &s;hould have his Re|demption effectually applied to them and enjoy'd by them, than do eventually enjoy it? To this I an&s;wer, Yes: He willed that Millions &s;hould enter into his Joy, who yet through the Abu&s;e of their Free-Will are eternally &s;hut out.</P>

<P>No, Sir, I will not &s;uppo&s;e that GOD, or Chri&s;t have changed their De&s;igns, there is no Occa&s;ion for this bla&s;phemous Sugge&s;tion. <HI>Chri&s;t is the &s;ame Ye&s;terday, to Day and forever.</HI> As Chri&s;t's Will and De&s;ign originally was to purcha&s;e every Thing

<P>This is too childi&s;h and quibbling!

<P>No Sir, here you are a little mi&s;taken, this Conclu&s;ion don't follow from my Principle: becau&s;e GOD's drawing is not irre&s;i&s;table, or an Act of Almighty Power upon the Soul which cannot be re&s;i&s;ted. GOD has drawn Millions, who ne|ver were actually drawn &s;o as to come to Chri&s;t. So GOD drew the whole Body of the Jewi&s;h Nation, and yet they never were actually drawn to him, but for&s;ook him the Fountain of living Waters, Jer. xxxi. 3. <HI>With Loving-Kindne&s;s have I drawn thee.</HI> Ho&s;. xi. 4. <HI>I drew them with the Cords of a Man.</HI> This is &s;poken of all his profe&s;&s;ing People in general, every one of them had GOD's Drawings, and yet Thou&s;ands of them were never the nearer to GOD for that.

Chri&s;t's Death is to be con&s;ider'd in a twofold Re&s;pect. <HI>1&s;t,</HI> As to the Will of GOD in &s;ending his Son, and that was that he &s;hould die for the World, and the De&s;ign of the Son which was to give him&s;elf a Ran&s;om for all, and with Regard to the Virtue and Power of his Death, in the&s;e three Re&s;pects Chri&s;t died for every Man. But then, <HI>2dly,</HI> If you con&s;ider the Event of Chri&s;t's Death ari&s;ing from the different Behaviour of Mankind, &s;ome believing in him and &s;ome rejecting him and turning Enemies to his Cro&s;s; and thereupon the Fathers's and the Son's &s;ub&s;equent Will which was that none &s;hould enjoy the Fruit of Chri&s;t's Death to Eter|nity, but tho&s;e who comply with the End of his Death, repent and obey him: In this Sen&s;e Chri&s;t died only for Believers, only for his Sheep, only for his Church, <HI>i. e.</HI> he never intended or de&s;igned that any &s;hould be &s;aved by his Death, who don't comply with the Terms of that Salvation that his Death has purcha&s;ed. This Di&s;tinction well attended to, all the Mi&s;t which he has rais'd in both his Books vani&s;hes away in a Mo|ment.</P>
<P>And though he is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that I took no Notice of this Argument, yet it is &s;o far from being true, that I did in Fact an&s;wer it, and he has taken no Notice of my An&s;wer, which was in the&s;e Words, Pag. 41. <Q><HI>Have not I cho&s;en you Twelve, and one of you is a Devil? Judas</HI> was as much cho&s;en, yea and given to Chri&s;t of the Father, as the re&s;t.</Q> Joh. xvii. 12. <HI>Tho&s;e that thou gave&s;t me have I kept, and none of them is lo&s;t but the Son of Perdition.</HI> It is from hence evident, that being cho&s;en and given of the Father, don't denote an ab&s;olute Decree of their Salvation. And it is indeed a&s;toni&s;h|ing that he &s;hould quote this Expre&s;&s;ion of the Father's <HI>giving them to Chri&s;t,</HI> to prove his ab&s;olute Doctrine, and take no No|tice of <HI>Judas</HI> being lo&s;t who had been given to him, which at once utterly demoli&s;hes his Scheme.</P>

Of ELECTION.</P>
<P>Here the Que&s;tion is, Whether there be &s;uch a Thing &s;poken of in the holy Scripture, as a per&s;onal Election to Salvation without a Fore&s;ight of Faith and Per&s;everance in Well-doing? This I think, I did not deny in my Sermon; but only &s;eemed to doubt of it; for which Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> &s;aw fit to correct me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But Mr.</HI> Dickin&s;on <HI>&s;eems to think the Que&s;tion, is, Whether the Words Election and Elect never imply any more in the New-Te&s;tament, than merely enjoying the Privileges of the Go&s;pel.</HI> Page 61.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>He cho&s;e &s;o to &s;tate the Que&s;tion, becau&s;e this would give him &s;ome Room for di&s;puting. But when in his Remarks, he fixed a wrong Sen&s;e upon one of my Expre&s;&s;ions I don't &s;ay wilfully I explain'd my &s;elf fully in my Reply, in the&s;e Words, <Q>The Point I am to prove is this, though the Words Elect and Cho&s;en, Election and Choice, to Elect and Chu&s;e are u&s;ed in &s;everal different Sen&s;es in the holy Bible, and &s;ome Times the Elect denotes faithful Chri&s;tians, yet never do any of the&s;e Words imply an eternal ab&s;olute Prede&s;tination to Happine&s;s without Regard to Faith and Obedience: Neither is there any &s;uch Doctrine taught in the holy Scripture.</Q> P. 39. To this he replies, P. 62. <HI>It this not at all affect the Merits of the Cau&s;e, to enquire into the different Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;es in which the Words Elect and Cho&s;en, Election and Choice, to Elect and Chu&s;e are u&s;ed in the holy Bible.</HI>&mdash;This is &s;trange indeed! What is it no Matter what the&s;e Words &s;ignify and mean in the holy Bible! I thought all the Controver&s;y was about the Meaning of the&s;e Words, as they &s;tand in the Scripture. If I can but find out what the Holy Gho&s;t means, by &s;uch Words, I care not what this or that Sect mean by Election. But there was more Subtilty in this, than a cur&s;ory Reader would think of. For by not regarding that the Scripture u&s;es the Word Election in &s;everal different Sen&s;es, and that I endeavour'd to u&s;e it in the &s;ame Manner that the Holy Gho&s;t teaches, by this Piece of re&s;olved Negli|gence, he has gain'd &s;everal Triumphs, though indeed it is over Nobody. I will give you but one In&s;tance of it. P. 63. He &s;ays to me, <HI>You tell us that all whom GOD, foreknew, he fore&s;aw would he Chri&s;t's faithful Followers, if &s;o them all profe&s;&s;ing Chri|&s;tians do not belong to the Election of Grace, for all profe&s;&s;ing
<PB N="46" REF="006094_0043_102784A284B0AB18">Chri&s;tians are not Chri&s;t's faithful Followers. And therefore ac|cording to your own Interpretation this Text utterly &s;ubverts your Scheme:</HI> When in that very Paragraph I had told him that the Prede&s;tinate did not &s;ignify there meet Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity. Is not this now infinitely pretty! Has be not cut me down, and demoli&s;hed my Scheme with one Stroke; and all by re&s;olving not to regard what I &s;ay, nor what I mean.</P>
<P>I have read a few Di&s;putes in the Cour&s;e of my Life, but I never &s;aw any Thing like this. I don't mean, that this is the weake&s;t, no, it is crafty enough: but I am at a lo&s;s to find where the Hone&s;ty of it lies. I proved by &s;undry Texts that the Word Elect and Election did not denote an ab&s;olute Decree to &s;ave this or that Man, but often it means all Chri&s;tians in general, and &s;ometimes &s;incerely good Men. I let him know that I owned GOD's eternal Decree to &s;ave all tho&s;e whom he fore&s;aw would per&s;evere in Faith till Death; &s;o that his Work lay fair before him, which was to prove an eternal Election without a Fore&s;ight of Faith and good Works. At this my Friend was &s;en&s;ible, he could make but a mean Figure: But an An&s;wer he mu&s;t write in &s;ome Shape or other. He there upon concludes upon this Device, <HI>viz.</HI> to make his Reader be|lieve that my Opinion is, that the Word <HI>Prede&s;tination</HI> in the 17th Article, the Words <HI>Prede&s;tinate, Elect</HI> and <HI>Election</HI> in holy Scripture never mean or import more than meet Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity: Such a Whim as never entered my Heart. And altho' when I perceived him beginning to play at this Game in his fir&s;t Book, I entered my Prote&s;t again&s;t this unfair Deal|ing, and told him I under&s;tood the 17th Article, as meaning an eternal Decree, but not an ab&s;olute and unconditional one, and in the &s;ame Sen&s;e I under&s;tood &s;everal Texts in the holy Bible. But all that I could &s;ay, avail'd nothing, he was re&s;olved to mi&s;under&s;tand, and mi&s;repre&s;ent me; and by virtue of this ho|ne&s;t Re&s;olution, he has made &s;ad and <HI>Mongrel</HI> Work of it, as he calls it; but has not an&s;wered one Argument that I ad|vanced, not done any Thing like it.</P>

<P><HI>But he has cited &s;ome Texts a-now, as</HI> Acts 2.23. <HI>And challenges you to deny if you dare, that GOD has decreed all the wicked Things that ever were done. This I think is his Mean|ing; for &s;ays he,</HI> <Q><HI>Was the mo&s;t atrocious Wickedne&s;s, that ever was committed, what GOD's Hand and Coun&s;el had determined before?

<PB N="47" REF="006094_0044_102784A42CC22528">determine, he wills and was plea&s;ed with?

<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir I chearfully accept the Challenge, to vindicate the moral Character of our infinitely good GOD, from &s;uch horrid Sugge&s;tions as though he decreed, will'd, and was plea&s;ed with all the wicked Deeds done by Men and Devils. Now then when it is &s;aid, Acts 2.23. <HI>Him, being delivered by the determinate Council and Fore-knowledge of GOD, ye have taken, and with wicked Hands have crucified and &s;lain.</HI> And Acts 4.27, 28. <HI>For of a Truth again&s;t thy holy Child Je&s;us, whom thou ha&s;t an|ointed, both</HI> Herod <HI>and</HI> Pontius Pilate, <HI>with the Gentiles, and the People of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>were gathered together for to do what&s;oever thy Hand and thy Coun&s;el determined before to he done.</HI> The&s;e Words don't denote, that GOD decreed, will'd, or was plea&s;ed with <HI>Judas</HI> his being &s;o convetous as to betray Chri&s;t; the Jews be|ing &s;o malicious as to pro&s;ecute him; or <HI>Herod</HI>'s being &s;o inju|rious and profane as to &s;et him at nought, or <HI>Pilate</HI>'s being &s;o unju&s;t as to condemn him; none of all the&s;e wicked Humours and Deeds were decreed, will'd by, or plea&s;ing to GOD, who infinitely hates, and therefore can't decree a wicked Deed: But all Things being eternally pre&s;ent to his infinite Mind, and he fore&s;eeing that <HI>Judas</HI> would be &s;o convetous as to betray Chri&s;t, if he had an Opportunity, and that the Jews would be envious and &s;piteful enough to murder him, and <HI>Pilate</HI> would be &s;o un|ju&s;t as to condemn the Innocent; what his Coun&s;el determined was, that Chri&s;t &s;hould come into their Hands, and be left in their Power, when he knew they would crucify him. Thus GOD without decreeing the lea&s;t wicked Deed by his infinite Knowledge and Wi&s;dom has brought the greate&s;t Good out of the greate&s;t Wickedne&s;s, only fore&s;een, not decreed. In a Word, GOD fore&s;ees wicked Deeds, and decrees to over-rule them &s;o as to bring Good out of them, but he does not decree them. Thus, I think, I have in full, though in &s;hort, an&s;wered Mr. Pre&s;ident's Challenge, and vindicated our heavenly Father from the horrid Su&s;picion of his being the Decreer or Willer of &s;in|ful Deeds.</P>

<P>Di&s;obedience was not, could not be the Thing, that the&s;e Men were appointed to; for it cannot be GOD's Will, to ap|point Men to di&s;obey, his Will.

That which is not, and has no Being cannot be made &s;ure in any Sen&s;e. It is therefore
<PB N="49" REF="006094_0046_102784AC26377A50">evident, that St. <HI>Peter</HI> thought, they had every one of them an Election, and all were elected in his Sen&s;e, and as he u&s;ed the Word, for it is ab&s;urd to exhort to make that &s;ure, that we &s;uppo&s;e, has no Exi&s;tence, neither is, nor ever can be. Be&s;ides, I ob&s;erved, that GOD only could make his Decree &s;ure or firm, and therefore we mu&s;t not think that the Apo&s;tle would exhort them to make it &s;ure, which was the Work of GOD alone.

<P>A poor Excu&s;e indeed, but the be&s;t he could make.

This is not the only Point in which he has betray'd his Cau&s;e. I think he has abandon'd it under every Head. When the Argument comes to a Clo&s;e, he &s;eems to have entirely forgotten that there is any Di&s;pute between us; but where there is no Need of his Help, he is liberal of his Words to Exce&s;s: And will afford us almo&s;t a Sermon upon a Subject wherein we are agreed.&mdash;I will give you another In&s;tance I &s;aid in my Sermon, <Q>Though eternal Life is GOD's Gift, yet he be&s;tows it after the Manner of a Reward.</Q> P. 31.&mdash;To

<P>Yes, this all Chri&s;tians profe&s;s to do, and he &s;peaks of them according to their Profe&s;&s;ion. As it may be truly &s;aid of Mankind, they are rational Creatures, this Character is ju&s;tly a&s;|cribed to Men in general, and yet &s;ad Experience teaches, that a great many Men are very unrea&s;onable. So what St. <HI>Peter</HI> here &s;ays, is the true Character of Chri&s;tians in general, as they &s;tood di&s;tingui&s;hed from the unbelieving World, though (to our Shame) it mu&s;t be own'd, we don't all live up to our Character and holy Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>This, and many other Texts are a full Proof of what I pretend to in my Sermon.

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed I did not. If I had taken &s;uch a Liberty with him, as he has done with me, I &s;hould have had very little Rea&s;on to complain, if he had called me by an ill Name, which I don't de&s;ire to mention. But the wor&s;t I &s;hall &s;ay is this, he has mi&s;took the whole Affair. I as firmly believe all this as he did, <HI>viz.</HI> That Mankind are degenerate, and that we are naturally &s;trongly inclined to Sin&mdash; And therefore I needed not that impertinent Multiplicity of Words, either to inform or convince me.</P>
<P>What I called a Fable, was the Account that he gave, of GOD's entering into Covenant with <HI>Adam,</HI> which as far as I could under&s;tand him was to this Purpo&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> That it <HI>Adam</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="006094_0051_102A78CD405AD5E8">would forbear to eat of the forbidden Fruit for a Day, or a Week, or Month, or a Year, I could not learn from him how long exactly the Trial was to la&s;t, but he intimated, it was to be hat a very &s;hort Term, and then all Danger, all Trial and Pro|bation for <HI>Adam,</HI> and his numerous I&s;&s;ue was to be over, and none of them was to be put to the Trouble of a per&s;onal Pro|bation. This he &s;uppos'd was un&s;peakably better than to be Probationers our&s;elves. And who would not rather chu&s;e this Method, and leave all in the Hands of <HI>Adam,</HI> than be for ever upon Probation, in one's own Per&s;on? this I did then and do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill call a <HI>Fable,</HI> it has not only no Foundation in the Word of GOD, but is there plainly contradicted; as I have proved in another Place. Be&s;ides it is in many Re&s;pects a mo&s;t ab&s;urd Scheme. To name but one. This Hypothe&s;is makes <HI>Adam</HI>'s Righteou&s;ne&s;s infinitely more valuable and efficacious than that of Chri&s;t's the <HI>Lord from Heaven:</HI> For according to Mr. <HI>Dic|kin&s;on,</HI> if <HI>Adam</HI> had kept but one Precept, and that for a &s;hort Time, that Obedience would have been of &s;uch infinite Virtue, as to &s;ecure eternal Happine&s;s to him&s;elf and to every &s;ingle Child of his for ever. Whereas Chri&s;t's mo&s;t holy Life and dreadful Death could &s;ave but a Part of Mankind: Neither could it &s;ave one of them, but upon Condition of their own Faith and &s;incere Repentance, whereas <HI>Adam</HI>'s Righteou&s;ne&s;s was of &s;uch Virtue as to &s;ave all, ab&s;olutely and unconditionally: Such Whims, I confe&s;s, I don't believe. And I wonder, how tho&s;e Divines who pretend to make the Scripture the Rule of their Faith can give Heed to &s;uch Fables.</P>
<P>The Occa&s;ion to &s;peak of Original Sin which Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> catched at in my Sermon was this, I &s;aid, that it is not a &s;uffi|cient Vindication that &s;uch Men make of GOD's Mercy towards the Souls of Men, to &s;ay as they do, that GOD leaves them without &s;ufficient Help, under a Nece&s;&s;ity of being wicked and mi&s;erable for ever, becau&s;e <HI>Adam</HI> lo&s;t their Power to be|lieve and repent&mdash;And this I am per&s;uaded is mo&s;t true and very con&s;i&s;tent with the Church of <HI>England</HI> Doctrine of Ori|ginal Sin. That GOD &s;hould command us to do, what we cannot do without his Grace and puni&s;h us eternally for not doing it, while he was not plea&s;ed to give us nece&s;&s;ary Help; this, I &s;ay, is to charge our heavenly Father with Cruelty, and therefore GOD forbid that I &s;hould do it. They are mi&s;taken, when they &s;ay we lo&s;t our Power in <HI>Adam,</HI> and that GOD may ju&s;tly damn us for not repenting and not making
<PB N="55" REF="006094_0052_102784BC27A6B220">our&s;elves a new Heart, tho' he does not now give us Power to repent, becau&s;e he once have us that Power, and <HI>Adam</HI> lo&s;t it for us. For as Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> ob&s;erves, <Q><HI>Adam,</HI> when he was fir&s;t created had no &s;uch Ability that in ca&s;e he &s;hould fall he could ri&s;e again by Frith and Repentance.&mdash;Therefore, we never lo&s;t any &s;uch Power in him. But &s;uppo&s;ing we lo&s;t the Gift of Faith and Repentance in <HI>Adam,</HI> which is certainly fal&s;e, yet you mu&s;t remember, the Go&s;pel is a gracious Tender of Pardon to &s;allen Creatures: Now to pro|mi&s;e Pardon to a lap&s;ed Per&s;on upon a Condition, is in Effect for GOD to &s;ay, he will not impute to him his former Fault, but will deal with him according to his future Car|riage, to which a conditional Promi&s;e always has a Re|lation; but if he &s;till requires what he knows the fir&s;t Fault hath render'd utterly impo&s;&s;ible to be done by him he &s;till imputes that Fault, and puni&s;hes him at the &s;ame Time for it as he pretendeth to remit it; and &s;urely it is no &s;mall Matter to render GOD &s;o delu&s;ory and deceitful, &s;o in&s;incere and hypocritical, as this Opinion makes him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Should a Phy&s;ician come to a Patient who&s;e Stomach was &s;o weaken'd through his Intemperance and Lu&s;t, that it could bear no &s;trong Meat, and his Feet &s;o enfeebled that he could &s;carce walk from his Couch to his Bed &s;ide, and profe&s;s an earne&s;t De&s;ire to cure his Di&s;temper, and promi&s;e him Re|covery, provided he would follow his Pre&s;criptions, might it not rea&s;onably be expected he &s;hould pre&s;cribe &s;uch Means for his Recovery, that it was po&s;&s;ible for him in this Condition to make U&s;e of? If then he &s;hould enjoin him to eat and to dige&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t Meats, and walk &s;ome Hours in the Fields, becau&s;e he formerly could do &s;o, before he fell into this Di&s;|ability and Feeblene&s;s; would not all Men pronounce him a deluding Cheat, and one that hypocritically and in&s;incerely pretended his Recovery, and promi&s;ed it with equal Vanity and Folly, intending only to in&s;ult over his pre&s;ent Mi&s;ery; And yet this is the Repre&s;entation of our gracious GOD, in this Affair which the&s;e Men offer to us. For the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us is the Phy&s;ician which GOD &s;ent to heal our Natures of the Di&s;ability which we had contracted by the Fall, and to pro|mi&s;e us a Remedy, which if we would u&s;e, we &s;hould reco|ver, that or a better Life than that from which we fell, and to threaten the &s;evere&s;t Judgments if we neglect &s;o to do.
<PB N="56" REF="006094_0053_102784C38C942B48">But then, if he only doth promi&s;e this Recovery on &s;uch a Condition as that very Fall hath render'd us unable to per|form, and which he never will enable us to perform, mu&s;t he not be guilty of the like Hypocri&s;y and In&s;incerity in pro|pounding to us an impo&s;&s;ible Remedy, and in&s;ult only over the Mi&s;ery of his Creatures whil&s;t he pretends Kindne&s;s to them? And how unrea&s;onable is it to impute &s;uch Deceit, Fal&s;hood, In&s;incerity and Inju&s;tice to a good and righteous GOD, which we cannot but abhor in Man? For &s;ure, mo&s;t graciou&s;ly to exhort, mo&s;t affectionately to invite, mo&s;t ear|ne&s;tly by the greate&s;t Promi&s;es and Threats to move us to repent and believe, when at the &s;ame Time he is mo&s;t firmly purpo&s;ed to withhold the Means, by which alone we can do either, is to in&s;ult over his mi&s;erable Crea|tures in the highe&s;t Manner: And to deal thus with Myriads for the Sin of <HI>Adam,</HI> is, as it were, to medi|tate Revenge upon the greate&s;t Part of his Po&s;terity to the World's End for what was only done by the fir&s;t Man: yet, it is to do this under Pretence of Love and kind Affec|tion and a vehement De&s;ire and Concern that they &s;hould e&s;cape the Mi&s;ery that very Sin had brought upon them, and recover the Felicity they had lo&s;t by it, by tho&s;e very Means he doth pre&s;cribe; And yet to leave them under an utter Incapacity to perform tho&s;e Means: Which to con|ceive and a&s;&s;ert of our mo&s;t gracious GOD, is highly to di&s;|honour and bla&s;pheme his &s;acred Maje&s;ty, and repre&s;ent him &s;o unto the World, as even the wor&s;t of Men would not endure to be &s;o repre&s;ented.</Q></P>
<P>Thus we are entered upon that Inquiry, whether GOD does afford the internal A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Spirit in &s;uch a Mea&s;ure to all under the Go&s;pel as to put them under a Po&s;|&s;ibility of obtaining Salvation? this I affirm, and he denies.</P>

<P>By this Text Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> attempts to prove almo&s;t every Thing Reprobation; no real Redemption for the Reprobates, and no &s;ufficient Grace for them; becau&s;e GOD hated them &s;o as to hide Salvation from them, and Chri&s;t rejoiced and was thank|ful for it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore be very particular in my enquiring into the Meaning of it.

<P>Now that the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, that mighty Lover of Mankind, who came down from Heaven to &s;ave Souls, who left the high|e&s;t Glory for the Depth of Mi&s;ery, and for&s;ook the Bo&s;om of his Father to hang upon a Cro&s;s, to deliver us from Hell and bring, us to his Joys: That he &s;hould be &s;o mightily plea&s;ed and rejoice in Spirit, when he &s;aw that Multitudes of excellent wi&s;e and prudent Per&s;ons were &s;o blinded and hardned as to reject the Go&s;pel, their &s;ole Remedy and the only Way to Salvation: That he who did &s;o much to &s;ave Men, &s;hould with tran&s;porting Joy give Thanks to his Father, becau&s;e he had &s;o ordered the Matter that the wi&s;er and more prudent Part of Mankind were certainly to be lo&s;t and damned for ever; and that the Father who had &s;worn by his own Life, that he delighted not in the

In this Sen&s;e Mr. <HI>Dic|kin&s;on</HI> plainly under&s;tands it, or el&s;e when he &s;o often cites it, he does it impertinently. Here then let us enquire, 1. Who are the Wi&s;e and Prudent, and who are the Babes? 2. What is meant by GOD's hiding the My&s;teries of Chri&s;tian|ity from the Wi&s;e and Prudent? 3. What was the true Occa|&s;ion of Chri&s;t's rejoicing and giving Thanks? To begin with the <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> by the Wi&s;e and Prudent are meant the Doctors of the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the Rulers of the Nation: The&s;e were the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate Enemies to Chri&s;t, and deaf to all the Rea|&s;ons that could be offer'd in Defence of his divine Mi&s;&s;ion. Hence they &s;aid, <HI>Have any of the Rulers or Phari&s;ees believed on him?</HI> John vii. 46. Now the&s;e Men are called wi&s;e and pru|dent, not becau&s;e they were really &s;o, but becau&s;e they vainly e&s;teemed them&s;elves wi&s;e and prudent; and were generally &s;o accounted. But had they been wi&s;e and prudent indeed, they would have hone&s;tly enquired into Chri&s;t's Preten&s;ions, and have di|ligently examin'd the Te&s;timonials he bro't with him from Hea|ven, and &s;o would have been convinc'd of his being the Chri&s;t.&mdash; And by Babes are meant the ignorant and unlearn'd common People, &s;ometimes &s;tiled the Poor, who had the Go&s;pel preach'd to them. Now the common People among the <HI>Jews</HI> were like Babes or Children, in that they were more free from Pre|judices, more humble and teachable, than their wi&s;e Men; and &s;o were better prepared to be wrought upon by Chri&s;t's Preach|ing, and better di&s;po&s;ed to receive the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>The common People here called Babes, were in Chri&s;t's Time &s;o well di&s;pos'd towards Chri&s;tianity, that had their Teach|ers and Rulers let them alone, and not violently oppos'd it, they would have readily believed in Chri&s;t, &s;o mightily were they affected with his a&s;toni&s;hing Works and heavenly Doctrine. But the proud and ob&s;tinate Wretches conceiting them&s;elves wi&s;e and prudent, would neither go into Chri&s;t's Kingdom them|&s;elves, nor by their Good-Will &s;uffer the common People to go in. And it was ea&s;ier to reveal the Go&s;pel to <HI>Babes,</HI> i. e. the humble ignorant <HI>Vulgar,</HI> than to convince them of its Truth.

<PB N="60" REF="006094_0057_102784D12EBC2838">GOD hide the Go&s;pel from the&s;e Men? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> certainly GOD did nothing with a De&s;ign, or on Purpo&s;e to hide the Go&s;pel from them, for this would be directly contrary to the Nature of GOD and the Declaration of his Word, GOD is good and merciful and di&s;pos'd to do all that is fit to make his Creatures happy, but to do Things on Purpo&s;e to blind and harden Men in Sin to their eternal Ruin, is as contrary to Goodne&s;s and Mercy as Darkne&s;s is to Light, and the Scripture a&s;&s;ures us that GOD would have all Men to repent and come to the Know|ledge of the Truth: Not indeed that GOD wills this with an irre&s;i&s;tible Will by which he made the World, but he &s;o wills the Salvation of all Men as to do all that is nece&s;&s;ary on his Part, even for the bringing of every <HI>Jew, Tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> or <HI>Pagan</HI> to the Knowledge of his Truth, and that all the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts</HI> in the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Soldonia</HI> have not the Knowledge of the Way to Salva|tion, of whom Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> &s;peaks, is not from any Deficiency in GOD's Good-Will towards them, but from Men's neglect|ing their Part in publi&s;hing and &s;upporting GOD's revealed Truth. But for GOD to do any Thing on Purpo&s;e to hide his Truth from Men, and lead them into damning Mi&s;takes, this is far, very far from being agreeable to what St. <HI>Peter</HI> &s;ays, 2 Pet. iii. 9. <HI>The Lord is not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come to Repentance.</HI> Thus then <HI>Secondly,</HI> Though GOD does nothing which can lay Men under a Nece&s;&s;ity not to &s;ee the Things of their eternal Peace, yet it is certain, that no Men will &s;ee them, but only &s;uch as love the Truth; or though GOD does nothing to <HI>hide</HI> the Go&s;pel from Men, yet no Men will &s;ee &s;o much of its Excellency as to embrace it &s;incerely, un|le&s;s they are willing to know and do the Will of GOD. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour was wont often to &s;ay, <HI>He that hath Ears to hear, let him hear,</HI> which denotes that though all Men have na|tural Capacities &s;ufficient to receive all nece&s;&s;ary Truth, yet there were many who were &s;o full of Prejudices and Self Will, that they had no Ears to hear, that is, they had no Inclination towards the Truth: They hated it becau&s;e it cro&s;s'd their Hu|mours and former Notions, &s;o that their Want of Ears to hear and Eyes to &s;ee, was not becau&s;e GOD never gave the&s;e to them, but becau&s;e they would not u&s;e them: But when they had Ears they were like the deaf Adder who &s;toppeth her Ear: &s;o they &s;top their Ears and will not hear the Voice of the Rea|&s;oner, let him rea&s;on ever &s;o wi&s;ely, their Deafne&s;s and Blind|ne&s;s is the Effect of their own Perver&s;ene&s;s, ju&s;t thus it was with

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I an&s;wer, according to the Language of the holy Bible, oftentimes GOD is &s;aid, to do &s;uch Things, which he neither decreed, nor willed, nor in any Degree effected by his Power; but only &s;uffered it, to come to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s, when he could by his infi|nite Power have hindered it. Nothing can come to pa&s;s unle&s;s GOD &s;ee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it to permit it, not one Sparrow fails, nor an Hair of our Head falls to the Ground, without the Notice of our heavenly Father, no Event can befall us though ever &s;o ca&s;ual, or ever &s;o much Chance-medly, but what GOD fore&s;ees and permits; &s;eeing therefore GOD &s;uperintends all Events either ordering, or permitting and over-ruling them for Good, there|fore in a figurative Way &s;uch Things are often a&s;crib'd to GOD which he neither willed nor effected, but only &s;uffered to be done when he could by his infinite Power have hinder'd them: As Prov. xvi. 4. <HI>The Lord hath made all Things for him&s;elf;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or <HI>to an&s;wer one another,</HI> as it might be rendered more agreeable to the Hebrew.</NOTE> <HI>yea even the wicked for the Day of Evil.</HI> Which certainly does not mean, that GOD makes Men wicked: But they make them&s;elves wicked, and the Lord &s;o orders all Events, as that they &s;hall mo&s;t certainly come into the <HI>Day of Evil,</HI> that is, the Day of Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Again, It is &s;aid 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxiv. 1. The Lord moved <HI>David</HI> to number the People. Now it is evident from other Texts, that
<PB N="62" REF="006094_0059_102784D79E9E3DD8">all which GOD did, was to permit <HI>Satan</HI> and his own Vanity to move him to do it. So when it is &s;aid in this Text, that GOD <HI>hid</HI> the Go&s;pel from the&s;e Men it don't mean, that GOD had not given them Grace &s;ufficient to enable them to &s;ee the Things of their eternal Peace, or that he had le&s;t them under an ab&s;olute Incapacity to be convinced of the Truth of the Go&s;pel and to believe in Chri&s;t; for then they would not have been at all to blame for not &s;eeing, and not believing: for who can blame a blind Man becau&s;e he don't &s;ee, or a deaf Man becau&s;e he can't hear, when GOD has not given them Power to do it? And yet Chri&s;t often reproved and upbraided the&s;e Men for their Unbelief and Hardne&s;s of Heart; which he would never have done if he had &s;uppo&s;ed, as Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> did, that GOD never had given them Sufficiency of his Grace to enable them to &s;ee and believe; or that GOD had never put it in their Power to receive him.</P>
<P N="3">3. We come now to the la&s;t Enquiry. What was the Occa|&s;ion of Chri&s;t's Rejoicing and giving Thanks; was it becau&s;e the Go&s;pel was hid from the Wi&s;e and Prudent, or was it be|cau&s;e it was <HI>reveal'd to Babes?</HI> Or did he rejoice in and give Thanks for both? I an&s;wer; No, it was not for both: It was only becau&s;e the Go&s;pel was revealed to Babes, that Chri&s;t rejoiced and gave Thanks. Men's Blindne&s;s, Unbelief and Damnation are no Occa&s;ion of Joy to any but the cur&s;ed Fiends of Hell, and tho&s;e who are like them: And it is horrid Bla&s;|phemy to &s;uppo&s;e that our Saviour was guilty of &s;o much Ill-Nature, as to give Thanks, and rejoice when he ob&s;erved that Men were going blindly to Hell; and the Go&s;pel's being HID from &s;ome, is here put in Oppo&s;ition to its being REVEALED to others, only that the former may illu&s;trate the latter, as black &s;et oppo&s;ite to white, makes the latter appear the whiter; this is a common Thing in the Scripture. But I'll only repeat that Parallel Text I gave to Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> before, but he was too wi&s;e and prudent, to learn from me, Rom. vi. 17. St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays thus, <HI>GOD be thanked, that ye were the Servants of Sin, but ye have obeyed from the Heart that Form of Doctrine,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash; Now you may as well argue from this, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> was thankful that the&s;e Men had &s;pent all the former Part of their Life in the Ser|vitude of Sin, as Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> does from this Text that Chri&s;t was not willing to die effectually on his Part for <HI>&s;ome,</HI> nor had GOD elected the&s;e <HI>(Some)</HI> nor was he willing to give &s;ufficient Grace to the&s;e <HI>(Some)</HI> becau&s;e Chri&s;t thanked his heavenly Fa|ther
<PB N="63" REF="006094_0060_102784DCB00D4500">for HIDING the Benefits of his Redemption from <HI>Some,</HI> when in Truth Chri&s;t never did thank GOD for any &s;uch <HI>Thing,</HI> but it was his unhappy Mi&s;take which he too long per&s;i&s;ted in. I have been the longer upon this Text, hoping I may contribute &s;omething, to prevent its being &s;o horribly abu&s;ed for the future (which GOD grant) I mu&s;t be &s;horter upon what follows.</P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though Conver&s;ion is called a Creation; and good Men are GOD's Workman&s;hip, yet this Metaphor does not imply that they are meerly pa&s;&s;ive in Conver&s;ion; for though it be true in a proper Creation, that GOD does all, and the Creature can neither hinder or promote its own Creation; yet Mr. <HI>Dic|kin&s;on</HI> him&s;elf owns, that we can hinder or promote our own Conver&s;ion: The Metaphor mu&s;t not be forced to this Sen&s;e, which is plainly fal&s;e. You allow that a good Man when fal|len into a particular Sin, does &s;omething towards his ri&s;ing a|gain; and his Repentance is not the Work of GOD alone.

<P>Some by a natural Man under&s;tand, a &s;en&s;ual Man, one who is a perfect Slave to his Lu&s;ts, whether Intemperance, Un|cleane&s;s or Covetou&s;ne&s;s; now &s;uch an Epicure is &s;o be&s;otted with Vice, &s;o infatuated with his Lu&s;ts, that he has no Heart for Religion, no Reli&s;h of, no Ta&s;te for &s;piritual and heavenly Things, they appear in&s;ipid and fooli&s;h to him.

<P>This is very true, but Nothing to his Purpo&s;e, becau&s;e GOD from Heaven gives it to Millions of Men to repent and believe, who never do actually repent and believe, but die in their Sins; becau&s;e they will not accept and, improve what GOD given them, but receive his Grace in vain. &mdash; Doth not Chri&s;t tell the <HI>Jews,</HI> Joh. vi. 32, 33. <HI>My Father giveth you the true Bread from Heaven;</HI> yet many of them never had it, ne|ver eat it, never believed in Chri&s;t, &s;o never were the better for GOD's Gift. So GOD gives us our daily Bread, but many mu&s;t &s;tarve, if they don't labour for their Bread. The Scripture is mo&s;t expre&s;s. GOD purges Thou&s;ands who are never purg|ed, becau&s;e they will not be purged; GOD draws Myriads, who never come, becau&s;e they re&s;i&s;t his Drawings. The Good|ne&s;s of GOD leads &s;ome Men to Repentance, who yet are ne|ver lead, but continue to trea&s;ure up Wrath.&mdash;I grant that &s;ome Times &s;uch Phra&s;es GOD's giving a Heart to perceive, to re|pent or to believe, do denote the de&s;ired Effect, and that the Per&s;on does actually perceive or repent, but this is not always their Meaning, that mu&s;t be judged of by the Context.</P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, as well as &s;everal other Texts I have now con&s;ider'd he has likewi&s;e improved again&s;t Dr. <HI>John&s;on;</HI> now, that you may &s;ee that all the Arguments your Party can advance were an&s;wered long ago, I will reply in the Words of <HI>Clagget</HI> again&s;t <HI>Owen.</HI> <Q>Now, &s;ays he, that the&s;e Words do not imply that GOD is the &s;ole Agent in Conver&s;ion, is plain from hence, that we are exhorted in the Ver&s;e immediately preceeding <HI>to work out our Salvation with Fear and Trembling;</HI> and it is brought as a Rea&s;on why we ought to do this, becau&s;e it is <HI>GOD that works in us both to will and to do.</HI> Now it would be very &s;trange, that GOD &s;hould u&s;e that for a Rea&s;on to us why we &s;hould work out our own Salvation, which is on the other Hand a clear Rea&s;on why we <HI>need not.</HI> And yet this is the very Ca&s;e if GOD's working in us be &s;uppos'd to imply that he is the &s;ole Cau&s;e of Conver&s;ion. For if GOD be the <HI>&s;ole</HI> Cau&s;e of Conver&s;ion, if he does all, then there is nothing left for us to do; and then to what Purpo&s;e is it that we &s;hould work? If GOD worketh not, our working will not profit us, and if he doth work, our Negligence, nay our utmo&s;t Re&s;i&s;tance, cannot hurt us; for this Work of GOD is &s;uppos'd to be irre&s;i&s;table, and con&s;equently uncapable of being fru&s;trated by the &s;toute&s;t Oppo&s;ition we are able to make again&s;t it. This Con&s;ideration therefore that <HI>GOD worketh in us,</HI> can (upon this Suppo&s;ition) be no Argument why a Man &s;hould him&s;elf work; but a plain Argument to the contrary; and therefore the Apo&s;tle would never have u&s;ed it, much le&s;s would he have added with Fear and Trem|bling; for there can be no Cau&s;e of Fear and Trembling if we cannot mi&s;carry through our own Negligence, which if GOD be the &s;ole Cau&s;e of Conver&s;ion, we certainly cannot. But it will be enough to expo&s;e this Notion, nakedly to &s;et down the Apo&s;tle's Di&s;cour&s;e, as it mu&s;t run according to this Interpretation. Thus then he argues; I a&s;&s;ure you all to whom I write, that GOD work<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> in you all Things that appertain to your Obedience and Salvation, and that by an irre&s;i&s;table Operation, &s;o as that it &s;hall not be po&s;&s;ible for you not to will, or to do whatever is nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation: Therefore I &s;eriou&s;ly exhort you to be very careful and that with Fear and Trembling, that you both will and do &s;uch Things left you mi&s;carry through your own Negligence and Di&s;obedience. Than which nothing can be more ab&s;ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> It is plain then that by GOD's working in us, no more can

<P><HI>The next Text is</HI> Rom. viii. 7.8. <HI>The carnal Mind is En|mity again&s;t GOD: for it is not &s;ubject to the Law of GOD, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the Fle&s;h cannot plea&s;e GOD.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be in the Fle&s;h, is to be under the Dominion of Vice, to be a Slave to Sin, and it don't import, that they who are in the Fle&s;h cannot come out of that wretched State, that they who are wicked can't become good Men by the Grace GOD ten|ders to them. It only &s;ignifies that &s;o far as they act from a vi|cious or fle&s;hly Mind, &s;o far their Actions are di&s;plea&s;ing to GOD; as when it is &s;aid of a good Man, that he &s;inneth not neither indeed can he &s;in; it only means &s;o far as he is good, and acts up to his Character, he cannot &s;in. Not but that a Man who is a Child of GOD can and does &s;in, but then he acts not as a Child of GOD, but incon&s;i&s;tently with his Character. So when it is &s;aid, he that is in the Fle&s;h cannot plea&s;e GOD, it means, that whatever he does by Virtue of this fle&s;hly or vi|cious Mind is offen&s;ive to GOD, but at the &s;ame Time he might act contrary to the Fle&s;h, and mortify it by divine Help, and &s;o far as he does &s;o, he plea&s;es GOD, and as &s;oon as ever he has got the Ma&s;tery over the Fle&s;h, he is a good Man and in the Spirit; but yet is &s;till liable to be too much influenced by the Fle&s;h, and &s;o far as he is &s;o, he offends GOD, although he be a good Man. So that &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions in the Scripture are im|pertinently cited to prove that a Sinner can do nothing towards his own Conver&s;ion; or that his Conver&s;ion don't at all depend upon his concurring with Grace.</P>

For his Power which was his Father's, was &s;uperior to all other Powers: it is evident, that Chri&s;t here &s;peaks of plucking them away by Violence: not a Word here of their not being able wilfully to de&s;ert him. It is one of the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable Notions that ever entered into the Heart of

<P><HI>Well, I believe you will not &s;o ea&s;ily get clear of the la&s;t Text,</HI> Rom. xi. 29. <HI>The Gifts and Calling of GOD are without Repentance.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is certainly &s;poken of the Body of the Jewi&s;h Nation, which at that very Time were given up by GOD to Blindne&s;s of Mind and Hardne&s;s of Heart; in which they have continued from that Day to this, and it only denotes that GOD has not &s;o ca&s;t them off but that he will receive them again, upon their believing and repenting. And it will not hold al|ways true, that GOD does not repent of, or revoke his Gifts be&s;towed upon Men: how often does he give and take away. And to &s;ay this holds true of coverting Grace, is only to beg the Thing in Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>And now will you tell me in a few Words, the Sub&s;tance of what Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> has &s;aid in An&s;wer to what I urged from. GOD's &s;aying to the Jews, <HI>Becau&s;e I have purged thee, and thou wa&s;t not purged, and what could have been done more to my Vine|yard that I have not done in it? wherefore when I looked that it &s;hould bring forth Grapes, brought it forth wild Grapes?</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I think the Sub&s;tance of what he has &s;aid to it is this: that GOD did not complain becau&s;e they did not u&s;e &s;pecial Grace, for that he never gave them, but becau&s;e they did not well improve common Grace.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am per&s;waded this was his Meaning; and can you be|lieve it is true, that GOD did not expect, that they &s;hould love him with all their Heart and &s;erve him with all their Souls? Did GOD expect any Thing le&s;s from his peculiar People, than that they &s;hould be a holy People as he was a holy GOD. The&s;e were the <HI>Grapes</HI> which he expected; and for Want of the&s;e he complains, and to produce the&s;e, he declares he had done all that was nece&s;&s;ary on his Part.</P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>That this is fal&s;e, I dare appeal to your own Con&s;cience. Have you as full a Belief of the Go&s;pel, as you have that two and three make five? Have you no more Doubts about any Truths of Chri&s;tianity, than you have whether Five be a le&s;&s;er Number than Five Hundred? If &s;o, then your Faith has no Virtue in it, is worthy of no Prai&s;e or Reward, and is no Effect of the Will. For what Choice of the Will is there in believing that Two and Three make Five? If this be true, then your Faith is perfect the very fir&s;t Moment, and can never grow, and you have no Need to pray, <HI>Lord increa&s;e our Faith, I believe, Lord help my Unbelief.</HI> I acknowledge Chri&s;t could make him&s;elf &s;o manife&s;t to every one, as that we &s;hould be no more able to doubt, or refu&s;e his Offer than to doubt of our own Exi&s;tence. But this would be incon&s;i&s;tent with a State of Probation, or living by Faith. This would not be Faith, but Sight, and peculiar to the Saints and Angels in Heaven. See a Specimen of the Arrogance and Pride that is cheri&s;hed by the&s;e Doctrines! With what Scorn do they look down upon us poor Wretches, who have nothing but <HI>common Grace!</HI> I confe&s;s if this be their &s;pecial Grace, I have it not; nor do I ever expect it in this State of Probation. Nor have I ever &s;een any Signs of it among them, notwith&s;tand|ing all their Boa&s;ting (like the Quakers of their Light within) on Purpo&s;e to inveigle weak People. I e&s;teem this nothing but playing the <HI>Mountebank</HI> with Religion. I have known &s;everal, who have boa&s;ted that they had this <HI>&s;pecial Grace;</HI> and were mounted aloft above Doubts or Fears, but I have found many of them with all their &s;pecial Grace, to be de&s;titute of common Hone&s;ty.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I think the Sum of what he has &s;aid is this, that GOD does not really will that all Sinners in general &s;hould be converted, his Oath means no more, than that when any Sinner is converted it is acceptable to GOD.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is indeed his Argument: But it is a very great Mi&s;take, to think that GOD always by his infinite Power does accompli&s;h every Thing that he would have his Creatures do. If this be true, then GOD is not willing that any Men &s;hould o|bey him, who do not actually obey him, then he is not willing that any &s;hould repent, who don't repent, he is not willing that one Soul &s;hould be good and obtain Salvation, who don't actually obtain it. And then what Sincerity is there in all GOD's earne&s;t and pa&s;&s;ion|ate Wi&s;hes? P&s;. lxxxi. 12. <HI>O that my People had hearken'd unto me!

Which yet he ne|ver did accompli&s;h by his infinite Power. If this Notion of Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI>'s be ju&s;t then, no wicked Man in the World does, or can do any Thing contrary to GOD's Will, for if it were contrary to his Will GOD would hinder him by his exceeding great Power.

When a Man has received five Talents, has he no Rea&s;on for Thankfulne&s;s; becau&s;e the Man who has received but one, may po&s;&s;ibly &s;o improve it, as to be accepted? And whereas there are many Man&s;ions in Heaven, is it no Cau&s;e of Thankfulne&s;s that you are put into a Capacity to arrive at the highe&s;t of them, unle&s;s you can be &s;ure that all others &s;hall be &s;hat out from the lowe&s;t?

<P>Here is another Mi&s;take; a &s;incere Repentance of all our Sins, a giving up our &s;elves to Chri&s;t with a full Re&s;olution to obey him till Death, is certainly the antecedent Condition of the Pardon of our Sins; and no Man's Sins are pardoned before he performs this good Work: And a per&s;evering in Well do|ing till Death, is the antecedent Condition of our full and final Ju&s;tification in the Day of Judgment; which is the only perfect Ju&s;tification before GOD.

<P>I am &s;ure the Scripture doth not reckon after this Manner, Ju&s;tification in this Life con&s;i&s;ts in the Pardon of our Sins, and the Approbation of GOD, neither of which are perfect here. Good and ju&s;tified Men do often offend GOD, and need a new Pardon, otherwi&s;e they need not repent, or pray for Pardon. Upon <HI>David</HI>'s Repentance of his Murder and Adultery, GOD pardoned his Sin &s;o far as to remit the heavier Part of the Pun|i&s;hment, <HI>viz.</HI> temporal and eternal Death; but yet he did not perfectly pardon him and exempt him from Puni&s;hment, for that Sin the Child mu&s;t die, and the Sword mu&s;t never depart from his Hou&s;e, and a Series of dreadful Puni&s;hments mu&s;t follow him to the Day of his Death. 2 Sam. xii. 14. <HI>The Lord hath put away thy Sin,</HI> here is his Pardon and Ju&s;tification, <HI>Howbeit the Child &s;hall &s;urely die</HI>&mdash;Indeed we &s;hall not be per|fectly ju&s;tified, until the general Judgment; when Soul and Body which have as a Puni&s;hment for Sin been &s;eparated, &s;hall be reunited, and the eternal Judge having compared our Lives with the Law of Faith and Covenant of Grace, &s;hall pronounce the final Sentence, <HI>Come ye ble&s;&s;ed.</HI></P>

<P>Here is a full Di&s;covery that his Hypothe&s;is and Notion of Ju&s;tification was entirely wrong.

Nothing that we do ju&s;ti|fies us in any Degree, or in any Re&s;pect; Whereby he has Point blank contradicted our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, who &s;ays Matth. xii. 37. <HI>By the Words &s;halt thou be ju&s;tified,</HI> and the governing of our

No, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> we are not ju&s;tified by the&s;e Things neither in Part, nor in any Re&s;pect what&s;oever. When the Scripture &s;o expre&s;ly teaches that we are ju&s;tified by our Works, it becomes us mode&s;tly to enquire in what Re&s;pect, or in what Part this is: But in comes Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> like <HI>Alex|ander,</HI> he will not &s;pend Time to untie, but immediately cuts the <HI>Gordian</HI> Knot, and plumply denies there is any &s;uch Thing.

<P>To this I an&s;wer with Dr. <HI>Whitby,</HI> <Q>It is ob&s;ervable, that though this Argument be offered in Favour of the Decrees of ab&s;olute Election and Reprobation, yet doth it plainly over|throw them, or render them &s;uperfluous. For be it that the&s;e Decrees were made from Eternity; yet &s;eeing GOD's Fore|knowledge of the Events of all Men, was al&s;o from Eternity, mu&s;t he not know what would be the Condition of all Men when he made the&s;e Decrees? And what Need then could there be of a Decree for that Event which was infalli|ble, by Virtue of his Foreknowledge without that Decree? Either GOD fore&s;aw the&s;e Events, independently on, and in the &s;ame Moment that he made the&s;e Decrees; and then &s;eeing the Objects of both the&s;e Decrees are the &s;ame indi|vidual Per&s;ons, which he &s;aw then would certainly be faved,
<PB N="75" REF="006094_0072_10278504767C93F0">or peri&s;h independently upon them, what Need could there be of the&s;e Decrees to a&s;certain that Event, which his own Foreknowledge had render'd certain and infallible?</Q> So that Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> in granting an eternal divine Foreknowledge of all Events, has entirely given up the Notion of eternal ab&s;olute Decrees, or made them altogether needle&s;s and &s;uperfluous. &mdash; Or el&s;e if he pretends, that GOD only <Q>fore&s;aw the&s;e future Contingencies by Virtue of his Decrees, that they &s;hould come to pa&s;s;</Q> then mu&s;t he hold that GOD's Decrees are before his Foreknowledge, and the Rea&s;on of it: And if &s;o, then this Argument of his does not in the lea&s;t Degree le&s;&s;en the Horror of them: But leaves that Notion obnoxious to all tho&s;e dreadful Con&s;equences I mentioned and a Thou&s;and more. And this Sort of Foreknowledge <Q>mu&s;t be attended with a fatal Nece&s;&s;ity: Though in this Ca&s;e it is not GOD's Foreknow|ledge, but his Decrees, which creates that Nece&s;&s;ity; all Things upon this Suppo&s;ition being nece&s;&s;ary; that is, &s;uch as cannot otherwi&s;e be, not becau&s;e GOD foreknows them; but becau&s;e by his immutable Decrees he hath made them nece&s;&s;ary; <HI>i. e.</HI> he foreknows becau&s;e they are nece&s;&s;ary, but doth not make them nece&s;&s;ary by foreknowing them.</Q></P>
<P>GOD's Foreknowledge has no Influence at all upon my Be|haviour, it is no Cau&s;e at all of my Salvation or Damnation. <Q><HI>Foreknowledge is Knowledge, and Knowledge depends on the Ex|i&s;tence of Things known, and not they on it."</HI> Should GOD by immediate Revelation give me the Knowledge of the Event of any Man's State or Actions, would my Knowledge of them have any Influence upon his Actions? Surely none at all, and yet my Knowledge as far as it is thus communicated, would be as certain and intallible as is that of GOD's. To illu&s;trate this in &s;ome Mea&s;ure by the Compari&s;on of our own Knowledge, we know certainly that &s;ome Things are, and that &s;ome Things will be.</Q> I know my good Friend is dead, I know certainly there will be a Re&s;urrection, and <Q>when I know the&s;e Things are, or will be, they cannot but be, yet manife&s;t it is, that our Knowledge doth not at all affect the Things we thus know, or make them either more certain, or more future than they would be without it. Now Fore|knowledge in GOD is Knowledge; as therefore Knowledge has no Influence on Things that are, &s;o neither has Fore|knowledge on Things that &s;hall be. And con&s;equently the Foreknowledge of any Action that would be otherwi&s;e free,
<PB N="76" REF="006094_0073_1026E7BB50FE8A48">cannot alter or dimini&s;h that Freedom: Whereas GOD's Decree of Election [is his Will concerning the Event.] it is powerful and active, and comprehends the Preparation and Exhibition of &s;uch Means as &s;hall unfru&s;trably produce the End. And his Decree of Reprobation (is his Will and Plea&s;ure) it is active, as far as Action is required, to render a Man deficient, and therefore &s;inful of Nece&s;&s;ity, it being a Decree of withholding from the Objects of it, that Grace which can alone enable them to do what GOD commands, or to avoid what GOD forbids on the &s;evere&s;t Penalty. Now Sin having no efficient but only a deficient Cau&s;e, it con&s;i&s;ting only in not doing what is commanded, and not avoiding what is forbidden, that which renders it nece&s;&s;ary for me to be thus deficient mu&s;t lay me under a Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;inning. &mdash; GOD's Foreknowledge renders no Action nece&s;&s;ary, other|wi&s;e it would lay a Nece&s;&s;ity upon his own Actions, for he foreknew from all Eternity that he would create a World, that he would &s;end his Son, &amp;c. but this did not make it nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould create a World or &s;end his Son, why then &s;hould it be conceived that it lays a Nece&s;&s;ity upon human Actions, or impairs the Freedom of them? Now if Foreknowledge doth not impair the Freedom of our Actions any more than if GOD had no &s;uch Foreknowledge, and it be rea&s;onable to give Precepts, and render Exhortations and Motives to Men free to perform what is required, and what they are exhorted and thus moved to, it mu&s;t be rea&s;onable thus to deal with Men, notwith&s;tanding GOD's Foreknowledge of their Actions; but it is not &s;o with Re&s;pect to GOD's Decrees, his Decree of Election comprehending not only the End, but the Means to it, as to be wrought by his &s;pecial Grace and unfru&s;trable Operation, which I cannot re&s;i&s;t, if I cannot have the Will to re&s;i&s;t it; and that I cannot have, if this Operation determines my Will to Act in Com|pliance with it: And where the Sin con&s;i&s;ts in a Defect i. e. the not doing what is required, and the not avoiding what is forbidden, the Decree of with holding that Grace without which that Effect is nece&s;&s;ary, is a Decree that the Sin &s;hould be inevitable, and to the Objects of it nece&s;&s;ary. &mdash; Moreover GOD's Foreknowledge reaches all Things, not only tho&s;e which will be, but al&s;o tho&s;e which may be, he fore&s;ees not only what will be done, but al&s;o after what Manner it will be done, that free Actions will be done freely, and &s;o his Fore|knowledge
<PB N="77" REF="006094_0074_102785115AEAA7D0">mu&s;t rather e&s;tabli&s;h than take away our Freedom; for if God fore&s;ees that I might ab&s;tain from what he &s;ees I will not ab&s;tain, and that I might will and do, what I neither will nor do, as he mu&s;t if he &s;ees I act freely, then he &s;ees that I might not peri&s;h, when he &s;ees that I will peri&s;h, and he &s;ees that I might be willing and obedient, and &s;o be &s;aved, when he &s;ees that I will not be &s;aved. And then there mu&s;t be Place and equitable Grounds for all his Admonitions, Ex|hortations and Motives not to peri&s;h but to turn and live, becau&s;e they are only Exhortations. Commands and Motives to do, and to ab&s;tain from that which he &s;ees that I may freely do, or may ab&s;tain from, and therefore mu&s;t have Power &s;o to do.</Q> So that there is an infinite Difference between the Con&s;equences of GOD's Foreknowledge as held by us, and the Con&s;equences of the ab&s;olute Decrees as held by the Calvini&s;ts.</P>
<P>Now let me briefly take Notice of one or two Things in his concluding Addre&s;s. 1. He in&s;inuates, as though we kept Men off from an entire Reliance on Chri&s;t. This I e&s;teem very injurious, and &s;landerous. No, GOD forbid that I &s;hould do any Thing like this. I rely as entirely, as wholly, as ab|&s;olutely, and as unre&s;ervedly on my ble&s;&s;ed and only Redeemer Je&s;us Chri&s;t for Salvation, as any Calvini&s;t on Earth. Chri&s;t is all in all to my Soul, in him are all my Hopes for A&s;&s;i&s;tance both to begin, continue, and end my chri&s;tian Cour&s;e, to obtain a Pardon not only for the Myriads of Myriads of my Sins (which I committed while he gave me Grace to do better) but even for the Pardon of my be&s;t Duties, on Chri&s;t I depend for all I need in this Life, and all I hope for to Eternity. On him I depend not only as the Meriter but as the Be&s;tower of all. Only herein (perhaps) I differ from you, I think Chri&s;t will allow me no Intere&s;t in him, he will not own me as his Di&s;ciple, unle&s;s I depart from all Iniquity, and obey him. Here, here is all my Fear, and all my Concern.</P>

<P>This Gentleman has written four or five Books again&s;t me, in the &s;pace of a few Years, in each of which (I think) he has boa&s;ted of the great Piety of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is Party, and becau&s;e Com|pari&s;ons are odious, I have return'd little or no An&s;wer, &mdash; And now &s;hall &s;ay but a few Words to it. <Q>This Trick, &s;ays
<PB N="78" REF="006094_0075_10278512F7E595E8">Bi&s;hop <HI>Patrick</HI> of appropriating true Piety to your &s;elves, and de&s;pi&s;ing the Profe&s;&s;ors of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as de&s;titute of the Power of Religion; and mere Formali&s;ts, has always been the topping Argument of your Party &mdash; But are you the great Chamberlains of the Hou&s;e of GOD? Are all the Ve&s;&s;els of Honour in it committed to your Cu&s;tody? Are you Keepers of the Book of Life, wherein the Names of the Heirs of Grace are all regi&s;tered? Have you the Balance of the Sanctuary? Or is the Fan put into your Hands to &s;eparate the Chaff and Corn&punc; Speak no more &s;o pre&s;umptu|ou&s;ly; and let not &s;uch Arrogance come out of your Mouth, le&s;t it prove true upon you, which St. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> &s;aith to <HI>Per|menian</HI> &mdash; Becau&s;e you have l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t Patience, and make Ha&s;te before the Time to &s;eparate Chaff and Corn, accounting at your Plea&s;ure &s;ome Men abominable, and &s;ome approved; you have declared your &s;elves to be but Chaff, and mo&s;t light Chaff carried out of the Compa&s;s of Charity, by the Wind of your own Pride.</Q></P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing you <HI>were all holy, even every one of you,</HI> yet this is not the Effect of Calvini&s;tic Notions, but by Virtue of our Principles, which in &s;pight of all you can do, you can't help but believe, and our Doctrine is all you have to keep you back from Wickedne&s;s. And if any of you are wicked (as I hope not) yet this is not &s;o much the Fault of the Man as of his Principles, whereas if we are vicious (as is too true) it is the Man and not his Principles that is to be blamed. &mdash; Chri&s;tianity is the be&s;t, and the only true Religion in the World: and yet &s;ome Chri&s;tians are the very wor&s;t of Men. Will you then renounce Chri&s;tianity upon that Account. Never was true Chri&s;tianity &s;et in a better Light than at this Day in the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Never was any Scheme better calculated to make Men wi&s;e and good Chri&s;tians: and if we are vicious, we are of all Men on Earth the mo&s;t inexcu&s;able.</P>
<P>But with all I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that different Sects have different Notions about Piety, and wherein it con&s;i&s;ts. As you know the holy Phari&s;ees differ'd in their Sentiments about real Holine&s;s from our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, and accounted him a very loo&s;e Liver. And I think learn'd Men are agreed that the Phari&s;ees were ri|gid Prede&s;tinarians or Calvini&s;ts, as they are now called.</P>
<P>They repeatedly in&s;i&s;t upon it, that Piety prevails among any People in Proportion as the&s;e Tenets obtain: The Rever&s;e of which the World knows to be true. Look back upon the State
<PB N="79" REF="006094_0076_102785148959FB60">of our Nation ju&s;t One Hundred Years pa&s;t, in the Time of the grand Rebellion, never did the&s;e Principles prevail &s;o much before or &s;ince, and never was there &s;o much Wickedne&s;s in the Nation. It is amazing to ob&s;erve what horrid Crimes were perpetrated by tho&s;e Men, who pretended to your &s;pecial Grace and had their Mouths full of religious Cant. And what did the&s;e Principles end in but a mon&s;trous Variety of Here&s;ies, and even Athei&s;m it&s;elf?

<P>I hate this painting and di&s;gui&s;ing one's Sentiments in Religion. I'll receive nothing as an Article of divine Faith which I am a&s;ham'd to &s;hew naked to the World. Mr. <HI>Calvin</HI> (give him his Due) was a very great, and a very hone&s;t Man, he &s;poke his Opinion frankly, becau&s;e he believed it to be a divine Truth: But the&s;e Gentlemen turn into a thou&s;and different Shapes, &s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible to know one of them when you meet him, whether he be a Calvini&s;t or an Arminian: I have but one Mark or Criterion to know them by, and that is, they always &s;eem to bear a mortal Hatred again&s;t the U&s;e of Rea&s;on and Common Sen&s;e in Religion, and will certainly pick a Quar|rel with you if you talk intelligibly about Chri&s;tianity. Now as to your other Que&s;tion, I &s;eriou&s;ly declare, that I firm|ly believe that all tho&s;e horrible Things are in&s;epara|ble from Calvini&s;m. I hoped, but alas my Hopes were vain! that Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> would have at lea&s;t attempted to &s;hew me how I might have &s;eparated them from his Doctrines. And whereas you think you &s;ee clearly, that they have no Connexion with Calvini&s;m, I therefore be&s;eech you for my Soul's Sake, let me into this My&s;tery, and &s;hew me how I may &s;ee, as you do. You know it is a common Saying with your Mini&s;ters, that every Man is naturally a Hater of GOD, and if you don't know the Time when you hated GOD, wi&s;hed there were no GOD, and would gladly dethrone him, you are not converted. And truly their Doctrines of Prede&s;tination, original Sin, &s;pecial Redemp|tion, and denying a Sufficiency of Grace to all but the Elect (as I under&s;tand them) make &s;uch an injurious and frightful Re|pre&s;entation
<PB N="80" REF="006094_0077_102785160C311418">of GOD, that I cannot &s;ee how they can avoid hat|ing him, and wi&s;hing there were no &s;uch GOD; until they are &s;ure of their own Election. The Repre&s;entation which the Go&s;pel makes of GOD, is to beautiful and charming that it will captivate a rational Affection: and none but Devils and their Accomplices can hate the GOD of Chri&s;tians. The holy Scrip|ture repre&s;ents GOD as <HI>Live</HI> it &s;elf, the <HI>Lord, the Lord GOD merciful and gracious, long &s;uffering, abundant in Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e's and Truth, pard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ning Iniquity, Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and Sin.</HI> One who bears the Affection of a Father to all Mankind, and treats all as his Offspring, and his tender Mercies are over all his Works; he ca&s;ts off none of the human Race, but only for their incurable Wickedne&s;s: He prepared Heaven for Mankind, and Hell was originally de&s;igned only for the Devils: hence Chri&s;t, the Judge will &s;ay of Heaven, <HI>Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t the Kingdom prepared for you:</HI> But of Hell, <HI>Go ye Cur&s;ed into ever|la&s;ting Fire, Prepared for the Devil and his Angels:</HI> Not prepar|ed for Mankind, as Heaven was. He &s;ent not his Son to con|demn but to &s;ave the whole World, he is always ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t and holds out his helping Hand to every one; his Arms are open to receive and embrace every human Creature, and is al|ways more ready to give, than we are to a&s;k&mdash;And though &s;ome Countries and Ages have, and do enjoy fewer Talents than we, and they have been de&s;titute of a &s;tanding Revelation; yet will he make all fair Allowances for it, and require little where little is given, and no Man &s;hall ever be mi&s;erable through any Defect on GOD's Part, but only through his own wilful Negligence and Perver&s;ene&s;s. Thus the holy Bible repre&s;ents GOD. And who would not love and rejoice in &s;uch a GOD? Who would not wi&s;h that it might be true, that there is &s;uch a GOD, if there were any Doubt of it? But to draw the Picture of the ever ble&s;&s;ed GOD according to our Idea of the very wor&s;t of Beings; to repre&s;ent him as an Hater of the greater Part of Mankind, as one who hated his own Offspring before they were born, and re&s;olved to damn them to H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l Torments before they had done Good or Evil, or were capable of offending him, merely to &s;hew his Sovereignty, and that he can do what he plea&s;es with his own; as one who&s;e Ju&s;tice is &s;uch, that he &s;ets the Childrens Teeth on Edge, becau&s;e their Father had eaten &s;our Grapes Thou&s;ands of Years before they w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> born; and makes them a motly Mixture of <HI>Bea&s;t and Devil,</HI> as fa&s;t as he gives them Being, becau&s;e <HI>Adam</HI> &s;inned, which was not in their

And therefore would not that his Son &s;hould effectually redeem them, or his Spirit yield them &s;ufficient Grace, without which he knew, they could no more e&s;cape Hell than they could &s;hun Death. Now when we repre&s;ent GOD to our Minds &s;urrounded with this amazing Horror, how can we prevent our Hearts ri&s;ing again&s;t him, and wi&s;hing there was no &s;uch GOD. I profe&s;s for my Part, I had rather a Million Times, never to have had a Being, than to think thus of GOD.&mdash;And why this horrible Repre&s;entation of GOD &s;hould be called <HI>A Vindication of Sovereign free Grace,</HI> is pa&s;t my Comprehen&s;ion, unle&s;s it be ironically. That any Man &s;hould be found, that can think &s;o unworthily of GOD, and im|pute &s;uch cruel Things to the Father, of Mercies, is very &s;urpriz|ing! But what is &s;till more wonderful, is, that they &s;hould &s;o &s;trangely affront common Sen&s;e, and the Rea&s;on of all Man|kind, as to &s;tile the&s;e horrible Tenets, the <HI>Doctrines of Free Grace;</HI> As if the fewer GOD was willing to &s;ave, the freer and richer his Grace mu&s;t be.
