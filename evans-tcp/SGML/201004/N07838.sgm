<HEAD>THE PREFACE <HI>Of the AUTHOR.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEARLY BELOVED.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>FOra&s;much as your whole Devotion ought to be &s;piritual, &s;o mu&s;t likewi&s;e this &s;alutary Work of Catechizing; and becau&s;e this is done by many with &s;o little, yea, without any Spirituality, we de&s;ire to give you &s;ome brief Directions how you are to behave in a becoming Manner, as in the Sight of God, before, at, and after catechizing; praying that the Lord will ena|ble you to apprehend, de&s;ire, and practi&s;e the &s;ame.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, your Views ought to be pure; to learn to know, to obey and glorify God, to edify one another, and to further your own Salvation, (which we hope you may have good Grounds to expect) let the Frame of your Hearts be humble, and &s;eek to be con|vinced of your natural Ignorance, and Inability in Spi|ritual Things.</P>
<P>Let this fill you with an holy Shame, and excite in you a true De&s;ire to be delivered from the&s;e Things, and to be conformable to the Image of God in true Wi&s;dom, be ye therefore &s;ubject to this Way of In&s;truc|tion, and to the Di&s;cretion of your Mini&s;ter in Re&s;pect to his Orders and Directions, for tho&s;e who learn, ought by all Means to be obedient herein, according to Heb.
<PB N="iv" REF="010001_0004_0F7B7AAD672024D0">13.17. "Obey them that have the Rule over you, and &s;ubmit your&s;elves"; And that, our Lord would have done, in Re&s;pect even to the Phari&s;ees and Scribes, Matt. 23.3. "All therefore whatever they bid you, that ob|&s;erve and do."</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>Furthermore, you are &s;everal Ways to prepare your|&s;elves; above all Things draw nigh to God in Prayer, and therein let your De&s;ires be in the following Order: That be&s;ides the Things before-mentioned, the Lord may give you a clear Under&s;tanding to comprehend Matters; a &s;anctified Judgment to value them; a &s;trong Memory, to remember them; and an unwearied De&s;ire and Diligence, to improve therein; a &s;ettled Attention, to under&s;tand the Que&s;tions and An&s;wers; a ready Utter|ance, with other Qualifications, in order to expre&s;s Matters according to the Truth and Worth thereof; as likewi&s;e, the Guidance of the Holy Spirit, to appre|hend the Excellence and Glory of tho&s;e Things; and finally that the Lord may incline and move your Hearts, agreeable to the Subject treated on. Endeavour to learn &s;ome &s;hort and comprehen&s;ive Book of Inctruction by Heart, which may afterwards &s;erve as a Foundation for farther In&s;truction.</P>
<P>Learn al&s;o to get perfectly by Heart, the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture; in your Preparations, u&s;e your&s;elf to get a di&s;tinct Apprehen&s;ion in your Under&s;tanding and Memory, of the Things you are to an&s;wer; and to that End &s;tudy a little upon each Matter: Make it your Practice to meditate upon them, &s;o that when you come to catechize, you may know what you under&s;tand, and
<PB N="v" REF="010001_0005_0F7B7AAE23432538">what not, and to what you are more particularly to give Attention; hence it will appear, that you have not learn'd to repeat it without Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Let him that hath made &s;ome Progre&s;s, read another Book on the &s;ame Subject; but in reading other Books keep this Rule, that you read not many Books, but read one Book often; being thus prepared, go out with a de|pendent Heart, tru&s;ting in the Lord; and to this End, maintain continually on your Mind, a lively Sen&s;e of this, viz. That without the Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, you will not be fit for any Word or Duty; but that with his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, you &s;hall enjoy all tho&s;e required Qualifications, and their Effects.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<P>Expecting thus the Favour of the Lord, go to the Place of Catechizing, with a Mind ready and de&s;irous to make Profe&s;&s;ion; and give Account as in the Pre&s;ence of God, of the Knowledge the Lord hath given you; yea, with a De&s;ign by the&s;e Means, to advance in Know|ledge and Sanctification.</P>
<P>Being there, let Gravity be &s;o con&s;picuous in your whole Deportment, that others may ob&s;erve that the Pre&s;ence of God, and the Weight of his Divine Truths, impre&s;s your Soul.</P>
<P>And offer both Soul and Body to the Lord, &s;olemnly de&s;iring, that the Lord may &s;o di&s;po&s;e and govern thee, as may be mo&s;t to his Glory and thy Salvation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<P>Beware of interrupting, contradicting, or cro&s;s-que&s;|tioning thy Mini&s;ter; le&s;t thou &s;hould &s;eem to pretend
<PB N="vi" REF="010001_0006_0F7B7AAEDFC5A2F0">to be his Ma&s;ter, or through thy Self-Conceit, endea|vour to bring his Per&s;on and Service into Di&s;re&s;pect.</P>
<P>But endeavour carefully to attend to his Que&s;tions, to under&s;tand them, and when he hath propounded the Que&s;tion, then an&s;wer; but when the Mini&s;ter begins to &s;peak again, you mu&s;t be &s;ilent, and not continue &s;peaking with him.</P>
<P>In Regard to the Manner of thy Expre&s;&s;ion, take Heed of Affectation, of &s;peaking inarticulately or heed|le&s;sly; but on the contrary, take Care to &s;peak with a Voice &s;ufficiently loud and clear, &s;o that not only the Mini&s;ter and the Per&s;on &s;peaking, but all pre&s;ent, may under&s;tand; every one &s;peaking in his natural Tone of Voice, tho' with Reverence, &s;low, and grave, accord|ing to the Nature and Weight of the Matter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<P>This being &s;o in general, we are further to notice, how you are to behave in &s;everal Circum&s;tances; and fir&s;t, when you are que&s;tioned, and God enables you to an&s;wer; acknowledge that it is from him, and in Humility render him Thanks for the &s;ame; but if you have not an&s;wered well, be not di&s;couraged, and don't re&s;olve to cea&s;e catechizing; but remember, that you come to that Duty not as one who knoweth every Thing, but as a Learner, who de&s;ires to know the&s;e Things; be not altogether &s;ilent, that wa&s;tes Time, makes the Mini&s;ter concerned, and &s;eems to reflect upon the Importance of the Que&s;tion; but &s;ay, either that you know it not, or what you apprehend to be the meaning; and &s;hew your De&s;ire of receiving Informa|tion from the Mini&s;ter; in Re&s;pect to God, acknowledge your Ignorance, and your Obligation to know tho&s;e
<PB N="vii" REF="010001_0007_0F7B7AAFA6F3D8F8">Things; Pray for the Forgivene&s;s of the Sins of Igno|rance, and for Increa&s;e of true Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Endeavour to quicken your Heart in the U&s;e of Means for further In&s;truction, endeavour to under&s;tand what the Mini&s;ter &s;ays in explaining the Subject, thank God for his Goodne&s;s in &s;ending you &s;uch a Mini&s;ter or Mini&s;ters, by who&s;e Means the Lord is plea&s;ed to teach you that which you know not, and yet nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t know; and endeavour for the Future, better to prepare thy&s;elf.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<P>When others are que&s;tioned, think not then what you &s;hall be a&s;ked, but rather what would I have an&s;|wered thereon, and endeavour to under&s;tand what is &s;aid in Explication thereof; if others know that, do not envy them, but thank God for the Gifts and Wi&s;dom be&s;towed on them, and de&s;ire to be equal to them.</P>
<P>If they know it not, do not de&s;pi&s;e nor ridicule them; don't boa&s;t nor exalt thy&s;elf, lea&s;t the Lord al&s;o put thee to Silence or Confu&s;ion, when thou an&s;were&s;t; but pray for them, that God may grant them more Light, De&s;ire, Memory, Boldne&s;s, and Ability; and animate and encourage them hereto, as much as in you lies.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<P>Finally, Catechizing being fini&s;hed, here al&s;o the End mu&s;t crown the Work.</P>
<P>Let Pride and Vanity be far from thee, it is very unbecoming that young People &s;hould come from &s;uch Exerci&s;e as from a vain idle Place, entertaining them|&s;elves with laughing, and in this laughing and &s;porting, exalting them&s;elves and de&s;pi&s;ing others, repeating what
<PB N="viii" REF="010001_0008_0F7B7AB05E7D8EA8">they them&s;elves knew or did not know, &s;peaking there|of in a di&s;re&s;pectful Manner; &s;o that &s;uch People &s;hew their own Folly, and prevent the Freedom of others.</P>
<P>But on the Contrary, let Sobriety and Gravity be your Ornaments; go alone or with one another to your Hou&s;es, ponder on the Subject you have heard, &s;earch as in the Divine Pre&s;ence, how you have behaved at Catechizing. Be not content that your Ears only have heard, but endeavour after an hearty Experience of tho&s;e Things.</P>
<P>Thank God for what you have had an Opportunity of hearing, and &s;peaking; endeavour to pre&s;erve it in thy Heart and Memory, yea even on Paper, in Order to make U&s;e thereof occa&s;ionally; to that End, pray God for the Grace of his Holy Spirit, to pre&s;erve and bring tho&s;e Things to your Remembrance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<P>And above all, it is thy Duty to &s;hew, that tho&s;e Truths you have made Profe&s;&s;ion of, do not con&s;i&s;t in Words but in Power; and that, in an Holy Conver&s;ation, fora&s;much as it is a Doctrine leading to Godline&s;s.</P>
<P>Speak not of the&s;e Things only in the Catechize, but let Heart and Mouth be filled therewith, in Order al&s;o to &s;peak thereof at every Opportunity; &s;eek to be an Example to others in Doctrine, Rebuking, Direction, Comforting and Sanctification.</P>
<P>Thus beloved Learner, we have &s;et before you &s;ome of tho&s;e Matters, which you are to practi&s;e in regard to Catechi&s;ing; may God enable you to practi&s;e this Duty to his Glory, to the Ornament of his Church, Edification of others, and to thine own Salvation.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the Knowledge of GOD.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Que&s;t.</HI> WHENCE do we know that there is a God?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer</HI> From Nature and the Scriptures.</P>
<P N="2">2. Of how many Sorts is the Knowledge of God from Na|ture?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Of two Sorts; 1 An internal or innate, 2 An ex|ternal or acquired Knowledge.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Que&s;t.</HI> What is the internal or innate Knowledge?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That which is natural in the Hearts of all Men Rom. 1.19. <HI>Becau&s;e that which may be known of God is manife&s;t in them, for God hath &s;hewed it unto them.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Q.</HI> How can there be &s;uch an innate Knowledge, &s;ince there are Fools who &s;ay in their Hearts <HI>there is no God?</HI> P&s;. 14.1.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is wi&s;hing rather than believing that there is no God.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Q.</HI> What is the external or acquired Knowledge?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is that which we learn from the Creatures without us, P&s;. 19.1, 2. <HI>The Heavens declare the Glory of God, and the Firmament &s;heweth his Handy-Work. Day unto Day uttereth Speech, and Night unto Night &s;heweth Knowledge.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Q.</HI> How can we conclude from the Creatures, that there-mu&s;t be a God?</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="010001_0010_0F7B7AB2F2399310">
<HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e they cannot be, nor exi&s;t of them&s;elves, but mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be created, and continually upheld by God. Job 12.9. <HI>Who, knoweth not in all the&s;e, that the Hand of the Lord hath wrought this.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Q.</HI> Is this natural Knowledge &s;ufficient to Salvation?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Q.</HI> Why not.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e we thereby cannot know Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Q.</HI> Is the Knowledge of Chri&s;t &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, John 17.3. <HI>This is eternal Life that they might know thee the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. Q. Whence mu&s;t we attain this &s;aving Knowledge?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> From the Scriptures. 2 Pet. 1.19. <HI>We have al&s;o a more &s;ure Word of Prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take Heed, as unto a Light &s;hining in a dark Place, until the Day dawn, and the Day Star ari&s;e in your Hearts.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the SCRIPTURES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Que&s;t.</HI> WHAT do you under&s;tand by the Scriptures?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The written Word of God. John 5.39. <HI>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal Life, and they are they which te&s;tify of me.</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.15. <HI>And that from a Child thou ha&s;t known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wi&s;e to Salvation, thro' Faith, which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Q.</HI> Has there always been a written Word?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No: Before the Time of Mo&s;es the Word was not written.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Q.</HI> How did God then make known his Word?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By Speech and Revelation to the Fathers. Gen. 18.1. <HI>And the</HI> LORD <HI>appeared unto Abraham in the Plains of Mamre, and He &s;at in the Tent Door in the Heat of the Day.</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="010001_0011_0F7B7AB37B354D88">Chap. 28.12. <HI>And he dreamed and behold a Ladder &s;et upon the Earth and the Top of it reached unto Heaven: And behold the Angels of God a&s;cending and de&s;cending on it.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Q.</HI> How did they then pre&s;erve that among them&s;elves?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By Tradition of the Fathers to the Children. Gen. 18.19. <HI>For I know him, that he will command his Children and his Hou&s;hold after him, and they &s;hall keep the Way of the Lord to do Ju&s;tice and Judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath &s;poken of him.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Q.</HI> How could that be done then, better than now?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e then Men lived longer, were fewer in Number, God revealed him&s;elf more frequently, and the Wiles of Satan were fewer.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Q.</HI> Who hath cau&s;ed the Scriptures to be written?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> God. 2 Tim. 3.16. <HI>All Scripture is given by In&s;pira|tion of God, and is profitable for Reproof, for Correction, for In&s;truction in Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Q. By whom hath he cau&s;ed them to be written?</P>
<P>A. The Old Te&s;tament by the Prophets, and the New Te&s;|tament by the Evangeli&s;ts and Apo&s;tles. Exod. 17.14. <HI>And the Lord &s;aid unto Mo&s;es, write this for a Memorial in a Book, and rehear&s;e it in the Ears of Jo&s;hua,</HI> Rev. 1 19. <HI>Write the Things which thou ha&s;t &s;een, and the Things which are, and the Things which &s;hall be hereafter.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Q. By whom were they in&s;pired, in writing this?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By the Holy Gho&s;t: 2 Pet. 1.21. <HI>For the Prophecy came not in old Time by the Will of Man: But Holy Men of God &s;pake as they were moved by the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Q. Could they not err in writing the Scriptures?</P>
<P>A. No: The Holy Spirit hath led them in all Truth, John 16.13. <HI>Howbeit when he, the Spirit of Truth, is come, he will guide you into all Truth, for he &s;hall not &s;peak of him&s;elf, but what|&s;oever he &s;hall hear that &s;hall he &s;peak, and he will &s;hew you Things to come.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. Q. How many Te&s;taments are there in the Scriptures?</P>
<P>A. Two; the Old and New Te&s;tament. 2 Cor. 3.14. <HI>But their Minds were blinded; for until this Day remaineth the &s;ame Vail untaken away, in the reading of the Old Teflament;
<PB N="12" REF="010001_0012_0F7B7AB43B799218">which Vail is done away in Chri&s;t.</HI> Heb. 9.15. <HI>And for this Cau&s;e, he is the Mediator of the New Te&s;tament, that by Means of Death, for the Redemption of the Trangre&s;&s;ions that were under the fir&s;t Te&s;tament, they which are called might receive the Promi&s;e of eternal Inheritance.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. Q. In what Language is the Old Te&s;tament written?</P>
<P>A. In the Hebrew, and a &s;mall Part in the Chaldean Lan|guage.</P>
<P N="12">12. Q. In what Language is the New Te&s;tament written?</P>
<P>A. In the Greek.</P>
<P N="13">13. Q. Is the whole Scripture a divine Book?</P>
<P>A. Yes: Becau&s;e &s;uch Things are therein contained which can only be of God.</P>
<P N="14">14. Q. What Things are the&s;e?</P>
<P>A. My&s;teries, &s;uch as the Holy Trinity; the Creation of all Things out of nothing in &s;ix Days; that Je&s;us is God-Man, the Mediator, &amp;c and Prophecies of Things to come duly fulfilled, both as to Time and Place.</P>
<P N="15">15. Q. Are not the Apocryphal Books the Word of God?</P>
<P>A. No: Becau&s;e they contain Things which are fabulous, and repugnant to the Word of God: For which Rea&s;on they were never acknowledged as divine, by the Jewi&s;h Church unto whom <HI>the Oracles of God were committed,</HI> Rom. 3.2.</P>
<P N="16">16. Q. Are the Scriptures perfect or imperfect?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They are perfect, P&s;. 19.7. <HI>The</HI> LAW <HI>of the</HI> LORD <HI>is</HI> PERFECT converting the Soul, the TESTIMONY <HI>of the</HI> LORD <HI>is</HI> SURE <HI>making wi&s;e the &s;imple.</HI></P>
<P N="17">17. Q. Is no Part of the Scriptures lo&s;t or fal&s;ified?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No: They are as entire as ever they have been, Matt. 5.18. <HI>For verily I &s;ay unto you till Heaven and Earth pa&s;s, one Jot or one Tittle &s;hall in no wi&s;e pa&s;s from the Law, till all be fulfilled.</HI></P>
<P N="18">18. Q. Need we to have Traditions of Men, be&s;ides the Scriptures?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No: The Scriptures alone are &s;ufficient. Matt. 15.9. <HI>But in vain do they wor&s;hip me, teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men.</HI></P>
<P N="19"><PB N="13" REF="010001_0013_0F7B7AB4D8BBD150">
19. Q. Are the Scriptures clear or ob&s;cure?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They are clear in tho&s;e Things that are nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation. P&s;. 119.105. <HI>Thy Word is a Light for my Feet, and a Lamp for my Path.</HI></P>
<P N="20">20. Q. Why then doth the Apo&s;tle Peter &s;ay, that in the Epi&s;tles of Paul <HI>are &s;ome Things hard to be under&s;tood.</HI> 2 Pet. 3.16.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Truth of a Thing although in it&s;elf clearly revealed may be hard to be under&s;tood, thus it is with all My&s;teries, as the Holy Trinity, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="21">21. Q. May and mu&s;t we read the Scriptures?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Certainly yes. John 5.39. <HI>Search the Scriptures, for, in them ye think ye have eternal Life, and they are they which te&s;tify of me.</HI></P>
<P N="22">22. Q. How mu&s;t we read and &s;earch the Scriptures?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Fir&s;t in the Fear of God, P&s;. 111.10. <HI>The Fear of the</HI> LORD <HI>is the beginning of Wi&s;dom: A good Under&s;tanding have all they that do his Commandments; his Prai&s;e endureth for ever.</HI> 2dly. With a praying Heart, P&s;. 119.18. <HI>Open thou mine Eyes that I may behold wondrous Things out of thy Law.</HI> 3dly. With Reverence, I&s;aiah 66.2 <HI>and</HI> 5, <HI>But to this Man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a con|trite Spirit, and trembleth at my Word. Hear ye the Word of the Lord ye that tremble at his Word, your Brethren that hated you, that ca&s;t you out for my Name's Sake, &s;aid let the Lord be glorified: But he &s;hall appear to your Joy, and they &s;hall be a&s;hamed.</HI> 4thly. With Attention and Spiritual Judgment, 1 Cor. 2.13. <HI>Which Things al&s;o we &s;peak, not in the Words which Man's Wi&s;dom teacheth, but which the Holy Gho&s;t teacheth, comparing &s;piritual Things with Spiritual.</HI></P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> A perfect, and an infinite Spirit. John 4.24. <HI>God is a Spirit, and they that wor&s;hip him, mu&s;t wor&s;hip him in Spirit and in truth.</HI> Matt. 5.48. <HI>Be ye therefore per|fect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Q. How can that be, as the Scriptures a&s;cribe to him Eyes, Ears, Hands, and other bodily Members?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> All this mu&s;t be under&s;tood improperly, as meaning &s;uch Perfections in God as have &s;ome Analogy with the U&s;e of tho&s;e human Members.</P>
<P N="3">3. Q Wherein mu&s;t God be known?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. In his Being. 2. In his Names. 3. In his Attributes. 4. In his Per&s;on.</P>
<P N="4">4. Q. May we a&s;cribe Being or E&s;&s;ence to God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes: Though not in a corporal Sen&s;e. Prov. 8.14. <HI>Council is mine and &s;ound Wi&s;dom</HI> (or as it may be rendered, <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI>) <HI>I am Under&s;tanding, I have Strength.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Q. How many Gods are there?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> But one God. 1 Tim. 2.5. <HI>For there is one God and one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Q. Neverthele&s;s God &s;peaks, in the fir&s;t Command, of other Gods; Exod. 20.3.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Not that there are other Gods in reality; but &s;uch as are made and held for &s;uch by Men, 1 Cor. 8.5, 6. <HI>For though there be that are Gods, whether in Heaven or in Earth (as there be Gods many and Lords many) But to us there is but</HI> ONE GOD, <HI>the Father, of whom are all Things, and we in him; and one Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by whom are all Things, and we by him.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ii. Of GOD's Names.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Que&s;t. Hath God Need of Names, in the Manner Men have?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; For there is none like unto him. Gen. 32.29. <HI>And Jacob a&s;ked him, and &s;aid, tell me I pray thee thy Name: And he &s;aid wherefore is it that thou do&s;t a&s;k after my Name? and he ble&s;&s;ed him there.</HI> Judges 13.18. <HI>And the Angel of the Lord &s;aid unto him, why a&s;ke&s;t thou thus after my Name, &s;eeing it is &s;ecret?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Q. To what End have Men Names?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To di&s;tingui&s;h them from other Men, who are their Equals.</P>
<P N="3">3. Q Why then are Names a&s;cribed to God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Fir&s;t; To di&s;tingui&s;h him from Idols; 2dly. Al&s;o there|by to make known &s;omething of him&s;elf to us.</P>
<P N="4">4. Q. Are then all the Names a&s;cribed to God &s;ignificant?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P N="5">5. Q. Which are the two Names mo&s;t commonly given him?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Name of <HI>God,</HI> and the Name of <HI>Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Q. Is not the Name <HI>God,</HI> only the Name of a certain Office?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; But the Name of the Divine E&s;&s;ence it&s;elf; He is by Nature God, in Oppo&s;ition to the Idols. Gal. 4.8. When ye knew not God, ye did Service unto them which by Nature are no Gods.</P>
<P N="7">7. Q. Is not the Name of God given to Angels and Magi&s;|trates? P&s;. 82.6 <HI>I have &s;aid ye are Gods, and ye are all Chil|dren of the Mo&s;t High.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> When the&s;e Names are thus u&s;ed, they mu&s;t be under|&s;tood in an improper Sen&s;e.</P>
<P N="8">8. Q. Which is God's chiefe&s;t or greate&s;t Name?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Name of <HI>Jehovah</HI> or <HI>Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Q. Can this Name be given to a Creature?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; I&s;aiah 42.8. <HI>I am the Lord, that is my Name, and
<PB N="16" REF="010001_0016_0F7B7AB8B9F47CA0">my Glory will I not give to another, neither my Prai&s;e to graven Images.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. Q. Doth this Name imply &s;omething &s;o great, that it cannot be given to a Creature?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; It &s;ignifies the Being or Exi&s;tence, the Unchange|ablene&s;s and Faithfulne&s;s of God. Exod. 3.14. <HI>And God &s;aid unto Mo&s;es,</HI> I AM THAT I AM; <HI>and he &s;aid, thus &s;halt thou &s;ay unto the Children of I&s;rael,</HI> I AM <HI>hath &s;ent me unto you.</HI> Chap. 6.3. <HI>And I appeared unto Abraham, unto I&s;aac, and unto Jacob, by the Name of God Almighty, but by my Name</HI> JEHOVAH <HI>was I not known unto them.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. Q. May Chri&s;t be called Jehovah?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; Becau&s;e he al&s;o is true God. Jer. 23.6. <HI>In his Days Judah &s;hall be &s;aved, and I&s;rael &s;hall dwell &s;afely; and this is his Name whereby he &s;hall be called,</HI> THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.</P>

<HEAD>iii. Of GOD's Attributes.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Que&s;t. Are God's Attributes di&s;tinct from him&s;elf?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No: They are God him&s;elf; therefore he is called the Light, 1 John 1.5. <HI>This then is the Me&s;&s;age which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is Light, and in him is no Darkne&s;s at all,</HI> Life, Truth, and Love, 1 John 4.8. <HI>He that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is Love,</HI> Even Holine&s;s it&s;elf; to &s;wear by his Holine&s;s, and &s;wearing by him|&s;elf is one and the &s;ame. Amos 4.2. <HI>The Lord God hath &s;worn by his Holine&s;s, that lo the Day &s;hall come upon you, that he will take you away with Hooks, and your Po&s;terity with Fi&s;hbooks.</HI> Compared with Heb. 6.13. <HI>For when God made Promi&s;e to Abraham, becau&s;e he could &s;wear by no greater he &s;ware by</HI> HIM|SELF.</P>
<P N="2">2. Q. Are God's Attributes different and di&s;tinct from each other?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Not in God; For in him all is infinite Perfection; But they are di&s;tingui&s;hed only according to our Manner of Comprehen|&s;ion, and according to the &s;everal Exerci&s;es of God's Perfections concerning the Creatures.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="17" REF="010001_0017_0F7B7AB963F4A6A0">
3. Q. How are God's Attributes, or Properties thus gene|rally di&s;tingui&s;hed?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Into incommunicable and communicable Properties, Gen. 1.26. <HI>And God &s;aid, let us make Man in our Image. after our Likene&s;s:</HI> 2 Pet. 1.4. <HI>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious Promi&s;es: That by the&s;e you might be made Partakers of the divine Nature.</HI> 1 John 3.2. <HI>Beloved now are we the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we &s;hall be: But we know that when we &s;hall appear, we &s;hall be like him; for we &s;hall &s;ee him as he is.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Q. Which are the incommunicable?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Independency, Simplicity, Eternity, Omnipre&s;ence, Unchangeablene&s;s of God.</P>
<P N="5">5. Q. Why do you call them incommunicable?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e there is not the lea&s;t Re&s;emblance of them in any Creature.</P>
<P N="6">6. Q. What is God's Independency?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That he is Self exi&s;tent. Gen. 17.1. <HI>I am the Almighty God, walk before me, and be thou perfect.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Q.</HI> What is God's Simplicity?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That all in God is one without Compo&s;ition of different Sorts. Deut. 6.4. <HI>Hear, O! I&s;rael, the Lord our God is one Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Q. What is God's Eternity?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That he is, 1. Without Beginning. 2. Without Suc|ce&s;&s;ion or Difference of Time. 3. Without End. P&s;. 90.2. <HI>Before the Mountains were brought forth, or ever thou had&s;t formed the Earth and the World, from Everla&s;ting to Everla&s;ting thou art God.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Q. Doth it belong to God's Eternity, that there is no Succe&s;&s;ion of Time with him?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes: <HI>For one Day is with the Lord as a thou&s;and Years, and a thou&s;and Years as one Day.</HI> 2 Pet. 3.8.</P>
<P N="10">10. Q. Where is God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Every where pre&s;ent. Jer. 23.23, 24. <HI>Am I a God at Hand, &s;aith the Lord, and not a God after off? Can any hide
<PB N="18" REF="010001_0018_0F7B7ABA1E868788">him&s;elf in &s;ecret Places, that I &s;hall not &s;ee him, &s;aith the Lord: Do I not fill Heaven and Earth? &s;aith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. Q. Mu&s;t this be under&s;tood only of his Operations, or of his E&s;&s;ence.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It mu&s;t be under&s;tood both as to his E&s;&s;ence and Oppe|rations, which cannot be &s;eparated, becau&s;e he worketh by Virtue of his E&s;&s;ence or Being. Acts 17.27. <HI>That they &s;hould &s;eek the Lord, if happily they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. Q. Why is God &s;aid to be particularly in Heaven?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e he there &s;heweth forth his Glory more than any where el&s;e. I&s;aiah 66.1. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord, the Heaven is my Throne, and the Earth is my Foot&s;tool; where is the Hou&s;e that ye build me, and where is the Place of my re&s;t?</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. Q Is God changeable or unchargeable?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Unchangeable, Malachi 3.6. <HI>For I am the Lord, I change not: Therefore ye Sons of Jacob are not con&s;umed.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. Q. Neverthele&s;s, Repentance is a&s;cribed unto God; Gen. 6.6. <HI>It repented the Lord that he had made Man on the Earth, and it grieved him at his Heart.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This Repentance in God is only a Change in his Work: Not in his Will and Being, Numb. 23.19. <HI>God is not a Man that he &s;hould lie, neither the Son of Man that he &s;hould repent: Hath he &s;aid and &s;hall he not do it? or hath he &s;poken and &s;hall he not make it good?</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. Q. Change of Place is al&s;o a&s;cribed unto him, as that he de&s;cended, came to, and went from certain Places? Gen. 11.5. <HI>The Lord came down to &s;ee the City and the Tower which the Children of Men builded?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This is only a Change in a more or le&s;s Manife&s;tation of his divine Pre&s;ence, tho' not in his e&s;&s;ential Pre&s;ence it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="16">16. Q. Which are the communicable Attributes of God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The following are generally accounted &s;uch, to wit, God's Knowledge, Will and Power, his Goodne&s;s, Grace, Mercy and Patience.</P>
<P N="17">17. Q. Why are the&s;e called communicable?</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="010001_0019_0F7B7ABB582555E0">
<HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e there is &s;ome faint Re&s;emblance of them in the Creatures; although as they are in God they are infinite, and &s;o incommunicable.</P>
<P N="18">18. Q. What is God's Knowledge?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is that divine Perfection, whereby he knoweth all Things in him&s;elf from Eternity, in the mo&s;t perfect Manner. Acts 15.18. Known unto God are all his Works from the Beginning of the World.</P>
<P N="19">19. Q. What is the Object of God's Knowledge?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> All Things: He is therefore Omni&s;cient, 1 John 3.20. <HI>For if our Hearts condemn us, God is more than our Hearts, and knoweth all Things.</HI> P&s;. 147.4. <HI>He telleth the Number of the Stars: He calleth them all by their Names.</HI></P>
<P N="20">20. Q. Doth God know all future and po&s;&s;ible Things?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes: P&s;. 139.2. <HI>Thou knowe&s;t my down-&s;itting, and mine up-ri&s;ing, thou under&s;tande&s;t my Thoughts after off.</HI></P>
<P N="21">21. Q. Doth he know them by Virtue of a preceding De|cree, or by Way of a mediate Knowledge, as it is called?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He knoweth them by Virtue of his Decrees; and with an ab&s;olute Certainty that they &s;hall take Place.</P>
<P N="22">22. Q. How is the Will of God di&s;tingui&s;hed?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Into his Will in his Decree, and his Will in his Precept; or in other Words; into his &s;ecret, and revealed Will.</P>
<P N="23">23. Q. What do you mean by God's Will in his Decree?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> God's eternal Purpo&s;e, according to which he doth all Things in Time. Eph. 1.11. <HI>In whom al&s;o we have obtained an Inheritance, being prede&s;tinated according to the Purpo&s;e of him who worketh all Things after the Council of his own Will.</HI></P>
<P N="24">24. Q. What is God's preceptive or revealed Will?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is that which he hath pre&s;cribed in his Word as a Rule for us, and which it is his Will we &s;hould obey, Rom. 12.2. <HI>Be not conformed to this World, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your Mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect Will of God.</HI></P>
<P N="25">25. Q. By which of the&s;e two mu&s;t we be regulated?</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="010001_0020_0F7B7ABB9B86D830">
<HI>A.</HI> According to his preceptive Will: for the Will of God in his Decree is unknown to us. Deut. 29.29. <HI>The &s;ecret Things belong unto the Lord our God: But tho&s;e Things which are revealed belong unto us and to our Children for ever, that we may do all the Words of this Law.</HI></P>
<P N="26">26. Q. What is the Ju&s;tice of God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is that divine Perfection by which he doth hate and puni&s;h all Sin. P&s;. 5.4.5, 6. <HI>For thou art not a God that hath Plea&s;ure in Wickedne&s;s: Neither &s;hall Evil dwell with thee. The fooli&s;h &s;hall not &s;tand in thy Sight, thou hate&s;t all Workers of Iniquity. Thou &s;halt de&s;troy them that &s;peak lea&s;ing: The Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful Man.</HI></P>
<P N="27">27. Q. Mu&s;t God of Nece&s;&s;ity puni&s;h all Sin?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, Rom. 1.32. <HI>Who knowing the Judgment of God that they which commit &s;uch Things are worthy of Death, not only do the &s;ame, but have Plea&s;ure in them that do them.</HI></P>
<P N="28">28. Q. Is God under any Con&s;traint?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, but when we &s;ay God mu&s;t, we mean he wills with the mo&s;t perfect Freedom. Heb. 1.13. <HI>Thou art of purer Eyes than to behold Evil, and can&s;t not look on Iniquity: Where|fore looke&s;t thou upon them that deal treacherou&s;ly, and holde&s;t thy Tongue when the Wicked devoureth the Man that is more righ|teous than he.</HI></P>
<P N="29">29. But cannot God di&s;pen&s;e with his Ju&s;tice, at lea&s;t in &s;ome Mea&s;ure?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, for then he would deny him&s;elf; for his Ju&s;tice is God him&s;elf. Exod 34.6, 7. <HI>And the Lord pa&s;&s;ed by before him, and proclaimed, the Lord, the Lord God merciful and gracious, long-&s;uffering and abundant in Goodne&s;s and Truth-Keeping Mercy for Thou&s;ands, forgiving Iniquity and Tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion and Sin, and that will</HI> BY NO MEANS CLEAR THE GUILTY; <HI>vi&s;iting the Iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children, and upon the Children's Children unto the third and fourth Generation.</HI></P>
<P N="30">30. Q. But God however forgiveth Believers the Guilt and Puni&s;hment of Sins?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Then God's Ju&s;tice is already &s;atisfied in Chri&s;t, who hath borne the Puni&s;hment of Sins for them. Eph. 1.7. <HI>In
<PB N="21" REF="010001_0021_0F7B7ABD809CEBE0">whom we have Redemption through his Blood, the Forgivene&s;s of ins, according to the Riches of his Grace.</HI></P>
<P N="31">31. Q. Of what Kind is God's Power.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is an Almighty Power, Matt. 19.26. <HI>But Je&s;us be|held them, and &s;aid unto them, with Men this is impo&s;&s;ible, but with God all Things are po&s;&s;ible;</HI></P>
<P N="32">32. Q. Can God die, &s;in, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No: For that would be no Power, but an Inability.</P>
<P N="33">33. Q. What is God's Goodne&s;s?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In general his Benevolence towards his Creatures. P&s;. 4.6 7. <HI>There be many that &s;ay, who will &s;hew us any Good: Lord li&s;t thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon us. Thou ha&s;t put Gladne&s;s in my Heart, more than in the Time that their Corn and their Wine increa&s;ed&punc;</HI> More particularly the Exerci|&s;es of his Beneficence and Love towards his Creatures, towards Man, and more e&s;pecially towards his Saints, P&s;. 36.6. <HI>O Lord, thou pre&s;erve&s;t Man and Bea&s;t.</HI> John 3.16. <HI>For God &s;o loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;o|ever believeth in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting Life.</HI></P>
<P N="34">34. Q. What is God's Grace?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is that divine Goodne&s;s whereby he doeth Good to his Creatures, without any Regard to their Merits.</P>
<P N="35">35. Q. How many Kinds of Grace are there?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> There are two Sorts, general towards all, Matt. 5.45. <HI>For he maketh his Sun to ri&s;e on the Evil and on the Good, and &s;endeth Rain on the Ju&s;t and Unju&s;t.</HI> or &s;pecial and &s;aving, to|wards the Elect only. Rom. 3.24 <HI>Being ju&s;tified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> Matt. 11.25. <HI>At that Time Je&s;us an&s;wered and &s;aid, I thank thee O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth: becau&s;e thou ha&s;t hid the&s;e Things from the Wi&s;e and Prudent, and ba&s;t revealed them unto Babes,</HI> Gen. 6.8. <HI>But Noah found Grace in the Eyes of the Lord;</HI> and Luke 1.30. <HI>And the Angel &s;aid unto her, fear not Mary, for thou ha&s;t found Favour with God.</HI> And this Grace is preventing, opperating, and following.</P>
<P N="36">36. Q. What is God's Mercy?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is that divine Goodne&s;s toward the mi&s;erable elect
<PB N="22" REF="010001_0022_0F7B7ABE0EF23BA0">Sinner, by which he actually re&s;tores him to a State of Grace, through the Mediator Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<P N="37">37. Q. What is God's Patience, or Long &s;uffering?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is that divine Goodne&s;s, whereby he defers the ju&s;t Puni&s;hment of Sin, in order to the Conver&s;ion of the Elect, and the Conviction of the Reprobate. Rom. 2.4. Or de&s;pi&s;e&s;t thou the Riches of his Goodne&s;s, and Forbearance and Long-Suffering; not knowing that the Goodne&s;s of God leadeth thee to Repentance.</P>
<P N="38">38. Q What is God's Sovereignty?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is God's &s;upreme Authority above all Creatures. Jer. 10 6, 7. <HI>Fora&s;much as there is none like unto thee,</HI> O LORD, <HI>thou art great, and thy Name is great in Might. Who would not fear thee, O King of Nations? for to thee doth it appertain: Fora&s;much as among all the Wi&s;e-Men of the Nations,</HI> And in all their Kingdoms there is none like unto thee. Chap. 18.6. <HI>O Hou&s;e of I&s;rael, cannot I do with you as this Potter? &s;aith the Lord. Behold as the Clay is in the Potter's Hand, &s;o are ye in mine Hand, O Hou&s;e of I&s;rael.</HI> Rom. 9.18 and 20. <HI>There|fore hath he Mercy on whom he will have Mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth. Nay but O Man, who art thou that repli|e&s;t again&s;t God? &s;hall the Thing formed &s;ay unto him that form|ed it,</HI> Why ha&s;t thou made me thus?</P>

From &s;uch Scriptures where Di&s;tinction is made be|tween God and God, Lord and Lord, P&s;. 45.7. <HI>Thou love&s;t Righteou&s;ne&s;s and hate&s;t Wickedne&s;s, therefore God thy God hath anointed thee with the Oyl of Gladne&s;s above thy Fellows.</HI> P&s;. 110.1. <HI>The Lord hath &s;aid unto my Lord, &s;it thou at my Right Hand, until I make thine Enemies thy Foot&s;tool.</HI></P>

<P N="7">7. Q. How do you prove the Holy Trinity from the New Te&s;tament?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> From 1 John 5.7. <HI>For There are three that bear Re|cord in Heaven, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t, and the&s;e Three are One.</HI> Al&s;o from the In&s;titution of Bapti&s;m, Matt. 28.19, <HI>Go ye therefore and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t: teaching them to ob&s;erve all Things, what&s;oever I have commanded you.</HI></P>
<P>Al&s;o from the Bapti&s;m of our Lord, Matt. 3, the Son was bapti&s;ed, the Father &s;pake from Heaven, and the Spirit of God de&s;cended like a Dove.</P>

<P N="20">20. Q. Doth the Holy Gho&s;t proceed only from the Father?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No: But al&s;o from the Son, he is therefore called <HI>the Spirit of Chri&s;t.</HI> Rom. 8.9. <HI>But ye are not in the Fle&s;h, but in the Spirit, if &s;o be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.

<P N="21">21. Q. Is not the Holy Gho&s;t, only a Power, or Attribute of God?</P>

<P N="24">24. Prove that divine Names are given to the Son?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Fir&s;t; The Name of Lord or Jehovah, Jer. 23.6. <HI>In his Days Judah &s;hall he &s;aved, and I&s;rael &s;hall dwell &s;afely, and this is his Name whereby he &s;hall be called,</HI> THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.</P>
<P>2dly. The Name of God, 1 John 5.20. <HI>And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an Under&s;tanding, that we may know him that is true: And we are in him that is true, even in his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t. This is the</HI> TRUE GOD, AND ETERNAL LIFE.</P>
<P N="25">25. Q Prove that the Name of God is given to the Holy Gho&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Acts 5.3, 4. <HI>But Peter &s;aid, Ananias, Why hath Sa|tan filled thine Heart to lie to the Holy Gho&s;t, and to keep back Part of the Price of the Land? While it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was &s;old, was it not in thine own Power? Why ha&s;t thou conceived this Thing in thy Heart?</HI> THOU HAST NOT LIED UNTO MEN, BUT UNTO GOD.</P>
<P N="26">26. Q. Prove that a divine Attribute is a&s;cribed to the Son?</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes: Becau&s;e we thereby learn to know God rightly, and &s;eek Reconciliation with the Father as Judge, in the Satis|faction of the Son, through the Operation of the Holy Spirit.

<P N="1">1. Que&s;t. ARE God's Decrees any Thing di&s;tinct from God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No: They are the decreeing God him&s;elf, &s;o that his Under&s;tanding and Will are exerci&s;ed in determining Things without him.</P>
<P N="2">2. Q When hath God formed his Decrees?</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="010001_0028_0F7B7AC5695D8210">
<HI>A.</HI> From Eternity. Acts 15.18. <HI>Known unto God are all his Works from the Beginning of the World</HI> (or from Eternity).</P>
<P N="3">3. Q Are the Decrees of God free?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, Matt. 11.26. <HI>Even &s;o Father, for &s;o it &s;eemed good in thy Sight.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Q. Are they wi&s;e Decrees?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes: Rom. 11.33. <HI>O the Depth of the Riches, both of the Wi&s;dom and Knowledge of God! How un&s;earchable are his Judgments, and his Ways pa&s;t finding out!</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Q. Are they changeable?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No they are unchangeable. I&s;aiah 46.10. <HI>Declaring the End from the Beginning, and from antient Times the Things that are not yet done, &s;aying</HI> MY COUNSEL SHALL STAND, AND I WILL DO ALL MY PLEASURE.</P>
<P N="6">6. Q. To what do the Decrees of God extend?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They extend to all Things. Eph. 1.11. <HI>In whom al&s;o we have obtained an Inheritance, being prede&s;tinated according to the Purpo&s;e of him who worketh</HI> ALL THINGS, AFTER THE COUNSEL OF HIS OWN WILL.</P>
<P N="7">7. Q. Are there conditional Degrees, which depend on the free Will of Man?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; But there are &s;uch as depend on a Condition, wherein God hath al&s;o decreed, and which he him&s;elf infalli|bly brings about; Thus (for In&s;tance) God had decreed to &s;ave Peter on Condition of Faith and Repentance, but at the &s;ame Time God had decreed in due Time to work; and ac|tually wrought Faith and Repentance in him.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Prede&s;tination.</HEAD>

<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes</P>
<P N="2">2. Q. How is that Decree called?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Prede&s;tination or Fore-ordaining. Rom. 8.30. <HI>More|over whom he did prede&s;tinate, them he al&s;o called; and whom
<PB N="29" REF="010001_0029_0F7B7AC61C1E6CE0">he called he al&s;o ju&s;tified; and whom he ju&s;tified, them he al&s;o glorified.</HI></P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> Two, Election and Reprobation. 1 The&s;. 5.9. <HI>God hath not appointed us to Wrath, but to obtain Salvation through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Q. When did God make this Election?</P>

<P N="5">5. Q. Is this general, are all Men elected?</P>

<P N="6">6. Q. Is this Election concerning certain Individual Per&s;ons, known to God by Name?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; Rom. 9.13. <HI>Jacob have I loved, and E&s;au have I hated.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Q. What is the Rea&s;on of God's choo&s;ing the one and not the other.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Only Gods free and &s;overeign Plea&s;ure. Rom. 9.13. <HI>Therefore he hath Mercy on whom he will have Mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Q. Is it not then on Account of fore&s;een Faith or good Works?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. <HI>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that run|neth, but of God that &s;heweth Mercy.</HI> Rom. 9.16.</P>
<P N="9">9. Q. Is there no Severity or Inju&s;tice in this?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; For God could very ju&s;tly have let all Mankind peri&s;h.</P>
<P N="10">10. Q. Is this Election changeable?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; It is unchangeable. Rom. 9.11. <HI>For the Children being not yet born, neither having done any Good or Evil, that the Purpo&s;e of God according to Election might &s;tand, not of Works but of him that calleth.</HI></P>

11. Q. Doth it not follow from hence that it is all one how we live?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; For God hath decreed the Means, as well as the End. Rom. 8.29, 30. <HI>For whom he did foreknow he al&s;o did prede&s;tinate to be conformed to the Image of his Son, that he might be the fir&s;t born among many Brethren. Moreover whom he did prede&s;tinate, them he al&s;o called, and whom he called, them he al&s;o ju&s;tified: And whom he ju&s;tified, them he al&s;o glorified.</HI></P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> God gives them an hearty De&s;ire to will the U&s;e of Means, Phil. 2.13. <HI>For it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good Plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. Q. What are the Signs of Election?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Faith, Hope, and Love. 1 The&s;. 1.3.4. <HI>Remem|bring without cea&s;ing, your Work of Faith and Labour of Love, and Patience of Hope in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in the Sight of God, and our Father: Knowing Brethren, Beloved, your Election of God.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. Q. To what End doth this Doctrine of Prede&s;tination &s;erve?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It &s;erves to the Glory of God, in his &s;upreme Sovereign|ty, Independency, Wi&s;dom, Grace, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Truth. Rom. 11.33. <HI>O the Depth of the Riches, both of the Wi&s;dom and Knowledge of God! How un&s;earchable are his Judgments, and his Ways pa&s;t finding out. And for humbling of Man,</HI> Rom. 9.20, 21. <HI>Nay but, O Man who art thou that replie&s;t again&s;t God? &s;hall the Thing formed &s;ay to him that formed it, why ha&s;t thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter Power over the Clay of the &s;ame Lump to make one Ve&s;&s;el unto Honour and another unto Di&s;honour?</HI> 1 Cor. 4.7. <HI>For who maketh thee to differ from another?

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of Providence.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Que&s;t. DOTH God cea&s;e from all Work concerning the Creation?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No: There is &s;till a continual Operation of Divine Pro|vidence. John 5.17. <HI>My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Q. In how many Acts doth Gods Providence con&s;i&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In three: In Upholding, Co-operating, and Govern|ing.</P>
<P N="3">3. Q. What is Upholding?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is the Almighty Power of God, whereby he cau&s;eth all Things to continue in Exi&s;tence. Heb. 1.3. <HI>Who uphold|eth all Things by the Word of his Power.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Q. What is divine Co-operation?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Almighty Power of God, whereby he influences all the Motions and Opperations of his Creatures. 1 Cor. 12.6. <HI>And there are Diver&s;ities of Operations, but it is the &s;ame God that worketh all in all.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Q. What is the divine Government?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is the Almighty Power of God, whereby he doth direct every Thing to a certain determined End. P&s;. 93.1. <HI>The Lord reigneth, he is clothed with Maje&s;ty, the Lord is clothed with Strength, wherewith he hath girded him&s;elf: The World al&s;o is e&s;tabli&s;hed that it cannot be moved.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Q. Doth the Providence of God extend over all Things?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes: Eph. 1.11. <HI>Being prede&s;tinated according to the Purpo&s;e of him who worketh all Things after the Coun&s;el of his own Will.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Q. Doth it extend even to &s;mall Things?</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="010001_0036_0F7B7ACF6131D168">
<HI>A.</HI> Yes: <HI>The Hairs of your Head are all numbered.</HI> Matt. 10.30.</P>
<P N="8">8. Q. Is it not to the Di&s;honour of God to care for &s;uch mean Things?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No: 1 Becau&s;e it is no Di&s;honour to God that he hath created them: 2. Becau&s;e he thereby neglects nothing of greater Moment: 3dly. Becau&s;e he often thereby executes Matters of the greate&s;t Importance.</P>
<P N="9">9. Q. Doth the divine Providence extend to tho&s;e Things which happen accidentally, as we &s;ay?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes. <HI>The Lot is ca&s;t into the Lap, but the whole di&s;po|&s;ing thereof is from the Lord.</HI> Prov. 16.33.</P>
<P N="10">10. Q. Doth any Thing happen by Chance?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Not as to God, but only in our Apprehen&s;ion of Things.</P>
<P N="11">11. Q Doth God's Providence al&s;o concern Life and Death?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes: The Time thereof is al&s;o determined by him. Job. 14.5. <HI>Seeing his Days are determined, the Number of his Months are with thee, thou ha&s;t appointed his Bounds that he cannot pa&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. Q. Can a Man lengthen or &s;horten his Time of Life?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Not in Re&s;pect to God, but only in Re&s;pect to Man.</P>
<P N="13">13. Q. Is it not then in vain to u&s;e Means to pre&s;erve Life?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No: God hath al&s;o decreed tho&s;e Means to that End, and he al&s;o giveth Man a willing Mind to u&s;e them.</P>
<P N="14">14. Q. Doth God's Providence al&s;o direct the mo&s;t volun|tary Things?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; It even directs the very Thoughts. Prov. 21.1. <HI>The King's Heart is in the Hand of the Lord, as Rivers of Wa|ter, he turneth it whither &s;o ever he will.</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. But don't that take away the Freedom of Man's Will?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; For this governing or directing is no Force upon, but the inclining the Will which acts freely.</P>
<P N="16">16. Q. Doth the Providence of God concern it&s;elf al&s;o about Sin?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; He permits it, limits and directs it to a certain End. Gen. 50.20. <HI>But as for you ye thought Evil again&s;t me,
<PB N="37" REF="010001_0037_0F7B7AD0C39D1450">but God meant it unto good, to bring to pa&s;s, as it is this Day, to &s;ave much People alive.</HI></P>
<P N="17">17. Q. Is God the Author of Sin?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; A holy God cannot be the Author of any Thing that is &s;inful, he hates and puni&s;hes Sin.</P>
<P N="18">18. Q. Doth God work that which is good?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes. 2 Cor 3.5. <HI>Not that we are &s;ufficient of our&s;elves, to think any Thing as of our&s;elves, but our Sufficiency is of God.</HI></P>
<P N="19">19. Q. Doth God once for all give Power to do Good, or mu&s;t we be influenced in each particular Action?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We mu&s;t receive his Influence in each particular Action, exciting us, and co-operating with us, to that End. Phil. 2.13. <HI>For it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good Plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P N="20">20. Q In what Re&s;pects is the Doctrine of Providence pro|fitable?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It teacheth the People of God Patience in Adver&s;ity, and Thankfulne&s;s in Pro&s;perity, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> in God in Re&s;pect to future Things. Job 1.21.22. <HI>naked came I out of my Mo|ther's Womb, and naked &s;hall I return thither; The</HI> LORD <HI>gave and the</HI> LORD <HI>hath taken away, ble&s;&s;ed be the Name of the</HI> LORD. <HI>In all this Job &s;inned not, nor charged God fooli&s;hly.</HI> Gen. 32 10. <HI>I am not worthy of the lea&s;t of all the Mercies and of the Truth, which thou ba&s;t &s;hewed unto thy Servants; for with my Staff I pa&s;&s;ed over this Jordan, and now I am become two Bands.</HI> Job. 13.15. <HI>Though he &s;lay me, yet will I tru&s;t in him, but I will maintain mine own Ways before him.</HI></P>

<P N="11">11. Q. What is &s;piritual Death?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. A Separation from God's Favour. 2. An Impo|tency under Sin.

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of the Covenant of Grace.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Que&s;t. IS there another Covenant e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Room of the Covenant of Works?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes: The Covenant of Grace.</P>
<P N="2">2. Q. When was it e&s;tabli&s;hed?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Immediately after the Fall. Gen. 3.15. <HI>I will put En|mity between thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed and her Seed, it &s;hall brui&s;e thy Head, and thou &s;hall brui&s;e his Heel.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Q. What is the Covenant of Grace?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Covenant of Grace is, that Method by which God in Chri&s;t becomes the Sinner's Property, and the Sinner the Property of God. Jer. 31.33. <HI>But this &s;hall be the Covenant that I will make with the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael, after tho&s;e Days, &s;aith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward Parts, and write it in their Hearts, and I will be their God, and they &s;hall be my People.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Q. With whom is it e&s;tabli&s;hed?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Only with the Elect Sinner. Ezek. 16.6. <HI>And when I pa&s;&s;ed by thee, and &s;aw thee polluted in thine own Blood, I &s;aid unto thee, when thou wa&s;t in thy Blood; Live, yea, I &s;aid unto thee when thou wa&s;t in thy Blood, live.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Q. What doth God require in this Covenant?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That which God requires in, is al&s;o a Promi&s;e of the Covenant; Namely, Faith in Chri&s;t. Ho&s;. 2.20. <HI>I will even betroth thee unto me in Faithfulne&s;s, and thou &s;halt know the Lord.</HI> Hab. 2.4. <HI>But the Ju&s;t &s;hall live by his Faith.</HI> P&s;. 27.8. <HI>When thou &s;aid&s;t, &s;eek ye my Face, my Heart &s;aid unto thee, thy Face Lord, will I &s;eek.</HI></P>
<P N="6"><PB N="46" REF="010001_0046_0F7B7AD9F64CC990">
6. Q. What doth God promi&s;e therein?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Grace here, and eternal Life hereafter. Acts 16.31. <HI>Believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved, thou and thy Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Q. Is this Covenant in all Ages e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P N="8">8. Q. Were then Believers under the Old Te&s;tament Parta|kers of all the real Benefits of the Covenant of Grace?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; For <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us is the &s;ame Ye&s;terday and to Day and for ever.</HI> Heb. 13.8.</P>
<P N="9">9. Q. How doth the Sinner enter into this Covenant?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> God doth fir&s;t draw near the Sinner, when he invites and be&s;eeches him with Love. 2 Cor. 5.20. <Q>Now we are Amba&s;&s;adors for Chri&s;t, as though God did be&s;eech you by us: We pray you in Chri&s;t's Stead, be ye reconciled to God.</Q> With the greate&s;t Earne&s;tne&s;s and Uprightne&s;s, Ezek 38.11. <Q>Say unto them as I live &s;aith the Lord God, I have no Plea|&s;ure in the Death of the Wicked, but that the Wicked turn from his Way and live, turn ye, turn ye from your Evil Ways: For why will ye die O Hou&s;e of I&s;rael.</Q> And &s;olv|ing all their Difficulties, I&s;aiah 55.2. <Q>Wherefore do ye &s;pend Money for that which is not Bread, and your Labour for that which &s;atisfieth not? Hearken diligently unto me, and eat that which is Good, and let your Soul delight it&s;elf in Fatne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P N="10">10. Q. What follows &s;uch an Invitation?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Hereby God <HI>draweth the Sinner with Cords of a Man, and Bands of Love.</HI> Ho&s;. 11.4.</P>
<P N="11">11. Q. What doth the called Sinner on his Part?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He receives the LORD as his GOD, and wholly &s;urren|ders him&s;elf to him as his Property, Cant. 2.16. <HI>My belov|ed is mine and I am his, be feedeth among the Lillies.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. Q. What are the Properties of this Con&s;ent?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Sinner performs this Solemnly, Freely, Humbly, Faithfully, Uprightly, with a full Con&s;ent as well to the De|mands as to the Promi&s;es of the Covenant, P&s;. 51.6. <HI>Be|hold
<PB N="47" REF="010001_0047_0F7B7ADB5F5C07C8">thou de&s;ire&s;t Truth in the inward Parts: And in the hid|den Part thou &s;halt make me to know Wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. Q. What are the Effects of this Con&s;ent?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> God remembereth his Covenant for ever. P&s;. 105.8. <HI>He hath remembered his Covenant for ever, the Word which he commanded to a Thou&s;and Generations.</HI> And tho&s;e in Cove|nant have a Right to a&s;k for all Things that are nece&s;&s;ary to Life and Salvation. P&s;. 74.19, 20, 21. <HI>O deliver not the Soul of thy Turtle dove unto the Multitude of the Wicked forget not the Congregation of the Poor for ever. Have Re&s;pect unto the Covenant: For the dark Places of the Earth are full of the Habitations of Cruelty. O let not the Oppre&s;&s;ed return a&s;hamed: Let the Poor and Needy prai&s;e thy Name.</HI></P>

<P N="8">8. Q. Why are believers called Chri&s;tians?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e they are partakers of Chri&s;t's anointing, 1 John 2.20, <HI>and</HI> 27. <HI>But ye have an Unction from the Holy One, and ye know all Things.</HI> Ver. 27. <HI>But the anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you: And ye need not that any Man teach you: But as the &s;ame anointing teacheth you of all Things, and is truth, and is no lie: And even as it hath taught you ye &s;hall abide in him.</HI> 1 Pet. 2.9. <HI>But ye are a cho|&s;en Generation, a Royal Prie&s;thood, an Holy Nation, a peculiar People, that ye &s;hould &s;hew forth the Prai&s;es of him, who hath called you out of Darkne&s;s to his marvellous Light.</HI></P>

<P N="8">8. Q. Why mu&s;t he be God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To &s;upport the human Nature in bearing the infinite Wrath of God; And to add an infinite Value to his Merits.

<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes there is an external, and an internal, or effectual calling.</P>
<P N="6">6. Q. How are Sinners externally called?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By the Word of God, Prov. 9.3 to 6. <HI>She hath &s;ent forth her Maidens, &s;he crieth upon the highe&s;t Places of the City: Who&s;o is &s;imple let him turn in hither: As for him that wanteth Under&s;tanding &s;he &s;aith to him, come eat of my Bread, and drink of the Wine which I have mingled.

<P N="8">8. Q. Who are externally or outwardly called?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> All Sorts of Men, even tho&s;e who are not elected, Matt. 20.16.&mdash;<HI>For many are called but few are cho&s;en.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Q. Is then the external Call general?</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> No; <HI>It is in vain though Paul plant and Apollos wa|ter, it is God that giveth the Increa&s;e.</HI> 1 Cor. 3.7.</P>
<P N="13">13. Q. What mu&s;t &s;till be added to the external Call?</P>

<P N="14">14. Q. Who are they that are internally called?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Only the Elect, Rom. 8.30. <Q>Moreover whom he did prede&s;tinate, them he al&s;o called; And whom he called, them he al&s;o ju&s;tified; And whom he ju&s;tified them he al&s;o glorified.</Q></P>
<P N="15">15. Q. What is internal calling?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is a powerful Change in the whole Man?</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; The Under&s;tanding, Will, Affections, and Con|ver&s;ation.</P>
<P N="17">17. Q. How are they by Nature?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Under&s;tanding is darkened, the Will is perver&s;e, the Affections irregular, and the Conver&s;ation &s;inful. Eph. 4.18. <HI>Having the Under&s;tanding darkened being alienated from the Life of God, through Ignorance that is in them, becau&s;e of the Blindne&s;s of their Hearts.</HI> Rom. 8.7. <HI>Becau&s;e the carnal Mind is Enmity again&s;t God, for it is not &s;ubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</HI> Jude ver. 12.13. <HI>The&s;e are Spots in your Fea&s;ts of Charity, when they fea&s;t with you, feeding them&s;elves without Fear: Clouds they are without Wa|ter, carried about of Winds; Trees who&s;e Fruit withereth, without Fruit, twice dead plucked up by the Roots, raging Waves of the Sea, foaming out their own Shame; Wandring Stars, to whom is re&s;erved the Blackne&s;s of Darkne&s;s forever.</HI> Titus 3.3. <HI>For we our&s;elves al&s;o were &s;ometimes fooli&s;h, dif|obedient, deceived, &s;erving divers Lu&s;ts, and Plea&s;ures, living in Malice and Envy, hateful and hating one another.</HI></P>
<P N="18"><PB N="70" REF="010001_0070_0F7B7AF3DBACEA48">
18. Q. What is then the Effect of this internal calling?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Under&s;tanding is enlightened to know God in his Work of Salvation, Je&s;us in his precious Excellencies, and them&s;elves in their Depravity; being ju&s;tly expo&s;ed to the Cur&s;e. 1 Cor. 2, 12, 13. <HI>Now we have received, not the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the Things which are freely given us of God. Which Things al&s;o we &s;peak, not in Words, which Man's Wi&s;|dom teacheth, but which the Holy Gho&s;t teacheth, comparing &s;piritual Things with &s;piritual.</HI> The Will is inclined to &s;erve and glorify God. Rom. 7.15. <HI>For that which I do I allow not: For what I would that do I not, but what I hate that do I.</HI></P>
<P>The Affections are clean&s;ed to hate Sin, and on the con|trary to love God as the &s;upreme Good, to have a De&s;ire after Holine&s;s, &amp;c. Rom. 6.19.&mdash;<HI>For as you have yielded your Members Servants to Uncleanne&s;s and to Iniquity, unto Ini|quity: Even &s;o now yield your Members Servants to Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s unto Holine&s;s.</HI> And the whole Conver&s;ation is &s;anctified.</P>
<P N="19">19. Q. Is this internal calling powerful?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; It hath an irre&s;i&s;table Power. Eph. 1.19, 20. <HI>And what is the exceeding Greatne&s;s of his Power to usward, who believe, according to the working of his Power; which he wrought in Chri&s;t, when he rai&s;ed him from the dead, and &s;et him in Heaven at his own Right Hand in heavenly Places.</HI></P>
<P N="20">20. Q. Is any Thing more done herein than a per&s;uading the Man by moral Arguments?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, there is an inward inclining of the <HI>Will.</HI> Phil. 2 13. <HI>For it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good Plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P N="21">21. Q. Doth God then compel Men?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; But he makes them willing. Cant. 1.4, <HI>Draw me, we will run after thee: The King hath brought me into his Chambers: We will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remem|ber thy Love more than Wine: the upright love thee,</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. Que&s;t. ARE tho&s;e who are internally called, al&s;o ju&s;|tified?</P>

<P N="2">2. Q. What is Ju&s;tification?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The being ab&s;olved from Guilt and Puni&s;hment, and the having a Right to eternal Life, freely given.

<P><PB N="75" REF="010001_0075_0F7B7AF79AD73740">
<HI>A,</HI> No; It is only a Sentence or Ab&s;olution in Behalf of, or concerning a Per&s;on, as is done by Judges in Courts of Ju&s;tice among Men.</P>
<P N="6">6. Q. Is it taken in this Sen&s;e in Scripture?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; Thus it is oppo&s;ed to Condemnation. Pro. 17.15. <HI>He that ju&s;tifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the Ju&s;t, even they both are Abomination to the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Q. Is it u&s;ed in this Sen&s;e, when the Ju&s;tification of a Sinner before God is &s;poken of.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes: Rom. 8.33, 34. <HI>Who &s;hall lay any Thing to the Charge of God's Elect? It is God that ju&s;tifieth who is he that condemneth? It is Chri&s;t that died, yea rather that is ri&s;en again, who is even at the Right Hand of God, who al&s;o maketh Interce&s;&s;ion for us.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Q. Who is it then that ab&s;olves or ju&s;tifies us?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> God the Father, who herein &s;u&s;tains the Character of a Judge, I&s;aiah 43.25. <HI>I even I am he that blotteth out thy Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, for mine own Sake, and will not remember thy Sins.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Q. What Character does the Son &s;u&s;tain in this Matter?</P>

<P N="11">11. Q. Can we then be a&s;&s;ured of our Ju&s;tification?</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> From all Sins without Di&s;tinction.</P>
<P N="13">13. Q. For who&s;e Sake are we ju&s;tified?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Only for the Sake of Chri&s;t, Rom. 3.24. <HI>Being ju&s;tified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>

<P N="15">15. Q. Why can we not be ju&s;tified for our own Works?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e the be&s;t of them are imperfect, and therefore cannot &s;atisfy the Ju&s;tice of God. James 3.2. <HI>For in many Things we offend all, if any Man offend not in Word, the &s;ame is a perfect Man, and able al&s;o to bridle the whole Body.</HI> I&s;aiah 64.6. <HI>But we are all as an unclean Thing, and all our Righ|teou&s;ne&s;&s;es are as filthy Rags, and we do all fade as a Leaf, and our Iniquities like the Wind, have taken us away.</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. Q. But in Order to our being ju&s;tified by the Merits of Chri&s;t, mu&s;t they not become ours?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Mo&s;t certainly they mu&s;t.

<P N="19">19. How do we receive that Righteou&s;ne&s;s?</P>

<P N="1">1. Que&s;t. HOW many Kinds of Faith are there?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Four Kinds; An hi&s;torical Faith, a temporary Faith, a Faith of Miracles, and a Saving Faith.</P>
<P N="2">2. Q. What is an hi&s;torical Faith?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is a bare A&s;&s;ent to a known Truth.</P>
<P N="3">3. Q. Is this a good Faith?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is nece&s;&s;ary, though not &s;ufficient. James 2.19. <HI>Thou believe&s;t that there is one God, thou doe&s;t well: The Devils al&s;o believe and tremble.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Q. What is a Temporary Faith?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is an A&s;&s;ent and Profe&s;&s;ion of the Truth for a Time, with &s;ome Degree of outward Satisfaction. Matt. 13.20, 21. <HI>But he that received the Seed into &s;tony Places, the &s;ame is he that heareth the Word, and anon with Joy receiveth it: Yet hath not any Root in him&s;elf, but dureth for a while: For when Tribulation or Per&s;ecution ari&s;eth becau&s;e of the Word, by and by he is offended.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Q. What is the Faith of Miracles?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is a &s;trong Per&s;ua&s;ion, that a Miracle &s;hall be per|formed, either by us, or in us. 1 Cor. 13.2.&mdash;<HI>And though I have all Faith, &s;o that I could remove Mountains, and have no Charity, I am nothing.</HI> Matt. 8.10. <HI>Je&s;us &s;aid verily I &s;ay unto you, I have not &s;ound &s;o great a Faith, no not I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P N="6"><PB N="78" REF="010001_0078_0F7B7AFA1D6A5988">
6. Q. When did that Faith take Place?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In that Age of the Church, when the working of Mi|racles were common.</P>
<P N="7">7. Q. Is this Faith of Miracles &s;aving?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No: As appears from 1 Cor. 13.2. <HI>And though I have all Faith, &s;o that I could remove Mountains, and have no Charity, I am nothing.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Q. In how many Things doth &s;aving Faith con&s;i&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In three Things; In Knowledge, A&s;&s;ent, and Tru&s;t. I&s;aiah 53.11.&mdash;<HI>By his Knowledge &s;hall my righteous Servant ju&s;tify many; For he &s;hall bear their Iniquities.</HI> John 3.33. <HI>He that hath received his Te&s;timony, hath &s;et to his Seal that God is true.</HI> I&s;aiah 27.5. <HI>Or let him take hold of my Strength that he may make Peace with me, and he &s;hall make Peace with me.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Q. Is not an implicit or blind Faith without Knowledge &s;ufficient?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; John 17.3. <HI>And this is Life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. Q. Which is the principal and properly ju&s;tifying Act of Faith?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is an Act of the Soul, whereby it doth heartily will and de&s;ire, that not only the Promi&s;es of the Go&s;pel may be true in them&s;elves; but al&s;o &s;uch an Act, whereby it doth de&s;ire and actually receive the Lord Je&s;us with the mo&s;t cor|dial Affection, as the only Cau&s;e of Salvation, with Denial of Self, and all other Creatures. John 1.12. <HI>But as many as received him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. Q. What are the Effects of the ju&s;tifying Act of Faith?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The particular and certain Application of the Promi&s;es of the Go&s;pel, and the Lord Je&s;us, to the very Per&s;on of every Believer. Gal. 2.20. <HI>I am crucified with Chri&s;t and I live; Yet not I but Chri&s;t liveth in me: And the Life
<PB N="79" REF="010001_0079_0F7B7AFACAF57350">which I now live in the Fle&s;h, I live by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave him&s;elf for me.</HI> A comfort|able Sen&s;e of this, every Believer doth not enjoy at all Times, by Rea&s;on of the Temptations of Satan, the Accu&s;ations of the Law, and Delu&s;ions of the Fle&s;h, But to attain this, every one ought to endeavour, who truly receive Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="12">12. Q. Can and mu&s;t Believers be a&s;&s;ured of the Reality of their Faith?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They can be a&s;&s;ured. 2 Tim. 1.12. <HI>For I know whom I have believed, and am per&s;uaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him again&s;t that Day.</HI> And they ought to endeavour after it. 2 Cor. 13 5. <HI>Examine your&s;elves whether you be in the Faith, prove your own&s;elves, know ye not your own&s;elves, how that Chri&s;t Je&s;us is in you, except ye be Reprobates.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. Q. Who worketh this Faith in us?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Holy Gho&s;t. Gal. 5.22. <HI>But the Fruit of the Spirit is&mdash;Faith.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. Q By what Means.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By the Word. Rom. 10.17. So then Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</P>
<P N="15">15. Q. Cannot we believe of our&s;elves?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; Eph. 2.8. <HI>For by Grace ye are &s;aved through Faith, and that not of your&s;elves; It is the Gift of God.</HI></P>

2. Q. What is Sanctification?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> A Renovation of the whole Man.</P>
<P N="3">3. Q. Is it not only a Change of the outward Actions?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No: But al&s;o of the Inward-Man. Rom. 12 2. <HI>Be not conformed to this World: But be ye transformed by the renewing of your Mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect Will of God</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Q. Doth not an external Change flow from this?</P>

<P N="5">5. Q. Who worketh Sanctification in us?</P>

<P N="6">6. Q. Is Sanctification nece&s;&s;ary?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; Heb. 12.14. <HI>Follow Peace with all Men and Holine&s;s, without which no Man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Q. Is Sanctification perfect in this Life?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; It is only in Part, and imperfect. Phil. 3.12. <HI>Not as though I had already attained, either were already per|fect: But I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which al&s;o I am apprehended of Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Q. Is Sanctification equally great in all Believers?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; It hath its &s;everal Degrees, in the one greater, in the other le&s;s. Eph. 4.13. <HI>Till we all come in the Unity of Faith, and of the Knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man, unto the Mea&s;ure of the Stature of the Fullne&s;s of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Q. Is it al&s;o changeable?</P>

<P N="10">10. Q. Can we totally loo&s;e it?</P>

<P N="12">12. Q. How do the People of God make Progre&s;s in Sanctification?</P>

<P N="6">6. Q. May we not u&s;e Wafers in this Supper?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; For they don't &s;ufficiently denote the &s;piritual Nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P N="7">7. Q. What doth the Bread in this Supper &s;ignify?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Body of Chri&s;t. 1 Cor. 11.24. <HI>And when he had given Thanks, he brake it, and &s;aid, take eat; this is my Body, which is broken for you: Do this in Remembrance of me.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Q. Mu&s;t the Bread be al&s;o broken?</P>

<P N="15">15. Q. Is Chri&s;t bodily pre&s;ent in the Elements of this Supper?</P>

<P N="16">16. Q. Are not Bread and Wine changed into his Fle&s;h and Blood?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No: They remain Bread and Wine even after the Ble&s;&s;ing or Con&s;ecration.</P>
<P N="17">17. Q. How then can Chri&s;t &s;ay: <HI>This is my Body?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The meaning is, This doth &s;ignify my Body?</P>
<P N="18">18. Q. Doth the Scripture often &s;peak thus?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; Frequently. 1 Cor. 10.4. <HI>The Rock was Chri&s;t.</HI> That is to &s;ay, it did &s;ignify Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="19">19. Q. Cannot we then eat and drink Chri&s;t him&s;elf?</P>

<P N="2">2. Q. Doth then the whole of Man die?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; For the Soul is immortal. Matt. 10.28. <HI>Fear not them which kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul; But rather fear him which is able to de&s;troy both Soul and Body in Hell.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Q. How many Placesare there for the Soul after Death?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Only two; Hell or Heaven.

<P><HI>A.</HI> With the &s;ame Bodies; otherwi&s;e it would be no Re|&s;urrection but a new Creation; This was the Expectation of Job; <HI>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he &s;hall &s;tand at the latter Day upon the Earth, and though after my Skin, Worms de&s;troy this Body, yet in my Fle&s;h &s;hall I &s;ee God: Whom I &s;hall &s;ee for my&s;elf, and mine Eyes &s;hall behold, and not another; though my Reins be con&s;umed within me.</HI> Job. 19.25, 26, 27.</P>
