<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO THE REVEREND Mr. GEORGE WHITEFIELD.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>COME on, my Whitefield! (&s;ince the &s;trife is pa&s;t,</L>
<L>And friends at fir&s;t are friends again at la&s;t)</L>
<L>Our hands, and hearts, and coun&s;els let us join</L>
<L>In mutual league, to advance the work Divine,</L>
<L>Our one contention now, our &s;ingle aim.</L>
<L>To pluck poor &s;ouls as brands out of the flame;</L>
<L>To &s;pread the victory of that bloody cro&s;s,</L>
<L>And ga&s;p our late&s;t breath in the Redeemer's cau&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Too long, alas! we gave to Satan place,</L>
<L>When party-zeal put on an angel's face,</L>
<L>Too long we h&s;t'ned to the couz'ning fiend,</L>
<L>Who&s;e trumpet &s;ounded, "For the faith contend!"</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="023064_0004_0FBC1B685720BB08">
With ha&s;ty blindfold rage, in error's night,</L>
<L>How did we with our fellow-&s;oldiers fight!</L>
<L>We could not then our father's children know,</L>
<L>But each mi&s;took his brother for his foe.</L>
<L>"Foes to the truth, can you in con&s;cience &s;pace?</L>
<L>"Tear them, the (tempter cry'd) in pieces, tear!"</L>
<L>So thick the darkne&s;s, &s;o confus'd the noi&s;e,</L>
<L>We took the &s;tranger's for the &s;hepherd's voice;</L>
<L>Ra&s;h nature wav'd the controver&s;ial &s;word,</L>
<L>On fire to fight the battles of the Lord,</L>
<L>Fraternal love from every brea&s;t was driv'n,</L>
<L>And bleeding Charity return'd to heaven.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Saviour &s;aw our &s;trife with pitying eye,</L>
<L>And ca&s;t a look that made the &s;hadows fly:</L>
<L>Soon as the day-&s;pring in his pre&s;ence &s;hone,</L>
<L>We found the two fierce armies were but one;</L>
<L>Common our hope, and family, and name,</L>
<L>Our arms, our captain, and our crown the &s;ame,</L>
<L>Inli&s;ted all beneath Emanuel's &s;ign,</L>
<L>And purchas'd every &s;oul with precious blood divine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then let us cordially again embrace,</L>
<L>Nor e'er infringe the league of go&s;pel-grace;</L>
<L>Let us in Je&s;us' name to battle go,</L>
<L>And turn our arms again&s;t the common foe;</L>
<L>Fight &s;ide by &s;ide beneath our Captain's eye,</L>
<L>Cha&s;e the Phili&s;tines, on their &s;houlders fly,</L>
<L>And, more than conquerors, in the harne&s;s die.</L>

<L>To &s;hout the univer&s;sal Saviour's Name,</L>
<L>It matters not; if, all our conflicts pa&s;t,</L>
<L>Before the great white throne we meet at la&s;t:</L>
<L>Our only care while &s;ojourning below,</L>
<L>Our real Faith by real Love to &s;how:</L>
<L>To bla&s;t the aliens' hope, and let them &s;ee</L>

<L>Not in a party's narrow banks confin'd,</L>
<L>Not by a &s;amele&s;s of opinions join'd,</L>
<L>But cemented with the Redeemer's blood,</L>
<L>And bound together in the heart of God.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Can we forget from whence our union came,</L>
<L>When fir&s;t we &s;imply met in Je&s;us' name?</L>
<L>The name my&s;terious of the God unknown,</L>
<L>Who&s;e &s;ecret love allur'd, and drew us on</L>
<L>Thro' a long, lonely, legal wilderne&s;s,</L>
<L>To find the promis'd land of go&s;pel peace.</L>
<L>True yoke-fellows, we then agreed to draw</L>
<L>Th' intolerable burden of the Law,</L>
<L>And jointly lab'ring on with zealous &s;trife,</L>
<L>Strengthen'd each other's hands to work <HI>for</HI> Life:</L>
<L>To turn again&s;t the world our &s;teady face,</L>
<L>And, valiant for the truth, enjoy di&s;grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then, when we &s;erv'd our God thro' fear alone,</L>
<L>Our views, our &s;tudies, and our hearts were one;</L>

No &s;malle&s;t difference damp'd the &s;ocial flame:</L>

<L>Our love was greater when our light was le&s;s?</L>
<L>When darkly thro' a gla&s;s with &s;ervile awe,</L>
<L>We fir&s;t the &s;piritual commandment &s;aw,</L>
<L>Could we not then, our mutual love to &s;how,</L>
<L>Thro' fire and water for each other go?</L>
<L>We could:&mdash;we did:&mdash;In a &s;trange land I &s;tood,</L>

<L>Left country, fame, and ea&s;e, and friends behind,</L>
<L>And, eager all heav'ns coun&s;els to explore,</L>
<L>Flew thro' the watry world and gra&s;p'd the &s;hore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor did I linger, at my friend's de&s;ire,</L>
<L>To tempt the furnace, and abide the fire:</L>
<L>When &s;uddenly &s;ent forth, from the high-ways</L>
<L>I call'd poor out-ca&s;ts to the fea&s;t of grace;</L>
<L>Urg'd to pur&s;ue the work by thee begun,</L>

<L>Ah! wherefore did we ever &s;eem to part,</L>
<L>Or cla&s;h in &s;entiment, while one in heart?</L>
<L>What dire device did the old Serpent find,</L>
<L>To put a&s;under tho&s;e whom God had join'd?</L>
<L>From folly and &s;elf-love Opinion ro&s;e,</L>

To baffle and divert our noble&s;t aim,</L>

<L>And glad the world with one triumphant hour.</L>
</LG>
