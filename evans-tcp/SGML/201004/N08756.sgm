<HEAD>THE CASE OF GREAT-BRITAIN AND AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P>THE affairs of Great-Britain and her Colonies are at a cri&s;is. If our ju&s;tice or our moderation dictate to us the making any conce&s;&s;ions, they &s;hould be made whil&s;t they can yet be <HI>imputed</HI> to our moderation or our ju&s;tice. The pre&s;ent Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament &s;hould determine upon &s;ome permanent &s;y&s;tem in this point. Great-Bri|tain &s;hould fix the Preten&s;ions which &s;he will never relinqui&s;h, and the Colonies &s;hould have certain information of tho&s;e claims which they mu&s;t &s;ubmit to. Until &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem be re&s;olved upon, there will be irre&s;olution on the one &s;ide, and repugnance on the other; and no &s;y&s;tem can be &s;table that is not founded upon equity and wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>IT is the re&s;olution of the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try, it is &s;aid, to impo&s;e taxes upon the Colonies, by the authority of the Briti&s;h Parliament, and to <HI>compel</HI> the Colonies to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. To examine the ju&s;tice and the policy of tho&s;e mea&s;ures, and to &s;ugge&s;t others, which ap|pear to me le&s;s exceptionable, in each of tho&s;e particulars, is my object.</P>
<P>THE Colonies, by their re&s;pective Charters, have not uniform|ly the &s;ame privileges, or the &s;ame con&s;titution. But though they differ in many particulars, they are alike in the following; name|ly, That the inhabitants of every one of them have a right to tax them&s;elves by their representatives, in their provincial a&s;&s;emblies;
<PB N="2" REF="011193_0003_0F85CD754CB5E030">that none of them vote for repre&s;entatives in the Briti&s;h Parliament; and that all of them are to enjoy the freedom of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects. In the &s;earch for arguments again&s;t the Americans, the validity of tho&s;e charters has not pa&s;&s;ed unque&s;tioned. I &s;hall &s;ay, however, but a little in their &s;upport, as the attacks have been very weak and very few. From the earlie&s;t times down to the pre&s;ent, the di&s;po&s;ition of foreign territory belonging to Great-Britain has al|ways been ve&s;ted in the Executive. It is a power which the Re|&s;toration and the Revolution have left un&s;haken. From the ce&s;&s;ion of Tangier to that of Guadaloupe, how frequently has it been exerci&s;ed? And in the particular in&s;tance of Gibraltar, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s a law to re&s;train it.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At pre&s;ent it is unalienable from Great-Britain.</NOTE> If then the Crown, at the time when it granted the charters, could have ceded the territory of America to a foreign power, could it not have fixed the terms on which its pre&s;ent and future inhabitants &s;hould continue the &s;ub|jects of Great Britain? Where it could have relinqui&s;hed <HI>all</HI> the authority po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Great-Britain, certainly it could relinqui&s;h a <HI>part</HI> of that authority. Where it could make a <HI>total alienation</HI> to enemies even, &s;urely it could make a <HI>modified grant</HI> to &s;ubjects. But &s;uppo&s;e that the Crown had not been legally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that power, is there not a term after which uninterrupted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion confers a right? Have not the Coloni&s;ts po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their charters much longer than that term? Have they not dedicated their lives and fortunes to the improvement of that country, from a depend|ance upon the validity of their title? Have not the Briti&s;h Parlia|ment &s;een and acquie&s;ced in their doing &s;o? Has not Great-Bri|tain, in her exclu&s;ive trade, received a valuable con&s;ideration? Surely then it would be mon&s;trous inju&s;tice to deprive them of rights &s;o purcha&s;ed and &s;o confirmed. It has al&s;o been urged by &s;ome, that the Parliament can <HI>revoke</HI> the&s;e charters when it &s;hall think proper; for that it can take away from any city or corporate town, in England, its charter, notwith&s;tanding any length of time it may have enjoined it. I an&s;wer, that if an Engli&s;h city or cor|porate town had &s;o purcha&s;ed their charter, as the Coloni&s;ts have purcha&s;ed theirs, and had &s;o long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, it would be unju&s;t in the Parliament to re&s;cind or violate it. But the compari&s;on is totally unfair; for the charter of an Engli&s;h city or corporate town, and tho&s;e of the Colonies, be&s;ides other material differences, have this e&s;&s;ential one, that the former give a Right of repre&s;enta|tion in the Briti&s;h Parliament and that the latter do not. If therefore the charter of a Briti&s;h city or borough be re&s;cinded by Parliament, it is re&s;cinded in an a&s;&s;embly which is the repre&s;en|tative of that city or borough. Where a part of England only is concerned, the legi&s;lature of England may claim unlimited power, as a body to which all the rights of Engli&s;hmen are made over and entru&s;ted. But the charters of America are agreements made be|tween England on the one part, and the Colonies on the other.
<PB N="3" REF="011193_0004_0F85CD7656B64908">The Hou&s;e of Commons of England is the repre&s;entative of one of the contracting parties only, namely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">; and therefore cannot act for both. They have none of them any &s;hare in elect|ing it; it cannot therefore legi&s;late for them. It is a party, and cannot therefore be a judge.</P>
<P>THE opponents of the Americans admit, that they are intitled to the privilege, of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects; that they are a free people. Could we determine what the&s;e privileges are, and what this free|dom, the di&s;pute would be at an end. The American a&s;&s;erts, that he is deprived of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential privilege of a Briton, and a free man, if the colony to which he belongs can be taxed by an a&s;&s;embly in which it is not repre&s;ented. The advocate for admi|ni&s;tration, an&s;wers, that there are many natives of Great-Britain her&s;elf who are not repre&s;ented; for that there are many who have not votes in the choice of repre&s;entatives, and that the Coloni&s;ts have no cau&s;e to complain, when they are in the &s;ame condition as <HI>many</HI> of the natives of Great-Britain. Would a Colony pretend to a better con&s;titution than the mother country, from whence &s;he derives it? As this argument has been frequently repeated, I &s;up|po&s;e it to be a favourite one with admini&s;tration; and as it is the only method that has been tried to reconcile their a&s;&s;ertion, that "the Briti&s;h Parliament has a right to tax the Colonies," with their conce&s;&s;ions, that the Colonies have the privileges of Britons, and are a free people; let us li&s;ten to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> American pleading his own cau&s;e, in an&s;wer to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> argument:
<Q>I do not claim a better con&s;titution than my mother <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">: you have mi&s;repre&s;ented my claims. I have &s;aid that a right of &s;uffrage in the choice of our repre&s;entatives is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> of Briti&s;h privileges; but I have <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> &s;aid, that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> Briton enjoys that Right; nor do I require that every Coloni&s;t &s;hould enjoy it. There are many Britons who have no vote in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, &s;o are there many Coloni&s;ts who have no vote in the election of our <HI>provincial</HI> repre&s;entatives; alledge, if you will, that in being taxed by your Parliament, you are taxed by an <HI>imperfect</HI> repre&s;entative; in being taxed by our <HI>provincial</HI> a&s;&s;em|blies, we are taxed by a repre&s;entative <HI>as</HI> imperfect. Our free|dom therefore, in point of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, when we are taxed by our <HI>own</HI> a&s;&s;emblies, is not greater than yours; it is only equal to it; our con&s;titution is an image of your. But if we are to be taxed by your Parliament, our con&s;titution no longer re&s;embles yours, and our freedom is annihilated. If there be many Britons who have <HI>not</HI> a vote in the choice of their repre&s;entatives, there are al&s;o many that <HI>have.</HI> The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a 40<ABBR>s.</ABBR> freehold, in Britain, confers the privilege of a vote: the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole continent of America, does not confer that privilege. Do you not know the infinite difference between a nation where <HI>all</HI> have <HI>not</HI> the power of voting for their representatives, and a nation where <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> have that power? The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> is <HI>your</HI> condi|tion,
<PB N="4" REF="011193_0005_0F85CD76883CCF78">
and therefore you are a free people; the former is what we claim; the latter is the condition of &s;laves, and that is what you offer. We claim the right of &s;uffrage, as the privileges of Britons, and you tell us we have it, becau&s;e we are like tho&s;e Britons who have it <HI>not!</HI> We claim the &s;ame con&s;titution as Great-Britain, and you offer us only the <HI>defect</HI> of that con&s;titu|tion, but deny us its <HI>advantages.</HI> England cannot be taxed but by an a&s;&s;embly, where her land is repre&s;ented by Knights, her monied intere&s;t by Citizens and Burge&s;&s;es, and therefore &s;he is a free nation. Is then America on a par with England, in point of Freedom? If &s;he can be taxed by an A&s;&s;embly, to which her freeholders &s;end <HI>no</HI> Knights, and her cities <HI>no</HI> Citi|zens. You &s;ay that your right of &s;uffrage is partially di&s;tributed, in Britain; give us then a right of &s;uffrage <HI>as</HI> partially di&s;tribut|ed in America. For this repre&s;entation, partial and imper|fect as you call it, your Magna Chartas have been demanded, your patriots have bled, and your monarchs have been dethron|ed. Was this for nothing? yet this you deny to the Ameri|cans, though you &s;ay to us, Ye have the privileges of Britons.</Q></P>
<Q><P>BUT there is yet another defect in your argument. For it is not true that we are in <HI>as good</HI> a condition as tho&s;e Britons whom you call unrepre&s;ented, and who are not electors: for even <HI>they</HI> have this great advantage, that both the repre&s;entative and the electors pay a part of the tax, as well as tho&s;e who have no &s;uf|frage: whereas if the Hou&s;e of Commons of England &s;hould tax the Americans, neither the repre&s;entatives nor the electors would pay any proportion of what they impo&s;ed upon us; they would not tax, but <HI>untax</HI> them&s;elves. The condition therefore of an Engli&s;hman who has no &s;uffrage, when taxed by the Bri|ti&s;h legi&s;lature, and of an American taxed by the &s;ame autho|rity, are totally di&s;&s;imilar. Place them in &s;ituations which bear <HI>any</HI> &s;imilitude, and it will &s;hew in the &s;tronge&s;t light, the in|ju&s;tice of the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures. Suppo&s;e then that the Parlia|ment of Britain &s;hould impo&s;e a tax, from which them&s;elves and tho&s;e who voted for them &s;hould be exempted, and which &s;hould be paid entirely by tho&s;e who had no &s;uffrages; this would bear <HI>&s;ome</HI> re&s;emblance to their taxing the Americans; and would not this be unparalleled inju&s;tice? But if even this (unju&s;t as you mu&s;t e&s;teem it) were the practice of your Parlia|ment, the condition of a non-voting Engli&s;hman would &s;till be infinitely preferable to ours; for even &s;uch a tax as I have &s;tated, would fall upon the relations, the friends, the depend|ants, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, the manufacturers, the labourers of Briti&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">. The legi&s;lator would feel its effects, almo&s;t in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly, he would find his own intere&s;t immediately concern|ed he would therefore u&s;e &s;ome moderation. Be&s;ides, he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, he can judge of their abilities, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> wounded at the &s;ight of their di&s;tre&s;&s;es. But he can|not
<PB N="5" REF="011193_0006_0F85CD77A8185010">&s;ee our mi&s;ery, he cannot judge of our abilities; and his tenants and his manufacturers will feel the <HI>immediate</HI> effects of our ruin, not in their di&s;tre&s;s, but in their exoneration. If therefore the legi&s;lature of Britain &s;hould adopt &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of unparalleled inju&s;tice, with re&s;pect to the non-voting inhabi|tants of Britain, yet, even the &s;ufferers by, and the objects of that inju&s;tice, would be happy, in compari&s;on of us. Suppo&s;e, for a moment, if you can bear the thought, &s;uppo&s;e for a mo|ment, that your Hou&s;e of Commons were not elected by you, that they were an hereditary body, in no wi&s;e indebted to your choice; would you not be an en&s;laved and an unhappy people: but even then you would be happier than we are. A body of 500 men, &s;ituated in the mid&s;t of &s;even millions, and taxing tho&s;e &s;even millions, would &s;urely be more bound to modera|tion, by fear, if not by principle, than the &s;ame body, a&s;&s;i&s;ted and &s;upported by tho&s;e &s;even millions, in taxing two millions who are at a di&s;tance. To oppre&s;s, in one in&s;tance, would at lea&s;t be infamy, if it would not be puni&s;hment; in the other they might find it popularity, they might think it patrioti&s;m. Mr. P&mdash;tt &s;aid, (if I mi&s;take not) that every man in England could huzza at an election: even that method of expre&s;&s;ing one's wi&s;hes, is &s;ome &s;atisfaction, and has &s;ome influence; the &s;houtings of the people have had great effects; and the very murmurs of Engli&s;hmen, had perhaps more &s;hare in the repeal of the &s;tamp-act, than the united voice of America. We cannot even <HI>huzza</HI> at a Briti&s;h election!</P>
<P>THE right of pre&s;enting petitions to parliament was deemed of &s;o much importance, that it was in&s;erted in the Bill of Rights. In this fundamental right, the bulwark again&s;t parliamentary op|pre&s;&s;ion, as well as every other, under what di&s;advantages &s;hould we labour, if you were to make laws for us? How different is the effect of a petition pre&s;ented by the hands of the injured, enforced by their a&s;&s;iduity, and recommended by their tears, from that of our paper-repre&s;entations? They are &s;ubject to be mi&s;repre&s;ented in a thou&s;and ways.</P>
<P>THEY come cold, and you do not feel them; often too late, and you cannot comply with them, and what was done by you through inattention and mi&s;take, mu&s;t be maintained <HI>for dignity;</HI> in a word, they do not &s;trike home, either upon your caution or your kindne&s;s, your affections or your fears. In this parti|cular, the very women and children of England, have an in|fluence upon parliament, of which the Americans are de&s;titute. How different is your lot from ours! In the character of an American, to the people of England I &s;peak. Your frequent elections are a valuable privilege to you; what privilege are they to us? At the clo&s;e of a parliament, you expect popular mea&s;ures, from the &s;ears and the hopes of your repre&s;entatives.
<PB N="6" REF="011193_0007_0F85CD77F0335718">But who will find it his intere&s;t to be a friend to America? They will wi&s;h to gain the favour of their countrymen, and therefore will burthen America, in order to di&s;burthen England. What to you is a valuable privilege, will be to us a &s;ource of repeated oppre&s;&s;ion. We are wor&s;e even than your Papi&s;ts. In being excluded from the right of &s;uffrage, they are like us; and as they pay double land-tax, in that <HI>additional</HI> payment the re&s;em|blance continues; for it is a tax impo&s;ed by men whom they had no &s;hare in electing, and it is a tax which tho&s;e who im|po&s;e it do not pay. But this di&s;ability in point of &s;uffrage, and this <HI>additional</HI> payment, are penalties inflicted on your Papi&s;ts; and why? Allegiance as by law required is a quality e&s;&s;ential to being a &s;ubject. Your Papi&s;ts are defective in that quality. They are con&s;idered as not completely &s;ubjects, and, as &s;uch, penalties are inflicted on them. Your only ju&s;tification for in|flicting the&s;e penalties on them, is that you doubt their being &s;ubjects. Your only pretence for inflicting the &s;ame penalties on us, is that we are &s;ubjects. <HI>Same</HI> penalties, did I &s;ay, nay wor&s;e; for as they are inflicted on us, without offence, we cannot by a di&s;continuation of offence, exempt our&s;elves from the&s;e grievances. The Papi&s;t, by becoming a Prote&s;tant, can free him&s;elf from this di&s;ability, and this double taxation: but we cannot free our&s;elves from this mi&s;ery, but by cea&s;ing to be Americans. Be&s;ides, in every other ca&s;e, except that addition of land-tax, your Papi&s;ts are in as good a &s;ituation as any of the re&s;t of your inhabitants who have not votes: but in <HI>every</HI> tax you lay upon us, we are in as bad a &s;ituation as your Papi&s;ts are in that one. Be&s;ides, your Papi&s;ts are connected with their legi&s;lators, by relation&s;hip, friend&s;hip, neighbourhood, or de|pendance. Their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions too are Briti&s;h, and they mu&s;t have influence, tho' they have not votes. And the great right of petitioning, they po&s;&s;e&s;s, with all its advantages, and can en|force their petitions by their pre&s;ence, their a&s;&s;iduity, their numbers, and their tears. In how much wor&s;e a &s;ituation are we than your Papi&s;ts, whom for their ob&s;tinacy in an uncon&s;ti|tutional and per&s;ecuting religion, you have made the outca&s;ts of legi&s;lation. What then is the freedom, and what are tho&s;e Britith privileges, to which you confe&s;s we are entitled? What are tho&s;e rights which we have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed above an hundred years, which we derived from &s;olemn compact, which we have purcha&s;ed by an un&s;haken allegiance, and by the profits of our trade?</P></Q>
<P>IN this reply, which I have put into the mouth of a Coloni&s;t, I have examined, pretty minutely, the real extent of American li|berty, under the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures. I have &s;hewn the <HI>di&s;&s;imilarity</HI> of their condition to our own, and to that of a free people. I &s;hall now &s;hew the &s;imilarity of their condition to that of tho&s;e nations whom we call &s;laves. The author of the Letter to Lord Hill&s;bo|rough,
<PB N="6" REF="011193_0008_0F85CD78B6414458">&s;ays, "Libertas recipit magis et minus, that there are degrees of freedom." I allow it. In what does perfect political liberty con&s;i&s;t? Some authors define it to be, "the power of do|ing what the laws permit." If I do not mi&s;take the meaning of this definition, it is clearly erroneous. To do what the laws of Turkey permit, certainly is <HI>not</HI> liberty. Perfect political liberty con&s;i&s;ts rather, &mdash; in the not being &s;ubject to any laws, but &s;uch as we have con&s;ented to by our&s;elves, or by our repre&s;entatives. If Britain is but imperfectly repre&s;ented, it has but an imperfect free|dom. But con&s;idering the imperfection of every thing human, it may well boa&s;t of the excellence of its con&s;titution. There are other nations, the lives and fortunes of who&s;e inhabitants are de|pendant upon the will of &s;ome per&s;on whom they do not elect, and whom they cannot remove; or upon &s;ome other country, in the government of which they have no &s;hare, France, Spain, and Turkey are in&s;tances of the fir&s;t; Cor&s;ica, while it was under the yoke of Genoa, of the &s;econd. All &s;uch governments are ab&s;olute or de&s;potic, and the people &s;ubject to them we call en&s;laved. Be|tween their &s;ituation and our own, there are indeed many degrees. But I defy the author of the letter to Lord Hill&s;borough, to &s;hew, that any of tho&s;e degrees would be enjoyed by the Americans, if mea&s;ures &s;hould be carried to the extremes which we now hear of. I do not &s;ay that there is <HI>not</HI> a medium, between a good con&s;titu|tion, and &s;imple de&s;poti&s;m; but I &s;ay the Americans would not <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s</HI> that medium. He objects to the advocates for America, their a&s;&s;erting, "That if dependance be enforced in any the lea&s;t degree, the Coloni&s;ts are &s;laves." Let him not object it to me; my a&s;&s;ertion is that they are &s;laves, if the Briti&s;h Parliament a&s;|&s;umes unlimitted power over them, <HI>in every particular what&s;oever.</HI> If a people can be deprived of their lives and their property, by another per&s;on, or another nation, is it not evident that &s;uch a people is not free? whether it be by a nation, or by a monarch, is not material. The ma&s;ters indeed are di&s;&s;erent, but the <HI>govern|ment</HI> is equally de&s;potic. The Helots of Sparta were as much &s;laves, as the &s;ubjects of the Grand Signior. Now I defy any per&s;on to mention one &s;ingle power, which the Spartan Republic a&s;&s;umed over the Helots, which England does not a&s;&s;ume over her Colonies. I would not in&s;inuate that Great-Britain will not govern with greater humanity: but if her power be mildly admini&s;tered, it will indeed be a <HI>milder</HI> de&s;poti&s;m, but it will not therefore be <HI>the le&s;s</HI> a de&s;poti&s;m. Should we thus addre&s;s our&s;elves to a colony of France or Spain: You live under an ab&s;olute government; transfer your allegiance to us, and you &s;hall enjoy tho&s;e privileges which Great-Britain diffu&s;ed through all her dominions. Might it not an&s;wer us in the&s;e words; "I am not burthened with taxes in near &s;o great a proportion as your Colonitis, but I would con&s;ent to pay more than I do, if I were to enjoy a greater degree of free|dom. What then are tho&s;e privileges which you offer to me? We might &s;ay to them, One of the principal privileges &s;hall be this,

I find then that my repre&s;entatives are not to be a part of that Briti&s;h Parliament which is to tax me; were I &s;ubject to the ab&s;olute dominion of an a&s;&s;embly elected by the provinces and cities in France, &s;hould I be one whit more free, than in being &s;ubject to the ab&s;olute dominion of its monarch?

<P>HAVING examined the real condition of the Coloni&s;ts, under the pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ed mea&s;ures, with as much attention as I am capable of, I can find in it no circum&s;tance, which &s;hould prevent my a&s;&s;erting that they would be as de&s;titute of freedom, as any nation ever was, or ever can be: now whatever tho&s;e rights and privileges may con&s;i&s;t in, which confe&s;&s;edly belong to the Ameri|cans, they certainly do <HI>not</HI> con&s;i&s;t in <HI>&s;lavery,</HI> which is the want of every right, and the deprivation of every privilege.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;hewn that the compari&s;on between the Americans and tho&s;e Britons who have no &s;uffrages, is fal&s;e; and that if it were true, it would not be argumentative. I have &s;hewn what the free|dom of the Americans does <HI>not</HI> con&s;i&s;t in, and I will now endea|vour to &s;hew what <HI>are</HI> tho&s;e privileges which for our own &s;akes we mu&s;t allow them. I cannot help ob&s;erving in this place, that every one who has written again&s;t them, has confined his endea|vours to the proving which of the Briti&s;h privileges they ought <HI>not</HI> to po&s;&s;e&s;s; but not one of them has mentioned tho&s;e privileges which they <HI>ought</HI> to enjoy. It is a little &s;u&s;picious that tho&s;e au|thors who&s;e profe&s;t de&s;ign is to convince and to conciliate the Co|loni&s;ts, have never once enumerated tho&s;e advantages which they are &s;till to enjoy under parliamentary government.

<P>IN order that taxation and repre&s;entation may not be united in America, the adver&s;aries of America deny that they were united in Britain. And attempts have been made to produce in&s;tances of their di&s;union, taken from different periods of the Briti&s;h con&s;titu|tion. It is not material to my cau&s;e, to examine whether tho&s;e attempts have &s;ucceeded. If America be entitled to Engli&s;h privi|leges, the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, &s;he is entitled to that con&s;titution, as it &s;tood at the <HI>time</HI> when the colonies were planted. She is not to have the con&s;titution that exi&s;ted in the time of William the Conqueror, or of the Saxon heptarchies, or of the Roman govern|ment. If England communicated to America her con&s;titution and her privileges, we communicated them &s;uch as &s;he her&s;elf at that time enjoyed. It was the con&s;titution of England at that period, that every man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of 40 <HI>s.</HI> a year, by that free tenure which we call a freehold, &s;hould have a vote in electing a member of that a&s;&s;embly which alone could tax his property; be&s;ides certain per|&s;ons inve&s;ted with privileges in cities and boroughs. This was and is the bulwark of Engli&s;h liberty; without this we &s;hould be &s;laves. This then is the con&s;titution which is communicated to America: let not therefore <HI>her</HI> property be taxed, except in an a&s;&s;embly to which <HI>her</HI> freeholders and electors &s;end a repre&s;enta|tive. In the Saxon con&s;titution, the privilege of voting was dif|fu&s;ed much more univer&s;ally; it belonged to all who held by a free tenure; that is, to all the <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> of England; for tho&s;e who hold by other tenures were not &s;ubjects, but vilani, or &s;laves. So entire was the union at that time, between repre&s;entation and tax|ation: but to this con&s;titution the Coloni&s;ts have no preten&s;ion, as it was not the con&s;titution of England at the time of their e&s;tabli&s;h|ment. By the 8th of Hen. VI. the right of voting was confined to &s;uch freeholders as had 40 <HI>s.</HI> a year, and thus the more opulent freeholders were entru&s;ted with the rights of all the re&s;t. It ap|pears to me that England by this change had <HI>two</HI> kinds of repre|&s;entatives. The richer freeholders repre&s;ented the <HI>others,</HI> and the
<PB N="10" REF="011193_0011_0F85CD7B1A40CF58">Hou&s;e of Commons repre&s;ented <HI>them.</HI> Thus the opulent freehol|ders were <HI>repre&s;entatives of election</HI> con&s;tituted by their circum|&s;tances; and the knights were <HI>repre&s;entatives of legi&s;lation,</HI> ap|pointed by &s;uffrage. If there be any ju&s;tice in this opinion, all the <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> of England were either actually or virtually repre&s;ent|ed. But if there be not, and if it be admitted that England was and is <HI>partially</HI> repre&s;ented&mdash;Give a repre&s;entation <HI>as</HI> partial to her Colonies. If Britain be imperfectly repe&s;ented, &s;he has but an <HI>imper&s;ect</HI> freedom; but if the Colonies have <HI>no</HI> repre&s;entation, they have no freedom at all. If Britain has <HI>not</HI> the <HI>be&s;t</HI> con&s;titution, which human invention could have &s;ugge&s;ted; is it a rea&s;on that America &s;hould have the <HI>wor&s;t?</HI></P>
<P>IN the memorable conte&s;t with the II&mdash;e of P&mdash;rs about the right of originating taxes, the C&mdash;ns urged with great force their exclu&s;ive right to that privilege. They thought it unrea&s;onable, even that any part of the taxes &s;hould be encrea&s;ed or dimini&s;hed, or that the rates &s;hould be examined by the P&mdash;rs, "who&s;e proportion in all taxes, in compari&s;on to what the com|monalty pay, is very incon&s;iderable." I believe the &s;ame a&s;&s;embly think the&s;e words to contain good &s;en&s;e at this day; and it is un|doubtedly very rea&s;onable, that tho&s;e who give the mo&s;t, &s;hould have the greate&s;t &s;hare in modelling the gift. Such were the max|ims that were formerly adopted by that great a&s;&s;embly, and &s;uch were the rea&s;onings on which their greate&s;t privilege is e&s;tabli&s;hed. Why then do they <HI>now</HI> think it rea&s;onable, that tho&s;e who pay not an <HI>incon&s;iderable,</HI> but <HI>no</HI> proportion, &s;hould not only originate a tax, but pa&s;s it into a law Compare the &s;pirit of their former maxims, with that of their pre&s;ent. "It is unju&s;t in you, my L&mdash;ds, to <HI>begin</HI> a taxation, of which you pay only a &s;mall pro|portion." Yet we will <HI>impo&s;e</HI> a tax upon America, of which we pay no proportion at all. "It is unju&s;t that you, my L&mdash;ds, &s;hould even <HI>originate</HI> a tax upon men, of whom you are but the le&s;&s;er number, though the re&s;t may afterwards refu&s;e it if they plea&s;e." But is it ju&s;t for us to enact a tax-law for the Coloni&s;ts, which they &s;hall <HI>not</HI> have a power to refu&s;e, although we are not any part of them? "The right of propo&s;ing taxes belongs to us as repre&s;entatives of the people who pay them, and yet we will tax a people of whom we are <HI>not</HI> repre&s;entatives." Bills of &s;upply are looked upon, not only as laws, but as free gifts; and, on account of this difference in their natures, they are &s;ubject to different forms. The lords cannot originate them, although they al&s;o are <HI>legi&s;lators.</HI> And it is not the royal <HI>a&s;&s;ent,</HI> which is given, but the royal <HI>thanks.</HI> The 9th of Henry 7th, enacts, that the King &s;hall <HI>thank</HI> both Lords and Commons; but if our Parliament &s;hall tax the Coloni&s;ts, to whom are the r&mdash;l thanks to be addre&s;&s;ed? Is he to thank his <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;ubjects, for giving him the property of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> Is he to thank the Engli&s;h, for money which they
<PB N="11" REF="011193_0012_0F85CD806BCC0940">do not pay, or the Americans, for a <HI>free gift,</HI> wre&s;ted from them again&s;t their will? Which of the&s;e mockeries would be mo&s;t un|worthy the great &s;cene on which they are to be acted?</P>
<P>MUCH declamation has been u&s;ed, on both &s;ides. The Engli&s;h &s;peak of the blood and trea&s;ure they have expended. The Ame|ricans, that they have encountered an inho&s;pitable climate for the purpo&s;es of Great Britain, and have dedicated their lives and for|tunes, to her &s;ervice. There is no weight in any of the&s;e decla|mations. Whatever was done by either of them, was done for their own advantage. If Britain has protected the property of America, it does not con&s;titute her the owner of that property. She has, for her own &s;ake, protected in their turns, almo&s;t every country in Europe, but that does not make her the proprietor of tho&s;e countries, or give her a power of taxation over them. If America, in pur&s;uing her own intere&s;t, has advantaged Britain, we owe her no obligation. Whil&s;t we each po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e benefits for which we expended our trea&s;ure, and for which they encoun|tered that climate, we owe nothing to each other but reciprocal affection. To extend their commerce, our ance&s;tors encouraged the emigration of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects. Their indu&s;try abroad was thought more advantageous, than their re&s;idence in Britain. As an inducement to forego tho&s;e privileges which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or might acquire at home, it was agreed that they &s;hould carry Engli&s;h privileges along with them. And as an inducement to become the carriers, and the labourers of England, they were en|dowed with a de&s;art territory, u&s;eful only by the indu&s;try they &s;hould be&s;tow upon it, and this was given to them, as their <HI>wages.</HI> Let not a compact, founded in our intere&s;t, pucha&s;ed by their labour, and confirmed by time, &s;uffer any violation. Let us be content with our commercial advantages, and tho&s;e &s;uperiorities which they willingly &s;ubmit to. Let us make them labour for us; but let us not take from them their <HI>wages,</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>HAVING con&s;idered the ju&s;tice of the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures; let us now examine their policy; and in this examination, let our &s;enti|ments of equity forget to operate. Let us forget that they have rights, or that we have humanity. Let us &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves en|tering into an agreement, with a <HI>free</HI> and a <HI>con&s;iderable</HI> people, and &s;ettling the terms of an everla&s;ting union. Or if any one &s;hould be of opinion, that neither of the&s;e circum&s;tances is applicable to the Colonies; let us &s;uppo&s;e them in their numbers incon&s;iderable, unaccu&s;tomed to liberty, overawed by fear, or humiliated by con|que&s;t, and ready to receive any con&s;titution, we plea&s;e to impo&s;e upon them. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, what reflections &s;hould our own intere&s;t &s;ugge&s;t to us? Though this people be weak, at pre&s;ent, their &s;trength and their numbers may increa&s;e
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is whim&s;ical that Mr. Canning mentions the probable in|crea&s;e of the Americans, as an argument for meatures, that mu&s;t exa&s;perate them.</NOTE>; though we our|&s;elves

We our&s;elves have a free con&s;titution: if we grant liberty to them, they will be &s;teady to us, becau&s;e they can|not change for the better; if we a&s;&s;ume unlimited and ab&s;olute au|thority, they will wi&s;h to change, becau&s;e they cannot change for the wor&s;e. The tyranny of a de&s;potic commonwealth is infinitely wor&s;e than that of a de&s;potic prince. But it is vain to endeavour to deceive them; though they never have ta&s;ted liberty, they will &s;oon become acquainted with its nature. They will perceive the <HI>mi&s;ery</HI> of their &s;ituation, by the happine&s;s of <HI>ours.</HI> While their gar|ri&s;ons are filled with our &s;oldiers, their harbours with our fleets, and their employments with officers of our appointment, and while they derive from us a degree of freedom, we &s;hall be &s;ecure, both by our own power, and by their affections. They are weak, by their circum&s;tances, let us not make them &s;trong, by their de&s;|pair. The gradual increa&s;e of numbers and of opulence, may add to their force, but that force will &s;leep, unle&s;s it be awakened by injury: and while we retain an ab&s;olute power over their trade, that very increa&s;e will depend upon our regulations. Whil&s;t they are happy under our government, their &s;trength and their opulence will be &s;trength and opulence to us; but, if we oppre&s;s them, they will be our weakne&s;s, and our danger. The numbers of a people are not &s;o formidable, as their union, their hatred, their fury. If there ever &s;hould come a time when they &s;hall be able to &s;hake off our &s;overeignty, it will pa&s;s unheeded, by a grateful and happy people. But if our dominion be founded <HI>only</HI> in <HI>our</HI> &s;trength, it will &s;ub&s;i&s;t no longer than <HI>their</HI> weakne&s;s. It is therefore evident that we &s;hall hold America, by a better &s;ecurity, if we do not en|&s;lave it. But will it afford us as much pre&s;ent emolument? This &s;urely is a con&s;ideration, much inferior to the other; it may have more weight with a &s;hort-lived and a &s;hort-&s;ighted admini&s;tration; but can never have &s;o much with a thinking nation. Yet let even this be con&s;idered; we know that this nation has paid con&s;iderable taxes, without any compul&s;ion; and we know that free nations can &s;upport greater burdens, than nations equally opulent, that are en&s;laved. No power, no management, has ever &s;ucceeded to tax the latter, as highly as the fir&s;t; and the efforts of de&s;poti&s;m have produced only depopulation or rebellion. Thus it is by no means certain, that even our pre&s;ent emoluments would be the le&s;s, if we extort nothing from them again&s;t their own con&s;ent

We are now at peace with the world; the mo&s;t rigorous mea&s;ures may &s;ucceed, for the pre&s;ent; but &s;uch mea&s;ures are not the mo&s;t eligible in them&s;elves, when conducive neither to pre&s;ent advantage, nor future &s;ecurity.

Though we cannot dive into their pur&s;es, to wre&s;t from them what they have <HI>already</HI> acquired, we can prevent their <HI>future</HI> acqui&s;itions.

<P>THUS, on every pre&s;ent, and every future con&s;ideration, I &s;hould think my&s;elf an enemy to Great-Britain, &s;hould I propo&s;e to give wor&s;e terms to a people unendeared by former connections, unacquainted with liberty, and de&s;titute of any claim upon our ju&s;tice, than tho&s;e which are demanded for <HI>our fellow &s;ubjects.</HI> But it mu&s;t not therefore be forgotten, that they have long been our friends and brothers; and that another &s;y&s;tem cannot be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, without a violation of national faith, a departure from our ju&s;tice, and, at one time perhaps, the &s;hedding of their blood. We &s;hould be well a&s;&s;ured of the rectitude of our cau&s;e, we &s;hould advance to the utmo&s;t limits of negotiation, before we draw the &s;word, again&s;t our brothers. We &s;hall prevail, with certainty, in|deed, but we may not prevail, without a conte&s;t. And though the force of terror only, may give temporary e&s;tabli&s;hment to our authority, the &s;word and the executioner only, mu&s;t maintain it. From men deprived of every thing that they hold mo&s;t dear, and deprived of it by their friends, what may not be expected? Any thing &s;hould be expected, except their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. What then are the ultimate objects of the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive laws, and mo&s;t &s;angui|nary councils? Will they re&s;tore us to that brotherly affection, which infu&s;ed the &s;ame &s;oul into every part of our empire, or pro|cure us an certain quiet, a di&s;affected &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion? Let France ex|pect

Is this that invincible union, and that firm e&s;tabli&s;hment, by which Britain &s;hall hold the We&s;t Indies, in her right hand, and the Ea&s;t, in her left! Or is this the wi&s;dom which mu&s;t heal pub|lic credit of a thou&s;and wounds, and &s;upport the weight of a tot|tering empire? There may come a time when the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Great-Britain may require the utmo&s;t efforts of a grateful people, and our po&s;terity may find, by a fatal experience, that the &s;word was but an ill interpreter of charters; and that the characters of freedom, will not be le&s;s indelible in the brea&s;ts of the Americans, if they be written in the blood of their forefathers. What &s;hall I &s;ay of the&s;e mea&s;ures?

<P>THESE con&s;iderations I have pre&s;umed to dedicate to the great|e&s;t a&s;&s;embly in the world, and to the be&s;t of princes. If they car|ry any conviction along with them, the con&s;equences naturally follow. Fir&s;t, that we &s;hould leave the Americans to tax them|&s;elves: Secondly, that we &s;hould retain to the Briti&s;h Parliament, every power that is not incon&s;i&s;tent with our ju&s;tice and their li|berty: That a law &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed, immediately, repealing every act, that taxes the Colonies. I do not propo&s;e that it &s;hould con|tain any counter-declarations, or that the power &s;hould, in terms, be di&s;claimed. It will be &s;ufficient that they be repealed, and that we do not revive the claim.

<PB N="15" REF="011193_0016_0F85CD8331834B00">at any time hereafter, it may be di&s;puted where the line is drawn, between American liberty and Briti&s;h juri&s;diction, perhaps it might not be improper to declare, in the &s;ame law, the &s;uprema|cy of Britain, and its ab&s;olute dominion over navigation and com|merce. Can we a&s;&s;ert the dependency of the Coloni&s;ts, in &s;tron|ger terms than tho&s;e of Mr. Otis, a Gentleman who is certainly well informed of their &s;entiments, and who has probably a con|&s;iderable &s;hare in forming them,
<Q>That the Parliament of Great-Britain has undoubted power, and lawful authority, to make acts for the general good, which by naming the Colonies, &s;hall, and ought to be equally binding, as upon the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain within the realm.</Q> Should the Coloni&s;ts complain, that if this power be re&s;erved, they have not the &s;ame degree of free|dom, or all the privileges that are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by their Briti&s;h Bre|thren, I &s;hall readily confe&s;s that they have not: but it was not intended, by their original compact, that they &s;hould. If Britain does not re&s;erve to her&s;elf an ab&s;olute authority, over the trade of her Colonies, not one of the ends will be an&s;wered, for which tho&s;e Colonies were planted: they will not be &s;ub&s;ervient to the commerce of their mother-country; they will rival and de&s;troy it. And &s;urely we &s;hall not be deemed enemies of their freedom, in adopting the &s;entiments of its able and intere&s;ted defender. The power of regulating their commerce, and the right of prohibition, have indeed a mo&s;t exten&s;ive dominion, over the wealth and pro&s;|perity of America; and tho&s;e demands mu&s;t be exorbitant, indeed, which can be refu&s;ed to an a&s;&s;embly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o mighty a prero|gative. But there is a material difference, between &s;topping the acqui&s;ition of riches, and the taking away what is already ac|quired. They have all but a bitter alternative; but bitter as it is, <HI>they have an alternative,</HI> &s;ays Mr. Otis, in the true &s;pirit of liberty,
<Q>I had rather &s;ee this (right of prohibition) carried with a high hand, to the utmo&s;t rigour, than have a tax of one &s;hilling, taken from me, without my con&s;ent.</Q></P>
<P>IT is &s;o much the intere&s;t of Britain, to promote the com|mercial welfare of her Colonies, that they may form a rea&s;onable expectation, that the&s;e intere&s;ts are &s;afely depo&s;ited. But on this &s;elf-intere&s;t, on the wi&s;dom and equity of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature, and on the conciliating moderation of their own conduct much, very much, of their pro&s;perity will depend. Of this moderation we have as yet made no trial. When we de&s;i&s;ted from <HI>actual</HI> op|pre&s;&s;ion, we laid its <HI>future</HI> foundations, and the repeal of the Stamp-Act, was attended with the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;ertions, of our <HI>right</HI> of taxation; a&s;&s;ertions which an upright admini&s;tration never in|tended to carry into experiment, but an unhappy compliment, which wi&s;dom and virtue paid to the temporization and prejudice. If impre&s;&s;ed with a conviction of their freedom, the Americans have a &s;en&s;e of injury, let not Britons re&s;ent the &s;entiments they have communicated. Let us maturely con&s;ider whether we our|&s;elves
<PB N="16" REF="011193_0017_0F85CD83F103B6D8">were not the aggre&s;&s;ors. If force is ju&s;tifiable in de&s;troying tho&s;e rights, which are derived from time, from compact, and from nature; what is not ju&s;tifiable for their maintainance and &s;up|port? If the cau&s;e of the Americans be ju&s;t, their firmne&s;s is virtue.</P>
